Defense Forces: "On the Border Defense Troops' Traditions Day 
-- Let's Develop the All-People Strength, Maintain Sovereignty 
and Security on the Fatherland's Borders"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] With the background of profound 
international changes, on the one hand, there are opportunities 
for us to win peace, to expand our international relations, and 
to develop our country; on the other hand, we must do our best 
to remain vigilant because the adversary forces are frantically 
pushing their "peaceful event" plots and tricks combined with 
armed rioting so as to overthrow the socialist system in our 
country. The issues involving land borders, national 
sovereignty, and the struggle against violations and seizure of 
our border and sea-island sovereignty, resources, and national 
interests are becoming urgent and complicated ones. The 
activities of various kinds of political, criminal, and economic 
violators who take advantage of the "open door" situation are 
increasing and becoming more and more daring and well-organized, 
with the use of arms and the connections between the country and 
the outside creating many hot issues regarding the security and 
order on our borders and the sea. This is the reason why the 
work of organizing our border defense is playing an extremely 
important role and there must be a thorough understanding of the 
task and view mentioned in Resolution 3 of the CPV Central 
Committee, namely, to strengthen the management and maintaining 
of our sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to maintain 
security and order on the borders, coast, and islands of our 
fatherland. 
  The need for managing and maintaining sovereignty and 
security on our national borders in the new situation must be 
total, with maintaining our sovereignty, territorial integrity, 
resources, environment, and national interests being closely 
combined with maintaining political security and social order 
and security, and defeating the criminals' peaceful-event plots, 
violations of territorial sovereignty, and sabotaging of 
security and order; at the same time, we must thoroughly 
understand the foreign policy of our state in the renovation 
period, build the peace-and-friendship borders with our 
neighbors, and open the doors and expand international relations 
in the fields of foreign investment and economic cooperation. In 
order to fulfill the above-mentioned task and need and to act on 
our own initiative under any circumstances, on the basis of our 
recent experience we must build a strong all-people border 
defense, maintain national solidarity, and closely combine 
socioeconomic development with strengthening and consolidating 
our national defense and security. Now and in the coming years, 
we must continue to properly implement the government's Decision 
16/HDBT aimed at raising the quality and effectiveness of 
the Border Defense Day; make people know very well the new 
situation and task; heighten their revolutionary vigilance; 
strengthen and consolidate the political bases and the movement 
to maintain the fatherland's security; build the people's 
security front along with the all-people national defense front; 
and develop solidarity with and attachment to the people, joint 
combat and mutual assistance relations between the border 
defense forces and the people and forces stationed on the 
borders, and hence mobilization of the country's total strength 
to serve the task of building and defending our borders, 
particularly in the situation of unexpected events suddenly 
taking place. 
  We need to build a more profound and stronger all-people 
border defense on the basis of developing the all-people 
strength, the strength of the country and the political system 
as a whole, from inland areas to the borders, both in the rear 
and at the front, so as to resolve on a first-priority basis the 
urgent socioeconomic issues and to build strong border and 
coastal areas and islands, particularly the highlands and remote 
areas, which will serve as the base for building the front line 
based on the people's wishes, the front line based on the 
people's security, and for firmly defending our national borders. 
  We need to strengthen leadership provided by the ministries 
and central sectors and by local echelons and sectors, and to 
mobilize the people all over the country and particularly the 
ethnic groups in border and sea-island areas for properly 
implementing Directive 525/CT-TTg on a number of programs and 
measures aimed at developing socioeconomic conditions in the 
highlands and among ethnic groups, and Directive 399 CT/TTg on 
the task of developing the sea-based economy. The border 
defense troops, along with central and local committees and 
sectors, are to continue to effectively carry out programs 
calling for joint action with the Ministries of Education and 
Training, Culture and Information, and Public Health; the 
Vietnam Women's Union; and the Youth Union Central Committee and 
to obtain better and better results from them. At the same 
time, they must join with the localities in basic investigations 
of the socioeconomic conditions in border villages so as to 
introduce there programs of action having important and key 
provisions. 
  As for the border defense troops, after 35 years of 
building, doing regular work, fighting, and growing up, they 
need to develop their proud traditions; to heighten their 
political capabilities and fighting power in all fields; to do 
their best to overcome any remaining shortcomings and 
weaknesses; to continue consolidating solidarity, democracy, and 
internal discipline; and to eliminate such negative aspects as 
authoritarianism and harassment of the people so as to 
strengthen the blood-and-flesh attachment to the people, to 
correctly implement the national and religious policies, and to 
turn themselves into strong, well-trained, regular troops 
capable of properly fulfilling their task while continuing to 
combine border defense work with socioeconomic development as a 
means to improve the standard of living and with strengthening 
of the masses' work as an important political task of the forces. 
  The task of maintaining sovereignty and security in border 
areas requires that we set renovation at the same level as that 
of the new need and task. By fully learning from the "consider 
the people as the roots" lesson, knowing how to develop the 
strength of the masses while creating favorable conditions for 
stabilizing their living conditions, effectively promoting 
socioeconomic development, and achieving national wealth and 
strength, as well as a fair and civilized society, we will 
certainly succeed in building a front line based on the people's 
wishes that becomes stronger and stronger everyday, maintaining 
national sovereignty and territorial integrity, contributing to 
maintaining the country's political stability, and bringing 
victory to the renovation undertaken by our party and people as 
a whole.

<F P=106> [Article by Vo Hong Anh: "Border Defense Troops Show </F>
Strong Fighting Spirit, Close Army-People Solidarity"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Our country is getting better 
everyday as it travels on the total renovation road under the 
leadership of the party. What is important in the new period 
is to maintain political stability in order to gradually achieve 
economic, cultural, and social development, as well as 
strengthening of national defense and security. Taking 
advantage of the renovation policy, open borders, and 
international circulation, the adversary forces from without 
have been strengthening their infiltration across the borders, 
maintaining contact with the reactionaries within the country to 
develop their strength, and building covert installations along 
the borders and the coast. Through touristic activities, visits 
with relatives, and border crossings, they have been bringing in 
people, means, and reactionary materials to support the forces 
within the country. They have been taking advantage particularly 
of our ethnic people's current economic difficulties in order to 
incite them, to distort our party's policies and line, and thus 
to destroy their confidence in the party, and at the same time 
using economic means to gain the support of the masses, to 
attract them to their side, and to gradually create an 
opposition force fighting against the revolution. In the last 
several years, they had been taking advantage of the 
nationalistic and freedom-of-religion policies adopted by our 
party to engage in illegal propaganda, with the hope that they 
could raise complicated political issues, gain influence toward 
the masses, and cause instability from within, particularly in 
border areas, where the standard of living and intellectual 
capacity of the people remained low. Although the development of 
a market economy and business deals with foreign countries was 
active, there appeared a lot of complications such as 
across-the-border smuggling, criminal acts, and social ills, 
which sometimes destabilized law and order in border areas and 
made the border defense troops' responsibility for protecting 
and managing the borders much heavier. 
  In the last 5 years, the forces in charge of the southern 
sea 
zone caught 596 foreign boats which had violated our fishing 
grounds. With active support from the people, the border defense 
troops handled 186 cases of illegal border entries and 8,567 
major cases of smuggling involving 533 cars and motorcycles, 
2,284 kilograms of opium, and so on. 
  To help the people, particularly the ethnic people, has 
always been considered by the border defense troops their 
central work. Their activities, such as "medical doctors of 
blue military rank" and "teachers of blue military rank," 
reflecting their spirit of sacrifice in saving the people in 
natural disasters like storms and floods, and in sharing food 
and clothing with the people, have further strengthened the 
close relationships between the army and the people. 
  On 22 February 1989, the Council of Ministers issued 
Decision 
16/HDBT to set the 3rd day of March every year as the Border 
Defense Day. Since the promulgation of this decision, party 
committee echelons, local administrations, mass organizations, 
and social organizations have been showing their wholehearted 
interest in turning the activities on "Border Defense Day" into 
a widespread movement being carried out in many rich and lively 
forms. In border provinces and cities throughout the country, 
many movements, such as "assault youth being the masters of 
borders," women "for our borders," "peaceful hamlets," "model 
elders and village chiefs," and so on, have succeeded in 
mobilization.

  [Text] It was revealed on 23 April that the U.S. 
Department of Defense [DOD] has briefed the Japanese defense 
industry about the development costs concerning the Theater 
Missile Defense (TMD) project, which will amount to $30 billion 
(approximately 3 trillion yen). According to a source concerned 
with the industry, the DOD has asked the Japanese industry "to 
participate in the development of the TMD, or provide advanced 
technology equivalent to the amount of the development costs." 
  Under the TMD system, reconnaissance satellites and other 
devices confirm the launching of missiles by an enemy, then 
multistage pursuit missiles shoot them down. Taking into 
consideration that the DPRK (North Korea) has succeeded in test 
launching a ballistic missile the range of which can reach 
Japan, the United States has indicated its proposal to the 
Defense Agency for joint development of the TMD system between 
Japan and the United States. The two countries are now holding 
working-level discussions on the proposal. 
  The Japanese defense industry has suffered from a decrease 
in 
business due to restraints on defense expenses. As stated by an 
executive of a major missile-related company, for this reason 
each defense-related company is considering whether it is 
possible to make good use of its technology, stating that "the 
TMD is an attractive project because it will lead to new 
business projects." 
  However, it is not easy for them to provide the United 
States 
with technology equivalent to development costs totaling $30 
billion. A person concerned with the industry said: "It is 
feared that cooperation may not be limited to technology of 
liquid crystals and compound materials, which the United States 
has originally demanded." Moreover, it is expected the United 
States will divert Japan's technology to other purposes, such as 
civilian production. 
  According to an executive of a defense-related company, 
because it is reportedly "difficult for both the Japanese 
Government and private sector" to share a considerable amount of 
the development costs due to the financial conditions and 
management environment of private companies, Japan will likely 
face difficulties in dealing with the U.S. proposal.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Take Global View of Unemployment Problem"] </F>
  [Text] If there are two key words in the current world 
economy, they are "competitiveness" and "employment." How will 
the unemployment problem of 35 million people in the leading 
industrial nations be dealt with? The labor ministers conference 
(employment summit) in Detroit of the Group of Seven leading 
industrial nations agreed to act in concert to create jobs. 
  We appreciate their having set up a plan to create jobs 
through healthy macroeconomic policies, market opening, and 
technological innovations, and by rejectiving employment 
protectionaism, a trap which we tend to fall into because of our 
eagerness to protect our own employment potential. 
  The employment problem is casting a dark shadow across the 
economies of leading industrial nations. Although the U.S. 
economy is on the road to recovery, it is not breaking free from 
a limiting "growth in joblessness." The recovery of the U.S. 
economy has begun with rationalization of companies that focused 
on downsizing the work force. However, the shift to new job 
areas is not progressing smoothly, and people continue to 
experience job dissatisfaction brought on by lower real wages. 
  The countries of the European Union (EU) which have 
double-digit unemployment are burdened by structural 
unemployment among youthful laborers. With the influx of 
refugees, the unemployment problem is acute politically. The 
situation is one of "today's joblessness, tomorrow's 
lawlessness" (INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE). Although Japan's 
unemployment rate is low, with adjustments in employment gaining 
momentum, employment practices put in place since World War II 
are being undermined. 
  What each leading industrial country is being confronted 
with 
by the employment issue is a result of changes in the world 
economy. In the globalization of the world economy, the 
countries of Central and South America and Asia have entered on 
stage as exporting countries by maintaining a manufacturing base 
with low wages. This is linked to a structure of excess supply 
and capacity among the leading industrial nations. While the 
economic development of the emerging countries widens the 
horizon of world markets, it threatens unemployment among the 
leading industrial nations. 
  The danger underlying this situation is that we fall into a 
protectionist trap in order to maintain employment levels and to 
enhance competitiveness. For that reason we appreciate and value 
the attitude of the leading industrial nations in cooperation to 
solve the employment problem. 
  No doubt the key to expanding employment is macro economic 
policy. At the employment summit, expectations were in 
particular focused on Japan's expansion of domestic demand. To 
stimulate domestic demand is Japan's own choice and it is also 
tied to alleviating the worldwide employment problem. 
Unfortunately, only the minister of labor attended the 
employment summit; the minister of finance and minister of 
international trade and industry decided not to attend. If it 
was out of fear of pressure on Japan to increase domestic 
consumption and to open Japan's markets, it was too makeshift an 
approach. But had it been decided that the employment problem 
should be left to the responsibility of the Labor Ministry, that 
would lack in economic common sense. 
  That the employment summit was not quite satisfactory is 
probably because the cooperative action was left to the 
responsibility of each individual country. They could have 
exchanged ideas further on the concept of a "global new deal" to 
create jobs sponsored by U.S. labor unions. 
  In the post-Cold War world economy, if we are to eliminate 
the employment crisis as the topic of greatest common interest, 
we must doggedly hasten to write a global prescription to effect 
a cure.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "First Attempt at Multilateral </F>
Prescription for Employment Summit; Sense of Crisis Shared, But 
Thoughts Differ"] 
  [Text] A meeting on employment problems (an employment 
summit) was held in Detroit on 14 and 15 March and was attended 
by the economic ministers of the seven leading industrial 
nations. This was the first attempt to try to find a 
multilateral prescription to solve the unemployment problem. 
Nevertheless, it is true that "concrete policy solutions are not 
easy to come up with" (Treasury Secretary Bentsen). An agreement 
was made at the meeting that the employment problem will be an 
important conference topic at July's leading industrial nations 
meeting (the Naples summit). Japan, being criticized as 
"exporting unemployment," will therefore experience even greater 
pressure to open its market and to expand domestic demand. 
  Summarizing the two days of discussions, Treasury Secretary 
Bentsen made a closing statement to the summit attendees. In it 
he brought out clearly the difficulties of creating substantive 
policy while there is a sense of crisis over the problems of 
employment and unemployment that are common to the nations 
represented. 
  In his introduction Bentsen pointed out that, "Creating 
high-quality jobs and lowering unemployment is a common task of 
(the seven leading industrial nations)." He emphasized the 
importance of the seven leading industrial nations discussing 
solutions to the unemployment problem on the same table. In the 
background of this seems to be the frustration that, although 
global economic conditions show signs of improvement, the 
"unemployment rate shows no improvement at all" (Ministry of 
Labor). 
  As for Europe, the unemployment rate exceeds 10 percent in 
France, England, and Italy; the long-term unemployment among the 
youth in particular is a severe problem. In the United States 
the unemployment rate is above 6 percent, with the disparity in 
wages widening between those at the top and those at the bottom. 
Although the unemployment rate in Japan is low compared to the 
other leading industrial nations, the prolonged economic slump 
has made it worse. 
  Former Labor Minister Kondo, who advocated an employment 
summit, reflected that with the nations discussing a common 
topic in this fashion at a Group of Seven meeting, the finance 
ministers and the governors of their central banks "tend to 
focus on monetary and fiscal policies." Labor Minister 
Sakaguchi, who attended the employment summit, emphasized the 
significance: "It's important that there be a multilateral 
position regarding employment policies based on focused 
discussions." 
  But even with a common sense of crisis, once concrete 
policymaking is underway, accommodating each leading industrial 
nation's viewpoint will complicate matters, which will then get 
out of control. 
  While noting in his closing statement that "macroeconomic 
policy for changing job structures brings major results," 
Bentsen also refers to the importance of microeconomic policy, 
such as "the importance of retraining workers within 
enterprises," "technological innovation creates jobs," etc. His 
statement is all-inclusive and that is because it is "an 
amalgamation of the assertions made by each country" (Labor 
Department). 
  In the United States, where the government traditionally 
adheres to market principles and does not intervene in 
employment problems, "the thinking is strong that the approach 
is to create jobs and eliminate unemployment through 
macroeconomic policies" (Chairman Nagano of Nikkeiren [Japan 
Federation of Employers' Associations]) such as interest rate 
inducements and public investment. President Clinton at the 
employment summit urged "Japan to expand domestic demand and 
Europe to lower interest rates." That Bentsen's statement 
incorporated the importance of macroeconomic policy and the 
opening of markets may be taken to show the strong disposition 
of the United States at work. 
  On the other hand, in Europe, "Governments have a tendency 
to 
formulate policies that interfere excessively with business in 
order to maintain current employment levels" (Ministry of 
Labor). In Japan, too, because there is the issue of maintaining 
the lifetime employment system, "microeconomic policy is being 
given relatively serious consideration in employment 
policymaking" (Labor Minister Sakaguchi). 
  The incorporation by Bentsen in his statement of the need 
for 
"the exchange of employment specialists" and "mutual research on 
the employment systems of each leading industrial nation" 
included the contentions of both the European Union and Japan. 
"First we will need to study each country's microeconomic policy 
and then learn together from the examples of successes and 
failures" (Labor Minister Sakaguchi). 
  However, in the final analysis, they did not arrive at a 
substantive plan of action just by collecting the assertions of 
each nation at the summit. Of necessity, in order to continue 
discussion, it was specified in Bentsen's statement that, "The 
employment problem will be on the agenda at the Naples summit." 
  Some people indicate that "there are pitfalls." The general 
view is that Detroit, the Mecca of the U.S. automobile industry, 
was chosen for the employment summit "to show the people in the 
United States that the U.S. administration is earnest in trying 
to solve the employment problem and, at the same time, to 
pressure Japan to open its markets" (MITI). 
  As a result, a sense of crisis has surfaced in Kasumigaseki 
"Japan is made to pledge publicly to formulate effective 
economic policy to expand domestic demand, deregulation, and the 
opening of its markets by the time of the Naples summit." 
  "We were able to avoid emotional Japan-bashing and the 
criticism that Japan is exporting unemployment," which was 
anticipated at the beginning of the employment summit" (MITI and 
the Labor Ministry). However, it was furthermore made clear that 
it will not be easy to find solutions to problems of employment 
and unemployment where business practices vary from country to 
country. It can be anticipated that "outside pressure" on Japan 
will strengthen ever more and that in preparation the government 
is tasked with the heavy homework assignment of effective 
macroeconomic policymaking.

  [Text] On 24 April, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi 
Ichikawa commented on the possibility of Japan's logistical 
support for U.S. and other foreign forces if the United Nations 
imposes economic sanctions against the DPRK (North Korea) and a 
naval blockade is enforced in connection with North Korea's 
suspected nuclear weapons development. He stated: "If the 
United Nations makes the decision, Japan for its part intends to 
provide as much as cooperation as possible. If it is necessary 
for Japan to join in logistical support activities, Japan has no 
choice but to do so." Ichikawa made the remarks in a TV Asahi 
program. His remarks are believed to have virtually approved 
Japan's logistical support for U.S. forces. 
  Discussing the connection between the exercise of the right 
of collective self-defense, which the Constitution bans, and 
logistical support, Ichikawa said: "For example, oil supplies 
to U.S. forces has been banned because it is believed to be 
included in collective self-defense under the conventional 
interpretation of the Constitution by the Cabinet Legislation 
Bureau. However, because (the North Korea issue) is an 
important issue concerning Japan's security, oil supplies to 
U.S. forces are also deemed to come within the category of 
individual self-defense." He added: "If it is necessary to 
take legislative measures, we have to do that."

  [Text] The issue concerning the DPRK's suspected nuclear 
program will reach a turning point by early May because that is 
when the time limit is due for North Korea to respond to the 
presidential statement issued by the UN Security Council [UNSC] 
at the end of March. The statement calls on the DPRK to accept 
additional nuclear inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA). Pyongyang recently announced it would 
allow IAEA inspectors to monitor the exchange of fuel rods at an 
experimental reactor, though it is not among the nuclear 
facilities for the IAEA is demanding inspection. This move was 
unexpected. Nevertheless, the DPRK's nuclear issue may enter a 
severe phase depending on the contents of the report the IAEA 
will soon submit to the UNSC. The new Hata administration will 
face this grave issue immediately after its inauguration on 25 
April. 
  A top Foreign Ministry official pointed out a change in the 
DPRK's attitude toward the nuclear problem, saying "Pyongyang 
appears to have dropped its conventional attitude of `refusing 
to talk with anyone'" in the face of the time limit. 
  As an indication of the change, he cited recent "soft-line 
remarks" by President Kim Il-song. The president said to 
foreign news media: "If the United States provides North Korea 
with a light water reactor, it may make the existence of a 
radiochemistry research institute in Yongbyon unnecessary"; "the 
remark by a North Korean Government official that `Seoul will be 
engulfed in flames' was inappropriate"; and "I would like to 
visit the United States." 
  Nonetheless, a prevailing view in Tokyo is "it is too early 
to conclude that North Korea has changed its stand." Concerning 
Pyongyang's proposal to allow the IAEA to monitor the exchange 
of fuel rods, a Foreign Ministry source said: "The proposal 
does not include the acceptance of additional nuclear 
inspections, which is of great importance. Although the 
proposal may be a strategic move towards accepting additional 
inspections, we need more time to find out." 
  Japan will be urged to prepare itself for various 
situations. 
In particular, it will be asked to cooperate in imposing 
economic sanctions against the DPRK, which will possibly be 
carried out without a UN resolution. While examining for 
reference the sanctions against Iraq during the Gulf war, the 
Foreign Ministry, the Finance Ministry, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry, and other government offices 
have studied relevant laws and government and ministerial 
ordinances. As a result, the government has decided to place 
priority on unified actions by Japan, South Korea, and the 
United States whether or not the United Nations adopts a 
resolution. 
  If economic sanctions are imposed, a naval blockade will be 
enforced by U.S. and other foreign warships. In this case, the 
issue will be taken up for discussion when reviewing the 
Self-Defense Forces Law and the Commodity Control Law to enable 
Japan to provide "logistical support" to those warships, 
including suppling such commodities as foodstuff, fuel, and 
weather service vital to navigation. It will also be necessary 
for the government to draw up a rescue plan to evacuate Japanese 
nationals in South Korea in case of emergency.

<F P=106> [Discussion by Professor Toshiyuku Munekata of Teikei </F>
University, Professor Tadashi Nishihara of the National Defense 
Academy, and Councilor Yoshiji Nogami of the Foreign Ministry's 
Foreign Policy Bureau; presided over by Takashi Kawauchi, chief 
of the MAINICHI SHIMBUN Foreign News Department; from the 
"Verification of North Korea's Suspected Nuclear Development" 
series; part one in a two-part series: "How Is Japan Going To 
Respond to `Sanctions'?"] 
  [Text] [Kawauchi] While formulating the basic policies of 
the new coalition government, the ruling coalition parties have 
confirmed a basic policy for dealing with North Korea's 
suspected development of nuclear weapons. The policy states: 
"Japan will prepare for a future emergency in line with a 
policy to be adopted by the United Nations." A series of 
discussions carried by MAINICHI SHIMBUN on 5 and 6 April focused 
on North Korea's suspected nuclear development and on analyzing 
how the issue will develop in the future. This time, we would 
like to discuss what implications the issue has for Japan and 
how Japan should deal with it. 
  First, I would like to ask whether the UN Security Council 
will impose economic sanctions against North Korea. 
  [Munekata] I believe the UN Security Council will impose 
economic sanctions on North Korea. In that event, the UN 
Security Council is expected to undertake three stages of 
sanctions against that country: surveillance in accordance with 
Articles 39 and 40 of the UN Charter, economic sanctions in 
accordance with Article 41, and military sanctions in accordance 
with Article 42. There is a high possibility that, in 
accordance with Article 42, the UN Security Council will impose 
military sanctions, including interception of vessels. There is 
also the possibility a naval blockade will be imposed against 
North Korea, thus threatening the potential use of force. Japan 
should prepare for these sanctions by revamping its laws and 
ordinances. 
  [Nishihara] Japan should prepare itself in anticipation of 
economic sanctions being imposed against North Korea, but I do 
not think the United States will go that far. The foundation of 
the coalition government in Japan remains fragile, and it is 
still uncertain how far China will go along with sanctions. 
Given these facts, it is possible that, even if the United 
States takes the lead in imposing economic sanctions against 
North Korea, the sanctions would not generate the desired 
effect, slapping the United States in its own face. 
  [Nogami] What concerns me is that public opinion in Japan 
may be divided over the handling of the issue. In reality, 
there is no way to resolve the issue but through moderate means. 
Radical sanctions are costly. The term "sanctions" was not in 
the presidential statement of the UN Security Council. Even if 
the possibility of imposing economic sanctions emerges in the 
future, Japan should seek a diplomatic solution. No matter what 
the international community says, Japan should seek a phased 
solution of the issue while leaving room for North Korea to 
alter its policy. 
  The issue is problematic and is related to two 
aspects--nuclear nonproliferation and stability in the Far East, 
including on the Korean peninsula. From the viewpoint of 
nuclear nonproliferation, it is necessary to take severe 
measures to punish North Korea. Yet what is important for both 
Japan and South Korea is stability in the Far East, including on 
the Korean peninsula. Attaching importance to the two, the 
United States is trying to maintain a balance between them. In 
that case, it would be good for the international community to 
express strong concern over North Korea's suspected development 
of nuclear weapons instead of imposing economic sanctions. 
  [Munekata] There are two types of economic sanctions. 
First, economic sanctions are imposed against North Korea, with 
prior knowledge that it will not generate the desired effect. 
Second, an economic blockade is imposed to physically prevent 
goods from flowing into North Korea. Economic sanctions can be 
imposed with the knowledge they are full of loopholes, then 
steps can be taken to make a blockade effective. It is 
important to make sure North Korea receives our signal; it is 
necessary to make diplomatic efforts to correctly catch mutual 
signals. Japan should prepare for economic sanctions while 
taking this process into account. It required about one year 
for Japan to draft a bill on the Peacekeeping Cooperation Law. 
If Japan fails to prepare in a timely manner for economic 
sanctions, it will have to improperly deal with a catastrophic 
situation. 
  [Nogami] The UN Security Council issued a presidential 
statement instead of a binding resolution, with the primary aim 
of getting China to heed international opinion. The council 
issued the presidential statement as a message that the 
international community wants North Korea to take the 
fulfillment of its obligations laid down by the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) seriously. In a bid to send a 
strong message to North Korea, the UN Security Council has the 
option of imposing loose sanctions against that country. Yet 
Japan cannot take the lead in imposing such sanctions, and 
American public opinion will not tolerate Japan's attitude. 
  [Kawauchi] What should the international community ask North 
Korea to do for the time being? 
  [Nogami] For the time being, North Korea will be asked to 
allow international inspections of a radiation chemical 
laboratory from among its seven declared nuclear facilities, the 
inspections having been agreed upon between the IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] and North Korea. The next 
problem is to inspect undeclared nuclear facilities in North 
Korea. There is a possibility the declared nuclear facilities 
have greatly changed from when North Korea first declared them 
to the IAEA. If the declared facilities have greatly changed, 
they will be subject to special inspections. For the time 
being, efforts will be made to return the situation back to the 
time when North Korea announced its plan to pull out of the NPT. 
As for checking undeclared nuclear facilities, U.S.-North Korea 
high-level talks will discuss how to conduct the checks. In 
that sense, there is a framework to resolve the issue 
diplomatically. 
  [Nishihara] North Korea is suspected of operating other 
nuclear facilities; the IAEA will attempt to check these 
suspected facilities. Japan may have to consider how it should 
live with a North Korea which possesses nuclear weapons. 
  [Kawauchi] If North Korea really wants to have nuclear 
weapons, it will have to pull out of the NPT. However, North 
Korea is trying to obtain some goal by playing the nuclear card 
instead of pulling out of the NPT. How long should the United 
States and other nations continue their diplomatic game with 
North Korea with no prospect of resolution in sight? 
  [Munekata] It is a struggle with time. To explain to what 
extent North Korea has developed nuclear weapons, the prevailing 
view is that North Korea has extracted enough plutonium to build 
one or two warheads, and has almost manufactured a detonation 
device. It will take one or two years before North Korea can 
test the warheads and build nuclear weapons. The United States 
and other nations are expected to refrain from taking any 
hardline measures that could undermine the NPT until April 1995 
when the NPT is extended. The United States and other nations 
will begin sending strong messages to North Korea once the NPT 
is extended. However, even if diplomatic signals are sent to 
North Korean leaders, it is doubtful whether they will take the 
signals seriously. 
  [Kawauchi] Japan learned a lessen from the Gulf war. I 
believe the Japanese people feel that "at the time Japan was 
unable to properly respond to the war, and thus Japan should not 
repeat that experience." How should Japan use that lesson in 
dealing with North Korea's suspected development of nuclear 
weapons? What is the government studying now? 
  [Nogami] During and after the Gulf war, economic sanctions 
were imposed against Iraq to keep goods from flowing into that 
country. It is legally possible for Japan to prevent goods from 
flowing into North Korea. Approximately 50-60 billion yen has 
been remitted to North Korea every year, with the money being 
used to pay for imports from Japan. The remittance of the money 
will naturally be halted once trade between Japan and North 
Korea is embargoed. The government can stop the remittance to 
North Korea of more than 5 million yen by pro-North Korean 
organizations in Japan in accordance with the Foreign Exchange 
Law. Ethnic Koreans residing in Japan have carried yen when 
they travel to North Korea, and I think the amount of yen they 
have carried has been somewhat exaggerated. 
  [Kawauchi] Nogami, do you mean that the Foreign Ministry 
thinks Japan can deal with economic sanctions against North 
Korea under laws currently in force, and that it does not need 
to amend any laws to deal with sanctions? 
  [Nogami] If the UN Security Council imposes the same 
economic sanctions against North Korea as against Iraq, there 
will be no problems with dealing with such sanctions. However, 
Japan will be unable to regulate travel to North Korea by ethnic 
Koreans residing in Japan. Approximately 250,000 pro-DPRK 
Koreans currently reside in Japan, and the government cannot ban 
their travel to North Korea. 
  [Nishihara] Will they not be prohibited from reentering 
Japan? 
  [Nogami] The government must treat pro-DPRK Koreans and 
pro-ROK Koreans equally. They have all been granted permanent 
residence. From a humanitarian point of view, the government 
cannot prohibit pro-DPRK Koreans from reentering Japan while 
allowing pro-ROK Koreans to do the same. 
  [Kawauchi] As a means to deal with a crisis on the Korean 
peninsula, the government should study ways to airlift the 
Japanese residing in South Korea back to Japan. What do you 
think? 
  [Nogami] The airlifting to Japan of its citizens residing in 
South Korea would require amending the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] 
Law, and that is a delicate issue. If the government openly 
discusses an airlift, it will create useless apprehension among 
those Japanese residing in South Korea. Recently the government 
has been calmly studying ways to evacuate them. The government 
must study such means while making it clear to the Japanese 
residing in South Korea that the situation on the Korean 
peninsula is not serious at the moment. 
  [Munekata] Speaking from the military standpoint, the 
current SDF Law limits naval interception action to Japanese 
territorial waters. The law permits naval interception only 
when legitimate self-defense and emergency evacuations are 
required on the high seas. The law also permits SDF ships to 
rescue other Japanese warships on the open sea. By law, SDF 
vessels capable of sweeping mines can do nothing for South 
Korean ships in danger of being hit by mines. This indifferent 
action cannot be tolerated internationally. It will be 
necessary to pass legislation within a limited time frame. The 
government should consider how to deal with refugees fleeing 
from North Korea to Japan when economic sanctions are imposed. 
  [Kawauchi] Munekata, do you mean the Diet needs to revamp 
relevant laws? 
  [Munekata] Yes, the Diet needs to do so in order to put the 
SDF under civilian control. The worst situation will occur if 
and when procedures are not set to deal with an emergency 
situation, and the handling of the emergency is left to the 
judgment of SDF members. If politics does not make clear what 
to do to deal with such situations, Japan will run into trouble. 
  [Nishihara] The SDF has no service regulation allowing it to 
participate in UN-endorsed naval interception. If Article 9 of 
the Constitution is interpreted as permitting the SDF to 
participate in collective self-defense, the SDF can participate 
in UN-endorsed naval interception. It goes without saying that 
the SDF can only provide lateral support for naval interceptions. 
  [Nogami] If ships in question do not enter or leave Japanese 
ports, there will be no need for naval interception. The 
Maritime Safety Agency will deal with stowaways. 
  [Munekata] It will take time for North Korea to shift its 
nuclear card from a political into a military instrument. There 
is no need to stir up public opinion right now. It is important 
to study ways to revamp laws currently in force to ready Japan 
for an emergency situation.

<F P=106> [Article by Shunji Taoka: "What Would Happen to Japan if </F>
War Were To Erupt on the Korean Peninsula?"] 
  [Text] Last February, when Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa returned to Japan after meeting with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton in Washington, he immediately asked his cabinet to 
consider possible measures which might be adopted by Japan 
should the UN Security Council decide to impose economic 
sanctions against North Korea. 
  Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Defense 
Agency presume that "the odds are against the outbreak of a war 
on the Korean peninsula," they have been conducting secret 
discussions on possible actions that might be taken in case of 
an emergency on the peninsula, as well as on legal issues 
relevant to the subject. However, such a stance might provoke 
North Korea or strike panic into the South Koreans. 
  Before undertaking any discussion, the Defense Agency is in 
fact obliged to presuppose that it would be nearly impossible 
for the Self-Defense Forces to go into action under the existing 
laws and under the current political situation. This is why the 
Defense Agency officially refuses to admit that such discussions 
are under way. "No comment. Please understand why we cannot 
make ourselves clear whether or not we are conducting such 
discussions," the agency says. 
  A high-ranking official of the Defense Agency said 
ironically: "Our action will depend on the government's 
decision. For the moment, we are just told to pursue 
discussions. However, as we did not receive any concrete 
instructions--for instance we do not know what kind of situation 
we have to presuppose--we are not making much progress in our 
discussions. It is as if we have been told to design a house 
without receiving such necessary information as the floor area 
or construction cost." 
  If we put together the current objective circumstances 
surrounding the Korean peninsula, and the different remarks made 
by officials belonging to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or to 
the Defense Agency, we can obtain a picture of what would happen 
to Japan if war were to break out on the Korean peninsula. 
  First, the Japan-U.S. arrangement concerning prior 
consultation would be called into question. This arrangement is 
mentioned in the notes attached to the Treaty of Mutual 
Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States. 
  Under this arrangement, the United States should hold prior 
consultations with the Japanese Government if it wants to 
undertake military operations directly from Japan, that is to 
say, if it wants to use its Japan-based fighter and attack 
aircraft to wage war on North Korean forces intruding into the 
South. 
  The decision on whether Japan would give its assent to the 
United States lies with the government. However, the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and the Defense Agency already presume that 
Japan would give a green light to the United States. 
  If a war broke out on the Korean peninsula, and if Japan 
remained reluctant to provide active support, Koreans and 
Americans with strong anti-Japanese sentiment might say: "The 
war was protracted because of Japan, and it cost our countries a 
greater sacrifice in human life." Many Japanese officials do 
not want Japan to become the target of such criticism. 
  Some 160 U.S. fighter and attack aircraft are now stationed 
in Japan. About 50 F-15 fighters attached to the 18th Air Wing 
are based at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa Prefecture. 
  At Misawa Air Base in Aomori Prefecture, there are some 50 
F-16 fighters attached to the 432th Air Wing. At Iwakuni Marine 
Corps Air Station in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Marine Air Group 12 
has some 40 F/A-18 fighter bombers and 20 AV-8B Harrier II's 
(vertical takeoff and landing attack aircraft). If a war breaks 
out on the Korean peninsula, these aircraft will sally forth 
into the Korean skies, with the support of refueling and 
electronic countermeasures aircraft based at Kadena Air Base or 
at Futenma Marine Corps Air Station in Okinawa Prefecture. 
  Approximately three days after the sally, the Yokosuka-based 
USS Independence (a 79,200-ton aircraft carrier with 84 
carrier-based aircraft) will arrive in the Sea of Japan or in 
the Yellow Sea with its escort, Destroyer Squadron 15 
(comprising two cruisers, three destroyers, and four frigates). 
The USS Independence will remain inside Japan's air defense 
identification zone, for example near the Okinoshima Islands, 
and its carrier-based aircraft will sortie from there under the 
cover of E-2C airborne early warning aircraft and F-15J fighters 
belonging to the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force. Some 200 
Tomahawk cruise missiles may also be launched as well. 
  Four landing vessels, including the Sasebo-based 39,400-ton 
amphibious assault ship "Belleau Wood," will head to Okinawa to 
pick up some 2,500 U.S. Marines attached to the Third Marine 
Division. The United States will try to inhibit the North Korean 
forces from making their next move by showing that it is 
preparing for an amphibious assault in cooperation with some 
25,000 South Korean Marines. As reinforcements, other fighter 
squadrons will immediately join the operations directly from the 
United States, thanks to the support of air tankers. 
<H5>  Will Itazuke Again Become a U.S. Air Base? </H5>
  If we include the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard, 
the United States now has a total of 46 air wings. The United 
States Air Force is capable of immediately mobilizing eight air 
wings, namely some 400 military aircraft, should an emergency 
arise on the Korean peninsula. The only problem would be where 
to deploy these aircraft. One air wing per base is the general 
rule. If we follow the rule, only Kwangju Air Base would be 
available in South Korea. Therefore, the United States might use 
Pusan or Cheju Airports, or it might try to quickly restore 
abandoned airfields in the south of the country. 
  Moreover, there is a great possibility that the United 
States would ask Japan for permission to use several airfields 
in northern Kyushu and in the Chugoku District. 
  In addition to Tsuiki Air Base (Fukuoka Prefecture in 
Kyushu), Ashiya Air Base (Fukuoka Prefecture), and Miho Air Base 
(Tottori Prefecture in the Chugoku District), the United States 
might even ask for the use of the former Itazuke Air Base, which 
has become the current Fukuoka Airport. During the Korean war, 
Itazuke was the most important base for the United States Air 
Force. Fukuoka Airport is currently under the jurisdiction of 
the Ministry of Transport and the Self-Defense Forces. It would 
be difficult for Japan to refuse the U.S. request because of the 
Japan-U.S. agreement concerning the use of facilities and areas 
in Japan by the U.S. Armed Forces. If the United States were 
granted the use of Fukuoka Airport, it would become a major 
problem since civil aircraft would no longer be able to use this 
important airport located only a short distance from the heart 
of Fukuoka. Moreover, Fukuoka residents would raise a hue and 
cry if they saw bomb-laden fighters taking off one after 
another, or if they saw damaged fighters flying low over the 
city to make emergency landings. 
  According to the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, 
under the current arrangements it would be necessary to obtain 
concurrence from the concerned municipalities and landowners 
should the U.S. Armed Forces want to use a Japanese air base for 
military combat operations because it would correspond to a 
major change in the use of the facilities. "The United States 
might ask the Self-Defense Forces to take it upon themselves to 
guard major bases against a surprise attack by North Korean 
special forces. It might also ask us to cooperate in the 
transport of fuel and ammunition," a general officer of the 
Ground Self-Defense Force said. 
  If North Korean special forces attacked Japanese facilities, 
the Self-Defense Forces would be called out for national 
defense. In such a case, the Japanese Government would be able 
to assign the Self-Defense Forces to guard facilities which 
present major targets for the enemy--such as U.S. military 
bases, the Prime Minister's Official Residence, and nuclear 
power plants--because Japan would be in a state of war. 
However, the existing Self-Defense Forces Law does not allow 
the Self-Defense Forces to take the field prior to the fact. In 
time of peace, guard duties have to be fulfilled by the police. 
Since special forces are professional killers and infiltrators, 
it would be very difficult for the Japanese police to fight them 
with nightsticks and guns. 
  North Korea has developed a ballistic missile called the 
"Nodong I." With an estimated range of 1,000 km, the missile is 
capable of hitting most parts of Japan. However, the missile is 
not deployed yet since it is still in an experimental stage. At 
the end of May 1993, North Korea test-fired the Nodong I at a 
range of 500 km. So far, only one missile has been test-fired. 
  If North Korean nuclear reactors are working properly, there 
is a possibility North Korea has already produced a certain 
amount of high-grade plutonium from which several nuclear bombs 
can be produced. However, whether North Korea's attempt to scale 
down the size of nuclear weapons was successful is open to 
doubt. Can North Korea really make a nuclear warhead or nuclear 
bomb? In 1974, when India conducted its first nuclear test, it 
was reported that its nuclear device was as large as a house. 
  Even if North Korea has successfully manufactured a nuclear 
device, it has probably not yet developed a mobile nuclear 
weapon. Such is the dominant view among U.S., Japanese, and 
South Korean military experts. 
<H5>  Chemical Weapons Are Much More Dreadful Than Nuclear Devices </H5>
  When he appeared on NBC on 3 April, U.S. Secretary of 
Defense 
William Perry said: "North Korea might have manufactured one or 
two nuclear weapons." This remark has attracted public 
attention. Even if the North Korean nuclear device is large, it 
might become a practical weapon if it could be carried by ship 
or a plane. However, in order to make a warhead, it is necessary 
to develop a nuclear device whose weight does not exceed one ton 
and whose diameter does not exceed one meter. 
  Meanwhile, there is no reason to doubt information released 
by the United States and South Korea that North Korea is 
manufacturing several kinds of chemical weapons. The production 
of chemical weapons requires simple technology which was 
developed during World War I. Every country can easily produce 
chemical weapons if it has a chemical industry. Such powerful 
chemical weapons as yperite [mustard gas] have already been put 
to practical use during World War I. There is a story which 
illustrates the strength of the gas. An officer brought his 
binoculars back to his room without knowing the strap was 
stained with a few drops of mustard gas. During the night, the 
negligible amount of mustard gas escaped as vapor, blinding the 
officer. 
  Nerve gas, which was developed by the Germans before World 
War II, is the same as agricultural chemicals and insecticides. 
However, if the skin is touched by a fine grain of nerve gas 
weighing no more than 0.002 grams, then breathing ceases as the 
nervous system is immediately paralyzed. According to U.S. 
estimates, 250 tons of chemical weapons are now stored in North 
Korea. This amount corresponds to tens of thousands of shells. 
Chemical weapons have little effect on soldiers wearing a 
watertight chemical warfare combat suit and gas mask. However, 
if chemical weapons are fired into cities in the form of rocket 
bombs or missiles, people will panic as they will be at a loss 
as to what to do. If 20 million people living in Seoul and its 
environs tried to escape from the city, South Korea would 
collapse into utter confusion, such that both the U.S. and South 
Korean forces would be unable to launch an effective 
counterattack. 
<H5>  It Would Be Extremely Difficult To Rescue Japanese Residents </H5>
in South Korea 
  Many representatives of Japanese firms reside in South Korea 
with their families. Some 6,400 Japanese now live there. 
Moreover, on average 4,500 Japanese go to South Korea every 
day. If we assume these travelers spend four or five days in 
South Korea on average, we should consider that there are an 
extra 20,000 Japanese in South Korea. 
  Many examples show that a war often starts with a sudden 
attack. In case of war, Kimpo International Airport in the 
suburbs of Seoul as well as the port of Inchon would probably be 
of no use since both facilities would come within range of North 
Korean heavy artillery and antiship missiles. The Seoul-Pusan 
superhighway would be used exclusively for military transport. 
Moreover, this freeway is designated to become an emergency 
runway. Meanwhile, traffic on public roads would be heavily 
jammed. In the midst of great confusion, Japanese citizens 
would probably have difficulty buying train tickets to Pusan if 
they could not speak fluent Korean. Since the port city of 
Pusan is about 450 km south of Seoul, there would be no 
possibility of reaching there on foot. 
  Despite these dangers, there seems no promise that the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs would immediately urge Japanese to 
restrain themselves from traveling to South Korea should the UN 
Security Council decide to impose economic sanctions against 
North Korea. This is because Japanese travelers spend 100-odd 
billion yen a year in South Korea. Thus, if Japanese tourists 
and businessmen stopped traveling to South Korea, it would be 
similar to imposing severe economic sanctions on that country. 
  "If the Maritime Self-Defense Force is allowed to use its 
vessels on rescue missions following amendment of the 
Self-Defense Forces Law, it would send its ships to Pusan to 
rescue those Japanese remaining in southern Korea," a flag 
officer of the Maritime Self-Defense Force said. 
  Meanwhile, it will become a major problem if the United 
States asks the Maritime Self-Defense Force to sweep mines 
before the United States Marine Corps launches an amphibious 
assault. Neither the United States nor the South Korean Navies 
have enough minesweepers. Moreover, they are both less 
experienced in this field than the Japanese Maritime 
Self-Defense Force. However, the situation would not be the 
same as when Japanese minesweepers cleared the Persian Gulf. 
The area where mines are placed to defend against the enemy's 
landing operations is generally covered by friendly artillery 
deployed along the shoreline. If minesweepers enter the area, 
artillery generally fires on them. Thereupon, escorting 
destroyers usually fight back by bombarding the shoreline from 
sea. 
  If Japan wanted to dispatch its minesweepers on such a 
dangerous mission, it might have to use its own escort vessels 
for cover since it would be too impudent to ask U.S. or South 
Korean warships to escort Japanese minesweepers. This means 
that if Japan accepts the U.S. request for minesweeping, it 
might be drawn into direct involvement in a war outside its 
territory. If that is the case, Japan would be forced to ignore 
the Constitution and the Self-Defense Forces Law. The sea 
battle would probably cost Japan a sacrifice in human life and 
property. 
  Despite such dangers, it seems the Maritime Self-Defense 
Force is somewhat eager to meet the U.S. request. According to 
the Maritime Self-Defense Force: "The decision lies with the 
government, but if the United States and South Korea complain 
that their troops were unable to land on enemy shores because of 
the nonparticipation of Japanese minesweepers, we would be 
mortified. Japan-U.S. relations, based on mutual confidence, 
would be affected." 
  The Maritime Self-Defense Force has always examined the 
possibility of dispatching its ships to sweep mines along the 
coast of South Korea in case of an emergency. 
  Meanwhile, Japanese minesweepers have had experience in 
landing operations. When the Korean war broke out in 1950, 
Japanese minesweepers belonging to the Maritime Safety Agency 
were called out under the pretext they would be assigned to 
clear the Straits of Tsushima, which is Japanese territory. 
However, they were immediately ordered by the United States 
Occupation Forces to head to East Korean Bay to support the U.S. 
landing operation in Wonsan, North Korea. A minesweeper sank as 
a result of an explosion in battle, killing one crew member.

  [Text] Brussels, 24 April -- There are again growing 
demands for restrictions on the total volume of Japanese cars, 
including those produced in Europe, within the European Union 
[EU]. In an interview with a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter, 
Association of European Automobile Manufacturers (ACEA) 
Secretary General Lenier [name as published] indicated that ACEA 
will ask the European Commission and other organizations 
concerned to take restrictive measures, saying: "The share of 
Japanese cars in the European market should be frozen." Similar 
opinions have also been voiced in the European Parliament. The 
1991 Japan-EU agreement does not impose restrictions upon 
Japanese cars produced in Europe. However, this issue is likely 
to remain a controversial problem in the future, because the 
European auto industry has been faced with business difficulties 
due to the prolonged economic slump. 
  The new ACEA chairman and secretary general took office this 
year. In his explanation of ACEA policies under the new 
leaders, Lenier touched on the Japanese car issue, and said: 
"The total volume of Japanese cars, including not only cars 
which are directly imported from Japan, but also those produced 
in Europe and imported from third countries (such as the United 
States) should be frozen." The ACEA has also presented this 
demand to the European Commission. 
  In accordance with the Japan-EU auto agreement, Japan has 
restricted its exports at a rate higher than the overall drop in 
European car sales. For example, in 1993 Japan set the quota of 
direct exports at 980,000 units, which was 18.5 percent lower 
than that of the previous year.

  [Text] Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will visit Italy, 
France, and Germany from 3 May, and make his debut on the 
international stage as a prime minister. 
  While this will be a trip undertaken on very short notice 
after former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's sudden decision 
to resign, it is deemed necessary to fill the diplomatic vacuum 
resulting from the domestic political confusion. Hata has also 
decided to push through with the European visit because of the 
need to establish a relationship of trust with leaders of 
European countries before the meeting of leaders of the advanced 
nations (Naples summit) in July. Furthermore, since cooperation 
with the European states is closely linked to a breakthrough in 
Japan-U.S. relations, the primary diplomatic task for Japan at 
the moment, the prime minister is expected to face a serious 
diplomatic challenge immediately after his assumption of office. 
  Hata is scheduled to hold talks with French President 
Francois Mitterrand, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the new 
Italian prime minister during his European tour. However, the 
political situation in Italy remains volatile, and the new prime 
minister may not be chosen before Hata's visit. 
  This visit to Europe was originally planned for former Prime 
Minister Hosokawa during the Golden Week holidays [29 April-5 
May]. Hata has decided to comply with the original schedule as 
the successor to Hosokawa. 
  During his meetings with European leaders, Hata is expected 
to convey the message that, even after the change of political 
regimes, Japan's basic policies will remain unchanged under the 
new administration, and the Hosokawa administration's reform 
policy of market liberalization through deregulation and other 
measures will be maintained and further developed. 
  Russia's participation in the Naples summit will also be a 
major item on the agenda. Hata will also exchange views with 
the European leaders on the DPRK's development of nuclear 
devices, and the situation in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Both the Japanese ruling and opposition parties agree that 
the primary diplomatic issue for the new administration is how 
to effect a breakthrough in the stalled Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks. The government would like to find a solution 
before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting to be held during the 
Naples summit. 
  In this connection, since the European countries have 
consistently taken the position that the numerical targets 
demanded by the United States may contribute to managed trade, 
the Japanese Government believes that "the prime minister's 
upcoming visit to Europe will be important for Japan's relations 
with the United States" (according to a Foreign Ministry source).

  [Text] Due to the pluralism in the political world, 
including the emergence of many political parties, businessmen 
think that politicians should not interfere with the personnel 
matters of bureaucratic organizations, though they do expect 
bureaucrats to play more important roles than before. This was 
revealed by a poll Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic 
Organizations] conducted on 22 April. It seems businessmen hold 
severe views about politicians. 
  The poll was conducted from approximately 1,500 executives 
and managers from firms belonging to Keidanren; 37.2 percent of 
them responded. 
  When asked "if bureaucrats will have more chances to display 
their abilities" because of the collapse of the long-lasting 
Liberal Democratic Party administration and other factors, 55.4 
percent of the respondents answered "yes." 
  As a reason for answering "yes," a managing director of a 
major supermarket said: "There are not many lawmakers who can 
claim the title of good politician; bureaucrats are more 
competent than politicians." A department chief of an 
information industry said: "It is easy for bureaucrats to take 
the leadership when there is confusion in political circles." 
This view was shared by many respondents. 
  A question was asked "if politics should be given an 
advantage over bureaucratic organizations in personnel matters" 
to prevent bureaucrats from having their own way. Only 27.2 
percent of the respondents agreed. According to an executive of 
a medical company, as a reason for opposing political 
intervention in the personnel affairs of bureaucratic 
organizations, some of the respondents said "it is a problem 
because ministers are replaced every several months, and it is 
questionable if politicians have adequate knowledge of or study 
enough about what they are required to know." 
  Moreover, as areas where they expect the bureaucrats to 
fulfill their roles in the future, many of the respondents 
enumerated such areas as disaster prevention, protection of the 
global environment, and national security. Areas such as 
overall agricultural policy, monetary exchange control, and 
promotion of regional economic buildup were mentioned by only a 
few respondents.

"Promising Political Scientist Probes the Depths of `Blueprint 
for Building a New Japan'"] 
  [Text] Stereotyped Criticisms Are Inapplicable 
  It has been my assignment for a considerable period of time 
to comment on Ichiro Ozawa's actions. When he organized the 
so-called Ozawa study group during his days in the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) and resolutely proposed national security 
measures and constitutional revisions for Japan, I made or 
published comments in response to a number of requests from 
newspapers and periodicals. At that time, coupled with my 
impression that he might be someone who thought out matters much 
more thoroughly than the leftist politicians, frankly speaking, 
I was greatly perplexed that he might be a new type of 
politician not found in the traditional LDP. 
  My intuition that the stereotyped criticisms against the 
traditional LDP politicians were not applicable to him was not 
mistaken even in the light of his subsequent actions. Thinking 
that carefully thought-out logic must be readied when 
criticizing Ozawa, I had deferred finalizing comments on Ozawa. 
  My thoughts were further strengthened after comparing my 
publication, Political Reform (Iawanami Shinsho), 
which did not sell as well, but which was published at about the 
same time last year as Ozawa's bestseller, Blueprint for 
Building a New Japan (Kodansha). As though he perceived my 
perplexity, Takashi Mikuri (Tokyo Metropolitan University 
professor), a political scientist whom I respect, submitted the 
following comments to the YOMIURI SHIMBUN readers' section: 
  "Above all, the most striking parts of Yamaguchi's book 
(Political Reform) and Ozawa's book (Blueprint 
for Building a New Japan), which should basically assume 
antithetical positions, are the aggressiveness shown in the 
desire for reform. The views toward `reform' of Yamaguchi, who 
is farthest from power, and Ozawa, who has been in the center of 
power, are in agreement to an astonishing degree. Thus, `reform' 
proposals by amateurs and professionals will begin to coincide 
on a concrete level before Japan reaches the 21st century" (5 
July 1993 issue of YOMIURI SHIMBUN). 
<H5>  For Competitive System Rather Than Linkage </H5>
  It is true that regarding criticisms against closed politics 
under the 1955 setup, which I will touch upon later, my 
assertions and Ozawa's arguments have many points in common. 
However, I cannot get rid of the feeling that I want to avoid 
the role of waving the political reform banner by siding with 
Ozawa-style "political reform." What is necessary now for 
political scientists is to present a vision of creating a 
healthy competitive system within Japanese politics. If Ozawa's 
paradigm becomes the next fixed framework of Japanese politics, 
Hosokawa's coalition regime would become a repetition of Konoe's 
supportive government and if I link up with this trend, then I 
would probably be called a "pocket edition" of Sadaji Yabe 
(Tokyo University professor--then, Fumimaro Konoe's "brain"). I 
do not know with what intention Mikuri wrote that comment, but 
if only Ozawa's paradigm existed in 21st century Japan, that 
would be termed a great tragedy. 
  At any rate, at present, when the one-party rule by the LDP 
has ended and reorganization of the party system has entered the 
second round, the stage of discovering common points in 
criticism against the old system and marshaling energy to 
destroy the old setup is ending. Of course, as indicated by the 
difficulties in passing the political reform bill, great 
political efforts are needed to eliminate long standing abuses, 
but the task that is called for hereafter is the development of 
various ideas regarding a political design under the next party 
system. Also, when that task is undertaken, the Blueprint 
for Building a New Japan will be an unavoidable publication 
presenting concepts for the next generation. When the political 
force to oppose Ozawa's Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] group is 
organized, too, the plan for the new political force will 
probably be formulated in refutation of this book. 
  As mentioned frequently, there might be a question as to 
whether this is Ozawa's individual work, but as long as it is a 
book published after his perusal and in his name, it is not 
improper to treat him as a political theorist or strategist. The 
very fact that he gathered outstanding brain trusters and 
published the book with precise timing might be said to be a 
testimony to his excellence as strategist. In view of Ozawa's 
performances and activities as a politician, particularly in 
relation to corruption, I do not deny the importance of the type 
of criticisms (so-called "settlement disputes"), which cast 
doubts on the credibility of his arguments, but a number of 
scathing articles have already been written about that point. 
Here, I want to accept the publication at face value and 
consider future Japanese politics through internal scrutiny of 
Ozawa's assertions. 
<H5>  Assessment of 1955 Setup and Postwar Generation </H5>
  As a premise to this discussion, there must be clarification 
as to the type of problems that existed in postwar Japanese 
politics, particularly in politics under the 1955 setup, and the 
reform courses that are considered necessary. Also, as mentioned 
earlier in relation to Mikuri's comments, I believe that shared, 
rather than confrontational, awareness is stronger between Ozawa 
and me regarding this point. For example, the following section 
of Blueprint for Building a New Japan is practically 
the same as my criticisms of the 1955 setup: 
  "Entrusting the maintenance of international order entirely 
to the United States, Japan concentrated solely on economic 
development and distribution of assets resulting from it. Things 
went smoothly if budget allocations were made as fairly as 
possible, considering opposition parties' demands. Reaching such 
consultative agreements was the essence of politics. There were 
no serious discussions about the path Japan should pursue nor 
truly intense confrontations regarding policies. (Omission). 
Unnoticed, the democratic principle that there should be a 
change between ruling and opposition parties was forgotten and 
the existence of a perennial government party and perpetual 
opposition party was no longer considered strange" (page 65, 
said publication). 
  Regarding such summarization of postwar politics by Ozawa, 
as 
to whether there is agreement or perhaps, reluctant acceptance 
of the statement, or conversely, opposition, I feel that rather 
than differences in individual feelings, differences between 
generations in how they interpret postwar politics begin to 
show. For example, Takeshi Kobo (Nagoya University professor), a 
political scientist born in 1954, states in an outstanding 
article on Ozawa expressing his personal viewpoint, "Can 
Leftists Oppose Ichiro Ozawa?" (monthly periodical JOKYO, 
November 1993): "As a person committed to the reformist or 
leftist side, I have a number of objections to such 
summarization of postwar politics but, ultimately, it is a hard 
fact that the opposition could not alter such a structure so I 
believe that the foregoing generalization must be accepted 
basically." 
<H5>  Disillusioned With Allotted Roles </H5>
  As for myself and my juniors, who were born at about the 
same 
time as the formation of the 1955 setup, we have watched 
consultative politics since our childhood. Those of us who were 
born after the mid-1950's are not directly aware of postwar 
reformist glories, such as the protect-the-Constitution movement 
and the 1960 Security Treaty demonstrations. Also, we haven't 
had the experience of peering at the true nature of political 
movements and power displays through college student uprisings. 
  While harboring various dissatisfactions with real politics, 
we had been greatly frustrated by the absence of a political 
entity to replace the LDP regime. While hoping for political 
reform through changes in government reins, we had been 
expecting the emergence of a reformist force led by the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ). However, upon observing that 
the opposition to administration, which should traditionally be 
an indispensable element in democracy, was nothing more than an 
allotted role, as scripted in the 1955 setup, disillusionment 
with the existing reformist political party only deepened. 
  Generational differences in viewpoints on the role to be 
performed by the reformist force are serious and the differences 
were accentuated suddenly when the coalition regime was formed. 
Evaluation of the coalition regime and assessment of Ozawa's 
awareness of the times are closely related. For those of us born 
in the 1950's who believe the historic roles of the LDP and SDPJ 
have ended, Ozawa's criticism of the 1955 setup might be said to 
have an appeal because of its explicitness. 
<H5>  Structure of Postwar Democracy and Nonuse of Power </H5>
  Ozawa's criticism of consultative politics also thrust upon 
us the issue of political power in postwar democracy that had 
been shelved for a long period. During the days when the 
one-party rule by the LDP was an axiomatic premise, persons 
critical of the LDP followed, though regretfully, the 
stereotyped thinking that those in power were the rascals on the 
other side and that clean, just persons were all opposed to 
power. Neither power nor leadership was a subject taken up 
seriously in postwar political discussions. Of course, the 
framework to protect people's rights is inadequate in Japan and 
the importance of the "freedom-from-power" issue has not 
diminished, but the thinking was never prevalent that laws and 
systems should be altered by having the side which respects 
rights gain the majority or take over the government. 
  On the other hand, the LDP government which had the power 
did 
exercise physical force, at times, to protect the setup but 
generally, rather than settling matters by using power, it took 
steps more often to cajole by saving the honor of the opposing 
side. Politics lost the capability to handle problems with 
entangled interests and the reality that vested rights, once 
acquired, cannot be disposed of in spite of the criticisms of 
numerous citizens is deeply tied to the tradition of postwar 
politics to evade the use of power. To use a phrase that was 
popular in the past, Japanese politics is a hollow structure and 
it is impossible to tell where power resides. 
<H5>  Formulate Plan for Freedom To Gain Power </H5>
  In contrast, Ozawa points out the crime of not using power. 
Also, he proposes reforms in cabinet organization and election 
system to create strong authority and clarify responsibilities. 
As is well known, regarding this point, there are criticisms 
about suppression of minority views and stage setting to achieve 
strong authoritative rule. However, in light of the development 
of Japanese politics which has been tossed about since the 
1980's by foreign pressure such as "input from the flank" 
(Takeshi Sasaki, Tokyo University professor), mentioned in an 
article, and because subjective identification and solution of 
problems had been abandoned, the creation of political 
leadership through the choice of the people themselves has 
become a task of far more importance than ever before, as 
pointed out by Ozawa. In other words, together with freedom from 
power, a concrete plan for "freedom to gain power" is probably 
being sought by the people. 
  In the first place, under the parliamentary cabinet system, 
like in Japan and UK, the majority party in the parliament 
controls the legislature and simultaneously wields the 
administrative power. In other words, the fusion of the two 
powers, legislative and administrative, takes place through the 
ruling party. The basic image of party politics under the 
parliamentary cabinet system is for the party, which took over 
the government reins, to strive for the implementation of 
policies that it pledged to the populace by using its powerful 
authority and for the people to pass judgment at the next 
election and replace the ruling party if its performance is 
found to be unsatisfactory. In that sense, Ozawa's assertion is 
not in any way an irrational argument to support dictatorship. 
  This form of parliamentary cabinet system will not destroy 
democracy only if there are multiple political forces competing 
ceaselessly for power. It is not unreasonable if many 
intellectuals should consider it a nightmare if, within a 
framework of strengthened leadership, the party led by Ozawa 
should continue a lengthy one-party rule as the LDP did. The 
problem is whether there is a political force that can vie for 
governmental power with the party led by Ozawa. Arguments that 
the past system of rivalrous politics or zoku Dietmen politics 
are less harmful than the deployment of Ozawa-style leadership 
will not stand up, at all, against his reform proposal. It is 
the urgent task of those engaged in Japanese politics to propose 
changes through substantive policies and concepts while 
cooperating with the effort to eliminate from political arenas, 
such as the cabinet and Diet, the obstacles which traditionally 
curtailed creativity and responsiveness in Japanese politics. 
<H5>  External Policies and National Model for Japan </H5>
  When envisioning another design to oppose the paradigm 
portrayed by Ozawa, the most significant confrontational point 
is the question of Japan's national image and position in the 
world. Views regarding this point are closely intertwined with 
the question of how the locus of postwar Japan should be 
assessed. Earlier, I stated that I agree with Ozawa's criticisms 
of the 1955 setup, but what becomes a problem is the disparity 
between overall postwar politics and the party politics 
arrangement called the 1955 setup. According to Ozawa, postwar 
Japan was a "special country" which fervently pursued prosperity 
for its own country without hardly bearing any costs for peace 
and freedom and if so, politics under the 1955 setup would be 
the ultimate in special politics suited to a special country. 
  However, it seems that condemning postwar politics in such a 
manner is a one-sided viewpoint. It is a fact that postwar Japan 
was successful in its development because it enjoyed the world's 
public assets without, charge but it is not particularly strange 
for a developing country to be exempted from shouldering the 
costs of international public resources. In the future, Japan 
may have to take the initiative in fulfilling its responsibility 
to provide international support but in that event, it is 
probably necessary to analyze the positive and negative aspects 
of the locus of Japanese development with the intent of 
furnishing a model for succeeding countries. Also, when 
presenting the Japanese experience as a universal model, the 
important factor must not be overlooked that Japan avoided 
spending resources on the military under the postwar 
Constitution and followd the course of a "civilian power" 
(Yoichi Funabashi, ASAHI SHIMBUN's U.S. Bureau chief). It can be 
said that Ozawa's hyperintense irritation with postwar Japan is 
giving the impression to many persons that is trying to 
repudiate all facets of postwar peace. 
<H5>  One-Nation Peace Doctrine and Santa Claus </H5>
  Ozawa will probably refute this by point saying people are 
misinterpreting his arguments. However, upon reading his 
Blueprint for Building a New Japan," one will notice that 
there is a contradiction in his attitude toward the "one-nation 
peace doctrine" that he should be criticizing. On the one hand, 
he is admonishing Japanese who have become accustomed to 
prosperity that "the world is not that generous"; but on the 
other hand, he is saying that maintaining the wealth of Japanese 
is the mission of politics and is making big promises to people 
about tax reductions and public investment increases. The 
one-nation peace doctrine is not a patent of the SDPJ, which had 
been an opposition party, but actually the paradigm built up by 
successive LDP regimes which had exercised national power. Ozawa 
himself had received training as a politican within this 
paradigm. Plans to augment the Shinkansen lines and expressway 
network, which are described in the said publication, are only 
rehash of the "Japanese Archipelago Reconstruction," a plan that 
should be considered bankrupt. Since he is the disciple of 
Kakuei Tanaka, he probably cannot detach himself from the maxim 
of LDP politics since Tanaka that "development is good." 
  If he is claiming that Japan must pay more of the costs of 
world peace and freedom, he should explain carefully to the 
people that politics is not the function of passing out benefits 
freely to various regions and groups in the country. With 
respect to the tax reform bill to reduce income taxes and secure 
public works revenues by increasing the consumption tax rate, he 
has presented plausible estimates. However, for example, if 
running costs, subsequent to the construction of generally 
unprofitable Shinkansen lines and expressways, are to be paid 
for through the citizens' taxes, the burden on the people will 
certainly increase beyond his estimates. To undertake 
international contributions externally and to spread benefits 
internally, like in the archipelago reconstruction scheme, is 
simply following the past LDP's all-inclusive party course of 
currying the favor of all groups. Isn't the strong authority 
sought by Ozawa intended to serve in establishing policy 
priorities clearly and not in enacting the role of a generous 
Santa Claus for all groups? 
  Also, if I were asked what point we should really reflect on 
in postwar politics, I think that the biggest mistake was to 
believe that quantitative expansion of the economy was of utmost 
value and to ruin our country through indiscrimate granting 
common public works, In order to polish the image of postwar 
Japan, the task to reassess the prosperity and development 
course pursued until now will be essential in the search for the 
next political direction. 
<H5>  Changes in Confrontation Over Constitution </H5>
  Assessment of postwar Japan is linked closely to the 
interpretation of the postwar Constitution. Ozawa's contribution 
to the discussions on the Constitution deserves special 
attention. His greatest achievement is the breakdown of the 
pattern that "conservatives are forces for constitutional 
revision" and the presentation of concrete proposals toward 
realization of his concept of the constitutional doctrine. In 
other words, support of the Constitution is no longer the 
exclusive right of the Constitution protection forces and they, 
too, are being pressed to present concrete ideas on how to carry 
out the constitutional principles. In the Blueprint for 
Building a New Japan, the importance of values advocated 
heretofore by progressives, such as respect for individuals and 
decentralization of control, are emphasized so Ozawa should 
probably be regarded as someone who shares the basic principles 
associated with politics, such as human rights and democracy. I 
welcome the fact that from the hardened confrontational pattern 
of pro- and anti-Constitution revision forces under the 1955 
setup, a competitive arena to deal with constitutional 
principles is finally emerging. 
  At a glance, Ozawa's contention appears to be extremely 
universal. In particular, his proposal to maintain a standby UN 
force in Japan and to conduct overseas actions of Japanese armed 
units only under UN supervision is clearly different from the 
policy of expanding externally in pursuit of national interests. 
Actually, a similar idea had already been presented in 1959 in 
the midst of the Cold War by Yoshikazu Sakamoto (presently, an 
associate member of International Christian University's Peace 
Research Institute) in his essay, "Defense Concept for a Neutral 
Japan" (carried in the publication, International Politics 
in the Nuclear Age, by Iwanami Shoten). (There are 
differences between the two parties on the extent to which Japan 
should participate in UN police activities.) There is historic 
irony in the fact that this idea gained reality with the 
collapse of the Cold War structure and, moreover, is being 
presented by the standard bearer of the new conservative party. 
  Thus, it must be recognized that there is a certain logic in 
Ozawa's externally directed thoughts. Therefore, when 
criticizing them, it is unfair to disbelieve what he has stated 
explicity and to denounce his probable intentions by imagining 
what he has not written. To criticize his policies, it is 
essential to carefully consider his situational awareness on 
which his views are premised. 
<H5>  Ozawa Thinks Constitution Is "Commandment" </H5>
  As far as I can tell, Ozawa's perception of the current 
situation is as described below. With respect to nonuse of 
military power in international society, postwar Japan spent 
half a century compliant and confined. However, now that Japan 
has become a great economic power with worldwide influence and 
the possibility of cooperation among the big powers, centered on 
UN, has widened with the end of the Cold War, it is essential 
for Japan to reenter international society by stepping out of 
its confinement and participating in various activities, whether 
military or nonmilitary, in order to "occupy an honorable 
position in international society." Meanwhile, as far as the 
current situation of the international society is concerned, the 
control of the superpowers has loosened with the collapse of the 
Cold War structure and conditions are closer to anarchy than 
heretofore. Therefore, military power is still required to 
resolve conflicts and preserve order. 
  It might be said that for Ozawa, the constitutional 
stipulation of pacifism is only a commandment imposed on Japan, 
which was defeated in World War II, to refrain from using 
military power for national interests. Therefore, there are no 
restrictions, at all, for Japan to participate in military 
activities under the UN flag. 
<H5>  Allegory of the Fall of Carthage </H5>
  The question is whether or not it is correct to apply to the 
constitutional pacifism or demilitarization concept the special 
interpretation that it was a "commandment" imposed on Japan in 
1945. That is related to the assessment of military 
effectiveness in the post-Cold War international society. It 
seems that Ozawa is thoroughly convinced that it is a natural 
state for international society to be ruled by power. For 
example, he draws on the allegory of the fall of Carthage to 
warn the Japanese who are accustomed to peace. "Unlike Venice, 
this country (Carthage) built up its military force with 
mercenaries assembled through unsparing use of its wealth. For 
this reason, it was eventually defeated by the Roman army made 
up mainly of farmers. Carthage had far greater wealth than Rome, 
but the thinking that it could defend the country only with 
money proved fatal" (page 106, Blueprint for Building a 
New Japan). 
  The implication is that the rule of international society in 
the late 20th century has not changed much since the days of 
Rome. The singular change probably noted by Ozawa is that since 
it has become difficult in the late 20th century for any country 
to secure its national safety with only its military force, 
there is an urgent need to establish a joint force with each 
country contributing. 
<H5>  Proof That Power Is Secondary </H5>
  However, it can also be said that this type of thinking, 
which appears at a glance to be realistic, is really overlooking 
the changes in the world. The biggest change is that 
establishment of rules through negotiations between past 
enemies, as shown by the reconciliation between Israel and PLO 
and the abolishment of apartheid in South Africa, has become the 
motivating force to create peace. To guarantee observance of the 
rule, some force might be needed but, in any event, power is 
secondary. 
  Conversely, as shown by the internal wars among African 
nations, peace cannot be secured no matter how the advanced 
countries try to intervene militarily as long as the concerned 
parties want to fight. To put it extremely, for settlement of 
the stalemated regional conflicts, the only solution might be to 
wait for an antiwar feeling to emerge after warring parties get 
tired of fighting like at the time of Germany's Thirty Year War. 
  Also, Japan's ineptness in the Gulf war seems to have left 
deep scars internally in Ozawa, but even in the Gulf war the 
United States was unable to exercise military power to force 
upon Iraq the order that it desired and had to be satisfied with 
the liberation of Kuwait. 
<H5>  Idealism and Realism Twisted </H5>
  As for making peace through negotiations, it can be said 
that, learning from experience, human beings are making progress 
slowly. It can also be said that, as for continuing rapacious 
killings for ethnic and religious reasons, human beings have not 
made any progress. In either case, the effectiveness of military 
power as a means to resolve conflicts has been diminishing with 
the passage of time. In that sense, the demilitarization concept 
of the Constitution is pointing the direction that times should 
follow. That is definitely not a commandment that Japan, blamed 
for an aggressive war, had accepted reluctantly. 
  The thinking that international cooperation based on good 
intentions will build peace was called an unrealistic dream in 
the past by conservatives. However, looking at the world today, 
one will realize that sustainable peace will emerge only though 
such a process. In that sense, it is important to maintain 
idealism. However, in the case of Ozawa, his overoptimism that 
use of military power, based on international cooperation, will 
create freedom and peace is a matter of concern. One should be 
cautious that a "peace creation strategy," based on good 
intentions, might bring about unintended results. It is not 
certain whether Ozawa's concept, which delved into the military 
sphere of national security, will truly lead to the creation of 
peace. 
<H5>  What Is an Ordinary Country? </H5>
  According to Ozawa, international society is still in a 
natural state and Japan should become an ordinary member of 
international society, bearing responsibility for security by 
arms. The symbol of an ordinary country has an attractive ring 
to people who are dissatisfied that Japan only accumulates 
wealth and does not gain any respect from international society. 
The will to despise fanatical devotion to money is important, 
but the question that must be considered is what constitutes 
ordinariness. 
  Actually, in a changing world society, it is not clear what 
can be regarded as ordinary. Of course, no matter how 
enthusiastic he is about military contributions, Ozawa must not 
be considering military superpowers, such as the United States 
or PRC, as the ordinary countries he is aiming for. Then, are 
countries like UK and France, which are permanent members of the 
UN Security Council, possess nuclear power, and conduct skilled 
diplomacy, to be considered as ordinary? Or, are countries like 
Sweden and Canada, called the middle powers, which participate 
in UN policing actions but maintain a certain distance from the 
military strategies of superpowers and contribute to peace, the 
ordinary countries? Or, are countries like India and Brazil, 
which wield strong political and military influence in their 
respective regions, the ordinary countries? 
<H5>  Solution Not Found To Resolving Complicated Conflicts </H5>
  In Ozawa's vocabulary, an ordinary country means a country 
which shares costs necessary to provide international support, 
including military assistance, but the extent of participation 
in contributing support in the area of military power differs 
greatly with countries. In ways to participate, there is no 
single formula or a simple "ordinary" way; many countries are 
participating through various means. You cannot say that, 
because a country took the lead and participated in a 
large-scale armed intervention, like in the Gulf war, it is 
ordinary. In fact, the views of many researchers are in 
agreement that the scenario of obvious aggression followed by 
the simple act of subjugating villains, as in the Gulf war, is 
not likely to occur frequently in the future. How to cope with 
much more complicated regional conflicts is still an unsolved 
question. UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's plan for a 
peacekeeping force, which is believed to have influenced Ozawa's 
"peace creation strategy," is not likely to be implemented 
smoothly, as shown by the Somalia case. 
  There is widespread public agreement that Japan should play 
a 
bigger role in solving conflicts in various parts of the world 
and in eliminating hunger and poverty. Also, it seems that 
arguments are strengthening in politics to move toward approval 
of Japanese participation in UN police actions when those 
engaged in conflicts desire peace and try to establish an 
orderly framework through negotiations. I believe that what is 
essential now in discussions on foreign policies is the 
clarification of Japan's independent stance regarding provision 
of international support, particularly the setting of a ceiling 
on commitment to military forces. The term, "ordinary country," 
is still a vague symbol and many persons naturally fear that 
Japan would be dragged into a quagmire of military interventions 
when they hear the term. 
<H5>  Political Reorganization and Formation of Anti-Ozawa Forces </H5>
  By the time this article is published, the issue of the 
political reform bill would probably have been settled. 
Regardless of the outcome of the political reform bill, looking 
at the hard feelings created among the political parties during 
deliberations on the bill, I think it is certain that Japanese 
politics will move toward the second round of reorganization. 
When that happens, the ruling parties which make up the 
coalition regime will probably be unable to unite. The SDPJ will 
be split, the LDP will also be wavering, and the groping toward 
a new political party will continue for a while. In that 
process, it appears certain that the group comprised of 
Shinseito, led by Ozawa, and Komeito will take the initiative. 
In the media and press, comments are made often that there is 
fear Ozawa and Taisaku Ikeda would grasp the power in Japan. 
However, to think that a united Shinseito-Komeito force can 
establish a stable one-party rule like the LDP in the past is an 
overestimation of Ozawa. It might be said that Ozawa's power is 
growing even more because journalists and scholars overrate him 
and fear him for no reason. 
  Ozawa is undoubtedly an outstanding theorist, but his 
excellence is best shown in his bold criticisms of and disregard 
for the common sense and long standing rules of the special 
political circle called Nagata-cho. Therefore, those who are 
most knowledgeable about his excellence are politicians in the 
circle, reporters of political departments that act as the 
circle's organ, and scholars who conduct studies of the circle. 
For the general populace which is unfamiliar with the internal 
conditions of politics, he appears as an interesting or 
dangerous politician who attacks the old framework recklessly 
and creates disturbances. 
  When he uses "strong-arm tactics," Nagata-cho insiders stand 
in fear, but the average citizen ignores him with unexpected 
coolness as during the 1991 Tokyo gubernatorial election. 
Perhaps his justification for trying to destroy the old order is 
not understood by the people. Although he was able to clear 
himself of suspicion in the publicized general contractor 
scandal, because of the "undefinable nature" that Ozawa has, the 
possibility remains that the Ozawa group might become, in 
political terms, a "denial party" (a party from which even 
citizens who are not interested in politics want to deny votes). 
To avoid that, he must polish the national image that he is 
aiming for; to evade the criticism that his acts belie his 
words, he must present specific policies to materialize the 
values of personal freedom and independence. 
  In any event, our task as we approach the 21st century is to 
form a political force which can present a vision and national 
image to counter his ordinary country and to create the 
competition for governmental power.

  [Text] The U.S. Boeing Company has become a hopeful 
candidate for partnership in the joint development project for 
the next-generation small civilian airplane (YSX) being 
undertaken by the Japanese Government and the private sector. 
This was disclosed by an informed source on 21 April. In the 
beginning, Boeing showed little interest in the YSX project 
because it manufactures large and medium airplanes such as jumbo 
jets, not small aircraft. However, due to a worldwide slump in 
the aviation industry, Boeing changed its attitude and decided 
to participate in the project. Japan, which so far has promoted 
negotiations mostly with European companies, also made changes 
in its original plan, such as a slight increase in the number of 
seats and the utilization of parts used in Boeing's existing 
aircraft. Japan is also studying the possibility of taking 
advantage of Boeing's global sales capability. 
  In the YSX project, Japan aims to engage in independent 
development of small passenger airplanes (with 50 to 100 seats) 
as the aircraft to replace the YS-11. If Japan engages in a 
joint project with Boeing, the number of seats will be increased 
to approximately 90 from the original 75, and the YSX will be 
equipped with the same equipment and parts as those of the 
Boeing 737 (with 108 seats) which is currently in service. 
Identical cockpit designs will reduce the burden of training 
pilots, making it easier for existing Boeing customers to 
purchase the YSX. 
  Japan had also been promoting another development project 
for 
a medium aircraft with 150 seats (YXX) in cooperation with 
Boeing. However, the project has been suspended since last June 
after Boeing announced it would give priority to the remodeling 
of existing aircraft. The two projects will be virtually 
integrated into one by enlarging the size of the aircraft to be 
developed under the YSX project. 
  With regard to the production of the improved Boeing 737, 
which will replace the YXX project, those Boeing subcontractors 
engaged in parts production strongly opposed the participation 
of Japanese aircraft manufacturers.

  [Text] On 15 April, Nippon Idotsushin (IDO) will launch a 
dedicated team to promote the sale of Motorola cellular phones. 
As a response to the recent agreement emanating from friction 
concerning cellular phones, IDO will invest about 60 billion yen 
to expand the service area and accelerate signing of new 
subscribers to provide for early recovery of its investment in 
the Motorola system. IDO expects to enlist about 120,000 
subscribers within the fiscal year. By expanding the service 
area and emphasizing the Motorola system, it hopes to compete 
more effectively with NTT's mobile communication network called 
NTT Dokomo [Anywhere] and to prevent recurrence of Japan-U.S. 
friction. 
  The dedicated team will be established as the Fourth Sales 
Section within the Sales Department. It will be initially 
staffed with eight individuals. Since it does not have any 
company-owned direct sales outlets, IDO will set up dealers that 
specialize in Motorola cellular phones and provide sales support 
to distributors. 
  In the past, IDO had established the First, Second and Third 
Sales Sections under the Sales Department and had provided sales 
support to dealers which handled both NTT and Motorola cellular 
phones. However, now IDO sources say, "If we approach the sales 
effort for both rival NTT's Dokomo and Motorola systems in the 
same way, there is little prospect of improving sales of 
Motorola units." But, now that capital investments in the 
Motorola system have been expanded as a result of the agreement, 
IDO has decided to place emphasis on the promotion of Motorola 
units. 
  In conjunction with the outright sale of cellular phones 
which began in April, IDO as an operator of communications 
systems will stock a maximum of 11 models of cellular phones and 
provide that eight of them will be applicable to the Motorola 
system. It will thus position the Motorola system strategically 
in the competition to increase its subscriber share in the 
market place. 
  As a follow-on to the Japan-U.S. agreement on cellular 
phones, IDO will invest about 60 billion yen to expand its base 
stations for the Motorola system and reassign some of the 
frequencies currently used on the NTT system to the Motorola 
system by the end of September 1995. Further, the operating plan 
submitted by IDO to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications 
contains a passage which states, "We will install a dedicated 
sales organization to promote the Motorola system." 
  IDO subscribers to the Motorola system as of 31 March 1994 
totaled about 22,000. This figure is far behind the 310,000 IDO 
subscribers for the NTT system, but is close to three times the 
number existing at the same time last year.

  [Text] Kumamoto--On the 18th, the Kyushu branch of Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) will launch a "Multimedia 
Promotion Committee" to develop data communications services 
using multimedia technology. It will make strategic capital 
investments to build the Kyushu Information Infrastructure (KII) 
and will engage in joint ventures in various experiments and 
commercialization of multimedia systems with local autonomous 
governments which exercise a strong interest in such systems. 
  The committee is chaired by branch vice president Shigeaki 
Mihara and includes 20 members occupying department head 
positions. In the area of hardware, efforts will be concentrated 
on the the conversion of the communication network to optical 
technology to include installation of optical fiber cables at 
subscriber facilities. Special emphasis will be placed on the 
early conversion to optical technology of trunk lines servicing 
urban area subscribers. Installation of personal handy phone 
services will also to considered. 
  KII envisions the construction of a multimedia communication 
infrastructure and the conduct of training in the operation of 
the systems in a joint effort with local autonomous governments. 
Various projects underway in Kyushu which are aimed at the early 
installation of multimedia systems include the Fukuoka City 
Seaside, Kita Kyushu City Human Media Park, Oita City Hyper 
Network, and Kumamoto Prefecture multimedia regional cooperative 
experiments being conducted in Kumamoto city.

  [Text] The domestic market for batteries is expected to 
reach 480 billion yen in fiscal year 1993, including 200 billion 
yen for nonrechargeable batteries and 280 billion yen for 
rechargeable batteries inclusive of automotive batteries. Future 
demand for rechargeable batteries is expected to grow 2.5-fold 
by the early 2000's to an annual sales rate of 700 billion yen 
primarily because of lithium ion batteries to be shipped to 
information communications markets. 
  According to Sanyo Electric, the reason why the electrical 
equipment makers have positioned lithium ion batteries as "equal 
to a second liquid-crystal device" and have launched full-scale 
mass production is not only that growth in sales is expected, 
but because such batteries are a key device in controlling the 
operation of portable computer terminals playing a critical role 
in multimedia systems. Already, advances have been made in the 
miniaturization, reduction in weight and adaptation of cordless 
versions of electrical equipment such as cellular phones, and 
the usable time in settings such as outdoors before recharge of 
such batteries determines the success or failure of marketing 
efforts. 
  Overseas makers are still in the development stage for 
lithium ion batteries and since supply sources for such 
batteries is expected to be limited to Japanese companies for 
the foreseeable future, reports indicate inquiries for possible 
future orders are increasing at such companies as Sony from 
companies engaged in the development of multimedia hardware such 
as IBM and Apple Computer. In response, various domestic firms 
are expected to strategically position lithium ion batteries on 
a level paralleling liquid crystal displays and devote resources 
to the development of high-capacity, next-generation batteries. 
  It takes one to two years for office automation and 
communications equipment makers to reach a decision on new 
equipment application of new types of sample power sources 
furnished by battery suppliers. The decision for Sanyo 
Electric's announcement, in the face of plans by Sony and AT 
Battery to expand production capacity and announcements by 
Matsushita Electrical Industries and Nippon Battery to produce 
lithium ion batteries, was based on the judgment that failure to 
make an announcement in fiscal year 1994 would make it 
impossible for Sanyo to compete effectively for market share in 
the area of portable computer terminals used in multimedia 
systems. 
  Sanyo Electric President Yasuaki Takano states, "Sanyo will 
aggressively invest in the expansion of its lithium ion battery 
operations in order to strengthen its position as a top maker of 
batteries such as the nickel cadmium type." 
  Lithium ion batteries have been considered the 
high-capacity, 
next-generation battery, but the industry is positioning fiscal 
year 1994 as the "first year of commercialization" and has 
embarked on development and production competitions to win 
customers.

  [Text] Outright sales of cellular phones were initiated in 
Shizuoka Prefecture in April amidst lively competition between 
NTT's Tokai Mobile Network (NTT Dokomo [Anywhere]) using digital 
technology and Nippon Ido Tsushin (IDO) using Motorola's TACS 
[total access communications system] technology. NTT Dokomo 
systems are being promoted in terms of the applicability of 
digital technology in the multimedia age, while the IDO Motorola 
cellular units are being promoted based on instrument variety 
and low price. Between this summer and next spring, two more 
digital-based companies are scheduled to enter the market, 
sharply increasing interest in cellular phones in Shizuoka 
prefecture. 
  Yotaro Hoshiyama, director of NTT Dokomo's Shizuoka regional 
office, displays enthusiasm as he says, "We intend to 
aggressively stress the value-added aspects of digital 
technology in that it is applicable to personal computer 
communications." Connections for NTT Kodomo's digital services 
network were completed in April for the northern Kanto, Tokyo 
metropolitan, Tokai and Kansai areas. 
  Intraprefectural calling areas are now restricted to 
Gotenba, 
Numazu, Shizuoka, and Hamamatsu along the Tomei Freeway, which 
is smaller than the area covered by analog systems, but it will 
be extended to urban areas surrounding Hamamatsu and urban areas 
of East Izu during fiscal year 1994. Director Hoshiyama states 
that the digital network is being expanded beyond the areas 
covered by the analogue system to "accommodate requirements of 
urban area residents who have a frequent need to use cellular 
phones while traveling on business or pleasure in the Shizuoka 
area." 
  The reason NTT Dokomo is emphasizing digital technology is 
that it can be connected to communication services using 
integrated services digital network (ISDN) being installed by 
the NTT group, while cellular phones will be one phase of an 
overall high-technology communications network. 
  However, of the cellular phone orders received in the first 
10 days of April, only 10 percent were for those using digital 
technology. According to director Hoshiyama, "We need to suggest 
effective uses of the technology to business firms," reflecting 
the intent to continue with efforts in expanding use of the 
technology. 
  On the other hand, IDO has expanded its analog network, 
which 
was the topic of U.S.-Japan friction, in Shizuoka Prefecture. 
Shizuoka branch manager Tetsuji Nomura stresses, "Motorola 
cellulars can be used any place in the country by connecting to 
the Cellular Group. There are eight different models available 
in terms of cellular phones and they are about 30,000 yen 
cheaper than digital models." He is poised to compete head-on 
with digital systems whose service areas are now limited to 
Kanto and Kansai areas and whose cellular units are priced 
higher. 
  IDO handles NTT analogue cellulars too, but manager Nomura 
states, "We will sell the Motorola units aggressively in the 
future." IDO's subscribers now total about 300,000 for the NTT 
system and about 10,000 for the Motorola system, but manager 
Nomura expresses determination as he says, "We hope to bring 
market shares to a 50-50 point in two years." 
  New marketers of the digital system are preparing to enter 
the foray. Two-Car Cellular Tokai of Nagoya city which is 
scheduled to start operation in July, established branches in 
Shizuoka and Hamamatsu cities at the end of March. It will also 
appoint more than 30 dealerships which will serve as the direct 
outlets to customers by the end of April. 
  Tokai Digitalphone of Nagoya city plans to commence services 
in Shizuoka prefecture by the first part of the spring of next 
year, while positioning its Shizuoka branch to begin sales by 
June 1994. 
  As of the end of 1993, about 49,000 cellular phones were in 
service in Shizuoka Prefecture. Market penetration stood at 1.3 
percent, which was 0.3 percent lower than the national average. 
The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications estimates that the 
units installed will increase sixfold by 2002, which means that 
there is room for additional market participants. Late market 
entrants have received approval for lower initial installation 
rates than for NTT's digital rates and, as a result, 
optimistically look for initial year new subscriber market share 
of 33 percent in the case of Two-Car Cellular and 25 percent in 
the case of Digitalphone. 
  According to the Shizuoka branch, IDO, whose market share is 
running at 30 percent, is determined to take the initiative in 
waging a successful sales campaign as sources say, "We hope to 
corral as many new subscribers as possible before the new 
competition comes on stream." The same source states, "Since 
entering April the number of potential customers visiting the 
sales offices have doubled to 50 a day," indicating a favorable 
market trend. 
  According to the NTT Shizuoka branch, "Since March, 70 
percent of the visitors to the sales offices have asked about 
cellular services. There has been a definite increase in the 
interest shown for cellular phones. According to IDO sources, 
"Customers that appear at sales offices also have catalogues 
from other vendors." It appears that users are being careful in 
their evaluation of services available. Sales of cellular units 
are not expected to take off until after summer, because it is 
difficult to predict just how much prices will be falling in the 
near future.

  [Text] It was learned on 23 April that the banking 
industry presented to the Ministry of Finance [MOF] a list of 57 
deregulations, including its main demand to create deposits 
linked to stock prices and a demand for simplification of 
reports submitted to the MOF. 
  Wide-ranging demands are included in the list, such as: 
relaxation of regulations on large lendings, lifting of the ban 
on new financial services such as FRA's (forward rate 
agreements), and relaxation of regulations on opening new branch 
offices. The banks are asking for greater autonomous 
decisionmaking power in bank management since they are facing 
intensified competition with the liberalization of interest 
rates. There has also been an upsurge of international demands 
on Japan to relax regulations. Therefore, the MOF is taking a 
positive attitude towards the banks' demands. This will 
probably contribute to a transformation of bank management, 
which has been strictly regulated. 
  The list of deregulation demands was compiled mainly by the 
major city banks. It includes items in 13 areas, such as bank 
deposits and regulations on branch offices and affiliated 
companies, plus a demand for simplifying reports to the MOF. 
Since the process of liberalizing interest rates for bank 
accounts will be completed by October, the banks are asking for 
liberalization of regulations concerning matters other than 
interest rates. This is the first time the banking sector has 
asked for such wide-ranging deregulation. 
  The main feature of the list is the creation of deposits 
linked to stock prices, which offer to depositors gains 
corresponding to stock price increases, and no interest at all 
if stock prices go down. 
  Apart from deposits linked to stock prices, the banks are 
also asking the MOF to lift the ban on new types of deposits 
which allow interest earnings to be invested in market 
commodities, such as deposits linked to the land price index. 
The banking sector aims at expanding its range of financial 
services. 
  The banks are also asking for the abolition of regulations 
on 
opening branch offices--not more than two regular branches, or 
not more than seven small branches in two years--which has been 
the mainstay of bank regulations. With regard to CD's (cash 
dispensers) set up at client institutions, the abolition of the 
regulation on the location of such cash dispensers is also being 
demanded. A total of 11 demands have been presented on the 
opening of branch offices alone. 
  In the area of hi-tech financial services which may become a 
major source of income for banks, the list includes demands to 
lift the ban on handling FRA's, which is a form of commodity 
futures, and FXA's (foreign exchange agreements). The banks are 
also asking for a lifting of the ban on the loan participation 
method of loan liquidation, which does not require the consent 
of the debtor in transferring credit rights, and the ban on the 
method of transferring credit rights to a special-purpose 
corporation which in turn issues CP (commerical paper).

  [Text] Asia is about to become the second-largest market 
for loans from Japanese banks after North America. The reason is 
that loans to governments, businesses, and projects have 
increased sharply. According to international financial sources, 
loan balances of Japanese banks stratified by region indicate 
that, as of the end of 1993, they stood at about 25 percent for 
Asia, rising substantially from the 19 percent at the end of 
1990. Loans to Europe dropped from 32 percent to 27 percent. 
Capital requirements in China and Southeast Asia for the 
construction of social-manufacturing infrastructure have 
increased and the higher yen has encouraged the continuing 
exodus of Japanese bank clients' operations to Asia, signaling a 
situation in which loan balances for Asia will exceed those of 
Europe sometime during fiscal year 1994. 
  Loans outstanding at branches of principal Japanese banks, 
including city banks, long-term credit banks, trust banks, and 
leading regional banks were highest for North America, 
comprising about 40 percent since 1990. In contrast, 
recessionary conditions and businesses' actions to reduce debt 
combined to effect a gradual reduction in the share of European 
loan balances in comparison to the sharp increase in loans to 
Asia. 
  Among individual leading Japanese banks, overseas loans 
outstanding at Mitsubishi Bank converted to U.S. dollars as of 
February were 35 percent each for both Asia and Europe, while 
Sanwa Bank reveals that "Loans outstanding to Asia are nearing 
the balance outstanding for Europe." Among leading city banks, 
growth at some banks in fiscal year 1992 of three percent grew 
sharply by a rate of over 10 percent for the 12-month period of 
fiscal year 1993 alone. 
  In the case of Japanese banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank 
officials 
say, Asian regional loans "are not large on an individual case 
basis, but margins are higher than in the United States and 
Europe, leading to higher profitability." Recently, major 
project loans have been noticeable for such items as petroleum 
refinery construction projects in Thailand. Sources at Bank of 
Tokyo provide the assessment that, "If the role of financial 
adviser to large projects can be acquired, such appointments can 
lead not only to the handling of loans, but to work including 
underwriting of securities and acquisition of settlement 
accounts, providing for expansion of profit-making 
opportunities." Arrangements of that nature enable leading banks 
to participate in corporate operations beginning with the 
initial stages of business planning to actual operation of the 
businesses. 
  Leading Japanese banks have already established their 
overseas lending programs for fiscal year 1994. Sakura Bank 
expects to increase loans outstanding to North America by 3 
percent, while increasing the balance for Asia by 7-8 percent.

  [Text] The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has announced that the 
number of new overseas branches of financial institutions to be 
preliminarily approved for the second half of fiscal year 1993 
will be a total of six for six financial institutions including 
the Sumitomo Trust Bank. The MOF has imposed strict review 
criteria and limited the establishment of new overseas branches 
in order to give priority to the restructuring of financial 
institutions carrying bad loans. It approved new branches in 
China and Hong Kong, clearly reflecting a trend to place 
importance on Asia where a higher growth rate is expected than 
in Europe and the United States. 
  Banks, as a matter of principle, must obtain preliminary 
approval of the MOF when establishing branch offices or banks 
overseas. An application covering country, city, and other data 
is submitted to the MOF, which then issues a preliminary 
approval to be followed by work on the details such as when the 
overseas operations will commence. Once preliminary approval is 
granted, it takes six months to one year to actually commence 
operations. 
  Recent preliminary approvals covered branches in Shanghai 
for 
Sumitomo Trust Bank, Hokuriku Bank, Iyo Bank, and Shinwa Bank; 
in Dalian for Fukuoka City Bank; and in Hong Kong for Aomori 
Bank. Fukuoka City Bank states, "We wish to make Dalian the 
center for our operations in China," and will proceed with 
detailed planning once a feasibility study is completed. Among 
regional banks, the Juroku Bank and Nishi-Nippon Bank already 
have branches in Shanghai and the Yamaguchi Bank has a branch in 
Dalian. It can be said that the boom in opening banks in China 
has spread from city banks to regional banks. 
  On the other hand, opening of branches in Hong Kong by city 
banks, long-term credit banks and trust banks has been completed 
and it appears that the future will witness the opening of 
branches by regional banks and second regional banks. 
  Preliminary approvals issued for overseas branches of banks 
on a yearly basis included 86 in fiscal year 1989 and 80 in 
fiscal year 1990 at high levels, but fell sharply to 28 in 
fiscal year 1991 and 31 in fiscal year 1992. In fiscal year 
1993, there were 16 approvals in the first half and six in the 
second half for a total of 22. 
  As part of second half fiscal year 1993 applications, some 
long-term credit banks and others had asked for approval of 
branches in Hanoi, but they have been held in abeyance. The MOF 
has assumed a cautious attitude in regard to opening of new 
overseas branches and banks have begun to restrain applications 
for new branches.

  [Text] Although in a declining trend in recent days, 
long-term interest rates have been rising since the beginning of 
the year. Frequent concern has been voiced that the trend may 
delay the economic recovery. 
  However, such views are wrong. The reason is that the cause 
of rising interest rates is based on the expansion of government 
spending as part of the comprehensive economic package. Even if 
the effects of expanded effective demand based on government 
spending are erased by rising interest rates, we should not 
experience additional negative effects. 
  In reality, it is not unusual for government spending to 
cause a rise in interest rates. In fact, that phenomenon 
conforms with the theory of macroeconomics. In closed economies 
which shut off transactions with outside economies, rising 
interest rates lead to constraints on private-sector investments 
and, as a result, the effects of effective demand created by 
government spending is erased. This phenomenon is called 
"crowding out." 
  In open economies such as that of Japan where capital 
transactions with foreign nations are unregulated, rising 
interest rates, assuming unchanging interest rates in other 
nations, causes an inflow of capital. This causes Japan's 
currency to rise in value and for a shrinkage of international 
payments surpluses. In other words, the crowding out of foreign 
demand results in erasure of the effects of effective demand 
expansion based on government spending. 
  There is the possibility that actual trends will not follow 
this scenario because U.S. interest rates are rising sharply 
during this cycle, although there will be the effect that the 
yen will rise if Japan does not expand its government spending. 
  However, during spring of 1993, the situation developed 
along 
the lines of the above theory. First, under the comprehensive 
economic package a conspicuous increase in public works 
investments was implemented from the fall of 1992. Increases of 
3.4 percent and 7.0 percent were recorded in the third and 
fourth quarters of fiscal year 1992 over the same periods the 
prior year. During that period those increases were in sharp 
contrast with negative growth in private-sector investments. 
However, long-term interest rates began to rise in February and 
the value of the yen rose in foreign exchange markets. And, the 
international payments surplus shrank substantially by 27.1 
percent in the first quarter of fiscal year 1993 below the same 
period in 1992. Gross domestic product showed negative growth 
during the period. 
  Thus, in those economies where interest rates float freely, 
government spending increases do not have an expansionary effect 
on the economy. Accordingly, there is no significance in 
expanding government spending for the sake of economic measures, 
while the same can be said of cuts in income taxes. 
  However, this is not to say that expansions in government 
spending are unnecessary. The reason is that shrinkage of the 
international balance of payments surpluses translates into the 
diversion of capital from overseas investments to domestic 
capital formation, especially social capital formation. Looking 
at the situation in Japan today, such a trend is desirable. 
  The reason for that statement is that Japan's social capital 
is in such a miserable condition. This can be said most aptly in 
terms of social capital governing lifestyles in urban areas. 
Sewer systems, road systems, and neighborhood parks are 
inadequate, while commuter trains provide conditions which are 
basically inhuman. Fortunately, Japan today has the 
macroeconomic resources to invest in such areas. The reason for 
that is that the savings rate is high, which is exemplified by 
none other than the international payments surpluses. 
  Aging of the population will lead to the rapid decline in 
those favorable conditions. It is our responsibility in relation 
to future generations to improve social capital and leave a 
legacy of quality assets, while the savings rates are still high.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Akio Fujii] </F>
  [Text] On the 18th, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board (FRB) 
implemented its third money-tightening measure. These rapid 
tightening measures were taken in just the two and a half months 
since February. And, again FRB Chairman Greenspan issued a 
"monetary tightening" statement concurrent with the tightening 
action. The first two measures were announced following policy 
decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) composed 
of FRB directors and FRB regional presidents, but the third 
money-tightening measure did not have any direct participation 
by the FOMC. It appears that the FRB is taking the approach of 
publicly disclosing policy changes regardless of whether an FOMC 
session is involved. 
  There are various views on why the FRB has adopted the 
approach of publicly disclosing policy at the time 
money-tightening measures are taken. First is the "Congressional 
consideration" view which gave consideration for the heightening 
demand in Congress for the immediate public announcement of 
monetary policy when a decision is made. Second is the "market 
consideration" view calling for the necessity to explain FRB 
intent in words rather than through market operations so as to 
prevent excessive stock market reactions to precautioonary 
money-tightening measures. Third is the "central bank authority" 
view to strongly demonstrate the autonomy of the FRB in relation 
to the government on monetary policy. Whether just one of these 
reasons or several reasons apply is unclear, but it is 
definitely a case where FRB policy approach has changed 
substantially in connection with the recent money-tightening 
measures when compared to past practice. 
  We now hear vociferous debate on potential successors for 
Bank of Japan (BOJ) President Mieno, whose tenure will expire at 
the end of the year. President Mieno cites as qualifications of 
a successor president an "individual who can discharge the 
duties of the central bank." One might say that I am premature 
in view of the debate being held on whether the recession has 
bottomed out, but if one were to lay out the issue facing the 
next BOJ president, it might be the "timely conversion to a 
money-tightening stance." 
  During the question-and-answer phase after a speech given at 
the Foreign Correspondents Club, President Mieno on the 19th 
stated in reference to monetary policy during the bubble 
economy, "Interest rates were raised in the late stages of the 
bubble and as a result the actions were untimely," indicating 
that lessons were learned from the fact that countermeasures 
against asset inflation were untimely as the result of placing 
too much emphasis on traditional commodity price indices such as 
consumer prices. There were times such as in connection with the 
1987 Black Monday when there was no choice but to delay 
monetary-tightening measures for fear of adversely affecting 
stock markets in Japan, the United States, and Europe, but the 
perception is strong even within the BOJ that there were some 
oversights in policy matters in the latter stages of the bubble. 
  In general, in the area of monetary policy, since the 
government basically welcomes monetary easing, little friction 
exists between the central bank and the government. Problems 
arise in the monetary tightening phase and tension between the 
government and central bank rises easily, especially during 
changes from easing to tightening phases. When and how smoothly 
he implements the next tightening move will be the foremost 
highlight of the next BOJ president's monetary policies. 
  FRB Chairman Greenspan was faced with the same issue before 
Japan was. In response, he has said, "I will assume a policy 
encompassing a public disclosure approach," and has placed that 
approach in practice. It may be premature to evaluate whether 
this approach was the right one, but the FRB has certainly 
demonstrated a clear-cut position. 
  In contrast, has the BOJ prepared itself for the upcoming 
contingencies? First, the current BOJ process of making monetary 
policy decisions and handling public announcements is obscure. 
When it comes to market interest rate adjustments, it says 
nothing except to say, "Please look at the daily adjustments 
reflected in the markets." Even if they decide to say something, 
it happens in the form of a BOJ press conference where a change 
in interest adjustment policy is acknowledged several weeks 
after implementation. 
  Further, although the official discount rate is, in 
principle, set at the BOJ Policy Committee, in reality, it 
undergoes quick approval at a "general meeting," but prior 
approval during roundtable discussions of the board of directors 
and coordination with the Ministry of Finance [MOF]. The minutes 
of the BOJ Policy Committee are eventually published in summary 
format, but the nature and contents of debate leading to the 
policy decisions are not disclosed. The proceedings are 
structured so that only privileged insiders are privy to the 
monetary policy decisionmaking process. 
  Although MOF support is usually extended to the BOJ during 
monetary easing periods, that is not always the case during 
monetary tightening phases. There are times when monetary 
tightening must be undertaken, even when such action is contrary 
to the wishes of the government. I believe such situations 
should be handled in a manner so that BOJ intentions and 
contents of decision are promptly made public without the risk 
of misunderstandings.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikkei reporter Ryushiro Kodaira] </F>
  [Text] The foundation below the Japanese capital markets is 
disintegrating. Chinese businesses in need of capital are being 
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, while the Foreign 
Department of the Tokyo Stock Exchange witnesses a continuing 
withdrawal of European and U.S. listings. Fiscal year 1994 
issues of yen-denominated foreign bonds (Samurai) bonds are 
expected to drop in half. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is now 
suffering from the combined impact of belated action on 
deregulation and lack of adequate fundamental rules on investor 
risks. The Japanese stock market now stands at a crucial point, 
where it may continue as one wing of principal world markets or 
decay into the status of a regional market. 
  President Minoru Nagaoka of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, whose 
term of office will expire in one month on 25 May, spoke quietly 
as he said, "I should have foreseen changes in the Asian 
continent earlier. That is my one point of disappointment." 
  Asian businesses are now in the midst of privatizing and 
undergoing a boom in initial public offerings. Twenty-two 
Chinese businesses are expected to list on foreign markets and 
four firms, including Huanai International Electrical Power 
Development Company, will list on the New York Stock Exchange by 
the end of this year. China Securities Surveillance and Control 
Commission President Liu Hongru declares, "European and U.S. 
stock markets will play an important role in the growth of the 
Chinese economy." He even suggests a substantial affiliation 
with European and U.S. securities surveillance authorities and 
securities exchanges to include the exchange of information. He 
does not mention "Japan" or "Tokyo" in his statements. 
  As far as the Tokyo Stock Exchange is concerned, two teams 
composed of two persons each were dispatched in March 1994 for 
about 20 days, but this represented only an initial approach to 
Asian markets. The exchange has just recently begun to consider 
relaxation in listing standards such as net asset requirements 
for admission of small capital Asian firms, a measure already 
implemented in Europe and the United States. A source with Nikko 
Securities' International Planning Department laments, "We would 
like to handle Asian firms but the system for such accommodation 
is yet to be established." 
  Eastman Kodak's Japan specialist whose firm applied for 
delisting from the Foreign Division of the Tokyo Stock Exchange 
in March of this year says, "We came to the conclusion that 
listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was too costly relative to 
benefits gained, amidst the worldwide restructuring of the 
firm." Eastman Kodak's annual cost for maintaining its listing 
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was 13 million yen. This was below 
the average cost of listing with the Foreign Department of 20 
million yen per year because it was translating its annual 
report in summary format. Even then, with only 1,483 Japanese 
shareholders, continued listing could not be justified. 
  The Securities Transactions Law requires that foreign firms 
whose stocks are publicly traded in Japan must submit securities 
reports and annual reports in Japanese. Since charges include 
translation costs, fees to maintain listings are about eight 
times those charged at other foreign exchanges. Financings, such 
as secondary offerings, require the submission of a prospectus 
in Japanese. 
  The complexity of the system is shunned and secondary 
offerings after initial listing have been limited to five cases 
and a total value of 82.9 billion yen. In the 1990's, only one 
case was handled. When four firms including Kodak delist at the 
end of June, the total number of foreign firms listed with the 
Tokyo Stock Exchange's Foreign Department will be 98, less than 
100. 
  Withdrawals from Japan are not limited to firms listed with 
the Foreign Department. 
  In March, Republic of Turkey bonds were downgraded to a BB 
rating by Moody's, bringing them into violation of Japanese bond 
listing standards of "BBB or higher." In fiscal year 1993, 
Turkey issued 215 billion yen of Samurai bonds in six phases, 
but faces a high probability that it will not be able to issue 
bonds in fiscal year 1994. The Greek central bank issued 10 
billion yen in bonds in two phases, but its ratings are 
currently under review and they now face difficulty in issuing 
additional Samurai bonds. 
  The Samurai bond market has been ridiculed as a "junk 
market" 
because of the prevalence of BBB-rated bonds, but even then 
disappointment is being expressed concerning the departure of 
preferred clients of that market place. The flip side of this 
situation according to sources at a major securities firm is 
that "the Samurai market will wither" if the likes of Turkey 
cease to issue such bonds. Already, issuers of AAA-rated bonds 
have shunned the poor marketability of bonds in the Samurai 
market and are shifting to an emphasis on global and Eurobonds 
in raising new capital. There is a strong probability that 
Samurai bond issues in fiscal year 1994 will fall to about 600 
billion yen, one-half of last year's level. 
  Underwriters at Credit Suisse First Boston brag, "Businesses 
of any kind or size can raise capital in U.S. capital markets." 
Initially, super-long-term 50-year bonds or special-feature 
bonds are issued for private placement with such parties as 
institutions. Next, companies issue publicly subscribed bonds or 
issue stock for listing on the NASDAQ where listings are 
accepted even from firms that are not profitable. And, finally 
they list on the New York Stock Exchange. Such an approach is 
feasible in U.S. markets where a high degree of flexibility is 
allowed, compared to issuing bonds and listing on the Tokyo 
Stock Exchange. 
  Such a system is backed up by thorough disclosure rules. The 
prospectus of Shanghai Petrochemical Industries, which issued 
American Depository Receipts in July 1993, under "Factors To Be 
Considered in Investing," listed 11 items such as "price of 
crude oil," "insurance coverage for accidents" and "GATT 
restrictions." 
  Since 1992, the London Stock Exchange began to exercise 
flexibility in applying standards concerning total market 
valuation at time of listing. The aim was to accelerate the 
listing of stocks of companies which specialize in biotechnology 
research which is considered "Britain's last unlisted industry." 
A special committee was established in the stock exchange which 
was composed of institutional investors and industry 
representatives. According to sources at the Listing Department 
of the London Stock Exchange, the biotechnology-related 
businesses are "a very important sector for Britain," and if 
they cannot raise capital domestically, there is the risk that 
the industry will relocate to other countries. It appears that 
such concerns led to the actions being taken. 
  In its survey report titled, "Market 2000," concerning the 
structure and regulation of the U.S. stock markets, issued in 
January 1994, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
wrote, "If the SEC is to maintain strict standards, it must make 
market participants understand that the standards will bring 
appeal and benefits to the markets." 
  On 20 April, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji during meetings with a 
delegation from the Keizai Doyukai [Japan Association of 
Corporate Executives] said, "Eventually, we would like to list 
state-owned company stocks on Japanese stock exchanges." 
Although the foundation under Japanese stock exchanges is said 
to be disintegrating, strongly rooted hope still exists in 
relation to Japan. I would venture to say that there is a need 
for Japan to create "appeal and benefits" for its stock markets, 
before hopeful words of the foregoing nature disappear 
completely.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Coalition Era Is an Excellent Chance </F>
To Become Autonomous"] 
  [Text] The autonomy of the Fair Trade Commission [FTC] is 
being questioned over the issue of the arrest of former 
Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura, who is suspected of 
applying pressure in connection with the "Saitama Doyokai 
`dango' [bid-rigging by collusion] incident." Regarding 
Nakamura's repeated requests that the FTC withdraw its 
indictment, the FTC stresses that it rendered its judgment 
independently on the basis of "insufficient evidence." However, 
given the fact that the FTC was about to strengthen its 
enforcement of the Antimonopoly Law, some voices of apprehension 
are heard concerning a decline of its image. At a time when the 
United States is demanding stronger competitive measures and 
stepping up its criticism of Japan, attention is being focused 
on the FTC's role. 
<H5>  Despite a Decline in Intervention </H5>
"We politicians ourselves must seriously consider how to stop 
political intervention in public bidding." SDPJ [Social 
Democratic Party of Japan] Diet member Tatsuyo Matsumoto thus 
expressed her sentiment in listening to explanations concerning 
the public bidding policy offered by the FTC on 9 March to the 
coalition parties' project team on reform of the bidding system. 
  Political intervention in public bidding could lead to 
political intervention of the FTC which tries to prosecute 
"dango." As a certain Diet member of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] insists, "We must eradicate the `dango society'"; the 
sense of crisis regarding the problem is growing within the 
coalition parties. 
  According to FTC sources, in conjunction with the transfer 
of 
ruling power from the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] to the 
coalition parties, occasions for the FTC--which is moving toward 
a stronger antimonopoly policy--to receive political pressures 
are reportedly becoming extremely infrequent. It is said that 
"there has been virtually no opposition" regarding the recent 
policy which would certainly have encountered some reaction 
during the era of the LDP administration with the industrial 
circles as a backdrop, or during the on-the-spot inspection of 
the Shiseido Company on suspicion of obstructing discount sales. 
  However, among the coalition parties is the beginning of a 
new trend to form Dietmen leagues by industries and to seek 
"vested interests." Although "destruction of the 
government-bureaucratic-industrial alignment" is the slogan of 
the Hosokawa administration, the possibility of renewed strong 
pressures toward the FTC cannot be ruled out if the coalition 
era lasts for a longer period. 
  The FTC has steadily achieved results such as the 
prosecution 
of violations since the Japan-U.S. Structural Impediments 
Initiative talks (1989-1990) which advocated stronger 
enforcement of the Antimonopoly Law. However, a question remains 
as to whether it can respond adequately to the environmental 
changes. 
<H5>  "Bitter Experiences" of the LDP Era </H5>
  A certain FTC veteran points out that he "suffered bitter 
experiences a number of times during the LDP era." For example, 
when it was decided to exempt certain items from the resale 
price system, some cosmetic and pharmaceutical items were 
reportedly left intact due to opposition by LDP welfare zoku 
Dietmen, although several studies were made for total abolition. 
  In 1984, the policy on public bidding targeted the 
construction industry because of a "dango" incident (1982) among 
the construction contractors in Shizuoka Prefecture. The 
construction industry, alarmed by the prosecution of the 
violations, reportedly negotiated with the LDP construction 
"zoku" Dietmen, and the indictment was watered down to omit any 
clear reference to any violation of the law. Of course, 
regarding such an accusation, one member of the LDP construction 
subcommittee at the time declared emphatically as follows: 
"Unlike the United States, Japan does not have a climate of 
sheer competition. Setting aside decisions on the recipients of 
orders and bid prices, some form of coordination should be 
necessary. It is not wrong to hold a meeting for simple exchange 
of information." 
  It is said that there was a time when such political 
pressure 
served as a function to revise the Antimonopoly Law. While the 
penalty for violations under the 1992 revision was raised from 
the previous maximum 5 million yen to 100 million yen, the FTC 
was considering a hike to several hundred million yen. A certain 
politician of the LDP Antimonopoly Law Investigation Committee, 
who learned about this, reportedly called an FTC executive and 
strongly demanded a change in policy. 
  Professor Toshimasa Tsuruta of Senshu University, who serves 
as chairman of the FTC's distribution problems research group, 
makes the following appeal: "Although the FTC is trying its best 
to strengthen its prosecution administration, it has been the 
victim of politics under the LDP's 1955 system. Freedom from 
politics is now necessary." 
<H5>  Short of a Criminal Indictment </H5>
  However, it is true that self-help efforts are demanded of 
the FTC itself. Dietman Tadashi Kuranari, who once served as 
chairman of the LDP Antimonopoly Law Investigation Committee, 
declares: "Indictments in the industry are often limited to 
minor cases. Why does it [FTC] not fight against such colossal 
evils as the general constractors scandal?" There have been 
construction "dango" incidents in Saitama, Yokosuka, and 
Shizuoka, but they have all fallen short of being criminally 
indicted. 
  It has been cynically pointed out that, under the long rule 
of the LDP, the FTC has been "a watchdog that has been trained 
not to bite," rather than "a watchdog that does not bite" (an 
FTC veteran). Its true worth as an independent agency which is 
not trifled with will be demanded in the future.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Voices Urging `Give Priority to </F>
Deregulation'"] 
  [Text] On the afternoon of 11 March [1994] when former 
Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura was arrested on suspicion 
of receiving a bribe for interceding with the Fair Trade 
Commission [FTC], Chairman Masami Okayu of the FTC held a press 
conference and emphasized that he "wished to comply with the 
expectations of the people by strictly enforcing the 
Antimonopoly Law in the future." However, the environment 
surrounding the FTC has become increasingly severe. 
<H5>  MITI Opens Way to Revision </H5>
  In the comprehensive economic measures decided on 8 February 
[1994], a clause was inserted to "clarify the criteria for the 
handling of mergers and stock shareholding." The criteria is 
called "merger guidelines" and will serve as the standards for 
judgment as to whether the FTC will recognize mergers. They are 
important guidelines that may be regarded as the "constitution" 
for FTC investigation of mergers. The path to "constitutional 
revision" was paved by MITI [Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry]. The Industrial Structure Council, an advisory organ 
to the MITI minister, pointed out in its interim report drafted 
in late November 1993 that "the positioning of elements other 
than domestic shares is unclear," and that the element of shares 
in the global market should be added to the investigation 
criteria. The FTC had resisted at the outset by saying that 
"there is no problem with the current criteria" (Economic 
Department), but it was eventually overruled by MITI. 
  Demands are submitted to the FTC not only domestically, but 
also from overseas. The U.S. Government submitted a document 
requesting measures for competition within the framework of the 
Japan-U.S. economic talks, and it demanded easing of the 
regulation on premiums. The U.S. companies, which frequently use 
premiums to promote sales, complain strongly that strict 
regulation of premiums serve as a barrier to entry into the 
Japanese market. 
<H5>  Other Ministries Remain Cool </H5>
  Although the FTC is passive regarding the U.S. proposal and 
says that "the regulation concerning premiums is firmly in 
place," it is actually showing signs of relenting. In the air 
travel industry, the practice of offering free air travel 
coupons according to flight distances is spreading. However, it 
clearly violates the Premium Display Law which restricts 
premiums to "within 10 percent of the original transacted price, 
and under 50,000 yen." Nonetheless, the FTC tacitly approves it 
because "the unique circumstances of international air travel 
makes it difficult for Japan's rules to be applied" (Premium 
Display Guidance Division). 
  A view is even expressed that "perhaps the sense of the FTC 
is at variance with the international trend in the industry" 
(MITI executive). 
  Late last year, the FTC's study group (Chairman Toshimasa 
Tsuruta, professor of Senshu University) made public a report on 
the government regulations. It spelled out a basic policy of 
"abolishing, in principle, regulations on entry and pricing" and 
clarified the guidelines on the problems of government 
regulations by individual industries such as distribution and 
communications, in addition to ways to ease them. 
  Despite the fact that "the contents were quite penetrating" 
(an FTC executive), the other ministries took it rather coolly, 
saying: "We were not aware that such a report was issued" 
(Ministry of Transportation). The FTC report was obscured by the 
report of the Economic Reform Study Group [Hiraiwa study group] 
(an advisory organ to the prime minister; Gaishi Hiraiwa, 
chairman), which was announced about the same time and which 
also advocated abolition of economic regulations in principle. 
  In the first place, the FTC's study group was hastily 
convened when deregulation became a major theme in the Economic 
Reform Study Group, and it was felt that "the FTC must also do 
something." In addition to being frequently shaken by domestic 
and foreign pressures, the FTC could not hide its weak-kneed 
statements. 
<H5>  Strict Surveillance of "Discount Sales" </H5>
  Despite its passiveness concerning deregulation, the FTC 
keeps a sharp eye on "discount sales" amid the trend toward 
price-cutting. In November 1993, it issued orders to exclude 
four major discount stores on men's clothing for violating the 
display law. The reason given was that unfair double-standard 
prices were displayed to give the impression of lower sale 
prices. Professor Ushio Nakajo of Keio University stated that it 
is natural to strictly control violations. However, he 
questioned the posture of the FTC, saying: "The FTC should have 
other matters to tend to." His contention is that the FTC should 
give priority to grappling with deregulation and prosecution of 
"dango." 
  Strengthening measures for competition is one of the four 
pillars of an open market policy that the government will draft 
by the end of March [1994], and "the role of the FTC is being 
elevated to an unprecedented level" (Hiroshi Iju, adviser to 
Mitsubishi Research Institute). 
  Enforcement of the Antimonopoly Law is often swayed by 
pressures from politicians and foreign countries, as well as by 
demands from the industries. Of course, there are tasks that the 
government as a whole must grapple with, such as the buildup of 
the investigation sector which is said to be understaffed. 
However, unless the FTC adopts a firm stance regarding its 
policy on competition, the raison d'etre of the FTC itself will 
be questioned.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Autonomy Is the Life and Soul of FTC"] </F>
  [Text] While the Fair Trade Commission [FTC] is a bona fide 
administrative agency, it differs from the other government 
agencies in that it is a "quasi-legislative organ" with 
additional authority similar to that of the public prosecutors 
office. 
  The FTC is given authority to indict and criminally 
prosecute 
acts which violate the Antimonopoly Law. The chairman and four 
commission members, like the public prosecutor's office and 
judges, are guaranteed the authority to independently perform 
their duties. 
  Former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura's request that 
the FTC overlook indictment of the "dango" incident by the 
Saitama Doyokai was tantamount to demanding a change by the 
court prior to its decision. This is quite difficult to 
comprehend. 
  In addition, it has been clarified that former Prime 
Minister 
Miyazawa relayed former LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] Vice 
President Kanemaru's wish to "forego indictment" to former FTC 
Umezawa. He cannot escape criticism for indiscretion. 
  The responsibility of politicians will eventually be 
clarified. The problem is that politicians had the understanding 
that "the policy of the FTC could be changed by applying 
pressure." 
  The FTC's posture in seeking the understanding and 
cooperation of politicians--particularly of the ruling parties' 
Dietmen--on budget acquisition and reform of laws is, as in the 
case of the other agencies, inevitable in some aspects. However, 
if a relationship of indebtedness arises with an inclination to 
comply with demands, it is simply out of the question. 
  The FTC should take this opportunity for a complete 
reexamination of past antimonopoly administration. It is 
necessary to check whether it has permitted political 
intervention, or whether it has lacked the integrity to reject 
pressures when there were doubtful moves. Unless it does so, 
suspicion concerning the FTC's autonomy cannot be eradicated. 
  When former Chairman Umezawa dropped the idea of criminal 
indictment, he stated that "it was totally based on a lack of 
evidence" and denied any pressures from politicians. If it was 
based on close consultation with the public prosecutors office, 
we would like to believe at the present that it was a proper 
judgment. 
  However, if the arrest of former Construction Minister 
Nakamura was in fact based on suspicion, it would mean that he 
had lied about the intervention by politicians. Umezawa himself 
should clarify when and how the former construction minister 
applied pressure and whether there were other approaches made. 
  It is well known that the FTC is a "legacy" left by the 
postwar U.S. Occupation policy. Subsequently, emasculation of 
the Antimonopoly Law has consistently been contrived. 
  However, a reinforcement of the FTC has been demanded 
through 
the Japan-U.S. talks. The government is faced with the need to 
promote competitive measures based on the Antimonopoly Law in 
order to set forth a posture of emphasis on the consumers. The 
role of the FTC has grown unprecedentedly. 
  To meet the expectations of the people, the FTC must adopt a 
consistent posture to avoid the impression that its application 
of the Antimonopoly Law is arbitrary and discriminatory. 
  There is said to be a considerable variation in the 
interpretation of the Antimonoply Law among experts. It is 
therefore important to display clear-cut judgment. If its 
application varies according to acts of violation, credibility 
regarding antimonopoly administration will not only be shaken, 
but also political intervention will be permitted to pass 
through the cracks. 
  There is also a problem with the present FTC system. In 
recent years, the chair has been occupied by former Treasury 
Ministry officials. The remaining four commission seats have all 
been occupied by former bureaucrats. Based on the nature of the 
FTC's duty to promote fair business activity and free 
competition, an array of personnel that speaks for the 
government agencies is not desirable. Representatives of the 
consumers and neutral persons such as scholars should be 
appointed. 
  Political intervention can be rejected by enhancing 
neutrality and by consistent and appropriate application of the 
Antimonopoly Law.

political consultations of the leaderships of the Mongolian 
National Democratic Party, Mongolian Social Democratic Party, 
Mongolian Democratic Association, Union of Mongolian Students 
and Union for New Progress with the participants of the hunger 
strike lasting for 15 days already who are demanding the 
resignation of the government have so far resulted in nothing. 
The disagreement existing between the participating sides is 
apparently telling on in reference to the issue of the further 
ways and perspectives for continuing the political struggle. 
  The press conference scheduled to be held today at the 
headquarters of the political strike has not been held and the 
reasons for its postponing to tomorrow have not been announced.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 25 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- As was 
informed by the special issue of the newspaper "ERH CHOLOO" the 
Mongolian Prime Minister P. Jasray has refused to sign an 
agreement with the participants of the hunger strike going on 
their action demanding the resignation of the government. 
  He gave such reason for his refusal as that neither in the 
Constitution of the country nor in the law on the government 
there is proper provision providing for a preliminary arriving 
at an agreement on resignation of the government with 
individuals or organizations. During the meeting with the 
representatives of the hunger strikers on 24 April the prime 
minister also called upon the strikers to discontinue the hunger 
strike as a sign of respect of the stand by the president, the 
recommendations of the Council for Ensuring the National 
Security and the decisions by the parliament. 
  In the agreement on concord there is provided for as a 
condition for ending the hunger strike the resignation of the 
government in case their failure to fulfill their programme of 
action for the year 1994. 
  In association with the fact that the head of the government 
has denied this proposal it has been decided to continue the 
hunger strike of members and supporters of the Mongolian 
Democratic Association, Union of Mongolian Students and Union 
for New Progress demanding the resignation of the government. 
The hunger strike is being continued for 15 days. 
  The participants of the counterhunger strike in support of 
the government have stopped their action on 23 April.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 25 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- It has 
been announced here that the hunger strike at the central square 
of the Ulaanbaatar city which lasts 292 hours and was called by 
the members and supporters of the Mongolian Democratic 
Association and the Union of Mongolian Students and the Union 
for New Progress having been demanding the resignation of the 
incumbent government of Mongolia has been stopped today. As is 
reported the leader of the Mongolian Democratic Association T. 
Elbegdorj declaring the decision on stopping the hunger strike 
said that here that "the present government is not worth dying 
for it." The events around the hunger strike has shown the 
actual face of the leadership of the government and the 
parliament. To stop the hunger strike, he noted in this 
respect, does not mean the completion of our struggle. It would 
be continuing and expanding up to an organization of a general 
strike and our demands are remaining in force. It is not the 
time yet to speak about who is the winner and who is the loser. 
We have attained a great success by that in accordance with our 
demands there has been laid down proper foundations for 
establishing free means of mass information media in Mongolian 
society.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Yoshiyuki Sugiyama] </F>
  [Text] More than 800,000 ethnic Koreans reside in the 
Korean Yanbian Autonomous Prefecture, in China's Jilin Province, 
which borders the DPRK (North Korea). These ethnic Koreans 
account for about 40 percent of prefecture's total population. 
For this reason, there has been a constant exchange of visits 
between the ethnic Koreans in the prefecture and North Koreans. 
YOMIURI SHIMBUN has covered the food situation and the issue of 
opening up in North Korea--which is further deepening its 
international isolation by raising the nuclear issue--from the 
Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, which is a "point of 
contact" linking the DPRK to the international community. 
  Cool weather this spring caused most rice paddies to wither 
before maturing, and the withered rice paddies cover fields in a 
village facing North Korea across the Tumen River. Last year, 
the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture suffered an 
unprecedentedly poor rice crop, with the rice harvest being 30 
to 40 percent below average. 
  Some ethnic Koreans, who have gotten the first look at the 
actual situation in North Korea, said in unison, "North Korea 
also is in the same situation." Kim Kum-chul, deputy chief of 
the Export and Import Office under the prefectural Foreign 
Economic and Trade Committee, agreed with their comments, 
saying, "The food situation in North Korea is very serious." 
Last year, the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture shipped 
200,000 tons of food to North Korea, which his almost the same 
level as in the past. 
  Ethnic Koreans in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture 
and North Koreans have visited each other's relatives. They 
have engaged in their own trade besides the trade undertaken 
between North Korea and China. Their exchange of visits has 
been a valuable channel for North Koreans to secure food. 
<H5>  Travel Restrictions </H5>
  From last summer to the fall, when the rice harvest was 
extremely poor, North Korea restricted individual travel to 
China. According to an ethnic Korean residing in the 
prefecture, China has restricted individual visits to North 
Korea to one a year since 1993. Both the DPRK and China are 
said to have restricted individual travel by Koreans in order to 
bring the border trade under state control. 
  The 82d birthday of North Korean President Kim Il-song was 
marked on 15 April. That day, one border checkpoint in Tumen 
city out of the five border checkpoints along the Tumen River 
remained idle. According to the municipal government, in the 
past, 500-600 Korean visitors passed through the border 
checkpoint each day, but now only a few Koreans pass through the 
checkpoint. Both North Korea and China have tightly controlled 
the border trade, and trade statistics show that as a result of 
the state control of this activity, trade between the two 
countries jumped from $100 million in 1992 to $300 million last 
year. China ships food, industrial raw materials, and 
commercial electric appliances to North Korea, which in return 
sends steel products, lumber, Soviet-built automobiles, and 
marine products to China. 
  A small number of North Koreans have illegally crossed the 
frozen Tumen River into China. Upon discovering them, both 
North Korea and China deport immediately those persons, in 
accordance with a bilateral treaty. There have been no disputes 
between the two countries over their illegal immigrants. 
<H5>  North Korea Eager To Open Up </H5>
  The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture said that what 
North 
Korea really wants is to develop its economy by opening itself 
to outside world, and it added that the DPRK has sent clear 
signals to this effect. 
  According to an official with the Yanbian Korean Autonomous 
Prefecture, the DPRK has expanded the extent of the 
Najin-Sonbong Free Economic and Trade Zone from the southern 
side of the mouth of the Tumen River to areas near Fuchun city 
after North Korea, at a December 1993 plenary session of the 
Workers Party of Korea Central Committee, adopted a "policy of 
promoting trade." This move shows that North Korea, which has 
refused to participate in the development of the Tumen River to 
protect the interests of its ports, including the Chongjin port 
(according to a Chinese source), is now eager to develop its 
economy through economic cooperation with China and Russia. 
  A delegation of the Najin-Sonbong Free Economic and Trade 
Zone which recently visited the prefecture said, "Our nation can 
only open up partially because of the North-South issue," but 
the delegation's members expressed great eagerness to open up 
their country. 
  National Sentiments 
  The prevailing view in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous 
Prefecture is that even if the United Nations imposes economic 
sanctions on North Korea, it would be impossible to cut off 
trade between the prefecture and the DPRK, which are closely 
tied by the same national blood. 
  An ethnic Korean youth in Yanjin said: "As ethnic Koreans 
residing in China, our opinion is that the nation is more 
important than the state. We cannot go along with any economic 
sanctions against our parents and relatives living in North 
Korea. We would be unable to trade openly with the North Koreans 
if economic sanctions are imposed, but there are a lot of ways 
to trade secretly with them." 
  The ethnic Korean Chong Yong-cha, age 50, who once fled from 
China into the DPRK during the Great Cultural Revolution but who 
now sells dried fish in Tumen city, said, "My brothers and 
sisters want me to send them medicine." 
<H5>  South Korea's Moves </H5>
  For South Koreans, the ethnic Koreans in the Yanbian Korean 
Autonomous Prefecture are their compatriots. South Korea's 
direct capital investment in China has sharply grown since 1992, 
when China and the ROK established diplomatic relations. Of 542 
foreign-affiliated enterprises in the prefecture, 251 of them 
are South Korean-affiliated enterprises. About 500 ROK 
businessmen were working in the prefecture at the end of 1993. 
  Mr. Che Su-chol, a South Korean president of a joint-venture 
textile company in Huchun city, said: "I want to make Yanbian a 
front-line base for advancing into the East Asian market. I am 
looking to North Korea as my potential future market." 
  According to a South Korean trader, many South Koreans are 
engaged in manufacturing goods, arranging marriages for South 
Korean youths, and reuniting displaced Korean relatives. Some 
South Koreans appear to be collecting a variety of information 
on the DPRK.

  [Text] According to the Foreign Ministry's Information 
Department, on 22 April Thai ambassador to Phnom Penh Sakthip 
Krairoek called on King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Monique at 
their palace. The following is the essence of the meeting: 
  On behalf of the Thai Government and the Thai people, the 
ambassador expressed pleasure that the king's health has 
improved, which enabled him to return to Cambodia to the delight 
of the Cambodian people. The ambassador also congratulated and 
expressed support for the king's proposal to hold a round-table 
meeting of the leaders of Cambodian factions -- Samdech Norodom 
Ranariddh, Samdech Chea Sim, Samdech Hun Sen, and Khieu Samphan 
-- during 2-5 May. The Thai envoy expressed the view that due 
to the respect and acceptance of all Cambodians, King Sihanouk 
is currently the only person to be able to achieve national 
reconciliation. The Thai Government sincerely wishes to see 
national reconciliation materialized in Cambodia as well as 
peace and progress there like in other countries in the region. 
  On Thai-Cambodian relations, King Sihanouk felt that 
accusations and counteraccusations through the mass media should 
end. It would be better for the two countries to use diplomatic 
measures or government-level contacts. 
  The Thai envoy emphasized that the Thai Government 
recognizes 
the Cambodian Government as the sole legitimate administration 
of Cambodia and that it does not support the Khmer Rouge. The 
Thai Government is determined to maintain good relations and see 
the neighboring countries, including Cambodia, enjoy stability 
and prosperity. It reiterates continued support for the 
Cambodian government's national reconstruction efforts.

<F P=106> ["Message of His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of </F>
Cambodia, to His Excellency Khieu Samphan, chairman of the Party 
of Democratic Kampuchea"; dated 24 April -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] After receiving your important and detailed letter 
concerning especially the issues of your security and a totally 
neutral place in Cambodia or in a friendly country, I am honored 
to inform you as follows: 
  1. I have provided Samdech Chea Sim, Samdech Krompreah 
Norodom Ranariddh, and Samdech Hun Sen with the choice of the 
following two formulas: 
  In my opinion, the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] 
headed 
by yourself could be satisfied with the PDK delegation's 
residence in the Royal Palace near the Khemarin hall, which is 
presently occupied by His Excellency and Madam Khek Sisoda and 
Chinese doctors, who have agreed to move out of the building; 
  Or you want our roundtable meeting to be held in my 
residence 
at (Fang Sun-on) near Pyongyang in the DPRK. [as heard] 
  2. Samdech Chea Sim, Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, 
and Samdech Hun Sen have just given me an unanimous answer that: 
  a. You will be staying in your office next to the Royal 
Palace, but outside the palace's perimeter. The three samdechs 
will guarantee 100 percent security for you and your PDK 
delegation during your stay in Phnom Penh for the round-table 
meeting. 
  3. The three samdechs object to your moving the roundtable 
meeting outside the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
  As for myself, I am of the opinion that if you disagree with 
the three samdechs on any aspect of the above formulas or have a 
contradictory request, our roundtable could be held in the 
future. Somehow, should you agree with the above formulas 
proposed by the three samdechs, our roundtable would take place 
as scheduled at the Damnak Chan pavilion in the Royal Palace in 
Phnom Penh from 2 to 7 May 1994. 
  Security guards to ensure security for you from Pochentong 
[Airport] to Phnom Penh and vice versa will be provided by the 
Kingdom of Cambodia's Royal Government. 
  Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen, 
co-prime ministers of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC], 
will be in charge of guaranteeing the security of you and your 
delegation during your stay in Phnom Penh. 
  Your Excellency, please accept my regards and deepest 
fidelity. 
  [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk 
  [Dated] Phnom Penh, 24 April 1994.

  [Text] Between 21 and 23 April, the ongoing situation in 
Pailin developed rapidly as follows: 
  1. At Treng, Sdau, and Snoeng: The demoralized and routed 
invading forces, both chiefs and rank and file, with light and 
heavy guns, tanks, and armored carriers rushed precipitately by 
driving or walking from Pailin toward Battambang. 
  2. At Kamping Puoy, Ta Kream, Krapeu, and Phnum Sampoeu: 
The forces here were the positions which defended Battambang 
and the base of the 196th Division and which had militarily been 
reinforced for years, but were also routed. They also rushed 
precipitately toward Battambang. 
  The cause of their unstoppable fleeing was that the 196th 
Division sent by the communist Vietnamese puppet leaders to 
Pailin had basically been smashed. As such, the remaining 
terrified troops broke from their ranks and ran from Kamping 
Puoy, Ta Kream, Krapeu, and Phnum Sampoeu toward Battambang with 
the hope that they would set themselves free from the battles. 
  3. The chaotic situation in the town of Battambang: In the 
situation where the troops of the communist Vietnamese puppets 
and of the U.S. puppets, who were badly smashed and routed in 
Pailin, rushed precipitately toward Battambang town -- some had 
only their clothes with them -- Battambang was thrown into a 
terrified, alarmed, and confused situation. This was not 
because of fear of imminent attacks by the National Army of 
Democratic Kampuchea [NADK], but mainly because the routed 
troops from Pailin and Route 10 robbed, shot at, and tossed hand 
grenades killing people at market places in a tumultuous, 
uncontrollable, and unpreventable manner. As both chiefs and 
rank and file carried out robbery and shooting, Battambang 
became a place where war erupted and where the communist 
Vietnamese puppets, both military and civilian, and the U.S. 
puppets, both military and civilian, murdered people according 
to their fascist nature. 
  4. In this situation, Battambang's residents are running 
about in horror. They angrily curse the base robbers and pray 
that the NADK and the people will arrive immediately to ensure 
security for them.

  [Text] At 0300 on 24 April, routed troops fleeing toward 
Treng quarreled and fired at one another, killing or wounding 
hundreds. Those who fled toward Battambang did so chaotically to 
save their lives. 
  On the battlefield east of Pailin: On 24 April we swept from 
O Kchheay to Chisang and completely controlled the area. We 
seized a T-54 tank and a tractor. 
  Special report: Preliminary results say that at 0020 on 23 
April, we launched a special attack against the regimental 
position of the communist Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed 
government in Sdau on Route 10, killing 19 on the spot, 
including a major. A number of soldiers were wounded and 
dragged back by their colleagues. We seized 10 assorted 
firearms. At 0300, their commanders ordered tanks to retake 
this position. However, so far no tanks have dared to show up.

  [Text] A high-ranking officer of the Khmer Royal Armed 
Forces said on 22 April that government forces are planning to 
retake Pailin within one month. Pailin fell back into Khmer 
Rouge hands on 19 April, embarrasing the government which 
controlled that place for only exactly a month (19 March-19 
April). 
  This army officer, a general in the high command of the 5th 
Military Region headquartered in Battambang, and who requested 
anonymity, said that "the operation to retake Pailin will be 
completed within a month using infantry troops and the Air 
Force, because the rainy season has now arrived; we cannot use 
tanks, trucks, or heavy weapons." 
  However this official stressed that the helicopter unit of 
the Air Force has started strafing with rockets and fired 
hundreds of artillery shells daily on various Khmer Rouge 
positions around Pailin. Furthermore, a lot of reinforcement 
troops are being dispatched to the forward positions, bases of 
the royal government. These reinforcement troops are taken there 
by helicopters from Svay Rieng, Prey Veng, and Kompong Chhnang 
Provinces. 
  It is not known how many reinforcement troops or what the 
total number of troops involved in the operation to retake 
Pailin will be. It is still remembered, however, that on 19 
March when the government forces captured Pailin, about 10,000 
troops were involved, while there were not even 500 Khmer Rouge 
soldiers. When the rebels took back Pailin on 19 April, the 
Khmer Rouge used more than 3,000 troops, nearly half of all the 
rebels' forces. 
  During a recent mission to Battambang Province, Second Prime 
Minister Samdech Hun Sen accused Thailand of helping the Khmer 
Rouge retake Pailin and threatened to ban Thai companies from 
doing business with the Khmer Rouge as has happened before. 
  A high-ranking government official, who requested anonymity, 
pointed out the reason for the defeat in Pailin, saying that 
this also stemmed from the morale of the front-line troops who 
were facing harsh living conditions. It was also started by 
jealousy resulting from the distribution of property and houses 
in Pailin town and also the distribution of war trophies. 
  A general said that if we successfully take back Pailin this 
time the 5th Military Region will issue a new order prohibiting 
the repeat of this process. 
  The general also said: "If we retake Pailin, we will not 
allow army officiers or any soldiers to take over property in 
Pailin; furthermore, army officiers and soldiers will not be 
allowed to live in houses in Pailin." 
  This high-ranking army official stressed: "We will build a 
new base in Pailin town by putting up tents to avoid jealousy 
among troops, strengthen discipline, and avoid eventual 
incidents."

  [Text] Phnom Penh, April 23 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge [KR] 
guerrillas killed six people and injured 35 others when they 
ambushed a train running from the capital to Cambodia's second 
city of Battambang, the director of the state railway said 
Saturday. 
  "A group of about 40 Khmer Rouge laid six mines along the 
track and after the train hit the mines, they opened fire on the 
carriages," Pich Kimsreang, the railway director, said. 
  The engine was damaged and 11 coaches were derailed by the 
blast, he said. 
  The ambush took place Thursday in the Bakan district of 
western Pursat province, he added. 
  A firefight between the guerrillas and the railway militia 
went on for about an hour until the militia ran out of 
ammunition and ran to seek help from the local police or 
military, the director said. 
  "The Khmer Rouge then occupied the train for about five 
hours 
and robbed all the passengers. They took all the valuable 
belongings including 10 motorbikes," he said. 
  The guerrillas retreated when government forces arrived on 
the scene.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "KR Leaders Must Be Offered Role in New </F>
Cambodian Government"] 
  [Text] At times, it seems as if King Norodom Sihanouk 
possesses the sole voice of sanity in his wretched country. As 
yet another season of war draws to a close, little has changed 
in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge [KR], buoyed by consecutive 
victories over the government army at Pailin and Anlong Veng, 
are vowing to wreak havoc throughout the country. And the 
government in Phnom Penh, while stung by the losses, 
nevertheless maintains that a military solution is the only 
answer to the insurgency. 
  Appealing for cooler heads in the aftermath of the Khmer 
Rouge's fierce counter-offensive on Pailin, Sihanouk urged the 
two sides to come together for peace talks, bemoaning that this 
"fratricidal war continues to ruin and bleed our nation white". 
  The leaders of the two warring parties have reluctantly 
agreed, but if previous negotiations are anything to go by, the 
chances for success are slim. 
  An earlier attempt by the king to bring the combatants 
together was linked to a so-called "Five Point Plan." This 
called, amongst other things, for the Khmer Rouge to declare a 
ceasefire, open its zones of control and demobilise its 
estimated 9,000 man-strong guerrilla army. 
  In exchange the government would open negotiations with the 
rebels to discuss their demands for an advisory role in 
government and an offer of cabinet positions for certain 
"acceptable Khmer Rouge officials." 
  The Khmer Rouge's nominal chief, Khieu Samphan, rejected the 
deal, saying there could be no preconditions, and the government 
responded by intensifying the war against the guerrillas. 
  The main stumbling block, now as in all previous peace 
attempts, is what to do with the Khmer Rouge's powerful 
military. The Khmer Rouge leadership knows that without its 
guns and border sanctuaries it is doomed and will not abandon 
them for vague promises of political legitimacy. 
  At February's international donor conference in Tokyo, the 
Cambodian government dismissed the Khmer Rouge threat as little 
more than the last flickers of a dying revolution and said the 
country faced bigger problems in overcoming widespread poverty 
and infrastructure woes. 
  But as the guerrillas proved over the dry season, they 
remain 
a formidable force and potent source of instability in the 
country. Cambodia is not going to be able to make a break from 
its tragic past as long as they remain at odds with the 
government. In recent weeks they have kidnapped and shot at 
foreign aid workers and travellers and even advised Sihanouk to 
leave the country for safety. 
  Their ability to create terror at will has disabled the 
nascent tourism industry and chilled foreign investors. Clearly 
the Khmer Rouge cannot be ignored and, as the recent fighting 
showed, are unlikely to be beaten on the battlefield. 
  But this is not to say the Khmer Rouge -- or rather the 
resentment, racial enmity and destabilization they represent -- 
cannot be vanquished. 
  By offering Khmer Rouge leaders a limited role in 
government, 
the Phnom Penh government can temporarily muzzle the military 
threat posed by the guerrilla group and allow Cambodia's 
suspended development to begin anew. 
  Economic growth and democracy are the answers to the Khmer 
Rouge problem. The ideology of the Marxist group is dead and 
the issues that have traditionally sustained them -- the 
illegality of the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh 
and unlawful Vietnamese immigration -- have been made redundant 
by the UN peace mission or are being addressed. 
  If other issues like official corruption and abuse of power 
can also be taken care of, there is no reason why a true 
national reconciliation cannot take place in Cambodia. The 
Khmer Rouge's footmen will not stay in the jungle if they can 
see a better, more just way in mainstream society.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Perry and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata reconfirmed 
Friday that the international community should take a firm 
stance against North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons development 
while keeping doors open for dialogue, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  Perry and Hata also agreed in a meeting at the Foreign 
Ministry on the importance of a diplomatic solution to the 
problem and close cooperation among Japan, the United States and 
South Korea, the officials said. 
  Hata told Perry if North Korea does not change its position, 
it is inevitable that the UN Security Council will have to 
discuss stricter measures, such as economic sanctions, against 
Pyongyang. 
  "In such a case, Japan intends to take a responsible stance 
within the framework of the constitution," Hata was quoted as 
saying, adding that close consultation with the U.S. is 
important in such circumstances. 
  He also pointed out that it is important for the Security 
Council to proceed with the discussions "gradually and 
step-by-step" so as to leave the doors open for dialogue with 
Pyongyang. 
  Perry and Hata also agreed on the importance of China's role 
in persuading North Korea to change its position, the officials 
said. 
  They agreed to closely watch developments between North 
Korea 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the 
unofficial meetings with Washington, they said. 
  The officials declined to disclose the details of the 
75-minute meeting because of the sensitivity of the issue. 
  "I don't feel free to say (the contents of the meeting)," 
Perry told reporters after the talks. 
  Perry, who flew to Tokyo from Seoul Thursday night, was 
quoted as telling Hata that he does not think a military clash 
is likely on the Korean peninsula at the moment. 
  Perry said in Seoul Thursday that North Korea may be ready 
within weeks to remove enough plutonium from a nuclear reactor 
to build four or five nuclear bombs. 
  The IAEA inspectors were allowed into North Korea last month 
to check its nuclear facilities but were unable to determine if 
radioactive materials had been diverted to military purposes 
because Pyongyang blocked the inspectors from a key laboratory. 
  Pyongyang in March of last year announced its intention to 
withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  On the bilateral front, Hata told Perry that relations with 
the U.S. will be an important "axis" for Japan's new government 
and that the country wants to deepen cooperation with 
Washington, the officials said. 
  Hata is the most likely candidate to succeed outgoing Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Perry told Hata that the security arrangement between the 
U.S. and Japan is the pivot of security in East Asia, they said. 
  Hata told Perry Japan is studying whether the Theater 
Missile 
Defense (TMD) system is effective for Japan's security. 
  He said he wants continued talks with the U.S. on the 
matter. 
  The TMD system, an advanced version of the Patriot missile, 
would destroy incoming missiles while they are flying above or 
through the atmosphere.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Japan's Defense Agency 
[DA] Director General Kazuo Aichi and South Korea's Yi Pyong-tae 
agreed Tuesday [26 April] a diplomatic solution through talks is 
the best way to convince North Korea to allow full international 
inspections of its nuclear facilities, agency officials said 
Tuesday. 
  The officials said Aichi and Yi, who met at Defense Agency 
Headquarters in Tokyo, agreed that their respective countries, 
along with the United States, will maintain close cooperation. 
  Aichi told Yi that Japan is studying the problem as "a 
matter 
for Japan itself" and if the United Nations Security Council 
votes for sanctions against North Korea, Japan will "respond 
responsibly within the bounds of the Constitution," they said. 
  It is the first time a South Korean defense minister has 
visited Japan. 
  Aichi and Yi also agreed on exchange visits between training 
fleets and to work toward early implementation of procedures to 
prevent air accidents, officials said. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) wants to 
inspect the spent fuel core of North Korea's Yongbyon reactor 
for evidence of whether any material has been diverted for 
possible use in a covert nuclear weapons development program. 
  On Monday, North Korea said it wants IAEA inspectors to 
monitor the refueling of its main nuclear reactor at the end of 
the month. 
  But an IAEA source said the agency needs to further sound 
out 
Pyongyang on an inspection mission, noting North Korea has yet 
to reply to the agency's inquiries.

  [Text] Washington, April 24 KYODO -- Japanese officials are 
voicing optimism over policy pressures while stressing aid to 
Russia as the main focus ahead of the Group of Seven (G-7) 
ministerial meeting opening in Washington on Sunday [24 April) 
afternoon. 
  Finance ministers and central bankers from the world's 
richest nations are set to begin a five-hour meeting at 12 P.M. 
at the historic landmark Dumbarton house to kick off a spate of 
international financial meetings that will continue through 
Tuesday. 
  The officials said macroeconomic issues will cover only 
about 
the first hour and half of the meeting and the rest will be on 
aid to Russia. Three Russian representatives led by Deputy 
Prime Minister and Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin will 
join in the final hour, they said. 
  "Coordination on macroeconomic coordination has become 
easier 
with G-7 nations showing improvements in their economies," said 
a top Japanese official close to the closed-door meeting. 
  But many analysts feel differently, citing the recent gap in 
credit stance stemming from the diverse state of the economy. 
  The G-7 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, 
Japan and the United States. 
  Another Japanese official, accompanying Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii, said the G-7 session is to "review the 
macroeconomic developments" after the February meeting in 
Germany. 
  He said the recent rise in long-term rates among G-7 nations 
will certainly be discussed as one such development, but he 
noted that Fujii recognizes the recent U.S. credit tightening as 
"preemptive" measures to curb inflation. 
  On currency rates, Fujii told reporters that he intends to 
stress again his concerns over the yen's sharp rise that may put 
a damper on the economy that is starting to improve. 
  But he said, "Exchange levels are not for us (G-7 ministers) 
to decide." 
  Otherwise, the G-7 financial leaders will concentrate on new 
commitments to Russia, possibly agreeing on new loans and debt 
rescheduling, to start implementing the 43 billion dollar 
package agreed to last April. 
  He said such new commitments gathered attention after the 
recent decision by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to 
disburse the remaining 1.5 billion dollars of the 3 billion 
dollar loans to promote systemic transformation. 
  A statement is unlikely to be issued, they said, confirming 
earlier remarks by U.S. Treasury [Secretary] Lloyd Bentsen, who 
chairs the meeting. 
  Fujii and Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno will hold a 
joint news conference after the meeting. 
  Before the G-7 session, Fujii will meet with Bentsen at 9:30 
A.M., Japanese officials said. 
  Fujii said he will explain to Bentsen the state of the 
Japanese with "things progressed" since the previous Frankfurt 
G-7 meeting in February. 
  "We have moved one step forward," he said, citing a policy 
accord newly reached Friday by the ruling coalition parties 
before choosing Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata as their candidate to succeed outgoing Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  The accord endorsed a full-fledged tax reform, including 
permanent tax cuts and offsetting indirect tax hikes, to be 
decided in June and enacted by the end of the year. 
  Meanwhile, a Japanese source said Fujii will again decline 
to 
predict the scale or any other details of the tax reform that is 
to be decided by the Diet. 
  The source also said the finance minister will ask Bentsen 
to 
see from a longer run Japan's current account surplus already 
"clearly falling in terms of the yen and volume." 
  Fujii is scheduled to leave for home Sunday after the 
meeting, failing to join the twice-yearly gatherings of the IMF 
and the World Bank due to a tight domestic schedule involving 
formation of a new cabinet.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata, who is certain to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, indicated Friday [22 April] a prime minister should 
not serve concurrently as foreign minister. 
  Hata, 58, told a press conference the posts of prime 
minister 
and foreign minister should be held by different individuals to 
meet the demands of Japan's growing international role. 
  He pointed out that a great number of leaders from abroad 
now 
visit Japan and that the foreign minister should be able to 
travel overseas whenever necessary. 
  Hata said times have changed since the 1940s, when Prime 
Minister Shigeru Yoshida also served as foreign minister. 
  Heads of coalition parties will endorse Hata, who is also 
deputy prime minister and head of Shinseito, as a candidate for 
prime minister Friday afternoon following a deal struck early 
Friday by coalition representatives on a draft policy platform 
for a new cabinet. 
  Hata is certain to be elected prime minister in a Diet 
election expected Monday to select a successor to Hosokawa, who 
announced his resignation April 8.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata, the ruling coalition's candidate to succeed Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, said Friday [22 April] that if elected 
premier, he wants to create a country that could win 
international trust. 
  Hata told a joint press conference with leaders of coalition 
parties that he will do his best to make Japan a nation of "high 
quality" which could be internationally trusted, understood and 
loved. 
  Calling himself "an inexperienced person" who hesitated to 
shoulder the burden of leading the nation, the 58-year-old Hata 
said, "but considering the support and the hardships of 
everyone, I decided to accept the recommendation, feeling my 
body tremble." 
  Prior to the news conference, the heads of the coalition 
parties endorsed a policy platform for a new cabinet and chose 
Hata, leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], as their 
candidate for prime minister. 
  Hata is expected to win the election for the premiership in 
plenary session votes of the House of Representatives and the 
House of Councillors on Monday. 
  The second coalition administration, led by Hata, will be 
launched later Monday. 
  The coalition agreement to field Hata, who is also deputy 
prime minister in the Hosokawa administration, followed weeks of 
wrangling over two vital policy issues -- tax reform and 
national security. 
  On April 8, Hosokawa, who became premier last August, 
abruptly announced he will resign to take responsibility for 
stalled Diet business over his alleged involvement in financial 
scandals. 
  Hata said he does not think there are cracks in the ruling 
coalition although the parties took two weeks to narrow 
differences over policies. The two weeks of debates were 
"meaningful," Hata said, because discussions on such matters as 
tax reform had to be done anyway by the end of June. 
  Hata also pointed out the need to enact the fiscal 1994 
budget as early as possible. 
  He said that although the ruling parties come from different 
backgrounds, the Hosokawa government was able to overcome 
various difficult problems, such as those involving the Uruguay 
Round of multilateral trade talks and electoral reform. 
  Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, 
said he recommended at the meeting of heads of parties earlier 
in the day that Hata is the "most suitable" person to succeed 
Hosokawa. The leaders of the parties unanimously agreed to 
field Hata as the candidate, he said. 
  Keigo Ouchi, head of the Democratic Socialist Party, said 
Hata is the most suitable considering his personality, knowledge 
and ability. 
  Komeito chairman Koshiro Ishida said the new government's 
main theme is to push ahead with reforms and an early enactment 
of the budget.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 23 KYODO -- Japan's major dailies on 
Saturday editorially welcomed the coalition's end to a two-week 
political paralysis by choosing Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as 
their candidate for prime minister, but also pointed out the 
difficulties lying ahead. 
  "Hata was considered the most likely candidate from the 
beginning," the ASAHI SHIMBUN said, citing the candidate's 
cabinet experience in Liberal Democratic Party-led governments 
and his "comparably high" popularity. 
  But "the Hata government sets sails while revealing big 
contradictions," the ASAHI editorial continued, pointing to 
major policy differences and animosity between Shinseito's 
[Japan Renewal Party] key strategist Ichiro Ozawa and leaders of 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest coalition party. 
  "Both (sides) were like oil and water from the very 
beginning," it said, adding that policy clashes over North Korea 
and tax increases seem inevitable. 
  "As before, Shinseito's No. 2 man Ozawa will play the major 
role, as so far Hata has failed to put his foot down on the 
intracoalition struggle," said the ASAHI editorial entitled, 
"Isn't It Prime Minister Ozawa?" 
  The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN observed that with Hata's 
candidacy, 
"the antagonism between coalition parties has not been settled 
for the time being, and political instability characterized by 
political realignment is likely to continue." 
  After New Party Sakigake [Harbinger] split from its ally 
Japan New Party and pulled out of the coalition, "two poles" 
centering on the Shinseito-Komeito [Clean Government Party] bloc 
and the SDP have developed, the economic daily said. 
  It said Shinseito and the Buddhist-backed Komeito are 
devoted 
to a total overhaul of the tax system and tax hikes, which the 
NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN believes are necessary to finance the 
country's social security system. 
  The NIKKEI said it is doubtful whether the coalition will 
endorse "unconditionally" any steps the United Nations could 
take against North Korea in connection with its alleged nuclear 
weapons program. 
  "This will unavoidably narrow Japan's diplomatic range," the 
NIKKEI said. 
  "The rising tide for political realignment shows no signs of 
ebbing. Fires of change are smoldering," the YOMIURI said about 
the prospects of the coalition. It urged a "stable and strong 
government with common policy ideals and policies." 
  The YOMIURI, the nation's largest daily, said it would be 
better to make Hata's government a caretaker government to pass 
the fiscal 1994 budget, and then dissolve the House of 
Representatives for a general election. 
  The MAINICHI SHIMBUN regretted the missed opportunity for 
political realignment and the formulation of new policies which 
it anticipated from the formation of a new government. 
  "It will basically maintain the structure of the current 
coalition government," it said. 
  While urging the upcoming government to continue Hosokawa's 
reform drive, the MAINICHI doubts whether money politics will be 
rooted out. 
  "The political reforms focusing on a revival of the 
self-cleaning capacity of politics have come to an end before 
penetrating even below the surface," the MAINICHI said.

  [Text] Okayama, April 24 KYODO -- Opposition leader Yohei 
Kono criticized the ruling coalition Sunday [24 April] for 
spending its energy only on trying to maintain the alliance and 
for rotating power within the coalition. Kono, president of the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), accused the coalition's core 
party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] in particular of failing 
to take due process under parliamentary democracy. "Never lead 
Japan's politics on a wrong path," he said. [sentence as 
received] 
  Kono did not go into specifics, although he was apparently 
referring to controversies involving issues such as taxes. 
  In early February, Hosokawa announced plans to implement a 6 
trillion yen tax cut and also to replace the 3 percent 
consumption tax with a 7 percent "national welfare tax." 
  The new tax proposal, which was soon scrapped, was widely 
criticized as being hastily put out and being done abruptly in a 
closed-door meeting. 
  Kono spoke at an LDP-sponsored fund-raising event in 
Okayama, 
some 730 kilometers west of Tokyo, on the eve of the Diet's 
election Monday of Shinseito head Tsutomu Hata as Japan's new 
prime minister. 
  Hata is foreign minister in the cabinet of outgoing Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Japan's next coalition 
government will not create a new cabinet post in charge of 
coordinating economic affairs, a senior Trade Ministry official 
said Friday (922 April]. 
  The new cabinet expected to be inaugurated Monday under 
Tsutomu Hata, currently foreign minister in the government of 
outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, will drop a plan to 
have an overall economics minister, said the official at the 
International Trade and Industry Ministry (MITI), who declined 
to be identified. 
  The creation of the post was suggested as a way to 
facilitate 
formulation of stimulus and other economic packages and help 
resolve Japan's trade difficulties with the United States.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- The coalition cabinet of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned en masse on Monday 
morning after 260 days in office and 17 days after Hosokawa's 
sudden resignation announcement over financial improprieties. 
  The resignation paves the way for the election of Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, 58, as his successor in the Diet on 
Monday afternoon and formation of a second coalition government. 
Hata is assured of winning the Diet vote for prime minister due 
to the coalition's majority in both houses. 
  Hosokawa and his 20 cabinet ministers tendered their 
resignations in an emergency cabinet meeting that convened at 10 
AM [0100 GMT]. The cabinet disbandment followed Friday's 
agreement among coalition parties to push Hata as a successor to 
Hosokawa. 
  The Hosokawa administration turned out to be the sixth 
short- 
lived one in post-World War II Japanese political history after 
the cabinet of Kijuro Shidehara, who held power for 226 days in 
1945 and 1946. Hosokawa, 56, leader of the Japan New Party, 
took office on August 6 last year as the first prime minister 
from outside the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which lost its 
majority in the House of Representatives in the general election 
the previous month after a series of political scandals hit the 
LDP. He described his seven-party coalition administration as a 
"political reform government." In pursuing his avowed goal of 
cleaning up Japan's so-called "money politics," Hosokawa pushed 
a package of electoral and political reform bills through the 
Diet in January, which replaced multiseat districts in the lower 
chamber with a mix of single-seat constituencies and 
proportional representation. 
  Ironically, Hosokawa himself fell from grace after he came 
under fire over allegations that he had raised funds in dubious 
ways via a 100 million yen loan from the scandal-tainted Sagawa 
Kyubin trucking business group in 1982 and purchase of shares of 
telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. 
(NTT). Hosokawa said that he repaid the 100 million yen loan 
and dismissed any corruption charges over the NTT share 
purchase, which he stated was conducted by his late 
father-in-law. A previous scandal surrounding Sagawa Kyubin 
helped topple the LDP from power, paving the way for Hosokawa's 
alliance of conservative LDP splinter groups and traditional 
opposition parties such as the Social Democratic Party to sweep 
to power. 
  Hosokawa's public support ratings, higher than 70 percent 
immediately after he took office last August, plunged in recent 
weeks to sag below the 50 percent line in recent media polls. 
  On April 8, he made his bombshell resignation announcement, 
citing "new suspicions" over his personal finances as a major 
reason for his decision to give up the premiership and said he 
would take "moral responsibility." 
  Namio Yatsuka, an aide to Hosokawa, told reporters last 
Friday that the premier failed to report to tax authorities 
personal income of 29 million yen from stock and bond 
investments during a 10-year period from 1981.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) chairman Tomiichi Murayama said early Tuesday [26 April] 
his party has decided to leave the ruling coalition, plunging 
Japan into further political confusion. The party's decision to 
quit the alliance means that when newly elected Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata forms a government it will not command a majority 
in the powerful House of Representatives. 
  Murayama revealed the decision in a statement released to 
reporters shortly after 1 A.M. [1600 GMT]. The decision 
followed the abrupt establishment of a new 130-legislator group 
by five blocs in the lower house which excludes the SDP after 
the Diet voted Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader Hata, 58, 
as new prime minister on Monday in place of Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  The SDP, which held six cabinet posts in the Hosokawa 
government, was the largest party in the coalition with 74 
members in the lower house.

<F P=106> [News conference by Tomiichi Murayama, Social Democratic </F>
Party of Japan, SDPJ, chairman, with unidentified domestic 
reporters at SDPJ headquarters in Tokyo -- live] 
txt}[Text] [Murayama] I am going to read a comment by our 
party to make our position clear. Please listen. 
  Today, at both the House of Representatives and the House of 
Councilors sessions, we elected Mr. Hata as our 80th prime 
minister. The SDPJ made an all-out effort to elect Mr. Hata as 
prime minister. We expected a meeting of the ruling parties 
heads to be called after the election, and that Mr. Hata would 
show us a basic plan for the cabinet formation. However, we did 
not receive any calls. A meeting of the ruling coalition heads 
was called after 08:00 P.M. [1100 GMT] this evening. However, 
it was only called to change the coalition's framework, and at 
the meeting, Mr. Hata did not present a cabinet formation plan. 
  The following is what happened and what our position is: 
  1) As our party was waiting for the call to notify us of the 
meeting, preparatory work for the formation of a parliamentary 
group "Kaishin" [Innovation] within the Diet -- which is said 
to have been proposed by Japan Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] 
Chairman Ouchi to former Prime Minister Hosokawa -- secretly 
took place without consultations with the SDPJ. We found that 
the new parliamentary group made a report to the House of 
Representatives on their formation after 08:00 PM [1100 GMT]. 
In the past, the idea of forming a parliamentary group called 
"Kaikaku" [Reform] among the coalition was scrapped. In view of 
this, we believe the purpose of the formation of the new 
parliamentary group -- which is a renamed version of "Kaikaku", 
and which took place immediately after the nomination of the 
prime minister -- is to break the faith with the coalition's 
framework. We can not help feeling that there is a certain 
strategy behind such a move. 
  2) We, taking advantage of forming a new government, 
recently 
reconfirmed policies agreed upon after sharp debates by the 
coalition partners at the ruling parties heads meeting. That 
agreement was to affirm the coalition's position to take over 
the Hosokawa government's reform policies, based on an agreement 
the coalition reached last July. The agreement among the 
coalition partners is an outgrowth of the coalition's all-out 
efforts in maintaining reform policies and the Hosokawa 
government's framework. The coalition has agreed that the 
formation of the new cabinet was supposed to be discussed at a 
meeting of the ruling parties. In this sense, the fact that 
certain parties and individuals of the coalition members have 
ignored such a process and have selfishly broken the coalition's 
framework is intolerable. 
  3) The SDPJ believes that such an intentional manipulation 
of 
the coalition's framework is nothing but an attempt to increase 
the people's distrust in the politics of the new coalition 
government and cannot tolerate it. Therefore, the SDPJ cannot 
remain in the coalition. The party is now determined to promote 
reform politics with the people, and thus, it is impossible for 
us to cooperate with the new government in reshuffling the 
cabinet. However, our party is resolved to make all-out efforts 
to fulfill what we have pledged to the people, including the 
adoption of the budget bills for fiscal 1994 in an attempt to 
revive the economy. This is the SDPJ's statement. 
  [Unidentified moderator] Now reporters may ask questions. 
  [Reporter] Is there any possibility that the SDPJ will 
support the new government from outside? 
  [Murayama] Yes, there is a word of support for the cabinet 
from outside. But in fact, I am of the opinion that it will be 
difficult to do so. But as for the budget bill, which was 
proposed by the Hosokawa government, and which the SDPJ took 
part in, we will do our utmost to pass it because our party has 
a responsibility to carry out what the party has pledged. 
  [Reporter] What do you mean by certain intentional strategy? 
  [Murayama] The ruling parties originally agreed to decide on 
the nature of the coalition's framework and form a cabinet after 
coordinating policies. But other ruling parties have 
drastically changed such a framework without consulting our 
party, thus breaking the coalition's original agreement. 
Judging from this, we can clearly see that what lies behind 
their move is their intention to bisect the coalition. I 
believe that such an attempt is unpardonable in view of the 
coalition government's character that places emphasis on 
managing the government through a democratic process. 
  [Reporter] Do you mean they are trying to kick the SDPJ out 
of the coalition? 
  [Murayama] I am not sure whether it is appropriate to say 
they are tying to do so. But in short, we can clearly see that 
they are trying to control the management of the coalition by 
making use of their superior numbers. This is intolerable. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Murayama] I cannot go that far. But judging from what they 
have done, we cannot help thinking so. 
  [Reporter] Has the SDPJ's position already been conveyed to 
the prime minister? 
  [Murayama] Yes, we informed the prime minister of our 
position. 
  [Reporter] Directly to the prime minister? 
  [Murayama] Yes. 
  [Reporter] What did the prime minister say? 
  [Murayama] He repeatedly said he wants us to reconsider our 
position. But we have no time, you know. 
  [Reporter] What time did you inform him? 
  [Murayama] Immediately before I came here. 
  [Reporter] Are you going to attend a coalition party 
leaders' meeting? 
  [Murayama] No, I am not. 
  [Reporter] Is there room for discussion? 
  [Murayama] No, there is not. 
  [Reporter] Is this a decision approved by all SDPJ members? 
  [Murayama] That is right. The council, composed of three 
executives, was entrusted with the task of making decisions. I 
do not mean to say that we were entrusted with making the 
decision to secede from the coalition. However, it was too late 
at night to convene a party meeting. Also, this is something 
that could not wait until tomorrow. Therefore, we took the 
responsibility to make the decision on our own. 
  [Reporter] Did you expect this to happen? 
  [Murayama] No, we did not. 
  [Reporter] Is the SDPJ going to quit the coalition's 
decision making bodies too -- including representatives' 
meeting, the policy executive council, and the tax system 
research council? 
  [Murayama] That is right. 
  [Reporter] Can you explain how you felt before making the 
decision? 
  [Murayama] We were unable to have budget deliberations for 
more than two weeks. However, we did not waste time during that 
period. We had serious discussions and agreed to form a better 
administration. We united our party and did our best to approve 
Mr. Hata as prime minister in both the upper and lower houses. 
However, I was told that a party leaders' meeting might be held 
at around 4:00 [0700 GMT] immediately after the prime minister 
was elected. I was waiting for it at the Diet members' office 
building. But, the party leaders' meeting started around 2000 
[1100 GMT] without informing me. Notification of the new 
parliamentary group's formation was completed immediately before 
holding the party leaders' meeting. They held the meeting after 
completing all the necessary procedures for formation of the 
parliamentary group. Formation of the group will change the 
framework of the coalition and it is goes against the promise we 
made with each other. They did not keep the promise. We 
thought the coalition government would not function well if such 
a thing should happen often. We tried to talk with them, but it 
was too late because notification of the new group's formation 
had already taken place. Under such circumstances, we gave the 
matter careful consideration and unanimously agreed that the 
secession was unavoidable. 
  [Reporter] Are you planning to call for a general election 
after approving the draft budget? 
  [Murayama] We have not thought that far. We have to see how 
the situation will change. 
  [Coordinator] One more question, please. 
  [Reporter] What about the coalition platform? Is it invalid 
now? 
  [Murayama] This is an agreement we made at the time of 
forming the coalition government. We will not be restricted by 
it because we are going to secede from the coalition government. 
  [Reporter] Can we say that the SDPJ will split from the 
coalition rather than saying that it will cooperate with the 
government from outside the cabinet? 
  [Murayama] That is right. 
  [Reporter] Do you feel angry, mortified, or betrayed? 
  [Murayama] What? 
  [Reporter] Do you feel angry, mortified, or ... 
  [Murayama interrupting] What are you talking about? This is 
not an emotional issue. The coalition government was formed on 
the basis of mutual trust. It will not function well if there 
is no trust. Under such a circumstance, we are just not 
confident that we can steer the coalition government well. 
Therefore, we came to the conclusion that we should split from 
it.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- The following are main 
points of a statement issued by Social Democratic Party Chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama: 
  -- The SDP did its utmost to secure the election of Tsutomu 
Hata as prime minister of Japan. 
  -- We expected Hata to convene a meeting of leaders of the 
coalition parties and express the basic position of a new 
cabinet. But no such request was made. 
  -- While we were waiting, secret preparations were made to 
establish a new unified parliamentary group "Kaishin" 
(Innovation) without consulting the SDP. 
  -- The establishment of the new group infringes the 
relationship of trust among the coalition parties. 
  -- After intensive discussions, we signed the coalition 
policy accord just prior to the establishment of a new 
government. This was the result of sincere efforts we had made 
from the standpoint of continuing the reform policies launched 
by the Hosokawa cabinet and of maintaining the framework of the 
coalition. 
  -- It was agreed upon that a change in the formation of the 
government must be discussed among coalition parties. It is 
unpardonable for specific parties or individuals to ignore those 
processes and destroy the framework arbitrarily. 
  -- The SDP cannot permit such arbitrary maneuvering by a new 
coalition government which amplifies the sense of distrust among 
the people in politics. Therefore, the SDP cannot remain as a 
member of the coalition, is determined to promote political 
reform together with the people, and cannot respond to calls for 
formation of a new cabinet. However, we will make every effort 
to help the economy recover, including the enactment of the 
fiscal 1994 budget as promised.

  [Text]- The announcement came several hours after the 
socialists cast their ballots for Hata in a prime ministerial 
nomination vote in both chambers of the Diet. 
  Hata swept to power on the strength of 274 votes in the 
lower 
house, defeating Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  The SDP, with 74 members in the lower house, held six 
cabinet 
posts in the government of Morihiro Hosokawa, Hata's predecessor 
as premier. 
  The strength of the coalition excluding the SDP stands at 
182 
seats, compared with the 206 of the LDP in the 511-seat lower 
house. 
  Asked by a reporter whether the SDP will withdraw support 
for 
a policy platform accord inked on April 22 by the seven 
coalition partners, Murayama replied, "We will no longer be 
bound by the agreement." The agreement calls for cooperation in 
such key policy fields as the proposed imposition of a new 
indirect tax and Japan's response to the issue of Pyongyang's 
suspected development of nuclear weapons. 
  The accord followed two weeks of tough coalition 
horse-trading designed to reconcile sharp differences in key 
policy fields, a prerequisite for launching a new coalition 
government. 
  "It is outrageous for a certain political party or an 
individual to have destroyed the current combination of 
coalition parties while ignoring the process of the 
accord-building," Murayama said, apparently referring to the 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]-led conservative mainstream. 
  The sudden flare-up of a coalition standoff delayed the 
formation of a new cabinet by Hata, who was expected to announce 
his new ministers Monday [25 April] evening. The coalition 
stripped the LDP of its 38-year lock on power last August. 
  The new parliamentary caucus, named "Kaishin (Innovation)," 
comprises Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Japan New Party, 
and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), as well as two 
splinter groups that recently defected from the LDP -- the 
Liberal Party and Kaikaku no Kai. 
  Including former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi, an LDP 
rebel who is now an independent, the parliamentary strength of 
the new group is 130, dwarfing the SDP's 74 seats. 
  The SDP apparently perceives the sudden convergence of five 
political blocs as a move aimed at accomplishing a proposal by 
the Shinseito-led conservative mainstream to create a new 
unified party, political analysts said. 
  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and his Komeito 
[Clean Government Party] counterpart Yuichi Ichikawa originally 
proposed such a convergence to defeat the LDP in an upcoming 
general election under the newly-legislated electoral system, 
which has introduced a mix of single-seat constituencies and 
proportional representation. 
  The move suddenly gathered momentum when DSP Chairman Keigo 
Ouchi told party legislators the coalition parties should 
initiate such a parliamentary group to create a "firm support 
base" for the Hata administration. The DSP leader was earlier 
one of the chief critics of such a move. 
  Ouchi later told a news conference, "The reason why we have 
to establish the parliamentary group to back the new prime 
minister is to facilitate the implementation of the nine-point 
policy platform agreed upon by the coalition parties." 
  Ouchi also said, "We need to consolidate the parliamentary 
base to support the prime minister and we put together parties 
that could quickly agree to the convergence as it is hard to 
enlist all the parties immediately into the new group." 
  The new parliamentary group "Kaishin" also plans to entice 
Komeito with 52 lower chamber legislators into its folds, 
coalition sources said. 
  In a related development, Ouchi told reporters that the 
coalition partners will appeal to the SDP to drop its decision 
to leave the coalition. 
  The selection of new cabinet ministers will follow a meeting 
of the leaders of coalition parties, who will start their 
discussions on Tuesday morning. Ozawa, leaving the premier's 
official residence in a limousine, told reporters he and other 
coalition leaders will assemble at 10 A.M. [0100 GMT] to discuss 
the situation.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- The Social Democratic 
Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] formally 
decided to leave the ruling coalition at an emegency meeting of 
its central executive committee on Tuesday [26 April] morning, 
party officials said. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama earlier Tuesday had announced 
that the largest party in the coalition would quit the alliance, 
leaving it without a majority in parliament. Murayama revealed 
the decision following a meeting of key SDP leaders. 
  The SDP pulled out to protest the abrupt establishment of a 
new parliamentary group "Kaishin" by five groups including 
Shinseito, headed by new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  Murayama said he is willing to hold talks with Prime 
Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, who started wooing the SDP back to the alliance 
immediately after the party broke ranks with the ruling 
coalition. 
  In a TV program, Murayama said, ''I am ready to talk (with 
Hata),'' if the newly elected premier seeks a meeting. 
  But he nevertheless reiterated that the SDP has no plan to 
rescind its decision to part with the other coalition partners 
after the party was infuriated with the move to form a new 
parliamentary bloc. 
  ''Unless the prime minister demonstrates stronger leadership 
and offers 'evidence' that they have mended their ways (of 
handling Diet affairs), the same thing will happen again,'' he 
said. 
  The party has no intention of changing its decision to quit 
the coalition, he said. 
  The SDP chief showed a clear eagerness to seek alliance with 
new party Sakigake [Harbinger], which earlier decided against 
joining the Hata administration while providing some legislative 
support. 
  ''We have had good cooperation since we were in the 
coalition 
in efforts to check the dual power structure (within the 
coalition).'' 
  ''I believe we can further deepen our ties and join forces 
to 
set Japanese politics on the right course,'' he said. 
  Murayama did not rule out the possibility of a snap election 
for the House of Represetatives, while sounding cautious about 
seeking that course of action. 
  "It would be better not to create a political vacuum under 
the current economic conditions," he said. "But we should make 
a decision on that issue after carefully assessing the entire s 
ate of affairs." 
  Meanwhile, SDP members of both houses of the Diet met and 
endorsed the decision by the party's policy-making board to walk 
out of the coalition. 
  At the meeting, Murayama called for unity among the party 
members. 
  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and some other coalition 
partners "want to see the SDP split up. Let us unite to guard 
against that," he said.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video followed by live relay; </F>
from the "NHK News" program] 
  [Text] Here is the reaction of Diet members from the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which decided to leave the 
coalition government early this morning: 
  [Begin recording] [Koken Nosaka, chairman of SDPJ Diet 
Affairs Committee] We need to have a new sense of courage and 
determination to face this difficult situation. It might be 
tough, but if we fail to overcome this hardship, we will not be 
able to meet the people's expectations. 
  [House of Councillors member Hajime Fukada] I think we have 
the overwhelming support of the local chapters. Those who have 
been distressed by the problems of the coalition in one way or 
another have finally come to the end of their patience. I think 
[SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi] Murayama's decision is in line with the 
sentiments of our local activists. 
  [House of Representatives member Masao Sakon] I think it is 
a 
matter of course that Mr. Murayama should express such 
indignation. What he did is good as an impulsive reaction to the 
immediate situation, but we have to take the future outlook into 
consideration and act carefully from now on. [end recording] 
  Here is a live relay from the Diet building on the SDPJ's 
reaction: 
  [NHK political reporter Mikihiko Inoue] The SDPJ held an 
emergency meeting of its Central Executive Committee for nearly 
one hour at the Diet building from 0930 [0030 GMT] this morning. 
As a result, the committee unanimously endorsed the decision by 
Chairman Murayama and two other top party executives early this 
morning to leave the coalition. It also reconfirmed the SDPJ's 
policy of not participating in any policymaking or 
decisionmaking meetings of the coalition government. Therefore, 
both Chairman Murayama and SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo 
did not attend the party leaders' meeting going on right now at 
the prime minister's official residence, which was convened by 
the heads of the other ruling coalition parties which formed the 
new parliamentary group "Kaishin" yesterday. Murayama returned 
to SDPJ headquarters after the emergency Central Executive 
Committee meeting ended to talk with officials of labor unions 
supporting the SDPJ. 
  This morning, the biggest right wing faction in the SDPJ, 
the 
"Democrats" also held a general meeting. During the meeting, 
the participants expressed the following opinions: The 
high-handed political methods of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
and the other parties are unacceptable; the SDPJ cannot possibly 
return to the existing coalition framework; and the party must 
seek new ways to win political power. Thus, the "Democrats" 
group has also affirmed its support of the party leadership's 
decision. 
  The SDPJ is scheduled to hold a general meeting of its 
members of the lower and upper house at 1300 today to reconfirm 
the party leadership's decision to leave the coalition. The 
party leadership is also planning to hold a national meeting as 
soon as possible to obtain the local chapters' support of its 
decision. As of now, there is no possibility for the SDPJ to 
revise its decision to leave the coalition. This ends the 
report from the Diet building.

  [Text] Masayoshi Takemura, head of Sakigake [Harbinger], 
which has indicated an intention to not take posts in the Hata 
administration but to support it, criticized the political 
techniques of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and other parties, 
which have moved to form a new parliamentary group. 
  [Begin Takemura recording] I saw [Social Democratic Party of 
Japan] Chairman Murayama conveying the tragic resolution on a TV 
program last night. Frankly speaking, I felt sympathy for him. 
Unless they pursue politics in a faithful or trustworthy manner, 
or more simply, in a good manner, they will lose the people's 
trust in politics. [end recording] 
  Now, the reaction of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. 
  [Begin recording] [LDP President Yohei Kono] I think 
Sakigake 
as well as the SDPJ have felt that this political technique is 
wrong. But because this is a matter of political methods, they 
will naturally reach an agreement on political techniques. I 
mean they will agree on the techniques they should not adopt. 
  [LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori] The current situation 
amounts to a state of anarchy. We are angry about this 
situation, rather than anxious. [end recording] 
  Also, LDP's Michio Watanabe said: 
  [Begin recording] [NHK Reporter] The SDPJ perceives the move 
as a betrayal to the party. 
  [Watanabe] I do not understand why they think so. Is that 
move not a plot to form a single parliamentary group among the 
ruling parties? Usually, the notice of forming a parliamentary 
group is submitted before the prime ministerial election. It 
was unusual that they submitted the notice after the election. 
  [NHK Reporter] How do you think things will develop from now 
on? 
  [Watanabe] I do not know. If the ruling coalition decides to 
urgently form the new cabinet, they may leave posts to be filled 
by SDPJ members unoccupied and persuade the SDPJ to return to 
the coalition during the Golden Week holiday season. Or, they 
may try to entice some SDPJ members or LDP members who have 
adopted the same political stance into the coalition. [end

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- The Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) on Tuesday urged the ruling coalition to hand over 
power to the opposition camp led by the LDP. 
  The LDP said in a statement that the ruling parties are to 
blame for the current situation of "political anarchy." 
  The statement, adopted at a meeting of all LDP members in 
the 
House of Representatives, expressed sympathy with the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP), which declared early Tuesday that it is 
quitting the coalition. 
  "The LDP, as a similar parliamentary political party, can 
understand the SDP's firm stand to bloc high-handed political 
management," the statement said. 
  Meanwhile, LDP President Yohei Kono told reporters that a 
major change has emerged in the coalition, saying "an insincere 
act was done to a coalition member." 
  "Is it okay to entrust the future of the people to such an 
insincere government which employs high-handed political 
methods? We cannot help but answer 'no'," Kono said. 
  The LDP joined the opposition camp last August after 38 
years 
of uninterrupted rule.

unidentified correspondents in front of the prime minister's 
official residence, in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] The current situation seems to be 
extremely abnormal because at the very start of your assumption 
of the post, the administration's foundation has begun to break 
down. Concerning the abrupt formation of a new parliamentary 
group, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] regarded it 
as clearly an intentional action, disclosed its opposition, and 
announced its decision to break away from the coalition this 
evening. First of all, would you explain how you feel about 
this series of incidents? 
  [Hata] Yes. Since I was elected the new prime minister at 
the sessions of both houses today, I originally intended to 
organize the cabinet as soon as possible. However, it is a 
matter of regret that SDPJ Chairman Murata came to see me and 
that during our talks, he told me that he personally thinks the 
creation of the new group -- Kaishin [Reformation] -- is an 
abuse of confidence and, as a result, he would like to have 
consultations with his party. 
  And then, after midnight -- at about 0130 or around 0100 -- 
he gave me a phone call, saying that he had talked to each of 
them and that each felt -- though it is regrettable -- that it 
is an abuse of confidence. Therefore, he said if the situation 
should remain unchanged, his party will not be able to go along 
as a member of the ruling coalition parties. He said that 
though it is a matter of regret, it is what he wanted to inform 
me. 
  Nevertheless, as far as I am concerned, I feel that what he 
has told me was exactly what they had talked over within their 
party. But I was nominated as prime minister through voting by 
various parties. I am determined, in my position, to carry out 
my duties with their cooperation, and I requested that further 
talks be held. However, the fact is that he informed me of their 
decision after fairly thorough discussions, and then, 10 or 20 
minutues later, the announcement was made. We regret it very 
much. 
  [Correspondent] Concerning this concept of creating a new 
parliamentary group today, Mr. Prime Minister, did you know that 
it was included in today's schedule? 
  [Hata] No. I heard that a notice for the group's formation 
was made at 2000 [1100 GMT] tonight, but I did not know that it 
would be done today. At any rate, as I have stated on various 
occasions, such as on television programs or in my interviews 
with you, when I review the past eight months of my work under 
the Hosokawa administration, I would give a high appraisal of 
the work done by each party since each had to overcome various 
difficulties. 
  However, the point at issue lies in the fact that we could 
not discuss various problems among ourselves, but these issues 
had to be taken back to their parties for discussion. Under 
such a situation, I feel that it will be a serious problem 
because it will take much time to deal with the difficult 
problems we will have to handle in the future, and, moreover, we 
may not be able to take concerted action. In this sense, I have 
stated that it would be desirable to have two major forces in 
the true sense of the word. And if this cannot be done in one 
stroke, it would be desirable that in the process of creating 
something like a parliamentary group, the two major forces form 
gradually in the future. To tell the truth, this is what I have 
stated recently on television programs, and I have also stated 
that efforts should be made to this end. 
  [Correspondent] However, the SDPJ maintains that it is an 
abuse of confidence. What do you think of this point? 
  [Hata] Speaking of an abuse of confidence, I was watching 
television just now, and the action seems to have been 
interpreted as being aimed at driving away the SDPJ. As is 
known to you all, I feel...[changes thought] For example, when 
the name of Mr. Michio Watanabe was mentioned and when I felt 
that the idea was to exclude the SDPJ, I stated that since the 
SDPJ had so far made efforts to deal with various issues, plans 
should be worked out on the basis of maintaining the framework 
of ruling coalition parties. Therefore, I do not think it is 
right for the SDPJ to say that we betrayed them. 
  Moreover, concerning the creation of this group, Mr. Ouchi 
and Mr. Hosokawa have stated their views. And, regarding the 
result of the action, it does not mean that the group will 
include only those who have gathered here. An appeal will be 
made to several other political parties -- or should I say all 
parties -- to join us, and in fact that appeal has actually been 
made. In this connection, this does not involve an abuse of 
confidence. For example, a parliamentary group was once formed 
by the Japan New Party and Shinto Sakigake [Harbinger], and we 
have stated different views on this group. However, no one has 
ever mentioned an abuse of confidence. In this connection, I 
would say there must be some misunderstanding. This is what I 
feel now. 
  [Correspondent] My next question concerns the schedules 
for tomorrow and after. For the time being, you have given up 
the idea of forming the new cabinet tonight. What plans do you 
have for tomorrow and afterward? 
  [Hata] The situation now is that it was at about 2100 or 
2130 
that Mr. Murayama left here, and then he did not return here, 
rather the announcement was made. In this sense, there are 
questions as to how this result has been brought about and what 
discussions were carried out by the SDPJ. All parties, that is 
all other ruling coalition parties, have not gathered yet to 
talk about these questions. In this connection, I think all of 
us will probably get together to have discussions among the 
various parties tomorrow. Meanwhile, I will get in touch with 
other leading membes of our party, and I have been talking with 
leaders of other parties who were here just now. And I think it 
is important to tell the SDPJ our true intention. Therefore, I 
think the first thing I will do tomorrow is to have candid 
discussions with the SDPJ and try to ask them to remain in the 
coalition government. 
  [Correspondent] Does it mean, Mr. Prime Minister, that you 
will have talks with Chairman Murayama yourself? 
  [Hata] Of course, I will have to meet personally with Mr. 
Murayama, and I am ready to have talks with him at any time. 
Just now, I had talks -- what shall I say -- not with stinging 
words, with Mr. Murayama, but he told me frankly that the 
decision was made, though it was regrettable. However, I told 
him that maybe a little more time should be spent on discussing 
this issue. In reply, he told me that the decision was made 
after thorough discussions. And someone else told me just now: 
Mr. Hata, it is a matter of regret but Chairman Murata just left 
for a news conference. And when I asked him whether it would be 
possible to hold out a little longer, he told me that the 
chairman had actually left. My conversation with these two 
persons was not at all talk with stingy words. 
  Therefore, first of all talks will have to be held among 
various political parties on the reason why the action was seen 
as an abuse of confidence. And if necessary, I will be ready to 
hold as many talks as called for. And we would like to appeal 
for further talks. And since ours is a coalition government, it 
involves many difficulties. However, I have never given up on 
the idea that there still remain chances for further talks. 
  [Correspondent] However, if the SDPJ does not change its 
original intention, the Hata administration will probably be 
forced to run state affairs as a minority administration. 
  [Hata] Since one party has disclosed its decision in such a 
way, there is a possibility that the situation will turn out as 
you have just pointed out. However, since we will continue to 
make efforts, I would like to refrain from making any prediction 
in saying such and such actions will be taken. 
  [Correspondent] In that case, what will be the time limit? 
  [Hata] Talking about the time limit, we are going to have 
consecutive holidays soon. If actions should not be taken 
before these holidays, the situation will probably become rather 
unstable. I would not like to set any time limit at this 
moment. However, I hope some sort of an orientation can be 
worked out as soon as possible. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, I think there must be 
change in the scheduling of Diet sessions, including your policy 
speech scheduled to be delivered tomorrow. Faced with the 
consecutive May holidays drawing near, what is your prospect for 
the scheduling? 
  [Hata] I did not expect this situation. But the scheduling 
for the Diet sessions has to be decided. I cannot make any 
clear scheduling of the Diet sessions now because we have to see 
what the situation will be. Other ruling parties are supposed 
to hold a meeting here at 1000 tomorrow morning, and at the 
meeting I want to consult with them on how to deal with the 
issue. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, I remember you 
previously 
saying that politics that cannot win the people's understanding 
is not politics. Do you think that what is happening now is 
understandable to the people? 
  [Hata] Frankly speaking, to avoid the people's 
misunderstanding, I want to stress that the coalition is formed 
by groups who have their own political backgrounds and policies. 
Unlike that of other nations, the coalition government in Japan 
is just eight months old, and there may be criticism of the 
coalition for delays in making quick actions. But since the 
coalition, formed after exchanges of sharp debates among its 
members, has made a fresh start amid a new trend in the world, I 
intend to always explain the status of the situation as much as 
possible to win the people's further understanding. Television 
programs are increasingly regarding me as a common person. My 
policy is that I always try to put my political activities on 
the common people's level. As I said earlier, I want the people 
to understand that the coalition is just eight months old, 
during which time it has had to overcome many difficult issues. 
I think that in that process, cooperative ties and mutual 
understanding among the coalition parties have been further 
deepened, and even when I talked to heads of the ruling parties 
such as SDPJ Chairman Murayama as well as secretaries general, I 
reaffirmed the cooperative relations among the ruling parties. 
But now, I strongly feel that although the coalition partners 
have so far cleared many hurdles, there is still difficulty in 
getting along with each other. I think within the SDPJ there 
must have been various opinions on how to form the coalition. 
Despite this, members of the SDPJ voted for me, and I cannot 
forget their support and hope to keep it in mind. 
  [Correspondent] I want to reconfirm that you are still eager 
to manage the government beginning tomorrow while maintaining 
the current framework which the SDPJ joins, are you not? 
  [Hata] We would like the SDPJ to stop thinking that we are 
betraying it. The coalition partners have agreed on policies by 
putting in many hours of discussions on such policy 
coordination. In view of this, I want to make all-out efforts 
to the end to ask the SDPJ to remain in the coalition. I think 
this is what politics should be. 
  [Correspondent] So, you want to form the cabinet tomorrow? 
  [Hata] Yes, I intend to do my utmost to do so.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- The departure of the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) from the ruling coalition is 
expected to make it extremely hard for the new administration of 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to steadily carry out economic 
policies. SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama said his party will do 
whatever it can to enact the fiscal 1994 national budget when he 
said at a news conference early Tuesday [26 April] morning that 
the party will leave the coalition. 
  However, rough going is expected in Diet deliberations on 
the 
budget, political sources said. 
  Murayama told reporters the SDP will consider a recent 
coalition agreement on tax reform, including a hike in indirect 
tax, "with a clean slate." 
  This indicates discussions on tax reform may hit a snag, 
making it difficult for the Hata administration to pass the 1994 
budget bill through the Diet before the July summit of the Group 
of Seven economic powers in Naples, Italy, political analysts 
said. 
  They forecast the SDP may be strongly opposed to a hike in 
the 3 percent consumption tax to finance 6 trillion yen worth of 
cuts in income and residential taxes for the current fiscal year.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Opposition leader Yohei 
Kono said early Tuesday [26 April] the coalition's core party 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] has shown its true character. 
  "The departure of the Social Democratic Party from the 
coalition is a matter of course," said Kono, president of the 
Liberal Democratic Party. "I have repeatedly pointed out that 
Shinseito-led management of political affairs is high-handed. 
Shinseito revealed its true character after the election of its 
party head (Tsutomu Hata)," Kono said. 
  Asked if the LDP will pursue any links with the SDP, Kono 
replied it is too early to talk about that.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- A top opposition lawmaker 
said Tuesday [26 April] the ruling coalition is as good as dead 
and displayed interest in possible talks with the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- 
SDPJ] which just quit the coalition. 
  "The ruling coalition has virtually collapsed. Their power 
game...has failed," Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), said at a meeting of party executives, 
according to party officials. 
  Kono also told reporters the LDP is willing to hold talks 
with the SDP or new party Sakigake [Harbinger], which were both 
key components of the coalition, if they can agree over the 
modus operandi of politics. 
  "I would like to see what stance the two parties take, but 
if 
they think the same way as we do on how to do politics, we can 
have talks." 
  The SDP walked out of the coalition early Tuesday after it 
was enraged by a move by other coalition partners to form a new 
parliamentary bloc. The party's withdrawal stripped the 
coalition of its majority in the key House of Representatives. 
  LDP executives met in the morning to discuss how they should 
handle the renewed political turmoil, and decided to put up a 
united front to cope with the situation. 
  Kono made clear the LDP will capitalize on the confusion to 
regain the ruling status. 
  "The time has come for a showdown," he said at the meeting. 
  But he warned against expected moves from the newly-elected 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata or his coalition partners to lure 
away some LDP lawmakers to secure a Diet majority. 
  Kono criticized Shinseito, headed by Hata, for its "forcible 
way" of handling Diet business. 
  "It is not a true form of democracy that places importance 
on 
process," he said. 
  The surprise move among conservative and centrist coalition 
members to form a new bloc is widely believed to have been 
masterminded by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, a top 
coalition strategist and a self-acknowledged behind-the-scenes 
negotiator. 
  Another LDP leader made a more articulate call for an 
alliance with the disillusioned SDP. 
  LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said, "the current 
situation is tantamount to anarchy. I am infuriated." 
  "Let us keep close contact with the SDP," he told the 
party's 
top brass.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- The Social Democratic 
Party [of Japan's, SDPJ's] (SDP)'s breaking of ranks with the 
ruling coalition early Tuesday [26 April] threw Japan into 
political chaos, raising the specter of an early snap general 
election. The prospect loomed after the Diet voted Monday 
afternoon to sweep Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader 
Tsutomu Hata, 58, to power to replace Morihiro Hosokawa, 56, 
with the help of the SDP. 
  The SDP, the largest contingent in the coalition, was 
subsequently angered at an abrupt move by the Shinseito-led 
conservative mainstream to form a new 130-legislator unified 
parliamentary bloc in the House of Representatives, excluding 
the SDP. 
  The SDP's pullout from the coalition, if it goes ahead, 
would 
strip the new Hata administration of a governing majority, 
rendering it to a fragile minority government. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters at a predawn 
news conference it "cannot forgive the rest of the coalition," 
which he said pushed the moves toward convergence while keeping 
the SDP in the dark. 
  The new five-way parliamentary bloc, called Kaishin 
(Innovation), comprises Shinseito, the Democratic Socialist 
Party (DSP), Hosokawa's Japan New Party, the Liberal Party and 
the Kaikaku no Kai, both breakaways of the major opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Murayama criticized the 
formation of the new parliamentary bloc as destroying the 
coalition structure and a "betrayal" of the SDP. 
  The Liberal Party was established in mid-April by seven 
rebels who left the LDP to support veteran LDP politician Michio 
Watanabe's aborted attempt to seek the premiership. The party 
did not sign a policy platform agreed upon last Friday by the 
coalition heads for forming a new government. 
"It is outrageous for a certain political party or individual 
to have destroyed the current combination of coalition parties 
while ignoring the process of accord-building," Murayama said 
apparently referring to Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro 
Ozawa, the chief coalition strategist. 
  The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) urged the ruling 
coalition 
to hand over power to the opposition camp led by the LDP. 
  "The LDP, as a similar parliamentary political party, can 
understand the SDP's firm stand to bloc high-handed political 
management," the statement said. 
  LDP President Yohei Kono hinted that the party is ready to 
step up cooperation with the SDP and new party Sakigake 
[Harbinger]. Sakigake, a 15-legislator coalition party in the 
Hosokawa government, has pledged not to take a cabinet post in a 
new government so as to distance itself from the dominant 
Shinseito and Komeito. 
  The strength of the coalition without the SDP stands at 182 
seats, compared with the 206 held by the LDP in the 511-seat 
lower house. The SDP, which had six cabinet posts in the 
Hosokawa government, has 74 members in the lower house. 
  Leaders of the ruling coalition agreed that Hata should urge 
Murayama to hold talks, coalition officials said. However, 
Murayama failed to respond to Hata's call, party officials said. 
  The leaders also agreed to maintain the present coalition 
framework and not to exclude the SDP from the coalition, 
coalition officials said. DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi said he is 
ready to ask other coalition partners to disband the new 
parliamentary bloc if that could convince the SDP to reverse its 
decision. 
  The SDP endorsed the decision by top executives to walk out 
of the coalition at an emergency meeting of its Central 
Executive Committee on Tuesday morning and SDP members of both 
houses of the Diet backed the decision. 
  At the meeting of SDP Diet members, Murayama called for 
unity 
among the party members. Shinseito and some other coalition 
partners "want to see the SDP split up. Let us unite to guard 
against that," he said. 
  Murayama said in a news conference early Tuesday his party 
will cooperate to pass the state budget for fiscal 1994, which 
started April 1, through the Diet. Parliamentary budget debates 
have not begun since the government submitted it in early March. 
  Murayama, however, said his party will no longer be bound by 
the policy platform, which includes tax system reform. 
  A weak coalition government could face upheavals after the 
budget's passage, paving the way for a possible general 
election, political analysts said. 
  In a TV program, Murayama did not rule out the possibility 
of 
a lower house snap election, while sounding cautious about the 
move. 
  The Diet enacted in January a package of political and 
electoral reform bills that replaces the lower chamber's 
multiseat constituency system with a combination of single-seat 
constituencies and proportional representation to clean up the 
political system. 
  A bill to demarcate single-seat electoral districts under 
the 
new system has not been drafted, and if a general election is 
held under the current multiseat system, the coalition's efforts 
in political reform will be damaged, political analysts said. 
  The SDP withdrawl from the coalition is also expected to 
undermine Japan's efforts to soften its trade dispute with the 
United States, political analysts said. 
  The policy platform vowed the government will decide by the 
end of June on thorough tax reform that emphasizes an indirect 
tax rate hike and reduced direct taxes. The government has also 
pledged to unveil an additional package of market-opening 
measures before the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrial 
nations meet in Italy in July. 
  Japan's often-stated readiness to take fiscal measures to 
boost demand for imports is deemed a virtual international 
promise to cut income taxes to give consumers greater purchasing 
power.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Newly elected Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata failed to launch a cabinet Monday [25 
April] after the abrupt formation of a new 130-legislator 
parliamentary group enraged the largest party in the coalition, 
coalition officials said. 
  The unexpected development has delayed until after Tuesday 
the inauguration of a new government. 
  The intracoalition standoff delayed the process of forming a 
new cabinet and the subsequent imperial attestation ceremony at 
the Imperial Palace in the presence of Emperor Akihito, they 
said. 
  Hata said in a telephone message Monday night to Eiichi 
Nakamura, representative of the Democratic Reform Party, a small 
political party in the House of Councillors affiliated with 
Japan's largest trade union organization, the Japanese Trade 
Union Confederation (Rengo), that he will complete the formation 
of his new cabinet by the early hours of Tuesday. 
  Hata also said he would have to make fairly major 
alterations 
in the personnel lineup of the cabinet of former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, which resigned en masse Monday morning. 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP), with 74 members in the 
House of Representatives, reacted strongly to the sudden 
establishment of the new parliamentary group in the lower house, 
from which it is excluded. 
  Coalition dissension intensified a few hours after the Diet 
voted Shinseito leader Hata, 58, as new prime minister in place 
of Hosokawa.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Newly elected Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata early Tuesday regretted the decision by 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP) to leave the governing 
coalition and appealed to the party to give up the decision. 
  However, Hata defended the formation of the 130-legislator 
parliamentary group which excludes the SDP, the largest party in 
the coalition, drawing the latter's ire, saying, "The formation 
does not constitute any betrayal" of the socialists. 
  In a press interview at the prime minister's official 
residence, Hata said such a parliamentary convergence is 
necessary to enable Japan to deal with the difficult times 
ahead, explaining, "unless we have such a group, coalition 
parties will not be able to cope with the difficult problems and 
act in solidarity."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Newly elected Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata called Tuesday on Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] Chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama to meet him, in a last-ditch effort to 
persuade the SDP to stay in the coalition. 
  However, Hata indicated to reporters that he seeks to form a 
new cabinet Tuesday even without the SDP, saying, "we cannot 
spend so much time." 
  A coalition government without the SDP would be a minority 
one. 
  There are also moves going on to entice elements of the 
largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) into the 
coalition, political sources said. 
  Leaders of the ruling coalition met at the prime minister's 
official residence to discuss the SDP's decision to quit the 
alliance and decided that Hata should urge Murayama to hold 
talks, coalition officials said. 
  An emergency meeting of the SDP's Central Executive 
Committee 
Tuesday morning endorsed a decision taken earlier in the day by 
its top officials to quit the coalition, party officials said. 
The SDP was the largest party in the coalition. 
  Murayama announced at a hastily arranged news conference 
after a meeting by top executives that the party decided to 
leave the alliance because it cannot approve of an abrupt move 
by some coalition partners to establish a new 130-legislator 
parliamentary group in the House of Representatives, which 
excludes the SDP. 
  The new parliamentary caucus, named "Kaishin (innovation)," 
was formed hours after Hata was elected prime minister by the 
Diet on Monday afternoon. 
  It comprises Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Japan New 
Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), as well as two 
splinter groups that recently defected from the LDP -- the 
Liberal Party and Kaikaku No Kai. 
  The Liberal Party was established by seven rebels who left 
the LDP to support veteran LDP politician Michio Watanabe's 
aborted attempt to seek the premiership. The party did not sign 
a policy platform agreed upon last Friday by the coalition heads 
for forming a new government. 
  Murayama criticized the formation of the new parliamentary 
bloc as destroying the coalition structure. 
  "It is outrageous for a certain political party or an 
individual to have destroyed the current combination of 
coalition parties while ignoring the process of the 
accord-building," Murayama said, apparently referring to 
Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, the chief coalition 
strategist. 
  The strength of the coalition excluding the SDP stands at 
182 
seats, compared with the 206 of the LDP in the 511-seat lower 
house. 
  The SDP, which held six cabinet posts in the government of 
Morihiro Hosokawa, Hata's predecessor as premier, has 74 members 
in the lower house. 
  New party Sakigake [Harbinger], which has 15 members in the 
lower house, has refused to join the new parliamentary group. 
Sakigake, led by Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary in 
the Hosokawa cabinet, voted for Hata in the Diet but has vowed 
not to take a cabinet post. 
  Hata's policy speech to the Diet scheduled for Tuesday 
afternoon was postponed because of the delay of forming the new 
cabinet, Diet officials said. 
  The seven-party coalition government led by Hosokawa forced 
the LDP out of its 38-year-old grip on power last August.

<F P=106> [Dialogue between NHK correspondent Fujimori and Newscaster </F>
Yoshiaki Kawabata -- live; from the "NHK News 7" program] 
  [Text] [Kawabata] I will now speak with reporter Fujimori 
who is reporting from the prime minister's official residence. 
  Mr. Fujimori, what is happening at the prime minister's 
official residence? 
  [Fujimori] Leaders of the ruling coalition parties are now 
assembling at the prime minister's official residence, and they 
will soon hold a meeting to discuss ways to deal with the 
present political situation. The leaders of the ruling 
coalition parties in their meeting this morning confirmed the 
need to continue efforts to persuade the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan [SDPJ] to remain in the coalition. Later, in the 
afternoon, Prime Minister Hata called SDPJ chairman Murayama to 
ask the latter for talks, but chairman Murayama told the prime 
minister he had no intention of complying with his request for 
talks. Chairman Murayama is believed to have concluded there 
are no prospects for breaking the deadlock over the SDPJ's 
breakaway from the coalition through talks, unless extraordinary 
changes have occured since the SDPJ broke away from the 
coalition after the Central Executive Committee and a meeting of 
members from the both houses of the Diet decided that the SDPJ 
should quit the coalition. Chairman Murayama returned to his 
home at 1600 [0700 GMT] this afternoon, and there seem to be no 
prospects for talks between him and Prime Minister Hata. The 
leaders of the ruling coalition parties will discuss how to deal 
with the issue of the SDPJ's breakaway from the coalition. 
  [Kawabata] Just now, former Prime Minister Hosokawa can be 
seen entering the prime minister's official residence. The SDPJ 
is still taking a tough stand. Mr. Fujimori, what sort of other 
options do the ruling coalition parties have? 
  [Fujimori] The ruling coalition parties intend to continue 
to 
try to persuade the SDPJ to remain in the coalition. If the 
SDPJ continues to reject the persuasion, and refuse to remain in 
the coalition, the leaders of the ruling coalition parties will 
have to form a new cabinet without the SDPJ. The ruling 
coalition parties will become a minority in the Diet. The ruling 
coalition parties have 182 seats in the House of Representatives 
and their seats are far less than those held by the Liberal 
Democratic Party. Meanwhile, the ruling coalition parties hold 
62 seats in the House of Councillors, only one-fourth of the 
majority. With those seats in the Diet, the ruling coalition 
parties would be unable to get any bills to pass in the Diet if 
the LDP and the SDPJ objected, and they would be hard-pressed to 
run the Diet in the future. 
  [Kawabata] Mr. Fujimori, thank you very much.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Newly installed Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata is ready to form a new cabinet without a 
Diet majority on Tuesday, following the Social Democratic 
Party's [SDP] decision to quit the coalition. 
  Hata told reporters early Tuesday he will make a last-ditch 
appeal to the SDP, the largest component in the coalition, to 
drop its decision, which would strip a new coalition government 
of a crucial majority of seats in the 511-member House of 
Representatives. 
  Hata added he is ready to meet SDP Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama 
at any time over the matter. 
  Political sources said Hata will appeal to 
middle-of-the-road 
and right-wing members of the SDP to take part in the coalition 
if the party does not reverse the decision. 
  Hata and the coalition leaders are also likely to maneuver 
to 
gain support from elements of the largest opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), the sources added. 
  Non-SDP coalition party leaders are scheduled to discuss the 
situation at 10 a.m. [0100 GMT] Tuesday morning in the wake of 
the SDP's announcement. 
  On Tuesday morning Murayama reiterated the party's 
determination to leave the coalition in protest at the abrupt 
formation of a new 130-member parliamentary group named Kaishin 
in the lower house by five groups, including Hata's Shinseito. 
  The SDP views the formation of Kaishin as a "breach of 
trust" 
by its coalition partners, because it was not consulted about 
the new group. 
  Murayama stated the SDP's position in an interview on a 
Japan 
Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) television news program. But he was 
very cautious about seeking an early general election in the 
middle of an economic slowdown. 
  The SDP will formally decide to withdraw from the coalition 
at an emergency meeting of its central executive committee at 
9:30 a.m. Tuesday, SDP officials said. 
  Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, one of key 
coalition strategists, told reporters early Tuesday morning that 
Hata will definitely form a new cabinet despite the SDP's 
departure from the coalition. 
  The LDP is also scheduled to have an executive meeting 
Tuesday morning on how to cope with the newly emerged situation, 
with the focus on maintaining its unity, LDP officials said. 
  A large-scale reshuffle of cabinet ministers is expected 
because the SDP had six cabinet ministers in the coalition 
cabinet of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Hata's policy speech to the Diet scheduled for Tuesday 
afternoon has been postponed because of the delay of forming the 
new cabinet, Diet officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Democratic Socialist Party 
(DSP) Chairman Keigo Ouchi said Tuesday [26 April] he is ready 
to ask other coalition partners to disband a new 130-legislator 
parliamentary bloc if that could convince the Social Democratic 
Party (SDP) to reverse its decision to quit the ruling coalition. 
  "If the (presence of the) new parliamentary group hampers 
the 
maintenance of the coalition framework, we are ready to disband 
it," Ouchi said in a TV program. Ouchi on Monday proposed the 
creation of the new parliamentary bloc called Kaishin 
(Innovation) to support newly elected Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata. 
  After five parties and groups formed the bloc without the 
SDP, which was kept in the dark over the move, the SDP, the 
largest force in the coalition, decided to withdraw from the 
coalition. The SDP's decision plunged Japan's political world 
into confusion, with the possibility that Hata will be forced to 
form a minority government. 
  "We will not place any conditions before accepting a 
possible 
return of the SDP into the coalition fold," Ouchi said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Prosecutors announced 
Monday [25 April] the end of 13 months of investigations into a 
series of bribery scandals involving politicians and major 
construction firms. 
  "We see no other cases to investigate except those in which 
we have indicted suspects so far," said Tatsuhiro Ishikawa, 
deputy chief prosecutor of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors 
Office which has probed the scandals. 
  Following the investigations, the prosecutors indicted 32 
people, including a Diet legislator, two governors, two mayors 
and officials of eight major construction companies, and a large 
paper manufacturer. 
  There was speculation that several Diet members were likely 
to be charged, but former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura 
was the only Diet member to be indicted. 
  Nakamura, 45, a House of Representatives member, was charged 
April 1 with accepting a 10 million yen bribe in January 1992 
from leading contractor Kajima Corp. He left the main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) shortly before he was arrested. 
  Nakamura is still under detention at the Tokyo detention 
house. 
  The prosecutors have decided not to charge a 63-year-old 
former executive of Mitsui Construction Co. who allegedly 
embezzled 10 million yen disbursed from the company's coffers to 
be donated to former LDP Secretary General Seiroku Kajiyama, 68, 
a lower house member, Ishikawa said. 
  Ishikawa told a press conference that investigators dropped 
the case because the executive has paid back the money to Mitsui 
Construction and because the company does not demand any 
punishment. 
  Some newspapers have reported that Mitsui Construction, in 
the spring of 1991, gave 10 million yen to the Kajiyama camp to 
win a public works contract. 
  Prosecutors probed whether Kajiyama violated the law, but 
the 
executive told investigators about the alleged embezzlement, 
which means the LDP lawmaker did not receive the money. 
  Former Posts and Telecommunications Minister Hideo Watanabe, 
59, a former LDP lower house member, allegedly received a total 
of 40 million yen in secret donations from Kajima Corp. from 
1988 through 1991 as a reward for helping the company get a 43 
billion yen contract. 
  Prosecutors suspected Watanabe violated the Political Funds 
Control Law in receiving 10 million yen out of the 40 million 
yen, but it was found legal because Kajima donated the money 
through a fund-raising organization. 
  Prosecutors now only plan supplementary investigations into 
the Nakamura case, including questioning of his secretaries and 
former LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru, Ishikawa said. 
  Kanemaru, 79, is currently on trial for income tax evasion. 
Evidence seized during investigations into the Kanemaru case in 
March last year led to probes into the series of bribery 
scandals. 
  Aside from Nakamura, politicians charged during the probes 
are former Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi, 76, former Miyagi Gov. 
Shuntaro Honma, 54, former Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii, 68, and 
Masahiro Oyama, 49, former mayor of the town of Sanwa, Ibaraki 
Prefecture. 
  Prosecutors also indicted officials and executives of eight 
major construction companies -- Hazama Corp., Kajima Corp., 
Mitsui Construction Co., Nishimatsu Construction Co., Obayashi 
Corp., Shimizu Corp., Taisei Corp. and Tobishima Corp. -- and 
Daishowa Paper Mfg. Co., a major paper manufacturer. 
  Of the 32 people indicted, the guilt of former town Mayor 
Oyama and three other people -- one of his aides and two 
construction firm officials -- has already been established. 
  In a Feb. 15 decision, the Tokyo District Court gave Oyama a 
two and a half year suspended prison sentence. He was also 
ordered to pay 14 million yen to the state coffers -- the amount 
he received in bribe money.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Economic Planning Chief 
Manae Kubota expressed concern Friday [22 April] about a ruling 
coalition agreement that apparently paves the way for a hike in 
the consumption tax. 
  Expressing her personal opinion at a regular news conference 
after a morning cabinet meeting, the director general of the 
Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said, "I am worried that it might 
have a bad effect on the economy." 
  Kubota urged that conditions be attached to any tax change, 
such as putting such an overhaul in the context of 
administrative reform, cutting unnecessary spending and 
reviewing government subsidies. 
  The Social Democratic Party, of which Kubota is a member, 
compromised on taxes early Friday, agreeing to shift the tax 
burden away from such direct levies as income taxes and toward 
indirect taxation with "the understanding of the people." 
  Kubota said her fellow socialists appeared to have "jumped 
the gun" in agreeing to the tax overhaul before details have 
been worked out, although she stressed that she had not heard 
details of the agreement. 
  She said it is easy to take the tax overhaul as a rehash of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's failed attempt to replace the 
3 percent consumption tax with a 7 percent "national welfare 
tax," which Kubota branded as just a change of packaging while 
leaving the content the same. 
  Noting that she had opposed the introduction in April 1989 
of 
the consumption tax, Kubota apologized to the women's groups 
with whom she had worked to block the levy.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Sumitomo Bank chief Toshio 
Morikawa took over as industry leader Tuesday [26 April], 
acknowledging complaints about his own bank and vowing to win 
back trust in Japan's banks. 
  The Sumitomo bank president became chairman of the 
Federation 
of Bankers Associations of Japan, replacing Tadashi Okuda, 
president of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, at the end of his one-year 
term. 
  Morikawa told his first news conference as federation 
chairman that he wants a review of the "firewall" regulating the 
subsidiaries of banks and brokerages as they move into each 
other's turf. 
  He made no specific proposals but called for development 
along the lines of government directives allowing the banking 
and securities industries to make their first tentative forays 
into each other's business areas. 
  Banks are allowed into bond underwriting but are barred from 
dealing in bonds and remain restricted from stock trading. 
  Asked about the economy, Morikawa said it is still too early 
to declare a recovery, saying, "it will take some time to 
confirm that the economy has hit bottom." 
  Referring to Japan's political turmoil, he said, "I don't 
really understand political movements but I hope for political 
stability as soon as possible," noting such issues as the 
overdue budget for fiscal 1994, which started this month. 
  He said that as federation head he wants to "aim for closer 
involvement between banks, and their customers and society." 
  In an earlier interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Morikawa 
acknowledged that Sumitomo Bank has a "bad image" with the 
public, vowing to improve the bank's stature while "regaining 
public trust" in the industry itself as it battles the woes 
incurred through the speculative excesses of the late 1980s. 
  Banks must continue writing off the mountain of bad debts 
left when loans soured as the value of land and other assets 
backing the loans collapsed with the bursting of the speculative 
"bubble," Morikawa said. 
  Japanese banks must also go forward on the issues of risk 
management and disclosure, he said. 
  "Under increased competition through the spate of financial 
deregulations, our industry must pin its efforts on taxing its 
ingenuity and as a result stimulating the economy," he told 
KYODO. 
  Morikawa rejected criticism that banks are unwilling to lend 
to creditworthy borrowers because of the bad-loan overhang. 
"There's no such linkage," he said. 
  "We are strongly willing to boost lending in connection with 
bad loans," he said. "Indeed, we must increase our core 
earnings to promote the writeoff of bad loans." 
  Banks are not taking an "unnecessarily strict stance" in 
lending, Morikawa said, but are pulling back from the lax 
"lending conditions of the so-called bubble boom that deviated 
from the normal posture." 
  Another major headache for banks is the final phase of 
liberalization of interest rates, pitting private banks against 
the huge postal savings system in the fight for depositors. 
  Morikawa vowed to continue the federation's fight against 
the 
postal system's "unreasonable" drawing of customers through 
interest rates fixed at higher levels than those of banks. 
  Rates on government-backed postal deposits should "follow 
the 
average private rate" and not become the "price leader," 
Morikawa said, urging renegotiation of an April 8 agreement that 
temporarily sets ordinary postal deposit rates about 1 
percentage point above those offered by banks. 
  As he assumed the role of the "face" of Japan's overall 
banking industry, Morikawa also acknowledged public 
dissatisfaction with Sumitomo Bank, which recently ranked third 
in a financial magazine's list of banks that leaving bad 
impressions with the public. 
  "I regret and am taking seriously such a bad image as 
revealed in various surveys," said Morikawa, the first Sumitomo 
chief to head the federation. "We want to clear the negative 
image as soon as possible, but frankly, some days and months 
will be necessary." 
  He told KYODO the problem stemmed from Sumitomo "traditions" 
of aggressively seeking the top spot in short-term profits while 
"neglecting our basic business principle of satisfying 
customers." 
  "But we are not movie stars and are not thinking of creating 
an image to attract people," he added. 
  Morikawa said he hopes his schedule will allow him to attend 
an October gathering in Madrid of bankers from around the world, 
but he lamented that his new duties will likely further cut into 
his few leisure pursuits -- driving to nearby spots like Hakone 
and taking time for his "lousy golf game."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 23 KYODO -- Despite brighter prospects 
of the future course of the economy, many companies remain 
cautious in their recruiting policies for the next fiscal year, 
according to a KYODO NEWS SERVICE survey. 
  The survey showed that most of the companies that were 
polled 
and that have already decided their recruiting plans for next 
spring intend to reduce their workforce, although most believe 
the economy will pick up by the end of the year. 
  Of the 150 major companies nationwide polled, only 60, or 
about 40 percent, have already worked out recruitment plans for 
the year starting in April 1995, reflecting the lingering 
uncertainty over the economic outlook. 
  Only four of the 60 firms are willing to boost the number of 
recruits for next spring, while 37 plan reductions and 19 will 
keep this fiscal year's level. 
  The prudency about recruiting came despite a finding in the 
same survey that most of the companies polled think the economy 
has bottomed out or will hit bottom by the end of the year. 
  Those which projected an economic recovery during the 
October- December quarter this year numbered 54, while another 
22 firms answered that the economy has already hit bottom. The 
two groups and others which forecast a pickup by the year-end 
account for a dominant 77 percent of the 150 companies polled. 
  The survey, taken in mid-April, showed that labor policies 
are particularly austere in such industrial sectors as 
construction, dogged by the after effects of the series of 
bribery scandals, high yen-hit automakers and electronics 
makers, and airlines suffering from dwindling earnings. 
  For instance, major contractor Kajima Corp. plans to halve 
the number of recruits for next spring to 200, while Taisei 
Corp., also a leading builder, has decided on a 20 percent cut 
in its fast-track career staff. 
  Leading exporters like Toyota Motor Corp., Mitsubishi Motors 
Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. cited the dismal 
business climate and the murky economic outlook as reasons for 
recruits-cutting programs. 
  Japan Air System plans to employ no new recruits next fiscal 
year, while Japan Airlines also will hire only pilots. 
  Steelmakers like Kobe Steel Ltd. and Nippon Steel Corp., 
which are in the midst of drastic labor reductions, and 
foodstuff and pharmaceutical makers, including Ajinomoto Co. and 
Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd., also have decided to slim labor. 
  In contrast, Japan's telecom giant Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corp. (NTT), leading computer maker Fujitsu Ltd. and 
video game behemoth Nintendo Co. are among those willing to 
increase the labor force, especially for their promising new 
businesses such as multimedia. 
  The KYODO survey also found that an increasing number of 
companies are shifting to more flexible employment and see no 
need to cling to a longstanding Japanese corporate custom to 
collectively recruit in spring. 
  In a question about future employment policies, two thirds 
of 
the 129 companies which came up with answers said they will 
continue spring-time recruitment but many of the others said 
they are studying employing more experienced workers and 
recruiting not only in the spring but in other times of the year. 
  The latter group includes consumer electronics giant Sony 
Corp., known for its maverick labor policies, Mitsubishi Motors 
Corp. and Jusco Co., a leading supermarket operator.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Japan will review its 
long- standing policy of banning construction of oil-burning 
thermal power plants, a senior energy agency official said 
Friday [22 April]. 
  Elements of a revised policy will be included in a report 
forecasting Japan's long-term energy demand and supply toward 
the next century, set for release on June 21, said the official 
at the Natural Resources and Energy Agency, who declined to be 
named. 
  The official said the review is in response to requests by 
power firms to "fine-tune" the amount of energy supply during 
the peak energy usage time in summer. 
  Under the adjusted policy, the agency will allow renovation 
of outmoded oil-burning thermal power plants, the official said. 
  But building completely new facilities will still not be 
allowed under the terms of the June report, he said. 
  Construction of new oil-fired thermal power plants has been 
prohibited since 1980 as part of efforts to promote the 
development of alternative energy following the second oil 
crisis in the late 1970s.

  [Text] JAKARTA, April 26 (AFP) -- Justice Minister Utoyo 
Usman has accused China of interfering in Indonesia's internal 
affairs with its criticisms of recent anti-ethnic Chinese riots 
in North Sumatra. 
  Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin on Thursday 
called on Jakarta to defuse the situation after riots erupted 
following labour protests in Medan on April 14. 
  "China had better mind its own internal affairs. Events such 
as took place in Medan (North Sumatra), happen in many other 
countries," said Usman cited by Antara news agency. 
  Usman, who was speaking in Manado, North Sulawesi, on Monday 
said Beijing's statement showed its tendency to interfere in 
Indonesian internal affairs, the agency said. 
  He said Jakarta had taken prompt action to stop the trouble 
and was handling the incidents according to Indonesian law. 
  The Indonesian military have said 47 suspects have been 
detained following the disturbances and legal proceedings were 
pending. 
  The riots left one ethnic Chinese businessman dead and 
damaged scores of Chinese-owned properties. Workers were 
demanding better labour conditions, better wages and the freedom 
to organize. 
  There is widespread resentment in parts of Indonesia against 
the country's five million ethnic-Chinese minority, which 
constitutes only three percent of the population but controls a 
disproportionate share of the economic activity. 
  There are also about 200,000 Chinese nationals in Indonesia, 
who have been stranded here since Jakarta severed ties with 
Beijing in 1967 in the wake of an aborted coup in 1965 which was 
blamed on communists. 
  Jakarta had then accused Beijing of complicity in the coup. 
Relations were normalized in August 1990. 
  Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas in an earlier comment 
on Beijing's statement said China should not doubt Jakarta's 
ability to handle the unrest in Medan.

  [Text] JAKARTA, April 26 (AFP) -- Hundreds of Vietnamese 
in Indonesia's Galang island refugee centre have been on hunger 
strike since Friday in protest against their planned 
repatriation, diplomatic sources said Tuesday. 
  The protest coincided with Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh's 
arrival here Tuesday on a four-day visit. 
  Anh is expected to discuss the plight of the 8,000 mostly 
Vietnamese refugees with President Suharto. Indonesia and 
Vietnam in October signed an agreement for the refugees' 
voluntary repatriation. 
  A diplomat here, who requested anonymity, said he believed 
the protestors numbered around 1,000 but said he had no precise 
figure for those on hunger strike. He said 72 people had been 
treated for dehydratation by the local Red Cross. 
  The SUARA PEMBARUAN daily said Monday that 500 refugees were 
on hunger strike and that 79 people had been hospitalized. 
  A spokesman for police chief Major General Kusparmono Irsan 
was quoted by the paper as saying a police team from Riau 
province had been sent to calm the situation on the island, just 
south of Singapore. 
  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
temporarily withdrew from Galang after the protest erupted. But 
the diplomat said the UNHCR might send an official back there 
Wednesday to help restore calm. 
  Military authorities with jurisdiction over the island 
declined comment saying that they had not yet received full data 
about the incidents. 
  The diplomat said the camp protest started Thursday. Only 
about 800 of the 8,000 Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees are due 
to be resettled in third countries, namely Australia, the United 
States and Canada. 
  About 100,000 people have been transferred to third 
countries 
since the camp opened in 1975. 
  Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Monday that Indonesia 
intended to clear the island which has served as a transit 
centre for boat people into an industrial zone. 
  The Batam Development Agency, which is responsible for the 
development of the bonded zone in Batam island, also south of 
Singapore, wants to expand the region's rapid economic and 
industrial growth to nearby Rempang and Galang islands.

  [Text] Jakarta, Apr 24 (ANTARA) -- Indonesia's exports to 
Thailand in 1993 registered a value of 467.7 million US dollars, 
a 33 percent increase from 352.8 million US dollars recorded in 
1992, data from the Ministry for Trade have disclosed. 
  The data made available to the press here over the weekend 
also have it that in percentage the export increase was twice as 
much as the average annual increase in Indonesia's export to 
Thailand during the 1988-1992 period. 
  Owing to the export increase, Indonesia's market share in 
Thailand also went up from 0.72 percent in 1992 to 1.99 percent 
in 1993. 
  Steel, weaving yarns, paper, cardboards, metal goods and 
footwear, especially shoes, were items whose exports showed a 
jump. 
  Some items, however, went down in export value and they 
included among other things timber, coffee, tea, cacao, fruits, 
vegetables and spices. 
  Indonesia buys from Thailand among other things sugar and 
honey, industrial machinery, chemicals, compressors and 
food-processing machines.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Foreign Loans Have Nearly Reached a </F>
Psychological Limit"] 
  [Text] Saleh Affif, coordinating minister for economics, 
finance, and development supervision has reiterated the need to 
seriously review Indonesia's foreign debts which have reached 
U.S. $90 billion. He made the latest call at the opening of a 
seminar on general mining in Jakarta on 6 April. 
  A serious review is needed considering that Indonesia's 
foreign loans have nearly reached the threshold of a 
psychological limit of U.S. $100 billion and which could have an 
influence on the donor countries. This means that if the 
foreign loans exceed the limit, then the donor nations will 
reconsider giving Indonesia more loans. The amount will then be 
reduced. 
  Minister Affif said the national economy did not experience 
a 
negative impact even though the country's foreign loans "should 
have received serious attention." The indicator which was 
presented was that the inflation rate was lower than last year, 
the foreign exchange reserves have reached U.S. $12 billion and 
could support imports for at least five months, the national 
banking lending rates have returned to normal, and the 
transactions deficit continues to decline. 
  During the 1993/94 fiscal year, the transactions deficit 
stood at only U.S. $3 billion, or around two percent of the 
Gross Domestic Product, GDP; while during the 1990/91 fiscal 
year, the deficit stood at 3.7 percent. The ratio between the 
transactions deficit with the GDP stood at two percent which was 
considered a safe deficit level for any nation. 
  The amount of foreign loans cannot be used as a yardstick to 
determine the seriousness of the national economic situation. 
All will depend on the country's economic resources. 
  Indonesia is currently feeling the heavy burden of foreign 
loans. Such a burden can be seen, for example, from the numerous 
financial allocations it must set aside in every annual budget 
to pay interest and repay foreign loans. 
  The financial allocations set aside for repaying foreign 
loans are continuously increasing annually. For example, during 
the 1994/95 fiscal year, 42 percent of the routine expenditure 
will be allocated for repaying loans. It will be more 
beneficial if such allocations are utilized for improving the 
welfare of government employees or toward contributing to 
allocations for development. 
  The heavy burden of repaying foreign loans does not 
necessarily mean that the burden was caused by the increase in 
loans. Another cause was the appreciation of foreign currency, 
particularly the yen. The Japanese yen's rapid appreciation 
against the U.S. dollar caused Indonesia to suffer a 40 percent 
loss in foreign loans, particularly in yen currency. Finance 
Minister Mar'ie Muhammad stated that "our debt burden is 
increasing even when we are asleep." 
  First, attention should be directed toward the yen's 
continuing appreciation which shows no signs of declining. 
Japan's huge trade surplus with its major trading partners and 
the deadlock in Japan-U.S. talks will definitely become 
potential factors for the yen's appreciation. 
  More caution is needed in pursuing developments. There is a 
need to scrutinize the management of foreign loans from time to 
time. 
  Second, the business circle's commercial loans have 
spiralled 
in recent years. The loans taken by the private sector within a 
brief period accounted for 40 percent of Indonesia's total 
foreign loans. 
  It is very heartening if we view it from a different angle 
because the business circle was successful in acquiring 
financial resources on its own from international monetary 
sources. But on the other hand, the loans they took were only 
short-term with high interest rates. This further contributed 
to the country's heavy burden of balance of payments for foreign 
loans. 
  In this connection, it is only appropriate that the business 
circle positively realizes the situation. The business circle 
should practice self-restraint when taking out loans. They 
should only apply for limited and affordable loans which can be 
repaid, or loans for projects which can bring in foreign 
exchange. All this would greatly contribute toward preventing 
the national economy from being enmeshed in difficulties. 
  It is a fact that a drop of water will definitely not cause 
a 
catastrophe. But if a drop of water is added to a brimful glass 
of water, then an overspill is unavoidable. It will be wise and 
good if certain planned mega projects are temporarily shelved. 
  Serious attention is greatly needed on the question of 
foreign debts. The danger a country faces is not from its 
foreign debts, but more so from its supporting economic 
capabilities. This can be observed through the country's 
ability to bring in more foreign exchange through its exports. 
  People know that the debt service ratio [three preceding 
words in English], DSR, has exceeded 30 percent. In fact, we 
are concerned about the recent export developments. 
  First, non-oil exports are beginning to face competition 
everywhere since its rapid growth over the last decade. Its 
rapid climb is currently facing a slight decline. 
  Thus, we have exposed our export problem. In this 
connection, we would like to point out the need to employ other 
steps in trying to safeguard our exports and also to secure a 
"safe level" due to foreign debts. Whether we like it or not, 
this is the hurdle that we must overcome. Our national economy 
will suffer if a unilateral step is taken regarding the 
utilization of funds derived from long-term international loans.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Our Foreign Debts Are At The Red Level"] </F>
  [Text] Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and 
Development Supervision Saleh Affif finally reminded "us" that 
the country's rate of foreign debts should be controlled. 
  The reason -- as was repeatedly and continuously commented 
by 
this daily -- was that the foreign debts accumulated by the 
Indonesian Government and the private sector have reached nearly 
$100 billion. 
  In fact, the overall current amount of foreign debt, as what 
is termed as outstanding debt [preceding two words in English], 
is around $90 billion. A psychological effect will be felt the 
moment Indonesia's foreign debts hit the $100 billion mark, that 
is, the donor countries would be hesitant and would reconsider 
extending any attractive loans to the debtor countries [two 
preceding words in English]. 
  Thus, it was clear that ever since the implementation of the 
first Long-Term Development Program, the debate on the foreign 
debt issue has proved to be futile. The foreign loans had 
supplemented the development programs. 
  This daily has since had a "correct" conviction with regard 
to the government's New Order policy, which is to continuously 
acquire foreign loans for development programs. Therefore, this 
daily could should not be branded as being "anti-development". 
  However, development is part of the developing nations' 
physical struggle in their effort to ensure the existence and 
perpetuation of their political life, economy, and culture after 
the colonialists were ushered out. 
  If this daily had proposed from the beginning that national 
development was undertaken based on a principle of 
"self-reliance" and not through being dependent on any nation or 
international body, then such a proposal would have been made 
out of concern and love for the people and the country. 
  When Indonesia's "new" loan stood at around $21.76 billion 
in 
1983, most people in developing nations feared that their 
foreign debts would spiral drastically within the next decade. 
  In accordance with the World Bank's monetary list, the 
1984-85 "World Debt Table" [preceding three words in English] 
projected the increase of foreign debt incurred by the 
developing nations as "serious" and running up to billions of 
dollars in 1983. The developing nations referred to are as 
follows: 
  India with foreign debts totaling $24.429 billion; Indonesia 
with $21.768 billion; South Korea with $23.07 billion; 
Argentina with $24.592 billion; Brazil with $58.068 billion; 
and Mexico with $66.731 billion. 
  It is not only this daily but almost every other Indonesian 
newspaper expressed its concern that if the developing 
countries' foreign debts were left unchecked, then those 
countries with the most serious foreign debt problems would be 
ensnared in what is termed a debt trap [preceding two words in 
English]. 
  Why then the cause for concern? At that time, rhetoric such 
as "the foreign loans will not impose any burden on the people" 
and many other statements was heard from Professor Wijoyo 
Nitisastro, who held that foreign loans were a form of 
assistance, considering them important for Indonesia's 
successful implementation of national development programs and 
so on. 
  The majority of the people believed that the foreign debts 
would finally be "easily" settled through income derived from 
petroleum exports. 
  In fact, such a consideration never even materialized. The 
petroleum prices in international markets plummetted to $13 per 
barrel and the country's foreign debts spiraled upward, thus 
causing the financial reserves from petroleum sources into a 
more serious situation. 
  In this daily's 28 March 1994 editorial titled "The G-15 
Summit Should Solve The Foreign Debt Crisis," it was clear that 
the developing nations' foreign debts had doubled and tripled 
compared with the amount incurred during the previous decade and 
a "debt crisis" was imminent. In such a situation, the 
developing nations' income derived from their exports would be 
absolutely insufficient to even repay the principal borrowed, 
let alone the interest. 
  Also, last year when Indonesia's foreign loans reached $78 
billion (as stated in THE STRAIITS TIMES 2 July 1993), the head 
of CGI (Consultative Group for Indonesia) [preceding expansion 
in English] Guatama Kaji, stated that with Indonesia's six 
percent growth rate, there was no pressing need for the country 
to acquire a $5.11 billion loan. 
  In 1992, Indonesia's foreign loans approved by the World 
Bank 
totaled about $4.9 billion. At that time, the dollar 
appreciated sharply against the yen. This would increase 
Indonesia's foreign debts -- without even receiving any yen. 
  It was very clear that the policy employed by economists 
from 
the Berkeley Group with regard to the acquisition of foreign 
loans during the First Long-Term Development Program was one of 
a "hasty" nature, thus reflecting an inability to contain the 
numerous financial leakages. Indonesia would not have been 
cornered into, as what is termed as, a debt trap if ever a 
glimmer of patriotism ever existed within the hearts of this 
group of people. 
  The country's financial situation has worsened, but do not 
let the people bear the "consequences."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Indonesia Acquires A U.S.$500 Million Standby </F>
Loan] 
  [Text] The Government of Indonesia signed a U.S. $500 
million syndicated standby loan [preceding two words in English] 
agreement with the United States. The syndicated loan was 
acquired from 65 foreign banks in Frankfurt, Germany. The 
commercial loan is repayable over a seven-year period with a 
further extension of a five-year grace period [preceding two 
words in English]. The availability period [preceding two words 
in English] is extended over a period of five years. The 
settlement of the loan will be made through five annual 
half-yearly repayments over the stipulated period. 
  There is nothing exceptional about the loan. It is also not 
an emergency action whereby the country is facing a crisis or 
anticipating one in the future. According to J. Sudradjat 
Jiwandono, governor of the Bank of Indonesia, the government 
acquired the standby loan on an annual basis at a value of U.S. 
$2 billion in foreign exchange. There is a need to seek a fresh 
standby loan from time to time. 
  The standby loan only serves as a precautionary measure. The 
previous loans had proven to be beneficial, but the main 
objective is to anticipate any crisis the government might face. 
  The Indonesian Government will only be charged an annual 0.5 
percent commitment fee [preceding two words in English] if the 
loan is not utilized, besides making the stipulated repayments 
in installments. But if the loan is utilized, then the interest 
rate charged will be on an annual commercial rate of 0.75 
percent based on the LIBOR (London Inter Bank Offered Rate) 
[preceding term in parenthesis in English] interest rate for the 
first two years and 0.875 percent based on LIBOR for the 
remaining years. LIBOR's current interest rate is 3.94 percent. 
  Indonesia pays a high interest rate to LIBOR because of our 
country's current economic situation. Thailand and Malaysia pay 
a lesser interest rate to LIBOR because of their strong economic 
situation. 
  In fact, the objective of taking out an annual U.S. $2 
billion standby loan is for maintaining Indonesia's steady and 
safe balance of payments (balance of payments for trade, 
services, and financial transactions between Indonesia and other 
nations). 
  As stated by the governor of the Central Bank, the standby 
loan will only be utilized as a last resort should the country 
face difficulty in disbursing its balance of payments. He also 
added that the standby loan will not be used immediately because 
Indonesia's financial reserves currently stand at U.S. $12 
billion. In other words, Indonesia is currently in a safe 
position regarding its balance of payments. 
  If any urgent "shortfalls" should occur, then the problem 
can 
be solved through utilizing the U.S. $2 billion standby loan. 
  We need to be cautious about our country's economic 
situation 
this year. The previous 1.8 trillion rupiah deficit in the 
1993/94 budget was covered by using the excessive budget. The 
1994/95 fiscal year, which will officially come into effect 
tomorrow, faces an uncertain position because of declining oil 
prices, while the export of non-oil commodities faces certain 
challenges. If anything undesirable should befall these two 
sectors, then the balance of payments will be distinctly 
affected during the 1994/95 fiscal year. As such, it is of 
utmost importance to have a standby loan. 
  We have also learned from experience that numerous 
speculation arose whenever there was an "identical shortfall" in 
foreign exchange over a certain period, which means that there 
was a temporary irregularity in our balance of payments. Then 
the issue of devaluing the rupiah emerged. People would then 
exchange their local currency for foreign denominations and make 
their exodus to other countries. In truth, such a premonition 
could turn into a reality and such a self-fulfilling prophecy 
[preceding three words in English] is much feared. 
  The government does not desire an unstable monetary 
situation. Therefore, this is the reason for acquiring the U.S. 
$2 billion standby loan. 
  An announcement and clarification were made regarding the 
acquisition of a fresh U.S. $500 million standby loan, the 
annual U.S. $2 billion loan, and the announcement that 
Indonesia's current foreign reserves stand at U.S. $12 billion. 
In our opinion, such an announcement was issued with the 
objective of planting a psychological effect amid the prevailing 
trepidation concerning this year's economic situation. The 
objective of the above action was to suppress the possibility of 
various negative issues concerning the country's economic 
situation being brought to the fore, particularly issues related 
to the country's monetary sector. 
  Our economic situation is not really at a desired level even 
though we have an annual U.S. $2 billion standby loan for 
supporting funds and monetary capability. Apart from needing to 
attract loans to carry out development projects, the government 
also needs commercial loans as a measure to safeguard our smooth 
balance of payments. 
  This indicates that the income from exports (whether 
petroleum or non-oil exports) and ongoing foreign investments 
within the country are still insufficient to meet the balance of 
payments. Thus, there is no other alternative but to increase 
our exports (particularly non-oil exports) and to also increase 
our investments abroad. 
  On the other hand, even though the standby loan (which is 
mostly left unused) poses a burden for Indonesia, it nonetheless 
constantly indicates the country's ability to maintain its 
economic stability, particularly stability in its monetary 
sector.

<F P=106> [From the "Talk of the Week" feature] </F>
  [Text] Dear listeners: In an earlier broadcast, one of 
the leaders of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, Mr. Le Quang Dao, 
spoke about the aims and significance of the party Central 
Committee's resolution on the great national unity and 
strengthening of a Unified National Front in current times. 
  In this Talk of the Week, Mr. Dao speaks about the tasks of 
the Vietnam Fatherland Front in implementing that resolution. 
  Mr. Dao maintains that to make full use of all advantages, 
overcome difficulties and challenges, and push down all threats 
now as more than before, it is required to implement great 
national unity and strengthen a United National Front, raising 
unity to an ever-higher level. This will create a strong 
motivation for the development of Vietnam's history. It is 
required to rid Vietnam of poverty and backwardness and build it 
into a powerful country with rich people and an equal and 
civilized society. This would implement the last will of the 
late President Ho Chi Minh to build a Vietnam of peace, 
unification, independence, democracy, and prosperity; and 
contribute positively to the cause of peace, independence, 
democracy, and progress in the world. 
  Mr. Le Quang Dao pointed out that to obtain the 
above-mentioned objectives, the Vietnam Fatherland Front unites 
Vietnamese people of all social classes, ethnic groups, 
religions who reside in Vietnam and abroad, and approve of the 
common objectives mentioned above. The front takes a great duty 
as its common objective and can accept the different viewpoints 
which are not running counter to the common interest to mobilize 
people in building and defending the nation. 
  The Vietnam Fatherland front will broaden its activities 
from 
charity and humanitarian to political, economic, social, and 
cultural activities to be suitable to each social circle and 
class. 
  The Front promotes the positive role of front-ranking people 
in all social classes and quarters, ethnic groups, religions, 
and revolutionary veterans, attracting all talents to state 
institutions, social-economic, and mass organizations. 
  After highlighting the contributions of the Vietnam 
Fatherland Front in institutionalizing the great unity of the 
Vietnam Communist Party and state as well the Front's 
participating in building a state governed by law, a state of 
the people, by the people, and for the people, Mr. Le Quang Dao 
concluded: 
  In the new period of time, the Vietnam Fatherland Front is a 
political alliance, a voluntary union of mass organizations and 
individuals representing all social classes, strata, ethnic 
groups, and religions. In the coming years, the Vietnam 
Fatherland Front will broaden its organizations and activities 
to become a substantial organization of great national unity. 
The Front shows aspirations and will of people of all strata, 
focuses the people's wisdom, and unifies all members' activities. 
  The Front joins the administration in implementing democracy 
and social renewal; takes care and protects the legitimate 
interests of the people; builds, supervises, and defends the 
administration. It also participates in management and 
implementation of economic, cultural, social, security, and 
national defense tasks to become a steady bridge linking the 
people with Communist Party and the state.

<F P=106> [Speech by Phan Van Khai, party Political Bureau member and </F>
deputy prime minister, at the midterm conference of the Ho Chi 
Minh City fifth party committee: "Ho Chi Minh City Must Move 
Forward More Quickly and Firmly in Economy, Culture, Society, 
Security, and National Defense" -- date not given] 
  [Text] Dear Comrade Nguyen Van Linh, adviser to the party 
Central Committee, and dear Comrades; 
  I am very happy to attend the midterm conference of the Ho 
Chi Minh City party committee [HCMCPC], a party committee with a 
glorious revolutionary tradition in the national liberation and 
unification undertaking. This tradition is also manifested 
clearly with its dynamism in renovation and socioeconomic 
stabilization and development. This city holds an important 
position and provides great shares to implementing the two 
strategic duties of national construction under the socialist 
direction and national protection. 
  On behalf of the party Political Bureau, I welcome the 
delegate comrades and convey the trust of the leading party and 
state organs in the HCMCPC and people. 
  The HCMCPC political report presented by Comrade Secretary 
Vo 
Tran Chi correctly and straightforwardly evaluates achievements 
and progress as well as shortcomings in implementing the seventh 
national party congress [SNPC] resolution and the HCMCPC fifth 
congress resolution. It also analyzes and forecasts major 
opportunities and challenges and outlines major duties and 
measures for the coming period to satisfactorily execute the 
SNPC resolution. 
  Comrade Nguyen Van Linh, adviser to the party Central 
Committee, has delivered a speech contributing his views on the 
lines and measures to stabilize and develop the socioeconomy and 
strengthen national defense and security. I would like to 
address four issues to contribute further to your debate. 
  I. The Position and Responsibility of Ho Chi Minh City in 
the New Period of National Development. 
  1. Throughout the national revolution process led by the 
party over harsh and dangerous stages, the HCMCPC and people 
have always contributed deservingly to the common national 
cause. In 30 years of two consecutive resistance wars for 
national independence and unification, the Saigon residents 
faced a widespread mechanism and force of brutal oppression 
directly on enemy territory. Overcoming great losses and 
sacrifice, grassroots party establishments in this city have 
ceaselessly consolidated and developed. Under the HCMCPC 
leadership, our people's political fighting movement and Armed 
Forces in Saigon and Gia Dinh have always been an exemplar of 
the ironed-walled South Vietnam. 
  The entire party and people are thankful to the people here 
for their stalwart fighting which greatly contributed to our 
total victory to liberate Saigon and South Vietnam and unite the 
nation. We share the feeling of "happiness with tears" as music 
composer Xuan Hong wrote in his popular song. 
  We also cannot forget that soon after, the socioeconomic 
situation in this city plunged into a crisis with numerous 
difficulties. Life was so hard that the laboring people were 
forced to partly substitute barley corn for rice for their 
meals. From city leaders to grassroots cadres, our party and 
state organs had to spend most of their time and energy finding 
rice, vegetables, meat, and fish for the people's meals. 
  In that situation, the HCMCPC and residents not only proved 
their spirit for enduring difficulty and hardship, but they also 
developed dynamism and creativeness to improve the situation. 
This city contributed practical experiences with new ideas and 
actions at quite an early stage, creating a foundation for our 
party to review and outline the renovation line. 
  Always being among the localities which lead the way in the 
process of transforming to the market economy under state 
management, Ho Chi Minh City has actively contributed to forming 
new structures, developed its bridging role in international 
relations, and helped stabilize and develop the economic 
situation in South Vietnam and in the entire nation. 
  At present, with only 6.4 percent of the national 
population, 
Ho Chi Minh City (including all economic units in this area) 
shares about 16 percent of the gross national income, creates 
nearly one- third of the national industrial products and postal 
and transportation volume, reaches more than half of the 
national export volume, sells one-fourth of all retail goods, 
contributes one-fourth of the budget revenue, attracts nearly 
half of direct foreign investment, and trains more than half of 
all college students. These figures prove the important role and 
position of Ho Chi Minh City in the country. 
  2. In the past three years, the city economy has enjoyed a 
development rate higher than the national average. It has 
mainly overfulfilled key targets set forth by the Ho Chi Minh 
City fifth party congress. Earlier, its retail price index was 
higher than the national index. In 1993, the city reduced its 
inflation rate below the national rate (1.6 percent compared 
with 5.2 percent). 
  The recorded achievements together with geographical, 
socioeconomic, and international relations advantages have 
created better conditions for this city to develop in the new 
stage. In reality, the new period actually started in the city 
two years ago, creating momentum for faster and firmer 
development steps in the coming period. 
  However, there are many challenging issues in this city at a 
higher and complicated level such as: a lack of discipline and 
order in socioeconomic activities, poor management of state 
property, the prevalent practice of corruption and waste, the 
difficulty in maintaining political stability and social order 
and safety, the increase of social evils and poisonous and 
harmful cultural products, and so forth. 
  In our city, great opportunities go in hand with harsh 
challenges in terms of economy, politics, and society. 
  3. Our country is entering a new development stage, the 
stage of industrialization and modernization, when the speed of 
economic growth rate will be greatly accelerated and the social 
equity and social progress will be better implemented. 
Henceforth, Ho Chi Minh City will have a more important 
position and bear heavier responsibility. 
  The core content of industrialization and modernization is 
the fundamental and comprehensive transformation from a manual 
and backward industry to a modern and advanced industry which 
utilizes technological and scientific progress to reach higher 
labor efficiency and attain better social advancements. It is 
indisputable that in the industrialization and modernization 
process, Ho Chi Minh City in particular and the southern 
economic region (including Dong Nai and Ba Ria-Vung Tau 
provinces) in general, have the most advantages, the most 
important locations, and higher development levels than other 
localities. Our party Central Committee and government always 
consider this region a driving force in the industrialization 
and modernization process, a force playing a decisive role in 
national development and in the effort not to let our economy be 
left further behind those of other countries. Ho Chi Minh City, 
therefore, should bear the tremendous responsibility and task of 
being a vanguard locality, and should strive for faster and more 
steadfast advancements in all economic, cultural, social, 
security, and national defense fields. It is an life-long 
demand, a great honor, and a heavy responsibility for Ho Chi 
Minh City to maintain the undertaking to construct and protect 
our fatherland. 
  II. The City Can Only Develop Strongly and in the Right 
Direction When It Forms an Alliance and Cooperates Closely With 
Other Regions and Localities Under the Unified Leadership of the 
Central Level. 
  1. In the context of national strategy and state planning, 
Ho Chi Minh City, with its strength and advantages, should 
develop its role as an industrial center by having an ever 
increasing technological level, a trade-finance-services center, 
a head of the transportation system, and a 
culture-science-technology center for the southern region and 
the country as a whole. 
  To fulfill that role, the economic structure of the city 
should be developed in the direction of increasing the 
proportion of industry and services. It does not mean that we 
should adopt any types of industry or services, but only those 
with high technology which do not cause pollution. In other 
words, we should strive to increase the scientific and 
technological contents of the city's produces and services, and 
move production activities with low technology and high manual 
labor to outlying suburbs and other areas. The reason is that 
we need to develop the city's advantages, which other localities 
lack, and at the same time we need to try to maintain a 
reasonable city population and avoid a high population density 
that would lead to complicated problems in living conditions, 
public transport, environmental protection, and above all, 
social vices. 
  The industrial sector of the city currently still has high 
proportions of production activities in food grains, food 
staples, chemicals, fertilizer, rubber, timber processing, 
paper, construction material, ceramic and glass products (these 
products comprised 62.9 percent of production output value in 
1990 and 63.5 percent in 1993). In the meantime, areas such as 
machinery production and electronics constitute much smaller 
proportions, and were decreasing (9.9 percent in 1990 to 9.2 
percent in 1993). Though the situation is complicated and cannot 
be explained by a single reason, it shows us clearly that in 
entering a new development stage, industrial development needs 
careful planning to channel all the advantages of the city, 
using them in effecting logical and efficient changes to the 
economic structure. The city must have an increasing ability to 
accept modern and advanced technologies so that it can transfer 
them later to other localities. 
  In the development of trades and business, employment is now 
a high priority issue. But if we follow the direction of 
developing trades and professions which mainly employ manual 
labor, then the demographic population growth rate will be 
higher and the employment problem will become more tense. In 
1993, the demographic population growth rate was 1.67 percent, 
higher than the natural growth rate, which was 1.58 percent. In 
the last few years, the population of the city has increased by 
approximately 150,000 to 160,000 people each year -- about the 
population of a district -- half of them (in fact, it could be 
more) were from other localities. 
  The problem cannot be solved by administrative measures. It 
can only be solved by the combined measures of reforming the 
economic structure of the city and improving transport and 
communications, and most of the living conditions of the areas 
around the city. It requires the close alliance and cooperation 
of the city and the ministries, sectors, and other localities. 
It requires the elimination of departmentalism and 
sectionalism, which alienate localities from the central level. 
From now on, the setting up of business and production 
establishments in a locality will be considered completely in 
terms of the long-term socioeconomic benefit for that locality, 
not in terms of whether the capital contributors and business 
managers are from that locality or not. Organizations and 
individuals from Ho Chi Minh City are entitled to invest in 
production establishments in other localities, and vice versa. 
Capital and expertise cannot be limited by boundaries between 
localities or authority levels. We need to motivate all 
available sources of capital and we also need to foster and 
utilize skills. (With investment projects that produce fast 
economic benefits such as hotel, services, and so forth, we let 
foreign investors contribute most of the capital for joint 
ventures, because the motivation of domestic capital in our 
country is still made difficult due to rampant departmentalism, 
localism, and sectionalism; or is even restriced by the small 
scale of an organization). 
  2. In addition to the transformation of the economic 
structure in the direction of increasing the proportion of 
industry, the city must further develop its roles as the 
finance-trade-service center, the spearhead of the national 
transportation network and international external relations, and 
also the center for culture, science, and technology. The 
number of visitors to the city and the merchandise, capital, and 
technologies going through the city are enormous. The city 
should see them as advantages, because activities in these 
areas, which we generally describe as services, will constantly 
increase in proportionate to economic growth. 
  To be able to fulfill these requirements, the city 
authorities should concentrate all available resources on the 
construction of the socioeconomic infrastructure. Foreign 
sources can also be included, but state fund should be the main 
source. The electricity and communications networks have been 
strengthened, but the work done so far is still inadequate. The 
water supply and drainage systems; the transport system; 
facilities for education, public health, scientific research, 
technology, and so forth require greater investment. It is the 
responsibility of the state authorities to solve these issues. 
  In the development of business and production activities, we 
rely on development investment drawn from all economic sectors, 
including from the people and from direct foreign investment. 
The state is not the main investor in business and production 
fields; it only supports these activities by providing 
investment credit or contributing shares in essential 
establishments. 
  At present individual businessmen and the general public 
have 
not yet invested eagerly in production. They tend to choose to 
do business in trade, services, real estates, and so forth. The 
main reason for this situation is that our policies, laws, and 
structures have not been able to create trust among people. We 
also lack guidance and support, and sometimes we even hinder 
development efforts or are confused and sluggish in forming and 
developing the capital market. Once we overcome these 
weaknesses the development investment in the city will see a new 
boom. 
  So far, whenever we have mentioned the leading role of the 
state- run economic sector, we have referred only to state-owned 
business establishments. Now we need to correct this 
misconception and realize that the state economic sector 
comprises not only the state- run business establishments but 
also other resources and assets, the finance and state bank 
systems, and national reserves. If we could utilize and manage 
these resources effectively in combination with our legal 
institutions, the state would be perfectly capable of guiding 
all economic activities in the directions it chooses. We need 
to see this clearly in order to understand and implement 
uniformly the multisectoral economic policy, to positively 
reorganize management structure in state business 
establishments, and to be confident in developing other economic 
sectors. 
  III. Culture and Society Are Core Elements of Development. 
  This is our party's viewpoint, which accords well with 
international convention and is also the strength of the city. 
  The development in the quality of education, health 
protection services (including physical education and sports), 
cultural and art activities, as well as social and charitable 
activities has been thus far carried out with outstanding 
results, that serve as precious experiences in the 
"socialization" work that we should fulfill with the people's 
support. 
  Our main efforts at present should be to combine 
"development 
with suppression": we need to develop cultural, educational, 
health, and social activities, and at the same time strive to 
suppress social vices -- namely, prostitution and drug abuse, 
which are directly connected with the risk of spreading 
HIV/AIDS, and represent a degraded, pernicious culture. The 
expansion of the market economy and external relations require 
us to protect our society more vigorously against those vices -- 
from the small family unit to schools, agencies, enterprises, 
and mass organizations. Resolute legal and administrative 
measures should be carried out in parallel with education and 
motivation work that focus on building cultured individuals, 
families, and society. All cadres and party members must strive 
to build cultured lives for themselves and for their families, 
and must consider the effort a necessary part of the duty of 
being a model for society. 
  IV. The Organizational Mechanism and Cadres Are Decisive 
Elements 
  1. In all areas we already have policies, directions, and 
measures. The essential elements that decide the results are 
the organizational mechanism and cadres. 
  The further we have proceeded on our renovation, the more 
apparent we have found the inadequacies in knowledge, ability, 
and moral standards among the organizational mechanism and 
cadres in all sectors and echelons. Therefore, it is obvious 
that we need to combine economic reform with administrative 
reform. Within the administrative reform there are three most 
important parts we need to focus on to improve our ability to 
develop a market economy within the effective management of the 
state on the path of socialism: 
  -- Fundamentally reform the financial-monetary system in 
accordance with a market economy. 
  -- Continue the rectification of the efficiency of state 
business enterprises to improve them. 
  -- Reorganize the cadre mechanism. 
  2. The adjustment of the state mechanism to stop its 
awkwardness, bureaucracy, and corruption must start with its 
structure. 
  While discussing the anticorruption line, the party 
Political 
Bureau clearly defined that corruption is the result of many 
causes, of which the fundamental cause is our structure and 
policies. Our current policies have too many gaps and 
loopholes, which are a feeding ground for corruption and 
bribery. What does corruption live on? Mainly state property 
and money. Who are corrupt? Most of them are the party and 
state cadres. 
  There are many issues relating to corruption and 
authoritarianism. The prominent ones are: 
  -- The current state mechanism is still confused between the 
role of state administration management and the role of state 
property ownership, and it has not ended its intervention in the 
business management of the state enterprises. Therefore, we 
must clearly distinguish these roles, set up a structure to 
separate the state property management from the state 
administration management, and establish a system of ownership 
in state enterprises to ensure that the property in these state 
enterprises has a real owner. Then, we must gradually eliminate 
the system of managing organizations and rearrange the state 
mechanism to reduce the number of specialized ministries and 
departments. 
  -- We must build a structure with clearly defined 
responsibilities in the management of state property and in the 
use of public funds, reform the capital funding and the use of 
state capital, and improve the collection of tax and budget 
revenue (including fees, fines, and so forth). These tasks 
require us to reform and improve our system of accounting, 
editing, public finance, and the control and supervision of 
public funds to prevent arbitrary spending of state property. 
  -- We must fundamentally reform the administration 
procedure, 
clearly define what authority can introduce administration 
regulations (including fees), reduce matters requiring state 
permission, eliminate complicated procedures, and publicly 
announce procedures and regulations that government officials 
must conform to in receiving and solving public inquiries. We 
also have to organize public campaigns to encourage the public 
to contribute their view for the improvement of our 
administration procedure. And we must immediately conduct an 
investigation into and deal with stage organs and officials 
violating the working procedure. 
  -- We must enhance the supervision and control role of 
public 
elected organs (the National Assembly and people's committees) 
and establish a structure to ensure public supervision of the 
performance of state organs and officials. We must proceed with 
the setting up of administrative tribunals to settle disputes 
between citizens with state organs and officials.s 
  Reforming the structure to counter authoritarianism and 
corruption must be linked up with public education and 
participation. A corrupt official both violates the law and 
damages his morality and character. He not only destroys 
himself, but also stains his family. In fighting corruption, we 
need the punishment of the law, the condemnation of society, and 
prevention by colleagues and family. 
  The aforementioned are tasks that cannot be delayed. But 
they must not be conducted in a simplistic and hasty way. The 
government has its own program for executing those tasks on a 
national scale. Recently, this city has positively performed 
some tasks (such as the administrative reform). It is necessary 
to draw experience for future reference. 
  3. The cadre-related issue has a very significant meaning 
for 
the party leadership and state management in this city. 
  Ho Chi Minh City enjoys favorable conditions for attracting 
cadres from variable sources, especially the concentration of 
outstanding cadres in many fields. The problem here is how to 
create mutual trust, unity, and respect at work. We have to 
give priority to common benefits and work results without 
discrimination regarding the origin of the cadre. This is the 
first important factor in developing the ability of cadres and 
attracting more talented people to create the city strength. 
  The increase of training and refresher training for cadres 
need to go together with the evaluation and check through actual 
work to select for promote the cadre according to their 
morality, ability, work efficiency, and management ability. 
  In Ho Chi Minh City, the cadre-related work has a decisive 
meaning. Therefore, it is necessary to have a high unanimity in 
perception and line in this work before making it a party 
resolution, which will serve as a foundation for the evaluation 
and selection of cadres, thus strengthening the city party 
committee and government to turn the city into a regional and 
national center in many fields, including the field of 
cadre-related work. 
  Dear delegate comrades. 
  My meetings with delegates of different generations in this 
conference have made feelings and experiences arise in me that I 
obtained while I worked here, especially for 14 years after the 
liberation of this city. 
  I profoundly acknowledge and always remember the people here 
with their revolutionary enthusiasm and love, the dynamism and 
close comraderie cooperation among cadres in different sectors 
and levels, and the attentive leadership and guidance of 
well-eperienced key cadres. These were elements helping me to 
develop and accomplish various duties in different positions 
during my work here. 
  Together with other cadres from this city now working at the 
central organs, we always follow every developing step of this 
city with all our sentiment and knowledge. We consider our 
responsibility for this home city an obligation, honor, and 
pleasure. 
  With a sincere and respectful feeling, I wish the conference 
to have successful and earnest discussions and high unanimity in 
perception and action to lead our city in moving more quickly 
and more firmly in the new developing period. I hope that the 
party committee and people, with their past achievements, will 
heighten their determination to meet the requirements of 
everyday life and excellently accomplish the duty entrusted upon 
them by the party and state, deserving the love and trust of the 
people in the entire nation.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 27 -- State Committee for 
Cooperation and Investment (SCCI) held recently in Dong Nai 
Province a conference to review Vietnam's cooperation and 
investment with foreign countries over the past six years. 
Since the promulgation of the foreign investment law six years 
ago 895 foreign investment projects were licensed with total 
prescribed capital of USD [U.S. dollars] 8.5 billion. These 
investment projects involve more than 500 companies from 42 
countries and territories. Of the 895 investment projects, 635 
are joint ventures concentrated in three key areas: Ho Chi Minh 
City-Dong Nai-Vung Tau in the south Hanoi-Hai Phong-Quang Ninh 
in the north and Danang in the central. Thirty-nine of them 
belong to overseas Vietnamese with total registered capital of 
USD 72 million. The average of size of each project has 
increased rapidly from USD 3.5 million in the first years to USD 
9.9 million in 1993. 
  Up to now, the joint ventures with foreign investors have 
created goods and service valued at USD 780 million, provided 
nearly 50,000 jobs, and remitted to the state budget USD 211 
million. Investment and cooperation have improved the capacity 
of many existing establishments of Vietnam. Moreover they have 
increased the capacity of some industrial branches, including 
transport, post and telecommunications, and hotel services. The 
telecommunications system in particular has been improved 
greatly creating favourable conditions for economic development 
in Vietnam as well as its all-round exchange with the world 
outside.

  [Text] Vientiane, April 26 (KPL) -- Mr. Boun-gnang 
Volachit, mayor of Vientiane, yesterday afternoon, received here 
the visiting delegation of the Chinese province of Liaoning led

  The mayor of Vientiane capital warmly welcomed the visitors

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- The Beijing, Shanghai, 
Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Taiyuan, Wuhan and Wulanhaote branches 
of the central and southern area chapter of the headquarters of 
Koreans in China of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification [Pomminnyon] issued a joint statement April 7 
denouncing the new war provocation moves of the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique. 
  The statement charged that the "civilian"-veiled traitorous 
clique of Kim Yong-sam, a heinous warmanic, as if the deployment 
of over 1,000 pieces of U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea, 
were not enough, is begging for the resumption of Team Spirit 
joint military maneuvers and deploying Patriot missiles in a bid 
to unleash a nuclear war in conspiracy with U.S. imperialism. 
  The statement said: "The branches of the central and 
southern 
area chapter bitterly denounce the reckless arms buildup of the 
U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique as a wanton 
challenge to the nation's desire for peace and denuclearization 
of the Korean peninsula and an unpardonable act to exterminate 
the nation." 
  It declared they would intensify the anti-U.S., anti-war and 
anti-nuke struggle in order to save the nation from the danger 
of nuclear war, in hearty response to the 10-point programme of 
the great unity of the whole nation, and courageously turn out 
in the noble cause of defending Korean-style socialism centred 
on the masses and achieving the independent and peaceful 
reunification.

without any condition.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- World public is 
strongly denouncing the U.S. belligerent moves on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The chairman of the Denmark-the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea Friendship Association in his report at a meeting of 
the executive committee of the association held in Copenhagen on 
April 7 said that the United States in the past deployed nuclear 
and other weapons of mass destruction in South Korea on the plea 
of thwarting "threat from the North" and today it is bringing 
forward the "nuclear issue" of Korea as a pretext to keep hold 
on South Korea. 
  If the United Nations wanted to call something in question, 
it should have accused the United States of shipping nuclear and 
other mass destruction weapons into South Korea in violation of 
the Korean Armistice Agreement and called attention to the 
non-compliance with the UN resolution on the withdrawal of 
foreign troops. 
  The African regional committee for the study of the chuche 
idea in a statement April 13 said that the nuclear issue of the 
Korean peninsula can be resolved only through talks between the 
DPRK and the U.S. as it originated from the U.S. deployment of 
nuclear weapons in South Korea and its nuclear threat to the 
DPRK, and the [word indistinct] in an appeal on April 14 urged 
the U.S. administration to come out to a direct dialogue with 
the DPRK before it is too late.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 26 (KCNA)--The South Korean 
Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) called a 
press conference on the first anniversary of its inauguration on 
April 25 and vowed to wage a powerful anti-U.S., anti-Kim 
Yong-sam struggle, according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  The federation at the press conference noted that the Kim 
Yong-sam regime made many commitments when it set sail, but has 
fully revealed its anti-popular nature in the course of the 
Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiations. It 
declared that it will launch an anti-U.S., anti-Kim Yong-sam 
struggle on the occasion of its first founding anniversary. 
  It said there is nothing to expect from the Kim Yong-sam 
regime which has clearly disclosed its color of a conservative 
"government".

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- A Japanese newspaper 
April 21 quoted sources of the Foreign Ministry of the 
Philippines as saying on April 19 that the U.S. ambassador to 
the Philippines was putting pressure through President Fidel 
Ramos on Filipino Foreign Minister Roberto Romulo to refrain 
from remarks critical of the U.S. policy toward the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The foreign minister criticized the U.S. policy, saying that 
the strong hope of the United States for quick satisfaction 
cannot be said to be a diplomatic policy and that the U.S. needs 
to relax its confrontational attitude toward North Korea and 
must continue to work for a peaceful settlement. 
  The U.S. ambassador expressed disappointment at this 
criticism and complained that he did not expect such criticism 
from an ally. 
  The ambassador, impudently enough, urged Filipino President 
Fidel Ramos to order the foreign minister to stop such remarks 
as putting the U.S. in an awkward position in the discourse 
about the Korean peninsula. 
  This is an infringement on the sovereignty of the 
Philippines.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 26 (KCNA) -- Foreign papers 
denounced the United States' unreasonable pressure on Korea. 
  The U.S. paper WORKERS' WORLD April 7 said South Korea has 
been packed with various types of U.S. weapons since the U.S. 
occupied it. If the Korean peninsula is a powder keg today, it 
is because the U.S. has deployed its troops and nuclear weapons 
in South Korea and constantly reinforced them for the purpose of 
threat to North Korea, the paper added. 
  The Nepalese paper NEPAL POST April 8 said the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula was caused by the United States and the 
situation is being aggravated by it. 
  The nuclear activities of the DPRK are for the development 
of 
the independent economy and science and technology of the 
country, the paper said, and added: So there is no ground to 
argue about them. It is an illegal act and an interference in 
Korea's internal affairs for the United Nations to discuss a 
"resolution" or "sanctions" against the DPRK over the faked 
"nuclear issue." 
  The Swedish paper PROLETAREN April 7 charged that it is a 
concrete act of aggression and a wanton violation of the Korean 
armistice agreement for the United States to describe North 
Korea's peaceful research into nuclear energy as a "threat" and 
reinforce the military strength in South Korea. 
  The U.N. Security Council must immediately deal with this 
crime of the United States, the paper demanded. 
  The Irish paper EDITORIAL April 2 said it is foolish of the 
United States to try to force Korea to "surrender" by imposing 
"sanctions" on it. The paper urged the United States to 
immediately stop the illegal and unfair acts of wantonly 
violating the sovereignty of another country.

as a pro-U.S. traitorous regime," Kim Hyon-chun said: "We will

organization affiliated with the U.N. Economic and Social 
Council and the Human Rights Information Centre under it in 
Moscow issued an information on the human rights situation in 
South Korea on April 7. 
  The information said despite the adoption of the agreement 
on 
reconciliation, nonaggression, cooperation and exchange between 
the North and the South, activities for national reunification 
are not only an entity of an acute political struggle but also a 
sphere of suppression of dissidents in South Korea. 
  Restrictive measures against national peace and 
reconciliation, free travel and contact between people with 
different ideologies must be revoked, said the information.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the 
Central Committee of the Union of Agricultural Working People of 
Korea in a statement today demanded the South Korean authorities 
discard the wrong position of negating dialogue and pursuing war 
and show a positive response to the North-proposed convocation 
of a national conference, before it is too late. 
  The statement says: 
  The South Korean authorities block a wide-range dialogue 
involving various strata of society. This shows they do not want 
national reconciliation and unity, peace and reunification. It 
reveals their sinister political intention to isolate and stifle 
the Korean-style socialist system centred on the masses in 
conspiracy with outside forces. 
  The South Korean authorities must act with discretion, 
mindful that if they persistently refuse the proposed national 
conference and take the line of confrontation and war, they will 
face a grim judgement by the nation. 
  The Central Committee of the Union of Agricultural Working 
People of Korea will continue to make all sincere efforts for 
the convocation of the national conference and remain faithful 
to its mission for the nation.

chief of the mission of the South Korean National Democratic 
Front [SKNDF] (Hanminjon) in Cuba, at a press conference here on 
April 18 on the occasion of the 34th anniversary of the April 19 
popular uprising called upon the South Korean people to 
overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime and establish a 
democratic government. 
  He said the April 19, 1960, popular uprising in South Korea 
was a righteous resistance of the people who rose up in demand 
of a new politics, a new system and a new life against the 
colonial ruling system and fascist suppression by the U.S. 
imperialists and the Syngman Rhee puppet clique. 
  "The day is gone when the United States could model the 
world 
to its pleasure with strength and a strong arm," he said, and 
demanded: "The United States must squarely face the situation, 
immediately stop its adventurous war moves and get out of South 
Korea at once, taking along its forces and destruction weapons." 
  Denouncing the anti-reunification, anti-national and 
anti-popular crimes of the "civilian government", he said: "What 
Kim Yong-sam has done under the civilian mask eloquently proves 
that he is a truculent fascist dictator, splittist, sychophant 
traitor and warmaniac putting the preceding military dictators 
in the shade".

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- "Our motherland under 
the wise guidance of the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song 
and the dear leader Marshal Kim Chong-il is making a long drive 
as a powerful country," said Chu Yong-il, vice-chairman of the 
International Federation of Koreans for Reunification. 
  He told KCNA: 
  "I deem it a great honor and pleasure to have had an 
opportunity to visit the homeland and celebrate the birthday of 
the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. Seeing the motherland 
prospering, I feel my heart swell with pride in being a member 
of the Korean nation. 
  "Thanks to our great leader and dear leader, my motherland 
has greeted prosperity without precedent in its history of five 
thousand years and become the most dignified country in the 
world. 
  "There is no such person as the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song who has devoted everything to the people all his life, 
regarding `believing in the people as in heaven' as his motto. 
He has led our people to be the happiest and most proud and 
intelligent people. Our motherland owes its singlehearted unity 
to this care shown by him. 
  "The building of an independent national economy, the 
embodiment of the chuche idea in the economy, has brought about 
a dazzling development of our motherland today and it has served 
as an unshakable foundation which is not affected by any 
worldwide economic fluctuation and threat from the imperialists."

<F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Yun Pyong-son: "Why Do </F>
They Keep Silent?"] 
  [Text] Members of Greenpeace, an international civilian 
environmental organization, arrived in Samchok port, South 
Korea, on 12 April, at the invitation of the Environment 
Movement Alliance, an antinuclear movement organization in South 
Korea. They waged various forms of antinuclear movements, 
including exposure of the criminal nuclear weapons development 
maneuvers by the puppet clique. 
  On 14 April, about 20 members of this organization held an 
antinuclear rally in Samchok together with 1,000-odd members of 
environment protection and antinuclear movement organizations in 
South Korea. They warned of the danger of leakage of 
radioactivity from South Korean atomic power stations, and 
strongly demanded suspension of construction of atomic power 
stations to the puppet authorities. 
  Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets have yet to reply and 
are keeping silent. This is nothing but a foolish trick to 
conceal their criminal act of dumping nuclear wastes, conceal 
the truth about nuclear weapons development maneuvers, and evade 
international denunciation. 
  It is a universal desire of mankind to live in a world free 
from nuclear radioactivity. This is why the Greenpeace members 
carried out an anti-nuclear movement by visiting South Korea, 
and why the South Korean environmental movement organizations 
waged the struggle with them. However, the South Korean ruling 
bunch, going counter to the people's desire, developed nuclear 
weapons and indiscriminately dumped nuclear wastes into the sea, 
thus shocking the people. According to the material, the nuclear 
wastes that the South Korean puppets dumped into seas for the 
past seven years from 1986 to 1992 reach as much as 10 million 
billion and 1,000 trillion becquerels. 
  Such an act of dumping nuclear wastes is still continuing 
under the rule of the Kim Yong-sam traitorous regime. The 
puppets' act of dumping nuclear wastes is not only an 
antinational act of reducing the Korean peninsula and its 
surrounding seas into a wasteland by contaminating them with 
nuclear material but also an intolerable criminal act of 
severing the nation's lifeline and destroying nature's 
ecological environment. This act is also a flagrant 
infringement of international laws and treaties that totally ban 
the dumping of nuclear wastes into oceans. Moreover, one cannot 
think of the act of dumping nuclear wastes without having the 
puppet clique's nuclear weapons development maneuvers come to 
mind. 
  As is known to all, nuclear weapons development maneuvers 
that began in the early seventies are being accelerated in a 
very grave stage. It is an already-exposed secret that the 
puppet clique brought in a large quantity of plutonium from 
overseas for production and stockpiling, and that the 
heavy-water reactor now in operation in Wolsong, and the 
multipurpose research reactor in Taedok, are reactors for 
nuclear weapons development. 
  Today in South Korea, the disastrous situation in which 
people are suffering various types of cancerous diseases and 
losing lives, continuously takes place, and the number of cases 
of pregnant women giving birth prematurely after eating fish 
caught from the sea, and giving birth to deformed children or 
miscarrying, is drastically increasing. All this is not 
accidental. 
  Thus, while damages from nuclear radioactivity have reached 
a 
grave stage in South Korea, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has 
not taken any step nor shown any response to the just demand by 
Greenpeace. This is because the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is 
fearing that its criminal act would be exposed to the world, 
like a thief fearing discovery of his theft. This also shows 
that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique will continue accelerating 
the development of nuclear weapons to ruin fellow countrymen and 
that it will destroy the natural environment by continually 
dumping nuclear wastes into seas to threaten the life of fellow 
countrymen. 
  As long as the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique remains 
intact, 
the lands will be reduced into a wasteland and the people cannot 
evade nuclear calamities. The Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique 
which inflicts disaster on the people by indiscriminately 
dumping nuclear wastes while accelerating nuclear weapons 
development and contaminated environment, must be made stand 
before court and must be sternly judged by the nation.

  [Text] According to Seoul's Christian Broadcasting System 
reports, on 25 April the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique launched the 
provocative Hwarang war exercise in Inchon and the areas of 
Kyonggi Province adjacent to the military demarcation line. 
  The exercise in which some 1.3 million puppet military 
personnel, police officers, and reservists are taking part will 
be conducted for five days under the pretext of defending the 
homeland and facilities against someone's infiltration. 
  The war exercise commotion perpetrated by the puppet clique 
is all the more adventurous since it is staged right after 
warmonger U.S. Defense Secretary Perry left Seoul after hatching 
a war plot and, in particular, is timed to coincide with the 
deployment of the latest-type Patriot missiles. 
  The prevailing situation once again exposes the fact that 
the 
Kim Yong-sam regime has completely thrown away its civilian 
mask, has clearly revealed its color as a warmonger, and is 
kicking up its preparations for a northward invasion.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 26 (KCNA) -- The whole nation will 
never pardon the crimes of the South Korean authorities, who 
blocked the Seoul trip of a delegation of the North side, 
ruthlessly trampling down even the human morality, the beautiful 
manners and customs handed down from the ancestors and warm 
compatriotic feelings, and history will surely pass a stern 
judgement on them. 
  The North side headquarters of the National Alliance for the 
Country's Reunification says this in a statement released today 
in connection with the fact that a delegation of the North side 
could not participate in the memorial service on the one 
hundredth day after the death of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan due to the 
obstructive moves of the South Korean authorities. 
  The statement says: 
  This time, the South Korean authorities proved again that 
they are separatists who block even a small-scale contact of 
fellow countrymen, let alone national reconciliation and unity 
and the reunification of the country. 
  The Korean nation cannot live in peace with the 
anti-national 
group left alone, the group which lowers the check-bar before 
fellow countrymen going to the South for a memorial service, 
while rendering the situation extremely strained in league with 
outside forces.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 23 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] -- 
An emergency meeting of Koreans in Japan against the U.S. war 
moves took place in Tokyo on April 17. 
  It was co-sponsored by the Alliance of South Koreans in 
Japan 
for Democracy and Unification, the South Korean Youth League in 
Japan and the Democratic Association of South Korean Women in 
Japan. 
  The resolution adopted at the meeting urges the United 
States 
to give up the scheme to resume the "Team Spirit" military 
exercises and stop deploying Patriot missiles and other weapons 
of mass destruction in South Korea under the pretext of the 
"nuclear issue" and hold the third round of talks with North 
Korea at an early date and resolve all the outstanding problems 
between the two countries in a peaceful way in a package deal. 
  It demands that the Kim Yong-sam regime renounce the policy 
of confrontation with the North and dependence on foreign forces 
and choose the road of national reconciliation and reunification 
by maintaining independence and that the Japanese Government 
seek a negotiated solution to the "nuclear issue," instead of 
following the U.S. war policy.

  He demanded that the U.S. authorities renounce their hostile 
policy of stifling the DPRK, immediately stop the reckless war 
rackets and sincerely approach DPRK-USA talks for a fundamental 
solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  He strongly urged the South Korean authorities to discard 
their flunkeyist, treacherous policy and not refuse but

<F P=106> ["Is Japan Qualified?" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 26 (KCNA) -- A ranking official of 
the Japanese Foreign Ministry said some time ago that Japan 
should express its desire to be a permanent member of the United 
Nations Security Council [UNSC] "more explicitly than before" to 
the international community. 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says that, in 
seeking 
permanent membership of the Security Council, Japan intends to 
gratify its dominationist desire through military intervention 
in the disputes of the world and have its past crimes hushed up 
at any cost. 
  The news analyst says: 
  A high-placed authority of the Japanese Government has gone 
the length of making Japan appear a permanent member of the 
Security Council, insolently claiming that "Japan has so far 
played a role equal to a permanent member of the U.N. Security 
Council." 
  Such behaviour of Japan is a mockery of the international 
community, which shows its brazenness. 
  Japan is not qualified to be a permanent member of the 
Security Council. 
  By unleashing World War II, Japan destroyed world peace and 
security and imposed big disasters on the peoples of many 
countries. For these crimes, it is specified as a "hostile 
state" in the U.N. charter. 
  Still more grave is that Japan has set it as its state 
strategy to revive its policy of aggression of the past. 
  The policy of aggression of Japan which is hastening its 
conversion into a military power and its nuclear armament after 
paving the way for troops' dispatch overseas, poses a big threat 
to the peace in Asia and the world. 
  Japan is racing headlong toward aggression, not breaking 
with 
its imperialist past. How can it be a permanent member of the 
U.N. Security Council whose mission it is to ensure peace and 
security of the world? 
  If Japan is made a permanent member, it will mean 
overlooking 
Japan's failure to liquidate its past and encouraging it to 
commit past crimes again. 
  Before coveting permanent membership, Japan must 
conscientiously repent of its mistake, honestly discharge its 
responsibility for apology and compensation and stop pursuing 
aggression and war.

people Comrade Ho Chi Minh in the anti-imperialist common 
struggle long ago. Our party and people will support and

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 25 April editorial: "The Korean People's </F>
Army, Which Marches Under the Party's Leadership, Is Invincible"] 
  [Text] Today, we are meaningfully marking the 62d 
anniversary of the heroic Korean People's Army [KPA] at a time 
we are crushing vicious challenges from the imperialists and 
reactionaries and vigorously accelerating the general onward 
march movement of socialism of our own style on the strength of 
powerful single-hearted unity around the party and the leader 
[suryong]. 
  On this day, all people across the country extend the 
greatest honor to our Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il, 
who leads the Army and people with boundless boldness, 
steel-like will, and outstanding resourcefulness and, thus, 
strongly defends the country's independence and national 
dignity. They also extend warm congratulations to the heroic 
People's Army officers and men who are defending the 
fatherland's defense lines like an impregnable fortress. 
  The invincibility of the revolutionary cause of the working 
class depends, to an important degree, on the invincibility of 
the revolutionary armed forces which guarantee the fulfillment 
of this cause with the force of arms. To people who aspire for 
independence and are building socialism, nothing is more 
honorable and prouder than having an powerful revolutionary army. 
  The bright future of the chuche revolutionary cause and our 
fatherland's invincible might and high dignity are firmly 
ensured militarily by the heroic KPA. The might of our People's 
Army has not been further strengthened any other time than today 
when it is marching under respected and beloved Supreme 
Commander General Kim Chong-il. This is the great pride of our 
people who are carrying out the revolution. 
  The respected and beloved leader and the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il are great in that they have raised our People's 
Army into an invincible powerful army that can defeat any 
aggression forces. This is also their great achievement. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song founded the Korean 
People's Revolutionary Forces on 25 April in 1932, 62 years ago. 
This was a historic event that gave birth to our party's 
revolutionary armed forces, genuine chuche-type revolutionary 
forces. 
  As a result of the founding of the Korean People's 
Revolutionary Forces, our people's long-cherished desire to have 
their own powerful armed forces was fulfilled brilliantly, and, 
from that time, the proud history of the heroic KPA started. 
  Our revolutionary forces have walked along an honorable road 
of struggle since declaring their birth throughout the world. 
The over 60 years of the KPA's march were an honorable road 
along which the KPA has won victory after victory while 
overcoming numerous trials as dictated by the party and the 
leader [suryong]. They were also brilliant annals in which it 
has brought about immortal achievements for the fatherland and 
the nation and the era and the revolution. 
  Our People's Army has always been able to honorably fulfill 
its noble mission along a long road and has strengthened and 
developed into a revolutionary invincible army. This was only 
possible because there was the wise leadership of the respected 
and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  Our Army could win the two wars against powerful enemies and 
strongly defend the independence of the country and the nation 
because it was led by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. 
  All brilliant revolutionary feats on this land are filled 
with the blood and sweat of our People's Army officers and men 
who have devotedly fought for the fatherland's freedom and 
independence, the people's happiness, and a victory in the 
anti-imperialist cause of independence. The People's Army's 
immortal achievements--that it honorably fulfilled its historic 
mission for the era and the revolution and the fatherland and 
the people by displaying boundless loyalty toward the party and 
the leader [suryong], a spirit of sacrifice, and indomitable 
patriotism--will be eternally brilliant with the proud history 
of the Korean revolution. 
  Our revolutionary armed forces, which were founded under 
the leadership of the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song and have traversed the path to glorious victory, have 
come to a new high level in their own development by upholding 
the great iron-willed commander General Kim Chong-il [widaehan 
kangchorui yongjang Kim Chong-il changgun] as the supreme 
commander. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Comrade Kim 
Chong-il has the indomitable will, mettle, distinguished 
resourcefulness and tactics [yonggunsul] befitting the supreme 
commander of the revolutionary armed forces. Herein lies the 
guarantee for the endless consolidation and development of and 
ever-victoriousness of our revolutionary armed forces. 
  The invincibility of the revolutionary armed forces depends 
upon the greatness of the supreme commander who is leading them. 
When they uphold the great supreme commander, the armed forces 
can become (?matchless) strong ones. 
  Today, our revolutionary armed forces pride themselves upon 
being the ever-victorious, invincible revolutionary armed forces 
which can smash any formidable enemy [kuotton chonha taejokto 
chobushilsuinnun]. This is totally because we are upholding the 
iron-willed commander General Kim Chong-il as our revolutionary 
armed forces' supreme commander who embodies the features of an 
outstanding military strategist and distinguished commander 
[yongjang] at the noblest level. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, equipped with both 
literary and military accomplishments, has paid much attention 
to the work to consolidate and develop the People's Army--the 
core of the self-reliant national defense capabilities--with the 
fate of the country and the people on his shoulders from the 
early days on, thereby carrying out energetic activities and 
making immortal achievements. 
  Without the dear comrade leader's outstanding wisdom [yeji] 
and refined tactics, we cannot talk about our People's Army 
being the ranks of loyalty which are fighting by dedicating 
their lives to the party and the leader [suryong] and about its 
having been consolidated and developed into a 
one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary armed force which can smash 
any enemy, nor can we think of the fact that we have come to 
have a firm military guarantee on which the socialist cause of 
chuche can be firmly defended from generation to generation. 
  The immortal achievements made by our supreme commander 
General Kim Chong-il in the implementation of the cause of 
building our revolutionary armed forces lie, above all, in the 
fact that he has brightly illuminated the future path, which our 
People's Army should traverse, by putting forth the most correct 
and original military ideologies and theories. 
  To illuminate the correct path to the building of our 
revolutionary armed forces and to the victory of the 
revolutionary war by putting forth correct military ideologies 
and theories is the primary mission of the commander [yongyang] 
who is leading the armed forces. The greatness of the commander 
lies right in the greatness of military ideologies and of 
strategies and tactics. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has developed and 
enriched the chuche-oriented military ideologies and theories, 
which the great leader created, on a wholesale scale with his 
matchless, outstanding military wisdom and with his activities 
denying himself sleep and rest. 
  The military ideologies and theories put forth by our 
supreme 
commander General Kim Chong-il are, in a thoroughgoing manner, 
the chuche-oriented military ideologies based on the 
masses-centered philosophical principle; are the encyclopedic 
theories encompassing all sectors and all fields of building the 
armed forces; and are the most scientific and revolutionary 
theories whose justness and invincible vitality have remarkably 
been corroborated in the revolutionary practice of our era. 
  Herein lies a comprehesive compilation about the 
theoretical, 
practical matters arising from the building of the revolutionary 
armed foces of our era, ranging from the mission of the 
revolutionary armed forces of the working class, to the 
principles and methods in building the armed forces, and to the 
complete displaying of the might of the revolutionary armed 
forces. 
  To have the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's outstanding 
military ideologies and theories, which are consistent in terms 
of their revolutionary and scientic nature, is the great fortune 
of our people and People's Army. 
  As long as the chuche-oriented military ideologies and 
theories illuminated by the dear comrade leader exist, our 
revolutionary armed forces will reliably safeguard our socialist 
cause, while firmly defending in an unflinching way their 
revolutionary nature as the armed forces of the leader 
[suryong], the party and the people under any circumstances. 
  Another immortal achievement of the iron-willed sagacious 
supreme commander General Kim Chong-il accumulated along the 
road of strengthening and developing our People's Army is having 
strengthened and developed our revolutionary armed forces into a 
matchlessly strong army fully prepared in political, 
ideological, military, and technological aspects with his 
outstanding and tested leadership. 
  The might of the revolutionary army is the political and 
ideological might which can be most highly displayed when it is 
combined with modern military technology. While ensuring 
priority on the work of firmly preparing the People's Army in 
political and ideological aspects, our comrade supreme commander 
energetically led the work of strengthening its military and 
technological aspects. 
  Due to the wise leadership of the supreme commander General 
Kim Chong-il, our People's Army has been strengthened and 
developed into a victorious army fully prepared in political and 
ideological aspects as well as in military and technological 
aspects. 
  Today, our People's Army's political and moral trait is 
excellent. The entire Army is filled with loyalty toward the 
party and the leader, and revolutionary military discipline is 
being firmly maintained. 
  All the officers and men of the People's Army are highly 
upholding the leadership of the comrade supreme commander with 
revolutionary will of becoming bullets and bombshells to defend 
the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander with their 
lives, and are creating heroic feats and miracles in carrying 
out their military duties. 
  There is no such an invincible army in this world like our 
People's Army, which bears ardent loyalty and absolute worship 
toward its supreme commander, and of which revolutionary 
military discipline is thoroughly established so as to 
unconditionally implement the supreme commander's order and 
guidance without any ups and downs anytime under any 
circumstances. 
  Our People's Army is fully prepared in military and 
technological aspects. The People's Army is equipped with 
modern weapons and combat technology equipment. All the 
soldiers are skillfully handling their weapons and combat 
technology equipment with deep military knowledge and 
technology. It is a proud aspect of our People's Army to 
display the mighty appearance of invincible revolutionary armed 
forces possessing powerful offensive and defensive means, and 
unique chuche-motivated war method. 
  Today, the might of our People's Army, which has been 
strengthened and developed into a victorious army, gives faith 
to our people and the world's revolutionary people. Our party 
is able to persistently push forward with the struggle to 
complete the chuche cause with firm determination because there 
is the mighty People's Army. Our people are able to accelerate 
the socialist construction with high spirit and strong 
confidence in the fierce confrontation against the enemies 
because they have the firm faith in the invincible might of the 
People's Army. 
  In addition to strengthening the People's Army in various 
ways, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, chairman of the DPRK 
Defense Commission and supreme commander of the KPA, brilliantly 
achieved the work of making all the people armored and 
fortifying the entire country, thus firmly established an 
all-people, all-country defensive system across the country, and 
wisely led the work of building up a mighty, self-reliant 
national defense industry. As a result, the entire country has 
been literally turned into an impregnable fortress. 
  As long as we have our mighty, self-reliant national defense 
power which has the matchless People's Army as the core, no 
enemy can intrude our fatherland's security. 
  Another immortal achievement of our supreme commander 
General 
Kim Chong-il accumulated during the days of leading the cause of 
military construction to brilliant victory is having further 
consolidated the unity of ideology and will between the Army and 
the people by thoroughly embodying the idea of the Army-people 
unity. 
  How the Army and the people firmly unite in one mind and one 
will is a decisive factor of the victory of revolution. 
  An army that does not receive support from the people 
cannot sufficiently manifest its might even though it has 
up-to-date equipment and will be defeated in every war. 
  In our country, the traditional virtue of Army-people unity 
is wholly blossoming at a new high stage by highly upholding the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the benevolent father 
[chaaeroun oboi] of our people and officers and men of the 
People's Army, as the supreme commander. The officers and men 
of our People's Army love the people whenever and wherever, are 
devoting everything for the people's interest, and our people 
are actively supporting and encouraging the People's Army both 
materially and morally. 
  Our People's Army and people are verbally united together in 
which they cannot be separated even it they wanted to, and there 
is no power in this world that can break this great 
single-hearted unity. We are able to easily defeat any powerful 
enemy because of the single-hearted unity of the Army and people 
impregnably united around the respected and beloved comrade 
supreme commander. 
  Truly, General Kim Chong-il, the ever-victorious iron-willed 
military commander, is an extraordinary military genius who 
leads our revolutionary force toward brilliant victories and 
glory. Through extraordinary wisdom and outstanding art of 
commanding the Army, our comrade supreme commander has 
brilliantly solved all problems arising in the construction of 
the revolutionary armed force, and he resolutely smashed 
[chitbusyoborisiotta] the enemies' challenge through our 
peerless courage and iron-like will. 
  Even under the especially difficult condition in frustrating 
the U.S. imperialists' maneuver of aggression and provocation 
and in constructing socialism, the dear comrade leader provided 
a peerless powerful army that can smash [ttaeryo pusilsuinnun] 
any kind of enemy. Such achievement by the dear comrade leader 
will eternally shed light along with the victorious advance of 
the chuche cause. 
  While reflecting with deep sentiment upon the proud history 
in which our revolutionary armed forces had walked, the officers 
and men of our People's Army and all the people are feeling in 
their hearts the extraordinary greatness of General Kim Chong-il 
who is wholly embodying the trait and temperament of an 
iron-like military commander, and are overflowing with the firm 
determination to carry out the revolution to the end according 
to the leadership of the comrade supreme commander. 
  Today we are faced with the heavy and honorary task of 
further strengthening the revolutionary armed forces and to 
achieve ahead of schedule the fatherland's independent 
reunification and the ultimate victory in the chuche 
revolutionary cause in accordance with the demand of the 
prevailing situation. 
  Currently in our country, a tense situation is being created 
in which we do not know when a war may break out at any time 
because of the imperialists' vicious antisocialist and 
antirepublic maneuvers. Reality demands that the might of our 
People's Army must be all the more strengthened. 
  The People's Army is the core of the self-defensive national 
defense capacity and a reliable defender of our party's cause. 
The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has firm faith in the 
People's Army and is exerting efforts night and day to 
strengthen and develop it so that the chuche revolutionary cause 
can be completed to the end. We must all the more strengthen our 
revolutionary armed force by brilliantly succeeding and 
developing the immortal achievements in accumulating the cause 
of military building by the respected and beloved comrade 
supreme commander. 
  The comrade supreme commander's leadership is the life of 
the 
People's Army and a decisive element in the victory in military 
building and military activities. All the officers and men of 
the People's Army must highly uphold the comrade supreme 
commander's leadership and must consistently adhere to the 
party's line of modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea. 
  All the soldiers must firmly arm themselves with the great 
General Kim Chong-il's ideology and theory of military building, 
and assimilate loyalty toward the comrade supreme commander as 
their faith, consciousness, morality, and life to further 
strengthen the political and ideological might of the People's 
Army. Along with this, the whole Army's revolutionary army 
trait of fulfilling to the end the order and instruction of the 
comrade supreme commander by going through fire and water must 
be all the more firmly established, and all the soldiers must be 
prepared to become a man of combative spirit of 
one-a-match-for-100. 
  Highly manifesting the virtue of unity between officers and 
men and unity between the party and society is an important 
guarantee in strengthening the might of our People's Army. 
  [Text] Commanders of the People's Army should treasure and 
love their soldiers, sharing their fate, joys, and sorrows, and 
soldiers should respect and follow their commanders. All party 
members in the People's Army should be a model in their military 
life and properly help and lead members of the Socialist Working 
Youth League in the Army. Members of the league should emulate 
the model of party members and should become models in 
implementing the party's army building ideology and policy. 
  Singehearted unity is the basic principle of our revolution 
and is an ever-victorious banner. We have consistently advanced 
our revolution with the might of singlehearted unity around the 
party and the leader [suryong] while surmounting multilayered 
barriers. 
  Our people and all officers and men of the People's Army 
should firmly safeguard and defend the tradition of our proud 
singlehearted unity and glorify it generation after generation. 
  All people and officers and men of the People's Army should 
uphold the leadership of General Kim Chong-il, the respected and 
beloved supreme commander, with the single mind of loyalty and 
filial piety and with the faith in certain victory that as long 
as General Kim Chong-il, the respected and beloved supreme 
commander, is with us we will win without fail. Thus, all the 
people and all the Army should firmly unite as one mind and 
resolutely defend the party and the leader [suryong]. 
  Unity between the Army and the people is the source of our 
singlehearted unity. It is also a firm guarantee for the victory 
of the revolutionary war. 
  The laudable tradition of the unity between the Army and the 
people which is being enhanced in our society today is an 
expression of their lofty mental world to share to the end 
destiny with the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il under any 
difficult circumstances. 
  All the people and officers and men of the People's Army 
should further bring our party's great ideology of unity between 
the Army and the people into fuller bloom. 
  Soldiers of the People's Army should become genuine sons and 
daughters who love the people and who fight for the people, 
devoting their lives. The people should treasure and love 
soldiers of the People's Army like blood brothers and should 
actively help it. 
  Defending the socialist fatherland is a task by all of the 
people. 
  As long as imperialism remains and as long as the reckless 
war provocation maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and their 
stooges continue we should not mitigate our alertness. All party 
members and the working people should firmly arm themselves with 
our party's chuche-oriented view on war and should firmly 
establish in the whole society the ethos of attaching importance 
to military affairs and learning military affairs fervently. 
Thus, they should fully have political and ideological 
preparations and military preparations, that is, material 
preparations so as to cope with any unexpected situation. 
  National reunification is our people's supreme task that 
should not be delayed even for a moment. Today, the South Korean 
puppet clique is advancing toward the road of relying on outside 
forces, not toward the road of national independence, while 
turning away the desire for reunification of the nation. It is 
attempting to stage a nuclear war exercise against our republic 
in collusion with the U.S. imperialists. However, no matter what 
a large-scale war exercise the U.S. imperialists and the South 
Korean puppet clique may try to stage and, thus, to drive 
North-South relations to a dangerous phase they cannot block the 
unanimous desire of the whole nation for reunification. 
  All of the people should sternly smash the antireunification 
forces' maneuvers and should more vigorously fight to expedite 
the day of national reunification. 
  The internal and external situation of our revolution is 
still complicated and tense. However, we have nothing to fear. 
Our revolutionary armed forces are the ones which have the habit 
of being always victorious for some 60 long years. They are also 
the ever-victorious revolutionary armed forces which uphold 
General Kim Chong-il, the most famous general in the world, as 
their supreme commander. 
  The future of our People's Army which is reliably defending 
the chuche revolutionary cause under the leadership of the 
respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song, who is the 
most veteran and great leader of our times, and General Kim 
Chong-il, the supreme commander, will await only brilliant 
victory and glory. 
  Long live the 62d anniversary of the founding of the heroic 
KPA.

<F P=106> ["Papers Observe 62nd Birthday of KPA" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- Papers today dedicate 
editorials to the 62nd anniversary of the founding of the heroic 
Korean People's Army [KPA]. 
  NODONG SINMUN in an editorial titled "Invincible Is the 
Korean People's Army Advancing Under the Party's Leadership" 
says: 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song founded the Korean 
People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) on April 25, 1932, 62 years 
ago. It was a historic event which gave birth to the 
revolutionary Armed Forces of the Workers' Party of Korea, true 
revolutionary Armed Forces of chuche type. The founding of the 
KPRA meant the brilliant realisation of the ages-long desire of 
the Korean people to have their own strong army and the 
beginning of the proud history of the heroic Korean People's 
Army (KPA). 
  Our revolutionary Armed Forces which were founded and have 
covered a glorious course of victory under the guidance of the 
respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song are now on a new, higher 
stage of development with general Kim Chong-il, a great 
iron-willed brilliant commander, as their supreme commander. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said: 
  "Comrade Kim Chong-il has an indomitable will and grit, 
outstanding wisdom and commanding art as befits the supreme 
commander of the revolutionary Armed Forces. This guarantees a 
constant strengthening and development of our revolutionary 
Armed Forces and their invincibility." 
  The immortal exploits performed by our Supreme Commander 
General Kim Chong-il in the cause of building our revolutionary

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- Yi In-mo, a former war 
correspondent of the Korean People's Army [KPA], who is known as 
an incarnation of faith and will, visited the Yim Chang-sun unit 
of the Korean People's Army together with his family on April 23 
to congratulate the soldiers on the 62nd founding anniversary of 
the People's Army and present souvenirs to them. 
  Witnessing the great might of the People's Army which defies 
comparison with that 40 odd years ago, Yi expressed deep 
reverence for Comrade Kim Chong-il, supreme commander, who has 
built an invincible army which no formidable enemy dare provoke. 
  Recalling that the enemy in South Korea put him to all sorts 
of tortures to convert him, but could not bring him to his 
knees, Yi said: 
  "I fought till victory with the conviction that I would win 
surely, as there was for me the great General Kim Il-song. 
  "Touring different places of the socialist motherland, I was 
charmed by the great idea and guidance of the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il for the country and the people. 
  "We will certainly win because the dear leader is with us. 
  "Let all of us defend general Kim Chong-il with our lives." 
  Yi In-mo wrote in the unit's combat register: "Let us be 
rifles and bombs defending general Kim Chong-il, the greatest 
general in the world, with death."

<F P=106> ["KPA, Invincible Revolutionary Armed Forces" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- Today is the 62nd 
anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army [KPA]. 
On this occasion, the entire people warmly congratulate the 
valiant officers and men of the People's Army who are firmly 
defending the cause of socialism. 
  The KPA is invincible revolutionary Armed Forces which have 
made immortal contributions to achieving the independence and 
sovereignty of the country and defending the gains of socialism 
over the past 60 years. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has said: 
  "The proud feats performed by the People's Army and the mass 
heroism displayed by the officers and men of the People's Army 
in the course of our revolution will shine forever together with 
the revolutionary history of our party." 
  The KPA (Korean People's Revolutionary Army in the period of 
the anti-Japanese armed struggle) is a proud Army of the people 
that played a decisive role in accomplishing the historical 
cause of the liberation of the country. 
  The first revolutionary Armed Forces of the Korean people 
were founded on April 25, 1932, in the darkest period of the 
Japanese imperialist rule (1905-1945). The great leader 
President Kim Il- song who embarked upon the road of revolution, 
shouldering the destiny of the country and the nation, made a 
deep analysis of the state of the early communist movement and 
the independence movement and concluded that a struggle by 
standing revolutionary Armed Forces is the only way of 
liberating the country. He set before the young communists and 
patriotic young people the slogan "Arms is our life and soul! 
Arms to arms!" 
  It was early in the 1930s. In response to his call, a bloody 
struggle was waged to obtain weapons inside Korea and in broad 
areas of North and South Manchuria. On the basis of these 
preparations, he proclaimed the birth of the first revolutionary 
Armed Forces. The Korean People's Revolutionary Army grew to be 
steel-like ranks, invincible revolutionary Armed Forces in the 
flames of the protracted anti-Japanese armed struggle and, at 
last, defeated Japanese imperialism and accomplished the cause 
of liberation of the country in August 1945. 
  After the liberation it was strengthened into the regular 
Korean People's Army with all services and arms. 
  The invincible might of the KPA was fully displayed in the 
three-year fatherland liberation war against the invasion of the 
U.S. imperialists and their allied forces. The U.S. 
imperialists mobilized huge Armed Forces two million strong and 
all the uptodate combat and technical equipment in the Korean 
war. But the valiant KPA fighters took the initiative in the 
whole period of the war by overpowering the numerical and 
technical superiority of the U.S. Forces with political and 
ideological, strategic and tactical superiority. The Japanese 
book Land Battle Dictionary Vol. 4 says: "The North Korean Army 
was a tough opponent which applied confrontal attack, surprising 
and other diverse tactics which the U.S. Forces had not 
experienced." 
  The Korean people and People's Army killed, wounded and 
captured more than 1.567 million enemy effectives including 
above 405,000 U.S. troops in the war. And it captured, downed, 
sank or destroyed a fabulous amount of combat and technical 
equipment including over 12,200 warplanes, above 3,250 tanks and 
armoured vehicles and more than 560 warships, defending the 
country with honor. The war ended in a great victory of the 
Korean people. 
  The KPA has reliably defended the security of the country 
and 
the people in the period of socialist construction, too. Each 
time the U.S. imperialists committed provocations such as the 
intrusion of the armed spy ship "Pueblo" (January 1967) and the 
case of the large spy plane "EC-121" (April 1969), the KPA dealt 
a decisive counterblow at them and smashed their new war 
provocation manoeuvres. 
  The Korean People's Army has entered a new period of an 
epochal turn in the long history of its development by 
acclaiming Comrade Kim Chong-il, a genius of military affairs, 
as its supreme commander. 
  Today the KPA is united rock-firm around Comrade Kim 
Chong-il 
on the basis of loyalty to the party and the leader and 
revolutionary comradeship. It has earned itself fame as 
powerful revolutionary Armed Forces.

the participants in the national coal industry functionaries' 
meeting delivered by Han Song-yong, member of the Political 
Bureau and secretary of the WPK Central Committee, at the 
first-day sitting of the meeting held at the People's Palace of 
Culture in Pyongyang on 20 April--read by announcer] 
  [Text] A congratulatory message to the participants in the 
national coal industry functionaries' meeting: 
  The national coal industry functionaries' meeting is 
convening at a time when all the party members and working 
people are vigorously waging the battle of the first year of the 
period of adjustment with wholehearted unity around the party 
and the leader to implement our party's revolutionary economic 
strategy. The meeting is a significant meeting to display the 
militant spirit of our people and the working people of the coal 
industry sector who are vigorously advancing along the road of 
the revolution's victory by demonstrating the invincibility of 
our-style socialism under the chuche revolutionary banner 
unperturbed by the imperialists' vicious challenge. 
  The Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee sends 
warm congratulations to the participants in the meeting and all 
the functionaries and coal miners of the coal industry sector 
who have registered great labor exploits in implementing the 
party's chuche-oriented coal industrial policy by waging a 
devoted struggle for the growth and prosperity of the socialist 
fatherland and the happiness of our people with high loyalty to 
the party and the leader. 
  The coal front is one of the most important fronts for our 
people's economy, and a lifeline for bringing a breakthrough in 
the struggle to implement the revolutionary economic strategy 
put forth by our party. The party members and working people of 
the coal industry sector have actively contributed to the 
enhancement of the country's wealth, power, and development and 
the people's happiness with a devoted struggle and creative 
labor under the wise leadership of the party and the leader with 
firm faith in socialism, and have attained great success in 
developing the country's coal industry. 
  The functionaries of the coal industry sector and the coal 
miners have reconstructed and expanded in a modern way the 
large-scale coal mines in Anju, Sunchon, Pukchang, and Tokchon 
districts within a short period, displaying an indomitable 
fighting spirit with high self-awareness befitting the master of 
the revolution. Developing numerous coal mines in promising 
districts, they have registered a proud exploit of drastically 
increasing coal production capacity. 
  The functionaries and working people of the coal industry 
sector built strong mining facility production bases and coal 
prospecting and coal mine construction force all over the 
country highly displaying revolutionary enthusiasm and creative 
enterprising spirit. By so doing, they attained brilliant 
success in strengthening the coal industry's material and 
technological base. 
  The workers and technicians of the coal industry intensified 
their creative cooperation so that they could enhance the 
mechanization standard of coal mining work and extensively 
introduced advanced technological processes and work methods. 
By so doing, they are modernizing coal mines and producing more 
coal while working more joyfully. 
  Today, the coal industry of our country has great production 
potential capable of smoothly satisfying the need of the 
people's economy for coal. At the same time, it dependably 
ensures the strengthening and development of a self-reliant 
socialist national economy and invincible might. This proud 
success attained by the coal industry sector is the noble effort 
of the coal industry sector functionaries and coal miners who 
are working diligently in underground pits thousands of fathoms 
deep devoting their clean conscience and sincere labor in 
upholding our party's coal industry policy for the party, the 
revolution, the country, and the people, irrespective of whether 
someone recognizes their hard work. 
  The WPK Central Committee highly appreciates the great labor 
exploits of the functionaries and working people of the coal 
industry sector that were attained in the struggle to increase 
coal production by implementing the party's coal industrial 
policy of upholding the leadership of the party and the leader. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Coal plays 
a very important role in the country's industrial development 
and the people's livelihood. 
  The struggle to attain great upsurges in coal production 
today is a very important and honorable struggle to accelerate 
overall socialist construction by implementing the party's 
agriculture-first policy, light industry-first policy, and 
trade-first policy. At the same time, it is a sacred struggle 
to crush [chitpusida] the maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists and 
reactionaries who are going wild to blockade [pongswae] and 
stifle [chilsik] our country-- the fortress of socialism--and to 
defend, adhere to, and add further luster to our country's 
socialism centered on the popular masses. 
  All the functionaries and working people of the coal 
industry 
sector should protect the party by increasing coal production as 
the steel fighters upheld the party by increasing the production 
of steel during the difficult post-war period and defended the 
line of socialist economic construction. In so doing, they 
should protect the party with coal production, and defend 
our-style socialism more firmly and add further luster to it. 
  The functionaries and coal miners of the coal industry 
sector 
should firmly arm themselves with our party's chuche idea, 
uphold the party wholeheartedly and loyally. With firm faith 
that our socialism, enjoying the great party's leadership, will 
certainly be victorious, they should thoroughly implement the 
party's coal mining policy on the principle of absoluteness and 
unconditionality. 
  Highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and fortitude that overflowed the majestic Mt. 
Paektu during the period of anti-Japanese revolutionary 
struggle, all functionaries and coal miners should courageously 
overcome all kinds of difficulties and barriers facing them in 
coal production. With a firm determination to resolve 
everything with one's own strength, even if the higher echelons 
do not supply the necessities--although it would be better if 
the higher echelons did supply them--they should wage the 
struggle to increase coal production earnestly and persistently, 
filled to overflowing with revolutionary optimism. 
  They should actively wage the struggle to reinforce the 
repair and maintenance bases at coal mines and ensure, on their 
own, the necessary conditions for production of facilities, 
parts, supplies, and light tools necessary for coal production. 
  They should accelerate the modernization of coal mines and 
achieve endless upsurges in coal production by more forcefully 
carrying out the technological revolution. 
  They should put effort into the replacement of facilities 
with large, modern, and high-speed ones in carrying out the 
technological revolution and into the mechanization and 
comprehensive mechanization of the work inside mining pits, and 
diversification of transport. 
  They should widely accept advanced mining methods and 
technological procedures while producing more modern machine 
units fit for our country's coal fields and revamping the 
structure and framework of mine pits in this connection. 
  They should try to actively solve scientific and 
technological problems arising from developing and introducing 
modern machine units and production methods while putting forth 
more innovations of new technologies, creative designs, and 
rationalization plans by bringing together the wisdom and 
efforts of workers and technicians, introducing them into 
production on a timely basis, and decisively enhancing the role 
of scientists. 
  The functionaries in the coal industrial sector should have 
the production proceed in accordance with the production process 
by conducting well the technological management of facilities, 
increasing their utilization rate, dovetailing the production 
processes with each other in a thorough-going way, and solving 
pending problems on a timely basis. 
  The functionaries in the coal industrial sector should 
increase the coal production per coal mining site and build more 
of new coal mines and mining pits by reconstructing and 
expanding the mining pits of the existing coal mines, focusing 
on production, and simplifying the transport system. 
  Giving priority to exploring, digging, and mining is an 
inviolable rule in the development of coal industry. The 
functionaries in the coal industrial sector should create more 
new coal fields by carrying out scrupulously the work to 
increase exploring capability, reinforce technological 
equipment, and to introduce advanced exploration methods, 
thereby endlessly increasing the efficiency and speed of 
exploration, securing more coal deposits, and forcefully 
carrying out the high-speed digging movement. 
  Much attention should be paid to conserving coal resources 
and making an effective use of them. With a deep understanding 
of the justness of our party's policy to develop the economy in 
a chuche-oriented way on the basis of coal resources, coal mines 
should wage an active struggle to dig coal thoroughly without 
loss, completely dig the shallow coal bed, and widely use 
low-calorie coal. 
  The functionaries in the coal industrial sector should pay 
great attention to the labor security and safeguard in 
conformity with the characteristic of the work inside the mining 
pits and solidifying the indoctrination of labor security and 
safeguard for coal miners, thus having them strictly abide by 
standard manufacturing procedure and labor security and 
safeguard. 
  Rear-area services for coal miners should be further 
improved. Thoroughly realizing the party's intention not to 
spare anything for the coal miners, the functionaries should 
give priority to supplying coal miners with (?workers' supplies) 
and subsidiary food on a priority basis, and firmly manage the 
rear-area bases of supplies including meat, eggs, and vegetables 
at coal mines, produce more subsidiary food of various kinds, on 
their own, and supply them for the coal miners. 
  They should help give top priority to supplying facilities 
and materials so as to normalize coal production at a high 
level, to give solid priority to the coal industry, and to 
further accelerate the country's overall economic development. 
Various sectors of the people's economy, such as metal, 
machine, and forestry industries, should also carry out well the 
work of insuring the necessary conditions for production of 
various machine units including compressors, (?electric cars and 
railroad ties) on a timely basis, and of supplementing (?labor 
force) and technicians to coal mines. 
  The party work in the coal industrial sector should be 
further solidified in conformity with the demands of the 
developing realities. By firmly putting together functionaries 
and workers around the party and waging the organizational 
political work in a fresh fashion, the party organizations in 
the coal industrial sector should foster all coal miners as coal 
warriors endlessly loyal to the party and have all of them 
become creators of exploits and innovations in the 
implementation of the party's coal policy. Along with this, in 
conformity with the demands of the Taean work system, they 
should further improve the management and operation of coal 
mines, firmly build the production system in which the mining 
pits are the basic battle units. They should strengthen the 
party- oriented guidance so that all problems arising from 
production can be solved on a timely basis under the unified 
command of the planning staff of mining pits. 
  Today, the coal industrial sector is facing a heavy and 
honorable duty. Our party is expressing much confidence in and 
expectation to the functionaries and workers in the coal 
industrial sector. The WPK Central Committee firmly believes 
that all functionaries and coal miners of the coal industrial 
sector will wonderfully repay the party's great confidence and 
expectation by achieving fresh revolutionary upsurges in coal 
production and giving solid priority to the development of coal 
industry, upholding the party's revolutionary economic strategy.

party's revolutionary strategies in hearty response to the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year's address for this year 
and the decision of the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth party 
Central Committee. He mentioned that the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il, who had always paid deep attention to the 
development of the coal industry, expressed his confidence and 
love by convening this meeting and sending a congratulatory 
message signed by the party Central Committee to the meeting. 
  The speaker stressed that the history of our country's 
socialist economic construction, which had been carried out 
along the single road of self-reliance under the banner of the 
chuche idea, started with the work of developing the coal 
industry in the country and that it was a proud history of 
victory and based on the achievements from this work we expanded 
the scale of the people's economy, improved the structure of the 
branches [pumungujo] of the people's economy, and built a 
powerful self-reliant national economy in which coal is used as 
a fuel and resource and a source of power. 
  He also said that when he was leading the work of building a 
new fatherland after the liberation, the great leader described 
the coal industry as a leading sector of the people's economy 
and presented a creative idea of developing this industry ahead 
of other sectors. [passage omitted] 
  The speaker also said that no force can stop our people who, 
filled with confidence and optimism, were marching along the 
single road of chuche while upholding the great leader and the 
dear comrade leader on the vanguard of the revolution. He 
stressed a need for all to achieve single-hearted unity around 
the party and the leader [suryong], bring new turns in coal 
production, and, thus, contribute to defending and maintaining 
socialism of our own style and further glorifying it. 
  The meeting hall was filled with the participants' resolve 
to 
thoroughly implement the tasks presented by the great leader's 
New Year's address for this year and the congratulatory message 
of the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee and, thus, 
repay the party's trust and expectations with loyal deeds. 
Then, a congratulatory group of the Korean Children's Union 
came into the meeting hall and read a congratulatory message. 
  Following this, debates took place at the meeting. [passage

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- A national meeting of 
coal industrial workers was held here from April 20 to 22. 
  The meeting reviewed the achievements and experience gained 
in the coal industrial sector in the past and discussed measures 
to thoroughly carry out the party's revolutionary economic 
strategy by effecting a new upsurge in coal production. 
  Present at the meeting were Premier Kang Song-san and 
Vice-President Yi Chong-ok, Politburo members of the Central 
Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK]. 
  In a congratulatory message to the participants in the 
meeting, the WPK Central Committee said the efforts for a great 
upsurge in coal production were a very important and honorable 
undertaking to accelerate socialist construction as a whole by 
implementing the agriculture-first, light industry-first and 
foreign trade-first policies of the party and a noble struggle 
for smashing the moves of the U.S. imperialists and other 
reactionaries to blockade and stifle the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea, the fortress of socialism, and defending and 
further developing Korean socialism centred on the popular 
masses. 
  It called upon all the officials and workers engaged in the 
coal industrial sector to defend the party and firmly safeguard 
Korean-style socialism and further develop it with increased 
coal production. 
  Hong Song-nam, alternate Politburo member of the C.C. 
[Central Committee], the WPK and vice-premier of the 
Administration Council, delivered a report at the meeting. 
  He dwelt on the achievements registered in the coal 
industrial sector in the past and future tasks. 
  He said: 
  Over the past three decades the production capacity of the 
coal mines has increased 3.5 times. More than 40 mines and 50 
pits have been built in promising coal fields, with the result 
that Korea now produces in ten days as much coal as was produced 
in 1946. 
  The main tasks facing the coal industrial sector are to 
concentrate investment in coal mines with large deposits and 
favorable excavating conditions, reconstruct the existing coal 
mines on a modern and expansion basis, actively develop new ones 
and, at the same time, vigorously promote the modernization and 
scientification in this sector to fully meet the growing demand 
of the national economy. 
  Speeches were made at the meeting. 
  A letter of pledge to the great leader President Kim Il-song 
and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il was adopted there.

<F P=106> [Article by Kawi Chongkhittawon: "Arms Register: Thailand </F>
Must Allay Fears"] 
  [Text] Thailand is facing a big dilemma on whether to 
join the UN Register of Conventional Arms [UNRCA]. The majority 
of Thai military leaders are still very reserved and treat the 
country's arms data as a national secret. 
  However, the call for more transparency on arms has also 
been 
heard in recent months from a small quarter of liberal Thai 
military thinkers. They view Thailand's willingness to report 
to the UN on its arms holding and purchases as part of 
confidence building measures in the region -- some gestures 
which Thailand can undertake right away. 
  In recent months, there had been some effort to adopt 
"openness" within the Thai armed forces. For example, for the 
first time in Thai history, the Supreme Command Headquarters 
decided to come up with a "Defence White Paper", which contains 
Thailand's short and longterm views on security matters. 
  Although the content of the white paper was revised and 
subsequently toned down, particularly sections relating to 
Thailand's policy towards neighbouring countries, it is still a 
remarkable document. It reveals parts of the hearts and minds 
of Thai military strategists. 
  Since the end of Cold War, the need to have more 
transparency 
in defence procurements has been widely debated and eventually 
accepted as one of the trust-building measures for the region. 
Somehow, quite a few military leaders here believe vehemently 
that Thailand's security could be further compromised if Bangkok 
adheres to the UN arms register. 
  To the Thai military, the prevailing idea is that an arms 
register could mean disarmament in the long-run. They also see 
this mechanism as a Western attempt to control the country's 
defence and security policy. 
  On the other hand, Thailand's pattern of arms procurement in 
the past two decades also poses a barrier to the principle of 
transparency. Although US-made arms remain the core of Thai 
weapons, some cheap and sub-standard ones have also found their 
way into the Thai arsenal. These weapons, mainly Chinese-made, 
were purchased at friendship prices, which were arbitrary. 
Also, most of the transactions were not well-documented either 
at the source or in the recipient countries. Some of the 
military, leaders, have privately expressed concern that an arms 
register could expose this weakness which in turn could have an 
adverse effect on the armed forces. 
  Under the UN Register of Conventional Arms, the 
participating 
countries are voluntarily called upon to provide data on imports 
and exports and other general background on procurement and 
national holding. Therefore, the Thai arms imports from the US 
and other Western countries would be well documented and could 
be identified. 
  Within Asean, Malaysia has proposed the establishment of a 
Regional Arms Register to complement the work of the UN 
Register. So far, there has not been any consensus among Asean 
countries on this issue. The attitude of the Indochinese 
countries is still unknown for the time being. 
  Last year, Singapore was among the eighty countries that 
submitted reports for the UN register. The island republic's 
report is believed to contain information on its conventional 
weapons which includes tanks, armoured combat vehicles, 
artillery systems, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, among 
others. 
  Being the host of the Asean Regional Forum, which will 
discuss the arms register issue, Thailand has a crucial role to 
play. The military leaders would require a proper understanding 
of significances and implications. Indeed, the initiative will 
not limit arms export or import of any weapon, it only monitors 
with the hope that it could reduce suspicions which in the first 
place cause the arms race. 
  Within Asean, Thailand's embrace of the register would send 
a 
positive signal to the region, which of late has harboured high 
levels of suspicion of Thailand's defence posture. The case in 
point is the beefing up of the country's naval forces which has 
already caused concern as it could lead to Thailand having a 
blue water force capacity in the future. The recent decision to 
purchase a used aircraft carrier from Spain does not augur well 
with the general mood within the region. 
  Like it or not, the Thai armed forces have to deal with the 
issue of an arms register sooner or later. Instead of having an 
apprehensive approach to the whole issue, it would be in Thai 
interests to adopt a more forward looking strategy like Malaysia 
and Singapore, which have also increased their arms stockpile in 
the past few years. 
  As one of the original supporters of the idea, broached two 
years ago after the Gulf War, Thailand could begin to contribute 
to this UN effort in a small way by now submitting its defence 
white paper to the UN register, like what the British government 
did last year. Incrementally, it can file reports on categories 
of weapons that the Thais feel comfortable to disclose. 
  Located centrally in mainland Southeast Asia, Thailand's 
transparency is indispensable in shaping the new strategic order 
and making the region safer.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kawi Chongkitthawon: "KR: Thailand Facing </F>
an Image Problem"] 
  [Text] Thailand itself is to be blamed for sitting on the 
fence too long amidst continued allegations of its links with 
the Khmer Rouge. Indeed, it is fighting a losing battle for two 
reasons. 
  Firstly, Thailand is no longer a frontline state. It is now 
virtually standing alone vis-a-vis the international community 
on the Khmer Rouge issue. When the Cambodian leaders decided to 
take the bull by the horns, alleging Thailand of supporting the 
Marxist group, they knew they had the world's support. To the 
world, the Khmer Rouge is the only visible threat to the 
Cambodian government's current endeavour to rebuild the 
war-shattered country, therefore any remaining ties with this 
notorious group, imaginary or real, is unwarranted. 
  Secondly, the threat to use force against Cambodia in 
retaliation against the Cambodian government's allegations, even 
though verbal, has already earned Thailand a reputation of being 
a new "regional bully". In any circumstance, if the tit-for-tat 
is actually carried out, there will be no sympathy for Thailand. 
  In the absence of national reconciliation in the past eight 
months in Cambodia, Thailand's decision makers were at a loss. 
Without any clear policy direction, they resorted to ambiguity 
-- the traditional way of handling sensitive issues with 
neighbouring countries. 
  Since the formation of new Cambodian government last 
September, Thailand has been hoping that the Khmer Rouge would 
be integrated within the new government. Supposedly, it would 
be the only acceptable way out for Thailand's diplomatic 
quagmire. For one thing, Bangkok would be able to maintain the 
status quo in its relations with the group including trade 
links, while being accorded legitimacy as the Marxist faction 
would be part of the government. 
  Unfortunately, the Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge 
have failed to reach an agreement. Eventually, the nature of 
Thailand's link with the Khmer Rouge will depend on how fast the 
latter integrates with Phnom Penh. As long as they are excluded 
and resort to the tactics they have chosen to, it is extremely 
difficult to see a practical termination of Thai-Khmer Rouge 
ties. 
  Even though the Chuan government and armed forces chiefs 
have 
repeatedly assured the leaders in Phnom Penh and the world 
community that Thailand no longer helps the Khmer Rouge, in 
compliance with UN resolutions and in recognition of the new 
Cambodian government, nobody seemed to take Thailand seriously. 
In private discussions, senior Thai officials always linked the 
alleged Thai assistance to unruly individuals, some of them in 
uniform, along the Thai- Cambodian border, who have always taken 
the law in their own hands. 
  If these individuals remain at large and are able to go 
against the Thai government's policy, they must be reprimanded 
immediately. Failure to do so would only strengthen the 
perception of continued Thai assistance to the Khmer Rouge. 
Worse, it would also give credit to the claim that Thailand is 
still playing the Khmer Rouge card as long as the new Cambodian 
government remains hostile to Bangkok. 
  When the Foreign Ministry issued a six-point protest 
statement, trying to attract international sympathy and 
appealing for public understanding, it was an act of 
desperation. The ministry should have known that, as far as 
Thai-Cambodian relations are concerned, it is a different 
ball-game now. It is useless to cry over spilt milk. 
  Certain things can be done to ameliorate the tense 
situation. 
The most important would be discussions among top military 
leaders of the two countries to ensure that there are no rooms 
for misunderstandings. The planned visit of Thai Supreme 
Commander Air Chief Marshal Woranat Aphichari would be a good 
start. 
  Thailand should also consider the possibility of helping 
Cambodia in certain difficult circumstances in handling the 
Khmer Rouge. If need be in the future, they can join in a 
pincer move against the Khmer Rouge. Unfortunately, it would 
require such a drastic action to convince Cambodia and the world 
of Thailand's sincerity. 
  Finally, Thailand has to decide whether the survival of a 
democratically elected Cambodian government or the Marxist group 
is more important. Thailand cannot have both. If Thailand 
chooses the first choice, then the country must go all out to 
support Cambodia without conditions. In case Thailand still 
wants the Khmer Rouge, then Thai leaders should not complain at 
all when allegations are levied against them. 
  There is one caveat. Thailand cannot expect Cambodia to be 
modest. The Cambodian leaders have an enormous task to rebuild 
the country.

  [Text] Phnom Penh will today start taking back nearly 
1,000 Khmer refugees who crossed into Thailand last month to 
flee the fighting between the Khmer Rouge and Cambodian forces, 
head of the Thai-Cambodian Coordination Office (TCCO) Col Amnuai 
Chanchirop said yesterday. 
  Col Amnuai said he was informed by Cambodian representatives 
on the TCCO that their government had reinforced security and 
troops to ensure the safety of the refugees, numbering 958, once 
they return to their Beng Takuan village in Bantaey Meanchey 
province of Cambodia. 
  During the battle between the Khmer Rouge and government 
forces on April 21-22, Beng Takuan was the scene of heavy 
fighting and the villagers fled their bomes and sought refuge in 
Ta Phraya district of Sa Kaew province opposite the Cambodian 
border. 
  Bantaey Meanchey officials told Col Amnuai that most of the 
refugees wished to return to their homes and 7th Army commander 
Gen Kho Chea, in charge of government troops in the province, 
was prepared to guarantee their safety through additional 
reinforcement of men and heavy artillery. 
  The Cambodian representative on TCCO also reiterated his 
government's promise not to engage Khmer Rouge guerrillas near 
the border to prevent endangering the lives of Thai people in 
the area. 
  If Beng Takuan is attacked in the future, the villagers will 
be moved 20 kilometres deeper into Cambodian territory, he said. 
  He also expressed gratitude to the Thai side "for having 
been 
a helping neighbour all along." 
  Meanwhile, active troop movement on both sides--the Khmer 
Rouge and government forces--was seen aroun the area opposite Ta 
Phraya and severa clashes were reported about five to ten 
kilometres from the Thai border. 
  The fighting is expected to continue into the rainy season 
which begins in June. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said his 
Cambodian counterpart Prince Norodom Sirivut called him up 
yesterday from Phnom Penh. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong said he briefed the Prince about his border 
inspection trip over the weekend and the Prince responded by 
saying that he hoped from now on the problem of 
misunderstandings between the two countries could be avoided. 
  "I told him that if he has anything to say he should say it 
to us and not make allegations. 
  "After talking on the phone I think that the situation will 
improve," Sqn Ldr Prasong said. 
  The Prince and other high-ranking Phnom Penh officials have 
lately spoken to foreign news agencies accusing Thailand of 
aiding the Khmer Rouge. 
  The Thai foreign minister denied the charge and filed a 
formal protest letter with Phnom Penh. 
  The repeated accusations have soured relations between 
Bangkok and Phnom Penh to the point where both countries are 
talking about filing complaints with the United Nations. 
  Asked if the Cambodian situation would not cause further 
confusion, Sqn Ldr Prasong said that this was true of all 
politics be it domestic or foreign. 
  Asked about the Thai military's suggestion that Thailand 
protest to Cambodia every time artillery shells land on Thai 
territory from across the border, the Foreign Minister said 
every protest should be backed by reasons and evidence. 
  The ministry has asked the military to gather information on 
all shelling incidents and the damage they have caused. 
  Thailand could then pursue the matter throwgh diplomatic 
channels and could even file a complaint with the UN. 
  Asked about peace talks between all the Khmer factions, Sqn 
Ldr Prasong said Prince Sirivut confirmed that they will be held 
on May 2 according to the wish of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. 
  "Prince Sirivudh said that whether or not the the talks 
prove 
successful will depend on the Khmer Rouge," Sqn Ldr Prasong said.

  [Text] Speaking in an interview with newsmen at Government 
House this morning, Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak said 
the Defense and Foreign Ministries are working together in 
compiling data on Cambodian intrusions, spillover fighting, and 
casualties suffered by Thai people living along the Cambodian 
border. Asked whether the military would hand over directly to 
the United Nations the evidence collected by Thailand, Gen. 
Wichit said the armed forces would let the Foreign Ministry do 
that by taking into consideration the impact on Thai-Cambodian 
relations. 
  [Begin recording] [Wichit] The Foreign Ministry will decide 
which information can be used and whether the political 
situation is appropriate for us to make a protest -- whether the 
good relations would be affected. The Foreign Ministry will 
decide about that, but we are ready to provide it with facts. 
  [Unidentified reporter] To improve the situation, do you 
think the supreme commander should make a visit there? 
  [Wichit] We must try to preserve and promote relations 
between our two countries since we are neighbors. That's what 
we should do. Especially the military, we must try promote good 
relations. There is fighting in Cambodia, and we must work 
together in order to prevent spillover into Thailand. [end

  [Text] The Thai-Burmese regional border committee started 
its ninth meeting in Bangkok yesterday with highlights of 
discussions on illegal Burmese immigrants, disputed border areas 
and fisheries problems. 
  First Army Region Commander Lt Gen Chetha Thanajaro said 
representatives from both sides would first hold unofficial 
talks to accelerate the negotiation process, and that the 
meeting itself will discuss the agreed topics and details. 
  He said bilateral problems abound since the two countries 
share an over 2,000-km-long border, but that previous meetings 
had gradually helped resolve several thorny issues. 
  Many problems cannot be settled in one go, and both sides 
have to hold several more rounds of negotiations to finalize 
their agreement, he added. 
  "For example, on the question of illegal (Burmese) 
immigrants, they (Burmese officials) have pledged to tighten up 
their control, and thus the number has dr@pped from over 300,000 
to about 200,000," he said. 
  Bangkok will be the venue of the first three-day meeting, 
while both sides will meet on the fourth in Pattaya. The 
Burmese team, headed by Southern Commander Maj Gen Khet Sein, 
will on Friday pay a visit to the petrochemical industries in 
Lam Chabang Eastern Seaboard.

  [Text] The Department of Intellectual Property has been 
entrusted to draft a legislation for the protection of rice and 
other crop varieties. Deputy Commerce Minister Churin 
Laksanawisit says when the legislation takes effect, other 
people will not be allowed to make use of the rice and other 
crop varieties without consent of the owner who obtains specific 
varieties through cross breeding. Mr. Churin says the 
legislation will prevent other countries from taking Thai rice 
varieties to be further developed in their countries to enable 
them to become Thailand's major competitors for rice exports. 
  He says Vietnam has a policy to promote the cultivation of 
Hom Mali variety because of better prices it fetches compared 
with other varieties. However, the country has been faced with 
the problem of plant diseases; therefore, its Hom Mali output is 
still unsatisfactory. 
  Mr. Churin says Thailand and Vietnam have already concluded 
a 
memorandum of understanding on cooperation in rice exports. 
Both countries will later hold consultations on prices of rice 
exports. They may set the median price to avoid price 
undercutting.

  [Text] Saraburi: More than ten thousand Hmong hilltribes 
will remain in the Tham Kabok Buddhist sanctuary until they are 
cured of their drug addiction and the Thai government decides to 
resettle them, said Phra Chamrun Phanchandra, the abbot of Tham 
Kabok. 
  The abbot said his duty is to cure those addicts and provide 
them with vocational training. Many members of the Hmong 
hilltribes, who lived in the highland areas of Laos before being 
driven out by political turbulence, are addicted to smoking 
opium. 
  "If the government is concerned about any negative impact to 
its security, it can let me know and I will stop treating them 
and do whatever the government wishes me to," said Phra Chamrun. 
  The abbot is known for his dedication to the treatment of 
drug addicts at his Buddhist center. So far, a large number of 
Hmong people have come to him for treatment, bringing along 
their family members and dependents. 
  These people came from the northern Thai-Lao border area 
which was used as a springboard by Hmong rebels for fighting 
against the communist Laotian government. The anti-Lao Hmong 
were trained by the CIA during the Indochina War to fight for 
the right-wing Lao faction against the communist Pathet Lao. 
  After the fall of Laos in 1975 to the communist Pathet Lao, 
the Hmong were driven to the border area near northern Thailand 
where they staged their resistance. The Vientiane government 
has tried to wipe out the Hmong resistance, but these people 
sought refuge in Thailand, thus creating a sore point in 
Thai-Lao relations. 
  The Laotian government wants Thailand to stop providing 
refuge to the rebels. However Thailand feels that they are 
providing the refugees with humanitarian aid. 
  Some Laotian officials have accused Thailand of helping the 
Hmong resistance but these charges were countered by the Thai 
military's challenge that Laos provide evidence to back up its 
claims. Abbot Chamrun said: "We have some contacts with the 
Laotian (government) side ... but we have yet to arrange a 
formal meeting." 
  The dedicated Thai monk, who won a Magsaysay award for his 
contribution to the treatment of drug addicts, now wants to 
resettle the Hmong: "They need to be cured first. After they 
are cured, I would like to see them resettled in a lowland area 
so that they won't go back to drugs again. 
  Right now, another batch of about 2,000 Hmongs want to come 
and receive treatment here, but there's no place for them.

<F P=106> [By Anurat Maniphan] </F>
  [Text] Hanoi -- Thailand yesterday proposed the setting up 
of sub-regional subcommittees as part of a strategy for success 
in economic cooperation among six countries sharing the Mekong 
River. 
  The proposal was put forward by Deputy Prime Minister 
Suphachai Phanitchaphak at the ministerial meeting of the Third 
Conference on Sub-regional Economic Cooperation organised by the 
Asia Development Bank [ADB]. 
  Mr Suphachai stressed that the subcommittees would not serve 
a bureaucratic purpose. 
  Their function would be to "see to it that the recommended 
projects in all sectors are implemented in due time". 
  He said later there should be subcommittees on all areas of 
economic cooperation manned by experts. 
  Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Burma and south China are 
discussing and in some cases have started cooperation in 
transport, energy, environment, trade and investment, human 
resources and tourism. 
  Mr Suphachai said the sub-regional plans were "widely known 
in the outside world". 
  "Responsibility rests on our shoulders to keep the momentum 
of this effort and to agree to move ahead with certain projects 
as soon as we can," he said. 
  "There is no choice here but to succeed." 
  Besides the sub-regional subcommittees, the deputy prime 
minister proposed three other points towards what he called a 
strategy for success. 
  Firstly, he urged sub-regional states to start with projects 
that are "most feasible, least costly and therefore eligible for 
concessional financing". 
  Secondly, he called on participants to agree on "fair terms" 
for the use of infrastructure network. 
  "The aim which must always be kept in mind is to make this 
network a most efficient means of economic development and not 
an end in itself," he said. 
  Lastly, he urged encouragement of stronger cooperation among 
the private sector. 
  While governments should offer the right framework and 
facilities, business people ultimately would be doing the work. 
  Elaborating on the first point, he drew attention to the 
transport sector and cited the so-called East-West Corridor, an 
overland road link between Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. 
  In the energy sector, he welcomed the shift of emphasis from 
self-sufficiency to a more integrated approach. 
  He urged a well-planned energy management system for the 
sub- 
region and serious consideration of the possibility of a grid 
connection. 
  On the environment, he expressed concern over air pollution 
and marine oil spills and noted a need to standardise 
legislation. 
  He offered facilities at Thailand's Environmental Research 
and Training Centre, set up with help from JICA [expansion 
unknown] of Japan, for sub-regional training in monitoring, 
impact assessment as well as management. 
  In human resources, he spoke of Thai Government plans to set 
up a centre for training in agriculture, health, finance, the 
hotel industry and development planning in the sub-region. 
  He also welcomed the recommendation that health co-operation 
include HIV/AIDS prevention and malaria control. 
  In tourism, he supported the idea of promoting the 
sub-region 
as one rich in nature, culture and diverse life-styles, and 
backed the proposal for a sub-regional tourism forum. 
  Mr Suphachai emphasised Thailand's "strong commitment" to 
sub- regional cooperation by pointing out that Prime Minister 
Chuan Likphai chairs a national committee specifically set up to 
oversee this development. 
  Vietnam's Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet reaffirmed Hanoi's 
commitment. 
  He expressed hope for early translation of projects into 
reality and confirmed that Vietnam supports meetings to "remove 
obstacles and bottlenecks". 
  ADB president Mitsuo Sato said sub-regional cooperation was 
"an important building block of both national and regional 
development". 
  Countries of the Greater Mekong Sub-region now need to turn 
ideas into viable projects, strengthen the institutional basis 
for cooperation and find ways of mobilising necessary resources 
for project implementation. 
  The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia 
and the Pacific [ESCAP] offered information assistance in terms 
of trade, investment and energy, and spoke of undertakings for 
the sub- region in the tourism, transport and environment 
sectors. 
  In tourism, ESCAP is undertaking, with funds from the 
Japanese government, a study of tourism development in the 
Mekong River area, and plans to hold a sub-regional seminar on 
the subject either in Kunming or Bangkok early next year. 
  In transport, ESCAP is continuing work on the Asian Highway, 
the Trans Asian Railway and the Trans Asian Land Transport 
Infrastructure. 
  In environment, ESCAP in cooperation with the ADB, is 
implementing a project on coastal and marine environment 
management in the South China Sea which includes coastal areas 
of Cambodia, China's Hainan province and Vietnam.

  [Text] President Ramos has approved the adoption of 
several measures aimed at accelerating the implementation of the 
Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines-East ASEAN 
Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA), reporters learned yesterday. 
  During the Cabinet meeting last Tuesday, the president 
directed the immediate establishment of a Philippine council to 
pursue the implementation of the BIMP-EAGA. He also ordered 
various government agencies to undertake activities for the 
operationalization of the EAGA and to identify additional 
flagship development projects in Mindanao to support the same. 
  To boost awareness and speed up implementation, Mr. Ramos 
likewise ordered the creation of additional investment and 
tourism promotion councils (ITPCs) in major cities of Mindanao 
to conduct awareness campaign on the BIMP-EAGA. 
  Currently, there are ITPCs in Davao, Zamboanga, and Cagayan 
de Oro. The additional councils will be located in Cotabato, 
Gen. Santos, Butuan, and Iligan. 
  The EAGA was formally launched last March in Davao City.

  [Text] Acting Presidential Adviser on Peace Process Manuel 
Yan called for understanding and accommodation in order to 
advance the peace talks between the government and the Moro 
National Liberation Front [MNLF]. Yan, who is also the chairman 
of the government negotiating panel with the MNLF said the peace 
talks which seek to end the conflict in southern Philippines 
should not be derailed by rumors and suspicions. Both sides are 
now preparing for the second round of formal talks to be held in 
Jakarta, Indonesia. 
  Published reports said that MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari 
resented a statement made by President Ramos, in answer to a 
question in a press conference last Monday, regarding possible 
MNLF participation in the forthcoming election. Misuari was 
also reported as planning to elevate the issue before the 
Organization of Islamic Conference or OIC. 
  Yan said in a statement that this controversy should now be 
closed and the peace process given greater momentum by the 
spirit of understanding and accommodation. Yan said the 
president's statement was never intended to preempt the ongoing 
negotiation and that he [Misuari] should not impute sinister 
designs to it. 
  With respect to Misuari's plan to raise the issue with the 
OIC, Yan said, it is not necessary. He said the president's 
statement was obviously made within the ambit of our national 
sovereignty and constitutional processes which OIC charter is 
mandated to respect. OIC is not a mediator in the peace talks he 
said, but a constructive participant and a partner for peace to 
both sides.

  [Text] The debate within the country's leftist movement 
has become so intense that even church functions like the 
celebration of the mass have been affected said the underground 
group Christians for National Liberation [CNL]. 
  Fr. Felipe Patricio, CNL national chair, told a clandestine 
press briefing Wednesday that the organization's 4,000 priests, 
pastors, seminarians, nuns, deaconesses, church workers, and 
bishops will be kept away from the debate which is "adversely 
affecting (their) revolutionary work and service to the masses." 
  The group likewise deplored pronouncements by Communist 
Party 
of the Philippines [CPP] Spokesperson Gregorio "Ka [Comrade] 
Roger" Rosal that death sentences will be meted out to four 
critics of CPP Chair Armando Liwanag. 
  Liwanag is believed to be Jose Ma. Sison, CPP founding 
chair, 
who now lives in exile in The Netherlands. 
  The CNL was founded in 1972 and is part of the CPP-led 
National Democratic Front, an umbrella organization of 13 
Marxist groups waging an armed revolution. 
  "The continuing division within the national democratic 
movement ... has escalated to the point of antagonism and 
violence even in places of sanctuary such as church premises," 
said Brother Gabriel, a ranking member of the CNL's national 
council, in a statement he read at the briefing. 
  He lamented that even during celebrations of the mass, some 
members of the underground movement no longer cared to listen to 
the homily if the priest delivering it did not conform with 
their political position. 
  Thus, he said, whatever good messages are contained in the 
homily are wasted. 
  But Patricio said that compared with other sectors, like the 
trade unions, peasants, and students, who have resorted to 
bad-mouthing each other, the members of CNL are less affected by 
the debate. 
  The rift in the CPP became official last July when its Metro 
Manila group declared autonomy from the Liwanag-led Central 
Committee. The Visayas Commission and some areas in Mindanao 
later also broke away. 
  A "third bloc" in the underground movement has been 
reported, 
but its organizers have yet to issue an official statement 
regarding its formation. 
  The CNL statement criticized the Sison faction for allegedly 
drawing the religious group into the internal party debate. 
  But Patricio said the CNL is keeping its lines to the three 
factions open and expressed the hope that Sison's group will 
stop branding its critics as "counter-revolutionaries." 
  In its statement, the CNL described as a "most disturbing 
development" the alleged meting out by "people's court" of death 
sentences to Romulo Kintanar, former chief of the New People's 
Army [NPA]; Arturo Tabara, former head of the CPP Visayas 
Commission; Ricardo Reyes, former CPP secretary general; and, 
Felimon Lagman, head of the breakaway Manila-Rizal Party 
Committee. 
  Rosal, head of the NPA's Melito Glor Command, was quoted as 
saying last week that the people's court was about to convene 
and was likely to issue a death penalty to the four men, whom 
Sison has described as "renegades" and "agents of the 
government."

<F P=106> [By Bobby Timonera] </F>
  [Text] Three days before the 21st anniversary of the 
National Democratic Front [NDF], a breakaway group announced it 
would form its own panel in the peace negotiations with the 
government. 
  The so-called Democratic Bloc of the NDF, in a clandestine 
press conference outside Metro Manila yesterday, said Communist 
Party founder Jose Ma. Sison and Luis Jalandoni "have forfeited 
their right" to represent the NDF in the peace talks because 
they have "subverted the integrity of the NDF." 
  The development was a consequence of the internal squabble 
that has split the leftist movement since last year. 
  The NDF opposition bloc also said it has disowned the 
leadership of Jalandoni, Communist Party Chair Armando Liwanag 
(believed to be the rebel name of Sison), and NDF Chair Manuel 
Romero. 
  Sol Oriente, spokesperson of the NDF-Democratic Bloc, 
however, said they are not yet entering into "the fray of the 
negotiations" between the government and the Sison-Jalandoni 
group, which she said, was about to "self-destruct" anyway. 
  The NDF opposition bloc said the ongoing peace talks were an 
"exercise in futility" because of the insincerity of both sides. 
  Oriente said her group emanated from the so-called 
"Verdaderos" which denounced last year Liwanag's alleged 
maneuvers in the NDF. She said the group will first consolidate 
its ranks before coming up with its peace panel within the year. 
  Oriente hinted that government representatives have already 
approached them. 
  Servando Populo of the NDF-Visayas said that if conditions 
warranted, they may be amenable to a local venue. 
  "It's actually a secondary issue for us," he said. 
  Populo, a priest who once worked with Jalandoni in the 
Visayas, said they may open their guerrilla zones to the 
government panel and give negotiators safe-conduct passes. 
  His group is also entertaining the possibility of a 
"rotating 
venue" wherein the government and the NDF will take turns in 
choosing the site. 
  Oriente said Sison's group has been so preoccupied with 
acquiring a status of belligerency -- like insisting on a 
foreign venue and getting a third party observer -- that it 
failed to bring the negotiations toward the discussion of 
substantive issues. 
  At the same time, Populo hit the Ramos Administration for 
its 
continued "total war policy," arrests of political dissenters, 
and lack of implementation of real social and economic reforms. 
  In a statement signed by 12 ranking rebel leaders from all 
over the country, the "NDF opposition" accused the Liwanag camp 
of rewriting the underground umbrella organization's history by 
declaring all resolutions of the NDF 1990 Congress non-existent; 
suspending all national leading bodies and structures; and, 
usurping the leadership of the NDF. 
  "Objections and protests were severely dealt with through 
arbitrary ouster and expulsion of leaders and individuals, and 
disenfranchisement of entire chapters and sections," the 
statement added. 
  The anti-Sison group is reportedly composed of national 
council and national executive committee officers, leaders, and 
mass members of the Christians for National Liberation (CNL); 
Katipunan ng mga Gurong Makabayan [Union of Nationalist 
Teachers] (Kaguma); Malayang Samahang Pangkalusugan [Independent 
Organization for Health] (MSP); Pambansang Katipunan ng 
Magbubukid [National Union of Farmers] (PKM); Rebolusyonaryong 
Konseho ng Kilusang Unyon [Revolutionary Council of Union 
Movement] (RKKU); Moro Revolutionary Organization (MRO); 
Malayang Kilusan ng Bagong Kababaihan [as published; Independent 
Movement of New Womanhood] (Makibaka); Kabataang Makabayan 
[Nationalist Youth] (KM); and the NDF-Visayas, NDF-Mindanao, 
NDF-Western Europe, and NDF-United States of America. 
  They blamed the Liwanag faction of practically cutting party 
membership into half because party cadres and members were 
either sacked or voluntarily left, disillusioned with its 
"absolutionist and undemocratic leadership." 
  "What Liwanag has today is his party faction masquerading as 
the NDF," the statement said. 
  The group also denounced the announcement by Gregorio "Ka 
[Comrade] Roger" Rosal that a "people's court" has been convened 
to mete out death penalty to four ranking CPP [Communist Party 
of the Philippines] leaders accused by Sison as "renegades." 
  They are former NPA [New People's Army] Chief Romulo 
Kintanar; former CPP Secretary General Ricardo Reyes; former CPP 
Visayas Commission Chief Arturo Tabara; and, Metro Manila CPP 
Chief Felimon Lagman. 
  Earlier, Rosal, speaking for the Communist Party of the 
Philippines and the New People' Army, admitted responsibility 
for the assassination of former NPA leader Leopoldo Mabilangan 
alias Ka Hector last Easter Sunday.

  [Text] A communist movement in the Philippines, the 
National Democratic Front [NDF] celebrated its 21st anniversary, 
Sunday, but reports saying the rift within the communist 
movement is expanding as more statements were issued by factions 
in observance of the group's anniversary. A spokesperson for 
two breakaway communist factions in Mindanao in southern 
Philippines said groups who oppose the leadership of exiled 
communist leader Jose Maria Sison have been branded by forces 
loyal to him as counter-revolutionaries. 
  Ike de los Reyes, speaking for NDF Central Mindanao and the 
Moro Revolutionary Army said, members of the breakaway groups 
now fear liquidation not only by the military but also by former 
comrades who still acknowledge Sison's leadership. Europe based 
critics of Sison also said a statement declaring they now 
represent the real NDF indicating that the rift have extended to 
the continent. Sison is himself exiled in the Utrecth, 
Netherlands.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of interview with Lieutenant General Arturo </F>
Enrile, newly appointed chief of staff of the Armed Forces of 
the Philippines [AFP], by Frank Longid Jr. under the rubric 
"Face to Face"; date and place not given; "We Need A Credible 
Military Force"] 
  [Text] You have said you will continue efforts to 
modernize the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines]. But the 
bill is still pending in Congress. 
  Well, what is important here is there is some kind of 
persistence on our part that we should have a decent Armed 
Forces in terms of equippage. And what we are really asking for 
is not really, in the true sense of the word, modernization. We 
are only pushing for what is really the basic equippage that our 
Armed Forces should have to make it a credible military force. 
  An air force, for example, cannot be called an 
honest-to-goodness air force if it does not have any jet fighter 
interceptors or if it does not have any radar. What we are 
asking for is very basic. 
  In other words when we talk about modernization we are not 
talking about high-tech, state-of-the-art equipment, we are only 
talking of the basic equipment we need in the Armed Forces to at 
least make it a decent Armed Forces. 
  Sa Navy [in the Navy], for example, how can you say that we 
have an effective Navy when we don't even have sufficient fast 
patrol craft that can intimidate fishermen from other countries 
poaching in our waters? 
  While the AFP is waiting for the modernization bill to 
be passed, what do you intend to do? 
  We just have to make the most of what we have. We have to be 
able to maintain the assets we have, although maintaining aging 
equipment is also not economical. We are maintaining for 
example ships that are older than the captains of the ship. 
It's really difficult. Pag tumatanda and [If the equipment is 
antiquated] the more you spend on maintenance until it becomes 
more economical to buy a new one already. I think we have gone 
way past that. Manila and Seoul worked out an 
arrangement last year which allowed the South Korean government 
to donate 12 boats to the Navy. Are there any other such 
projects being planned? 
  We are looking at this. Of course the Koreans, as a matter 
of fact some of their vessels have been given to us already. We 
are looking at items for the Air Force also. I'm sure we will 
not be capable of buying F-16's or things like that. But if we 
can get geared-up F5's, which will serve the purpose in the 
interim, maybe for the next 10 years. 
  What about American excess defense articles (EDAs)? 
We are looking into that possibilities but we also have to 
look into the aspect of how sufficiently we will be able to 
maintain this equipment? 
  You talk of EDAs, but there may be no accompanying spare 
parts. Baka [maybe] after a few months or a year we will be 
needing spare parts and we will not know where to get them 
because probably the company that produced these EDAs does not 
exist anymore or manufacture the parts that we need so balik na 
naman tayo sa [so we are back to] scrounging. 
  Just like Air Force items na [that are] EDA, they would like 
to give it to us. Wala namang spare parts [Whereas there are no 
spare parts]. That's a problem. We will study that very well 
in the sense that when we accept, these are items that we should 
be able to maintain and sustain. 
  What is the thrust of the AFP's modernization? 
  The thrust shall be the Navy and Air Force. 
  But critics say your Army background might get in the 
way. 
  In my first conference with the senior staff and commanders, 
in the presence of everybody, I said the first priority for 
modernization is the Air Force and Navy. Pasensya muna ang Army 
[The Army has to wait]. That's exactly what I said, even when I 
was commanding general of the Army. I had accepted that: that 
we have to play second fiddle to the Air Force and Navy. 
  Because as it is, we are proud of the Army already. Ang army 
naman, halimbawa, makadating sila diyan sa ground, mga 
adventurers na yan, [The Army, for example, can go to their 
ground on foot, they are adventurers already] we will give them 
hell. We have the best soldiers in terms of experience. Of 
course, certainly, we also would like to upgrade some of the 
Army's equipment. 
  Engineering equipment and some upgrading. For example, our 
artillery pieces. Mayroon kaming [We have] 105's howitzers that 
can shoot at a distance of 10-11 kilometers. If we can upgrade 
this same gun, we can increase its range to 18-20 kilometers 
sana [hopefully], which is now being done in other countries. 
We should be able to do that. 
  Then the army will probably need medyo bago na sasakyan na 
rin [rather new vehicles] to be used as cargo vehicles for 
transport of troops and even for use during disasters and 
calamities. 
  In other words, whatever we get will as much as possible be 
tied up with national concerns. Yung equipment na kunin namin 
[The equipment we will procure] will at the same time be made 
available in case the national government will need them for 
calamities, disasters, civic action, all of these. 
  What about the plans to streamline the AFP? 
  Oh yes, we will continue it, the streamlining. We have 
nowhere to go. We have to streamline. 
  Defense Secretary De Villa said this may entail 
reducing the AFP's strength by 35 percent over a period of 10 
years. 
  That's possible. Wala pa tayong fixed figures diyan [We 
don't have fixed figures yet], but one thing is definite: we 
will reduce in strength, especially the Army. 
  Is AFP that confident its counterinsurgency efforts 
will succeed? 
  Well not exactly that confident but I think the trends are 
there, mukhang [looks like it is] irreversible. I'm not saying 
100 percent... mukhang [just seemingly] irreversible. 
  The streamlining will affect thousands of soldiers. 
How will the AFP prepare them for civilian life? 
  Yes, that's the thing that is really worrying us at the 
moment. But we are lining up plans to make sure that once a 
soldier is attrited he must have enough preparation to meet 
other challenges other than being a soldier. But streamlining 
will not happen immediately. Right now we will use the normal 
attrition process. 
  It will be the Army which will have the most strength 
reduction because when you talk of personnel strength, I think 
the Navy and Air Force will not be touched so much. It will be 
the Army that will be very much affected by the reduction in 
warm-body strength. 
  Now we have, for example, on the average the Army attrites 
about 200 men per month. This is in the form of retirement, 
separation and death, etc. So you're talking of about 2,400 per 
year. 
  Of course hindi naman puwede na [it is not possible that] 
you 
will stop recruiting. So maybe for every 2,000 that are 
separated through normal attrition, probably we can bring in 
300, 400 something like that. So in a span of just five years, 
we are able to attrite 10,000. 
  What about the Civilian Armed Forces Units (Cafgus)? 
How do you view the proposal to disband them? 
  We have no objection. But it should be done in a manner na 
hindi naman biglaan [that is not be abrupt]. Hindi naman 
puwedeng sabihin na bukas i-disband na natin ang Cafgus [We 
can't say that tomorrow we will disband]. We have to phase it 
in such a way that it will be in line or proportionate to the 
improvement in the insurgency situation. Ibig sabihin [What I'm 
saying is that], we are still pursuing our operational 
activities... so we will need the Cafgus in many areas. 
  Will the Cafgus be disbanded by the year 2000? 
  Oh yes, probably even before that. 
  How much money will the AFP save when it 
streamlines? 
  No, we are not talking about savings because as you 
streamline it probably will be more expensive because you will 
be spending more on equipment to make up for the loss in 
personnel. 
  Sabihin mo magbawas ka ng [Say, you reduce] 10,000 troops, 
that does not mean It will be a big savings. To make up for 
that ano kailangan mo [what would you need]? You need equipment. 
  The AFP will be more efficient because we should be able to 
use less people, but of course the effect of that also is we 
will also be contributing to unemployment if we are not able to 
prepare for civilian life those who will be taken out of the 
service. 
  What about the planned reorganization of the AFP, 
including tbe Kasama na yan [That is included]. 
It's an overall streamlining process. In other words lahat 
yan [all of that] will be taken into consideration. 
  Do you accept the view that along with external 
defense, AFP should Okay lang [That's okay]. 
The engineers, definitely can help. Even armored cars. If 
there comes a time na kailangan [that we need] a lot of muscle 
insofar as illegal logging operations are concerned we can use 
the armored cars to patrol the forests. That will be tied up 
with environmental protection. Even the Navy. You are talking 
about protection of our seas, yung mga corals natin [the corals] 
that are being raped. If you have sufficient fast patrol craft 
na nakikita nilang nagpapatrol diyan, yung ating mga [that they 
see patrolling in the area, the] illegal poachers will think 
twice. The AFP is also helping in the improvement of the 
economy. Actually, indirectly, the AFP is helping the economy. 
Even without talking of engineering, even without talking of 
direct involvement, indirect involvement of the AFP na lang 
[just that], it is helping improve the economy. 
Why is the economy improving? Huwag mo sabihin sa akin 
hindi kasali ang AFP diyan [Don't tell me the AFP is not 
involved in it]. How will you handle our relations with other 
Asean countries? Yung [The] military exercises with Singapore, 
tuloy pa ba yon [will it push through]? 
  Yes. 
  What about Indonesia? 
  Well, we are now in the process of working this out. This 
should be a natural, shall we say, arrangement in terms of 
exercises, bilateral muna [first]. Then maybe multilateral 
later. 
  Also you have heard the president talking about, even in the 
Spratlys, yung mga commanders doon e, mag-usap-usap [the 
commanders there should be speaking to each other]. For example 
if I'm a commander of the area that we claim, I go there, let's 
say sa [to the] Vietnamese commander of the area that we claim, 
I go there, let's say sa Vietnamese commander, ano [right], "o 
[hey], I'll be going there, mag-picnic tayo diyan [let's picnic 
there], or something like that. This is more of friendly 
gestures ba [isn't it]. That the area is not really, should not 
really be an area of conflict but it should be an area to 
promote understanding and cooperation for the interest of the 
nations with conflicting claims. 
  How do you propose to further improve military ties 
with other Asean countries? 
  It has improved a lot. Unang una [First of all], maybe about 
three years ago, it was not the same. Right now, ako lang [just 
me], personally, my counterparts in the army of these other 
nations, are all now chiefs of staff also, one is even minister 
of defense. I have met them, we have established very good 
cooperative and friendly relations with them, they have visited 
us here, I have visited them. 
  Alam mo [You know], military to military, wala kang problema 
[you don't have any problem]. Kasi ang culture ng military all 
over the world isa lang [Because military culture all over the 
world is one]. Very easy to establish friendships. Kasi walang 
[Because there are no] political undertones, or political 
implications. 
  Back to the insurgency, has strategic victory been 
achieved? What do you think? Alam mo it's very difficult for 
us to say this. Ikaw [You] what do you think? Have you seen 
any insurgent activities? Totoo ba yung nasa NSC (National 
Security Council) briefing na 2.6 percent barangay na lang ang 
hawak nila [Is it true that in the NSC briefing, the insurgents 
exert influence only in 2.6 percent of the country's 
villages]? 
  Oo [Yes]. You interpret it already. Kasi kami pagsinabi 
namin yan kayo na ang mag-ano niyan [Because if we say so, it is 
up to you to consider]. Baka mas magaling pa kayo mag-interpret 
ng data [You must be better in terms of interpreting data]. 
  Matutuloy ang [Are you pushing through the] turnover of 
counterinsurgency duties to the Philippine National Police 
(PNP)by the end of this year? 
  Unless there are amendments to the law. 
  The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [RAM -- 
Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance] claims its people are being 
deliberately targeted for attrition from the AFP. 
  That's not true. I wouldn't say that because they were under 
my custody when I was Army commander. 
  They seem to have greeted your appointment with 
relative enthusiasm. . 
  I'm glad, I'm complimented by that. 
  Does this mean you will participate in the peace 
process more actively, even only in confidence building 
efforts? 
  I have been doing that, even before. 
  How? 
  I have been showing a lot of sincerity, even at the time 
when 
many of them were detained, they were not treated like 
prisoners, and I helped them. From family problems to bigger 
problems, open tayo diyan [I'm amenable to that]. This was a 
period when most of them realized this is part of the game, 
nadedetain sila, pero hindi dahil na-detain sila pababayaan 
natin [they are detained, but because they are detained, doesn't 
mean that they should be ignored]. So when they had problems, 
we took care of them, that's part of confidence building. But 
of course this is not for me to become popular with these 
people. I will help them for as long it will not go beyond 
policies, regulations. 
  Will AFP continue its support to PNP [Philippine 
National Police] in its anti-criminality drive? 
  We are providing full support. As chief of staff now, I am 
committing the resources of the AFP on whatever the PACC 
[Presidential Anti-Crime Commission] will need without 
necessarily being seen as being the major (player). Ano lang 
tayo [We are just their], support. Our role is we should be 
able to help all the agencies of government that need our help. 
  Is the AFP's rapid deployment force, about one 
battalion of crack troops, still under the AFP's Task Force 
Hammerhead which is mandated to assist law enforcement 
agencies? 
  Oo. Nag-usap nga kami ni vice president diyan, sabi ko [Yes. 
The vice president and I have discussed this. I told him], if 
Gen. Lisandro Abadia supported you so much, I will support you 
with more. 
  The AFP seems to be adopting a "low profile 
policy." 
  Good. That's the way it should be. Alam mo the less the AFP 
is talked about, the better. So the less you get news from us 
the better. The less I appear on TV, the less I am read about, 
di-ba [right?], it is better. 
  What do you anticipate will offer you the greatest 
difficulty as chief of staff? 
  I do not know yet. I hope I do not have the greatest 
difficulty. 
  Back to modernization, do you really feel a substantial 
upgrade in equippage is possible, given all the limitations? 
  Modernization will be one of my "flagship projects." By the 
end of my term, I hope I will not be frustrated. Ang importante 
diyan [What is important] is we are following a certain line, if 
somehow we can improve the Armed Forces in terms of equippage, I 
will be very happy. If we are able to improve some more the 
attitudes of our people, better. 
  Because when you talk of modernization, you are not only 
talking of equippage. You are talking of training, and the goal 
of having every person in the armed forces, ang kanyang [his] 
preoccupation is to strive for excellence. To be able to show 
to the civilian community that we are not different. Though we 
are soldiers, we are part of the country, part of the community.

  [Text] Seoul, April 25 (YONHAP) -- The chairman of the main 
opposition Democratic Party (DP), upon returning from a visit to 
the United States, claimed Monday that he had achieved a great 
deal in his talks with American Government leaders. 
  DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek also expressed sympathy and 
understanding for the government for having to deal with U.S. 
foreign policy which, he said, puts its own national interests 
ahead of all other considerations. 
  Yi evaluated the results of his visit to Washington after 
returning home Monday, cutting short his U.S. itinerary because 
of the abrupt resignation last Friday of Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang. 
  "Through my talks with American personalities, both in and 
out of the government, on the North Korean nuclear row and the 
Uruguay Round, I am convinced that our party could carry through 
its positions on these issues," Yi said. 
  The DP opposes sanctions against North Korea and rejects the 
Uruguay Round trade agreement. The party has vowed to block 
ratification of the UR accord at the National Assembly. 
  "At the same time, I could feel acutely how difficult it 
would be to conduct diplomacy against (U.S.) foreign policy that 
erects a high barrier that is called the national interest," he 
said. 
  "I realized what kind of steel wall our government officials 
have to face (in diplomatic negotiations) in defense of our own 
national interest," he added. 
  The DP chairman defined Yi Hoe-chang's resignation as "a 
national crisis," and said that the country should form either 
"a pan- national crisis management council" or "a national 
coalition cabinet." 
  He said his party, however, has no intention of taking 
advantage of the current crisis for political purposes. The 
opposition party is prepared to work together with the ruling 
party to overcome the present difficulties, he said.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Yi Ki-tong from Moscow] </F>
  [Text] North Korean authorities have started full-scale 
activities in Moscow to prevent North Korean loggers, who 
escaped from logging camps in Siberia, to defect to the ROK. On 
the afternoon of 18 April, North Korean authorities dispatched 
two agents, who seemed to be secret service men, near the 
Foreign Ministry resident's registration office for foreigners 
in Moscow. It seems that they are preventing North Korean 
escapees from approaching this area. 
  These North Korean agents, clad in civilian clothes, were 
hanging around (Pocropka) Street, where the resident's 
registration office for foreigners is located, in twos and 
threes. They hastily disappeared when our reporter approached 
them. It was confirmed that they were also sitting around the 
North Korean Government-run restaurant--Pyongyang 
Restaurant--located near the resident's registration office for 
foreigners. It was learned that they took turns watching over 
this whole area during office hours. 
  This was revealed when a certain Mr. Kim, a logger who 
escaped from a logging camp, reported to the ROK Embassy in 
Russia that the agents prevented him from approaching the 
resident's registration office for foreigners so he could 
officially apply for a resident permit with the Russian 
authorities on 18 April. 
  It was learned that the Russian authorities are planning to 
grant residency to the North Korean escapees who apply for a 
resident permit through the resident's registration office for 
foreigners. Once they have this permit, the North Korean 
escapees will be able to enter the ROK after being issued a 
traveler's certificate. An ROK Embassy official in Russia 
revealed on 19 April: "If the North Korean authorities continue 
to interfere with this matter, it will be in reality difficult 
for the North Korean escapees to apply for a resident's permit." 
He also revealed that another emergency measure should be taken 
for the benefit of the North Korean escapees as soon as possible.

  [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- The United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has notified the South Korean 
Government of its willingness to cooperate in Seoul's bid to 
resettle fleeing North Korean loggers, a senior Foreign Ministry 
official said Tuesday. 
  In reply to a government request, the UNHCR praised Seoul's 
decision to allow the loggers to resettle in South Korea and 
expressed its readiness to cooperate, the official said. 
  He said the ministry asked the UNHCR headquarters in Geneva 
last Friday to confirm the identity of loggers who escaped from 
North Korean camps in Siberia and give them refugee status. 
  The UNHCR will instruct its Moscow office to cooperate in 
offering refugee status to the escapees late this week when it 
finishes a study on how to protect, temporarily accommodate, and 
look into the backgrounds of, the escapees and what to do with 
the loggers after giving them refugee status. 
  The government told the UNHCR about human rights conditions 
at the North Korean logging camps in Siberia and about escapees 
from the camps, and asked for cooperation in resettling the 
loggers in South Korea. 
  The government plans to allow those who have been clearly 
identified to come here directly after consultations with the 
Russian Government, while those requiring further identification 
procedures must be screened by the UNHCR to determine their 
refugee status. 
  Hundreds of North Korean loggers have escaped from Siberian 
logging yards, testifying later to rampant human rights 
violations inside the camps.

  [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- Spurred by fears of war 
and anxiety over the possible collapse of the Kim Il-song 
regime, senior North Korean party, government and military 
officials are hoarding U.S. dollars, gold, jewelry and other 
valuables. 
  A persistent distrust of the local currency, the won, is 
also 
driving the North Korean elite to convert their money into 
capitalist currency or other valuables, according to information 
filtering through to the South. 
  Pyongyang's leaders have been hyping a war mentality among 
their countrymen by boasting, "We will accomplish unification 
through the barrel of a gun." 
  Of late, they have been instilling fear in ordinary citizens 
by claiming that South Korea and the United States are about to 
invade the North because of the deadlocked nuclear row. 
  The Stalinist state's leaders have contributed further to 
the 
atmosphere of anxiety by ordering power blackouts and air raid 
exercises. 
  As a result, many North Koreans now believe that war will 
eventually break out on the peninsula. 
  One member of the pro-Pyongyang Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chochongnyon) who claims to know the 
commander of the Fourth North Korean Army Corps, identified only 
as Gen. Chang, said many North Koreans were buying U.S. dollars 
and Japanese yen from ethnic Koreans in China who trade goods 
across the border at prices that are considerably higher than 
the official rates. 
  Others are secretly amassing stores of alluvial gold, he 
said. 
  In particular, military generals like Chang are holding 
hundreds of thousands of dollars and gold ingots as large as 15 
centimeters long, 5 centimeters wide and 4 centimeters thick. 
Some are also hoarding pearl and gold necklaces, gold bracelets 
and earrings. 
  The Chochongnyon official said one of his relatives, 
identified only as An, a senior member of the Central Workers 
(Communist) Party in charge of agriculture, is hiding an 
unspecified amount of yen and jewelry. 
  NAEWOE Press, South Korea's official watcher of North Korean 
affairs, said another reason North Koreans are hoarding foreign 
currency and valuables was because of a possible, abrupt 
exchange of old bills with new ones like the swap carried out on 
July 15, 1992. 
  At that time, the Pyongyang government conducted a 
one-to-one 
exchange of old and new cash but limited the amount citizens 
could change, forcing them to deposit the excess at the central 
bank and other financial institution. They could withdraw the 
deposited money under different regulations later on, NAEWOE 
said. 
  The government allowed individual households to exchange up 
to 399 won while depositing 30,000 won and no more. 
  Because of this irrational and forceful measure, many angry 
citizens burned excess money they had saved or simply tossed the 
bills into the river.

  [Text] North Korea and Russia have agreed to revise the 
"North Korea-Russia Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual 
Assistance Treaty," involving the abrogation of a provision on 
automatic military intervention, to meet a change in the 
situation at home and abroad. However, due to North Korea's 
refusal, it has been dragged on over a year even without having 
consultations. 
  According to a diplomatic source on 24 April, then Russian 
Vice Foreign Minister Georgiy Kudnadze, current ambassador to 
the ROK, visited Pyongyang in February, 1993. In the talks with 
North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, Kudnadze brought 
forth the issue regarding the revision and agreed with the North 
side to fully revise the treaty in conformity with the current 
situation. Nonetheless, North Korea has so far showed no 
reaction. 
  In particular, upon Russia's proposal, Russia and North 
Korea 
reached an agreement to abrogate or re-interpret the so-called 
provision on automatic military intervention which stipulates 
that a country should automatically render military assistance 
to the other country that is invaded since the provision is a 
relic of the Cold- War era. However, North Korea has declined 
to take up the issue. 
  As regards to this, a government official predicted: 
"Chances 
are very slim that the discussions will soon be made on the 
issue."

  [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Japan 
will agree to exchange goodwill Naval fleet visits and military 
flight schedules over the open seas. 
  The agreement is being sealed by Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae, who left for Tokyo Tuesday morning as the first South 
Korean defense minister to visit Japan, when he meets his 
Japanese counterpart for one and a half hours later in the 
afternoon, a Defense Ministry official said. 
  Under the pact, South Korean Naval vessels will call at a 
Japanese port in the fall and a Japanese fleet will make a 
return call sometime thereafter. 
  Yi and his Japanese counterpart will also discuss regional 
security in Northeast Asia, including the international row over 
North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program, and ways to 
increase bilateral military exchanges, the official added. 
  During his stay in Tokyo, Yi will pay a courtesy call on new 
Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and his foreign minister. 
  He will fly to Moscow on Thursday -- also becoming the first 
South Korean defense minister to visit Russia -- and remain 
there until next Tuesday. He is scheduled to meet with Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to discuss increasing personnel 
and other military exchanges and sign the Korea-Russia 1994-95 
memorandum of understanding on military exchanges. 
  From Russia he will proceed to Germany to meet with his 
German counterpart on expansion of the Korea-Germany military 
technology exchange program and to visit major military 
installations. 
  Yi will return home on Thursday next week, winding up his 
11-day tour of the three countries.

saying Sunday. All militia and paramilitary groups were also 
ordered to go on high alert, according to Naewoe Press, Seoul's 
North Korea watcher which monitors the KCNA. Among them are the 
People's Constabulary, the worker-peasant Red Guards and the Red 
Young Guards. Kim Kwang-chin, vice marshal and vice minister of 
the People's Armed Forces, said, "The danger of war escalates 
from hour to hour on the Korean Peninsula because of the 
reckless military threats and war conspiracy by imperialist 
America and South Korea. We cannot remain idle at a time when 
we are in danger of falling into a nuclear war." "We do not 
want war put will not beg for peace at the expense of our 
dignity," the vice marshal asserted.

  [Text] Seoul, April 21 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
met with Canadian Governor-general Ramon J. Hnatyshyn Thursday 
to discuss promoting bilateral relations. 
  Kim and Hnatyshyn shared the view that their nations can 
cooperate closely in various fields and agreed to forge a 
"special partnership." 
  Hnatyshyn conveyed his government's decision to waive visa 
requirements for Koreans entering Canada for no more than six 
months, and Kim expected that the move will boost bilateral 
exchanges. 
  Kim explained that Seoul is studying ways to resolve the 
North Korean nuclear problem peacefully while acknowledging 
Canada's support for his government's position. 
  Hnatyshyn noted that Ottawa will continue to back Seoul's 
stance. 
  They agreed that the domestic reforms in the two nations 
pushed by their new governments will ultimately contribute to 
the development and deepening of bilateral relations. 
  Canada, with its abundant natural resources and advanced 
technology, and South Korea, which possesses human resources and 
expertise in manufacturing, have complementary economic 
structures and should thus develop practical links. 
  Hnatyshyn, the first Canadian governor-general to visit, 
arrived in Seoul earlier in the day at the invitation of 
President Kim and is scheduled to stay here until Monday. 
  Kim hosted dinner for Hnatyshyn Thursday evening.

  [Text] Seoul, April 21 (YONHAP) -- The Board of Audit and 
Inspection's [BAI] six-day examination of Chongwadade 
[presidential office] starting Friday is being watched keenly 
since it is the first audit of the Kim government's presidential 
office. 
  Although the BAI is scheduled to check only the general 
accounts of the Secretariat and the office of security service, 
the general public is interested in how much President Kim 
Yong-sam's Chongwadae has spent over the past year. 
  Presidential aides, reportedly paying close attention to 
their preparations, are well aware that Kim's Chongwadae will 
invariably be compared with that of former President No Tae-u, 
whose overspending was pointed out by the board. 
  As soon as the BAI decided to audit Chongwadae, officials 
checked their own records on spending, contract papers and 
materials purchased, then classified them for the inspectors, 
sources said. 
  "Led by President Kim himself, we have tightened our belts 
and maintained an austere office here," one of the aides said. 
"There would be almost nothing that could be cited as wasteful." 
  "Actually, we have been worried that the BAI would skip its 
audit of Chongwadae," said another confident presidential aide. 
  "This will be an opportunity for us to demonstrate that the 
Kim Chongwadae is different from all previous Chongwadaes," he 
added. 
  In contrast to a Chongwadae brimming with confidence, BAI 
officials appear to be diffident over their upcoming task. 
Basically, there will be nothing they can fault Chongwadae for 
if the presidential office is as clean and austere as officials 
claim. 
  "What would the general public think then, if we come up 
with 
nothing to show?" said one BAI official. 
  In other words, they are worried that some might accuse them 
of having "overlooked problems." 
  The BAI was said to have favored skipping Chongwadae this 
year since it was audited last year, but finally decided to go 
ahead for fear of criticism that the independent auditing agency 
recognizes "some sanctuaries," according to BAI insiders. 
  The 10 BAI officials assigned the job of inspecting 
Chongwadae are already sifting through documents from the 
presidential office while still inspecting the Culture and 
Sports Ministry. 
  This shows their determination to dig out something at 
Chongwadae, said one observer. 
  Last year, the BAI revealed no less than 25 instances of 
unjustifiable expenditure, adding up to 645 million won in 
overspending in 1991-92 by No Tae-u's Chongwadae. Most of the 
money was spent on luncheons, dinners and presents.

  [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- Yi Ki-taek, chairman of 
the main opposition Democratic Party [DP], suffered an 
ignominious loss of face when the DP's Supreme Council brushed 
aside his public suggestion that a pan-national cabinet be 
formed to handle the "national crisis." 
  The chain of events took place as follows. 
  Yi, hurrying home from a visit to the United States on 
Monday, gravely suggested that a national council be formed to 
cope with the current crisis arising from the resignation of 
Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang. 
  The suggestion, of course, was meant for President Kim 
Yong-sam, who ignored it completely. 
  Yi then followed up by saying that a cabinet supported by 
the 
entire nation could be formed. 
  In less than a few hours, however, the remarks by the leader 
of the country's No. 1 opposition party were brushed aside by 
his own party's supreme council. 
  "The suggestion was worth studying," DP Spokesman Pak 
Chi-won 
told reporters, "but it was not appropriate timing-wise. 
  "At this juncture, therefore, we have decided not to discuss 
the proposal any further." 
  When Pak's remarks are analyzed carefully, it is possible to 
get the drift of what exactly is going on within the party. 
  What Pak said indicates that most, if not all, members of 
the 
supreme council might have shared this opinion with their leader 
when he suggested setting up a pan-national cabinet. 
  In fact, this was not the first time Chairman Yi had 
suggested formation of a broad-based cabinet. He made similar 
proposals twice before -- at his new year's day press conference 
and at another press conference marking the first anniversary of 
his chairmanship. 
  In making such suggestions, Yi Ki-taek's point was that 
President Kim has lost his ability to govern the nation after 
trying to impose "a new authoritarianism" and "one-man rule." 
  In order to overcome the national crisis resulting from 
President Kim's inability to rule, Yi reasoned, a pan-national 
cabinet, drawing capable manpower from all sectors including the 
political opposition, should be formed. 
  The supreme council agreed with Yi's diagnosis of the 
current 
political situation, but said the timing was inappropriate. 
  According to the council's thinking, the DP ought to keep 
pressing its offensive against the ruling party and the Kim 
administration by demanding investigations of the Sangmudae 
scandal and the resignation of Yi Hoe-chang. 
  Now is not the time, in other words, for the opposition 
party 
to come forward and offer help to President Kim by saying "let's 
form a coalition force to overcome the 'crisis,' or whatever it 
may be." 
  Proposing to form a pan-national cabinet is "a card" 
overused 
by past opposition parties. Many supreme council members 
believe that Yi Ki-taek has obviously misjudged the current 
situation. 
  The supreme council, in effect, ignored its own chairman's 
suggestion. In order to help Yi save face, however, it had 
Spokesman Pak officially announce that "it would not be 
discussed any further."

  [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- The ruling and 
opposition parties have agreed to extend the eight-day special 
session of the National Assembly by three days to deal with 
approval of the prime minister-designate and the parliamentary 
probe into the Sangmudae military scandal. 
  Floor leaders of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) 
and the opposition Democratic Party (DP) agreed to extend the 
167th special session during an eleventh-hour meeting arranged 
by speaker Yi Man-sop late Monday night. 
  The two floor leaders also decided that the extended session 
will handle an opposition proposal calling on the cabinet to 
step down en masse. 
  The ruling and opposition parties will convene the National 
Assembly legislation and judiciary committee to discuss 
investigation of the Sangmudae scam, in which the opposition 
alleges that funds for the construction of Sangmudae -- military 
facilities in the Southwestern provincial capital of Kwangju -- 
were illegally funneled to the ruling party. 
  The prolonged session will concurrently deal with detailed 
plans for the Sangmudae probe and approval of the prime 
minister- designate, said speaker Yi after the meeting of floor 
leaders. 
  The speaker also said that the motion calling for the 
cabinet's resignation would be handled after the prime 
minister-designate issue was settled. 
  Speaking to reporters on the last-minute agreement to extend 
the special session, DP spokesman Pak Chi-won said, "the ruling 
and opposition parties agreed, during the session, that they 
will concurrently deal with the three motions on Sangmudae, 
approval of the prime minister-designate and the resignation of 
the entire cabinet." 
  The special session is unlikely to go smoothly, however, due 
to the designation of Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister for 
unification affairs, as new prime minister. The parties also 
failed to agree on witnesses for the Sangmudae case and the 
tracking of checks to unearth the whereabouts of funds used in 
Sangmudae construction, experts say. The parties were able to 
agree that the Sangmudae case should be handled before the other 
motions.

  [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- Pohang Iron and Steel 
Co. (Posco) flatly denied rumors Tuesday that its Chairman Kim 
Man-che would meet Pak Tae-chun, former chief of the mammoth 
steelmaker, in Japan during Kim's current four-day visit. 
  The former deputy prime minister and finance minister, who 
was sworn in March 8, has wound up a company reshuffle and 
embarked on his first trip abroad to become familiarized with 
Japanese steelmakers and to discuss technological cooperation. 
  Kim chose Japan as his first overseas destination because it 
is not only the world's biggest steelmaker but also because it 
is Posco's major technology teacher, a company official said, 
adding that Kim had no reason to meet Pak. 
  Rumors of a Kim-Pak rendezvous have circulated since former 
Chairman Chong Myong-sik and other executives refrained from 
traveling to Japan lest the public misunderstand the purpose of 
their trip. 
  Pak, who has been in Japan since resigning the chairman's 
post, had expressed his wish to come back home through various 
channels. 
  But Posco, reacting sensitively to the rumors because of 
Pak's connection to politics, emphasized that Kim was strictly 
on business in Japan, discussing technological cooperation, the 
position of Japan's steel industry and Mitsubish Motor Co.'s 
plan to import Posco cold-rolled sheets. 
  Company officials added that Kim had no reason to meet Pak, 
with whom he has no personal relations.

  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP April 25 -- Prince Norodom Sirivut, 
vice-prime minister and minister for foreign affairs and 
international cooperation, has recently received here Mr. Jean 
Michel Monod, president of International Committee of Red Cross 
(ICRC), in charge of Asia-Pacific affairs. 
  During talks, Jean Michel asked Prince Sirivut for access 
for 
the ICRC to all border-posts, thus facilitating the latter in 
distributing humanitarian aid. 
  The ICRC president also asked for a permission to meet the 
ex-Khmer Rouge soldiers who deserted to or were captured by 
Cambodian Royal Armed Forces. 
  He wished a Cambodian representative to attend the meeting 
on 
mines problem to be held in Geneva in the future. 
  For his part, Prince Norodom Sirivut thanked ICRC for having 
helped Cambodians victimised from mines and accidents. 
  With regard to the ICRC's proposal, the prince outlined that 
the Royal Government was thinking about the possibility for 
giving access to the border-posts, including Poipet, but the 
access would not be authorized internationally as that of 
Pochentong Airport.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata called Friday [22 April] for a resolution of Japan's trade 
dispute with the United States by July, when the Group of Seven 
(G-7) industrialized nations is set to hold a summit in Naples. 
  Hata, who is certain to become the next prime minister, told 
a press conference he believes Japan and the U.S. could solve 
the trade row because he and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor were able to understand "what the problems are" when they 
met last week in Marrakech, Morocco. 
  Japan will hammer out the second package of market-opening 
measures by June and the U.S. also has been making efforts to 
create products meeting Japanese demands, he said. 
  Hata said Japan must spontaneously take steps to open its 
markets because this will not only reduce its huge surplus with 
the U.S. but will also contribute to the improvement of people's 
lives and inject dynamism into the domestic economy. 
  Tokyo and Washington have been unable to resume the trade 
"framework" that broke down in February over failure to iron out 
differences on the "objective criteria" for foreign access to 
Japanese markets.

  [Text] Washington, April 22 KYODO -- A group of Japanese 
steel exporters appealed to the United States on Friday to 
reject a bill designed to implement the Uruguay Round trade 
agreement, which the Japanese claim would take the teeth out of 
the global free trade pact. 
  Representatives of the Japan Iron and Steel Exporters 
Association made the appeal when they visited the Commerce 
Department and the U.S. Trade Representative Office. 
  The bill, called the GATT Fair Trade Enforcement Act of 
1994, 
was introduced earlier this month by Rep. Ralph Regula, a 
Republican from Ohio, and Rep. Norman Mineta, a Democrat from 
California. 
  The association officials said the bill includes a broad 
series of protectionist amendments, among them measures which 
would make it easier for the U.S. Government to impose 
antidumping duties on steel imports. 
  These measures include a provision that would make it 
possible to maintain antidumping duties unless exporters prove 
there will be no possibility of dumping in the future. 
  Noting that it is impossible for an individual company to 
demonstrate what future prices will be, the officials said the 
provision is apparently intended to slap antidumping duties 
beyond the five-year period allowed under the Uruguay Round 
trade pact. 
  The Regula-Mineta legislation also includes a provision that 
would allocate funds collected from antidumping duties to U.S. 
companies which file related antidumping petitions to help them 
finance pensions, and research and development. 
  The possibility of the bill passing Congress without any 
amendment is slim, but Japanese steel exporters fear that some 
measures in the bill might be incorporated in legislation to be 
drafted by the Clinton administration in late May in order to 
implement the Uruguay Round trade agreement.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Perry warned Friday that North Korea will soon be able 
to produce "10 to 12" nuclear bombs a year. 
  "Left unchecked (North Korean) nuclear capability would 
disrupt the security of all Asia," he said in a speech at the 
Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan in Tokyo. 
  Perry said in Seoul on Thursday that intelligence reports 
indicate North Korea will have the plutonium required for "four 
to five" nuclear weapons very soon, but his speech Friday is 
apparently the first time he has indicated a north korean 
nuclear arsenal could grow so quickly. 
  Before his press club appearance, Perry met with Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, and Foreign Ministry officials said the 
two renewed their determination to get tough on the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  Hata and perry also emphasized the need for a diplomatic 
solution to the nuclear standoff, the officials said, adding the 
two also confirmed that Tokyo and Washington will continue to 
maintain close contact with South Korea.

  [Text] Jakarta, April 25 (ANTARA) -- Vietnamese President 
Le Duc Anh is scheduled to discuss Vietnam's intention to join 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with 
Indonesian leaders during his visit here due to start on Tuesday. 
  "During his visit to Indonesia from April 26 to 29, 
President 
Anh will advance Vietnam's bid to join ASEAN," Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas said at a closing ceremony of the 
16th Foreign Office's staff and leadership course here Monday. 
  Alatas said Vietnam has so far actively involved in ASEAN 
regional forum and various activities of the non-communist 
group. Besides Vietnam, Laos has also actively involved in 
ASEAN's programs, he added. 
  "Indonesia has considered Vietnam and Laos as the two 
neighbouring countries which have close relations with ASEAN 
member countries. I think it's just a matter of time to receive 
the two countries as fully ASEAN member as all ASEAN member 
countries must first discuss the Vietnam's keeness to join the 
association," Alatas said. 
  According to Alatas, Indonesia and the other ASEAN member 
countries have no politicel objection to Vietnam's bid. 
  "Vietmam, however, should adjust its economic policy to 
economic system adapted by ASEAN member countries," He added. 
  ASEAN groups Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam, the 
Philippines, Thailand and Singapore. 
  During his four-day visit to the country, President Anh, a 
73- year-old former military commander, and his entourage are 
slated to be given Indonesian explanation about the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. 
  During President Anh's visit, he will be accompanied by his 
wife, three Vietnamese ministers as well as senior officials. 
It will be the first visit by President Anh who will arrive 
here to meet President Suharto's invitation. President Suharto 
visited Hanoi in 1990. 
  During his visit, President Anh is scheduled to have a 
discussion with President Suharto while Vietnamese ministers 
will hold other meetings with their Indonesian counterparts to 
discuss possible cooperation in various sectors. 
  Alatas said, two key issues to be discussed in Anh's talks 
here will be Indonesia's wish to speed up repatriation of about 
ten thousand Vietnamese boat people from its Galang Island 
refugee camp near Singapore and a boundary dispute in the South 
China Sea.

Indonesia president in many decades, and Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet's visit to Indonesia in November 1991, President Le Duc 
Anh's visit to Indonesia this time will open a new page in the

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- The spokesman of the 
South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) in a 
statement on April 21 said the South Korean trip of the U.S. 
Defense Secretary, William Perry, was a tour of frontline 
commanding to inspect and examine on the spot and carry into 
practice the war plan against the North which had been prepared 
for operation and a tour of operational confab for forming 
combined forces suited to a wartime system, the Seoul-based 
Radio Voice of National Salvation said. 
  This reminds us of the Seoul trip of John Foster Dulles who 
ignited the June 25 war after repeated confabs in June 1950, 44 
years ago, the statement said, and noted: 
  The South Korean visit of Perry was also a trip of arms 
dealings for U.S. munitions monopolies intended to increase 
tensions over the "nuclear issue" of the North and reap a 
windfall by death dealings, making the Korean peninsula a 
theatre of war. 
  Washington and "Chongwadae" [ROK presidential office] must 
stop at once the war provocation manoeuvres and shipment of arms 
to impose a nuclear disaster upon our people and nation. 
  The Patriot missile is not for defense but for the 
provocation of a war, and the "Team Spirit" is not a defensive 
exercise but a nuclear war exercise. 
  The United States must withdraw from this land, taking along 
all the war equipment including the Patriot and aggression 
forces, and promptly cancel the resumption of the "Team Spirit" 
manoeuvres. 
  If the U.S. bellicose elements and "civilian"-veiled 
warmaniacs continue along the road of war, they will be dealt a 
stern hammer blow by history.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- Political parties and 
organisations of various countries denounced moves of the U.S. 
imperialists against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  The Central Committee of the African Party of Independence 
of 
Senegal in a statement April 7 said the United States totally 
reversed the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-USA contact 
in New York and was going to resume the "Team Spirit" joint 
military exercises and deployed "Patriot" missiles in South 
Korea. 
  A statement published by the participants in the 
international chuche idea seminar on independence, peace and 
friendship on April 10 denounced the U.S. imperialists for 
massing their huge Armed Forces in South Korea and around the 
Korean peninsula, vociferating about the resumption of the "Team 
Spirit" joint military exercises, and branded it as a brazen 
violation of the sovereignty and dignity of the Korean people 
and as an act of provocation to stifle the socialism of Korea. 
  It urged the United States to cancel the plan to resume the 
"Team Spirit" joint military exercises that poses a big threat 
to peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the Far 
East. "If the U.S. imperialists and the reactionaries take the 
road of unleashing another war on the Korean peninsula, we, 
together with the followers of the chuche idea all over the 
world, will fight on the same trench with the Korean people with 
arms in hand," the statement stressed. 
  The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a statement on 
April 6 said that the United States must immediately stop its 
moves to stifle the system of socialist Korea and renounce its 
policy hostile to it, and the United Nations Security Council 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency must not follow the 
United States any longer, discarding the double standard and 
partiality. 
  The Denmark-Democratic People's Republic of Korea Friendship 
Association in a statement said the U.S. clamor about "nuclear 
threat from North Korea" is completely groundless. The nuclear 
issue of the Korean peninsula can be resolved only when all the 
nuclear weapons of the United States are removed from South 
Korea and such aggressive war exercises as "Team Spirit" stopped 
and all the U.S. forces withdrawn from there, the statement 
stressed.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 21 [dateline as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- 
The Central Standing Committee of the General Association of 
Korean residents in Japan (Chongnyon) strongly demanded that the 
Japanese Govermnent authorities immediately stop the hostile 
policy toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea which 
they are pursuing in conspiracy with the United States and the 
South Korean authorities. 
  Paek Han-ki, vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee 
of Chongnyon, released a statement of the Chongnyon Central 
Standing Committee at a press conference in Tokyo on April 21. 
  On April 19, gangsters of a Japanese rightwing organisation 
thronged to the central headquarters of Chongnyon and cried 
"Koreans, get out of Japan" and "Chongnyon, get out of Japan". 
On the same day, a similar rowdyism was staged by scores of 
loudspeaker cars of the rightwing organisation in front of the 
buildings of the Federation of Korean Credit Associations in 
Japan and the Tonghae Trading Company. 
  On April 14, a schoolgirl of the Tokyo Korean middle and 
high 
school was beaten on the head by an unidentified man in a 
tramcar. Such cases of violence are frequently reported from 
various parts of Japan. 
  The statement said the responsibility for these cases rested 
with the Japanese Government authorities who have pursued a 
hostile policy toward the DPRK and incited hatred for the Korean 
residents in Japan, while strengthening the "cooperation system" 
of the United States, Japan and South Korea under the pretext of 
fictitious "nuclear issue of the North". 
  "The current trend in which they foster persecution of the 
Korean residents in Japan, spreading unfounded rumours, reminds 
us of the eve of the great earthquake of 1923 in Kanto district 
after which Koreans were massacred," the statement said, and 
added: 
  "We demand that the Japanese Government authorities promptly 
renounce their hostile policy toward the DPRK and take measures 
to prevent recurrence of outrages by rightwing gangsters and 
that some media stop unwarrantable anti-DPRK propaganda and 
prejudiced reporting that incites chauvinism."

  [Text] BANGKOK -- Deputy Commerce Minister Churin 
Laksanawisit stated after his return from Vietnam, that he 
reached a comprehensive agreement with Vietnam for the 
protection of bilateral intellectual property rights and drug 
patents. 
  According to Churin, the agreement is the first of its kind 
between Thailand and Vietnam's Public Health Ministry on the 
registration (patent) of medicines in both countries. 
  "This will help protect the trademarks of Thai medicines, 
and 
its import process (into Vietnam) will be convenient, too," said 
Churin who just returned from an official visit to Vietnam. 
  By signing the agreements with Vietnam and holding talks 
with 
two major Vietnamese medicine importers, Churin is hopeful that 
Thai medicine will be able to tap the Vietnamese medicine market 
estimated at around 20 billion baht annually. 
  Another agreement that the deputy commerce minister has 
entered into with Vietnam's Commerce Ministry is on intellectual 
property rights. Churin said that Thailand plans to enter into 
similar agreements with all the Indochinese countries, Myanmar 
[Burma] and China. After agreements are made with all these 
countries, Thailand will host a meeting among these countries 
about property rights and copyrights. 
  While in Vietnam, the Thai deputy minister also held talks 
with Vietnamese commerce ministry officials on the rice issue. 
Both Thailand and Vietnam produce about three million tons of 
low-quality rice, so both countries have to compete in the world 
market. To avoid fierce competition, Jurin has invited the 
Vietnamese commerce minister to talks in Bangkok.

<F P=106> [By Yi Sang-sok from Washington] </F>
  [Text] On 21 April, the U.S. press reported that the ROK 
has agreed with the United States to purchase a series of latest 
weapons, including Apache offensive helicopters, to hasten its 
plan to modernize the Army's war capabilities. 
  Quoting U.S. officials' remarks in an article dispatched 
from 
Seoul that day, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL reported: "The ROK 
agreed with Defense Secretary William Perry to purchase a series 
of latest U.S. weapons, including Apache helicopters. The list 
of U.S. weapons to be purchased by the ROK also includes 
ultramodern anti- tank missiles, night fluoroscopes, a 
satellite-using graphical site picture system, communication 
equipment that guarantees higher security, and battery-sensing 
radars." 
  This paper also reported: "Because of the ROK-U.S. agreement 
on the purchase of weapons, major U.S. defense industrial 
companies -- such as McDonald Douglas; General Motors; and 
Raytheon, which manufactures Patriot missiles -- have been able 
to sell their military equipment to the ROK. 
  On the same day, in an article on Secretary Perry's ROK 
visit, the LOS ANGELES TIMES reported that the ROK agreed with 
the United States to purchase latest U.S. weapons, including 
battery-sensing radars. 
  Quoting U.S. officials' remarks, THE WASHINGTON POST also 
reported: "The ROK and the United States have reached an 
agreement on the purchase of ultramodern U.S. weapons. The 
ROK's commitment on the weapons purchase, however, does not 
fully satisfy the U.S. original expectations.

<F P=106> [By Shoichi Totani] </F>
  [Text] What draws one's attention about Tsutomu Hata, the 
next prime minister, are his ties with business circles as it 
can mean direct links with "money" sources. Hata will replace 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, whom the public had hoped 
would tear down collusion among politicians, bureaucrats, and 
businessmen, but ended up resigning over "suspected dirty money" 
cases involving himself. Hata, whose selling point is his 
"clean" image, appears to have nothing to do with business 
circles at first glance. But "support groups" for him have been 
formed one after another since the beginning of the Heisei era 
[1989], and he is surrounded by business leaders as much as 
other powerful politicians are. 
  The "biggest" support group for Hata is the "Uyu-kai," 
composed of members of metropolitan business circles. 
Representatives of this group are Ken Moroi, chairman of 
Chichibu Cement Corp.; Sho Nasu, chairman of Tokyo Electric 
Power Corp.; and Yoshihisa Tabuchi, adviser to Nomura Securities 
Corp. Among members of the group are Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman 
of Toyota Motor Corp. (next chairman of Keidanren [Japan 
Federation of Economic Organizations]); Tadahiro Sekimoto, 
president of NEC Corp.; and top executives from Japan's 38 
leading companies like Nissan Motor Corp., Toshiba Corp., Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Sumitomo Chemical Corp., Seiyu 
Corp., and IBM Japan. Since the first year of the Heisei era, 
the group has met two or three times a year. 
  The "Shinshi-kai" is composed of about 30 members, including 
business leaders from Nagano Prefecture, Hata's home prefecture, 
and top executives from companies having close ties with Nagano. 
Representatives of this group are Yoshio Nakayama, honorary 
president of Cosmo Oil Corp.; Yoshio Maruta, chairman of Kao 
Corp.; Kaneo Fujimori, adviser to Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank; and 
Shigenobu Yamamoto, adviser to Hino Motors Corp. 
  There is no particular support group composed of graduates 
of 
Seijo University, Hata's alma mater. But Ryoichi Kito, who is 
the president of the machine tool maker Kito (head office in 
Yamanashi Prefecture) and was Hata's senior at Seijo High 
School, serves as a representative of the "Shisui-kai" which is 
made up of top executives from 15 firms of middle standing. 
  What is noteworthy is that all of those support groups 
formed 
in the Heisei era. An official of Hata's office claimed: "This 
has happened only because Mr. Hata gained power and made a name 
for himself during his days in the Liberal Democratic Party." 
Many business leaders, meanwhile, said: "We were impressed by 
the stand of Mr. Hata who tackled the political reform issues 
seriously, risking his political life." 
  Mitsuo Fukawa, who is president of Nisshin Oil Mills Corp. 
and a graduate of Seijo University, supported this view, saying: 
"Mr. Hata is a good-hearted man who carried though his resolve 
(in political reform and other major issues)." 
  So far, Hata has not always had strong influence on business 
circles, however. A "Uyu-kai" member asked more of him, saying: 
"His connections with business circles are more extensive than 
those of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. I should say his 
connections are more extensive, but shallower. He presens a 
clean image on money matters, and there is nothing more to ask 
of his personality, but that is not good enough for a prime 
minister. He should learn to exert more leadership."

  [Text] The new Hata administration will take off early next 
week. The business sector and major government ministries and 
agencies have high hopes in the new prime minister's strong 
leadership--since he has rich experience as a cabinet 
minister--and expect him to pass the draft 1994 budget as soon 
as possible. Deliberations on the budget have been delayed 
considerably. 
  However, during the coalition's recent consultations on the 
key policy of tax reform, the allergy of the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] to the consumption tax surfaced once 
again, thus revealing the coalition government's weak point. 
Furthermore, there are a multitude of other issues which may 
shake the very foundation of the government, such as the 
amendment of the Food Control Law in line with the 
liberalization of the rice market. 
<H5>  Tax Reform, Budget </H5>
  The Ministry of Finance [MOF] believes that as far as tax 
reform is concerned, "while the coalition's policy accord 
represents major progress, the SDPJ still holds the key to tax 
reform" (according to the Tax Bureau). During the recent 
consultations, the SDPJ again showed an allergy to a consumption 
tax increase. 
  The new administration will have to make a final decision on 
the extent of the tax hike along with considering the issue of 
amending or abolishing the consumption tax. It is said that 
even if the tax hike is limited to a small margin or the old tax 
rate for foodstuffs is retained for the SDPJ's sake, "a 
rekindling of discord in the SDPJ is inevitable; even if a bill 
is submitted, the SDPJ might rebel at the last minute" 
(according to the Tax Bureau). The new administration will 
probably face a major challenge in June. 
  On the other hand, deliberations on the budget for the new 
fiscal year, which has remained untouched for 50 days since its 
submission on 4 March, will probably begin after the Golden Week 
holidays [29 April-5 May]. The prevailing view is that, "at 
worst," enactment of the budget by the new administration will 
come "in late July." The passage of the budget is also deemed 
hopeless before the provisional budget expires on 20 May. The 
MOF intends to start compiling another provisional budget while 
taking into consideration the outcome of consultations between 
the ruling and opposition parties on the deliberation schedule 
for the budget. 
<H5>  Deregulation: Concern About Resistance From Bureaucrats and </H5>
the Business Sector 
  With regard to deregulation, a major component of the 
Hosokawa administration's economic reform program and also a key 
to a breakthrough in Japan-U.S. relations, Hata says "this 
should be implemented steadily." He shows enthusiasm to promote 
deregulation as one of his major policies. 
  However, the relaxation of regulations "is a difficult 
problem bearing on the issue of employment" (according to a 
senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] 
official). There are concerns about how far Hata, who is 
criticized for "listening too much to the bureaucrats," can put 
down the resistance of the bureaucracy and the involved business 
sectors. 
<H5>  Economic Management: Economic Planning Agency Sees No Need </H5>
for Further Pump-Priming 
  Since the economy is in a very delicate condition, all eyes 
are on what economic policies the Hata administration will come 
up with. The Economic Planning Agency [EPA] says, "At this 
point, we are not in a position to formulate new stimulation 
measures, and there is no need for that" (according to Makoto 
Kobayashi, director general of the Coordination Bureau). This 
is because the impact of the third fiscal 1993 supplementary 
budget compiled to implement the 15.25 trillion yen economic 
package announced in February will be felt soon. The EPA 
stresses that it would be more important to pass the draft 1994 
budget--which has been submitted to the Diet, but deliberation 
on which has been long delayed--rather than formulate new 
economic measures. 
<H5>  Agricultural Policy: Concern Already Voiced on Possible </H5>
Obstruction by the LDP and SDPJ 
  Ratification of the Uruguay Round accord will be the focal 
issue at the extraordinary Diet session this fall. Amendments 
to the Food Control Law and measures to assist domestic farmers 
as a result of the partial liberalization of the rice market are 
likely to be the major issues. Since there is serious concern 
about the effect of rice imports on domestic farmers, senior 
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries officials are 
wary that "the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the SDPJ, 
which are opposed to ratification, may come up with arbitrary 
demands on measures to assist farmers in return for ratifying 
the Uruguay Round accord." 
  There is also growing demand among consumers for a drastic 
revamping of agricultural administration. The key issues will 
be how to formulate policies on food reserve and rice acreage 
reduction to satisfy both producers and consumers, and how to go 
about revising the Food Control Law. 
<H5>  Japan-U.S. Frictions </H5>
  The Foreign Ministry has high hopes on Foreign Minister 
Hata's premiership. It says, "The continuity of foreign policy 
can be maintained. He will be able to exercise leadership in 
mending Japan-U.S. economic relations" (according to a senior 
official). 
  At Hata's meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor in Morocco, the United States demanded implementation of 
further measures to expand domestic demand, such as continued 
income tax reduction, and concessions with regard to objective 
criteria as conditions for resuming the economic framework talks. 
  While the government intends to come up with a second 
economic package to expand domestic demand and open the market 
in June, the SDPJ has persistently shown an allergy to the issue 
of a consumption tax hike, which is expected to be the main 
revenue source to finance extended income tax cuts and 
additional public investment. Whether Japan is able to come up 
with substantial results at the ruling coalition parties' 
consultations on tax reform, and thus conclude the economic 
framework talks before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting scheduled 
for July will be the critical issue in bringing about a 
breakthrough in bilateral economic frictions. 
<H5>  Vice-Ministerial Level Official May Be Sent to the United </H5>
States To Work for Resuming the Framework Talks 
  A top MITI official disclosed on 22 April that a 
vice-miniterial level official may be sent to the United States 
as early as immediately after the Golden Week holidays to start 
unofficial negotiations to reopen the framework talks. 
  According to this official, at the Hata-Kantor meeting in 
Marrakech, the United States presented three conditions for 
resuming the talks. Japan intends to consider its response after 
the inauguration of the new administration in the hope of using 
this as a step to reopening the talks.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Watanabe Suffering From Serious </F>
Aftereffects"] 
  [Text] Former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister 
Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is suffering from 
the aftereffects of the withdrawal of his plan to secede from 
the LDP and run for the premiership. His plan created a stir in 
the political world, and eventually the political confusion not 
only seriously damaged Mr. Watanabe's dignity, but his own 
faction is about to split. Mr. Watanabe, who is eager to make a 
comeback to the political scene as a key player, recently said: 
"The proverb says, `If you fall down seven times, get up eight.' 
But, in my case, I get up 11 times if I fall down 10 times." 
In this way, Mr. Watanabe, without pausing to feel the 
heartbreak, is busy trying to maintain his influence. However, 
the prospect of him regaining influential power is dim. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Utsunomiya City on 23 
April, 
Mr. Watanabe indicated his intention to dissolve the Watanabe 
faction in the near future, saying: "Factions are unnecessary in 
the single-seat constituency system. I want to dissolve my 
faction when the law on districts within constituencies is 
adopted." He went on to say, "From now on, I want to come to 
grips with drastic reform within the LDP and, at the same time, 
study the possibility of changing the name of the party," thus 
showing his intention to remain in the party and make a fresh 
start. 
  The recent political turmoil caused by Mr. Watanabe has 
further deepened conflict within his faction between a group of 
young members who joined after Mr. Watanabe took over the 
faction which had been headed by former Prime Minister Nakasone, 
and senior faction members who joined the faction before Mr. 
Watanabe took over the faction. In addition, Mr. Koji 
Kakizawa's secession from the faction must have caused a crack 
in relations between Mr. Watanabe and his close 
associates--including Taku Yamazaki, Bunmei Ibuki, and Kabun 
Muto--who have so far supported Mr. Watanabe. 
  Although a general meeting of the Watanabe faction was held 
on 22 April, 16 faction members who are upper house members 
refused to attend the meeting. This was because they were 
getting tired of interfaction confusion caused by Mr. Watanabe's 
decision to run for the election, so they decided to hold their 
own meeting. They expressed dissatisfaction with the leadership 
of the faction, saying, "We upper house members were not kept 
well informed of how the situation was proceeding." With such 
dissatisfaction in the background, some of them say they will 
leave the faction if the situation requires it. 
  So far, Mr. Watanabe, in his political activities, has 
placed 
emphasis on his faction. However, he is now required to review 
his activities because of the faction's instability and the fact 
that the next election will be held under a combined electoral 
system of single-seat and proportional representation 
constituencies for the House of Representatives election. 
Within the faction there is a move toward concentrating 
pro-Watanabe groups through the possible formation of a policy 
study group like "Onchi-kai," once headed by Mr. Watanabe, or 
some other study group. 
  However, within the LDP, there are those saying: "Mr. 
Watanabe has to take responsibility for his decision--which was 
later withdrawn--to leave the party, because he is leader of his 
faction. His political career is now at an end" (according to a 
senior member of the Obuchi faction). In this way, there is a 
growing frosty atmosphere within the party regarding him. Mr. 
Watanabe sought a tie-up with Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa, 
who is notorious in the LDP, even though he knew that such a 
move would lead to his secession from the LDP. Such an attempt 
must have accelerated the anti-Watanabe mood in the LDP. 
  Being conscious of such a mood, Mr. Watanabe has recently 
refrained from approaching Mr. Ozawa. At a meeting with faction 
members who have been elected three or four times at a Japanese 
restaurant in Tokyo, Mr. Watanabe reportedly criticized Mr. 
Ozawa's political methods, saying "he has gone a little too 
far." Moreover, he has reportedly told a leader of another 
faction that "we have to watch out for Shinseito's attempt to 
win our faction members over to their side." 
  Meanwhile, Mr. Ozawa recently said, "I still want to work 
with him if he leaves the LDP," thus sending a signal to Mr. 
Watanabe. Although it is reported that Mr. Ozawa and Mr. 
Watanabe share common policies, including the theory of the 
nation, and have an affinity for each other, it is extremely 
uncertain whether relations between Mr. Ozawa and Mr. Watanabe 
will continue to have an impact on moves toward regrouping 
political parties.

  [Text] On 24 April, Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister of the Liberal Democratic Party, 
commented about his future cooperation with Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party]. He said: "If our policy goals are the same, it 
is natural for us to begin by first joining our hands to do that 
which is beneficial for Japan." Watanabe made his remarks in an 
appearance on a program broadcast by FNN TV Network the same 
day. He indicated he plans to continue seeking possible 
cooperation with Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and 
other party members. 
  Watanabe disclosed his views, saying: "Under a single-seat 
constituency system, there will eventually emerge two large 
political parties." He then pointed out: "I doubt whether the 
current coalition alliance would merge into a single party." He 
thus disclosed his expectation that those advocating similar 
policies will eventually form an alliance.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Alliance Was Formed in </F>
High-Handed Manner; Ozawa Moves the Stage; Political World 
Reorganization Speeding Up"] 
  [Text] The leading actor is Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the 
Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]; the supporting actor is former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa; and the scenario writer cum 
director is Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party]. This is the picture one can draw from the drama 
being played in the sudden formation of the parliamentary group 
"Kaishin" in the House of Representatives on 25 April on the 
heels of the appointment of Tsutomu Hata as prime minister. 
  A top leader of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], 
which was left out of the alliance within the ruling camp, could 
not hide his displeasure, saying: "I could not have anticipated 
something like this happening at this time." The formation of 
the parliamentary group that proceeded while the cabinet was 
being formed is likely not only to have a major impact on Prime 
Minister Hata's power base, but will also speed up the overall 
reorganization of the political world. For Hata, who had to 
watch the developments alone in the prime minister's residence, 
this is literally the embarkation of his cabinet on rough seas. 
  The man who began the work of forming the alliance this time 
was Ouchi, who until very recently had sided with Tomiichi 
Murayama, chairman of the SDPJ, and Masayoshi Takemura, 
representative of Sakigake [Harbinger], in opposing the 
Shinseito and Komeito-led concept of forming a new-new party or 
a large alliance of parties. Ouchi met with Takemura and 
Murayama separately on 25 April, and sought their understanding 
on forming the "Kaishin" alliance. But Sakigake responded 
negatively, and Murayama remained cold, stating: "All I heard 
was the DSP explaining intraparty problems." A concerned 
official insisted: "Ouchi pleaded with Murayama, saying, `There 
is no other choice but for the DSP to go along. Please accept 
it.'" There was no question that in the series of developments 
over the formation of "Kaishin," Ouchi's actions were 
conspicuous. 
  According to DSP officials, Ouchi met with Shinseito's 
Ichiro 
Ozawa about 23 April at the request of the latter. Takashi 
Yonezawa, secretary general of the DSP and a close friend of 
Ozawa, was said to have acted as an intermediary between the 
two. In this meeting, Ouchi is supposed to have proposed 
forming an alliance among the DSP, Shinseito, Japan New Party, 
and Sakigake. Ozawa concurred, saying: "That is fine." In a 
news conference following the party leaders' meeting on 22 
April, which decided to appoint Hata as the ruling coalition's 
candidate for prime minister, Ouchi appeared to be thinking and 
still undecided about the idea of forming the grand alliance 
because he said: "I want to specifically think about it." Few 
people within the DSP had been consulted on the matter in 
advance. 
  It was at the meeting of party Diet members of the two 
houses on the afternoon of 25 April, following his meetings with 
Takemura and Murayama, that Ouchi formally brought up the 
matter. Even though the party entrusted Ouchi and Yonezawa with 
decisionmaking on the matter, one who attended the meeting said: 
"Most Diet members were dumbfounded." 
  The situation was similar in the Japan New Party. After 
Ouchi and former Prime Minister Hosokawa met on the afternoon of 
25 April, there was a report to an informal meeting of party 
Diet members shortly past 1700 on forming the alliance with the 
DSP. A party staff official admitted it came as a surprise, 
saying: "No one but Hosokawa had known about it. It was an 
action that came as fast as a lightening." 
  Now that the parliamentary group has been formed, in 
assigning posts in the new cabinet their allocation will be made 
on the basis of the group. This means that the "Liberal Party," 
which was recently formed by defectors from the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP], may be able to win a post in the 
cabinet, and the DSP will be able to increase its posts from one 
to two. Consequently, within the SDPJ there is criticism that 
"Ouchi ran to Shinseito, baited by increased posts in the 
cabinet." Anyway, in creating the ruling parties' largest 
parliamentary group in the House of Representatives, there is 
the additional aim of bringing the SDPJ under control. A staff 
official from the Japan New Party noted: "The Hata government 
is supposed to have done soul-searching on problems that existed 
with the Hosokawa government. This may not please the SDPJ, but 
there is no other choice when we think about the need for 
taxation reform and about how we have to run the Diet." 
  The SDPJ, which met the surprise attack no sooner than an 
agreement was made regarding the prime ministership, is reacting 
fiercely. On the evening of that same day, a top party leader 
spat out in disgust: "That is unrelated to the SDPJ. Shinseito 
is probably behind all this." Following the meeting with Ouchi, 
Murayama phoned Ouchi and protested emphatically: "I am 
surprised this came about today. There is no way the SDPJ can 
accept it." 
  Things are proceeding at a speed much faster than the SDPJ 
expected. Even though Komeito is not participating in it, 
"Kaishin" is an exact duplicate of "Kaikaku" which Ozawa and 
Hosokawa sought to establish some time ago. There is no doubt 
this group will become the parent body for a new-new party. The 
three top SDPJ executives hastily met several times in the 
evening to discuss countermeasures. Meanwhile, former SDPJ 
cabinet members who assembled at party headquarters vented their 
anger. 
  Ozawa was triumphant following a ceremony marking the 
launching of the new alliance. He said: "This cannot be done 
unless we make the most of such an opportunity." The curtains 
for the Hata government appear to have been opened at the 
"Ozawa's pace"--once again.

  [Excerpts] On the afternoon of 25 April, the same day that 
Tsutomu Hata, chairman of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], was 
elected in the Diet as the next prime minister, some ruling 
coalition parties formed the Kaishin parliamentary group. In 
reacting against the parties' formation of the parliamentary 
group, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] then broke 
away from the coalition. The "post-Hosokawa political 
situation" is plunging the entire political world into great 
chaos and is leaving open the possibility of a second 
realignment of the established political parties. The discord 
over formation of the parliamentary group is creating a ripple 
within Shinseito, which has so far boasted of its cohesion, and 
is creating the possibility that the Japan New Party [JNP] will 
split again. Mr. Hata, who was elected prime minister in the 
Diet but who has yet to form his cabinet, is still unable to 
inaugurate his government. The functioning of politics is in a 
state of complete paralysis. 
  Five political parties and a group including Shinseito 
formed 
the parliamentary group, but the parliamentary group hit a snag 
just one day after it was formed. In reacting strongly to moves 
by the five political parties and a group to form the 
parliamentary group without prior consultations, the SDPJ broke 
away from the coalition. The Hata government thus would remain a 
minority in the Diet without the SDPJ and the foundation of the 
Hata government would be unstable. Moves are afoot to explore 
ways to scrap the parliamentary group. Shinseito Secretary 
General Ichiro Ozawa is coming under a barrage of criticism from 
some Shinseito members for promoting the formation of the 
parliamentary group while keeping key senior Shinseito members 
in the dark about it. The formation of the parliamentary group 
may trigger another split of the JNP. [passage omitted on 
meeting of Shinseito] 
  The Shinseito members who had prior knowledge of the 
formation of the parliamentary group, which was done on 25 
April, were only Mr. Ozawa; Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of 
international trade and industry; and Sadao Hirano, a member of 
the House of Councilors. Mr. Toshio Yamaguchi is said to have 
been involved in the formation of the parliamentary group, and 
his involvement has sparked anger among Shinseito members, which 
is adding fuel to fire. 
  A senior Shinseito member said bluntly, "No matter what Mr. 
Ozawa does from now on, we no longer trust him." The "Ozawa 
myth" has been abruptly tarnished. 
  The JNP, which is led by former Prime Minister Hosokawa, is 
in a more serious situation. Discord is growing between the 
party executive, including Secretary General Matsuoka, who has 
ridden the wave of the Ozawa-Hosokawa alliance, and 
antiexecutive members. The formation of the parliamentary group 
is becoming the seeds of fresh intraparty strife. Dozens of JNP 
members including Mr. Takashi Kawamura met in Tokyo on the 
evening of 26 April. During the meeting, they decided to ask 
the executive to shelve the parliamentary group and they termed 
the process of forming the parliamentary group absurdly hasty. 
  Three legislators who recently quit the Japan New Party have 
formed the Group Seiun, and this group and some junior 
antiexecutive legislators are rumored to be planning to join 
Sakigake [Harbinger]. 
  In this situation, acting Shinseito Secretary General Kozo 
Watanabe told a meeting of Shinseito legislators on 26 April: 
"Former Prime Minister Hosokawa and Chairman Ouchi of the 
Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] have proposed forming a 
parliamentary group while calling on Shinseito to join the 
group. The proposal was made when the ruling coalition parties 
discussed choosing Mr. Hata to be prime minister. Shinseito 
responded gratefully to the proposal and decided to accept it." 
  Commenting on the formation of the parliamentary group, the 
notification of which was made to the Diet on 25 April when Mr. 
Hata was elected in the Diet as the next prime minister, a 
leader of the DSP stressed that the parliamentary group was 
formed on Shinseito's initiative, saying, "A veteran Shinseito 
politician who is well versed in Diet affairs has insisted on 
forming the parliamentary group, and our party acceded to his 
insistence." 
  Moves are spreading within Shinseito to "make efforts to 
seek 
an understanding with the SDPJ by scrapping the parliamentary 
group." According to a senior Shinseito member, "Mr. Ozawa 
thinks only of a frontal breakthrough" and his obstinacy is 
keeping the political situation deadlocked.

  [Text] Three top executives of Rengo [Japanese Trade Union 
Confederation] held an emergency meeting in Atami city, Shizuoka 
Prefecture, on 26 April. Following the secession of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the coalition, they 
confirmed Rengo's policy of deciding whether or not to cooperate 
with Hata's new administration "on a case-by-case basis, based 
on policy." In a news conference, Rengo Chairman Akira 
Yamagishi said: "If a minority ruling group is formed without 
the SDPJ, it will be impossible to manage the political 
situation in a normal manner. While it is not good to conduct an 
election under the multiple-seat constituency system which was 
`pronounced dead,' the Diet is likely to be dissolved soon." He 
thus predicted there is a possibility of Diet dissolution under 
the present multiple-seat constituency system after passage of 
the 1994 budget bill.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Do Not Leave Administrative Reform to the </F>
Bureaucrats"] 
  [Text] Even as the leader of the coalition government is 
changed from Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, the need to implement political, as well as 
administrative reform -- which the people expected the coalition 
administration to accomplish at the time of its inauguration -- 
remains unchanged. We hope that under the new administration, 
the political authorities will not be influenced by bureaucrats, 
and will take the initiative in promoting administrative reform. 
  After the bursting of the bubble, Japan's economy is facing 
structural problems amid a prolonged recession. The yen 
continues to appreciate due to Japan's huge trade surplus; Japan 
is losing its industrial competitiveness with the rapid 
industrialization of other Asian countries; and the phenomenon 
of "hollowing out"--with factories being moved overseas--is now 
taking place. 
  Furthermore, due to the overwhelming export surplus, no 
solution is forthcoming in Japan's economic friction with 
Western countries. Under the circumstances, reducing the trade 
surplus to rectify the trend of excessive yen appreciation 
through the expansion of domestic demand and market 
liberalization has become an urgent task. 
  In this connection, it is important to abolish in principle 
various regulations obstructing participation of new businesses 
in the market and those restricting the daily operations of the 
business sector, and to give full play to the spirit of 
entrepreneurship. Under the Hosokawa administration, the 
Economic Reform Study Council, in its interim report of November 
1993, already came up with the concept that the economy "should 
be free in principle, and regulated only in exceptional cases." 
  Therefore, the new cabinet should work for the 
implementation 
of this principle. It should set a deadline, perhaps three to 
five years from now, for the complete abolition of economic 
regulations. If the bureaucrats want some exceptions, they 
should explain the reasons to the people, and exceptions should 
only be allowed in cases agreed upon by the people. 
  A total of 94 deregulation measures were included in the 
emergency economic package announced in September 1993. They 
represented a negligible number of deregulation measures which 
were acceptable to the bureaucrats. We do not want a repetition 
of such phony deregulation. 
  In administrative reform, a drastic reduction and 
rationalization of administrative organs, including public 
corporations, and laying off unnecessary personnel are as 
important as deregulation. If sectarian administration is 
rectified, outdated regulations are abolished, and economic 
regulations are eliminated in principle, a small government will 
certainly be quite enough. 
  The private sector is struggling amid the storm of 
restructuring, resorting to such measures as prompting voluntary 
retirement, or reducing new recruitments. It will likewise be a 
matter of course for the government to undergo restructuring, 
since its revenue income is diminishing. By merely reducing the 
number of new recruits by half from now on will result in the 
elimination of unnecessary tasks and organizational 
rationalization in the long run. There will also be less 
"amakudari" [the practice of retired senior bureaucrats taking 
up lucrative positions in semi-government or private 
organizations]. 
  By implementing such reforms, fiscal spending will surely be 
reduced substantially. The Finance Ministry has no scruples 
about asking for a tax increase to rehabilitate government 
finances even without doing anything about expenditures. Such a 
way of thinking is putting the cart before the horse. 
  The problem is, administrative reform may end up 
half-finished under a bureaucrat-led political regime, as in the 
case of the Hosokawa administration. The bureaucrats cannot be 
expected to collaborate in instituting reforms that will 
undermine their own interests. 
  For Japan's long-term interest, administrative reform has to 
be implemented even at the cost of eliminating the bureaucrats' 
resistance. We hope the new administration will make this 
difficult choice.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What Is Being Asked of New Prime Minister Hata"] </F>
  [Text] Mr. Tsutomu Hata was named prime minister in 
plenary sessions of the two Diet houses on 25 April. He is the 
80th prime minister, and the 51st person to serve as prime 
minister. 
  We hope newly appointed Prime Minister Hata will take over 
the intent of "reform government" pursued by former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and will go forward with courage 
toward fundamental reform of the nation's political, economic, 
and administrative systems. 
  Upon the launching of the new government, we would like to 
ask the following two points of Prime Minister Hata. 
  The first is his basic stand on political reform. 
  Mr. Hata is regarded as a relatively clean politician who 
has 
pursued the tasks of political reform with passion since he was 
with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], thus winning himself 
the nickname of "Mr. Political Reform." 
  We completely agree with his purpose, declaring that if 
plutocratic corruption cannot be removed, there will be no 
future for the politics of Japan. 
  We also respect his determination shown in leaving the LDP 
after concluding that the LDP has no will to carry out political 
reform, and in deciding to head newly formed Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] to make it a front-runner in the first stage of 
reorganization of the political world. 
  But there is a problem with what happened after that. What 
has been done in political reform? To be sure, political 
reform-related bills have been passed, but they are political 
reform bills in name only, with loopholes everywhere. 
  While the song of political reform was being sung, huge 
election campaign funds were spent by political parties in the 
general election to get new faces elected. Later, the general 
contractor scandal involving Shinseito General Secretary Ichiro 
Ozawa surfaced and the suspicion of Prime Minister Hosokawa 
having used Sagawa Kyubin money was raised, but there has been 
no leadership mobilized to delve into the facts of these matters. 
  The four characters "sei-ji-rin-ri" [political ethics] in 
new 
policy guidelines which the ruling coalition parties had agreed 
on in establishing the coalition government have disappeared 
completely. The political history of Mr. Hata, who belonged to 
the Tanaka faction and then the Takeshita faction, is one that 
tells he was right in the middle of the LDP's plutocratic 
politics. He has not yet cleared himself in this regard. 
  When asked about his possible links to plutocratic 
corruption, Mr. Hata's set answer is "That is why we need to 
carry out political reform." But what we want to ask 
politicians is not about what they said in words but what they 
did in deeds. At least, he is the head of Shinseito, the banner 
of which is political reform. It is difficult to say he has 
fulfilled his reponsibilities in all phases of political reform. 
  The second point is his relationship with Mr. Ozawa. Mr. 
Hata was a key man supporting the Hosokawa government as deputy 
prime minister and foreign minister. There was the inevitable 
division of labor between Mr. Ozawa and Mr. Hata--the former 
being in charge of party affairs and the latter performing 
official functions. 
  But during the eight months of the Hosokawa administration, 
there have been so many out-of-the-blue incidents like the 
proposals on the national welfare tax, the cabinet reshuffle, 
and formation of an alliance excluding the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger]. In each case, 
Mr. Hosokawa took the form of being the initiator of action, but 
actually it was a product of Mr. Ozawa's attempt to manipulate 
government operations. 
  There is no denying that such high-handed political 
techniques coming from a dual power structure only speeded up 
the demise of the Hosokawa government. 
  Even in the new government, Mr. Hata's position is very weak 
as the party head who should be able to check Mr. Ozawa's 
operations. 
  Mr. Hata, who himself says "what matters for me is to 
function as a coordinator," will not be able to function as a 
controller over his friend and political game player, Mr. Ozawa. 
And this presents a question on his qualifications as a 
political leader. 
  It is very likely that the Hata government will turn out to 
be a Ozawa-run government. In a dual power system, there are 
many problems because it is unclear who is politically 
responsible, and it is difficult for the public to understand 
such a system. 
  Prime Minister Hata should do all he can not to repeat what 
his predecessor did, and to run the government in a transparant 
manner, while mainintaing his independence and moderation as the 
top government executive. 
  It will be only a matter of time before the public decides 
to 
abandon him if Prime Minister Hata acts only as an actor in 
scenarios written by Mr. Ozawa.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Precarious Start of the Administration Without </F>
the Social Democratic Party of Japan"] 
  [Text] After the Hosokawa coalition cabinet's resignation 
en masse, Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister and leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], was 
nominated as the 51st prime minister of Japan. 
  However, the formation of the cabinet has been substantially 
delayed, and the unexpected secession of the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the coalition government has taken 
place. This was the result of the SDPJ's strong protest over the 
sudden materialization of the plan to form a large parliamentary 
group to unify the coalition parties. Thus, the new 
administration has set sail amid a raging storm. 
  The plan to form a large parliamentary group was proposed 
repeatedly by Shinseito and Komeito even during the previous 
administration. This time it was Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the 
Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], who made the suggestion. 
Apparently, the purpose is to form a group around Shinseito and 
a group which is larger than the biggest ruling party, the SDPJ, 
to consolidate the power base of the administration. This is 
also linked to plans to form a new new party [shin shinto]. 
  Shinseito's Ichiro Ozawa will probably be the central figure 
in the new parliamentary group. This ambush of the SDPJ 
immediately after the election of the prime minister in the Diet 
came after the attempted exclusion of the SDPJ to permit some 
coalition parties to support Michio Watanabe's candidacy for the 
premiership and after the recent meetings to reach a policy 
accord. 
  SDPJ Diet members would rather not leave the coalition, and 
they are also being enticed with the chance to become the "joint 
candidate of the ruling parties" in the next general election to 
be held under the single-seat constituency system. Therefore, 
Ozawa and his associates were very confident about their plan. 
<H5>  Added Momentum in the Realignment of the Political World </H5>
  However, even supporters of the coalition in the SDPJ were 
incensed by the series of arbitrary actions taken. The decision 
to leave the coalition was a matter of course because the SDPJ 
had had serious policy differences with the coalition in the 
first place. The SDPJ is now expected to strengthen its 
cooperation with Sakigake [Harbinger], which had left the 
coalition earlier, and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is 
also expected to make its own moves. Thus, the outlook for the 
realignment of political parties remains volatile. 
  The Hata administration is expected to be Shinseito-led, 
with 
the chief cabinet secretary and other key cabinet ministers, in 
addition to the prime minister, all coming from this party. 
  The new administration faces many difficult policy issues. 
One urgent issue is to start deliberations on the FY 1994 
budget. Solutions acceptable to the people are also needed on 
the issues of an economic recovery, mending the stalled 
Japan-U.S. economic relations, and tax reform. Work remains to 
be done on deregulation, the decentralization of power, 
information disclosure, and economic and administrative reforms 
advocated by the previous administration. 
  How to deal with the DPRK (North Korea), with which 
relations 
have been shaken by its suspected development of nuclear arms, 
is also a serious problem. The government has to act cautiously 
on this issue and avoid creating unnecessarily a sense of crisis. 
  It is indeed difficult to expect strong leadership from 
Prime 
Minister Hata, who admits to "acting out the scenario written by 
Ozawa" and who has always acceded to the bureaucrats' wishes. 
While he probably intends to exercise political leadership 
through "Shinseito's domination," the administration is expected 
to be extremely unstable without the SDPJ's participation. 
  Ozawa and his group's tendency to adopt an arbitrary style 
and methods is not unrelated to what is happening right now. 
Hata, a coordinator type of personality, is said to have subtle 
differences with Ozawa in terms of political style and the 
concept of the state. He has, however, consistently gone along 
with Ozawa in the end. This way of dealing with things leaves 
serious concern when it comes to handling an issue such as the 
Korean peninsula. 
  Even in Shinseito, which has relatively more experience as a 
ruling party, there are no elder politicians who have served as 
prime minister. It is, therefore, difficult to take advantage 
of such people's profound political and diplomatic experience. 
As a result, control of the bureaucrats will be weakened. 
  As for the other ruling parties, even the DSP has joined 
Shinseito's bloc, as if forming an encirclement of the SDPJ. 
  The opposition LDP is also unhelpful. President Yohei Kono 
is constantly on guard against Shinseito, and many LDP members 
follow his political line. Thus, the party is unable to come up 
with a viable rival political line. The present circumstances 
may possibly trigger further splits in the LDP. 
<H5>  The People Need To Keep a Close Watch </H5>
  It goes without saying that only the people can truly check 
on the political authorities. The citizens should watch and 
reflect on the words and deeds of each party and faction 
carefully in preparation for a possible dissolution of the Diet 
and the ensuing general election. 
  The present political situation resembles the nebulous 
postwar period, which experienced two coalition governments. 
The current case may be even more volatile. If the Hata 
administration is but a transition to a further principled 
political reorganization, then all the commotion about the new 
parliamentary group may still be meaningful. 
  The Hosokawa administration which was upholding political 
reform was pulled down by the prime minister's own money 
scandal. Hata, who is termed "Mr. Political Reform," should not 
forget his original convictions. Although laws have been passed 
on a reform of the political system, there is still a long way 
to go in the purification of the political sector. If Prime 
Minister Hata intends to exercise his own style of leadership, 
he should champion the cause of political reform.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Breakaway of the SDPJ From the Coalition </F>
Will Qualitatively Change the Hata Government"] 
  [Text] Tsutomu Hata, chairman of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], was elected the next prime minister. Some ruling 
coalition parties made moves to organize their parliamentary 
group just before a new cabinet was about to be formed and 
reacting against their moves, the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] broke away from the coalition. The formation of a 
new cabinet was deferred until after 26 April. The moves by some 
ruling coalition parties and the SDPJ's isolation are likely to 
further precipitate a realignment of the established political 
parties in the future. 
  Some ruling coalition parties abruptly formed a 
parliamentary 
group called "Kaishin" with the aim of leaving the SDPJ out in 
the cold, although the SDPJ shored up the coalition framework 
for the Hosokawa government and the formation of such a 
parliamentary group would change qualitatively and greatly the 
character of a new coalition government to be led by Mr. Hata. 
  The Hosokawa government managed to stay in power for eight 
months while showing from time to time the fragility of its 
coalition. The Hosokawa government was able to resolve such 
pending issues as the enactment of the Political Reform Law and 
the liberalization of rice imports thanks to broad public 
support. 
  Disgusted by nearly 40 years of rule by governments of the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and angered by a series of cases 
of political corruption under the LDP government, the people had 
hoped for new and fresh politics. The emergence of the 
fresh-imaged Prime Minister Hosokawa, who distinguished himself 
from other politicians, and the common platform of a change of 
government and political reform combined to give cohesive force 
and impetus to the Hosokawa government. The Hosokawa government 
was inaugurated amid public blessings. 
  What about the Hata government? There is no doubt that the 
people feel friendly toward Prime Minister Hata who is an 
ordinary person and a man of common sense. Nonetheless, the 
people have come to look coolly at the coalition government. An 
attempt to change the current coalition framework by forcibly 
ousting the SDPJ from the coalition gives us the impression that 
the attempt is a result of a high-handed political tactic 
employed by Mr. Ichiro Ozawa who is known as the kingmaker of 
the Hata government. 
  The people pinned high hopes on the Hosokawa government to 
push forward political reform, because such political parties as 
the Japan New Party and Sakigake [Harbinger], which distanced 
themselves from conventional politics, succeeded in rallying 
broad-ranging political forces while acting as an intermediary. 
  The Hosokawa government suffered a delay in decisionmaking 
because of intragovernment disagreement, but the interparty 
check-and-balance process enhanced to some extent the 
transparency of decisionmaking and the functions of the 
coalition government. If the SDPJ were pressed to change itself 
so as to act according to realpolitik, it would be a plus for 
the party. 
<H5>  Shinseito-Led Hata Government </H5>
  For the Hata government, which will take charge of politics 
after enactment of the Political Reform Law, there is no longer 
such a major domestic agenda as the political reform which held 
the ruling coalition parties together and made it possible for 
the Hosokawa government to enjoy broad public support. The 
showdown between Shinseito and the SDPJ, which first surfaced 
following their disagreement over the national welfare tax and a 
reshuffle of the Hosokawa cabinet and then intensified in 
choosing a successor to Prime Minister Hosokawa, resulted in 
ousting the SDPJ from the coalition. The political situation is 
now entering a new phase. 
  Prime Minister Hata has publicly said he would continue to 
pursue reform policies. The breakaway of Sakigake from the 
coalition and the isolation of the SDPJ will lead to a change in 
the character of the Hata government as a reformist government. 
The expressions of "the rooting out of political corruption" and 
"the thorough establishment of political ethics" are not found 
in the basic policies for a new coalition government. 
  Mr. Ichiro Ozawa, affiliated with Shinseito, took the lead 
in forming a new coalition government. The basic policies for a 
new coalition government include what Shinseito has advocated. 
We have no choice but to be concerned about the political 
tactics and structure that put the management of the political 
situation in the hands of a specific senior politician and keep 
the public in the dark about the decisionmaking process. 
  The Hata government is seeking its reform policies not in 
political reform and administrative reform, but in the 
establishment of political leadership. For the time being, the 
Hata government will have to deal with the reform of the current 
tax system, security, and the situation on the Korean peninsula. 
We want to point out once again that the establishment of 
political leadership is not simply a synonym for an arbitrary 
imposition of the leaders' wishes from above. 
  Political leadership means the leadership of politics over 
the way things are done within a bureaucracy. To that end, 
politics must stand on broad public support and take charge of 
stressing the interests of the public over the interests of 
government ministries and agencies that are perpetuated by 
bureaucratic sectionalism. If political leaders have a high 
sense of ethics and deep insight, then the political leadership 
will be guaranteed. What we hope is that Prime Minister Hata, a 
man of common sense, will establish a political leadership based 
upon the sense of the citizens. 
  Another thing that concerns us in connection with the 
inauguration of the Hata government, which is expected to be 
under Shinseito's thumb, is its relationship with the LDP, the 
opposition party. It is a matter of course that the coalition 
government, which came to power on the platform of rallying 
political forces to end LDP domination, sees the LDP as its 
major political rival. The coalition partners have been trying 
to split the LDP and keep it out of power in line with their 
major strategic goal, but such a strategic goal is not in tune 
with the present political situation. 
<H5>  Responsibility of the LDP as an Opposition Force </H5>
  Essentially, political parties must be formed, realigned, 
and 
merged in accordance with their policies and lines. The 
structure has been built whereby the established political 
parties have been pitted against each other and split into 
ruling and opposition parties primarily on the basis of their 
past deep-seated grudge relationship built upon the so-called 
"pro-Ozawa" and "anti-Ozawa theory." The policy distortion 
exposed by a big fuss over "Watanabe's breakaway from the LDP" 
and the strange political structure built upon the "pro-Ozawa" 
and the "anti-Ozawa theory" represents Japan's warped politics. 
  We see the Hata government as one emerging from the process 
of realigning the established political parties, with the 
aforementioned political situation taken into consideration. It 
is necessary to rally political forces again and promote the 
realignment of political parties primarily on the basis of 
policies. 
  If the political parties fail to do so, as seen in the 
history of giving birth to the Hata government, the political 
parties' goals will be only to cling to power, defend their 
organizations, and increase the seeds of future intraparty 
splits and confrontation. 
  The Hata government is increasingly led by Shinseito. If the 
Hata government, which formed the parliamentary group, has the 
ability to play a pivotal role in pushing for a full-fledged 
realignment of the established political parties in the near 
future, it is urgently necessary to rally political forces to 
counter the Hata government. Promoting a political system in the 
name of national unity and a national salvation cabinet is not a 
desirable tendency for present day politics which recognizes the 
existence of diverse opinions. The inauguration of the Hata 
government makes it a most important task for the LDP to reform 
and regenerate itself as a political force to counter the Hata 
government. 
  This is also true for the SDPJ which broke away from the 
coalition government.

  [Text] Now that the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] has left the coalition, it is certain the Hata government 
will have to manage Diet affairs backed by a minority ruling 
coalition. Government offices have now begun to worry about the 
future of the new government. It is highly likely that Diet 
deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget bill and other pending 
bills will be delayed. If arguments on tax reform become 
complicated, this will adversely affect new policies to be 
implemented with the fiscal 1995 budget. Because it is possible 
that the current political confusion will slow down the pace of 
deregulation, government offices have begun to worry that "the 
policies we have formulated might be baffled." 
  On 26 April, the Ministry of Finance [MOF] was covered with 
an oppressive air. Although the SDPJ had remained reluctant to 
agree on a consumption tax hike since the idea of introducing a 
national welfare tax caused an uproar, the ministry has tried to 
persuade the party to participate in tax reform debates the in 
coalition's tax reform council meetings. When the ministry's 
efforts were about to yield the desired results, the political 
confusion occurred. MOF is shocked because it is now highly 
likely that their efforts will go up in smoke. Its anxiety has 
deepened, thinking, "The SDPJ may come to oppose the consumption 
tax hike." 
  Some MOF officials have even begun to have ill feelings 
about 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, 
who is thought to be "sympathetic to the MOF." They said: "His 
way of doing things is not democratic. Is it really necessary 
for him to do things in such a high-handed manner?" The Home 
Affairs Ministry, which is calling for introducing regional 
consumption taxes, is also concerned about the future of tax 
reform. 
  The Economic Planning Agency is worried that if the House of 
Representatives is dissolved, the product liability bill, which 
was compiled jointly by nine ministries and agencies, might be 
carried over to the next Diet session. If this happens, they 
will not be able to carry out the initial plan to enforce the 
law next summer. Meanwhile, the Health and Welfare Ministry is 
anxious about the pension system reform bill, which includes a 
proposal to raise the age at which people qualify for old-age 
pensions. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry has 
submitted to the Diet a bill to promote deregulation of the gas 
industry. It also plans to submit a bill on deregulation in the 
electric power and oil industries. The ministry takes the 
current situation seriously, saying, "The delay in enforcing 
these laws will have negative effects on people's living." The 
Transport Ministry also has pending bills. They are the bill to 
revise the road transportation and vehicle law to abolish a 
mandatory six-month car inspection and the bill to revise the 
aviation law to obligate airliners to inform the government of 
their planned air fare discounts. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries is 
worried that the current political turmoil might affect its work 
to formulate a new farm policy, including the revision of a food 
control system, which is soon to be carried out on a full scale. 
The ministry thinks "It is certain that a hot controversy will 
rage in the Diet this autumn on the ratification of the Uruguay 
Round agreement." It is also feared that although the Farm 
Ministry holds a meeting of the Rice Price Council around June 
every year, it will have to delay it this year due to the 
political turmoil. Some people have begun to think that the 
Farm Ministry will fail to not only decide rice prices but also 
to launch its rice policy, and "this will affect government's 
rice collection after the summer."

  [Text] The breakaway of the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan (SDPJ] from the coalition is very likely to make it 
difficult to resume the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks. With no way found to raise the consumption tax in an 
effort to secure financial resources to make up for a fiscal 
shortfall resulting from the income tax reduction, it has become 
difficult for the Japanese Government to announce plans for a 
full-fledged income tax reduction which the U.S. Government has 
sought prior to Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled for July. The 
Japanese Government is committed to mapping out another set of 
measures to open up the Japanese market in June, but it will 
have nothing to present to the U.S. Government unless it decides 
how to reform the current tax system. The Japanese Government 
plans to hold informal consultations with the U.S. Government to 
discuss ways to resume the stalled framework talks right after 
the May holidays, but some government officials are speaking of 
difficulty in holding the informal consultations. 
  At his recent meeting with Prime Minister Hata (then deputy 
prime minister and foreign minister), U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor set three conditions for resuming the stalled 
framework talks which include: 1) macroeconomic policy; 2) 
agreement between the two countries on holding talks to discuss 
ways to expand Japan's imports; and 3) establishment of 
objective criteria. 
  The backbone of the macroeconomic policy is the continued 
income tax reduction, and at a 24 April meeting between the 
Japanese and U.S. finance ministers, Japan explained to the 
United States that Japan would continue the income tax reduction 
after 1995. 
  The Japanese Government is examining a sweeping reform of 
the 
current tax system to cut the income tax by lowering the maximum 
tax rate and to raise the consumption tax in order to secure 
financial resources to make up for a fiscal shortfall from cuts 
in the income tax. Many government officials take the view that 
the SDPJ will oppose any attempt to raise the consumption tax 
since it broke away from the coalition (according to the Finance 
Ministry). This development will make it hard for the Japanese 
Government to explain to the U.S. Government in June that it 
intends to seek long-term cuts in the income tax. 
  The government made clear that it would decide how to reform 
the current tax system in June when it announced a package of 
external economic measures in late March, but there is a high 
possibility that if the Hata government remains a minority in 
the Diet, it will be unable to decide on the second package of 
external economic measures. 
  The Hata government would find it difficult to announce any 
new policies concerning deregulation and the expansion of 
government procurement. The Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry points out that "it would be difficult to resume the 
stalled framework talks unless Japan presents the United States 
with its macroeconomic policy." 
  The Japanese Government has studied the possibility of 
sending a vice minister to Washington to present Japan's 
responses to the three conditions laid down by U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor. The Japanese Government, however, 
would be unable to present the U.S. Government with concrete 
plans for tax cuts and the study of how the Japanese Government 
should respond to the two remaining conditions, including the 
establishment of objective criteria, has been delayed, clouding 
prospects for sending the vice minister to Washington. 
  The Finance Ministry takes the view that the "U.S. 
Government 
will not make rash moves to resume the stalled framework talks 
because of its need to watch how Japan's political situation 
will develop." Things are not likely to go according to the 
Japanese Government's scenario, which aims to reach an agreement 
with the U.S. Government on the resumption of the stalled 
framework talks prior to the July Japan-U.S. summit talks.

<F P=106> [Article by freelance journalist Yoshiko Sakurai: "The </F>
Indiscretion of Senior SDPJ Members Who Attended the Party Held 
in Celebration of Kim Il-song's Birthday and the Suspicion 
Thrown on Them"] 
  [Text] The 13th of April was a beautiful spring day. On 
that evening at Fujimi-cho in the Chiyoda Ward of Tokyo, many 
people were seen riding up to the central building of the 
pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan. 
This was because the General Association held a celebration two 
days before Kim Il-song's birthday. 
  Many members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] 
attended. At least 17 SDPJ members were present, including 
Takako Doi, the former SDPJ chairwoman and incumbent speaker of 
the House of Representatives; Tomiichi Murayama, the incumbent 
SDPJ chairman; Makoto Tanabe, also a former SDPJ chairman; 
Hajime Fukada, director of the SDPJ Organization Bureau; and 
Yuzuru Shimazaki. 
  It stands to reason that the SDPJ would send some members to 
the party held in celebration of Kim Il-song's birthday because 
of its friendly relations with the North Korean Workers' Party. 
  Nevertheless, when we look at the members who attended the 
party, we see how singular the SDPJ is. 
  The international situation surrounding North Korea is 
extremely tense. Even China, which is North Korea's last major 
ally and which had previously shown its intention to veto any 
resolution of the United Nations Security Council to impose 
sanctions against North Korea, took a step backward. This year 
it refrained from sending a delegation to Pyongyang to attend 
festivities held in celebration of Kim Il-song's birthday. By 
making such a decision, China has clearly indicated to North 
Korea that neither China nor the international community can 
accept North Korea's persistent refusal to accept complete 
international inspections of its suspected nuclear sites. 
  The Japanese Government went one step further than China, 
saying it will do "what it can within the constitutional 
framework" if the UN Security Council decides to impose economic 
sanctions against North Korea. In other words, the Japanese 
Government has decided to present a firm front, basically in 
accordance with the United Nations. 
  Despite such circumstances, the chairman of the largest 
party 
in the ruling coalition attended a celebration of Kim Il-song's 
birthday on his own initiative. I do not appreciate this 
conduct. The presence of Hajime Fukada and Yuzuru Shimazaki at 
the party is somewhat understandable, since Fukada is known to 
have been nicknamed "North Korean ambassador to Japan" by other 
SDPJ members and Shimazaki is noted as an ardent admirer of Kim 
Il-song--he once called the North Korean leader "the greatest 
politician in the world." However, Tomiichi Murayama's position 
is totally different from theirs because he is the party 
chairman and simultaneously the leader of the largest coalition 
member. 
  The same can be said of Takako Doi. As the speaker of the 
House of Representatives, she represents the highest authority 
on national rights. She also stands on top of the three powers 
of administration, legislation, and judicature. Therefore, 
every move she makes has great significance politically. 
  I was not just surprised at the news that Murayama and Doi 
acted on their own in contradiction to the government's tough 
stance toward North Korea; their behavior raises suspicion in my 
mind. 
  It reminded me of the news report that the former Soviet 
Union had been providing monetary aid to the SDPJ. This was 
made public in April 1993. Following the collapse of the Soviet 
Union, a considerable amount of information came out of the 
Kremlin, mostly classified information that would have remained 
secret forever had there been a continuation of one-party rule 
by the Communist Party. 
  There were several secret documents which proved the SDPJ 
had 
received funds from the Soviet Union under the pretext of 
financial aid to promote trade, tourism, and cultural exchange 
between the two countries, and that the SDPJ had used the 
illegal money as campaign funds. The following names were 
clearly mentioned in the documents: Masashi Ishibashi, former 
SDPJ chairman; Akira Iwai, former head of the General Council of 
Trade Unions of Japan; and Kanji Kawasaki, a senior member of 
the SDPJ. They all strongly denied involvement. However, 
although it has been a full year since these facts were made 
public, it seems they have not yet provided any information or 
documents to prove their innocence. Therefore, the SDPJ still 
lies under strong suspicion that it had financial dealings with 
the former Soviet Union. In other words, the SDPJ had taken a 
pro-Soviet line, while receiving financial support from the 
communist country. Now the SDPJ takes a pro-Pyongyang policy. 
Did the same factor which induced the SDPJ to adopt a 
pro-Soviet line again come into play in the process? We can 
hardly offer a negative answer to that question. 
  To be specific, the point at issue is the relationship 
between the SDPJ and the General Association of Korean Residents 
in Japan, which is the virtual North Korean mission to Japan. 
  There was always some talk that several SDPJ members have 
received political funds from companies affiliated with the 
General Association. I truly wish it were not true, but 
unfortunately what happened once might happen twice. Moreover, 
although the SDPJ claims to be in favor of a United 
Nations-oriented diplomacy, it neglects the party platform when 
dealing with matters related to North Korea. Contrary to the UN 
will, the SDPJ has called for a soft stance towards North Korea. 
Furthermore, amid the political turmoil caused by the tense 
deadlock over whom to choose as successor to Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, several senior members did not hesitate at 
all to attend the party held in celebration of Kim Il-song's 
birthday. All these moves cannot but provoke stronger suspicion 
in my mind.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] will relax the current safety standard and certification 
system for commercial electrical goods. MITI will reduce the 
number of items subject to the "government certification system" 
which makes it mandatory for the government to check whether 
commercial electrical goods meet the safety standard and expand 
a "self-certification system" which leaves the makers of 
commercial electrical goods free to manufacture them if their 
goods are found to meet the government-set safety standard. MITI 
plans to allow about 100 items including washing machines be 
manufactured under the new self-certification system. MITI 
intends to put the new self-certification system into effect 
within this year after concluding that technological progress 
has reduced the danger of accidents. MITI intends to take these 
measures to help Japanese enterprises lighten their burdens and 
make it easy for foreign firms to gain access to the Japanese 
market. Nonetheless, Japanese enterprises will take greater 
responsibility for the safety of their goods. 
  Currently, the Consumer Goods Safety Law sets the safety 
standard for passenger helmets and other goods, whereas the 
government sets the safety standard for commercial electrical 
goods including gas appliances. Hence, no Japanese makers are 
allowed to manufacture and sell their commercial electric goods 
unless their goods meet the safety standard. To manufacture and 
sell commercial electric goods under the self-certificate 
system, makers are required to file their registrations with 
MITI and then to obtain model certificates from the Japan 
Electric Goods Research Institute and other 
government-designated research institutes after passing MITI's 
on-site inspection of their plants. 
  At the present, 282 commercial electrical goods items are 
subject to the government certification system. MITI plans to 
apply the self-certificate system to about one hundred 
commercial electrical items, whose manufacturers guarantee that 
those commercial electrical goods meet the government-set safety 
standard. The Electrical Goods Safety Study Panel (an advisory 
body for chief of the Public Utilities Department in the Agency 
of Natural Resources and Energy) will hold a meeting in July to 
compile a list of specific commercial electrical goods which can 
be manufactured under the self-certification system. 
  Such gas appliances as gas bathroom heating valves, 
gas-heated pressure pans and pots will be kept under the 
government certification system. MITI, however, will study the 
possibility of shifting the government certification system to 
the self-certification system for other consumer gas appliances 
including gas hot water heaters. The Consumer Goods Safety Law 
puts six items such as passenger helmets, baby beds, pressure 
pots and roller skates under the government certification 
system, but MITI will study the possibility of shifting them to 
the self-certification system. 
  The "safety standard and certification system in Japan is 
complex and the system has been criticized by other nations as 
Japan's nontariff barrier." Preparations for enactment of the 
property liability law have made headway and a system is being 
created whereby consumers are kept from suffering damages from 
defective goods. MITI has decided to increase the number of 
electrical consumer goods that can be manufactured under the 
self-certification system with those developments taken into 
consideration. The relaxation of the government safety standard 
and certification system will be incorporated in another package 
of external economic measures that the government will map out 
in June this year.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 27 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The leader 
of the Mongolian Democratic Association (MDA) T. Elbegdorj held 
a press conference concerning the results of the completed 
yesterday in the capital of Mongolia political hunger strike. 
The action which lasted from 13 April to 25 pursued the purpose 
of resignation of the present premier and his team. About 41 
people altogether were taking part in the hunger strike 
representing a number of democratic public organizations. 
  The main reason for such a immense pressure on the part of 
the opposition lies in the corruptiveness of the highest 
echelons of power as is being proclaimed by the democratic 
forces and disability of the government to cope with its own 
programme and the social economic problems as well. 
  Answering the direct question by a correspondent about 
whether it should be considered as a defeat the fact that though 
the action is ceased whereas the prime minister is preserving 
his post T. Elbegdorj said that the struggle for the resignation 
of the government is facing a new stage acquiring new forms. 
Parallel with this he criticized the president saying that the 
position of the president and his environment was unclear and 
equivocal. 
  During the course of the action the public of the country 
had 
been provided with the possibilities to have the true notion 
formed concerning the incumbent government which has not any 
more moral and ethical rights to guide the country. The 
government is steeped in the corruption and we sure that we 
would be supported widely by the public stressed the leader of 
the MDA in conclusion.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 27 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The number 
of needy people in Mongolia is over 587 thousand people as of 
today and some 137 thousand of them are referring to the poorest 
strata of the population. This implies that the destitute 
people account for some 26.2 per cent of the total population of 
Mongolia. Such sorrowful figures were quoted at the seminar 
devoted to the theoretical and methodological issues of reducing 
the impoverishment of the population held recently in the 
Mongolian capital. 
  The major topics for discussion during the work of the 
seminar were the issues connected with the struggle against the 
impoverishment, the methods and ways out of it. The 
participants of the seminar have endorsed the recommendations on 
the issues under discussion. 
  Where it was noted in particular, that it is necessary to 
pursue by the state and governmental bodies of an efficient 
policy at macro level referring to the improvement of labour 
provision, creation of the fund against the impoverishment and 
prompt introduction of a pension insurance system.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 26 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The Vice 
Minister of Infrastructure Development T. Damiran said in his 
interview to the governmental newspaper "DZASGIYN GADZRYN MEUEE" 
that in the current year it is scheduled to allot some 6 billion 
tugrik for capital investment in the sphere of construction at 
the expense of the state centralized budget. This sum is 
exceeding by 2 billion tugrik the last year's ones. T. Damiran 
noted that including the means of aimags' budgets, enterprises 
and economic entities privately-owned the total volume of 
capital investment in the construction constitutes this year 
some 16 billion tugrik. At the same time the vice minister 
underscored that the growing amount of capital investment should 
be understood in connection with the inflation that is to say 
the actual volume of construction is not to exceed the last 
year's taking into consideration all the means allotted it is 
expected that more than 500 objects are to be made available in 
the current year. As was informed by the vice minister, at 
present in the sphere of construction there are working some 20 
thousand qualified construction workers and additionally some 15 
thousand seasonal ones. In accordance with the contracts 
concluded there are about one thousand Russian workers engaged 
in the construction sphere as well. According to the latest 
statistics, there were about 60 thousand qualified workers 
engaged in the construction industry of Mongolia up to 1990.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 27 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- According 
to the Ministry of Food and Agriculture the preparations for the 
spring sowing campaign of the year 1994 are slowing down. As of 
today just about 4864 percent [figure as received] of the 
agricultural equipment and machineries are ready for 
exploitation. 
  Moreover in many farms of the Bayanulgii and Bayanhongor 
Aimags in the western part of Mongolia the repairing of such 
techniques and machineries is not being started yet. The delay 
in repairing tractors, combines and other agricultural 
machineries is connection with the lack of spare parts and 
financial difficulties.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 27 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
central Mongolian press give a wide coverage to the cessation of 
the political hunger strike called by the Mongolian Democratic 
Association and the Union of Mongolian Students demanding the 
resignation of the government as having failed to fulfill its 
obligations referring to the preelection programme. Prior to 
this the supporters of the government had decided to stop the 
hunger strike as well according to the newspaper, the Great 
State Hural of the country has considered the issue regarding 
the above mentioned events and took certain decisions relating 
to the regulation of the current situation arisen. The 
newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs that the parliament has passed a 
decision in association with the demands of the participants of 
the recent political actions and charging the government to work 
out and submit for consideration by the Great State Hural the 
draft laws concerning the ethical standards of activities for 
the top-ranking persons of position, the freedom of press, the 
procedure of carrying out mass meetings and demonstrations. 
  The newspaper reports that the spring session holding 
currently of the Great State Hural has discussed in first 
reading the draft Law on Civil Defence. The newspaper points 
out that the members of the parliament have agreed with the 
necessity for the Civil Defence Service to be headed by the 
prime minister. 
  The newspaper publishes an interview of its correspondent 
with the deputy head of the National Development Department L. 
Demberel. He said in his interview about the assistance and 
credits from international financial and economic organizations 
and foreign countries granted to the country for the purpose of 
overcoming the economic difficulties related to the transition 
to market relations. The newspaper provides the specified data 
concerning the economic assistance and credits of the 
international organizations and foreign countries. 
  The governmental newspaper "DZASGIYN GADZRYN MEUEE" 
publishes 
the full text of the political agreement arrived at between the 
parties holding seats in the parliament. The agreement was 
reached with the participation of the president of the country 
P. Ochirbat. The Great State Hural has called upon the 
participants of the political hunger strike demanding the 
resignation of the government to stop their action. The 
newspaper also provides the information of the governmental 
press office about the statement by the Prime Minister P. Jasray 
concerning the demands by the participants of the rallies and 
hunger strikes held recently. The prime minister stressed that 
the people should not doubt that the government would resign in 
accordance with the provisions of the law. He charged the 
citizens to exert all their powers in creative labour.

sow about 20 thousand hectares and much attention, the newspaper 
notes is to be paid to the horticulture. 
  The observer of the newspaper is standing against the 
opinion 
by a number of scholars who are against the introduction of the

business keeping. He notes in his respect that during the last 
years in the country has been arranged immense preparatory work 
for teaching the Mongolian script to the population. 
  The newspaper also carries some excerpts from the 
governmental newspaper "DZASGIYN GADZRYN MEUEE" which stresses 
that the Mongolian script was proclaimed to be the official 
script of the state as early as the days of the Ghengis Khan.

implementation 
of the decision of the government on intensifying the work on 
preparations for keeping all the Mongolian official documentary 
and business on the Mongolian script.

"US Banks on Power of Bullyboy Tactics"] 
  [Text] With the collapse of communism as a political 
ideology whose universalist aspirations were backed by the once 
formidable military, political and financial power of the former 
Soviet Union, the familiar parameters of the Cold War 
disappeared. 
  In fact, if not in theory, not only in Russia -- the core of 
the former union -- but in the newly independent republics into 
which the union had broken up, the old Soviet apparatchiks were 
still effectively in power. 
  The only difference was that, for the purpose of public 
relations, they had conveniently transformed themselves from 
communists into "nationalists". Free-market experts from the 
West solemnly enjoined on them the necessity of privatising 
State property. 
  They were preaching to the converted. The apparatchiks 
"privatised" large chunks of Soviet property -- by stealing 
them! They "bought" them at knock-down prices, put the ownership 
into their own names, and often sold them to western interests. 
  Well aware of what runaway inflation at home would do to the 
proceeds, they generally insisted on being paid in dollars, 
which they proceeded to invest in banks that protected their 
anonymity -- mainly in Switzerland and Lichtenstein. Even the 
Italian Mafia was brought into the picture. 
  Now, however, the honeymoon is over. In order to reinforce 
their personal positions the new leaders -- still, in general, 
old-time communists -- are playing the nationalist card even 
more strongly attempting to steal the political clothes of 
Vladimir Zhirinovsky by reassembling the former Soviet States 
into a new Russian dominated federation. States like Belarus, 
Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Moldavia, and the three Central 
Asian republics are already "in the bag", with the future of 
Ukraine still to be determined. Even Poland and Lithuania, 
while clearly outside the bag, have re-elected old-time 
communists to office. 
  It is no longer the ghosts of Lenin and Stalin that hover 
uneasily on the political horizon. It is the more traditional 
Russian figures of Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great. 
  To believe that the United States -- the only remaining 
genuine superpower -- is on top of the problems which, with the 
effluxion of time, will inevitably result from these 
developments, would be an illusion. President Clinton himself 
clearly has little time to devote to anything other than his own 
-- and his wife's -- personal problems, as his Republican 
opponents gradually tighten the noose, seek to revenge 
themselves for Nixon and Watergate, and to lay the foundations 
for a future Republican victory. 
  In appointing Strobe Talbott as Assistant Secretary of State 
(for Russian affairs) Clinton has handed the control of the US's 
Russian policy to one who believes that the US's exertions in 
the Cold War were profoundly mistaken, and that the Soviet Union 
was more sinned against than sinning. 
  The military power of the US -- which, whether or not it is 
guided by any consistent political vision, is overwhelming -- is 
concentrated on three regions: northeastern Asia; Latin 
America; and the Middle East. 
  In relation to Latin America, the US has successfully 
reasserted the Monroe Doctrine. In relation to north-eastern 
Asia, the developing conflict between North and South Korea is 
finally directed to the safety of Japan. In the Middle East, 
the issue is American control of Saudi Arabia's oil supplies. 
The purpose of the Gulf War was to provide a formula to enable 
the US to base its military forces and equipment in Saudi Arabia. 
  What other objectives remain within the framework of US 
foreign policy today? One is tempted to say "not many". There 
is, however, more to it than that. 
  The US will have won few friends with what is little short 
of 
outright bullying in the cases of China and Japan. These 
ancient societies do not respond to public humiliation. 
  In relation to China, the pretence that the US is seriously 
concerned about the "human rights" of Chinese citizens deceives 
no one. China has had at least 500,000 political prisoners for 
decades. There are reportedly about 20 million ordinary 
prisoners in labour camps, whose unpaid slave labour supplies 
one of the main foundations of China's allegedly booming 
economy. The US has observed these permanent factors of Chinese 
society with equanimity for many years. Why the sudden outbreak 
of moral concern? 
  With the Japanese, it is the familiar indignation with 
Japan's "inaccessible" markets, dimmed only temporarily by the 
deal with Motorola and with the foreign rice-growers. 
  Despite Japanese trade barriers, Germany has succeeded in 
exporting more cars to Japan than Japan exports to Germany. 
Japanese trade barriers cannot be as tight as all that. Why 
then the constant beating of the nationalist drum against Japan? 
  Last Wednesday [30 March] week, the US Treasury Secretary, 
Lloyd Bentsen, delivered an under-reported address in New York. 
He stated that the key objective of US policy over the next two 
years would be to enforce full access by American banks and 
other financial institutions into all leading countries. The US 
would be prepared, he said, to retaliate against countries which 
refused full access to its financial institutions. The presence 
of American banks, he said, was necessary to allow the US to 
share in the prosperity of Asia's markets. 
  Bentsen visited Beijing at the end of January. A joint 
statement was signed by him and China's finance minister Liu 
Zhongli which announced that this year US banks would be 
permitted to establish themselves in China's main cities to 
trade in Chinese currency. The South China Morning Post 
reported in January this was "only on a limited experimental 
basis". Is the hypothetical agitation about "human rights" 
anything more than a cover for the real issue, the accelerated 
entry of American banks to the Chinese mainland? The links 
between the Clinton Democratic administration and the 
controlling groups of the US investment banks are extremely 
close. As chairman of the National Economic Council, Clinton 
chose Robert E. Rubin, who is also co-chairman of Goldman Sachs 
Ltd, one of the most powerful of them all, and not noted for 
representing any interest other than those of its investors. If 
there is more to the foreign policy of the Clinton 
administration than the exclusively financial interest, it 
remains to be explained.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Greg Sheridan from the "Focus" section: </F>
"Australian Eyes On Asian Horizons"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Keating's plan, outlined this week 
in Bangkok, to create a formal fusion between Australia and New 
Zealand and the six tiger economies of the Association of 
South-East Asian Nations is in many ways one of his boldest 
foreign ventures yet -- one full of immense possibilities as 
well as risks for Australia. It represents both a departure in 
Australian trade policy and a seminal commitment specifically to 
South-East Asian future. 
  The ASEAN six -- Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, 
The Philippines, and Brunei -- represent, outside China, the 
most dynamic economies in the world. Keating has proposed 
joining the ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA] to the Closer Economic 
Relations [CER] agreement that exists between Australia and New 
Zealand. This could create a vast free trade area worth $1000 
billion [currency not further specified] a year. 
  The overall size of the South-East Asian economies is still 
relatively small. As Keating pointed out, their combined gross 
national product roughly equals that of Australia and New 
Zealand. But this statistic can be misleading for the fact that 
a far higher proportion of their GNPs goes to international 
trade than ours. 
  Singapore is the world's 18th biggest exporter, while 
Australia is 21st. Indonesia and Thailand rank 26th and 27th 
respectively. 
  Thus the symmetry between Australia-New Zealand and ASEAN is 
really false. As trading economies, ASEAN combined far 
outweighs Australia-New Zealand. And, despite Australia's good 
growth this year (which some estimates put as high as 5 per 
cent) the ASEAN economies will almost certainly grow much faster 
than Australia and New Zealand over the next decade. Moreover, 
we run a substantial trade surplus with all the significant 
South-East Asian economies. Already, there are a bigger market 
for us than either the European or North America. They have 
also shown by far the most rapid growth of any region in the 
world in buying our elaborately transformed manufactures. 
  Therefore we stand to gain far more than ASEAN do from a 
fusion AFTA and the CER. Indeed, it is not clear how practical 
Keating's proposal is in the short term. Its real value 
probably lies in its symbolism, the signals it sends both to 
South-East Asia and more widely about where Australia stands. 
  The reason Australia would gain far more than the ASEAN 
members from an AFTA-CER link lie partly in the different stages 
of development and liberalisation of Australia and the 
South-East Asian economies. Under AFTA, the ASEAN economies are 
pledged to reach a common preferential external tariff on 
manufactured goods of 5 per cent within 15 years. There are 
moves to accelerate this timetable, especially, from Thailand, 
but that is the limit of the existing commitment. 
  Most Australian tariffs, with the exceptions of motor 
vehicles and textiles, are already at or near that level now. 
Certainly, they will be within 15, or even 10 years (10 years 
being the proposed accelerated timetable for AFTA). Moreover, 
each AFTA-country is allowed to nominate temporary exemptions 
from the common tariff and Australia could nominate motor 
vehicles and textiles as its exceptions. Therefore under the 
provisions of the actual AFTA agreement, Australia would not 
have to take any specific actions to qualify for membership. 
  This begs the question of what benefit would be in an 
AFTA-CER link for the ASEAN economies. The answer is, in the 
short term, not much. The most important likely consequence of 
AFTA coming into existence will be to affect international 
investment decisions. Because AFTA will provide them with a 
common South-East Asian market for most manufactured goods, 
multinational companies investing in South-East Asia will have 
an incentive to concentrate their investments in one single 
country, rather than needing to invest in several countries to 
get behind local tariff walls. 
  Australia could be a significant loser in this process as 
even relatively hightech investment could be diverted away from 
Australia and towards South-East Asia. Moreover, Australia has 
a poor record over the past decade of actually investing in 
South-East Asia, as oppose to selling exports there. The 
creation of AFTA will probably make the link between investment 
and trade more important than it is now. For Australia to get 
on the inside of AFTA, therefore, could be immensely valuable. 
  For ASEAN members, the benefit might include that when they 
are selling themselves as investment sites they could more 
clearly point to the bigger combined market including Australia 
and New Zealand. There might also be significant non-tariff area 
of co-operation which could attract members to an association 
with Australia and New Zealand. 
  However, the moves have to be seen in the context of wider 
politics of international trade. There is currently a 
semi-official American proposal for a Pacific Free Trade Area 
including all of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation 
economies. This seems to be completely inconsistent with 
ongoing American trade actions against China and Japan. There 
is also an older American proposal to extend the North American 
Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] across the Pacific, possibly 
starting with Singapore. This deeply worries many Asian 
governments as it offers the potential for the United States to 
pick off Asian countries one by one and get whatever concessions 
it wants on a bilateral basis. 
  At the same time, Malaysia is pushing for its East Asian 
Economic Caucus [EAEC]. America opposes this (rather 
hypocritically, given its support of NAFTA) on the basis that it 
could divide the Pacific, driving America and East Asia apart. 
Australia has opposed it also, originally because we were 
excluded. Recently our friends in South-East Asia have offered 
to deal us in on the EAEC but we have continued to oppose it 
strongly on behalf of the Americans. 
  All of these proposals are swirling through the Pacific at 
the same time as the world is trying to bed down the final 
details of the agreement to conclude the Uruguay Round of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  There is thus great uncertainty and much exploratory 
thinking 
about what kind of trade arrangements are going to dominate the 
Pacific. In part everyone is waiting to see which way America 
jumps, and indeed, if Keating's proposal looks serious, the 
Americans may well be peeved. 
  It may be, however, that some wise heads in South-East Asia 
see the move to join AFTA and CER as a way of making good use of 
Australia's standing with Washington, to use Australia partly as 
a protective shield in trade politics. It has been little 
reported but the US has been harassing some of the best 
performing South-East Asian economies, namely Thailand, Malaysia 
and Indonesia, over what Washington alleges are oppressive 
labour laws. This is regarded in South-East Asia as rank 
hypocrisy and simply America deciding to penalise South-East 
Asia for becoming competitive. It may be that with Australia 
joined fully in an AFTA-CER partnership we can be of some 
assistance in fending off the more brutish American trade 
impulses. 
  However, no one should think securing effective Australian 
membership of AFTA will be easy. The ASEAN-members do not want 
to be dominated by a developed, predominantly Caucasian country. 
Australia's robust political style and use of English tend to 
make it effective, but also quite impatient, in international 
forums. ASEAN diplomacy, although involving very intensive 
processes of dialogue, is much more low key, quiet, 
consensus-seeking -- at times a painfully slow business. ASEAN 
would not want to find itself suddenly dominated by Australia. 
It is very questionable whether Australia could adapt 
adequately to the ASEAN style. 
txt}Singapore has said publicly it has no objections to an 
AFTA-CER link. And it was the Thais who first proposed it. 
Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister, Suphachai Phanitchaphak, last 
November in Melbourne suggested Australia could join both AFTA 
and the EAEC. Indonesia has not publicly opposed the suggestion 
but has said its priority is to bed down AFTA first and it 
doesn't want to move too quickly. 
  But Malaysia has been resolutely against the idea. Some 
Australian officials travelling with Keating briefed the 
travelling press to the effect that Malaysia could be 
enthusiastic about Australia linking up with AFTA. This must 
rate as a postwar high on preposterous wishful thinking, spin 
doctoring and misleading briefing. 
  Malaysia's Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, was asked last 
November to respond to Suphachai's suggestion that Australia 
could join AFTA. He dismissed it out of hand and said: "How 
can a country outside ASEAN join AFTA... unless of course 
Australia becomes a member of ASEAN. Geographically, Australia 
is excluded." 
  There is no doubt Malaysia can exercise a veto on an 
AFTA-CER 
link. This demonstrates once again the foolishness of the row 
Keating got himself into with Mahathir last year and equally the 
foolishness of the view which Keating now seems to hold that 
Australia can effectively ignore Malaysia in its regional 
diplomacy. This is just not true. Certainly, while Australia 
continues to actively oppose Malaysia's EAEC, there is no chance 
of Malaysia allowing us in effect to join AFTA. 
  This is where the risk in Keating's proposal comes in. If 
months and months go by and absolutely nothing happens on 
Keating's initiative, it will be seen to have been mere hot air, 
just more windy Australian blah. And if this happens too often, 
the Prime Minister's word will be significantly devalued. 
  However, the trade minister, Senator Bob McMullan, will, at 
the end of this month, launch a report by the East Asian 
Analytical Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
on the effects of AFTA on Australia and the possibility of an 
AFTA-CER link. It will offer a path forward which will begin 
very modestly with proposals for formal dialogue mechanisms. 
This is probably achievable and will allow Keating to claim 
that some progress is being made. 
  There are two other important dimensions to Keating's 
proposals. Embracing so keenly such a big preferential trading 
arrangement marks a step along the road of Australia apparently 
abandoning its long-held commitment to traditional open 
regionalism, that is, reducing trade barriers on most favoured 
nation basis to everyone whether they are inside the group or 
not. As it is still hard to evaluate what real-world 
consequences Keating's proposals will have, it is difficult to 
know whether this is a departure in substance or just rhetoric. 
The opposition's reaction yesterday was essentially to caution 
against this chance. 
  Second, making the whole proposal in Thailand is important. 
Thailand is Australia's 12th largest export market. Our exports 
there last year grew by an astonishing 50 per cent to $1.2 
billion. Thailand remains one of the fastest growing economies 
in the world. It is a nation of nearly 60 million people. It is 
pivotally placed strategically and a natural entry point to 
Indochina. 
  Paradoxically, because we have had so few problems in our 
relationship with Thailand we have tended to neglect it. It 
does not have the common British colonial experience of Malaysia 
and Singapore, nor is it, like them, a member of the Five Power 
Defence Arrangements, after ANZUS Australia's most important 
military commitment. Nor does it press on the Australian psyche 
in the way the sometimes brooding presence of Indonesia does. 
We have found it culturally distant. But it is an extremely 
important player in ASEAN, and APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation]. It has also paid in its citizens' blood to 
establish a credible democratic system of government. 
  Keating's visit to Thailand was made to overcome partial 
Australian neglect. This is reflected in the formation of a 
Thai-Australian Ministerial Council, like those we have with 
Indonesia and Japan. This is designed in part to spread our 
interests in ASEAN so that the relationship with Indonesia, 
admittedly very good, does not have to carry the full weight of 
our aspirations in South-East Asia. 
  At least since the publication of Garnaut report in 1989, 
Australia has understood the importance of North-East Asia -- 
Japan, the three Chinas and Korea. In this trip Keating has 
made some headway in alerting the nation to the equal importance 
of South-East Asia, even if some of his more ambitious trade 
proposals do not come to pass.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Keating's Mission to Asia"] </F>
  [Text] After the black comedy of Mr Keating's mad 
squabble with the Vietnam veterans, readers will be relieved to 
hear that there was a serious purpose to the Prime Minister's 
visit to Thailand, Laos and Vietnam and that, by all accounts, 
it went quite well. 
  The excuse for the trip was the opening of the Friendship 
Bridge over the Mekong River on the border of Thailand and Laos. 
  The real purpose, however, was to further strengthen 
Australia's relations with two of the most important nations in 
the region. 
  In Australia, the political focus naturally has been on the 
Vietnamese part of the trip because Vietnam is the flavour of 
the month, because of the row with the veterans and because this 
is the first visit by an Australian Prime Minister since the war. 
  However, that should not be allowed to overshadow the 
importance of the visit to Thailand. By far the biggest economy 
on Mr. Keating's itinerary, Thailand is also of growing 
strategic and diplomatic importance to Australia. 
  Economically, diplomatically and militarily, Thailand is a 
major player in ASEAN and a friendly rival of ASEAN's other 
major players, Indonesia and Malaysia. 
  For Australia, that makes Thailand a particularly important 
friend. The Thais' shrewd and predictable diplomacy and their 
distance from Australia mean that Australian-Thai relations tend 
to be more stable than our relations with Malaysia and 
Indonesia. (Curiously, distance does seem to be an important 
factor; for example, Thailand's human rights lapses seem to 
attract less attention here than Indonesia's.) At moments of 
tension between Australia and Malaysia or Indonesia, the Thais 
have interceded on Australia's behalf. 
  Thailand is a longstanding friend and an alternative 
diplomatic and economic "gateway" to the region, always ready to 
accept Australian investment and trade if other countries are 
not so inclined. That, undoubtedly, has a calming effect on 
Australia's relations with its more volatile ASEAN neighbours. 
  With its well-developed defence forces (including 
significant 
naval forces) and its borders with Cambodia and Laos, Thailand 
is also an important player in the development of Cambodia and 
Indo-China. 
  Vietnam's importance is more strategic than economic. 
  Indeed, for all the country's recent growth and long-term 
potential, it will be a small, poor economy for many years to 
come. 
  Strategically, however, it is of enormous potential 
importance in the region, mainly because of its large and 
well-educated population and its border with China. 
  The Chinese are paranoid about Vietnam, which is why they 
spent a fortune to support the Khmer Rouge on Vietnam's 
south-western flank. 
  The central objective of Western policy towards Vietnam must 
be the country's successful economic and political integration 
into the international community. 
  Vietnam needs massive infusions of capital and technology to 
rebuild and expand its basic infrastructure (which is 
insufficient for even its current needs), to develop its rich 
natural resources and to create employment in labour-intensive 
manufacturing. 
  The Vietnamese Communist Party is terrified of the kind of 
political instability that has plagued Eastern Europe, and with 
good reason. Vietnam's young population (the median age is 19) 
means that the labour force is growing at a rate of 1 million a 
year. The rationalisation of inefficient State-owned industries 
means that jobs will be scarce for a good while yet. 
  Australia's policy is both to contribute to Vietnam's 
development and to share in it. 
  As aid projects, Mr Keating's proposed high-profile projects 
-- including a $100 million bridge over the Mekong River and the 
preservation of Hanoi's historic architecture -- sound as 
questionable as the Hawke Government's Friendship Bridge that 
Mr. Keating went to Asia to open. 
  However, Mr Keating obviously expects the political and 
economic benefits to Australia of the projects (in terms of 
goodwill and access of Australian companies to the increasingly 
competitive Vietnamese market) will make up for any shortfall in 
their economic or social value to the Vietnamese people. 
  Of course, other countries are also trying to share in the 
Vietnamese revival. Mr Keating was the sixth leader and the 
14th senior politician to visit Vietnam in a month. 
  For that reason, the importance to the Vietnamese of Mr. 
Keating's visit and offer of aid should not be overestimated. 
  Nevertheless, they undoubtedly represent a significant, 
positive step in the development of Australian-Vietnamese 
relations.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Keating's Bridge to Thailand"] </F>
  [Text] Thailand, the quiet achiever of trade-driven Asia, 
is one of Australia's best friends in the Asia Pacific. 
Virtually without fanfare the Thai people have knuckled down to 
build an industrious economy. Concurrently they have nurtured a 
commitment, fragile but growing, to democratic principles and an 
open society. 
  Bilateral relations with Australia have also grown steadily, 
especially in economic and political terms. Globally the two 
have acted together in common cause, notably as members of the 
Cairns Group pursuing free and open agricultural trade through 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Today these links 
will be celebrated in a highly symbolic fashion when the Prime 
Minister, Mr Keating, formally opens the Australian-funded and 
constructed "Friendship Bridge" spanning the Mekong River 
between Thailand and Laos. 
  The bridge completes a highway network extending for the 
first time from Beijing to Singapore. It has immense economic 
significance, and will entrench Thailand's status as a key 
gateway to Indochina. For Australia, the $42 million [currency 
further not specified] bridge symbolises efforts both in 
strengthening regional links generally and in employing 
Australia's technological capacity for the benefit of the region. 
  Australia and Thailand have often taken their relations too 
much for granted, as officials on both sides of yesterday's 
talks between Mr Keating and his counterpart Chuan Leekpai, 
acknowledged last night. The talks aimed to change that, with 
new perspectives on how to lift bilateral trade and investment. 
  From an Australian perspective Thailand has been the 
neglected power of South-East Asia partly because bilateral 
relations, compared with other parts of the region, have been so 
problem-free and untroubled. Yet it has the second largest 
economy in the Association of South-East Asian Nations. Though 
less than a quarter the size of Australia's, its gross domestic 
product has grown on average 7 per cent every year since the 
1950s. Last year Australian exports to Thailand increased 
nearly 50 percent, to $1.2 billion. This makes it our 12th 
largest export market -- up from 20th only two years previously. 
  Economic success has not come without cost. Most Thai 
industry is centred on Bangkok, which with only 16 percent of 
the population produces half of GDP. Pollution and exploitation 
in the labour market are serious problems. However, the gradual 
rise in prosperity has also created a large and politically 
activist middle class, which has come a metaphor for Thailand's 
capacity to make a lasting transition from military-dominated 
rule to parliamentary democracy. 
  Mr Keating's visit to Laos, Thailand and Vietnam is a 
natural 
and consistent expression in the modern era of what he has 
termed Australia's "constructive engagement" with the region. 
These are not countries of first rank importance in terms of 
Australian foreign policy, but that does not diminish the value 
of regular high-level personal contact. It is 5 years since the 
last prime ministerial visit to Thailand. That was made by Mr 
Bob Hawke, who used the occasion to announce Australia would 
build the bridge Mr Keating is to open today. 
  The importance of Thailand, with a population three times 
more numerous than Australia's, an export economy dominated by 
manufacturing and a stabilising political system, is growing. 
It is an influential force in ASEAN and a keen supporter of the 
Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. As resources-rich 
Thailand prospers, Australia should be confident about ensuring 
bilateral relations flourish along with it.

  [Text] WELLINGTON, April 21 (AFP) -- Foreign minister Don 
McKinnon said Thursday he was reluctant to send New Zealand 
troops to join the United Nations in Bosnia because on the two 
previous occasions New Zealand forces had gone to war in Europe 
this century they had taken "enormous losses". 
  On Wednesday, Prime Minister Jim Bolger said the government 
would be prepared to send troops, but there would be no hasty 
decisions and any contribution to UN forces would be "very 
modest". 
  Three New Zealand soldiers are currently with UN forces in 
Bosnia. 
  He told reporters the UN had [word indistinct] for about 
10,000 troops from its member nations and so far 3,500 had been 
committed. 
  "They will be coming back for the remainder of the 10,000. 
New Zealand has of course been included in that general call for 
troops." 
  But in Japan, McKinnon told Radio New Zealand he did not 
support sending New Zealand troops to fight in a civil war in 
Bosnia, but saw a future role for them as peacekeepers. 
  "I said more than a year ago when this question was raised 
that I would be very reluctant to recommend to my cabinet 
colleagues that New Zealand commit itself to another land war in 
Europe," he said. "We've been there twice in this century, we've 
taken enormous losses in that time. " 
  McKinnon said he was more concerned about New Zealand 
playing 
its role as current president of the UN Security Council to 
establish a settlement. 
  "Ultimately that may mean a request for peacekeeping troops; 
that's quite a different exercise," he said. "But (at the 
moment) we are in between. We haven't got peace; we've still got 
a civil war there." 
  McKinnon said he believed New Zealanders did not really want 
to see New Zealand troops there fighting a war. 
  New Zealand suffered heavy casualites during both world wars 
this century.

Comrade Kim Chong-il received letters of thanks from the senior 
vice-president of the U.S. CNN and the Japanese NHK news 
coverage group that had visited Korea with former heads of state 
and government and politicians of different countries. 
  The letters dated April 19 expressed sincere thanks to 
Comrade Kim Chong-il for inviting them to visit and report on 
the DPRK. 
  Senior Vice-President of the U.S. CNN Eason Jordan in his 
letter of thanks said; "Our visit was extremely successful, 
especially our meeting and coverage of President Kim Il-song. 
We owe a great debt of gratitude to you". 
  He hoped that through coverage and report the CNN has made 
some contribution to international understanding of Korea and to 
the cause of world peace and laid the groundwork for a long-term 
and positive relationship with Korea. 
  The letter expressed once again thanks to consideration and 
support of Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  The Japanese NHK news coverage group in the letter of thanks 
said that the invitation of the NHK coverage group representing 
Japan and CNN coverage group representing the United States 
under the present rigorous situation surrounding the Korean 
peninsula today was made by the wise decision of Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. 
  The letter continues: 
  As the old saying goes, "seeing is believing." The true 
looks 
of the DPRK which no one can know without visiting it and 
meeting people have been conveyed to the world, I believe. 
  NHK will in the future, too, make efforts for the 
improvement 
of the DPRK-Japan relations and for peace and prosperity of 
Northeast Asia on the basis of the deep cooperative relations 
with the DPRK hitherto. 
  The letter hoped that Comrade Kim Chong-il would understand 
such a stance of report of NHK and give guidance for the 
establishment of eternal relations between NHK and the DPRK. It 
sincerely wished President Kim Il-song and Secretary Kim 
Chong-il good health and a long life.

<F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Replacement of Fuel Rod </F>
of Experimental Nuclear Power Station" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
answered a question put by KCNA today regarding the planned 
replacement of fuel rod of the 5 megawatt experimental nuclear 
power station in the DPRK. 
  He said: 
  We will soon begin the replacement of the fuel rod according 
to the operation plan of the 5 megawatt experimental nuclear 
power station for the present as part of the undertakings for 
the normalization of our peaceful nuclear activities. 
  As we pointed out already on April 4, we are not in a 
position to freeze the operation of our graphite moderated 
reactor system for an indefinite period since the implementation 
of the DPRK-USA agreement on the conversion of our graphite 
moderated nuclear reactor system into a light water system has 
become uncertain as a result of the abortion of the third round 
of DPRK-USA talks and, moreover, the prospect of the resumption 
of the DPRK-USA talks is dim at present. 
  In view of technical requirements, too, we can no longer 
delay the replacement of fuel rod of the 5 megawatt experimental 
nuclear power station. 
  Consistent is our stand to show the honesty of our nuclear 
activities, although the replacement of the fuel rod is being 
made while we are still in a unique status following the 
temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  Hence, we decided to voluntarily notify the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] of our plan for the replacement of 
fuel rod and, especially, to allow inspectors of the IAEA to 
observe the process of replacement of the fuel rod so that they 
may verify that nuclear materials are not diverted to 
non-peaceful purposes, and promptly issued entry visas to the 
inspectors as requested by the agency. 
  Observation activities of the agency may involve adequate 
contents of inspection for the continuity of safeguards, 
including observation of the activities for the replacement of 
fuel rod, measurement of all the fuel by the spent fuel rod 
counter, containment and surveillance of all the replaced fuel 
by the agency, activities related to the agency's seal and 
monitoring apparatuses and examination of documents of operating 
and accounting records. 
  This shows that we are actively guaranteeing inspection 
activities of the agency with the utmost leniency and good will 
despite our unique status. 
  If inspection activities falling within the scope of routine 
and ad hoc inspections are raised in the course of the 
replacement of the fuel rod, they may be allowed after the 
nuclear issue is settled in a package deal at future DPRK-U.S. 
talks. 
  Truth to tell, we intended to discuss first the resumption 
of 
routine and ad hoc inspections within the framework of a package 
solution to the nuclear issue at the third round of DPRK-U.S. 
talks. 
  But we remain in a unique status with the abortion of the 
third round of talks. At this transitional stage observation of 
the replacement of the fuel rod cannot but be the inspection for 
the continuity of safeguards to verify non- diversion of nuclear 
materials. 
  We will leave the fuel rod to be replaced this time strictly 
under the containment and surveillance of the IAEA and fully 
provide the continuity of safeguards data. 
  We are studying the problem of "additional inspection" of 
the 
radiochemical laboratory raised during the March inspection

the United States and the IAEA Secretariat. 
  Hence, we have already notified them that we are willing to 
allow an "additional inspection" as an exception after examining 
their future behavior in keeping with the change of the current 
situation surrounding the exchange of special envoys between the 
North and South. 
  If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat, ignoring our 
good will, rudely demand sampling and other inspection 
activities in disregard of our unique status at the time of the 
replacement of the fuel rod, we will have to regard it as a 
sinister political intention to continue more openly the 
campaign for stifling the DPRK over its peaceful nuclear 
activities. 
  When an irrevocable complex situation is created by that, we 
cannot hold ourselves responsible for it at all. 
  If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat respect our 
unique status and take a fair attitude and position, looking 
straight at the current situation, another opportunity of 
finding a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue will be 
created.

<F P=106> ["Fuel Rod of Experimental Nuclear Power Station To Be </F>
Replaced in DPRK" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- According to a 
spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea, the DPRK will soon begin the replacement of 
the fuel rod according to the operation plan of the 5 megawatt 
experimental nuclear power station for the present as part of 
the undertakings for the normalization of our peaceful nuclear 
activities. 
  Answering a question put by KCNA today, the spokesman said: 
  Consistent is our stand to show the honesty of our nuclear 
activities, although the replacement of the fuel rod is being 
made while we are still in a unique status following the 
temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  Hence, we decided to voluntarily notify the International 
Atomic Energy Agency of our plan for the replacement of fuel rod 
and, especially, to allow inspectors of the IAEA to observe the 
process of replacement of the fuel rod so that they may verify 
that nuclear materials are not diverted to non-peaceful 
purposes, and promptly issued entry visas to the inspectors as 
requested by the agency. 
  If inspection activities falling within the scope of routine 
and ad hoc inspections are raised in the course of the 
replacement of the fuel rod, they may be allowed after the 
nuclear issue is settled in a package deal at future DPRK-U.S. 
talks. 
  We will leave the fuel rod to be replaced this time strictly 
under the containment and surveillance of the IAEA and fully 
provide the continuity of safeguards data. 
  We are studying the problem of "additional inspection" of 
the 
radiochemical laboratory raised during the March inspection 
activities of the IAEA in close relations with the attitude of 
the United States and the IAEA Secretariat. 
  Hence, we have already notified them that we are willing to 
allow an "additional inspection" as an exception after examining 
their future behavior in keeping with the change of the current 
situation surrounding the exchange of special envoys between the 
North and South. 
  If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat, ignoring our 
good will, rudely demand sampling and other inspection 
activities in disregard of our unique status at the time of the 
replacement of the fuel rod, we will have to regard it as a 
sinister political intention to continue more openly the 
campaign for stifling the DPRK over its peaceful nuclear 
activities. 
  When an irrevocable complex situation is created by that, we 
cannot hold ourselves responsible for it at all. 
  If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat respect our 
unique status and take a fair attitude and position, looking 
straight at the current situation, another opportunity of 
finding a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue will be 
created.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 26 (KCNA) -- Yi Song-ho, acting 
chairman of the C.C. [Central Committee], the DPRK Red Cross 
Society, in a telephone message to Kang Yong-hun, president of 
the South Korean Red Cross today, strongly urged that if the 
South Korean Red Cross is really interested in the solution of 
the humanitarian issue, it should return to the original stand 
of the Red Cross, though belatedly, and show an affirmative 
response to the North side's just demand for the repatriation of 
Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, prisoners of war. 
  Recalling that the South Korean Red Cross in its telephone 
message dated April 22 denied Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan being 
prisoners of war, the message contends that, according to the 
Hague Convention on the articles and practices of war of 1907 
and the August 12, 1949, Geneva Convention on the treatment of 
POWs, they who were active as guerrillas (militiamen) during the 
Korean war are, strictly speaking, prisoners of war and so they 
should naturally be treated as such. 
  Refuting the South side's argument that Kim and Ham are 
"criminals who murdered innocent people", the message says they 
are patriots who fought with arms in hand against foreign 
aggressors and the reactionary ruling quarters and traitors of 
South Korea. 
  As far as their "acquisition of (South Korean) nationality" 
is concerned, they did so to eke out existence because the South 
Korean side detained them, not sending them back, notes the 
message. 
  It says: 
  "Moreover, your side came up with the `separated families 
issue'", the questions of the return of crewmen of the ship 
`Tongjin', the resumption of Red Cross talks and other issues 
that have nothing to do with the repatriation of Kim In-so and 
Ham Se-hwan. This is a far-fetched argument prompted by its 
intention to refuse our just request for their repatriation. 
  "All the issues raised by your side in the telephone message 
this time have nothing to do with the repatriation of Kim In-so 
and Ham Se-hwan. Yet, your side is trying to refuse our just 
request by connecting them with it in a far-fetched way even 
through the fabrication of things. This cannot be viewed as an 
honest stand of the Red Cross men." 
  The telephone message says the South side must realize that 
such act is contrary to the idea of the Red Cross 
humanitarianism, an act manipulated by the authorities seeking 
North-South confrontation.

<F P=106> ["South Side's Authorities Urged To Accept North's Proposal </F>
for National Conference" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- The preparatory 
committee for the formation of the South side headquarters of 
the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification 
(Pomminnyon) strongly urged the South side authorities to accept 
the proposal for the convocation of a national conference, a 
proposal initiated by the DPRK at a joint meeting of its 
government, political parties and public organizations on April 
11 with a view to finding a way of achieving the great unity of 
the whole nation. 
  In a document distributed on April 15 it charged that the 
Kim 
Yong-sam "government" deepened the national division by refusing 
even to accept the proposal of the North, without so much as 
showing an attitude to sincerely examine it. 
  Noting that the crisis of the nation cannot be defused, nor 
can the way of an independent and peaceful reunification of the 
country be opened by such mode of dependence on outside forces 
as "South Korea-U.S.-Japan cooperation", the document stressed 
the only way is to activate diverse dialogues of all levels 
including dialogue between the government authorities and thus 
boost the sentiments of great national unity and find an 
independent solution. 
  It repeatedly urged the South Korean authorities to accept 
the proposal of the North for a national conference.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Resignation of S. Korean `PM'" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- Yi Hoe-chang a few 
days ago tendered his resignation as "prime minister [PM]" of 
South Korea four months after his appointment and Kim Yong-sam 
immediately endorsed it. 
  NODONG SINMUN today views his resignation as a virtual 
dismissal by the traitor Kim Yong-sam who hated his recent acts 
and words as a "challenge to the presidential authority." 
  His recent acts and words in question are that Yi Hoe-chang 
"attempted to control the state affairs" by ordering the 
participants in a "coordinating meeting on the policy of 
reunification and security" to report the results of the meeting 
before implementing them. The meeting was held with the 
participation of "Chongwadae [presidential office]" clan and 
"cabinet ministers" concerned, but in his absence. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The power struggle erupted because both the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam and the "prime minister" were captives to greed for 
"government power." 
  South Korea is a virtual colony of the United States, so the 
"president" Kim Yong-sam cannot make a "policy" at his will. 
This being the fact, it is foolish of the "prime minister" to 
try to lead the "administration". 
  Yi Hoe-chang's lot is the unavoidable fate of a colonial 
puppet. 
  Anyhow, it is obvious that the dismissal of the "prime 
minister" is a product of the crisis of the "civilian 
government" of South Korea. 
  It is one year or more since the emergence of the Kim 
Yong-sam regime but the third "prime minister" has to be 
appointed now. How long will this unstable home be maintained? 
  Shouts for "down with Kim Yong-sam" are growing louder 
outdoors and the power struggle is getting more serious indoors. 
This is a sign of the collapse of the "civilian government."

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique have started the "Hwarang" military exercise with 
the mobilization of the puppet army, police and reserve forces, 
more than 1,300,000 in all, crying over the non-existent "threat 
from the North." 
  NODONG SINMUN today says this reveals again their 
treacherous 
nature in seeking only confrontation and war. 
  The analyst says: 
  A grave situation has been created on the Korean peninsula 
by 
the war moves of the United States and the South Korean puppets. 
  While visiting South Korea, U.S. Defense Secretary William 
Perry was closeted with the puppets to examine war preparations 
and declared that the "Team Spirit" nuclear manoeucres would be 
resumed in November. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique frequently stage provocative 
war games of the puppet army including operations for breaking 
through the Military Demarcation Line. Recently, they checked 
the reserve ammunition. 
  It is obvious that the "Hwarang" is motivated by a sinister 
intention to drive not only the puppet army but also 
para-military forces and inhabitants into war manoeuvres against 
the North. 
  Through the military exercise, the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
clique 
are seeking to divert the attention of the people elsewhere, 
save the crisis and justify their policy of confrontation and 
war. 
  But the days of traitorous regime, estranged by the nation, 
are numbered.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- The Korean people 
extend militant greetings and solidarity to all the 
revolutionary people of the world, renewing their revolutionary 
resolution to steadily defend the cause of socialism, the human 
cause of independence, from the counterrevolutionary offensive 
of the international reactionaries, develop it and remain loyal 
to it, on the lapse of two years since the historical Pyongyang 
declaration "Let Us Defend and Advance the Cause of Socialism" 
was published on April 20, 1992, says NODONG SINMUN in a signed 
article today. 
  The article notes: 
  The Pyongyang declaration was signed by 70 political parties 
of the world at the time of its adoption but, in two years, the 
number of the signers has reached 213. As this figure shows, 
the declaration has evoked warm support and deep sympathy 
among the world's revolutionary people to be accepted as an 
action programme for the cause of socialism, the human cause of 
independence. 
  Touching on its great attraction and invincible vitality, 
the 
paper says: 
  A dynamic movement is going on in all parts of the world at 
present to defend and advance the cause of socialism in the 
spirit and idea of the Pyongyang declaration. 
  The propaganda of the imperialists and bourgeois 
restorationists about the mistaken socialist idea and "collapse" 
of socialism is a sheer sophism and it is nothing but a trick to 
embellish reactionary capitalism which has no future and 
maintain the old order of domination and subjugation. 
  It is not socialism but imperialism and revived capitalism 
which are nearing their downfall in a grave crisis. 
  As socialism has to cover an untrodden path hewn by mankind, 
there may be turns and twists and trials in the course of its 
advancement, but it is a historical necessity that it emerges 
victorious for its truth, validity and vitality. 
  The victory of the cause of socialism can not be expected 
without a common struggle of the world's revolutionary people. 
  What is important here is that the revolutionary parties and 
people should keep to independence and strengthen the driving 
forces. 
  As socialism is pioneered and built by the national state as 
a unit, the cause of socialism in each country should be 
undertaken and carried out by its party and people, being the 
masters of it. 
  To keep faith in and principle of socialism is an essential 
condition and an important guarantee for defending and 
developing the cause of socialism. 
  Today when the international reactionaries are challenging 
socialism with an allied force, it is more necessary for all the 
forces aspiring after socialism to firmly unite and cooperate 
with each other. 
  The Korean people will fight vehemently to smash the anti- 
socialist offensive of the international reactionary forces and 
achieve the progress and final victory of the cause of 
socialism, in close solidarity with the world's revolutionary 
people.

dear leader, and the Workers' Party of Korea in the publication 
of the Pyongyang declaration which opened up a new phase for the

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- The second anniversary 
of the publication of the Pyongyang declaration "Let Us Defend 
and Advance the Cause of Socialism" was observed in Peru and 
Russia. 
  The declaration was adopted in April 1992 by leaders and 
representatives of political parties advocating socialism who 
came to Pyongyang to celebrate the 80th birthday of the great 
leader President Kim Il-song. 
  Genaro Ledesma Izquieta, chairman of the People's Front of 
Workers, Peasants and Students of Peru, made a speech at a 
meeting held at the front on April 13. 
  He said it is only two years since the adoption of the 
Pyongyang declaration, but more than 200 parties have signed it 
and its vitality is growing day by day. 
  "The Pyongyang declaration, which clarified the superiority 
of socialism to capitalism, the inevitability of the victory of 
socialism and the tasks and ways of defending and advancing 
socialism, has served as a weapon for the socialists in their 
struggle," he said, adding that his front which also signed the 
declaration would resolutely fight to defend and advance the 
cause of socialism. 
  In his speech at a meeting with representatives of Russian 
political parties held in Moscow April 20, V.I. Anpilov, 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist 
Workers' Party, said "the Pyongyang declaration is the hope of 
our cause and the beacon of socialism for the communists." "In 
the struggle for socialism," he continued, "the Workers' Party 
of Korea and its leaders Comrade Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim 
Chong-il show an example." 
  A.A. Rapin, secretary of the Central Committee of the 
All-Union Bolshevik Communist Party, in his speech said the 
Pyongyang declaration opened a new high stage in the development 
of the international communist movement and the working-class 
movement. "This declaration will be recorded in history along 
with the `communist manifesto'," he said.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- Leaders of political 
parties of different countries expressed full support to and 
sympathy with "Let Us Defend and Advance the Cause of 
Socialism", the Pyongyang declaration published in Pyongyang in 
April 1992. 
  Branko Kitanovic, general secretary of the New Yugoslav 
Communist Movement, said that delegates of many communist and 
workers' parties and political parties of many countries 
aspiring after socialism gathered in Pyongyang and declared to 
the whole world that they would struggle for the victory of 
socialism, and this was a historical event which marked a new 
milestone in the strengthening and development of the socialist 
and communist movement. 
  The Pyongyang declaration, he said, serves the communists 
and 
progressive peoples of the world as a common fighting program in 
rebuilding the socialist and communist movement and advancing 
the cause of socialism with a clear fighting goal on a new basis 
after socialism has suffered a setback and capitalism has 
revived in East European countries owing to moves of the 
renegades of revolution. 
  Guillermo Garcia Ponce, general secretary of the "New 
Alternative" of Venezuela, in a statement issued to the press 
said the Pyongyang declaration is an inspiring banner which gave 
firm confidence in victory to the revolutionary parties and 
people of the world aspiring after socialism, and it declared to 
the whole world that the victory of the socialist cause is 
inevitable. 
  Guzman Rivera Castaneda, general secretary of the 
Revolutionary Socialist Party of Peru, said the Pyongyang 
declaration is a fine document which dealt a telling blow at the 
imperialists who were resorting to vicious anti- communist 
rackets, making a bluff. 
  Sean Garland, member of the Central Executive Committee of 
the Workers' Party of Ireland, said the Pyongyang declaration is 
the source of unity of all the progressive forces. The fact 
that more than 200 revolutionary parties and progressive 
political parties of the world signed the declaration fully 
proves its great vitality, he added. 
  Ludo Martens, chairman of the Central Committee of the 
Belgian Labour Party, said the Pyongyang declaration is a solemn 
declaration announcing a new start of the communist movement. 
The just cause of the revolutionary parties of the world who 
are advancing under the banner of this declaration is sure to be 
crowned with victory, he stressed.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- A national seminar on 
the chuche idea was held in Helsinki on the occasion of the 
birthday of the great leader President Kim Il-song. 
  Pekka Rantala, chairman of the Finnish National Committee 
for 
the Study of the Chuche Idea, made a report, followed by 
speeches. 
  They noted that President Kim Il-song authored the chuche 
idea during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and has 
applied it in all fields of the revolution and construction and 
built Korea to be a model country of socialism as today. 
  They said Korea is making a great progress in the revolution 
and construction under the banner of socialism, not wavering in 
face of the pressure and provocations of the imperialists, 
because it is guided by the chuche idea authored by President 
Kim Il-song. 
  The chuche idea now serves as the undisputed guiding idea in 
the building of socialism and communism and the most universal 
guiding idea from which the world people learn, they added. 
  A congratulatory message to President Kim Il-song was 
adopted 
at the seminar. 
  DPRK book, photo and handicraft exhibitions and film shows 
for April 15 took place in Montevideo, Uruguay, Almada City, 
Setubal Province, Portugal, and Islamabad, Pakistan, and at the 
Madagascan metropolitan special police headquarters, the Lagos 
Liaison Office of the General Film Bureau of Nigeria and the sky

on it. 
  Korea's compulsory free education, free medical care, 
abolition of taxation, free grant of dwelling houses built at

the president's worship of the people. 
  The people express their feelings, saying they owe their 
motherland and future to the leader who backs and leads them. 
  The noble relations of kinship between the leader and the 
people who worship each other produced Korea's unique society 
where the leader and the people are closely united into one.

that he was firmly convinced that the heroic Korean people would 
as ever defend socialism to the end by frustrating moves of the 
reactionary forces including the U.S. imperialists at every step. 
  He said that while touring various places in Pyongyang, he 
deeply felt the noble personality of the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who have 
been devoting their all for the happiness and welfare of the 
people, always finding themselves among the people. 
  Wonderful, indeed, are the perfect natural environment, 
always clean streets and rational traffic conditions of 
Pyongyang and admirable employment conditions for all, he said. 
  Saying the struggle of the Korean people who are resolutely 
safeguarding socialism and fighting in defence of justice enjoys 
unquestioned support of the progressive people of the world, 
whereas the U.S. imperialists' ambition for world domination is 
faced with opposition and rejection by the broad public, he 
stressed that the downfall of imperialism is inevitable. 
  The Korean people who are waging a resolute anti-imperialist 
struggle under the wise leadership of Comrade Kim Il-song and 
Comrade Kim Chong-il will thoroughly smash the U.S. pressure and 
provocation moves, and no one can bring to their knees the 
Korean people who have risen up with a death-defying 
determination, he said.

<F P=106> ["Great Work Which Enables KPA To Fully Discharge its </F>
Mission and Duty" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 24 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries a signed article on the lapse of ten years since the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il published his famous work "The 
People's Army Must Defend Its Leader and Party, Political System 
and Motherland With Its Life". 
  In his speech at the banquet arranged on the 52nd [as 
received] anniversary of the foundation of the Korean People's 
Army [KPA], Comrade Kim Chong-il, supreme commander, put forward 
tasks to build up the People's Army more firmly and increase its 
might, declaring it is the revolutionary Armed Forces of the 
party and its mission is to guarantee the revolutionary cause of 
the party with arms. 
  The daily in the article titled "It is Duty of the People's 
Army to Defend the Party and the Leader and the Political System 
and the Motherland With Its Life" says: 
  It is a famous work greatly conducive to Army building and 
the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause as it gives 
answers to all problems arising in strengthening the People's 
Army into the Army of the leader and the party. 
  The idea, theory and policy for building the Army and 
strengthening it, which are specified in the work, have 
displayed great vitality through practices and their validity 
and attraction fully demonstrated. 
  The validity and vitality of the work are clearly 
manifested, 
above all, in that the backbone ranks of the People's Army have 
been built up more firmly and the whole Army is filled with the 
unshakable determination to be intensively loyal to comrade 
supreme commander and to share the destiny with him. 
  Today the KPA's backbone ranks have grown markedly and their 
role in Army building and military activities is constantly 
increasing. 
  Unshakable in its determination to be intensively loyal to 
General Kim Chong-il, supreme commander, our People's Army has 
become invincible ranks firmly defending the party and the 
leader, the socialist motherland without vacillation in any 
storm. 
  The validity and vitality of the work are also expressed 
evidently in that the whole Army has become matchless ranks in 
which an iron discipline of remaining intensively loyal to 
comrade supreme commander has been established. 
  The intention and plan of comrade supreme commander are 
quickly and correctly conveyed to each soldier and the whole 
Army breathes the same breath with him and thinks and acts as he 
intends. This is the proud looks of the Korean People's Army. 
  The KPA now is an ideological united body of true 
revolutionary soldiers who are struggling with the idea of 
General Kim Chong-il, supreme commander, as its unshakable faith. 
  Its validity and vitality are manifested next in that the 
KPA 
is fully demonstrating its might as a matchless Army well 
prepared militarily and technically. 
  It is displaying its honor as strong, revolutionary armed 
forces equipped with both modern offensive and defensive means. 
  The present reality shows that a revolutionary Army can have 
invincible might and demonstrate its honor as glorious 
revolutionary Armed Forces which reliably defend their party and

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Korean People's Army, Which Highly </F>
Upholds the Dear Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the Supreme 
Commander, is Ever-Victorious and Invincible"] 
  [Text] Today, our People's Army has grown to be an 
ever-victorious and invincible revolutionary armed force under 
the wise leadership of the respected and beloved supreme 
commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, and is proudly displaying its 
dignity. 
  Having an ever-victorious and invincible mighty 
revolutionary 
Army is one of the fundamental difficulties in pioneering the 
nation's fate and future. The revolutionary Army is organized 
and led by the party and the leader. We cannot think about the 
revolutionary Army's existence and activities, and revolutionary 
armed force building and its strengthening and development, 
without the leadership of the party and the leader. 
  Since the leader [yongdoja] plays a decisive role in the 
revolutionary armed force building, determining the might of an 
organized Army is dependent on the greatness of the leader 
[yongdoja] leading it. As history proves, an Army that fights 
by highly upholding an outstanding leader [suryong] and leader 
[yongdoja] has nothing to be afraid of, and it will always be 
ever-victorious possessed with an invincible might. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: The 
party's leadership toward the People's Army is a basic guarantee 
in all victories of the People's Army. 
  It is the privilege of our People's Army today to highly 
uphold the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the top position 
of the country's national defense capacity and the revolutionary 
armed force, and it has become all the more strengthened and 
developed and an ever-victorious and invincible revolutionary 
armed force under his wise leadership. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is the supreme 
commander, developed and completed the chuche-oriented military 
ideology and theory, and strengthened and developed the People's 
Army into a revolutionary Army of one-a-match-for-one-hundred. 
He is a military commander of extraordinary caliber. 
  Most of all, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il formulated 
the chuche-oriented military ideology and theory and war methods 
through the brilliant ideological and theoretical activities by 
linking it with the great leader's esteemed name. He also 
developed and completed it with new ideological and theoretical 
assets. 
  Scientifically formulating and intensifying and developing 
the military theory put forth by the leader [suryong] is one of 
the fundamental problems in the cause of founding the Army of 
the working class and in developing the military ideology and 
theory. 
  The military theory put forth by the leader [suryong] must 
be 
scientifically formulated, and its intrinsic content, structural 
system, and fundamental characteristics must be clarified. With 
this as a cornerstone, military building and military activities 
can be successfully realized in accordance with the leader's 
ideology and intention without the slightest deviation. 
  The chuche-oriented military science, systemized and 
formulated by the dear comrade leader, is a perfected military 
science that consists of military theory and system of war 
methods elucidated by the man-centered military ideology and the 
dear comrade leader. 
  What is especially important in the military ideology and 
theory newly put forth by the dear comrade leader is the 
ideology and theory of modeling the whole Army after the chuche 
idea. The ideology and theory of modeling the whole Army after 
the chuche idea is the highest program of military building in 
which the People's Army must be firmly adhered to in 
strengthening and developing the Army as the Army of the leader 
and Army of the party. Here, the ultimate goal and direction, 
struggle tasks, and methods of military building are wholly 
synthesized. 
  The dear comrade leader also gave an overall scientific 
elucidation in all theoretical and practical problems arising in 
military building and activities, such as the ideology and 
theory on the essence of the revolutionary war and the 
inevitability of its victory; the characteristics of a modern 
war and the theory of building the country's national defense 
capacity; the method to deploy armed struggle and the 
chuche-oriented war method; and the chuche-oriented system and 
art of commanding the Army. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great leader 
[yongdoja] who strengthened and developed our People's Army into 
an Army of the party through extraordinary leadership. 
Endlessly strengthening and developing the Army of the working 
class into an Army of the leader and an Army of the party, is a 
fundamental problem in defending the revolutionary character of 
the Army and fulfill its historical mission and duty. 
  When the revolutionary Army is made through and through into 
an Army of the party, the Army can become a peerless Army that 
defends and safeguards the party's cause with arms. What is 
most important in the respected and beloved comrade supreme 
commander's leadership in making the People's Army an Army of 
the party is to single-heartedly unite the whole Army based on 
loyalty toward the party and the leader. 
  The respected and beloved comrade supreme commander 
elucidated loyalty toward the party and the leader as being of 
the utmost importance to the life of the army, and that we 
cannot fathom the army's single-hearted unity and existence. He 
made it so that the process of modeling the whole army after the 
chuche idea is to firmly establish a revolutionary view of the 
leader amid all the officers and men, and to bear in their 
hearts, loyalty toward the party and the leader as a 
revolutionary faith and integrity. 
  In particular, the respected and beloved comrade supreme 
commander has brought forth a loyal slogan "Let Us Sacrifice Our 
Lives for the Great Leader!" within the People's Army and has 
led the People's Army to live and struggle in conformity with 
such a demand. Thus, he has impregnably strengthened the 
single-hearted unity of the entire army based on the loyalty 
toward the party and the leader [suryong]. 
  Thanks to the leadership of the dear comrade leader, the 
single-hearted unity between the leader [suryong], the party, 
and the Army have become a community of one fate bound together 
with one life; a unified body of ideology and will held together 
by hearts bursting with loyalty and filial duty; and one in body 
and spirit upholding the comrade supreme commander with the 
force of arms. 
  Firmly establishing the party's system of leadership within 
the army is a fundamental demand to develop and enrich the 
People's Army into the party's army. 
  The respected and beloved comrade supreme commander has set 
up the powerful revolutionary discipline by which the entire 
army moves as one under the unitary leadership of the party 
center. Likewise, he has taken steps for commanders, party 
members, and the members of the League of Socialist Working 
Youths of Korea [LSWYK] to endlessly strengthen the 
organizational, ideological life with a high view of the 
organization. 
  In doing so, the revolutionary work system and discipline 
that can firmly guarantee the uniformity of the party's 
leadership within the People's Army has been set up. The 
steel-like revolutionary military ethos in which all the 
officers and men move as one according to the party's order and 
direction was also established. 
  In order to fully prepare our People's Army with the 
qualities befitting the leader's [suryong] army, the party's 
army, and the People's Army, the respected and beloved comrade 
supreme commander has paid much attention to the work to ensure 
officer-men unity, army-people unity, and party members-LSWYK 
members unity, and has wisely led the work. Thus, in our 
country, commanders and soldiers, the army and the people, and 
party members and LSWYK members are faithfully upholding the 
party's cause with one mind and will. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the supreme commander, 
has firmly brought up our People's Army as indomitable ranks 
possessed of the one-a-match-for-100 combat capacity. The 
army's combat capacity can be assessed by the superiority of its 
military technology and armed equipment, along with its 
political, ideological superiority. A war is confrontation not 
only of soldiers' political, ideological strength but also of 
fighting means and armed equipment. Such being the case, in 
order to prevail over the enemy, we need to endlessly promote 
the quality and quantity of the army's arms supply. 
  With his insight into the role and importance of armed 
equipment in a war, the respected and beloved comrade supreme 
commander has wisely led the work to modernize the army with 
modern weapons and combat and technical equipment. Thus, our 
People's Army today has become brilliantly prepared with modern 
combat and technical equipment necessary for an attack and 
defense, and demonstrated its majestic appearance at the 
military parade marking the 60th anniversary of the foundation 
of the Korean People's Army. 
  Important issues arising in the work to strengthen the 
combat 
capacity of the People's Army is that of firmly preparing the 
soldiers of the People's Army militarily and technically, and of 
strengthening military training strategically and tactically. 
  Having set forth a revolutionary slogan "Training Is Also 
Combat" to the People's Army, the respected and beloved comrade 
supreme commander has led the work of strengthening training 
over all else. 
  Thanks to the leadership of the respected and beloved 
comrade 
supreme commander, our People's Army has been brought as an 
invincible army of one-a-match-for-hundred firmly equipped with 
modern weapons and combat and technical equipment of our style, 
and possessed of high military technology and the 
chuche-motivated war method. With those means, the People's 
Army can resolutely smash any enemy and defend the chuche 
revolutionary cause with the force of arms. Truly, our People's 
Army has been all the more brought up as the invincible ranks 
and traversed the path to glorious victory by upholding the wise 
leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the supreme 
commander. There is no enemy that can match the might of our 
People's Army that has been trained and tempered through arduous 
and difficult flames of struggle with the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il at the head of the revolutionary armed forces. 
  Our people and People's Army, as in the past, will 
vigorously 
push ahead with the socialist construction and reliably defend 
the party's cause and the nation's security by firmly uniting 
around the party and the leader [suryong].

Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, the soldiers renewed their 
loyal pledge to become guns and bombs defending the party and 
the leader politically and ideologically and with their lives, 
and defend the sky, the land and the sea of the socialist 
motherland as an impregnable fortress. 
  Before seeing the combat and political training of the 
soldiers and their life, the visitors heard about the history of 
the units that had covered a road of victory and glory under the 
tested guidance of Comrade Kim Chong-il, supreme commander of 
the Korean People's Army, holding the great leader President Kim 
Il-song in high esteem. 
  People's delegations attended colourful functions held at 
the 
units of the three services of the KPA and units of the KPSF on 
the Army Day, deepening the feelings between the Army and the 
people. 
  With the delegations present, meetings were held at the 
units 
to convey gifts from Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  On the Army Day, more than 20 art groups comprising 
Pyongyang 
and local artistes gave performances at the units of the three 
services of the KPA to warmly congratulate them. 
  On April 25, an evening of men and officers of the Ministry 
of the People's Armed Forces was held at the Jonsung Square in 
Pyongyang.

brilliant commander.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- The Korean People's 
Army [KPA] soldiers are performing feats of labor at socialist 
construction sites. 
  The People's Army soliders mobilized in building the 
Pyongyang-Hyangsan express highway have almost completed the 
laying of the roadbed in the section of one hundred and scores 
of kilometres. They are pushing ahead with the construction of 
many difficult and complicated structures including bridges and 
tunnels at an accelerated pace. 
  The soldiers in charge of the construction of a Ungna 
suspension bridge across the Taedong River flowing through 
Pyongyang are stepping up the project of the bridge extending 
hundreds of metres at the final stage. 
  The People's Army soldiers have undertaken many other major 
objects of the country. Among the monumental edifices built by 
them in all parts of the country are the February 8 Vinalon 
complex, the February 8 cement complex, the February 8 Chiktong 
youth coal mine, the Taechon power stations, the West Sea 
Barrage, and the Pyongyang-Wonsan express highway. 
  The Grand Metro, the February 8 House of Culture, the ice 
rink and other monumental architectures in the capital were also 
built by People's Army soldiers. 
  In recent years they completed with credit scores of large 
construction projects such as the Pyongyang-Kaesong express 
highway and 800-kilometre-long waterways on the west coast. 
  It was at the time of the construction of the February 8 
vinalon complex that the People's Army soldiers created the 
"Vinalon" speed by building 50 odd structures with a plottage of 
500,000 square metres in a short period. 
  When they took charge of the construction of the west sea 
barrage in which four billion dollars were invested, they 
performed feats by completing it in a matter of five years, 
which would have taken dozen of years by the established method 
of construction. 
  Many heroes and order recipients emerged from among the 
people's Army soldiers in the whole period of socialist 
construction.

<F P=106> ["Outstanding Military Strategist" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- Dear Comrade Kim 
Chong-il is a great military strategist and iron-willed 
brilliant commander possessed of rare military wisdom, matchless 
grit and distinguished commanding art. 
  He has published many works including "Let Us Strengthen the 
People's Army into Matchless Ranks" to give a comprehensive 
answers to all the theoretical and practical questions arising 
in building revolutionary Armed Forces, and has strengthened and 
developed the Korean People's Army [KPA] into invincible Armed 
Forces with energetic guidance. 
  It is the greatest feat performed by Comrade Kim Chong-il in 
the great work of Army building that he has trained the KPA into 
loyal and filial Armed Forces defending the party and the 
leader, the country and people with their lives. 
  He has attached particular importance to the singlehearted 
unity of the whole Army based on the idea of the leader in 
increasing its combat capabilities. He put forward a new policy 
of modelling the whole Army on the chuche idea to this end. 
  And he trained the whole Army into ranks with steel-like 
discipline that act as one on the orders and instructions of the 
party, ranks singleheartedly united in ideology and purpose and 
in morality and sense of obligation, with his tireless energetic 
guidance. The integral whole of complete unity in ideology and 
purpose, the community of destiny, that shares the destiny and 
bitters and sweets in the struggle for the country and people -- 
this is the looks of the KPA that has grown up under the loving 
care of the great brilliant commander. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il has wisely led the work of building a 
powerful self-reliant national defence industry to strengthen 
and develop the KPA into an invincible Army. 
  He, with a deep insight into the features of modern warfare, 
indicated the direction and ways of building the self-reliant 
national defence industry and solved all problems with 
never-ceasing trips of on-the-spot guidance. 
  Thus, the KPA has been strengthened into invincible ranks 
equipped with modern offensive and defensive means. 
  Another great feat performed by Comrade Kim Chong-il in the 
great work of Army building is that he has made sure that the 
beautiful traits of Army-civilian unity is fully displayed 
throughout the country so that the Army and the people may help 
each other, and that the arming of the entire people and the 
fortification of the whole country have been completed. 
  In Korea, under his outstanding guidance and politics of 
love, the Army and people are united by blood ties like one 
family and the whole country has turned into an impregnable 
fortress which no formidable enemy can provoke. 
  The iron will, grit and distinguished commanding art of 
Comrade Kim Chong-il instill deep conviction of victory in the 
revolution and fighting spirit into the Korean people. 
  In early March last year a touch-and-go crisis was created 
on 
the Korean peninsula owing to the adventurous aggressive war 
rackets of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet 
clique. Progressive mankind of the world was deeply concerned 
over it. At that time, Comrade Kim Chong-il proclaimed a 
semi-war state to the whole country, entire people and whole 
Army and saw to it that a decisive statement on the withdrawal 
of the DPRK from NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] was 
issued in the wake of it. 
  And he turned the whole party, the entire people and the 
whole Army into a powerful combat force and the Korean people 
rose up like a mountain in hearty response to the call of the 
illustrious leader. The enemies trembled with fear. 
  This was how peace on the Korean peninsula and the rest of 
Asia was defended. 
  "We will win because General Kim Chong-il, an iron-willed 
brilliant commander, is leading us"--this is the unshakable will 
and faith of the Korean people and the People's Army officers 
and soldiers.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
dedicates an article to the 30th anniversary of the publication 
of "On Improving the Work of the Youth League To Meet the 
Requirements of the Developing Situation", a famous work of the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il in his work published on April 22, 1964 
elaborated on the need to do substantial work with the young 
people, firmly build up the rank of officials of the League of 
Socialist Working Youth and enhance their role in view of the 
practical demand in renaming the Democratic Youth League the 
League of Socialist Working Youth [LSWY]. 
  In a by-lined article headlined "Highly Important Work Which 
Brought a Revolutionary Turn in the Work of the Youth League" 
the paper says the work serves as a highly important guideline 
in the development of our youth movement as it clearly indicates 
the tasks of the LSWY, the political reserve unit of the 
Workers' Party of Korea, and ways of their fulfilment. 
  For the validity and truth of the idea and theory expounded 
in it, the work has displayed its great vitality to the full, 
successfully applied to the work of the LSWY in the past 30 
years, the article says, and goes on: 
  The significance and vitality of the work lie first of all 
in 
that it has helped improve the work with the young people so 
that they could grow stoutly to be true revolutionaries of 
chuche type and successors to the revolution who, firmly armed 
with the revolutionary idea of the party and the leader, devote 
everything to the party and the revolution, the country and the 
people. 
  All the young people in our country today are growing to be 
lifeguards and death-defying corps defending the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il with death on the forefront. 
  We cannot find in any other place such revolutionary young 
people as ours who are unfailingly loyal to the leader, sound in 
ideology and pure in morality. Our party and people deem it a 
great pride to have such laudable and trustworthy young people 
of new generation as the reserves of the revolution. 
  The significance and vitality of the work also lie in that 
it 
has helped firmly build up the ranks of officials of the LSWY 
and enhance their role constantly and thus make the LSWY 
organisations to be virile organisations. 
  The dear leader's work is an immortal banner which makes it 
possible to improve and strengthen the LSWY work and stoutly 
rear all the young people as reliable successors to the 
revolution, stresses the article.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Asean Delivers a Slap in the Face of </F>
Democracy"] 
  [Text] Asean officials meeting in Phatthaya over the 
weekend to discuss details of the 27th Asean meeting to be held 
in Bangkok in July, reached a decision over Thailand's 
invitation to Burma. 
  The senior officials agreed that Burma should come as a 
guest 
of Thailand and not of the Asean Standing Committee (ASC) as 
proposed by Thailand. Their rationale was that the country was 
still administered by a military junta and had yet to show 
enough "positive gestures" to justify an invitation from the ASC. 
  But if Burma has yet to show enough "positive gestures" to 
deserve an invitation from the ASC, why is it being allowed to 
attend as a guest of Thailand? Why the double standard? 
  Disappointingly, the Asean governments best positioned to 
persuade the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council 
(Slorc) to return democracy to the people have been far from 
helpful. Only constructive engagement, these nations say, will 
slowly persuade the Slorc to soften its harsh rule and join the 
ranks of civilized nations. 
  The latest Asean leader to visit Burma was Singapore Prime 
Minister Goh Chok Tong who was accompanied by 24 businessmen, 
all eyeing contracts with the despised junta. 
  If trading with the Slorc through Asean's constructive 
engagement policy has made the Rangoon military junta less of a 
monster, then why is it that international human rights 
organizations still maintain there is a climate of fear and 
repression in Burma? 
  If constructive engagement is working, then why does the 
military regime continue to refuse to hold talks with its 
democratic opponents? 
  Last month, the Slorc chief, Lt Gen [Lieutenant General] 
Khin 
Nyunt told THE NEW YORK TIMES that he would not meet or grant 
any political standing to Aung San Suu Kyi, the democracy leader 
and Nobel Peace laureate who has been under house arrest in 
Rangoon since 1989. That flat statement dashed the hopes of 
many who thought the Slorc might be easing its iron grip. 
  For the first time since her arrest, Suu Kyi had recently 
been allowed to see a non-family visitor, US Congressman Bill 
Richardson of the House Intelligence Committee. 
  It seems that Khin Nyunt, also head of Burmese military 
intelligence, seems determined to keep her under arrest. "There 
are 42 million people here," he told THE NEW YORK TIMES' Philip 
Shenon, "and they are not bothered by Aung San Suu Kyi." 
  As far as Suu Kyi is concerned, Asean leaders consider her 
an 
"internal matter" of Burma and not a major issue related to the 
return of democracy. This is indeed sad and unfortunate as it 
clearly shows the regional grouping is adhering to a blinkered 
Burma policy when world leaders are standing up for the Nobel 
laureate. 
  The administration of US President Bill Clinton for instance 
has reviewed American policy towards Burma and reportedly 
decided to increase pressure on the Slorc. 
  Washington is also pressuring other nations to stop sending 
arms to the brutal military regime. 
  Under a system of representative democracy only those who 
are 
elected by the people have a right to represent them. Only they 
have the right to write a constitution and make the rules by 
which the people will be governed. 
  The charade of a national convention going on in Rangoon to 
draft a constitution is a shadow play with Slorc moving its 
handpicked puppets. 
  Economists within the junta boast they have created an 
economic miracle in a few years, adding that a certain amount of 
authoritarian rule is beneficial to development. 
  And Asean leaders too have been parroting this Slorc phrase. 
  If this is true, why then are Burmese factories operating at 
less than 40 per cent capacity? And why has Slorc decided to 
print new money in larger denominations and appealed to the 
World Bank to draw on its gold reserves? 
  The ruling Burmese military junta has no regard for the will 
of the people, is answerable to no authority and has no 
responsibility to explain its behaviour. 
  For Asean to reward the Slorc generals with better trade and 
diplomatic relations and allow Burma to be present at the 
regional grouping's July meeting as a guest of Thailand, is 
indeed a slap in the face of democracy.

  [Text] Burmese authorities agreed yesterday to free 30 
Thais from Rangoon's notorious In Sein prison, following two 
days of top level border discussions, First Army Region Lt Gen 
[Lieutenant General] Chettha Thanacharo said yesterday. 
  The prisoners, whose sentences ranged from 10 to 15 years, 
are to be released unconditionally and immediately, he told 
reporters. 
  There are some 350 Thais in In Sein, most of them fishermen 
and loggers caught in Burmese territory, according to the Thai 
Ambassador to Rangoon, Wirasak Futrakun. 
  Chettha was close-mouthed on progress on other issues during 
the Thailand-Burma Regional Border Committee meeting, which 
finished in Bangkok yesterday. 
  But he said Burmese officials showed a "good attitude 
towards 
solving border disputes through official channels and that 
prisoners of both countries would be treated humanely." 
  Chettha added that Major General Khet Sein, who is heading 
the Burmese delegation to Bangkok, also agreed to look into the 
case of nine Thai fishing trawlers which went missing recently 
in the Andaman Sea and showed up later in Rangoon.

  [Text] Speaking to reporters on the outcome of the just 
concluded ninth meeting of the Thai-Burmese Regional Border 
Committee at Bangkok's Siam City Hotel this morning, Lieutenant 
General Chettha Thanacharo, commander of the First Army Region, 
said that the delegations of the two countries discussed joint 
efforts to solve border problems and develop the areas along 
their common border. During the meeting, officials of the two 
countries signed agreements on cooperation in many areas such as 
fishing in the territorial waters of the two countries, 
prevention of disputes over unclear border lines, and promotion 
of good mutual understanding. 
  The First Army Region commander added that the meeting also 
discussed the problem of violations of the law by the peoples 
living along the common border of the two countries. The Thai 
side reaffirmed the Thai Government's policy of respecting 
Burma's law and sovereignty and proposed regular meetings of 
local officials of the two countries to prevent and solve all 
problems which may arise in the future. Lt Gen Chettha 
Thanacharo disclosed that at present there are some 350 Thai 
nationals imprisoned in different parts of Burma. During the 
meeting, the Thai side requested that all Thai inmates be 
transfered to Rangoon so that it will be convinient for Thai 
officials to visit them and so that they be treated in 
accordance with the principle of humanitarianism. The Burmese 
side has agreed to comply with the request and notified the Thai 
side about the release of the first batch of 30 Thai inmates. 
  Meanwhile, the Information Department of the Foreign 
Ministry 
reported that the release of the first batch of 30 Thai 
prisoners was announced during the closing ceremony of the ninth 
meeting of the Thai-Burmese Regional Border Committee today by 
Major General Ket Sein, commander of the Southeast Military 
Command of Burma and head of the Burmese delegation at the 
meeting. During his visit to Burma on 19 and 20 April, Foreign 
Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri met with Senior General 
Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council, and asked the latter to consider releasing or giving 
parole to Thai nationals imprisoned in that country. 
  Taking into account the good relations and friendship 
between 
Thailand and Burma and the success of the ninth meeting of the 
Thai- Burmese Regional Border Committee, the Burmese Government 
has decided to release 30 Thai prisoners, who will be handed 
over to representatives of the First Army Region by Burmese 
authorities at Kawthaung township.

  [Text] Thailand will accelerate the repatriation of the 
remaining 25,000 Hmongs and Laotians at the country's last 
Indochinese refugee camp at Nakhon Phanom so the camp can be 
closed by the end of this year. 
  Khachatphai Burutphat, deputy secretary-general of the 
National Security Council [NSC], told a press conference 
yesterday that the Thai government had no policy of allowing the 
settlement of any refugees and that it would try to reduce the 
number of border camps, with the last one holding Indochinese 
refugees, at Ban Na Pho in Nakhon Phanom province, to go by the 
end of this year. 
  Refugee camps on the Thai-Cambodian border were closed early 
last year when hundreds of thousands of Khmer refugees were sent 
home after the UN-sponsored peace settlement in the war-torn 
nation. 
  However, border camps still exist on the western frontier 
with Burma where several tens of thousands of refugees are 
taking shelter as a result of four decades of civil war between 
the Burmese Army and various anti-Rangoon ethnic minorities. 
  Laos, Thailand and the UNHCR agreed in June 1991 to 
repatriate all Laotian refugees within three years. But so far 
only 8,619 have been sent home under the tripartite effort, 
leaving another 25,000 stranded in Thailand due to difficulties 
on the part of Laos and the UNHCR, Khachatphai said. 
  He said he had urged Laos and the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to find new approaches to 
expedite the repatriation process. Of the 25,000 refugees, 
22,000 are highland Hmong. 
  Many difficulties, such as a lack of repatriation funds on 
the part of the UNHCR, and the lack of basic infrastructure and 
suitable relocation sites in Laos, have slowed the process, 
according to the NSC chief. 
  Khachatphai has tried to encourage the repatriation process 
by pointing to the easing of ideological conflicts in Laos. He 
said Vientiane, apart from its repeated guarantee of returnees' 
safety against government reprisals, has also stated that it 
wants the returnees to help develop the landlocked nation. 
  He said the UNHCR would provide assistance to the returnees 
as well as help them resettle in their preferred community. 
  This morning a group of over 400 Hmong refugees, the largest 
such group to be returned so far this year, will be repatriated 
overland to Laos via the newly opened Thai-Lao Bridge, he added.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday said he was 
sure last Saturday's bomb explosion at Nakhon Si Thammarat 
railway station was an act of subversion to destroy the 
Government but admitted he had no hard evidence pointing to any 
particular group. 
  "Personally, I believe this might be the work of a 
subversive 
group out to sabotage the Government by terrorising the public, 
even though we do not have enough evidence to specify which 
group was responslble," he sald. 
  Mr Chuan said he was waiting for a detailed report from the 
Police Department and needed a concise investigation result 
before he would comment on the incident. 
  The Premier said there were several differing opinions among 
senior police involved in the case so it was important not to 
confuse and frighten the public with speculation or rumour. 
  He said he had given strict orders to officials to be 
extremely careful in their investigations and preventive 
measures, especially now when there are rumours of bomb threats 
in the South as well as- in Bangkok. 
  Meanwhile yesterday the Interior Ministry decided to improve 
its operation centre to counter subversive activities in the 
country. 
  The decision was made at a closeddoor meeting of the 
National 
Civil Defence Committee chaired by Interior Minister Chavalit 
Yongchaiyudh. 
  The meeting agreed to provide the centre with more manpower 
and a bigger budget to boost its capacity in 
intelligence-gathering to prevent acts of sabotage, said centre 
chief Ari Wong-araya, who is also Permanent Secretary for 
Interior. 
  Mr Ari said the meeting yesterday also decided to recruit 
the 
support of members of various organisations including village 
scouts to help serve as the "eyes and ears" of the Government to 
prevent acts of sabotage. 
  He said the Government was understaffed and without the help 
of these volunteers to help report on possible sabotage attempts 
the effort could fail. 
  Police Department chief Prathin Santipraphop insisted 
yesterday the Nakhon Si Thammarat railway station bombing was an 
act of personal vengeance and not a politically-motivated act. 
  He emphasised his theory was based on information obtained 
by 
investigators handling the case and was not a baseless 
assumption. 
  "Other persons who are speaking from their own assumption 
should not offer comments as this will only add more to public 
confusion," Pol Gen Pratin said. 
  Police Department deputy chief Vinit Charoensiri said 
yesterday, however, investigators probing the attack have three 
separate theories: a love conflict, a political conflict and 
terrorism by separatists.

<F P=106> ["Koeh"-signed report: "Rexrodt Calls for More Investment </F>
in Asia"] 
  [Text] Bangkok -- Federal Economics Minister Guenther 
Rexrodt has called on German industry to increase its 
involvement in the Asian Pacific region, above all in the form 
of direct investment. At the start of the Fifth German Business 
Asia-Pacific Conference, the minister approved "political 
support" from the Federal Government. Speaking on behalf of 
over 200 participants, Siemens chief Heinrich von Pierer called 
for a "change of direction" in how German companies think about 
foreign countries and favored an "innovation partnership" with 
Asian economies. 
  Rexrodt considers "company presence in the form of direct 
investment, cooperation agreements, and the exchange of 
technology and know-how" essential for Germany to meet the 
challenge of the Asian Pacific region of rapid economic growth. 
The Federal Government also wants to provide more support for 
German industry's foreign interests. Rexrodt rejected public 
export and investment subsidies, but promised "political 
support" from Bonn. "Business can expect politicians to seek to 
achieve equal opportunities, that they will help to remove 
political restrictions on entry to markets." 
  In response to complaints from some conference participants 
that the Federal Government was doing relatively little for 
German business abroad, Rexrodt said: "We can only succeed in 
obtaining what we want if companies name specific obstacles." 
As far as Rexrodt is concerned, equal competitive opportunities 
particularly apply to finance. The minister announced that 
Hermes instruments would be reformed to meet new challenges 
before parliament's summer recess. 
  Rexrodt rejected state-subsidized "soft loans," which 
governments use to assist companies in obtaining large contracts 
for the development of regional infrastructure. "We will not 
open the floodgates." On the other hand, the minister considers 
the protection of German foreign investment, including capital 
guarantees, to belong to the "core of foreign economic policy." 
"Advertising Germany" through fairs and technology shows is also 
in the state's interest and should be developed in the same way 
as foreign trade chambers' information and advisory networks. 
Medium-sized businesses should be the main beneficiary and be 
encouraged to view Asia as more than just a market for sales 
crises, but should nail their colors to the mast there 
permanently. 
  Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, 
who 
welcomed the German managers who had gathered in Bangkok, also 
pointed to this dilemma in company strategy. He criticized 
"declining interest" in investment in his country and the 
one-sided concentration on selling finished products. Siemens 
President Heinrich von Pierer called for a "change of direction" 
in this sense. As the chairman of German business's Asia 
Pacific commission, von Pierer complained that the region 
accounted for 10 percent of German exports, but only 3 to 4 
percent of German investment. Whereas Japan has invested 58 
billion German marks [DM] in the southeast Asian ASEAN 
countries, Germany has only invested DM2 billion in this boom 
region with a growth rate of between 7 and 10 percent.

  [Text] A prominent economist called yesterday for Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai to dissolve Parliament in order to 
prevent an economic depression that may result from a coup 
d'etat. 
  Dr Chalongphop Susangkan, human resources programme director 
at the independent Thailand Development Research Institute 
[TDRI], warned that if the current political situation continues 
unchecked, it could become an excuse for the military to seize 
power. 
  Business figures and stock market investors contacted by 
Business Post yesterday also called for the House of 
Representatives to be dissolved although they did not 
necessarily agree that continued problems would encourage a coup. 
  And Dr Chalongphop's boss, TDRI president Amma Sayamwanla, 
also an economist, blamed the largely military-appointed Senate 
for the political problems. He said the Senate should be 
dissolved as well, although he did not think a coup would be 
encouraged if Parliament is not dissolved. 
  "I know that the constitution doesn't allow for the 
dissolution of the Senate, but many of the country's problems 
would be solved if the Senate also could be disbanded," he said. 
  Dr Amma blamed senators' voting against the Government's 
constitutional amendment proposals for the current political 
problems. 
  He argued that since senators and their allies in the 
Opposition had preferred to adopt the now-defunct 1978 
constitution as the basis for their proposals, they had created 
an "open season" for criticising all aspects of the present 
constitution, including the composition and continuation in 
office of the present Senate. 
  Dr Chalongphop issued his warning at a seminar organised by 
Board of Trade of Thailand to evaluate the economy in the first 
quarter and the outlook for this year. He said that the outlook 
is bright for the economy to grow at least 8 percent as 
predicted by many institutions. 
  The only clouds he could see were political: conflict over a 
possible Cabinet reshuffle, the constitutional dispute and the 
bombs attacks in the South. 
  These situations contained the risk that someone might want 
to be a "knight on a white horse" coming to the rescue by 
staging a coup, Dr Chalongphop said. 
  "In order to pre-empt such a situation, I suggest the Prime 
Minister dissolve Parliament and return authority to people to 
vote again because already there are many signs that the 
political situation is the virus that would harm the economy." 
  He said he believed the private sector and the country's 
economy were immune to political changes accomplished in a 
democratic manner. Nondemocratic changes would not be accepted, 
he said. 
  Responding to a comment that he is too pessimistic, Dr 
Chalongphop said Thai history provides warnings to politicians 
that they must not allow anyone to take advantage of political 
drift. 
  Asked whether he thought the political situation would 
continue until the end of this year, Dr Chalongphop said that in 
the past significant changes usually occurred unexpectedly. 
These would affect some industries such as tourism and slow 
foreign investment, particularly from Japan. 
  Prayun Thaloengsi, executive director of the Board of Trade 
of Thailand, took the contrary position, saying the country 
should give the coalition more time to amend the constitution 
and then decide their future. 
  Prida Tiasuwan, managing director of Pranda Jewelry, said 
jewellery exports would grow by 8-9 percent even at a time of 
political conflict, but a coup would mean a bleak future for his 
industry. 
  Dr Wicha Chiwalai, president of the Condominium Traders 
Association, said that political uncertainty, the government's 
failure to privatise telecommunications and public transport, as 
well as fluctuations on the Stock Exchange of Thailand would 
jeopardise the growth of the property industry. 
  Other government and private-sector participants in 
yesterday's seminar felt the economy would continue to grow 
satisfactorily, based on the rise in exports, the stimulus 
provided by infrastructure projects, the expansion of industries 
to rural areas, and positive external factors such as the 
recovery of the world economy. 
  Bank of Thailand representative Suchada Thirakun said 
economic growth in the first quarter was 8 percent, better than 
the same period of last year because of a 17 percent rise in 
exports, particularly industrial and agricultural products. 
  Ms Suchada said the outlook for the whole year is expected 
to 
be better than 1993 but she cautioned that inflation may be as 
high as 4.5 percent. 
  Business Economics Department representative Manop Tahongyen 
said exports in the first two months were about 150 billion 
baht, up 1213 percent from the same period last year; the March 
figures will be higher still. 
  National Economic and Social Development Board [NESDB] 
representative Akhom Toemphitayaphisit said the NESDB had 
suggested the government do three things to improve the economy: 
speed up infrastructure projects; increase private sector 
confidence in investing in rural areas; and restructure the 
tariff system. 
  Local investors contacted at the SET yesterday said a 
dissolution of Parliament would improve investment sentiment. 
  Stock analysts believed dissolution is highly possible after 
Parliament approves the budget. 
  Phaibun Ratniyom, an analyst from Asia Securities Trading, 
said Thai politics is at turning point. If dissolution occurred 
now it would stall economic growth since the budget allocation 
process has not started. 
  He ruled out the possibility of coup, saying "people power" 
now dominated Thai politics. 
  American investor Doug Grahan said Thai politics were not an 
important factor in his decisions to invest in Thai stocks. He 
said dissolution or any changes in the government could be 
positive for Thai investors.

<F P=106> ["Text" of reply speech by President Le Duc Anh at state </F>
banquet hosted by Indonesian President Suharto in Jakarta on 26 
April -- recorded] 
  [Text] Dear President Suharto, Mrs. Suharto, and ladies and 
gentlemen of the country of the historic Bandung Conference; 
  I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the 
wholehearted reception and warm feelings of friendship extended 
to us by his excellency president, his wife, and the Indonesian 
people from the first moment we arrived in your country. I am 
moved at the president's fine words about the Vietnamese 
fatherland and people and the relations between our two 
countries. These words demonstrate the Indonesian people's 
profound feelings for our people. 
  Being in the Southeast Asian region, the peoples of Vietnam 
and Indonesia struggled under harsh conditions for national 
independence and both won victories in 1945. Over the last 49 
years, we have built a fine relationship of friendship, 
sympathy, and mutual understanding. 
  Our people always remember the Indonesian people's honest 
support for the Vietnamese people's legitimate effort for 
national unification. Today, our two peoples share a common 
aspiration in building a prosperous country and changing 
Southeast Asia into a region of peace, stability, and 
cooperation. That is the firm basis for the continuous 
consilidation and development of our long-term friendship and 
cooperation relations, making it a long-lived relationship as 
our beloved President Ho Chi Minh said 35 years ago when he 
visited Indonesia. 
  Dear President Suharto, ladies, and gentlemen; 
  Visiting the fraternal Indonesian country, we are happy 
about 
the great achievements made in the past 25 years by the 
Indonesian people under the president's leadership and under the 
national ideology of Pancasila. On this occasion, we sincerely 
wish the Indonesian people greater achievements in taking 
Indonesia into the taking-off period in national development and 
international and regional cooperation. 
  As the president of the Nonaligned Movement, Indonesia has 
actively contributed toward a Southeast Asia region of peace and 
cooperation and for a more stable and prosperous world. On that 
basis, Indonesia has an increasingly important role in the world 
and region. Vietnam wholeheartedly supports Indonesia's active 
role in that direction and stands side by side with our 
Indonesian friends in the struggle for peace and equal 
cooperation among nations. 
  Dear Mr. President, ladies, and gentlemen; 
  The international and regional situations continue to change 
in a swift, profound, and complicated manner, thus presenting 
all nations great opportunities and challenges. In our region, 
the trend of peace, stability, cooperation, and development has 
been increasing. We believe that Southeast Asia is enjoying the 
most favorable conditions since the end of World War II for 
solidly building cooperation for regional long-term peace and 
prosperity. We always attach importance to improved relations of 
friendship and cooperation for mutual benefit among regional 
countries on unilateral and bilateral bases. 
  We are content at the fine development of the Vietnam-ASEAN 
relationship, and with ASEAN's active support, Vietnam is 
energetically preparing to become a full member. We hold that 
this conforms with both Vietnamese and ASEAN interests and is 
beneficial to peace, stability, cooperation, and development in 
the region. We strongly believe that my official friendship 
visit to Indonesia will contribute to solving problems of mutual 
concern and further accelerate our multi-faceted friendship and 
cooperation relation for the benefit of the peoples in our two 
countries and for peace, stability, cooperation, and prosperity 
in Southeast Asia and the world. 
  In the atmosphere of friendship and fraternity between the 
peoples of Vietnam and Indonesia, I invite all of you to toast 
President Suharto and his wife to good health and happiness, the 
prosperity of the Indonesian people, the consolidation and 
development of the Vietnamese-Indonesian multi-faceted 
friendship and cooperation, and Southeast Asia becoming a region 
of peace, friendship, cooperation, and development. I wish you 
all good health.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 27. -- Both Vietnam and Indonesia 
share the same aspirations of creating Southeast Asia as a zone 
of peace, freedom and neutrality, a region with a high rate of 
growth and prosperity as well as a region that ensures the 
well-being of every citizen, said President Suharto in his 
speech at the banquet, he gave in Jakarta yesterday in honour of 
President Le Duc Anh's official visit to Indonesia. 
  The Indonesian President continued: `It is precisely the 
same 
aspiration to create a peaceful and prosperous region that serve 
as the bases of the struggle of the member-states of ASEAN. In 
this context, we are highly appreciative of Vietnam's 
participation as an observer and of its seriousness to establish 
cooperation in many areas with ASEAN. 
  `Due to the our experience during more than a quarter of 
century and to the strong solidarity among ASEAN member-states, 
we have been able to preserve stability and security in 
Southeast Asia, even though the pattern of international 
relations is undergoing fundamental changes. ASEAN is trying 
its best to stress on the importance of settling a dispute 
through peaceful means. We can reduce the potential conflicts 
in our region by continuing to hold discussion aimed at 
enhancing mutual trust. Conversely, we have to see to it that 
these different potentials can be used as beneficial assets for 
our cooperation'... 
  President Suharto went on: 
  `I am sure the Vietnamese Government also sees the many 
opportunities that can still be developed through a close 
regional cooperation covering various aspects of the economic 
development. In this spirit, I am highly encouraged by the 
economic cooperation in various sectors that have been 
established so far. 
  `However, I also believe that there are still many areas 
that 
we can work together. There are still opportunities available 
in the trade relation and cooperation, capital investment, 
financial services and other areas. 
  `The basis of our economies are complementary. Our two 
respective governments attach great importance to the creation 
of a healthy business climate. Enterpreneurs in both countries 
are very eager to expand their economic scopes. All of this 
convinces me that Vietnam and Indonesia can develop cooperation 
as dependable and mutually beneficial economic partners. 
  `The future close relationship between our two countries is 
further strengthened by the close bonds of friendship between 
both Vietnamese and Indonesian officials. Such close 
relationship and mutual trust are important in the efforts to 
impartially settle a number of issues affecting the bilateral 
relations between Vietnam and Indonesia. 
  `As neighbouring countries that share the same historical 
affinities, I sincerely hope that we can conclude the ongoing 
negotiation in a satisfactory manner, particularly on the issues 
of the continental shelf boundary and repatriation of 
non-refugees. I am convinced that based on the good-intentions 
that have been demonstrated by both parties so far, we can 
achieve a satisfactory result'. 
  In reply, President Le Duc Anh said that the Vietnamese 
people had forever borne in mind the Indonesian people's 
wholehearted support for their just struggle for national 
reunification. 
  The Vietnamese leader continued: 
  `At present the Vietnamese and Indonesian people have common 
desires to build Vietnam and Indonesia into prosperous 
countries, and Southeast Asia a region of peace, stability and 
cooperation. This is the firm basis to constantly consolidate 
and develop the time-honoured friendship and cooperation between 
the two countries, and made it become the everlasting friendship 
as stated by President Ho Chi Minh 35 years ago when he visited 
Indonesia'. 
  After hailing the great achievement recorded by the 
Indonesian people in the past 25 years under the leadership of 
President Suharto, President Anh said: 
  `In its capacity as president of the Non-aligned Movement, 
indonesia has made positive contributions to a Southeast Asia of 
peace and cooperation and to a stabler and more prosperous 
world. Indonesia thereby, has an increasingly important role to 
play in the region and the world. Vietnam strongly supports 
Indonesia's positive activities, and stands side by side the 
Indonesia for a long lasting peace and prosperity in the 
region'. [sentence as received] 
  `We have always treasured and constantly strengthened the 
relations of friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation with 
countries in the region on the basis of bilateral and 
multilateral cooperation. We are satisfied at the fine 
development of the Vietnam-ASEAN cooperation. As observer in 
ASEAN, Vietnam is trying its best with support from all ASEAN 
member countries to early become full member of the 
organization. We hold that this conforms to the benefits of the 
two parties and to peace, stability, cooperation and development 
in the region'. 
  `I believe that my visit to Indonesia would contribute to 
further promoting the friendship and all-sided cooperation 
between the two countries in the interests of the two nations 
and for the sake of peace, stability, cooperation and prosperity 
in Southeast Asia and the world as a whole', he concluded.

<F P=106> [Speech by Vo Tran Chi, secretary of the Ho Chi Minh City </F>
[HCMC] party committee, at the midterm party conference of the 
Ho Chi Minh City party organization] 
  [Text] Dear veteran comrade revolutionaries, dear comrade 
guests of the conference, dear comrade delegates: The midterm 
party conference of the fifth Ho Chi Minh City party 
organization has successfully ended today after four days of 
urgent work in an atmosphere of revolutionary enthusiasm and a 
high sense of duty. 
  In the light of the resolutions of the Seventh Party 
Congress, the Mid-Term National Party Conference of the Seventh 
Central Committee, and the fifth Ho Chi Minh City party 
organization congress, our conference seriously evaluated the 
development of the renovation process in the city and 
straightforwardly pointed out achievements and progress as well 
as shortcomings and weaknesses. The conference also derived 
practical leadership and implementation experiences and most 
importantly, set forth the orientations and revolutionary action 
program for the city party organization to follow during the 
remaining part of its term. At this conference, we unanimously 
elected an additional number of comrades to the city party 
organization standing committee. The election proceeded 
according to set regulations and aimed at enhancing the strength 
of the key agency of the city party organization so that it can 
meet the urgent requirements of the renovation process in the 
city. 
  Our conference had the honor to welcome Comrade Nguyen Van 
Linh, adviser to the Central Committee, and Comrade Phan Van 
Khai, member of the Political Bureau. The presence of the two 
comrades and their views at this conference have given our 
entire city more wisdom and strength to continue a journey which 
is rife with difficulties and challenges but is also full of 
great prospects. 
  Over the past several months, in preparation for this 
conference, the city party organization at all levels, including 
many veteran comrade revolutionaries affected by old age and 
poor health, enthusiastically contributed many valuable 
contributions to the documents to be presented to the 
conference. Over the past few days, 263 comrades contributed 
their suggestions at group discussions and 23 other comrades 
expressed their views in the conference hall. Those views had 
one thing in common, namely shedding more light on the issues 
under discussion. Many of these views were very straightforward 
and accurate. They demonstrated a very high sense of 
responsibility and a positive attitude. As a result, they 
clarified many important issues and enhanced the quality of the 
political report of the conference. 
  It is very clear that this conference marks a major 
democratic activity in the party and shows the concentrated 
efforts of the city party organization to study and creatively 
apply the Mid-Term National Party Conference Resolution to the 
real situation in the city, which is a center having a serious 
responsibility toward the area and the country in many respects. 
  The final result of this conference still depends on the 
stringent test of real life situations when the resolutions of 
the conference truly penetrate society and make their presence 
felt. Nonetheless, the traditions of solidarity, 
singlemindedness, strong will, and great determination make us 
look toward the future with confidence and hope that with the 
mind and hands of grassroots party organizations, the personal 
efforts of our compatriots of all walks of life, the close 
leadership of the Central Committee, and the harmonious 
coordination and wholehearted assistance of other localities 
throughout the country, our city will score even greater 
achievements. 
  From the rostrum of this conference, on behalf of the Ho Chi 
Minh City party organization, I would like to express our 
sincere gratitude to the Central Committee for its leadership. 
Our thanks also go to the comrade veteran revolutionaries, 
party organization delegates, and compatriots of all walks of 
life in the city for their concern and high sense of 
responsibility. All those factors have given us more strength 
to make this conference a success, thereby opening new prospects 
for the city to move along a path full of both challenges and 
promises. 
  Dear comrades, we face both opportunities and challenges. 
Let us be determined to eliminate dangers, overcome challenges, 
and grasp all opportunities to lead the renovation undertaking 
forward in a vigorous and steady manner. That is the complete 
scenario of the entire country and the city for us to see and 
correctly define our tasks for the days ahead. 
  The undertaking to build "a wealthy people, a strong 
country, and an equitable and civilized society" is a long-term 
strategic objective that must be implemented step by step. Each 
step must be progress compared with the previous one, or in 
other words, the economy must develop every year, the standards 
of material and cultural life next year must be higher than 
those of this year, and especially, the political and social 
conditions must be more stable and steadfast every year. These 
factors are closely related, therefore they require a high level 
of uniformity in coordination. Our economic policies are 
closely related to social, cultural, and other policies, so our 
party needs a comprehensive, dialectical, objective, and 
scientific viewpoint while directing the implementation of these 
policies. 
  In order to overcome hunger and poverty, to stand firm on 
our 
feet, and to reduce the danger of lagging further behind 
neighboring countries economically, our party should, above all, 
consolidate our combative determination, our political acumen, 
and heighten our knowledge and ability to the level required by 
our duties in the modern age, an age when science and technology 
advance at lightning speed. To fulfill the leadership role, our 
party should be equipped not only with experiences and knowledge 
from working life, but also with experiences and achievements of 
the world. The slogan "Learn, learn more, learn forever" by 
Lenin should encourage us to never stop learning. 
  Our party is the core leader, the center for solidarity, and 
the vanguard of the class and people. To be able to fulfill 
these responsibilities, our party must be in a constant process 
of renovation and rectification, ensure uniformity in politics 
and ideology, endeavor to enhance morality and revolutionary 
characteristics, provide for a clean and healthy life, and to 
combat degradation, deviations, negativity, and illegal 
activities resolutely. Above all, we must not lose our sense of 
political vigilance because the hostile forces are hiding around 
us and are looking for every way to get into our organizations. 
We must not forget that among all kinds of disorientation, the 
political one is the most dangerous. 
  We are opening our doors and expanding our relations and 
cooperation with other countries to develop our economy. But we 
must abide by the unchangeable principles of national 
sovereignty and independence, of our historic traditions, the 
morality and characteristics of our culture. To let ourselves 
become alienated from our origin, or dependent on other 
countries in any area or by any reason, is unacceptable. We 
should not let short-term and partial benefits lead us to sway 
ourselves away from the route that Uncle [Ho] has chosen, the 
route achieved only by countless sacrifices of blood and bone by 
generations of our people, because that will be a virulent error 
that can be disastrous to our country. 
  The administration is the people's servant, and at the same 
time, the tool for the people's authority. The development of 
our country in the current situation is fast-changing, 
diversified, and complicated. The situation requires the state 
mechanism to be capable and assiduous. We must not allow any 
sabotage activities to effect the peaceful life of our people. 
We must be able to control every nook and cranny of our 
society. We must heighten our abilities and acumen, attach 
urgency to training and re-training tasks, and we should exclude 
from the administrative mechanism those who have inadequate 
ability and character. 
  As far as the current national construction cause is 
concerned, as in the sacred wars of resistance for national 
salvation in the past, the people constitute an endless source 
of strength and a decisive factor of victory. To further 
develop the potential, strength, and wisdom of the masses, party 
organizations, administrative organs, departments, sectors, 
agencies, and mass societies affiliated to the Vietnam 
Fatherland Front must renovate their operating procedures a step 
further, attach primary importance to efforts to improve the 
people's living conditions, and regard the motivation campaign 
for political awareness as a long-term goal. Our party comes 
from the people and works untiringly to bring about happiness 
for them. Therefore, party members and cadres must love, 
believe, remain attached to, and direct the people as well as 
look after their well-being, regarding these as the proof of 
their vitality. 
  Dear comrades, the resolution of this midterm party 
conference of the city party organization was formulated in the 
light of the recent Mid-Term National Party Conference and the 
fifth city party organization congress. It was a combination of 
the wisdom, will, and aspirations of the entire party 
organization and compatriots of all walks of life in the city. 
Furthermore, it was adopted at a time when the city has entered 
a period full of great challenges and also of bright prospects. 
  Because this resolution serves as an important action 
program 
for the entire city party organization and compatriots of all 
walks of life in the days ahead, practical measures must be 
worked out to promptly disseminate and concretize it so that it 
can be applied to life and make its presence felt. Following 
this conference, efforts must be made to improve our party 
leadership and organizational skills a step further. It is 
necessary for all party members to strongly develop their 
vanguard role, militancy, determination, will, professionalism, 
and wisdom. Only by so doing can we meet the growing demands of 
the revolutionary undertaking in the city. 
  During his lifetime, Uncle Ho once said: "There must be 10 
measures to carry out a single policy." Speaking at the fifth 
city party organization congress, Comrade Nguyen Van Linh said: 
"It is necessary to attach great importance to implementation 
organization." For us, these instructions remain valuable. The 
reason is that no matter how correct and clearsighted the 
party's ideological concepts, lines, and resolutions may be, 
they are totally meaningless and unable to generate strength if 
they are not applied to real life situations. Then, in the 
final analysis, our words are not matched with our deeds and as 
such, we cannot prove whether our policies and resolutions are 
correct. Therefore, it is very important for us to pay due 
attention to practical activities and regard our willingness to 
engage in practical activities as the peak of our creativeness. 
Many theoreticians have said that the truth can be discovered 
through realities and that only through realities that one can 
prove and foster the truth. The party-initiated renovation 
undertaking has been carried out for many years now. Yet, when 
it first took off, it was based on the actual situations in our 
city and country. 
  We are party members and residents of the city named after 
Uncle Ho. Our city is well-known for its time-honored 
traditions of glorious and unsubmissive struggle and for its 
wisdom, dynamism, and work creativeness. It is certain that our 
entire party organization and compatriots of all walks of life 
in the city will achieve singlemindedness, take firm steps to 
overcome difficulties and challenges, and make every effort to 
score the best results in carrying out the tasks set forth by 
the Seventh Party Congress and the fifth city party organization 
congress, thereby making adequate preparations for marking the 
20th anniversary of national unification and of the liberation 
of the city and the south. 
  Prompted by that firm belief, I would like to declare the 
midterm party conference of the fifth Ho Chi Minh City party 
organization closed. May I avail myself of this opportunity to 
wish our comrade veteran revolutionaries and comrade delegates 
good health and many victories.

  [Text] Hanoi, April 26 (AFP) -- Workers at a private 
clothing firm struck last week in the southern province of Song 
Be, the area most affected by labor unrest in Vietnam, the trade 
union newspaper Lao Dong said Tuesday. 
  Some 150 workers from the Song Be Garment Export Co. stopped 
work for two hours Thursday in favor of overtime payments and 
the lowering of production levels required by management. 
  Company director Le Thi Bich Ngoc, rejected the strikers' 
demands, saying they could resign if they felt they were unable 
to meet the production demands. 
  The strikers plan to stop work again by the end of the week 
if their demands were not met. 
  The latest strike followed similar action earlier this month 
by 2,500 workers at the state-run peanut firm Thanh Le against 
working conditions and low salaries. 
  Labor unrest in southern Vietnam has increased in recent 
months, particularly in companies controlled by foreign firms. 
  Vietnam plans to adopt a labor code in May in which the 
right 
to strike is to be defined for the first time.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- A female legislator of the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] denounced the 
ruling coalition's top strategist, Ichiro Ozawa, on Wednesday 
for regarding women as a "mere tool of sex" in the wake of his 
quip on the creation of a new parliamentary bloc. 
  Tomiko Okazaki, chief of the SDP's intraparty panel on the 
promotion of civic and womens' rights, told a news conference 
that Ozawa's remarks on Monday to reporters reflects "his 
contempt for women." Okazaki was responding to Ozawa's remark 
which defended Monday's abrupt move to create a unified 
parliamentary alliance in the House of Representatives, 
excluding the SDP, that led to the SDP's decision to quit the 
coalition. 
  Comparing the convergence of various political parties to an 
extramarital affair, Ozawa reportedly told reporters at the Diet 
building, "It does not matter which women you may sleep with." 
  "If the SDP felt jealous of the new alliance, they have only 
to come and join us. The SDP is putting up irrational 
resistance," he was quoted as saying. 
  Okazaki, reading from the SDP's press statement, said 
Ozawa's 
remark is full of "discrimination and prejudice as if he 
regarded women as a mere tool of sex." The remark "corresponds 
with the move to create the new parliamentary bloc that violated 
the rules of mutual respect and trust," she said. 
  The SDP pullout from the ruling coalition plunged Japan into 
political chaos, as it risks rendering the new administration of 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata a fragile minority government. 
  Former Chief Cabinet Secretary Mayumi Moriyama and Michiko 
Ishii, head of the women's section of the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), demanded that Ozawa apologize to the 
people for his remarks. Moriyama and Ishii, both House of 
Councillors members of the LDP, made the demand at a news 
conference. 
  Teiko Kihira, an independent upper house member, also issued 
a statement, which said Ozawa's comment is "shameful 
internationally."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- Japan's top opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) urged newly elected Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata on Wednesday [27 April] to give up his 
premiership to take the blame for the current political chaos, 
Diet officials said. LDP President Yohei Kono made the demand 
in his meetings with House of Representatives Speaker Takako Doi 
and House of Councillors President Bunbei Hara, the officials 
said. 
  Kono made the plea to the Diet leaders "as the chiefs of the 
two chambers of the Diet that voted to confer the premiership" 
to Hata in Monday's key parliamentary vote, they said. On 
Monday the Diet voted to pick the successor to outgoing Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  The Diet chiefs told Kono they had already telephoned Hata, 
asking him to speed up the process of forming a new cabinet, the 
officials said. They told Hata his coalition government's 
failure to form a new cabinet, if it is prolonged, would exert a 
negative impact on the livelihood of the people, they said. 
  They quoted Hata as replying that he is ready to make utmost 
efforts to speed up the cabinet formation. 
  The LDP intensified its pressure after the Hata 
administration was thrown into chaos following the announcement 
by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] that it 
will pull out of the coalition following the creation of a new 
parliamentary bloc in the lower chamber, excluding the SDP. 
  The SDP reacted sharply to the emergence of the new 
130-legislator bloc, saying it was not consulted by its 
coalition partners beforehand and that the abrupt move 
represented a Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]-led attempt to 
push it to the sidelines of government. 
  The SDP's withdrawal, unless it is reversed, would strip the 
Hata administration of its governing majority, rendering it as 
Japan's first minority government since 1955.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Emperor Akihito appointed 
Tsutomu Hata prime minister of Japan in a Thursday [28 April] 
morning ceremony at the imperial palace, government officials 
said. The appointment formally made Hata prime minister of 
Japan. 
  Hata was named prime minister in elections in both houses of 
the Diet on Monday. 
  His appointment as prime minister was delayed, however, by 
political unrest sparked by the establishment of a large 
parliamentary coalition grouping that excluded the Social 
Democratic Party, which had been the biggest single party in the 
coalition. The SDP declared early Tuesday it had left the 
coalition. 
  Hata, head of the coalition's core party, Shinseito, will 
form his cabinet later Thursday, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- New Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata formed his cabinet on Thursday to govern Japan with a 
fragile minority government following the walkout of a key 
coalition ally. 
  The cabinet formation came after the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] spurned Hata's eleventh hour bid to 
lure it back into the fold of the coalition following a fray 
over a new parliamentary bloc. 
  Newly appointed Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai 
announced the new cabinet lineup at a news conference. 
  Kumagai dismissed suggestions that the new cabinet is 
dominated by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], led by Hata, a 
core party in the coalition, while acknowledging that the new 
government faces difficulties due to the withdrawal of the SDP. 
  The SDP's withdrawal makes the coalition a minority force in 
both chambers of the Diet. The party had six cabinet posts in 
the eight-month-long administration of former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  The strength of Shinseito shot up to nine portfolios from 
five in the previous cabinet, while Komeito [Clean Government 
Party] gained two more cabinet posts to six. The Democratic 
Socialist Party (DSP) increased its cabinet strength to two from 
one. 
  The pullout raises the specter of an early general election 
if the SDP throws its weight behind a possible LDP move to table 
a no-confidence motion against the Hata administration. 
  Hata, who was elected as premier by the Diet on Monday, was 
ceremonially appointed prime minister by Emperor Akihito earlier 
Thursday. He replaced Hosokawa, whose seven-party majority 
alliance last August ousted the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
from 38 years of unbroken rule. 
  "We took pains in deciding upon the makeup of the new 
cabinet, because the SDP pulled out of the coalition," Kumagai 
of Shinseito said. "We followed the principle of appropriating 
cabinet posts to the most suitable personnel and I believe 
excellent people from each party have been nominated to the 
important cabinet posts," he said. 
  Koji Kakizawa of the Liberal Party, an LDP splinter party, 
became foreign minister, succeeding Hata. 
  Kakizawa told a new conference that of the urgent problems 
to 
be tackled, "Japan wants to improve Japan-U.S. economic 
relations, while playing a responsible part in cooperation with 
the United Nations to have North Korea clear up suspicions over 
its nuclear arms development." 
  Shinseito held key posts in the cabinet. Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii retained his post. Mutsuki Kato assumed the post 
of agriculture, fishery and forestry minister, replacing 
Shinseito's Eijiro Hata, who was shifted to the post of minister 
of international trade and industry, succeeding Kumagai. 
  Hajime Ishii assumed the office of home affairs minister, 
while Shigeto Nagano assumed the office of justice minister, 
replacing Akira Mikazuki, a nonpolitician. Both are Shinseito 
members. 
  From Komeito, chairman Koshiro Ishida retained his portfolio 
as chief of the Management and Coordination Agency and Nobuyuki 
Futami assumed the transport portfolio, while Katsuyuki Hikasa 
took the office of posts and telecommunications minister. Koji 
Morimoto was appointed to the post of construction minister. 
  Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the 
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), also kept his portfolio. 
Atsushi Kanda of the DSP was named the chief of the Defense 
Agency. 
  Kunio Hatoyama, an independent and LDP defector, assumed the 
post of labor minister. 
  Yoshio Terasawa, a House of Councillors member of Hosokawa's 
Japan New Party (JNP) and former vice president of Nomura 
Securities Co, was named to lead the Economic Planning Agency. 
The post was the only one the JNP could keep in the cabinet. 
  The new cabinet will be formally inaugurated following the 
attestation ceremony at the Imperial Agency in the presence of 
Emperor Akihiro. 
  In a meeting between Hata and SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama 
earlier in the day, Hata pleaded with Murayama to rescind a 
decision to pull out of the coalition, coalition officials said. 
  "I apologize for the latest development," Hata was quoted as 
telling Murayama. "It would be tragic if our joint efforts to 
create a new era with the formation of the eight-month coalition 
bogged down." 
  Murayama, emerging from the meeting with Hata, told 
reporters 
his party stuck to its decision to get out of the alliance. The 
determination "has remained unchanged," he said. 
  The SDP walked out from the ruling coalition Tuesday after 
being enraged by the abrupt establishment of a unified 
parliamentary bloc by conservative groups, but excluding the SDP. 
  The parliamentary strength of the coalition, now without the 
backing of the SDP, dropped to 182 members in the powerful 
511-seat lower house -- far short of the 256 seats needed for a 
majority. 
  The LDP, the primary opposition group, has 206 members, 
while 
the SDP has 74 and new party Sakigake, a party that belonged to 
Hosokawa's coalition but has now chosen to support the Hata 
administration from outside the cabinet, has 15 members.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- New Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata on Thursday [28 April] retained Administrative Deputy Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara, who has served for a record 
six years and five months, government officials said. 
  Ishihara, 67, now has worked for six consecutive 
administrations since the launch in November 1987 of a 
government under Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita of the Liberal 
Democratic Party, the officials said. Last April, he broke the 
record of long service at the post of the top administrative 
official. 
  Ishihara wanted to resign but Hata asked him to continue 
because the government has a lot to do, including Diet 
deliberations on the overdue state budget for fiscal 1994, which 
began April 1, and efforts to resume "framework" trade talks 
with the United States, they said. 
  Meanwhile, Hata named Naoto Kitamura, a House of 
Representatives member of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], to 
the post of parliamentary deputy chief cabinet secretary. 
Kitamura, 46, is known as a key aide to Ichiro Ozawa, the most 
powerful strategist of the ruling coalition.

<F P=106> [Question-and-answer session by Chief Cabinet Secretary </F>
Hiroshi Kumagai with unidentified domestic reporters at the 
prime minister's official residence in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Well, now I would like to ask a question 
of the new chief cabinet minister. First of all, as for the new 
cabinet lineup -- well, I will probably ask Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata about this later on -- but it seems that you all 
have indicated that the new chief cabinet secretary should be 
chosen from Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and that you all 
consider yourselves to be loyal to Mr. Ichiro Ozawa. Well, in 
the former administration, there has been much said about the 
relationship between the prime minister and the chief cabinet 
secretary. This time, how do you intend to carry out your 
duties as chief cabinet secretary, which is a key post in the 
cabinet? 
  [Kumagai] Well, considering my own abilities, I feel I have 
been given a very tough job. Considering the current 
circumstances in which the new cabinet is being formed under a 
minority government, I am well aware of the importance of the 
job. I myself joined Shinseito under Mr. Hata, who is the head 
of the party. Even before then, I respected him highly, and I 
have learned very much under his guidance. It is an honor for 
me to be chosen to take on important duties as Prime Minister 
Hata's right-hand man. When it comes to becoming a chief 
cabinet minister, I, in having been a member of the previous 
cabinet, keenly believe that I must fulfill the important duties 
as the coordinator of the cabinet. Nevertheless, I now feel that 
I must do my utmost to bring about changes by having Hata 
politics reflected heavily in the new administration's policies 
and by establishing harmony, even though the current situation 
is very tough. 
  [Reporter] It seems to have been suddenly decided that the 
post of state minister for political reform would be dropped in 
the formation of the latest cabinet. Have you been informed of 
the circumstances leading to this decision? 
  [Kumagai] Well, just as political reform was the task of the 
former administration, I feel it is necessary to keep the flame 
of political reform from going out. However, in reality, the 
actual process of carrying out reform will now be left in the 
hands of the home affairs minister and the Political Reform 
Council. The decision to drop the post does not at all mean 
that political reform issues will be neglected. It merely means 
that we have judged that the chariot of political reform can now 
be pulled by one horse rather than two. 
  [Reporter] I now would like to question you as chief cabinet 
secretary regarding your position as chief adviser on the 
formation of the cabinet. Looking at the new cabinet lineup, it 
seems that it has a lot of members from Shinseito. How do you 
feel about this? 
  [Kumagai] Well, this does not mean that Shinseito dominates 
the cabinet. Because the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] has pulled out from the coalition alliance, I must 
frankly say that it was very difficult to come up with a new 
cabinet lineup. It was done in a manner in which the 
appropriate people were appointed to the appropriate posts. I 
feel that these people were picked from each party to fill 
important posts. 
  [Unidentified moderator] Go ahead if you have a question. 
  [Reporter] May I? There are some who feel strongly that the 
new administration will be shortlived because the ruling parties 
have become a minority. How do you, as chief cabinet secretary, 
feel about this? 
  [Kumagai] Well, frankly speaking, I feel that it was 
desirable to continue to spend more time trying to persuade the 
SDPJ to remain in the coalition to maintain a strong majority. 
On the other hand, however, as indicated by the recent airliner 
accident, conditions in the nation are continually changing. In 
particular, important issues such as the state of the domestic 
economy and Japanese-U.S. trade negotiations have been piling 
up, as a matter of fact. For the Japanese people, there must no 
longer be any more delay in conducting the affairs of 
government. We made our decision under such pressing 
circumstances. We now plan to make our utmost efforts in 
tackling the affairs of government, including the enactment of 
the budget bill. At the same time, however, we plan to continue 
to make sincere efforts to persuade the members of the SDPJ and 
other parties to join us in forming a strong majority coalition 
government. Next person; go ahead. 
  [Reporter] Glancing at the cabinet lineup, it seems that a 
majority of the cabinet ministers used to be members of the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] only a year ago. This includes 
the prime minister himself. I feel that this is not very 
different from past LDP administrations. How do you feel about 
this? 
  Well, I do not think these people account for a majority 
of the new cabinet lineup, but this has happened because the 
SDPJ has left the coalition. However, everyone of them have, in 
a sense, staked their lives on political reform and acted in 
accordance. Therefore, even though they were formerly members 
of the LDP -- I myself was one of them -- we feel it is not 
correct to say the new lineup is not very different from past 
LDP administrations. Instead, we hope that each of them will 
serve their respective roles in helping to bring about reforms. 
Go ahead. 
  [Reporter] I would like to question you as a minister in 
charge of issues relating to women. Yesterday, Shinseito 
Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa told reporters in the Diet 
building that -- although it is difficult for me to say this -- 
regarding the issue of which parties should join forces, 
something to the effect that "it does not matter which women you 
sleep with." That drew heavy criticism yesterday from female 
Diet members from a number of parties and [words indistinct]. 
How do you feel about this as a minister in charge of issues 
relating to women, and also as a fellow member of Shinseito? 
  [Kumagai] Frankly speaking, I do not have all the facts. I 
also want to refrain from making any remarks that might create a 
misunderstanding. Generally speaking, however, my job as 
minister in charge of issues relating to women implies 
establishing a society in which both men and women participate 
in cooperative planning. Speaking for all of us on the basis of 
our self-examination, we feel men and women are equal, and they 
should work together in harmony. Actually, I feel Japanese women 
nowadays have become much stronger than men in sports and other 
fields. In that sense, I feel comments should be made in line 
with the principle of equality between the sexes. 
  [Reporter] Do you not feel Ozawa's comments were 
inappropriate? 
  [Kumagai] Well, I do not know all the facts. To be honest 
with you, if I make any comment on his remarks, it would cause a 
misunderstanding. Generally speaking, men and women are equal. 
  [Reporter] The former Management and Coordination Agency 
director general has spoken of the dual structure of power. What 
will happen to the relationship between the cabinet, the ruling 
coalition parties, and the meeting of representatives of the 
ruling coalition parties? 
  [Kumagai] It goes without saying that the top leader of the 
cabinet is the prime minister, and I think the prime minister is 
the one who should make the final decision. Since Japan adopts 
the parliamentary government system, the prime minister cannot 
be a dictator. Our ruling coalition parties have the process of 
seeking areas of agreement among them. I believe it is important 
for our ruling coalition parties to hold debates openly and 
heatedly. From that sense, our ruling coalition parties should 
seek a soul-searching when they need to do so. Before and after 
I joined Shinseito, I have acted according to principles and 
stated my view without hesitation. 
  [Reporter] Looking at the lineup of the Hata cabinet, unlike 
the Hosokawa cabinet that listed the position titles of its 
members like Koshiro Ishida, chairman of Komeito, and Keigo 
Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, the Hata 
cabinet does not list their position titles, but lists only 
their parliamentary affiliations like members of the lower house 
or the upper house. 
  [Kumagai] That is not true. The Hata cabinet correctly lists 
their position titles like this [holds up several sheets of 
paper].

<F P=106> [News conference by newly appointed Foreign Minister Koji </F>
Kakizawa with unidentified domestic correspondents at the prime 
minister's official residence in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] [unidentified official] Next we will have a news 
conference with newly appointed Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, 
chairman of the Liberal Party. 
  [Kakizawa] I am Koji Kakizawa, and I was just appointed 
foreign minister. Although our cabinet is a minority coalition 
government, it embarks under difficult circumstances. I will 
work hard to fulfill my duties while maintaining teamwork and 
assisting Prime Minister Hata. 
  The international situation is now undergoing profound 
changes, and there are many issues Japan is pressed to resolve. 
Japan has to repair soured relations with the United States and 
play a proper role in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan is also 
being asked to make broad-ranging contributions in various 
fields. 
  I intend to work for Japan's aggressive role in maintaining 
world peace and promoting world prosperity. Breaking the 
deadlock over Japan-U.S. economic relations is one of the urgent 
issues. I also think Japan should fulfill its responsibility to 
clear up suspicions about North Korea's development of nuclear 
weapons and should cooperate with activities of the 
international community and the United Nations. 
  Now that Japan's role in the international community is 
attracting world attention, I would like to make Japan a 
trustworthy and respectable country within the international 
community. At the same time, we should seek the people's 
understanding and should assist Prime Minister Hata. I would 
like to solicit your cooperation. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] A major difference between 
Japan's foreign policy under the coalition government compared 
with that of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is that the 
coalition government candidly admitted Japan's responsibility 
for the past war. The coalition government has also apologized 
to South Korea for Japan's colonial rule. Minister Kakizawa, 
you served as parliamentary vice foreign minister under former 
Foreign Minister Watanabe. What do you think of the admittance 
and apology made by the coalition government? How are you going 
to deal with Japan's war history? 
  [Kakizawa] In his policy speech to the Diet last August, 
former Prime Minister Hosokawa made a statement to that effect. 
With regard to Japan's acts of aggression against Asian nations 
and the pain the Koreans suffered under Japanese colonial rule, 
I share their pain and will do everything I can to address them, 
always keeping his statement in mind. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Kakizawa, you said on 18 April 
that you intended to back Michio Watanabe as prime minister. It 
has been said you quit the LDP in order to make Watanabe prime 
minister. What do you think of Watanabe now? It has been said 
you have been asked along with other LDP members to break away 
from the party on the promise you would be appointed foreign 
minister. Would you answer? 
  [Kakizawa] Your question is totally groundless. I respect 
Watanabe as a politician in present political circles with 
profound perceptions and leadership. After Hosokawa announced 
his resignation as prime minister, I considered the need to 
rally politicians who share the same policies, forming a new 
cabinet that transcends the pro-LDP and anti-LDP framework. 
Forming such a cabinet will greatly serve to reconstruct 
politics and realign the political parties in Japan. With that 
belief in my mind, I have worked hard toward that end. Japan's 
second political reform and second realignment of the political 
parties is about to begin. I have formed the Liberal Party 
after concluding that I have to act now. From now on, together 
with my colleagues I will work toward realigning the political 
parties, not caring for the present framework of the political 
parties. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Minister, many people feel that 
the Hata cabinet is a minority coalition government and will be 
short-lived. What is your comment? 
  [Kakizawa] As a minority coalition government, our cabinet 
will embark under difficult circumstances. Our cabinet has to 
handle the fiscal 1994 budget which is the backbone of our 
economic stimulus measures. It should do everything in its 
power to get the budget passed in the Diet. Both the ruling and 
opposition parties should cooperate with each other to pass the 
budget for the sake of the people. As foreign minister, I am 
not in charge of handling the budget, but as a member of the 
Hata cabinet I intend to work for the passage of the budget in 
the Diet while assisting the prime minister. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Minister, there is a view that 
it would be difficult to get the Diet to ratify an Uruguay Round 
accord on rice. What do you think? 
  [Kakizawa] With regard to a set of accords hammered out at 
the Uruguay Round, former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign 
Minister Hata formally signed them in Marrakech. My 
understanding is that there will be domestic problems with 
putting those accords into effect. However, our cabinet will 
seek the people's understanding of Japan's commitment to fulfill 
its international promises while pursuing an agricultural policy 
that can open a bright future for farmers. I believe 
parliamentary ratification of the rice accord is a necessary 
process of building Japan into a nation that can live together 
with other nations. Our cabinet is ready to listen humbly to 
anyone's views.

<F P=106> [News conference by Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii with </F>
unidentified correspondents at the prime minister's official 
residence in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] [Fujii] I have just been appointed as finance 
minister by Prime Minister Hata. Because I also served as 
finance minister in the Hosokawa cabinet, this is my second 
appointment to the post, and I am ready to assume this post 
again. 
  I would like to briefly review urgent issues first. As a 
result of the recent 15.25 trillion-yen economic package, bright 
spots can now be observed in the economy, although it is still 
in a very delicate stage. To achieve full economic recovery, it 
is necessary for the government to steadily implement this 
comprehensive economic package. The package includes a tax 
reduction plan worth 6 trillion yen, including 5.5 trillion-yen 
in income tax cuts. I am very grateful that Diet members have 
shown their understanding about this tax reduction plan, and 
have endorsed relevant bills. Now that the new government has 
been inaugurated, I will ask Diet members to start deliberations 
on the fiscal 1994 budget. 
  This economic package also has to deal with bad assets owned 
by financial institutions because assets inflation is still 
causing distortions in the economy. Although we do not have 
figures for the period ending March, I think inflation has begun 
to abate. We will make further efforts to bring inflation to a 
halt. 
  Next, as the new prime minister has said, we will promote 
economic reforms by inheriting reform measures from the former 
government. I think economic reforms are very important for the 
future society and economy. One of the important reforms is to 
establish an economic structure in which Japan can cooperate 
with other countries through promoting deregulation, market 
liberalization, the review of industrial structure, and other 
measures. As far as the Finance Ministry is concerned, we have 
to actively promote deregulation in the insurance and monetary 
markets. 
  It is also very important that we establish an economic 
structure that helps smoothly integrate a society of longevity 
into Japan's society and economy. Of course, this is related to 
issues concerning employment, regional societies, lifetime 
education, and others. The Finance Ministry will promote 
welfare policies to cover medical care, pensions, and nursing. 
I think it is very important for the government to work out 
measures to put burdens equally on the people to promote the 
policies. Because it is no longer allowed to put heavier 
burdens on working people, the former government decided to cut 
an income tax, and considered increasing a consumption tax. It 
is important to establish a structure in which the nation can 
easily deal with the aging society while imposing light burdens 
on working people. Of course, in parallel with this issue, the 
government has to tackle such issues as promoting administrative 
reform, and revising inequalities in the tax system. That is all 
I want to say. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Fujii, since you have been named the finance 
minister again, you continue to be in charge of the budget. 
Because the Hata cabinet is a minority ruling government, it 
will have rough going. What do you think of the new cabinet, 
which is said to be short-lived? 
  [Fujii] As you said, the new cabinet is a minority ruling 
government. But because the 1994 budget was compiled by many 
people, including cabinet ministers who are not joining the new 
cabinet, I think the budget has many points the largest 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party can agree on. We will exert 
utmost efforts to have the 1994 budget passed by seeking the 
cooperation of the opposition parties, including the Liberal 
Democratic Party. 
  [Reporter] The office of former Prime Minister Hosokawa 
recently announced that the former premier had failed to declare 
3 million-yen income. What do you think of Hosokawa's sense of 
obligation to pay taxes? Also, what do you think of the popular 
opinion that taxation on politicians is not severe? 
  [Fujii] First, I would like to say that it is people's 
obligation to pay taxes. In particular, those who are engaged 
in politics have to strictly fulfill this obligation. Although 
I am entrusting the National Tax Administration Agency with 
taxation, I want to stress that we should never be lenient 
toward politicians. The ultimate and only goal for the Tax 
Administration Agency is to carry out taxation equally to 
everyone in accordance with the law. I want to stress this goal 
will not change in any instance. 
  [Reporter] I would like to ask about the current economic 
situation. The yen surged to 102 today. You mentioned 
international cooperation, but do you think Japan can deal with 
this issue in cooperation with the United States? 
  [Fujii] As I have repeatedly said in the Diet, I would like 
to refrain from mentioning a specific level of yen exchange 
rate. But at G-7 meetings in Washington last September and in 
Frankfurt in February this year, and at the recent meeting in 
Washington, I asserted that overly rapid foreign exchange 
movements in one country are not only undesirable for the 
nation's economy but also have negative effects on the world 
economy. I believe G-7 finance leaders have a common 
understanding about this. Therefore, we must respond to overly 
rapid foreign exchange movements. And the level of exchange 
rates should reflect the fundamentals of a nation's economy. As 
G-7 nations have repeatedly said, we must promote policy 
coordination in various fields. I think this is a common 
understanding. With this stand, I will deal with the issue you 
have mentioned. 
  [Unidentified dean of press corps] Thank you very much. 
  [Fujii] Thank you.

<F P=106> [News conference by newly appointed Minister of </F>
International Trade and Industry Eijiro Hata with unidentified 
correspondents at the prime minister's official residence in 
Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] I am Eijiro Hata. I was appointed to the post of 
minister of international trade and industry. First, I would 
like to express my appreciation for the guidance given to me 
when I was agriculture, forestry and fisheries minister. As you 
know, we are in a very severe economic situation and have to 
deal with many issues. We need to play a responsible economic 
role in the international arena to improve our reliability. 
Moreover, we need to deal with other issues as well -- 
including the issue of economic cooperation between Japan and 
the United States, and the issue of easing government 
regulations. Now that I have been appointed to the post of 
minister of international trade and industry, I will use all my 
energy to deal with these issues. While seeking people's 
understanding, I will make strenuous efforts to accomplish these 
tasks. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Some people are saying that the new 
administration will have difficulties in conducting state 
affairs and will be short-lived because it is backed by a 
minority ruling coalition. Can you explain what you think of 
this situation? 
  [Hata] I think our major task is to gain support from the 
people as we make a series of movements for political reform and 
other matters. We need to do that by implementing policies 
which will be understood and supported by the people. The 
opposition parties, if they deal with various matters in a 
gentlemanly manner, will also be able to gain understanding and 
support from the people as healthy opposition parties. While 
settling these issues, I think we have to build a stable 
foundation to enable the new cabinet to fulfill the 
responsibilities it is expected to fulfill. 
  [Unidentified reporter] It seems that the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] is in a chaotic 
situation because former MITI Minister Kumagai fired an 
influential deputy MITI bureau chief. How are you going to mend 
the situation within MITI? 
  [Hata] I do not know the details. However, the purpose of 
personnel reshuffle is, in a way, to renew people's minds. I 
think such a purpose is being achieved.

<F P=106> [News conference by newly appointed Defense Agency [DA] </F>
Director General Atsushi Kanda with unidentified domestic 
correspondents at the prime minister's official residence in 
Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] [Unidentified official]. We will now have a news 
conference with Defense Agency Director General Atsushi Kanda. 
  [Kanda] I am Atsushi Kanda, and I was just appointed 
director general of the Defense Agency. 
  The situation facing Japan is tough. With the end of the 
Cold War, an era of disarmament has begun. In particular, the 
issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons 
was taken up at a session of the UN Security Council, and the 
Security Council is about to decide on various measures. Japan 
should deal properly with the issue, taking the tough situation 
into account. In the future, I will work hard toward Japan's 
defense buildup. I would like to solicit your cooperation. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Under the present 
interpretation of the Constitution, [words indistinct] cannot be 
acknowledged. In its party convention, the Democratic Socialist 
Party [DSP] has decided such a constitutional interpretation was 
incorrect. What is your opinion? 
  [Kanda] The people have a variety of views regarding the 
Constitution. As for the DSP, it has never made such a 
decision. I think it is appropriate to deal with things within 
the scope of the Constitution for the time being. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] It is said that since the Hata 
cabinet is a minority coalition government, it will last 
approximately two months. What is your opinion? 
  [Kanda] It may not necessarily become a stable 
administration. However, I will do my best to enable this 
cabinet to become a full-fledged administration and to respond 
to the people's expectations. I intend to work hard to 
successfully fulfill my duties. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Viewing the Hata cabinet, it 
consists mainly of Komeito members and others who were formerly 
affiliated with the Liberal Democratic Party. 
  [Kanda] DSP Chairman Ouchi is a member of the Hata cabinet. 
The important things are what measures the coalition cabinet 
undertakes and how it makes the people understand what it does. 
Therefore, I do not care who participates in the Hata cabinet. 
As for myself, I intend to work hard to carry out my duties.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- The leader of the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) described the newly formed cabinet of 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata Thursday [28 April] as a pseudo 
Liberal Democratic Party government. SDP chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama said, "I am worried that (the minority government) will 
strengthen its character as a pseudo LDP government." 
  The leader of the second largest opposition party told 
reporters the party will cooperate for passage of the overdue 
state budget for fiscal 1994, but judge other bills on their own 
merit. 
  Murayama rejected Hata's last-minute plea to return to the 
ruling coalition earlier in the day. The party decided Tuesday 
to withdraw from the coalition over an abrupt creation of a 
joint parliamentary bloc by coalition groups in the House of 
Representatives excluding the SDP. 
  Asked whether the SDP will force the government to dissolve 
the lower house for a snap general election after passage of the 
budget, Murayama showed a cautious attitude, saying a political 
vacuum should not be created in view of the current economic 
situation.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- New Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Hiroshi Kumagai served as minister of international trade and 
industry under the previous cabinet of Morihiro Hosokawa, the 
predecessor of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  Kumagai, 53, a member of the coalition's core party, 
Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), is known as a right-hand man of 
Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito secretary general and the coalition's 
primary strategist. He replaces Masayoshi Takemura, head of New 
Party Sakigake (Harbinger), as the chief government spokesman 
and the chief of staff to Hata, who heads Shinseito. 
  His appointment to the post reflected Hata's intention to 
secure a chief government spokesman from among Shinseito's 
members, who all know him well. 
  Relations between Takemura and Hosokawa, head of the Japan 
New Party, were sour between last December and the time of the 
collapse of the coalition government, chiefly because of 
differences over government policies. 
  Sakigake, a member of the previous seven-party coalition, 
decided not to seek a post in the new coalition government and 
instead to offer support from outside the group. 
  Kumagai is known as a tough, hard-nosed politician, who is 
unequivocal about what Japan should say and do in its economic 
ties with the United States. Some describe his character as 
pugnacious because he always appears ready for a fight. 
  But the latest round of the so-called trade "framework" 
talks 
with Washington, in which he kept his cool when the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) was severely criticized 
as a major foot dragger on the bilateral talks, has shown that 
there are other sides to his character. 
  Under the Hosokawa administration, Kumagai emphasized the 
importance of Tokyo devising viable and effective plans in the 
macroeconomic and microeconomic fields to ease U.S. frustration 
with the slow progress in opening Japan's markets. 
  Kumagai shows a tendency to cause waves. He recently forced 
the resignation of a senior MITI official, tipped as the 
strongest new candidate for the prestigious post of 
administrative vice trade minister, because the official had 
handed another bureaucrat a promotion immediately before he was 
about to run in a parliamentary election. The disciplinary 
action was criticized by the bureaucracy which regarded it as 
political interference in its personnel affairs. 
  Hailing from Shizuoka Prefecture, Kumagai joined MITI in 
1964, as a career bureaucrat, upon graduation from Hitotsubashi 
University. In 1974-1975, Kumagai was sent to Harvard 
University. 
  He left MITI in 1975 and ran in the House of Councillors 
election as a candidate of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 
the then ruling party of Japan, and won an upper house seat. 
Kumagai shifted to the House of Representatives in 1983. 
  When Hata and Ozawa defected from the LDP to form Shinseito 
in the summer of 1993, during the political turmoil over 
electoral reforms, Kumagai immediately joined them. 
  Kumagai has been elected to the powerful lower house for 
four 
times.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Newly appointed Foreign 
Minister Koji Kakizawa is head of the new party "Jiyuto" 
(Liberal Party), a coalition bloc, and is credited for his 
expertise in financial and foreign affairs. Kakizawa, 60, 
replaced Tsutomu Hata in the post, the latter having been 
elected as prime minister. 
  Conversant in both English and French, he has demonstrated 
great interest in foreign affairs, having served as chairman of 
the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee in 1990 
and as parliamentary vice foreign minister from 1991 to 1993 
under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. 
  During that latter stint, he visited Mozambique to pave the 
way for deployment of Japanese U.N. peacekeepers there, while he 
represented Japan at a meeting of the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) post-ministerial conference. He has shown 
a particular interest in Myanmar [Burma], having visited the 
country and met with top junta leaders. 
  After graduating from Tokyo University, Kakizawa served for 
years as a Finance Ministry bureaucrat and spent time as an 
intern at the French Finance Ministry in Paris and a diplomat at 
the Japanese Embassy in Belgium. He ended his career as a 
bureaucrat in 1977 when he successfully ran for a seat in the 
House of Councillors as a candidate for the new Liberal Club, a 
splinter party from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  In 1980, he was elected to the first of five terms in the 
House of Representatives. The following year he left the new 
Liberal Club, which disbanded in 1986, all of its former members 
rejoining the LDP. 
  After joining the LDP, he belonged to a faction led by 
former 
Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe and worked on foreign, defense 
and financial affairs. 
  Kakizawa launched the Liberal Party on April 20 along with 
five other LDP defectors and one independent amid the political 
turmoil sparked by the declaration of former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa on April 8 that he would resign. 
  Kakizawa, hailing from Tokyo's No. 6 constituency, has been 
elected to the lower house five times.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Hirohisa Fujii retained 
his post as finance minister determined to get the fiscal 1994 
budget enacted and to press ahead with economic reform. 
  In the cabinet of Morihiro Hosokawa, Fujii championed a 
national welfare tax that was later scrapped, while opposing a 
proposal to introduce deficit-financing government bonds. The 7 
percent welfare tax plan was intended to replace the current 3 
percent consumption tax. 
  The plan met strong opposition from the Social Democratic 
Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] -- the largest force in the 
Hosokawa coalition -- and was dumped the day after Hosokawa 
announced it in early February. 
  As a compromise, the ruling parties agreed to implement 
income tax cuts for one year only and financed by deficit bonds. 
Further tax reform measures are scheduled before the end of the 
year. 
  On the political front, Fujii faced tough questioning from 
the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) over questionable political 
donations from a salt wholesalers' association which falls under 
the jurisdiction of the Finance Ministry. Because of this, it 
had been expected that Fujii would be replaced. 
  Other lingering problems for Fujii include prolonged 
economic 
recession and trade friction with the United States. Fujii 
recently said the economy is in a "delicate phase" and expressed 
confidence that the latest 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package 
coupled with the fiscal 1994 budget will "greatly" help put the 
economy on the path to full recovery. 
  While trying to take fiscal steps to boost domestic demand, 
Fujii repeatedly has tried to convince the United States that 
Japan intends to enact full-scale tax reform by the end of the 
year. The coalition parties are to detail the year-end tax 
reform package by June, fulfilling a government pledge in March. 
  Fujii, 61, won a seat in the lower House of Representatives 
last year as a member of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. He 
defended the lower house seat once as a LDP member after moving 
from his twice-elected seat in the upper House of Councillors. 
  Fujii is known as the right arm of Shinseito strategist 
Ichiro Ozawa, with the left arm being International Trade and 
Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai. 
  Born in Tokyo, Fujii served as a career Finance Ministry 
bureaucrat after graduating from Tokyo University before 
starting his political carrier.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- New Justice Minister 
Shigeto Nagano of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] is a former 
chief of staff of the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF). He 
replaced Akira Mikazuki, a distinguished academic, as justice 
minister. 
  Nagano, 71, graduated from the former elite Japanese 
Military 
Academy and assumed the post of first lieutenant in the Japanese 
Imperial Army in 1945 when World War II ended. 
  He entered the police reserve force in 1951, which was 
upgraded to the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) in 1954. Before 
retiring from the GSDF in 1980, he was promoted to the top 
uniform rank. 
  Nagano won his first seat in the House of Councillors in the 
1986 election for which he had run as a candidate of the then 
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). He is now serving as an 
upper house member for the second six-year term. 
  In June 1993, he joined other LDP defectors to set up 
Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), which two months later formed 
the coalition government with six other non-LDP parties. 
  Nagano comes from Oita Prefecture on Kyushu Island in 
western 
Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- New International Trade 
and Industry (MITI) Minister Eijiro Hata served an event-filled 
term as agriculture, fishery and forests minister in the 
previous administration of Hata's predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Hata, 65, who broke away from the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) last June, is one of the founding members of Shinseito 
(Japan Renewal Party). He succeeded Hiroshi Kumagai of 
Shinseito, who was appointed to chief cabinet secretary. 
  During his previous trial-by-fire term, he was confronted 
with such knotty problems as a severe cold spell that damaged 
the country's rice crop and paved the way for the government's 
decision to partially open the country's rice market. He was 
also at the helm of the ministry when Japan joined the United 
States and the European Union in concluding a long-in-coming 
Uruguay Round agreement covering agriculture. 
  One time during his term, amid coalition party wrangling, 
Hata is said to have resolved to resign and to have packed up 
his belongings for departure from his ministry office. 
  When an LDP censure motion was presented in the House of 
Councillors, Hata demonstrated great composure. The motion was 
rejected. 
  Hata subsequently threw himself into the promotion of 
emergency measures to improve the agricultural situation. He is 
highly-regarded within the ministry for his forward-looking 
attitude and tactfulness. 
  As the head of MITI, he is expected to steer Japan's trade 
policy, which faces difficult problems such as trade relations 
with the United States. 
  Elected to the House of Representatives six times from Oita 
Prefecture on Kyushu Island, where he was mayor of a small town, 
Hata is particularly known for his work in the field of posts 
and telecommunications. He was instrumental in the 
privatization of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) in 
1985.

an active role in the ruling parties to draft 1994 budget bills 
and a tax reform plan. 
  Hikasa replaced Takenori Kanzaki, his comrade in Komeito.

  He has been elected a House of Representatives legislator 
four times from the No. 1 constituency in Okayama Prefecture.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Newly appointed Science 
and Technology Agency Chief Mikio Omi is known to have 
interpellated 488 times at the Diet, the largest number among 
all lawmakers. The record number of interpellators came from 
his belief that legislators should be spokespersons for the 
people. 
  Omi, 58, is a House of Representatives legislator of Komeito 
[Clean Government Party] backed by the Buddhist group Soka 
Gakkai, an influential party in the coalition government. He 
succeeded Satsuki Eda of the United Social Democratic Party 
(USDP). 
  Some party members said he is earnest and warmhearted. 
  Born and brought up in Osaka, Omi has been elected from the 
No.3 constituency in Osaka Prefecture nine times since 1967, but 
he has not held any conspicuous post in the party. 
  In 1967, the third Komeito Chairman Yoshikatsu Takeiri, the 
forth Chairman Junya Yano and the fifth and current Chairman 
Koshiro Ishida were also elected lower house members for the 
first time.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Newly appointed Labor 
Minister Kunio Hatoyama has a prominent family background in 
politics. 
  His great-grandfather Kazuo Hatoyama was a former lower 
house 
speaker, while his late grandfather Ichiro Hatoyama served as 
prime minister and his late father Iichiro was foreign minister. 
His elder brother Kunio is a lower house lawmaker who has 
served as deputy chief cabinet secretary. 
  Hatoyama, 45, an independent House of Representatives 
legislator, replaces Chikara Sakaguchi of Komeito [Clean 
Government Party] as labor minister. 
  After graduating from Tokyo University, Hatoyama became 
secretary to the late former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. He 
won a lower house seat as an independent and later joined the 
LDP. 
  He was noted for crossing party lines to vote against the 
LDP 
government's abortive first attempt to introduce the consumption 
tax. 
  During the first administration of then Prime Minister 
Kiichi 
Miyazawa of the LDP from November 1991 to December 1992, 
Hatoyama served as education minister and proposed scrapping 
examinations prepared by the private firms, on the grounds the 
exams encouraged excessive competition among students to go to 
higher educational facilities. 
  He left the LDP in 1992 as the party's then largest faction 
led by former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita broke up. 
  Hatoyama has been elected to the lower chamber six times.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Newly appointed National 
Land Agency Chief Megumu Sato is known to have refused to 
sanction the execution of death row inmates when he was justice 
minister for about a year from December 1990. Sato, 70, has 
advocated that Japan should abolish the death penalty. 
  Sato, a House of Representatives legislator of Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], a core political party in the coalition 
government led by new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, is also a 
Buddhist priest. 
  Japan, one of the few remaining developed countries with 
capital punishment, had not executed death row inmates for three 
years and four months from November 1989, but resumed hanging 
last year, putting three people to death in March and four in 
November. 
  Sato has been elected to the House of Representatives nine 
times since 1969 from the sixth constituency of Osaka 
Prefecture. Before becoming a politician, he was a bureaucrat 
at the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and later served as 
posts and telecommunications minister from 1984 to 1985. 
  He was a member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) -- the 
former ruling party now in opposition -- until last summer and 
once belonged to the LDP faction of late former Prime Minister 
Kakuei Tanaka. 
  Sato quit the LDP last June and formed Shinseito with other 
defectors including Hata. 
  His late father had served as Defense Agency chief and Osaka 
governor.
