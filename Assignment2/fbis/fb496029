Affairs Minister Hajime Ishii played a major role in enacting 
political reform bills as the head of the House of 
Representatives Special Committee on Political Reform. Ishii, 
59, succeeded Kanju Sato of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
[of Japan -- SDPJ]. 
  A senior member of the coalition's core party Shinseito 
(Japan Renewal Party), Ishii served as director general of the 
National Land Agency under an administration of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP). He joined Shinseito as new Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata and Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's chief 
strategist, launched the party last year after bolting from the 
LDP, then the ruling party. 
  As an LDP legislator, Ishii held the posts of parliamentary 
vice labor minister and transport minister. 
  In 1977, he led a government mission to Dhaka, Bangladesh, 
where he negotiated with the hijackers of a Japan Airlines plane. 
  Currently, Ishii is chairman of a Friendship Association 
made 
up of parliamentarians of Japan and North Korea. 
  Ishii, who has studied in the United States, has a good 
working command of English. 
  Hailing from Hyogo Prefecture in western Japan, Ishii has 
been elected to the powerful House of Representatives eight 
times.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Newly appointed 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Mutsuki Kato, a 
veteran legislator of the House of Representatives, is known for 
his expertise on tax and financial policies. 
  Kato, 67, a member of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), 
replaced Eijiro Hata of the same party. He left the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) last year to join the coalition's 
mainstream conservative and the LDP's breakaway party Shinseito, 
which was founded by Tsutomu Hata, new prime minister, and 
Ichiro Ozawa, the alliance's primary strategist. 
  Kato is known to be close to Ozawa. 
  In the LDP, Kato held such ministerial portfolios as Land 
Agency, Hokkaido Development Agency and agriculture. He formed 
his own group in 1991 after seceding from a major LDP faction 
led by Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, a veteran legislator who has held the 
posts of foreign, trade and transport ministers. 
  Kato also headed the LDP's Policy Affairs Council and 
Research Council on Tax System. 
  On political realignment, Kato shares a similar view with 
Ozawa, who is urging a two-party system, in which a unity party 
of coalition blocs rivals the LDP. 
  Kato, hailing from Okayama Prefecture, western Japan, has 
been elected to the powerful House of Representatives ten times.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Gender equality advocate 
Ryoko Akamatsu retained her portfolio as education minister and 
is expected to continue her campaign for greater recognition of 
women's rights. 
  Akamatsu, 64, who has served as director general of the 
Labor 
Ministry's Women's Bureau, once remarked that the lack of a 
woman on Sumo's Yokozuna Promotion Council is "strange" and has 
called for equality in the government's system of conferring 
decorations. 
  Since becoming education minister last August, Akamatsu has 
worked to overcome some of the ministry's conservative 
administrative policies based on decades of Liberal Democratic 
Party guidance. She once remarked that she "shuddered" at the 
rule in junior high schools requiring boys to have their hair 
closely cropped, touching off a public debate over the issue and 
other school policies seen as restrictive by educational 
reformers. 
  An Osaka native, Akamatsu graduated from Tokyo University to 
begin her career in the Labor Ministry in 1953. 
  In 1978, she was put in charge of women's issues at the 
Prime 
Minister's Office and the same year was appointed minister at 
the Japanese mission to the United Nations. 
  Akamatsu was government representative to the 34th U.N. 
General Assembly that signed a pact abolishing discrimination 
against women and in Japan worked to enact legislation on equal 
employment opportunities for women in May 1985. She became 
Japan's second woman ambassador in 1986 when she was sent to 
Uruguay, where she served until 1989.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Retained Management and 
Coordination Agency [RMCA] Director General Koshiro Ishida is 
expected to keep on tackling administrative reform centering on 
economic deregulation, which the United States has urged to 
reduce the huge imbalance in bilateral trade. 
  Ishida is the 63-year-old chairman of Komeito [Clean 
Government Party], the third-largest ruling coalition party, 
backed by the Buddhist group Soka Gakkai. His agency supervises 
state administration and takes charge of promoting economic 
deregulation. 
  Komeito's connection with Soka Gakkai was called into 
question at the Diet when the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party quizzed Ishida over constitutional issues. The 
Constitution bans the state and its organs from conducting 
religious activities. 
  Ishida and Party Secretary General Yuichiro Ichikawa, the 
coalition's major strategist, have led Komeito for nearly five 
years. 
  Born in Hokkaido, Ishida started his Komeito career as an 
employee of Soka Gakkai's official newspaper after graduating 
from the Commerce Science Department of Meiji University. He 
comes from a family which has close relations with Soka Gakkai, 
one of the most successful religious movements in postwar Japan. 
  He was elected to the House of Representatives for the first 
time from the No. 6 constituency in Aichi Prefecture in 1967, 
the year Komeito first entered the lower house and voters have 
returned him nine more times. 
  He assumed the post of party chairman in 1989 following the 
resignation of former Chairman Junya Yano over his alleged 
involvement in the Recruit "stock-for-favors" scandal and other 
corruption cases involving the party's Diet members. The new 
chairman, however, met with setbacks both in the House of 
Councillors election in 1989 and the House of Representatives 
election in 1990, and was forced to change the party's direction 
and take a more centrist course. 
  In April 1990, Ishida made Komeito's position clear as a 
leading centrist party, distancing itself from reformist forces 
headed by the Social Democratic Party. By forming a union with 
another centrist force, the Democratic Socialist Party, Ishida 
cooperated skillfully with the then ruling Liberal Democratic 
Party in handling important issues in Diet debate. 
  In 1992, he played a key role in pushing a bill through the 
Diet that allows Japan to dispatch Self-Defense Forces personnel 
overseas to join in U.N. peacekeeping operations.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Health and Welfare 
Minister Keigo Ouchi is expected to continue pushing for a 
thorough reform of the social security system to cope with 
Japan's aging society. 
  The 64-year-old chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party 
(DSP) shared former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's vision of 
a welfare society. However, he was strongly opposed to 
Hosokawa's surprise proposal in February to introduce a "7 
percent national welfare tax" on grounds the coalition parties 
were not consulted first. 
  The tax plan designed to partly finance tax cuts was 
scrapped 
the day after Hosokawa announced it. 
  Ouchi once called for a tie-up with Hosokawa's Japan New 
Party and new party Sakigake (Harbinger). He also said he 
favors a multiparty system but less than the current number, 
along with the coalition's leading Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
[of Japan -- SDPJ] and new party Sakigake, while Shinseito 
(Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito [Clean Government Party], the 
alliance's two core blocs, are urging coalition partners to 
consolidate into one party to fight the main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP). 
  Ouchi, however, joined a new parliamentary group called 
"Kaishin" (Innovation), which was formed at his suggestion hours 
after Tsutomu Hata was elected new prime minister. The group 
comprises members of Shinseito, the Japan New Party of Hosokawa, 
the DSP, the newly established "Jiyuto" (Liberal Party) and 
Kaikaku-no-kai. 
  Together with other right-wing members who quit the former 
Socialist Party to found the DSP in 1960, Ouchi is known as a 
formulator of centrist policies. 
  In 1976, he was elected to the House of Representatives for 
the first time from a Tokyo constituency. After serving four 
consecutive terms in the lower house, he lost his seat in the 
1986 election, despite holding the DSP's No. 2 position of 
secretary general. 
  He recaptured his seat in the lower house and took office as 
chairman of the DSP. In last year's general election, he was 
elected for the sixth time.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Martial arts expert Koji 
Morimoto, considered a specialist in commerce and industry 
issues in Komeito [Clean Government Party], was given the 
construction minister's portfolio. He replaced Kozo Igarashi of 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP). 
  Morimoto, 52, has been elected to the House of 
Representatives four times by his Nara Prefecture constituency 
and has served as an executive on the lower house's Steering 
Committee. 
  Since the launching of the previous coalition government 
last 
August, Morimoto has been in charge of the party's Diet 
management. Morimoto's post has put him in a position to 
confront the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in 
negotiations. 
  He is a close ally of party Secretary General Yuichi 
Ichikawa, a coalition strategist. 
  Morimoto speaks in an undisguised Kansai dialect that 
characterizes the natives of the Osaka-Kyoto-Nara district and 
has been described as a gentle, considerate type in 
interpersonal affairs. His gentle demeanor and refusal to utter 
any complaints should not be confused with a lack of resolve, 
however, since Morimoto is an honorary fourth degree black belt 
holder in nihon kenpo, a modern version of kung fu. 
  In the residence for Diet members, Morimoto's room is 
crowded 
with physical training machines and the Kansai University 
graduate also swims regularly to stay in shape.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Moriyoshi Sato, who is to 
head the Hokkaido and Okinawa Development Agencies, is known to 
be a tenacious politician. Sato, 72, is a member of the 
coalition's core party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party). 
  Sato made three abortive attempts to win a seat in the lower 
house before finally being elected to the House of 
Representatives. 
  He is currently serving his 9th term in the lower house. 
With the appointment Sato, a self-declared close aide of 
disgraced LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] kingpin Shin Kanemaru, 
returns to the political spotlight. 
  It was Sato who in August 1992 read out Kanemaru's statement 
announcing his resignation from the LDP vice presidency over his 
acceptance of 500 million yen in undeclared donations from a 
scandal-ridden trucking firm. 
  Sato, who hails from Hiroshima, is said to have adapted 
quickly to the post-Kanemaru era, distancing himself from the 
fallen LDP powerbroker. 
  While serving as agriculture minister, Sato managed to break 
the deadlock in fishery rights negotiations with the former 
Soviet Union in 1985. In his LDP days, he gained experience 
mainly in the fields of transport and telecommunications. 
  He has also served as National Land Agency director general.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- The Construction Ministry 
has set up special monitoring committees for securing fairness 
in biddings for public works projects in all of its eight 
regional construction bureaus, ministry officials said Thursday 
[28 April]. 
  The committees will keep watch on the procedures for 
biddings 
and receive complaints from companies that fail to get 
contracts, the officials said. 
  The move came in response to a series of major corruption 
scandals, which exposed rampant, illegal collusion between 
politicians and big builders to fix public works contracts and 
deflect official investigation into bid-rigging. 
  The committees, which comprise five experts, will advise the 
ministry's local branch heads. 
  They will monitor and assess fairness of the qualifications 
for bidders for the public works contracts given by the local 
construction bureaus.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry plans 
to make a major revision in the stopgap budget for fiscal 1994 
because of a delay expected in Diet proceedings on the full 
budget for the year, ministry officials said Thursday [28 
April]. They said the revision is required since substantive 
debates on the full budget by the House of Representatives 
Budget Committee are unlikely to start until mid-May. 
  The stopgap budget for the year that started April 1, 
compiled to deal with the nation's political confusion, is valid 
only until May 20. The officials said the full budget is 
unlikely to be approved by the Diet before that date. 
  The new stopgap budget will be valid until sometime in the 
40-day period through June 29, when the current Diet session 
ends, and will involve additional appropriations of 3 trillion 
yen to 4 trillion yen, the officials said. 
  The fiscal 1994 budget was submitted to the Diet on March 4, 
but there have been no Diet debates on it because of the 
political confusion.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) President Yohei Kono on Thursday [28 
April] expressed willingness to confront the newly inaugurated 
administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata through 
parliamentary debate on the fiscal 1994 budget. 
  The LDP "will take issue of (some aspects of the budget bill 
the LDP cannot accept) and urge the government to amend what 
should be amended," the leader of Japan's largest opposition 
party told a group of reporters. 
  Japan's fiscal 1994 state budget to cover outlays for the 
12-month period that started on April 1 is already one month 
overdue. 
  Kono also criticized Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a key 
coalition party, of trying to dominate the policy-making 
process. "We cannot deny the fact that Shinsieto has come to 
assume greater weight in the government," he said. "Without 
question, it will be a fragile cabinet, as the ruling coalition 
has been reduced to a parliamentary minority." 
  He rapped Shinseito, a former LDP breakaway, for maintaining 
the "two-tiered power structure," in an apparent reference to 
the growing dominance by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro 
Ozawa of the policy-making process. Hata "is not the prime 
power in Shinseito," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Japan seems to have halted 
its long economic decline but recovery, while possible this 
fiscal year, cannot be predicted yet, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) 
said Friday [22 April]. "Japan's economic growth seems to have 
stopped weakening," the central bank said in its quarterly 
economic outlook. 
  The "prospect of a gentle recovery is possible" during the 
fiscal year that began this month, a central bank official said, 
but added that "we cannot make an immediate decision" about the 
connection between the halt to declines and a turnaround. 
  Uncertainties remain, the report says, citing corporate and 
financial balance-sheet adjustments, the effects of jobs cuts 
and other streamlining and foreign exchange movements. It notes 
that the first quarters of 1992 and 1993 also showed bright 
signs that did not pan out, but says that this time, "indicators 
of personal consumption picked up and machinery orders, a 
leading indicator of business investment, began to show signs of 
bottoming out." 
  Personal consumption, a major engine of the economy, will 
likely grow gradually this quarter, the report says. 
  Money supply growth will remain sluggish in the quarter, 
between 1 percent and 2 percent above year-earlier levels, the 
report says. The official said that while such tepid growth is 
not good for recovery, money supply alone is not enough to put a 
drag on the economy. 
  Japan's corporate capital spending will continue to fall, 
keeping downward pressure on the economy, but the extent of 
declines should narrow, the BOJ report says. It notes that 
production and shipments have risen at Japan's mines and 
factories but cautions that some of the effect could be from 
fiscal year-end sales promotions. Production and shipments 
could weaken again in the April-June quarter, it says. 
  "Any momentum for production recovery will remain weak, as 
household income and corporate profits will be low," the report 
says. Total domestic demand should recover gradually, with 
consumption helped by this year's income tax cuts and continued 
stable prices, it says. 
  The central bank found "lesser weakness in final demand," 
citing continued strong housing investment, higher consumption 
of such items as appliances, a halt to the fall in machinery 
orders and a pickup in exports due to recovering overseas 
demand. That rise in exports, the report says, has boosted 
Japan's trade surplus. 
  "Labor conditions continue to ease," it says, but no 
"drastic" further adjustments are expected. The BOJ official 
said some firms must continue restructuring efforts but that the 
process need not be completed nationwide for recovery to occur. 
  Noting recent rises in long-term money market rates, the 
report says overseas rises and expectations of fresh bond supply 
may have played a part but that the trend "also seems to have 
reflected market expectations for economic recovery and upturns 
in corporate profits."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Small- and medium-sized 
companies in Japan should drastically reform their business 
structure in order to survive intensifying competition arising 
from rapid changes in their business environments, according to 
a government white paper released Thursday [28 April]. 
  The white paper prepared by the small and medium enterprise 
agency, which is affiliated with the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry, described the environment changes facing 
smaller companies -- those capitalized at 10 million yen or less 
-- as unprecedented in terms of scale, diversity and seriousness. 
  "Decisive" reform efforts that may lead to a "fundamental" 
review of traditional business practices and structure need to 
be made in line with these environment changes, the white paper 
said. 
  The paper emphasized the need for creation of new business 
and services by ailing small enterprises. Such business chances 
are possible through diversification efforts and conversion to 
new areas, the paper said. 
  The document also proposed reforms to revitalize smaller 
firms on the labor and organizational fronts, including 
investment in young and promising human resources, a practice 
rarely seen among smaller firms in the past, and formation of 
business ties beyond traditional boundaries. 
  Summing up business activity in the past year, the white 
paper for fiscal 1993 said small- and medium-sized companies are 
struggling in almost all sectors because of the long-standing 
slump amid slack personal spending. Fiscal 1993 ended March 31. 
  In fiscal 1993, the number of bankruptcies among smaller 
companies increased 3.5 percent from the preceding year, the 
paper said. 
  The paper cited a significant deterioration in earnings, 
excessive manpower supply, a deepening cash shortage and a sharp 
drop in capital spending as the main elements affecting smaller 
businesses and which are a legacy of the lingering recession. 
  The yen's sharp appreciation against the dollar since 
February 1993 dealt a severer blow on smaller companies than 
when the group of seven economic powers tried to drive down the 
dollar's value against other major currencies with the 1985 
Plaza Accord. 
  Other adverse environment changes for small companies cited 
by the white paper included increased competitiveness of 
products manufactured by Southeast Asian countries and newly 
emerging Asian economies. 
  The trend has prompted many small companies in Japan to move 
production facilities overseas, the paper said. 
  It said the economic doldrums in Japan are bringing about 
drastic industrial restructuring for small companies by forcing 
big changes in their relations with major corporations. 
  Under the cloud of recession, the white paper said major 
automakers, for example, have been forced to extend the duration 
of model changeover cycles, simplify product lineups, unify 
component use for different models and shift to overseas 
operations, all eroding businesses previously assigned to 
subcontractors. 
  "The situation is especially severer for third, fourth and 
fifth subcontractors of major corporations than those directly 
working with them," the white paper said. In order for these 
subcontractors to tide themselves over in the present economic 
climate, the white paper proposed they diversify client 
companies and develop their own brand products. 
  There are chances for new business emerging for small firms, 
the paper said. It cited housing-related sectors, 
information-telecommunications fields, environments and services 
needs stemming from the aging society, the paper said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- Japan's industrial 
production in March climbed 4.0 percent from the preceding 
month, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) 
said Wednesday [27 April]. The seasonally adjusted production 
index for the mining and manufacturing sectors stood at 92.1 
against a base of 100 for 1990, MITI announced in a preliminary 
report. 
  The March output growth compares with a 0.1 percent dip 
registered in February. 
  A production outlook index for the manufacturing sector 
indicates falls both in April and May. 
  Uncertainty shadows the future course of final demand, 
necessitating close watch of coming developments, MITI said, 
repeating wording used in the February report. 
  Shipments increased 4.4 percent in March for the index of 
95.0, following a 1.1 percent growth in February. 
  The inventory index dropped 1.7 percent to 105.0, following 
a 
1.0 percent decrease in the previous month. 
  The March inventory-to-sales ratio fell 6.0 percent against 
a 
2.7 percent decrease in February, with the index standing at 
111.9. 
  On an unadjusted basis, industrial production in March slid 
3.1 percent from a year earlier, stretching a record string of 
year-to-year declines to 30 months. 
  With the latest statistics, Japan's industrial output has 
shown considerable fluctuation over the eight months prior to 
the reporting month. 
  Koichi Yoshimoto, chief of the ministry's Statistics 
Analysis 
Division, told a press conference that the basic undertone of 
both industrial output and shipment is still weak although 
bright spots are being detected in some sectors such as 
household electric appliances and housing purchases. 
  The 4.0 percent growth in the March output, the highest 
since 
a 4.2 percent gain registered in September 1992, chiefly 
resulted from seasonal factors toward the end of fiscal 1993, 
Yoshimoto said. "It is too early to declare Japan's economy has 
hit bottom," he said. 
  In March, production in all the 14 industrial sectors 
covered 
by the survey, except chemicals, scored gains from the preceding 
month, MITI said. 
  Electric machinery such as air conditioners made a great 
contribution to boosting March industrial output along with 
transport vehicles such as passenger cars, MITI said. 
  Shipments for the month rose in all 14 sectors, with 
electrical and passenger cars marking substantial increases. 
  The production and shipment indexes rose above 90 for the 
first time since September. But the ministry forecast a 2.7 
percent production decline for the manufacturing sector in April 
and a 2.4 percent decline in May. 
  Demand for machinery will probably drop in these months in 
reaction to sharp increases in the January-March period, 
Yoshimoto explained. 
  The inventory index fell in March for the third month in a 
row, thanks to smooth inventory adjustment in ordinary passenger 
cars, Yoshimoto said. Volume adjustment of corporate 
inventories is progressing steadily but the inventory-to-sales 
ratio of 111.9 for March is still high, Yoshimoto said, noting 
the slow growth of shipments. Corporate managers must feel a 
surplus of inventories, he said. 
  Japan's industrial production for the entire year in fiscal 
1993 fell 4.1 percent from the previous year while shipments 
decreased by 3.7 percent. 
  Both industrial output and shipments thus registered 
declines 
for three consecutive years, a first for Japan. In the past, 
two years of decline were recorded in fiscal 1974-1975 when 
Japan's economy was struggling under the impact of the 1973 oil 
crisis.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- Japan's motor vehicle 
exports in fiscal 1993 ended March 31 decreased 18.3 percent 
from the previous year to 4.62 million vehicles, marking the 
second consecutive yearly fall, an industry group said Wednesday 
[27 April]. 
  The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said the 
yearly fall is the biggest since it began compiling statistics 
of the kind in fiscal 1972, and the total was the smallest since 
fiscal 1978. 
  Exports of passenger cars totaled 3.57 million vehicles, 
down 
19.2 percent from the year before and the lowest level since 
fiscal 1979. Exports were particularly slow in subcompact cars 
with engine displacement of 661-2000 cc, down 24.4 percent, the 
association said. 
  Trucks fell 14.9 percent to 988,480, for the eighth straight 
year of decline. 
  The value of exports amounted to 57.2 billion U.S. dollars 
in 
completed vehicles and 22.89 billion dollars in parts, totaling 
80.09 billion dollars, down 2.4 percent from fiscal 1992. The 
fall in the total amount was the first in four years. 
  The ratio of the exports to Japan's total vehicle output for 
the year declined to 42.6 percent from 45.9 percent the year 
before. 
  Exports to the United States -- the biggest market for 
Japanese automobiles -- declined 10.7 percent from the year 
before to 1.55 million vehicles. It was the seventh consecutive 
yearly fall, the association said. 
  Exports to Europe dropped for the third straight year -- by 
31.2 percent to 1.10 million vehicles. 
  Shipments to Asian countries fell by 1.0 percent for the 
first decline in two years to about 686,000 vehicles. 
  Meanwhile, exports in March alone registered a sharp 24.5 
percent fall from a year earlier to 424,901 vehicles, the 
association said. 
  The value of exports in March totaled 7.85 billion dollars, 
down 7.3 percent from a year earlier.

  [Text] Washington, April 26 KYODO -- The European Union 
(EU) wants to join the United States and explore "a common 
approach" to get Japan to lower its trade surplus by opening its 
markets wider to foreign products, the top EU trade official 
said Tuesday [26 April]. 
  Leon Brittan, European commissioner for trade policy, told 
reporters that he discussed Japanese trade issues in a meeting 
with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor on Tuesday. "We 
share a common view that Japan has a trade surplus which is too 
large and that part of the problem of that surplus is caused by 
difficulties in access to the Japanese market," Brittan said 
after his meeting with Kantor. 
  The EU, which also runs a sizable trade deficit with Japan, 
has expressed concern that U.S. pressure on Japan to open up its 
markets through bilateral negotiations would come at the expense 
of European interests. 
  Brittan reiterated that concern during his current trip to 
Washington, arguing that Japan and the U.S. should take a 
"tripartite approach" in their trade talks by letting the 
Europeans in on their negotiation process. 
  The United States and Japan have been negotiating for nearly 
one year on ways to slash Japan's massive trade surplus, but the 
talks have run into stalemate over U.S. demands to set 
"numerical indicators" to measure the openness of Japanese 
markets. 
  Brittan, speaking at the National Press Club in Washington, 
said the EU is opposed [to] the concept of setting numerical 
targets for specific industry sectors because that would 
increase government interference in the markets. 
  Instead, Brittan said the Japanese Government should 
undertake specific fiscal policy commitments, describing such 
macroeconomic targets as "useful" in bringing down Japan's trade 
surplus. "With a slightly different method we might be able to 
reach an agreement that would satisfy all our concerns," Brittan 
said. 
  Brittan also raised the Japan trade issue in an address to 
the European Institute in Washington on Monday, saying that the 
EU and the U.S. should cooperate to remove "flagrant rules and 
regulations" in Japan that block trading opportunities for 
foreign businesses. 
  The so-called "framework" trade talks between Japan and the 
United States have been suspended since they broke down at the 
summit meeting between President Bill Clinton and former 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Washington on 
February 11. 
  Japanese and U.S. officials say they have no idea when the 
trade talks will be resumed, and the uncertainty has been 
compounded by the political turmoil in Japan, with newly elected 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata having difficulty forming a new 
government.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Japan on 
Tuesday agreed to exchange naval vessels' goodwill visits and to 
mutually inform about their war planes' flights through 
overlapping defense identification zones near Kushu and Tsushima. 
  The agreement was made during talks between visiting Korean 
Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Japanese Defense Agency 
Minister Kazuo Aichi. 
  Under the agreement, a South Korean cruiser is expected to 
visit Japan this fall, followed by a similar visit to Korea by 
Japanese Maritime Defense Agency vessels. 
  The two ministers decided to expand military personnel 
exchanges and take others steps to further promote mutual 
understanding through substantial military exchanges, the report 
said. 
  Exchanging opinions on other matters of common interest, Yi 
and Aichi agreed that the North Korean nuclear question should 
be resolved forthwith and North Korea should promptly return to 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty if only to fulfill its 
obligations as a member of the world community. 
  The Yi-Aichi talks lasted one and a half hours beginning 
4:15 
PM. 
  Yi is set to tour major Self-Defense Force installations and 
pay a call on Prime Minister-designate Tsutomu Hata before 
leaving Japan for the next leg of his tour, Moscow, on Thursday.

  [Text] Kazuo Aichi, director general of the Defense 
Agency, met today with Yi Pyong-tae, the visiting South Korean 
defense minister, and they agreed that Japan and South Korea 
should seek a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue through 
diplomatic efforts. This is the first time that a South Korean 
defense minister has visited Japan. 
  Defense Minister Yi inspected an honor guard in front of the 
Defense Agency headquarters, and later held talks with Director 
General Aichi. Aichi and Yi agreed that Japan and South Korea 
should seek a solution to the standoff over North Korea's 
suspected nuclear program through diplomatic efforts, and also 
that it is essential for Japan, South Korea, and the United 
States to maintain close ties on this matter. 
  Minister Yi said if another war should break out on the 
Korean Peninsula, it will be far more disastrous than the Korean 
war [1950-1953] was. He emphasized the importance of U.S-ROK 
defense cooperation, saying the important thing is for South 
Korea and the United States to cooperate in building a system of 
deterring wars. 
  The two agreed that to promote military exchanges between 
Japan and South Korea, mutual visits of exercise vessels should 
be realized by the end of this year. They also agreed to take 
measures on mutual communications on flight plans and other 
information to prevent aircraft accidents.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- A report on the conditions 
of foreign residents in Tokyo presented to the Tokyo Municipal 
Government on Wednesday [27 April] calls for greater human 
rights guarantees for illegal foreign workers living in the city. 
  The report, drawn up by a committee under the chairmanship 
of 
Yoshio Okawara, a special adviser to the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren) and a former ambassador to the United 
States, was handed to Tokyo Gov. Shunichi Suzuki. The municipal 
government will use the report as a basis for its 
recommendations to all its administrative bureaus. 
  Over the past decade, the number of foreigners registering 
as 
residents in Tokyo has virtually doubled as the city has played 
host to an increasing number of foreign corporations, foreign 
students and foreign workers. The number of foreigners in Tokyo 
had risen to about 270,000 by late 1993, or about one in 40 of 
the city's residents. 
  The report notes that many illegal workers avoid contact 
with 
administrative officials because they fear it will lead to 
detection and subsequent deportation. The report says that as a 
result, poverty and unemployment among foreign workers is 
becoming a serious problem. 
  It recommends that while directing companies to prevent 
illegal employment, the community must face the reality that 
illegal workers are living in the community and should frame 
policies accordingly. It says such policies should take into 
account problems like the abuse of workers' rights when they are 
not paid wages. 
  It also recommends increased support for citizens' groups 
working against human rights abuses among women engaged in 
prostitution and calls for adequate education and health care 
for children of illegal workers.

  [Excerpts] No one knows when Prince Kromluong [Norodom] 
Yuveakneat will leave the monkhood. 
  According to unofficial sources, Prince Kromluong Yuveakneat 
wished to enter the Buddhist priesthood for just two days, but 
until now he has not yet left. 
  Before returning to the United States, a daughter of Prince 
Kromluong Yuveakneat told REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA at Unalaom 
Monastery that her father will not return to the United States 
but will stay on in Cambodia. She and her mother will leave for 
the United States on 22 April. [passage omitted] 
  His majesty the king has been very pleased with the 
ordination of Prince Kromluong Yuveakneat, who is his elder son. 
  Whether this ordination will be for the short or long term, 
the Prince Kromluong will be fulfilling his wish to show his 
gratitude to his father, His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, 
king of the Kingdom of Cambodia, who is the father of the nation. 
  Since his first return to the Kingdom of Cambodia, the 
Prince 
Kromluong has paid great attention to improving and solving the 
difficult livelihood of children in orphanages. He has also 
given love and care to the children living and studying in 
temples. 
  Analysts say that his simple manner could make him the 
successor to the throne. It is not known what role is the 
Prince Kromluong playing in Cambodia.

  [Text] Here are excerpts of the telegrams from His 
Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan, chairman of the Party of 
Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], to His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk 
in connection with his proposal for a roundtable meeting for 
national reconciliation and peace. 
  1. On 22 April 1994, His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk 
issued a statement proposing that a roundtable meeting for peace 
and national reconciliation be held under his chairmanship. 
  2. On the same day, after receiving the king's statement, 
H.E. Khieu Samphan, chairman of the PDK, immediately sent a 
telegram to the king. The contents of this telegram is as 
follows: 
  I am pleased to receive your 22 April 1994 statement. In 
keeping with the deepest desire of our entire nation and people, 
I, on behalf of the PDK, would like to express total support for 
the proposal, which is the product of your profound insight, to 
organize a roundtable meeting for peace and national 
reconciliation under your majesty's august chairmanship. 
  3. On 23 April, with a spirit to enable this roundtable 
meeting to be held successfully with good results in line with 
the king's wish and the deepest aspiration of our entire 
Cambodian nation and people, H.E. Khieu Samphan sent a telegram 
dated 23 April 1994 to the king. The content of this telegram 
is as follows: 
  The PDK's support for the king's proposal on a roundtable 
meeting for peace and national reconciliation comes from the 
persistent stand of Democratic Kampuchea, which zealously wants 
the Cambodian problem to be resolved quickly to achieve genuine 
national reconciliation and unification and enable our Cambodia 
to enjoy peace. 
  All along, Democratic Kampuchea has always supported the 
ideas put forth by the king with great insight to enable 
Cambodia to achieve national reconciliation, unification, and 
peace. 
  The PDK has fully and unconditionally supported His Majesty 
the King's five-point political guideline. At the same time, I 
have tried to propose meetings of various levels with a spirit 
to accomplish your majesty's five-point idea. But they have all 
along opposed our proposals and sought every means to destroy 
the peaceful solution. 
  At the same time, I sought to have an audience with Your 
Majesty with an aim to seek a solution to end quickly the bloody 
war caused by the foreigners and them. 
  Recently, Your Majesty and the respected queen kindly 
permitted me to have an audience with you on 13 April. But Your 
Majesty knew about the security situation, which cannot be 
guaranteed even 60 percent, for me and the entire PDK 
delegation. Thus, with lofty spirit of responsibility in your 
capacity as the father of the nation, Your Majesty kindly 
canceled the audience on 13 April and instead grant me an 
audience in Beijing in June instead. 
  The PDK has voiced happily and promptly its support for the 
king's proposal on a roundtable meeting made in your 22 April 
1994 statement. 
  I would like to cite some developments for Your Majesty's 
information with the aim of arranging favorable conditions for a 
secured and neutral negotiation. This is in line with the 
profound and sacred desire of the father of peace and national 
reconciliation and in line with the aspiration of our entire 
nation and people. 
  The PDK office has come under constant monitoring and 
threats 
since 18 April 1994. The employees working there could not 
carry out their normal activities. The police even prohibited 
them from going to the market to buy daily food. They were 
allowed to go sometimes, but with policemen tagging along in the 
same car or policemen on motorcycles following behind. There 
are between 10 and 15 policemen and troops standing in front of 
the office gate to show constantly their force. Telephone lines 
have all been disconnected. The masses who are relatives of the 
PDK members have also been prohibited from entering the office. 
  This causes a problem, which affects the chances for the 
roundtable meeting for peace and national reconciliation that 
the entire Cambodian nation and people, including Democratic 
Kampuchea, want so much. I would like to beg Your Majesty to 
help arrange for the PDK's office to resume its normal activity. 
  In addition to this, there is the issue of the National 
Assembly members, whose true nature is known to all, proposing a 
draft to outlaw the PDK, to make it the rebel. This is direct 
and arrogant opposition to the king's proposal for the 
roundtable meeting. This law, either with a two-thirds or a 
three-thirds majority, is in opposition to the roundtable 
meeting and to national reconciliation, national unification, 
and peace in Cambodia. 
  The situation has deteriorated since the time the Vietnamese 
invaded Cambodia. They kept opposing and trampling upon the 
Paris agreement even after signing it. They resolutely rejected 
the four-party policy. In reality, that was outright opposition 
to national reconciliation and unification. They refused to 
give any role to the four-party Supreme National Council [SNC] 
as well as to the king, the SNC chairman. Immediately after the 
elections organized by the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in 
Cambodia], they began their joint offensive to kill the PDK and 
kindle the flame of war which has continued to rage Cambodia 
until today. 
  I and the PDK, like our entire nation and people in the 
countryside, in Phnom Penh, and abroad, want so much to achieve 
national reconciliation and unification and to rally all forces 
under the shade of the throne and the king. All of this is in 
order to bring peace to Cambodia and enable our Cambodian people 
to live and make their living in peace and happiness. 
  In this spirit, despite their trampling upon the Paris 
agreement and opposition to the PDK, even by jointly attacking, 
opposing, and trying to kill Democratic Kampuchea, I am willing 
to let bygones be bygones without any desire for vengeance. I 
only think about how to achieve national reconciliation, rally 
all national forces, and reunify the nation in line with His 
Majesty's national reconciliation policy. This will respond to 
the profound aspiration of the entire nation and people, who 
want genuine national reconciliation and reunification in a 
peaceful, unified, and neutral Cambodia. 
  For all of the above reasons and through experiences gained 
in our Cambodia and from the world, I am of the opinion that the 
roundtable meeting should be held in a neutral place -- inside 
or outside the country -- where security is guaranteed for all 
parties to the negotiation and talks. Only by so doing can the 
negotiation and talks proceed normally and the meeting achieve 
good results. 
  The above information that I have reported to Your Majesty 
comes out of our thoughts, with a sense of responsibility for 
the fate of our nation and people, on what to do in order to 
enable the roundtable negotiation be held successfully in line 
with Your Majesty's desire and our people's profound aspiration.

  [Text] At a meeting on 27 April with foreign diplomats 
accredited to the Kingdom of Cambodia, Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh, first prime minister of the Royal Government of 
Cambodia [RGC], said that the RGC respects and fully supports 
the initiative of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, king of 
Cambodia, on the coming roundtable meeting in the royal palace. 
  The prince krompreah further said that this roundtable is a 
meeting between the RGC and the Khmer Rouge [KR] and not talks. 
He clearly specified that the RGC will do all it can for the 
roundtable meeting to proceed smoothly by ensuring 100 percent 
security and safety. The prince krompreah said that if the 
roundtable meeting did not achieve results, a consultation will 
be held with the cochairmen of the Paris international 
conference to implement the third part of the Paris agreement. 
  Concerning the Khmer Rouge's abduction of some foreigners in 
rural areas, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh promised to work 
for the safe return of these foreigners to Phnom Penh.

  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP April 26 -- Son Sen, a member of the 
Democratic Kampuchea (Khmer Rouge) is now reportedly the new 
power in the Khmer Rouge, said CAMBODIA TIMES, an 
English-language local newspaper, in its recent issue. 
  Contrary to common belief and reports, Son Sen, who was 
relieved of his duties in May 1992 after losing a high-level 
dispute over whether the Khmer Rouge should pull out of the 
UN-organized peace plan, is very much in control within the 
Khmer Rouge. 
  According to senior government intelligence sources, Son Sen 
is in control of the Khmer Rouge rank and file and its political 
platform. 
  He is also said to be directing the military effort against 
the currently victorious Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF). 
  The source said that Son Sen is now directing the 
counter-attacks against the RCAF forces at Pailin from a 
stronghold at Phum Malai mountains, one of the last remaining 
Khmer Rouge military bastions. 
  He is also reportedly responsible for the Khmer Rouge's 
successful counter-attack at Anlung Veng. 
  They said that the fact that Khmer Rouge leaders like Pol 
Pot 
and Khieu Samphan and commanders like Ta Mok were reportedly no 
longer in the country but have sought sanctuary in a 
neighbouring country, has fuelled claims that the Khmer Rouge 
leadership is now in quiet disarray with the military losses, 
especially that of Pailin. 
  Meanwhile, Pailin has reportedly come under heavy shelling 
in 
recent days and the Khmer Rouge were said to be operating in 
groups of not more than eight members who were involved in 
hit-and-run tactics as well as harassment of RCAF personnel and 
commanders. 
  Military sources said that the capture of Phnum Malai from 
the Khmer Rouge was the best way of ensuring peace, Pailin and 
Battambang as it will relieve Khmer Rouge pressure from these 
two areas.

  [Text] Here is an additional report from the Pailin 
battlefield on 27 April. 
  On 27 april, we launched a sweep operation against the 
two-headed elements along Route 10 beginning from the west. 
After fighting for the whole day from 0600 at dawn to 0630 in 
the evening, we smashed and liberated the 4th Division command 
post at Treng on Route 10. This area has been a strategic 
position of the communist Vietnamese, communist Vietnamese 
puppets, and two-headed government since 1979. Treng, the 
bridgehead of the defense line of Battambang town, has vanished. 
  Hul Savoan, four-star general and commander of Battambang's 
5th Military Region, who fled from Pailin to hide in Treng after 
being routed, has disappeared from this area. 
  We also totally swept the enemy positions at Phlov Meas and 
Phum Tuol. We seized four 37-mm, three 76.2-mm, and six 12.7-mm 
artillery pieces and a large quantity of small guns. 
  We are pushing forward.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, April 26 (AFP) -- The Khmer Rouge [KR] 
on Tuesday launched a heavy attack on the border town of Poipet, 
in the northwestern Cambodian province of Banteay Meanchay, 
co-premier Hun Sen said. 
  "Today the Khmer Rouge attacked Poipet, I don't know what is 
happening there but our general staff are following the 
situation," Hun Sen told reporters in Phnom Penh. The 
ultra-left guerrillas started to shell Poipet, a normally busy 
market town on the Thai-Cambodian border, early Tuesday and Thai 
military officials reported heavy fighting throughout the day. 
  More than a hundred civilians fled to the safety of 
Sisophon, 
48 kilometers (30 miles) to the east, fearing the guerrillas 
would overrun the town. 
  Thai military officials told reporters in the Thai town of 
Aranyaprathet, which is opposite Poipet, that the Khmer Rouge 
attacked in a pincer movement with the guerrillas's 450 Division 
moving in from the south while the 519 Division pushed from the 
north. No figures were available on the number of men involved 
in the attack or on casualties. 
  Hun Sen said he was surprised by the size of the guerrilla 
attack. 
  "I just wonder how the Khmer Rouge could have such strength 
to attack Poipet," he said, adding: "I don't say that I accuse 
Thailand." 
  Hun Sen last week accused Thailand of assisting the Khmer 
Rouge in the guerrillas' April 19 recapture of their 
headquarters at Pailin in northwest Cambodia. 
  Thailand denied the accusation and said that Phnom Penh's 
repeated allegations of Thai support for the Khmer Rouge risked 
jeopardising relations between the two neighbouring states. 
  Thai military officer also said that Cambodia's National 
Route 5 which runs from the border to the country's second city 
of Battambang was closed due to the clashes.

  [Text] On 17 April, hundreds of people living along the 
Tonle Sap Lake assaulted the Vietnamese at (Kbal Taol) and (Kaoh 
Khsach Pouy), killing 30 of them and destroying three motor 
boats and four (?fishing) boats. 
  The report said that during the current fishing season, the 
Vietnamese have arrogantly prohibited our Cambodian people from 
fishing in this area. The Vietnamese aggressors have killed 
many Cambodians who went fishing in this area. 
  The Cambodian people have time and again complained to the 
authorities in this region but to no avail, because these 
authorities who are lackeys of the Vietnamese think only of 
serving their Vietnamese masters. Therefore, the people say 
that their only alternative is to settle the Vietnamese acts of 
aggression and expansion along Tonle Sap Lake by themselves.

  [Text] President Suharto hosted a state banquet in honor 
of visiting Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh and his wife at the 
National Palace in Jakarta tonight. Addressing the banquet, 
President Suharto reiterated that all countries in Southeast 
Asia have the common responsibility of maintaining peace and 
stability in the region. 
  He said that all countries in the region should always 
uphold 
the principle of good neighborliness and mutual respect for each 
others' sovereignty. He also said that Vietnam and Indonesia 
have the common aspiration of turning Southeast Asia into a zone 
of peace and stability, a region of high economic growth, as 
well as a prosperous region that will guarantee the welfare of 
its people. 
  In view of this, President Suharto lauded Vietnam's 
cooperation with ASEAN by participating in the organization's 
programs and being an observer at ASEAN meetings. 
  The head of state also said that it is important for 
Indonesia and Vietnam to establish cordial relations and 
mutually trust each other so that all issues relating to 
bilateral ties can be resolved fairly. 
  President Suharto said that Indonesia and Vietnam, being 
neighboring countries with historical ties, should be able to 
settle amicably such issues as the continental shelf and the 
repatriation of Vietnamese illegal immigrants in Indonesia. 
  The head of state said he is confident that a satisfactory 
result can be achieved in efforts to settle those problems based 
on the good etiquette displayed by officials from the two 
countries. 
  Present at the banquet, among others, were vice President 
and 
Madame Try Sutrisno, senior government officials, and cabinet 
ministers.

  [Text] President Suharto and Vietnamese President Le Duc 
Anh held official talks at Jakarta's Merdeka Palace this 
morning. The outcome of the talks was disclosed by 
Minister-State Secretary Murdiono as follows: 
  [Begin Murdiono recording] The two sides, both at the 
ministerial and head of state levels, share the view that 
current bilateral ties are very cordial and based on mutual 
understanding. The Vietnamese president's current visit is 
viewed as an important momentum for upgrading existing bilateral 
relations. The two sides believe there is no bilateral problem 
which cannot be solved. 
  During their talks, the two leaders briefed one another on 
the domestic situation of their country, especially regarding 
economic development. Both leaders are confident that bilateral 
ties can be further upgraded in the coming years. Both also 
praised each other's successes in economic development. 
  Touching on political issues, both sides exchanged views on 
how to solve the problem of the overlapping continental shelf. 
Consequently, both sides agreed that this problem should be 
settled quickly on the basis of the Law of the Sea Convention. 
It was also agreed that technical officials should speed up 
their work. Should they fail to reach an agreement on this 
issue, they must report it to the higher authority immediately. 
  The two sides also discussed the issue of Vietnamese 
refugees, or boat people, currently held at Galang island. More 
than 8,000 Vietnamese refugees still remain at Galang island. 
Only a few of them can expect to get political asylum and be 
resettled in a third country, while the majority of them consist 
of people who must be repatriated to Vietnam. The two sides 
also agreed to find an early solution to the refugee problem. 
  When the two leaders discussed multilateral and regional 
issues, the Vietnamese leader indicated his country's desire to 
get an observer status at the next meeting of APEC [Asia Pacific 
Economic Cooperation] in Jakarta. Whether Vietnam's request 
will be granted depends on the APEC criteria on the status of 
observer. As we know, for the time being, namely, for three 
years, APEC will not consider accepting new members. During the 
talks, President Suharto stressed the importance of APEC views 
and resolutions, which will benefit not only its members but 
also all countries, including developing ones. 
  Vietnam also expressed its desire to join ASEAN and 
President 
Suharto once again explained ASEAN's views and objectives, 
namely, forging cooperation so as to boost the welfare of each 
member country and strengthen national resiliency. These 
objectives are not aimed at other countries. ASEAN does not 
want to become part of other regional groupings in the world. 
  The Nonaligned Movement [NAM] was another topic of 
discussion 
between the two leaders. Both at the ministerial and 
presidential levels, Vietnam expressed its high appreciation of 
the role played by Indonesia as NAM chairman. Vietnam also 
praised Indonesia's success in implementing resolutions adopted 
at the NAM summit meeting in Jakarta in 1992 and in raising the 
prestige of the movement. President Suharto also mentioned 
important moves he had initiated in his capacity as NAM 
chairman. We all know that the NAM chairman's meeting with the 
Japanese prime minister at the G-7 summit meeting in Tokyo was 
indeed an important breakthrough in the efforts to reactivate 
the North-South dialogues. 
  As for economic talks, Vietnam invited Indonesia to take 
part 
in its infrastructure development, which now involves carrying 
out economic reforms and adjusting to the situations in other 
countries. Cooperation in agriculture was also another topic of 
discussion with Vietnam expressing its desire to buy fertilizers 
from Indonesia. Cooperation in marketing coffee and rice was 
also discussed. I must stress here that it is not Indonesia's 
policy to export rice. What is important is how to maintain our 
rice self-sufficiency, which we successfully achieved in 1984. 
Vietnam also sought possible cooperation in producing soybeans, 
shrimp, and garlic. In addition, Vietnam wanted to learn from 
and requested technical assistance from Indonesia in promoting 
its tourism industry. Vietnam seems to be very impressed with 
our tourism industry, which does not have a negative impact on 
our culture. In other words, Vietnam wants to learn how to 
promote tourism while at the same time continuing to preserve 
its national culture. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Commenting on the current visit to Indonesia by 
Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh, KOMPAS says Indonesia has never 
doubted where the cordial bilateral relations would lead to, 
because in the past few years, the trade volume has continued to 
climb steadily. Indonesia's exports to Vietnam in 1993 stood at 
U.S. $165 million while its imports were at U.S. $32.45 million. 
However, KOMPAS also notes that if the Vietnamese leader's visit 
is aimed at holding talks on the refugee and continental shelf 
issues, we can understand the urgent nature of these issues 
because the Indonesian Government plans to develop Galang island 
[refugee detention center], located in the south of Singapore, 
into an industrial zone in parallel with the Batam island 
industrial zone. 
  Meanwhile, PELITA believes that the Vietnamese president's 
visit to Indonesia reflects the increasingly close bilateral 
relations. The visit also reflects the imminent entry of Vietnam 
into the ASEAN regional grouping. Since Vietnam withdrew its 
troops from Cambodia, resulting in the termination of conflicts 
in that country, Hanoi's stand has been viewed favorably by 
ASEAN, whose policy is to create security, peace, and stability 
in Southeast Asia. Since that time, Vietnam has consistently 
reiterated its desire to join ASEAN and now it is only a matter 
of time for that country to do so. 
  BERITA YUDHA says no ASEAN countries have any political 
objection to Vietnam's desire to join the regional grouping. At 
present, Vietnam, even Laos, has been involved in several ASEAN 
activities. The only problem is Vietnam's economic system, which 
is different from that of ASEAN countries. Therefore, Vietnam 
must also make some adjustments.

  [Text] Speaking at Jakarta's Wisma Negara Guest House this 
afternoon, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam 
reiterated his country's commitment to repatriate Vietnamese 
refugees still held on Galang Island. Even though he did not 
give an exact deadline for the repatriation, the Vietnamese 
minister said his government will do its best to find an early 
solution to the issue. About 8,000 Vietnamese refugees remain at

  [Text] The Libyan Government has called on Indonesia as 
chairman of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] to play a more active 
role in efforts to end the economic sanctions imposed by the UN 
Security Council on Libya three years ago. 
  Ibrahim al-Yarabu, secretary general of the International 
Islamic Missionary Movement, told newsmen in Jakarta today that 
the NAM had responded to the matter by introducing a resolution 
that calls for lifting the economic sanctions, but the 
resolution had yet to be pursued. The NAM influence will be 
felt further if the resolution is implemented. 
  The UN Security Council imposed the sanctions on Libya 
following the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, 
Scotland in December 1988 that killed 270 people. Ibrahim 
al-Yarabu's visit to Indonesia is the second for discussions on 
the sanctions.

  [Text] The Philippines is voicing its "serious concern" 
over "disguised non-tariff barriers" being imposed by rich 
nations like the United States on their poor trading partners. 
  High-level sources at the Department of Foreign Affairs 
(DFA) 
said these disguised barriers include human rights and 
environmental issues which are being incorporated by the United 
States and other Western powers into the mainstream of their 
foreign trade policies. 
  A DFA official said that developed countries went 
'overboard' 
on using such barriers under the new world trade order after the 
Uruguay Round was signed last April. 
  "So now we have issues on environment, human rights, 
sanitary 
requirements and wildlife being invoked by the United States, 
the European Union and other rich countries," the official said. 
  The DFA, meanwhile, said the Philippines will push for the 
inclusion of its serious concern over trade issues in the agenda 
of the U.S.- ASEAN conference in Washington next month. 
  Describing it as "ridiculous," DFA officials took notice of 
trade sanctions recently imposed by the United States against 
Taiwan for its failure to close down the illegal trade in 
wildlife, specifically the poaching of wild cats or tigers. 
  Taipei has protested the trade sanctions, asking why the 
Clinton administration spared the mainland China despite reports 
from environmental experts that it is even a bigger market for 
wildlife products than Taiwan. 
  "This is what I call as a form of disguised non-tariff 
barriers which we view with serious concern," a DFA source, 
asking for anonymity, said, "hindi na [no longer] tariff, hindi 
na quota dahil bawal na 'yan sa [because that's prohibited in] 
GATT (meaning the new world trade order or WTO)." 
  It must also be noted that Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo 
earlier assailed the United States for linking China's record of 
human rights violations in its renewal assessment of the 
most-favored-nation status to that country. 
  Romulo has also expressed relief over failed attempts by the 
United States to include "social clauses" into the GATT which 
involve the protection of the workers' rights and other labor 
standards. He said that labor and human rights issues be 
separated from trade accords. 
  Under the GATT, developed countries will cut industrial 
tariffs by 38 percent and farm tariffs by 37 percent over the 
next 10 years. The developing countries have no tariff slashing 
figures but they agreed to "bind" or not to add extra fees and 
payments to their tariff rates. 
  DFA officials said the United States and its allies are 
looking for ways to cushion negative effects of the GATT to 
Western market, which will have to compete against the influx of 
Asian export to the world economy. 
  Asia is said to benefit the most out of GATT since it has 
the 
fastest growing and most trade oriented economies. Asia will 
generate more than 50 percent of the new trade by developing 
countries, which will bring in more jobs, higher incomes and in- 
demand products.

  [Text] Exiled communist leader Jose Ma. Sison yesterday 
accused former colleagues who have turned against him of being 
in the payroll of the Office of the National Security Adviser, 
Jose Almonte. They are also "directly in touch with U. S. 
Ambassador John Negroponte," he said. 
  Sison did not offer proof of the supposed link between his 
enemies and Almonte or Negroponte. He merely said: "I have 
been informed by the NDF [National Democratic Front] about the 
character of those issuing the statements in the name of the so- 
called Democratic Bloc of the NDF and the so-called NDF-Europe." 
  He said the participation of his enemies in the "psywar 
(operations) of the U. S.-Ramos regime" is shown by the fact 
that they have not been criticizing the government of the United 
States but are concentrating on attacking the NDF and the 
Communist Party of the Philippines [CPP]. 
  In a separate press statement, the National Democratic Front 
said members of the breakaway faction in the underground 
movement are merely "a noisy group" who have long been 
repudiated by their mass organizations. It also said that the 
New People's Army remains under the control of the Communist 
Party of the Philippines. For these reasons, the NDF indicated 
it would be meaningless for the government to negotiate with the 
splinter faction. 
  The verbal battle in the underground rebel movement has 
escalated with both sides accusing each other of plotting to 
kill leading personalities in their camps. 
  Yesterday, in a statement marking NDF's 21st anniversary, 
Secretary General Frank Fernandez expressed the organization's 
belief in the need for peace but emphasized this would not come 
about unless meaningful changes take place. 
  Expressing its determination to advance the armed struggle, 
the NDF deplored what it called the destructive deeds of a rival 
group which recently announced its readiness to hold separate 
peace talks with the government. 
  Fernandez said members of the so-called Democratic Bloc 
merely want a "graceful exit" from the armed revolution, and 
that their moves are being supported by the Ramos Government to 
push the NDF into negotiations under terms dictated by the 
government. 
  Utrecht-based leaders of the NDF have been holding out on 
the 
negotiations, demanding that the Ramos Government first withdraw 
"conditions" for the talks which violate the Hague Declaration 
signed by both parties two years ago. 
  A member of the anti-Sison faction yesterday denied his 
involvement in an alleged plot to kill the founder of the CPP. 
  Antonio Cabardo, former detainee and vice president of the 
Sandigan ng Kalayaan at Demokrasya ng Sambayanan [Foundation of 
Freedom and Democracy of the People], said Sison's accusations 
show him to be "either sick of paranoia of the highest order or 
again up to some evil scheme." 
  He also said statements coming from the Utrecht-based 
leaders 
seem to show they are preparing for a "graceful exit" of their 
own, but in this case, "a graceful exit from the peace process." 
  He said Sison would use as an excuse the supposed plot to 
kill him as reason for pulling out from the peace efforts.

  [Text] The rift within the communist movement stretched 
even wider as a flurry of statements marked the 21st anniversary 
yesterday of the National Democratic Front (NDF). 
  A spokesperson for two breakaway communist factions in 
Mindanao said groups who oppose the leadership of exiled 
communist leader Jose Maria Sison have been branded by forces 
loyal to him as counter-revolutionaries who should be treated 
accordingly. 
  Europe-based critics of Sison also sent a statement 
declaring 
they now represent the real NDF, indicating that the rift has 
extended to the continent. 
  Sison, believed to be founding chair of the Communist Party 
here, is in self-exile in Utrecht, The Netherlands. 
  Ike de los Reyes, speaking for NDF-Central Mindanao and the 
Moro Revolutionary Army, said members of the breakaway groups 
now fear liquidation not only by the military but also by former 
comrades who still acknowledge his [Sison] leadership. 
  De Los Reyes, who represented NDF-Northwest Mindanao in the 
1986 peace talks between communist rebels and the administration 
of President Corazon Aquino, said the NDF is virtually doomed 
because of the divisions wracking it. 
  "Our friends in the movement who are reaffirmists (loyal to 
Sison) tell us we are still their friends but no longer 
comrades," said De los Reyes. 
  "Others say we should be treated neither as friends nor as 
enemies but as counter-revolutionaries," he added. 
  He said breakaway rebels in Mindanao were warned by the 
Edilberto Djanggo Canoy Command, a supposed pro-Sison hit squad 
based in Davao City, that "if you cannot help the revolution, 
you should not help destroy it." 
  The differences between the opposing camps appeared 
irreconcilable after Sison announced recently that breakaway 
leaders, in collaboration with the Philippine military, have 
sent a hit squad to Utrecht to kill him. 
  Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, Armed Forces chief, has denied 
Sison's charge. 
  Ricardo Reyes, former communist leader in the Visayas, 
called 
the INQUIRER to clarify that he was not among those named by 
Sison as behind the alleged slay plot. 
  But a statement from Sison's base in Utrecht said Reyes, 
together with Romulo Kintanar, former head of the New People's 
Army, Benjamin de Vera and Marguerite Manalo, took part in a 
purge of suspected military agents inside the communist 
movement, which led to the killing of more than 950 rebels. 
  From the Visayas, a group of breakaway rebels said in a 
statement that Sison's charges are "nothing but a pack of lies 
and a ridiculous figment of (his) mind. 
  "The problem with Sison is that from his distant retreat in 
Utrecht, he relies solely on fax reports from his local robots," 
said the statement signed by Indio Pluma, supposed spokesperson 
of the Visayas breakaway group. 
  "(Sison) suffers from a dearth of information...and he now 
appears to be cracking under the weight of his own paranoia," 
the statement added. 
  For their part, Rose Cheung and Byron Bocar, who claim to be 
from NDF-Europe, said in yet another statement that Sison is 
"locked in a world where principle is dogma and not a guide to 
action...where revolutionary practice is not given the premium 
value it deserves." 
  The Europe-based group said Sison refused to heed the 
lessons 
which the Philippine communist movement can learn from the 
collapse of the Soviet Union and communist regimes in Eastern 
Europe. 
  "Learning from the negative example of the encroachments of 
Eastern European states on the civil and political liberties of 
their citizens, many Third World revolutionary movements now 
affirm and uphold such liberties and no longer just dismiss 
these as bourgeois," the group said. . 
  It added that breakaway rebels in Europe welcome the 
decision 
of local breakaway leaders to organize a panel to negotiate for 
possible peace with the administration. 
  Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon, however, said late last 
week that the government maintains its policy of negotiating 
only with the mainstream Left represented by Sison and Luis 
Jalandoni, who is also based in The Netherlands. 
  Drilon, who serves as adviser to the government peace panel 
negotiating with the NDF, said the administration is not 
encouraging the formation of a separate panel by breakaway rebel 
factions. 
  The statement from NDF-Europe said that "by usurping the 
powers of duly elected leadership bodies of the NDF through an 
executive coup last year the Utrecht troika of Messrs. [sentence 
as published] Sison, Jalandoni and (Antonio) Zumel have ceased 
to be the legitimate representatives of the NDF, and they now 
speak only for themselves."

  [Text] Leaders of the revolutionary movement who had been 
accused by Communist Party founder Jose Ma. Sison of plotting 
with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to assassinate 
him denied yesterday the charges, saying Sison "is either sick 
of paranoia of the highest order or again up to some evil 
scheme." 
  "By airing self-serving and serious charges without basis, 
Sison is in effect giving policy guidance to the group of 
Gregorio Rosal and similar brutal killers to escalate the 
internal feud in the leftist movement, while he is ensconced in 
the safety of his refuge in the Netherlands," said Antonio 
Cabardo, vice president of Sandigan ng Kalayaan at Demokrasya ng 
Sambayanan [Foundation of Freedom and Democracy of the People] 
(Sanlakas), and one of the five leaders Sison had charged of 
plotting to kill him. Others expressed the same sentiment. 
  Sanlakas is a multi-sectoral organization in the NCR 
[National Capital Region] composed of former affiliates of Bayan 
[Bagong Alyansang Makabayan -- New Nationalist Alliance]-NCR. 
  Cabardo said it is now clear that Sison is pushing for the 
implementation of an earlier death sentence for four opposition 
leaders, as he claimed to be the target of a similar slay plot. 
  Sison had charged in an interview over radio station DZMM 
and 
DZRH that the AFP and Romulo Kintanar, Ricardo Reyes, Arturo 
Tabara, Felimon Lagman, and Cabardo had sent a hit team to 
Europe led by a certain "Narding" to kill him. 
  The recent media pronouncement of Sison about the alleged 
assassination plot and the present handling by Luis Jalandoni of 
the peace negotiation with the GRP [Government of the Republic 
of the Philippines] panel all point out to the tendency of the 
Sison group to pull out from the peace negotiation, Cabardo said. 
  Thus, Sison and Jalandoni are laying the ground work for a 
graceful exit from the peace process, a face-saving move that 
would enable Sison to use the alibi of risks to personal 
security of the NDF [National Democratic Front] panel for his 
planned pullout. 
  Cabardo warned Sison that his Stalinist design will get him 
nowhere, as comrades and the masses begin to see through the 
ruse and realize that the policies and program he is spousing 
are not for the revolution after all. 
  He ask the pro-Sison comrades to come to terms with reality 
and recognize that the ideological struggle cannot be resolved 
in their favor by eliminating the opposition within the 
Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) physically, for many 
others will later take up the challenge.

  [Text] Moscow, April 28 (YONHAP) -- Russia has yet to send 
military experts to witness the dismantling of a decommissioned 
submarine it sold to North Korea as stipulated in the contract, 
diplomatic sources here said Thursday. 
  Due to Russia's failure to implement the terms of the 
contract, western countries are worried that Pyongyang might use 
the submarine for military purposes, the sources said. 
  According to the contract, Russia must send military experts 
for on-the-spot observation to confirm that the submarine is 
used only as scrap iron and not for military reasons. 
  The sources said North Korea began dismantling the submarine 
it purchased from Russia some months ago, but without 
on-the-spot observation by Russian experts, the North Koreans 
could use the submarine for military purposes. 
  For example, Pyongyang could use the parts in its own 
submarines or try to improve its military technology by 
examining the Russian sub, according to the sources. 
  Concerned about this possibility, Japan recently asked 
Russia 
to dispatch military experts to North Korea to observe the 
submarine's dismantling, ITAR-TASS reported from Tokyo Thursday. 
  Russia contracted with North Korea, through the mediation of 
a Japanese trading company, to sell 12 decommissioned submarines 
and has delivered one so far. 
  The Russian Navy Command earlier clarified that the 
dismantling of the submarine will be observed by Russian 
military experts and that it must be used only as scrap iron.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 27 (YONHAP) -- The sudden homecoming 
Tuesday of Han Tok-su, chairman of the pro-Pyongyang 
organization Chochongnyon [General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan], has triggered speculation that Han was 
forced to return to North Korea permanently because he rejected 
orders to sell Chochongnyon's assets and send the proceeds to 
the Kim Il-song regime, North Korea watchers say. 
  The 87-year-old Han, who has controlled Chochongnyon for the 
past 39 years, was reluctant to go to Pyongyang because he 
thought he might not be able to return to Japan after meeting 
North Korean leader Kim Il-song and his son and heir-apparent, 
Chong-il, Chochongnyon insiders say. 
  The homecoming was related to North Korea's intentions to 
change the leadership of Chochongnyon, making it easier to 
collect money from the pro-Pyongyang organization in Japan, the 
insiders say. 
  Han reportedly failed to comply with the North's request 
that 
Chochongnyon sell its assets in Japan for remittance to 
Pyongyang, insisting the assets were obtained by the 
organization itself. 
  To facilitate the transfer of proceeds from selling the 
group's assets, Pyongyang tried to dispatch former Chochongnyon 
Vice Chairman Kim Pyong-sik to Tokyo but was thwarted by 
Chochongnyon leaders, according to the insiders. 
  Kim was named vice president of the North Korean Government 
last December, 22 years after disappearing from public view. 
  Pyongyang has repeatedly asked Han to return since last year 
and even sent Han's eldest son, U-chol, as a special envoy to 
persuade him early this year, the insiders say. 
  According to the SANKEI SHIMBUN, Japanese security 
authorities see Han's return to Pyongyang as a prelude to 
measures facilitating money transfers to Pyongyang from Tokyo if 
international sanctions are imposed on North Korea for its 
suspected nuclear weapons program.

<F P=106> [Report by Yi Chong-won] </F>
  [Text] Western sources in Seoul knowledgeable in North 
Korean-Chinese relations reported on 27 April that China 
provided North Korea with food, including 10,000 tonnes of rice, 
as "birthday gifts" on 15 April, President Kim Il-song's 
birthday. 
  Reporting that China also "presented" 10 tonnes of meat and 
five tonnes of edible oil to North Korea, the sources noted: 
"The delivery of those 'food gifts' by China was very unusual, 
and it hints of North Korea's food problems." It was learned 
that China gave North Korea 400 tons of pork as a gift on 
President Kim's birthday in 1992. 
  Regarding this, the ROK Government officials knowledgeable 
in 
North Korean affairs said: "In 1993, North Korea yielded only 
3.8 million tonnes of rice due to the cold weather, and the 
amount is down 500,000 tonnes from other years and falls 
absolutely short of its necessary rice amount of 6.3 million 
tonnes." They added: "China provides North Korea with 1 million 
tonnes of rice every year in the form of barter trade. It is 
unprecedented, however, for China to present food to North Korea 
free of charge." 
  Government officials analyzed that, although the 10,000-ton 
rice provided by China is insufficient to solve North Korea's 
food problems, it was probably of help in somewhat increasing 
the North Korean people's rice rations or in increasing the 
ratio of rice in mixing rice and other grains. 
  This amount of rice can be loaded on 2,000 five-ton trucks 
and is over 50,000 soms -- North Korea sent 50,000 soms of rice 
to the ROK when we suffered flood damage in the middle of 1983.

  [Text] Seoul, April 28 KYODO -- North Korea is capable of 
delivering chemical weapons with SCUD missiles and has already 
targeted missiles at Okinawa and Guam, a defector from North 
Korea's armed forces said Thursday. 
  Sgt. Yi Chong-kok, who defected to South Korea on March 18, 
told a news conference that North Korea has the technology to 
mount chemical weapons onto SCUD missiles though it is not 
capable of mounting nuclear weapons. 
  "Missile bases located in Myongchon and Hwadae of North 
Hamkyong province have Okinawa and Guam within its shooting 
range," said Yi, who served in the nuclear and Chemical Defense 
Bureau in the Korean People's Army General Staff. 
  Yi also said missiles at a base in Jagang Province, which 
borders China, are aimed at China. 
  North Korean Leader Kim Chong-il, Kim Il-song's son and 
heir- 
apparent, does not appear to hold the reins in the military 
although he is supreme commander of the armed forces, he said. 
  "Kim Pyong-il, Kim Chong-il's stepbrother and ambassador to 
Finland, is more popular among North Korean people because he is 
handsome and is believed to have good personality," Yi said. 
  North Korean Vice Premier Kim Pok-sin, after inspecting 
frontline military units in March 1992, told President Kim 
Il-song soldiers had little rice and clothing and wore shoes 
made of bark, according to Yi. 
  Upon receiving the report, the president sacked an official 
involved in supplying food, and ordered the Administration 
Council to provide rice and 400,000 pairs of military shoes, Yi 
said. 
  "North Korea's food shortage is even worse in the 
countryside 
and I heard old men and children have died of starvation in 
Yanggang Province and South Hamkyong Province," he said. 
  Yi also said he heard that North Koreans in Yomjoo and 
Tongrim in the North Pyongan Province rioted to protest food 
shortages last August and September. 
  "Even if North Koreans want to see their country adopt 
Chinese- style open-door policies, they realize their country is 
becoming more and more isolated, and communism can no longer 
survive with the collapse of the Soviet Union," Yi said. 
  "North Korean Leader Kim Il-song seems worried about the 
possible fall of his regime," he added.

  [Text] Seoul, April 27 (YONHAP) -- North Korean letters 
addressed to the South Korean Government and parliamentary 
leaders urging a grand national rally have arrived in Seoul via 
a third country, the National Unification Board said Wednesday. 
  A set of 38 letters, forwarded to high-profile figures like 
House Speaker Yi Man-sop, opposition leader Yi Ki-taek and 
outgoing Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, insisted that the two 
sides hold a unified rally on Aug. 15 in Seoul or in Pyongyang. 
  The rally should discuss "great leader" Kim Il-song's 
10-point declaration for national reunification and unity 
proposed a year ago, the letters said. 
  North Korea had tried to deliver the letters directly to the 
South on April 11, but the Seoul government refused to accept 
them. 
  The board said it will not send the letters to each 
addressee 
and instead put them on public view.

  [Text] Washington, April 26 (YONHAP) -- Robert Gallucci, 
assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs, 
says the United States hopes to resume working-level contacts 
with North Korea in New York this week. 
  "We hope that this week we'll be able to get back to North 
Korea -- almost certainly using the New York channel ... that we 
conduct talks at either the office-director or deputy 
assistant-secretary level," he said Tuesday. 
  Gallucci, who was recently named chairman of the senior 
policy steering group on Korea, made the remarks at the 
department's regular weekly press briefing upon returning from a 
trip to South Korea, China and Japan. 
  "We have consulted our allies, particularly South Korea, 
that 
we'll be able to go back to North Korea with a proposal," he 
said. 
  Gallucci declined to go into further detail about what the 
United States and its allies would propose. 
  But he said the new offer looked very much like the Feb. 25 
proposal in that it would contain similar elements. 
  One of these elements, of course, requires that North Korea 
maintain the continuity of safeguards, Gallucci said. 
  Washington is prepared to hold a third round of high-level 
talks with Pyongyang, he added. 
  Reiterating that the United States prefers a diplomatic 
solution to the nuclear dispute, Gallucci noted that the "Team 
Spirit" military exercise was suspended as "envisioned" in the 
Feb. 25 agreement between the United States and North Korea. 
  "Inter-Korean dialogue could also be an element," he said. 
"Advancing inter-Korean dialogue in some modality would also 
figure in such an arrangement." 
  Gallucci said the United States and its allies were not 
aiming to bring the North Korean nuclear issue back to the UN 
Security Council. 
  "Our objective is to stay away from the security council, 
get 
on with negotiations, and settle this through a diplomatic route 
and not have to go back to the security council," he said. 
  But if the director-general of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) makes a report judged by the security 
council to necessitate its further involvement, it will act 
accordingly, he said. 
  "(and) if they (security council) .... take up the issue, 
there is no doubt that there will be discussion about when and 
if sanctions ought to be considered, and what kinds of sanctions 
ought to be considered," he said. 
  He said the mere presence of IAEA inspectors at the Yongbyon 
nuclear complex when North Korea changes nuclear fuel rods at 
the 5- megawatt reactor is insufficient. 
  Gallucci declined to make any further comments, however. 
"I'm 
not going to go very far down that road because that's a road 
that really the IAEA has control of, as it ought to," he said. 
"It will not be sufficent for the IAEA inspectors to be in North 
Korea while this is happening. 
  "They (IAEA inspectors) are going to have more demanding 
sets 
of activities to be conducted if they are going to provide the 
assurances with respect to the history and disposition of that 
fuel that we expect of the agency," he said. 
  In any event, Gallucci said the United States would like to 
see North Korea's nuclear program essentially frozen while "we 
are engaged in these discussions." 
  "We would ask them to reconsider that step of refueling the 
reactor," he said. 
  He added, however, this was not a precondition for 
U.S.-North 
Korean talks. "We just generally think that is not a step in the 
right direction," he said. 
  Asked about the impression he had received from Chinese 
leaders in Beijing on the North Korean problem, Gallucci said, 
"they do not believe that the best route to a settlement of this 
issue is through UN Security Council sanctions." 
  "We also agree that this is not the best route," he said. 
"But it is for us the alternative if we can't find a diplomatic 
solution and negotiate a settlement."

  [Text] The United States is expected to put greater 
pressure on Korea to open its financial market wider and provide 
national treatment to U.S. financial institutions operating in 
Korea when the U.S. Congress passes a bill on financial services 
and fair trade. 
  U.S. delegates to recent bilateral talks on financial policy 
told their Korean counterparts that the U.S. Congress is 
expected to approve the Riegle bill "relatively soon," the 
Korean Ministry of Finance said yesterday. 
  The bill would allow the U.S. government to retaliate 
against 
nations that it regards as discriminating against U.S. financial 
institutions operating in that country when they fail to reach 
an accord on remedial measures after negotiations. 
  As signatories to the Uruguay Round accord on international 
trade, Korea and the United States are set to start negotiations 
on financial services six months after the accord takes effect 
next year. 
  The Korean Ministry of Finance said it suspects the United 
States would use the legislation as a tool to open up the Korean 
and other financial markets at post-Uruguay Round talks on 
financial services. 
  At the financial policy talks held in Washington Tuesday, 
the 
ministry said, the U.S. delegates demanded U.S. financial 
institutions operating in Korea be allowed to raise more funds 
in the Korean currency. 
  The Korean delegates told their U.S. counterparts that 
measures to be taken by the Korean government soon will make it 
easier for foreign financial institutions to raise funds in won. 
  Korea is set to reduce the minimum face value of negotiable 
certificates of deposit (CDs), ensure their maturities are 
flexible in a few months and advance financial liberalization 
programs contained in the third-phase plan for interest-rate 
deregulation. 
  The Korean delegates, headed by Assistant Finance Minister 
Im 
Chang-yul, said Korea will keep its promise to raise the 10 
percent ceiling on equity ownership of stock by foreigners 
during the second half of this year or next year. 
  Led By Assistant Treasury Secretary Jeffrey Shafer, the U.S. 
team asked the Korean government not to discriminate against 
U.S. business concerns when it allows Korean companies to set up 
auto sales financing companies. 
  The Korean delegates complained that redundant and frequent 
inspections by U.S. regulatory agencies hamper the business of 
Korean banks operating in the United States. 
  They also demanded Korean banks be permitted to advance into 
an area in Chicago where Korean-American residents are 
concentrated. The opening of branches by Korean banks in Chicago 
is now restricted to one area -- the Loop Zone, the Korean 
Ministry of Finance said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 27 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia 
have in principle agreed to mutually cooperate in the area of 
weapons system and military technology, a government official 
said on Wednesday. 
  He said Foreign and Defense Ministries are having close 
talks 
with their respective Russian counterparts based on the 
agreement. 
  "As part of cooperation in the military area, the two 
countries are currently studying the possible joint production 
of Russia's ultra-modern weapons," the official said. 
  He elaborated that in joint production, Russia will furnish 
expertise and South Korea necessary capital and marketing. 
  The official added, however, that such cooperation would 
hardly be endorsed by a formal agreement. 
  He reasoned that Russia's defense industry is different from 
Korea's in technological style and therefore their weapons and 
knowhow in some areas cannot be transferred to South Korea as 
they are. 
  "It also is almost impossible at this stage for Korea to 
introduce Russia's military expertise in return for the debts 
Russia owes to South Korea in economic cooperation credits," he 
said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- Japan's envoy asserted 
Thursday that his country would not go nuclear even if North 
Korea possessed atomic weapons. 
  "This (North Korean) nuclear issue has become a top priority 
issue and a symbolic issue for Japanese-Korean cooperation in 
the international society," Japanese Ambassador to Seoul Toshio 
Goto said at a luncheon hosted by the Korean Council on Foreign 
Relations. 
  "I would like to assure you, new Prime Minister Hata stands 
firm on this issue," he said. 
  Asked about the possibility of expanding bilateral military 
cooperation through such means as conducting joint drills, the 
ambassador said it could happen but first required careful 
consideration. 
  South Korea's defense minister visited Japan recently and 
agreed on exchange calls by naval vessels, an important symbolic 
gesture for two countries whose history is stained by more than 
three decades of colonial rule that culminated with the end of 
World War II. 
  "...It's a matter requiring delicate consideration from the 
standpoint of the sentiments of the Korean people," said Goto, 
referring to the colonial years. 
  He voiced hope that a time will come when people on both 
sides can cooperate "without prejudice." 
  Certain media reports were raising "unfounded suspicions" 
that Japan might change its non-nuclear policies should North 
Korea develop nuclear weapons, the envoy pointed out. 
  "There is no such possibility that Japan would decide to go 
nuclear... I would like to stress here that nuclearization 
would run counter to Japan's national interest," said Goto. 
  The ambassador highlighted regional stability and three key 
tasks involved -- encouraging coordination to settle regional 
conflicts, cooperating in promoting region-wide political and 
security dialogue, and enhancing the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum as the region's economic engine. 
  On bilateral terms, he agreed with South Korean President 
Kim 
Yong-sam's view that an accurate recognition of history is the 
only way to point their ties in a future- and world-oriented 
direction. 
  "I fully share the view that the Japan-Korea relationship is 
moving beyond the bilateral framework and has reached the phase 
of promoting cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and, 
moreover, in the international community," he said.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles and editorials published in Seoul vernacular newspapers 
on 28 April on ROK Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae's visit to 
Japan and on talks between the ROK and Japanese defense 
ministers now under way in Japan. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,000-word 
article by senior Tokyo-based correspondent Pae In-chun from the 
"Reporter's Eye" column entitled "Defense Minister Yi's 
Consciousness of 'ROK- Japan Military Exchanges.'" 
  The article reports that after holding talks with his 
Japanese counterpart Kazuo Aichi, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae 
said that the ROK will push ahead with military exchanges with 
Japan in a "quiet yet substantive" manner in view of "special 
relations" between the ROK and Japan in the past and of the 
"unnecessary irritation" of North Korea. Commenting on the 
possibility of Japan becoming a big military power, Defense 
Minister Yi said that Japan seems to be keenly aware of 
"concerns" by neighboring countries and the ROK's position is to 
"carefully watch" Japan's moves. Asked if Japan would regard a 
"reunified Korea" as the enemy, Minister Yi notes that the 
concept of the enemy would "change" according to the change in 
the situation. Observing that the ROK and Japanese defense 
authorities are striving to begin military exchanges between the 
ROK and Japan on the premise of North Korea's "threat," the 
article points out that Japan is emphasizing the North Korean 
"threat" more than the ROK. 
  TONG-A ILBO also publishes on page 5 a 1,300-word article by 
Ha Chun-u under the headline: "Significance and Prospect of 
ROK-Japan Defense Ministers' Talks." Noting that ROK Defense 
Minister Yi Pyong-tae's visit to Japan, the first of its kind in 
history, will be an occasion for activating ROK-Japan military 
exchanges, the article reports official talks between defense 
ministers of the two countries themselves mean the "official 
declaration" of military exchanges. The article notes that the 
ROK and Japan maintained a "military balance and stability" in 
Northeast Asia based on their respective military alliance with 
the United States, and held positions to deter military threats 
by the communist bloc. Nevertheless, the article notes, 
ROK-Japan military exchanges have been greatly restricted owing 
to the past colonial rule. Prompted by the collapse of the 
communist bloc, the two nations came to have a common 
understanding that their military exchanges should no longer be 
put aside. The article points out that during his visit to 
Japan, Defense Minister Yi discussed ways to seek "common 
interests" in military and security domains, and that the two 
sides reached an agreement even on "operational" matters, 
including rotating training of naval academy cadets, mutual 
visits of military ships, and prevention of accidental crashes 
of military aircraft. The article, however, predicts that 
although military exchanges between the two countries will be 
gradually expanded with Minister Yi's visit to Japan, such 
exchanges will likely remain "relaxed cooperative relations" for 
a considerable period of time, because formulation of military 
relations by concluding a military treaty or a peace treaty may 
touch off "dispute" over confirmation of territories and may not 
be appropriate in view of the flexible situation in Northeast 
Asia. Thus, the article concludes, drastic progress in military 
exchanges, including joint military exercises, will not be 
"likely" for the time being. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 
1,200-word editorial under the headline "Conditions of 
ROK-Japanese Military Ties." Describing the agreement to expand 
military exchanges and cooperation between the ROK and Japan as 
"significant," the editorial expresses the hope that the 
security ties between the two countries will contribute not only 
to "stability" on the Korean peninsula but also to "global 
peace." Recalling that our national sentiment hindered expansion 
of ROK-Japan military exchanges in the past, the editorial 
stresses that "regional security" has now emerged as a "mutual, 
common task" and that with independent strength of a nation, 
security cannot be guaranteed. Pointing to the ROK's effort to 
"diversify" its military friendly relations with China, Russia, 
and Germany, the editorial describes ROK-Japanese military 
exchanges as "desirable." The editorial, however, expresses 
"concern" over the possibility of Japan becoming a big military 
power, and stresses that cooperation between the two countries 
is necessary only on the premise that Japan will not become a 
big military power, and that military cooperation should start 
from the work of broadening "mutual trust and understanding."

  [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- Regardless of the pros 
and cons over the country's biggest business group entering the 
automaking industry, Samsung Heavy Industries is moving fast 
toward that goal by striking a deal with Japan's Nissan Motor Co. 
  Samsung, announcing a contract to adopt Nissan automaking 
technology Thursday, said its cars -- intended strictly for 
export -- will be patterned after three new 2-liter models made 
by Nissan. It plans to notify the Trade, Industry, and Energy 
Ministry of its agreement with the Japanese automaker as soon as 
possible. 
  Immediately after the announcement, Assistant Minister Pak 
Sam- kyu said his ministry will scrutinize the contract to 
determine whether it complies with related laws when Samsung 
submits a technology-import application. Although it looks fine 
at first glance, the announcement was made by the concerned 
company and may be different when studied from a legal 
viewpoint, he told reporters. 
  Under the contract, Nissan will transfer technology on its 
latest cars and jointly develop Korean models, as well as 
provide engineering assistance to localize the cars and know-how 
on running production lines. The two agreed to set no limits on 
export lines for Samsung and to give the Korean company full 
rights to change auto parts and design. The absence of limits on 
export lines and design changes is unprecedented in Korea's 
history of technology importation, a Samsung official said. 
  The key points to their agreement are that Samsung will have 
its own car brand and independently choose overseas markets, 
acquire the latest Nissan technologies including its unique VQ 
engine and QT suspension, and exchange information on sales, 
marketing and after- sales service. 
  In return, Samsung is to pay Nissan 1.9 billion yen (14.3 
billion won, or 17.7 million U.S. dollars) in royalties plus 1.6 
percent to 1.9 percent of the price of every warehouse release 
in technology fees. Moreover, it will pay 6.76 billion yen (50.7 
billion won) in delivery and technology fees for the three new 
models in order to acquire full authority over their sales in 
overseas markets. 
  Samsung had also been looking at Toyota of Japan and 
Volkswagen of Germany, but chose Nissan after it accepted most 
of Samsung's proposals. Nissan, with annual production capacity 
of 2.81 million cars and turnover of 27.4 trillion won last 
year, is the world's fifth biggest automaker after General 
Motors, Ford, Chrysler and Toyota. 
  Samsung was drawn by Nissan's world-class technology and its 
willingness to fully transfer advanced technologies. Samsung, 
which jumped into truck-making just last year, expects to start 
with 50,000 units in its first production year, the official 
said. It pledges to more than fulfill the 70-percent guideline 
set for localization to become a representative Korean exporter.

  [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
will name a new deputy prime minister and head of the National 
Unification Board (NUB), and possibly a few other cabinet 
members, if the National Assembly approves the appointment of Yi 
Yong-tok as prime minister by Thursday. 
  President Kim could carry out a partial cabinet reshuffle in 
consultation with Yi Yong-tok, who replaces Yi Hoe-chang, within 
Thursday. [sentence as received] 
  Parliamentary approval of the new prime minister has been 
stalled at the National Assembly over two other controversial 
issues. But it appeared possible that the Assembly would 
approve Yi Yong-tok's appointment during its plenary session 
which opens at 2 p.m. Thursday. 
  President Kim will then immediately hand credentials to Yi 
at 
Chongwadade [presidential office] and begin consultations to 
select, among others, Yi's successor as deputy prime minister 
and NUB minister, a Chongwadae official said. 
  If National Assembly approval comes later, a partial cabinet 
reshuffle will take place Friday morning, sources said. 
  President Kim will hold a cabinet meeting Friday.

  [Text] Seoul, April 27 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
plans to carry out a limited cabinet reshuffle as soon as the 
National Assembly approves the appointment of Yi Yong-tok as 
prime minister Thursday, sources said Wednesday. 
  There is a strong possibility that Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu may be picked to succeed Yi as deputy prime minister 
and minister of the National Unification Board (NUB), the 
sources said. 
  The ambassador to the United Nations, Yu Chong-ha, is being 
mentioned to replace Han as foreign minister, they added. 
  The limited cabinet shake-up will be performed by the 
president in consultation with the new prime minister. 
  "The appointment of the NUB minister will be made in the 
context of maintaining a consistent diplomatic and national 
security policy," said one source. "Consequently, the elevation 
of foreign minister Han to the deputy premiership is being 
studied since he had been in charge of the government's policy 
on the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  "As for Han's successor, I understand that (President Kim) 
plans to pick a career diplomat," he said. "Ambassador Yu 
follows the same line of thinking as Minister Han on the nuclear 
problem."

  [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- The Constitutional Court 
ruled Thursday that the Government Organization Law, which 
places the Agency for National Security Planning (NSP) under the 
direct control of the president, is allowed under the 
Constitution. 
  A panel of all the Constitutional Court judges, headed by 
Judge Hwang To-yon, handed down the ruling in an appeal filed by 
Rep. Pak Chan-chong of the new Political Reform Party and others. 
  Pak and his colleagues argued that the Government 
Organization Law violates the Constitution by putting the 
intelligence agency under the president, not the prime minister. 
  "The NSP could not be included in administrative ministries 
and offices' as specified in the 86th provision of the 
Constitution," the ruling said. 
  "It is a matter of course, therefore, that the NSP could not 
come under the control of the prime minister," it added. 
  Rep. Pak and 56 lawyers including practicing attorney Chang 
Ki-uk filed the appeal in May 1989 when Song Chong-tae, an aide 
to Rep. Yi Chol, was arrested by the NSP on charges of violating 
the Military Secret Protection Law. 
  They claimed that the NSP, which the government had no 
constitutional ground to establish, violated the Constitution 
when it arrested Song.

  [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- Rep. Yi Han-tong, floor 
leader of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP], was 
extremely upset Thursday as the main opposition Democratic Party 
[DP] insisted on calling 51 witnesses for the parliamentary 
investigation of the Sangmudae scam. 
  "Do they think they are some kind of commanders of occupying 
forces?" Yi said in a meeting with reporters Thursday, the last 
day of the National Assembly's current extraordinary session. 
  "Right now, the opposition party is making its demands as 
though the ruling party hasn't got any choice but to surrender," 
Yi said bitterly. 
  "How could there be compromises with an opponent like that?" 
the agitated floor leader asked rhetorically. 
  Commenting on the hardline taken by the opposition party, Yi 
theorized that it probably resulted from the power struggle 
between Chairman Yi Ki-taek and Rep. Kim Won-ki. 
  -- The presidential office at Chongwadae appeared to heave a 
sigh of relief as the opposition Democratic Party showed signs 
of retracting its demand that all cabinet ministers step down. 
  However, Chongwadae officials acted nonchalantly, asking, 
"isn't it a matter of course?" 
  One official was more cautious: "We have to keep watching 
the 
opposition party's attitude until the end." 
  The DP had been critical of President Kim Yong-sam when the 
chief executive forced Yi Hoe-chang to resign as prime minister 
for challenging the president's authority. 
  The opposition party has been tabling a kind of 
no-confidence 
vote against the cabinet. 
  But realizing that under the current constitution and the 
presidential form of government, the National Assembly has no 
right to file a no-confidence vote against the cabinet, the DP 
decided to seek the resignation of each and every cabinet member. 
  Then in a tricky parliamentary maneuver, the DP is demanding 
that all cabinet members be listed on one ballot slip with 
voting in one motion, in effect a no-confidence vote. 
  -- The ruling Democratic Liberal Party held a meeting of 
senior party postholders and renewed its determination to handle 
the three issues pending before the National Assembly Thursday, 
the last day of the extraordinary session. 
  DLP Spokesman Ha Sun-pong called on the opposition 
Democratic 
Party to cooperate in resolving the three issues based on the 
spirit of the constitution and parliamentary democracy. 
  --Over at the Democratic Party headquarters, the DP also 
held 
a meeting of the Supreme Council and reaffirmed that it would 
demand that the National Assembly call all 51 witnesses 
including former and current presidents for its investigation of 
the Sangmudae scam. 
  The issue of calling the 51 witnesses had been the main 
stumbling block in the current impasse over the DP's demand to 
investigate the Sangmudae scam. The legislation and judicial 
subcommittee agreed Wednesday night to conduct a parliamentary 
investigation for 20 days from Thursday.

  [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- The main opposition 
Democratic Party (DP) demanded Tuesday that the prosecution 
trace the whereabouts of a slush fund allegedly funnelled into 
the political arena by a contractor. 
  The DP pressed its demand by presenting the financial 
records 
of Cho Ki-hyon, president of Chungwoo Construction Co., to the 
National Assembly. 
  The DP's action came Tuesday afternoon as the Legislation 
and 
Judiciary Committee was forming a subcommittee to work out a 
schedule for parliamentary investigation of the "Sangmudae 
scandal." 
  The opposition party's maneuver is expected to become a 
red-hot political issue pitting the Democratic Liberal Party 
(DLP) against the DP as the ruling party maintains that tracing 
the money runs counter to the real-name financial system. 
  A DP special committee probing the Sangmudae affair, chaired 
by Rep. Chong Tae-chol, told a press conference that spending 
records are listed in a suit against Cho, who has been indicted 
on charges of embezzlement. 
  Calling it "a list of criminal activities," the committee 
presented a copy of the document to the National Assembly. It 
showed Cho had an alleged slush fund amounting to 22.7 billion 
won, with 18.9 billion won having been spent between November 
1991 and December 1992. 
  In addition, the DP said that Cho used 3.8 billion won for 
"business expenses" which, it claimed, could very well have been 
lobbying outlays for his company. 
  Cho's Chungwoo Construction Co., along with Hyundai 
Construction Co., received a multi-billion-won order to relocate 
military facilities called "Sangmudae" from Kwangju city to its 
outskirts. 
  The DP alleges that Cho created a slush fund out of money he 
received from the defense ministry and diverted a large part of 
it to the ruling camp during the 1992 presidential campaign. 
  At Tuesday's press conference, the opposition party charged 
the prosecution with trying to cover up or minimize the scandal 
by not tracing the whereabouts of money spent by Cho. 
  "If the prosecution has any intention to find out where 
checks issued from the slush fund have gone, there is no need 
for the National Assembly to undertake a parliamentary 
investigation," one committee member said. 
  The DP has been under pressure from the ruling party to 
produce material evidence to substantiate its charges. 
  Tuesday's presentation of a copy of Cho's financial 
transactions, therefore, was seen as the DP's answer to the DLP 
demand. 
  If the prosecution refused to trace the checks, the 
opposition party could claim that the probe into Cho's slush 
fund had failed because of the uncooperative attitude of the DLP 
and the government.

  [Text] Seoul, April 27 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
exhorted his economic ministers on Wednesday to expedite 
legislation covering private-sector infrastructure investment to 
help increase the nation's global competitiveness. 
  Presiding over the monthly economic meeting to review the 
five- year "new economy" development plan at the Kwachon 
government building complex, Kim said construction of airports, 
roads and other public utilities should draw on private as well 
as public funds, like in Japan and Europe, because of the 
enormous costs. 
  He reiterated the need for industrial peace, stressing that 
labor-management cooperation is a major factor in increasing a 
country's competitive power on the world market. 
  Kim then instructed the ministers to act against inflation 
and the increasing balance-of-payments deficit, relax rules 
governing economic activity on a continual basis, and complete 
economic reforms within the year. 
  "It's good to note the economy is recovering rapidly," he 
said, "but I'm concerned about the increasing 
balance-of-payments deficit and I want you to solve this problem 
not by reducing imports but by increasing exports." 
  The chief executive also directed the ministers to take 
special steps to create an environment in which civil servants 
can work well, noting that some public servants wrongly think 
that the harder they work, the greater their losses. 
  Vice Economic Planning Minister Han I-hon reported that the 
government would complete a rural development plan by the end of 
May to help farmers overcome difficulties stemming from the farm 
market opening under the Uruguay Round accord. 
  In June, the government will formulate a supplementary 
budget 
of 300-400 billion won (about 500 million U.S. dollars), based 
on the special rural tax to be levied in the second half of the 
year, to finance the plan, he added. 
  Over 1.3 trillion won will be provided to small- and 
medium-sized firms to boost technological innovation and sharpen 
their products' competitive edge on the world market. 
  Because parliament will need time to pass the pending 
legislation on private investment in infrastructure and to amend 
related laws, the government will prepare guidelines on such 
investment so that private firms can get involved in 
infrastructure projects during the first half of next year, Han 
reported. 
  Toward the end of the meeting, President Kim exhorted the 
economic ministers to unite around Economic Planning Minister 
Chong Chae-sok, indicating that the coming cabinet reshuffle 
after parliamentary approval of Yi Yong-tok as the new prime 
minister would not affect the economic team.

  [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- The business climate 
showed signs of recovery in the first quarter with production, 
investment, consumption and employment generally increasing, the 
National Statistical Office said Thursday. 
  Industrial production rose by 10.2 percent in January-March 
from the same period last year, spurred by brisk business in the 
automobile, machinery, video, audio, communications, and 
beverage and food sectors. This marked the first increase since 
the last quarter of 1991, according to the office. 
  Light-industry production inched up 1.2 percent in the first 
three months over a year earlier after undergoing a continuous 
fall since the second quarter of 1992, while the heavy and 
chemical industries posted a 13.7-percent rise in output. The 
operating rate of the manufacturing industry reached as high as 
82.4 percent between January and March. 
  Wholesale and retail sales increased 7.1 percent in the 
first 
quarter over the same quarter last year, with consumer goods 
sales in the domestic market rising 6.6 percent during the 
period. Orders for machinery except ships rose 32.0 percent, and 
authorized machinery imports soared 51.6 percent during the 
January-March period over a year ago, showing domestic 
businesses' brisk investment. 
  The population over age 15 increased 568,000 from a year ago 
in the cited period to 32,785,000, while the number of 
economically active people who are employed or willing to be 
employed rose 674,000 to 20,042,000. The figure shows that more 
people are seeking jobs in line with the business recovery, 
according to the office. The number of employed stood at 
19,431,000 in March, up 673,000 from the same month last year. 
The jobless figure reached 611,000 in the same month, up 1,000 
from a year ago, for an unemployment rate of 3.0 percent. 
  Those employed in the agricultural, forestry and fisheries 
industry fell 255,000 from March last year to 2,499,000 last 
month, while workers in the mining and manufacturing industries 
increased 100,000 to 4,701,000. Of workers in the mining and 
manufacturing industries, those in the manufacturing sector -- 
which had been falling since September 1991 -- increased to 
4,660,000 in March, up 121,000 from a year ago. 
  The number rose by 53,000 in January this year over last 
year, by 71,000 in February and 121,000 in March, showing that 
manufacturing is enjoying a business upturn this year. 
  The coincidence indicator showing the current state of the 
economy was a relatively low 0.4 percent in March, but the 
leading economic indicators stood at 1.0 percent, predicting a 
further business boom. 
  Cho Hui-kap, director general of the Statistical Survey 
Bureau, said, "considering the various business indicators, I 
judge that the brisk business is likely to continue."

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Chae Hui-muk] </F>
  [Text] Domestic business groups, including Hyundai and 
Samsung, have been busy in preparing measures to cope with the 
rapidly changing trade environment after the Uruguay Round 
accord was signed by more than 120 nations in Marrakesh last 
week. 
  Few clauses of the accord affecting Korea were changed, 
except the agricultural sector, during the last week's 
ministerial conference in the Moroccan city as the accord 
formulated on Dec. 15 last year has remained untouched. 
  But wider opening of the domestic car market became a hot 
issue at bilateral trade ministers talks with the United States 
and the European Union (EU). 
  Observers viewed that Korea will be obliged to open the car 
market wider as the two countries have insisted on it. 
  Environment and labor issues are expected to be closely 
linked with trade as the Green Round (GR) and Blue Round (BR) 
are expected to be the next global issues to the Uruguay Round 
which has created a world trade "watchdog," the World Trade 
Organization (WTO). 
  The observers forecast that the two issues will be an 
obstacle to expansion of Korea's exports with environment 
protection and labor rights in Korea are still below the 
standard of advanced nations. 
  First of all, domestic auto manufacturers are expected to 
face a flood of foreign cars in view of strong pressure from the 
United States and the EU to allow easier access of their 
manufacturers to the Korean car market. 
  U.S. automakers insist that Korea lower tariff rates on 
foreign cars from 10 percent to the 2.5 percent imposed by the 
U.S. government and that the acquisition tax on deluxe cars 
valued at 70 million won or more be slashed from 15 percent to 2 
percent. 
  They also called on Korea to advance the abolition of 
restrictions on the acreage of indoor exhibition of their cars 
slated for Jan. 1, 1996, and on advertisements in domestic media. 
  Advanced nations are expected to put more pressure on Korea 
to open its markets wider through bilateral and multilateral 
negotiations on the occasion of the inauguration of the WTO as 
seen in the automobile sector. 
  In this changing environment, domestic business groups have 
been forming teams exclusively for trade negotiations on both 
group and subsidiary firm levels, while allocating more trade 
negotiation experts. 
  Samsung Group has installed an environmental research 
institute in the secretariat office to prepare for possible 
green ground negotiations and has increased the number of trade 
negotiation experts in subsidiary firms to cope with frequent 
anti-dumping suits in advanced nations. 
  Hyundai Group has diverted some 50 trade experts in Hyundai 
Corp. to automobile and shipbuilding subsidiaries which are 
expected to face an uphill battle with foreigners. 
  Lucky-Goldstar, Daewoo and Pohang Iron and Steel Co. have 
been training trade experts by region and commodity. 
  But analysts said that the UR accord will be favorable to 
domestic manufacturers, except agriculture, the wholesale and 
retail sector and intellectual properties. 
  They forecast that exports will increase sharply but imports 
will not grow as fast as the exports do. 
  Steel and petrochemical manufacturers will benefit most as 
tariffs will be reduced to zero in 10 years. 
  The steel industry, in top notch shape in competitiveness, 
is 
expected to increase products due to a gradual tariff rate cut 
to zero, while benefiting from decreasing tariff on raw 
materials of iron ore and coking coal, the analysts said. 
  The petrochemical industry will witness similar benefits as 
tariff rates of trading partners are high at 20-200 percent 
compared to 9 percent imposed by Korea. Tariff rates are to be 
cut gradually to zero over 10 years. 
  In the electronics sector, Korea's exports are predicted to 
increase, while foreign products are expected to rapidly make 
inroads into the domestic market as well. A plus factor is that 
more than 60 percent of domestic electronics production are 
exported. In particular, more than 90 percent of semi-conductor 
production is exported. 
  In the textile sector, Korea's exports will be little 
affected for the time being as an import quota exists for 10 
years with each item gradually being liberalized in import as 
demanded by Korea in the Uruguay Round talks. 
  But the domestic textile industry needs to switch from 
low-price items to high value-added ones to turn away any 
challenges of developing nations. 
  But general machinery is expected to flood the nation as 
Korean manufacturers heavily depend on foreign products, the 
analysts said. Scrapping subsidies will only drive domestic 
makers out of their domestic markets, they said.

  [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says 
the threat of more air strikes by NATO to protect United Nations 
safe areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina provides some ground for 
optimism. Senator Evans said he supports the decision and hopes 
the show of force will bring all parties back to the negotiating 
table. However, he warns that the threat of bombing alone may 
not be enough to stop the violence in Bosnia. 
  [Begin Evans recording] Well, it is not clear that there is 
any other alternative at the moment. I mean the downside risks 
are that the bombing won't be enough without ground support of 
the kind that there is still no will to supply. The risk is 
also that this kind of action in these new exclusionary zones 
will simply generate additional complications elsewhere. [End 
recording] 
  Meanwhile, Senator Evans has welcomed the Zulu Inkatha 
Party's decision to participte in the South African elections, 
saying it should reduce the level of violence in the country. 
  Senator Evans said although sporadic violence can still be 
expected in South Africa in the lead-up to the election, the 
across-the-board bloodbath which was feared can hopefully be 
avoided.

<F P=106> [Article by Tom Burton: "Keating: A Head of Steam and Full </F>
Steam Ahead"] 
  [Text] There are many in Canberra who would sympathise 
with Vietnamese Communist Party leader, Do Muoi. From all 
accounts, the aging political leader caught Paul Keating in full 
flight when they met on Tuesday in Ho Chi Minh city. 
  As many a Canberra minister and bureaucrat knows, Keating 
fired up, arguing about an issue he has strong views about, is 
an awesomely persuasive and believable figure. 
  With Do Muoi, it was Keating's fast-developing ideas about 
the future of the West Pacific region which made the Prime 
Minister passionate. 
  There is a veneer of poverty and deprivation in Vietnam 
caused by decades of war. But Vietnamese society is highly 
intellectual and sophisticated, and as one Australian official 
observed, you don't get to be General-Secretary of the ruling 
party in Vietnam without having considerable intelligence. 
  You also don't get to be party leader in a one-party State 
that has been through the cathartic experiences of Vietnam, 
without substantial political steel and authority. 
  Keating can be a diffident and socially awkward person, but 
engages quickly with anyone who brings power and intellect to 
their arguments and it was this meeting of minds which caused 
seasoned foreign affairs officials from both sides - to claim 
they had never seen anything like it. 
  According to witnesses, Do Muoi soon realised he was dealing 
with a very unorthodox political leader and, dropping the usual 
protocol-driven rules which suffocate so many 
government-to-government meetings in Asia, engaged Keating in a 
blunt and frank 90-minute discussion. 
  From all accounts it was an extraordinary meeting -- the 
young assertive Western leader of a multi-party developed 
capitalist State, describing a contemporary economic and 
strategic vision for the region; the 77-year-old communist chief 
sharing the wisdom and lessons of decades of political struggle 
and war. 
  The meeting was extended as Do Muoi and Keating spoke on 
topics as diverse as the need to reform the United Nations, the 
necessity for a strong US presence in the region to placate 
historical tensions, Cambodia, APEC and the advantages of 
privatised infrastructure development. 
  Despite his anger with the media over his self-inflicted 
brewing domestic controversy surrounding the acknowledgement of 
Australia's war effort in Vietnam, Keating was elated with the 
meeting and the genuine understandings that emerged. 
  In the past 12 months Keating has met all the major Asian 
region leaders at least once -- and in several cases a number of 
times - as part of what is undoubtedly now his major policy and 
intellectual obsession: Australia's engagement with Asia. 
  Adopting the highly personal style that worked so 
successfully with Do Muoi, Keating has embarked on a mission to 
develop a series of significant diplomatic relationships with 
the influential leaders of the region. 
  In Bangkok he had a not-dissimilar meeting with Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai and several key Thai ministers, with 
Chuan inviting Keating to talk to him whenever he wanted to 
raise any issues. 
  Thailand and Vietnam are the two most influential countries 
in Indochina and Keating gave an insight to his thinking and 
regional policy strategy when on Tuesday he said he wanted to 
emulate with them the type of relationship he had been able to 
develop with Indonesia over the past two years. 
  Keating's successful personal courting of Indonesia's 
President Suharto -- together with the strong links foreign 
ministers Gareth Evans and Ali Alatas have developed -- has 
changed the entire atmospherics of Australia's previously 
fractious relationship with the archipelago. 
  Early on, Keating recognised the political and strategic 
weight of Indonesia in the region and consciously sought to 
build a strong personal relationship with Suharto, even using a 
meeting with US President Bill Clinton to impress on Clinton 
Suharto's influence. 
  Similarly he sees Thailand and Vietnam as the two other key 
major players in Southeast Asia and with his unique, high-energy 
diplomatic style, he used his trips to the region to focus on 
the key leaders in both countries -- which, unlike Indonesia, 
are not concentrated on one man. 
  While issues such as Mabo, the republic and the long-term 
unemployed remain of strong interest, it is clear that building 
a complex and highly integrated relationship with the Western 
Pacific region to ensure Australia's rightful place in the 
region is now Keating's major intellectual obsession. 
  And just as he made economic reform Canberra's preoccupation 
of the 1980s, Keating is making the development of economic and 
strategic links with Asia the government's major focus of the 
l990s. 
  Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke also sought to build 
personal 
relationships --but they were mostly with the US and China -- 
especially understandable in a decade where superpower rivalry 
still permeated foreign policy thinking. 
  And while Keating is bringing enormous attention to the 
region, it was Hawke who laid the groundwork through his 
interest in China and initiation of APEC and the Garnaut report 
on North-East Asia. 
  But Keating's huge policy strength is his ability to place 
issues in a co-ordinated framework. It is why neo-classical 
economics appealed to him so much and it is why he is now so 
preoccupied by the challenge of foreign policy -- integrating 
the often contradictory political, economic, strategic and 
social elements into a cohesive strategy for the region. 
  And just as he was self-taught in economics, Keating is 
using 
his intense focus on the region to build from the ground up his 
understanding of the area and its often complex histories and 
rivalries. 
  Less than a year ago when visiting Korea, he was almost 
surprised to be getting questions on strategic issues and his 
response reflected his lack of exposure to these concerns. 
  Ten months later and Keating was this week lecturing the 
Vietnamese on why the challenge was to keep the US economically 
engaged in the region so as to keep its strategic focus on -- 
and with it, stability in -- the Western Pacific zone. 
  The key element of Keating's new regionalism is the 
development of a broadbased relationship with the region as 
possible through strong personal links with the leaders, backed 
by ministerial councils and visits and highly active diplomatic 
support. 
  It is unashamedly targeted at building Australia's trade and 
investment prospects, with the main targets those countries 
considered to have the most medium-to long-term economic upside 
such as Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia where growth is likely 
to be strongest. 
  This also reflects a strategic view that these countries, 
via 
their population size and profile, are likely to be the 
significant military powers. At the same time more aid money is 
being used to profile Australian proficiency and to give better 
leverage on human rights, such as was the case in Vietnam. 
  But while human rights abuses and labour infringements are 
complained about, they are pushed as part of a broader package 
of what the diplomats call "constructive engagement"-- which 
avoids the difficulties the US is facing now over the granting 
of trade concessions in return for improvements in human rights. 
  Nor does Keating allow himself to get fussed if he is 
dealing 
with a one-party autocracy -- "you deal with them as they come," 
he said during his Indo-China visit. 
  This pragmatism and balance gives the policy a robustness 
which to date appears to be doing the trick. 
  Fortunately Keating is blessed with a foreign policy 
bureaucracy that as long ago as when Bill Hayden was Foreign 
Minister decided to cross the line and support Vietnam and has 
built an enviable reputation for activism and professionalism in 
the region. 
  However, Keating's style is not to adopt the official brief 
as if he is a lawyer for the bureaucratic establishment. When 
discussing issues with officials ahead of events on the most 
recent trip, he constantly asked questions, testing his 
hypothesis in a socratic style of analysis. 
  Which means that the final position is intimately Keating's, 
a position which one senior official this week described as 
having "deep roots". 
  It is this intensity of his purpose and the passion of 
Keating's mission to build Australia into the commercial and 
political forums and structures of the region, which makes it 
plain silly to characterise his "new regionalism" as just 
another leader getting his kicks from playing international 
statesman. 
  Indeed, the aim is to develop a situation whereby so 
familiar 
are the relations at both leader, ministerial and official level 
that visits can be classed as working visits, with far less 
formality, such as occurred with Suharto when Keating returned 
from CHOGM [Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting] in spring 
last year. 
  All he has to do is keep his ever-acerbic tongue under 
control.

<F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Statement" issued during a news </F>
conference for domestic and foreign reporters in Pyongyang on 28 
April] 
  [Text] The illegal acts [pulpop haengwi] of the United 
States to infringe upon the Korean Armistice Agreement and to 
paralyze [mabi sikida] the supervisory organization of the 
armistice have reached a peak. 
  By rupturing [kyolyol] the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks 
that envisaged the prospect for a satisfactory solution to the 
problem of DPRK-U.S. relations, the United States is now 
deploying armed forces on a large scale on the Korean peninsula 
and its surrounding areas. 
  The United States finally brought new-type Patriot missiles 
into South Korea in defiance of the unanimous rejection of our 
people and the public opinion of the world. It has been learned 
that the United States will deploy Patriot missiles for an 
actual war [silchon paebihada] by the end of April and will even 
stage the Team Spirit 94 joint military exercise--a nuclear war 
exercise--in November of this year. 
  The United States, which has already reinforced the Apache 
helicopter battalion in South Korea, is going to bring various 
one brigade-class combat equipment in the future. 
  The U.S. Marine forces, which have been concentrated on 
areas 
around our country, have not been removed. Thus, the United 
States itself showed that it totally abrogated [pagi] the Korean 
Armistice Agreement reached with us in the name of the United 
Nations. 
  A basic condition for maintaining the armistice status on 
the 
Korean peninsula is to not bring operational materials from 
outside and not reinforce armed forces. 
  Nevertheless, the United States has unilaterally abrogated 
what was agreed upon in the agreement since it signed the Korean 
Armistice Agreement in July 1953, and has brought modern 
weapons, including 1,000-odd nuclear weapons, into South Korea. 
  In the past, the United States brought numerous armed 
forces, 
including nuclear weapons, into South Korea in a secret and 
concealed manner in fear of the Korean Armistice Agreement. 
Today, however, it openly brings in and deploys new-type of 
missiles and combat technological equipment in broad daylight. 
This illustrates that the United States does not recognize the 
validity of the Korean Armistice Agreement and is ignoring its 
existence. 
  Contrary to its duty as a real party to the Armistice 
Agreement [chongjon hyopchongui silchejogin tangsajaroso chinin 
uimue paechidoege], for over the past 40 years, the United 
States has not only systematically violated and obliterated 
[chegyejoguro yurin malsal] the provisions of the agreement but 
it has even paralyzed the organization in charge of supervising 
the implementation of the armistice [chongjon kamsi kigu majo 
mabisikiotta]. 
  When the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams disclosed the U.S. 
violations of the Armistice Agreement after the agreement had 
been signed, the United States unilaterally and forcibly had 
removed [ilbangjoguro kangje cholsu sikyossumyo] the Neutral 
Nations Inspection Teams, which were organized under Paragraph 3 
of Clause 2 of the Armistice Agreement, from its area in June 
1956. And, it appointed a general of the South Korean Armed 
Forces, who is not legally suitable or qualified [amuron 
bomnyulchok tadangsongdo chagyokto omnun] in view of the 
Armistice Agreement, as senior member of its side in March 1991 
and, thus, made the armistice organization incapable of 
performing its function. 
  Because of these unreasonable acts [pudanghan chosa] of the 
United States, the Korean Armistice Agreement has today turned 
into an empty sheet of paper that cannot guarantee peace on the 
Korean peninsula, and the Military Armistice Commission has 
become an organization in which no one is in charge and turned 
nominal [chuini omnun kigurodo yumyongmusirhage toeotta] as a 
matter of fact. 
  The United States has so far systematically abrogated [pagi] 
the Armistice Agreement and is now threatening us with the force 
of arms [himuro], while building up massive forces on a large 
scale on the Korean peninsula and its vicinity. In view of 
this, we can more clearly see that its hidden intention [soksim] 
is to crush [apsal] the socialist countries in Asia, including 
our country. 
  The United States is bringing forces and armed equipment 
into 
South Korea as it pleases [maumdaero] and aggravating the 
situation on the Korean peninsula as it pleases [chemaumdaero], 
thus, bringing the situation to the brink of war. Nevertheless, 
the Armistice Agreement cannot fulfill its role as a systematic 
device [chedojok changchi] in preventing this. This is a 
reality. Under these circumstances, the question of what in the 
world [todaeche] the Armistice Agreement or the armistice 
organization is necessary for arises. 
  Under the present circumstances in which the Korean 
Armistice Agreement and the armistice organ [chongjon kigu] can 
take no responsibility in bringing stability to the situation on 
the Korean peninsula and stopping military buildup [muryok 
chunggangul mangnundeso] but are used to shield the U.S. policy 
of crushing our country [urinarae taehan migugui apsal 
chongchaegul karinunde iyongdoegoinnun], it is natural that we 
can no longer hold any expectations of such an agreement and 
institution. 
  The state of armistice has been maintained and peace has 
prevailed on the Korean peninsula up to the present because of 
our Republic's patient peace-loving policy and volition. 
  A series of complicated and acute problems, including the 
nuclear issue, are raised today on the Korean peninsula. This 
is connected with the continuation of the armistice system which 
defines us and the United States--the actual parties to the 
Armistice Agreement--as the two warring opponents [choktae 
ssangbang]. 
  The state of armistice of the fifties remains intact today 
after 40 years have elapsed. This is abnormal in every respect. 
The developments [cheban sate] created on the Korean peninsula 
demand that the Armistice Agreement be replaced by a peace 
agreement without fail and that a peace-guaranteeing system that 
substitutes the present armistice organ be established in order 
to eliminate the hostile relations between the DPRK and the 
United States, to achieve reconciliation, and to guarantee 
genuine peace and security on the Korean peninsula. 
  In this connection, the DPRK Government proposes to the 
United States that negotiations be held for the establishment of 
a new peace guaranteeing system, which can prevent military 
buildup and the recurrence of war on the Korean peninsula, 
stabilize the situation, and practically and reliably guarantee 
solid peace and security. 
  The United States should discard the concept of 
confrontation 
and the war mentality [taegyol kwannyomgwa chonjaeng simni] and 
respond to this peace proposal we are making.

<F P=106> ["DPRK Government Proposes to USA To Hold Negotiation for </F>
Establishment of New Peace Arrangement" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- The Foreign Ministry 
of the DPRK issued a statement today on the DPRK Government's 
position for the establishment of a new peace arrangement that 
will substitute for the present armistice mechanism in order to 
achieve non-hostile relations and rapprochement between the DPRK 
and the USA and establish genuine peace and security on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  The statement reads in full: 
  The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
  The illegalities of the United States in violating the 
Korean 
Armistice Agreement and paralyzing the armistice supervisory 
mechanism have now reached the climax. 
  The United States wrecked the third round of DPRK-USA talks 
when there emerged prospects of resolving satisfactorily the 
issues with respect to DPRK-USA relations, and now is massively 
deploying its Armed Forces on and around the Korean peninsula. 
  Despite the unanimous opposition of our people and the world 
public, the United States has defiantly shipped "Patriot" 
new-type missiles into South Korea for their combat-ready 
deployment by the end of April, and reportedly intends to force 
the "Team Spirit '94" joint military exercises, a nuclear war 
game, in November this year. 
  The United States has already beefed up its air fleet in 
South Korea with a squadron of "Apache" helicopters, and is 
reported to be planning to introduce various types of 
brigadesize combat armaments in the future. On the other hand, 
the U.S. Naval forces, which have clustered around the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, still stand by there, far 
from breaking up. 
  Thus, the United States has revealed through its own actions 
that it has scrapped completely the Korean Armistice Agreement, 
which was signed by the United States in the name of the United 
Nations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  The fundamental requirements for maintaining the armistice 
arrangement are non-introduction of any operational materiel 
from abroad and cessation of arms buildup on the Korean 
peninsula now in a state of cease-fire. This notwithstanding, 
the United States has unilaterally broken the provisions of the 
Korean Armistice Agreement all along ever since the very year 
when it signed the agreement of July 1953, and introduced into 
South Korea up-to-date military hardware, including over 1,000 
nuclear weapons. 
  It was at least for fear of a possible exposure of its 
intentional violations of the Korean Armistice Agreement that 
the United States had previously engaged in a camouflaged and 
clandestine introduction of an enormous quantity of its nuclear 
weapons and other armaments into South Korea, but these days the 
United States is shipping in and deploying its sophisticated 
missiles and combat technical equipment there openly and in 
broad daylight. This vividly shows that the United States has 
disowned the effectiveness of the Korean Armistice Agreement and 
ignores even its existence. 
  Over the period of a little more than four decades, the 
United States has acted against its own obligations as the real 
party to the Armistice Agreement, not only violating and 
invalidating the provisions of the agreement systematically but 
also paralyzing the armistice supervisory mechanism. 
  In the years that followed the conclusion of the Armistice 
Agreement, the United States violated the agreement. As its own 
violations of the agreement were detected and disclosed by the 
neutral nations inspection teams of the neutral nations 
supervisory commission, the United States unilaterally forced 
the inspection teams to withdraw from the United Nations 
command-controlled area in June 1956, although the inspection 
teams were established pursuant to Section C of the Article II 
of the Armistice Agreement. Moreover, the United States 
malfunctioned the armistice mechanism in March 1991 when it 
designated a South Korean Army "general" as the chief delegate 
of the United Nations command to the Military Armistice 
Commission, for which he is totally unqualified because of legal 
irrelevance of this action to the Armistice Agreement. 
  Such unreasonable behaviour on the part of the United States 
has now turned the Korean Armistice Agreement into blank sheets 
of paper incapable of helping to ensure peace on the Korean 
peninsula and reduced the Military Armistice Commission to a de 
facto nominal and inoperative body in which its legitimate 
component parties have ceased to exist. 
  So far, the United States has systematically undermined the 
provisions of the Armistice Agreement, and is now threatening 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with force, while 
deploying its massive reinforcements on and around the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Such actions only add greater clarity to the United States' 
ulterior intent to strangle the socialist countries in Asia, 
including the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  The current reality is that while the United States is 
behaving itself unchallenged in shipping its Armed Forces and 
armaments into South Korea and in aggravating the situation on 
the Korean peninsula to the brink of war at its discretion, the 
Armistice Agreement has proven itself so ineffective and 
helpless that it cannot play any role as an institutional 
mechanism established to prevent these actions. This situation 
poses a question of what are purposes the Armistice Agreement or 
armistice mechanism is intended to serve. 
  It is quite natural that the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea will no longer entertain any expectations of the Korean 
Armistice Agreement and armistice mechanism, now that they have 
failed to live up to their responsibility for stabilizing the 
situation on the Korean peninsula and curbing military buildup 
there and they have been used for covering up the United States' 
policy of strangling the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  It is only thanks to the patient and peace-loving policy and 
will of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that the 
armistice has so far stayed in place and peace has been 
maintained on the Korean peninsula. 
  A number of complicated and acute problems, including the 
nuclear issue, have cropped up on the Korean peninsula today due 
to the continued existence of the armistice under which the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States, the 
signatories to the Armistice Agreement, are the parties to 
hostilities. It is abnormal, on every account, that the state 
of ceasefire of the 1950s should have lasted unchanged for four 
decades up to date. 
  All the developments on the Korean peninsula highlight the 
absolute necessity for establishing a peace arrangement, that 
will replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement and 
substitute for the present armistice mechanism, with a view to 
achieving non-hostile relations and rapprochement between the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States and 
to establishing genuine peace and security on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  In this connection, the Government of the Democratic 
People's 
Republic of Korea proposes to the United States of America that 
the two countries hold negotiations for the establishment of a 
new peace arrangement which will help to prevent arms buildup or 
recurrence of war, stabilize the situation and reliably 
guarantee durable peace and security on the Korean peninsula on 
a practical basis. The United States must renounce its 
confrontation-oriented concept and war psychology and respond to 
the above peace proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea.

  [Excerpt] Thailand has no involvement in the continuing 
Cambodian conflict, which is between the Phnom Penh government 
and the Khmer Rouge, and any monitoring along the border should 
be on Cambodian soil, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said. 
  Phnom Penh has an absolute right to request United Nations 
officers based in the capital to monitor the situation along the 
Thai-Cambodian border, Prasong said. 
  "But if the UN officers want to conduct any monitoring on 
the 
Thai side, they have to ask the Thai government first. We, 
Thailand, are not a party to the conflict and therefore we 
should have nothing to do with the border monitoring," he said. 
  The minister was referring to a report that Cambodia is 
requesting the UN to extend the operations of its 30-strong 
mission based in Phnom Penh to allow them to monitor the border 
situation. 
  He stressed that any monitoring from Thai soil would require 
prior approval from Bangkok. 
  Bangkok had earlier turned down a request by the UN 
Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) to set up checkpoints 
on the Thai side of the border, saying it would be a violation 
of the nation's sovereignty. 
  A senior Foreign Ministry official said yesterday the Phnom 
Penh request to the United Nations was apparently based on 
suspicions that Thailand still supports the guerrilla faction. 
  The official, who asked for anonymity, said the Cambodian 
conflict would become an international issue if the UN mission 
was involved in a military confrontation with the guerrillas. 
  Thailand would probably reject any request for the UN 
mission 
to operate on Thai soil, the official said, and as a result 
would again be accused of helping the Khmer Rouge. 
  Minister Prasong said the Burapha task force was still 
investigating the most recent spillover from fighting inside 
Cambodia which resulted in two Thai villagers being seriously 
injured at Rongklu market in Sa Kaeo's Aranyaprathet district. 
  Prasong said he was ready to explain Thailand's position to 
Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut, who is 
visiting Indonesia and France, and was confident that any 
misunderstandings could be settled at government level. [passage

  [Excerpt] Dear friends: The 919th Flight Group of 
Vietnam's National Civil Aviation Sector will turn 35 years old 
on 1 May this year. Beginning as an air squadron with 15 
pilots, 13 mechanics, and 14 navigators, the 919th Flight Group 
has grown and made substantial contributions to the cause of 
national defense and construction. You, friends, are invited to 
listen to the following essay by Minh Duc, a correspondent of 
Radio Voice of Vietnam, entitled: 35 Years of Operations and 
Growth of the 919th Air Group: 
  On 15 February 1965, the 919th Air Force Regiment shot down 
a 
U.S.-owned C-123 aircraft in Yen Bai airspace, annihilating an 
enemy commando team aboard the aircraft. This was its first 
aerial victory over the enemy that opened up the air-to-air 
battlefront for the Vietnamese People's Army. 
  On the night of 8 March 1966, an AN2 plane from the regiment 
sank a boat carrying U.S. and Puppet commandos in the sea of 
Thanh Hoa, thus starting an air-to-sea battlefront for the 
Vietnamese People's Air Force. 
  We had the opportunity to meet the old pilots of the former 
919th Air Force Regiment now known as the 919th Flight Group. 
All of them, whether they had already retired or continue to 
serve as pilots, share the same military habit, that is, 
speaking less and working hard. Mr. Nguyen Ai Dong, one of the 
first team leaders of the 919th regiment is a man of such 
qualities. He was very excited when recounting his memories of 
how he flew Uncle Ho to go on TDY. [passage omitted on Nguyen Ai 
Dong recounting story about his flying Ho Chi Minh to go on TDY

  [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- The Hosokawa cabinet, 
which resigned en masse on Monday [25 April], was temporarily 
resuscitated Tuesday night to deal with issues surrounding the 
crash of a China Airlines jetliner at Nagoya Airport in which 
some 220 people died. 
  Setting aside the differences that have brought Japan's 
political machine in Tokyo to a virtual standstill, former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and his ex-cabinet ministers of 
different political stripes were busy contacting each other to 
keep abreast of developments in the air disaster. 
  At a hastily arranged emergency cabinet session, Transport 
Minister Shigeru Ito, of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan, 
SDPJ] (SDP), was appointed head of a special task force to 
oversee the government's handling of the plane crash, government 
officials said. 
  Ito and Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato, also of the SDP, 
will arrive in Nagoya Airport early Wednesday by helicopter. 
  The SDP said early Tuesday it was quitting the post-Hosokawa 
coalition government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata due to the 
sudden formation by five parties of an intraparliamentary group 
of which it was not informed. 
  Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary under the 
Hosokawa cabinet, was also involved in the China Airlines plane 
case, telling reporters, "politics is in an unusual stage, but 
we want to deal with (the issue) without delay." 
  Under the Japanese Constitution, the departing cabinet has 
the responsibility to handle major day-to-day operations until 
the incoming administration is fully in place.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- New party Sakigake and 
Group Seiun have agreed to form a joint parliamentary front, the 
two parties said Thursday. Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura, 
who was the chief cabinet secretary in the government of former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, will head the new group. 
  Sakigake controls 15 members in the 511-seat House of 
Representatives, while Group Seiun consists of three lower house 
members who quit Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) in protest at 
his approach to the ruling coalition's core party Shinseito 
headed by new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  Political sources said more JNP members may leave the party 
and join the Sakigake-Seiun front.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] and the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) agreed on Wednesday to join forces with 
each other in the Diet to fulfill their duties as the two main 
opposition forces. The accord emerged at a meeting between SDP 
Diet affairs committee chairman Koken Nosaka and his LDP 
counterpart Sadatoshi Ozato. 
  Nosaka proposed that the SDP and the LDP hold such a 
gathering now that the SDP became an opposition force again 
after eight months in the ruling coalition, Ozato told a news 
conference. 
  While the LDP was in power for 38 years until last August, 
the SDP formed the core of the opposition camp. 
  The SDP decided on Tuesday to quit the governing alliance to 
protest other coalition partners' formation of a unified 
parliamentary group, named Kaishin (innovation). The party was 
the largest contingent in the coalition. 
  Nosaka and Ozato will meet again on Thursday morning to 
discuss how specifically the two parties can cooperate in 
handling political matters to be discussed in the current 
regular Diet session and beyond, Ozato said. Ozato added that 
the two men agreed to cooperate in order to resist "fascist" 
moves and protect parliamentary democracy. 
  The LDP Diet Affairs Committee chairman also noted the two 
parties may ask new party Sakigake, which had earlier decided to 
leave the coalition, to join their policy talks. 
  In a separate news conference, Nosaka said he and Ozato 
confirmed the need for "faith and trust" in their two parties' 
tie-up over Diet deliberations.

  [Text] Bangkok, April 28 KYODO -- The Cambodian border 
town of Poi Pet has been virtually cut off following a 
government order to close a major highway linking it to 
Sisophon, according to a report Thursday [28 April] from 
Aranyaprathet, a Thai border town nearby. 
  Government forces lost control of the highway Tuesday 
following heavy Khmer Rouge [KR] guerrilla attacks through the 
week, the report said. 
  Col. Surat Vorarak, an officer attached to Aranyaprathet's 
military unit, confirmed Khmer Rouge activity in the region, 
saying guerrillas have used "hit and run" tactics against 
government posts but would not be allowed to control those they 
have overrun. 
  Poi Pet is a busy border town through which consumer goods 
pass between Cambodia and Thailand. 
  The report said the price of goods in Poi Pet market has 
risen by several times and the supply of drinking water has 
reached a critical stage. 
  About 12,000 villagers and merchants remain in the town, 
some 
of them preparing to cross the border into Thailand, the report 
said.

  [Text] Debt-for-nature swap schemes may become the in 
thing for member-countries of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) as APEC environment ministers okayed a 
proposal which opens APEC countries to innovative approaches in 
mobilizing financial resources for the environment. 
  An official from the Department of Environment and Natural 
Resources (DENR) said the proposal is aimed at awakening the 
interest of APEC member-countries to debt-for-nature swap 
arrangement. 
  At present, only Mexico and the Philippines are taking part 
in the program among APEC member-countries. 
  Robert Jara, project coordinator of DENR foreign assisted 
special project director, told BUSINESS WORLD the 
debt-for-nature swap scheme remains one of the more creative 
financing mechanisms a Third World country can avail of in 
preserving its environment. 
  He disclosed that during the recently concluded meeting of 
APEC's environment ministers in Vancouver, Canada, the proposal 
was adopted as one of the "framework of principles" approved by 
the APEC body. 
  The principle specifically states that APEC member-economies 
should cooperate in exploring "innovative approaches to 
fund-raising schemes and mechanisms" in protecting the 
environment. 
  The debt-for-nature swap program, however recently came 
under 
attack from various sectors claiming the arrangement had become 
virtually impractical because of the rising cost of the 
Philippine debt papers. 
  The debt-for-nature swap arrangement is based on the 
principle that part of the foreign debt of severely indebted 
country is "canceled" by rechanneling it to a national currency 
fund directed to finance environment programs. 
  Specifically, the program involves the purchase and 
subsequent cancellation of part of a country's foreign debt in 
exchange for the funding of local conservation efforts and a 
government commitment to protect the environment. 
  Mr. Jara claimed the arrangement even has Finance Secretary 
Roberto F. de Ocampo's endorsement. 
  In a brief presented during the meeting of APEC's finance 
ministers last March, Mr. de Ocampo proposed debt-for-nature 
swap deals as one of the concerns which countries should adopt. 
  Based on the copy of the brief obtained by BUSINESS WORLD, 
Mr. de Ocampo praised debt-for-nature swap arrangement as a 
"win-win" scheme which can allow the Philippines to address both 
its debt and environment protection problems, specifically in 
relation to fund lack. 
  Mr. Jara admitted, however, that the program will not solve 
the country's debt problem as the amount of money involved is 
just too small to make a dent in the country's total foreign 
debt. On the other hand, he said it can help a long way in the 
country's conservation efforts. 
  The country's debt-for-nature swap program is currently 
supporting biodiversity projects in the El Nido Marine 
Reservation and St. Paul River Subterranean National Park, both 
in Palawan, and in Mt. Pulog in Northern Luzon. 
  The Foundation for Philippine Environment is overseeing the 
program in coordination with the Philippine Business for Social 
Progress. 
  Earlier, Environment Secretary Angel C. Alcala, who 
represented the country during the APEC environment ministerial 
meeting, explained the discussions mainly focused on integrating 
environment issues with the economy or industrialization. 
  It is an initial discussion on potential cooperation among 
APEC member economies in the area of environment and sustainable 
growth, he added. 
  The meeting was held last 23-25 March and was attended by 
150 
delegates, representing APEC's 18 member-countries. 
  APEC was formed in 1989 in response to increasing calls for 
closer economic cooperation among countries in the Asia-Pacific

  [Text] Washington, April 24 KYODO -- Japan will enact 
lasting income tax cuts by year's end, Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii told his counterparts from seven major industrial nations 
Sunday. 
  The demand for Tokyo to extend this year's 6 trillion yen in 
income and residential tax cuts, to spur domestic demand and 
reduce its trade surplus, came again at Sunday's meeting in 
Washington of the Group of Seven (G-7) finance ministers and 
central bank chiefs. 
  Fujii told a news conference that he responded by saying 
multi year tax cuts will be enacted this year, as promised by 
the coalition government of outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa. 
  Japanese officials have said Fujii carried a message that a 
new government to be launched Monday will carry on Hosokawa's 
reforms. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is certain to succeed 
Hosokawa as premier. 
  Fujii said the finance leaders of Britain, Canada, France, 
Germany, Italy and the United States also confirmed with him 
"the shared understanding that excessive changes in exchange 
rates are undesirable." 
  He said he stressed to the meeting "that exchange rates 
should reflect economic fundamentals and that excessive changes 
are undesirable, and all the countries confirmed this." He said 
they agreed on "close cooperation" on the exchange market. 
  Foreign exchange volatility is also undesirable for stock 
and 
bond markets, Fujii said. 
  Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno told the same news 
conference that he recognizes U.S. economic recovery as genuine 
and that other countries are steadily moving in a brighter 
economic direction.

  [Text] Washington, April 24 KYODO -- A reaffirmed accord 
by the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations on 
stabilizing exchange rates reflects Japan's concern over the 
adverse economic effects of currency volatility, Japanese 
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Sunday. 
  "I expressed my view that unstable rates will have 
undesirable effects on the stock and bond markets and cool off 
business sentiment to put a damper on the economy," Fujii told a 
press conference after a meeting of G-7 finance ministers and 
central bankers. 
  Fujii said the G-7 financial leaders reconfirmed their past 
accord to closely cooperate to realize stable currency rates 
reflecting economic fundamentals. "The stronger growth nations 
were referred to as the United States, Canada, and Britain, and 
the weaker nations as Japan and other G-7 nations." Fujii said. 
  Fujii said he described the state of Japan's economy as 
"still generally sluggish," but stressed that the February 15.25 
trillion yen economic package will help Japan attain a 
full-fledged recovery. 
  Fujii also said that he explained that the Japanese ruling 
coalition parties agreed to implement multi-year income tax cuts 
in a policy accord agreed last Friday on forming a new cabinet. 
  On the current account surplus, Fujii said, "the trend has 
clearly reversed," citing the change in the effects of external 
demand on Japan's economic growth. 
  External demand pushed down Japan's real gross domestic 
product (GDP) by 0.3 percentage point, while domestic demand 
boosted it by 0.4 point to attain a 0.1 percent growth in fiscal 
1993 that ended March 31, Fujii said.

  [Text] London, April 27 KYODO -- Japan led the 
industrialized world in piracy of business software in 1993, 
with 80 percent of programs in use believed to be illegal 
copies, a London-based computer software association said 
Wednesday [28 April]. Piracy in Japan cost the software 
publishing and distribution industries an estimated 1.9 billion 
dollars, according to the Business Software Alliance. 
  A survey of 54 nations conducted by the association of 15 
European and American software houses showed that the industry 
lost 12.8 billion dollars worldwide. 
  The piracy rate was lowest in the United States at 35 
percent, while the rate for Thailand, Indonesia and Russia stood 
at 98 to 99 percent, the association said. 
  Tougher government enforcement in Italy helped slash the 
rate 
of illegal software from 86 percent in 1992 to 50 percent in 
1993, the association said. It said the Italian Government 
stepped up police raids of companies following enactment of a 
new copyright law. 
  The business software alliance is devoted to eradicating 
software theft worldwide.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ichiro Ozawa by Takeshi Sasaki, Tokyo </F>
University professor; moderated by Shoichi Oikawa, YOMIURI 
SHIMBUN political bureau chief] 
  [Text] Demolishing the "Village Society" of Politics 
  [Oikawa] Now that the political reform bill has been passed, 
with that in mind, I'd like to hear your views on several broad 
topics, such as the sort of politics you would like to see in 
the future, and the problems that Japan faces. 
  First, I'd like to discuss Mr. Hosokawa's performance at the 
Japan-U.S. summit. For previous summits, the issues were worked 
out at the administrative level in advance, and then the heads 
of state would then formally agree on them. But this time the 
talks ended without an agreement because a dispute over specific 
quantitative targets. This was an unprecedented development. For 
the first time, Japan unequivocally said "no" to a U.S. demand. 
Since you have always attached a great deal of importance to 
Japan-U.S. relations, we would like to hear your evaluation of 
the recent talks. 
  [Ozawa] With the changing current of history, the end of the 
Cold War, and the necessity for a new world order, the 
Japan-U.S. relationship is bound to change. Therefore, given 
that Japan must now become more independent, we are in a much 
more difficult position than we were during the Cold War. Japan 
must transform itself from a baby safely ensconced in a cradle 
to a full-fledged adult with the ability to make decisions and 
to act independently and responsibly. 
  But I notice that some elements in the mass media suggest 
that saying "no" was a good thing. Perhaps the Japanese people 
also derive some satisfaction from that, but they should not. 
After all, a normal relationship involves saying "no" sometimes, 
and saying "yes" at other times. 
  What I'm concerned about is that our relationship of trust 
might crumble because of this, and that would be unfortunate. I 
have learned from experience that, since the United States is a 
nation that values principles, the Americans will understand if 
we tell them that their demands are illogical. They think that 
it is perfectly all right for us to say "no," or to express our 
opinions. They understand. But when we're asked, as a member of 
the international community, if we're doing our best to solve 
the domestic market and national security problems, and other 
problems, we can't respond with confidence that, "Yes, we are." 
That's the current state of affairs in Japan. 
  Shouldn't we establish a system that will allow us to answer 
"yes" to those questions? If the Americans get the impression 
that we're not doing enough, that we're saying "no" to avoid 
inconveniencing ourselves, and dodging our responsibilities, 
then the relationship of trust between Japan and the U.S. will 
be destroyed. 
  [Sasaki] Along those lines, the media seem to be insinuating 
that we should be pleased that Japan said "no," and also that 
we're being asked to shoulder an extremely heavy responsibility, 
without distinguishing between the two concepts. It is my belief 
that we have taken on an extremely heavy responsibility. The 
economic problems have remained unsolved for several years. 
These problems appear to be the same now as they were around the 
time of the "bubble." But the positions of both nations and the 
climate in both nations have been changing. What are your views 
on those trends? 
  [Ozawa] As far as politics is concerned, the coalition has 
been likened to stained glass or a mosaic, but I think it is 
much more flexible than Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
governments ever were, and that Hosokawa can now demonstrate 
quite a bit of leadership. Strange as it may seem, a coalition 
government is more effective than government by one powerful 
party. The people are unhappy with postwar politics or, rather, 
LDP politics, and they sense that its usefulness has ended. Once 
you sense that public sentiment is on your side, then it's time 
to make drastic changes in politics. I think that Hosokawa fully 
shares that sentiment, and that it is the driving force behind 
his efforts. The fact that he said "no" at the Japan-U.S. talks, 
and that he was the first one to do so, gives those talks an 
import beyond that of previous summits. 
  Also, as far as the economic situation is concerned, it is 
true for many reasons that there isn't much leeway now. But it 
was the business community that got carried away and created the 
bubble, and now it has to face the consequences. It would be 
inexcusable for corporations, which must accept the 
responsibility for what they have done, to attempt to get 
taxpayers to foot the bill. But that aside, we need to find a 
way to reactivate the economy by using more innovative methods 
and by allowing more freedom in economic activity, and in other 
areas as well. We cannot build the stable economic society that 
we will need in the future with our stifling, regulated, 
bureaucratic society. 
  Nor can we, when we make changes, let it seem as though we 
are making them because the United States is demanding that we 
open our markets. This is Japan's own problem. Of course, I'm 
not saying that we should emulate American society and have 
totally free competition. To maintain a certain amount of 
fairness, we need regulations to protect the weak. But there are 
far too many regulations. Neither individuals nor corporations 
understand independence, and it doesn't occur to anyone to take 
responsibility for his own actions. This is just an example, but 
the banks made loan after loan, creating the "bubble," and now 
they want their debts to be paid with the government's--the 
taxpayers'--money. How selfish can you get? Therefore, if we're 
going to have situations like this, how can we expect Japan to 
have a prosperous, stable economy in the next half-century, the 
21st century? Japan must voluntarily decide to reduce the number 
of regulations, and to allow more freedom in economic activity, 
and more individual freedom. Basically, that is the course we 
must choose. 
  [Oikawa] The United States has given particular emphasis to 
these problems, and has referred to Japan's bureaucracy as a 
"cancer." 
<H5>  Make Better Use of the Bureaucrats </H5>
  [Ozawa] You have to expect resistance when you try to change 
a system that has existed for a long time. But the real problem 
isn't a matter of the bureaucrats' resistance. I think it's 
wrong to say that their recalcitrance prevents us from making 
any changes. The problem is that the livelihoods of so many 
ordinary people depend on these regulations. 
  For instance, automobile inspection costs a lot of money. If 
we simply eliminated automobile inspection stations, aside from 
the safety issue, the people they employ would suffer. Or, if we 
simplified the distribution system, those who make a living from 
it would really be in trouble. Problems like that are much more 
serious than bureaucratic resistance. 
  During the Cold War, there was no need for either 
politicians 
or bureaucrats to make substantive political decisions. For all 
practical purposes, their work consisted solely of preparing 
budgets and making allocations as fairly as possible. For the 
most part, all they needed to do was to go along with decisions 
made by the United States. In that sense, what they were doing 
was not politics. The same could be said of the bureaucrats. 
They devoted all their time to elaborate regulations and 
subsidies. 
  So, when we propose deregulation, pure and simple, the 
bureaucrats object because their work would be taken away from 
them. Here we have a group of talented people who have studied 
hard to pass the government examinations. I think we can solve 
this problem by having the bureaucrats use their talents in 
other ways, such as to work on major political problems, and to 
determine Japan's future role in the international community. 
  [Sasaki] In the area of foreign policy, the details of 
discussions at the Japan-U.S. summit about the problem of 
nuclear weapons in North Korea have not been disclosed. However, 
is it reasonable to assume that a great deal of progress was 
made through the prime minister's recent visit to the United 
States? 
  [Ozawa] Yes. If we focus only on the comprehensive talks on 
economic problems, what everyone seems to be saying is that they 
didn't go well or, in contrast, that Japan finally said "no," 
which was a good thing. But I think the fact that at those 
talks, Japan and the U.S. came to an agreement about their basic 
positions on the North Korean problem, is of extreme importance. 
Wasn't that the first time that Japan's prime minister clearly 
stated his position on an issue like this one? 
  [Sasaki] I realize that you're thinking about how to change 
the ways policies and decisions are made, practices that arose 
under the 1955 system, and are still with us. However, I would 
very much like you to comment on the policymaking mechanism. 
Perhaps the recent political reform measures might be viewed as 
"input." The way in which the voters express their opinions 
about politics has changed to some degree. But what happens once 
they have expressed their opinions, and how do they benefit from 
that process? We still have no idea to what extent the problems 
of the Diet, first of all, and of the cabinet, the 
administration, and the administrative system will be resolved. 
In some ways, it seems that we still have the status quo. 
  First, I would like to ask you about how the Diet is run. 
There must be a difference between the way it has been run since 
the change of government and the way it was run during one-party 
rule. 
<H5>  Leave Diet Debates to the Politicians </H5>
  [Ozawa] Well, I really shouldn't criticize others, but 
politicians still cling to the 1955 system, to the postwar 
system mentality. Therefore, the LDP, which ran the government 
for a half-century, is a more unyielding opposition party than 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] ever was. On the 
other hand, the coalition parties, the ruling parties, which 
were formerly in the opposition, still haven't realized that 
they are now in a position of leadership. There are remnants of 
the postwar system on both sides. This situation will not change 
overnight, but I think politicians' thinking is changing very 
quickly. For that reason as well, I believe that the coalition 
was a good idea. 
  If we were still working under the 1955 system, then we 
couldn't have resolved any of the problems we have, such as the 
Uruguay Round, political reform, or the recent tax cuts. Even if 
the LDP had had an absolute majority, it still couldn't have 
done these things. We've been witnessing great changes, 
substantial ones, and there will be more to come. 
  There is a lot of talk about a dual power structure, but the 
reason for that, in my personal opinion, is the divide between 
the ruling party and the administration. Traditionally, the 
bureaucrats have written all the scenarios and all the scripts. 
Officially, at least, we had the LDP's policymaking organization 
on one side, and the administration on the other. It was hard to 
tell which was which but somehow, the system worked. Since the 
ruling party normally supplies the heads of all government 
ministries and agencies, who are almost always ruling party 
politicians, the ruling party should take responsibility for 
both politics and administration. 
  In the Diet, monitoring should be done by the opposition. 
The 
ruling party has an administrative staff in possession of a 
wealth of information and reference materials, so it is the 
opposition that should check up on the government. The Diet 
should make better use of that monitoring function. 
  If the ruling coalition approved, the administrative staff 
could be abolished. But I really think that politicians should 
be the ones to conduct Diet debates. If they did, the Diet would 
be reborn in the voters' eyes and, most important of all, if 
politicians devoted more of their time to study and to improving 
their knowledge, the bureaucrats would certainly become more 
malleable. Politicians are looked down on because they talk 
nonsense. 
  Therefore, political parties could assume some of the burden 
of election-related activities, thus saving 20 or 30 percent of 
the energy politicians expend on them. I would like to see 
politicians doing more independent study, at least when they are 
in Tokyo. Then, they would be able to engage in debates with the 
bureaucrats; and debates between the ruling party and the 
opposition could be held in the Diet. 
  [Oikawa] Could you say specifically when and how you plan to 
make these things happen? 
  [Ozawa] I sincerely hope that we can get started at the next 
Diet session. 
<H5>  Diet Debates: Opposition Versus Bureaucrats </H5>
  [Sasaki] It does seem that debates between political parties 
are actually taking place in the Diet, but I get the impression 
that the debates are between the bureaucrats and the opposition. 
Japan's Diet debates involve a tremendous amount of detail, 
don't they. 
  [Ozawa] And all they talk about are trivial matters. 
  [Sasaki] The administration is the focus in these 
question-and-answer sessions. 
  [Ozawa] Normally, the opposition is supposed to monitor the 
ruling party. But the traditional mindset of the Japanese people 
lumps the ruling and opposition party in the same category, and 
views the bureaucrats as the real authorities. That is why both 
the opposition and ruling parties want to hear what the 
bureaucrats have to say. I'm saying that this sort of mentality 
is unacceptable. I don't object to the bureaucrats' having the 
bulk of authority. But the idea behind politics is that the 
politicians chosen by the people should have the ultimate 
responsibility. If everyone is content with listening to the 
bureaucrats' explanations, then what we have is not politics. 
Therefore, I am anxious to shift to a system within which the 
politicians and the political parties chosen by the voters 
accept responsibility. 
  [Sasaki] In other words, we have the bureaucracy, and the 
political parties form another group. Conflict between the 
ruling party and the opposition seems to be extremely fragmented 
and peripheral. That's what you'd like to change. 
  [Ozawa] Yes. The bureaucrats constitute a large government, 
and the political parties and politicians remind me of a noisy, 
argumentative, disorderly mob. It's ridiculous for the ruling 
party to be submitting questions to the bureaucrats. It's the 
ruling party's government, after all. 
  [Sasaki] There is a great deal of public interest in 
decentralization. Exactly where will this issue be debated? No 
matter what the central government does, we're never going to 
see decentralization if someone doesn't get the local 
authorities moving. 
<H5>  Clinging to a Regulated Society </H5>
  [Ozawa] The Japanese say that they want deregulation, but I 
doubt that most of them really do. Life is easier in a regulated 
society. Local governments feel the same way. They complain 
about the inconvenience of petitioning, but they would be scared 
to death if we said, "Here's the authority, here's the money. 
Now you handle everything." This fear permeates all of Japanese 
society. People talk about decentralization, and it's true that 
the central bureaucracy doesn't want to give up any of its 
authority, but local governments don't really want 
decentralization. 
  In that sense, a deregulated, independent society would 
present difficulties for everyone. The business world complains 
about the annoyances and inconveniences of bureaucratic control. 
Its members complain to us, too. But when they come upon hard 
times, they run to the authorities, begging to be bailed out. If 
they declared that they didn't need the help of the bureaucracy, 
then nobody would argue with them. But as soon as they have a 
problem, they rush to the bureaucrats. That's why the 
bureaucrats shout at them. This mentality prevails in the 
business world, and that includes its top-ranking members as 
well. 
  So, if politicians and bureaucrats were able to concentrate 
on more important assignments, many of the details could be 
entrusted to local government. 
  [Oikawa] These ideas have been discussed in various settings 
for some time, but nothing seems to come of them. Even the 
reports issued by the Council for Administrative Reform have 
been limited to topics that the bureaucracy finds acceptable. 
  [Ozawa] Without question, making reforms in the manner which 
I have suggested will be extremely difficult as long as things 
are running smoothly. For instance, no one is going to think 
seriously about the tax burden for welfare as long as things are 
going well. Recently, when we were addressing the problem of a 
Citizens' Welfare Tax, we were asked, "Why this, all of a 
sudden?" But our society is aging rapidly. If we told people 
that Japan's economy is in serious trouble, then they would 
start thinking seriously about this problem. If you ask people 
to think calmly about the problem of the tax burden, you will 
find that more than 50 percent agree with us. 
  Both politicians and administrators were bewildered by the 
sudden outbreak of the Gulf war. But in the future, our 
politicians will face an increasing number of problems that 
require them to make decisions. When those problems arise, they 
will have to be considered seriously. Then, I think politicians 
and bureaucrats will be forced to change. And for that change to 
take place as smoothly as possible, politicians must become 
aware of the necessity to change. You can write out a schedule 
and convince yourself that it will work, but, I assure you, it 
won't. At least, that's what I think. 
  [Oikawa] The Hosokawa cabinet came into power with political 
reform as its main mission. A political reform bill was finally 
passed, The Uruguay Round was brought to a successful 
conclusion. Now the cabinet is attempting to overhaul the tax 
system, and it looks as though that problem will be resolved, 
too. There are many policy problems that need to be addressed. 
Which do you think should be given priority? 
<H5>  Responsiveness to International Situations </H5>
  [Ozawa] There are domestic problems that need attention. But 
basically, since the international community is in a tumultuous 
state of transition, the first thing we should do is to 
establish a system that can respond to these changes. In a 
sense, that too is political reform. The electoral system reform 
bill, which should be concluded soon, may provide an impetus. 
Once that has been done, we should act quickly to reform 
politics. That means setting up a system within which politics 
gives rise to responsible decisions, which are then implemented. 
In order to accomplish that we need to form at least two groups 
capable of governing the nation. I wouldn't even mind if there 
were three of them. An international crisis may arise that 
ignites domestic problems. The sooner we create such a system, 
the greater the likelihood of our being able to respond to such 
crises with agility. That is our most pressing task. 
  How will we do it? What should our priorities be, and how 
will we decide? Those questions can be answered by whoever is 
running the government at the time. If the voters cannot accept 
what that government does, they can vote in people who support 
their views. That's how democracy is supposed to work. With 
Japanese-style democracy, no decisions get made, but we cannot 
go on this way. 
  [Oikawa] In other words, the first priority is to establish 
a 
political system within which decisions get made. 
  [Ozawa] Yes, and I cannot emphasize this enough. Other 
problems can be dealt with individually, through discussion. 
  [Oikawa] I would like to move on to political 
reorganization. 
I am convinced that the implementation of the new electoral 
system will trigger another political reorganization. The 
possibilities are numerous. Could you tell us your thoughts 
about that? Also, I've heard that Hosokawa may make a move, 
perhaps even during the current Diet session. Could you discuss 
that as well? 
<H5>  Political Reorganization Will Happen Quickly </H5>
  [Ozawa] I am in general agreement with Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's perspective on this subject. We now have 300 small 
electoral districts. This plan was previously proposed by the 
government. Everyone has gotten used to that scheme, so when the 
Diet passes it, everyone's thoughts will focus on the new 
district system. Every politician will be thinking about 
strategy -- what district he should run from, and how he can 
win. Therefore, I think political reorganization will proceed 
more quickly than the media has predicted. 
  [Oikawa] Your comment about political reorganization 
proceeding more quickly than the media predicted is very 
interesting, but I would like you to say a little more about the 
process. 
  [Ozawa] At this point, I have no idea about what the process 
will be. I am surprised that the situation is moving forward 
much faster than I thought it would. 
  However, if you're asking about the main factor involved in 
political reorganization, it will certainly be the elections, 
since elections are the arena where every politician must fight 
his battles. There's no other way to put it. At the same time, 
what will be completely different from old-style politics is 
that Japan must assume more independence to keep abreast of the 
tumultuous changes in the international situation. We must 
decide for ourselves what to do and what not to do. The 
difference in opinions on this subject may be another factor. 
When there are people in the same party who are at opposite 
poles on an issue, it will be very difficult for that group to 
remain intact. 
  Traditionally, the LDP has included people with a wide range 
of views, from leftists to rightists. One might characterize the 
coalition in the same way, but the point I am trying to make is 
that the current configuration, with the coalition on one side 
and the LDP on the other, is by no means the final one. I have a 
feeling that there will be more upheaval. 
  [Oikawa] So, you're saying that the end result is not going 
to be the current LDP versus non-LDP configuration, and even if 
that remains the key configuration, some will leave the non-LDP 
side, and some LDP members may join it.... 
  [Ozawa] Probably. The media has an easy time of it--to them, 
everything is LDP or non-LDP, black or white, yes or no, but 
that's not what's really happening. I think there will be new 
determining factors, factors that play a much more important 
role than the traditional ones in establishing the new order. 
  [Oikawa] The LDP versus non-LDP concept is a leftover from 
the 1955 system, isn't it. 
  [Ozawa] Yes, that's right. 
  [Sasaki] Another subject that looms large in the mind of the 
public is our living standard and, in particular, economic 
problems. The 1955 system has been linked with one type of 
economic structure or system. Deregulation will certainly be a 
factor, but in a more general sense, changing Japan's economic 
structure will lead to a conflict between those who favor the 
status quo and those who want politicians to show leadership by 
making major changes. How much will that conflict affect 
political reorganization? 
<H5>  Developing New Industries </H5>
  [Ozawa] To put it simply, I think that the business world 
and 
politicians who specialize in economic policy will divide into 
two opposing camps--those who wish to retain the system we have 
now, and those who want to change it. Positions will be 
determined by opinions, and there will be a conflict between 
those who want to respond to the changing times and those whose 
view is, well, more historical. 
  During the postwar years, Japan resurrected its economy and 
succeeded in achieving significant economic growth, but the 
limits of that process have been reached. From now on, it will 
be difficult to achieve economic prosperity through quantitative 
expansion. Therefore, unless we generate a technological 
revolution and use the intelligence and expertise of the 
Japanese people to produce high-value-added products, Japan will 
not be able to survive. 
  But corporations, lacking foresight, invested huge amounts 
of 
money in facilities and are now struggling to survive. Their 
facilities are capable of producing twice the current demand. 
They are carrying 10 percent more employees than they need. They 
are at a loss as to how to solve these problems. They can 
abandon their facilities, but not their employees. So, we have 
to find an economic structure, a standard of living, that will 
allow a mature society to survive without the quantitative 
expansion that has been taking place. 
  Since, as I mentioned earlier, industry is saddled with a 
10-percent personnel surplus, it must develop new industries and 
technologies. The government should become actively involved in 
this problem. Corporations must, of course, also restructure. 
  "Experts" on economics make irresponsible pronouncements 
like, "Japan leads the world in high technology," but that's not 
true at all. Japan leads the world only in applied technology. 
Very little basic research is being done here. We are far behind 
the United States. We must change our way of thinking and create 
a system which allows Japan to take its rightful place in the 
world by using our own inventiveness to create high-value-added 
products, and by undergoing a continual technological 
revolution. The government must support these endeavors. 
  Furthermore, if economic growth remains at a low level even 
after corporate restructuring, the economy will, for a time, 
cease to function smoothly. Then, the government will have to 
tackle structural problems by, for instance, providing housing 
in major metropolitan areas, and social capital in other 
regions. It's not just hammers we need--Japan's investments in 
information, culture, education (whole areas like those) are 
lagging far behind other nations. So, while we establish a 
stable society, the government needs to increase its investment 
in these areas in order to create overall demand. By doing so, 
Japan will increase its assets to the level enjoyed by Europe 
and the United States. During this period, it will probably have 
to borrow money by issuing government construction bonds. We 
should get started on this project with a clear vision in mind. 
  While the government is working on these two projects, it 
will also have to address three other major issues: how to 
manage a welfare state on its way to becoming an aging society, 
how to select the appropriate welfare system to adopt, and how 
to determine the taxpayers' burden. 
  [Sasaki] Which segments of society will help you lay the 
foundations when the time comes? Which ones will support these 
ideas? 
<H5>  Freedom With Fairness </H5>
  [Ozawa] With the establishment of the present government, 
the 
traditional Japanese voting patterns have ceased to exist. 
Previously, labor unions supported the opposition, and 
non-unionists the ruling party. Urban residents supported the 
opposition, and agricultural and rural districts the ruling 
party. I think that from now on our citizens will vote for 
politicians who share their views on issues that affect them 
directly. Some will want our regulated society to stay the way 
it is, and others will want more freedom. These will probably be 
the major trends. 
  Our regulated society was designed with fairness and balance 
in mind. For instance, currently we have the problem of general 
contractors and their methods for bidding on construction 
projects. Why did Japan adopt a designated bidding system? 
Because if we hadn't, the big corporations would underbid 
midsized and small companies, and the latter would be ruined. 
The United States has had free competition ever since its 
founding. There, the winners survive. That's how it's always 
been. This is a political philosophy. Americans claim that 
Japanese society is totally controlled by regulations and by 
bid-rigging. 
  I'm not suggesting that we should have total freedom like 
the 
Americans. We have to maintain fairness. But we must have a 
little more freedom in the areas where we compete 
internationally. That will, in a way, lead to the opening of our 
markets. The point I wish to make is that we should allow open 
competition in areas that warrant our doing so, without 
violating the principle of fairness. If there is more freedom, 
we will see more innovation. If we don't do that, we won't be 
able to compete. The Japanese must first get used to that idea 
and then give it serious consideration. I also think that we 
should deregulate as long as we are not compromising fairness 
and equality, and by that I mean we should encourage people to 
act independently and responsibly. 
  [Sasaki] May we assume then, that, in other words, when 
political groups are formed, a sort of social reform could be 
considered a unifying factor? 
  [Ozawa] Yes. The same idea applies to national security and 
international relations. Freedom means independence. When we're 
given freedom, that means that we have to act responsibly. So, 
we must become independent as a nation, and as individuals and 
corporations, too. We have to allow a little more autonomy. The 
difference between this philosophy and the one that maintains 
that we can manage quite well with the present system will 
influence political alignment. 
  [Oikawa] Specifically, how will these ideas influence the 
politics of the future? If the 1955 system is to be dismantled, 
and more freedom is allowed, as you just described, how will 
that affect the reorganization of political parties? 
  [Ozawa] Both the LDP and the opposition have become 
complacent in our regulated society. The more regulated a 
society is, the more susceptible it is to structural corruption 
and collusion. It is better not to have regulations. The 
disadvantage of regulations, which are devices used to ensure 
fairness and equality, is that they become entangled with power, 
and can easily be a breeding ground for collusion and 
corruption. These problems can be corrected. Contemplating a 
more serious problem, what to do about Japan's future, might 
open people's eyes to the regulation problem; and this is a 
problem of political reform. 
  [Oikawa] So, you're saying that opinions on Japan's national 
goals and its role in the international community will diverge, 
and that the view that Japan should become self-sufficient 
within a new, constantly changing, international situation, will 
have advocates and opponents, and both will influence political 
reorganization? 
  [Ozawa] Yes. Future reorganization will be based on policy 
considerations like these. What kind of policies do we want? 
What kind of nation do we want? What kind of politics do we 
want? What sort of international contribution should we make? 
Differences in views on these subjects will play a much more 
important role in reorganization than they have in the past. 
  [Oikawa] I understand that you favor a basic security law 
which would include provisions for Japan's international 
contribution. Would you like to mention specific suggestions for 
such a law? 
<H5>  The Need for a Basic Security Law </H5>
  [Ozawa] Even if two groups with differing philosophies are 
formed, we need to have total agreement between them, arrived at 
after thorough discussion between the two about international 
relations, especially national security. When our Constitution 
was drafted, the need to include these subjects was not 
anticipated. Therefore, we must declare Japan's desire to be a 
peaceful nation and to support and abide by UN policies, by 
drafting a basic security law, in order to make these things 
absolutely clear to all our citizens. There will have to be 
agreement between political parties on these issues, since they 
are of vital importance. We cannot be in conflict over these 
matters. 
  [Oikawa] With the establishment of a new electoral system, 
questions have arisen about how elections are to be conducted, 
such as whether two or more parties can join in supporting one 
candidate, or whether a candidate can be backed by only one 
party. 
<H5>  No More Multiparty Backing </H5>
  [Ozawa] Apparently quite a few politicians and Diet members 
don't understand the new election law. The public doesn't 
understand it either. With the revision of the election law, 
political parties will designate candidates, both in the small 
electoral and proportional representation districts. Therefore, 
multiparty backing or cooperation, the idea of the "recognized 
group," will cease to exist, although some people don't seem to 
be aware of that fact. Candidates must be supported by one 
party. Candidates supported by Shinseito or the SDPJ will remain 
Shinseito or SDPJ candidates, and that's that. Of course, 
unaffiliated candidates may run for office. 
  If, under the new system, we were to obtain the support of, 
for instance, the SDPJ, the DSP [Democratic Socialist Party], 
Komeito, and Rengo, then that would give us an advantage. We 
would win. But even if members of the SDPJ, Komeito, and the DSP 
ran under that sort of banner, that is, even if they had 
multiparty support, they couldn't win one-to-one against the 
LDP. At least, that's what I think. Therefore, we have to fight 
the election battle as one political party, and not depend on 
cooperation or multiparty backing. I don't mind if Shinseito, 
Komeito, and SDPJ continue to exist as separate parties, and I'm 
not saying that it is a bad idea. But if we don't change our 
ways in the next election and put all our efforts into the 
election as one party, then we're not going to be able to win. 
On the contrary, if we do manage to accomplish this and do a 
good job of it, I think that it will be very easy for us to 
obtain the approval of the voters. 
  [Sasaki] I, too, think that ultimately what we need is a 
changing of the guard. When new people enter the world of 
politics, the approach to politics and the decisionmaking 
process will change. Could you tell us about your views on 
candidacy? 
  [Ozawa] This is an idea I got from Great Britain. I would 
like politicians to seek public subscription. I'm a 
second-generation politician, and I've heard a lot of criticism 
about politicians' backgrounds. Second-generation politicians 
and former bureaucrats seem to be special targets for criticism. 
If politicians take a test and pass it, then that sort of 
criticism will disappear. If it is acceptable to everyone, I'd 
like to have a system where, when a new group is formed, it 
seeks public subscription and can survive by doing that. When 
that happens, politicians currently in office will beg to be 
exempted from the examination. It would be terrible if they all 
failed (laughter). 
  [Oikawa] Currently, the members of the ruling coalition, the 
SDPJ, Shinseito, Komeito, Japan New Party, DSP, and Sakigake 
have significantly different views on the direction this nation 
should take. Various rumors have been spread, among them that 
the Shinseito and Komeito have formed a bloc, that the Japan New 
Party probably won't join it, and that Sakigake might not, 
either. 
  [Ozawa] I don't see any need to think about which party is 
good and which isn't, or which politicians are good and which 
aren't. For instance, I'm satisfied with Hosokawa as the 
captain, even if a new group is formed. I have no idea how 
others feel, but what is wrong with his supporters forming a 
group? 
  There are basic philosophical differences within the 
coalition, but those exist within the LDP as well. I think that 
if a new group is formed within the coalition, no matter which 
party it turns out to be, that the coalition can be run without 
serious dissension. 
  [Sasaki] You have been active for a long time in postwar 
politics. What praise or criticism do you have for that era, and 
what do you think your role has been as a participant in postwar 
politics? 
<H5>  Conservatism Means Changing With the Times </H5>
  [Ozawa] The basic philosophy of postwar politics is often 
referred to as the "Yoshida Doctrine." But my interpretation of 
that doctrine is different from that of most LDP members, 
particularly those who preceded me. I view the Yoshida Doctrine 
as a plan that was established to ensure Japan's survival as a 
nation after its defeat. Therefore, I think that the idea that 
the Yoshida Doctrine should be followed through all eternity, 
and that it should remain the governing philosophy of the LDP or 
of conservative politics, is wrong. 
  Given the choices we had at that time and later, during the 
Cold War, the Yoshida Doctrine was the appropriate policy for 
Japan's revival and future growth. Today, when major changes are 
occurring, those who believe that the Yoshida Doctrine should be 
followed to the letter, and the changing situation should be 
ignored, are not really conservative politicians. 
  Conservatism does not mean preserving longstanding abuses. 
It 
is even stated in the Five-Point Imperial Covenant that the 
principles of true conservatism are responding to the changes 
that occur over time, making needed reforms for the benefit of 
the people, and doing away with the abuses of the past. 
  Don't misunderstand me when I use the word "conservative." 
The word took on another connotation during the postwar era, 
when we had conservatives versus reformists. I'm talking about 
the true meaning of conservatism, in a broad sense. The time has 
come for us to change politics. 
  During the past 40-odd years, the old way of thinking served 
its purpose. Politicians emerged in response to the needs of 
that era and, as I said before, there was no need for them to 
concern themselves with international politics or extraneous 
matters. They needed to concentrate only on economic recovery, 
and were able to rely on the United States in all matters 
concerning national security. They endeavored to distribute the 
nation's wealth equitably. Politicians who were able to 
accomplish such goals came onto the scene. That was good enough. 
So, it is not their performance that is at issue. 
  But if the question is, "Can we go on this way?" then I'd 
have to say no. The old system just won't work any more. The 
Japanese have a special talent for working out a consensus -- 
the best possible solution for the majority. Wealth should be 
fairly distributed. The idea behind democracy is for those with 
divergent interests to reach a consensus, and we still need that 
aspect of democracy. But we must turn our thoughts to the living 
standard of our citizens, our economic activity, and the 
survival of our nation. It is those issues that politicians must 
address. We have entered an age in which politicians need a 
great deal of foresight. 
  [Sasaki] Is Prime Minister Hosokawa's position on these 
issues very close to yours? 
  [Ozawa] Yes, in that is he an advocate of responsible 
reform. 
I, too, have called for responsible reform, and worked to 
achieve it. Hosokawa has a good grasp of the times and of the 
tasks that he must accomplish. 
  [Sasaki] In Hosokawa's writings, I sense his strong 
commitment to his political activities. Perhaps, one might call 
that leadership. Are leadership and responsibility the most 
important requisites for a leader? 
<H5>  The Need for Leadership </H5>
  [Ozawa] I've said many times that Japan's politicians have 
managed quite well in the past without making any decisions. But 
from now on, there will be an increasing need for Japan to make 
responsible, independent decisions. Therefore, we will need 
prime ministers and other high-ranking officials who can 
demonstrate leadership and accept responsibility for their words 
and actions. 
  When I speak about my philosophy on this subject, the media 
and others accuse me of wanting to create a powerful nation, but 
they are completely wrong. That's the sort of argument you hear 
from people who haven't divested themselves of Japan's "village 
society" mentality. 
  What are we going to do if our prime minister doesn't make 
any decisions, doesn't say anything? Japanese society will be 
ruined. The prime minister must make responsible decisions 
independently and implement them. If he makes a mistake or if he 
loses voter support, then he'll just have to resign. The person 
who replaces him will do what he thinks is best. That is what 
democracy is about. It is not about simply accepting the 
position and making no decisions whatsoever, which is what the 
arguments of those who object to this way of thinking imply. 
  [Oikawa] Another thing, is there a possibility of a tie-up 
between the ruling coalition and part of the LDP? 
<H5>  No Tie-Up With the LDP </H5>
  [Ozawa] The philosophy behind the reforms we've been working 
for, in other words, the reform of postwar politics, 
parliamentary politics, is based on creating a system within 
which two or more groups capable of assuming the government vie 
for power, which alternates between them. Such a system would 
bring an atmosphere of tension to politics, and would bring 
about democracy in the true sense of the word. In parliamentary 
politics, it is natural for the ruling party and the opposition 
to talk to each other, and I have no objection to that. But that 
is not what I'm talking about. Parties should be formed for 
political reasons. This tie-up could not possibly happen. Why 
did we go to the trouble to form another key group? Our efforts 
would become meaningless. If that's what we had wanted, we could 
have stayed in the LDP. 
  Therefore, I think it's fine to cooperate with the LDP and 
to 
hold discussions with its members, and I think we should do 
that. But they will remain our rivals. We should compete with 
the LDP for control of the government, but I cannot envision a 
political tie-up or coalition with the LDP. In terms of the 
cabinet it would be a coalition, I guess. 
  [Oikawa] In the March issue of THIS IS YOMIURI, we carried a 
discussion between Michio Watanabe and Jun Eto. A 
save-the-nation coalition cabinet which would include Watanabe 
was proposed. What is your impression of Watanabe? 
  [Ozawa] I think that Watanabe has a good grasp of the trends 
within the mainstream of the LDP. His views on the electoral 
system differ slightly from mine. But I find myself in agreement 
with his views on dealing with the international community, 
Japan's future direction, and his belief that the taxpayers 
should bear an appropriate share of the burden for supporting 
our aging society. 
  [Oikawa] In conclusion, I'd like to hear your analysis of 
your own career. Earlier, you emphasized the qualities that a 
leader should possess: leadership and responsibility. Do you 
envision yourself in a position of leadership, in the cabinet, 
that is? 
  The reason I ask this question is that, in Tanaka and 
Takeshita-style politics, the person who controlled the largest 
faction didn't become prime minister. He would exert his 
influence by supporting suitable faction members. That's the way 
LDP politics was run at the end of the party's reign. Now that 
you are secretary general of Shinseito, an extremely influential 
position, some people interpret that as a dual power structure. 
Would you comment on that? 
[Ozawa] Whoever heads the administration must demonstrate 
leadership. At the same time, such leadership can be exercised 
to advantage only after the public recognizes it. Therefore, 
Hosokawa is an appropriate leader for these times. I don't think 
that I am suited for such a position and have no ambitions in 
that direction. 
  But since you mentioned Tanaka and Takeshita, let me say 
that 
my present position differs from theirs. I'm not hiding behind 
the scenes, I'm the secretary general [daihyo kanji] of 
Shinseito. That corresponds to the secretary general [kanji-cho] 
of the LDP. Since I have been asked to take care of the party's 
personnel matters, I intend to do just that as long as I'm 
wearing this badge, no matter what. 
  For instance, Tanaka wasn't personally involved in party 
personnel matters, nor was Takeshita. Since I officially hold a 
position of responsibility in this organization, I find this 
comparison strange. 
  [Oikawa] You've been described as aggressive, and even as a 
fascist by one group in the LDP. What is your response to such 
comments? 
  [Ozawa] I make a habit of saying and doing what I think is 
right but, in Japan's village society, no one speaks out. No one 
in a prominent position speaks or acts responsibly. Through the 
years, everyone has sought consensus and safety in numbers. In 
that light, what I say and do is unusual. I do not enjoy being 
the target of criticism, but if the Japanese and Japanese 
society don't change, we won't be able to survive in this new 
era. Since the voters have elected me, I owe it to them to speak 
responsibly, as must anyone in my position, secretary general. 
  Let me use a figure of speech, or an example, to illustrate 
what I mean. Minobe [former governor of Tokyo Prefecture] once 
said, "If even one person is opposed, I can't decide anything." 
This is the same thing we hear all the time--from the LDP, from 
everybody. How in the world are we going to make any progress? 
There are 120 million people in this country. What is going to 
happen if we say that we won't do anything if even one person is 
against it? Anyone in a position of responsibility must make 
decisions. I encourage exchanges of opinions, of course. It is 
impossible to avoid decisions simply because there is 
opposition. If I'm accused of going against the traditions of 
Japan's village society, then I can't deny that, nor can I 
behave otherwise. The voters will be my judges. 
  [Oikawa] Thank you for giving us so much of your time.

<F P=106> [Commentary by freelance commentator Takashi Tachibana] </F>
  [Text] To put it bluntly, what the Hata government has done 
to the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is a surprise 
attack. If it had happened before the election of the prime 
minister [in the Diet], the SDPJ would not have voted for Mr. 
Tsutomu Hata, and consequently, the Hata cabinet could not have 
been formed. The exclusion of the SDPJ from the coalition 
immediately following the election is nothing else than a breach 
of political faith. It thus is natural for the SDPJ to have 
left the coalition. 
  When Mr. Hata was elected prime minister, the mass media 
gave 
prominent coverage to Mr. Hata's political career and character, 
regarding him as "faithful," "honest," "a common man," and 
"earnest." But judging from what Mr. Hata has done to the SDPJ, 
I cannot say that he is an upstanding figure. I wonder whether 
he is defending himself in saying that everything was plotted by 
Mr. (Ichiro) Ozawa, who controls the Hata government from behind 
the scenes. 
  When asked about the existence of the "dual-power" structure 
involving Mr. Ozawa, Mr. Hata said "even an actor has the right 
to choose a scenario," thus admitting that he is no more than an 
actor. However, even if the recent move was plotted by Mr. 
Ozawa, Mr. Hata has to take responsibility for choosing Mr. 
Ozawa's plan. 
  I wonder how far Mr. Hata will play his role in a political 
drama scripted by Mr. Ozawa. It seems that Mr. Ozawa's plan for 
realigning the political parties is increasingly gaining 
momentum with the ultimate goal of materializing his plan to 
rebuild Japan by forming the Imperial Rule Assistance 
Association after breaking up all the existing political parties. 
  If Mr. Hata, in taking part in such a plan to forcibly 
realign the political world, which breaks faith with the SDPJ, 
intends to carry out Mr. Ozawa's plan to rebuild Japan, he 
should stop considering himself a "common man" and should 
instead call himself "crafty" or "a person who always follows a 
high-handed person [Ozawa]." 
  Now that the SDPJ has decided to secede from the coalition, 
it is unavoidable that the Hata cabinet will be short-lived. 
But there is the possibility that Mr. Hata will try to prolong 
the life of his cabinet by undermining the solidarity of the 
SDPJ and the Liberal Democratic Party. However, this may lead 
to further political turmoil, and we do not want see that. What 
the people want to see is the immediate dissolution of the Diet 
and a general election. 
  Japan's politics is faced with a historic turning point, but 
what Japanese politicians are doing is instead only political 
warfare, and in such a situation, wherein the people's wishes 
are not being reflected, the wheel of history is about to turn. 
We should avoid this. What we expect from the new government 
is the dissolution of the Diet and a general election to hear 
the judgment of the people.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Shinseito-Komeito Cabinet Distancing Itself </F>
From Reform"; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 29 April Morning Edition] 
  [Text] The Hata government has finally set sail. The 
political chaos wrought over a government to succeed Hosokawa 
will now come to an end, but the Hata government is a minority 
party government since the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] seceded from the coalition, which means the government's 
base is weak. There is already talk it will be a "short-lived 
government." Once the 1994 budget is passed, the political scene 
will most likely change, and the House of Representatives will 
be dissolved for a general election. 
  As regards major policy matters, it would be absurd to have 
many expectations of the Hata government which became a minority 
government with the departure of the SDPJ. Most political 
parties including the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] are showing 
a positive attitude on deliberating and passing the budget, but, 
as for the situation after that, there is no telling what will 
happen. There will be major turbulence on the political scene. 
  The Hata government, which has started with a different 
coalition framework, is made up of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] members in its axis plus Komeito members and defectors 
from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. It looks almost like 
"the former Tanaka faction plus Komeito." 
  As far as political reform is concerned, all that happened 
was the change of the election system to single-seat election 
districts; the major problems of preventing political corruption 
and tearing down the collusion of politicians, bureaucrats, and 
businessmen has not been dealt with at all. Moreover, looking 
at the faces of the Hata cabinet, we can see there is a major 
change from the Hosokawa government which had reform as its 
banner. Indeed, the new cabinet is one which is far from a 
reform government. The fact it no longer has a minister in 
charge of political reform symbolizes this well. 
  Various polls show that what the public wants most of Prime 
Minister Hata is to eradicate the dual power structure created 
by the remote control of Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro 
Ozawa behind the scenes. The exercise of absolute influence on 
government operations by an individual from behind the curtains 
makes the whereabouts of political responsibilities ambiguous, 
and entails the risk of government power being abused. From the 
fact that assigning of posts in the Hata cabinet leaned 
favorably toward Shinseito and Komeito, we can say that the 
so-called Ozawa-Ichikawa (the latter being general secretary of 
Komeito) duo has gained more power. 
  Defectors from the LDP were also picked in the cabinet. 
Their selection is believed to be window-dressing aimed at 
further inciting rifts within the LDP and at agitating the SDPJ. 
The late Kakuei Tanaka who was called the shadow general [yami 
shogun] put efforts into building the Tanaka faction to gain the 
power of influence over political circles. To do so, he picked 
people from other factions as members of his cabinet, thus 
publicizing the merits of joining the Tanaka faction. The 
recent cabinet appointments smell strongly of a Kakuei-style 
political scheme. One face of the new government can be said to 
have been revealed by this. 
  A feature of the Hata government without the SDPJ is that 
this is not just simply a coalition government of minority 
parties, but a minority coalition government which was formed 
without the participation of the largest party (LDP) and the 
second-largest party (SDPJ). It is a group of splinter parties 
of third and lesser ranking parties, plus groups of those who 
defected from the LDP without waiting for the public to pass 
judgment on them through elections. The government may be legal 
in that the prime minister received Diet approval, but there is 
a question as to whether it is a politically legitimate 
government with power entrusted to it by the majority of the 
people. 
  Many people who had expectations of the new government which 
replaced the LDP and who had been so pleased with the advent of 
the Hosokawa government could be embarrassed and disappointed by 
this big change in the basic nature of the coalition government. 
The political situation now is one which necessitates the 
dissolution of the House of Representatives for a new general 
election once the budget is passed.

  [Text] In a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN interview on 28 April, 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama of the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] showed a positive attitude toward formation of a 
joint floor group with Sakigake [Harbinger] and some other 
groups. He noted the SDPJ will formally seek formation of the 
SDPJ-Sakigake floor group at the lower house after Golden Week 
recess in May, opening party head and executive talks on a 
regular basis. He said: "We would like to open formal talks 
with Sakigake after the recess in May." 
  In the interview, Murayama stressed the need for the joint 
floor group with the Sakigake, saying: "We should build closer 
relations with Sakigake." On top of that, he hinted at his 
positive attitude toward a tie-up with certain quarters in the 
Japan New Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, noting: "In 
addition to Sakigake, we would like to seek cooperation with 
other people we can get along with."

  [Text] Representative Masayoshi Takemura of Sakigake 
[Harbinger] was present at a news conference held on 28 April. 
Regarding Sakigake's formation of a new floor group 
"Sakeigake-Seiun" (tentative name) with the "Group Seiun," 
composed of Dietmen who have left the New Japan Party [JNP], 
Takemura stated: "Various moves were still noticed within the 
JNP," and disclosed the new group would not be formed until 9 
May, when the long vacation comes to an end. The decision seems 
to have been made while taking into account the possibility of 
recuriting those Dietmen who have hinted at leaving the JNP.

  [Text] On 25 April, the government held a meeting of the 
"Council for Promotion of Processing Market Opening Complaints" 
(generally known as the Ombudsman Council and led by Chairman 
Yoshio Ogawara), which is composed of civilians who are 
non-government officials, to discuss how to deal with 26 cases 
of complaints connected with the standards and approval system. 
At the meeting, participants confirmed that actions had been 
decided on 24 cases. Among actions to be taken are: 
Deregulation on activities of lawyers specialized in foreign 
legal affairs; changes in food product labels to have the 
expiration date indicated; and improvement of customs procedures 
for handling imported cargoes after business hours. Regarding 
safety standards of helicopters and specifications of water 
supply equipment, it was decided that from the standpoint of 
promoting imports, the council will continue to study the 
possibility of easing standards.

  [Text] Japanese banks are actively selling their credit 
rights on the former USSR because repayment by Russia, which 
took over the former USSR's obligations, remains uncertain. 
Total Japanese bank loans to the former Soviet Union totaled 
200 billion yen at the end of March, nearly 100 billion yen less 
than in September 1993. These credits are being sold to 
European investors through European commercial banks and 
securities firms. In some cases, East European countries with 
outstanding loans with Russia are buying them to offset such 
credits. 
  A total of five or six city banks, including Fuji Bank and 
Daiichi Kangyo Bank, and a number of local banks are reportedly 
selling off their credit rights with the former USSR. 
  Most of Japanese banks-held credit rights with the former 
USSR are loans to the Russian Bank for Foreign Economic 
Relations [BFER]. The current price of credit rights on the 
Russian BFER being dealt on the international financial market 
is 27-28 percent of the face value. It has been falling since 
last December, when the price saw its peak at 54 percent. 
Although the main cause of a drop in prices is a rise in 
long-term interest rates, some analysts point out: "Japanese 
banks' active sales are another cause of a drop in the prices." 
  In addition to those of former the USSR, Japanese banks are 
actively disposing of bad loans of other nations. Last year, 
they disposed of their claimable assets of Argentina by changing 
them to Argentine government-issued bonds (Brady bonds). They 
also disposed of their credit rights with Brazil last April. 
For Japanese banks, how to sell off credits with the former 
Soviet Union is another major issue. And with this in mind, 
they have started selling their credit rights with the former 
Soviet Union.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 28 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The Prime 
Minister of Mongolia P. Jasray with his spouse has given a 
dinner at the state residence in honour of the Premier of the 
State Council of the People's Republic of China (PRC) Li Peng 
and his spouse Ju Lin staying in the country on an official 
visit. During the dinner the Prime Minister of Mongolia P. 
Jasray and his honoured guest Li Peng have exchanged speeches. 
  The Mongolian Prime Minister P. Jasray in his speech at the 
dinner welcomed on behalf of the state, government and himself 
the Premier of the State Council of PRC Li Peng and his spouse 
Ju Lin. He said that he has noted with satisfaction that over 
the last years due to the efforts of both the countries the 
bilateral relations are being intensified with strengthening its 
legal basis and cooperation being developed in all spheres. 
  The development of good neighbourly friendly relations and 
cooperation with the PRC has been and will be one of the 
priorities of the foreign policy of Mongolia. The deceased Zhou 
Enlai being the premier and prominent statesman of China paid an 
official visit to Mongolia in 1960 during which the Treaty on 
Friendship and Mutual Assistance between the two countries was 
signed. 
  34 years have been passed since that and now we with Mr Li 
Peng staying here on an official visit are going to sign a 
treaty on friendly relations and cooperation between Mongolia 
and the PRC which is to serve as the important political basic 
document for long term bilateral relations between the two 
countries. Moreover a number of agreements strengthening the 
legal basis of our relationship are to be signed as well. We 
have no doubts that the present visit by the premier of the 
State Council of China to the country which is the continuation 
of the traditional and being recently developed high-level and 
top meetings between Mongolia and China would be essential in 
the history of relationship of the two countries. 
  Nowadays Mongolia has chosen the path of democracy and is 
experiencing quite a lot of hardships in the transition to a new 
system of market relations. The prime minister expressed his 
confidence that the industrious labour and efforts exerted by 
the Mongolian people as well as the support and assistance by 
the world community would lead to a success. The prime minister 
of Mongolia stressed in this reference that he would like to 
express his gratitude to the Government of China, the Chinese 
people and personally Mr Li Peng for the respect of the choice 
of the Mongolian people, the humanitarian assistance and 
disinterested credits granted to support the efforts for 
overcoming the difficulties experienced by the country. 
  In his speech P. Jasray also greeted the progress of the 
policy of renovation being pursued with Chinese specific 
character by the PRC and directed at the development of the 
economy and raising the living standards of its people. The 
peaceful foreign policy of the PRC is an important factor in 
ensuring peace, stability and progress in the Asia-Pacific 
region as well as throughout the world said in conclusion the 
Mongolian Prime Minister P. Jasray. The premier of the State 
Council of the PRC Li Peng in his speech said that while during 
the 45 years passed since the establishment of diplomatic 
relations between China and Mongolia there was a time when the 
bilateral relations had been developed in a wrong way due to 
certain historical reasons he is pleased to note that over the 
last years the leaders of the two countries have been paying 
regularly mutual visits, the exchange of people of different 
walks has been expanded greatly, the mutual understanding and 
trust is being ever increasing and a remarkable progress is 
recorded to have been provided in all spheres of cooperation, 
contacts and ties which all is of great profit to both the 
countries and the peoples of those countries. 
  It was not easy to attain the present day's level of 
relationship between China and Mongolia and we have grounds to 
place value on it. 
  The treaty on friendship and mutual assistance concluded 34 
years ago during the visit to this country by the Premier Zhou 
Enlai was of importance in the cause of developing the 
relationship between the two countries. And now we are going to 
sign a new treaty on friendly relations and cooperation between 
China and Mongolia. I am sure that this treaty would open a new 
page in the history of relationship between China and Mongolia, 
giving an impetus to the further development of bilateral 
relations and opening more widening perspectives for friendship 
and cooperation. 
  The Government of China is attaching much significance to 
the 
relationship of China and Mongolia and will exert proper efforts 
together with the Government of Mongolia for developing the good 
neighbourly and friendly relations and cooperation for a 
long-term period orienting them up to the 21st century. 
  We respect the path of development chosen by the Mongolian 
people. We are sure and we would like to wish success in that 
the Mongolian people would be able to cope with the provisional 
difficulties and will attain the objectives of restoring its 
economy and flourishing of the country.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 28 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- Under such 
heading the newspaper "ARDYN ERH" publishes today an interview 
of the deputy head of the National Development Department L. 
Demberel who is taking part in the forthcoming III [as received]

  The trade and economic relations between Mongolia and China, 
he said, have been increasingly intensifying over a few last 
years. Just for the period from 1991 to 1993 the trade turnover 
between the two countries has increased nearly three fold. The 
government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) has granted 
to Mongolia during the years of 1991, 1992 disinterested credits 
worth 80 million yuan as well as commodities and gratis 
financial assistance. 
  In the course of the visit of the premier of the State 
Council of the PRC, he noted also, it is expected to sign a 
treaty on friendly relations and cooperation between Mongolia 
and the PRC, agreements on economic and technical cooperation, 
on granting by the Chinese Government gratis aid to Mongolia, 
cooperation on examining the quality of importing and exporting 
commodities mutually being supplied between the two countries.

  [Text] Seoul, 27 Apr -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam granted an interview to Shinichi Hakoshima, managing 
editor of ASAHI SHIMBUN's Tokyo head office, on 27 April. In 
the interview, President Kim indicated his government's position 
on the North Korean nuclear issue, and how it analyzes and sees 
the issue. However, he did not indicate concrete prospects for a 
South-North dialogue. Even on possible talks with North Korean 
President Kim Il-song meanwhile, President Kim Yong-sam said: 
"We are not going to approach the North from our side," thus 
backpedaling from his position in February when he viewed the 
second year of his government. It seems the interview reflects 
South Korea's difficult position and disappointment over its 
loss of a diplomatic channel for possible dialogue with North 
Korea, following its decision to abandon an exchange of special 
envoys for the time being -- which South Korea says is a 
precondition for a third round of talks between high-ranking 
U.S. and North Korean officials. 
  Concerning the possible South-North dialogue, President Kim 
merely said: "If talks between the United States and North 
Korea are held, the situation will then enter a stage of mutual 
nuclear inspections in both South and North Korea. In this 
sense, North (Korea) will have to show its sincere position on 
resuming the South-North dialogue." In his written answers to 
ASAHI questions, he took care not to directly commit himself in 
answering the issue of South-North dialogue. 
  Moreover, President Kim said: "North Korea's economic 
situation, including food supplies, will become increasingly 
serious as time goes by. This is the reason for North Korea's 
desire to improve its relations with the United States. Time is 
on our side." In this way, he indicated his view that North 
Korea will eventually compromise although he did not refer to 
the timing of North Korea's concession. 
  In the middle of April, following the South Korean 
government's decision to no longer exchange envoys with North 
Korea, the United States and South Korea discussed the issue of 
South-North dialogue. They agreed to set the resumption and 
"meaningful progress" in negotiations as preconditions for the 
third round of high-level talks between the United States and 
North Korea; along with North Korea's acceptance of full 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  As a new form of dialogue, the holding of South-North prime 
ministerial talks and resumption of the nuclear control joint 
committee based on a joint denuclearization statement (announced 
in December 1992) are being considered. However, prospects for 
North Korea's acceptance of such proposals are dim. It seems 
that South Korean President Kim's lack of concrete proposals for 
resuming South-North dialogue reflect gloomy prospects. 
  On possible summit talks with North Korean President Kim 
Il-song, South Korean President Kim Yong-sam said: "The 
previous government took positive action in working on North 
Korea to hold the summit talks. But I think the summit talks 
will naturally materialize, and in this sense, my government has 
not taken positive action." 
  At a news conference last February when he saw the first 
anniversary of the inauguration of his government, President Kim 
said: "I want to promote efforts to seek summit talks with 
North Korean President Kim if the talks help solve the nuclear 
issue." This remark drew the attention of the international 
community because he had previously said: "We do not want to 
hold a summit meeting for talks." However, in the ASAHI 
interview, he backpedaled from his position of last February, 
and now can be seen as reflecting South Korea's difficulties in 
prospects for a South-North dialogue. 
  In a written letter to ASAHI SHIMBUN, he said: "We are 
making efforts to create a favorable atmosphere for U.S.-DPRK 
working-level talks in the hope of bringing about an early 
solution to the nuclear question. We hope the working-level 
talks to be held soon will bear substantive results." 
  Judging from his above remarks, it can be said that South 
Korea's decision to abandon the envoy exchange is in order to 
promote a dialogue between the United States and North Korea; 
and that, underlying such a decision is its aim to show both 
domestic and foreign nations, including North Korea, its stand 
of being deeply involved in U.S. policymaking even after the 
abandonment of envoy exchanges.

  [Text] Seoul, 27 Apr -- ROK President Kim Yong-sam's 
letter in response to ASAHI SHIMBUN's questions is summarized 
below: 
<H5>  The North Korean Nuclear Issue and China's Role </H5>
  The reality with respect to North Korea's [DPRK] nuclear 
program is that the North is thought to have secured enough 
plutonium to produce at least one to three (nuclear arms). 
  China has had friendly relations with North Korea for a long 
time, supplying crude oil and foodstuffs to that country. China 
can exercise more influence on North Korea than any other 
country. In light of the fact that almost all of what China 
wanted in the process of the UN Security Council adopting a UN 
secretary general announcement was accepted, it is hoped China 
will continue to fulfill its responsible role in solving the 
nuclear question hereafter. 
<H5>  U.S.-DPRK Talks and South-North Dialogue </H5>
  Removal of suspicion about the DPRK's nuclear program is the 
first stop for restoration of trust between South and North 
Korea. Only when this question is resolved will South and North 
Korea be able to march toward substantive improvement of 
relations step by step. 
  The issue of the ROK-U.S. joint military exercise "Team 
Spirit" will be resolved automatically if South and North Korea 
enter the stage of conducting mutual nuclear inspections. 
  We are making efforts to create a favorable atmosphere for 
U.S.-DRPK working-level talks in the hope of bringing about an 
early solution to the nuclear question. We hope the 
working-level talks to be held soon will bear substantive 
results. 
  I hope I will be able to build a firm basis for South-North 
reunification during my term of office. 
<H5>  The North Korean Military Threat </H5>
  It is true that North Korea has stepped up antiaircraft 
drills in and around the Yongbyong district (where the 
nuclear-related facilities are located) and has reinforced its 
military capabilities in part since its nuclear arms development 
question became a subject of criticism by the international 
community. 
  But we have not been able to observe specific signs that 
North Korea will make military provocations; the "crisis on the 
Korean peninsula" (reported) in overseas mass media recently can 
be said to have been exaggerated in some parts. North Korea has 
a heavily armed, 1 million-strong regular force, and long-range 
missiles it developed on its own. It has 65 percent of its 
military power deployed along the demilitarized zone. 
<H5>  IAEA Inspections </H5>
  North Korea must not only accept additional inspections on 
the radiation chemical laboratory being discussed with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as well as inspections 
accompanying the changes of fuel rods, but must also accept 
special inspections by the IAEA on unreported facilities. These 
special inspections and South-North mutual nuclear inspections 
are two different things. 
<H5>  Security Cooperation in East Asia and the Question of Japan </H5>
Becoming a UN Security Council Permanent Member 
  Since the end of the Cold War, security conditions in the 
Northeast Asia region have in general turned for the better, but 
instability remains because of such problem as the nuclear 
suspicion in North Korea. The continued U.S. role is extremely 
important to build a stable order in this area. 
  Furthermore, in view of the unclear security conditions of 
the Northeast Asian region, a dialogue on security is necessary. 
Dialogue among countries in this region should be conducted in 
ways to augment such bilateral security systems as those 
existing between South Korea and the United States, and between 
the United States and Japan. South Korea is willing to actively 
participate in security dialogue in the region and believes it 
should have close cooperation with Japan while doing so. 
  We think discussions on reorganizing the UN Security Council 
are appropriate timewise. We hope Japan will play constructive 
roles--appropriate for its national power--in international 
arenas like the United Nations. 
  Under its reform and open-door policy, China will continue 
to 
grow economically; and will attempt to achieve improved unity 
nationally and to play increased roles internationally. We hope 
that in doing so, China will make contributions to bringing 
about stability in Northeast Asia.

<F P=106> [Report from "The Regional Desk"] </F>
  [Text] For much of the past decade, Southeast Asia's 
economic growth has been the envy of the world. The region has 
been held up as a model of development by the World Bank and its 
success has led to a rethink of the way economies are managed in 
the recession-mired West. In its recent annual survey, the Asian 
Development Bank predicted the area's leading economies would 
continue to crackle along at close to double-digit pace for at 
least the next two years and perhaps until the end of the 
decade. With a new World Trading Order coming into effect, China 
emerging as the fourth global economic engine and old political 
boundaries to trade being swept aside, prospects for the 
Southeast Asian states have probably never looked brighter. 
  But as this promise of a seemingly unending boom unveils, 
there are also more than a few clouds looming on the horizon. 
  Among the flashpoints for anxiety are the political upheaval 
in Japan, a growing balance of payments deficits in Indonesia 
and the Philippines, the trade dispute between China and the 
United States and manpower shortages. 
  Possibly the most entrenched problem facing all the Asean 
states is flagging foreign investor interest. 
  According to a survey by Merrill Lynch International Bank 
released last month, 1993 data on direct foreign investment 
largely confirms earlier suspicions that the sub-region's 
attractiveness is slipping as foreign firms focussed more on 
China, India and Vietnam. Other than the Philippines, which 
reported a sharp 85 percent jump in investments to $529 million 
in 1993, the other three developing economies of Southeast 
Asia--Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia--all registered declines 
in approved investments for the second consecutive year. 
  Thailand and Malaysia were the worst hit. Approvals for 
foreign equity fell 68.1 percent to $233 million in Thailand, 
and dropped by over 60 percent to $912 million in Malaysia. 
  Indonesia experienced a more modest four percent fall in 
approvals to $7.72 billion in the same period. 
  Much of the surge in foreign investment, which fuelled the 
Southeast Asian boom in the early 1980s was driven by the need 
of Japan and other nations, hit by appreciation of their 
currencies, to maintain export markets abroad. 
  "With diminishing importance of low-cost labour as a key 
investment criteria, and the emergence of big domestic markets 
like China and India, Southeast Asian nations will need to 
develop a new set of comparative advantages to revive investor 
interest," the Merrill Lynch report said. 
  Finance analysts expect the next wave of foreign investment 
into Southeast Asia to target the services industries if host 
governments are prepared to lay out the welcome mat. This would 
mean more conventional ways to attract investments such as more 
business-friendly policies, cutting red tape and ensuring a good 
operating climate supported by strong infrastructure, bankers 
say. 
  For many foreign investors, the objective now is to seek 
access to domestic markets. But investment laws in most Asean 
nations, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia, are only liberal 
on permissible foreign equity if the bulk of production is for 
export. 
  By comparison, China and India allow majority-owned foreign 
ventures in a wide range of industries, and the two countries 
are reaping the benefits of their more liberal laws. Investment 
approvals for China last year rose by more than 385 percent to 
$58.12 billion in 1993. In India, they jumped 93.7 percent to 
$2.91 billion. 
<H5>  Infrastructure Woes </H5>
  In addition to the requirements of the private sector there 
is an even greater need within the region for investment to 
address heavy infrastructure shortcomings if growth is to be 
secured, bankers and analysts say. 
  The ADB estimates that Asia--excluding Japan--will need 
nearly one trillion dollars in the next decade for 
infrastructure such as roads and power plants telecommunications 
and railways to maintain economic growth. 
  Urging the region to raise spending on basic development by 
40 percent the ADB warned in its annual report that "any lag in 
the supply of infrastructure will undoubtedly slow down 
development over time, even if all other factors are favourable". 
  Power and transport needed most new spending. Each sector 
required $300-350 billion in investment, telecommunications $150 
billion and water supply and sanitation up to $100 billion by 
the year 2000. 
  The sheer size of the amount of money needed will require 
governments, many who are already pressed by growing budget 
deficits, to look past traditional sources of capital such as 
the World Bank and the ADB. 
  "It is becoming apparent that our needs will outstrip the 
resources of these institutions. We must turn to private capital 
providers," Indonesia's Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said at 
the recent Apec Finance Ministers meeting in Honolulu. 
  But while regional governments are aware of the need for 
long-term investment funds, many fear that real flows of private 
capital, and in particular speculative "hot" money into stock 
markets will lead to instability. They argue that at the moment 
there are no guarantees on the nature or direction of capital 
flows except regulation. 
  The investor economies, such as the United States and Europe 
argue that regulation does little to attract capital. Washington 
was particularly active at the Apec finance minister's meeting 
pressing Asian economies to further open their financial markets. 
  But with financial services excluded from the Uruguay Round 
accord which was signed in Marrakesh earlier this month, Asian 
nations have won some breathing space to resist Western demands 
for further liberalisation. 
  Early indicators suggest that in the interim they are 
cautiously taking steps to remedy the problem. Southeast Asian 
capital market regulators agreed earlier this month to set up a 
forum to evolve common procedures for tapping overseas funds and 
beef up enforcement of laws governing their fledgling markets. 
  Thailand granted offshore status to 34 foreign banks in 
March 
last year. Asean countries are also looking at sources closer to 
home to raise capital. The Kuala Lumpur based Asean Institute, 
which was launched in 1991 as a private sector initiative to 
promote closer economic ties among the six member countries 
announced plans last week to launch a 1-million ringgit (US$40 
million) investment fund next month that will specialize in 
Southeast Asian economies. 
  Singapore, traditionally an investor in established 
capitalist economies, is targeting developing Asian nations for 
20-30 percent of its reserve capital. 
  Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said Singapore would be looking 
at Vietnam, India and even Burma for regional investment 
opportunities, but primarily to China. 
<H5>  Changing Economic Landscape </H5>
  While the rapid emergence of China as an economic power has 
diverted foreign investment funds from Southeast Asia, the Asean 
states are also ideally positioned to profit from the giant's 
growth. 
  "China took up the slack of the stimulus from advanced 
countries," Lawrence Krause of the Pacific Economic Cooperation 
Council [PECC] said at the forum's 10th international general 
meeting in Kuala Lumpur in March. 
  "China's imports have grown by more than 25 percent in the 
last two years and a growing share of imports are coming from 
the PECC countries," he said. 
  Access to the huge internal markets of China and India, 
which 
have a combined population of two billion, is expected to help 
maintain Southeast Asia's dynamism and reduce its vulnerability 
to adverse trends in markets in the industrial world. 
  But in the short term, the rapid growth of the Chinese 
economy -- a world leading 13 percent last year -- poses 
problems of its own. 
  China's sizzling growth is widely viewed as unsustainable 
and 
the government, wrestling with the social problems of runaway 
inflation and the spiralling costs of domestic investment, is 
expected to slam on the monetary brakes soon. Such action could 
lead to a drastic decline in economic activity. 
  "With the Pacific region so dependent upon the economic 
outcome in China, there is much concern that an extreme cannot 
be avoided," Krause said. 
  Adding to concerns about China, is Washington's threat to 
strip the country of preferential trade status unless it 
improves its human rights record. If carried through, the move 
would affect billions of dollars worth of exports and trigger a 
trade war that could shave several growth points off many of the 
economies in Asia. A similarly bitter dispute between Washington 
and Tokyo over access for US companies to Japanese markets could 
also have a destabilizing impact on economies in the region. 
  Japan, already hampered by a strong yen, structural 
imbalances and balance sheet adjustment after declines in equity 
and real estate prices, is just beginning to show signs of 
recovery from its most serious recession since the last world 
war. A rupture in trade ties with the United States would be 
devastating to its weak recovery and damaging to its trading 
partners. In 1993, for the first time, Japanese trade within the 
region was greater than that with the United States. The US and 
Japanese economies are so heavily interdependent, however, that 
any fallout between the trading giants would have serious 
repercussions with its smaller trading partners. 
<H5>  Aids and Social Problems </H5>
  While economic growth has spawned a growing middle class, 
Asia's success hides the largest concentration of poor in the 
world. 
  The ADB's usual optimism was tempered this year by concern 
over unchecked population growth, urban poverty, environmental 
decline and the spectre of an uncontrolled Aids epidemic among 
Asia's teeming billions. 
  The growing Aids epidemic could force nations to change 
their 
development priorities towards greater efforts to reduce 
poverty, the bank said. 
  Regional bankers also note shortages in skilled and 
semi-skilled labour and political instability in Indonesia and 
Thailand as areas which could help prevent the Southeast Asian 
states from making their apparent date with development.

<F P=106> [By Surachai Chuphaka] </F>
  [Text] Economic ministers from the six Asean states began a 
week-long meeting last Saturday to formulate a new vision for 
the regional bloc in the wake of the signing of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade accord in Marrakesh two weeks ago. 
  Officially known as the Asean Economic Ministers (AEM) 
meeting, the forum represents an unprecedented attempt by Asean 
to determine its role in the fast changing global trade 
environment. 
  Participants at the meeting outlined three principal goals: 
First, Asean members are to seek a framework on which to 
develop Asean cooperation in the service sector. Deputy Prime 
Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, said Asean is working toward 
greater cooperation among members in the finance, insurance and 
telecommunications sectors, primarily as a safeguard; against 
pressure from industrialized countries. 
  Second, Asean will have to play an important role in the 
World Trade Organization (WTO), a body created at the Gatt 
ratification, so that Asean members have a forum for preserving 
their interests and resisting domination by economic powers like 
the United States or Japan. 
  Asean ministers see the linking of labour laws with trading 
privileges as a way of creating trade advantages in favour of 
developed countries. Asean has called for labour issues to be 
addressed by the International Labour Organization, and not 
included on the WTO agenda. 
  Lastly, the ministers have decided on a long-term course, 
envisaging trade competition among trade organizations like 
Nafta and the European Community (EC), and taking into account 
the economic adjustment of such major countries as Japan, India 
and China. 
  In the wake of increasing trade liberalization with Nafta 
extending into South America and the EC transforming its 
organisation into a transcontinental body and still growing, 
Asean cannot stay complacent. It must adapt itself to the new 
global arena. 
  Afta, Asean feels, will have to accelerate its efforts to 
lower tariffs among Asean members ahead of the 15 year time 
frame, (while complying with the Gatt requirement that members 
must lower tariffs within 10 years after 1996), to create a 
stronger Afta capable of competing with other free trade 
organizations. 
  Asean ministers also agreed to slate agricultural products 
for Afta tariff reduction in order to increase the trading 
volume within the group and to keep in line with the Gatt tariff 
reduction conditions for agriculture products. 
  Asean, the ministers recommended, should look to expanding 
its transactions with other trade organizations like Nafta to 
augment the volume of trade, and to create a broader product mix 
as most of Asean's members share the same commodities. This, the 
minister reasoned, would strengthen and upgrade the Asean 
economy. 
  The Asean ministers also acknowledged the necessity to erect 
a police exchange mechanism (PEM) as part of its effort to 
reduce unnecessary competition among Asean members to obtain 
foreign investment. 
  The ministers will assign senior Asean officials to study 
and 
work out plans to be presented at a meeting in September in 
Chiang Mai, before a normal ratification at the next Asean 
Summit in Bangkok the following year.

<F P=106> [Report by Kulachada Chaphiphat] </F>
  [Text] Just as enthusiasm increases for substantive 
sub-regional economic cooperation, the Asian Development Bank 
(ADB) is finding it hard to meet its lending capacity goals. The 
Bank is under pressure to implement its identified projects. 
  At the recent Conference on Subregional Economic 
Cooperation, 
infrastructure and energy were high on the agendas of the Mekong 
countries, and ADB had hoped to play a landmark role in funding 
the massive amounts of investment required. 
  Given the loan squeeze, the Bank, rather than playing 
`family 
doctor' was forced to fund many white elephant projects. 
  "The Bank as an institution must move beyond the traditional 
private sector `window' and explore innovative mechanisms for 
public-private partnerships, and find effective ways to link 
technical project information to the investment decisions of 
enterprises," ADB's President Mitsuo Sato told the heads of the 
six nation delegation from Cambodia, China, Myanmar [Burma], 
Laos, Thailand and Vietnam at the Third Conference on Mekong 
sub-regional economic cooperation last week in Hanoi. 
  Sato also urged greater responsibility on the part of 
regional governments in finding unilateral and collective 
approaches to regulatory, legal and institutional bottlenecks in 
order to attract massive private sector investment in so-called 
"hard side" projects like transport and energy development. 
  He stressed that "soft side" economic cooperation, (chiefly 
energy management coordination), though hardest to implement, 
must be simultaneously addressed along with "hard side" 
cooperation. 
  The reorientation of the Bank's policy to seek private 
sector 
help in regional development stemmed mainly from tightening 
budget control. The private funding is needed, however, to help 
share in its lending which this year reached more than US$ 10 
billion for infrastructure projects in the Mekong region. 
  The Bank's 1993 annual report, released last week, said the 
ADB members should widen the private sector's role in 
infrastructure projects, expected to soar to one trillion 
dollars by 2000. Beyond 2000, the private sector's funding of 
the subregional projects will account for 70 percent of 
investment in the region. 
  The Bank's Programs Director (West) Noritada Morita said in 
an exclusive interview with The Nation that the role of the 
private sector in financing these projects in the future will be 
formidable, and greatly complement the Bank's funding options. 
  With increasing private sector involvement, Morita said, the 
Bank's role is to continue to provide technical information and 
to act as a middle agent to meet the needs of each country in 
the Mekong region. 
  Morita also shared widely held concerns about the possible 
negative effects of private sector involvement in subregional 
economic development, especially concerning the impact of 
development on societies and the environment. 
  He said the responsibility lies on each government to 
control 
potential environmental damage caused by private sector 
involvement. Governments, he said, should provide tax privileges 
and other incentives for sound environmental policies on the 
part of the private sector. 
  "It is very difficult to say. Ability to combat 
environmental 
abuse depends on the maturity of the society the government and 
the public," he said. 
  The Bank has come under pressure from traditional donors, in 
particular the United States, who are looking to channel 
financial resources to other emerging areas besides the Mekong 
subregion. 
  Nevertheless, the Bank's 55-member agency was able to defend 
its proposed capital increase from US$14 to 28 billion this 
year, with the aid of Japan. The Bank is committed to conducting 
a basic reform of both its structure and policy to weed out the 
bad projects and raise lending criteria. 
  The Bank has been criticized for unsuccessful projects. 
About 
20 percent of ADB projects, mostly in infrastructure, have been 
unsuccessful, although it still rates well in comparison to 
similar institutions. 
  Morita, echoing Sato's policy, said the Bank was devising a 
new lending strategy incorporating environmental provisions into 
funding eligibility requirements. A blueprint of the Bank's 
restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of this 
year. 
  Among the "soft side" projects proposed at last week's 
conference was the proposed creation of an environmental forum 
to engage policy makers and private agencies to address 
environmental concerns and formulate regional standards for 
environmental regulations. It also included the setting up of a 
working committee on trade to look into ways to harmonize trade 
and tariff codes which have impeded cross border economic 
cooperation. 
  Morita described the meeting as extremely successful, as 
participating countries were not only be able to show their 
readiness to take part in the "hard side" of economic 
cooperation, namely transport and energy sectors, but also an 
increased willingness to cooperate on the "soft," but harder to 
implement, side of economic cooperation. 
  An official attending the conference expressed caution, 
however. "Some projects are designed to make the Bank look good 
and to please donors but did not really address demands of 
lenders," the official commented. 
  The official said that while there was an increasing concern 
for environmental degradation in the subregion, not all 
participating countries are ready to join hands, and some 
preferred that it be addressed at the national level. 
  The failure of the delegations from Cambodia, Thailand and 
Vietnam to deal with off-shore disputes regarding oil and gas 
production demonstrated that certain sensitive areas exist which 
defy resolution by the conference. 
  Morita, however, said the Bank's success should not be 
measured by the number of projects that were agreed upon by 
participating countries. 
  "Our success is in helping small countries sustain economic 
growth and development, in helping these countries reform their 
economies, and in making the private sector more active. 
Ultimately we are striving [to] reduce poverty in the region," 
he said.

  [Text] Lieutenant General Anuson Kritsanaserani, director 
of the Information Office of the Supreme Command Headquarters, 
told reporters at office headquarters at Sanam Suapa, Bangkok, 
yesterday that the situation near the Cambodian border is not 
peaceful due to continued fighting inside Cambodia between 
Cambodian Government military forces and Khmer Rouge forces. 
The fighting near the Thai border district of Aranyaprathet, 
Sakaeo Province, has resulted in a number of artillery shells 
falling on Thai territory and caused damage to the lives and 
property of Thai people living along the border. More than 
30,000 Cambodians have fled across the border into Thai 
territory. The senior Thai military official reported that the 
Khmer Rouge have seized part of the area of Km 12 of the 
Poipet-Sisophon Road, which is a major transport route. Their 
actions are aimed at blocking the Cambodian Government's troop 
reinforcements, who seek to wipe out Khmer Rouge forces and also 
Phnum Malai which serves as a Khmer Rouge major stronghold. 
This road is also an important route for the transport of 
various kinds of goods from Thailand to Cambodia. With the 
seizure by the Khmer Rouge, the route has been cut and this will 
cause great difficulties for the Cambodian Government and 
people. The Thai people living along the border in 
Aranyaprathet District, Sakaeo Province are advised to be 
cautious regarding possible dangers caused by the fighting 
between the two Cambodian factions and always to follow closely 
and listen to warnings from Thai military authorities.

  [Text] Thailand repatriated a total of 998 Cambodians and 
some 400 Lao refugees and displaced persons this week. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the Cambodians mainly 
comprise children, women, and the elderly, who fled the war in 
Cambodia to Ta Phraya District of Prachin Buri Province. They 
were sheltered temporily in an area of 5 rai provided by the 
Thai Government. The area is about two kilometers from the 
Cambodian border. 
  Meanwhile, Secretary General of the National Security 
Council 
Khachatphai Burutphat said more than 400 Lao refugees and 
displaced persons were repatriated yesterday through the 
Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge. It is the highest number of Laos 
returnees repatriated from the Thai soil this year. 
  The Lao refugees and displaced persons are all the Hmong 
hilltribe people who were sheltered at the Ban Napho 
repatriation center in Nakhon Phanom Province. 
  The National Security Council plans to close the 
repatriation 
center within the end of this year.

  [Text] Thailand has rejected China's proposal to sell 
electricity that would be generated from seven large-scale 
hydroelectric projects to be built in southern China, opposite 
the Kingdom's northern region. 
  Senior officials of the Yunnan power utilities made the 
proposal to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand 
(EGAT) which rejected it out of hand because the Thai body views 
the undertaking as not economically viable. 
  EGAT's rejection could restrict the southern Chinese 
authorities' ambitious plan to develop hydroelectric plants 
along the Manwan River (Lan Xan in Thai) which offers a massive 
generating potential of 19,000 megawatts (MW). 
  Yunnan wants to establish Thailand as a major market for its 
electricity exports, aside from supplying the power from the 
proposed schemes to Canton [as published], the other 
economically vibrant southern area. It initially offered to 
supply 500 MW to EGAT. 
  It also aborted the effort by a group of Thai companies 
which 
had been seeking to play a key part in the investment and 
development of those hydroelectric schemes to meet Thailand's 
explosive growth in electricity demand, now growing at 10-12 
percent a year. 
  Senior EGAT officials said their rejection was based on two 
reasons. First, there was sufficient indigenous power supplies 
in northern Thailand generated by EGAT's huge lignite-fired Mae 
Moh power complex and therefore, supplies from China would be 
redundant. 
  Secondly, importing and transmitting the Chinese electricity 
to central Thailand would be limited by prohibitive costs. The 
length of the transmission line involved would be some 1,000 km, 
they said. 
  As far as the importation of electricity from neighbouring 
countries is concerned, EGAT appears to give a higher priority 
on importing power from Laos and much preparation is underway in 
this direction. 
  Last June, the Thai government through EGAT had signed a 
memorandum of understanding with the Lao government for 
Vientiane to supply up to 1,500 MW of electricity to the Kingdom 
by the turn of the century. 
  Laos has recently signed a memorandum of understanding with 
an international consortium for it to develop a major 
hydroelectric project in Laos as part of the June memorandum. 
  The consortium will invest US$1 billion to develop the Nam 
Thuen T1 hydroelectric plant with a generating capacity of 600 
MW to be entirely exported to Thailand under terms which have 
vet to be agreed upon.

  [Text] Thailand and Vietnam signed a memorandum of 
understanding on intellectual property, the first of its kind 
between the two developing countries in this fast-growing region 
of the world. 
  The document was signed by representatives from Thailand's 
Ministry of Commerce and Vietnam's Ministry of Science, 
Technology and Environment during the visit by Deputy Minister 
of Commerce Churin Laksanawisit to Vietnam during April 22 to 
24, 1994. 
  The agreement is aimed at making Thailand a center for 
intellectual property registration and claims for Indochina. 
  Deputy Minister Churin said that Vietnam is in agreement in 
Thailand's proposal. 
  The memorandum of standing signed by the two sides provided 
opportunities for both countries to exchange information on 
laws, procedures in registration of patents, trademarks, and 
copyrights, registrated marks and patents, and cooperation in 
personnel development. 
  Churin said that the signing of the memorandum of 
understanding with Vietnam will benefit Thai business people and 
investors, facilitating the registration of their trademarks and 
protecting their intellectual property rights.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday admitted that 
security measures in the South are inadequate. 
  He said violence in the region including last year's 
torching 
of more than 30 schools in the southernmost provinces and 
Saturday's bomb blast at Nakhon Si Thammarat's railway station, 
had adversely affected investment in the South. 
  Chuan told a gathering of Islamic religious leaders that 
while people in the South may have become accustomed to such 
incidents, those outside the region were scared by the press 
reports. 
  He said religious leaders could help solve the problem of 
violence by giving officials information when incidents occurred 
and telling people in their communities to behave themselves. 
  Many acts of sabotage have occurred in the South since Chuan 
took office in 1992, the bomb last Saturday which killed three 
people and injured at least 27 others being only the most recent. 
  The opposition has threatened to file a no-confidence motion 
against the government over public security. 
  Deputy Interior Minister Suthat Ngoenmun said it was the 
duty 
and right of the opposition to file a no-confidence motion. The 
government must publicly explain to avoid confusion, he said. 
  He said police should come up with better measures and 
intelligence to prevent violence. Police performance in dealing 
with bombing incidents dissatisfied the people, the press and 
the opposition, Suthat said. 
  "I'm not happy. I'm not satisfied with police performance in 
preventing and suppressing crime," Suthat said. "Intelligence 
services should be better. I don't know what their problem is, 
since the government has allocated a budget for them." 
  He said police chief Prathin Santipraphop should not comment 
on cases while things are still unclear. This only confuses the 
public and allows the culprits to escape. 
  Suthat said evidence, witnesses and investigative procedures 
should be kept secret. Police should not publicly reveal 
everything because this affects the investigations. 
  He said Pol Gen [Police General] Prathin is a capable 
officer, but he may not have a strong enough team to help him. 
  Deputy Interior Minister Chamni Sakdiset said Interior 
Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut was ready to face the opposition 
in Parliament, should it initiate a censure debate. 
  He said police should investigate all possible motives 
behind 
Saturday's bomb blast, including personal affairs and politics.

  [Excerpts] The current level of inflation, which is 
slightly higher than projected, is no threat to long-term 
economic growth, says Bank of Thailand Governor Wichit Suphinit. 
  He said the current inflation rate is 4.8 percent, a level 
considered not too high and is only a point-in-time measurement 
and not the annual average figure. 
  He noted that inflation has been caused by agricultural 
commodities prices, which have risen by 5.8 percent, while the 
prices of non-agricultural commodities have risen by only 3.8 
percent. 
  Savings in the first quarter of 1994 expanded 15.9 percent 
while credit expanded 22.8 percent. Commercial banks have 
raised interest rates to entice savings. The country's saving 
rate is estimated to lag investment by 6 percent, said Mr Wichit. 
  The governor maintained that the widening gap between 
savings 
and credit extension, and the higher inflation rate, are not 
alarming. [passage omitted on comments by commercial bank 
officials] 
  Meanwhile, huge capital inflows through the Bangkok 
International Banking Facility of 110.58 billion baht in the 
first quarter helped Thailand avert a capital shortfall. 
  The inflow through this channel in the first quarter last 
year amounted to only 15.5 billion baht, Mr Wichit said . 
  Capital inflows in other channels suffered declines: direct 
investment dropped two billion baht investment in securities 
dropped 8.3 billion baht and non-resident deposits dropped 16.8 
billion baht. 
  Total capital inflow to the private sector in the first 
quarter amounted to 76.58 billion baht, lower than the 82.34 
billion baht in the same quarter last year, according to Mr 
Wichit. 
  He also noted that net capital inflow to the private sector 
in 1994 would be around US$10 billion, compared with the US$13 
billion in 1993. 
  The shortfall was primarily caused by recent changes in US 
interest rates.

  [Text] Thailand's economy continued to sustain impressive 
growth during the first quarter of this year as a result of 
higher exports, consumption and investment by both the 
government and state enterprise agencies, according to the Bank 
of Thailand. 
  Private sector investment, however, weakened during the 
period due to a decline in investment from abroad. Slow progress 
in mega-infrastructural projects also contributed to a slowdown 
in private investment. 
  Production in the manufacturing construction, trade and 
service sectors continued to expand from the last quarter of 
last year while production in the agricultural sector weakened. 
  The bank, however, pointed out that higher consumption and 
lower agricultural output contributed to higher commodity 
prices, leading to higher inflation in both the food and 
non-food sectors. 
  The consumer price index rose 4.8 268460064uring the first quarter 
of this@ year, compared with a 3.3rise during the same period 
of 1993. 
  Prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks rose 6.2, while 
non-food prices went up 3.9 
  Concerning external trade position, exports rose 16.8as a 
result of the improving economy of Thailand's trading partners-- 
particularly, the US. The removal of Thailand from the US 
priority foreign country list (PFC) also contributed to higher 
exports. 
  Imports rose only 12.4 268460064uring the first quarter of this 
year. Imports of oil products dropped, but imports of non-oil 
products-- particularly, consumer goods -- rose considerably 
causing the country to suffer a trade deficit of 68.8 billion 
baht during the period or about the same level as the deficit 
recorded during the same quarter last year. 
  The current account deficit rose marginally from the same 
period of last year to 47 billion baht. 
  Net capital inflow totalled 80 billion baht, a small 
increase 
from the same period of last year, while payments surplus 
remained nearly constant at 21.52 billion baht. Official 
reserves, as of the end of March, stood at US$26.67 billion or 
an equivalent of 6.6 months of imports. 
  The Government's fiscal position weakened somewhat during 
this quarter as import and excise taxes on car imports dropped 
considerably. The cash account surplus was only 10.58 billion 
baht during the period, compared to 27.61 billion baht for the 
same period of 1993. 
  But Phisit Lee-artham, a central bank spokesman, said that 
during the first half of this fiscal year (October 1993-March 
1994), the Government's expenditures rose 22.82000060040ver the same 
period of the preceding year, while revenue rose only 13 
  As a result, the Government suffered a cash deficit of 17 
billion baht compared to a surplus of 9.5 billion baht recorded 
during the same period of the preceding year. 
  This is the first time in seven years that the Government 
has 
suffered a cash deficit during the first half of its fiscal 
year, but he said he expects the situation to return to normal 
during the second half. 
  Mr Phisit said deposit at banks, as of the end of March, 
stood at 122 billion baht, which represented a decrease of 38 
billion baht from the end of last year. He said the drop in 
bank deposits may stem from the fact that the public had 
invested over 30 billion baht in mutual funds in the period.

<F P=106> [From the "On the Level" column by Alex Magno: "Descent to </F>
Madness"] 
  [Text] The far Left has managed to remain in the news by 
virtue, principally, of the scandalousness that has 
characterized the factional fighting afflicting its tattered 
ranks. 
  That scandalousness has gained in shrillness lately. As a 
consequence, the far Left managed to remain in the news -- 
helped along by the sheer uneventfulness of newfound 
predictability in the political mainstream. 
  A former NPA [New People's Army] commander, identified with 
the "rejectionist" camp was murdered in Antipolo a few months 
ago. The assailants never bothered to claim responsibility. 
Pro-Sison partisans are believed culpable by the victim's 
colleagues. 
  Early this month, Leopoldo Mabilangan was assassinated in 
front of a church. After four discomfiting days of hesitation, 
the Melito Glor Command -- led by a fanatical follower of 
self-exiled Jose Ma. Sison [Joma] -- took responsibility for the 
crime. 
  The Utrecht-based troika of Jose Ma. Sison, Luis Jalandoni, 
and Antonio Zumel first attempted to deny their faction's 
involvement. When the Southern Tagalog NPA commander, Gregorio 
"Ka [Comrade] Roger" Rosal, admitted to the crime, the Utrecht 
troika quickly reversed itself and supported their last 
guerrilla loyalist to the hilt. 
  Encouraged by the support from his self-exiled bosses, Rosal 
announced he would proceed with his "people's court" proceedings 
against senior leftist personalities associated with the 
anti-Sison factions. Sison had called for the trial of his 
rivals last year. 
  At that point, the international "debate" within the CPP 
[Communist Party of the Philippines] descended into new depths 
of madness. 
  Former CPP personalities now operating in the open dared 
Sison and his loyal serf Rosal to go ahead and shoot them. The 
scene was both tragic and comic. Those who once observed with 
awe the seriousness and heroism with which the Left activists 
went about their self-styled political mission could not believe 
what they were seeing and hearing. 
  From the outside, it would seem that the contending factions 
in the CPP have fielded death squads against each other. What 
is left of the Left appears ready to go down in an orgy of 
mutual liquidation. 
  Carlos Forte, head of the CPP Manila-Rizal Regional 
Committee, warned Sison that, should the "people's court" 
venture proceed, the self-exiled leader's own safety would only 
be "a phone call away." The counter-threat was hardly veiled. 
  The counter-threat threw Sison into one of his increasingly 
frequent hysterical moods. The man who ordered, from the 
relative safety of distant self-exile, that "people's courts" be 
set up against his erstwhile comrades was last heard throwing a 
tantrum over the possibility that he may not be so safe after 
all. 
  By irresponsibly leveling the wildest charges against his 
erstwhile comrades, Sison burned the bridges of reconciliation 
among the contending factions of a confused movement. By 
threatening his erstwhile comrades with liquidation (after some 
gesture of a "trial" by a kangaroo court), Sison made them 
vulnerable to violent tricks played by third parties. 
  Confronted now by the possibility that his erstwhile 
comrades 
could balance the terror, Sison flew completely off the handle, 
conjuring a "plot" participated in jointly by his own comrades 
and by the military. 
  Loosening the rein on his deep-seated paranoia, Sison 
declares that a hit squad was now in Europe to get him. The 
squad, he says, is led by a certain "Narding." It is, he says, 
funded by the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines to the tune of P500,000 [Philippine pesos]. 
  The pathetic exile is obviously picking his facts from thin 
air. His paranoia is laced with a generous dose of megalomania: 
he thinks he is important enough for so many people to bother 
having him killed. 
  If Sison were not so far detached as he is, he might have 
noticed his own irrelevance. Were it not for the comic relief 
that he brings to our front pages, he would have been ignored. 
He has single-handedly degraded the political debate in the 
Left to the level of the burlesque, laden with cheap intrigue 
and bizarre accusation. Having squandered the credibility of 
the movement he pretends to lead, Sison now widens the 
possibility for fraternal bloodshed. 
  The man is beyond help. The real wonder is the handful of 
fanatical loyalists who continue to take him seriously. 
  It is not the many goblins in Sison's mind that is the more 
substantial question. There is no political solution to that 
problem. 
  The real challenge confronting those in the Left still in 
possession of their sanity is how to retrieve what remains of 
the movement from the abyss of madness into which it has fallen. 
There is nothing to gain from joining Joma in the game of 
mutually assured destruction. There is nothing to gain from 
this silly exchange of threat and counter-threat. 
  There is much to save in the political Left: its example of 
selflessness, its faith in the possibility of a more humane 
future, its exemplary patriotism. That could be saved by the 
recovery of sobriety, reasonableness, and sympathy for the best 
in others -- virtues that used to be in abundance in this 
community of militants and activists. 
  If the Left's retrieval of sanity is not accomplished soon, 
this entire community will be condemned not to the dustbin, but 
to the asylum of history.

  [Text] Communists in the breakaway factions who are opposed 
to Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founder Jose Maria 
Sison have been charged with kidnapping and holdups, 
embezzlement, corruption of comrades and gross misrepresentation 
and usurpation of authority. They will be tried in a "people's 
court," the party said yesterday. 
  In a statement, CPP spokesman Gregorio "Comrade Roger" 
Rosal, 
also said the "court" may resort to "extraordinary measures" to 
get the side of Arturo Tabara, Romulo Kintanar, Ricardo Reyes 
and Felimon Lagman. He did not say what those measures would be. 
  It was hinted, however, that the former rebel leaders facing 
charges might themselves be made to face the "people's court." 
  "Alang-alang sa rebolusyonaryong katarungan, hindi tututulan 
ng Partido kung ang hukumang bayan ay gagawa ng mga 
ekstraordinaryong hakbang upang makuha ang panig ng mga akusado 
-- basta't may sapat na mga pananggalang laban sa peligro ng 
pagkakanulo sa kaaway [For the sake of the truth in the 
revolutionary movement, the Party will not object if the 
`people's court' will take extraordinary measures to get the 
side of the accused -- as long as there is sufficient basis of 
threat from the enemies]," Rosal said. 
  He also said the Party was not in a hurry to proceed with 
the 
trial. "Alam namin ang maraming malalaking gawain at maraming 
limitasyong hinaharap ngayon ng mga kasama sa rebolusyonaryong 
kilusan. Ang mahalaga ay maitala nang buong linaw ang 
malalaking kriminal na pananagutan nina Reyes, Tabara, Kintanar 
at Lagman at ilantad sila upang hindi makapanlinlang [We know 
that there are more important things to do at this moment and 
the members in the movement face some limitations. But, what is 
important is that it will be clearly put on record the criminal 
offenses of Reyes, Tabara, Kintanar and Lagman, so that they can 
no longer beguile any one else]," Rosal said. 
  Amid the most serious rift to hit the rebel movement in 20 
years, the National Democratic Front (NDF) held a "reception" 
last Sunday at The Netherlands to celebrate the 25th anniversary 
of the New People's Army (NPA) and the 21st anniversary of the 
NDF. 
  A statement from the NDF leadership in Utrecht said more 
than 
100 took part in the celebration, along with guests from Japan, 
Indonesia, India, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands , the United 
States as well as a "big number of Filipinos residing in The 
Netherlands." 
  Despite Philippine government pronouncements that the 
leftist 
rebellion has been all but defeated, Sison declared that the 
Philippine revolution holds a "bright future." The ongoing 
"rectification movement" that involves the purging of rebels who 
refuse to toe the party line was deemed by Sison to be necessary 
in "ensuring the steady advance and victory of the revolutionary 
movement" 
  The "Democratic Bloc," the group formed by former comrades 
of 
Sison who now oppose him, recently announced that members and 
leaders of sectoral organizations affiliated with the NDF have 
joined the anti-Sison faction. 
  Yesterday, however, a statement from Reverend Wesley Fiore, 
national spokesperson for the Christians for National Liberation 
(CNL), said Father Felipe Patricio no longer speaks for the 
organization. The CNL, one of the organizations under the NDF, 
said the CPPs organizational problems are its own. The CNL 
represents members of the religious organizations in the 
underground movement. 
  Active rebel members have no business speaking for their 
former comrades who want to avail themselves of the amnesty 
program, Senator Rodolfo Biazon (Laban -- Struggle) yesterday 
said. 
  He issued the statement after conducting a series of public 
hearings where rebel returnees complained that the objections 
raised by rebel leaders to Proclamation No. 347 will deprive 
them of their choice to lead a peaceful life. 
  He said the typical response of former rebels in the regions 
was articulated by one Manuel Raga in Tuguegarao whom he quoted 
as saying: "We are sick and tired of Sison, Jalandoni, Honasan 
and Misuari speaking for us. We have already left their 
movements. All we want is a peaceful life " 
  Proclamation 347 grants amnesty to communist and Muslim 
rebels who may have committed crimes against public order in

  [Text] Tokyo, April 29 KYODO -- New International Trade 
and Industry Minister [MITI] Eijiro Hata has called for 
"comprehensive efforts" to break the trade impasse between Japan 
and the United States. 
  The private sector and the ruling coalition parties, as well 
as government ministries, should make concerted efforts to 
maintain Japan's national interests on the trade front, Hata 
said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE and other news 
organizations Thursday. 
  As a way to improve the current trade situation, the new 
coalition government may need the power of a single influential 
politician, Hata said in an indirect endorsement of the role of 
Ichiro Ozawa, the chief strategist for the government of new 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and his predecessor Morihiro 
Hosokawa. 
  Ozawa is believed to have played a key role in settling the 
Japan-U.S. row over Motorola Inc.'s access to Japan's cellular 
phone market in March. 
  In his first press conference as MITI chief earlier 
Thursday, 
Hata also vowed Tokyo's maximum efforts to use "every trade 
channel, including informal negotiations" to mend the strained 
economic ties between Tokyo and Washington. 
  The trade minister said Japan should take the formation of 
the new cabinet as an opportunity to clarify anew the 
fundamental problems between Tokyo and Washington. 
  "Little time is left (before the July summit of the group of 
seven leading industrialized nations in Naples). But the new 
government should not spare time digging into the core part of 
the current trade wrangling," Hata said. 
  Hata opposed the U.S. demand for numerical targets as a tool 
to gauge the openness of Japan's markets, calling for 
Washington's understanding of Japan's stance against managed 
trade. 
  The trade minister voiced regret over the Social Democratic 
Party's departure from the coalition, due to intracoalition 
feud, immediately after a coalition accord on a policy platform 
was struck. 
  The departure resulted in a ruling minority alliance for the 
new government, the first in Japan in nearly 40 years. 
  Hata called for the socialists to continue respecting a 
coalition accord on key issues, including tax reforms. 
  The platform includes "significantly painful measures" for 
the SDP, but they are "worth being implemented," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 29 KYODO -- Japan, South Korea and the 
United States plan to team up as allies for joint drills in a 
military exercise in June amid international attention focusing 
on how they might deal with North Korea's suspected nuclear arms 
development, Defense Agency [DA] sources said Friday [29 April]. 
  "The new combination is apparently a political message on 
North Korea's suspected nuclear program," one of the sources 
said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. 
  "But it is a short-term and secondary purpose (for the U.S.) 
the long-term target is to establish a security system 
throughout the region, including Southeast Asia, China and 
Russia," the source said. 
  The U.S. Navy has sponsored the so-called "Rim of the 
Pacific 
Exercise" (RIMPAC) joint military maneuver in the north Pacific 
near Hawaii once every two years since 1971 and Japan has taken 
part since 1980. 
  However, Japan has paired up only with the U.S. and this 
year 
will be the first time that another country joins the same team. 
  This year, Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea and the 
U.S. 
will participate in the RIMPAC exercise to be held from the end 
of May to late June. 
  Under the plan, drill participants from Japan's Maritime 
Self-Defense Force, the South Korean navy and the U.S. Navy will 
"fight" against another team consisting of Australian and 
Canadian naval units and some U.S. officers, the sources said. 
  However, the Defense Agency said Japan and South Korea would 
team up separately with the U.S. 
  "There is no possibility that Japan and South Korea, or 
Japan, the U.S. and South Korea, would directly link up and 
drill," a Defense Agency official said. 
  South Korea has joined in RIMPAC since 1990 and this year 
will mark its third participation, but Japan and South Korea 
were on opposite sides in the previous two exercises. 
  The sources said the U.S. drafted this year's team line-up. 
Japan was reluctant to accept the plan, fearing domestic 
criticism, and the U.S. compromised, they said. 
  The compromise allows Japan to explain to the people that 
Japan and South Korea will team up separately with the U.S., 
they said. 
  The exercise has in the past been criticized as a violation 
of Japan's war-renouncing Constitution, which bars Japan from 
resorting to collective security. 
  Defense Agency officials continue to argue that the drill 
aims only at improving defense officers' skills and does not 
violate the Constitution.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 29 KYODO -- Japan's new Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata and some of his key ministers will launch a flurry 
of diplomatic activity next week despite his cabinet's lack of a 
strong power base. 
  Hata inaugurated a minority cabinet Thursday -- the first 
such cabinet in 39 years -- after three weeks of political 
infighting within the ruling coalition. 
  The resultant withdrawal of the Social Democratic Party [of 
Japan -- SDPJ], the largest ally in the coalition, leaves the 
governing body as a minority force in both chambers of the Diet. 
  Despite the bleak outlook for his administration, the prime 
minister will visit Europe during the holiday-studded "golden 
week" while most Japanese are enjoying several days of leisure, 
to make his international debut in Japan's top political post. 
  Hata, who served as foreign minister and concurrently deputy 
prime minister in the cabinet headed by former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, is expected to leave Monday for a six-day 
tour of Italy, France, Germany and the European Union's 
headquarters in Brussels. 
  During the European trip, he aims to start building personal 
relationships with European leaders before attending July summit 
of leaders from the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrial powers 
in Naples, Italy, government sources said. 
  Hata will tell his European counterparts that he will take 
over and develop Hosokawa's economic reform policies, they said. 
  Meanwhile, newly appointed Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 
will visit several Middle East nations between May 2 to 8 to 
promote the Middle East peace process, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  The trip will take Kakizawa to Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Syria 
and the occupied territories. 
  He is scheduled to meet Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Mahmud 
Musa, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres, Jordanian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister 
'Abd- al-Salam al-Majali and Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq 
al-Shar', the officials said. 
  They said the foreign minister may also meet Palestine 
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasir 'Arafat during his trip. 
  For his part, Japan's new Trade Minister Eijiro Hata will 
attend an international conference of economic, industry and 
trade ministers from western industrial nations and East 
European countries to be held May 6-7 in Warsaw. 
  The conference is expected to take up three major topics -- 
investment promotion in Eastern Europe, how to smoothly 
privatize formerly state-owned enterprises, and East-West trade 
promotion, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] said. 
  The Warsaw gathering will be the third of its kind, 
following 
one in Munster in 1992 and another in Tokyo last year. 
  MITI officials said Japan hopes to explore the possibility 
of 
resuming the stalled "framework" trade talks with the United 
States when the minister meets his U.S. counterpart in Warsaw. 
  A top White House official recently said the U.S. would 
welcome the opportunity to resume the talks following the 
installation of a new Japanese Government. 
  Japan hopes to settle its protracted trade dispute with the 
U.S. before the G-7 summit in Naples pledging a second package 
of market- opening measures in June to reduce its huge trade 
surplus with the U.S. 
  The two countries have been unable to resume the trade talks 
that broke down in February over failure to iron out differences 
on "objective criteria" for gauging foreign access to Japanese 
markets. 
  Meanwhile, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii will attend the 
annual conference of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) slated for 
Tuesday through Thursday in Nice, France. 
  On the domestic political front, other coalition leaders are 
expected to devote themselves to canvassing support for the new 
government among reform-oriented legislators of the top 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party and the Social Democratic 
Party, political analysts said. 
  At the first news conference after taking office Thursday, 
Hata said, "Although my administration will face difficult 
times... I will ask the SDP to cooperate with us on whatever 
policies they can, such as the legislation of budget bills." 
  "I will also ask the LDP to cooperate with us, as I believe 
the LDP will also be ready to cooperate on agreed-upon 
policies," he said. "The LDP was once our colleague with whom we 
used to run the government together." 
  However, both the LDP and the SDP immediately rebuffed his 
plea, pointing their fingers at Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
an LDP breakaway, in an apparent reference to the dominance of 
Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa in the policy-making 
process. 
  Despite the bleak political scene, a record 455,000 people 
are expected to leave for trips abroad during the golden week, 
representing a 20.5 percent rise over the same period of 1993, 
the Japan Travel Bureau Inc. (JTB) predicted. 
  Hawaii tops the list of destinations, followed by Hong Kong 
and tourist spots in South Korea.

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata with three </F>
deans of the press corps and unidentified correspondents at the 
prime minister's official residence in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] [Hata] Now, we will open the news conference. 
Before fielding questions at this news conference, I would like 
to say one thing. Former Prime Minister Hosokawa announced his 
resignation on 8 April and I do not want to mention what has 
happened since he made that announcement. I was elected prime 
minister at sessions of both houses of the Diet on 25 April. 
Looking back at the past eight months, I believe that the 
coalition government created a new politics in Japan, and I have 
taken pride in creating such new politics in our nation. 
Therefore, I have called on the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] to join my coalition government and cooperate with 
it. This morning, I met with SDPJ Chairman Murayama and SDPJ 
Secretary General Kubo, but regrettably, we failed to reach an 
agreement on together forming a new coalition government. I 
would like to apologize to the people for delaying the formation 
of my cabinet. In any case, I have now assumed important duties 
as prime minister at this difficult time. What is more, my 
cabinet is a minority coalition government and I anticipate that 
my cabinet will face many difficulties. I think that I and my 
cabinet members will cooperate with each other and do our best 
to move Japan forward. In that sense, I would like to ask all 
of you to give us guidance and understanding. 
  [First dean of the press corps] Mr. Prime Minister. 
  [Hata] Yes? 
  [First dean of the press corps] First, the deans of the 
press 
corps will ask questions, and then other reporters will ask 
their respective questions. I would like to hold this news 
conference that way. As the prime minister just said, it was 
regrettable that the SDPJ broke away from the coalition 
government. With the SDPJ staying out of the coalition 
government, the Hata cabinet will become a minority coalition 
government for the first time in 39 years. I anticipate that 
the Hata cabinet will encounter many difficulties in the future. 
I also anticipate that the Hata cabinet will find it difficult 
to run the Diet, and to get the Diet to pass bills. The 
instability of the Hata government will have an impact on 
Japan's politics and the people's lives. Mr. Prime Minister, I 
would like to ask your resolve, intention, and strategy to cope 
with these difficulties. 
  [Hata] As you just pointed out, with the SDPJ breaking away 
from the coalition government, my cabinet has now become a 
minority coalition government. I believe that my cabinet will 
face many difficulties in the future. With regard to the budget 
for fiscal 1994, when I met with SDPJ Chairman Murayama and the 
secretary general, they said that since they worked with us in 
mapping out the budget draft, they would cooperate with us as 
much as possible from the viewpoint that such cooperation is 
good for our nation. As for the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], 
members of the LDP are my colleagues who ran the government for 
a long time. Our coalition government will be at odds with the 
LDP over some issues. Although the SDPJ quit the coalition 
government, my coalition government will carry out policies on 
the basis of a set of agreements previously reached among the 
ruling coalition parties, and I think that I will be able to ask 
the LDP to cooperate with my coalition government in carrying 
out policies. I will seek such cooperation from the LDP at 
every opportunity. 
  [First dean of the press corps] I have heard that the LDP 
and 
the SDPJ have announced that they would cooperate with each 
other in confronting the coalition government. If those 
opposition parties do as they announced, the coalition 
government can only get the budget to pass in the Diet, but it 
would not be able to do anything without their cooperation. I 
think the coalition government will be reduced to a cabinet 
charged with only handling the budget, and then general 
elections will be held after the House of Representatives is 
dissolved. Mr. Prime Minister, you have taken pains to 
introduce the combined system of proportional representation and 
single-seat constituency while promoting political reform. Mr. 
Prime Minister, do you anticipate a situation where a bill on 
the demarcation of constituencies is shelved and then the House 
of Representatives is dissolved? How are you going to deal with 
such a situation? 
  [Hata] As for your question, during today's meeting, SDPJ 
Chairman Murayama and SDPJ Secretary General Kubo told me the 
SDPJ will not back away from reforms. The Hosokawa coalition 
government initiated the political reform for the first time in 
70 years, and the people have supported the initiative. In the 
past, the SDPJ cooperated with us in promoting political reform 
while overcoming truly painful and tough difficulties. If 
political reform is set back, Japan's politics would be made to 
look ridiculous and there would be no genuine politics in Japan. 
Originally, the Diet was a venue where politicians with varying 
positions held debates. Policy debates are held to move forward 
our nation and people. Many of the LDP members take the view 
that political reform should be promoted. As for the political 
reform bill, almost all LDP members supported it, and the bill 
was passed in the Diet. Given this history, I am convinced I 
will be able to obtain cooperation from each political party in 
getting the bill on reforming the current tax system to pass in 
the Diet. I believe we are not in a situation where the House 
of Representatives needs to be dissolved. 
  [Correspondent] A conclusion will be drawn on how to reform 
the current tax system in June, and I think that reforming the 
current tax system will become the most important task for the 
coalition government. With the SDPJ breaking away from the 
coalition government, however, the ruling coalition parties 
would have difficulty pushing for reform of the current tax 
system. The coalition government also would find it difficult 
to raise the consumption tax. Mr. Prime Minister, how will you 
take political responsibility if and when a bill on reforming 
the current tax system is rejected by the Diet? How are you 
going to cut taxes next year? 
  [Hata] I would like to answer your last question. The ruling 
coalition parties have decided to cut income tax for only one 
year in the course of discussing how to reform the current tax 
system when the Hosokawa government was in power. I believe 
that the people and the coalition partners invariably feel the 
need to continue cutting income tax forever. Cutting income tax 
will incur a fall in the fiscal revenues. The prolonged 
recession has resulted in a fall in fiscal revenues. If the 
income tax continues to be cut, it will cause other major fiscal 
problems. It is impossible to deal with the fiscal deficit by 
issuing deficit-covering bonds. In any case, the budget for 
fiscal 1994 will register a deficit of more than 200 trillion 
yen this summer. While Japan is becoming a senior-citizen 
society, nobody wants taxes increased to deal with such a 
society. When we think that we will have to practice 
responsible politics, we have to discuss how to reform the 
current tax system by the end of June. I think the coalition 
government needs to do its best to get a bill on reforming the 
tax system to pass in the Diet. I would like to refrain from 
predicting whether the bill will be passed or not in the Diet. 
In order to make Japan stable in the future, debates should be 
held on how to increase the people's tax burden. I believe that 
if such debates are not held, the issue of reforming the current 
tax system will be deferred until later. As I said in my 
statement, I intend to seek the people's understanding of the 
need to reform the current tax system while appealing to them. 
I also think I need to indicate to the people that reforming 
the current tax system will improve their lives. 
  [Correspondent] This is not related to the previous 
question. Under the current circumstances in which tension has 
been mounting regarding the issue of suspected DPRK nuclear arms 
development, former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has been 
thinking about Japan's defense and has undertaken efforts to 
have his ideas reflected in the fiscal year 1995 budget during 
informal meetings on defense issues. Mr. Prime Minister, do you 
intend to continue along this line? 
  [Hata] Yes, I do. Regarding this issue, the problem of what 
to do about national security in the post-Cold War era is being 
discussed by people from the private sector in the informal 
meetings which you have mentioned. Broad discussions on the 
entire issue should of course be conducted, but I feel we should 
have second thoughts about deciding to do one thing or another 
without first arriving at a conclusion. In any case, we will 
deal with the issue of the budget while having thorough 
discussions, on the results of which we plan to place great 
emphasis. 
  [Correspondent] Concerning the currently stalled 
Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks, what is your outlook 
regarding resumption of the talks? Do you have any plans toward 
breaking the impasse, such as you yourself visiting the United 
States or sending the foreign minister? 
  [Hata] As for breaking the impasse, I recently held a 
meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in 
Marrakech. We agreed to keep our doors open at all times and 
mutually acknowledged our problems. Therefore, we now plan to 
consider taking advantage of such opportunities to be able to 
always conduct debates in a calm manner. In any case, the 
biggest reason that we started the framework trade talks was the 
fact that Japan had a huge trade surplus. This does not merely 
concern Japanese-U.S. relations, but, for example, it also means 
Japan has a huge current account surplus with the EU and other 
countries. Therefore, when the framework trade talks broke down 
in the early hours of 11 February, I told members of relevant 
government ministries and agencies that this does not mean Japan 
and the United States would do one thing or another because 
matters have been settled, but rather that even though 
negotiations have broken down, Japan, after all, needs to open 
its markets. This is what the Hosokawa administration has 
advocated since its inauguration. Japan should then be 
invigorated in the process, resulting in improving the 
livelihood of the Japanese people. Therefore, we should take 
the initiative to carry this out. It has been decided that we 
will include in the outline of the economic reform, which was 
announced on 29 March, plans designed to ease or remove the 
government regulations in June and plans to form a committee on 
administrative reform that would include members from the 
private sector. In the process of carrying out such plans, we 
must of course hold discussions with the United States. The 
time is not right for me to visit the United States. Anyhow, I 
would like to study this in the future. After all, Japan and 
the United States must understand each other regarding economic 
issues. The two nations have been cooperating on political and 
security issues and global issues, such as the environment and 
AIDS. However, if they fail to get along on economic issues, 
the peoples of both nations will become frustrated. The 
exchange of harsh words between the two nations have given rise 
to anti-American or anti-Japanese sentiments in the past as 
well. Therefore, no matter how well the two nations may seem to 
be getting along, we feel it is necessary to promptly work 
toward bringing about a situation where both nations can 
cooperate with each other regarding economic ties. This will 
not only be beneficial to our nation, but it should also serve 
to indicate one possible direction to the peoples of other 
countries of the world, who are anxiously watching the 
situation. I would also like to confirm that what Japan and the 
United States talk about will not only be beneficial for the two 
nations, but that the results of such talks should be spread 
equally among other countries of the world. 
  [Correspondent] Regarding the situation on the Korean 
peninsula, I think it is basically understood that the issue 
would be settled through dialogue. However, when U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry visited Japan recently, he indicated the 
possibility of imposing sanctions against the DPRK through 
multilateral efforts under a framework other than the United 
Nations in case this cannot be carried out by the United 
Nations. Do you intend to endorse this idea? 
  [Hata] Regarding this issue, as you may now be well 
aware, I regret to say it has been reported to the United 
Nations that the International Atomic Energy Agency was unable 
to conduct a thorough inspection. Even under such 
circumstances, the United Nations discussed the matter primarily 
within the UN Security Council. It decided that, at this stage, 
instead of adopting a resolution for imposing sanctions or other 
measures, it would issue a statement urging the DPRK to first of 
all allow thorough inspections of its nuclear facilities and 
calling on both the DRPK and the ROK to exchange special envoys 
and declare the Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons. 
Therefore, I believe that at this time, it is of utmost 
importance that we ask the DPRK to respond to the international 
community and open its heart to erase such suspicions. For this 
reason, we naturally would like to continue urging other nations 
to try to maintain holding adequate talks with the DPRK. 
Generally speaking, however, if the United Nations makes a 
certain decision, I feel Japan should offer to cooperate within 
the limits of the Constitution. Regarding the last part of your 
question, this is not the appropriate time to discuss such an 
issue. 
  [Correspondent] In that connection, regarding the revision 
of 
laws within the framework of the Constitution in case of 
emergencies, to what extent do you intend to deal with the issue 
of enacting emergency legislation? 
  [Hata] This does not concern only the issue of DPRK's 
suspected nuclear arms development. There naturally may be 
discussion of issues such as our country's security and 
stability or contingency plans in the event that something 
should happen. At this time, however, we have no plans about 
what to do immediately in such a case. 
  [Correspondent] That concludes questions by the deans of the 
press corps. Other correspondents may feel free to ask 
questions now. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister. 
  [Hata] Go ahead. 
  [Correspondent] Regarding the formation of a unified 
parliamentary group which triggered the breakup of the 
coalition, we feel that was a very clever move. We also believe 
that it runs counter to the political stance you have taken thus 
far. Were you not able to restrain such moves after you became 
prime minister and were you not angered by them? Can you tell 
us about this? 
  [Hata] Concerning this problem, I have frankly told members 
of the SDPJ that I regret that this has happened after they had 
cast their votes for me, particularly when I was in the midst of 
selecting cabinet ministers. Since there are many parties in 
the coalition alliance, I have always felt it would be better if 
there could be improved mobility in dealing with various 
problems and if everyone could conduct debates in as few places 
as possible. Frankly speaking, however, I did not know it had 
gone this far. At the time I learned about it, I was in the 
midst of carrying out official duties instead of being involved 
with the affairs of my party. In that sense, there was a 
problem. However, by the time I heard about it, I was told that 
the SDPJ had already approved of the idea, and that Komeito 
[Clean Government Party], too, had approved it. Moreover, there 
were rumors at that time that the SDPJ would be joining the 
upper house parliamentary group Shin Ryokufukai. Under such 
circumstances, I felt at that instant that it was wonderful that 
things were proceeding so smoothly. In reality, however, as 
talks proceeded, I became aware that there were 
misunderstandings. I regret to say that by that time, things had 
already gone too far. Regarding this point, I felt it necessary 
to make sincere apologies to the SDPJ, and that is exactly what 
I tried to convey to the SDPJ today. 
  [Correspondent] In that regard, I believe a lot of public 
confidence in the political system was lost due to such 
falterings. What do you intend to do to regain the people's 
confidence? 
  [Hata] All right. Concerning this point -- naturally it 
must be about the fact that this is a coalition government. 
Frankly speaking, I feel the difficulties facing a coalition 
government have been exposed. However, I do not feel that those 
who came up with ideas or put their ideas into action did so 
with evil intentions. I wonder why talks could not have been 
held in such a manner that everyone could understand each other 
within the framework I have mentioned earlier. On this point, I 
have made sincere apologies to the SDPJ, as I already mentioned. 
Therefore, such misunderstandings should be avoided from now 
on, although people always have misgivings about many things. 
Being obsessed with something can often lead a person to make 
mistakes. Regarding such points, it is thus necessary to create 
an environment in which frank discussion can be held, 
particularly in case of a unified parliamentary group. It is 
more so when it comes to supporting a minority government. In 
that sense, I strongly feel we need to strive harder to create a 
place for conveying our thoughts to each other. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister. 
  [Hata] Go ahead. 
  [Correspondent] It seems Sakigake [Harbinger Party] and the 
SDPJ pulled out from the coalition alliance because of the 
ruling coalition parties' decision-making process. In the 
future, do you have any plans to reconsider the current 
decision-making process centering around the party 
representatives' caucus, or do you have any new plans to replace 
this process? 
  [Hata] Well, it is true that we disagreed during the 
process of reaching policy agreement. However, I think we felt 
we disagreed because we had candid arguments expressing what 
each party or individual felt. Those who, we thought, were at 
loggerheads with each other, were beginning to form fiduciary 
relations or friendships among themselves. It is true that we 
were not in accord. However, I think it appeared very clear to 
the people what we were arguing about. Every one of us has a 
different background and different beliefs. Therefore, it was 
natural for us to argue with each other. After the arguments, 
however, we felt for sure that we could find a new direction. 
We are all politicians who are responsible for guiding the 
country. I strongly felt that I had to do what I had to do even 
at the risk of sacrificing my private feelings 
  When I was talking with American officials, they told me 
that 
they had frequent arguments with European and Canadian 
officials. They told me not to take it too seriously even if I 
had heated discussions with others. Despite heated discussions, 
they mutually feel friendship when they meet next time. 
Therefore, I think it is important to have freer arguments. 
  [Correspondent] The coalition became a minority immediately 
you were elected for the post of premier. I think the people 
remain unconvinced of the fact that your administration is 
supported by the minority coalition. I think many people feel 
it is a matter of course for your administration to dissolve the 
cabinet immediately after approving the budget, and to seek the 
judgment of the people. What do you think of such an opinion? 
  [Hata] As I have been explaining, the discord was created by 
mutual misunderstanding. When I met them, I told SDPJ Chairman 
Murayama and Secretary General Kubo that we still have not given 
up hope of having the SDPJ in the coalition again. 
  We mutually crossed the barriers and cooperated with each 
other during the past eight months. The SDPJ was not the only 
party who made compromises. We made concessions too. We are 
beginning to use words which we hardly ever used when we were 
members of the Liberal Democratic Party. For example, a company 
building becomes big as the company grows bigger. However, its 
employees may still spend two hours or two and a half hours, or 
some people many spend four or five hours, for commuting. Among 
other things, we realize that we have to deal with such issues. 
  Therefore, needless to say, our door is still open as I told 
the SDPJ leaders today. I told them we will continue our 
efforts to help them understand us better. I also told them we 
will continue our efforts to form a new coalition. We will not 
carry out state affairs by taking the decision, which we have 
been discussing, as the final conclusion. We would prefer to 
try to seek a chance to join hands once again. 
  As I look back at the things that have happened during the 
past eight months, it is true that we did some things which 
angered the SDPJ. However, we need to forthrightly apologize to 
the SDPJ for the mistakes we made, and to realize the 
significance of the coalition we had in the past eight months. 
We also should realize that Japan's new course is about to be 
formed as a result of our mutual concessions. While explaining 
this point, we will try to assume a stance which will enable us 
to somehow gain cooperation from the SDPJ. For that purpose, I 
will do my best. 
  [Correspondent] Certainly, the formation of the 
parliamentary group "Kaishin" helped lead to the departure of 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan from the coalition. But 
this was only one reason. For the past eight months, the SDPJ's 
distrust of other coalition partners has deepened, and the 
formation of Kaishin made the party decide to secede from the 
coalition. This is what SDPJ members and many people have said. 
Thus, I believe differences in opinion on the formation of the 
parliamentary group are not the only reason that the SDPJ had to 
secede from the coalition and the Hata cabinet has become a 
minority ruling government. There were many cases in the past 
in which the SDPJ and other coalition partners failed to reach 
an agreement. I think the coalition government should have a 
sense of remorse about this. 
  [Hata] We have a sense of remorse over our acts. But I do 
not think that we failed to reach an agreement on everything. 
Among SDPJ members who have agreed to support the coalition 
government, some are very angry about the formation of Kaishin. 
We should take this fact seriously. We have to reflect on this 
fact. We have faced many difficult issues for the past eight 
months. When we faced these difficulties, strong leadership was 
required to overcome them. SDPJ Secretary General Kubo said 
that it was very tough to tide over one problem -- the 
difficulty of achieving tax reform -- after all of the other 
difficulties. I fully understand his comment. I think it is 
important that while reflecting on past mistakes, we should 
create an environment wherein decisions can be made through 
negotiations. I still have not given up. We have achieved many 
things in the past eight months, although it was a very short 
period. This will be historically acclaimed in the future. I 
believe other people also think this way. 
  [Correspondent] In describing your relations with Shinseito 
Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, you recently said that Ozawa is 
the person who draws up scenarios and you are the one who acts 
on them. Mr. Ozawa commented on the formation of the new cabinet 
this afternoon, saying [words indistinct]. Does this division 
of roles still exist? Or since you have become the prime 
minister, will you draw up scenarios by yourself? 
  [Hata] Maybe because of the news media's access to a large 
amount of information, you all tend to report as truthful 
everything people say, as if their statements were always a 
reflection of reality. When I was asked by correspondents about 
my relations with Ozawa at a time I was about to ride on a 
bullet train after canvassing, I told them that you cannot do 
things by yourself. You can draw up scenarios, but actors do 
not always act on scenarios. Actors may choose their favorite 
scenarios and sometimes ask writers to rewrite them. I said 
this to them. It seems that you have taken what I carelessly 
said the wrong way. 
  At least, I have been in the political world for 25 years 
and have been faced with problems in completely different 
fields. I have had much experience with role-playing based on 
scenarios of my own design. 
  When I was foreign minister, I could not do anything but 
attend to my official duties. You must have someone to take 
care of party affairs. My relations with Ozawa are something 
like that. Somebody said that I consulted with him over the 
issue of the cabinet lineup. In former times, a prime minister, 
when forming his cabinet, always consulted with the party 
secretary general. You cannot do things by yourself. A rumor 
has it that we yelled at each other in a bathroom. We did not 
do any such thing. However, since we have been friends for 25 
years, we can actually help each other by yelling at each other. 
He does not interfere with the things I do. On other occasions, 
he may ask me to help him out. I would like you to understand 
that our relations are like this. 
  [Correspondent] The new cabinet is supported by a minority 
ruling coalition, and you yourself said earlier that the 
situation was very severe for you. Some of the people are 
worried that your administration may be short-lived. How would 
you respond to that? 
  [Hata] Well, I do not believe that people are saying that. 
I know the news media have said that the new cabinet will not 
last long. Anyway, if we steadily implement our policies, and 
if the people think what we are doing is right, we will be able 
to gain the people's understanding. At the same time, I 
strongly hope to create circumstances in which the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan can agree on our policies and 
cooperate with us in carrying them out. 
  [Correspondent] I have the feeling that because the SDPJ 
left the coalition, the Hata cabinet might take the same 
political stance as the Liberal Democratic Party. Could you 
explain differences between the Hata government's political 
techniques and styles and those adopted by the LDP-led 
governments of the past? 
  [Hata] The coalition is composed of Komeito, the Democratic 
Socialist Party, and other parties which were opposition parties 
eight months ago. Therefore, it is impossible for us to adopt 
the same political stance as the LDP did when it was in power. 
I want to stress that the coalition government, established 
eight months ago, was the first such government in 38 years. 
Under the Hosokawa coalition government, I had to make hasty 
decisions in time for deadlines set to deal with various issues. 
At that time, I was criticized as being high-handed and hard on 
others. I think that as the coalition government gradually 
matures, we will begin to respect others' opinions and styles, 
to compromise with each other, and to seek new things. In 
short, we will begin to seek new measures to improve the living 
standards of the people. As I said earlier, the Hosokawa 
coalition government began to pay attention to issues concerning 
the environment and working people, which the LDP did not. I 
think this is the result of our 8-month-long learning process, 
and I evaluate this highly. 
  [Correspondent] What will be the priority tasks to be 
tackled by the Hata government? I am sure there are many urgent 
tasks. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, what tasks will your 
coalition government emphasize? 
  [Hata] The political reform bill was passed in the Diet, and 
it is necessary to establish the major elements of political 
reform. We need to do that. I think that one of the coalition 
government's major tasks is to create a new political system in 
Japan. Although it is said that Japan's economy is now showing 
some signs of recovery, its recovery is not certain. Looking at 
the unemployment rate, we cannot be optimistic about the 
economic recovery. Japan's politics and enterprises are doing 
something to help foster economic recovery. I believe the 
coalition government is now expected to abolish or ease 
regulations, promote administrative reform, and establish an 
open information system. Therefore, the coalition government 
will have to work on those issues. As I said just a while ago, 
the coalition government will have to work on addressing the 
issue of the ratio of direct to indirect taxes in total tax 
revenues. The coalition government will also have to work on 
cutting the income tax while pursuing a welfare policy. The 
coalition government will have to upgrade the current social 
structure to prepare for a society of senior citizens. The 
coalition government has those tasks. I believe that it is 
important to make known the current situation to the people and 
ask them to share burdens to deal with the issues. What I 
realized while serving as finance minister and foreign minister 
is that all of the nations of the world -- including 
industrialized nations, nations in transition from planned 
economies to capitalist economies, developing countries trying 
to take off, and other developing countries -- pin high 
expectations on Japan. They do not expect only money from 
Japan. They ask Japan to transfer technology and other know-how 
and cooperate with them in other fields. Japan should make 
international contributions in response to other countries' 
requests. Japan should also help with the reconstruction of 
war-ravaged nations and provide aid to nations plagued by 
conflict. This is what the outside world expects from Japan. I 
believe that if Japan fails to play a proper role in the world 
and make international contributions, it will be impossible for 
the nation to further develop itself. I think that those are 
tasks the coalition government should take on in the future. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, on the day when former 
Prime Minister Hosokawa announced his resignation, you asked 
what Japan will be like and said that you were fretting about 
Japan's future. What sort of message does the coalition 
government intend to send to the rest of the world? 
  [Hata] As I stated briefly a while ago, I intend to help the 
international community understand that Japan is an open nation. 
At the same time, Japan inflicted mental wounds on people in 
many nations during the past war, and some of those people lost 
their lives. I believe that Japan must engage in candid 
soul-searching regarding what it did to those people. Japan has 
so far followed the path of peace while engaging in such 
soul-searching. All nations of the world have understood what 
Japan has done, and they have supplied Japan with resources 
while seeking manufactured goods from our country. Japan has 
become the industrialized nation it is thanks to their 
cooperation. Japan would not have been able to become the 
industrialized nation it is if all the nations of the world had 
not understood our country. As I said a while ago, Japan should 
aggressively provide aid to developing countries and other 
nations trying to transform themselves. I believe that Japan is 
being asked to make clear that it intends to make international 
contributions toward world peace. 
  [Correspondent] Last year, the ruling coalition parties 
succeeded in seizing power from the LDP because of their 
cohesion. This time, however, the ruling coalition parties 
succeeded in remaining in power despite their minority role in 
the Diet. Mr. Prime Minister, what do you think of this 
contradiction? 
  [Hata] The SDPJ broke away from the coalition government 
over the issue of forming a parliamentary group. SDPJ Chairman 
Murayama and SDPJ Secretary General Kubo told me that the SDPJ 
will cooperate with the coalition government in dealing with 
such issues as political reform and the budget. As I said at 
the outset of this news conference, the LDP supported the 
coalition government on major policies in the Diet. Looking 
back at various things that have taken place in the past, I am 
convinced that when I strive for the sake of our nation to 
transcend the power struggle and I work to move our nation 
forward, the SDPJ and the LDP will cooperate with me.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- The office of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Friday [22 April] Hosokawa has 
failed to report investment profits of 29 million yen but denied 
there was any illegality. 
  Hosokawa made a surprise announcement of his intention to 
resign April 8 to take "moral and political responsibility" for 
a fresh financial scandal and the current stalemate in the Diet. 
  "A new problem has come to light. New suspicions emerged 
that my political office entrusted a certain person with 
managing my personal financial means, raking in profits for a 
few years since 1981," the premier said. 
  "The suspicion is that his management may have involved some 
illegalities, although the person, who is my old friend, asked 
for permission to manage my personal money, saying it would 
definitely be invested in a profitable manner," he said. 
  On April 13, a former publisher of an economic magazine, to 
whom Hosokawa entrusted the funds, told reporters that Hosokawa 
lied about the investments in his resignation announcement. 
  Yusei Kuwahata, 60, said at a news conference, "Hosokawa's 
office made me out to be like a criminal, using me as a tool to 
make Prime Minister Hosokawa look clean." 
  From around 1981 to 1985, Kuwahata invested Hosokawa's funds 
and made profits for Hosokawa of 20 to 30 million yen, according 
to Kuwahata. 
  Kuwahata denied any illegality in his use of the funds in 
spite of Hosokawa citing "new suspicions" over the legality of 
his financial deals as one of the reasons for his resignation. 
  He said he did not invest the funds on the black market.

  [Text] Kofu, April 23 KYODO -- Yamanashi Prefecture decided 
Saturday [23 April] to bar 508 construction firms from bids for 
prefectural construction works for two to three months beginning 
Sunday as a punitive action against their alleged involvement in 
bid-rigging, prefectural officials said. 
  The number of firms to be disqualified as a tender is the 
majority of the 564 companies affiliated with construction trade 
associations in the prefecture, they said. 
  As a result, the prefecture will be unable to call for bids 
for public works for two or three months, they said. 
  Cities, towns and villages in the central Japan prefecture 
may follow suit, the officials said. 
  Among the 508 firms, 422 cannot join tenders for two months 
and 86 for three months, they said. 
  The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) on April 8 asked all the 
eight construction trade associations in the prefecture to stop 
rigging bids for Yamanashi Prefecture's construction works, 
saying the organizations have systematically conducted such 
activities for 10 years. 
  The trade associations told the FTC on Thursday that they 
have accepted the advice. The FTC will calculate fines and 
impose them on member firms, FTC officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 23 KYODO -- The Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC) have searched branch offices of four major shutter makers 
suspected of operating a cartel, sources within the commission 
said Saturday [23 April]. 
  The offices, in Hiroshima Prefecture in western Japan, were 
checked to see if they were operating a cartel over private 
construction projects there, the sources said. 
  The four makers -- Sanwa Shutter Corp., Bunka Shutter Co., 
Suzuki Shutter Mfg Co. and Toyo Shutter Co. -- are suspected of 
conducting prearranged bidding and making secret price 
arrangements for construction projects in the prefecture for the 
past several years. 
  The FTC suspects the four makers of violating the 
antimonopoly law. It is also investigating branches of the four 
firms in other regions over suspected similar illegal 
activities, the sources said. 
  The head of the general affairs department of Toyo Shutter 
said the FTC made an inspection of its Hiroshima branch in 
January or February this year, but denied it was involved in 
forming cartels. 
  The four companies account for about 80 percent of the total 
sales of shutters in Japan, industry sources said. 
  Sanwa, Bunka and Suzuki are based in Tokyo and Toyo is based 
in Osaka.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- The International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) underestimated the Japanese economy in its recent 
economic outlook, a senior Economic Planning Agency (EPA) 
official said Friday [22 April]. 
  Tsutomu Tanaka, the EPA's vice minister, said the IMF did 
not 
sufficiently take into account the effects of Japan's economic 
stimulus package and signs of recovery seen lately in 
consumption. 
  "It is difficult to understand why the IMF revised down its 
projection for Japanese economy from the previous outlook issued 
lastfall," Tanaka said. 
  The IMF issued an outlook for world economy earlier this 
week, saying Japan's economy is expected to stay sluggish in 
1994, with the annual growth rate remaining weak at 0.7 percent, 
revised down from a 2.0 percent growth forecast by itself last 
September. 
  Asked about a drop in the nation's February household 
spending, Tanaka admitted that the recovery is not yet strong. 
  "Because the recovery momentum is still weak, it is easily 
affected by such things as unfavorable weather," he said. 
  On Thursday, the government announced the February household 
spending dropped by 0.5 percent from a year earlier, ending a 
four- month streak of rise on year. It attributed the drop 
partly to snowfalls that prevented consumers from shopping.

  The federation also urged the government to take positive 
economic measures, including an increase of investment on public 
works projects by more than 100 trillion yen over the next 
decade. 
  It said the appeal was contained in a proposal timed to Hata 
becoming prime minister in place of Morihiro Hosokawa who 
stepped down over questions about financial impropriety. 
  The proposal also called for early enactment of the fiscal 
1994 budget which is up for parliamentary approval and 
readjusting the yen's exchange rates against other currencies at 
optimum levels. 
  The proposal also expressed hope that the government will 
take action to remove economic frictions with the United States 
and other countries to overcome the recession. 
  The federation also urged the government to reduce income 
and 
corporate taxes by reforming the tax system and carrying out 
thorough deregulation in real estate transactions, housing, 
communication and information, and distribution sectors.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Domestic production of 
cars, trucks and buses fell in fiscal 1993 for the third year in 
a row, slipping 12.0 percent to 10,849,827 vehicles for the 
biggest fall in nearly 50 years, the Japan Automobile 
Manufacturers Association said Monday [25 April]. 
  It is the first time in the postwar period for the nation's 
four- wheel vehicle production to fall for three straight years, 
association officials said. 
  The latest annual fall was the largest since fiscal 1947, 
when domestic auto output took an 18.9 percent tumble, they said. 
  The three-year string of declines was produced by a 
prolonged 
auto market slump at home against the backdrop of the worst 
recession in decades. 
  For the fiscal year that ended March 31, production of 
passenger cars fell 11.8 percent to 8,199.790 as weak output of 
small cars offset a gain in larger cars. 
  Production of "compact" cars, or those with engine 
displacement below 2000 cc, shrank 20.0 percent to 4,826,387. 
  Output of cars with engines of more than 2000 cc rose 4.3 
percent to 2,587,133, underlining the shift to such models away 
from compact cars. 
  Production of trucks declined 12.7 percent to 2,603,190, 
while output of buses went down 11.8 percent to 46,847. 
  For March alone, domestic automobile production fell 9.4 
percent from a year earlier to 1,054,608 vehicles for the 18th 
straight month of decline, the association said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 29 KYODO -- Japanese workers' average 
monthly wages showed the first year-on-year decline in 13 years 
in fiscal 1993, though a scant 0.1 percent, while annual working 
hours also declined by 50 hours, the government said Friday [29 
April]. 
  The Labor Ministry said in a report on the nation's labor 
situation for the year ended March 31 that average monthly basic 
salaries of workers at companies with 30 employees and more 
increased 2.7 percent from the year before to 272,743 yen. 
  But special allowances, including bonuses, declined 1.6 
percent to 106,594 yen per month, reflecting the sluggish 
business climate. 
  Payments for overtime work also dropped 5.6 percent to 
21,957 
yen per month as companies cut back overtime hours during the 
recession. 
  As a result, workers' total monthly wages averaged 401,294 
yen, up 1.0 percent from the year before. The ministry said the 
increase is the lowest since it started such a survey in fiscal 
1970. 
  Taking into account the 1.1 percent consumer price hike in 
fiscal 1993, monthly average wages showed a 0.1 percent decline 
in real terms, it said. 
  Regarding working hours, the ministry said annual regular 
working hours in Japan averaged 1,777 per worker in the year, 
down 37 hours from the year before. 
  Overtime hours averaged 131 for the year, down 13 hours. 
  In total, annual working hours came to 1,908 per person, 
down 
50 hours from the year before, the ministry said. 
  The government has long promoted a reduction of Japan's 
notoriously long annual working hours to 1,800. 
  In fiscal 1992, annual working hours declined by 50 to 
1,958, 
with regular hours dropping by 24 and overtime hours by 26. 
  Compared with the 1992 figures, regular working hours 
declined more than overtime in 1993. 
  A ministry official said the trend was because many 
companies 
reduced their regular hours last year ahead of a planned law 
revision in April requiring a cut in regular working hours to 40 
hours a week.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Labor Minister Chikara 
Sakaguchi said Friday [22 April] local and central governments 
should take a greater role in job training. 
  Job training is focus of a new medium- and long-term program 
to be announced in May, he told reporters. 
  Up to now job training has been provided mainly by 
corporations. Both the central and local governments should 
review ways to take on some of the role in training workers 
along with the private sector, he said. 
  He pointed to the need to study how to deal with job 
training 
at small and medium-sized companies, which account for roughly 
90 percent of all companies in Japan.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Kim Boldokhonov] </F>
  [Text) Ulaanbaatar, 28 Apr -- Setting foot on Mongolian 
ground, I express deep respect for the friendly people of 
Mongolia, Li Peng stated today at Bayant-Uhaa airport. The 
premier of the PRC State Council has arrived in Ulaan Baatar on 
an official visit at the invitation of Puntsaqiyn Jasray, head 
of the Mongolian Government. 
  Over the last two years China and Mongolia have been 
actively 
developing friendly relations and cooperation which corresponds 
not only to the national interests of each country, but also 
assists in strengthening peace and stability in the Asian 
Pacific ocean region, the welcoming message notes. 
  During the visit, talks are to take place between the head 
of 
the Chinese Government and Puntsaqiyn Jasray, there are to be 
meetings with Natsaqiyn Bagabandi, chairman of the Great Hural, 
and with Mongolian President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat. 
  At the outcome of the visit, a treaty is to be signed on 
friendly relations and cooperation between Mongolia and China, 
as well as a number of other bilateral documents. 
  The development of friendly relations with China has been 
and 
will be in the future one of the priorities in our country's 
foreign policy, Mongolian Prime Minister Puntsaqiyn Jasray 
stated today at a dinner in honor of Li Peng, the PRC State 
Council premier, who has arrived in Ulaanbaatar on a visit. The 
treaty on friendly relations and cooperation, which will be 
signed tomorrow, the head of the Mongolian Government said, 
"will open a fresh page in the history of our bilateral ties." 
  "We are certain that we have made the correct choice", 
Jasray 
emphasized, expressing gratitude to China for its support for 
Mongolia in surmounting the difficulties of the transitional 
period and its provision of interest-free credit and 
humanitarian assistance. 
  Despite the fact that in the 45 years since diplomatic 
relations were established, China and Mongolia have experienced 
"zigzags" in their relations, Li Peng said, recent times have 
been characterized by constant contacts between the leaders of 
the two countries and an expansion of ties. The present level 
of Chinese-Mongolian relations, he stressed, "has not been 
easily achieved, and we shall guard and develop them." The 
bilateral treaty, he said, will provide an impetus for further 
development of cooperation and will open up yet broader 
prospects for long-term joint actions. 
  The Chinese people, the PRC State Council premier said, is 
speeding up the process of renewal and implementation of an open 
economic policy, since a stably developing China contributes to 
strengthening the cause of peace and Asia's prosperity.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 27 KYODO -- A China-Mongolia 
treaty to be signed during Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit from 
Thursday [28 April] will include a provision by which the two 
countries vow nonaggression against each other, Mongolian 
diplomatic sources said Wednesday. 
  The sources said that in the China-Mongolia Treaty on 
Friendly Relations and Cooperation, which will replace an 
earlier bilateral treaty dating from 1960, each side will pledge 
not to join military or political groups directed at the other. 
  Nor will they conclude any agreement with a third country 
which threatens the other country's sovereignty or security, 
according to the draft treaty. 
  The treaty, to be signed Friday between Li and Mongolian 
Premier Punsalmaagiyn Jasray, further says that neither country 
will allow a third country to use its territory to threaten the 
sovereignty or security of the other, the sources said. 
  Mongolia normalized ties with China in 1989 after years of 
hosting Soviet forces hostile to China. 
  Li will be arriving in Ulaanbaatar for a two-day visit after 
visiting the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 21 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Mongolia's 
leading political parties today signed a conciliation document 
aimed at overcoming the acute political crisis in the country 
which is in its second week. In the presence of President 
Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat, leaders of the three parliamentary 
parties -- the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the 
Mongolian National Democratic Party, and the Mongolian Social 
Democratic Party -- signed the document. 
  The document, called `Political Consensus', stipulates in 
particular that at its spring and fall sessions parliament 
should adopt laws on public rallies and demonstrations, on free 
speech, freedom of the media, on the moral code of officials, 
and on fighting corruption. 
  The present crisis broke out 13 April after the Mongolian 
Democratic Union and a number of other opposition parties 
started mass actions in support of their demands for the 
government's resignation. They insisted that its socioeconomic 
program has failed and that it is unable to lead the country out 
of the crisis. They also called on the law enforcement agencies 
to urgently investigate all the accusations of corruption and 
abuse of power made against top officials. 
  Representatives of the opposition continue their hunger 
strike on the capital's central square until their demands are 
met. Supporters of the present government have also staged their 
own hunger strike. They have already refused food for six days 
now and state that they will end their hunger strike only after 
the opposition does the same. 
  At the same time, the conflicting sides continue their mass 
rallies. `Free microphones' are installed in the public places 
for all those wishing to express their opinions on the issues 
they are concerned about.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 23 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- About 5,000 
people marched through the Mongolian capital's central streets 
today, chanting slogans demanding the government's resignation 
and the dissolution of parliament. Then the demonstrators 
assembled on a city square to give moral support to Mongolian 
opposition members who have been on a hunger strike for 11 
consecutive days. Following the hospitalization of several 
hunger strikers, 34 of them now remain. The opposition forces 
intend to use the hunger strike to compel the government to 
resign. Accusations of official corruption and discontent with 
government policy in spheres such as social welfare, education, 
and agriculture have served as the formal pretext for the 
protests. 
  No serious incidents occurred, with the exception of 
attempts 
by government supporters to use smoke bombs and firecrackers to 
hinder the demonstration. The security forces monitored 
[kontrolirovali] the situation, observed the demonstrators from 
afar and did not intervene in the events. 
  The country's President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat had a meeting 
with the hunger strikers several days ago. However, the hunger 
strikers, who were joined by former Vice President 
Radnaasumbereliyn Gonchigdorj, refused to stop their action in 
spite of attempts at persuasion. They say they will strike 
until the government agrees to make concessions.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 24 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The center of the 
Mongolian capital today witnessed a major antigovernment 
demonstration for the second day running. According to various 
sources, between 3,000 and 5,000 citizens took part in it. The 
demonstrators, chanting slogans demanding the resignation of the 
Cabinet of Prime Minister [Puntsaqiyn] Jasray, have blocked the 
entrances to the building where the government is sitting. In 
view of the peaceful nature of the demonstration, the security 
forces units that came to the square have not interfered. 
  The latest demonstration in central Ulaanbaatar has become 
yet another move in the campaign of pressure exerted by the 
opposition on the government which its opponents call "corrupt." 
Active protests began two weeks ago when several dozens of 
mainly young Mongols went on a hunger strike, not expecting, 
according to them, to achieve their aim -- to make the 
government surrender -- by other means. However, while the 
conflict developed those on a hunger strike inclined toward a 
compromise, trying to achieve not the resignation of, but only a 
meeting with, the prime minister. They also want to receive 
from the government a document promising to carry out effective 
socioeconomic reforms. Among the demands is the need for 
decisive measures in the fight against crime and inadmissibility 
of the further impoverishment of the population. 
  According to Jasray, head of the Mongolian Government, he 
has 
no reason to resign. Meanwhile, an official investigation has 
been started into the accusations of corruption made by the 
opposition. Mongolian legislators appeared alongside government 
officials in them. Competent bodies promise to finish the 
investigation within two weeks.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 25 Apr -- The hunger strike that was 
maintained for two weeks in the center of the Mongolian capital 
by representatives of opposition parties calling for the 
government's resignation ended today. This development follows 
Mongolian Prime Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray's refusal to sign 
with the activists the document they had insisted upon. At his 
meeting with the hunger strikers he justified his refusal by 
saying that neither the country's Constitution nor the law on 
government contained any provisions about prior conclusion of 
agreements with individuals or organizations on the resignation 
of the cabinet of ministers. 
  The prime minister urged the hunger strikers to respect the 
stand taken by the president, the recommendations brought by the 
National Security Council, and the decision passed by 
parliament, who all asked them to end their action. 
  At the same time the government pledged to take into 
consideration a number of demands issued by the hunger strikers. 
Laws on press freedom and on the struggle against corruption are 
to be drafted in the near future.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
staged an air war exercise against the North Monday in the skies 
above Umsong, Tokjok Islet, Wonju and Yongwol, South Korea, with 
Pacific-based U.S. fighters and some 200 fighter-bombers, 
assault planes, observation planes and helicopter gunships 
belonging to the U.S. Air Force in South Korea and the puppet 
airforce under the command of an E-3 early warning plane, 
military sources said. 
  On the same day, the South Korean puppets held a firing 
exercise and a helicopter operation exercise as part of the 
Hwarang war exercise in a frontline area adjacent to the 
Demilitarized Zone along the Military Demarcation Line. 
  The premeditated military provocations are rendering the 
situation on the Korean peninsula more strained. 
  If the United States and the South Korean rulers 
continuously 
reinforce their aggression forces and unleash a nuclear war on 
the Korean peninsula, the provokers will never get off scotfree.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- The scheme to 
reinforce the Armed Forces in South Korea, on top of tens of 
thousands of U.S. troops and up-to-date means of war deployed 
there, shows that the United States has not abandoned its 
intention to stifle the DPRK by military strength, taking issue 
with the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, says NODONG 
SINMUN in a commentary today. Noting that the United States is 
reinforcing the aggression forces in South Korea, crying for 
"the increase of the capability of the U.S. forces in South 
Korea to counter a surprise attack by North Korea," the analyst 
says: 
  The U.S. seeks to find an excuse to pursue the policy of 
stifling the DPRK in kicking up a dust over the non-existent 
"nuclear issue" of the DPRK. 
  The U.S. Forces in South Korea and in Japan are the main 
lever in executing its Asia-Pacific policy. U.S. arms buildup 
in South Korea is motivated by the strategic aim to strengthen 
its domination over Asia and the Pacific with force. 
  "North Korea's surprise attack" advertised by the United 
States is nothing but a sophism to justify arms buildup in South 
Korea. 
  The United States' reinforcement of armament in South Korea 
poses a serious threat to the peace and security of the Korean 
peninsula and the Asian-Pacific region. 
  The United States must stop arms buildup in South Korea, not 
ignoring the desire of the people in this region for 
independence and peace.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- Khalequzzaman Bhuiyan, 
convenor of the Central Committee of the Socialist Party of 
Bangladesh, in a statement April 7 charged that the United 
States was spreading a false propaganda without any evidence of 
"nuclear arms development" by the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea and using the International Atomic Energy Agency and 
the United Nations for the purpose. 
  "It is an anachronistic dream to try to stifle socialist 
Korea and establish `domination' over the world with nuclear 
weapons", he said, urging the United States to withdraw its 
forces from South Korea. 
  The Action Front of Malaysia in a protest letter to Kim 
Yong-sam on April 19 wrote that "development of nuclear weapons" 
by North Korea was, in actuality, a false propaganda invented by 
the West and that the South Korean authorities must not play 
into the hands of the United States which is seeking its 
political interests and hegemonism in Northeast Asia.

<F P=106> ["The United States Must Promptly Renounce Its Hostile </F>
Policy Against the DPRK" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- Foreign political 
parties urged the United States to promptly renounce its hostile 
policy toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at 
isolating and stifling it. 
  Vassalo Anthony Joseph, general secretary of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of Malta, in a letter to the 
president of the UN General Assembly April 3 urged him to show 
deep interest in the resumption of DPRK-USA talks and pay due 
attention to the challenging act of the United States in 
unilaterally foiling the third round of DPRK-USA talks. 
  The letter strongly urged that the United States should 
withdraw all its military hardware including nuclear weapons and 
troops from South Korea and stop any manner of interference in 
the internal affairs of Korea including military action. 
  Amaral Matos, first secretary of the Maputo City Committee 
of 
the Mozambique Liberation Front Party, in a statement April 11 
said the United States could never frighten Korea although it 
was putting unreasonable pressure on it in conspiracy with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  The statement warned that if the United States continue to 
resort to pressure on Korea with an anachronistic daydream, it 
would sustain a more ignominious defeat and meet with 
condemnations from the world people. 
  The Polish League of Communists "Proletariat" in a statement 
April 9 denounced the United States' hostile Korea policy aimed 
at isolating and stifling the DPRK and expressed full support to 
the recent steps taken by the DPRK with regard to the "nuclear 
issue" and to its stand manifested in them.

<F P=106> ["Rude and Inhumane Barbarous Act" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries a commentary hitting out at the South Korean authorities 
for blocking the southern trip of a delegation of the North side 
which had been invited to a memorial service on the one 
hundredth day after the death of the Rev. Mun Ik-hwan. 
  Recalling that the Rev. Mun was a pioneer of the 
reunification movement who fought till the last moments of his 
life for the reunification of the country, the common cause of 
the nation, and a highly reputed patriotic champion of 
reunification widely known to the compatriots at home and 
abroad, the analyst says: 
  The South Korean rulers had barred a mourners' group of the 
North side from going to Seoul to express condolences at the 
bier of the Rev. Mun in January and this time blocked the 
southern trip of a delegation of the North side which was to 
attend a memorial service on the one hundredth day since his 
death. This is a very immoral and rude act. 
  The national funeral committee for the late Rev. Mun Ik-hwan 
decided to hold the memorial service on the one hundredth day of 
his death as a national function and invited compatriots in the 
North and overseas. And the North side decided to send a 
delegation out of the noble sense of obligation for the deceased 
and his bereaved family and ardent desire for national unity. 
  Expressing condolences and honoring the memory of the 
deceased is rather a humanitarian matter than a political matter. 
  Such anti-human group of traitors as the Kim Yong-sam group 
which seeks confrontation and war in league with outside forces 
while lowering a checkbar on the Southern trip of fellow 
countrymen for mourning the deceased, must be removed from the 
nation.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 (KNS-KCNA) -- The overseas 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon), an organisation of civil 
reunification movement, published a statement Monday denouncing 
the South Korean rulers for blocking Koreans overseas from 
participating in the memorial service on the one hundredth day 
after the death of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a patriotic fighter for 
reunification. 
  The statement says: 
  "The South side's authorities, still antagonizing 
Pomminnyon, 
barred its delegation from participating in the function. This 
was an insult to the pure heart of condolence of overseas 
Koreans and an unjust act going against the desire of the 70 
million fellow countrymen for reunification. 
  "Today when the United States and other foreign forces are 
deliberately increasing the military tension on the Korean 
peninsula, it is of great significance in hastening national 
reunification for delegates in the North, South and overseas to 
gather in one place to honor the memory of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan who 
passed away while devotedly working for the independence of the 
nation and great unity. 
  "The overseas headquarters of Pomminnyon urges the South 
side's authorities to renounce their hostile policy toward 
Pomminnyon and make efforts to accomplish the cause of 
reunification together with us."

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- Yi Song-ho, acting 
chairman of the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society, 
in a telephone message today to Kang Yong-hun, president of 
South Korean Red Cross, urged the South side to take a 
humanitarian measure for Kim Chi-hyon and her brothers to 
receive medical treatment and have their livelihood protected in 
the North. 
  Kim Chi-hyon, 29, is the eldest daughter of Kim Pyong-chu, a 
soldier of the Korean People's Army who was arrested while 
active in the Jirisan guerrilla force during the Fatherland 
Liberation War and died after being released from prison where 
he had spent long years, refusing to be converted. 
  She had her ribs cut off in an operation, attacked with 
costal tuberculosis, but the inflammation has spread to the 
region of the vertebra. So she is in a critical condition. 
  The telephone message said Kim Chi-hyon has no family and 
relatives who can look after her at sickbed and no patrons who 
can take care of her younger brothers in the South. The only 
way of saving her is to bring her to the northern half of the 
country where free medical care is in force, the message noted, 
and continued: 
  We notify your Red Cross that if there is a problem of 
hospital fees and money for medicine and medical treatment which 
she has not paid yet, we are willing to pay them in her place. 
  The North and the South are in relations of confrontation 
which are abnormal politically and militarily. But 
humanitarianism of Red Cross is a most noble universal idea 
transcending the concept of confronting parties and of friend 
and foe. So we believe your side will accept our proposal with 
good will. 
  We hope your Red Cross will take an appropriate measure so 
that our proposal based on human and compatriotic love may be 
realised at an early date.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- Burundian and 
Mozambican organizations strongly urged the repatriation of old 
Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, unconverted long-term prisoners in 
South Korea, to the northern half of Korea and the release of An 
Hak-sop, an old man. 
  Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan who were soldiers of the Korean 
People's Army during the Korean war served more than 30 years in 
prison, after taken prisoners, for the mere reason that they 
refused to recant their belief. And An Hak-sop is now serving 
in prison for more than 40 years since he was arrested, charged 
with being "a spy of North Korea". 
  The Burundi-Korea Friendship Association and the Burundian 
Group for the Study of the Chuche Idea in a joint protest letter 
to the South Korean authorities April 19 said the repatriation 
of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan and the release of An Hak-sop 
accord with the humanitarian spirit and the UN principles on 
human rights and democracy. 
  The Mozambican committee for friendship with the people of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a statement April 
13 said Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan were living a life worse than 
death in South Korea without any protection, though they are 
sick. It strongly urged an immediate return of the old men who 
want to meet with their dear relatives and friends at home even 
at this late hour of their life. The South Korean authorities 
must know clearly that if they refused to return the old men, 
they would face curses and a stern judgement by the Korean 
people and the world people, warned the statement.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 26 (KCNA)--The South Korean 
authorities, ignoring the unanimous demand of people at home and 
abroad, are persistently refusing to send back to the North Kim 
In-so and Ham Se-hwan who spent long years in prison, 
unconverted, after being taken prisoners during the war. This 
comes under fire in papers here today. 
  The South Korean Red Cross, in a telephone message to the 
North side on April 22, categorically refused their 
repatriation, alleging that they were not prisoners of war, but 
"offenders who killed innocent people" and they "acquired the 
nationality of South Korea of their own accord." 
  A NODONG SINMUN analyst says: 
  This is nothing but a far-fetched argument aimed at evading 
the responsibility for such criminal acts as unjustifiably 
detaining and persecuting them and keeping them in South Korea. 
  As the South Korean authorities kept them in South Korea, 
they had no other choice but to "acquire the nationality of 
South Korea" to eke out existence. If they wanted to remain in 
South Korea, why did they request the International Committee of 
the Red Cross to cooperate in their repatriation? 
  Still more preposterous is the allegation of the South 
Korean 
Red Cross that they are "offenders who killed innocent people." 
They were soldiers of the Korean People's Army and patriots who 
fought against the aggression of outside forces and for the 
peace and reunification of the country in the Fatherland 
Liberation War. 
  Thd assertion of the South Korean Red Cross that they do not 
fall under the category of the POW is a challenge to the 
international law and humanitarian idea and a sophism 
unacceptable to anyone. 
  The lonely old valetudinarian men with not many remain years 
are now maintaining the barest existence with toilsome physical 
labour. It is an humanitarian issue awaiting urgent solution to 
send them back to the North where there are their home towns and 
families and relatives. 
  If the South Korean Red Cross had a shred of national 
conscience and respected the humanitarian idea, it must send 
them back to the North at an early date in compliance with the 
Korean armistice agreement and the international law on pows, 
instead of obstructing their repatriation by raising 
unreasonable conditions under the manipulation of the 
authorities. 
  MINJU CHOSON says if the South Korean rulers persistently 
evaded their responsibility, they will face a stern judgement by 
the nation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- Mass rallies are being 
held across the northern half of Korea to denounce the criminal 
dumping of nuclear waste by the South Korean rulers. 
  At a mass rally held in Wonsan, a port city of culture and 
recreation on the East Coast, on April 23, the speakers said 
that the South Korean rulers had dumped into the sea nuclear 
waste amounting to 11,000 trillion becquerels, heavily 
destroying resources and causing women to give birth to deformed 
babies. 
  They bitterly condemned nuclear waste dumping as an 
anti-national, anti-human criminal act which can be committed 
only by those indifferent to the existence of the nation and 
heedless of international law. 
  The speakers at a mass rally held in Nampo, a port city on 
the West Coast, on April 26 said that the Korean people would 
never tolerate the heinous crimes of the Kim Yong-sam group 
reducing even the seas to a nuclear dumping ground, not 
contented with covering the whole land of the South with nuclear 
weapons of outside forces. 
  They stressed that all the compatriots at home and abroad 
will wage a more vigorous anti-U.S., anti-war, anti-nuke 
struggle to check nuclear waste dumping by the South Korean 
puppet clique and make the Korean peninsula a nuclear-free, 
peace zone without the danger of war.

  [Text] Tokyo April 26 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] -- 
A Japan-Korea emergency round-table conversation on the 
denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and the nuclear issue 
was held in Nagoya city on April 13 under the sponsorship of the 
Aichi Prefectural People's Council for Japan-Korea Friendship. 
  Mitsudoshi Omatsuzawa, secretary general of the Aichi 
prefectural headquarters of the Japan Social-Democratic Party, 
addressing the round-table conversation, said the joint 
declaration on the conversion of Northeast Asia into a 
nuclear-free, peace zone, which was issued between the Japan 
Social-Democratic Party and the Workers' Party of Korea in March 
1981, is of weighty significance at present. 
  Noting that the Japan Social-Democratic Party assumes a 
heavy 
responsibility in making the Japanese Government approach the 
settlement of the problem with a right stand under the overflow 
of the informations slandering the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea over the nuclear issue, he stressed the Japan 
Social-Democratic Party would support the independent, peaceful 
reunification of Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 (KNS-KCNA) -- Chief vice-chairman of 
the Central Standing Committee of the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), Ho Chong-man, called an 
emergency press conference in Tokyo on April 25 regarding the 
forcible search of the Osaka Prefectural headquarters and 
branches of Chongnyon by the Japanese police, at which he read 
out a statement in the name of the Chongnyon Central Standing 
Committee. 
  The statment said: 
  At about 07:20 on April 25, the Osaka Prefectural police 
brought 56 mobile cars with more than 1,300 policemen to the 
prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and made a forcible search 
of the headquarters' hall after creating an atmosphere of terror 
around the headquarters. 
  On the other hand, the Osaka Prefectural police forced the 
same search at branches of the Osaka Prefectural headquarters of 
Chongnyon. 
  The massive crackdown on the headquarters and branches of 
Chongnyon were the first of their kind in 39 years after the 
formation of Chongnyon. This shows how openly the Japanese 
authorities are suppressing Chongnyon. 
  Drawing attention to the fact that the Japanese reactionary 
authorities got more frantic in suppressing Chongnyon when 
nuclear row against the DPRK was being intensified, the 
statement said: 
  The Japanese Government must renounce at once its hostile 
policy towards the DPRK and repressive policy against the Korean 
residents in Japan. We demand that the Japanese Government and 
police stop immediately their unjustifiable suppression of 
Chongnyon and apologize for it. 
  We regard the illegal crackdown this time as a grave 
provocation against the Korean people. 
  On the same day, O Hyong-chin, vice-chairman of Chongnyon 
and 
chairman of its Osaka Prefectural headquarters, called a press 
conference and denounced the crackdown by the Japanese police.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- Korean residents in 
Japan protested against the crackdown on the Osaka Prefectural 
Headquarters of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) and its branches by Japanese police, according 
to KNS reports from Tokyo. 
  Representatives of the Federation of Korean Traders and 
Industrialists in Japan on April 26 demanded the Japan Police 
Agency to probe into the truth behind the murder of 
Vice-Chairman of the Federation Ku Cha-yong, saying that the 
forcible search into the Osaka prefectural headquarters of 
Chongnyon by Osaka prefectural police and assault on a Korean 
student are the result of the hostile policy of Japanese 
authorities towards the DPRK and Chongnyon. 
  On the same day, officials and compatriots under the Osaka 
prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon thronged to the Osaka 
prefectural police headquarters and strongly demanded it 
renounce at once the hostile policy towards the DPRK, stop 
suppressing Korean residents in Japan and apologize for it and 
immediately return the unconcerned materials seized from the 
Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and its branches. 
  Song Chang-to, chairman of the Osaka Prefectural Committee 
of 
the Union of Korean Teachers in Japan, in his report at its 
emergency meeting on April 26, charged that the Japanese 
authorities made every effort to undermine the organizations of 
Koreans in Japan and obliterate the education of Koreans, before 
the war of aggression on Korea was unleashed by the U.S. 
imperialists in 1950, and called upon the teachers and students 
to cope with the subversive moves of the reactionaries within 
and without with heightened vigilance. 
  At the meeting, O Hyong-chin, vice-chairman of the Chongnyon 
Central Standing Committee and chairman of the Osaka prefectural 
headquarters of Chongnyon, called for smashing the subversive 
plots of the reactionaries within and without with united 
efforts and actively push ahead with the work. 
  Meanwhile, Vice-Chairman Paek Han-ki and director of 
International Department Kim Tae-hui of the Chongnyon Central 
Standing Committee met the cadres of Japan Social-Democratic 
Party [JSDP] on April 25 and asked for positive activities of 
the JSDP to stop the suppression of Chongnyon by the Japanese 
authorities and immediately renounce and rectify the hostile 
policy towards the DPRK.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- We who regard the 
dignity of the country and the nation as our life and soul 
demand that the Japanese authorities immediately stop the 
repressive campaign against Koreans in Japan and the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and warn 
that their indiscreet acts may cause grave unpardonable 
consequences against history and the times. 
  This is stressed in a statement issued today by the 
Korea-Japan Friendship Association. 
  The police authorities in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, some time 
ago surrounded the Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon 
with the mobilization of 1,300 police before forcibly searching 
the hall of the headquarters and its four branches in Osaka. 
And members of the "Kanto Council of the Union of Patriots of 
Great Japan" staged an anti-Chongnyon, anti-DPRK campaign in 
front of the headquarters of Chongnyon and organs under its 
affiliation. 
  This hostile campaign came at a time when the United States, 
Japan and the South Korean authorities were rendering the 
situation on the Korean peninsula extremely strained over the 
"nuclear issue" and the Japanese Government authorities were 
openly calling for setting in-motion an "international 
cooperation system" to stifle the DPRK, says the statement, 
bitterly denouncing it as an intolerable provocation against the 
DPRK as well as Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan. 
  The statement continues: 
  The Japanese authorities' repressive campaign against 
Chongnyon is a mockery of and an insult to the far-sighted and 
conscience-minded personages and people of Japan who are making 
all sincere efforts to establish relations of good neighbourhood 
with the DPRK and live on good terms with it. 
  We expect that the Dietmen's League for the Promotion of 
Japan-Korea Friendship and conscience-minded personages and 
other people of Japan will pay deep attention to the grave 
situation and take resolute measures lest the DPRK-Japan 
relations should deteriorate and lead to an unpredictable 
misfortune.

<F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Urges Japanese Authorities </F>
To Stop Crackdown on Chongnyon and Apologize for It" -- KCNA 
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
DPRK Foreign Ministry in a statement today demanded that the 
Japanese authorities ponder over the grave consequences to be 
entailed by their reckless acts, immediately stop their 
crackdown on the General Association of Korean residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan and apologize for it. 
  Some time ago, the Japanese authorities sent scores of 
mobile 
police vehicles and some 1,000 policemen who encircled the Osaka 
Prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and forcibly searched 
office rooms of the headquarters, residences of its leading 
officials and branch offices. Earlier, rightwing gangsters 
under the manipulation of the authorities swarmed to a central 
organ of Chongnyon and its affiliated organizations and kicked 
up a row, even murdering a businessman of Chongnyon. 
  "This is a hostile act of encroaching upon the sovereignty 
of 
Chongnyon and crudely violating the democratic national rights 
of Koreans in Japan and a challenge to the DPRK which cannot be 
overlooked," the statement says, and goes on: 
  "We cannot but take a serious note of the fact that the 
Japanese authorities are intensifying their suppression of 
Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, while intentionally aggravating 
the situation over the fictitious 'nuclear issue' of the DPRK at 
the instigation of the United States. 
  "Chongnyon is a peaceloving organization whose activities 
are 
officially recognized by the Japanese authorities and the 
Japanese law and which enjoys full support of many countries and 
organizations in the world. 
  "There is neither reason nor ground for Chongnyon to be an 
object of crackdown by the Japanese authorities. 
  "Moreover, Koreans in Japan are innocent people who were 
forcibly taken to Japan and subjected to hard toil under the 
brutal Japanese imperialist rule, and their descendants. 
Therefore, special protection must be granted to them by the 
Japanese authorities. 
  "Far from apologizing for and liquidating the past crimes 
committed against the Korean people, however, the Japanese 
authorities are engaging in suppression of Koreans in Japan and 
their legitimate organizations. This is an unpardonable act. 
  "We will consider any crackdown on Chongnyon an encroachment 
upon the dignity and sovereignty of our Republic and decisively 
counter it." 
  The statement expresses the hope that all the progressive 
personages and broad sections of people in Japan and the world 
will continue to express support and solidarity for the 
righteous activities of Chongnyon for its democratic national 
rights and national reunification.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 26 (KCNA) -- "President Kim Il-song 
who has been active as an outstanding statesman for many years, 
performing great exploits in the struggle for the freedom and 
independence of the country, is a great leader of the present 
time who is famous worldwide," said Pedro Margolles Villanueva, 
director general of the PRENSA LATINA of Cuba, who visited Korea. 
  Giving his impressions of Korea here, he said, "When I had 
an 
audience of President Kim Il-song, I could deeply feel once 
again comrade president's unshakable revolutionary will to 
defend the cause of socialism with no retreat before the 
imperialists and his strong and resolute position never to 
pardon any invading enemy." 
  "Under the wise guidance of the great Comrade Kim Il-song 
and 
dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, enormous achievements have been made 
in socialist construction of Korea and the Korean people have 
wrought miracles which no one else can effect over the 40 odd 
years since the ceasefire," he said. 
  The director general of the PRENSA LATINA added that 
wonderful and magnificent grand monuments have taken shape in 
different parts of the country, Pyongyang has turned into the 
most beautiful city and all people lead a happy life with stable 
jobs. 
  "Now the West is alleging that the DPRK is stepping up `war 
preparations.' But it is quite contrary to the fact," he said, 
adding that Korea is promoting peaceful construction, not war 
preparations.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
dedicate articles to the 33rd anniversary of the independence of 
Sierra Leone. 
  A by-lined article of MINJU CHOSON says that the Sierra 
Leonean people have worked to build a new independent and 
prospering society after independence. 
  It notes: 
  Sierra Leone is developing relations with many countries, 
pursuing a non-aligned policy externally. 
  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea established 
diplomatic ties with Sierra Leone in October 1971. Since then 
travels and contacts have been frequent and friendly relations 
further developed between the two peoples. 
  Believing that the friendly and cooperative relations 
between 
the two countries will grow stronger and develop in accordance 
with the idea of independence, peace and friendship, the Korean 
people wish the Sierra Leonean people new achievements in the 
efforts for the independent development of the country, the 
article says. NODONG SINMUN carries an article introducing the 
change of Sierra Leone.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- A national symposium 
on "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural Question Under the 
Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses", a famous work of the 
great leader President Kim Il-song, was held here on Thursday. 
  The historical letter sent by President Kim Il-song to the 
national agricultural conference on February 24, 1994, gives a 
perfect exposition of the goal and tasks for the final solution 
of the rural question, including the questions of continuously 
pushing ahead with the three revolutions, ideological, technical 
and cultural in the countryside to make the farmers 
revolutionary, assimilate them to the working class and imbue 
them with the socialist idea and with the chuche idea, and of 
improving the technological and cultural standards of the 
agricultural working people to meet the requirements for making 
all the members of the society intellectually-proficient, and 
carrying out the five tasks of electrification, water supply and 
bus service in the rural areas and central heating and gas 
systems in the rural villages to eleminate the distinctions 
between the urban and the rural population in their living 
conditions and complete the industrialisation and modernisation 
of agruculture on a high level, and of converting cooperative 
property into all-people property. 
  The speakers at the symposium said the work which raises the 
final solution of the socialist rural question and the complete 
victory of socialism as immediate practical questions and 
comprehensively indicates tasks for their solution is a great 
programme for the complete victory of socialism. 
  The work is an immortal grand programme which has further 
developed in depth the theory of the working class on the 
socialist rural construction and a true textbook of socialist 
construction which indicates in a unique way the tasks and ways 
for the ultimate solution of the socialist rural question and 
the complete victory of socialism, the speakers stressed.

great leader President Kim Il-song "Answers to the Questions 
Raised by the Japanese NHK News Coverage Group" was reported by 
U.S. papers. 
  INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE April 19, carrying the answers, 
said President Kim Il-song has been leading Korea for nearly 
half a century. 
  The paper quoted President Kim Il-song as saying that the 
United States is putting pressure on the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea which has no nuclear weapons on absurd charges 
while trying to dismiss with the word "withdrawal" the question 
of the nuclear weapons it has actually shipped into South Korea 
and that the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula can be solved 
only through direct talks between the DPRK and the U.S. 
  On the same day WASHINGTON POST, reporting a detailed gist 
of 
the work of the great leader, stressed that President Kim 
Il-song is the most veteran head of state in the world.

  The People's Army has produced many heroic soldiers who 
dedicated all their wisdom and strength to implementing orders 
and instructions from comrade supreme commander and even laid 
down their precious youth and lives unhesitatingly while 
devoting themselves to the performance of their military duties. 
  An airman, Chon Chi-ho, with the unshakable creed that he 
had no right to die before implementing orders from comrade 
supreme commander, did not loosen his grip on the control lever, 
firmly defending the airspace of the motherland till the last 
moments of his life. Sin Chong-nam, a company commander, 
devoted himself body and soul to performing military duties of 
his company, traveling to and from posts and drill grounds on 
the backs of his comrades-in-arms, although he had lost his legs. 
  Heroes of the '90s like Kim Kwang-chol and Han Yong-chol who 
fulfilled training orders from comrade supreme commander, saving 
their comrades-in-arms by covering handgrenades on the point of 
explosion with their bodies were also produced by the People's 
Army. 
  People's Army soldiers continue to write letters pledging 
loyalty to Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  Recently, Yi Chang-ung and his six brothers and one sister, 
Kang Myong-il and his four brothers, Pak Yong-chol and his 
seven brothers and many other People's Army soldiers sent 
letters of loyalty to comrade supreme commander, vowing to be 
revolutionary soldiers defending the general with arms in the 
van. 
  Indeed, the Korean People's Army is ranks of loyalty and 
invincible revolutionary Armed Forces entrusting all their 
destinies to Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il and fighting 
with a single determination to become guns and bombs defending 
comrade supreme commander with their lives.

<F P=106> ["Highly Important Work That Brought About New Turn in </F>
Establishing the System of Party Leadership" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- "On Thoroughly 
Establishing the System of Party Leadership", a work published 
by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il on April 28, 1979, is a 
monumental work which has made a great contribution to 
strengthening and developing the party into ever-victorious 
militant ranks which have firmly established a revolutionary 
system of leadership, and a highly important guideline which all 
the party organizations, party officials and members should 
always hold fast to, says NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article 
today. 
  The article continues: 
  For the profound content and justness of ideas and theories 
contained in it the work has displayed an indestructible 
vitality over the past 15 years, applied successfully in our 
party building and activities. 
  The significance and vitality of the work lie, first of all, 
in that it has made it possible to firmly establish among the 
officials and party members a revolutionary trait of 
unconditionally accepting the party's decisions and instructions 
and carrying them out to the end. 
  All the officials and party members accept the ideas and 
policies of the party as the most just and devote all their 
energy and wisdom to the struggle to carry out the party's 
policies. 
  "When the party is determined, we can do anything!", a motto 
of faith of our people, well shows the noble spiritual world of 
our officials and party members and other working people who 
accept the lines and policies of the party as a requirement of 
their life and carry them out on the principles of absoluteness 
and unconditionality. 
  The significance and vitality of the work also lie in that 
it 
has made it possible to establish a steel-like revolutionary 
discipline in the whole party. 
  All the party members and other working people deeply 
cherish 
an unshakable faith and will to share the same destiny with the 
party forever, entrusting their destinies entirely to the dear 
leader. 
  The complete and unconditional consistency of all the 
officials and party members in ideology and purpose and in 
action, breathing the same with the party, speaking the same 
with the party and acting in step with the intentions of the 
party, is a proud feature of our party which has established a 
steel-like discipline in it. 
  The significance and vitality of the work also lie in that 
it 
has helped to establish a revolutionary style of life whereby 
all the officials and party members participate in their party 
life sincerely with a correct viewpoint on the party 
organisation. 
  Our officials and party members now make it a rule and habit 
to regard as dignified and value the party organization and work 
and live in strict reliance on it. They consciously and 
sincerely take part in their party life with a correct attitude 
toward party life. All this is a valuable fruition of the 
strenuous efforts to carry through the ideas and policies 
indicated in the work. 
  As the ideas and policies indicated in the work have been 
implemented thoroughly, the militant function and role of the 
party organizations have been enhanced immensely and the ranks 
of cadres firmly built with elite revolutionaries who are 
possessed of all the traits and qualities of true chuche-type 
revolutionaries.

the right seed" and conducting a speed campaign. 
  The speakers said that the work of Comrade Kim Chong-il is 
an 
immortal grand program which clearly indicates the features of 
the socialist press, the function and role which it should play

the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of the leader 
which is succeeded through generations, being the first in 
history to put the building of the socialist media on the basis

<F P=106> ["Text" of premier's response to bishop's proposals given to </F>
Bishop Nguyen Minh Nhat by Vu Quang, the chairman of the 
Religious Affairs Committee] 
  [Text] On 3 March 1994, Vu Quang, the chairman of the 
government's Religious Affairs Committee met and worked with 
bishops on the Standing Committee of the Vietnam Council of 
Bishops headed by Bishop Nguyen Minh Nhat, the council 
president. As ordered by the premier, the chairman of the 
Religious Affairs Committee gave Bishop Nguyen Minh Nhat 
Document No 46 CV/TGCP of 17 February, which gives the premier's 
response to "the proposals made by the Vietnam Council of 
Bishops" at the youth conference of the Council of Bishops held 
in October 1993. The following is the complete text of this 
document. 
  Sincerely, Bishop Nguyen Minh Nhat, Chairman of the Vietnam 
Council of Bishops 
  Sirs: 
  On "the proposals of the Council of Bishops" that were sent 
to the premier on the occasion of the recent youth conference of 
the Council of Bishops, the premier has asked the Religious 
Affairs Committee to inform you of his ideas as follows: 
  1. As for traveling around to perform the duties of bishops 
and priests, the government has always tried to facilitate this. 
Decree 69 and Circular 02, for example, state that "bishops who 
go to carry out tasks in a diocese and priests who go to carry 
out tasks in a parish for which they are responsible do not have 
to request permission." 
  2. Assigning and transferring priests in a diocese is to be 
done based on the work requirements of the church, but in order 
to facilitate control by the local authorities, matters must be 
discussed and an agreement must be reached with the local 
authorities. 
  3. As for publishing houses to print religious publications, 
according to the Publishing Law and decrees of the government 
and the circulars of the Ministry of Culture that provide 
guidance in implementing the law, the Ministry of Culture will 
discuss things with the various religious groups in order to 
designate a number of publishing houses and facilitate the 
printing of religious publications. 
  4. The premier welcomes the contributions made by the 
dioceses, parishes, and orders to educating our children and 
youths. The state has given attention to expanding education, 
has implemented policies to vary the forms of training and 
instruction, and has encouraged the opening of private and 
semi-private schools along with the public schools. The dioceses 
and orders can send people for training and contribute money, 
materials and equipment, and instructional materials to these 
schools. 
  5. As for religious orders, Decree 69 states that orders can 
accept people into a monastery. However, in order to facilitate 
things, those people are responsible for completing the ordinary 
administrative control procedures with the authorities where the 
monastery is located and in the place where they reside. 
  6. As for priests who have returned after a period of 
training, the government has taken steps to integrate these 
people into the life of the local people. Priests who have 
returned from studying can carry out their religious duties if a 
bishop gives his guarantee and the local authorities recognize 
them as good citizens. The government's Religious Affairs 
Committee has provided specific guidelines on this point. 
  7. The government has also facilitated attending a seminary 
or entering a monastery. This is the same as for other citizens 
who attend a government school. Circular 02 states that people 
who want to attend an official school or enter a monastery or 
convent are Vietnamese citizens who must adhere to the policies 
and obey the laws of the state. 
  8. As for opening the Hue seminary, the government approved 
this in 1980, but the Council of Bishops and the Hue Diocese 
were not able to do this. Today, if they are able, they can 
carry out the procedures and open this seminary. 
  9. Based on the agreement between the church and the local 
authorities, the facilities of the Dalat Pontifical Institute 
are presently being used by the Nuclear Research Institute on 
behalf of the national interest. The government will review this 
matter. 
  10. In preparing to enroll people in a seminary, the 
dioceses 
with potential students can discuss things with the existing 
seminaries in order to open preparatory classes at the 
seminaries. But the important thing is that to ensure that the 
preparatory classes are of good quality, the contents, programs, 
and rules of those classes must be prepared carefully. 
  11. As for places of worship and places for making donations 
and the matter of repairing and building churches and chapels, 
the premier's Directive 379 and the circular guiding the 
implementation of this directive have provided concrete 
guidelines. The bishops, priests, and Catholic population must 
discuss things with the various-echelon authorities in order to 
thoroughly understand and implement the things stipulated by the 
state. 
  The above points are the views of the premier in response to 
the proposals made by the Council of Bishops. The premier hopes 
that in carrying out specific tasks, there will be frank 
discussions and exchanges of opinions with a constructive spirit 
of solidarity among all the parties concerned in order to 
maintain the ordinary religious activities of Catholics and 
create favorable conditions for people to participate in 
building and defending the fatherland.

<F P=106> [Report on Vietnamese Communist Party General Secretary Do </F>
Muoi's address at 25 April national party conference of control 
cadres] 
  [Text] During the last few years, the international 
situation has become complicated, and domestically we have been 
facing many difficulties. Our party has led well the 
implementation of the resolutions of the seventh party congress, 
the Central Committee, and the Midterm Party National Conference 
[MPNC]. Our party has also been consistent in the renovation 
undertaking by setting up many domestic and external relations 
policies which were in good accordance with the development 
rules, popular aspirations, and the trends of our time. Our 
people at home and friends around the world have strongly 
supported these policies. We have responded in a timely fashion 
to all circumstances, maintained political stability, firmly 
consolidated national defense, pushed socioeconomic development 
forward, expanded democracy, diversified external relations, and 
step by step nullified the blockade and embargo against us. 
  These achievements are the results of the strong political 
acumen of our party, army and people. They also strongly proved 
that our people are attached as flesh and blood with the party, 
and are absolutely confident that with its efforts in 
self-reform and self- rectification, the party is still 
trustworthy as a true revolutionary party: the party that can 
motivate unity, solidarity, intelligence, and the strength of 
people, and the party that always cares for the people's 
standard of living and the people's government, which is truly a 
government of the people, by the people, and for the people. 
  It is obvious that the achievements of the past few years 
are 
closely related to the construction effort and rectification 
work of the party, in which contributions by the cadres in 
charge of party control must be highly appreciated. 
  The comrade general secretary also stressed that the aim of 
party control work is to ensure that party lines and policies be 
implemented correctly and innovatively to bring successes to the 
revolution and benefits for the people. The party cadres 
should always strive to achieve what is beneficial and avoid 
what is harmful to the people. These are the basic principles 
of party control work. Only through control work will we know 
whether the party resolutions are implemented and whether they 
are implemented well, and we would also know strong aspects of 
our lines and policies so that we can further develop them, as 
well as the weaknesses so that we can adjust and improve in time. 
  Being a ruling party where party cadres are entrusted by the 
people with various positions in state agencies at different 
echelons, all cadres should use this privileged environment to 
develop their ability to serve the people. This privileged 
environment can also turn easily into a source of corruption and 
authoritativeness. On one hand, we should strive to educate 
party cadres to improve and perfect themselves so that they will 
always follow the just and correct objectives. On the other 
hand, we have to carry out regular party control work in order 
to encourage good deeds and prevent bad ones, and also to punish 
offenders on a correct and timely basis. Control work will help 
us screen out of the party the corrupt members and select the 
loyal and enthusiastic ones, those with character and talents 
who can assume the responsibility of making the party and its 
cadres worthy of the people's trust. 
  In the situation where the market economy is being 
implemented and external relations expanded, there would be 
complicated issues in parallel with favorable conditions. These 
issues require us to respond actively and positively, especially 
in preventing the degradations; corrosion of confidence in the 
revolutionary ideals; corruption; smuggling; bribery; 
indications of depravation, degeneration, and decadence; all 
acts of authoritativeness, bossiness, bureaucratism, and 
coercion; and all opportunistic activities aiming at seizing 
authority, houses and land, assets, and other properties of the 
state and the people. These are the basic and urgent duties and 
contents of tasks for control cadres in the new situation. 
  The party control work aims to develop strength and overcome 
weakness, making the party more steadfast. In party control 
work, the cadres need to highlight right and wrong in all 
targeted activities, so that all loyal and active party cadres 
will be protected and trusted, with wrong-doers and opportunists 
punished according to the magnitude of their deeds. All party 
members should be guaranteed equal treatment from party 
discipline. 
  The objects of the party control work include organs and 
member cadres, especially key cadres at all levels. These are 
the two subjects that must be given equal importance. 
  We must conduct comprehensive control and pay special 
attention to the implementation of the party line, policy, and 
regulations as outlined in the MPNC resolution. That is the 
most comprehensive content of control work. We need to pay 
attention to the control of members and organs in their 
observation of the Constitution and the state law. This is the 
goal that must not be taken lightly in control work. Control 
work requires every cadre to not avoid and protect individuals 
and organizations that have violated party discipline, the 
Constitution, and state law. At the same time, in the current 
situation, we must clearly protect justice and righteousness by 
not allowing anyone to take advantage of the control work to 
disrupt party organizations and tarnish the cadres and members. 
Our party welcomes and encourages everyone, including 
non-members, to criticize party organizations and individual 
members as long as their opinions are honest, constructive, and 
responsible. That is our party's philosophy, which relies on 
public opinion and is also an example of our people's civilized 
attitude in human relations. 
  Control work is not only the work of the control committee 
but also the task of the entire party, beginning with the 
committees at all levels. We have to admit that the committees 
have not been the first to discover troubled incidents in the 
past few years, including problems among themselves. They only 
find out problems through party members and the general public. 
That is the thing that we must resolutely overcome in the 
coming period. Making the party clean and strong must be the 
task of the entire party, cadres, and members, beginning with 
the committees. The important thing is to make the committees 
themselves clean and strong to set good examples for their 
cadres and members. 
  In order to achieve that, the entire party, beginning with 
the committees, the control committees at all levels, and the 
control cadres, must improve their sense of logic, enhance their 
knowledge of the actual situation, thoroughly understand the 
party line and conception, and follow our predecessors' good 
examples to train ourselves for better political and 
professional knowledge and working ability to actively 
contribute to party reform and consolidation, making the party 
cleaner and stronger. 
  Party control work requires us to heighten our 
responsibility 
to the party and the public and to demonstrate our party's 
spirit of clearness and and straightforwardness, as our Uncle Ho 
used to say: casualness and carelessness in party control work 
will cause great damage to the political life of a party member, 
but leaving his problem untouched will not only damage that 
party member but also create more problems for the entire 
organization. 
  Control work must be combined with organization work for the 
correct and speedy evaluation of cadres and members. Many 
incidents left untouched for too long in the party are the 
result of poor coordination between control work and cadre 
organization work at all levels. 
  The comrade general secretary concluded that the last target 
that the control work needs to achieve is to make the party 
organization and contingent of cadres and members cleaner and 
stronger. The control work must ensure that after the 
completion of the work, the party organization will become 
stronger and the contingent of members become more united and 
mature, not the other way around. 
  The control work and the contingent of the control cadres 
are 
enjoying a great honor in contributing their great share in the 
successful implementation of the political duties set forth by 
the party. They must satisfactorily serve the party building 
work and actively contribute to the preparation of the eighth 
national congress and party congresses at all levels in the 
coming years. 
  Satisfactorily carrying out the control work is also 
executing Uncle Ho's philosophy of building our party into an 
exemplary political organization representing the intelligence, 
morality, conscience, and honor of the entire nation, deserving 
a leader and a very loyal servant of the people, as Uncle Ho 
used to remind us.

  [Text] The government held a regular monthly meeting in 
Hanoi from 25-27 April under the chairmanship of Prime Minister 
Vo Van Kiet. 
  At the meeting, the government heard the following: 
  -- Do Quoc Sam, minister of state in charge of the State 
Planning Commission, presented draft orientations for 
industrialization and modernization and a draft policy to 
develop industrial technologies in our country until the year 
2000. These drafts will be submitted to party and state leaders 
for consideration. 
  -- State Bank Governor Cao Sy Khiem presented a draft 
directive on some stipulations regarding the management of 
foreign currencies in the current situation. 
  -- Minister of Justice Nguyen Dinh Loc presented a plan 
for judicial reform in Vietnam. 
  The government also gave its views on the orientations for 
carrying out rural economic reforms and discussed and passed 
five bills to be presented to the National Assembly Standing 
Committee at its upcoming session. These include the law on 
civil servants, the law on granting the titles of State Honor 
and the Heroic Vietnamese Mother, the law on the safeguarding of 
national defense projects and military zones, the law on the 
management over the exploitation and safeguarding of farmland 
irrigation projects, and the law on hydrometeorological projects.

Assembly at its year-end session. 
  In his closing speech, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai 
reminded all cabinet members of some current emergency tasks to 
implement those government decisions already promulgated, 
especially those dealing with the need to step up the practice 
of thrift, to fight against wasteful spending, corruption, and 
smuggling, to increase revenue while reducing budget 
expenditures, and to attain the target for saving 5 percent of 
the budget as already set forth in a National Assembly 
resolution. 
  The deputy prime minister assigned various relevant 
ministries and sectors the tasks of inspecting, examining, and 
promptly resolving various pressing issues in the advance toward 
achieving mountain socioeconomic development activities in 
accordance with new government decisions and of providing strict 
guidance for those other areas of work to achieve the targets of 
the socioeconomic development plan for the first half of 1994.

<F P=106> [Report by Tieu Van: "In the First Quarter of 1994, 60 Cases </F>
of Corruption and Bribery Causing Losses of 3.677 Billion Dong 
Have Been Discovered] 
  [Text] According to the report of Interior Minister Bui 
Thien Ngo, during the first few months of 1994, 60 cases of 
corruption and bribery causing losses totalling 3.677 billion 
dong have been discovered. In comparison with the last quarter 
of 1993, this is a decrease of 27 percent in the number of 
cases. Of these cases, five have resulted in the conviction of 
11 accused persons, one of them getting a life sentence. 
  The different forms of corruption and bribery activities 
mainly include: intentional violation of budgetary transaction 
procedures, keeping funds without bookkeeping documents, 
improper expenditure, and violation of income and expenditure 
principles. Typical of these offenses are the cases of the Lam 
Dong Tea Company, with 1.4 billion dong involved, and the 
Company of the Trade Union of the Metallurgy Sector, with 1.8 
billion dong. There were also cases of violation of the 
regulations on building construction (in the bidding process, 
capital allocation, use of capital, and cost of materials), 
obtaining property by deception, illegal sales, setting prices 
contrary to principles, and spending land fees improperly. 
  Though the number of discovered cases has been reduced in 
comparison with the same period last year, the corruption 
situation is still very complicated. The tasks of investigation 
and discovery still lack concentration, even though some 
progress has been made. The handling process is still sluggish. 
The practice of bribing to get construction capital and 
licenses for joint ventures is still beyond the scope of the 
investigation work. The practices of receiving bribes, 
embezzling state property, using public property as presents to 
solicit favors, and so forth are still rampant. At many places, 
government directives on antiwaste and thrift practice have been 
ignored or poorly performed. 
  The Interior Ministry recently held a meeting to discuss 
measures to overcome the tardy progress of the anticorruption 
activities, and to further push the campaign to suppress and 
prevent corruption.

<F P=106> [Article by Phong Lan: "Carry on the Anticorruption </F>
Struggle: New Requirements, Strong Measures"] 
  [Text] The activities of the city people's court in 1993 
indicate that although the percentage of corruption cases that 
have been discovered and brought to trial remains low compared 
with the actual situation, more severe measures have been taken 
against corruption cases than before. 
  Topping the list of corruption cases is the "embezzlement of 
socialist property" category (46 cases that account for 52 
percent). A total of 19 cases involving 37 defendants have been 
brought to trial with one life imprisonment sentence, three 
20-year imprisonment sentences, and 22 imprisonment sentences 
being handed down by the court. 
  The "deliberate attempts to act at variance with state 
economic management regulations" category often causes serious 
consequences. There were very few cases that caused losses less 
than 100 million dong. Furthermore, most of those cases were 
motivated by personal interests. Therefore, the punitive 
measures against this kind of crimes is quite strong in nature 
in many cases, even though violators were state management 
cadres, they had to serve imprisonment sentences ranging from 
10-12 years. 
  Regarding the "embezzlement of socialist property through 
fraudulent means" and "abuse of power to misappropriate 
socialist property" categories, the city people's court has 
brought to trial 14 cases and imposed life imprisonment 
sentences on five cases and handed down imprisonment sentences 
of more than 10 years on most of the remaining cases. Only six 
percent of those who had been tried for these kind of crimes 
received suspended sentences thanks to the less serious nature 
of their wrongdoings. 
  As for the "bribe-taking" category, in 1993, the city 
people's court conducted hearings only on two cases, completed 
the trial of the case involving the Tan Binh District public 
security service, and forwarded the case involving Truong Van 
Nghia of the Inspection Committee on House Sales at Prices Set 
by the State under the House and Land Service to the city 
people's organ of control for further investigation. 
  Regarding the six major cases in 1993 corruption cases that 
the city had reported to the government, the city people's court 
so far has completed the trial of only four of them, namely the 
case involving Xacogiva in which Vo Thi Thay,(wife of Pham Cong 
Tuoc, director of Xacogiva, was sentenced to life imprisonment; 
the case involving Ho Hoang Nam, who was sentenced to a 20-year 
imprisonment for having used falsified documents to 
misappropriate Villa No. 53 on Tran Quoc Thao Street; the case 
involving an investigation and search team of the Tan Binh 
District public security service taking a bribe in the form of 
116 taels of gold and four Honda motorcycles (four of the 
accused were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from 15-20 
years); and the case involving the director of the Cu Chi 
District Import-Export Corporation being sentenced to an 
eight-year imprisonment for his deliberate attempts to act at 
variance with state economic management regulations. Regarding 
the remaining two cases involving Sapexim, an import-export 
joint venture with Cambodia, and the Overseas Vietnamese 
Services and Import-Export Corporation (Cosevina), the documents 
have already been forwarded to the city people's court for trial. 
  In addition, another major corruption and smuggling case has 
also been tried at the preliminary and also final hearing of the 
Supreme People's Court. The case took place in the city and 
involved Phan Anh Tuan, former director of the city customs 
services. Through investigation, the agencies concerned have 
discovered and clarified the wrongdoings of a number of cadres 
of the city customs and house and land services. 
  Some Outstanding Problems Concerning Corruption Cases 
[subhead] 
  The national renovation cause is making its presence felt in 
all domains of social life. The transition from the economic 
policy based on the system of bureaucratic centralism and state 
subsidization to the market-oriented mechanism under state 
management has recorded marked results. Nonetheless, during 
this "transitional period," old work styles are not yet been 
fully overcome whereas new ways of doing things have taken shape 
but still need to be perfected. In addition, socioeconomic life 
is still rife with many difficult and complicated problems. 
Furthermore, violations and crimes, especially corrupt 
practices, have developed at a fast-breaking and alarming rate 
on the economic front. The inevitable shortcomings and 
weaknesses in policies and implementation measures to effect 
changes in the mechanism have created loopholes for criminal 
elements to "slip through and perform tricks." Realities 
indicate that corrupt elements design their own schemes to reach 
their goals. Yet, they all have one thing in common, namely 
trying by all means to take advantage of loopholes in policies, 
laws, and management principles to slip through and carry out 
criminal activities. 
  Though corrupt practices take place on all economic fronts, 
they often occur in the banking, trade, import-export, building, 
transport and communications, and industrial sectors (as many as 
80-85 percent of cases involving corruption, attempts to act at 
variance with state economic management regulations, and 
bribe-taking occured in the aforementioned areas). 
  Over the past years, more and more "collective crime" 
phenomena have taken place. There have been cases in which the 
number of defendants reached dozens of people, including leading 
cadres (there were 22 defendants in the Thanh Huong Perfume case 
and 12 defendants, including 10 state officials, in the case 
involving Phan Anh Tuan). 
  In addition, there have been cases in which different 
corrupt 
elements "met one another" at the same trial session. From the 
starting point at which bribe-giving and bribe-taking are 
performed, corrupt elements often move to the next step by 
making deliberate attempts to act at variance with state 
economic management regulations and by creating conditions for 
the embezzlement of socialist property (as seen in the cases 
involving Le Mai Ninh, Truong Ngoc Tai, Trinh Dong Tac, and 
others). Due to the fact that corrupt practices often take 
place in areas where there are large amounts of assets, goods, 
and money and where corrupt elements collude with one another, 
the degree of seriousness of the losses incurred is very high. 
According to the statistics released by the Supreme People's 
Organ of Control, in the 1990-91 two-year period, the losses 
caused by 980 corruption cases that 31 provinces and cities have 
initiated legal proceedings against or brought to trial reach 
nearly 1,000 billion dong. 
  Also noteworthy is the fact that in the recent past, the 
number of cases involving corruption, bribe-taking, and 
deliberate attempts to act at variance with state economic 
management regulations had the participation of private parties. 
Worse still, in some cases, it was those very private parties 
who were the masterminds and organizers. Those elements have 
"employed" the pleasure-seeking psychology of a number of 
influential cadres to pay the way for their criminal activities. 
  Some Problems That Need To Be Addressed [subhead] 
  The incident involving the loss of nearly 1,000 billion dong 
due to corruption is a very alarming fact, indeed. 
Nonetheless, what is more serious is the fact that corruption 
is now aiming its offensive spearheads directly at our personnel 
to undermine our party and state policies and lines and hinder 
our national renovation and development process. Therefore, the 
anti-corruption struggle constitutes an uncompromising front and 
calls for many uniform and resolute measures. 
  Regarding trials, the court sector has adopted more severe 
measures against corruption cases. The enforcement of economic 
punitive measures against corruption cases must be carried out 
in a more resolute, thorough, and effective manner to ensure 
full recovery of lost state property while at the same time 
eliminating all causes leading to criminal activities. (As for 
the city alone, so far, only less than 20 percent of lost state 
property has been recovered). Regarding those corruption cases 
involving the participation of private parties, it is necessary 
to study and evaluate correctly the latter's role as well as 
take appropriate action against them. This move will help 
reduce the causes leading cadres to get involved in criminal 
activities. 
  In addition to severe action against violations, it is 
necessary to formulate an appropriate mechanism to overcome 
shortcomings in state control over all aspects of social life, 
especially over targeted economic sectors (because these serve 
as the most suitable breeding grounds for corruption). At the 
same time, steps must be taken to build and develop an 
appropriate and uniform legal system. These moves constitute 
part of the necessary factors for "destroying down to the root" 
the causes leading to the birth and growth of corruption. The 
problem concerning personnel training and cadre assignment is 
also of great importance and requires that cadres possess both 
ethics and professionalism in order to undertake their tasks in 
the new situation.

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel Le Ke Lam] </F>
  [Text] The southeastern coastal zone of the fatherland 
plays an important economic and national defense role. In this 
coastal zone, there are various islands and archipelagoes--huge 
defensive "battleships." The Con Son archipelago [Footnote 1] 
[This is still called Con Dao. It covers an area 72 square km in 
size and consists of 16 islands of various sizes. It's 
coordinates are 106.31 degrees to 106.45 degrees longitude east 
and 8.34 to 8.49 degrees latitude north. It is approximately 80 
nautical miles southeast of Vung Tau.] is located along an 
international navigational route. It has many deep bays 
protected from the wind that are very convenient for ships to 
drop anchor. Northeast of the Con Son archipelago is Phu Quy 
Island. [Footnote 2] [This is located 90 nautical miles from 
Vung Tau and 55 nautical miles from Phan Thiet.] East of Phu Quy 
are the Truong Sa [Spratly] Islands. Together, these three 
islands and archipelagoes form a strategic "triangle of islands" 
that is closely connected to the mainland and that make it 
convenient for developing the coastal economy and national 
defense, which is something rarely found anywhere else. 
  The oil and gas industrial zone in the southeastern coastal 
region of our country encompasses an area of hundreds of 
thousands of square kilometers. We have now formed two oil and 
gas exploration and mining zones. The Bach Ho field began 
operations in 1986. Next to go on line was the Rong field, and 
very soon, the Dai Hung field will begin supplying many millions 
of tons of crude oil per year to the country. This is an 
advantage for building and developing Vietnam's coastal economy. 
This will attract investment and cooperation from many 
countries. But this is also an area that various enemies have 
their eye on. 
  With the new plots and stratagems of the imperialists and 
other enemies, our coastal zones in general and our southeastern 
coastal zone in particular will always be "hot" and very 
"sensitive" zones. Other countries could and have encroached on 
our sovereignty in this coastal zone: 
  Agreements have been signed with foreign corporations to 
carry on oil and gas mining operations along our continental 
shelf. But their goal is to gradually occupy the entire eastern 
coastal zone. In the name of implementing the agreements, they 
will use their naval forces to perform defense tasks and 
regularly maintain strong naval forces in this zone with the aim 
of creating tension and turmoil throughout it. 
  "Scientific research" and defense flotillas will be sent to 
study and reconnoiter the situation along our coast. Ships and 
civilian forces will be used to extract marine products around 
the drilling zones, which will weaken security, interfere with 
our mining activities, and at the same time give them an excuse 
to start conflicts when necessary. 
  It will not be possible to eliminate the enemy's ability to 
use limited naval and air forces to surround and isolate our 
exploration and mining forces in coastal zones. They will then 
be in a position to use offensive weapons to force us to abandon 
our oil and gas exploration and mining activities. Although the 
forces and combat formulas depend on each enemy, they usually 
concentrate on having the advantage in terms of equipment and 
weapons, launching fierce and sudden attacks, having 
overwhelming strength, and presenting international opinion with 
a "fait accompli." 
  The above analysis means that we must strengthen our ability 
to defend our territorial sovereignty; protect our national 
interests, natural resources, and environment; and defend those 
who are living and working at sea. More specifically, we must 
build a strong national defense potential at sea and in each 
coastal area of the fatherland. We must mobilize the integrated 
strength of the entire party, all the people, and the entire 
military in the economic, political, national defense, and 
security sectors. There must be unified targets and action plans 
based on a common strategy and integrated macrocosmic plan of 
the party and state regarding building, developing, and 
defending our seas. There must be close coordination between 
building and developing the economy and resolutely and ably 
defending our territorial waters, protecting our natural 
resources, maintaining security at sea, and forming a strong and 
broad all-people's national defense and people's war front 
throughout our territorial waters and in each coastal zone and 
in each coastal locality. This front is a major process that 
must be carried on regularly and continuously. The contents of 
this process must be determined based on the situation and 
tasks. It must constantly be improved with respect to 
organizational structure, the forces must be deployed 
rationally, and capabilities for defending the seas must be 
strengthened with the cooperation of the forces existing at sea, 
on the islands, along the coasts, and on land in order to 
satisfy the requirements and complete the tasks. 
  In our coastal areas, there are more than 3,000 islands of 
various sizes. Some of Vietnam's islands and archipelagoes are 
located near the mainland, and others are located far away. 
There are 26 coastal provinces and cities, and almost half of 
the country's population and more than 6 million laborers are 
concentrated in these coastal areas. Almost 240,000 people are 
directly involved in making a living at sea in various sectors, 
and we have 80,000 ships. Our country's system of islands, in 
conjunction with the mainland, forms a multi-level defense 
structure. If the entire country and each coastal locality 
deploys forces and means rationally; coordinates economic, 
national defense, and security matters well; and coordinates 
activities at sea, on the islands, and on land closely, then 
this will create an unbroken and strong national defense and 
security front. This national defense front will be built using 
the integrated strength of the entire country and all the 
people. This is the basis for defending, protecting, 
controlling, and mastering the ocean areas and the precondition 
for scoring "Bach Dang military achievements" like our 
ancestors. The lessons in defending the oceans show that one of 
the most effective ways to affirm and implement sovereignty at 
sea is to have forces constantly present to defend and exploit 
the sea. At sea and on the islands, we must "gradually exploit 
the economic potential of the seas in all respects, develop the 
economy on the islands, become masters of our territorial waters 
and continental shelf, and exert our sovereignty over our 
special economic zones." [Footnote 3] [Strategy to Stabilize and 
Develop the Economy and Society to the Year 2000, Proceedings of 
the Seventh Party Congress] This is the direction for the entire 
country and a pressing need for our fatherland's southeastern 
coastal zone. 
  In building coastal defense zones, the state and many 
coastal 
localities such as Khanh Hoa and Ba Ria-Vung Tau have given 
attention to strengthening the presence of people and forces 
engaged in economic activities and scientific research at sea 
and on the islands in these coastal zones. The number of SRV 
citizens in the sea areas and in Truong Sa and Con Dao districts 
has increased. This is a correct orientation that is aimed at 
developing and protecting the economy in conjunction with 
solidifying and expanding the national defense and security 
front in our southeastern coastal area. But this population is 
not large enough to exploit the strengths that exist in the 
ocean and on the islands, and it has not really satisfied the 
present national defense and security requirements in this area. 
If the population of Con Dao District increases fivefold, the 
fishing and marine products processing sectors can be expanded 
greatly, the strengths concerning tourism and repair and 
maintenance services can be exploited, fuel and food can be 
supplied to ships, and the cultural and social spheres (schools, 
hospitals, theaters, and so on) can be brought into balance. The 
party and state and the sectors and localities should implement 
favorable policies and practical measures to implement this 
policy to enable Phu Quy, Con Son, and Truong Sa to develop in 
all respects. That will be both a force for socioeconomic 
development that is regularly present on the seas and that 
affirms and enforces sovereignty, and a basis for organizing 
militia and self-defense units and strengthening national 
defense strength. At the same time, this will create the 
preconditions for turning the islands and archipelagoes into a 
frontline base that our armed forces can use to carry on 
long-term operations at sea and to satisfy the combat 
requirements when the weather is bad or when the enemy imposes a 
blockade. 
  The state must soon promulgate "regulations on exploiting 
and 
controlling the sea" so that the people and forces at sea have a 
legal basis to rely on and can effectively participate in 
controlling the seas. 
  Building mass armed forces at sea is something that must be 
given attention in the process of building an all-people's 
national defense and people's war front at sea. 
  In the present multifaceted economic structure, we must 
continue to study the organization of coastal militia and 
self-defense forces in the economic elements in order to 
maintain broad capabilities. However, the militia and 
self-defense forces in the state and collective economic 
elements must continue to serve as the activists. The localities 
in these areas should study the experiences of Ba Ria-Vung Tau 
and a number of other coastal localities in organizing the 
militia and self-defense forces in the private economic elements 
so that their own militia and self-defense forces are of high 
quality. When organizing militia and self-defense forces, the 
special characteristics of the occupations must be studied 
carefully (day, night, seasonal activities), and the coastal 
zones (fishing grounds) and activities of each force must be 
determined so that the control zones can be organized and 
divided in a relatively rational manner. In the southeastern 
coastal zone, besides the fishermen from the six coastal 
provinces in the zone, many fishing boats from nearby provinces 
also come to fish in these waters. When organizing militia and 
self-defense forces, attention must be given to this special 
characteristic as well as to the fact that international 
transport forces are sometimes present in the area in order to 
regulate the fishing grounds, deploy the forces rationally, and 
prevent sea areas from being left empty. 
  The use of the equipment and technical means of the forces 
at 
sea must be studied so that when necessary, they can be equipped 
with the means to carry out their economic tasks and support the 
military and national defense requirements. This includes 
equipment to detect targets (fish), determine depths, fix and 
guide targets on and under the water, and information and 
observation means. 
  The naval, air, and other armed forces that are assigned sea 
duties must be suitably organized and equipped, and they must 
coordinate closely with the border units, coastal militia and 
self-defense forces, and local armed forces on the islands and 
on shore in accord with the economic and ocean control 
regulations mentioned above and the orders of the Ministry of 
Defense. The lessons in carrying on operations at sea show that 
in order to ensure that the surface warships complete their 
tasks, air defenses and electronic warfare must be strengthened. 
Concerning this, the experiences in previous wars provide 
valuable lessons that must be exploited and applied. The 
problems is, we must strengthen training and constantly improve 
the combat strength of each force in the joint front based on a 
unified plan. As for the coastal militia and self-defense 
forces, special attention must be given to providing training in 
recognizing shapes and distinguishing targets, and they must be 
given training concerning information technology and methods. 
Along with training each force, a suitable amount of time must 
be set aside for carrying on joint combat maneuvers between the 
air force and navy and the other armed forces, the localities, 
and the coastal and island defense zones based on determining 
what situations might arise and formulating combat operations 
plans based on those situations and based on each step from low 
to high and from joint operations between two forces to many 
forces. Then, the next step is to organize maneuvers involving 
all the contents and requirements of building an all-people's 
national defense front at sea.

<F P=106> [Article by Nguyen Duc Lu, M.A., Ho Chi Minh National </F>
Institute of Politics] 
  [Text] Freedom of religion is one of the rights of people 
and citizens. This right, like other legitimate rights, must be 
respected on the legal, moral, and emotional fronts. 
  In Vietnam, there are many different religious beliefs and 
doctrines. In the nation's history of struggle and development, 
the religions have always remained close to the people; 
struggled against colonialism and imperialism to win national 
independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness, and freedom of religious belief; and strongly 
defended their beloved fatherland. The people in the religious 
zones, including those in the Catholic zones, compatriots, and 
missionaries have fulfilled their obligations as citizens, 
carried out their religious and worldly duties well, and 
contributed their strength and possessions, including their 
blood, to carrying on the resistance and building the country. 
Many children from religious families have taken up arms to 
fight, sacrificed their lives, scored glorious achievements in 
war, and been awarded many medals by the state. In today's 
renovation movement, many members of various religious groups 
are manifesting the "good life, good morals" tradition and 
exploiting their capabilities and intelligence to enrich both 
their families and society in order to achieve the goal of a 
"prosperous people, strong country, and civilized society." 
  The various religious beliefs certainly won't interfere with 
the ability of religious people to become integrated and work 
together with other people in the common revolution. The party 
and state have a correct religious policy. The various-echelon 
cadres, sectors, and localities truly respect the people's right 
of freedom of belief and will exploit the capabilities, 
intelligence, and strength of religious followers in the present 
renovation movement. 
  Unfortunately, in recent years, a number of places have done 
things incorrectly and even acted contrary to the party's and 
state's policy of freedom of belief. A number of cadres have 
exhibited feelings of distrust and acted in a narrowminded way 
and this has offended religious sensibilities and affected the 
religious freedom of believers. There are many reasons for those 
erroneous attitudes and acts, but one of the main reasons is the 
lack of understanding and immaturity concerning the issue of 
religion. Some people say that religion is a totally negative 
social phenomenon, and it should, therefore, be eliminated, the 
sooner the better. They regard religion as a type of drug that 
poisons the spirit of the masses. They do not see the rational 
factors in religion or the moral and humanistic values of 
mankind that must be protected and passed on. 
  In recent years in our country, along with the process of 
renovating and democratizing social life, the rapid growth of 
economic elements, the expansion of the market mechanism, and 
the tendency to cooperate with other countries having different 
political systems, there has also been a process of restoring 
and expanding religious activities. Concerning this, there is 
nothing to discuss, because this has to do with the rights of 
each citizen, and these rights are protected by the laws of the 
state. However, superstition, witchcraft, fortune-telling, and 
so on have spread rapidly. Publications that propagate 
superstition have flooded the market and can be found 
everywhere. They can be found among people of all age groups, 
occupations, level of education, and social position and even 
among cadres and party members. They cause people to have 
illusions about fate and believe that they aren't masters of 
their own fate but must entrust themselves to fate and spirits. 
Actually, there have been many distressing situations because of 
superstition, and some people have been deprived of their right 
to life. Such things are unacceptable. Thus, eliminating such 
activities is aimed at protecting people's rights. 
  Looking at things in a dialectical way, the present 
situation 
regarding religious life is both normal and abnormal. It is 
normal in the sense that this is the ordinary life of people and 
the legitimate rights of religious people. Our nation has 
recently passed through wars of national liberation. For a 
rather long period of time, because of the pressing and urgent 
target of winning national independence, people have been 
prepared to limit and even temporarily neglect their religious 
needs in order to concentrate on driving out the invaders and 
winning national independence. Today, now that the entire 
country is at peace and the tendency is to renovate and 
democratize all aspects of social life, spiritual needs, which 
include freedom of religion, are something ordinary and easy to 
understand. But this is also abnormal, because in religious life 
today, a number of people are using religion and freedom of 
religion to carry on political activities and spread 
superstitions in order to profit and carry out other evil 
actions. They are making use of loopholes or the mistakes of a 
number of cadres in a number of localities to slander the state, 
saying that the state is violating human rights. They are 
slandering the authorities in a number of localities, saying 
that they are oppressing Buddhists, and speaking out on behalf 
of a number of extremist elements in Buddhism. A number of 
people posing as Buddhists are creating social disturbances, 
obstructing communications, overturning and burning vehicles, 
and opposing those who are carrying out public services at Phu 
Xuan bridge in Hue City. It is very clear who is protecting and 
who is violating human rights. They even claim that they have 
made a list of more than 10 people who have set themselves on 
fire in order to protest the human rights violations. They have 
urged people to commit suicide. Not only have they violated the 
criminal laws, but they have also violated Buddhist tenets 
concerning killing. Furthermore, they have violated 
international human rights agreements. Article 18 of the 
International Agreement on Civil and Political Rights clearly 
states that "freedom of religious expression or religious belief 
can be restricted only by legal stipulations, and these 
restrictions must be necessary for maintaining safety, social 
order, public health or morals, or other basic freedoms of 
people." No country can, in the name of the rights of this 
person or group, abridge the rights of other people and groups. 
Guaranteeing human and civic rights must be tied to prosecuting 
those who violate those rights. Thus, protecting the rights of 
people and promptly prosecuting those who violate those rights 
are not mutually exclusive. In actuality, they supplement and 
support each other. This is a basic and obvious point that 
ordinary people can easily understand. 
  What is the real nature of the so-called "human rights 
violations and violations of freedom of religion in Vietnam" 
that enemies inside and outside the country are talking about? 
In their plot to carry on "peaceful evolution" to change the 
political system in the remaining socialist countries, they are 
giving particular attention to the banner of religion in order 
to deceive and arouse the masses. They say that in Vietnam, 
there is no party or political organization with the 
capabilities, discipline, and spirit equal to that of religious 
groups. Only believers have the spirit and courage to sacrifice 
themselves for their beliefs, because their faith helps them to 
ignore hardships and dangers. They say that "the end of the 
communist system in Vietnam will be decided primarily by 
religion." On the other hand, they are doing their utmost to 
distort and slander things using traditional arguments: 
"Communism is synonymous with atheism, and religion posits a god 
and so how can the two co-exist?" They say that "communism has 
declared war on religion." They have said such things in an 
effort to create a split between the party and authorities and 
people with religious beliefs and between believers and 
non-believers. 
  Thus, in reality, statements such as "Vietnam is violating 
human rights" and "religious oppression" are part of the 
political plot of the reactionary forces. They certainly do not 
want Vietnam to become a stable country so that it can strive to 
achieve the goal of becoming a "prosperous people, strong 
country, and civilized society" with a socialist orientation. 
They are intentionally closing their eyes and refusing to 
acknowledge renovation of understanding or the implementation of 
the party's and state's policies on religion. 
  The state has always had a unified policy of respecting and 
guaranteeing people's freedom to believe or not to believe and 
respecting spiritual values and traditional cultural life. The 
religious life of the people has existed since ancient times and 
will certainly continue to exist far into the future. 
Coexistence between believers and non-believers and between 
people of different faiths in the community is an objective 
fact. There has been a tradition of solidarity in building and 
safeguarding the country, and today, this is a source of 
strength in renovating, building, and defending the fatherland. 
Every follower of every religion is different in terms of his 
material life, but all share a religious life and the life of 
the times. Although people may have different beliefs, they are 
all equal in terms of rights and responsibilities before the 
law. There is no "orthodox religion," and the state does not 
regard any religion as a "heresy." It always respects the 
freedom of belief of all religions. This shows a respect for the 
human rights of each citizen. In building socialism, we have 
always emphasized refraining from influencing the inner feelings 
of people or rejecting the right of people to freely choose 
their own religious beliefs. 
  Thus, in the renovation process, as the party has affirmed, 
"religious beliefs are a spiritual necessity for some people. We 
must implement and unify policies on respecting and protecting 
freedom of belief, oppose actions that violate the freedom of 
belief, and at the same time oppose actions that make use of 
religious beliefs to harm the interests of the fatherland and 
people." This has been codified in state law in order to protect 
the rights of the people. Religious activities are social 
activities just like other social activities. Because it is 
responsible for controlling society, the state must examine and 
control the social aspects of religions. This is because besides 
its relationship to the church and the community that shares the 
same religious beliefs, a religion also has a relationship with 
and affects society. The state must not interfere with religious 
beliefs, but it is responsible for controlling the social 
aspects of religious activities using the laws. The main purpose 
of this is to protect the rights of citizens and the religious 
freedom of belief. 
  Religion is a delicate, complex, and profound social 
phenomenon in the spiritual, ideological, and emotional lives of 
many people in many generations. Religion is related not only to 
"ethical matters" but also to "matters of life." It is related 
not only to "the other life" but also to present life. There 
must be respect for freedom of belief, but at the same time, 
those who use this right for non-religious purposes must be 
opposed. We must respect people's freedom to believe, but at the 
same time, we must also respect people's freedom not to believe. 
  Respecting people's freedom of belief means respecting 
people's faith, religious ceremonies, and other religious 
activities that are in accord with national cultural traditions 
and improving the morals and character of people. We cannot 
accept counter-cultural or inhuman actions that are contrary to 
the legitimate needs of the masses and that lead to confusion, a 
lose of direction, passivity, and even violations of the law. 
  Respecting freedom of belief, which is one of the 
fundamental 
elements of the human and civic rights of people, does not mean 
allowing freedom to "burst out" in confusion and allowing the 
spread of every type of "heresy" along with today's open market 
mechanism. At the same time, human rights should not be relied 
on to revive and encourage backward customs that the people once 
voluntarily did away with. 
  As for believers, they are both elements of the religious 
community and citizens of a country. They have obligations and 
responsibilities both to their church and to their fatherland. 
They enjoy both human rights and the rights of citizens just 
like every other citizen. Thus, on one hand, they have the right 
to demand legitimate freedoms. On the other, they must struggle 
against those who violate and make use of those rights and 
contribute to building and defending the country so that it 
prospers.

  [Text] The newspaper LAO DONG on 28 April reported that 
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet held a working session with the 
chairman of the Song Be Provincial People's Committee regarding 
the illicit import of 273 cars. 
  After hearing leading comrades of the Song Be Provincial 
People's Committee criticize themselves for the wrongdoings they 
committed in legitimizing and allowing the operation of 273 
illicitly imported cars -- the responsibility for which rests 
chiefly with the chairman of the provincial people's committee 
and his deputies who were directly in charge of this case -- the 
prime minister asked the chairman of the Song Be Provincial 
People's Committee to scrupulously carry out self-criticism, 
report the results to the provincial party standing committee, 
and propose the form and extent of disciplinary actions to be 
taken against the provincial people's committee collectively. 
  As for the chairman and the two vice chairmen of the 
provincial people's committee directly involved in this case, 
they must scrupulously review their wrongdoings, propose the 
extent of disciplinary actions to be taken against themselves, 
for instance, resigning from their present positions so other 
comrades can replace them. This must be carried out in such a 
way as to ensure scrupulous law enforcement. 
  Those state organs such as tax, security police, customs, 
and 
trade organs in Song Be that failed to take preventive measures 
against this wrongdoing and to report it to higher management 
organs and that are found to be involved in the wrongdoings must 
also ascertain their specific responsibilities so appropriate 
disciplinary actions can be taken against them.

<F P=106> [Article by Tran Quoc Khai: "How to Motivate Domestic </F>
Capital: There Needs To Be an Appropriate Legal System"] 
  [Text] Our ancestors had the saying "To make paste, you 
need flour" when they wanted to say that to do something, we 
need the means. To do business, to carry out economic 
activities, we also need the means, that is, capital. In a 
symposium on economic development held in Ho Chi Minh City, a 
Japanese specialist has said frankly: "You want to find business 
partners? First of all you need to have money in your hand; 
then you have to have business management knowledge and market 
information, otherwise failure awaits you...". 
  It is true that if we do not have capital to the minimum of 
40 percent of the total investment capital for a joint venture, 
then we will be at a disadvantage. I was not surprised when I 
visited Shanghai in China, where the eastern region development 
project is being carried out. Foreign investment up to tens of 
billions of dollars capitalizes it; however, the state of China 
has also put in 130 billion yuan, or 50 percent of the total of 
capital, for that gigantic project, which is creating the "head" 
of the dragon for the whole east China region. 
  There are countless examples to prove that lack of capital 
means disadvantages for the economic development of the world's 
poor countries. The first victims were the African countries, 
who have, due to the lack of capital, `voluntarily' used their 
land and dirt-cheap labor to grow industrial plants as required 
by capital lending countries. The results have been shortages 
of food staples, exhausted soil, and an even more devastating 
situation than before. 
  One of our directors recently exclaimed that, two years ago, 
he had been too "enthusiastic" in searching for foreign partners 
to set up joint ventures. For capital, he borrowed from them 
half a million U.S. dollars, and they contributed another half a 
million dollars with the condition that the joint venture should 
import equipment chosen by them, and our director should take 
care of the sale of the produce. In exchange our director 
should agree to an export volume of agricultural products of 
2,500 tonnes. As a result our director received a loan and a 
bunch of obsolete equipment which had been newly-painted. Our 
director is of course awaiting his trial in court, but, to be 
fair, the state and people should shoulder this loss. He 
claimed that he did not embezzle even a cent into his own 
pocket; he was cheated and he had no capital to make a fair 
deal. Cases like this are happening quite often these days in 
our country. 
  Capital is essential for development in our country, a 
country devastated by many years of war. Many projects have 
been postponed just because funding was not available, and many 
of these projects were construction of infrastructure requiring 
large amounts of investment and a long capital recycling time. 
But if we do not strive for strong development of the 
infrastructure, we will not have conditions for economic 
development. In a recent visit to Dien Bien Phu, the local 
leaders told me that the local people supported the campaign to 
substitute poppy with other industrial plants. But when the 
people needed financial help, only about several hundred 
thousand dong for each hectare of land, the authority could not 
respond. Then the people told the leaders that they would 
supply their own plant and livestock species, but that the 
authorities should make more roads so they could barter their 
products with other localities. The authorities faced another 
stalemate since they had no funds to build more roads. 
  So where can we find the capital? 
  Some specialists estimate that there is about 20,000 billion 
dong of idle capital still in the hands of the people. Others 
say it is 40,000. In the last Tet Giap Tuat [New Year of The 
Dog] event alone, our Vietnamese compatriots from the U.S.A. 
brought home $36 million through Tan Son Nhat Airport (Ho Chi 
Minh City). Most of this money did not go into saving funds and 
state treasure, but was invested in land and real estate. 
Investment in land and real estate brings no benefit to the 
national economy. Some economic specialists have asserted that 
the land prices in Vietnam are unrealistically high. In some 
places the price was twice as expensive as compared with that in 
other countries in the area, thus creating another difficulty in 
the effort to attract foreign investment. 
  The success of the domestic capital motivation campaign is a 
criteria to measure the trust of people in the state. If people 
still do not trust [the state] and feel indecisive, it is almost 
impossible to urge them to bank their money in the state 
treasury, or to do joint business with the state. So the 
primary task the state needs to do is to create trust in the 
people so that they will be willing to put their money into 
developing the economy and building the country. There will be 
a thousand and one tasks to do, but the first thing we need is 
an appropriate legal system that protects the rightful benefits 
of the people. We should not repeat the situation in which the 
people who have deposited money in saving funds have nowhere to 
turn to when problems arise. 
  Secondly, we need to restructure our management to improve 
economic efficiency, so that the money people put in will secure 
a profit. We should not allow the current situation of many 
loss- making enterprises with their directors and cadres still 
earning enough to build new houses, buy new "late model" cars, 
and live even more "luxuriously". It is impossible then to 
persuade people to practice thrift for national construction. 
  We need to revise the following lesson: at the time when we 
had just regained independence, our national treasury was almost 
empty. President Ho Chi Minh urged all the people to save one 
meal and use the rice to help people who suffered hunger at that 
time, and he did it first as a model to others. Later when he 
again urged people to contribute money and gold to buy guns for 
national salvation, all the people gave their strong support. 
We should never forget this lesson; it should be the model for 
our activities.

  [Text] Jakarta, April 28 (ANEX/ANTARA)- Indonesian 
businessmen engaging in textile and textile products needed 
modernization in the post-multifibre agreement (MFA) era marked 
with tougher competition in the international market, said 
Minister of Trade Sastro Budiharjo quoting President Suharto as 
saying here on Thursday. 
  He briefed the head of state on the signing of the Uruguay 
Round in Marrakesh, Morroco recently. 
  Budiharjo told journalists that the abolishment of MFA 
resulted in the wiping out of quota system which arranges 
categories of textile and textile products of certain countries. 
  He added that the phasing out of quota systems until 2005 
will in turn lead to stronger competition made by China, 
Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. 
  "The government gives full support to Indonesian exporters 
of 
textile and garment," he said. 
  The elimination of MFA in stages for the last ten years has 
reduced quotas of certain categories of textile and textile 
products while increasing other categories of commodities, he 
noted. 
  Reporting to the President on importing rice from certain 
countries, he said that Indonesia was forced to do so as the 
Uruguay Round required all countries to open their markets. 
  However, he added Indonesia has a concession preventing 
excessive imported rice which may pose threats to local farmers' 
livelihood. 
  Indonesia, therefore, may import rice in case of lower 
prices 
of imported rice compared to those offered by domestic market, 
he said. 
  Indonesia, which is expected to import 70,000 tons of rice 
annually, will provide 90 percent of duty to the lower prices of 
imported rice. 
  The government will keep on protecting local businessmen 
while fulfilling the requirement of the Uruguay Round, he 
assured journalists raising questions on the possibility of 
importing of rice from a certain country.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Ali Alatas says the decision to 
repatriate Vietnamese refugees from Galang Island is not 
Indonesia's wish but is based on international consensus. 
Speaking at the end of a coordinated meeting for politics and 
security affairs in Jakarta yesterday, Alatas said Indonesia is 
only implementing several resolutions adopted at international 
forums. He also cited a comprehensive plan by the International 
Conference on Indochinese Refugees, ICIR, on the repatriation of 
Vietnamese refugees to their country of origin. 
  Only about 8,000 Vietnamese refugees currently held at 
Galang 
Island want to seek political asylum in a third country, while 
the majority who left for economic reasons must return to 
Vietnam. Alatas also said that the ICIR places special emphasis 
on screening Vietnamese refugees who really want to be resettled 
in a third country.

  [Text] Jakarta, Apr 28 (OANA/ANTARA) -- Indonesia's 
Western Regional Fleet Commander-in-Chief Rear Admiral Aried 
Kushariadi inaugurated the new amphibious squad and exercise 
fleet command here Thursday. 
  The two new units will strengthen the naval operation in the 
western region of the archipelago and will consolidate the 
so-called "integrated fleet system" of the Indonesian Navy. 
  The Western Fleet commander-in-chief also swore in the 
commanders of the new units -- Colonel Sumarjo appointed as the 
amphibious ships squad commander and Colonel Fakhmi Jamaris as 
exercise fleet commander. 
  The Western Regional Fleet was established in 1985, while 
the 
Eastern Regional Fleet has been in existence since the country's 
independence. 
  According to Kushariadi, two more squads will be set up -- 
the escort ships squad and the minesweepers squad -- following 
the arrival of 39 warships purchased by the Indonesian Navy from 
Germany. 
  Of the 39 warships, nine minesweepers, five corvettes, and 
three amphibious LSTs (landing ship tanks), have already arrived 
here.

  [Text] What is ABRI's [Armed Forces of the Republic of 
Indonesia] social-political role in the next five years? "ABRI's 
social-political role cannot be separated from a discussion of 
ABRI's dual function as a moral and political concept, given the 
background of its identity and the way it came into being," said 
Armed Forces Chief of Staff General (Army) Feisal Tanjung in a 
speech to Kostrad [Army Strategic Reserves Command] officers at 
Kostrad's 33d anniversary on Saturday (5 March). 
  The Armed Forces Chief of Staff said that as people's social 
life has grown more critical and has developed further, ABRI has 
to update its role as pioneer, stabilizer, and dynamizer in 
national life. "We carry out this role actively by making 
decisions about state and government problems, by developing 
Pancasila [Five Principles of the Nation] democratic life, the 
constitution, and the rule of law," said Feisal Tanjung. 
  To understand ABRI's social-political role in the widest 
sense, the Armed Forces Chief of Staff explained that what is 
needed is the ability to think within the general macrosystem 
which is integrated into the paradigm of Pancasila and the 1945 
Constitution. We must also think within the special microsystem 
of our ideological, political, economic, sociocultural, and 
defense-security life. "In order to anticipate problems, ABRI's 
social-political role must in fact be increased," said Armed 
Forces Chief of Staff Feisal Tanjung. 
  That is why every ABRI soldier is always aware that he plays 
both a defense and security role and a social-political role. 
Members of ABRI must lend support to creating conducive 
social-political conditions. The approach used must persuasively 
put forth arguments acceptable to all sides. "Avoid giving the 
impression that ABRI is showing off its power," the Armed Forces 
Chief of Staff asserted. 
  Armed Forces Chief of Staff Feisal Tanjung said that in the 
next five years ABRI's social-political role will take the form 
of a force of thought rather than a purely physical form. This 
means that ABRI personnel will have less of a presence in the 
executive and judicial fields. "Only strategic positions will 
still be occupied by ABRI personnel. However, ABRI will still be 
present in the legislative bodies, both at the federal level and 
in the provinces," said the Armed Forces Chief of Staff. 
  Armed Forces Chief of Staff Feisal Tanjung's speech 
reemphasized that ABRI will continue to push for a structured 
national and state life. "ABRI will continue to try to put the 
implementation of Pancasila democracy on a firm basis in order 
to create high quality, dynamic, creative, and responsible 
political superstructures and infrastructures," said Armed 
Forces Chief of Staff Feisal Tanjung.

<F P=106> [Article by Suryansyah: "Not Looking for Influence"] </F>
  [Text] Islamic boarding schools have been put to the test 
for a long time. The strength of these "institutions" lies not 
only in the area of education. Their influence has spread into 
the political arena as well. Islamic boarding schools have 
actually been influential since before the revolution. In fact, 
when there were kingdoms, Muslim scholars and Islamic boarding 
schools formed a clique which controlled royal actions and 
policies. For example, King Amangkurat I once killed about 6,000 
Muslim scholars in front of his people because they opposed his 
policies. 
  During the Old Order, an Islamic-oriented organization was 
part of almost every political party. For example, the Jam'iyyah 
Muslimin (JAMUS) was part of the PNI [Indonesian National Party]. 
  These tendencies went quite far. The Old Order embraced the 
Islamic masses in the Islamic boarding schools. Since that time 
all Indonesian political forces have been racing, as it were, to 
gain legitimacy through the Islamic masses. In other words, the 
Islamic boarding schools, the basis of Islamic strength, have 
been leading sources of support for votes and influence. 
  Is that true? The following is EDITOR's Usman Sosiawan's 
interview with Lt. Gen. (Army) R. Hartono, ABRI's 
social-political chief of staff. Hartono, former commander of 
Military District Command V/Brawijaya and governor of the 
National Defense Institute, is well known as a Madurese who is 
close to the Islamic boarding schools. We recorded some of his 
comments when we stopped him as he left a program on 
provisioning held at Makostrad [Kostrad Command Headquarters] on 
Friday 4 March. 
  [Sosiawan] What is your response to the Army chief of 
staff's 
visit to several Islamic boarding schools? 
  [Hartono] It's normal. The Army chief of staff is also the 
territorial developer. It's only natural for him to go there, to 
approach them, and to introduce himself. 
  [Sosiawan] There isn't any political intent? 
  [Hartono] No. It's one of the principles behind ABRI's 
territorial development. 
  [Sosiawan] Is it true that the Islamic boarding schools are 
considered of great potential importance for the support of 
political power? 
  [Hartono] Wait a minute. If you mean Islamic boarding 
schools 
in the sense of the word Islamic and if we start from the 
meanings of faith and devotion, they certainly are going to talk 
about state and national problems. In that case, what do you 
call it, political or what? It's political too. But we must 
remember that its involvement in politics is in fact determined 
by individual qualities, including the quality of those 
institutions themselves. 
  [Sosiawan] How far does their involvement normally go? 
  [Hartono] Well, they have education from, let's say as we 
generally understand it, from kindergarten to college. Clearly 
we're not speaking to their involvement. But should we provide 
them with an understanding of politics, which I think has to be 
given to them in the Islamic boarding schools? I say we have to, 
again referring to the faith and devotion that I mentioned 
before. That means, you know, that they must think about 
national and state problems. 
  [Sosiawan] There has been a tendency for some figures to 
reach out for sympathy from the Islamic boarding schools. Your 
comments? 
  [Hartono] Don't put it that way. 
  [Sosiawan] As an example, a number of ministers and even the 
president attended the RMI [Robithotul Ma'ahidil Islamiyah] 
meeting recently. What does that mean? 
  [Hartono] Don't make any connection between that and looking 
for influence or sympathy. It's not the case. It's like the Army 
chief of staff's recent visit to the provinces. As Army chief of 
staff, let's say it's because he's relatively new, he certainly 
has to visit and become acquainted with the provinces, including 
the territorial development units within them.

  [Text] Jakarta (BISNIS)--Bankers and securities companies 
hope the government will give guarantees to investors holding 
BAPINDO [State Trading Bank] bonds, because investors are 
disturbed by the conditions they see at the BUMN [state-owned 
enterprise] bank, which has been hit by a crisis. Several 
brokers and bankers told BISNIS yesterday that BAPINDO, which 
went public through the issuance of about 800 billion rupiah in 
bonds, must give guarantees to investors that their investments 
are safe. 
  "Holders of BAPINDO bonds are now generally disturbed," said 
a broker who did not want his name mentioned. In fact, he 
added, some of the bonds that were issued have fallen due, but 
many that have not yet fallen due are in the hands of investors. 
  "To reassure investors, there should be a statement from the 
government," he said. 
  Meanwhile, Mas Abdurachim Husein, chairman of the 
Association 
of Stock Brokers Representatives (AWP2E), said that it is 
difficult to sell BAPINDO bonds now. "To reassure investors, I 
also hope that there will be a statement from the government 
that BAPINDO bondholders are safe," he urged. BAPINDO has 
issued bonds seven times, the most recent in January of last 
year at a value of 300 billion rupiah. Those bonds were issued 
in series J and at both fixed and floating interest rates. 
  The fixed interest rate was 17.25 percent per annum for the 
first through the fourth interest coupons. Floating interest 
rates were in effect for the second, third, fourth, and fifth 
years and applied to the fifth through the 20th coupons, based 
on average interest rates for three-month time deposits at the 
State Savings Bank. 
  BISNIS sources at BUMN's in the sphere of the Department of 
Finance said that the arrest of three BAPINDO directors does not 
mean that they are suspects. "It is possible that two of them 
are suspects and that one is only a witness," he said.

  [Text] A DPR [Parliament] member has asked why Bank 
Indonesia, which under Law No. 7/1992 on banking is the only 
institution that supervises and oversees banking, is silent and 
has not given any explanation to the people about the crisis at 
BAPINDO. 
  B.P. Messakh, member of the DPR FKP [Functional Group 
Faction], feels that Bank Indonesia, as the only institution 
that supervises and oversees banking, should give an explanation 
to the public about the problem loans at BAPINDO. 
  "Why has Bank Indonesia never given any information about 
the 
BAPINDO case, despite the fact that under Law No. 7/1992, Bank 
Indonesia is the only institution that supervises and oversees 
banking? The minister of finance himself has not directly given 
any information, either," Messakh said yesterday at the DPR 
Building. Messakh also asked why Bank Indonesia has not 
announced the results of its supervision and oversight of 
BAPINDO, although the BUMN bank has been in the news for months. 
  "Should not Bank Indonesia have announced whatever its 
action 
has been against BAPINDO? If there is a bank that is not 
healthy, Bank Indonesia should know more about it than anyone 
else," the legislator said. 
  A similar thought was expressed by Sri-Bintang Pamungkas, 
member of the DPR's APBN [National Budget] Commission from the 
FPP [Development Unity Faction], who said that because Bank 
Indonesia is the institution that oversees the activities of 
BUMN banks, it naturally knew of the BAPINDO loan case before 
anyone else. 
  "Bank Indonesia should be the one to give explanation to the 
public. It is simply silent, however, although it certainly knew 
of the case first," Bintang asserted. The vocal DPR member 
feels that Bank Indonesia must be examined in connection with 
the BAPINDO case. "Bank Indonesia must be examined," he declared. 
  Bintang's basis for his statement was that because Bank 
Indonesia routinely oversees banking activity, including that of 
BUMN banks, it must give account of its oversight of BAPINDO. 
Bintang feels that Bank Indonesia people can be bribed, 
however. Thus, unsatisfactory conditions at a bank are made 
satisfactory. 
  Messakh also said that Bank Indonesia is the one that should 
know whether a bank is healthy and should also know what action 
is to be taken against such a bank, including BAPINDO. 
  Bintang thinks the DPR APBN Commission's request for 
cancellation of its meeting with the Bank Indonesia governor was 
"engineered," thus closing off any information from Bank 
Indonesia. The basis for the cancellation was that the questions 
the APBN Commission would have asked the governor would be the 
same as those asked by Commission VII. 
  "Oral questions from APBN Commission members would certainly 
differ from those of Commission VII, because their areas are 
different," Bintang asserted. Messakh said Bank Indonesia 
appears to have no role in the current BAPINDO case. "It is as 
though Bank Indonesia has no part whatever in the BAPINDO case," 
he said. 
  The former member of Commission VII, which handles finance 
and banking, also asked whether the Attorney General's Office is 
pursuing the person who leaked confidential information about 
Eddy Tansil's loan at BAPINDO. He asked why the person who 
leaked confidential loan information about Eddy Tansil is not 
being pursued, because from the criminal aspect that person 
violated the Banking Law, particularly with regard to bank 
secrecy. 
  "I agree that Eddy Tansil should be pursued, but there is 
clearly a criminal element in the leaking of bank secrets. Why 
has it been hushed up?" 
  The DPR member asked whether the Attorney General's Office 
has tried to trace the one who leaked the confidential 
information about Eddy Tansil's loan. A similar question was 
raised by Aberson M. Sihaloho, deputy chairman of the DPR APBN 
Commission. "The person who leaked the bank secrets should be 
tracked down," he said. 
<H5>  Foreign Bankers </H5>
  Meanwhile, people in the DPR also expressed the opinion that 
the use of foreign bankers to resolve the BAPINDO crisis is 
justified only to the extent that such use does not violate Law 
No. 7/1992 on banking, the provisions of which have yet to be 
spelled out in government regulations. 
  Abdullah Zainie, deputy chairman of the FKP, said that Law 
No. 7/1992 provides for the possible use of foreign personnel by 
domestic banks. 
  "As long as such foreign personnel are used only as 
consultants or advisers, it is all right to assign them to help 
BAPINDO managers or directors, but they cannot be used for 
executive jobs at the bank," Zainie said. 
  "I agree with the government's contracting with foreign 
bankers to improve BAPINDO management, as long as such contracts 
do not violate the Banking Law," Commission V member Bomer 
Pasaribu said yesterday at the DPR Building. 
  Bintang expressed the opinion that there will be no problem 
if the government wishes to establish BAPINDO management 
cooperation with a foreign bank as long as management is not 
delegated. "It would not be right to delegate BAPINDO management 
to a foreign bank!" Bintang declared. 
  Meanwhile, Messakh, a member of DPR Commission V, said that 
if the improvement of BAPINDO management is to involve foreign 
personnel or bankers, it must be learned which areas are 
permitted by Law No. 7/1992 on banking. 
  "In the clarification section of Law No. 7/1992, there are 
limitations and conditions on the employment of foreign 
personnel," said the former member of the special committee on 
the banking bill. 
  The conditions are to be spelled out in government 
regulations, Messakh said. "The conditions that are to be 
spelled out are specified in Law No. 7/1992," he added. Messakh 
invited the government to cooperate with foreign personnel to 
improve BAPINDO management, as long as such cooperation does not 
violate the Banking Law and is not contradictory to it. 
  A similar view was presented by Novyan Kaman, secretary of 
the FKP, who said that regulations should be drawn up before 
recruiting foreign personnel to improve BAPINDO management. 
  "If the government wants to improve BAPINDO management by 
contracting with foreign personnel, it will not be done in the 
near future, because the government will naturally wait for the 
regulations to be drawn up first." 
  They said these things as reaction to the plans of the 
minister of finance to recruit foreign bankers to improve 
BAPINDO management. Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad is 
expected to explain the plan in a working meeting with the APBN 
Commission today at the DPR Building. 
  Bintang said that besides asking about the finance 
minister's 
plan for BAPINDO management cooperation with foreign bankers, he 
will also ask about other problem loan cases, which involve 
about 50 big customers. 
  "If the resolution of just one problem loan case takes at 
least two months, then about 100 months, or eight years, will be 
needed to resolve 50 cases," he said. He feels that not all the 
capital of a BUMN bank needs to be owned by the government. As 
long as more than half the capital is owned by the government, 
it can be called a BUMN bank.

  [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] was studying Friday the meaning of North 
Korea's request for IAEA inspectors to be "present" when nuclear 
fuel rods are changed at its five-megawatt reactor. 
  The IAEA specifically wants to find out whether "presence" 
means simple "observation" or activity that would allow the 
collection of samples, a senior South Korean Government official 
said. 
  The IAEA will not accept the North Korean proposal if it 
just 
involves observation or limited participation. 
  In their negotiations in Vienna, the IAEA is demanding that 
its inspectors be allowed to collect samples of the waste 
material produced during the changing of nuclear fuel rods, the 
official said. 
  If the IAEA could collect samples of such waste material, it 
would be able to estimate how much plutonium North Korea had 
extracted since the five-megawatt reactor went into operation in 
1986. 
  "The IAEA is in contact with North Korea in order to find 
out 
the exact definition of the word 'presence' of IAEA inspectors," 
the official said, adding that the nuclear watchdog is expected 
to make a decision soon on Pyongyang's proposal after analyzing 
its political and technical intentions. 
  North Korea has not made its position clear on additional 
IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities, requested by the 
U.N. Security Council president's statement. 
  The official also denied press reports that North Korea had 
offered conditions to the United States on further IAEA checks.

  [Text] Washington, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will form two inspection teams to 
witness the changing of fuel rods at North Korea's 5-megawatt 
nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and plans to send the first one 
Sunday, diplomatic sources here said Friday. 
  As North Korea has already notified the IAEA that it will 
soon change fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor, an advance team 
leaves Vienna on Sunday and is to arrive in Pyongyang Tuesday to 
prepare for the refueling procedure. 
  The second team will depart for Pyongyang around Wednesday 
to 
push for full-fleged inspections including observation of the 
refueling, according to the sources. The second team's 
inspection activities, however, might be limited because North 
Korea is still resisting IAEA demands for additional checks such 
as collecting samples at a radiochemical laboratory, saying only 
that it will allow the inspectors to witness the fuel-rod change. 
  The United States will hold a working-level contact with 
North Korea next week to discuss the teams' scope of inspection 
duties in witnessing the refueling as well as additional checks 
of the radiochemical laboratory. They are also expected to 
discuss meeting the conditions for a third round of high-level 
talks. 
  The sources expected that the U.S. Government will hold a 
senior officials' meeting to chart a course on the nuclear issue 
and that it will urge North Korea to accept further checks to 
ensure that the next round of dialogue takes place. 
  Meanwhile, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said 
Washington can only hold the third round of talks with Pyongyang 
when the Feb. 15 agreement on the continuity of safeguards at 
North Korea's seven declared sites is implemented. 
  McCurry added, "... IAEA inspectors must be present to 
monitor the unloading and storage of this spent fuel. And we've 
made it clear from the very beginning that if the IAEA is not 
allowed to do this, we would have no choice but to end our 
dialogue with North Korea and return the issue to the Security 
Council."

  [Text] REUTER news agency has reported that it is unlikely 
that an International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection 
team will soon enter North Korea to witness the changing of fuel 
rods at North Korea's nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. 
  Denying ROK media reports that an advance team would leave 
for North Korea over the weekend, spokesman Kyd said those 
reports are groundless. Spokesman Kyd admitted that the advance 
team did prepare to leave for North Korea. However, since North 
Korea has not responded to a list of IAEA inspections so far, 
chances are slim that the team would arrive in North Korea by 28 
April, he added.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
initially planned to dispatch a two-person inspection team to 
North Korea early this week in connection with the replacement 
of nuclear fuel rods. However, North Korea has not allowed 
essential inspection activities. Thus, the IAEA decided to 
temporarily withhold dispatching the inspection team. 
  David Kyd, director of IAEA Information Department, said 
that 
the IAEA, when accepting the North Korean proposal concerning 
the replacement of nuclear fuel rods, demanded that North Korea 
allow essential inspection activities, and requested the 
issuance of visas for two inspectors to be dispatched as advance 
team members. 
  Director Kyd said that the IAEA urged North Korea to allow 
essential inspection activities pertaining to the replacement 
of nuclear fuel rods. He stressed that as long as North Korea 
does not show a change in its basic position, the dispatch of 
the inspection team will be withheld. 
  Director Kyd said, however, that if North Korea flexibly 
accepts the IAEA proposal by Thursday [28 April], the IAEA would 
consider dispatching an inspection team on Thursday.

  [Text] United Nations, April 28 (YONHAP) -- Pyongyang is 
ready to allow additional inspections by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] considering the latest change in the 
situation on an inter-Korean exchange of special envoys after 
examining the future attitudes of the United States and the 
IAEA, North Korean Ambassador to the United Nations Pak Kil-yon 
said in a press conference here Thursday [28 April]. 
  Pak seemed to be attaching a condition to the offer but his 
remark attracted attention since permitting further checks of 
its nuclear facilities would be considered a breakthrough in the 
lengthy impasse related to the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  South Korea recently withdrew the inter-Korean exchange of 
special envoys as a condition for a third round of high-level 
U.S.- North Korea talks. 
  North Korea previously maintained that any further 
inspections should be discussed at a third round of high-level 
talks with the United States. 
  Pak reiterated Pyongyang's position that the 1953 Armistice 
Agreement should be replaced by a peace accord between North 
Korea and the United States.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] has 
sent a telegram to North Korea and urged North Korea to allow 
inspection when it replaces nuclear fuel rods under the 
condition that the IAEA conducts sample-taking and surveys gamma 
rays later. The IAEA proposed that it will send a five-member 
team to North Korea early next week. 
  IAEA spokesman David Kyd said that although the IAEA sent 
this message to the North Korean side, there is no change in the 
IAEA's basic position to conduct essential inspection activities 
pertaining to the replacement of the nuclear fuel rods. 
  It appears that the IAEA, changing its previous policy, 
intends to conduct inspections in a flexible manner because it 
expects that there will be a change in the North Korean position 
according to the results of U.S.-North Korea contacts to be held 
in the future.

  [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- South Korea rebutted 
Friday North Korea's recent proposals to replace the Armistice 
Agreement with a peace treaty, saying the more immediate task is 
resolution of the nuclear row. 
  "The root of the cause to the present tension and 
instability 
of the Korean peninsula is in North Korea's nuclear suspicion," 
a Foreign Ministry official said in a commentary, "therefore, 
resolution of the nuclear problem is the priority task." 
  "North Korea should not attempt to blur the core of the 
problem at the present stage and fully cooperate in solving the 
nuclear problem," the official said. 
  Pyongyang leaders have recently stepped up their campaign to 
replace the armistice pact with a peace agreement, urging the 
United States to sit down for negotiations. 
  The armistice was signed at the end of the fratricidal 
1950-1953 Korean war, and the two Koreas are technically still 
at war in the absence of a peace treaty. Pyongyang insistently 
refused to talk to Seoul about the replacement, reasoning that 
South Korea was not a signatory to the armistice. 
  The Ministry official reminded that South and North Korea 
already agreed at their prime ministers' talks in 1992 that the 
two sides will work together to transfer the armistice into a 
peace pact. 
  Until then, the inter-Korean agreement says the two sides 
shall abide by the present military Armistice Agreement. 
  "The issue of establishing a new mechanism guaranteeing 
peace 
as proposed by the North is one that should be settled by South 
and North Korea as directly involved parties, based on the 
aforementioned agreement," the official said.

  [Excerpts] North Korea is undisguisedly trying to solve 
everything with its last nuclear card. During yesterday's 
working-level contact with the United States, North Korea 
proposed a peace agreement in exchange of the conditional 
acceptance of additional inspections. The United States did not 
accept the proposal. The following is a report by Chon Yo-ok: 
  [Begin recording] [Chon] In its attempt to provide a 
breakthrough in the relations with the United States blocked by 
the nuclear issue, North Korea suddenly proposed to replace the 
current Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement at 
yesterday's working-level contact. 
  The U.S. State Department plainly refused North Korea's 
proposal judging that it was intended to directly deal with the 
U.S. military representatives instead of the Military Armistice 
Commission. 
  After the contact, North Korea invited all foreign 
correspondents based in the PRC, except the ROK press corps, and 
held a news conference at the North Korean Embassy in China 
today strongly denouncing the United States. 
  [Pae Yong-chae, acting North Korean ambassador to China, 
identified by caption] The United States has unilaterally 
abrogated what was agreed upon in the Korean Armistice Agreement 
since it was signed in July 1953, and has introduced modern 
weapons, including over 1,000 nuclear weapons, into South Korea. 
  [Chon] [passage omitted] The appeasement gesture made by Pak 
Kil-yon, North Korean ambassador to the United Nations, saying 
that Pyongyang is ready to exceptionally allow additional 
inspections, was aimed at having a direct dialogue with the 
United States by proposing a peace agreement. North Korea's 
sudden change of attitude clearly reflects the limit of its 
unreasonable diplomatic policy in trying to solve everything 
with the only card -- the nuclear issue. [end recording]

<F P=106> [YONHAP report from New York] </F>
  [Text] The United States and North Korea held a 
working-level contact in New York early this morning and 
intensively discussed the presence of an International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team when North Korea replaces 
nuclear fuel rods, the additional inspection of a radiochemical 
experimental power station in Yongbyon, and the creation of 
conditions for holding a third round of U.S.-North Korean 
high-level talks. 
  Kim Chong-so, deputy ambassador at the North Korean mission 
to the United Nations, said that a contact with the U.S. side 
will be held today, and confirmed that dialogue between the 
United States and North Korea has been resumed. 
  Today's working contact is to be held after two months since 
the last U.S.-North Korean contact was held on 25 February, when 
the two sides agreed on the principle of inspecting declared 
nuclear facilities in North Korea. 
  Tom Hubbard, deputy U.S. assistant secretary of state, and 
other officials attended the contact for the U.S. side, and Kim 
Chong-so, deputy ambassador, and Han Song-yol, political 
councilor, represented the North Korean side. 
  At the contact, the U.S. side urged North Korea to allow an 
additional inspection of the radiochemical experimental power 
station and to create conditions for a third round of talks, 
stressing that the ROK side already withdrew the demand for the 
exchange of North-South special envoys--a condition for the 
third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks--and showed 
flexibility. 
  The United States also pointed out that North Korean nuclear 
activities should be frozen while the U.S.-North Korean dialogue 
is ongoing, and asked the North Korean side not to load 
[changchak] fuel rods again in the five-megawatt nuclear reactor 
in Yongbyon. The United States requested that the presence and 
inspection activities of the IAEA inspection team be 
sufficiently guaranteed. 
  The North Korean side, however, claimed that it kept all of 
the promises it made previously, including allowing all 
inspections to ensure continuity of safeguards of nuclear 
facilities. Thus, North Korea showed the position of resolving 
the issue of additional inspections, the issue of supporting the 
work of turning North Korean nuclear facilities into light-water 
reactors, and the issue of improving U.S.-North Korean 
relations, in a package, by convening the third round of 
U.S.-North Korean high-level talks at an early date.

  [Text] New York, April 28 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
United States met behind closed doors Thursday [28 April] to 
discuss a diplomatic solution to the dispute over Pyongyang's 
nuclear program, sources here said. 
  Washington expressed its willingness to hold a third round 
of 
high-level talks with Pyongyang as well as suspend "Team 
Spirit," the annual joint South Korean-U.S. military exercise, 
if North Korea permits additional outside nuclear inspections 
and agrees to resume inter-Korean dialogue. 
  The United States said North Korea should allow the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to observe the 
refueling of the 5- megawatt reactor at Yongbyon and satisfy the 
IAEA's calls for collection of samples and other technical work, 
informed sources said. 
  The State Department announced that at the working-level 
contact Thursday, the U.S. side conveyed a letter from Robert 
Gallucci, assistant secretary for political and military 
affairs, in response to a written message from Kang Sok-chu, 
North Korea's first vice foreign minister. 
  The State Department said it expects that North Korea will 
answer the letter soon. 
  Gallucci reportedly said in the message the United States 
will hold further high-level talks and suspend Team Spirit if 
North Korea maintains the continuity of nuclear safeguards by 
allowing additional inspections, the sources said. 
  North Korea did not present any new proposals, instead just 
listening to the U.S. position, but will likely disclose its 
stance at the next contact expected early next week, sources 
said. 
  The meeting was made at the request of the U.S. side. 
  The State Department's North Korea desk officer, C. Kenneth 
Quinones, led the Americans while the councilor at the North 
Korean mission to the United Nations, Han Song-yol, headed the 
other side. 
  The two nations agreed at their Feb. 25 contact that North 
Korea would accept IAEA inspections of seven declared nuclear 
sites, that they would hold a third round of high-level talks, 
that Team Spirit would be suspended this year, and that South 
and North Korea would exchange special envoys. 
  But North Korea refused to exchange special envoys and did 
not accept IAEA checks of a radiochemical laboratory, in effect 
breaking the agreement.

  [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- The Supreme Court 
rejected Friday an appeal by a 22-year-old American soldier 
charged with murdering a Korean bar girl, confirming the 
original sentence of 15 years in prison. The high court found 
Pvt. Kenneth Markle guilty of intentional murder and dismissed 
his plea of self-defense in view of the circumstances 
surrounding the murder. 
  As soon as it receives the ruling, the Justice Ministry will 
ask the delivery of the convict from the U.S. Forces Korea in 
accordance with the Korea-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) 
to put him in a juvenile prison in Chonan. Currently three 
American soldiers are confined in Chonan prison. 
  The U.S. side can reject Korean Government requests to claim 
soldiers, civilian employees in the military or their dependents 
accused of a criminal offense on the ground of "sympathetic 
consideration" provision of the SOFA but must comply with the 
requests when they are found guilty in a court of law. 
  The Korean prosecution originally sought to put Markle under 
its custody in view of the cruelty and inhumanness of his murder 
of Yun Kum-i in October 1992, but it had to indict him without 
physical detention since the American forces refused to turn him 
over in accordance with the provision. He is currently detained 
at a U.S. base here.

  [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Defense 
Minister Yi Pyong-tae signed a "memorandum of understanding on 
bilateral military exchanges between Korea and Russia '94-95", 
which puts emphasis on exchange of personnel, at a meeting 
Friday with his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev in Moscow, the 
South Korean Defense Ministry said. 
  Yi and Grachev talked about major international issues in 
Northest Asia, including Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, the 
ministry said. The two ministers shared the view that the 
suspected North Korean nuclear problem should be checked to 
ensure peace in Northeast Asia and that the North must return to 
the nuclear Non- proliferation Treaty to assume its 
responsibility as a member of international community, the 
ministry said. 
  The two agreed to enhance bilateral military cooperation 
including exchanges of students and military personnel, the 
ministry said. 
  In accordance with the agreement, Mikhail Kolesnikov, 
Russian 
chief of General Staff, will visit South Korea during the second 
half of the year while South Korea's vice defense minister and 
the Air Force chief of Staff will visit Russia next year, 
according to the ministry. Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev will reciprocate with his Seoul visit next year, the 
ministry said. 
  The two sides agreed that South Korean military officers be 
assigned to Russian military education centers to help them 
learn the Russian language and enhance understanding between the 
two countries, the ministry said. 
  South Korean Naval Academy cadets will also be allowed to 
call at Russian ports while on their tour of foreign countries 
in their training ships, the ministry said. 
  The two also exchanged views on Russia's idea of repaying 
Korean loans in kind, particularly in weapons, the ministry said. 
  During his stay in Russia, Yi will meet with Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
and other high-ranking officials, the ministry said. Yi will 
also visit major Russian military facilities including tank 
units before leaving for Germany on May 3.

  [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- Another moratorium has 
been granted to the outstanding debts Iran owes to South Korean 
traders. 
  A business source said on Friday that a visiting Iranian 
Central Bank delegation and representatives of South Korean 
creditors agreed on Thursday that the debts will be paid in 
three years and six months on an installment payment basis after 
two years' grace. 
  The outstanding debts Iran owed to major Korean firms 
totaled 
360 million dollars as of the end of last year. 
  Toward the end of last year, the two sides agreed on the 
payment of the debts in two years after a year's grace period. 
  When the 70 million dollars maturing this year are included, 
the total outstanding debts would total 430 million dollars, the 
source said. 
  This amount represents the debts Iran owes to those 16 major 
industries which maintain branch offices in Iran. When those 
owed to small Korean industries are counted, the total 
outstanding debts would easily run to more than 500 million 
dollars, he said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- The National Assembly 
failed to approve the newly appointed prime minister Thursday, 
the last day of the extraordinary session, but decided to extend 
the session by one day to try again. 
  At 11:15 p.m. Thursday, Speaker Yi Man-sop tabled a motion 
on 
approving the presidential appointment of Yi Yong-tok as prime 
minister and an opposition proposal that all members of the 
cabinet resign, but the plenary session could not vote because 
of an opposition filibuster. 
  With eight minutes left until the session's official 
adjournment at 11:52 p.m., the speaker acted on an opposition 
Democratic Party motion and extended the session by one day. 
  The National Assembly, hindered by disagreement between the 
ruling and opposition parties, could not break the current 
impasse as it refused to approve the new prime minister unless 
plans for parliamentary investigation of the Sangmudae scandal 
are approved at the same time. 
  The major stumbling block for the Sangmudae plans was an 
opposition demand to call 51 witnesses, including former 
presidents and current chief executive Kim Yong-sam, to testify 
in the Assembly. The ruling Democratic Liberal Party opposes 
the motion. 
  Another opposition proposal demanding the resignation of the 
entire cabinet was scrapped in accordance with the National 
Assembly law that calls for parliamentary action within 72 hours 
of a proposal. 
  Since the Kim administration could not obtain parliamentary 
approval of the new prime minister, the expected appointment of 
Yi Yong-tok's successor as deputy prime minister and head of the 
National Unification Board, as well as a possible limited 
reshuffle of the cabinet, will likely be delayed by one day. 
  Because of the political impasse at the National Assembly, 
the Kim administration has been without a cabinet administrator 
for one week. 
  The ruling and opposition parties plan to continue their 
negotiations Friday on the Sangmudae scam investigation. If 
they can work out a compromise Friday, the National Assembly 
will vote on the new prime minister before acting on the 
Sangmudae scam probe plans. 
  But the prospect of the rival parties agreeing on the 
Sangmudae scandal was still uncertain Friday morning. 
  The Democratic Party wants the National Assembly to 
investigate the Sangmudae scam, in which the president of a 
construction company created a slush fund out of the proceeds of 
the project for moving military facilities called Sangmudae in 
Kwangju to the city's outskirts. 
  The opposition party claims that part of the slush fund 
eventually was funnelled into the ruling party as campaign funds 
during the 1992 presidential election.

  [Excerpts] The National Assembly has passed a bill 
approving Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok's appointment. The 
appointment was passed with 170 of 180 ruling-party votes in 
favor. The following is a report by Ko Tae-hyon from the 
National Assembly: 
  [Begin Ko recording] Yi Yong-tok's appointment as prime 
minister was approved at 1850 [0950 GMT] by the National 
Assembly session attended only by lawmakers of the Democratic 
Liberal Party [DLP]. The appointment was passed with 170 of 180 
DLP votes in favor. The National Assembly session adjourned 
immediately after the prime minister's appointment was approved. 
Therefore, the 167th ad hoc National Assembly session was also 
automatically closed. [passage omitted] 
  The session began at 1833 with only the DLP lawmakers 
present. After the session began, Speaker Yi Man-sop said that 
he could not let the government administration vacuum continue 
and that, in his neutral position, his conscience forced him to 
proceed with the voting on the bill on approving the appointment 
of the prime minister. Speaker Yi then announced that the 
voting began. 
  At that time, some opposition party lawmakers who were in 
the 
assembly hall yelled at Speaker Yi asking for permission to ask 
questions but the voting continued. [passage omitted] 
  The session was scheduled to begin at 1400 today but the 
ruling and opposition parties agreed to postpone the session 
four times to seek a compromise regarding the appointment of the 
prime minister and the National Assembly's [Sangmudae] 
investigation. 
  Speaker Yi Man-sop notified the Democratic Party at 1730 
that 
if the Democratic Party did not let him know whether to accept 
the speaker's mediation proposal by 1800, he would unilaterally 
begin the session in virtue of his rights as the speaker. 
  The session was delayed for another 20 minutes because the 
Democratic Party asked for more time but it did not respond to 
Speaker Yi's mediation proposal. Speaker Yi entered the hall and 
announced the beginning of the session at 1820. [end recording] 
[passage omitted]

  [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- The National Assembly 
approved the president's selection of Deputy Prime Minister Yi 
Yong-tok as new prime minister Friday evening. 
  In a plenary session attended only by ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party members and a small number of independents, 170 
solons voted for Yi's appointment and 10 others against. 
  The opposition Democratic Party [DP] boycotted the session, 
reasoning that they couldn't accept the floor act only on the 
nomination of a new prime minister without dealing with the 
issue of witnesses and references with regard to the Sangmudae 
scandal. 
  In a party decision, most of the DP lawmakers stood away 
from 
the session while a few solons including Cho Hong-kyu and Chang 
Ki-uk strode into the hall and urged the speaker to stop taking 
the vote. 
  But, they did not mount any physical harassment. 
  Prior to the 6:10 P.M. session, the speaker arranged a last- 
minute bipartisan floor leaders meeting. However, they failed 
to reach any accord. 
  The ruling party suggested that the issue of whether to 
adopt 
20 undecided people out of the 50 witnesses and references 
produced by the opposition party be discussed later when the 
need of their testimonies arises. 
  The opposition party, on the other hand, wanted that the 
issue of the 20 people should be expressly settled forthwith 
without any further delay. 
  With the parliamentary endorsement of Yi Yong-tok's 
selection 
as new prime minister, the 167th extraordinary session of the 
National Assembly, whose legal period had been extended by four 
days, came to a close.

  [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- While observing the 
seemingly endless wrangling between the ruling and opposition 
parties, President Kim Yong-sam kept silent during the past week 
since he wanted the National Assembly to approve his new prime 
minister. 
  Moreover, Kim made no mention whatsoever of Yi Hoe-chang 
after he had the former prime minister step down for challenging 
the president's authority. 
  Kim has refrained from commenting on the former premier as 
he 
felt a deep sense of betrayal by Yi Hoe-chang, according to some 
Chongwadae [presidential offices] aides. 
  The chief executive, however, has by no means been inactive 
over the week. 
  He visited a precision-instrument factory in Ansan on Sunday 
and invited 58 "new Koreans," selected from various segments of 
society, to Chongwadae for talks on Tuesday. He praised them 
for setting a good example for the rest of the country. 
  On Wednesday, Kim presided over a meeting of the New Economy 
Promotion Committee at a Kwachon Government Building, showing he 
was concentrating on boosting the nation's economy and 
stabilizing consumer prices. 
  He then went down to Asan, South Chungchong Province, to 
attend a cermony marking the 449th anniversary of the birth of 
Admiral Yi Sun-sin and visited the grave of Yun Pong-kil in 
Yesan to pay his respects to the independence fighter. 
  Through all these activities, Kim may have wished to 
demonstrate to the people that their chief executive was busy 
even though the legislative branch was wallowing in one 
constroversy after another. 
  No one can say the president is in a happy frame of mind 
these days, said one aide. It is apparent, however, that he is 
determined to lead the nation no matter what. 
  But many officials at Chongwadae cannot deny that the past 
week seemed as long as a month, not because of a subdued 
president but because of the opposition Democratic Party's 
refusal to approve Yi Yong-tok as prime minister. 
  The administration has been caught in a vacuum, so to speak, 
throughout the entire week. The execution of national policies 
has been put off and most Chongwadae and government officials 
await the National Assembly's approval of their top 
administrator. 
  Chongwadae has stood ready since last Monday for a ceremony 
at which the president was to hand his credentials to the new 
prime minister, but had to postone it day after day. 
  There had been speculation that President Kim would not 
simply sit idle and leave the National Assembly in an 
unproductive mess. He must be contemplating some action, 
observers said. 
  He would surely act as soon as the National Assembly 
approved 
his prime minister, they said. 
  In other words, the president had no intention of allowing 
the government to limp along in approving the prime 
minister-designate. He would patiently wait for the National 
Assembly to finally come to its senses and give him a 
full-fledged prime minister. 
  "That is the Kim YS style -- the great and orthodox path," 
one commentator said. 
  As soon as Yi Yong-tok is approved as prime minister, the 
president will consult with him and name Yi's replacement at the 
National Unification Board. There may be a limited reshuffle of 
the cabinet as well. 
  But since the current difficulty -- or "national crisis" as 
the opposition party calls it -- resulted from the resignation 
of Yi Hoe-chang, his replacement will put the government back on 
track. No more personnel changes are needed, they said. 
  In fact, some observers believe that President Kim will 
retain all of his senior presidential secretaries at Chongwadae 
and change very little in the cabinet, leaving its framework 
intact. 
  At the first cabinet meeting to be followed by a reshuffle, 
the president will likely ask his ministers to rally around the 
new prime minister and work for his administration's overriding 
goal of reform.

  [Text] "It is questionable whether numerical targets can be 
achieved even by China, which has a planned economy." These 
were the words used by a senior PRC official speaking about the 
numerical targets demanded of Japan by the United States in the 
Japan-U.S. economic consultations. The Chinese official was 
speaking at a high-level working-level meeting held between the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the PRC 
State Economic and Trade Commission at the MITI for two days up 
to 26 April. 
  The official supported Japan's position in the economic 
consultations, saying--as if citing from a textbook on 
capitalism--"It is the market which decides which products are 
sold in what quantities." He also spoke about the U.S. stand of 
attaching human rights questions to the issue of extending 
most-favored-nation [MFN] status [to China], and he criticized 
the United States, insisting, "It would be meaningless if the 
United States were to impose its way of doing things on us." 
  Japan avoided making any comment on the U.S. human rights 
diplomacy, but a top MITI official who has borne the brunt of 
criticism from the United States [in the economic consultations] 
for so long looked very pleased by this unexpected friendly 
"yell" from China. He said, "There is an expression: One 
million troops have arrived to help us. I felt as though I had 
1.2 billion troops who had arrived to help us."

  [Text] For Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, a 
strong advocate of free trade, the provisions of Asean Free 
Trade Area (Afta) are already outdated. 
  Speaking at an Afta conference at the United Nations 
building 
in Bangkok yesterday, Suphachai told hundreds of influential 
Asean economists that "the Afta agreement should be modified". 
  He said he was not satisfied with Afta, both in terms of its 
long timespan, its limited range of products and its restrictive 
regulation for new membership. 
  The "Afta and Beyond: An Asean Perspective" seminar was 
jointly organized by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia 
and the Pacific (Escap), the Thailand Development Research 
Institute (TDRI) and Queen's University, Canada. 
  Suphachai viewed Afta as an attempt by the Asean Six to 
consolidate their bargaining position -- amidst a feeling of 
"grim hope" about the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of 
multilateral trade talks -- by reaching a regional free trade 
agreement. "(But) as the Round has successfully been concluded, 
the (original Afta) requirements might not be well suited to 
1994," he said. 
  Suphachai, who represented Thailand at the latest Asean 
informal economic ministerial meeting in Malaysia earlier this 
month, said he was disappointed with Afta's slow progress. The 
Asean economic ministers had met on an informal basis to speed 
up the Afta process and Suphachai had hoped to push through a 
shorter timeframe. 
  However the Asean ministers missed the opportunity to 
announce a new Afta time-frame, even though it had been widely 
speculated that the deadline would be reduced from 2008 to 2003. 
A statement from the meeting said the Asean ministers simply 
agreed that senior officials would review "the implementation of 
Afta". 
  "But (they did not) agree on a particular year," Suphachai 
said. 
  Asean leaders agreed last year to cut tariffs on Asean 
manufactured goods to 0 to 5 per cent over a 15 year period. 
Suphachai, though, insisted that "the Afta time-frame should be 
shorter (because) the period is too long compared to Gatt and 
Nafta". 
  The members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(Gatt) agreed last month in Marrakech to cut tariffs on 
manufactured goods by one-third over a 10-year period. 
  Moreover, the range of commodities that fall into the Afta 
tariff cut basket should be expanded, especially to include farm 
goods. Non-processed farm products are excluded from the Afta 
tariff cut requirement. 
  "This may be no longer appropriate," Suphachai said, citing 
Gatt and the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) 
requirements where the tariffs on farm goods would have to be 
cut over specific timeframes. 
  If Asean continues to ignore the farm sector in its regional 
free trade plan, "it might jeopardize Asean attempts to become a 
leader in farm trade at the World Trade Organization (which 
supersedes Gatt next year)", Suphachai said. 
  On expanding Afta's membership, Suphachai recalled his 
"bitter" experience in unsuccessfully persuading his 
counterparts to accept Australia and New Zealand as new partners. 
  "Asean ministers agreed to discuss the linkage between other 
regional groupings with Afta, but they avoided naming names," 
Suphachai said. 
  Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating stated a clear 
intention to join Afta during his recent visit to Bangkok. But 
Malaysia's International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah 
Aziz has strongly opposed the move. 
  "Asean is not a free-for-all organization," she was quoted 
as 
saying. 
  Without referring to Australia, Suphachai expressed 
disappointment at the Malaysian minister's stance. "It's rather 
ironic," he said. "The trend is that Asean is trying to 
persuade some of its neighbours that they are not ready to join 
Afta, but ignores other countries that are." 
  Some experts view Afta with scepticism. On the meeting's 
panel yesterday, Richard G Harris, from Simon Fraser University, 
Canada, questioned how much could Asean have done to open up the 
regional free trade area, as the grouping has to overcome 
factors which have been its engine behind a flourishing growth 
rate of Asean exports in the last decade -- or "export-oriented 
protectionism" to support export promotion policies. 
  He said the economies of many highly successful East Asian 
countries were and continue to be protectionist, although at 
considerably lower levels than before, domestic markets for 
finished consumption goods are rather heavily protected. 
Intermediate products and basic industrial raw materials, such 
as steel and petro-chemicals, are also quite heavily protected, 
with capital goods less so. 
  Although the protection measures have succeeded in promoting 
rapid growth of manufactured export products, it has led to a 
relatively peculiar structure of export production. 
  "This pattern has meant, among other things, that the direct 
contribution of exports to economic growth has been quite small. 
In Thailand, for instance, the aggregate contribution of 
exports to economic growth declined in the later 1980's and 
early 1990's due to the high cost of exports," he said. 
  Moreover, local exporters preferred to have a high local 
content requirement to avoid direct competition with foreign 
companies. "This has led to protectionism and created the 
artificial structure of export production." Dr Narongchai 
Akrasani, the Afta architect, however, suggested Asean can 
achieve the free trade by working hard on its own regional free 
trade area. 
  "(But) we will not have the free trade area under the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation or under the World Trade 
Organization in the year 2010," he felt. 
  Due to strong internal political pressures, more powerful 
countries cannot support free trade at a global level, no matter 
what they have said, Narongchai claimed. 
  As such, Asean should achieve a free trade area by itself 
with Afta, he said.

<F P=106> ["Statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the </F>
Kingdom of Thailand"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has observed that 
many countries have promulgated laws and regulations, which, de 
facto or de jure, have led to the seizure of foreign fishing 
trawlers or the imprisonment of foreign fishermen on charges of 
violating the laws and regulations on fishing in their exclusive 
economic zones. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs therefore wishes to give 
general notification of the Thai Government's position in this 
regard as follows: 
  The seizure of fishing trawlers and the imprisonment of 
fishermen are blatant violations, both in letter and in spirit, 
of Clause 72, paragraphs two and three, of the UN Convention on 
the Law of the Sea of 1982. All countries concerned are obliged 
to faithfully abide by the convention as signatories to the 
legislation or as countries which have given their ratification 
of the convention. In particular, the said UN convention is to 
become effective from 16 May 1994. 
  Therefore, the Thai Government has to lodge a strong protest 
through the UN secretary general, in his capacity as the 
custodian of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982, 
over the said seizure of trawlers and imprisonment of fishermen. 
  Thailand hopes that those countries will amend their laws 
and 
regulations in compliance with the obligations enshrined in the 
said convention, which they have already accepted.

<F P=106> [By Shalom Mapagu and Ellen Tordesillas] </F>
  [Text] Legislators from the People's Republic of China 
yesterday told their Filipino counterparts that there is no 
reason to be alarmed over reports that the People's Republic of 
China has increased its military budget by 20 percent. 
  This, they said, did not mean there was an arms buildup in 
the disputed Spratly Islands or anywhere else in the region. 
Rather, the increase was dictated by inflation. 
  "The cost of goods are rising in China," said Zhu Liang, 
chairman of the foreign affairs and defense committees of the 
PRC's National People's Congress. 
  The Spratlys are being claimed in part or wholly by the 
Philippines, PRC, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, and Vietnam. The 
Philippines and Vietnam have repeatedly expressed concern over 
reports that China has been increasing its military presence in 
this disputed territory. 
  "Reports that we are expanding our military capabilities 
have 
been reaching the West. We think this is nothing but rumor," 
said Zhu Liang. 
  The Chinese legislator said disputes between PRC and other 
countries "should be settled through peaceful negotiations." 
  Zhu Liang emphasized that the Mainland China opposes 
military 
aggression. "Not now, not even in the future," he said. 
  Liang was accompanied during the meeting with Filipino 
legislators by six of his colleagues in the National People's 
Congress. 
  He met with the House Committee on Foreign Affairs chaired 
by 
Rep. Jaime Lopez (Laban [Lakas ng Bayan -- People's Power], 
Manila). 
  Lopez hoped the Philippines' partnership and cooperation 
with 
China "will succeed very soon." He expressed confidence that 
China's participation in the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade would greatly enhance trade potentials in the Asia-Pacific 
Region. 
  In the Senate, Sen. Blas Ople yesterday said the "wound" 
inflic??e recent visit here of .se President Li Teng-hui on 
Philippine-China relations has apparently been healed as 
manifested by the current visit of the Chinese parliamentarians. 
  Ople, who accompanied the visiting parliamentarians to 
Malacanang yesterday, said, the visit "means they have given 
time for these irritations to heal." 
  The parliamentarians were scheduled to come February but 
canceled it when President Ramos received Li who passed by Subic 
Bay last 9 February. 
  "This means that Philippine-China relations can withstand a 
few challenges from time to time," Ople said.

  [Text] The Philippine Embassy in Kuala Lumpur is asking 
the government to formally ask Malaysia to grant executive 
clemency for humanitarian reasons to three Filipinos who were 
meted death sentences for drug trafficking in Sabah two weeks 
ago. 
  Officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs yesterday 
said 
the recommendation sent by Ambassador to Malaysia Alberto 
Encomienda will be submitted to President Ramos who will decide 
whether formal representations will be made regarding the issue. 
  The plea hangs in the balance, this early though, as Ramos 
yesterday issued a statement that drug traffickers should not 
expect any pardon from him. 
  At the fifth ASEAN workshop for nongovernment organizations 
for the prevention of drug and substance abuse held in 
Malacanang [presidential office], Ramos said, "Let me clearly 
indicate that I will interpose no objection if any person, so 
convicted, is sent to the electric chair or gas chamber." 
  Last 14 April, the Malaysian Supreme Court ordered the 
hanging of Japlin Jimlok, Benny Saman, and Gan Muslimin, all 
based in Kota Kinabalu, after they were convicted of drug 
trafficking by the High Courts in Sabah. The three Filipinos 
are now awaiting their execution at the Kapaya State Prison in 
Sabah. 
  On the same day, nine other Filipinos, including a woman, 
had 
their death sentences reduced to life imprisonment for the same 
offense. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo said Ramos has 
ordered Philippine officials in Kuala Lumpur to look into 
reports that a number of imprisoned Filipinos in Sandakan, Sabah 
were tortured by police and prison authorities. 
  Last 21 April, 11 Filipinos who were deported and imprisoned 
in Sandakan complained that other Filipinos currently serving 
jail terms in Sabah are also subjected to various forms of 
torture like having their heads banged on walls and dunked in 
toilet bowls, and their skin carved off the soles of their feet.

Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, 
with unidentified NHK correspondent on 21 April; place not 
given; from the "NHK News" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] In an NHK interview on 21 April Camdessus, managing 
Director of the International Monetary Fund, strongly urged 
Japan and the United States to improve their relations, saying 
that economic friction between Japan and the United States has 
negative impact on the world economy. 
  [Begin recording] [Camdessus in English, with Japanese 
subtitles] The world has nothing to gain from the dispute. We 
know that the two countries are responsible countries, and they 
will do everything they can to solve this dispute. [end 
recording] 
  Camdessus also stressed that the important thing is for 
Japan 
and the United States to meet halfway. 
  Moreover, he said the United States needs to exert efforts 
to 
reduce its trade deficit, and Japan needs to expand domestic 
demand and open its markets. 
  While asking Japan to continue to introduce economic 
stimulus 
measures, Camdessus said further appreciation of the yen's value 
will hinder economic recovery in Japan. He pointed out the 
importance of cooperation among the developed countries for 
stability of the foreign exchange market. 
  A meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the 
Group of Seven [G-7] major industrial nations will be held in 
Washington on 24 April. It can be said Camdessus, who will act 
as referee at the meeting, made the recent remark while feeling 
a strong sense of anxiety that Japan-U.S. economic frictions may 
weaken the G-7 member nations' conciliatory stand in the fields 
of foreign exchange policies and economic measures.

  [Text] Washington, April 22 KYODO -- The United States 
will welcome the opportunity to resume stalled framework trade 
talks with Japan following the installation of a new government 
in Tokyo, a top White House official said Friday [22 April]. 
  "We would very much welcome the opportunity to continue 
discussion at an appropriate time," Robert Rubin, director of 
the White House National Economic Council, said. 
  Rubin made the remarks following reports from Tokyo that 
Japan's ruling coalition parties have decided to back Tsutomu 
Hata, currently the foreign minister, as their candidate to 
replace outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  A vote by Japan's parliament is scheduled for Monday. 
  Rubin told reporters he is aware that Hata has been chosen 
as 
the prime ministerial candidate, but declined to comment whether 
Hata's elevation to the prime ministership would bring changes 
to the troubled U.S.-Japan economic relations. 
  "We have enormous respect for Japan... Our relations with 
Japan are extremely important to us in all respects, including 
economics," Rubin said. 
  In an address he made earlier in the day to a group of 
American business executives, Rubin reiterated that the U.S. is 
not seeking "quotas" or "market shares" for U.S. products in 
Japan. 
  "We are dedicated to try to gain fair access to sell in 
Japan," he said.

  [Text] Mr. A, 25, a Chinese man who borrowed videotapes of 
public executions from PRC authorities which were used in a TV 
Asahi (president, Kunio Ito) special news program "The Scoop" 
and which allegedly proved to be "fabricated," answered SANKEI 
SHIMBUN's questions in a telephone interview from his hiding 
place in South America on 24 April. 
  During the interview, Mr. A admitted he had appeared as an 
armed policeman in the program, had been investigated by the 
authorities after the program was aired for disclosing state 
secrets, and had subsequently fled to South America. He also 
revealed that his mother, who is a public security cadre, was 
the one who actually borrowed the video footage; she and a 
number of others who helped in filming the Asahi program were 
later arrested. He also admitted that this affair has had 
serious consequences. 
  Mr. A acted as coordinator (interpreter and guide) who 
sub-subcontracted for Asahi's subcontractor production which 
conducted location shooting in Fuzhou in Fujian Province, China. 
Mr. A's interview was conducted for approximately one hour with 
Tadao Kasahara, president of "Damu" [name as published], the 
production which produced the news program in question. 
  On 2 April, TV Asahi used up all its air time for "The 
Scoop" 
to look into the above program in question. It admitted the 
special program had been fabricated. However, the interview 
with Mr. A was the first time Asahi admitted fabrication after 
trouble occurred in China over how the video footage was 
obtained. TV Asahi will now have to deal with the consequences.

<F P=106> [First two paragraphs are SANKEI SHIMBUN introduction] </F>
  [Text] Some people involved in obtaining "The Scoop" video 
footage have been arrested. In connection with the "fabrication 
of facts" in TV Asahi's special news program "The Scoop," in an 
interview on 24 April, the Chinese coordinator, Mr. A, 25--who 
obtained videotapes on public executions from the PRC 
authorities--testified to SANKEI SHIMBUN that the authorities 
had investigated his family members, friends, and acquaintances; 
his mother, who actually borrowed the videotapes; and, that a 
number of others who helped in filming the news program had been 
arrested. Regarding his fleeing to South America, Mr. A said: 
"I will be a dead man if I am arrested." "I do not know what I 
am going to do from now on." 
  Mr. A came to Japan on an educational visa in autumn 1991. 
While studying at a Japanese language school in Tokyo, he took 
advantage of his experience and connections to work as 
coordinator for media coverage in China. He returned to his 
hometown Fuzhou city temporarily to assist in filming the 
program in question. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] In Japan, they say you testified that you 
wore the uniform of an armed policeman and acted as one in the 
program. 
  [A] That is true. I said that. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Where did the video footage on the public 
executions come from? And how did you obtain them? 
  [A] I asked assistance from my mother, who is a public 
security cadre, and she borrowed them from a certain official of 
the judiciary. I dubbed them at home and handed the tapes over 
to Kasahara [Tadao Kasahara, president of the subcontractor 
production outfit which actually produced the news program]. He 
later told me: "What I brought home was unacceptable," so I 
again borrowed other tapes, dubbed them, and brought them back 
to Japan personally. These were the ones used in the program. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] How much money did you get for this job? 
  [A] All in all, around 2 million yen. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] When and how did you leave Fuzhou? 
  [A] I left Fuzhou on 25 September 1993. A friend of mine 
who works for the authorities had called and told me "you are in 
danger." I immediately took a taxi to Shenzhen. From there, I 
went to Hong Kong, and returned to Japan on 27 September. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] How did you keep yourself informed? 
  [A] I have some old friends still working for the 
authorities. My elder brother, who is in hiding in China, 
sometimes telephones me. After I returned to Japan, I stayed 
with members of the TV program production staff and other 
Chinese friends. I was also in contact with my elder brother 
and friends, through trusted friends. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] When did you leave Japan? 
  [A] On 24 December. I was told that five men had been sent 
to Japan to arrest me. I was frightened so I went to see 
Kasahara and the TV Asahi people, but none of them wanted to see 
me. The video footage on public executions is a state secret. 
If I get caught, I will be sentenced to death. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] How will you make a living from now on? 
  [A] I still do not know what to do. I have three fake 
passports, but I think I will have to buy an authentic one.

  [Text] According to a military source, the U.S. 
imperialists and puppets on 26 and 27 April staged a provocative 
joint aerial surprise attack exercise simulating a Northward 
invasion with the skies above Yongwol, Umsong, Kunwi, and Yoju 
in South Korea as the operational stage. 
  Pacific-based fighter-bombers, pursuit-assault planes, 
vertical takeoff and landing assault planes, tanker planes, and 
an early- warning plan, and flying groups of the U.S. Air Force 
present in South Korean and the puppet Air Force, were massively 
mobilized in this war exercise, which lasted for two successive 
days. 
  The exercise was frenziedly staged under the command of an 
E-3 early warning plane, which is called the air-flying command 
post, with KC-135 tanker plane supplying fuel in the air. The 
purpose of this war exercise was to ensure the unified command 
of various attack airplane wings and to enhance combat-ready 
capabilities for cooperative surprise attack between the U.S. 
Air Force and the puppet Air Force. 
  On the other hand, the South Korean puppets frantically ran 
amok with artillery firing and helicopter operational exercises 
in areas close to the demilitarized zone [DMZ] in the military 
demarcation line. 
  The armed helicopter groups, which were mobilized in the sky 
above Paengnyon, Paju County, on 27 April, frenziedly staged a 
missile strike exercise, and armed helicopters and transport 
helicopters, which flew in the skies above Paju and Yonchon, and 
areas in Chorwon, South Korean Kangwon Province, ran wild with 
ground support exercises while making a low-altitude ultra 
low-altitude flights. 
  On 26 and 27 April, large-caliber artillery groups of the 
puppet Army in Chongda-ri and Yongsan-ri, Paju County, and 
Oksan-ri, Yonchon-up, Yonchon County, and Yulli-ri, Chorwon-up, 
Chorwon County in South Korean Kangwon Province, fired more than 
100 shells into spots near the DMZ in front of our eyes, thus 
running amok with war frenzy. 
  These successive dangerous war gambles of the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean puppets timing to coincide 
with the "Hwarang" war exercises involving 1 million and 
hundreds of thousands of troops and civilians are further 
straining the situation on the Korean peninsula.

national programe for primary healthcare. He affirmed that the 
Vietnamese Government will strongly support the projects the 
delegation agreed to cooperate Vietnamese partners to carry out 
in Vietnam. He expressed his wish to see these projects quickly 
materialized so that all Vietnamese could have enough clean 
water in a near future. For his part, President (Amyn Dahya) 
assured the prime minister that Vector Venture will provide the 
best equipment to the projects and implement as soon as it can 
the transfer of technology to Vietnam.

  [Text] Washington, April 22 (YONHAP) -- Pyongyang cannot 
accept an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) proposal for 
inspection of its radiochemical laboratory, a senior North 
Korean official said Thursday. 
  Kim Chong-su, deputy chief of the North Korean mission to 
the 
United Nations, said Pyongyang is willing to allow IAEA 
inspectors to witness the changing of fuel rods at the Yongbyon 
nuclear reactor, but that it cannot accept additional checks of 
the radiochemical laboratory. 
  He said, "We have allowed every inspection to ensure the 
continuity of nuclear safeguards. We have shown everything to 
the IAEA, and the proposal for additional inspection of the 
laboratory is an absurd demand." 
  North Korea sent a message to the agency Wednesday proposing 
that IAEA inspectors witness the upcoming changing of fuel rods 
at the country's five-megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.

  [Text] Yesterday in Sarajevo, the Croatian-Muslim Assembly 
finally and formally abolished Bosnia-Herzegovina as a federal 
unit of the former Yugoslavia, Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of 
the Assembly of the Srpska republic, said. We may all be 
pleased with this act. The former Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer 
exists and, due to this fact, we are altogether at a great step 
closer to peace, Krajisnik pointed out.

<F P=106> [Address by Kresimir Zubak, leader of the Herceg-Bosna </F>
Croats, to the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly in Sarajevo on 30 
March -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed Presidency, ladies and gentlemen, 
deputies, and guests. We are drawing close to the moment when 
you gentlemen and lady deputies in the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Assembly -- in line with your rights and duties -- have to 
decide with your vote on what we, as representatives of the two 
peoples, agreed on and signed in Washington, which is contained 
in the draft constitution before you for adoption. 
  I have no doubt that today you will -- as individuals and as 
delegations of the Croatian and Bosniak peoples, or others -- 
give your vote and endorse our agreement. I share the hopes and 
convictions of all of you that -- after we adopt the 
constitution, which is to take effect tonight at 2400 -- we will 
start to implement it. Then your decision of today, and I have 
said that I am convinced that you will endorse it, will not only 
be a solemn act but also a historic moment, and you have the 
honor to be historic participants in this act. 
  Both during the signing and the coordination of views 
concerning the contents of the constitution, I have stressed -- 
and I have the right to say this in the name of the Croatian 
people -- that the Croatian people are ready and willing to 
implement fully the agreement contained in the draft 
constitution. I would also like to say -- and express my 
gratitude at the same time to the delegation of the Bosniak 
Muslim people -- that through the coordination of views, and 
after long and exhausting talks, we have as a result a draft 
constitution that I am sure will enable us to realize all the 
interests of the Bosniak and the Croatia people. 
  For that reason I appeal to you and call on you today to 
cast 
your votes as deputies for the reconstruction of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina according to the principles envisaged in the 
document.

<F P=106> [Address by Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Vice President </F>
Ejup Ganic to Bosnia-Herzegovina Constituent Assembly in 
Sarajevo on 30 March -- live] 
  [Text] President Izetbegovic is presently holding talks 
with the U.S. delegation, so I would like to greet you on his 
behalf and my own, and to stress something that I have noticed 
here, chatting to people I have not seen for a long time. You 
see, many problems have been solved. Two nations have agreed to 
go for the reconstruction of Bosnia as an integral state. I 
have not heard a single ugly word from any representative of the 
Croatian people or the Bosniak people about the Serbian people 
during our socializing here. 
  Now when one thinks about it and takes into account that 
there are some 500,000 to 550,000 Serbs on the territory 
controlled by that army of Karadzic's, that there are some 
200,000 Serbs who stayed with us to defend Bosnia, and that many 
have left, I would like to send them a message: They should 
integrate all their forces and we will make an effort to talk 
with all of them, both with those who have left Bosnia, and of 
course those who are with us -- we cooperated on a daily basis 
-- and with those who are armed and failed to show loyalty to 
the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This agreement, this agreement 
that has been reached, it is not to anyone's disadvantage. This 
is an agreement of equal opportunities and rights for the three 
nations, and all the other nations. 
  I have said this before: One of the negotiators has said 
that the integral Bosnia will be saved when first two of the 
nations agree. However, I think there are more than two 
nations, that there are (forces) in the Serbian people, but they 
have to be integrated, they have to articulate their views 
[words indistinct] an integral Bosnia, since the (blood) of that 
nation has been spilt here, their historical monuments are here, 
their shrines -- just as the culture of the Bosniak people, 
their monuments and their shrines spread throughout the 
territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, from the Una River to the Drina 
River. We will try to conduct such a policy, to take advantage 
of the positive -- what to call it -- momentum, the positive 
momentum to continue the peace process with the aid of the 
international community. 
  Of course, the war criminals will end up where they belong. 
I would like to tell them, that segment of the Serbian people 
who have been deceived, that they should remember Hitler's 
proverb: If the German nation does not follow my ideas, then it 
does not deserve to exist. Therefore, fascists have always had 
similar messages. I call on the entire Serbian nation to 
integrate and fight since the more you try to divide Bosnia the 
more it looks the same. 
  I again stress that through my contacts here -- not speaking 
of [word indistinct] whom I meet frequently, but the deputies 
from the Una River to the Drina River -- noone said that this 
agreement was to the detriment of [words indistinct]. When one 
understands it, when one [words indistinct] [applause]. 
  Therefore that is the message, and I think that we have now, 
with this act, thoroughly simplified the problem of the Bosnia- 
Herzegovina crisis. Things have come around full circle and 
that is how the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina will finally end. 
The troops that crossed the Drina River must go back there or 
they will eventually be defeated. Still it would be good if the 
Serbian people were to integrate their forces, so that we can 
reach an agreement and unveil their flag here, too. I know, of 
course, that there are many Serbs who have fought for Bosnia and 
died for Bosnia, some of them are here with us. I repeat that 
this agreement has been reached by healthy forces from the ranks 
of the Croatian and the Bosniak people -- I always mention first 
the people to whom I do not belong out of some academic 
principles of my own. The Presidency and Federation bodies will 
continue to struggle for peace throughout the territory. We do 
not ask for anything except that every man have his house 
returned to him and that every man have his property returned to 
him, because pillage cannot be accepted at the beginning of the 
21st century. 
  I wish to salute you with these words, and I wish you 
continuing happy efforts. Thank you very much.

Citizens Council" adopted by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly in 
Sarajevo on 30 March; read by Mariofil Ljubic, deputy chairman 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly -- live] 
  [Text] Mr. President, Esteemed Deputies, I would like to 
read the text of a statement: 
  The initiative of the deputies (?launched) at the session 
yesterday that the Assembly of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina support the declaration of the congress of 
citizens of Serbian nationality in Bosnia-Herzegovina was 
supported by all deputy caucuses of the parties represented in 
the parliament and the Constitutional Commission. 
  The Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
counseled to adopt the following statement: 
  The Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina supports 
the positions of the congress of the citizens of Serbian 
nationality in Bosnia-Herzegovina adopted at the session held on 
27 March 1994 and expressed in its declaration. The Assembly 
requests that the state delegations of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the continuation of peace negotiations on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, insist on their implementation when the 
final decision is made on the constitutional-legal set-up of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina at the peace conference on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  I propose that we accept this statement.

<F P=106> [Amendments to the Constitutional Law adopted at the </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly session in Sarajevo on 30 March; 
read by Kasim Begic, member of the Constitutional Commission -- 
live] 
  [Text] The commission has decided to adopt the amendments 
that apply to the (?original) text. Article 1, paragraph 2 
should include the words: possible changes. So, (?this is) a 
decision on possible changes. 
  Moreover, Article 4 will have a new paragraph, which reads: 
The Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, reshuffled 
according to the Constitution of the Federation, will perform 
the duties of the Government of the Federation. 
  Article 5, instead of the old paragraph 2, which is being 
nullified, contains a new paragraph: The competences of the 
Federation as determined by the Constitution of the Federation 
that refer to the international status [subjektivitet] and 
territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina will 
be exercised after the completion of the peace process for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  You have in the meantime received these changes to the 
original text, in other words, the amended text. 
  In addition, the commission proposes that Article 5 be 
followed by a new Article 6 that should read: In Article 9 of 
the Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the word 
Muslim is replaced with the word Bosniak. 
  The commission did not accept other amendments because some 
of them are not in the domain of constitutional matters. Some 
other amendments presented in the discussion here are not in 
line with the Washington Agreement, nor in line with the 
decision adopted by the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina last 
night, which ratified the Washington Agreement. Some amendments 
are simply not correct. Therefore, they are not a result of the 
text of the Constitutional Law, but of a lack of understanding. 
For instance, regarding the name of the federation, the 
Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot include the words: the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Regarding the amendments proposed by Mr. Ceman, the 
amendment 
that referred to a new paragraph in Article 2, the 
Constitutional Commission proposes that this be presented in the 
form of a statement by the Assembly, and that the text of the 
Constitutional Law not be changed, as this would open the 
question of whether the text of the Constitutional Law and the 
Washington Agreement are complementary. 
  Therefore, regarding the presented amendments, you now have 
in the edited text all the amendments that have been adopted by 
the Constitutional Commission, except the new Article 6. The 
existing, old Article 6 is now to become Article 7. 
  Finally, the Constitutional Commission is recommending to 
the 
deputies not to hold a discussion on the proposed Constitutional 
Law for two reasons. First, there has already been time to 
discuss it and the deputies, and the Presidency and the 
Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina have already 
expressed their views on it. The other reason is that every new 
amendment would require additional assessment by the 
Constitutional Commission. In this way we would only prolong 
what we are all waiting for, I hope, namely the session of the 
constituent assembly. 
  Therefore, I ask the deputies to ratify, as stated here, the 
proposed Constitutional Law, as a supplement to the Constitution 
of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Report by S. Despot: "Turning Point in Relations Between </F>
Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina"] 
  [Text] Zagreb -- "The most important achievement of the 
Washington Agreement and its documents is that the conflict 
between the Croats and the Muslims-Bosniaks, which was 
artificial from the beginning, has been ended. The Washington 
talks mark a turning point in global relations between Croatia 
and Bosnia-Herzegovina with the signing of the preliminary 
agreement on stronger institutional relations between the two 
countries," said Ivo Komsic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency and participant in the Washington talks, at a press 
conference held at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Embassy. 
  Expressing hope that the Washington constitution of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation will be accepted on 28 March -- he 
announced that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly would convene 
that day -- Komsic said it was supposed to become effective at 
midnight on 29 March. The Constituent Assembly will be made up 
of deputies elected at the 1990 elections, except for those 
whose mandate had been canceled. The president and vice 
president of the Assembly will also be appointed that day; one a 
Muslim, the other a Croat. Apart from adopting the constitution 
of the federation, the Assembly is also entrusted with passing 
the election law for the forthcoming elections, which -- Komsic 
hopes -- will be held in a couple of months. 
  According to Komsic, the importance of the Washington talks 
lies in reaching the federation agreement according to the 
principles laid down by the Sarajevo assembly held on 6 
February, while the public of both countries will decide about 
the question of a confederation between Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
<H5>  There Will Be Resistance </H5>
  "I am aware that some people will resist the implementation 
of both agreements, both the one on the principles of the 
federation and that on the confederation agreement, but I expect 
the resistance to come from people who have been hindering the 
negotiations between the two nations from the beginning," said 
Komsic in reply to a question from the press, commenting on the 
views of the Croats from the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna 
that they will not accept the federation without firm ties with 
Croatia. However, he said that he expects people only to hinder 
the implementation, not to prevent it, for it was arranged at a 
high level under the auspices of the United States, which has 
finally become involved in solving the crisis on this territory 
and it will not allow the agreement to fall through. 
  Asked whether the agreement was reached only as a result of 
U.S. pressure, Komsic said that the U.S. Administration had been 
restrained until the Croat-Muslim conflict broke out. It was 
then that the United States decided to get involved in solving 
the crisis and even go as far as -- unless there is another 
possibility -- to accept a possible agreement between the 
Croatian National Council and the Muslim-Bosniak leadership as a 
basis to which further pressure on the warring factions could be 
applied. "Fortunately, the Croatian authorities decided to make 
an about-turn in their policies adopting solutions advocated by 
the opposition," said Komsic, and added that the cantonal map 
drawn up by the Sarajevo assembly was accepted. 
  "We agreed that central Bosnia will consist of two cantons, 
neither of which will have a predominant nationality, just as 
that kind of predominance was not planned in any other canton, 
regardless of the majority nation," said Komsic, explaining that 
the cantonal borders would be determined by expert groups. 
<H5>  Herceg-Bosna Did Not Exist </H5>
  He explained that the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna has 
never existed, formally or legally speaking. During the war, 
some institutions of authority were established without 
legitimacy (which only the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina had 
all the while), but with great political power. He said that it 
was agreed that some institutions of the Croatian republic of 
Herceg-Bosna will continue to function for another month after 
the adoption of the constitution of the federation -- which will 
refer to the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- and that, 
after that period of time, they should be abolished. 
  Asked how the Bosnian Serbs would be included in the 
agreement, Komsic drew a distinction between loyal Serbs, who 
will be involved in the political life of the federation, and 
those in the occupied areas, who have not yet become involved in 
the negotiating process. Asked about the chances of the 
Croat-Muslim alliance attacking the Serbs, he said that the 
agreement excluded the military option and it was devised on the 
model of eliminating the causes of war. If the Serbs do not 
accept the agreement, they will have to consider a series of 
other possibilities and Komsic said it would be best to combine 
diplomatic and military pressure, according to the Sarajevo 
model. 
  He said that there is absolutely no chance of a union of the 
Bosnian Serbs with Serbia, for that would mean destroying the 
territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Serbs, who 
are aggressors both in Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina, must 
not be joined in one state as a reward. "We should not make any 
concessions to the Serbs; they must be politically and 
militarily defeated," said Komsic.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister </F>
Haris Silajdzic by Branko Tudjen; place and date not given: "The 
Agreement Must Not Fail!"] 
  [Text] It has been very difficult to reach any leading 
Bosniak-Muslim official in Washington and entice him into giving 
an interview. However, sometimes coincidence is a much more 
important factor than the planned goal. We first stumbled 
across Mr. Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, in a Washington restaurant, the proprietor 
of which is a Croat. It was the night before signing the 
agreement. Mr. Silajdzic and his company sat next to our table 
where there were five or six Croatian journalists. He promised 
he would say something, but suddenly got up (it seems that the 
reason was a child that fell asleep) and went toward the door. 
We also got up, but too late. We only managed to ask him how 
to include the Serbs in all that, so, imitating the Zagreb 
dialect, he said: "We will see." 
  Then there was another coincidence on the Lufthansa flight 
from Washington to Frankfurt on Saturday night. We spotted 
Silajdzic again. This time he was with Alija Izetbegovic, in 
the first class compartment of Lufthansa's Airbus. Silajdzic 
did not refuse to talk to me. Our conversation was a kind of an 
unauthorized interview over the Atlantic at three o'clock in the 
morning, CET. 
  I first asked him what he thought about the agreement. 
  He answered, "I think it is a victory of the natural over 
the 
unnatural. The conflict was unnecessary, planned, and imposed. 
The agreement is a victory of the civilized over the 
uncivilized. I also think it is a victory of each and every one 
of us over ourselves. Wounds are too deep and too fresh. It 
took a lot of energy to do this and it will take much energy to 
heal the wound." 
<H5>  Europe and Reward for Genocide </H5>
  I asked Mr. Silajdzic, "Some think the agreement came about 
overnight; on the other hand, some say it was initiated a long 
time ago." 
  He replied "Mr. Granic and myself, of course with the 
permission of both presidents, have been working on this for 
months. The agreement is a result of much effort. We must not 
let the agreement fail because of the interest of individuals 
who promote radical ideas (there are such people on both sides). 
First of all, we must not allow more conflicts, for we would 
then be accused by not only the civilized public, but also by 
our children and history. The conflict between the Croats and 
the Muslims has no other foundation but human stupidity, love of 
power, and greed." 
  Mr. Silajdzic then wanted to state the following: 
  "The United States is both on your side and our side, but I 
must reproach it for still tolerating the aggression and 
rewarding the genocide as a means of establishing peace." 
  I thought it logical to ask about his views on the problem 
of 
the UNPA [UN Protected Area] zones in Croatia. 
  He said, "Everything must be founded on the UN Charter and 
on 
the principles of the London conference, which say that 
territory cannot be taken by force. President Clinton confirmed 
that the United States would protect the integrity of all 
countries in this region, especially that of Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. One cannot allow changing borders in the 
20th century under the pretext that all members of one nation 
must live in one country. Serbian aggression is a prism through 
which we can see all sides of Europe. Europe has hitherto shown 
one of its darker sides. Fortunately, relations change. Both 
sides, Croatian and ours, must persist on the Washington 
agreement for it will significantly improve both our positions." 
  "But what will happen to the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
The West and Russia have opposite intentions," I asked. 
  Silajdzic answered, "The Serbs will be offered the chance to 
join the agreement that is supported by the entire civilized 
world. I would not like to discuss details. I believe a great 
number of the Serbs want peace, but cannot say it. The problem 
lies in the fact that the West gives legitimacy to those who 
destroyed all principles of our civilization, and takes the 
legitimacy away from those whose rights were violated -- the 
very rights that are so often mentioned by the West. I am 
curious to know how many observers Western countries will send 
to Sarajevo for the Serbian assembly that will take place on 27 
March. Continuing the process, we will consider the problem of 
the union with the Serb entity existing on predominantly Serb 
areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina." 

<H5>    Satanization of Fundamentalism </H5>
  I asked Mr. Silajdzic if he was a Bosniak or a Muslim. 
  He replied "I am a Bosniak who was not allowed to be called 
that, although we have existed for a thousand years. 
Unfortunately, due to various circumstances, it so happened 
that the bond between the name of the country and the nation 
broke, and we were named after our religion." 
  During our conversation, we broached the question of Islamic 
fundamentalism. Interestingly enough -- this was not an 
interview in the usual sense, so I can tell you my impressions 
-- Mr. Silajdzic took a great interest in the subject. 
  He answered, "Every belief and religion is fundamental by 
definition. This is a term which is supposed to degrade all 
aspects of cultural, religious, and social dynamism in Islamic 
countries in the past couple of decades. The term 
fundamentalism is used as an ideological alternative that, after 
the fall of socialism, is taken as a serious competition and 
opponent. And this is why it has negative connotations." 
  I then asked, "But even if you were right, fundamentalism is 
very much talked and written about. You cannot disregard that." 
  He said, "The satanization of fundamentalism, which is a 
result of a long process, definitely does not lead anywhere. 
This benefits those who do not have much to do with religion, 
but want to have power. That is the problem." 
  Parting with Mr. Silajdzic, who was then, incidentally, 
"taken over" by a journalist of STERN who happened to be there, 
I remembered something I had heard when we were leaving 
Washington: That the radical change of U.S. views has not been 
made because of Islamic countries, nor because of Russian 
penetration onto the territory of former Yugoslavia, but because 
of domestic politics. If that is the case, then things are not 
as we thought they were. However, Croatia would not be a loser 
in that case either.

  [Text] The official delegation of the United States led by 
Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and 
General John Shalikashvili, commander of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces, arrived in Sarajevo this 
afternoon. The delegation was received by President Alija 
Izetbegovic of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, Presidency 
member Ejup Ganic, Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic, Bosnia-Herzegovina Foreign Minister Irfan 
Ljubijankic, and Defense Minister Hamdija Hadzihasanovic. 
  General John Shalikashvili held talks with Army General 
Rasim 
Delic, commander of the General Staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army. It is the greatest honor for the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 
to be visited by General Shalikashvili, General Rasim Delic told 
B-H PRESS after the meeting. The talks concerned the course of 
the negotiations and the process leading to peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. General Delic stated: 
  We should say that we have the full support of the United 
States, both the U.S. political and military leadership, to 
reach an agreement as soon as possible that would guarantee a 
just peace. We said that we were interested only in just peace 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In that respect we expect that the 
support of the United States will be the deciding factor in 
bringing about the kind of peace that our people want, General 
Delic said.

  [Text] [Studio announcer] Radovan Karadzic and Nikola 
Koljevic, president and vice president of the Srpska republic, 
and Chairman of the Srpska republic assembly Momcilo Krajisnik, 
today held talks in Pale with members of the British Foreign 
Office delegation headed by Roger (?Bown). The leadership of 
the Serbian republic told the British diplomats that peace 
should first be established and territory demarcated in the area 
of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, then political talks could be 
initiated on the Croatian-Muslim Federation and the Serbian 
republic's position regarding this newly established state. 
Here is what Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the Srpska 
republic, told our correspondent Dragan Colovic on his 
expectations of the talks with U.S. President Clinton's special 
envoy Charles Redman, scheduled for tomorrow [31 March]: 
  [Begin recording] [Koljevic] Well, we expect a further 
concretization of the talks initiated by the British, therefore, 
we expect the beginning of discussions on the demarcation and 
the beginning of discussions about those urgent measures that 
need to be taken in order to establish and strengthen peace. I 
believe that it was Mr. Akashi who said that peace was on glass 
legs; that is accurately stated; peace should move on from those 
glass legs to a more stable basis, a more stable material than 
glass. We shall discuss this with Mr. Redman and, of course, we 
shall also discuss the possibilities of the preliminary 
framework for the demarcation with the newly established 
federation. 
  [Colovic] Will issues pertaining to relations between the 
Serbian republic and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia also be 
included in the talks? 
  [Koljevic] Well, most probably. It depends on what kind of 
concept is proposed for a link between the Srpska republic and 
this newly established federation, that is, there are various 
ways in which the Srpska republic can achieve its independence 
and sovereignty, and, of course, realize its natural links with 
Yugoslavia. I say natural, because it is quite normal and the 
international community is aware that the links between the 
Srpska republic and Yugoslavia are far more natural than the 
links currently burdened by antagonism. [sentence as heard] Of 
course, time will show that this antagonism can be overcome, but 
links with our brothers in Yugoslavia can only grow stronger. 
Therefore, we are primarily going to see what would be the 
internationally desirable sequence of measures that would not be 
in contradiction with out strategic interests. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 31 March reports 
fighting in the following parts of the country: 
  The correspondent from Gorazde, Enes Musovic, reports that 
"the chetniks have been pounding all lines of defense of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army fighters with artillery of the largest 
calibers the entire night." As he continues to say, "the 
situation is extremely fierce on all lines of Gorazde's defense 
on the right bank of the Drina River" while "on the left bank of 
the Drina River the chetniks are attacking from Ustipraca and 
Mesici at Kopaci and Trovrh." "From 1900 last night to 0800 this 
morning one person died and eight sustained serious injuries. 
Yesterday and the day before, 15 people were killed and 40 
injured." 
  "The activities of the Serbian aggressor against the Bihac 
district have continued overnight and this morning," 
correspondent Mirza Sadikovic says. "Yesterday, in the early 
evening, Karadzic's terrorists attacked the center of Bihac 
[words indistinct] as well as the hospital. New material damage 
was caused and, according to incomplete reports, there are 
injured civilians. In the course of the night, the intensity of 
shelling subsided a little because of low flights by NATO 
aircraft." "In other areas," Sadikovic goes on, "antiaircraft 
arms' fire and sniper fire were observed in the course of the 
night and since early morning." "On the separating lines with 
the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa 
autonomists, there have been provocative attacks with mortars 
and hill guns at various intervals, launched from the area of 
Krivaja and [word indistinct] in the Kladusa commune."

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1000 GMT on 31 March carries more 
reports about the combat situation: 
  "The situation around Gorazde is getting worse," 
correspondent from Gorazde Enes Musovic reports "as the chetniks 
are intensifying their attacks by the hour. One grenade lands 
here every second." Musovic then goes on to say that "last night 
a group of 1,000 soldiers of the regular Yugoslav Army, armed to 
the teeth and escorted by armored personnel carriers, crossed 
the Bosnia- Herzegovina border and arrived in Visegrad. In this 
way the self-styled Yugoslavia is making its full contribution 
to the aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  The 3d Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army reports that 
"the 
3d Corps units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army yesterday 
conquered several important elevations and settlements on the 
Teslic-Seher battlefield, starting from Veliki Kraguljac and 
Mali Kraguljac, and the village of Karanovica." The Corps also 
reports that "the chetnik artillery from (?Srpske Stijene) 
sporadically shelled Secevo, Djaki, and Turbe, while the town of 
Bugojno was attacked from the direction of Kupres." 
  "The defense lines have moved to the advantage of the free 
Bosnia-Herzegovina territory on the Brcko battlefield," Hamiz 
Deronjic reports from Brcko. As he says "yesterday afternoon, 
the chetniks launched a fierce tank-infantry attack that was 
supported by self-propelled antiaircraft artillery [PRAGA] and 
Bofors guns. The soldiers of the Legendary 108th Brigade halted 
the enemy and, after the accurate hits of our artillery 
destroyed a chetnik PRAGA with its entire crew, they moved into 
a decisive counterattack. They killed some 10 chetniks and 
injured many more. In a powerful counterattack, the soldiers of 
the 108th Motorized Brigade moved the line of defense by half a 
kilometer in the direction of the aggressor's strongholds of 
Pekici and Sekulici."

<F P=106> [Report by Fahrudin Becic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Text] Eight killed and 25 wounded is the tragic result of 
this morning's frenzy of the chetnik artillery men against 
Gorazde. Most of these were civilians, and unfortunately again 
several were children between the ages of three and 10. 
  The (shelling) from the aggressor's strongholds has not 
stopped for long enough to let the guns cool. The area of 
(Gradina) has been pounded with howitzers from the right side of 
Gavran Stijena. They have attempted an infantry attack along the 
Ustipraca-(Mesici) line, and the intensive attacks have not let 
up since last night. 
  It is equally dramatic on the southern part of the front, in 
the region of (Zibovi), (Potrkusa), and (?Oblenceva). At noon, 
the aggressor intensified attacks on the area of Orahovice, on 
the border between the Gorazde and Pale communes. Behind the 
enemy front lines, the new forces of the regular army of the 
so-called Yugoslavia have been grouping. There is no doubt that 
the rest of the day will be even more dramatic. 
  It is hard to believe that high-altitude flights of what are 
probably NATO planes will change anything. When they flew away, 
heavy artillery shells came flying in from the aggressor's 
positions. We do not yet have precise information about the 
consequences. It is particularly hard to obtain information 
from the remote parts of the front.

  [Text] Skopje, 29 Mar (TANJUG) -- Matthew Nimetz, special 
envoy of the U.S. President responsible for the conflict between 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Repulic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
and Greece, arrived from Athens in Skopje today for talks with 
Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov and Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Stevo Crvenkovski. In a brief press statement following 
an hour and a half of talks, Nimetz was confident that the 
United States would play a useful role in the efforts to resolve 
the conflict between Skopje and Athens. 
  After his visit to Macedonia, Nimetz is expected to return 
to 
Athens. 
  Following his talks with Nimetz, Minister Crvenkovski said 
that the U.S. envoy was told of Macedonia's satisfaction at 
President Clinton's decision to become involved in the conflict 
by appointing an envoy. Crvenkovski said Macedonia was willing 
to resume negotiations to resolve the conflict within the United 
Nations and with Cyrus Vance as mediator. He went on to draw 
attention to Macedonia's view that there were no prospects for 
resuming the dialogue while the pressure of embargo was in place.

<F P=106> [Report by M. Antic: "Belgrade's Lips Remain Sealed"] </F>
  [Text] Pristina -- "As president of Kosovo, I gave my word 
to the citizens of Kosovo and I am promising that, according to 
the results of the 1991 referendum, I will nurture the will of 
the Kosovo citizens, expressed at that referendum." This will, 
let us recall, was: "An independent and sovereign state of 
Kosovo." This was stated, among other things, by Ibrahim Rugova 
in the latest issue of ZERI, in response to the question on when 
he expected the process of solving issues in Kosovo to start, 
that is, when he expected a dialogue between Belgrade and 
Pristina to start. 
  Rugova said that he expected the issue of Kosovo to be dealt 
with by the international community immediately after the 
conclusion of the Muslim-Croat agreement in Bosnia. For the 
first time, he said that, expecting a reaction from the Serbs, 
he has proposed that the United States mediate in these talks, 
and that, as he said, the presence of the European Union, even 
Russia, cannot be ruled out. He said that he had opted for the 
Americans because their policies are pragmatic, whereas Europe 
is satisfied with a status-quo situation. 
  Following Rugova's statement, almost all papers in Albanian 
language were preoccupied with the "start" of the 
Serbian-Albanian dialogue on solving the status of Kosovo. 
Analysts, commentators, and Albanian politicians are very 
frustrated, however, because "Belgrade's lips remain sealed."

<F P=106> [Marcela Feraru, Tiberiu Braescu, Mihai Valentin Neagu, and </F>
Andra Aurora Manta article: "Virgil Magureanu Announced that He 
Will Dismiss His Deputy, Dumitru Cristea, on Grounds of Immoral 
Behavior"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  The Former Chief of the Counterespionage Division </H5>
of the Romanian Intelligence Service Has Been Accused of 
Concealing Documents 
  The hearing of Virgil Magureanu, director of the SRI 
[Romanian Intelligence Service], by the authorized Parliamentary 
Commission took place yesterday. He was summoned to answer 
questions regarding accusations of espionage against certain 
public personalities as well as with changes at the SRI 
leadership. Although the Steering College of the respective 
institution was also summoned, Virgil Magureanu was accompanied 
only by the head of the Counterespionage Directorate. 
  The most spectacular case, that is, the case of the former 
presidential counselor, Marin Pancea, was clarified with two 
precise answers: He is neither a French spy nor working for the 
KGB. Asked whether he was not interested in Pancea's commercial 
relations, which would have made him a suspect, Virgil Magureanu 
said that SRI did not react to this issue. The SRI director 
promised to disclose next week where all the information 
published in the press originated from. 
  In connection with other personalities who were accused of 
espionage such as Adrian Nastase [executive president of the 
ruling party Social Democracy Party of Romania], Adrian Severin 
[vice president of the Democratic Party (National Salvation 
Front)], Ion Talpes [head of the Foreign Intelligence Service], 
and others, the answer was the same, namely, he promised to 
disclose those things later. In any event, "there is no proof 
that those persons were spies." Nevertheless, the SRI director 
promised "we will also see some spies" without mentioning who 
they are, how they were discovered, and what has happened to 
them. 
<H5>  Major General Dumitru Cristea, Deputy Chief of the SRI, Will </H5>
Be Removed From Office on Grounds of Immoral Behavior 
  Referring to the issue of demotions at the level of the SRI 
leadership, Virgil Magureanu said that his deputy, Major General 
Dumitru Cristea, will be removed from his position because of 
immoral and scandalous behavior. In his capacity as rector of 
the Higher Institute for Information Studies, he had sexual 
relations with female students and the father of one of the 
girls complained about it to the Parliamentary Commission. The 
Commission came into possession of a recorded cassette that 
contained the declarations made to the Commission expert by the 
respective student. In her statement, the student tells the 
entire story in detail. Out of decency, we decided to refrain 
from disclosing those details. However, the representatives of 
the commission assessed the behavior of the SRI deputy chief as 
"offensively immoral." 
  The president of the Parliamentary Commission Vasile Vacaru 
also has a recording in which Dumitru Cristea admits all the 
allegations, even if he withdrew those statements later. 
  In this situation, Major General Dumitru Cristea was 
summoned 
for a hearing to the Parliamentary Commission in Charge of 
Supervising Romanian Intelligence Service activity. 
<H5>  SRI Has No Clear Picture About Documents That Were Concealed </H5>
by Gheorghe Diaconescu and That Contain Intelligence Data 
  In connection with the dismissal of the head of the 
Counterintelligence Service, Gheorghe Diaconescu, Virgil 
Magureanu informed the commission that Diaconescu concealed 
documents that contained intelligence data. The SRI still has 
no clear picture of the nature of the respective documents or of 
the reasons why they were hidden. A response is still expected 
from the Prosecutor's Office. 
<H5>  Virgil Magureanu, Director of the Romanian Intelligence </H5>
Service Promised Not To Carry Out Any More Changes Without 
Previously Discussing the Matter With the Parliamentary 
Commission. The SRI Director Denied All Cases of Espionage 
Referred to in the Press. 
  During the hearing, the SRI director mentioned that the 
institution, whose chief he is, to this very day, does not have 
accurate data that would confirm cases of espionage, as 
published in the press. His statement was confirmed also by the 
head of the Counterespionage Division of the SRI, who was 
present at the hearing. Nevertheless, Virgil Magureanu said 
that the SRI is investigating those cases that were brought up 
by the press and will present a report to the Parliamentary 
Commission. 
  The Commission asked the SRI director not to carry out any 
more changes in the structure of that institution without 
previously discussing it with members of parliament. In 
conclusion, Virgil Magureanu promised that he will bring before 
the commission all those dignitaries who are going to be 
replaced, as well as those by whom they are going to be replaced.

  [Text] Acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev made an 
official statement for the mass media in which he assessed the 
situation in the country. According to him, the government has 
reached the conclusion that the days before signing the 
agreements with the international financial institutes will 
prompt the most acute conflicts from a political point of view. 
  [Begin Matinchev recording] Our opponents know that those 
agreements will be signed in the next few days. On behalf of 
the Bulgarian Government, I want to assure the Bulgarian people 
that precisely those agreements, against the background of the 
strenuous budget adopted by the National Assembly and the 
difficulties that all people experience, will contribute to 
stabilizing the general socioeconomic situation in the country. 
  Unfortunately, precisely at this moment, apparently sensing 
an opportunity to destabilize the country, certain political and 
financial forces are trying to create panic on the foreign 
currency and stock market by disseminating incorrect and 
provocative rumors, thus prompting speculators to purchase 
convertible currency on their behalf in unjustifiably large 
quantities. 
  In the last two days and especially yesterday, this caused 
an 
abnormal and speculative rise in the dollar rate on the foreign 
currency market. [end recording] 
  Further in his statement, Evgeni Matinchev stressed that the 
government is determined to achieve its goals and successfully 
complete the talks with the international financial institutes. 
Together with the National Bank, the government will adopt 
measures aimed at stopping the speculations. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Matinchev appealed to sober 
politicians 
and all citizens to preserve maximum calm, something that would 
guarantee the success of the reforms, prevent the devaluation of 
the Bulgarian lev, and the destabilization of the country.

  [Text] Knin, 30 Mar (TANJUG) -- ISKRA [Serb Krajina news 
agency] has been authorized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
to publish the full text of the cease-fire accord between the 
republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] and the Republic of Croatia, 
signed at 0430 on 30 March 1994 in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. 
  The following is the full text of the accord: 
  The signatories accept that all armed hostilities between 
the 
two sides should cease immediately and that total observance of 
the cease-fire along all confrontation lines [linija dodira] 
(henceforth the confrontation line), as they were on the day of 
29 March 1994, should begin at 0900 on 4 April 1994. 
  To achieve and maintain a permanent cessation of 
hositilities, the sides agreed to accept, and act in accordance 
with, the letter and spirit of the following points: 
  1. All armed hositilities to cease immediately and the 
cease-fire along the confrontation line to begin at 0900 on 4 
April 1994. 
  2. From the day of the signing, the tactical deployment of 
the forces along the confrontation line and within 10 kms from 
the confrontation line to be frozen on both sides. There will 
be no movement of units within this zone except for the purpose 
of implementing this accord or with the prior authorization of 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. UNPROFOR will be informed of 
the passage of units with more than three vehicles through the 
zone during the first 14 days from the signing of the accord. 
  3. By 0900 on 5 April 1994 at the latest, all indirect 
weapons [indirektno naoruzanje] to be deployed beyond the range 
of the confrontation line (as defined in Point Four) as follows: 
mortar launchers and anti-aircraft guns at least 10 kms away and 
artillery weapons and tanks at least 20 kms away. In an 
exceptional situation, the sides can store some of the indirect 
weapons within the 20-km zone, as provided for in Point Four, 
Annex B, "The Rules of Disengagement." 
  4. By 0900 on 8 April 1994 at the latest, all units along 
the confrontation line will be disengaged. On the basis of the 
disengagement, both sides will pull back to at least 1,000 
meters from the confrontation line to their line of separation 
(henceforth the line of separation) [linija razdvajanja]. The 
lines are as marked on the maps endorsed by the sides and 
attached in Annex D. The units are to withdraw to a distance 
from where the sides will not be capable of targeting each other 
from direct firearms [direktno vatreno oruzje]. The separation 
line should be easily indentifiable (preferably to run along a 
geographic feature such as a road, a river, a pass, and so 
forth). The zone between the separation lines will be under the 
exclusive control of UNPROFOR, and except for the personnel 
identified in Annex B of the Accord, no military, paramilitary, 
militia, or police personnel from either side will be allowed to 
remain in the zone. The sides will, however, be obliged to help 
UNPROFOR in preventing crime and upholding law and order between 
the separation lines, as specified in Point 9 and 10 of Annex B. 
  5. UNPROFOR and the ECMM [EC Monitoring Mission] will 
supervise the cease-fire. UNPROFOR military observers will be 
granted full freedom of movement on both sides of the separation 
lines to enable them to check that the weapon systems as 
specified in the Accord are deployed beyond the minimum distance 
from the separation lines. Freedom of movement in the areas as 
defined above implies the right to inspect all military and 
paramilitary units and facilities, provided four-hour prior 
notice is given. In accordance with the Memorandum of 
Understanding, the ECMM will be given full freedom of movement 
in all areas covered by the Memorandum. UNPROFOR, which is to 
operate in accordance with its mandate, will be granted full 
freedom of movement in all relevant areas and the right to 
inspect all military and paramilitary units and facilities as 
described. The freedom of movement in the above areas implies 
the unlimited use of helicopters in those areas. 
  6. Joint commissions will be established at all levels. 
Their first task will be the demarcation of the line of 
separation on the ground, in keeping with the principles set out 
in Point Four. This should be achieved by 13 April 1994. Their 
main task is to investigate immediately any cease-fire 
violation. The aim of an investigation is to establish 
responsibility for such a violation. The commission 
investigating a cease-fire violation will be informed -- by the 
side which is deemed responsible for the violation -- of all 
disciplinary measures or other actions undertaken in connection 
with the incident. 
  These commissions will be established before the cease-fire 
comes into effect. The commissions will be chaired by an 
UNPROFOR representative who will -- at his or her own 
initiative, or at the request of the sides -- schedule meetings 
for the participants. Meetings will begin, with all sides 
attending, in the shortest possible time after receipt of a 
request from the headquarters of the members. Details 
concerning the composition, the venues for the holding of 
meetings, and documentation are, as agreed, to be found in Annex 
B. 
  7. If any violation of the cease-fire or other provision of 
this agreement comes about, neither side will return fire; 
instead, they will rely fully on the procedures envisaged in 
Point Six above. 
  8. The participants are agreed on the opening of a specific 
number of crossing points along the confrontation line. These 
new crossing points, as well as those which already exist, are 
listed in Annex A. UNPROFOR will have its own checkpoint on all 
these crossings. All the checkpoints or other positions of the 
two sides must be located sufficiently far from the UN 
checkpoints as to render sniper fire or fire from heavy machine 
guns ineffective. At all the checkpoints UNPROFOR will specify 
facilities for the holding of meetings of the joint commissions. 
All crossing points will be opened at the latest three hours 
after the cease-fire comes into effect. 
  9. The sides will meet and agree on ways to reduce their 
forces within a 10-km zone, stretching back from both sides of 
the confrontation line, by 0900 on 19 April 1994 at the latest. 
This reduction in the forces will be completed within five days 
of reaching agreement.

  [Excerpt] Prague--In December 1993, 28,281 foreigners 
worked legally in the Czech Republic. This means that the 
statistics of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MPSV) 
registered only a small decline from September of the same year, 
when it showed 28,392 valid work permits for foreigners. 
Approximately 15,500 are individual workers, and 12,600 are 
employed on the basis of contracts. Only 166 of them were people 
with refugee status. From the point of view of profession, the 
largest group are laborers (about 21,500 people). Approximately 
2,000 foreigners working in the Czech Republic are high-school 
graduates. Almost 4,700 foreigners are university graduates; 
these are mostly representatives of foreign firms. [passage

  [Excerpts] The constitutive assembly of the federal 
Bosnia-Herzegovina today proclaimed the Constitution of the 
Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is to come into effect 
at 2400 this evening. Zdenko Vranjes reporting from Sarajevo: 
  [Begin recording] [Vranjes] It is worth mentioning that all 
deputies of the Croat and the Bosniak nations voted for the 
draft Constitution signed in Washington. The Constitution was 
proclaimed at 1710 this afternoon. [passage omitted] 
  Here is what Kresimir Zubak, the president of the 
Presidential Council of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, 
stated following the adoption of the Constitution of the 
federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina: 
  [Zubak] As far as we, the Croat deputies, are concerned, 
this 
was a formal act, an act of formal recognition of what we had 
confirmed by our signature. 
  [Vranjes] General Ante Roso, the HVO [Croatian Defense 
Council] chief of the General Staff, stated the following: 
  [Roso] I have been a soldier, and I am going to remain one. 
It is certain that a new situation has been created by the 
adoption of this legal document. New conditions have been 
created. One of the bases of this document is the restoration 
of peace in this area. We, Croats, are ready to restore peace in 
a consistent and dignified way. It is beyond any doubt that 
this is a great event for our people, for our people of 
Herceg-Bosna and for the people of Bosnia in general. I hope 
that the Bosniak people also welcome this offer. 
  Morale among the people has changed somewhat. People's 
behavior has also changed. It had been very difficult to 
believe this would happen just a few days ago. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Edo Zitnik from Brussels] </F>
  [Excerpts] Slovenia today signed the Partnership for Peace, 
the 14th East European country to do so. At the ceremony held 
on this occasion, which, in addition to NATO Secretary General 
Woerner, was also attended by the ambassadors of all 16 NATO 
member-states, Prime Minister Dr. Drnovsek stressed that the 
partnership is extremely important for Slovenia. [passage 
omitted] 
  After the signing of the document, Prime Minister Dr. 
Drnovsek had a closed-door meeting with the ambassadors of NATO 
member-states. According to him, they all expressed 
satisfaction with the economic and political situation in 
Slovenia. The ambassadors were also interested in Slovene views 
about the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as whether there 
are any possibilities for the restoration of certain forms of 
cooperation on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. 
  Prime Minister Dr. Drnovsek stressed that Slovenia is in any 
case interested in restoration of peace in this region and is 
also willing to assist within the limits of its capacities and 
interests. However, this does not mean that Slovenia is open to 
any sort of institutionalized linking with the republics of the 
former Yugoslavia. Slovenia has already overcome the worst 
crisis that emerged with the loss of the Yugoslav market, which 
was, among other things, also facilitated by the creation of the 
free trade zone with the Central European states. 
  Logically, there was also discussion about the arms embargo 
today, which is still in force for all the republics of the 
former Yugoslavia, therefore, for Slovenia, too. Because the 
Partnership for Peace, in addition to military cooperation, also 
envisages the adaptation of Slovene armaments to the NATO 
standards, the arms embargo is becoming nonsensical with 
Slovenia's membership in the plan. 
  As it was the UN that passed the arms embargo, the NATO 
officials today avoided giving a direct answer to this question.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle has sent a letter to 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and foreign ministers 
of the UN Security Concil member-states, asking that the UN 
Security Council lift the arms embargo. 
  The minister pointed out that the situation in Slovenia is 
perfectly peaceful, that Slovenia is a sovereign and independent 
country and a UN member, which consistently meets all 
international obligations. Our country demonstrates a high 
level of political stability and observation of human rights. 
It is a member of the Council of Europe, has signed the 
Partnership for Peace plan, and is just about to commence 
negotiations on associate membership in the European Union, 
Minister Peterle among other things emphasized in his letter.

  [Excerpts] President Milan Kucan returned at noon from an 
unofficial visit to the United States, where he met with U.S. 
Vice President Al Gore. Here is a report by Vojko Plevelj: 
  [Begin recording] [Plevelj] [Passage omitted] In 
Washington Kucan's discussions with U.S. Vice President Al Gore 
were mainly about bilateral contacts. They both favored the 
most rapid harmonization possible of the legal bases for mutual 
economic cooperation. Vice President Gore also paid tribute to 
Slovenia for all the achievements in the period of independence 
and expressed a readiness to assist in the development of small 
businesses. He congratulated Slovenia on today's signing of the 
Partnership for Peace plan. 
  Continuing his statement, President Kucan first rejected the 
criticism that he had deliberately travelled abroad at the time 
of crucial events at home by saying that he had received the 
invitation for this visit last August. He explained his outlook 
on these events as follows: 
  [Kucan] I do not believe that in a democratic parliamentary 
democracy the replacement of a minister at the proposal of the 
prime minister is something that should oblige me to postpone or 
interrupt a trip abroad. 
  I have spoken on several occasions about the events that led 
to this replacement, especially about what I believe are 
unacceptable methods of political work that divide rather than 
unite Slovenes. If the State Chamber so decides, then I believe 
that it is my duty to explain my views in the State Chamber, 
also. 
  I consider the prime minister's proposal legitimate, very 
sober, and well-grounded. I respect the decision of the State 
Chamber as I would have respected it had it been different.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 30 (TANJUG) -- President of the 
Lower Chamber of Yugoslav Parliament Radoman Bozovic has said 
that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia urges an unconditional 
end to all armed conflicts in the former Yugoslav republics of 
Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and a lasting solution founded 
on principles which will be equal for all warring sides. 
  Speaking to a delegation of the lower chamber of Russian 
Parliament, headed by Sergey Baburin, Bozovic said that 
Yugoslavia was an example how the strength of the world's powers 
was demonstrated through international sanctions as an 
unprecedented form of violence against innocent civilians. 
  An entire nation, Bozovic said, is punished because the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia urges the respect of the right to 
self-determination for all peoples in the conflicts in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. 
  The Russian parliamentarians pointed out the united stand of 
all parliamentary political parties of the lower chamber on the 
Yugoslav crisis and the necessity to lift the international 
sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. They said 
they were certain that Russian parliament would soon pass a law 
on their lifting and that the latest initiatives by the Russian 
Government would step up this process in the international 
community. 
  The MPs assessed that the world community had violated the 
principles of international law by recognizing the 
disintegrations of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and 
the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and had thus 
triggered a serious crisis in international relations. Along 
these lines, they underscored the necessity for establishing a 
new system of collective security, having in mind the national 
interests of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Russia. 
  The Russian parliamentarians were also received by Serbian 
Vice Premier Slobodan Radulovic. During these talks, the two 
sides set out the complementarity of the economies of Russia and 
Serbia and the mutual interest for cooperation to continue. 
  Vice President of the Socialist Party of Serbia Goran 
Percevic underscored the important effect Russia had had on 
securing a more balanced approach to the resolving of the 
Yugoslav crisis and said he was certain that Russia would 
continue to act in this direction.

<F P=106> ["I.M."-initialled report: "Berisha Warns Against Balkans </F>
War"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- "The outbreak of hostilities in Kosovo 
would have a destabilizing effect on the neighboring states of 
the former Yugoslavia and particularly Albania, and an all-out 
war in the Balkans would be unavoidable." On his way home from 
London, Albania's President Sali Berisha stopped in Vienna to 
give a news conference. In London he did not only discuss 
bilateral relations with the main focus on the economy, but he 
also submitted the proposal that a relaxation of the UN 
sanctions against Serbia should be linked with a solution to the 
Kosovo problem, the president stressed. Berisha stated that 
Prime Minister Major and Foreign Secretary Hurd had shown 
understanding.

<F P=106> [Interview with President of the Republic Sali Berisha by </F>
Vjollca Vokshi; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Vokshi] What are the conclusions of President 
Berisha on his visit to Great Britain? 
  [Berisha] [passage omitted] I would say there were three 
main themes of the talks. First, we discussed bilateral 
relations between Albania and Great Britain. In the talks that 
I held there, I pointed out all the developments in Albania and, 
what pleased me the most, was the knowledge that my 
interlocutors had about Albania and their assessment about the 
great changes that Albania has achieved in two years on the 
democratic road. 
  What seemed important to me, and it is extremely important, 
was the complete predisposition I found in top British officials 
to encourage further cooperation between both countries. For 
this, I got assurances from Prime Minister Major, her majesty 
the queen, and Secretary of State Douglas Hurd. I think that in 
this spirit, the signing of four agreements on the last day of 
my visit undoubtedly marks an important event in cooperation 
between Albania and Great Britain. I would like to stress that 
all the talks and meetings that I held were open, kind, and 
friendly. 
  Another very important theme was the Albanian question, the 
crisis in the region, and the Albanian issue. [sentence as 
heard] In the talks, I stressed that the Albanian question is 
the main question in the Balkan crisis. It is true that war is 
being waged in Bosnia today and this constitutes a sharper phase 
of the Balkan crisis. However, the most fundamental question is 
the Albanian one, because Albanians are a nation divided in two 
-- half live in Albania, while the other half in several states. 
In this respect, there is no doubt that the most delicate point 
of this question is Kosova. In general, this constitutes a very 
serious issue. 
  I expressed my view that the Albanians are not seeking a 
change of borders by force, but on the other hand Albanians will 
react as a single nation toward every massacre or practice of 
ethnic cleansing that anyone may undertake against them. I have 
my doubts that that is possible, because as has been shown by 
the developments of the two last years, Milosevic is practicing 
and putting into practice the memorandum of the Academy of 
Sciences of Serbia, according to whose map of Greater Serbia, 40 
percent of non-Serbian peoples should be exterminated and 
cleansed. Here I expressed Albania's readiness to make its own 
contribution and assistance in resolving these problems through 
dialogue. I pointed out that it is indispensable that a direct 
dialogue between Chairman Rugova, a president elected through 
the free vote of the people of Kosova, and Belgrade in the 
presence of a third party is indispensable. I do not see this 
as unfruitful if there exists the will on both sides. 
  I also stressed that it is necessary that the embargo be 
related to the situation and the solution of the problem of 
Kosova and that UN monitors be sent to Kosova, so as to monitor 
and directly inform the UN Security Council about all the 
progress, obstacles, and developments that are encountered on 
the road to resolving this question. 
  I think that we achieved understanding in many directions. I 
can say that the British Government is seriously worried about 
the crisis in the region, and the situation and condition of the 
Albanians in Kosova, and is committed to paying more attention 
to them so as to resolve this problem gradually. 
  [Vokshi] Mr. President, in Great Britain you held talks with 
many businessmen, the most famous in the British business world. 
Did you see any concrete result, any concrete interest on the 
part of British businessmen in these talks? 
  [Berisha] You are right. I did regard as very important and 
I do consider very important the meetings that I held with 
businessmen. What encouraged and pleased me very much was that 
I found Prime Minister Major and Secretary of State Hurd very 
determined to encourage British investors. For this aim, I held 
a meeting at the Confederation of British Industry and presented 
the great possibilities that Albania offers. Though a small 
country to lokk at, in fact, at the investment level, Albania 
should not be considered as such, as it is a country of great 
possibilities, a country that achieves a 10-percent growth means 
that it has a strong turnover and earnings and it is a country 
where money is not lost. I think that the representatives of 
major British industry got this message in full. [passage 
omitted] 
  We discussed petroleum, airport supplies on the basis of a 
contract signed with British Petroleum, tourism, chromium, 
fishing, constructions, and other multiple fields, such as the 
glass industry. I am convinced that British investors are 
increasing their interest in Albania. The reform in Albania is 
very encouraging for them. [passage omitted] 
  The third theme that I discussed extensively with high-level 
British personalities was Albania's integration into European 
structures and Europe. I assured my interlocutors that 
Albania's great aim is its integration into Europe and that the 
Albanian Government considers this not as an immediate process, 
but as a process that will come, as an active process that comes 
through Albania's dignified efficiency to become a member of 
these institutions. Within this framework, we welcome the 
Partnership for Peace. We also insist that the time is coming 
to open negotiations for the association agreement into the 
European Community, as well as to sign an agreement with the 
Western European Union. 
  I can say that I found complete understanding among my 
interlocutors and got their assurance that they will 
unreservedly support Albania's integration into European 
institutions. 
  To conclude, I can say that this visit was extremely 
important and successful for us. I want to thank Prime Minister 
Major heartily, her majesty the queen, Secretary of State 
Douglas Hurd, and many other friends whom I met in Great Britain 
and who showed a great interest both in the development of 
relations between Albania and Great Britain and provided support 
to Albania's integration into Europe and a solution to the 
regional crisis.

<F P=106> [Report by Arben Karapici] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer] You will now hear two reports on 
economic cooperation between our country and the world. An 
agreement on Albanian-Austrian economic cooperation has been 
reached in Vienna, but both sides are of the opinion that the 
potential of cooperation relations between Austria and Albania 
is still unexploited. Based on information provided by our 
diplomatic representatives in Vienna, our reporter Arben 
Karapici has prepared the following report: 
  [Karapici] The intensification of Albanian-Austrian inter- 
governmental contacts and the exchange of visits to Vienna and 
Tirana have inspired experts and observers to express the 
opinion that economic cooperation between Albania and Austria 
seems to be frequent and fruitful. 
  After the agreement on freeing the Albanian foreign debt, 
which was reached in Vienna in early March by our bank governor, 
Dylber Vrioni, another important document has been signed in the 
Austrian capital -- an agreement on bilateral economic 
cooperation. The agreement was signed by our industry and trade 
minister, Selim Belortaja, and his Austrian counterpart Wolfgang 
Schuessel. According to the agreement, the Austrian side is 
committed to encouraging the development of projects with 
priority in our country's economy through financial means. This 
applies to industries dealing with the extracting and processing 
of minerals, metallurgy, energy, forestry, etc. This latter 
Albanian-Austrian agreement of Vienna also anticipates direct 
Austrian investment in all the priority fields of bilateral 
economic cooperation, with the participation of third countries 
as well. 
  This concrete Austrian commitment has already been expressed 
with the introduction into Albania of companies such as Rogner, 
Suag [as heard], OeMV, etc., which are already involved in 
important projects in tourism, airports, aqueducts, etc. 
  According to all the experts and observers who closely 
follow 
the frequent Albanian-Austrian cooperation, the results of the 
economic revival of our country should not be far away, as long 
as Austria shows itself as a very active partner in Albania. 
  More convincing is the argument that both parts still see 
unexploited potential in the economic exchanges between Tirana 
and Vienna. This was pointed out during the visit of Minister 
Belortaja to the Austrian capital, where they held long 
discussions about further cooperation possibilities. Thus, the 
support that Austria is committed to granting to projects of 
railroad network privatization should not be far off. In this 
regard, it is reported that Vienna has accepted Tirana's 
proposal to sign a new agreement in the field of goods and urban 
transportation. There are chances to achieve this, and they are 
considered high if we add the special interest shown in this 
case by the Austrian Industrialists Association and businessmen 
during Minister Belortaja's visit to Vienna.

<F P=106> [Interview with German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe by </F>
Liliya Popova "especially for BULGARSKA ARMIYA"; place and date 
not given: "Bulgaria Can Count on Our Full Support"] 
  [Text] German Federal Defense Minister Volker Ruehe will 
pay a visit to Bulgaria from 28 to 30 March at the invitation of 
Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov. The two ministers will 
discuss issues concerning mutual security, European defense, and 
the two countries' roles in the all-European integration process. 
  Prior to his departure for Bulgaria, Minister Ruehe answered 
some questions especially for the readers of BULGARSKA ARMIYA. 
  [Popova] Mr. Ruehe, for the first time in more than 50 years 
a German defense minister is to visit Bulgaria. How do you 
assess this fact and what does this new reality indicate? 
  [Ruehe] I would first like to point out that I am very glad 
to be able to visit Bulgaria. As you know, Defense Minister 
Valentin Aleksandrov was in Germany last fall. The new features 
in our countries' military-political relations that are 
reflected in the bilateral agreement on cooperation in defense 
policy create prerequisites for a new responsibility that our 
states have to bear in relation to European stability. 
  [Popova] During your Bulgarian counterpart's visit to 
Germany last fall you reached agreement on closer cooperation 
between your two ministries, especially in staff education. 
What projects have been implemented and which ones will be put 
into effect in the future? 
  [Ruehe] This year our two armies carried out a lively 
exchange of officers, through which your officers visited 
various Bundeswehr educational institutions. Many Bulgarian 
officers are in Germany at the moment attending various courses; 
some are attending Bundeswehr language schools and others are 
undergoing practical training in internal administration. We 
plan a further 30 such arrangements this year alone, including 
an exchange of lecturers between our staff colleges. 
  [Popova] Last year you issued an assurance that Bulgaria can 
count on German support in its efforts to join NATO. The 
serious situation in the Balkans at the moment requires a new 
security policy. Will you also assist Bulgaria in this respect? 
  [Ruehe] NATO's decision to open itself up to partners from 
throughout Europe should be regarded as one of the alliance's 
priority tasks. It gives countries like Bulgaria a good picture 
of future prospects. The Partnership For Peace program that 
Bulgaria joined last February enables us to cooperate with our 
partners from the east, deepen our relations with them, and at 
the same time to react flexibly to the needs of individual 
states. In this way the future members can be systematically 
prepared for joining these structures late. 
  The Partnership For Peace is the first important step on the 
road to integration. It should under no circumstances be 
interpreted or understood as some kind of second league 
position. Accordingly, Bulgaria can rely on our full support in 
the future. 
  [Popova] What do you think about Bulgarian policy on the 
Balkan crisis? 
  [Ruehe] I believe that Bulgaria will stick with its previous 
policy and do everything necessary to promote the peace process 
in the Balkans. Precisely in connection with the embargo 
imposed on the Danube, we attach great importance to Bulgaria 
because of geographical position. According to my information, 
Bulgaria is a model in this respect, despite the great economic 
losses it is suffering. Sarajevo, the talks between Croatia and 
Bosnia, and the recent events in Tuzla have demonstrated that 
only firm determination and intensive political and diplomatic 
efforts can provide a chance for the peace process. It has also 
become clear that a peaceful solution in the Balkans needs 
Russia to become involved and exert its influence. Bulgaria has 
an important part to play here as well.

<F P=106> [Interview with Evgeniy Ekov, secretary of the Internal </F>
Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Union of Macedonian 
Societies, by Svetlana Tikhova; place and date not given: 
"Revolutionary Terror Is Part of History"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Tikhova] Do great 
differences exist between the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary 
Organization-Union of Macedonian Societies [VMRO-SMD] and the 
VMRO-Democratic Party of Macedonian National Unity [DPMNE]? 
  [Ekov] From the historical point of view, the name is the 
same. We both claim that we have legitimately inherited it. 
Some of the tasks that our organization and [VMRO-DPMNE leader] 
Ljupco Georgievski's organization have set for themselves are 
the same, such as the democratization of the Republic of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
and the struggle for its final recognition. Nevertheless, these 
seem to be the only things that we have in common. 
Unfortunately, despite its name, the DPMNE has betrayed the 
principle on which the VMRO has always based itself and 
developed. I mean the defense of the Bulgarian spirit in 
Macedonia. An ideology has been adopted embodying a regime of 
terror and all the repressive methods of the Macedonian state, 
along with the theory of an independently existing Macedonian 
nation. Thus, Macedonian nationalism, partly rejecting the 
outdated form of the Communist Party, is trying to assume some 
kind of democratic image. Naturally, this was not accepted by 
part of the DPMNE, which was followed by an inevitable split. 
Those who thought differently organized a new VMRO -- the 
Fatherland Party [Tatkovinska Partiya], led by Dimitar 
Crnomarov, former deputy chairman of DPMNE, who was expelled for 
"pro-Bulgarian tendencies." Unfortunately, these are unpleasant 
facts that affect our national interests. However, they should 
be known so that the Bulgarian public may be acquainted with the 
biased and hostile feelings prevailing among the ruling forces 
in the Republic of Macedonia. 
  [Tikhova] In that case, what kind of Macedonia should be 
established and by what means? 
  [Ekov] It should be an independent, sovereign, and 
democratic Macedonia, based on legal, political means. 
  [Tikhova] Do you mean Vardar Macedonia, or all three parts? 
  [Ekov] We are talking about Vardar Macedonia. The truth is 
that after 1934, when the VMRO, which was an underground 
organization at the time, and the legal organizations were also 
dissolved, the slogan for an independent Macedonia within its 
geographical borders was raised. Then came World War II. The 
Paris system of peace accords actually buried the idea of a 
"geographic" Macedonia. To talk about the creation of a new, 
united Macedonia today means causing an explosion in the 
Balkans. We have a typical example of how borders are being 
shifted here. In our opinion, the Macedonian problem, whose 
crucial point is related to the fate, the rights, and freedoms 
of the Bulgarian population in Vardar and Aegean Macedonia, 
should be decided by opening the borders rather than shifting 
them. If this should appear as utopia today, it could become 
reality in the future. Let us recall that many similar 
conflicts have existed in Western Europe, but see how the 
problem between Germany and France related to the no less 
controversial territories of Alsace and Lorraine was resolved. 
There is no reason to believe that different kinds of people 
live in the Balkans, people who are incapable of settling their 
conflicts in the same manner. 
  [Tikhova] Nevertheless, the Macedonian problem also affects 
Albania. 
  [Ekov] Yes, you are talking about Mala Prespa, Korchansko, 
and Golo Brdo.... We went to Albania for the first time in July 
1993. I shall never forget what I experienced during my 
meetings with the people there. The people could not believe 
that Bulgaria had remembered them. Most of them identify 
themselves as Bulgarians, although I must admit that some of 
them behave like Albanians, while others try to appear as 
Macedonians. 
  [Tikhova] Nevertheless, how did we reach a situation in 
which it is possible to talk about Bulgarians in Albania? 
  [Ekov] Albania has not recognized a Bulgarian minority, but 
it is tolerant toward activities aimed at cultivating the 
Bulgarian spirit of self-preservation among individual members 
of our population in Albania. We have no claims and do not 
intend to raise any claims toward the Republic of Albania for 
recognizing the Bulgarian minority. In our view, the solution 
of the problem should be sought in terms of guaranteeing 
individual rights. 
  [Tikhova] The organization whose successors you are did not 
particularly respect the sanctity of human life. Does the 
historical memory of the VMRO bear some marks of guilt? 
  [Ekov] If anything is on our conscience, it may be the 
unnecessary fratricidal conflicts during some periods of our 
organization's existence. However, such deadly conflicts were 
inspired from the outside. It is impossible to react with 
traditional methods when one is deprived of all real 
opportunities whatsoever to express his free will, and when one 
is subject to physical violence and brutality. The 
revolutionary terror exerted by the organization was always a 
reaction to the violence used first in the Turkish Empire and 
later on in Greece and Serbia against the Bulgarian population. 
Whenever the VMRO had the opportunity to do so, it became a 
legal organization. World War I gave us the opportunity for the 
legal establishment of a party defending the interests of the 
Bulgarian population both in the Vardar part and in the Aegean 
region. Hence, the choice of our methods was not prompted by 
the organization, but was rather imposed by external 
circumstances. [passage omitted] 
  [Tikhova] Is it true that Mr. Tatarchev is introducing a 
split in the ranks of the VMRO? 
  [Ekov] I doubt it, because Mr. Tatarchev has repeatedly 
proved to be in sympathy with the goals and tasks of the VMRO, 
as well as with the practical activities of the organization. 
He is the descendant of a family that has given much to the 
organization. 
  [Tikhova] Generally speaking, there can be no question of a 
split within the VMRO-SMD? 
  [Ekov] I think that we have learned from the numerous splits 
of the past, and we are the only organization that has not split 
today. 
  [Tikhova] How could you resist the currently escalating 
activities of the Ilinden United Macedonian Organization [OMO] 
  [Ekov] In our opinion, we have always resisted it through 
our active propaganda work on a local scale and by our 
persistent demands that the official Bulgarian institutions 
should do their duty in preventing subversive activities 
directed against the state. Many people would like to see us 
involved in a conflict, but it has already become evident that 
such things belong to the past. As a matter of fact, OMO has 
long since been a fiction, solely supported by the interests of 
the mass media.

declared a strike alert. The nearly 100 trade union members 
also decided at a meeting in the afternoon that next Thursday 
they will protest against the dismissals which have been 
announced with a demonstration at the radio. The Independent 
Trade Union of Radio Employees also protested against the fact 
that the radio leadership, obviously for political reasons, has 
launched disciplinary procedure against Laszlo Gyori, chairman 
of the trade union and of the strike committee, and Peter 
Borenics, chairman of the Council of Public Employees. The 
Independent Trade Union of Radio Employees has confirmed its 
previous stance that the illegal measures of the radio bosses 
harm the listeners most of all, because such moves endanger 
objective information and the implementation of the radio's 
public service tasks.

<F P=106> ["Sz.Sz."-signed report: "Konya: The Government Controls </F>
the Police"] 
  [Text] The legal provision that has now been accepted 
makes it possible to create a strong and determined police force 
that protects the citizens but which exercises its rights in 
accordance with the guarantees of the constitutional state, 
Interior Minister Imre Konya said after the police law had been 
passed. He said that the process that advocates the 
establishment of a strong and determined body for the police, 
which became somewhat uncertain after the change of the regime, 
has lasted some one and a half to two years now. The reason for 
the uncertainty was that the rights of policemen had not been 
laid down in law before. The minister emphasized that the law 
regulates in detail the conditions of coercion that can be 
applied by policemen; therefore, policemen performing their 
duties legally will no longer be liable to suffer political 
attacks. Naturally, the law also contains adequate guarantees 
to prevent abuse of violent power. 
  In Konya's view, it is of utmost importance that the law 
regulates the collection of secret information in accordance 
with the constitutional state. The police are placed in the 
state apparatus in accordance with the rules of parliamentary 
democracy; according to the law, the police are part of the 
executive power, therefore they are under the government's 
supervision, the minister said. 
  In reply to our question what was the cause of the 
impressive 
majority in accepting the law, Konya said that the drafting of 
this law that requires a two-thirds majority was the result of a 
very long coordination. In his view, the successful voting was 
also helped by the fact that, before the elections, none of the 
parties wanted to have the responsibility of preventing the 
acceptance of a law that is fundamentally important for 
strengthening public security. Konya also pointed out that, in 
recent months, the parties that had previously had reservations 
about creating a strong police force have also acknowledged 
society's need for public security.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Szonda Ipsos's Public Opinion Survey </F>
Commissioned by MAGYAR HIRLAP -- What Kind of Government 
Coalition Are People Expecting?"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Party leaders keep making 
statements about which parties and under what conditions they 
would take on the responsibility of joint governing. The 
coalition variations based on these statements are very diverse. 
However, if we also consider the election prospects, the 
possible coalition setups that can actually become a reality 
after the elections can be drawn up fairly accurately, as can 
the parties that are most likely to become government-forming 
factors. It seems that this is the Hungarian Socialist Party 
[MSZP] because, according to the public, the MSZP is clear 
favorite for the elections. This can be seen from the public 
opinion survey that was carried out by the Szonda Ipsos [public 
opinion research company], commissioned by MAGYAR HIRLAP, in 
recent weeks. Some of the findings appear in this article, the 
rest -- on what kind of coalition people would welcome -- will 
be published later. The national representative survey was done 
in the first half of March and was based on a sample of 937 
people. [passage omitted] 
  As for the outcome of the elections, people give the biggest 
chance to the MSZP. To the question "Which party do you think 
will receive the greatest number of votes at the May elections?" 
40 percent placed the Socialists in first place. A relatively 
large number think that the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] 
and the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] also have a chance of 
final victory (18 and 17 percent), a little over a sixth 
assuming that they can win the elections. Far fewer people 
think the same of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] and 
the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] (10 and 7 percent), 
and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] is even more 
insignificant in this respect. [passage omitted] 
  According to our data, in the current situation, those 
questioned -- at least those prepared to give their views on 
this issue -- see the greatest chance to be for a coalition 
involving the MSZP and the SZDSZ, or a government coalition of 
the three major opposition parties. Some 20 percent of those 
who replied thought it most likely that the MSZP and the SZDSZ 
would form a government, and 14 percent saw a serious chance for 
this although they were less certain. A similar number of 
people predicted that the MSZP would accept a role in government 
together with the SZDSZ and the Fidesz (19 percent), and the 
same number thought that a joint action of the three parties had 
less chance (18 percent) than other permutations but was still 
significant. 
  The chances of the opposition parties winning the elections 
and forming a government is also increased by the fact that the 
third most frequently mentioned variation is a coalition of the 
two liberal parties, namely the SZDSZ and the Fidesz: 12 
percent of people mentioned this coalition possibility in first 
place and 11 percent in second. 
  The public gives much less chance to a coalition involving 
only the current government parties: For example, few think the 
survival of the current coalition likely (first place: 11 
percent, second place: 7 percent). Those questioned also give 
less chance to a mixed coalition of some of the current 
government and opposition parties. Some mentioned a setup with 
the SZDSZ and the Fidesz together with a government party, 
either the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] (10 and 7 percent) 
or the KDNP (9 and 7 percent respectively). The basis of a 
coalition in which the MDF could also participate (8 and 8 
percent) along with the three opposition parties would also be 
the opposition parties. The MDF also appears as a 
government-forming factor with the Fidesz and the KDNP (7 and 7 
percent). Of the coalition possibilities, respondents thought 
an SZDSZ-MSZP-KDNP coalition least likely (5 and 8 percent). 
  It is also worth mentioning briefly which coalition setup 
out 
of those examined is favored by the possible outcome of the 
elections -- namely which party the public thinks likely to win 
in May. As has already been mentioned, most people expect the 
MSZP to win the elections. If this happens then, according to 
the respondents, the MSZP may be expected to invite the SZDSZ to 
be a coalition partner, but far fewer think that the MSZP will 
also be forced to involve the Fidesz. Those questioned can 
think of many coalitions involving the MSZP, but in a 
significant number of cases they mentioned a government 
coalition without the MSZP, even though they predicted a MSZP 
victory. This fact in itself could indicate that, according to 
some respondents, the MSZP will not be able to form a government 
in spite of a successful result. It is true, though, that this 
possibility -- that the winning position is not always linked to 
a possible role in government -- can be observed in the case of 
all "winning" parties albeit to a varying extent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Everyone Fears A Different </F>
Extremism"] 
  [Text] Fears of extremist political trends have slightly 
increased in the past 18 months; however, on the basis of public 
opinion, the danger of left-wing extremism is considered to be 
small in Hungary, and the danger of right-wing extremism only 
slightly greater. This is how we can sum up the results of two 
opinion polls carried out by Szonda Ipsos in October 1992 and 
March 1993 using a sample representing the composition of 
Hungary's population. It was commissioned by NEPSZABADSAG. 
  Although the general picture has changed only minimally in 
the past 18 months, more substantial changes have taken place on 
details. The increase in political and ideological extremist 
demonstrations and activities has brought this phenomenon from a 
geographic and historical distance to our immediate proximity. 
This is also clear from the fact that, while 40 percent of the 
people refused to answer this question or evaluate the danger of 
extremist political trends in 1992, fewer people did so now, 
namely 30 percent. However, this does not mean that people 
regard the situation as dire, but they continue to express their 
concern. Summing all this up into a single scale ranging from 0 
to 100 and representing the feeling of danger, we find 29 points 
for extreme left-wing danger in the autumn of 1992 and 33 points 
in the spring of 1993; regarding extreme right-wing danger, the 
figures are 38 in 1992 and 40 in 1993. 
  Both in 1992 and 1994, a third of people said they did not 
notice any extreme left danger, which also shows that the public 
does not absolutize extremist demonstrations. On the other 
hand, the number of people who consider the problem to be 
insignificant is slightly smaller: a quarter in both cases. 
However, the increase in the number of people who regard both 
the leftist and rightist danger as a more serious problem shows 
the increase in the relative weight of fear of extremism: An 
increase from 8 percent in 1992 to 15 percent now regarding the 
leftist danger, and an increase from 17 percent to 22 percent 
regarding the rightist danger. 
  We can also simplify the issue of extremist trends to 
alternatives if we only examine which trend is regarded as more 
dangerous by the people surveyed, leftist extremism or rightist 
extremism. Both in 1992 and 1994, the biggest group was made up 
of people who see the two types of extremism as equally 
dangerous. The number of people who thought so has increased 
even more over the past 18 months, from 45 percent to 54 
percent. Among people who feel a difference between the two 
extremist trends, there are more people who think the right-wing 
danger is more serious (36 percent in 1992 and 30 percent in 
1994). The opposite view, namely a more serious leftist danger, 
was held by 19 percent in 1992 and 16 percent in 1994. 
  In this, the opinions of various social groups differ only 
slightly, people expressing identical fears form a majority, and 
there are fewer who fear left-wing extremist trends than those 
who fear right-wing extremist trends. In 1992, people with a 
basic education and currently living in villages proved to be 
most divided in judging this issue: The same number of people 
saw a greater danger from one side as those from the other side. 
Among high school graduates, more regarded right-wing extremism 
as more serious (51 percent) in 1992, and fewer than average 
regarded the two sources of danger as equal (34 percent). At 
present, the size of these two groups is identical and makes up 
40-40 percent of intellectuals. 
  If, in addition to this trend, we also consider the extent 
of 
the danger, we can conclude that every social-demographic group 
regards right-wing extremism as a more serious problem. Both in 
1992 and in 1994, with the increase in the level of education, 
people found the extreme right danger increasingly 
insignificant. While the differences in opinions of various 
groups regarding right-wing extremism were small or non-existent 
in 1992, we can now notice a considerable difference: People in 
towns, and particularly in Budapest, are more afraid of 
right-wing extremism (42 percent and 44 percent respectively) 
than people in villages (34 percent). 
  It is also worth analyzing the positions of the potential 
voters for individual parties. With only one exception, we 
could say in 1992 that the sum total of various camps considered 
extreme right manifestations more dangerous than extreme left 
ones. Supporters of the Christian Democratic People's Party 
[KDNP] saw this differently: In their opinion, the danger 
mostly came from the left. Today, the picture is much more 
varied: Among the supporters of the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF], the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP], the KDNP, and 
the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], there are more who 
consider the extreme left-wing danger more serious than the 
other danger; among the supporters of the Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], 
people stressed the danger of the extreme right. 
  Regarding the extent of the danger, the opinions of Fidesz 
and MDF supporters changed most: Compared with 1992, the 
feeling of danger from the extreme left has increased 
considerably. Consequently, supporters of both parties consider 
the extreme left to be slightly more dangerous than the extreme 
right. The same way of thinking is characteristic of KDNP 
supporters, but their position is less marked than 18 months 
ago. FKGP supporters regard the extreme left danger much more 
serious than the average, but they also fear the advance of the 
extreme right. There has been no essential change in the 
opinion of SZDSZ and MSZP supporters: They consider the extreme 
right danger more serious than the extreme left danger.

  [Text] Concluding the visit to our country by Russian 
Defense Minister General Pavel Grachev, a visit that included 
meetings with President Iliescu, the Romanian prime minister, 
and the Romanian minister of foreign affairs, the Russian guest 
held a news conference on 30 March. 
  The news conference focused on the major results of the 
visit 
and revealed the wish of both countries to put an end to the 
period of stagnation in bilateral relations. Likewise, the 
sides approached the issue of the future meeting between Ion 
Iliescu and Boris Yeltsin and Vacaroiu and Chenomyrdin. 
  General Grachev invited his Romanian counterpart to visit 
Moscow. 
  The military cooperation agreement between the two countries 
was viewed by both sides as a beginning of a period of fruitful 
cooperation. 
  During the news conference Romanian Defense Minister 
Gheorghe 
Tinca mentioned that neighborliness should not be understood as 
a strictly geographical term, as it is also a political concept. 
  He also said that we consider Greece and Turkey to be our 
neighbors because good-neighborliness is a much deeper concept 
that reflects a system of relations based on certain principles 
that cannot have substance and vitality if they are not regarded 
in a broader context.

  [Text] At the opening of today's news conference held at 
Cotroceni Palace, Ambassador Traian Chebeleu, spokesman for the 
presidency, announced that on 5 April Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic will make a one-day visit to our country. 
  According to our correspondent, the majority of the 
journalists' questions referred to issues related to the recent 
visit to Greece by the head of the Romanian state. 
  Talking about our country's stance regarding the embargo 
imposed on Yugoslavia, Chebeleu said that in Romania's general 
opinion, considering the fact that the embargo, in the way it 
was implemented, did not help to extinguish the conflict, all 
measures intended to slacken the embargo are to be saluted. 
  Answering a question related to the trade unions' request 
that President Ion Iliescu should intervene again as a mediator 
[in their negotiations with the government and the employers], 
Chebeleu reasserted the readiness of the head of state to 
intervene in various dialogues, whenever necessary, including 
the current case.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Trutzer, director of the Council for </F>
Ethnic Minorities in the Romanian Government, by Cristina 
Trepcea; place and date not given: "We Are Not Intimidated by 
the Demands of Nationalities"] 
  [Text] [Trepcea] What have the Romanian authorities done 
about meeting the commitments to the Council of Europe regarding 
ethnic minorities? 
  [Trutzer] Amendment 3 to the report on Romania's application 
for admission to the Council of Europe recommends the 
implementation of a law on ethnic minorities and education in 
the shortest time possible. In connection with the law on 
ethnic minorities, I can say that there is a draft law on 
minorities dated 7 December 1993 that was sent to the government 
authorities of the Council members for their remarks and 
amendments, and the text is to be submitted to the government to 
formulate the final draft law. By mid-April it will be 
forwarded to Parliament. In connection with the educational 
law, I can say that the draft law has been passed by the 
Commission for Education of the Chamber of Deputies and is to be 
put on the agenda of the meetings. Henceforth, everything 
depends on Parliament. 
  [Trepcea] What has been done in connection with the European 
Charter for Local Autonomy and with the Charter for Regional or 
Minority Languages -- Amendments 4 and 5? 
  [Trutzer] The text reads as follows: "It is recommended 
that it be signed as soon as possible." So far, this charter 
for regional languages has been ratified by a only one state, 
Norway, which did so in November 1993. In our country, this 
legal instrument will be examined by the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, because it involves things that have to be studied 
carefully, while reservations have to be formulated accurately. 
The same applies to the European Charter on Local Autonomy. 
The Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romanian [UDMR] 
energetically demands that these two European charters be 
ratified. In my opinion, discussions and preparations on the 
Charter for Local Autonomy may begin in accordance with 
Romania's Constitution, which, in Article 119, stipulates that 
public management in territorial-administrative units is based 
on the principles of local autonomy and decentralized public 
services. 
  [Trepcea] What can you tell us about the creation and 
operation of religious schools with a special emphasis on 
teaching children of minority groups in their mother tongue? 
  [Trutzer] This is also included in the UDMR draft law and in 
that of the Council for Ethnic Minorities. It has to be the 
subject of a special law. It is a comprehensive issue that 
requires time. 
  [Trepcea] In your view, has Romania done enough to abide by 
its pledges? 
  [Trutzer] The majority of the issues are under discussion, 
which is in a positive stage, and one can say that, even if the 
pledges have not been honored yet, we are in the process of 
honoring them. I think that we are in a good position. 
Regarding the law on minorities, for instance, "formulating" 
such a law in Switzerland took 20 years, and in Hungary three 
years. Our draft law was ready within six months. On the other 
hand, the rapporteurs of the Council of Europe have not come in 
order to scare us. We have to see things positively. Romania 
is going through a phase of serious economic difficulties. I 
think that parliamentary activity is much more important in such 
areas as economic and fiscal ones. Insofar as the minorities 
are concerned, we have made steps forward. The activity carried 
out by the Council for Ethnic Minorities in close cooperation 
with ethnic minority groups proves this. We have to cooperate. 
If one side pulls to the right and the other to the left, there 
is no possibility of moving forward. I think that the visit by 
the rapporteurs of the Council of Europe augurs well for Romania 
and we are not at all scared of them. Certainly, we will not be 
able to say that we have done what we have not yet done. What is 
important, however, is not to involve politics in minority 
problems. And there is another thing that should not be 
forgotten: The problem of minorities does not exist only in 
Romania; it is a European problem. It would be good if we were 
the first to solve it, but we cannot make any pledges in this 
respect.

  [Text] The executive leadership of the Democratic Union of 
Hungarians in Romania [UDMR] met with Geza Entz, secretary of 
state in the Hungarian Government and head of the Office for 
Hungarians Living Beyond the Borders, at the UDMR headquarters 
in Cluj-Napoca this morning. From the statements made by UDMR 
Executive President Csaba Takacs at the subsequent news 
conference, our correspondent Teodor Mateescu notes that the 
sides emphasized their similar viewpoints on the existence and 
activity of Hungarian institutions and organizations beyond 
Hungarian borders, aimed at preserving and asserting the 
Hungarian identity in the national areas where Hungarians are in 
a minority. The UDMR expressed thanks for the support of both 
the Hungarian Government and Hungarian President Arpad Goncz, on 
whose behalf Entz made this visit to Romania, with stopovers in 
Timisoara, Alba Iulia, Targu Mures, and Cluj-Napoca, to hand 
over important distinctions of the Hungarian Republic to 
prominent members of the Hungarian ethnic group. 
  In his speech and answers to journalists' questions, Entz 
pointed out that his presence in Romania these days also had an 
official character, given the invitation he received from the 
UDMR. He added that the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs was 
informed of the visit through current diplomatic channels. Entz 
said, among other things, that the Hungarian minority in Romania 
has solidly structured organizations and institutions which are 
capable of defending the interests of the community they are 
representing.

  [Text] An analysis of the activity carried out in 1993 by 
the Intelligence Protection Service-Military Unit [UM] 0215 of 
the Interior Ministry took place today in the presence of 
Senator Radu Alexandru Timofte and Deputy Petre Roman, 
presidents of the Commissions for Defense, Public Order, and 
National Security of the Romanian Parliament. On behalf of the 
ministry's leadership, the meeting was attended by Interior 
Minister Doru Ioan Taracila and Lieutenant General George Ioan 
Danescu, secretary of state and first deputy interior minister. 
  The report presented by Unit Commander Major General Dan 
Gheorghe and speeches made by subordinate cadres emphasized that 
the concerns and efforts of the unit were directed toward 
ensuring the intelligence protection of the cadres, units, and 
missions of the Interior Ministry and preventing and uncovering 
violations -- particularly in the spheres of economy, organized 
crime, and violent acts -- as well as other deeds affecting law 
and order and national security. The speakers pointed out that, 
in actions taken to fulfill its tasks and missions, the unit did 
not exceed its prerogatives and did not infringe upon citizens' 
basic rights and freedoms. 
  In his speech, Senator Radu Alexandru Timofte first said 
that 
the activity of the unit is being carried out legally and that, 
contrary to some ill-intentioned allegations, the Intelligence 
Protection Service of the Interior Ministry has well-defined 
duties that do not overlap those of other intelligence 
structures of the state. In another point, the speaker 
criticized the damaging and even inadmissible behavior of 
certain employees of the unit, who, for dubious reasons, are 
passing on secret data and information to the press, something 
that harms both the efficiency of the unit and its actual image. 
  In his turn, Deputy Petre Roman expressed the conviction 
that 
the allegations that UM 0215 was involved in political 
activities are not true. Actually, he said, the unit is 
carrying out its activity within the limits of legal provisions. 
  The presidents of the two commissions expressed the backing, 
understanding, and support of their commissions in solving the 
problems faced by this unit, including legislative and 
logistical assistance. 
  In conclusion, Interior Minister Doru Ioan Taracila praised 
the seriousness of the inquiry he attended and the 
professionalism of the members of the Intelligence Protection 
Service. He emphasized that the activity of the aforementioned 
unit, as well as that of the entire ministry, will continue to 
be carried out in accordance with the law, as in the past -- a 
communique released by the press service of the Ministry of 
Interior reads.

<F P=106> [Alexandra Andon editorial: "The 15th Military Accord"] </F>
  [Text] When General Grachev's visit to Bucharest and 
implicitly the signing of the military cooperation accord 
between Romania and Russia were postponed last December, there 
was a strong public reaction. According to the schedule, the 
Russian minister's appearance in Bucharest was to take place a 
week after the parliamentary elections in Russia, the moment 
when the "Zhirinovskiy reality and diversion" were consecrated. 
Ilie Ilascu's sentence was causing maximum tension in 
Bucharest. Under those circumstances, the Russian Embassy's 
reaction, coupled with the two unambiguous factors of political 
reality, was causing a just perceptible fear. General Pavel 
Grachev's visit and the signing of the accord already ran the 
risk of being interpreted as a gesture of succumbing to 
pressure. Two or three weeks later, with the impending visit of 
the U.S. President to Europe (Partnership for Peace, Moscow, and 
so forth), these fears were similarly intense, but had changed 
in content. The question asked was: Why is Grachev not coming, 
do the Russians not want to discuss things with us? 
  Both the attention paid to the planned event and the radical 
change in the form of concern reflected a simple truth: Russia 
is the great power next to us that cannot be ignored or provoked. 
  After 14 military cooperation accords concluded in the wake 
of 1989 between the Romanian Ministry of National Defense and 
the defense ministries in Western or neighboring countries, the 
15th accord with Russia, which will be signed at the beginning 
of next week, has been interpreted in numerous ways. 
  In fact, these documents resemble one another. As for 
differences, they lie in the form of military cooperation. 
Concluding the accord with Germany, the Romanian side was 
interested, for instance, in sending its officers for training 
by its partner. Ukraine (the last country with which such an 
accord was signed) is interested in having its naval officers 
trained in Romania. As for cooperation with Russia, we cannot 
ignore the fact that a major part of the Romanian Army's 
equipment, especially aviation, is of (ex)-Soviet origin. 
  The political will and the substance of the security policy, 
which have brought about the conclusion of a number of such 
accords, are, however, alike. The strategy is to try to repeat 
Titulescu's [inter-war Romanian foreign minister] strategy 
immediately after World War I when he initiated a basic 
bilateral accord with the Soviet Union. The fate of a small 
country affected by the turbulent currents in the Balkans did 
not permit at that time, as indeed now, a strategy different 
from that of moving closer and strengthening, in every way, 
relations with the West, while maintaining amicable relations 
with Moscow. 
  For the time being, however, the balance between the two 
great requirements is being achieved in a dynamic way by 
constantly adjusting to changes in the domestic and foreign 
political arena. The mechanism is moving, advancing along a road 
that, unfortunately, does not resemble a fast train track, but 
rather our homeland's roads. Guidance requires ability and it 
also requires the fulfillment of all the European commitments 
assumed so far, be they in the area of arms reduction or within 
the Partnership for Peace. To deny one component would be 
dangerous because it could compromise the entire thing.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dariusz Szymczycha under the rubric "100 </F>
Words"] 
  [Text] When the president says that he is fighting for 
political balance, he is actually destabilizing it. 
  He brought about a conflict recently, as well, when he 
refused to sign the "new popiwek" [tax on excess wage increases] 
law and appointed Ryszard Bender to the post of chairman of the 
National Council of Radio and Television before the legal 
dispute ended over whether the president had the right to recall 
the previous chairman, Marek Markiewicz. Thus, the Belweder is 
taking advantage of accomplished facts and accepts only the 
president's own interpretation of laws. However, one could 
expect more from the president, who is the moderator of 
political life. 
  It is very characteristic that, in recent days, the Belweder 
has multiplied conflicts. The "no" for Rosati, the budget 
blackmail, and, finally, the appointment of Mr. Bender and the 
veto of the "new popiwek" show clearly that Lech Walesa has 
decided to extend the area of his influence. All this actually 
happened, even though the coalition of the Polish Peasant Party 
and the Democratic Left Alliance often declared the will of 
constructive cooperation with the president. It also proved this 
by recognizing the president's right to fill the highest 
positions in three strategic ministries. 
  Thus, there was a chance for cooperation and balance. 
However, Lech Walesa is balancing in his own way.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Piotr Aleksandrowicz: "In the Market </F>
Direction"] 
  [Text] The president vetoed the new popiwek [tax on excess 
wage increases] because he had sound reasons to do so. He 
believes that this law gives the administration a lot of power 
to make decisions concerning tax burdens; it poses a threat to 
the implementation of the property law and to the development of 
private entrepreneurship; it strengthens administration at the 
cost of the parliament. The Sejm may override the veto; 
however, the question arises whether it could just ignore the 
arguments submitted by the president. 
  It seems that, approximately since 1991, there have been 
reasons to believe that the administrative control of wages in 
the state-owned sector might be replaced by macroeconomic 
control and negotiations between employees and employers. The 
fluidity of companies was limited, the money supply is under 
control, and inflation is increasingly lower; the unemployment 
level, however, is high, which curbs wage demands as well as the 
development of competition. 
  There is no doubt that the departure from the administrative 
control of shaping wages would be a step in the direction of 
market economy principles. 
  The popiwek, a solution that seems indispensable in the 
first 
and second year of transformations, became an increasingly less 
observed relic of the past as the situation was more and more 
stabilized. However, it was in a way comfortable to some 
authorities, establishments, and companies: It freed them from 
some of the responsibility for the economic results. 
  Abolition of the popiwek would reinforce the demands 
submitted by the National Bank of Poland, which should pursue a 
definitely anti-inflation financial policy. Similarly, it would 
set higher requirements for banks and the government in the area 
of execution of credits, taxes, and bankruptcies. Finally, the 
ministries exercising owner's supervision would have to fill 
higher requirements as well. The owner should demand 
responsibility from the directors and not, as it used to be, 
succumb to joint pressure of employees and their bosses. 
However, because the state is not an efficient owner, what we 
need is consistency in privatization and in the development of 
competition. 
  Neither the president's decision nor its approval by the 
Sejm 
threaten to cause chaos and higher inflation--on condition that 
the government will be the government, the owner will be the 
owner, and the central bank the central bank.

<F P=106> [Interview with SLD Press Spokesman Zbigniew Siemiatkowski </F>
by Andrzej Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on 
the "Guest of Radio Zet" program--live] 
  [Text] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is 
Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, spokesman for the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD]. Good morning to you, sir. 
  [Siemiatkowski] Good morning to you, too. 
  [Woyciechowski] Could you explain to everybody in two or 
three sentences--well, five at the most--what is currently 
happening in Poland? 
  [Siemiatkowski, hesitating] I mean, we are definitely 
dealing here with some form of political crisis associated with 
the fact that the president refuses to approve the candidate for 
finance minister and deputy prime minister, whose name had been 
submitted by the prime minister--that is, Professor Rosati. For 
that reason, discussions are becoming lengthy, and also there is 
the fact that Poland continues to go without a finance minister. 
  [Woyciechowski] Why does the president refuse to approve of 
Rosati? What do you think of this? What is your assessment? 
  [Siemiatkowski] I mean, of course an official [hesitating] 
explanation was provided by the president. I will just echo 
what Mr. Rosati has said: These accusations that were levied 
against him are ridiculous, and I think we are dealing here with 
a political game being played by the president, the goal of 
which is to destabilize the current political arrangement and to 
disavow the existing coalition majority, and perhaps the 
president hopes, through these measures, to break the coalition 
and perhaps lead to other types of political configurations. It 
is a well-known fact that the president always feels very 
comfortable with situations of political instability. At such 
times, his activity is always on the increase. But, in periods 
of hard and peaceful work by cabinets, the president's activity 
kind of slows down. At any rate, that is no coincidence: If 
one were to trace the whole period of President Walesa's term, 
one would see that, more or less three or four months into each 
cabinet's term, the president decides to launch a 
counteroffensive. Of course, that is not a good sign for the 
future of the political situation because every cabinet, 
including this one and this coalition, is then forced to deal 
with issues of third- or even fourth-order importance from the 
standpoint of goals and tasks for which the Cabinet and the 
coalition were established. This way, we cannot focus our 
attention on fundamental tasks, such as the current issue of 
budget implementation and the implementation of economic 
policies and the big social reforms, which we want to continue. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mr. Sejm Deputy, does the president want to 
break the coalition? 
  [Siemiatkowski] I think the president's goal in this case is 
perhaps to find differences in the existing coalition. Every 
coalition is composed of two parties that have their own 
identities and their own interests, and a coalition is always 
based on compromise, and, in this case, the coalition between 
the SLD and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] is also a compromise. 
  [Woyciechowski] So can one say that President Walesa wants 
to set the coalition members at odds. Can one put it this way? 
Could you put it in a short phrase [words indistinct]? 
  [Siemiatkowski] We thought that was the president's goal at 
the beginning of his measures, except that he came across a 
reaction that he probably could not have predicted--namely, a 
unanimous position by the PSL and the SLD, as well as the tough 
position of the prime minister, who in a very persistent manner 
confirmed that Mr. Dariusz Rosati, the SLD's candidate for 
finance minister, is also the prime minister's candidate, and we 
highly respect Prime Minister Pawlak for his position. Mr. 
Rosati is also a candidate for the prime minister's deputy for 
economic affairs, and, despite resistance from the Belweder, the 
prime minister confirmed several times that Mr. Rosati is his 
candidate. So, if the president did indeed have the goal of 
setting us at odds, he failed to achieve it. 
  [Woyciechowski] Is it true that Mr. Rosati returned to 
Warsaw yesterday? 
  [Siemiatkowski] Yes, it is. He returned for the Easter 
holiday. 
  [Woyciechowski] Is it true that Mr. Rosati withdrew his 
candidacy? 
  [Siemiatkowski] After yesterday's conversation with 
Aleksander Kwasniewski, Mr. Rosati upholds his willingness to be 
a candidate for the post. He made a decision to be completely 
at the SLD's disposal, and also at that of the entire coalition 
and the prime minister himself. We respect Mr. Rosati very much 
for his behavior because we can appreciate the very difficult 
situation he is in. Anyone else in his shoes, when faced with 
such attacks and accusations by the president and his closest 
aides, would perhaps withdraw. But still, Mr. Rosati decided 
that, because he is supported by concerted action by the entire 
Cabinet, the prime minister, the coalition, and Aleksander 
Kwasniewski, it would be inappropriate if he were to withdraw at 
this stage of the negotiations. 
  [Woyciechowski] Do you think it is still politically 
possible at this point for Rosati to be appointed deputy prime 
minister, after everything that has been said about him? 
  [Siemiatkowski] Ladies and gentlemen, both the SLD and the 
prime minister decided to make efforts to convene a meeting with 
the president himself. It is our view that, during such a 
direct meeting and conversation, when we will present once again 
all of the arguments in favor of Mr. Rosati's candidacy and in 
favor of the need to end this situation of temporariness that 
exists in the Finance Ministry, we think that, during the 
meeting, President Walesa will perhaps hear us out and change 
his mind because it is our view that the opposition should not 
be ambition driven, on both the part of the president and the 
coalition. What should prevail is thinking along substantive 
lines, and, in that regard, we think and are convinced that Mr. 
Rosati fulfills all of the criteria that should be met by the 
best candidate for finance minister. It is our view that he is 
the best candidate for finance minister right now. Poland cannot 
afford to once again see such talent and such a professional go 
to waste. 
  [Woyciechowski] You mentioned the Walesa-Pawlak-Kwasniewski 
summit meeting. When will it take place? Will it be before 
Easter? 
  [Siemiatkowski] I mean, it is the president who has the 
initiative in that regard. For our part, we have submitted--and 
that was something agreed upon by the coalition--that the prime 
minister play the role of an intermediary in these talks. The 
prime minister has such powers; it would be hard to expect 
Aleksander Kwasniewski, who is just a faction chief and has not 
been authorized to [words indistinct].... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Does that mean that the prime 
minister has addressed the president and asked for such a 
meeting and is now awaiting a reply? 
  [Siemiatkowski] According to information we received 
yesterday, the prime minister has indeed asked that a date for 
the meeting be set. 
  [Woyciechowski] Could the meeting take place today, 
tomorrow, or over the next few days? 
  [Siemiatkowski] Of course, it is up to the person who makes 
the invitations to the talks--that is to say, President Walesa. 
  [Woyciechowski] So you, gentlemen, are simply waiting for 
[words indistinct].... 
  [Siemiatkowski, interrupting] Yes, we are waiting. Right 
now, the situation is somewhat impractical because Mr. 
Aleksander Kwasniewski could not [hesitating] wait yesterday, 
and today, a Sejm delegation with Speaker Oleksy is coming from 
Moscow. 
  [Woyciechowski] Today he is meeting Yeltsin. 
  [Siemiatkowski] Yesterday, he [Kwasniewski] met the Russian 
prime minister, and a meeting with Russian President Yeltsin has 
been announced for tomorrow.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Then we will have Easter, so 
the meeting will probably take place after that. 
  [Siemiatkowski] He is coming back on Friday [1 April]--we 
will regard Saturday as a holiday--so, realistically speaking, 
one can expect such a meeting at the beginning of next week. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mr. Deputy, can the president dissolve 
parliament? He did mention such a possibility yesterday. 
  [Siemiatkowski] He certainly can dissolve it if three 
conditions, which are very precisely defined by the Small 
Constitution, are met. The president has already once taken 
advantage of such a possibility.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, what are these 
conditions? Can you tell us about them? Is it the budget.... 
  [Siemiatkowski, interrupting] It is the budget.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, this is no longer 
possible.... 
  [Siemiatkowski, interrupting] No, it is no longer possible 
because the Sejm has managed to do this within three months; 
right now the [word indistinct] is in the hands of the 
president.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The second possibility? 
  [Siemiatkowski] The second possibility is when the Sejm 
cannot form the government. However, the government has already 
been formed. Finally, the third possibility appears if a 
nonconstructive no-confidence vote is submitted, for this 
reason.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] If it is submitted and passed, 
that is? 
  [Siemiatkowski] Certainly, if it is passed. 
  [Woyciechowski] Now, such a veto cannot really be passed in 
today's Sejm. It is hard to imagine.... 
  [Siemiatkowski, interrupting] Of course. If we considered 
something like that at all, it would be a constructive 
no-confidence vote. This Sejm has drawn conclusions from the 
experiences of its predecessor.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And it does not want to allow 
itself to be dissolved? 
  [Siemiatkowski] It is not that it does not want that. 
Simply, it would not serve Poland at the moment if we entered a 
new stage of the campaign. Incidentally, we believe that what 
the president is doing today is the beginning of the 
presidential campaign, a year and a half before the actual vote. 
  [Woyciechowski] I will ask my question once again: Can the 
president dissolve today's Sejm? 
  [Siemiatkowski] I believe that this is unrealistic and 
impossible, with the majority and the strong will of political 
action in the Sejm. 
  [Woyciechowski] Is then another situation possible, which is 
for the time being only tentatively mentioned by the 
commentators of some dailies, that the SLD might leave the 
coalition? Do you take such a possibility into consideration? 
  [Siemiatkowski] Well, we defined this very precisely in the 
coalition agreement. For the SLD, the condition that must be 
met is the positive influence on the economic processes going on 
in our country. We can exert this positive influence on those 
processes by participating in the Cabinet and being in control 
of the economic ministries--that is, having our own finance 
minister, ownership transformations minister, chairman of the 
Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers [KERM]. In 
another case, the SLD could not see the possibility of 
functioning in any other governments because we realize that, in 
such a situation, our role would be merely a decorative one. 
  [Woyciechowski] However, if you were to boil this all down 
to just a few simple words, if the SLD could not appoint its own 
finance minister, we would deal with a situation that the SLD 
would leave the coalition. 
  [Siemiatkowski] We would find it hard to justify our further 
participation in the cabinet of any coalition if we lost real 
influence on the economic processes. We can even say more: We 
can proudly say that, under the SLD leadership in those economic 
ministries, economic processes are going on exceedingly 
positively. It is worth recalling that, in the first quarter of 
the year, the inflation index is at the 5-percent level. In 
both January and February, we recorded increases in the GDP on 
the level of over 4 percent. At the same time, the state's 
revenues are bigger than expected in the Budget Law. 
  [Woyciechowski] All of this was achieved without a finance 
minister. Maybe, then, we do not need a finance minister? 
  [Siemiatkowski] I would certainly not draw such far-reaching 
conclusions. Of course, this was made possible by the fact that 
the budget was prepared as it was, by the budget-related laws 
passed by the Sejm. It was also made possible by the economic 
team, which was headed by Deputy Prime Minister Borowski and 
people who stayed in the leadership of the Finance Ministry and 
KERM after Mr. Borowski resigned. Finally, these achievements 
result from the efforts made by the entire Cabinet of Mr. 
Waldemar Pawlak and Prime Minister Pawlak himself, as well as 
all of the ministers responsible for the economy--the industry 
minister, the foreign economic cooperation minister, and the 
ownership transformations minister. It is all the result of the 
work of the entire Cabinet. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mr. Deputy, what will happen if President 
Walesa does not sign the budget? What will be the 
constitutional fate of this budget? 
  [Siemiatkowski] It will, of course, return to the Sejm, and 
I believe that the Sejm is able and efficient enough to override 
the president's veto by a two-thirds majority vote. I would.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, the coalition does 
not have such a majority in the Sejm today? 
  [Siemiatkowski] Well, yes it does. This can be very 
precisely calculated. Even the four people who are no longer 
members of the SLD club announced when the budget was being read 
for the second time that, if the president vetoed the bill, they 
would vote for rejecting this veto. So, even in such a 
situation.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That means that you would have 
to be backed by someone from the parties that does not belong to 
the coalition, such as the Union of Labor or the Democratic 
Union? The coalition would still need a few votes, would it not? 
  [Siemiatkowski] Well, it would not. Exactly 
two-thirds....[pauses] I do not have the data now, but it has 
been calculated that the coalition is able to achieve this 
threshold of two-thirds of the votes. I believe that, in such 
an extreme situation, we would be backed by many votes from 
noncoalition parties, which would help us override the 
president's veto. However, I would rather be inclined to agree 
with the commentators who, commenting on yesterday's statements 
by President Walesa, write in today's press that the president 
will not decide to veto the Budget Law. He would be in a very 
difficult situation. He must take into account international 
opinion.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You believe, then, that, 
despite all that, the president will sign the budget? 
  [Siemiatkowski] Yes, I do, because this is a 
development-oriented budget. It continues the positive trends in 
our economy that became visible toward the end of last year. 
This budget was favorably received by international economic 
circles. I believe that quite significant was the decision by 
the London Club, which annulled a substantial part of the Polish 
debt. If there had not been such a budget, if it had not 
contained such prodevelopment and growth-oriented indicators, 
the club's decision would have been different. The president, 
who has so far been regarded practically everywhere as a 
supporter of reforms and a man who sees to it very rigorously 
that economic reforms in Poland are continued, would have to 
negate the activities that he has pursued so far. I believe 
that the economists the president wants to ask for advice should 
tell the president very clearly all the political and economic 
costs that Poland, and the president himself, will incur if he 
decides to oppose the trends outlined in this budget. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mr. Deputy, I am sure you have heard this 
rumor, which everyone has heard, that Aleksander Kwasniewski 
might be appointed deputy prime minister. 
  [Siemiatkowski] For today--I will use the expression of 
President Walesa--our candidate for the post of deputy prime 
minister and finance minister is Mr. Dariusz Rosati. 
  [Woyciechowski] How about tomorrow? 
  [Siemiatkowski] This will definitely call for a new 
discussion in the coalition. 
  [Woyciechowski] Is the candidacy of Paga at all possible? 
  [Siemiatkowski] It would be rather awkward if we accepted 
candidacies proposed to us from outside. 
  [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview. 
  [Siemiatkowski] Thank you.

  [Text] Szczecin, 31 Mar--The deputy chairman of the 
parliamentary floor group of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], 
Marek Borowski, former deputy prime minister and former finance 
minister, said on Thursday in Szczecin that he considered the 
fact that Lech Walesa had not signed the law replacing the 
excess wage tax [neo-popiwek] to be a declaration of war against 
the coalition. He also expressed the opinion that this was an 
attempt to make mischief within the coalition. 
  Borowski said that the president would sign the budget law 
"because, after all, there are limits to absurdity." 
  As an element of the war with the coalition, Borowski sees 
the refusal of Minister Kolodziejczyk to fill the post of deputy 
minister at the Ministry of National Defense [MON] with a 
representative of the coalition. 
  It is Borowski's view that, in this situation, parliamentary 
forces should be mobilized to reject the presidential veto. As 
far as the situation in MON is concerned, a group of 15 deputies 
from the SLD and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] should propose a 
motion in the Sejm regarding a vote of no confidence in Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk. After its acceptance, Kolodziejczyk must resign.

<F P=106> [Article by Tomasz Swiderek: "Privatization in a New Way"] </F>
  [Text] Will an employee of a privatized firm have the 
right to free shares in his enterprise? Will farmers supplying 
a privatized factory be able to count on free shares? When will 
the one and the other be able to get free shares? 
  Today the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers 
will 
deal with the draft of the new law on privatization of state 
enterprises. This draft enters into the composition of the laws 
creating the Pact on State Enterprises and, should it become 
law, will replace the standing law on privatization. The draft, 
prepared by the Ministry of Ownership Transformations, has 
already passed through the so-called interministerial 
coordination. 
<H5>  Workers' and Farmers' Shares </H5>
  The draft foresees the cancellation of the right of 
employees 
to buy, at half price, up to 20 percent of the shares or 
interest in a privatized firm. Instead, the work force would 
receive for free up to 15 percent of the shares (interest). 
  The draft imposes a condition, however, in that the combined 
face value of the shares for the employees cannot be greater 
than 18 average wages in industry (average estimate based on six 
months' worth of wages, beginning one month before the share is 
issued) multiplied by the number of employees in the firm. 
  The employees would receive their shares over the course of 
six months from the time the joint-stock company, which resulted 
from the conversion of the state enterprise, is entered into the 
trade registry. 
  At present, employees may buy shares in their firm only two 
months after the shares have been accessible to other investors; 
in other words, in reality, from about 12 to 30 months after the 
company has been entered into the trade registry. 
  The draft states that employees who received free shares 
will 
not have the right to vote at general assemblies of the company 
until the time of "the first general assembly convoked following 
the disposal of at least half of the general amount of shares 
(interest) by the state treasury." 
  The same rights as those held by employees would be offered 
to private farmers and fishermen who supply the factories with 
raw materials. However, they will have to submit a written 
declaration "of intent to acquire shares" within one month from 
the day the company was entered into the trade registry. 
<H5>  Capital Privatization </H5>
  This path would change the name to an intermediary and could 
follow the progression of: 
  --invitations to bid publicly; 
  --open tender or negotiations undertaken on the basis of a 
public invitation. 
  In the ordinance, the minister will be able to designate the 
rules for acquiring shares. 
  Without the agreement of the finance minister, shares of 
privatized companies will not be available for purchase by, 
among others, state enterprises, state banks, or banks that are 
joint-stock companies, the sole shareholder of which is the 
state treasury. 
<H5>  Direct Privatization </H5>
  In the standing law, direct privatization is called 
privatization by liquidation, and it assumes that the enterprise 
privatized in this manner can be sold, used as a contribution 
into a company, or accepted into a leasing arrangement 
["repayable exploitation"] by a so-called employee-owned 
company. Decisions about privatization by liquidation are 
undertaken by the so-called founding agencies [organy 
zaloczycielskie] (for example, those controlled by voivodships), 
but they require the permission of the privatization minister. 
  In addition, the draft states what kind of factories can be 
privatized using this method. Direct privatization cannot be 
carried out if one of the following three conditions is met: 
  --at the time of the commencement of the preliminary 
proceedings, the factory employs more than 400 people; 
  --the value of the sale of goods and services during the 
year 
before the preliminary proceedings is more than 12 million ECU's 
(converted to zlotys at the rate announced by the NBP [National 
Bank of Poland] on the day of drawing up the balance sheet for 
that year; 
  --the sum of the statutory capital and the enterprise 
capital, counted at the end of the year preceding the 
commencement of the preliminary proceedings, is more than 8 
million ECU's (conversion principle as above). 
  The draft assumes that, in justifiable cases, the 
government, 
at the request of the privatization minister, may agree to 
direct privatization even if a firm fulfills the condition 
dealing with the value of sales. 
  The draft assumes, among other things, that the installment 
payment of the debt on the factory in the case of leasing may 
last up to 10 years, and the ownership rights to the factory may 
be assigned to the employees after payment of one-third of the 
amount stated in the agreement (but not before two years). The 
time limit of two years may be reduced to one year, if the 
company has paid a minimum of half of the debt. 
  In addition, the draft states that the participants in the 
employee-owned company may not be foreign firms or individuals 
residing permanently outside of Poland. 
<H5>  Detailed Changes </H5>
  The draft also assumes many detailed changes, among others, 
surrendering the existing entry that "Privatization Directions" 
for this year are passed together with the budget. In the 
future, this document will be a supplement to the budget 
because, as is written in the explanatory statement, 
"privatization is not something separate from the whole of the 
economy. It is a basic element in the economy." 
  The draft also regulates the principles for calling forth 
boards of directors of companies and guarantees a place in the 
boards for employees as well as for private farmers and 
fishermen. 
  It also proposes deletion of the entry that a one-person 
company of the state treasury should be privatized within two 
years. In practice, this entry was not implemented in many 
cases because there were no takers for the privatized factories. 
<H5>  Transition Provisions </H5>
  The draft assumes, among other things, that the proposals on 
converting enterprises into companies not considered up to the 
date the new law becomes effective will be considered in 
accordance with the new law. If, however, as a result of the 
new law's provisions, there is an obligation to supplement the 
proposal, the proposer of the motion must do so within two 
months of the date the law goes into effect. 
  In addition, if, on the date the new law becomes effective, 
the state treasury has not yet begun making company shares 
available to the employees, they will receive them on the basis 
of the new law. Where such access has already begun, it will be 
completed on the old model.

<F P=106> [Article by Ada Kostrz-Kostecka: "KERM on Ownership </F>
Transformation; Everyone Will Privatize Something for Oneself"] 
  [Text] The law on privatization of state enterprises has a 
constitutional character, and, because comments and proposals 
were made up to the last moment, it was not possible to make a 
decision on the spot. For that reason, during the Thursday, 10 
March, KERM [Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers] 
meeting, it was decided that a coordination meeting would take 
place on Thursday, 17 March, and, on Friday, 18 March, KERM 
would state precisely its position concerning this issue. 
  It turns out that the proposals went very far, when, 
practically speaking, there is another privatization 
philosophy--the divergence between KERM members concerned about 
who is to initiate the privatization procedures, who is to 
represent the State Treasury, the role of the chief of the 
privatization ministry, and the role of particular ministries. 
  Even during the interministerial coordination meeting, as 
RZECZPOSPOLITA learned, it was proposed that the Ministry of 
Privatization [MPW] convert state enterprises into commercial 
operations, with the enterprises' concurrence. During the KERM 
proceedings, Marek Pol, minister of industry and trade, proposed 
instead that the decision on the whole process of privatization 
pass into the hands of branch ministries. The MPW would, in 
practice, have the role of a consulting firm at the level of 
preparing the privatization process as well as a store with the 
enterprises, with the signing of the contract. And the Ministry 
of Industry would like to be involved not only with the 
privatization of these industrial and trade enterprises, for 
which it is currently the founding body [organ zalozycielski], 
but also with those under the jurisdiction of voivodes 
[administrative heads of the voivodships]. 
  This idea was accepted by the representative of the Ministry 
of Agriculture. The Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations 
would like to go even further, separating foreign trade 
enterprises and independently attending to their privatization. 
  In the meantime, the Ministry of Privatization, as stated by 
Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek at a press conference during a break 
in the KERM meeting, assumes granting the enterprises 
far-reaching powers that would allow them to decide on the means 
of privatization. It was also proposed to abolish the half-year 
time period allowed to select the privatization path, leaving 
the enterprises with possibilities not restricted by time to 
undertake these initiatives. 
  Minister Kaczmarek, when asked by reporters how he would 
react if the idea presented by Minister Pol were to be accepted, 
said that he would protest such a move because it was not the 
privatization direction to which he had agreed. In his opinion, 
this is an attempt to rebuild the branch structures. In 
Minister Kaczmarek's opinion, discussion would be easier if the 
package of laws concerning the State Treasury were to be 
considered first. 
  The other subject of discussion dealt with the range of 
preference for the employees. The Ministry [of Privatization] 
takes the position that there should be 15 percent of free 
shares, along with an absolute limit (the value of the 
preferences cannot exceed 18 average wages). On the basis of 
the discussion, KERM members aligned themselves rather with the 
10-percent free shares concept, but with restrictions on the 
rights to their transferability. They could be, for example, 
registered shares (as KPW [Securities Commission] wants to 
have), or they could be transerred in lots of up to 5 percent 
annually. 
  In response to questions, Minister Kaczmarek said that there 
is no concept for privatization of the 
agricultural-food-processing industry. On Friday [11 March], 
the minister was in Lowicz, and he spoke with representatives of 
the food-processing industry there and came to the conclusion 
that a concept of merging agricultural producers with the 
privatization of that sector (regardless of whether they get 10 
or 15 percent of the shares) is not a solution for 
privatization. What is necessary are ideas and money for that 
industry to make marketable products. The minister's resistance 
also brings up the proposition that cooperatives have the right 
to a portion of the shares of processing industries, the more so 
because there are many individuals in, for example, the budget 
sphere, who do not have such privileges.

  [Text] "This year's Defense Ministry budget is so 
limited that the country's security is endangered," said General 
Zbigniew Zalewski, chief of the logistics inspectorate of the 
General Staff, during yesterday's economic meeting of Army 
leaders. 
  It was the first economic meeting since 1989 with the 
participation of commanders of all military districts and of 
commanders of all types of the Armed Forces. 
  Acting Finance Minister Henryk Chmielak, who took part in 
the 
meeting, argued that the Defense Ministry's budget is a result 
of a "difficult compromise," but the military present at the 
meeting were of the view that it is the Army that is the victim 
of the compromise. Gen. Zalewski argued that it would be easy 
to help the Army by limiting tax levels because it is "illogical 
for the Army to put money back into the budget and then use this 
same money." 
  The officers argued that the Army finds it hard to adapt to 
the market economy. They complained of a lack of laws that 
would make it possible for the Army to sell unused buildings, 
storage areas, or garages, while there is no money to continue 
to maintain the premises. 
  The topic of wasting resources in military housing, revealed 
by the Supreme Chamber of Control, was discussed repeatedly. 
According to the general cadre, "deficiencies of human nature" 
were the main reason for what happened. The logistics chief 
assured that clearing up the issue completely and bringing the 
guilty to justice is in the Army's interest.

  [Text] More than ever before, the question of Kosova has 
been put on the daily agenda of international issues, President 
Rugova stressed in a recent interview with ZERI journal. 
  Speaking about the possibility of starting the process of 
resolving the Kosova problem, Rugova stressed that the 
Muslim-Croat agreement in Bosnia and, before it, the NATO 
ultimatum, mark the beginning of the process of ending the war 
in Bosnia. Within this framework, we can consider the 
possibility of the necessity of resolving the Kosova issue. 
  After assessing the pragmatism of U.S. policy and its role 
in 
considering the question of Kosova, President Rugova added that 
so far, Europe has enabled the preservation of the status quo 
but not the solution of problems in former Yugoslavia. He 
stressed the role of U.S. initiative in mediation, in which 
European allies should take a part in consultation with Russia. 
  He added that the beginning of a dialogue would mark an 
important achievement, although dialogue should be seen as a 
process. We should be prepared for negotiations to defend our 
position.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek by Edouard Van </F>
Velthem in Brussels; date not given: "Slovene Rapprochement With 
NATO and Europe"] 
  [Text] [Van Velthem] You are in Brussels to sign the NATO 
offer of Partnership for Peace, yours being the first 
independent republic of the former Yugoslavia to be involved in 
that initiative. Do you believe that it provides sufficient 
security, or do you expect more from the alliance? 
  [Drnovsek] We are rather satisfied...no doubt because we are 
fairly realistic. We were not expecting more at this time 
because we know that the alliance is a complex organization, 
comprising a large number of members, and that there are 
questions of coordination to be settled for the implementation 
of the concept of enlargement. 
  However, this flexibility is an advantage for us, because it 
will enable us to progressively become involved in the process 
of common defense and security. We have made a firm decision to 
continue in this vein, and we are sure that the final stage, in 
the years to come, will be full membership of NATO for Slovenia. 
  [Van Velthem] At the same time, you are also asking for the 
arms embargo still imposed on the whole of Yugoslavia to be 
lifted... 
  [Drnovsek] The embargo was imposed right at the start of the 
Yugoslav crisis, from which Slovenia escaped nearly three years 
ago. However, it was no doubt much easier for the superpowers 
and the United Nations to leave the decision in place, for any 
modification in terms of moving toward lifting the embargo 
threatened to snowball toward Bosnia-Herzegovina and the other 
war zones. 
  Today, beacuse of such inertia, Slovenia remains a victim 
trapped by that measure for no reason whatsoever. However, we 
are pragmatic and do understand the actual state of affairs 
within the region. So we are waiting, confidently... 
  [Van Velthem] Willy Claes and Alain Lamassoure have both 
successively visited Ljubljana: Slovenia is accelerating its 
rapprochement with the European Union (EU). 
  [Drnovsek] The EU is a natural partner for us. Sixty percent 
of our trade is already conducted with the union. The 
cooperation agreement in application today was signed at the 
beginning of last year. It is satisfactory, but we intend to go 
beyond it in the very near future, all the more so since we 
believe we have already made much more progress than certain 
other countries which already benefit from associate status. 
The talks on this subject will start in May, and provided that 
everything runs as scheduled, it should be possible to sign by 
the end of the year. 
  [Van Velthem] How did the Slovene economy transform itself 
following the dismantlement of the former Yugoslavia? 
  [Drnovsek] The economy is making good progress. Admittedly, 
in the wake of achieving independence in 1991 we found it 
difficult to adapt after losing the domestic markets and 
experiencing a drop in industrial activity. However, since 
1993, more rapidly than even we had predicted ourselves, we are 
once again experiencing positive growth, and have brought down 
inflation sharply -- indeed, it dropped from 270 percent when 
our currency, the tolar, was introduced to approximately 20 
percent last year. 

<H5>    We Will Pay Our Debts </H5>
  [Van Velthem] And tourism, formerly an appreciable source of 
revenue for Slovenia? 
  [Drnovsek] It is starting to develop again. Above all for 
people from neighboring countries, such as Italy, Austria, or 
Germany, increasing numbers of whom are coming to Istria and the 
Adriatic coast. On the other hand, tourists from further afield 
are still more cautious, perhaps because they still picture 
Slovenia as being directly involved in the Yugoslav conflicts. 
  [Van Velthem] Nonetheless, the republics have yet to share 
out the debts and assets of the former Yugoslavia... 
  [Drnovsek] That is true. We are not at all satisfied with 
the slowness of progress on the question of Yugoslav succession 
at the Geneva conference. Admittedly, up to now most of the 
other republics have been saddled with other problems. Slovenia 
did not expect a definitive agreement on this question: We have 
already settled our financial relations with the IMF, the World 
Bank, or the Club de Paris, and we are negotiating with the 
international banks the share of the commercial debt of the 
former Yugoslavia that has been assigned to us. We want to 
present a very clear bill of health of our financial situation. 
So the only thing that will remain to discuss with our former 
partners is how to share out our common heritage, especially the 
embassies and other buildings that Yugoslavia had abroad. 
  [Van Velthem] Do the Bosnian refugees who were flowing 
toward 
Slovenia at the start of the war still represent a major burden, 
both financially and socially? 
  [Drnovsek] It is not as worrying a problem for us as some 
demagogues are attempting to make out. There are still 
something like 30,000 refugees, and we have done everything 
possible to ensure that they can lead as normal an existence as 
possible in terms of housing, food aid, and psychological 
support. It is our elementary duty to show such solidarity. 
<H5>  Need for Domestic Stability </H5>
  [Van Velthem] The night before you came to Brussels, the 
Slovene Parliament dismissed Defense Minister Jansa from office. 
Is the coalition government, comprising your Liberal Democratic 
Party, the Christian Democrats led by Mr. Peterle, and the 
Social Democrats led by Mr. Jansa now threatened? 
  [Drnovsek] I do not think we are heading for a domestic 
crisis. The defense minister was replaced in the wake of a 
specific incident, and if the Social Democrats leave the 
government, then we are prepared to continue with the Christian 
Democrats alone. Following this option would just enable us to 
retain the majority. 
  [Van Velthem] So there are no plans to hold elections, which 
would plunge the country into a state of uncertainty? 
  [Drnovsek] I do not think so. And I have good reason to 
believe that: If elections were held today, then the polls show 
that my own Liberal Democratic Party would emerge as the main 
victors. Consequently, the other political groups are in no 
hurry to return to the ballot box. Above all, the entire 
country first needs continuity and stability. After all, we are 
in a good position to know what a political crisis and power 
vacuum can mean....

  [Text] At the joint session with the party's executive 
committee late last night, the council of the Slovene Christian 
Democrats [SKD] decided to propose to Prime Minister Dr. Janez 
Drnovsek that the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia [LDS] and the 
SKD form a government themselves. Sandi Frelih reports: 
  [Frelih] Even before the decision to impeach Defense 
Minister Janez Jansa, the SKD announced that it would reconsider 
its further cooperation in the government. At the end of last 
week, the highest party officials discussed this, however they 
postponed any decisionmaking until the extraordinary 
parliamentary session. At the joint session of the party 
council and executive committee last night, they actually 
discussed two possibilities -- immediate departure from the 
government as proposed by Ivan Oman and the proposal of the 
party leadership to stay in the government, but under certain 
conditions. 
  For the first time so far, the party council took a secret 
ballot. By 20 votes to 11 they decided that the LDS and SKD 
should themselves form a government of speedy and accelerated 
democratic and economic development of Slovenia, as the 
conclusion says. 
  They also explain that such a decision in the times of 
political crisis is dictated by the hitherto cooperation of both 
parties, the current political situation, and the need to 
establish a new political balance, which would all help 
stabilize the political circumstances in divided Slovenia. 
  They put Lojze Peterle in charge of the negotiations with 
Dr. 
Janez Drnovsek. They expect the reply of the LDS president by 7 
April. 
  SKD Secretary General Edvard Stanic is of the opinion that 
the political balance in the government after the departure of 
the Social Democrats is 2 to 1 and should be balanced out. He 
is also of the opinion that a coalition agreement, which would 
involve a greater degree of reciprocity and trust, should be 
drafted. When asked what they will do if the prime minister 
decides to keep the United List in the government and draws 
another right-wing party into it, Stanic replied that a new 
situation would emerge that would have to be discussed anew. 
They definitely expect Drnovsek's reply by next Thursday when 
the party council will meet again. 
  Let me also add that Drnovsek has already been announcing 
changes in the coalition, saying that the coalition will have to 
be balanced out again.

<F P=106> [Interview with Arben Djaferi, president of the Party for </F>
Democratic Prosperity, by Panta Dzambazovski; place and date not 
given: "Macedonia Has a Future If a Historic Agreement Is 
Reached"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Dzambazovski] How do you 
view The Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM], with autonomy for the Albanians, with 
cantons, or the way it is now? 
  [Arben] In this matter, we want the Albanians to be a 
constitutive element. We ask Macedonia to cultivate a democracy 
of consensus. We see the possibility for equality in 
constructing special institutions of education, culture, and so 
on, as well as a kind of a broader autonomy for the communes, 
according to European standards. 
  [Dzambazovski] Do you mean communes according to the map of 
the so-called "Ilirida?" 
  [Arben] To be honest, I do not know what that map looks 
like, but I know that the people who have engaged themselves in 
that matter have a grotesque approach to policy. I know that 
the man elected for president of such an autonomous region is 
now president of a parallel branch in Gostivar. That makes it 
clear how much those people with their list of wishes are 
lacking in seriousness, and they do not know the mechanisms. 
  [Dzambazovski] Compared to your faction? 
  [Arben] First of all, we are not a faction, we are the PDP 
[Party for Democratic Prosperity]. The answer to your question 
is positive because we are a serious party and serious 
politicians. 
  [Dzambazovski] You mentioned equal representation of the 
Albanians in the institutions. In number, from the professional 
viewpoint, or how? 
  [Arben] I have a different approach. A historic agreement 
is needed. Without such an agreement we can continue the agony 
and waste our energy. History shows that after such agreements 
a period of great stability has come about in many countries. 
It is easy to operate after an agreement. 
  [Dzambazovski] If there is such a climate and if your 
proposals are acceptable? 
  [Arben] It is wrong to think that. The agreement will 
certainly stop the confusion. The Europeanization of the region 
is our long-term goal, while our short-term goals are issues 
that we can solve through policy, like the introduction of 
institutions into the Albanian way of life, starting from 
kindergarten. 
  [Dzambazovski] Does this imply that you think the Albanians 
are endangered? 
  [Arben] I think we are. There have been many decadent 
processes within the Albanian people, which must become a 
concern of the Macedonians, too. 
  [Dzambazovski] Do you personally feel you are endangered? 
  [Arben] I can be very flexible as an individual, and when I 
feel I am endangered, I can slow down. However, we are changing 
the identity of the collective -- the cultural identity, which 
is not the same as that in Albania, where there are all the 
necessary institutions, or in Kosovo, where there used to be 
such institutions. We are endangered because we do not create 
values, and we create bad values, wasting our time on vain 
projects. I think there are many political goals that we can 
realize without including the Macedonian political factor. We 
shall work toward conquering that political space, we shall 
create values that depend exclusively on ourselves. We must 
introduce into the Albanians' lives institutions that must not 
present an obstacle for any political party, because we shall be 
engaged in our own political space. 
<H5>  Outside the Macedonian Space? </H5>
  [Dzambazovski] However, you cannot bypass the Macedonian 
parliament, speaking of such issues. 
  [Arben] That is why we are taking one step at a time. We 
must reach a historic agreement, and the way to do so is through 
terms that we shall have to agree on, about who is going to 
create what. We are not asking to enter the Macedonian space. 
  [Dzambazovski] It sounds like creating parallel institutions 
in the state. 
  [Arben] No. I am talking about the fair competition that we 
must have, from culture to sports. The Macedonians in the area 
where they are dominant are competitive, and thus new values are 
created. However, the Macedonians in western Macedonia, for 
instance, are the same as the Serbs in Kosovo -- they are not 
competing, because they are "genetically disposed" to having the 
values, to being employed, to getting a flat, and so on. The 
Macedonians in eastern Macedonia have to strive to achieve the 
same advantages. It is absurd, but it is true that the 
Albanians have a better understanding with the Macedonians in 
eastern, than in western Macedonia. It is no wonder that the 
Macedonians in the western part are working hard to maintain the 
present relations between the Albanians and the Macedonians. I 
also wish to say that the danger for the Macedonians does not 
come from the Albanians or Albania, but from Serbia and 
Bulgaria, which only sees the country in terms of territory. 
  [Dzambazovski] It is true that official Albania supported 
your faction in the long process of divisions within the PDP. 
Why? 
  [Arben] That is how it looks from the outside. If we 
analyze the pictures, we come to that impression. Albania's 
influence I think, must be relevant in Macedonia, because it is 
a stabilizing factor in the Balkans, and it affects some 
stabilizing political processes. I think we have the right to 
communicate with the political factors in the Balkans, 
particularly with Albania. 
  [Dzambazovski] Yet, you did not say why Albania supports 
you. 
  [Arben] Certainly because we are more serious and because we 
have constructed a political vision for Macedonia, without 
projects like just employment in the system's institutions. 
  [Dzambazovski] However, it is true that the PDP is an 
indigenous party, active in Macedonia with its program. 
  [Arben] Yes, it is true, but the PDP also asks for 
legitimacy in the Albanian tissue in the Balkans, and that is 
natural, as it is for the Macedonian parties related to the 
diaspora. I think that if we have the support of Albania, we 
are on the right road, because the whole Albanian political 
course in the Balkans has demonstrated political maturity in the 
latest crisis. 
  [Dzambazovski] There is one view that the affair of the 
paramilitary formations of Albanians in Macedonia lies behind 
this support. 
  [Arben] That is political intrigue. And finally, why do you 
not talk about the so-called affair with those who are involved 
in it -- some Albanians and the Macedonian authorities, who 
certainly know more. Taci and I, as well as the others, have no 
connection with it. 
  [Dzambazovski] Why do you make so many remarks regarding the 
work of the delegates and ministers? 
  [Arben] There is a transition going on in Macedonia, but 
with people who used to be in positions, including the 
Albanians. It is a kind of a silky communist transition. Our 
demands are deeply human, they are not irrational, and we hope 
to find people who think the transition must be better. 
Tensions must be avoided. 
  [Dzambazovski] Can they also be created by you? 
  [Arben] Yes, if Macedonia does not establish a European 
system of values. Then such tensions arrive. We shall ask for 
support from the foreign factor, and we shall ask for the right 
to self- organization, which starts with the political 
organization of the political structure. We will gain 
efficiency in our political activity if there is a strong 
political organization, a public one. At this stage we are 
trying to strengthen a political structure that was not strong. 
There was a political elite in the system, and the other 
political subjects were on the fringes, for instance the 
delegates who have much stronger political semantics. 
<H5>  [Box, p 15] </H5>
<H5>  "If There Is a War in Kosovo, I Shall Volunteer" </H5>
  The vice president of the faction, Menduh Taci, also made a 
statement at the interview with Arben Djaferi. Here is a part 
of that statement: 
  "I stated the following for the London OBSERVER: If there is 
any destabilization, it will be as a result of the Macedonian 
authority's mistake, the Macedonians, because the Macedonians 
are the majority. 
  "Some Greek Dzambazovski asked my opinion about the name of 
the state. I said that the citizens of Republic Macedonia must 
decide about the name, and that the Albanians should be included 
in the dispute with Greece. 
  "The Albanians do not want bloodshed. The Macedonians should 
know who their friends are. Certainly not Serbia, nor 
Bulgaria, because it does not want to hear of the existence of 
the Macedonian people, and we know about Greece. So who is left? 
  "We are constantly accused of being radicals. I shall say, 
in principle -- in constitutional and legal principles, if we 
have agreed on a matter, we want to have a definite term for its 
realization. If the Government wishes to make policy with 
`representatives of the people,' it is doing its people wrong. 
The times of such tricks belong to the Turkish era. 
  "Will we organize assistance and volunteers if there is a 
war 
in Kosovo? It is not just a positive answer, but I also state 
that I, personally, will go to Kosovo as a volunteer -- that is 
my right and nobody can stop me. 
  "The issue on autonomy will depend on the Macedonian 
parliament and the attitude of the Macedonian authority. And 
`Ilirida' is an empty project of delegate Mersim Polozani, from 
the time when his rating was decreasing. 
  "The document shown by Naser Ziberi on A1 Television 
Broadcast looks like a `headquarters document of Lazar Mojsov.' 
Let us see the record -- it is not my signature, neither are 
the alleged tasks for cooling down interethnic relations, and so 
on. Nevertheless, I do not want to sue him, because I do not 
want to adopt his or Djeladin Murati's manners. 
  "It is a public secret how Muhamed Halili became a candidate 
and how he won the elections. I conducted the campaign. If he 
thinks he has confidence in the constituency now, let him come, 
we shall present a candidature."

<F P=106> [Report by Panta Dzambazovski: "Retirement from the </F>
Institutions of the System"] 
  [Text] After the interview with Arben Djaferi, president 
of the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] radical faction, 
and vice president Menduh Taci that was published in the 26 
March edition of our newspaper, some matters related to the 
division within the largest party of the Albanians in Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] are 
becoming clearer. The conflict within the PDP is not at all 
naive, and it involves two irreconcilable currents. Both claim 
to have the right to the name PDP. The radical faction, 
according to the statements, doesn't intend to negotiate with 
the group of delegates and ministers, it considers them "old 
communist personnel," "Gligorov's men," "participants in the 
silky communist transition of Macedonia." The intention of the 
radicals is to create Albanian "cultural" institutions in 
Macedonia, "without entering the Macedonian political space." 
What is not clear is whether they have parallel institutions in 
mind, as well as the question for or against autonomy to the 
Albanians, except for the fact that such projects as "Ilirida" 
in the past were ridiculous. What is not only of great concern 
to the members and PDP fans, but also for Macedonia in general 
is the struggle for the name of the party. The radicals are not 
alone in having no intention of forming, that is registering, a 
new party with another name or a suffix to the name PDP, but are 
also resolute in fighting for the name until the end. Even if 
the state, or the competent bodies, don't allow them to enter 
the Fall elections with their candidates under the name of PDP, 
they have announced that they were backed by "an enormous 
membership, which should mean something," and that there was a 
"counter project" planned, as Djaferi stated, if such a decision 
is taken by the authorities. And if the state takes such a 
decision, it is clear that the actions will be outside the 
institutions. Taci added they had all the facts on their side, 
and if the police tried to solve the dispute "anything may 
happen." 
  It seems that these statements were certainly meant to warn 
of the possibility of arousing the people, which certainly 
represents the worst and most dangerous variant, an experiment 
that has taken place in other regions. How large the membership 
is and who the "people" behind them are cannot be divined, 
however, in some chance situations, a statement about an alleged 
"hunt against the Albanians" can sometimes be sufficient to 
invalidate all the political efforts for coexistence. 
  In a situation where the delegates and ministers are 
continuing their political engagement in the institutions of the 
system, we can conclude that the goal of the radicals is to 
discredit the people in authority and in the institutions, in 
order to force the delegates and ministers to retire from the 
government. 
  The example of the Tetovo assembly is very characteristic. A 
normal police action in which a number of Albanians were 
arrested for the illegal possession of arms and explosives 
became a political problem. The assembly convoked a session on 
that topic, it invited Ministers Frckovski and Gosev, it even 
demanded the presence of President Gligorov. The delegates 
connected this case regarding the 10 accused with the creation 
of a paramilitary army, although the competent bodies said it 
was not the case and that the police would perform their duties 
no matter which nationality was involved. Of course, is there a 
country in which a local authority discusses a number of people 
caught with arms, asks for their liberation, and moves the 
process in another direction? There are opinions that the Tetovo 
assembly is testing its possible future activities as a parallel 
institution (parallel parliament). 
  It is worthwhile mentioning that the PDP delegates in the 
Tetovo assembly are 90 percent dedicated to the radical group, 
headed by the head of the delegate group. They are working 
under the direction of Taci's and Djaferi's group. Some sources 
claim that the session dedicated to the arrested Albanians and 
attended by the PDP ministers had the unique goal of 
discrediting them as representatives of the authority that is 
"carrying out arrests," so as to make them retire from the 
government, thus increasing the possibility of actions outside 
the institutions. 
  Due to the intensified actions of the radicals, there is 
evidently increased nervousness among the delegates' and 
ministers' group, which is trying hard to create a new image in 
the period before the elections by saying that the authority is 
supported by Taci's group (following the session with the 
government), issuing information about the arrested Albanians, 
and accusing the authority of which, by the way, they are a 
part. Before that it demanded that the court decide about the 
legitimacy of the PDP, and, because of unfavorable reactions 
among the Albanian radical political factors, it withdrew the 
charges. Apparently the delegates' and ministers' group is 
making mistakes in the new situation, which is not the case with 
the radicals. The basic mistake is that it is trying hard to 
show itself in a different light and be what it is not. As long 
as it is so, the radicals will be on the offensive.

<F P=106> [G. Mihajlovski commentary: "A Group Photograph With the </F>
Forest Ranger"] 
  [Text] The United States has taken matters into its own 
hands. Just like the joke about the partisans and Germans 
fighting in the forest, when the forest ranger arrives and kicks 
the latter and the former out of the forest. The United States 
has been observing the EU countries expressing all their 
principles, vetos, ministerial councils, rotating presidencies, 
voting practices, and declarations without displaying the 
strength to cope with the Greek-Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] dispute, and it finally decided to 
send its own man to try and finish the job. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy, New York lawyer 
Matthew Nimietz, was very clear: "We bear in mind the fact that 
we have very friendly relations with both sides, but also the 
fact that this issue is of concern to the region and the world." 
He was even more plain in Athens: "This is a dispute that 
endangers peace and stability in the region, therefore it is of 
concern to the United States." 
  Formally, Niemitz is only helping the interrupted 
negotiating 
process begun under the sponsorship of the United Nations. 
Therefore, the fate of future Macedonian-Greek relations, right 
now, depends on the skills of Cyrus Vance and Matthew Niemitz -- 
both New York lawyers. 
  After recognizing Macedonia, the United States halted the 
establishment of diplomatic relations because of Greece's 
opposition. However, its clear interest in this region was 
expressed for the first time last Summer, when 300 U.S. soldiers 
landed at Skopje Airport and joined the UNPROFOR forces. The 
inclusion of Niemitz in the mediation process between Greece and 
FYROM, particularly the arrival of John Shalikashvili, chairman 
of the U.S. Armed Forces Joint Chiefs of Staff, in Skopje that 
same week, only added to the belief that the United States is 
really determined to have a strong influence in this part of the 
Balkans. 
  Greece, on the other hand, is caught in a very inconvenient 
position -- on the one side pressed and embarrassed by its 
partners in the European Union, and on the other side limited in 
its actions because of public opinion, to which it continually 
serves up mass national meetings, has also turned to the United 
States. After discussions with Niemitz, Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papulias stated that he hoped the following weeks would 
give a positive result. Papulias's optimism becomes more 
understandable in the context of the announced visit of Greek 
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to the United States, 
scheduled for 22 April. Namely, Niemitz made it clear that 
Washington would like to see the dispute between the two 
countries solved before this date. 
  In view of Clinton's posing with Tudjman and Izetbegovic for 
reporters after setting down on paper their Constitution within 
two weeks, something the European Union did not succeed in doing 
in two years, a logical question arises: Will Gligorov and 
Papandreou have a picture taken together with the "forest 
ranger" before or after 22 April?

  [Text] Prompted by the latest wave of ethnic cleansing in 
Banja Luka and the surrounding villages under Serbian 
occupation, President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Alija 
Izetbegovic has written separate letters to the UN Security 
Council, UN Secretary General's special envoy Yasushi Akashi, UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata, and President of 
the International Red Cross Antonio Samaruga. 
  There is concrete evidence that every day, Karadzic's 
fascists are expelling some 300 Bosniaks and 150 to 200 Croats 
from Banja Luka. The exiles are first stripped of all their 
property, including their savings and personal jewelry. 
President Izetbegovic draws attention to the fact that the UN 
Protection Forces, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the 
International Red Cross are providing the one-way 
transportation, and warns that their duty is actually exactly 
the opposite. They are supposed to guarantee all the people's 
survival in their home towns and on their ancestral hearths, 
stresses President Izetbegovic in letters addressed to the most 
prominent UN officials and the International Red Cross.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1300 GMT on 31 March carries in its 
regular 34-minute newscast several reports updating the fighting 
in the republic. 
  Gorazde correspondent Enes Musovic reports on the continued 
fighting in the region and says that "the fierce fighting, with 
periodic hand-to-hand fighting, has resulted in significant 
losses for the aggressor side. Nevertheless, the (?drugged) 
Chetniks are treading over the dead bodies of their criminal 
colleagues and are themselves being killed. Exceptionally 
fierce and frequent Chetnik infantry attacks are accompanied by 
fierce fire from all types of artillery weapons [words 
indistinct] in the region of (?Zigovi) and [name indistinct] is 
in flames. Everything here is in flames. The Chetniks have 
encircled Gorazde with 40 tanks. Despite heavy losses in 
manpower, the mercenaries of the so-called Srpska republic are 
relentlessly charging on. Some time after 1200 they crossed the 
bridge on the (?Praca) River in Ustipraca with the aim of 
infiltrating the region of Gojcevici and Surovi. They were 
resolutely challenged by Gorazde's defenders. The fighting is 
fierce, but we still have no information on the development of 
these extremely [word indistinct] events." 
  Smajl Terzic reports from Doboj on the situation in the 7th 
South Operative Group's theater of operations and says that "the 
situation in this theater is extremely serious today. The 
aggressor on three occasions attempted to [word indistinct] 
artillery, but [words indistinct]. In the course of the morning 
and the early afternoon, the aggressor has been regrouping his 
manpower and equipment, and has been relentlessly targeting 
civilian targets. Except for material damage, no casualties 
have been reported." 
  An unidentified correspondent from Kladanj reports that 
"[words indistinct] numerous weaponry of all calibers, 62-mm and 
120-m mortars, 105-mm, 122-mm, and 152-mm howitzers, T-55 and 
T-84 tanks (?are being used to shell) both the center and the 
outskirts of the town, and the road communication Kladanj-Tuzla. 
This relentless shelling of the innocent civilian population 
has resulted in the serious wounding of 10 people. No one has 
been killed." 
  Olovo correspondent Amira Salihbasic reports that "the 
aggressor today continued shelling the free Olovo territory with 
long-range artillery. In the morning hours the enemy used PRAGA 
[self-propelled antiaircraft artillery] and mortars to shell our 
defenders' positions in the area of Bacici. The enemy also 
intensified his antiaircraft gunfire. The residential areas of 
the town were also shelled this morning, as were the residential 
areas along the Krivaja River." 
  The studio announcer reads a report from the 1st Corps 
Information Service and says that "the Chetniks today continued 
their usual small arms' provocations from their positions in 
Grbavica, Orlovac, Kromolj, and Sjenicka Kosa. Brekin Potok and 
the area around Vrbanj Most were targeted by various types of 
weaponry, while a rocket from a portable launcher landed on 
Slatina. Enemy snipers were active in several places, so it is 
necessary to exercise caution when moving around the city."

<F P=106> [By Nevenka Marcic] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, March 31 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems have 
launched a new offensive, "spring '94", from the Moslem enclave 
of Gorazde, one of the U.N.-protected "Safe Areas" in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina which should have been demilitarized last 
spring, Bosnian Serb military sources said on Thursday. 
  According to the same sources, around 10,000 Moslem fanatics 
are engaged in the five-pronged offensive launched on Tuesday in 
the directions of Cajnice, Rudo and Visegrad, the Bosnian Serb 
towns on the border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and 
of Grebak and Trnovo, stops on route to Mt. Igman overlooking 
Sarajevo. 
  The offensive's objective is for the Bosnian Moslems to link 
up with the Moslems in the Raska (Sandzak) region in the [word 
indistinct] and have the war spread to Yugoslavia, i.e. its 
republics of Serbia and Montenegro, and to link up the Gorazde 
troops with those on Mt. Igman and in Zepa and Srebrenica, also 
"Safe Areas" in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to 
information available to the Bosnian Serb army. 
  Bosnian Serb military sources set out that, since Bosnian 
Serb troops are deployed around Gorazde, the town could have 
been supplied with arms and ammunition only by NATO aircraft as 
part of the U.S. operation of air dropping relief aid to 
Bosnian Moslems. 
  The city of Sarajevo and the Moslem enclaves of Srebrenica, 
Zepa, Gorazde, Tuzla, and Bihac were proclaimed U.N.-protected 
"Safe Areas" under U.N. Security Council Resolution 824 in May 
1993. 
  The resolution called for the U.N. peacekeepers to 
demilitarize the "Safe Areas." However, not only have the U.N. 
troops failed to act accordingly but they have even failed to 
take any steps to prevent Moslems from using "Safe Areas" for 
military purposes. 
  U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, himself, said in 
a report to the Security Council in mid-March that Moslems were 
using "Safe Areas" to train, equip and give a rest to their 
troops, and to open fire at Serb positions in the hope of 
provoking Serb retaliation. 
  The U.N. secretary-general urged that the concept of the 
U.N. protected "Safe Areas," in which he said crime and 
prostitution were rampant, be redefined so that "Safe Areas" 
could not be used by Moslems to gain "tactical military 
advantage." 
  However, the U.N. Security Council has failed to take a 
stand on the Butrus-Ghali request, just as it has failed to act 
in the case of similar reports and warnings from the Bosnian 
Serbs. 
  The Bosnian Serb leadership has many times drawn attention 
to 
the fact that Moslem military provocations, in particular from 
Srebrenica and Gorazde, are aimed at forcing Serbs to launch 
military operations against U.N.-protected "Safe Areas" and, 
thereby, securing a foreign military intervention. 
  The warnings from the Bosnian Serbs did not reach the 
Western 
public because Western media have been waging a pro-Moslem i.e. 
anti-Serb propaganda campaign since the outbreak of the war two 
years ago. 
  Therefore, it would not be surprising at all if the latest 
Moslem offensive, launched from the U.N.-protected "Safe Area" 
of Gorazde, was to be disregarded and the Serbs were instead to 
be accused of attacking the town.

  [Text] Zagreb, March 31 (AFP) -- The UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] in Bosnia-Herzegovina has detected no signs of a 
forthcoming "spring offensive" either by separatist Serbs or the 
Bosnian army, despite continuing Serb bombardments on enclaves 
in the east of the republic, an official said Thursday [31 
March]. 
  Responding to repeated Serb charges that the Bosnian army 
was 
preparing a spring offensive, UNPROFOR deputy commander General 
John MacInnis said he had "no indications" of such a campaign. 
  "There are various military activities going on, but we 
don't 
see it yet as a concerted large scale effort," the Canadian 
general said. 
  In Sarajevo earlier UN officials warned of a "difficult 
situation" in the Moslem-held enclave of Gorazde in eastern 
Bosnia, where Sarajevo radio said separatist Serbs were 
continuing a fierce bombardment begun earlier this week. 
  The offensive against the enclave, launched earlier this 
week, was "the most violent ever launched against the town," the 
radio said. 
  A spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Kris 
Janowski, said airdrops of humanitarian aid would become 
necessary if the fighting continued over the next two days. 
  UN Protection Force spokesman Major Rob Annink said the 
situation at Gorazde was "tense" following an all-day 
bombardment of the town. Zepa, further north, had also come 
under Serb bombardment on Wednesday, with three people seriously 
wounded, he added. 
  Janowski said that five people, including an 11-year-old 
girl, had died, with 21 other people wounded, in Wednesday's 
bombardment of Gorazde. Sarajevo radio put the figure at 15 
dead and 40 wounded. 
  Annick said the situation was "tense" around the northern 
pocket of Maglaj, where Sarajevo Radio said the Bosnian army 
seized several strategic villages and hillsides Wednesday. The 
radio also claimed military successes by the Bosnian army on the 
Brcko front, in the north, saying it had forced back Serb forces 
by 500 metres (yards). 
  On the Gorazde shelling, MacInnis acknowledged that there 
were "widespread shellings throughout Bosnia, but at a very low 
level, and they do not appear to be coordinated." 
  UNPROFOR was "not convinced as yet that there is a concerted 
spring offensive, nor a concerted widely coordinated reaction. 
But it is something of course that we have to be watching very 
carefully," he said. 
  In London the Foreign Office said Britain would open an 
embassy in Sarajevo next month to mark "the progressive return 
to normal life." London established diplomatic ties with 
Sarajevo in April 1992 soon after its independence was 
recognised, but did not open a mission there. A US embassy in 
Sarajevo was inaugurated Wednesday. 
  Also in London, the environmental protection group 
Greenpeace 
warned of the danger to civilian life in former Yugoslavia 
created by the more than two million land-mines that still 
littered the territory fought over by the various combatants. 
  "Landmines and unexploded munitions set by all factions will 
endanger civilians and children returning to their destroyed 
homes for years to come," the organisation said in a statement. 
  Greenpeace, which recently sent a delegation to the former 
Yugoslavia, deplored the lack of resources allocated to mine 
clearance.

  [Excerpts] We dedicate the following minutes of the 
broadcast to yesterday's [30 March] session of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Constituent Assembly. Ivo Komsic, president, 
and Luka Markesic, Petar (?Josolic), and Ivan Lovrenovic, all 
members of the Croatian National Council, today held a press 
conference at which they stated their position regarding the 
role of this body in implementing the provisions of the 
Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia- Herzegovina adopted 
yesterday. Mladen Bosnjak has the details. 
  [Begin recording] [Bosnjak] Ivo Komsic, president of the 
Croatian National Council, assessed the session of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly -- which ended yesterday -- as being 
a historic turning point for many reasons, and not only for our 
state, but also for the Republic of Croatia. He assessed that 
the newly adopted Constitution was proof of Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
strength. The historic quality of the Constitution is evident 
in the fact that its contents evolved from the utmost suffering 
of our state and its citizens. Establishing the place and role 
of the Croatian National Council, Ivo Komsic said that the 
Congress of Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats had defined a project 
around which it was possible to achieve complete accord, and 
added: 
  [Komsic] Now that we have a Constitution, it is the Croatian 
National Council's duty to invest all its strength and potential 
into implementing this Constitution, to do [words indistinct], 
and to fulfill its duty to the utmost, a duty for which this 
body was formed in the first place. We shall, of course, 
support this and do everything that will be required of us in 
the course of implementing this Constitution -- both in the 
political sense and on the ground, where very concrete tasks 
will have to carried out .... 
  [Bosnjak] For Luka Markesic, Franciscan friar and believer, 
the most important thing now was to restore the love and the 
strength of spirit in the people, victims of war, so that they 
can in peace bear and overcome their hatred and thoughts of 
revenge. Petar (?Josolic) stressed that one of the roles of the 
Croatian National Council would be [words indistinct] when the 
Croats from Vares and the Muslims from Capljina return to their 
homes -- they and all the others. [passage omitted] 
  [Bosnjak] After the introductory greetings -- of which you 
have heard the most significant details -- correspondents' asked 
two questions. Ivo Komsic answered both. First, about the 
candidates for the highest offices in the Federation. 
  [Komsic] Between now and the next Assembly session, we shall 
be coordinating our positions regarding [changes thought] and we 
shall try to reach a consensus on this in the Croatian deputy 
caucus -- which is now being formed from the rest of the 
caucuses that are already in the parliament -- just as we 
reached a consensus in political negotiations regarding this 
project. 
  [Bosnjak] The other question pertained to the Croatian 
National Council's position toward the possibility of a 
confederation of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Serbia, after the 
possible participation of the Bosnian Serbs in the Federation of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. Ivan Lovrenovic stressed that there were 
no definite answers to this. Mr. Komsic stressed that the 
Croatian National Council cannot support the possibility of any 
kind of confederal arrangement between the Federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia. 
  [Komsic] [Words indistinct] of confederal relations with 
Croatia, why then should we not have a confederal relationship 
with Serbia? The reason for not doing so is very simple; Serbia 
has carried out aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina with the help 
of the Serbian Democratic Party, which formed a para-state here. 
There can be no political or moral justification for such an 
act, and the world cannot support it. The aggressor must be 
punished in some way. [end recording]

  [Text] The signing of the agreement and the promulgation of 
the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina are 
already yielding good results in the Zepce Commune. After the 
cooperation in the field between the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] was established and 
(?two-day) mutual visits of civilian population made possible, 
the HVO concentration camp in Zepce was closed yesterday. Under 
the auspices of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Sector 
Command in the region, the HVO Command released all the 
remaining prisoners, members of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
who then freely decided to travel to free territories or to 
remain in Zepce with their families.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Zorana Suvakovic: "Fable and Bosnia"] </F>
  [Text] General [Bertrand] de Lapresle was quite bewildered 
and surprised when questions started showering upon him in the 
International Press Center in Belgrade about the Turkish return 
to the Balkans. 
  It is a credit to the French general that, in less than a 
week since he took up the command over UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces], he came to visit Belgrade, minding the praiseworthy 
international procedures. As he nicely put it, he is a general 
assigned to deal with partners, rather than with enemies, a 
general who does not aspire to accomplish a personal victory, 
but rather to give support to his partners so they can find a 
peace settlement. Hardly any of the former UNPROFOR commanders 
has ever given such a precise definition of the essence and role 
of UN peace missions. 
<H5>  Fatal Mistake </H5>
  No sooner did UNPROFOR start to recover, under the political 
leadership of the wise Akashi, who has a refined sense for most 
diverse currents, winds, changes of moon, high-tides, and 
low-tides in the Balkans, when the decision came from New York 
that Turkish blue helmets are to be sent to Bosnia. That is 
certainly not the first time that the international organization 
and community has complicated the already complicated-enough 
Balkan situation, and make the goal of its own mission even more 
difficult to achieve. That many of the 54 UN Security Council 
resolutions are absolutely unfeasible on the ground was 
stressed, more or less openly, by all the former military and 
political officials of the UN mission in Bosnia, because of 
which many of them consciously put an end to their careers. The 
mistakes made by the international community were subsequently 
assessed by many former foreign ministers, UN officials, and 
co-chairmen of the conferences on former Yugoslavia. The 
deployment of Turkish troops in the Balkans is one of those 
moves that confirm the theory about the intentions of making the 
conflict even more complicated at the moment when certain signs 
of its forthcoming conclusion have appeared. 
  There are many reasons for believing that the deployment of 
Turkish UN troops in Bosnia is a great mistake. 
  Five centuries of Turkish government left many traces all 
over the Balkans, and many people believe they are an indirect 
cause of the ongoing conflict. It seems that since the 
disintegration in former Yugoslavia began, the Balkan countries 
encumbered with a Turkish heritage have never been so unanimous 
as they are now, that the arrival of Turkish troops might cause 
the blaze of the conflict to spread to the entire region. The 
reactions of Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, and the FRY [Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia] have been almost identically severe, 
calling this decision a complete nonsense, a fatal mistake, and 
even the surrender of the United Nations to Turkish strategy. 
  How undoable is the knot intertwining history and the 
present 
could best be seen in Athens, where the news from New York came 
in on a Greek national holiday. The celebration of the historic 
date of the Greek uprising against the Turkish dictatorship, and 
the decision that was made in New York on the Turkish 
reappearance in the Balkans, are a clear illustration of the two 
opposite ways of reasoning, two ways of thinking. 
  It is not clear why the United Nations has given up the 
principle that it itself established as a basic guideline for 
its peace missions throughout the world. Notwithstanding the 
explanation that the Turkish troops will be wearing blue berets, 
by which the latest decision is being justified, the decision 
still violates the UN rule prescribing that the troops of 
neighboring countries, or countries that are historically 
discredited in a conflicting region are not to be sent for peace 
missions. 
<H5>  It Will Be Difficult to Close the Door </H5>
  The participation of Russian troops in the UN peace mission 
is hardly comparable with the participation of Turkish troops. 
Russia, since recently called by the international news 
agencies "the traditional orthodox ally of Serbia and Greece," 
is neither a neighboring country, nor discredited in the Balkans 
as an occupying force. For that reason the Russian battalion 
has been participating in UNPROFOR from the very beginning, 
while their presence in the UN Protected Areas [UNPA's] has 
never elicited any protests or criticisms on the part of the 
international public. 
  Once the door is opened, it will be difficult to close it 
for 
other questionable guests: Italians, Austrians, Germans, 
Hungarians... and to keep them away from the yard where the 
historic curse allows too little tolerance, even for its 
inhabitants. 
  It is now difficult to guess why and how Akashi and Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali have given up the prescribed rules. The 
insufficient number of peacekeeping troops for the hazardous 
operation in Bosnia is stated as one of the most decisive 
reasons. Why was then the good idea of deploying the Turkish 
troops in some other, more distant sites of UN operations, 
thereby leaving space for the deployment of some more neutral 
troops, abandoned so easily? What is the reason for stepping 
back on the path that leads to a dead end precisely at the 
moment when, for the first time, the international factors have 
discerned some light at the end of the tunnel? 
  Encouraged by the favorable winds blowing from the East 
River, the Turkish Government has offered three times as much 
troops. Most probably, the number of troops will amount to 
2,700, in contrast to the initially endorsed 1,000 troops. 
Ankara will spare neither men, nor means to reappear in the 
Balkans in as impressive numbers as possible. 
  Does not the fact that all other nations are quite reluctant 
to commit their troops to the Bosnian adventure, while Turkey is 
so eager to take the risk, provoke suspicion and doubts? It 
does, and even the most extreme suspicions, such as that 
expressed by a Greek minister, who compared the deployment of 
Turkish peace keeping troops with a wolf used for guarding 
sheep. All in vain, since nobody is paying attention to the 
morals of so many Bosnian fables, stories, poems, proverbs, and 
above all riddles dating back from Turkish times.

<F P=106> [Article by Renato Cemerika and Vito Bulica: "The Muslims </F>
Have Secretly Built a Navy"] 
  [Text] When the war began in Bosnia and Herzegovina two 
years ago, the Muslim army was practically nonexistent. There 
were units of the MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs], a bit of 
territorial defense [TO], and armed groups of Muslim youths 
with differing views of the political and military objectives 
of the fight, and most of the talk was about the Patriotic 
League. That is why the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] played 
the decisive role in defending a large portion of the territory 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina at that time. The Muslim units became 
stronger, underwent transformation, and ultimately the Army of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed by unifying all the available 
potential. Today that army even has trained military cadres, 
mainly former officers of the former JNA [Yugoslav People's 
Army], some of whom took part in the war in 1991 against the 
Republic of Croatia, but left the JNA after the war began in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
  No one has as yet given a complete answer to the question of 
how and where the Muslim leadership has been getting arms and 
equipment for its army. Official sources speak about "materiel" 
found in the MUP, booty captured from the enemy is mentioned as 
an additional source along with its own production in plants of 
the "special-purpose industry," which are located on territory 
under control of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and 
occasional purchases are mentioned incidentally. Although no 
one wants to say anything about the ways in which those 
occasional purchases are advanced into Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
it is evident that military equipment is being acquired on the 
world black market and delivered to Bosnia and Herzegovina in 
spite of the embargo on the importing of arms. Eyewitnesses, 
including, for example, a journalist of the German television 
station ZDF, say that they have seen in Sarajevo ammunition 
made in Iran; at one time there was quite a bit of noise over 
the origin of a missile which destroyed an armored vehicle of 
the HVO in Gornji Vakuf; and even the fact that arms and 
ammunition are being produced in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
indicates that there are certain supply channels, because the 
territory under control of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
does not have everything necessary for independent production. 
<H5>  The Fight for Influence </H5>
  Although arms and equipment of Western origin in the 
possession of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be 
logically explained only by delivery in humanitarian convoys 
and aircraft for delivery of aid to the surrounded Muslim 
enclaves, it is not possible to provide a solid confirmation 
even of that explanation. However, throughout the entire story 
of delivery of arms to Bosnia and Herzegovina this is not the 
only unknown, nor probably is it even the most interesting one: 
It is not more interesting than the one about who "is covering" 
the costs of the purchase and shipment. One can get a 
suggestion of the answer from the fact that the Islamic 
countries, even in an assessment of Alija Izetbegovic, are not 
setting aside sufficient funds to care for casualties in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina. That is, it is hard to believe that the 
oil-rich Islamic countries, especially those in which Islamic 
(fundamentalist) regimes are in power, are forgetting Muslims 
in any part of the globe, especially if they are in a situation 
which could deteriorate into their complete destruction, but at 
the same time could also result in the creation of another 
country with an Islamic regime. 
  Reliable reports indicate that one should go beyond logical 
judgment. According to those reports, the Islamic countries, 
above all Iran and Saudi Arabia, are investing large sums to 
equip the Muslim army in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The visit of 
every political, military, and humanitarian official from the 
Islamic countries presupposes an abundant cash donation, and 
all that money is flowing into accounts which are mostly under 
the control of Haris Silajdzic, prime minister, and Bakir 
Alispahic, minister of internal affairs. There is indeed even a 
certain rivalry taking place between Saudi Arabia and Iran, 
because each of these two states wants to achieve maximum 
influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and today this is possible 
exclusively by offering all possible support to the Muslim army. 
<H5>  Boats for Fast Missions </H5>
  The most recent form of rivalry evident between the two 
countries when it comes to expanding influence on the Muslims 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina are the orders of ships for the 
future Muslim navy and the training of Muslim naval officers. 
That branch of the surrounded force, in the opinion of the 
command of the Muslim army, is essential to the survival of the 
Muslim people. "Unless we have a sea and a navy, Yugoslavia and 
Croatia will smother us, because those two states have a navy 
which should be taken into account," says one of the high 
Muslim officers. Iran has ordered 17 vessels for a future 
Muslim navy in Scandinavian shipyards. Six rubber boats, each 
of which carries 25 men fully armed, have been ordered; they 
are part of the combat equipment intended for the coast guard. 
These personnel are not part of the boat's crew, but that is 
the number of marines the vessel carries to the intervention 
point. There are also orders for six assault landing boats that 
will be built of light metal. These boats are today being built 
either of light metal or plastic reinforced with fiberglass, 
and they are designed for anticommando activities and rapid 
missions on the open sea. The future Muslim navy is also to get 
four coastal rescue boats used in navies to provide assistance 
in towing larger vessels, in transport, and in aiding landing 
vessels in their withdrawal after performance of their mission. 
The 17th vessel is a salvage vessel, a vessel intended above 
all for carrying arms and ammunition, but it is also equipped 
to rescue damaged vessels and to raise vessels which have sunk. 
<H5>  Where To Find Sailors </H5>
  Since naval officers in the former Yugoslav navy were 
largely 
from the Croatian coast, in spite of the carefully conducted 
personnel policy, the numerous defections of trained personnel 
from the JNA to the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina have not 
provided the Muslim army with a particularly large number of 
men trained for active service in the navy. So that the vessels 
ordered, some of which have already done their shakedown 
cruise, would not be without crews, the Islamic Republic of 
Iran has decided to accept about 200 Muslims for training as 
future naval officers. That entire program was annoying to 
Saudi Arabia, and so that country, in an effort to reduce or 
completely eliminate Iranian (Shiite) influence on the Bosnian 
Muslims, ordered four vessels which informed sources say are 
the most up-to-date in the world. 
  The number of future naval officers and also the number of 
naval vessels ordered are only the beginning of activities to 
organize a Muslim navy, although we can still not say in what 
port it would tie up. At a time when he was still powerful, 
Sefer Halilovic publicly announced his intention to enter Ploce 
with Muslim units and plant his flag there. Muslim politicians 
one after the other, in much more refined style, of course, 
began long ago to talk about the necessity of access to the sea 
for the Muslim national territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
Croatian and Muslim negotiators have spent many hours on this 
problem in negotiations for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
but a Muslim navy probably never even occurred to an objective 
observer. In certain Muslim circles who consider the present 
state of affairs to be a national rebirth for the Bosnian 
Muslims and who believe that this is the right moment for a 
permanent solution of the problem of a state for the Bosnian 
Muslims, there is constant mention of the idea of a Muslim sea 
from the Neretva to Bar, which means that there would be an 
abundance of suitable locations for a naval port. 
<H5>  A Navy Without a Port </H5>
  Semso Tankovic said on a recent television program: "The 
Bosnian Muslims will have a navy, that is quite certain." Even 
he did not say in what port it would tie up. The existence of 
"naval" plans is not denied even by Alija Izetbegovic, but he, 
taking advantage of the results of the most recent Croat-Muslim 
negotiations, talks about a joint federal navy. Because an 
agreement about the armed forces of the future federation and 
confederation still has not been spelled out precisely, one can 
only guess about the federal navy. The question, that is, is 
whether there will be such a navy at all. Corps General Anton 
Tus said in a recent interview: "From the operational 
standpoint, preparation of the armed forces and the conduct of 
defensive warfare will require coordination of certain wartime 
units of the two states and a joint command in the use of those 
forces. I am referring to ground forces, air force and air 
defense, while defense on the sea is in the jurisdiction of 
Croatia." 
  The beginning of the Muslim navy was ordered when there was 
not even any mention of a U.S. peace initiative, so it is 
possible that even the top Muslim political leadership itself 
does not know what it will do with it if the negotiations about 
federation and confederation are taken all the way to a 
successful conclusion. But the question of the port where they 
plan to tie up their navy still remains open. If it is Neum or 
even Ploce, then there is no point in building the navy, not 
because ecological balance would be destroyed by building a 
port at Neum, but because that port would not have an outlet to 
the open sea. A Muslim navy stationed in it would be imprisoned 
in an area of less than 100 square kilometers.

<F P=106> [Article by Milan Jelovac: "Martic's Last Card"] </F>
  [Text] Are the rebellious Serbs in Croatia now using their 
most recent tactics? Do the more frequent breaches on the lines 
of contact come from uncontrolled groups, or are new hotbeds of 
conflict being generated systematically? Is the focus of the 
crisis being shifted as a part of that Serbian plan, so that one 
day there is a crisis in the eastern, the next in the western, 
and the day after that in the southern sector of the UNPA [UN 
Protected Area]? 
  Does that mean that the recent more frequent military 
breaches and fierce skirmishes in Lika, for example, were 
incited by those in Knin who are carrying out the policy of the 
Belgrade strategists on behalf of priority political 
considerations and to give a signal to the international 
community, to the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], and to the 
United States, which has finally become more actively involved 
in resolving the drama of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in 
Croatia? 
  There is no doubt that the answers are affirmative to this 
entire string of questions. Knin, which has been very much 
shaken politically, is today stopping at nothing in its attempts 
to prove that world guarantees concerning reintegration of the 
UNPA into the constitutional system of Croatia "are not 
realistic," which is evidenced, according to them, by the 
frequent firefights with the Croatian Army [HV] in the border 
areas of the UNPA. The resoluteness of Milan Martic, newly 
elected president of the self-proclaimed "krajina," in proving 
that "life is no longer possible with the Croats in a joint 
state," is confirmed by the constant production of breaches. 
Many analysts do not even preclude the possibility that in a 
subsequent development of the situation unfavorable for Martic 
the krajina Serbs will encourage a general conflict with the 
Croatian Army, which the international community would have to 
stop because of the firepower on both sides, the devastation and 
numerous casualties, and according to the formula of the Vance 
Plan, the status quo would be cemented in place, which would 
postpone integration of the UNPA. Such a possibility would be 
the last step for the Serbian side in maintaining the status 
quo, and thereby its authority in the UNPA. 
<H5>  War Hysteria </H5>
  Why are the rural Serbs in Croatia deciding on such radical 
changes at a time when the Serbian policy of normalization of 
relations with Croatia has been officially proclaimed? For 
several reasons. First of all, because of the U.S. initiative 
and normalization of relations between Croats and Muslims and 
because of the future federation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and 
the confederation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. That 
is, it is well-known that if Croatia accepts confederation with 
the federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it also gets firm 
guarantees of recovery of its occupied areas. This is certainly 
not at all to the liking of the krajina Serbs, who are already 
announcing that the "krajina" will be annexed to the Srpska 
republic in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and thereafter also to 
parent Serbia, if the Croats and Muslims agree on confederation. 
  As a matter of fact, the merger of the rebellious Croatian 
Serbs with their Bosnian fellow countrymen is for them only a 
matter of protocol in view of the high level of linkage there 
has been up to now with the Bosnian Serbs and the FRY [Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia]. As a matter of fact, for a long time 
now the self-proclaimed "krajina" has been in a military, 
monetary, news, intelligence, and administrative alliance with 
the Srpska republic in Bosnia and Herzegovina and with Serbia. 
To illustrate, let us mention only the appearance of the newly 
printed identity card that is in effect at the moment in Knin. 
Beneath the title which reads "Federal Republic of Yugoslavia" 
it says "Serbian republic Krajina," and after that "Knin 
Ministry of Internal Affairs." 
  That inclusion of the self-proclaimed Serbian state in 
Croatia to that of the Bosnian Serbs is actually the last card 
which Martic and company can play. With the possible military 
support of the Bosnian Serbs, their position would be 
considerably strengthened, and that would certainly cancel a 
possible Croatian (Muslim) military solution and contribute to 
an extension of the status quo. Keeping the people in a state of 
war hysteria, that tried-and-true tactic of the Knin leaders, is 
counterproductive in the long run, and its first adverse 
consequences are already obvious--large-scale abandonment of the 
area of the "krajina" and departure for Serbia. Martic is, of 
course, aware of that, but so is Belgrade, and so the option of 
"linking up all the Serbian lands" is new spiritual food for the 
impoverished Serbian population. 
<H5>  An End to All the Games </H5>
  There have been many breaches in the less than two months of 
Martic's "presidency," and they have been exceedingly 
unfavorable for him. The crisis over the Sava bridge between 
Stara Gradiska and Bosanska Gradiska, first the Serbian taking 
of the bridge, the possibility of a conflict with the UNPROFOR, 
and then the withdrawal, which the media moderated by speaking 
of "joint control," or again the NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian 
Serbs, sent a clear message to Martic that there are to be no 
more games with the international forces. 
  The downing of the Udbina Hawks belonging to the "1st 
Squadron of the Air Force of the Army of the Serbian republic 
Krajina" in the sky over Novi Travnik and Bosanski Petrovac was 
a new slap in the face to the "sheriff of Knin," who has been 
unsuccessfully concealing the redness of his cheek from his own 
media public. From the public which so far has never been 
officially informed that the downed planes were those which in 
the past months have been rending the sky with low-altitude 
passes over Knin, presumably demonstrating both to the people of 
Knin and also to the UNPROFOR, the strength and spirit of the 
"krajina army." An army from whose command its chief until 
yesterday, General Mile Novakovic, has literally been removed. 
And Major General Milan Celeketic, born in Vojvodina, has been 
appointed to take his place; whether with the blessing or by the 
order of Belgrade it makes no difference at all! Alongside the 
dismissals from the top military leadership, Martic has also 
been punishing every form of liberalism concerning relations 
with the legal Croatian authorities. That is best confirmed by 
the case of Dzakula and Ecimovic. 
  Martic is bringing up new units to the lines of demarcation 
with the Croatian Army to replace the old ones. Units from the 
eastern sector are coming to the southern sector, the command 
personnel are being replaced with those from Bosnia or even 
Serbia. The military negotiators are not being given any broad 
authority, and Martic is applying Milosevic's tried-and-true 
tactics of increasing the size of police forces on which one can 
count, because he is aware that slightly less than half of the 
electorate voted against him. That is why the war hysteria is 
being maintained with new breaches, and he has been successfully 
gagging his opponents. 
<H5>  The Media Offensive </H5>
  New (old) crisis points are dots being added every little 
while on the map of Croatia. The hospital in Vinkovci is being 
hit from Ceric, just recently renamed Srbac, a place not far 
from Vinkovci. The extensive area of Perusic, Gospic, Licki 
Osik, and Otocac is being shelled from the area of Lika under 
Serbian control. Although we do not have official confirmation 
of possible skirmishes in the Lika part of the theater (the HV, 
the UNPROFOR, for example), the krajina media offensive, which 
has been talking about violent skirmishes between the HV and 
Serbian forces "west of Korenica," is indicative. Referring to 
Kozjan as a battlefield where fierce skirmishes took place over 
several days, the Serbian side obviously wants 
internationalization of this report, which for the present has 
not been verified. 
  Knin "state television" has even published a report, which 
could not be verified, that Croatian forces held Novi Licki Osik 
(renamed Teslingrad) for three days, and then withdrew. 
Regardless of the authenticity of these reports, their purpose 
is to create an international public opinion that would oppose 
reintegration of the UNPA into the constitutional system of 
Croatia, and would portray Croatia as the attacker. 
  If we add to that the (Serbian) firing of light antiaircraft 
SAM missiles on the Spanish transport plane in the general area 
of Plaski (a city under Serbian control) and its forced landing 
at the airfield on Krk, and the Serbian accusation of the 
Croatian side for the attack on the aircraft, the contribution 
to the new Knin strategy for intensifying the crisis is quite 
convincing. 
<H5>  A New Cooling of Relations </H5>
  How will the new "krajina tactics" of a programmed 
escalation 
of the conflict affect Croato-Serbian relations? Certainly 
adversely, because the signing of the long-awaited complete 
truce seems further away than it did a month ago. As is already 
well-known, a cease-fire is a first step toward establishment of 
a political dialogue between Zagreb and Knin. But recent events 
have not only put symbolic distance between Zagreb and Knin, 
they have also postponed the entire process of normalization 
between Zagreb and Belgrade. The obvious halt in the process of 
warming relations between Croatia and the FRY is also indicated 
by the unfulfilled promises made during last month's visit by 
Zeljko Simic to Zagreb. It was agreed that offices in Belgrade 
and Zagreb would be opened by the end of February. So far, 
nothing has come of the announced reestablishment of telephone 
lines, and few people believe any longer in the opening of the 
limited-access highway, announced so optimistically for 15 
March, when Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister, is 
supposed to visit Belgrade. 
  Thus, new barricades in Croato-Serbian relations have again 
been set up in Knin. And that, in the opinion of many, is the 
reaction of the Belgrade headquarters and its Knin branch office 
to the Washington ink with which the agreement between Croats 
and Muslims was signed. We soon will see what are the next moves 
envisaged by Slobodan Milosevic. Nevertheless, one thing is 
predictable. He certainly will not sacrifice his pawn, Martic, 
in the foreseeable future.

<F P=106> [Address by President Franjo Tudjman to the 100th session of </F>
the Croatian Government in Zagreb -- live] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: Allow me to add to what I 
said in my introductory address and to what the prime minister 
has just said. When I paid tribute to the government and its 
head, Nikica Valentic, I had in mind its overall successes 
during -- as Nikica said -- the ongoing war situation. It is 
not just a war situation but also an exceptional period. We 
must bear in mind that all countries in the former socialist 
bloc are going through a deep crisis even without the war that 
we have had to endure. The collapse of the socialist system and 
artificial multinational states have caused a turmoil both of 
political, administrative, and economic nature. We must look at 
ourselves with pride when we say that not a single one of the 
countries that has not had to endure war has succeeded in the 
transitional period of setting up a free and democratic system, 
a free market, or in achieving better results than Croatia 
despite all our difficulties brought about by the war in Croatia 
and in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Only the Czech Republic is slightly 
ahead of us. All others are far, far behind Croatia in all 
aspects, in the political and economic sphere. 
  In other words, these results have been achieved due to 
Croatia's policy as a whole and to its government and, as Prime 
Minister Valentic has just said, they provide us with the basis 
to remain consistent in pursuing our policy. Like me, you have 
probably heard more than one foreign diplomat or economic expert 
say that we have succeeded because we knew exactly what we 
wanted, because we had the leadership, because we had support 
for our policies in both the parliament and among the people. 
This experience speaks for itself. 
  Of course, the government and all of us were faced with 
enormous tasks in setting up new state administration, in 
getting rid of the old, communist, self-management system both 
from institutions and people's minds. This was not easy and the 
task is still there if we are to create an effective and 
efficient state administration. However, even under normal 
conditions, it would take years to complete such tasks. What 
this means is that despite our situation even in this sphere we 
have succeeded in achieving a great deal. 
  I must remind you that we had to set up an army, to arm this 
army despite the adverse international situation. We had to arm 
200,000 men. You know what it means for such a small country as 
Croatia. 
  We had to create a new diplomatic service. We are still 
faced with the same task and this is a big problem in view of 
the lack of experience of personnel. In other words, we had to 
reorganize our state administration to get rid of the communes 
that we inherited, etc. So, what we have so far achieved in 
reorganizing and introducing the new system of administrative 
divisions, i.e. municipalities, counties -- this is yet to be 
completed -- nevertheless our state administration is 
functioning; well, the prime minister cited as the most 
exemplary case the fact that our taxes, the amount collected in 
taxes, had doubled up compared to what it was a year ago. 
Despite all problems and difficulties our state administration 
is becoming increasingly effective and efficient. 
  Another task facing us is to set up the rule of law in all 
its aspects. However, the type of the rule of law we wanted was 
not possible with the country at war, with one third of the 
Croatian territory under occupation -- later only one quarter 
remained under occupation after we liberated parts of the 
territory -- with 300,000 refugees who brought to Croatia their 
pain and suffering and hatred of those who caused their pain and 
suffering, with the bombing of our towns, and for as long as 
Croatian people were killed and expelled even from the Croatian 
territories under UN protection, i.e. from the territories under 
Serb occupation. In such a situation, while there were still 
remnants of the Yugo-communist army on our territory -- even 
today, the other day at a location the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs discovered dozens of kilograms of explosive that was to 
be used to destroy both the Croatian authorities and Croatian 
buildings, etc. -- well, it is clear that under such 
circumstances, when the new Croatian state, new Croatian 
democratic authorities, and the Croatian people were faced with 
the need to fight for survival, that despite all our efforts to 
introduce the rule of law we could not achieve the results we 
could have done. But, even in this sphere we have, in fact, 
achieved considerable results. 
  One should have a look at what the situation is like in this 
respect in all these countries -- in all other wars. I was the 
first to advocate the granting of civil and human rights to the 
Serbs in Croatia. I am still for it, and it is our duty. But 
some people keep forgetting that the Serb population was 
deceived and dragged into the war against the new Croatian 
authorities. Despite that we managed to maintain our attitude 
toward the Serbs in Croatia -- we still had Serbs in the 
government, in the parliament, we had them in the supreme 
judicial bodies. 
  Should we recall that when America was at war with Japan all 
members of the Japanese people were put into camps and their 
property confiscated. These are simply certain patterns in war 
show-downs. What was England's behavior like in the Falklands 
and so on and so on. If we are not completely satisfied with 
the results that we achieved in the area of the law-governed 
state and democracy, and we are not completely satisfied, we can 
say likewise that in many respects we have done things beyond 
our expectations. We managed to streamline our state system into 
the direction of strengthening democracy, strengthening the 
law-governed state, and there is no reason not to face the truth 
and continue on this basis. 
  As regards other results, I think that it is clear that 
this government has achieved great results in the ownership 
transformation in a way that secured, even under war conditions, 
the continuation of economic trends and avoidance of poverty and 
privation. For objective reasons a drop in production was 
recorded, but it was not the same as in other former socialist 
countries where production and the living standard dropped far 
more than in Croatia. 
  Even though we have to speed up the problem of economic 
recovery, we can nevertheless be pleased particularly with what 
the government in cooperation with the National Bank has managed 
to do as regards the program of stabilization and in curbing 
inflation. This is a Croatian miracle -- there are miracles in 
the political sphere and this is a miracle in the economic 
sphere -- and the people abroad, including the most eminent 
experts, are surprised and admit... [pauses] and which also 
contributed to the fact that, alongside with the overall policy 
that we have pursued, because we coordinated our national state 
interests with the main European and world players, such a 
policy is a success for the government in the economic sphere, 
in the stabilization. This represents a recognition of this 
government led by Nikica Valentic and of the National Bank led 
by Pero Jurkovic. This trend should continue and we ought to 
have a new Croatian hard currency before our deadline, for which 
absolutely favorable conditions are being created in the changed 
international circumstances. 
  Please permit me to say this: It is not a mere phrase but is 
a historic truth that the international circumstances were not 
favorable for the creation of an independent and sovereign 
Croatian state. They wanted to preserve the former Yugoslavia 
for many reasons, or return us, and so on. 
  By the policy that we pursued, by our democratic order 
within 
the country, by our successes -- about which I spoke earlier -- 
and by our foreign policy we brought Croatia to such an 
international position that we now really have favorable 
conditions in every respect. Today we have the main world 
power, the United States, as our ally, as our partner. It is 
ready for cooperation in all areas. It is ready to lend us 
support for the resolution of our main problem -- peaceful 
reintegration of Croatian areas under UN protection, i.e. under 
Serb occupation -- into the constitutional and legal system of 
the Republic of Croatia. 
  We have a friendship agreement with China, the country with 
the largest world population. We have good and friendly 
relations with the majority of European countries including the 
main ones. Pursuing our policy we established good relations 
with Islamic countries; we are on the road to establishing good 
relations with Israel. Therefore, Croatia's international 
position is such that it is almost impossible to imagine a 
better one. 
  But of course, we must not bring it into question with some 
stupidities of our own. But, if we were capable of creating 
Croatia, of bringing it up to here both in the internal and 
international spheres, then we have enough experience, 
intelligence, knowledge, and strength to continue following the 
same course. 
  It is now up to you, the government, to be ready to take 
advantage of these favorable circumstances. Before we were 
blocked in the international arena, even though we were 
diplomatically recognized. We were blocked because the world 
players still procrastinated and did not know what to do with 
the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia and 
so on. When they saw for themselves, they opened up their doors 
to us and now it is up to us to offer concrete programs to 
certain countries -- the USA, the EC and certain countries, to 
international financial institutions. In this respect I would 
ask the prime minister -- and I believe that because the 
government has been ready and able to come to grips with this 
task so far -- that we take advantage of this for our further 
economic recovery, for Croatia to become a country of prosperity 
in every respect. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that the creation of the 
Croat-Bosnian federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
confederation of the federal Bosnia-Herzegovina with Croatia 
represents a new development for us, new obligations, new 
possibilities, but also challenges to which we have to be ready 
to respond. 
  The policy that we pursued brought about the federation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which means that the Croat nation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is really becoming an equal constituent 
nation in every respect, regardless of the fact that it is 
smaller in number. 
  As you saw at the constituent assembly, the Croatian banner 
was hoisted next to the Bosnian Muslim one. Therefore, this is 
only a formal way of looking at it. 
  Our people there must learn to take part in administering 
the 
entire Bosnia-Herzegovina, even more so as it is in the interest 
of the world that the federal Bosnia-Herzegovina, through 
Croatia, be linked to Western democracy. Our government, for 
its part, has to be ready to take an effective part in the 
confederal relations so that effective economic, cultural, and 
other links with Croatia can be established. It is in the 
interest of the Croat people there, in the interest of the 
Bosnian people there, and in the strategic interest of the 
Croatian state. 
  This imposes obligations and challenges, but also creates 
favorable circumstances because such a federal 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be granted credits and be favorably 
treated by a large number of Islamic countries that will be 
ready to offer aid both for the reconstruction and the future 
economic life of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is something that 
should be well thought about both by the complete government and 
by some of its departments. In a word, we must equip ourselves 
for such a task so that the federal relations there and our 
confederal relations are such as to be useful for the Croatian 
people, the Croatian state, and of course for the nations living 
in that federation there; to be in the interest of the political 
and economic stability; and be in our interest but also Europe 
and the Western world. 
  Gentlemen, all this indicates that we shall nevertheless 
manage to reintegrate these Croatian areas under UN protection, 
i.e. under Serb occupation, into our constitutional and legal 
order in a peaceful way. This is now a different situation. 
  The agreement that was signed does not provide for any 
demarcation of borders but only provides for the separation of 
armed formations in order to prevent conflicts -- conflicts that 
have inflicted human losses on us. There have been situations 
whereby it was difficult to contain the anger of our people in 
those border areas and the anger of the armed formations of the 
Croatian Army. Some people lost their nerve and were taken in by 
provocations and by their actions sometimes did damage to the 
Croatian state policy. At the beginning of this month I had to 
adopt a decision on the replacement of a colonel who 
unnecessarily carried out an offensive action that inflicted 
political damage on us and caused casualties on our side -- 12 
killed and 44 wounded. This is one example -- we have had 
several -- where one should have thought whether it was only 
carelessness, justified anger, or it was even a provocation, 
even an intentional sabotage by remnants of the secret service. 
Let us not deceive ourselves that we have managed to remove 
them from everywhere and from every position in the light of all 
that has happened. 
  Therefore, with this cease-fire agreement we have created 
conditions to begin the normalization for which those in 
Belgrade who are responsible for the occupation have voiced 
their support -- which the two great powers are also urging: the 
main world superpower, the United States; Russia, which has also 
been cooperating with the United States; and Europe, which has 
proved to be unsuccessful in the resolution of that crisis in 
Bosnia and in UN protected areas, is following them. This gives 
us reasons to count on that, but on our part, we have to be 
likewise effective in the implementation. We are seeking the 
restoration of trust, but one should bear on mind that the Serb 
extremists in those areas between Knin and Baranja were 
instigated by Belgrade expansionists who wanted a Greater Serbia 
and that those and suchlike managed to deceive a considerable 
number of Serb population in those areas that danger was looming 
from the democratic Croatia. 
  For our part, we must show that we are truly willing and 
that 
we want to ensure all civilian and ethnic rights to the Serbs. 
What we want to achieve is also in the interest of the Serbian 
people. We shall now take up....[pauses] The previous 
agreement on the normalization of relations, the opening of 
offices -- ours in Belgrade and the Belgrade one in Zagreb -- is 
based on the same principle. We shall work on the gradual 
opening of communications: roads, railways, oil pipelines, and 
long-distance power lines. In this way trust will gradually be 
established and efforts will be made to secure the return of our 
refugees. My particular request to the government is to begin 
the reconstruction of those villages that were liberated in the 
Maslenica operation, [names of villages indistinct]. I must 
admit I was surprised the other day when I saw that very little 
has been done in this respect. Wherever reconstruction is 
possible or wherever the return of refugees is possible, which 
must be our priority, we must start this process. 
  You can see for yourselves that refugees have rightly been 
dissatisfied with the way their return has been stalled. I 
think that for our part we must take steps to ensure that they 
start to return gradually. On the other side we must give 
support to their demands so that the world can see that their 
demands for return are justified. However, such a procedure, 
i.e. gradual normalization, should lead to the integration of 
these areas into Croatia, with the help of major international 
factors. For our part, we must be prepared to abide by the 
constitutional law regarding these two districts, Glina and 
Knin, where Serbs were a majority before the war, and we must 
ensure that they have elections for local self-rule. In 
general, we must tackle this problem in the political way in 
order to resolve it as quickly as possible without new victims. 
  As far as the government's other task is concerned, I would 
like them to take into account that we will be able to reduce 
considerable Army expenses now that war dangers are on the 
decrease. We must also work on cutting down on bureaucracy 
wherever possible, introduce austerity measures -- as discussed 
by Mr. Valentic -- in order to secure more funds for those areas 
that have been neglected, such as culture and sciences. 
  In this context of transformation and denationalization I 
would ask you to examine whether we could, and I think we can, 
begin with the transformation of former socialist collective 
farms and agricultural enterprises and donate part of this land 
to refugees, especially volunteers, for political and economic 
reasons. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, since time immemorial those who 
carried 
the burden of war, who gave most in wars to defend their 
homelands, have been rewarded in this way. We should consider 
whether it is possible to do it for a period of 10 years and 
with what kind of compensation and so on, but such a step would 
pay our debt to those people and perhaps create conditions for 
the speedier resolution of the problems we are facing at the 
moment. 
  Of course, the permanent task of debureaucratization 
remains, 
the permanent task of modernizing our state administration. To 
do that we will probably need more international expertise and, 
so to say, training or schooling of our people, because the 
layers of the past when the authorities were not in the service 
of the nation, of man, of people, but in the service of the 
ruling party, those layers are still here. We must fight them 
with resolution in order for the Croatian man to feel that he 
now has the Croatian authorities that serve him but which in 
return he has to treat as his authorities and his state. This 
is a mutual process that needs to be enriched in the right 
sense, in a legal sense, in the work of the state administration 
and also in the educational sense. 
  Let me give an example -- a banal example -- in education. 
I watched a French-German tennis match on TV. The stands were 
full, and there were a lot of Austrian [as heard] flags. One 
day I went to the Cibona sports hall. The hall was empty and 
there was not a single Croatian flag. There were a dozen 
Yugoslav (?flags), they won several championships and so on. I 
asked myself where the Zagreb of tennis was, where the national 
Zagreb was. That is something that needs to be looked into. 
That is how the civic, sport, and national spirit is developed. 
From Switzerland to America school lessons and sport 
manifestations begin with national anthems and state flags. 
  A good part of our people -- especially in the media where 
there are a lot of holdovers from the old times -- have not 
become used to the fact that we have our own state, that people 
should be brought up accordingly, and that we should behave 
accordingly everywhere -- from sport and culture to economy and 
so on. This is a banal example, but it speaks clearly for 
itself. 
  Excuse me for resorting to such a (?petty) example, but it 
seems to me that it is characteristic precisely because in other 
areas too it meets with a huge lack of understanding. 
  Once again, Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, let me express 
full recognition and gratitude for the work of the government. 
I fully agree that it has been possible to achieve these 
results only because you presented a united front, because the 
government as a whole was united, and because every minister, 
every member of government, was responsible for his or her 
ministry and further progress should be made along the same 
lines. 
  You were completely independent in the work of the 
government 
as a whole and in individual ministries. We should continue in 
the same way. But, gentlemen, speaking about that, the 
government as a whole and every government member -- as well as 
every civil servant, every clerk in the government -- must 
implement the state policy. There cannot be several policies. 
This government has done this, but in certain places at the 
level of clerks there are people who think that they can pass 
decisions according to their own judgment. Yes, everyone should 
be independent, but independent in the purposeful, useful work 
of implementing the overall state policy. 
  At my latest news conference I was asked whether there will 
be any changes in the government and what kind of changes. I 
said what the prime minister has just said. There will be no 
changes in the government. The government has won the majority 
support in the parliament, the trust of the people, and it also 
has my trust -- and it will have it because it works well and in 
the interest of Croatia. In my talks with Prime Minister Nikica 
Valentic we discussed no other problem than Croatia's interests. 
The interests of the Croatian people and the Croatian state are 
our priority. They are above all party interests, all 
particular, group, and other interests. So, rest assured that 
we will continue pursuing the policy that has achieved the 
results -- both in the internal and foreign spheres -- of which 
we can all be satisfied and proud. Thank you.

  [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has received a 
U.S. delegation, which included Madeleine Albright, U.S. 
ambassador to the United Nations and member of the U.S. 
Government; Charles Redman, special envoy of the U.S. President; 
General John Shalikashvili, commander of the U.S. Joint Chiefs 
of Staff; and Peter Galbraith, U.S. ambassador to the Republic 
of Croatia. 
  They discussed the political and military situation in the 
region, as well as the U.S. role in further efforts aimed at the 
settlement of the crisis. Mrs. Albright thanked President 
Tudjman for his special contribution toward the settlement of 
the crisis in former Yugoslavia, praising at the same time the 
overall policy of the Republic of Croatia regarding peace 
efforts toward the settlement of the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Special emphasis was laid on U.S. support for Croatia's 
territorial integrity and sovereignty and for the cease-fire 
agreement signed with local Serbs. The U.S. delegation 
reiterated U.S. readiness to help in the process of the peaceful 
reintegration of the occupied territories. 
  President Tudjman expressed gratitude to the United States 
for its crucial role in all positive steps and asked for support 
in connection with the acceptance of UNPROFOR's [UN Protection 
Forces] new mandate, i.e. that the United States should accept 
Croatia's demand regarding the total control of Croatia's 
borders, the opening of roads, and the return of refugees as 
soon as possible. 
  The two sides expressed satisfaction about the application 
of 
the Washington agreement on the ground and hoped that the 
constituent assembly in Sarajevo would accept the new 
constitution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. 
  They also discussed all future steps in the negotiating 
process and said that regular contacts would continue between 
representatives of the United States and the Republic of Croatia 
at all levels. 
  After the talks, President Tudjman gave a luncheon that was 
also attended by Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic. 
  On the Croatian side, the talks were attended by Mate 
Granic, 
deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Jure Radic, head of 
President Tudjman's office, Defense Minister Gojko Susak, 
Tudjman's National Security Advisor Hrvoje Sarinic, Gen. Janko 
Bobetko, chief of the general staff corps, and Maj. Gen. 
Zvonimir Cervenko, head of Tudjman's military department. 
  Foreign Minister Granic also held talks with the U.S. 
delegation. He told the U.S. ambassador that the Croatian 
Assembly also accepted the Washington agreement.

  [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman granted an 
interview to a group of foreign journalists, including 
journalists from Associated Press, THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
and DIE ZEIT, in the presidential palace in Zagreb this evening. 
  Replying to their questions, President Tudjman spoke about 
the cease-fire agreement reached between representatives of the 
local Serbs from the occupied Croatian areas and the Republic of 
Croatia, the Washington agreement, the overcoming of the crisis 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the causes of the Greater Serbian 
aggression and its tragic consequences for Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Now that we signed an agreement on the normalization of 
relations with Belgrade and the cease-fire agreement with the 
Serbs in UN protected areas in Croatia, a process of reopening 
roads and telecommunications should begin. At the same the 
rebuilding of trust between the Croatian authorities and the 
Serbs from these areas who were dragged into conflicts with the 
Croatian authorities by the former communist Yugoslav army 
should begin, President Tudjman said in reply to a question of 
what he expected from the cease-fire agreement. 
  By the gradual normalization of relations, President Tudjman 
said, we will try to restore trust to carry out elections for 
the local Serb self-administration in two counties in which they 
make up a majority. In the beginning we would like to create 
conditions for the return of more than 250,000 refugees, 
wherever it is possible, the president stressed, expressing the 
hope this would be possible to achieve gradually and through 
negotiations. 
  As regards the possibility of restoring economic ties, 
President Tudjman stressed that some Serbs from the UN protected 
areas a year ago signed an agreement with the Croatian 
authorities after which they were arrested by Serb extremists. 
We were called on to restore trade links and to normalize 
relations by the people from all Serb-held areas, even from 
Banja Luka, the Croatian president said. In the final phase the 
Croatian policy and that pursued by the Western countries 
coincided. That is the basis for the partnership between Croatia 
and the Western world, particularly the United States, President 
Tudjman said in reply to a question of whether the Washington 
agreement and the cease-fire agreement were a result of a 
turnabout in the Croatian policy or were a result of pressure 
coming from the West. 
  We wish to reintegrate the UN protected areas into the 
constitutional and legal system of Croatia in a peaceful way. 
If our efforts and those made by the United States and Russia 
did not bear fruit, Croatia would not be able to bear the 
present situation for ever, President Tudjman said, stressing 
that, in the light of the international situation, Serbia would 
have to agree to the normalization of relations.

  [Text] Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister of the Republic of Croatia, has presented to members of 
the Diplomatic Corps accredited to Croatia copies of the text of 
the cease-fire agreement signed yesterday between 
representatives of the Croatian authorities and Serb rebels from 
the temporarily occupied areas of the Republic of Croatia. 
  Minister Granic said Croatia was ready to take on a 
constructive role in negotiations with the Serb rebels and that 
it expected further progress in the implementation of the 
agreement and in the overall process of the peaceful 
reintegration of the occupied areas in the constitutional and 
legal system of the Republic of Croatia. 
  Granic also briefed the diplomats on the results so far of 
the implementation of the Washington agreement. All clashes 
between Muslim Bosnians and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina have 
ceased and humanitarian deliveries have improved. At the same 
time deputies of the constituent assembly accepted the 
Constitution of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Sarajevo yesterday. 
  Granic added that he expected representatives of the Serbian 
people to soon join in the negotiations on the peaceful 
settlement of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Interview with Milan Martic, leader of the Krajina Serbs, </F>
by Ratko Koprivica on 30 March; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Martic] We have truly invested the maximum effort 
and honesty in this agreement, and we intend to observe it to 
the maximum. If Croatia does the same....[pauses] However it 
should not use the same things as it has used in the past, such 
as not observing the Erdut Agreement, then I believe that we 
shall soon be able to establish all other relations. 
  The next step would involve the demarcation line; therefore, 
UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] troops will be deployed along 
the entire border; in those of our villages where UNPROFOR is 
stationed we will have our police, our authority. Croatian 
villages will be under Croatian authority. The demarcation line 
will have a 1 km width. However, UNPROFOR also has the mandate 
to control 20 km of territory within Croatia, and this is very 
significant. It is very important that, in addition to the 
UNPROFOR forces, we also have the involvement of U.S. and 
Russian diplomacy, which is a guarantee that this agreement will 
be fully observed. 
  [Koprivica] Since you have mentioned diplomacy, what does 
the Zagreb agreement mean for the Krajina in an international 
context? 
  [Martic] It means a lot. The fact that two of the most 
powerful forces -- the United States and Russia -- are 
participating in it, constitutes, in a certain way, the 
recognition of the republic of Serbian Krajina, acceptance of us 
as a reality, a state with its territory, authorities, and 
population. What remains is international recognition, and I 
believe that in the next phase we will be able to achieve this. 
Therefore, it is no longer the case that we are being treated 
only as local authorities -- which has been the case in the past 
-- but as an equal party to a conflict, as in the case of two 
states.

<F P=106> [Report by Danko Peric from Knin] </F>
  [Text] At a news conference held immediately upon the 
Krajina negotiating team's return from the Russian Embassy in 
Zagreb, it was stressed that the essence of the agreement signed 
this morning is contained in its title -- cessation of all armed 
hostilities. Unlike the present, that is, the two-year long 
situation on the ground, the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] 
will be deployed between the two, until now, warring sides. 
  The signing of the cease-fire agreement was preceded by a 
detailed analysis of maps indicating the existing situation by 
all the parties to the negotiations. According to the Krajina 
side, the cease-fire agreement also means that Kasici and other 
villages in Ravni Kotari have been returned to the republic of 
Serbian Krajina, which the Croatian Army occupied 14 months ago, 
and that the population of the Obrovac region -- a region which 
during the same Croatian aggression found itself in those parts 
of the Serbian Krajina that were the least safe -- will have a 
more peaceful life. 
  We learned at the news conference that the region of Velebit 
-- including its Obrovac part -- was the cause of the fiercest 
debate, or disagreement, that is, during the negotiations 
yesterday and overnight. The text of the cease-fire agreement 
is today the most sought-after written document and is being 
xeroxed and copied in Knin. The first date set in the document 
is 4 April. AT 0900 [0700 GMT] on that day, the cease-fire will 
enter into force on the front lines, while in the following 24 
hours -- so the agreement stipulates -- all indirect weaponry 
will be moved away [razmjesteno]: mortars and antiaircraft guns 
to a distance of at least 10 km, artillery and tanks to a 
distance of at least 20 km from the demarcation lines. 
  By 0900 at the latest on 8 April, all units on the 
demarcation lines will be disengaged in order to prevent mutual 
targeting with direct weapons. The cease-fire will be monitored 
by international observers. The agreement also confirms an 
agreement on the establishment of a joint commission with the 
aim of maintaining the cease-fire.

  [Text] Knin, Mar 31 (TANJUG) -- The vice-president of the 
State Duma, lower house of Russian parliamant, and of the 
Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia, Aleksandr Vangerovskiy, 
Thursday said that the Russian people was standing by the 
Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.). 
  Vangerovsky said at a rally of Serb-Russian friendship in 
Knin that Russia was rising from its knees and preparing for a 
campaign to help the R.S.K., adding that great changes were 
underway in Russia which would enable it to send even one 
thousand officers to the R.S.K. if necessary. 
  The rally, at which several thousand Knin inhabitants 
welcomed the State Duma delegation, was also attended by the 
R.S.K. President Milan Martic and Foreign Minister Slobodan 
Jarcevic. 
  Delegation member Yevgeniy Fyodorov, independent Duma 
deputee, expressed gratitude to the R.S.K. on behalf of the 
Russian Army. during the past three years, while Russia was on 
its knees, the R.S.K. was strong enough to successfully protect 
both its own and Russia's freedom. Now the Russian Army is with 
the R.S.K., he said. 
  The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 by the local Serbs in 
their ancestral lands in Croatia, in response to Croatia's 
violent secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and its 
trampling on the local Serbs' rights. 
  The R.S.K. became a U.N.-Protected Area (UNPA) in March, 
1992, but the deployment of the U.N. troops had not deterred 
Croatia from launching four offensives against the territory in 
attempts to impose its rule there by force.

  [Text] Knin, 31 March (TANJUG) -- Several thousand people 
gathered at Stojan Jankovic square in Knin today to greet a 
delegation of the Russian State Duma at a meeting of 
Serb-Russian friendship. The meeting was opened by the leader of 
the Serb National Renewal [Srpska Narodna Obnova], Mirko Jovic, 
and was attended by the president of the republic of Serb 
Krajina [RSK], Milan Martic, and the RSK minister of foreign 
affairs, Slobodan Jarcevic. On its visit to Krajina the 
delegation of the Russian parliamentarians is headed by 
Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, the vice chairman of the Duma and of the 
Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia. It also includes Vitaliy 
Sevastyanov, a hero of the USSR, and astronaut Yegeniy Fyodorov, 
an independent Duma deputy. 
  Addressing the people of Knin, Vengerovskiy -- often 
interrupted by tumultuous applause -- said that "Russia is 
rising again and is preparing to come to your help." He said 
that 170 million Russians were behind Krajina and that major 
changes were underway in Russia which would help to bring 1,000 
Russian officers to Krajina if necessary. "We have come here to 
extend our hands and to ensure that we are never separated 
again." It was with enthusiastic applause that Fyodorov's 
following words were greeted: "I express the Russian Army's 
enormous gratitude to you for having found enough strength over 
the last three years, while Russia was on its knees, to defend 
your and our freedom. The Russian Army is now with you." In 
conclusion Fyodorov said: "We are here, you are here, Turks out, 
Americans out." The Russian delegation has had talks with Milan 
Martic, the president of the RSK.

<F P=106> [Interview with Josip Manolic, chairman of the Croatian </F>
Parliament's House of Districts, by Andjelko Erceg on 25 March; 
place not given: "My Removal Is Encouragement for the 
Warmongers"] 
  [Text] We talked to Josip Manolic, chairman of the 
House of Districts [Zupanijski dom] yesterday [25 March], 
immediately after he postponed -- according to the rules of 
procedure -- the debate on the request for his removal, which 
was put forth by 36 Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] deputies 
and supported by the HDZ deputy caucus. 
  [Erceg] How would you interpret your removal from all 
functions in the party, and the no-confidence vote of your party 
colleagues from the deputy caucus of the House of Districts? 
  [Manolic] This is in complete accord with the policy 
conducted by President Tudjman. My political views do not 
coincide with his views, both regarding Croatian policy in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and regarding the functioning of the civic 
state and the way he leads the party. These three issues are 
dominant in my disagreement with Tudjman's policy, and that is 
the reason why the party is initiating these disciplinary and 
administrative proceedings against me. 
<H5>  The Rules of Procedure Must Be Observed </H5>
  [Erceg] After rejecting the belated placing on the agenda of 
the HDZ deputies' request for your removal from the post of 
chairman of the House of Districts, you also mentioned the 
significant political implications that could arise as a result 
of removing the House of Districts chairman in such a roundabout 
way? What implications did you have in mind? 
  [Manolic] The issue in question is the observance of the 
established rules of procedure of the Croatian Parliament, in 
accordance with which all sessions need to be conducted. You 
cannot allow someone to place something on the agenda by 
circumventing the rules of procedure on one occasion, and then 
denying this right to someone else on another occasion. 
Therefore, the rules of procedure must be conscientiously 
observed when establishing the agenda and any changes to it in 
the course of the session. 
  [Erceg] How would you assess the events that took place at 
the session of the HDZ's Presidency? Namely, there is rumor 
that in addition to pressure on you to resign, the removal of 
several other people was also discussed? Among them are 
Greguric, Mesic, and Valentic? 
  [Manolic] I do not know whether they were discussed in some 
other of the party's bodies and forums, but at the HDZ's 
Presidency session no other names were discussed apart from the 
ones whose dismissal is already public. 
  [Erceg] The differences you mentioned as existing between 
yourself and President Tudjman have been evident for some time. 
Why is it, however, that it is precisely at this moment and in 
such a way that these differences within the party are being 
addressed? 
  [Manolic] You know that I have been condemned for three 
interviews -- in GLOBUS of 14 January, in FERAL TRIBUNE, and the 
latest interview in DANAS, in which I -- as early as January -- 
said that Croatian policy in Bosnia was wrong. 
  Namely, I believe that the beginning of the war between the 
Croats and the Muslims was an unreasonable act. The 
consequences of this war are terrible, particularly for the 
Croatian people because they are the smallest ethnic group in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and they have surely had the greatest number 
of victims. I have believed from the very beginning that this 
policy was not a good one, that it did not take into account the 
interests of the Croatian people as a whole. Ways and opinions 
regarding the protection of Croatian interests in the region of 
Herzegovina -- where 98 percent of the population is Croatian -- 
are one thing, but the position of the Croats is entirely 
different in places where there are less of them, where they are 
just a minor ethnic group. 
  The Washington Agreement has strengthened precisely this 
position, that is, the position that peace with the Muslims 
should realize the principle of maintenance of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent and sovereign federation of 
three constituent nations. 
<H5>  The International Implications of the Dismissal </H5>
  [Erceg] Since President Tudjman has signed the Washington 
Agreement which endorses your current policy, this means that 
you are on the same side. Where, then, do the conflicts 
regarding policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina between you and President 
Tudjman come in? 
  [Manolic] This is precisely the absurdity that precipitates 
crucial questions. Is this move of Tudjman's a knife in the 
back of the Washington Agreement, executed by only one 
signatory? Does this mean that there is no desire to realize 
this agreement? The removal from political life of those who 
strived for such solutions before the agreement was signed 
lessens the chances for its realization and on the other hand 
presents a chance for those who initiated the war option to 
proceed with it under new conditions after the agreement is 
implemented. This means that various reasons will be sought 
that will block the agreement and thwart its implementation. 
Therefore, this is essentially encouragement for the warmongers. 
  [Erceg] Do you think that there will be international 
implications? 
  [Manolic] The very fact that we are dealing with such an act 
means that it will have repercussions on the international 
scene. Namely, questions will be asked about the true intentions 
of the signatories if people, who from the very beginning opted 
for peace and cooperation with the Muslims in these areas, are 
removed from politics. 
  [Erceg] It can be assumed that pressure on you to withdraw 
from all other functions will continue. It is well-known that 
you are the head of the State Commission for the Normalization 
of Relations with Serbs. How would your possible removal from 
this function affect current negotiations with the Serbs? 
  [Manolic] I think that my removal would not reflect well on 
either the party or the policy we are conducting toward the 
Serbs. 
  However, the decision is in the hands of President Tudjman 
who established the commission by decree and appointed me 
president. Therefore, he can also abolish it by decree. If this 
is thought out rationally, then I do not expect such a move, 
however, if irrationality and emotions prevail, then my removal 
is to be expected. 
<H5>  HDZ Is Headed Toward Isolation </H5>
  [Erceg] We have come to the third reason for the conflict -- 
the way in which the party is led. What, in your opinion, is 
Tudjman's greatest failing in this respect? 
  [Manolic] The very preparation of the Congress (the HDZ 
Congress) was unilateral, with the aim of disqualifying those 
people who had the proper attitude not only regarding Bosnia, 
but also regarding issues of denationalization and restructuring 
of the economy, as well as people who, in a democratic option, 
have embraced the HDZ as their party with all its ideological 
and political distinctions. 
  You are aware that the HDZ is founded on the ideologies of 
Starcevic [Croatian politician, founder of the Croatian Party of 
Rights], Radic [prominent Croatian politician, founder of the 
Croatian Peasants' Party and staunch opponent of Belgrade 
centralism, assassinated in the Yugoslav Parliament in 1928], 
and antifascism, and that these three components are essential 
to the HDZ. Today, however, by stressing that the HDZ is a 
party, we are deviating from these components. For my part, I 
maintain that the HDZ is still a movement based on its primary 
principles, which unites various political currents on the 
Croatian political scene. 
  [Erceg] What does the "dissolution" of these distinctions 
mean for the HDZ? 
  [Manolic] The dissolution of these distinctions means that 
the HDZ is actually declining into a narrow party-ideological 
realm that will in any case -- considering the entire Croatian 
political realm -- limit the influence and activity of the 
party, which will then, of course, lead it into isolation. 
<H5>  The Chaos of the Civic State </H5>
  [Erceg] To what extent is the conflict pertaining to the 
(non)functioning of the civic state -- which you mentioned 
earlier -- connected to the growing number of scandals that are 
becoming public? 
  [Manolic] You will remember that I said in an interview that 
the results of the functioning of the civic state are 
catastrophic. Every day we are faced with violence, violation of 
rights and liberties, illegal and unlawful eviction from 
apartments. We still face the grimmest kind of drug trafficking 
and other forms of organized crime. 
  When you compare these incidents with the number of such 
incidents that were prosecuted, you see how the civic state 
functions. And it is not by chance that the latest Bishops' 
Conference raised its voice against crime, violence, and similar 
occurrences that the civic state is supposed to solve. 
  [Erceg] Can you be plain? Do you perhaps wish to say that 
there are currents in the party's leadership that are blocking 
the functioning of the civic state? 
  [Manolic] Such a conclusion is self-evident. The civic 
state may not function from time to time, but if this persists, 
then chaos is imminent. If this happens, we no longer have a 
state, the essence of the state being measured by the degree to 
which it secures the rights and liberties of its citizens 
insofar as their personal status or resolving their material and 
other problems. 
<H5>  I Do Not Feel Guilty </H5>
  [Erceg] Are you still a member of the HDZ? 
  [Manolic] Yes, I still belong to the HDZ. You can be 
expelled, you can die, or you can resign from the HDZ. I 
refused to resign either from the party or the parliament, 
although my resignation was demanded. My resignation would mean 
that I admit to a certain amount of guilt, and I do not feel 
guilty because of two reasons. As far as the party is 
concerned, I do not feel at all guilty. As for the House of 
Districts, I led it in accordance with the Constitution and the 
Rules of Procedure, and I conducted policy in accordance with 
the policy of the HDZ. These are, therefore, the reasons why I 
will not resign and why I am demanding that the impeachment 
procedure be initiated in accordance with the Constitution and 
the Rules of Procedure. 
  [Erceg] How do you see your future position in the party 
and the parliament? 
  [Manolic] There are various possibilities: I may stay in the 
party and carry out my deputy duties, I may found my own party, 
or I may become an independent deputy. 
  [Erceg] How realizable is the option of a new party? 
  [Manolic] Everything, including this, depends on the 
development of the situation. If further complications arise 
and attempts to block the Washington Agreement continue; if the 
democratic institutions of the civic state do not begin 
functioning, then I think that we must build a policy -- 
together with all other democratic forces -- that will secure 
this process. 
  [Erceg] Is the demand for your removal and the no-confidence 
vote of the HDZ deputy caucus evidence that you do not have 
their trust, or do you believe that this decision was imposed on 
your party colleagues "from above"? 
  [Manolic] Party discipline in the HDZ is pretty strong. The 
HDZ holds the majority in both houses of the parliament, and it 
can make such decisions regardless of discipline. However, a 
great many deputies -- for reasons of pure opportunism --do not 
wish to defy this discipline and speak out against such 
decisions. 
<H5>  Deviation From Tudjman's Line -- Expulsion From the Party </H5>
  [Erceg] Your opponents insist that you are completely 
isolated within the party. How do you assess your own "actions"? 
  [Manolic] If this were accurate, then all these 
"administrative measures" would not be taken against me. 
  Such measures are essentially a way of frightening the 
entire 
membership and creating a psychosis that makes it clear that 
unless you adhere to President Tudjman's line you can either 
leave the party or you know what awaits you. In that case you 
will be expelled. 
  [Erceg] Who, in your opinion, has the greatest influence on 
President Tudjman's line? Who are these people? 
  [Manolic] I believe that the president himself primarily 
creates this line. It is Tudjman and Tudjman again. 
  [Erceg] Would you interpret the latest events as a definite 
rift in the HDZ? 
  [Manolic] I think that conditions for a definite rift have 
been satisfied. It only remains to be seen whether they will be 
expressed organizationally or not. 
  [Erceg] Does this mean early elections could be held? 
  [Manolic] In order for early elections to take place, we 
must first have such a crisis in the parliament that it would 
dictate these elections. If the rift in the HDZ becomes 
"operational," it will mean a crisis in the parliament that 
could lead to early elections. However, I believe that at this 
point they would not be to anyone's advantage. 
  [Erceg] Is this a definite parting of the ways between 
Tudjman and yourself? 
  [Manolic] I believe that all this should not yet be taken as 
a definite parting of ways. I wish to reiterate that everything 
still depends on developments in the political realm. The 
political realm still exists, although it has become 
considerably narrower. 
  [Erceg] If this is not a definite closing of doors in your 
relations, where do you see the maneuvering space for a 
"reconciliation" with Tudjman? 
  [Manolic] You see, he too can change his position regarding 
certain problems. For example, we are sure to agree on the 
issue of denationalization because it is in the party program. 
You can block the denationalization process for a certain 
period of time, but this problem cannot remain unsolved forever. 
  [Erceg] Can you agree with Tudjman on the way to lead the 
party? 
  [Manolic] That is much less likely to happen. That would be 
possible only if we were to hold an extraordinary Congress that 
would not be prepared unilaterally, but according to a 
completely democratic procedure.
