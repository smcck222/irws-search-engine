<F P=106> [Interview with Damir Zoric, vice president of the Chamber </F>
of Zupanijas of the Croatian parliament and a member of the 
Small Council of the Croatian Social Liberal Party, by Branko 
Podgornik; place and date not given: "The United States Only 
Gave a Sign"] 
  [Text] The Croat-Muslim agreement in Washington should be 
supported, but without euphoria, says Damir Zoric, vice 
president of the Chamber of Zupanijas of the parliament of the 
Republic of Croatia and a member of the Small Council of the 
Croatian Social Liberal Party [HSLS]. Zoric says that this truly 
might be a strategic turnaround in Croatian policy, but he adds 
that caution must be maintained with respect to the results of 
that agreement. 
  "Some Croatian opposition parties, especially Drazen Budisa 
and the HSLS, the Bosnian Croats, and the Franciscans have come 
out in favor of a Croat-Muslim agreement, and they did so at a 
point when it was not so popular, nor did it bring political 
success with most of the public. If at least one human life 
would have been saved, the agreement would have been successful. 
  "Nevertheless, those who have now come into their own should 
not be euphoric, nor should they hunt scapegoats, but should 
proceed cautiously so that the agreement really bears fruit, 
because implementing it will be painful," Zoric warns. 
  [Podgornik] What do you think about the confederation of 
Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina? 
  [Zoric] Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina can enter into 
definite intergovernmental relations only after they become 
sovereign over their entire territory. It is in the interest of 
Croatia for Bosnia and Herzegovina to remain an integral state, 
and for the Croats to be equal citizens in it. But it seems as 
though some people see in this proposal a confederation of a 
truncated Croatia with a detached piece of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. That would be a triumph for the conception held by 
Serbian expansionism, which means death to both Croatia and 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, because those two states, whether in 
confederation or separate, would be territorially untenable in 
the face of an expanded chetnik Serbia, which is ravaging our 
entrails. 
  [Podgornik] But the United States guarantees that it will 
support the territorial integrity of Croatia, so it seems that 
we have never been closer to recovery of the occupied 
territories. 
  [Zoric] It is true that the United States has changed its 
policy toward that area. But, if I might so put it, the United 
States has only given a sign to Croatia and Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. There still is not a single reliable manifestation 
that the United States is really thinking seriously. The United 
States sent an ultimatum to the Serbs around Sarajevo, but that 
ultimatum also threatens the Croats around Mostar. Clinton said 
that the United States has found its strategic interest here; 
however, this happened at the same time when Saudi Arabia was 
announcing that it would invest $8 billion to buy U.S. aircraft. 
The question is whether that will be enough. At the same time, 
it is easy to see from the Serbian media that with their most 
recent offensives in Bosnia and the violation of the truce in 
Croatia they have actually been testing to what extent the 
Americans are willing to persist in their new course of policy. 
<H5>  The Specter of a Revived Yugoslavia Is Abroad </H5>
  [Podgornik] Are you afraid of a revival of Yugoslavia? 
  [Zoric] That danger does exist. For instance, the Croats and 
Muslims create a federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and want 
to marry it to Croatia--so that Bosnia and Herzegovina formally 
remains intact, but with the status of the Bosnian Serbs 
unresolved. What in that case could prevent the international 
community from allowing the Bosnian Serbs confederation with 
Serbia? When you have that kind of asymmetrical confederation 
with a Bosnia and Herzegovina that exists as a legal entity, you 
could get Yugoslavia in the course of a single night. 
  [Podgornik] When could a referendum be held of the 
population 
concerning the confederation of Croatia and Bosnia and 
Herzegovina? 
  [Zoric] That referendum could be legitimate only if it could 
be conducted in the areas now occupied as well. If it were not 
conducted in the areas occupied as well, the referendum might 
legalize the amputation of a fourth of the territory of the 
Republic of Croatia. 
  [Podgornik] What consequences will the Washington agreement 
have on the domestic scene of Croatia? 
  [Zoric] I think that the Croatian Government has made a good 
move and should now encourage creation of confidence and 
national consensus among the Croatian political forces. But the 
responsibility for that, I would say, lies above all on the 
opposition, which at this point ought not to cause nervousness 
and hunt scapegoats for the past, because that could be 
devastating to the process of peace between Croats and Muslims. 
For those who favor Croat-Muslim cooperation, the fact that 
there is an agreement is much more important than to seek 
justice or a gain for the party. I am convinced of that, and I 
would like to see that happen, at least as far as my HSLS is 
concerned. Nervousness would not favor the Croats in Bosnia nor 
the Croats in Herzegovina, for various reasons. 
<H5>  The Baneful "Tito's Youth" </H5>
  [Podgornik] Does this mean that the HSLS will now be less 
critical of the government? 
  [Zoric] No. We have not been critical of the HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Union] just because of the disastrous policy toward 
Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Now that 
one of the sore points for the nationality has started to move 
toward resolution, the opposition ceases to be hostage to the 
issue of Bosnia and has been given more room. Now we can be 
still more critical of the incumbent party when it comes to 
denationalization, transformation of ownership, and many moves 
made in the economic area. 
  [Podgornik] Could implementation of the Washington agreement 
encounter any serious resistance in a segment of the incumbent 
party or the opposition? 
  [Zoric] There are more grounds for supporting the agreement 
than the other way around. Some people will see the agreement as 
a continuation of Croatian policy, others as a change of 
direction, still others as an alliance against a common enemy, 
and yet others as the interest of the nationality or the human 
interest. 
  The conduct of the new policy, however, could be very 
painful 
in Herzegovina. The policy of reaching agreement between Croats 
and Muslims is out of step with the facts and emotions at the 
moment, and we should therefore take care that its 
implementation does not conflict with reality. Another question 
is whether the same people can carry out two concepts that are 
so different, those people who have gone from war to alliance. I 
am afraid that resistance could arise to people who as 
bureaucrats go too far in carrying out particular directives. In 
the HDZ of Bosnia and Herzegovina there are people who do not go 
abroad because they might have certain problems with foreign 
judiciaries. 
  [Podgornik] You are referring to Mate Boban? 
  [Zoric] I am referring to "Tito's Youth," who are today 
ruling Herceg- Bosna. Those who at one time sweated profusely in 
labor brigades in order to earn badges as shockworkers. Some 
people who are today guiding the HDZ as a people's party of 
Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina at one time had the first 
founders of the HDZ in Herzegovina called in for police 
interviews. They are very clever political operatives, but not 
very clever with their own people, whom they are now putting 
between the rock and the hard place, and in the end they have 
driven many people in Herzegovina crazy. 
  Look at the result. The Herzegovinians are humiliated. The 
rest of the nationality looks on them as the problem causing 
unrest all over Croatia. And it is well-known that the 
Herzegovinians are that part of the Croatian nation, formerly 
and now, who from the depth of their soul have been fighting 
with their lives and resources for Croatian independence even 
against Yugoslavia, which signifies death to Croatia and Croats. 
  Today, their political leaders are issuing reports to the 
effect that there are supposedly no problems in Herzegovina. 
However, there certainly are problems in Herzegovina. People are 
confused, because they were waging war for a cause, they were 
losing their lives, their children, their husbands, their farms. 
They had more casualties in the war with the Muslims than with 
the Serbs. Today, many people are asking: Why? That question is 
troubling a great number of people who have sizable families, 
and they are living in complete economic and political 
uncertainty and confusion. This is the average destiny of most 
people who until yesterday were told that they would be the 
masters of Herceg-Bosna and that Neum was Croatian. And today 
they are being given explanations that under the Washington 
agreement Croatia would be allowed passage through Neum and that 
what is happening to them and Croatia constitutes a continuation 
of a successful policy. If Croatian political forces do not act 
cautiously, I am afraid that the Herzegovinians could again end 
up on what for them is the perpetual "wrong side." That is in 
fact why I cautioned that the opposition now has greater 
responsibility than the government, because this is a question 
of fundamental interest to the nationality. 
<H5>  There Is No Split in the HSLS </H5>
  [Podgornik] Is the HSLS threatened with a split such as has 
happened in the HSP [Croatian Rights Party] or the IDS [Istrian 
Democratic Conference]? 
  [Zoric] No. In the course of the fierce campaign against us, 
the HSLS proved that it is a mature political party. Maturity is 
not a consequence of complete and doctrinaire unanimity of 
opinion in a party, but above all of responsibility and 
practicality. The HSLS is a political alternative to the 
incumbent party in its program, its strength, and the people it 
brings together. 
  [Podgornik] Can the HSLS remain the second party? How do you 
interpret the disagreements in the party which have even broken 
through to the public? 
  [Zoric] The HSLS can remain the second party, but it will 
not, it will do everything to become the first party. As for the 
second question, let us say that perhaps we have a good 
conception of political marketing. We live on the public's 
interest in us, so we have taken pains to interest people in 
something that sounds more enticing, more unusual. 
  [Podgornik] Are you really the leader of the "harder ethnic 
line" in the HSLS? 
  [Zoric] Many people have attributed that to me. Because I do 
not see what is bad about that, I can publicly admit that it is 
my honor to be perceived that way. We are a democratic party, 
and with us every position is won through a competition in which 
there is a candidate and an opposing candidate, so some win and 
some lose. That will also happen in the party convention in May, 
but that will not signify a split. For example, there are seven 
candidates for the four vice presidents of the HSLS. If one of 
the candidates loses in a race with me, that will not signify a 
split, but will mean that the party is organized along 
democratic lines. We operate along democratic lines even within 
the party, which is why I think we are able to bring Croatia 
real democracy. 
  [Podgornik] You recently made a trip to the United States 
with Ivan Herak, who during that trip was expelled from the IDS. 
Will he really become a member of the HSLS? 
  [Zoric] I have talked to Herak a great deal, and I think 
that 
these are very close political ideas. I naturally tried to 
persuade him to come over to the HSLS and I will be glad if I 
managed to persuade Herak. I would also like Denis Jelenkovic to 
come to the HSLS. I think that the HSLS has a great chance of 
success in Istria, because it is the second party there, and 
Drazen Budisa, you recall, obtained a convincing majority of the 
votes among all the presidential candidates in the election.

  [Excerpt] "The documents which have been signed on the 
federation of Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina are of 
historical significance and represent a turning point in the 
difficult times in which the two peoples are living. l cannot 
conceal my satisfaction at the fact that this is the 
implementation of a policy which the Croatian Social Liberal 
Alliance [HSLS], in contrast to the ruling party, has supported 
from the very beginning, because this is the concept which will 
make possible the existence of our neighboring state and thereby 
the reintegration of occupied territories into Croatia," Drazen 
Budisa, president of the HSLS, said in a public speech in Omis 
[a coastal town south of Split]. He stressed his reservations 
regarding the possible confederal agreement between Croatia and 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, warning that only integral 
states can make agreements on confederal alliances. 
  "If no significant changes are made to establish the legal 
order of the Croatian state in the occupied areas, the HSLS will 
oppose the scheduling of a referendum on creating the confederal 
alliance," Budisa stressed, stating his opinion that the best 
solution for all the people in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be that 
it remain a federal state of three peoples with equal rights and 
with good links to Croatia but also to Serbia. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by V. Bozic: "Fear of Confederation With Belgrade"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Virovitica -- The Croatian Social Liberal 
Alliance [HSLS] is against the creation of a large number of 
municipalities, increased bureaucracy, and illogical 
centralization of power. It is necessary to question those who 
supported such an organization, claiming that it will not be 
expensive, Bozo Kovacevic, the chief secretary of the HSLS said 
on the podium in Virovitica on the occasion of founding the HSLS 
zupanija [parish] assembly for the Virovitica-Podravska Zupanija. 
  The assembly was opened by the Virovitica HSLS branch 
president, Dr. Mirko Selak, who pointed out that, five years 
after the party has been founded, the last zupanija assembly is 
being formed here in Virovitica. Ivan Knezevic, the president of 
the Orahovica branch and the initiator for founding the party in 
this zupanija, addressed the assembly, pointing out social 
problems and poverty on one hand and the unscrupulous enrichment 
of some individuals on the other. 
  "The state must be sensitive to social issues. The state 
must 
make it possible for capable individuals to compete and must 
protect the livelihood of those who are less capable. The HSLS 
is a liberal party with a clear social emphasis," HSLS president 
Drazen Budisa said in the introductory speech of the assembly, 
stressing that the HSLS is a political party of the center, 
which means that it will not lapse into totalitarism of the 
right or left. 
  "The state, as the HSLS conceives it, should be as sensitive 
as possible toward its citizens and as strong as possible toward 
the outside world. We oppose the view that the party should be 
regarded as identical with the state or with patriotism, and we 
support free markets, trade, and learning, Drazen Budisa 
emphasized, pointing out that political opposition parties 
should not just have a decorative function but should also have 
a corrective role in the area of political power. [no closing 
quotation mark as published] 
  According to Budisa, the HSLS supports the Croatian-Muslim 
federation agreement because it had a similar proposal drafted 
in its program as early as 1992. 
  "The HSLA will ask the question of political responsibility 
for Croatian victims in the Croat-Muslim war. We are viewing the 
possible confederation with caution, so that it does not result 
indirectly in a confederation with Belgrade. We are for 
cultural, economic, and other links with the states that came 
into existence in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, but we 
are not for political associations, especially not with 
Serbia,'' Drazen Budisa said, emphasizing that a peaceful 
reintegration of the occupied territories of Croatia is expected 
under the pressure of Washington and Moscow. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Reconciliation of `Hardheads'"] </F>
  [Text] The departure of the members of the Serbian 
Volunteer Guard from the Erdut Military Training Center is not 
going to be a cause of yet another Serbian quarrel. Milan 
Martic, president of the republic of Serbian Krajina, and Zeljko 
Raznatovic Arkan, commander of the "Tigers" [the Serbian 
Volunteer Guard], are adamant about that. 
  The Center changed owners last Friday and the ceremony was 
attended by both Martic and Raznatovic, who thereby implemented 
the agreement reached earlier. The Erdut Training Center will 
in future serve for the training of special units of the army of 
the Srpska republic. 
  "Arkan's soldiers have not been expelled. Dust has been 
raised about that in public completely unnecessarily. There is 
simply no need for their presence in Erdut," Milan Martic claims 
categorically. "The Serbian Volunteer Guard contributed to the 
liberation of some parts of Krajina and, if the need arises, we 
are going to count on their help in the future as well." 
  Zeljko Raznatovic Arkan, hitherto commander of the Erdut 
Military Training Center, said something similar: "We have also 
assessed that, after three years, there is no longer any need 
for us to be concentrated in Erdut. We have left the Training 
Center in perfect condition, well furnished and equipped," 
Raznatovic says. "My 240 soldiers are now dispersed in three 
directions: Those who were born in the Srpska republic and the 
republic of Serbian Krajina have placed themselves under the 
command of the local armies, and some of them have removed their 
uniforms." 
  Touching upon the earlier disagreements with Martic, 
Raznatovic says that they were not upon a personal, but a 
strategic basis. What is involved, he says, is the different 
views (his and Martic's) of the Maslenica events last year. 
  "Martic and I are hardheads, but, being real Serbs, we 
forgot 
our disagreement and buried the hatchet. After all, it suits 
me, as the chairman of the Serbian Unity Party, to be reconciled 
with every honorable Serb," Raznatovic concludes.

<F P=106> [Article by Slavica Lukic: "Mirko Madjor Is Lying"] </F>
  [Excerpts] "The key role in the attempt to destabilize the 
Croatian Peasants' Party [HSS] was played by government circles 
outside our party. We have proof that the Information Office of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its chief, Ante Babic, 
participated in it. Kilograms of material intended to undermine 
confidence in the present HSS leadership were sent from the fax 
machine in Mr. Babic's office and in envelopes belonging to the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Some material was sent from fax 
machines in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and we have other 
proof of the involvement of government bodies about which we do 
not wish to speak." This is what the head of the HSS, Drago 
Stipac, said after 16 days of silence regarding the events in 
the HSS, the Kasinski [Kasina, a town near Zagreb] meeting, and 
the open letter of Mirko Madjor. HSS Political Secretary Mirko 
Glokovic and vice president of the party's Presidency Stjepan 
Radic also spoke at a news conference held on Monday at HSS 
headquarters. 
  Drago Stipac admits that, due to a rapid increase in HSS 
membership, organizational, personnel, and financial problems 
occurred, but he claims that they are not nearly as drastic as 
Madjor and Stojanovic are trying to portray them. Stipac 
believes that the claims that Madjor and Stojanovic have 
presented in the open letter and in the media are lies and 
half-truths. The HSS, he states, is not some kind of a peasant 
trade union. Only 27 percent of its members are peasants; the 
rest have other occupations. Certain communications problems 
with the field branches also exist, but they are gradually being 
resolved. [passage omitted] 
  Stipac informed the journalists that a closed meeting of the 
HSS Executive Council was held on 12 March at which the 
documents of the Kasinski meeting were discussed in detail. It 
was established that 51 HSS members were present in Kasina and 
that some of them had been misled and falsely informed about the 
content of the documents they had signed. The HSS Executive 
Council assessed that the Kasinski meeting was convoked in an 
illegal manner and that the claims in the Kasinski documents are 
not true. Mirko Madjor and Dr. Stojanovic were removed from all 
their party functions with 90 votes for and only four against. 
Thus, the decision on their suspension made earlier by the HSS 
Presidency was confirmed. The HSS leaders repeated several times 
that there is no rift in the HSS and that the rebellion of 
Madjor and Stojanovic stems from their dissatisfaction with 
their own positions in the HSS. It was heard at the conference 
that "Madjor became dissatisfied from the moment when he was not 
elected president of the HSS." [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  Vukovar Officials Visit Exiles in </H5>
Croatia 
  Vukovar Mayor Dr. Jure Kolak, Deputy Mayor Grgo Plenkovic, 
and secretary of the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] city 
council Petar Mlinaric reportedly visited Vukovar exiles in the 
Makarska littoral region of Croatia to examine housing 
accommodations and problems. According to the 13 March Split 
daily SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, the exiles were "increasingly 
disappointed with empty promises," and "felt abandoned." They 
complained about "food, health services, and various types of 
harassment." The major topic of conversation in the Alga Hotel, 
where most of the Vukovar exiles are housed, was an impending 
transfer of 170 exiles from Vukovar and about 90 from Slavonia 
and Drnis in order to prepare the hotel for the tourist season. 
However, the Vukovar exiles have already been moved as many as 
six times and are refusing to consider another transfer, the 
paper states. They also refuse to be moved into weekend houses 
belonging to Serbs or into other facilities on the coast, 
insisting on remaining in the Alga Hotel. The paper cites Mayor 
Kolak as promising the exiles that no one would force them to 
leave the hotel and that he would insist that the Croatian 
Government improve their standard of living. The members of the 
Vukovar leadership found "an even worse situation" among 180 
sick and elderly Vukovar exiles housed in the Djuro Salaj resort 
center in Grac. The delegation from Vukovar was also received 
by Makarska Mayor Ivan Ivanda and other local officials. During 
that meeting, Kolak expressed his gratitude to the city of 
Makarska for taking such good care of the Vukovar exiles, 
SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reports. 
<H5>  Possible Violation of Sanctions Against Serbia </H5>
  In an article titled "Is Western Bosnia a Banana Republic of 
the Voce [Fruit] Enterprise?" the Zagreb weekly GLOBUS on 10 
March reports that Fikret Abdic, president of the so-called 
autonomous province of western Bosnia, and Croatian President 
Franjo Tudjman held a "regular" meeting at the presidential 
palace in Zagreb on 7 March, immediately after which Abdic, in 
"his Mercedes with Vienna tags, accompanied by police vehicles, 
drove to the main office of the Voce Import-Export enterprise, 
which is today his most important, and perhaps only, business 
partner." GLOBUS explains that Voce, based in Zagreb, "in just 
a few months," had dispatched 30 million German marks' worth of 
goods in the direction of Velika Kladusa in the autonomous 
province of western Bosnia. The weekly maintains that the goods 
were transported in about 100 convoys of trucks belonging to 
Agrokomerc, a large agricultural and industrial firm located in 
Velika Kladusa and headed by Abdic. Each of the convoys 
transported about 400 metric tons of goods, GLOBUS reports, and, 
in the last four months, tanker trucks had been transporting 
about 200 tons of crude oil each. Voce bought the goods from 
the Zagreb-based petroleum processor INA, other Croatian firms, 
and "a few" Slovene firms, reselling them to the local 
government in Velika Kladusa. All the convoys passed through 
Serb-held Croatian territory, from Turanj, a suburb of Karlovac, 
via Vojnici to Velika Kladusa. Since the quantity of goods 
transported would be sufficient for a population three times 
that of western Bosnia, "it is clear that Fikret Abdic is buying 
the free passage of his convoys by reserving a portion of the 
goods for Serbs in the occupied Croatian territories," GLOBUS 
asserts. The weekly states that since all the goods sent to 
Velika Kladusa came from Voce, the following questions should be 
asked: "Has the firm violated the embargo against Serbia by 
helping Fikret Abdic, whom the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
in Sarajevo has declared a traitor because of his trade with the 
Serbs? Has Voce, with the blessing of the Croatian Government, 
been selling the goods to Fikret Abdic...? Has Voce, once the 
largest export firm in the former Yugoslavia, which lost the 
majority of its partners after the disintegration of that former 
state, created, in the autonomous province of western Bosnia, an 
indispensable market for the sale of its goods?" GLOBUS cites 
Jure Klaric, director of Voce, as admitting that "even today, we 
are using the contacts that Fikret Abdic has established with 
the Serbs." 
<H5>  HDZ Conflicts Linked To Cement Factory Deal </H5>
  Herceg-Bosna is not the only controversial topic among 
leading Croatian politicians, says the 25 February GLOBUS. The 
weekly comments that the case of the unsuccessful attempt in 
1991 to sell the Split Dalmacijacement cement factory to the 
Italian firm Calcestruzzi shows that the most intense political 
conflicts in the Croatian Democratic Community are linked to 
important economic issues. In the case of Dalmacijacement, the 
weekly notes, a grave conflict emerged between the present chief 
of the intelligence service, Hrvoje Sarinic, who was the head of 
the Office of the President in 1991, and current Minister of 
Trade Nadan Vidosevic, who was director of Dalmacijacement at 
that time. GLOBUS publishes the minutes of a heated quarrel in 
1991 between Sarinic and Vidosevic on the issue of the sale of 
Dalmacijacement, commenting that the minutes, in addition to 
revealing the extent of the previously unknown conflicts in the 
HDZ leadership, also indicate how business decisions are made in 
Croatia: "The minutes from Sarinic's office plainly show that 
even today the main decisions in Croatia are made just as they 
were during the communist regime.... The office of the 
president tried to make the decision on a business deal worth 
hundreds of millions of German marks [DM], against the will of 
the Dalmacijacement management! Hrvoje Sarinic tried 
two-and-a-half years ago to persuade, at all costs, the director 
of Dalmacijacement to sell the enterprise to the Italians as 
quickly as possible." Another significant issue, GLOBUS states, 
is an alleged commission of $12.5 million, which, according to 
the director of Calcestruzzi, was paid in 1991. The weekly adds 
that it is believed in Croatian political circles that the money 
was spent for government needs. 
<H5>  Denationalization of Housing </H5>
  The Croatian Government has drafted a proposal for the 
return 
of apartments and houses that the communist government 
confiscated and nationalized after World War II, reports the 10 
March GLOBUS. The owners, however, would be able to take 
possession of them only after a period of three to 10 years. 
GLOBUS points out that Croatian and foreign citizens who 
participated in the "aggression against the Republic of Croatia" 
would not have the right to retake possession of their 
properties. About 43,000 apartments will have to be returned to 
the owners from whom they were confiscated, and 150,000 current 
occupants will therefore be looking for new homes, GLOBUS states. 
<H5>  Apartments for Government Workers </H5>
  The 15 March edition of the Zagreb weekly DANAS reports that 
the Croatian Government, as part of its housing reform program, 
plans to build 8,600 apartments for government workers in the 
next 10 years. The construction cost of the apartments will 
amount to DM670,800,000. 
<H5>  Hotel Shares Sold </H5>
  The sale of shares of the Solitudo tourist hotel enterprise 
on the Adriatic island of Lastovo has been completed, says the 
13 March SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. According to a decision by the 
Croatian Privatization Fund, the enterprise has become a 
shareholding company. The value of the enterprise has been 
assessed at 25,557,873,600 Croatian dinars, or DM6,811,800. The 
shareholders have bought 11 percent of the enterprise, paying a 
total of DM758,600. Of the 44 shareholders, 20 are from Lastovo 
and the remainder from other parts of Croatia. 
<H5>  DM1 Million for Zadar Enterprise </H5>
  At a 17 March public auction at the Zagreb stock market, 
1,139 shares in three enterprises were sold for a total of 
DM1,062,000, or 3.884 billion Croatian dinars. The report in the 
18 March SLOBODNA DALMACIJA says that the largest number of 
shares traded at this auction, the year's eleventh, was for the 
Mehanizacija firm. The Croatia Bank purchased 999 shares of this 
Zadar enterprise for approximately DM999,000. Ten shares of 
Zagrebgradnja [Zagreb Construction] were sold to the Investco 
brokerage company for DM50,000, while the Rijeka Bank bought 130 
shares of the Rijeka Usluga [Services] enterprise for DM13,000. 
<H5>  Shares of Solta Island Firm Sold </H5>
  The 15 March issue of SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reports that the 
entire offering of 51,325 shares, priced at DM100 each, in the 
largest HTP [Hotel-Tourist Enterprise] firm on the Adriatic 
island of Solta was sold in the last few days. The shares sold 
represent half the enterprise's value. Shares constituting the 
other half will be transferred to the Croatian Privatization 
Fund, which will retain 10,400 of them, with a value of 
DM1,040,000, for possible owner restitution and offer the 
rest--40,925 shares--for public sale in the next 30 to 40 days.

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Dr. Magda Mrnkova, member of </F>
the Executive Committee of the Democratic Alliance of Slovakia; 
place and date not given: "Why They Come to the Czech Republic"] 
  [Text] On the territory of the Czech Republic [CR], there 
exists the Slovak Activities Forum. Associated in it are the 
Slovak Community in the CR, the Union of Slovaks, the Democratic 
Alliance of Slovaks, and other entities. Because not all of them 
have identical views, any statement issued in the name of the 
forum must be approved unanimously. One vote against means an 
automatic veto. 
  We spoke with a member of the Executive Committee of the 
Democratic Alliance of Slovaks, Dr. Magda Mrnkova. 
  [LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE] How many Slovaks are there in the CR? 
  [Mrnkova] More than 300,000. We do not live in enclaves, but 
more in something like a diaspora. 
  [LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE] It is no secret that the Slovaks in the 
CR hold different views on the Slovak reality. Many times they 
are in direct contradiction.... 
  [Mrnkova] Yes, in some cases that is true. For example, we, 
the Democratic Alliance of Slovaks, have different views from 
those of the Slovak Community in the CR. We are sometimes 
attacked for being "renegades." That is not true. We perceive 
ourselves as Slovaks, and we love Slovakia. We have some basic 
reservations about some of the steps taken by the Slovak 
Government. And one more thing--if I come up against some 
problem, I want to speak up as a citizen who does not like 
something, not as a Slovak whom others have wronged. 
  [LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE] Are people leaving Slovakia to go to the 
CR? 
  [Mrnkova] This is true especially of intellectuals. There is 
a hostility toward them in Slovakia. Recently, for example, came 
Lubomir Feldek, Juraj Jakubisko, Deana Horvathova, Zuzana 
Minacova, Jan Sebechlebsky, and others. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] What information do you have about the 
atmosphere that prevails in Slovakia? 
  [Mrnkova] We have very fragmentary information. Observe, if 
you will, the growing distance between us as a result of poor 
information. For example, formerly, every CR citizen understood 
Markovic's jokes 100 percent. Now, the figure is only about 70 
percent. We are losing our familiarity with the facts of 
everyday life. We have to depend on what friends tell us when 
they come here and what we see when we go to Slovakia. Many 
people there find themselves in social isolation. There are a 
few small islands where democratically thinking people meet. You 
see, even that gives a picture of what the atmosphere there is 
like. 
  [LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE] So you do not feel exactly happy.... 
  [Mrnkova] Sad, rather. I am a Slovak and I love Slovakia. I 
never wanted us to split up. I believe that many people in 
Slovakia did not want it, either. In spite of that, they voted 
the way they voted. Even though I did not want the breakup of 
Czechoslovakia, I have to accept it as reality. But the fact 
that I am now a CR citizen does not mean that I am indifferent 
toward Slovakia. I will never be indifferent to it. And I 
believe that none of us who left Slovkia and are now living here 
are indifferent to it. That is why we feel somewhat sad now. 
  [LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE] Those are your personal views. How would 
the Democratic Alliance of Slovaks formulate its current 
position? 
  [Mrnkova] What is happening in Slovakia does, of course, 
touch us, even though we are CR citizens. We have often heard 
from various sides the suggestion that we have forgotten 
Slovakia and that we are sharing in creating a negative picture 
of it abroad. But the truth lies elsewhere. What is now 
happening in Slovakia and where these developments are leading 
could be anticipated already after the 1992 elections. That is 
why many people left Slovakia. We pointed out several times that 
democratic development of the society in Slovakia wass at risk. 
The governing movement was not and is not ready to govern. The 
proof is that, currently, some of its members went to the 
opposition. 
  The only thing we wish for Slovak citizens is that Slovakia 
become visible as a real democracy. But without any more 
experiments.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Vladimir Kucera: "Mysterious Phenomenon V. </F>
Meciar"] 
  [Text] He appeared in a peculiar way. Most likely he was 
suggested by the intellectuals from the VPN [Public Against 
Violence], with Fedor Gal at its head, as a battering ram who 
would realize their goals. 
  Already at the time when it still appeared that it would 
work 
that way, a confrontation took place concerning the language 
law. On the Slovak National Uprising [SNP] Square in Bratislava, 
crowded with fanatic nationalists, arrived a procession of brave 
democrats. They chanted: "Long live Czechoslovakia!," "Long live 
Havel!," and "Long live Meciar!" It is remarkable that Vladimir 
Meciar did not take part in this demonstration, in which he was 
the symbol of the democratic forces. 
  Then the situation developed the way it developed. The 
battering ram soon got out of hand. He turned against those who 
thought they would control him. He captivated the citizens. 
Although he was deftly maneuvered out of executive power, the 
SNP Square was again crowded with people who again chanted "Long 
live Meciar!" Most likely, many people shouted this who on the 
previous occasion booed his name. It is remarkable that, again, 
Meciar was not present. The crowd was led by Milan Knazko. The 
doors to the parliament were broken down. Knazko promised on 
Meciar's behalf that his friend would return. During the 
negotiations, an extraordinary role was played by Ministers 
Filkus and Kovac, who surprisingly supported Meciar and joined 
the HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia]. Where are Knazko 
and Filkus now? 
  Vladimir Meciar returned in triumph and acted in the same 
singular manner as before. Again, everything was the way the 
Prime Minister of the Czech Government, Pithart, used to tell 
about: "We come to an agreement on everything, then we have a 
friendly talk about dogs. The next morning I learn, to my 
consternation, that the Slovak prime minister said something 
entirely different in Slovakia than what we agreed upon." 
  But, in the second round, Meciar came up against a different 
adversary. Even so, all of the negotiations showed that Klaus, 
who has the reputation of being foxy, is a transparent 
politician compared to Meciar. 
  Meciar's mysterious disappearances for several days at a 
time, about which many rumors have been circulating, also 
continued. Again, contradictory statements were made, positions 
changed from day to day. No one will probably ever find out if 
the Slovak prime minister knows that he said something different 
yesterday from what he did today. Even that is one of his 
secrets, just like whether he really wanted to split up 
Czechoslovakia. But he did split it up. 
  Vladimir Meciar presents himself as a straight-arrow Janosik 
[Slovak Robin Hood]. He is, however, more of a deft manipulator. 
It is another one of his secrets how he forces people to get up 
from their sickbeds when he needs them, to change their views, 
to put themselves on the line for him when they clearly do not 
want to. He does not manipulate publicly but in a kind of 
"private" way, by personal intimations. 
  Also puzzling are the surprising changes in the expressions 
on his face. At one time, a kind of militant fervor. Then a 
change from one day to the next into an expression of the 
suffering of a persecuted man. The question is whether these are 
the two faces of Janus or two masks. 
  Mrs. Nagyova, his right hand, who always stands by his side, 
or, if protocol does not allow it, at least very close to him, 
should know much about Meciar's secrets. 
  The greatest mystery concerning the Slovak prime minister 
is, 
of course, how he manages to stay in office--unless, of course, 
it happens to be merely part of the much deeper mystery of the 
Slovak society.

<F P=106> [Interview with Milan Knazko, chairman of the Alliance of </F>
Democrats of the Slovak Republic, by Maria Hluchanova and Jana 
Pankovcinova; place and date not given: "We Are All Defectors 
From Totalitarianism"] 
  [Text] We have learned that, on Saturday [26 March], the 
government took stock of the economic situation in individual 
government departments. Deputy Prime Minister Schmognerova had 
visited the IMF, chiefly to discuss the extension to the Slovak 
Republic of the so-called standby credit. The government will 
apparently have to decide either to introduce unpopular economic 
measures or to consider drawing on the standby credit, which 
would be connected with restrictive measures in the social 
sphere. 
  [SME] What is the opinion of the Alliance of Democrats of 
the Slovak Republic [AD SR]? 
  [Knazko] We do not want this government to behave like a 
government that has elections in mind. Although the 
government's situation is not easy because some departments have 
deficits amounting to billions [of Slovak korunas], it should 
establish good conditions for the next government, even at the 
expense of electoral preferences. It is necessary to explain 
pragmatically to the citizen where we stand and stop making 
promises. I am confident that the coalition will come to an 
agreement. The path toward it will be difficult and 
complicated, but the decisions will then be all the more 
responsible and conceptual. Let us not anticipate events. 
  [SME] The present opposition is sending out signals about 
imminent mass dismissals from the state administration to be 
carried out by this government. If this is true, which and how 
many posts will be affected? 
  [Knazko] Professional expertise is the number-one criterion. 
We have not yet discussed this issue in the coalition, but there 
cannot be any talk about sweeping or ideologically motivated 
dismissals. We are not going to make the same mistakes as the 
previous government; we are not going to make any changes that 
are not well founded. 
  [SME] Why did the centrist parties--that is, your party and 
the followers of Moravcik and Cernak--not merge last weekend? 
The reasons for the failure to merge cited in the media 
included technical and legislative, but also other, personal, 
ones. What was the main problem? 
  [Knazko] These matters must be decided by the party's 
political bodies. I will clearly work toward the liberal, or 
right, center being formed by a single party that would be 
capable of representing a genuine counterbalance to other 
political entities. I do not consider having a number of small 
parties to be an optimal solution at present. I have discussed 
my ideas with Messrs. Cernak, Roman Kovac, and Moravcik, and we 
have essentially agreed that we will strive for unification. I 
think that differences in programs will be minimal, and we have 
also practically agreed on personnel issues. The merger between 
the AD SR and the followers of Moravcik will take place in the 
very near future. 
  [SME] And what about a merger with Cernak's party? 
  [Knazko] We will definitely remain open to this possibility. 
This will depend on the decision of Mr. Cernak and his party. 
Ludovit Cernak's statements to the effect that we do not want to 
build the new party any further than the district level or that 
we have only intellectuals at the top and no structures are 
imprecise and the result of a lack of information. It is 
self-evident that we have the ambition to build our political 
structures in the same way as any serious party. 
  [SME] Why then did the three parties not merge this weekend, 
as heralded one month ago? 
  [Knazko] We can still merge. This also depends on Mr. 
Cernak's interest in being represented in such a bloc with such 
an orientation and on his readiness to accept the fact that a 
person will become chairman of the center party who is the most 
acceptable from the viewpoint of objective criteria, from the 
viewpoint of the approaching elections, and from the viewpoint 
of the post he holds. 
  [SME] Do you think the parties of the center will actually 
merge or that they will merely form a preelection coalition? 
  [Knazko] The AD SR is contemplating a merger rather than a 
coalition. 
  [SME] Do you not think your failure to merge right away also 
with Cernak's group represents a wasted chance? 
  [Knazko] This is everyone's own decision, but it is a 
pity--for us but also for Mr. Cernak. I believe that the 
differences from the viewpoint of being oriented toward the 
European Democratic Union or the Liberal International are not 
such that they cannot be overcome. The differences between our 
programs will be equally minimal, so I regard this [separate 
existence of two parties] as a waste of energy and time. 
  [SME] You and the group around Jozef Moravcik define 
yourselves as a liberal entity. Mr. Cernak, on the other hand, 
said on Saturday [26 March] that "the new alternative cannot 
rest in boundless liberalism with its `dog eat dog' mentality." 
What kind of liberalism do you represent? 
  [Knazko] Nothing boundless has a place in contemporary 
society, only in an extreme one. We have already defined some 
liberal priorities--from the citizen, via the community, to the 
state, from courage for changes to support for the private 
sector. Those are our points of departure, in the implementation 
of which it is necessary to accept our social and economic 
reality. Our party operates within the context of the Liberal 
International. It is a waste of time to talk about 
boundlessness. Rather, we hould build firm boundaries and seek 
European contacts. 
  [SME] Right-wing parties, not to mention liberal-oriented 
ones, flopped in the last elections, plainly speaking. There is 
more and more talk about liberalism at present, yet the poll 
results do not support this. According to the preelection 
polls, the AD SR currently has the support of slightly over 1 
percent of voters, and Mr. Moravcik's group does not even figure 
in the polls. How do see the prospects for the liberal-oriented 
parties in the September elections? 
  [Knazko] I think this political orientation will stop being 
the isolated voice of individuals and tiny parties. I therefore 
expect much of the unification of persons and programs. I set 
great hopes in the membership base growing more numerous and 
being able, by virtue of the numbers, to assert liberal policies 
more effectively throughout Slovakia. There will also be far 
more visible political personalities representing this kind of 
policy. In my opinion, this is the result of a certain process 
that was perhaps inevitable. It started in the Public Against 
Violence movement [VPN] and continued, in part, in the Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. Through natural 
crystallization, a certain selection of political personalities 
took place who will be capable of representing liberal policies. 
And I have no doubt that this will also find its expression in 
public opinion polls--in a substantially increased percentage of 
electoral preferences. 
  [SME] Are you not afraid that the people associated in the 
AD SR and around Jozef Moravcik will be regarded by the people 
as HZDS defectors, who have nothing in common except their 
distaste for Vladimir Meciar? 
  [Knazko] No, not at all. This is a very simplified and 
demagogic perception of some commentators, by which I do not 
mean you. We all are defectors from totalitarianism, defectors 
from the VPN because, without them, the present party structures 
would not have been created. One of the reasons the HZDS was 
formed as a broad spectrum movement was to make it possible for 
new political parties to emerge from it. Some people have 
supposedly broken away from the HZDS and are now so-called 
defectors. I consider this, however, to be a very positive 
process that has not yet ended. Let us return to the defectors. 
Why use such pejorative terms? These are people whose political 
views have become crystallized thanks to HZDS policies. These 
so-called defectors underwent baptism by fire and were forced to 
defend their views, in defiance of HZDS methods. The HZDS 
played a positive role in this regard. 
  [SME] HZDS Deputy Chairwoman Olga Keltosova said on Saturday 
[26 March] that the movement wants to transform itself into a 
party of the "pragmatic center." In this context, she said 
that, personally, she prefers liberal values. How do you assess 
the possibility of the HZDS joining the Liberal International? 
  [Knazko] It does not matter who declares what. What matters 
is the kind of policy one actually practices. The HZDS has 
convinced me of many things, except that it prefers liberal 
values. That is the last thing that would occur to me. Had 
this been true, we all could have calmly remained in the HZDS.

  [Text] Alojz Englis, the president of the Confederation of 
Trade Unions, has sent a letter to Finance Minister Rudolf 
Filkus, drawing his attention to the violation of trade union 
freedoms as outlined in the accord of the International Labor 
Organization on the freedom of association and the protection of 
trade unions' right of association. In his letter, Alojz Englis 
stressed that the Finance Ministry fundamentally violated trade 
union rights by a decision calling on the trade unions that are 
members of the confederation to present their account books 
outlining their assets to appropriate tax bodies by 31 March. 
Englis pointed out that he will inform the international trade 
union headquarters about this, and, if the Finance Ministry does 
not change its stance, he will forward an official complaint to 
the International Labor Organization about the violation of 
trade union rights in Slovakia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jaroslav Basta, former deputy chief of </F>
intelligence and current chairman of the Independent Screening 
Commission, by Evzen Stanek; place and date not given: "KGB 
Launched Its Offensive"] 
  [Text] "Certain recent events indicate a very 
considerable offensive on the part of the Russian security 
forces. I consider also the affair with resident-agent Ames 
recently discovered in the ranks of the CIA to be evidence of 
this. I believe that his arrest was prompted by the Russians 
themselves." This was stated in an interview by Jaroslav Basta, 
former deputy chief of intelligence and current chairman of the 
Independent Screening Commission, who engages in the study of 
the development of secret services. "It is something similar to 
the Kozeny-Wallis affair, when Mr. Kozeny informed on Wallis in 
such a way that the case could no longer be processed by 
intelligence means but only by penal ones." 
  [Stanek] What does it have to do with the Czech Republic? 
  [Basta] According to the postwar statistics, the KGB had its 
"moles" in every security service. Under the circumstances 
existing in the Czech Republic since November 1989, it is 
completely impossible for someone like Ames not to sit in the 
Czech secret services. If the Czech secret service has not 
discovered any agent so far, it means either that we are an 
exception or that we are incapable of finding him. 
  [Stanek] What makes our small country so interesting for the 
KGB now? 
  [Basta] Intelligence services are working in anticipation. 
Their main task is to detect future dangers and possibilities. 
It is advantageous for Russia to be here if it has imperial 
aspirations, which has been demonstrated more than once. 
  Moreover, it is possible to have cover firms in the Czech 
Republic, or firms making money for espionage. In this context, 
I remember how Ames drew attention to himself--his expenses were 
higher than his income. It is customary in the United States to 
examine the financial situation of all government employees, and 
not just of the secret service staff. The common practice in 
the Czech Republic, on the other hand, is that only disagreeable 
people are checked. Hence, no one cares whether a prominent 
person purchased a Jaguar like Mr. Ames, or how much the house 
in which he lives cost. 
  [Stanek] Why would the Russians eliminate their own 
resident-agent? 
  [Basta] The KGB needs to improve its reputation. It is a 
part of the revival of the empire. I cannot but recall the 
words uttered by Zhirinovskiy as he burst in at the conference 
on the KGB in Moscow last May and attacked its participants for 
aggression against the KGB, which, in his opinion, belongs to 
the best tradition of the Russian empire and the Soviet Union. 
  By the "Ames action," the KGB immediately improved its 
reputation at home, because it demonstrated--look, the supreme 
boss of the U.S. counterintelligence against Russian 
intelligence was in fact our man; that is the kind of person we 
can recruit. Shortly thereafter, the Russians also came up with 
the exposure of the British spy. 
  [Stanek] Was it worth it to them? 
  [Basta] The Americans had suspected Ames for three years, 
which would present the possibility of Ames being recruited back 
to the U.S. side, or the Russians could have thought that this 
was in the works. As far as Ames's arrest goes, there was no 
need for FBI agents to go through the waste baskets. They could 
have foisted well-prepared disinformation upon him, for 
instance, and waited until it appeared on the Russian side. That 
would suffice for his condemnation. In the end, it was not the 
FBI but, rather, the Russians who won this discreet game. 
  [Stanek] Immediately after Ames was exposed, KGB head 
Golushko resigned, allegedly for health reasons. How do you 
feel about this? 
  [Basta] Although Russian intelligence officially disclosed 
that Golushko's resignation had nothing to do with the Ames 
affair, Nikolay Golushko is, after Vadim Bakatin, the second KGB 
head who came to the organization from without and had to leave. 
The similarity between their fates is also in their start 
following a failed coup. It seems that the immunity ability of 
the KGB and its successor organizations remains completely 
unhurt. If such a person as Golushko leaves, it does not mean 
anything good for our future. Every such event brings up the 
question of whether something like that is also possible here.

<F P=106> [Article by "km": "Czech Scientists Reportedly Never Tried </F>
To Develop Biological Weapons"] 
  [Text] Prague--The dangerous organisms that Czechoslovak 
scientists were studying in military establishments in the 
1970's and 1980's included, for example, the Muray Valley 
encephalitis virus, which originates in Australia; a virus 
called St. Louis encephalitis; bacteria of the Japanese B 
encephalitis, strain "schun" [word as published]; and the virus 
of the "murman" seal species. These microorganisms cause mainly 
inflammations of the meninges; they have a very severe clinical 
progression and a lethal conclusion. The former Soviet Union 
asked the former government for an analysis of the above 
microorganisms. 
  Czech scientists supposedly never worked with the most 
dangerous infections such as smallpox, pestilence, and anthrax. 
  According to Ales Macela, dean of scientific activity at the 
Jan Evangelista Purkyne Military Medical Academy in Hradec 
Kralove, conditions have never been established in the Czech 
Republic for the handling of genetic material of microorganisms 
or for the production of a larger quantity of microbes, which 
would have been necessary for the development and production of 
a biological weapon.

<F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta: "Viruses Kept by the Army Could </F>
Have Killed on a Large-Scale; Research Requested by Military 
Secret Services of the USSR"] 
  [Text] Prague--In the 1970's and 1980's, Czechoslovak 
scientists in military establishments studied several dozen 
particularly dangerous exotic viruses and bacteria that could be 
used as lethal bacteriological weapons. Their collection was 
liquidated by the Army, along with all common viruses such as 
influenza or mumps, only in February 1994. 
  The dangerous viruses and bacteria studied by Czechoslovak 
experts belonged to the group that mainly cause severe cases of 
meningitis. The military officials of the former Eastern bloc 
states were allegedly convinced that these organisms could be 
used by the enemy in the event of a bacteriological war. The 
military secret services of the former USSR therefore designated 
several dozen particularly dangerous microorganisms and 
recommended their research with the aim of creating serums for 
diagnostic and protective purposes. 
  Following the liquidation of the bank of virus strains, the 
Ministry of Defense was accused of having developed 
bacteriological weapons in its military establishments. The 
Army command, along with the Ministry of Health, denied this, 
however. The Ministry of Defense stated that the research 
involving those viruses was of a purely defensive nature. Some 
experts argue, however, that it is virtually impossible to 
distinguish between defensive and offensive research. 
  According to expert circles, it cannot be ruled out that the 
results of Czechoslovak studies could have been used by the 
Soviet Union for military purposes. This suspicion is confirmed 
by the recent admission of Anatoliy Kuntsevich, chief of the 
Russian presidential committee for chemical and biological 
weapons, who confirmed last September that, even though Moscow 
had signed the treaty on banning these weapons, the former USSR 
and, subsequently, Russia, continued to develop for 20 years 
bacteriological weapons and aircraft and missile systems for 
their transport.

<F P=106> [Interview with Czech Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr </F>
Vondra by Jiri Hrasek and Andrea Behounkova; place and date not 
given: "The Regime at the Czech-German Border Is Regulated by 
Treaties"] 
  [Text] Czech Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra 
and Dieter Kastrup, state secretary at the FRG Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, met in Prague at the beginning of last week 
[22-23 March] to discuss the Czech-German border regime. We 
asked Alexandr Vondra for details. 
  [CESKY DENIK] Deputy Minister, have there been any 
agreements signed yet to regulate the local borderland traffic 
[maly pohranicni styk] and the state-border problems? 
  [Vondra] Not so far. Both agreements were discussed at the 
expert level. In the instance of the so-called large-scale 
border treaty, the Czech Government already expressed its 
approval of the text, and all that is left to do is to decide by 
whom, where, and when the agreement will be signed. The 
agreement on the local borderland traffic that deals, above all, 
with the problem of tourist zones and paths crossing the common 
border is almost finished, and only some technical details must 
still be approved. 
  [CESKY DENIK] How will the joint clearance at the border be 
expedited? 
  [Vondra] The treaty on the simplification of the border 
clearance in railroad, highway, and water transport between the 
Czech Republic and the FRG is almost finished. The treaty 
assumes the establishment of joint clearance facilities for the 
customs and passport control on either side of the border. A 
gradual increase in the number of border crossings also 
contributes to expediting the border clearance between the two 
countries. 
  [CESKY DENIK] Will the regime be altered at the state border 
in connection with complaints from the German side concerning 
criminal activities, for instance, by Czech citizens on the 
German side? 
  [Vondra] The regime at our common border will be defined in 
detail by the aforementioned treaty regulations. The treaty on 
cooperation in the struggle against organized crime, which was 
signed already in 1991, deals with the eradication of crime 
transgressing the border. The effectiveness of the detection 
and punishment of crime is improved also, for instance, by the 
possibility of direct contact between the Bavarian and the Czech 
police. An intergovernment agreement on cooperation of police 
bodies is also in the works. 
  [CESKY DENIK] Has there been any discussion regarding the 
use of names of communities in two languages? 
  [Vondra] After the latest talks with Dieter Kastrup, state 
secretary at the FRG Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it seems that 
a solution to this controversial problem was found that is 
acceptable to both sides. I expect that, following the 
appropriate internal talks on both sides, the problem of using 
local names in joint documents will be definitively solved. At 
this time, I do not wish to discuss the details of the solution.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Lubor Kohout: "Ministry of Defense Full of </F>
Beetles"] 
  [Text] In a large housing estate in Prague, there is a 
supermarket. Not only is it the only supermarket, but there 
also does not exist any building lot where a second supermarket 
could be built. There is not even room for small shops. The 
owner rents out the supermarket to its manager. Naturally, they 
conclude a lease contract. The contract concerns only the 
building in which the supermarket is located. The former 
manager of the supermarket thus becomes its lessee. The owner 
lets him keep all of the furnishings, some of which are older 
and some brand new, without asking anything for it. That is not 
all, however. Out of sheer goodness, he leaves in the 
supermarket all of the merchandise plus a full warehouse. The 
only thing the new lessee must do is hire shop assistants and 
start selling. For a while, he does not even have to buy new 
stock, of which he had received enough. 
  The owner does not ask anything for it. He does not even 
have 
an idea how many millions or tens of millions [currency not 
specified] worth of merchandise he had donated to his former 
employee in this way. Nonsense? No, this is the style of the 
Army's economic management, only transferred into a different 
environment. 
  This is exactly how the Ministry of Defense proceeds in 
relation to the Klinlab limited liability company (just a little 
reminder: this is the company that had administered those 
innocuous virus strains that were hastily destroyed on 25 
February of this year). First, on 10 September 1993, the 
Municipal Military Accommodation Administration signs a lease 
contract with a still nonexistent company, which is signed on 
behalf of Klinlab by Army members Moravek, MD, and Choluj, MD, 
as Klinlab's statutory representatives and managing directors. 
At the same time, these gentlemen collect from the Army a 
lump-sum payment as compensation for not being engaged in 
private enterprise. Only a month later, on 21 October, the 
Klinlab partnership agreement is signed, and, another 11 days 
later, Klinlab is registered by the Municipal District Court in 
Prague-1. Certain activities are then set apart from the 
Central Military Medical Institute and transferred to Klinlab. 
<H5>  Through Loss Toward Savings? </H5>
  However, the Army, whose motive for the entire operation, 
according to M. Kalousek, deputy minister of defense in charge 
of economic affairs, is to achieve savings in its budget, 
transfers to the private company Klinlab only those activities 
that were well established, lucrative, and profitable, such as 
diagnostics. Activities that are loss-making and that the 
ministry must continue to subsidize are left in its own 
facility, the Central Military Medical Institute. From the 
viewpoint of the private company Klinlab, this sounds logical. 
Why should anyone rush into a business that will cost him 
money? It is less logical, however, from the viewpoint of the 
"cost-conscious" Army. 
<H5>  Setting the Wolf To Mind the Sheep? </H5>
  At an extraordinary news conference on 19 March, M. Kalousek 
even claimed that the Ministry of Defense would save 50 million 
korunas [Kc] a year thanks to Klinlab. This amount is 
equivalent to the annual overhead expenses of the entire former 
Central Military Medical Institute. It is peculiar that a 
deputy minister in charge of economic affairs operates with sums 
that include only expenditures and disregard revenues, such as 
payments from the Military Health Insurance for medical services 
performed, and so forth. He also "forgot" to mention that the 
Ministry of Defense must continue to subsidize the nonprofitable 
activities of the Central Military Medical Institute. In 
substantiating the savings, Deputy Minister Kalousek thus 
evidently did not speak the truth, the opposite of which is 
called a lie. Klinlab has thus taken over from the institute 
well-established activities, clients, and, within the framework 
of the UVN [possibly Ustredni Vojenska Nemocnice, Central 
Military Hospital], also a monopoly position. What did it pay 
for it? Nothing. It only concluded a contract on the lease of 
the six-storey building and undertook to pay annual rent of 
Kc760,123. Furthermore, the Army "leased to it free of charge" 
the appliances and equipment. True, the appliances and 
equipment have been leased for a definite period only. However, 
this definite period is defined very shrewdly. The formulation 
reads: "until a proper lease contract is concluded." The lease 
is set to begin on 23 December 1993. Apart from this, just like 
in the fictitious supermarket, the Ministry of Defense has left 
the working stock at Klinlab's disposal. Was this stock worth 
millions or tens of millions? Who cares? A pleasant way of 
starting a business, is it not? 
<H5>  Good Personal Relations </H5>
  It is worth noting that, naturally, there was no 
competition. 
Another physician, an emigre who has returned from Canada, also 
showed interest in the privatization of the complex, a part of 
which was subsequently acquired by Klinlab, at the beginning of 
last year. He was told that these activities could not be 
privatized. In their analysis, the gentlemen from Klinlab also 
mention the reasons because of which the lucrative activities 
should be transferred to them. Apart from the "traditionally 
good personal relations" (between Moravek, Choluj, and the 
management of the Army's medical service), they also emphasize 
the fact that, when they acquire these activities, the entry of 
foreign capital will be prevented. Quite so. But did they not 
get the time wrong? And are the economic section of the 
Ministry of Defense and Deputy Minister Kalousek not getting it 
wrong? 
  The beetle is lying on its back and does not react to 
prodding. You prod again but nothing happens. So you prod even 
more strongly, but the beetle still does not move. Could it be 
dead? The beetle perhaps, but Defense Minister Antonin Baudys 
is unquestionably very much alive, and still he does not react. 
Did he choose to act like a dead beetle?

  [Text] Neither Poland nor Russia can be moved to America. 
We are forced to depend on each other. This is the title the 
MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI has given to an interview with President 
Lech Walesa. 
  [Correspondent Andrzej Siezeniewski] Speaking of the tasks 
of 
politicians in shaping bilateral relations, the Polish president 
stressed that, in the first instance, they ought to remove 
barriers and open opportunities for contacts for industrialists 
and businessmen and constantly repeat to them: Gentlemen, it 
will always be shorter from Moscow to Warsaw than to Washington. 
That is why Poland is a better partner than the United States. 
  Asked whether his hopes of help from the West had been 
fulfilled, Lech Walesa gave an unequivocally negative answer. 
History proves, he stressed, that one cannot seriously count on 
support from that direction. Apart from promises, we have 
received nothing. The West does not understand what is 
happening in our part of the world, said the Polish president. 
It does not treat us as partners. It acts only when it sees 
some profit in it for itself. 
  President Walesa spoke against dividing the world into 
blocs. 
The times when that was how things were are disappearing into 
the past. For that reason, Poland or Ukraine will not be 
playing the part of sanitary corridors separating the giants of 
Europe: Russia and Germany. 
  Lech Walesa is also against the concentration of troops in, 
for example, the Kaliningrad oblast. If we all say that we do 
not see each other as enemies, why make such gestures, 
underlined the Polish president. 
  It is his conviction that we should aim at building a system 
of pan-European security, which would give all nations of the 
continent equal guarantees of a peaceful life.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Michailo Markovic, vice chairman </F>
of the Socialist Party of Serbia and identified as President 
Milosevic's "leading adviser," by Karin Veraart in Belgrade; 
date not given: "Greater Serbia Is Not on the Agenda Just Yet 
-- Adviser To Milosevic Thinks Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia 
Should Go Their Own Way"] 
  [Text] Belgrade -- Two years ago Serbian philosopher 
Michailo Markovic joined President Slobodan Milosevic's SPS 
[Socialist Party of Serbia]. Since then Markovic has become 
vice chairman and leads the SPS's think-tank. He is the party's 
ideologue and regarded as the most important adviser to the 
Serbian leader. Now Serbia has to mark time for a while in its 
goal of a Greater Serbia, the professor said. 
  "The time has come for us to turn to the status quo," 
Markovic said. "That meant," he said, ``that Serbia should not 
regard uniting areas of Croatia and Bosnia inhabited by a 
Serbian majority with the Serbian `motherland' as the highest 
priority. 
  "The Serbian republic of Krajina in Croatia and the Srpska 
republic in Bosnia, as their leaders have baptised their 
unrecognized states, could develop a very good independent 
existence," Markovic said. "With economic links with Serbia of 
course and also with neighboring counties," he said. "That is 
the goal in the first instance. In the end, and that could last 
a very long time, a decision must be made about their definitive 
political status, or about a possible unification of the Serbian 
areas." 
  As a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and the 
Committee for National Questions, Markovic is working on a 
memorandum "which defines the most important objectives for 
Serbian national policies," he said. "My colleague Anton 
Razmazic and I have virtually finished the draft version. It is 
a sort of guideline, advice to the party leadership for a 
national program." 
  The memorandum lists the fundamental interests of the 
Serbian 
people. "At present the most important things are peace and the 
right to self-determination in the areas where Serbs are in the 
majority," Markovic said. "Referendums should be held at a 
local level in Bosnia and Krajina," Markovic said, "so that the 
people could itself decide whether it wanted to be part of the 
Serbian area or preferred to belong elsewhere." 
  "If Krajina voted for reintegration with Croatia, something 
which the international community is pushing for, then Serbia 
would not oppose that in any way," Markovic said, but he "was 
certain" that Krajina did not want this at all. However, in 
recent weeks the leadership of Krajina in Knin have been put 
under heavy pressure by the international mediators, the United 
States and Russia, but little support has been seen from 
Belgrade. Both the SPS and the opposition parties are leaving 
their options open. A large flow of rumors has been set off, 
according to which the Serbian leader wants to give Krajina to 
Croatia in return for the lifting of international sanctions. 
The independent papers in Belgrade published photomontages of 
Milosevic and Tudjman in bed together this week. 
  Markovic grinned. "I know these rumors are going round in 
the West," he said, rejecting the reference to the Serbian 
media. "But you should understand two things," he said. "Point 
one: Milosevic is a man of few words, he does not feel such a 
strong need to talk to the press. He sees no reason to 
endlessly repeat himself. Believe me, Knin knows that it is 
guaranteed Serbian support. In recent days I toured villages in 
the region and I once again told people that Serbia is behind 
them. Should Croatia try to take Krajina using military force, 
that would mean war by 10 million Serbs again four million 
Croats." 
  But things would not reach that point, Markovic thought. "In 
fact Croatia can never get together enough people who want to 
fight," he said. "Should a few extremist groups want to try it 
nevertheless, then Krajina can deal with that itself. In that 
way Split and Zagreb would be wiped off the map." 
  But would Milosevic finally bend under the pressure of the 
economic sanctions and nevertheless advise Knin to give up the 
search for independence? "That is the second point that the 
West should now understand," he said. "Serbia will not bend 
before sanctions. Unlike Croatia, which has allowed itself to 
be forced into that peculiar confederation agreement at the 
moment when an embargo was about to be installed because of 
involvement in the fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  Markovic has his own opinion of the latest peace plans -- 
Germany is behind them. "Germany is the biggest financier of the 
Croats, but war is expensive," he said. "Also Croatia did not 
have great perspectives in the fighting and Germany wanted to 
prevent a Muslim state being founded in Europe. On the other 
hand, a plausible solution had to be found for the Muslim 
question, because they and their brothers in the rest of the 
world represent a great interest for both Europe and the United 
States: oil." 
  "This reasoning was picked up by the United States, which 
wanted to show that Europe is not able to solve the conflict in 
the Balkans without U.S. intervention," he said. "Result: The 
Washington agreement of 18 March, when the Croats and Muslims 
decided to form a federation in Bosnia, possibly to be expanded 
later into a confederation with Croatia." 
  "This agreement would never be completed," Markovic said. 
"The people do not want to live together at all," he said. 
"Heavy fighting is still taking place now. What ever the case, 
Serbia still wants to negotiate and make a few territorial 
concessions, but there can be no possibility of forming part of 
a union with the other parties." 
  And what would happen if the country which had defended 
Serbian interests up to a certain point started to stir? 
  "Russia will never go so far as to force us into an 
agreement 
against our will," he said. "Kozyrev might want to do that, but 
he could not sell that to his rank and file." Markovic sighed. 
"For Serbia it would be better if someone like Rutskoy, for 
example, came to power. The present Russian leadership is too 
keen on a good understanding with the United States."

  [Text] Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] President Kiro Gligorov received yesterday 
U.S. Chief of Joint Staff General John Shalikashvili. The 
meeting was also attended by Foreign Minister Crvenkovski and 
Defense Minister Popovski. They expressed satisfaction with the 
role of the U.S. contingent serving as members of UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] in Macedonia thus far, and discussed 
replacing the Nordic contingent with another American unit. 
They also exchanged ideas on the situation in the region and 
President Gligorov stressed the importance of resolving the 
Greek-Macedonian dispute, saying it could destabilize the south 
of the Balkans. Gligorov again actualized Macedonia's request to 
be included in the project "Partnership for Peace." 
  General Shalikashvili pointed out his country's interest in 
a 
stable Macedonia as an exceptionally significant factor of 
stability in the Balkans. He also announced appointment of U.S. 
Army representative to Macedonia in the near future. 
  General Shalikashvili also visited U.S. soldiers in 
Macedonia 
and patrol units on the Macedonian-Serbian border.

<F P=106> [Article by Victoria Stegic] </F>
  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 1 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs shelled 
the beleagured enclave of Gorazde again Friday [1 April] in one 
of several Serb attacks on Moslem pockets amid growing evidence 
of a new wave of ethnic cleansing, UN officials said. 
  Rob Annink, spokesman for the United Nations Protection 
Force 
(UNPROFOR) said the situation in Goradze in eastern Bosnia 
remained tense, hours after Bosnian sources said the death toll 
from bombardments Wednesday and Thursday had reached at least 
30, with around 100 wounded. 
  Major Annink said UN observers counted 21 shells early 
Friday 
falling on the enclave, only hours after the Bosnian government 
urged the UN to protect Gorazde in line with the enclave's 
status as one of six UN-designated "safe havens." [passage 
omitted] 
  Meanwhile a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) expressed alarm over the safety of Moslems in 
the northern Banja Luka region. Spokesman Kris Janovski said at 
least seven civilians had been killed there in recent days, 
apparently in revenge attacks sparked after the corpses of seven 
Serb policemen killed on the front lines were brought back to 
the town. He added that the UNHCR had only sketchy details of 
the deaths, which were reported by acquaintances of the victims 
and confirmed by Banja Luka's Moslem humanitarian association, 
Merhamet. 
  Janovski also cited evidence of a fresh wave of ethnic 
cleansing by Serbs in Sanski Most, 30 kilometres (18 miles) from 
Banja Luka. Under the pretext that Moslem houses are too large 
for their occupants, Serb police in the town are forcibly 
installing Serb families in their place, he said. The tactic has 
emerged amid an influx of Serb refugees into the Banja Luka 
region from north and central Bosnian frontline towns, notably 
Maglaj, Zepce and Zenica. Janovski said more than 850 Serbs had 
entered the region as refugees in the last three months. 
  On Thursday, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said he had 
proof that around 300 Moslems and between 150 and 200 Bosnian 
Croats were being forcibly expelled from Banja Luka every day. 
Izetbegovic charged that the UNHCR and UN peacekeepers were 
helping the evacuation of Moslems and Croats "instead of 
guaranteeing their security," and called on both communities not 
to "give way to terror" and to remain in their homes. 
  Meanwhile Annink said violent fighting had broken out in the 
northern Maglaj pocket, with infantry clashes and heavy Serb 
shelling Thursday near Tesanj, 10 kilometres (six miles) from 
the town. [passage omitted] Annink said 84 Serb shells landed 
on the pocket Thursday, while its Moslem defenders riposted with 
eight projectiles. 
  A British UN armed vehicle which skirted frontlines after a 
navigation error came under fire from Serb artillery but was not 
hit, the spokesman said. A total of 13 Serb shells also fell on 
Zenica, Travnik and Turbe, central Bosnia, Thursday. Annink 
added that a Bosnian army liaison officer was hit by Croat 
sniper fire in the southern city of Mostar, in violation of 
peace accords sealed Wednesday with the creation of the 
Moslem-Bosnian Croat federation in Bosnia. 
  UNPROFOR also reported serious violations of the Sarajevo 
ceasefire Thursday, during which one government soldier was 
wounded. 
  Separately, Annink said that the UN's new civil adminstrator 
for the Bosnian capital, US diplomat William Eagleton, was due 
to arrive in the city late Monday. Appointed under UN Security 
Council resolutions adopted last month, Eagleton's brief is to 
oversee the rebirth of Sarajevo's shattered public services.

  [Text] Zagreb, March 31 (AFP) -- The United Nations 
Protection Force in Croatia needs 2,000 additional troops to 
enforce the ceasefire between Serb separatists and the Croatian 
army, deputy UNPROFOR commander General John MacInnis said 
Thursday [31 March]. 
  The UN peacekeepers were "virtually prepared" to take up 
positions between the antagonists in line with the ceasefire 
accord signed here Wednesday which comes into effect at 0700 GMT 
next Monday, the Canadian general said. 
  Under the deal the two sides will withdraw their forces and 
heavy weapons along the confrontation line between the two 
forces: the Croatian army and Serb separatists who have 
proclaimed their own "Serb republic of Krajina" [RSK] on one 
third of Croatian territory. Mortars are to be withdrawn 10 
kilometres (six miles) and artillery 20 kilometres (12 miles) 
from the confrontation lines by Monday at 0700 GMT, while the 
opposing forces are to move back one kilometre by next Friday at 
0700 GMT, creating a two-kilometre buffer zone in which the UN 
forces will enforce the ceasefire. "We are a little short of 
resources, but our plans are taking this into account, we are 
aware of sensitive areas and we will concentrate our efforts on 
those sensitive areas," MacInnis said. 
  UNPROFOR will redeploy forces currently elsewhere, notably 
Belgian and Jordanian troops temporarily withdrawn from Croatia 
to implement the ceasefire in Sarajevo. The 400 Russian 
paratroopers sent to Sarajevo from Klisa in eastern Croatia 
"will remain in Bosnia." The additional resources needed in 
Croatia -- where 15,000 peacekeepers are already deployed -- 
amount to four mechanised infantry companies, a mechanised 
infantry battalion comprising 1,000 men, four engineering 
companies comprising 600 men and a squadron of six helicopters 
comprising 200 men, UNPROFOR spokesman Matthew Nerzig said. 
  "The first difficult task will be... transforming what was 
written on the map to precise locations on the ground, the 
establishment of our joint (Serb-Croatian) commissions which 
will have the task of confirming on the ground precisely where 
those lines of separation are to be... a difficult if not 
impossible task," MacInnis said. The commissions are also to 
determine the number of Serb and Croatian police who under the 
accord are to be deployed in limited numbers between the two 
"separation lines." "We will have to go over the area point by 
point, village by village, town by town in order to determine 
the police presence for those areas. It's going to be a lot of 
hard work," he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Gyorgy </F>
Jozsef Farkas; place and date not given: "A Solution to the 
Problems on a Rational Basis"] 
  [Text] The Bratislava weekly SLOBODNY PIATOK organized a 
meeting between Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik and 13 
journalists. Our correspondent represented the Hungarian press 
at this meeting that lasted more than one hour and that was also 
recorded by Slovak Television. We publish here Jozef Moravcik's 
answers to our correspondent's questions. 
  [Farkas] Mr. Moravcik! Elections are scheduled in Slovakia 
in September, but the new Hungarian parliament will be elected 
in May. Do you still see any possibility of developing 
cooperation with the current Hungarian leadership? 
  [Moravcik] From Bratislava, at first sight it seems that the 
current leadership in Budapest is not particularly worried about 
the coming elections. We are not dealing with the timing of the 
Hungarian elections, either, because we are regarding our 
relations in broader aspects. However, we are aware of the fact 
that diplomatic actions are in preparation in Europe that could 
also be used well in shaping the relations between our 
countries. I mean the coming Paris conference. No doubt, we 
would both benefit if we could solve our problems without 
outside assistance like the International Court, and if we 
succeeded in preventing phenomena that lead to instability. 
This requires the creation of foundations that facilitate a 
more rational solution of our problems. We are ready to take 
such a step anytime. 
  [Farkas] Do you see any possibility for Hungarian Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszenszy to carry out his visit that was 
postponed in November 1993? 
  [Moravcik] When I was foreign minister, we confirmed, 
together with my Hungarian colleague, that the aforementioned 
visit was to the benefit of both of us. However, as you know, 
the problem of the extradition agreement emerged at the time. I 
am convinced that we will overcome this obstacle that hinders 
this visit, and the planned visits will take place. We are also 
interested in opening new border-crossing points, and the 
Slovak-Hungarian border is no exception to this, although there 
are a lot more crossing points along this border than along our 
other borders. However, our relations are specific, and, thus, 
the solutions must also be specific. We are ready to open 
further crossing points. 
  [Farkas] The economy can play an important role in our 
cooperation. However, your predecessor, Mr. Meciar, objected to 
the fact that Hungarian capital allegedly had an exaggerated 
presence in southern Slovakia. 
  [Moravcik] It is generally useless to limit the inflow of 
capital, and this particularly applies to Slovakia, which is 
only a small piece of land in Europe. Besides, capital is 
increasingly becoming international, and it is increasingly 
hopeless to look for national features on it. Therefore, I find 
it totally useless to seek ethnic features in the flow of 
capital. 
  [Farkas] In conclusion, a question about the distribution of 
the Danube waters. The European Union submitted a separate note 
to your predecessor, but Mr. Meciar's answer is not known. Is 
it possible that it will be your government's task to answer it? 
If so, what can we expect? 
  [Moravcik] Actually, there was no talk of any obligation to 
answer this note because it summed up the position of the 
European Union for the Slovak Government. As for the 
distribution of water itself, I regard this primarily as a 
technical problem, and I agree with Mr. Jeszenszky that, given 
the fact that this is a technical problem, we should tackle the 
problem accordingly.

  [Text] Tirana, March 31 (ATA) -- The Italian aid was not a 
property of the Albanian state but of the Italian one, Perparim 
Sanxhaku, the Nano's defence attorney said at yesterday's 
session in Tirana. 
  Mr. Sanxhaku called "groundless" the charge on the defendant 
Nano. Opposing the evidence presented at the court by the 
prosecutors, Mr. Sanxhaku said the Levante Co. have been chosen 
by the Italian side and not by Fatos Nano. Further on, Mr. 
Sanxhaku read the main indications of contracts and invoices 
related to the Italian aid. Attorney Sanxhaku said that the 
partial knowledge with minutes of the investigation and the 
short time at their disposal have not have made it impossible 
for him to fully defence his client. At these circumstances, 
Mr. Sanxhaku said "it is impossible for me to ask the innocence 
or guiltiness for my client." 
  While Agim Tirana, the other Nano's attorney, tried to use 
two testimonies made in the trial in favour of Defendant Nano. 
  The former premier Nano considering himself outside the 
process by adopting the same stand toward the court, said the 
charges against him have political motives. He said nothing 
about the falsification of official documents and 
misappropriation of the Italian aid for Albania. 
  The other three codefendants, Sokrat Plaka, former deputy 
foreign minister, Robert Gjini, former secretary general at the 
Ministry for Foreign Economic Trade and Relations, and Hasan 
Hallko, former director of the Food Department at the ministry, 
declared they were innocent and the procedure followed so far 
has been unjust. 
  At the end, the court will hand down its final decision on 
April 3, 1994.

  [Text] Sofia, March 31 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov is in a very good condition and is likely to leave the 
hospital in 8 to 15 day's time, journalists learned from 
Military Medical Academy (MMA) Chief Colonel Prof. Milan Petrov. 
The prime minister is currently undergoing a rehabilitation 
treatment at one of the MMA hospitals after a cardiac operation 
some two weeks ago. According to a medical commission, Prof. 
Berov could be back to work any time he wants, the MMA Chief 
also told the briefing. The operation improved the circulation 
of blood through the heart by 80 per cent and increased the 
working capacity of Prof. Berov, MMA Chief told journalists. 
  The Military Hospital, later transformed into Military 
Medical Institute with the MMA, was the first Bulgarian hospital 
to perform a cardiac operation, Prof. Petrov recalled. The MMA 
experts are currently preparing for kidney transplantation 
operations. The first medulla transplantation is scheduled for 
next spring and a special MMA laboratory has already been 
equipped to this end.

<F P=106> ["Finance Minister: Public Property Should Be Privatized, </F>
Be It Dirty Cheap" -- BTA headline] 
  [Text] Sofia, March 30 (BTA) -- 1994 should be the year of 
Bulgaria's structural adjustment based on privatization, Finance 
Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov today told a news conference on 
"Privatization, Investments and International Financial 
Cooperation" organized by the Hanns Seidel Stiftung Foundation 
of Germany. The Bulgarian finance minister also said that 
without foreign investments this country would hardly solve most 
of the problems it is facing. 
  The privatization is dragging because of the existing 
legislative obstacles; because of the psychological barrier 
raised by the bad image the private sector in this country has 
created for itself; because of the fears from a large-scale 
privatization which people expect to create job redundancies and 
reallocations; because of the end of the "calm life" Bulgarians 
have been enjoying until very recently. Yet another factor is 
the discrepancy between the character of mass privatization and 
the insolvency of buyers, according to Mr. Aleksandrov. 
  "The concentration of capital brought about a polarization 
of 
society. The funds accumulated are either being used 
ineffectively -- the law provides for tax concessions for stock 
purchasing -- or invested in the setting up of new commercial 
banks and banks with already existing financial groupings. The 
bulk of the Bulgarian companies have overseas headquarters which 
means that Bulgarian capitals are being exported abroad," the 
Bulgarian finance minister also said. According to him, the 
economic groupings have no interests in privatization. "They 
bleed the public sector white and are in control of both the 
input and the output of the state-owned companies," he went on 
to say. 
  Mr. Aleksandrov pointed the lack of interest on the part of 
foreign investors as another reason for the belated 
privatization in this country. This lack of interest mirrors 
both the political and the economic instability in Bulgaria; the 
lack of adequate infrastructure; the legislative imperfections; 
the financial isolation of this country following the March 1990 
moratorium on interest rate payments to the foreign creditors 
declared by the then-Bulgarian government. Finance Minister 
Aleksandrov also said that none of the cabinets that have been 
in office has managed to create the preconditions necessary to 
get privatization going. According to him, the international 
financial institutions, too, did not make use of their powers to 
press for a speedy privatization. 
  The future success of privatization would entail amendment 
of 
the privatization law, adoption of a mass privatization scheme 
and revision of the effective legislation to make the commercial 
banks share in denationalization, the finance minister also told 
journalists. He went on to say that the ministries should be 
authorized to privatize units of the respective sectors, 
estimated at over 10 million leva and do away with the monopoly 
the Privatization Agency has on deals of this kind. The trade 
unions' say in privatization, too, should be curtailed to 
prevent the creating of a hostile atmosphere, according to Mr. 
Aleksandrov. He also said that the settlement of the bad debts, 
which has yet to be done, should have been accomplished back in 
1991, when it would have taken less money. Now the bad debts to 
be transformed into a public debt amount to 100,000 million 
leva-plus, Mr. Aleksandrov said. 
  The settlement of the bad debts will financially 
rehabilitate 
the commercial banks, clear their portfolios and, though 
temporarily, help enterprises. The major benefit of this 
operation is the possibility to swap the 100,000 million leva 
government bonds to be issued for property. The absence of 
security market in Bulgaria places a stumbling block for the 
trade with this particular type of bonds. Under a cabinet 
decision, they will be sold at a market price and swapped at 
their book value, the finance minister further specified. 
Enterprises can also be privatized through selling them to the 
employees on lease. Mr. Aleksandrov did not rule out the 
possibility for some companies to face bankruptcy during 
privatization. About 200 companies are expected to declare 
bankruptcy by year's end, the finance minister said. Industry 
Minister Rumen Bikov in early April is expected to submit a list 
of 35 companies to go bankrupt, he also said. 
  "The public property is not longer viable and it should be 
privatized, be it dirty cheap. Privatization will revive 
Bulgaria's economy and the swapping of the bonds will bring 
budget expenditures down. The democratic process here is 
irreversible. This country boasts an exceptional geo-strategic 
situation and what it needs is a political stabilization which 
will speed up the reforms," Mr. Aleksandrov concluded.

  [Text] Sofia, April 1 (BTA) -- After a four-day protest, 
newspapers' publication was resumed today. Some compensate 
their temporary suspension by larger volume. The Sofia dailies, 
as well as most provincial ones, did not come out for four days 
in protest against the value-added tax introduced as of April 1, 
which newsmen call a "killer-tax" that will ruin the Bulgarian 
press and book publishing. A bill exempting the media from VAT 
is expected to be included as item No. 1 in today's agenda of 
parliament.

  [Text] Sofia, April 1 (BTA) -- Debates started in 
parliament on bills of amendments (demanded by the leading 
national dailies) to the Value Added Tax [VAT] Act which is 
coming into effect today. However, the bill was not put to the 
vote, as the sitting was closed for lack of quorum. 
  Two bills were moved, one by the MP's of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party (BSP) Yuri Borisov and Ivo Atanasov, and one by 
the MP of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) Lyubomir Pavlov. 
Under the "Borisov-Atanasov Bill" Bulgarian scientific and 
fiction books and non-porn newspapers would be exempted from the 
18 percent VAT for a period of three years. Under the "Pavlov 
Bill" exemption extends over advertisements as well. 
  The observations of the parliamentary committees on both 
bills were presented at the plenary sitting. The Radio and 
Television Committee and the Culture Committee support both 
bills. The Economic Committee supports the "Borisov-Atanasov 
Bill". According to the Budget and Finance Committee, the 
government alone has the right to initiate legislation where 
budget-related acts are concerned. It offers a compromise: To 
exempt the distribution and sale of newspapers and possibly of 
magazines and Bulgarian books from VAT by the end of this year 
but to charge further the present 10 per cent turnover tax. 
According to the Legislative Committee, the bills are not in 
contradiction with the constitution and the principles of the 
legal system. However, it maintains that the passage of 
amendments to an act which has not even come into effect as yet, 
is no contribution to the stability of the legislative system. 
  Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov who attended the sitting 
said he was not convinced that the demanded amendments were in 
the interest of the reading public. He pointed out that the 
real rise in the prices of published material with the 
introduction of VAT should not exceed 7 percent. 
  Yesterday the editors-in-chief and the publishers of the 
leading newspapers presented their demands to the National 
Assembly. They insist that the mass media, advertisements in 
them, Bulgarian books, trade in newsprint and ink for the 
periodicals and for book printing, and printing services be all 
exempted from VAT. 
  The leading national dailies staged a four-day boycott 
(Monday- Thursday) in protest against the newly introduced tax. 
On Monday [28 March] and Tuesday [29 March] the six private 
radio stations did not broadcast. They were back on the air 
Wednesday [30 March] but aired several minutes of noise effects 
every hour. Local newspapers and radiostations protested as 
well. A protest procession of Bulgarian intellectuals -- 
writers, journalists, publishers and book distributors -- was 
held Wednesday.

  [Text] Semily, East Bohemia, March 31 (CTK) -- If he had 
not had to negotiate the division of the federation with Slovak 
ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar every other day just at the time when 
the constitution was being approved, he would never have allowed 
the Senate to be anchored in the constitution, Premier Vaclav 
Klaus said this evening. 
  Klaus was speaking after a public meeting of the Civic 
Democratic Party (ODS), of which he is chairman. 
  ODS Executive Chairman Petr Cermak added that "after the 
next 
parliamentary elections parliament will come to believe that 
rather than have a bad Senate, it will be easier to take the 
Senate out of the constitution." The attempt to fill the Senate 
completely in the first senatorial elections he called "an 
attempt to turn round the results of the last elections, an 
attempt to gain greater television exposure." 
  A bill which would amend the method of voting for senators 
is 
now the subject of controversy among the coalition partners. At 
today's meeting of coalition party experts to consider the 
voting laws, ODS representatives stood by their party's original 
opinion, that the forthcoming senatorial elections should take 
place in only a third of 81 constituencies. Deputy Radim Spacek 
(Civic Democratic Alliance, ODA) said that Friday's compromise 
proposal on the method of elections to the Senate had been 
"decreed" by a member of the ODS, Deputy Petr Bachna. 
  This suggestion, Spacek told journalists today, consisted of 
27 constituencies electing three senators each, with 
limited-period mandates, with everybody being able to take part 
in individual voting periods.

  [Text] Prague, March 31 (CTK) -- Relevant ministers, who 
met to discuss the Czech arms industry and its transformation, 
have decided to divide long-term defense contracts into two 
groups according to their importance to the state, Premier 
Vaclav Klaus said today. 
  Within six months, the Ministry of Defense will work out a 
proposal describing its expected contracts with Czech arms 
producers. One group of items will contain those with direct 
effect on the country's security interests. The other defined 
group will involve less government attention, Klaus said. 
  He noted that the state does not plan to organize arms 
exports. It will simply ensure that competition in the arms 
industry is not lessened, and that no laws are broken. 
  Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said before the ministers' 
meeting that Czech companies will be allowed to participate in 
the country's arms conversion process according to their 
abilities. Discussions with them will start once the ministry 
has drawn up its proposal. 
  Arms conversion in the Czech Republic could be carried out 
over five to ten years, Baudys noted. 
  Most important, said Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr 
Vondra, 
is for the Czech armed forces to state their modernization needs 
and for the state to be ready to cooperate with arms producers. 
  The issue of re-equipping is not the only path to 
compatibility with NATO, he added.

  [Text] Prague, March 31 (CTK) -- Top bodies of the 
Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia [KSCM] have assumed a 
totally confrontational policy which practically deprives them 
of any possibility of constructive dialogue with other left-wing 
parties, Left Bloc Party (SLB) Chairwoman Marie Stiborova told 
journalists today. 
  She was reacting to remarks made by KSCM Chairman Miroslav 
Grebenicek during the KSCM Central Committee meeting on last 
Saturday [26 March] in which he said, among other things, that 
SLB and the People's National and Social Salvation Union 
(LUNSZ), led by the pre-November 1989 Czechoslovak Communist 
Party Prague branch chairman Miroslav Stepan, tried to feed on 
KSCM structures. 
  The Czechoslovak Communist Party was disbanded in April 
1992. 
  In view of last weekend's meeting of the Democratic Left 
Party (SDL) National Council, which decided against sharing an 
election staff with the SLB, the two parties will form a common 
election coordination council. 
  The SLB Central Committee, scheduled to meet on April 8, is 
to discuss the creation of an election staff. 
  "We see the elections as being based on the civic principle. 
We are also aware that in many places, people have asked that 
the left insist on its candidates having adequate 
qualifications," Stiborova said.

  [Text] Prague, March 31 (CTK) -- Most Czechs support the 
middle ground in politics or are right of center; only two 
percent support the extreme left wing and five percent the 
extreme right, according to the results of a recent poll 
conducted by the Institute for Public Opinion Research (IVVM). 
  Respondents were asked to define their position on the 
political spectrum with numbers from 1, signifying extreme left 
wing, to seven, the extreme right. Twenty-nine percent described 
themselves as centrist, 38 percent right of center and 17 
percent left of center. Nine percent had no opinion. 
  A higher number of those identifying themselves as right of 
center are in the 30-44 age group or are entrepreneurs, while 
the position finds less support among people over 60 and 
workers. IVVM polled 1,559 people over the age of fifteen.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Michele Kayal: "Gulf Between Czech Republic </F>
and Slovakia Growing Wider"] 
  [Text] Barely a year after the split of Czechoslovakia, 
world economic organizations have begun to recognize differences 
between its two successor republics and are showing alarm over 
the situation in Slovakia. 
  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
and 
the European Union both reported this week that while the Czech 
Republic is ticking along with optimism and steady economic 
reform, Slovakia is hampered by government policies and the 
outlook of its public. 
  The OECD report on the countries' economic conditions and 
prospects rules out the possibility of economic growth in 
Slovakia in the near future and puts the blame squarely on the 
shoulders of politicians. The government's slowdown of economic 
reforms, which the report contends took place in the first weeks 
after separation, has eroded the country's stability and been 
the main culprit in this year's ballooning state budget deficit 
and depletion of hard currency reserves. 
  The OECD judges that the uncertain situation has limited the 
flow of foreign investment, and that the economy will be at best 
stagnant in 1994. It predicts a likely drop in gross domestic 
product and a 3 percent rise in unemployment, to 18 percent. 
  The Czech Republic, on the other hand, is pronounced a 
miraculous example of a country that has liberalized and 
privatized its economy without any appreciable unemployment. But 
more significant restructuring lies ahead, the report notes, and 
a doubling of the unemployment rate to 8 percent in 1994 is 
likely as workers in newly privatized companies are laid off. 
  The report also faults the country's banks for buoying 
unprofitable state enterprises and predicts the imminent failure 
of several state-owned and private companies. 
  The OECD's findings were supported by the European Union's 
EuroBarometer report, which surveyed more than 1,000 people in 
16 Central and East European countries. Figures showed the Czech 
Republic outdistancing the other Visegrad countries (Poland, 
Hungary and Slovakia) in all of the four studied indicators: 
country direction, support of the market economy, satisfaction 
with democracy and human rights. Slovakia is having the most 
difficult time, surveyors note, with all of those indicators in 
decline. 
  Confidence in the country's direction increased 28 percent 
in 
the Czech Republic over 1993 while dropping 32 percent in 
Slovakia. Most Czechs in the EU report said they believe their 
current path is a correct one, while an absolute majority of 
Slovaks feel the opposite. 
  A majority of Czechs believe that creating a market economy 
is the best route for their country's future, while Slovaks are 
divided: Support for the market economy has fallen 11 percent in 
Slovakia since last year's survey. By the same token, Slovaks 
registered the highest degree of dissatisfaction with the speed 
of economic reform, with 15 percent more than last year saying 
it should be moving faster.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jana Klusakova: "Pendulum of Czech-Russian </F>
Relations Is Still in Motion"] 
  [Text] The November 1989 revolution in Czechoslovakia 
brought with it the beginning of a new relationship with the 
Soviet Union, a counterreaction to the previous 40 years. We cut 
ourselves loose from dependence on our mighty neighbor in an 
absolute but nonsensical way. 
  Understandably, the local population had a distaste for 
everything emanating from Russia. But the phenomenon of moving 
from one extreme to the other soon became apparent. 
  To illustrate, take the example of Russian-language 
instruction, which existed on a fairly high-quality level in all 
Czechoslovak general-education schools. It is debatable whether 
it was really necessary for all Czech and Slovak children to 
learn this particular language on a compulsory basis beginning 
in the fourth grade, but the fact of the matter is that we had 
thousands of university-educated teachers of Russian. After the 
revolution, there was a radical turnabout. 
  Even though the revolution came in the middle of the school 
year, over 90 percent of parents pulled their children from 
Russian classes and enrolled them instead in German or 
French--and, above all, English--classes. This was all very 
well, except that there was, and remains, a shortage of teachers 
of those languages. The teachers of Russian took crash 
retraining courses so they could teach languages about which 
they had only vague knowledge. Tons of Russian textbooks ended 
up in garbage bins. Established Russian bookstores were 
abolished. These days, Russian is being laboriously 
re-introduced, and there is a scramble to buy new Russian 
textbooks. 
  This scenario provides insight into the current relationship 
between the Czech Republic and Russia, irrespective of culture, 
economics or politics. We know very little about Russia, and the 
information we get is sporadic and incomplete. It seems that our 
biggest concern is that crude oil continues to flow from Russia. 
  It is therefore logical that when Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrei Kozyrev recently arrived in Prague on the first stop of 
his visit to the Visegrad Four countries, Czech journalists were 
surprised by his erudition, tact and "European standard." They 
were amazed that a Russian foreign minister was capable of 
speaking English. 
  Kozyrev was brought up in a Russian diplomatic family. The 
years he spent abroad during his youth predetermined his career 
as a diplomat. He studied at the prestigious Moscow State 
University for Foreign Relations, which is also the alma mater 
of many Czech diplomats. He then served in the Soviet Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs. When he rose to foreign minister, he faced 
the challenge of following Gromyko, Shevardnadze and Pankin--and 
had to make major staff changes in the ministry. 
  Kozyrev ranks among the most progressive Russians, but he 
has 
a well-known habit of changing his opinions according to 
circumstance and need. In the Russian government, he belongs to 
the Yegor Gaydar's reformist faction, although he isn't an 
outright "Yeltsinite." At the same time, well-informed sources 
in Moscow say Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin is not 
particularly close to Kozyrev, who is unpopular with extreme 
nationalists, moderates and conservatives. 
  When Kozyrev was in the Czech Republic, he visited President 
Vaclav Havel at his country cottage in Hradecek. Havel served 
his guest cabajka (Hungarian salami) and vodka, then Kozyrev 
answered a few questions posed by journalists. He said, for 
instance, that if the Czechs did not like the expression "sphere 
of interest," he would discontinue its use in regard to 
Russian-Czech Republic relations. He immediately went on to say 
Russians were concerned with the traditionally close historic 
and cultural ties between the two countries. He said these 
relations often took on romantic overtones. 
  As far as the Czech Republic's bid to join NATO was 
concerned, Kozyrev said the matter was a Czech affair but that 
we should not forget that there are other European groupings, 
such as the Visegrad Four. 
  Many among us remember that in the spring of 1968, Leonid 
Brezhnev also declared that what was happening in Czechoslovakia 
was nase delo--our affair. 
  With that in mind, I recall the song by Isaac Dunayevski 
from 
the film "Kuban Cossack." The lyrics go: "You have remained the 
way you always were."

ministers. 
  Hungarian Minister of International Economic Relations Bela 
Kadar and his Russian counterpart, Oleg Davidov, chaired a 
session of the Hungarian-Russian inter-governmental committee on 
trade and economic cooperation. 
  Kadar said the main topic discussed was the debt Russia owes 
Hungary and possible forms of repayment, adding that an 
agreement has been reached in principle on the means of 
repayment and possible Hungarian participation in Russian 
privatization.

Finance Minister Andrei Vavilov, and Deputy Foreign Minister 
Sergei Krilov. 
  Hungarian Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman told the 
press that the talks focussed mainly on bilateral economic 
cooperation. The two prime ministers agreed that unresolved 
issues outstanding from the past should be quickly settled, 
including Russia's debt to Hungary, so that efforts can be 
concentrated on strengthening business ties. 
  Herman said the $800-900 million which Russia owes Hungary 
could be repayed through the participation of Hungarian 
companies in Russian privatization, the use of non-commercial 
services, or machine deliveries. The possibility of further 
arms purchases was also raised, though Hungary would prefer 
modern market methods of debt repayment which promote economic 
relations. 
  Ministry leaders are to spend the next day-and-a-half 
discussing debt settlement. It is hoped that an agreement on 
this issue will be signed during Chernomyrdin's visit. 
  The two prime ministers noted with satisfaction that 
bilateral trade has stopped declining and conditions have been 
created for an increase in the near future. 
  Chernomyrdin said Moscow hopes Hungary will move ahead from 
the 7th place it presently takes among Russia's trading 
partners. Boross believes Hungary could mainly increase its 
exports of farm and food products, medicines and buses. 
  Regarding the Hungarian-Russian basic treaty, Chernomyrdin 
said that while the former parliament was unable to approve it, 
there is now a good chance for ratification. 
  Touching on the South Slav crisis, the Russian prime 
minister 
stressed that Moscow will do all it can for a peaceful 
settlement as soon as possible, which he noted was also in 
Hungary's best interest. 
  The two heads of government voiced agreement that political 
relations are settled and progressing fairly well between the 
two countries.

  [Text] Budapest, 31 Mar (MTI) -- President Arpad Goncz met 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in parliament on 
Thursday. 
  Summing up the talks, Presidential Spokesman Andras Farago 
said Goncz believed that business links between the two 
countries could be increased now that the necessary legal and 
institutional conditions have been created. The next step will 
be to work out an investment protection agreement and improve 
financial and bank relations. The president praised 
Chernomyrdin for his balancing role in Russia's political and 
economic life. 
  Chernomyrdin stressed that Russia was striving for economic 
and political stability in consideration of Hungary's reform 
experience. At the same time, Moscow is aware that it is 
impossible to introduce a pure market economy overnight in the 
face of such difficult tasks as, for instance, privatization and 
military industry conversion, the Russian prime minister said. 
  After meeting with Goncz, Chernomyrdin laid a wreath at the 
memorial of Soviet soldiers in Freedom Square and at the 
Hungarian heroes' monument in Heroes Square. 
  Chernomyrdin will begin his Friday programme at the 
Szekesfehervar (central Hungary) unit of the Ikarus bus factory. 
He will continue in Budapest with representatives of Hungarian 
economic and financial life. 
  In the afternoon, several documents will be signed in 
Parliament, after which Chernomyrdin and Boross will hold an 
international press conference.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 30 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef 
Moravcik today said he considered accelerating economic reforms 
to be the priority of his cabinet's six-month activity until the 
elections. 
  "We would like to speed up economic transformation," he told 
reporters. "There are provisional governments which manage to do 
much more than those which have more time, because they have 
enough courage to take resolute steps," Moravcik said, adding 
that "it would be good if we could lay down irreversible 
elements for the future of Slovakia." 
  The government's policy statement is to be discussed by 
Parliament on April 12. 
  Moravcik confirmed his intention to secure a stand-by loan 
from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to support Slovakia's 
payments balance. The IMF's condition for the loan is that 
Slovakia keep its budget deficit below the four percent mark. 
  He denied speculations that his cabinet was preparing to 
devalue the Slovak currency. The government intends to gain 
additional budget revenue from privatization income and by 
fighting against tax and customs duty evasions, Moravcik said. 
Nevertheless, he said "certain restrictions will be necessary" 
and will have an effect on the social sphere. He indicated the 
possibility of cutting state subsidies and liberalizing prices 
to a greater extent, which, he said, should not affect the 
poorer strata of the population. 
  Moravcik said the decision of the former Meciar cabinet to 
sell part of the shares of the steel producer Vychodoslovenske 
zieleziarne [East Slovak Iron Works] VSZ in Kosice to a private 
company, headed by ex-finance minister Julius Toth, for 
one-fifth of their nominal price was an example of the 
impoverishment of the state. 
  "The (Meciar) cabinet actually decided to pour one billion 
crowns from the state into the private sphere for free," said 
Moravcik. He added that no offense had been committed from the 
legal point of view, but members of the former cabinet who 
approved of the sale ought to bear political responsibility. He 
said the possibility of canceling the transaction was being 
considered.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 31 (CTK) -- Representatives of 
the "shadow cabinet" of former Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar 
today criticized what they said was a retreat by the new Slovak 
Government from its protectionist policy towards Czech exports. 
  "I'm surprised at Slovakia's unlimited cooperative approach 
towards colleagues from the Czech Republic, because a 
cooperative approach in trade relations ought to be mutual," 
former Economics Minister Jan Ducky told a press conference. He 
was referring to the recent Czech-Slovak preliminary agreement 
on the mutual recognition of certificates for food products and 
consumer goods. 
  Ducky criticized the amended Czech law on value-added tax, 
saying that the new calculation of the tax on goods imported 
from the Czech Republic would have a more severe effect on 
Slovak exports than the Slovak-imposed import surcharge had on 
imports from the Czech Republic. 
  Ducky also said that Slovak food exports to the Czech 
Republic were only a fraction of Czech exports to Slovakia and 
that the mutual recognition of certificates would harm Slovakia. 
  Former Vice-Premier Sergej Kozlik said the Meciar government 
had succeeded in reducing the deficit on the new clearing 
account for trade with the Czech Republic from 127 million ECU 
[European Currency Unit] to the present 19 million. Kozlik said 
that while Slovakia's deficit on the old account (for payments 
before the currency separation on February 8, 1993) amounted to 
470 million crowns at the end of February, now it was two 
billion crowns.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 30 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef 
Moravcik believes that preserving integration and cooperation at 
"its current level at least" is a priority in relations between 
the Czech Republic and Slovakia. 
  The preservation of the Customs Union was important from the 
point of view of the expected integration into the European 
Union, the support of European thinking and general strategy for 
the future, Moravcik told journalists today. 
  He said that open questions between the two countries should 
be solved but expressed doubt that they could be solved during 
his cabinet's six-month term of office. "However we are ready to 
make use of this space," he stressed, adding that he would 
consider it wonderful if the division of the former federal 
property could at last be settled. 
  Moravcik said that his cabinet intended to settle previously 
tense Slovak-Hungarian relations. 
  "We are interested in expanding cooperation," Moravcik said. 
He confirmed Slovakia's interest in Hungarian Foreign Minister 
Geza Jeszenszky's postponed visit to Bratislava taking place but 
admitted that it was being hindered by difficulties surrounding 
the conclusion of the Hungarian-Slovak readmission agreement. 
  "I firmly believe that we will find a way to overcome this 
problem," Moravcik said, adding that Bratislava was ready to 
open new border crossings between Slovakia and Hungary. 
  Moravcik rejected Meciar's warning against the penetration 
of 
Hungarian capital into southern Slovakia, arguing that capital 
was essentially international and to look for its ethnic origin 
was "counter-productive." 
  The signing of a basic Slovak-Hungarian inter-state treaty 
was an open question in relations between Slovakia and Hungary, 
Moravcik said. He said that Bratislava expected the treaty to 
confirm the current border, which would eradicate fears of 
ethnic minority irredentism and possible territorial claims from 
the south. However Budapest is making the recognition of 
collective rights of the half- million Hungarian minority a 
condition, which Bratislava rejects, Moravcik said. 
  Jeszenszky's visit, planned for last autumn, was again 
postponed after Bratislava made the conclusion of a readmission 
agreement on the return of illegal emigrants a condition for 
opening new border crossings between the two countries. 
Budapest refuses to conclude such an agreement for fear of an 
influx of Romanian refugees into its territory. 
  As regards the current state of Slovak-Polish relations 
Moravcik said: "We are greatly interested in developing these 
relations but we cannot find a mechanism to realize them. We 
realize that our deeds are lagging behind our words." He 
mentioned the possibility of the Polish premier visiting 
Bratislava.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Michele Kayal: "Slovaks Taxing European </F>
Union's Patience"] 
  [Text] The last remaining tie of the broken marriage 
between Czechs and Slovaks--the special trade relationship 
between the former federation partners--suffered a serious blow 
last week when Slovakia slapped a 10 percent import tax on 
nearly everything crossing its border. 
  The measure, announced without warning on March 3 by the 
Slovak government, immediately imposed the tax on all consumer 
goods from all countries. It was the second trade barrier thrown 
up by the Slovaks in three weeks. 
  Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, rushing to protect his 
country's exporters, responded with a 3 percent devaluation of 
the Czech crown in relation to the clearing ECU (the European 
Union's currency unit for trade payments between the two 
republics). The move effectively made Czech goods 3 percent less 
expensive in Slovakia and Slovak goods 3 percent more expensive 
in the Czech Republic. 
  Slovak Finance Ministry officials described the tax as an 
attempt to raise money to shore up the country's trade deficit 
with the Czech Republic. They said it would remain in place for 
six months. 
  "It's only temporary," said ministry spokesman Miroslav 
Polacek. "We have to get a better position for the balance of 
payments for the Slovak Republic. It's not for the defense of 
our internal market." 
  Since the Czech-Slovak monetary union ended in February 
1993, 
Slovakia has run a consistent deficit with the Czech Republic. 
Bratislava paid Prague $100 million to cover its deficit for 
December 1993 and January 1994. In February, however, Slovakia 
did not owe the Czech Republic anything, according to a 
spokesman for the Czech National Bank. 
  Klaus said he recognized the move as "legitimate," but added 
that the two sides should reevaluate their customs union, the 
special arrangement that allows the two countries to be treated 
as a single trading bloc. 
  "[The customs union] will exist," said Czech government 
spokeswoman Klara Pospisilova, "but probably the rules will 
change." Officials would not comment on details of possible 
changes, but Klaus will likely meet Slovak Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar next week. 
  The new Slovak tax also raised the hackles of the 
international community, which had previously voiced loud 
opposition to a Slovak measure introduced on February 11 that 
suddenly required that certificates of quality for foodstuff 
imports be presented at the border. 
  "We are not opposed to the measure as such. We are aware of 
their economic difficulties," said Gerhard Sabathil of the 
European Union's Prague delegation. "[But] there's a clear 
obligation of the country to consult such measures beforehand 
with the EU. And as we told them this three weeks ago when they 
introduced the certificates, it's really disappointing."

  [Text] Tirana, March 31 (ATA) -- The interior minister of 
Serbia [as received], Radmilo Bogdanovic, acting deputy chairman 
of the Chamber of the Republics of the self-styled Yugoslavia, 
has warned that "all conditions exist" for a ban to the activity 
of the Democratic League of Kosova [LDK]. 
  Speaking of the present political situation in Kosova, in an 
interview with the Serbian newspaper JEDINSTVO of Pristine, the 
former head of police, Bogdanovic, who in 1989-1990 ordered the 
killing of scores of Albanian demonstrators, warned of "other 
Serbian actions in order to bring back to earth the Albanians 
who have been deceived by the LDK, and make them recognize the 
state of Serbia," Bogdanovic said. 
  Referring to the arrest of a group of Albanians, described 
as 
members of a certain "Defence Ministry" of Kosova, Bogdanovic 
stressed that this group in only one of the faults of the LDK. 
According to him, criminal acts are also considered the 
attendance of Albanian classes after the closure of the schools, 
the continuous medical service after the dismissal of all 
Albanian doctors from the hospitals of Kosova as well as all 
other activities carried out by the Albanians out of the Serbian 
control. "The LDK and its leader, Ibrahim Rugova, are not yet 
accepting the fact that there is not and there will never be a 
Republic of Kosova in the territory of Serbia and Yugoslavia," 
Bogdanovic declared. He implied that Serbia is resolute to 
continue the road of war when he threatened that "Rugova is 
involving the Albanian national minority into new complications 
and problems." Bogdanovic addressed to international 
organizations, warning them that Serbia "Will not accept anyone 
to send there delegations and commissions for control." He gave 
a negative response to the request by the CSCE to send its 
observers in Kosova, nervously saying that "They should consult 
competent authorities in the ministries, should accept 
information and reports by respective ministries and must not to 
reach conclusions based on the statements by Ibrahim Rugova and 
other members of the LDK."

  [Text] Tirana, March 31 (ATA) -- "An American initiative 
would have positive impact on the Kosova question," Dr. Ibrahim 
Rugova, president of the Republic of Kosova, said in an 
interview with ZERI published in Pristina. President Rugova 
said that "the American policy is more pragmatic." 
  In regard to the negotiations with the Serbian side on the 
Kosova question, Mr. Rugova said he had asked an American 
initiative for intermediation in the presence of European allies 
and in consultation with Russia. 
  Concerning his approach in possible talks, Dr. Rugova said 
he 
will observe the referendum of September 1991 and will represent 
the will of the Kosova citizens expressed in the referendum.

International recently has sent a letter to the Serbian 
president, Slobodan Milosevic, expressing its concern for the 
maltreatment of the Albanian writers in Kosova and urging him to 
stop the violation of the writers' rights there. The 
imprisonment of Murteza Nura and Shaip Broiri is considered in 
the letter as an unlawful act because they are being kept in

  [Text] Budapest, 29 March (MTI) -- On March 29, the 
Hungarian Foreign Ministry passed a verbal request to the Slovak 
embassy in Budapest. 
  The Hungarian Government -- in accord with European Union 
recommendations for water division, which were rejected by 
Slovakia -- calls upon the Slovak Government to open bilateral 
talks on a temporary water management regime immediately, the 
ministry's press department informed MTI on Wednesday [30 March]. 
  The Slovak side unilaterally diverted the Danube in 1992, to 
operate the Gabcikovo power station. Since then, the main 
riverbed has been supplied with much less water than before, 
endangering the ecological balance of the Szigetkoz region. 
  The negotiations are urgent because the vegetation growth 
period has already begun. The talks are also justified by 
obligations which the two sides assumed in a Separate Treaty 
concluded in connection with The Hague trial. 
  Hungary's government stressed in the communique that it is 
indispensable to guarantee a considerable increase in the water 
discharge to the main riverbed.

  [Text] Budapest, 29 March (MTI) -- "If we want Hungary to 
become a western-type democracy, we have to continue 
privatization, namely the transformation of state assets into 
human ones," Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross said in a 
speech, closing a two-day conference on privatization held in 
Budapest by the Central and East European Christian Democratic 
Academy. 
  Addressing an audience of foreign experts and advisers, 
Boross spoke in detail about the historical heritage and 
environment that determine privatization in Hungary. 
  Change in ownership always provides opportunities for 
corruption, Boross said, admitting that there had been some 
serious abuses of privatization in Hungary, too. He warned, 
however, that it would be a mistake to draw general conclusions 
from these cases. 
  The prime minister spoke in favor of consistent pursuit of 
privatization and concluded his address saying, "private 
ownership will soon prevail in Hungary's economy."

passed by parliament on March 18 and expected to come into force 
on April 1. 
  In a letter to Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy the president said 
he wished the Sejm reconsider the law which, he wrote, posed a 
threat to the continuation of market reforms in Poland and could 
pave the way for a return to centralistic and bureaucratic 
management of the economy. 
  The law envisaged financial penalties for enterprises which 
increased wages of their employees above the limit set by the 
government. The penalties would amount to a tax equal to 150 
percent of the excess in wages. 
  The law would have applied to state and communal firms, but 
it also gave the government some control over pay in the private 
sector in a situation of "particular threat to the financial 
balance of the state." 
  The law was a controversial issue even before its adoption, 
winning only the support of the government coalition parties 
(the Polish Peasant Party and the Democratic Left Alliance). 
They argued that a complete departure from all wage controls 
was not feasible in the present Polish situation and that the 
law was much less rigorous than the act it was to replace, the 
much-hated excess wage tax. Also, they pointed out that wage 
controls were not a Communist invention but a tough but 
necessary policy tool. 
  The law was strongly opposed by other parliamentary factions 
and the Solidarity trade union, as well as by the right wing 
parties not represented in parliament. The latter were 
particularly critical of the powers vested in the government to 
control wages in the private sector in emergency situations. 
  Reacting to the news of the presidential veto Thursday, 
leaders of those parties supported Walesa's decision. Piotr 
Marciniak of the left-wing Union of Labour (UP) also backed the 
veto, but pointed out that it was an element in Walesa's 
struggle against the ruling coalition. 
  Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak issued a statement saying he 
wanted the Poles to enjoy Easter holidays in peace and therefore 
would not comment on the presidential veto. 
  The Sejm will discuss the veto at a session scheduled for 
April 7. In order to overrule the veto, supporters of the law 
have to muster a two thirds majority.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 31 -- President Lech Walesa on 
Thursday said that he had not made up his mind yet whether he 
would sign the 1994 budget law, but added that "satisfaction of 
the nation and its understanding of certain values" is "more 
important than the budget." 
  In an interview for PAP the president confirmed that he is 
against Dariusz Rosati's candidature for the posts of deputy 
prime minister and finance minister. 
  "I consider myself a responsible politician and I do 
everything to put the weal of the country in the first place," 
Walesa said when asked about the budget. He added, that even if 
he refuses to sign, he would do it being perfectly aware that 
the coalition would have its way. 
  The budget covers only one year and it is known beforehand 
that it will be amended. "The question is what is more 
important, this budget designed only to initiate certain 
economic processes, or the nation," Walesa argued saying that 
"according to economic calculus one cannot do much about the 
budget, but I think that one should not have told people 
something different and demand from them commitment, support and 
satisfaction while deceiving them." 
  Reminded that the Sejm may reject the presidential veto, 
Walesa said he did not care whether he would win (the battle of 
budget) but he does care about what will be "left after him. If 
I bring society a victory on a tea-tray it would never take to 
work," Walesa said. 
  Referring to his refusal to accept the ruling coalition's 
candidate Dariusz Rosati, Walesa asked: 
  "How can one ignore the president, bring him documents to 
sign and not to discuss the issue at all? I raise this because 
the coalition demands absolute accord from me. It is as if (the 
Communist Party) Central Committee proposed: It must be so," 
Walesa continued. 
  Reminded that the coalition still wants to discuss the 
issue, 
Walesa said that situation would be different if the president 
or his representative had been asked earlier to take part in the 
discussion on selecting a candidate. "Something might have been 
agreed," Walesa said and explained that he was "not included in 
the process and now they demand from me to sign at gun point." 
  After all what has been said about the FOZZ (Foreign Debt 
Servicing Fund) as the biggest theft and swindle in Poland, we 
cannot make deputy prime minister of persons who were on the 
FOZZ board, Walesa said but added that he did not mean that the 
person in question was guilty or not, but only that this person 
was a FOZZ board member. "Hence, I should not agree to what is 
proposed to me unless the matter is accounted for...there are 
many talented people, party and non-party alike, in our country 
of 40 million...," Walesa said. 
  Asked to asses the report of the National Radio and TV 
Council Walesa criticized the council's decision to grant the 
only available national private tv licence to a man with "six 
names on ten passports." He referred to Zygmunt Solorz, a 
businessman. 
  Asked what he will do if the Sejm refuses to ratify the 
concordat with the Holy See, Walesa said he would not do 
anything that would break Polish law and democracy. "I am a man 
who always finds solutions...as a president I must and will 
certainly find a solution," Walesa assured.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 31 -- Defence Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk failed to present Thursday a new deputy defence 
minister coming from the ruling coalition, contrary to earlier 
press reports. 
  At a press conference held shortly after his return from the 
United States and Canada, Kolodziejczyk hinted that the 
coalition itself is to be blamed for the lack of his deputy. He 
confirmed that before he left for the United States he had 
chosen one candidate from among four forwarded to him by the 
coalition but this candidate had not been formally approved. 
  "After my return I encountered totally different situation 
when the entire coalition pronounced itself against the interest 
of the state while voting for the budget," Kolodziejczyk said 
referring to the Defence Ministry budget which, in the ministry 
opinion's, is unfavourable. He said that he wanted to meet 
President Lech Walesa as soon as possible to discuss the matter. 
  In Kolodziejczyk's opinion, the parliament decision to 
assign 
300 billion zlotys (around 13.6 million dollars) from the 
Defence Ministry budget for the purchase of "Iryda" planes does 
not serve the defence interest of the state, does harm to other 
arms industry plants and may delay the production of a Polish 
anti-aircraft short-range missile. 
  Commenting upon his visit to the United States, the minister 
said that "the foreign policy of the United States has shifted 
towards Poland." "We are linked by strategic interests," he 
added. 
  He explained that his talks in the U.S. focused on the U.S. 
technological assistance for the Polish Army and on assistance 
in financing "partnership for peace" programme. Kolodziejczyk 
said that Poland cannot count on receiving money at present as 
the matters related to the assistance are being discussed. 
  Asked what he thinks about the concentration of Russian Army 
in the Kaliningrad District, he replied that this is groundless 
from the operational point of view. "Poland wants to have 
partnership relations with Russia but Russia is pretending to be 
a besieged stronghold. Our streched hand, as far as economic 
cooperation is concerned, usually is in vain, the minister said.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 31 -- Polish parliamentary delegation 
visit to Romania that ended on Wednesday "should break the 
political and economic deadlock in Polish-Romanian contacts," 
Senate Speaker Adam Struzik said on Thursday. 
  He added that during the talks of the delegation with 
Romanian leading politicians, the Romanian side made it clear 
that the contacts between the two countries have weakened 
recently. Struzik hopes that after his forthcoming talks with 
the Polish prime minister and the minister for foreign economic 
relations the relations will be intensified. 
  According to Struzik, Romania can be Poland's good economic 
partner.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 29/3/1994 -- "The visit paid by 
Minister Grachev is a first proof of a relaunch in the 
collaboration ties between Romania and the Russian Federation, 
holding a major contribution also on a political plane and not 
only on the military one," said the Romanian head of diplomacy 
Teodor Melescanu after the Monday [28 March] interview with 
General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense minister, currently 
on a visit to Romania at the invitation of his Romanian 
counterpart, Gheorghe Tinca. 
  The Romanian high official also said that during the talks 
stress was laid on the importance Romania was giving to the 
building of a security system at European level, which would 
ensure also Romania's security, which depends on other elements 
too such as the democratic process in Russia and the ties 
between the two countries. 
  In the context, both sides referred also to other security 
structures, pointing on the role held by the CSCE, the role of 
bilateral ties, as well as on the contribution of regional 
collaboration to bring stability in the area.

  [Excerpt] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 30/3/1994 -- [passage 
omitted] Romania's stance on the North Korean nuclear file was 
presented at today's news conference of the Romanian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs by Simona Miculescu, deputy to the ministry's 
spokesman. 
  The statement shows that Romania's attitude to this issue 
derives from its position as party to the treaty of 
non-proliferation of nuclear arms, and that by joining this 
treaty the People's Democratic Republic of Korea voluntarily 
assumed to strictly, unconditionally abide by the international 
commitments to this end. 
  "We find it in the interest of security and peace in the 
Korean peninsula that the DPRK complies with the regulations of 
the guarantee agreement concluded with the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA], including inspections of the North-Korean 
nuclear plants. At the same time, it is obvious that to reach 
this target the direct negotiations between United States and 
the DPRK have to be resumed, as well as the dialogue between the 
North and South of Korea, a prime component of which should be 
the issue of denuclearising the Korean peninsula. 
  "The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pronounces for 
steps apt to favor such processes, which would contribute to 
defusing tension in the Korean peninsula, and for a negotiated 
settlement of the issues raised by the North Korean nuclear 
file," the Romanian Foreign Ministry's statement says.

Entz, president of the Office of Hungarians Beyond the Border, 
at a Thursday meeting in Cluj conferred the Middle Cross of the 
Republic of Hungary Merit of Order on Samu Benko, cultural 
historian and chairman of the Transylvanian Museum Association, 
on behalf of President Arpad Goncz. Benko has gained 
distinction as a researcher and publicist in preserving the 
cultural identity of Hungarians in Romania. 
  During his tour in Transylvania, Entz met representatives of 
the Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania and other Hungarian 
organizations with whom he discussed how Hungarian aid had been 
used and what future changes and improvement should be 
introduced. The state secretary also met senior officials from 
over 30 foundations.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/3/1994 -- With regard to the 
visit in Romania made by some Hungarian dignitaries, the speaker 
of the Chamber of Deputies, Adrian Nastase told ROMPRES: 
  "The Hungarian dignitaries' visit in Romania has a certain 
degree of ambiguity which we have failed to remove yet. It is 
mainly the fault of the Romanian authorities who have not proven 
the firmness necessary in such occasions. If Mr. Geza Entz 
comes as a private person then he should eventually follow a 
tourism program but in no way should he get involved in public 
actions, attend political meetings, hand medals. Such kind of 
things can be made only in cooperation with the Romanian 
authorities, within an official visit. I believe that this time 
some measures must be taken. If the government fails to take 
these measures, then it exposes itself to some grounded 
criticism." 
  "An electoral campaign is taking place in Hungary for the 
elections of the following months but the campaign should not be 
extended in Romania and in no way should the Hungarian 
dignitaries, especially those from the office for the Hungarians 
abroad led by Geza Entz, carry out electoral campaign activities 
in the neighbouring countries." 
  "In my opinion, it is necessary that the Romanian Ministry 
of 
Foreign Affairs instate a requirement for visas on diplomatic 
passports belonging to Hungarian citizens, such that, when 
somebody comes to Romania under a diplomatic passport, he should 
not 'sneak into' a tourism visit sheltered by the diplomatic 
passport but actually carrying out official actions." 
  "It is therefore necessary that due visas be required in the 
relations with Hungarian officials such that to teach the ones 
who have not understood it very well yet what the Romanian 
state's sovereignty over its entire territory means," said the 
Chamber of Deputies' Speaker Adrian Nastase.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/3/1994 -- Romanian Premier 
Nicolae Vacaroiu received Thursday, March 31, Hans Blix, 
president of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
currently in Romania to make an inspection of the way in which 
works are being carried out at unit one of the atomic station of 
Cernavoda. 
  Hans Blix, voiced, on this occasion, the preoccupations of 
the world body he works with for permanent surveillance of the 
atomic stations in Eastern Europe, for support to be granted to 
them to improve their protection systems. The IAEA president 
showed interest in the creation in Romania of a unique authority 
for surveillance and control of nuclear activities, under the 
premier's direct subordination. 
  Premier Vacaroiu said that the government was interested 
that 
the Cernavoda atomic station start operation as soon as possible 
with respect of all international duties in the domain. 
  The director general of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency also met on Thursday with the Romanian Minister of the 
Industries, Dumitru Popescu. 
  Appreciating Mr. Hans Blix's visit in a very important 
moment 
when Romania prepares for the actuation of the first unit of the 
nuclear plant at Cernavoda, about 200 km east of Bucharest, the 
Romanian minister said after the meeting that the two parties 
agreed that the situation of the nuclear sector was vital for 
Romania's energy system as the conventional energy resources -- 
methane gas, oil -- were shrinking while the water power 
stations very expensive. 
  "Mr. Hans Blix's findings during the visit at the Cernavoda 
plant, the second in four years, concerning the security and 
quality standards of the works are encouraging us in speeding-up 
the finalisation of the works and in trying to find, together 
with the other cabinet members, the funds necessary for the 
completion and actuation of the unit one during the current 
year," said the Romanian minister. 
  The IAEA head and the Romanian minister approached also 
issues concerning the cooperation between the IAEA and the 
Romanian Ministry of Industries. The Vienna-based agency 
provides yearly the financial means for the training of about 
30-40 Romanian experts following specialization stages in 
various countries, said Minister Popescu. 
  Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, IAEA, was conferred, during a specific ceremony 
on March 31, the title of Doctor Honoris Causa of the Bucharest 
University. 
  During the laudatio, Professor Emil Constantinescu, 
chancellor of the Bucharest University, referred, alongside 
Blix's scientific merits, to his rich political and diplomatic 
activity, to the particular stress he lays on legal guarantees 
apt to prevent the use of atomic energy for purposes other than 
peaceful.

  [Text] Prague, March 30 (CTK) -- "It matters to no one in 
the Czech Republic and no one is frightened by the fact that Mr. 
(Vladimir) Dlouhy (Trade and Industry Minister) and Mr. (Ivan) 
Kocarnik (Finance Minister), who are former Communists, have now 
been in power for two years," Democratic Left Party (SDL) 
Chairman Peter Weiss says in today's right-leaning TELEGRAF. 
  He said this in reply to a question about how he would react 
to a statement that Communists had returned to power in Slovakia. 
  "If, however, Communists who created a new political party 
assume power -- it instantly matters to everyone," Weiss adds. 
(The SDL was formerly the Slovak Communist Party). 
  On early elections in Slovakia in autumn, he says: "In the 
elections the Slovak people will have to express themselves 
clearly about what path Slovakia will embark upon -- whether it 
will follow the line of 'civil war rather than the President', 
the policy, in other words, of political revenge on those who 
had enough courage to democratically pass a no-confidence vote 
on the Premier (Vladimir Meciar), the policy of populist 
movements which endlessly give promises, but never keep them, or 
whether it will follow a line of cooperation between political 
parties which exist in the West," says Weiss. 
  On the new Slovak Government of Premier Jozef Moravcik and 
the potential devaluation of the Slovak crown, Weiss says that 
the new government's program is not based on "devaluation at any 
cost and under any circumstances." He does not think that 
Slovakia is "predetermined to experience rapid devaluation." 
  Commenting on the greatest problems Slovakia is now facing, 
Weiss says that these are above all "growing state budget 
deficit and a critical situation in the education and health 
services, due to a lack of funds, which the new government 
inherited from the previous one." 
  Comparing his party and similar parties in other East 
European post-Communist countries, Weiss says that the SDL has 
much in common with the Hungarian Socialist Party as well as 
with the Polish Democratic Left Party, though the party 
transformation took place under different circumstances there. 
"We also have good relations with the Italian Democratic Left 
Party," says Weiss, and adds that on the Czech political scene 
the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) of Milos Zeman is 
nearest to them. 
  "Our pro-Western orientation is unambiguous," Weiss says in 
connection with Slovakia's foreign policy. He says that 
together with Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis he "has pushed 
through (a policy of Slovakia's) rapprochement with NATO to its 
full membership in this organization." 
  Weiss says that Slovakia is watching developments in Russia 
and is "not satisfied with the manifestation of extremism and a 
new wave of 'Greater Russian' nationalism. This is also the 
very reason why we agree with the (U.S.-proposed) Partnership 
for Peace," Weiss says. 
  On the CSSD's initiative concerning the creation of a Czech- 
Slovak union, Weiss says that the SDL sees the (January 1, 1993) 
division of Czechoslovakia as a "reality which should not be 
changed. Both successor states (the Czech and Slovak Republics) 
have been recognized and so there are no longer political 
conditions either at home or abroad for the restoration of what 
has already existed," Weiss says. 
  Chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) Jan 
Carnogursky says in the economic daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY that 
the new Slovak Government will now have to make an "inventory of 
Slovakia and assess what it has inherited from (the government 
of ex-Premier) Vladimir Meciar." 
  In connection with Czech-Slovak problems ensued from 
Czechoslovakia's split, he says that the new Slovak Government 
"can free Slovak policy towards the Czech Republic from negative 
emotions" and that it will maintain a "matter-of-fact approach" 
in this respect, which has already been shown in the 
Czech-Slovak negotiations of the Customs Union Council this 
week. Some partial problems which burden the Czech-Slovak 
relations will undoubtedly be resolved. But what the current 
government will most likely not manage to resolve are for 
instance the Czech National Bank claims towards Slovakia valued 
at 24 million crowns (about $800 million), and some other 
greater problems," Carnogursky says.

  [Text] Prague, March 31 (CTK) -- A privatization deal 
approved by Vladimir Meciar's government shortly before it was 
unseated by a vote of no-confidence deprived the state of about 
a billion Slovak crowns ($31 million), Premier Jozef Moravcik 
said on Slovak television on Wednesday, the Czech daily RUDE 
PRAVO reports today. 
  Speaking in the weekly debate programme "Slobodny piatok," 
Moravcik, who succeeded Meciar as premier on March 16, said the 
outgoing government sold a ten percent stake in the East Slovak 
Steelworks, VSZ Kosice, to a private company at 20 percent of 
the nominal value. 
  In the programme Moravcik was answering the questions of 
Slovak and foreign journalists for the first time since his 
appointment. He called the sale by Meciar's government immoral 
in view of the financial losses caused to Slovakia, RUDE PRAVO 
reports.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 31 (CTK) -- The government 
coalition is seeking to paralyze the control system in Slovakia, 
Slovak National Party (SNS) honorary chairman and former 
vice-premier in Vladimir Meciar's cabinet Jozef Prokes told 
journalists today. 
  Opposition leaders believe that the dismissal of the 
leadership of the Slovak Supreme Inspection Office (NKU) and the 
abolition of the Government's Office Control Department testify 
to efforts to paralyze the control system in Slovakia, Prokes 
said. 
  The Slovak Parliament, at its last session, dismissed the 
NKU 
chairman and vice-chairmen. The abolition of the Control 
Department in the Government's Office stems from the law on 
state administration bodies passed by Parliament, according to 
which the Government's Office is no longer a state 
administrative organ. 
  Former SNS deputy and NKU Deputy Chairman Petr Sokol 
believes 
that his dismissal was an act of political revenge. Sokol 
confirmed his intention to lodge a complaint with a civic court 
and not with the Constitutional Court because the dismissed 
members of the NKU leadership consider the approach adopted 
towards them illegal. 
  Prokes said that the cancellation of the 13 privatization 
projects approved at the last session of Meciar's cabinet was an 
"international deception." It would be even bigger if "the next 
government would cancel the privatization projects of the 
current cabinet," he added. 
  The government of Premier Jozef Moravcik had to cancel at 
least 13 privatization projects so as "not to lose face" given 
that it had consistently criticized Meciar for his steps in 
privatization, Prokes said.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 31 (CTK) -- The cancellation of 
privatization projects which were approved by the government of 
ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar will discourage foreigners from 
investing in Slovakia, Meciar's close aide Ivan Lexa told CTK 
today. 
  "No one will be certain about whether this 'nationalization' 
will not be repeated in the future," Lexa, former state 
secretary at the Privatization Ministry, said after a session of 
Meciar's "shadow" cabinet. 
  "This is an international precedent. Valid agreements and 
resolutions have been abolished without a legal document. No 
investor will be certain as to whether the next government will 
not cancel the decisions of the previous one," Lexa said. 
  Citing legal and factual shortcomings the new government of 
Jozef Moravcik on Tuesday [29 March] canceled 13 privatization 
projects out of a total of 45 approved by Meciar's cabinet at a 
time when his remaining in power was uncertain. Current 
Privatization Minister Milan Janicina even mentioned the 
possibility of launching criminal proceedings in several cases. 
This, however, aroused doubts even in the Slovak press, as the 
ex-Premier's aides and their relatives participated in this 
privatization. 
  At a press conference, Lexa described the cancellation of 
the 
13 projects as an "act of socialization and nationalization." He 
said it was a politically-motivated decision aimed at "heaping 
as much dirt as possible on Meciar."

  [Excerpts] Russia, the only European superpower outside the 
European Union [EU], agrees to Hungary's future membership in 
the EU. This was declared by Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin at a news conference held in Budapest a few hours 
after Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky handed over 
Hungary's application for EU membership in Athens on Friday [1 
April]. 
  [Begin Chernomyrdin recording, in Russian fading into 
Hungarian translation] We support Hungary's submission today of 
its application to join the EU. Russia is also preparing to do 
this. We hope a decision on this will be made this year, first 
on the political level and then in the economy as well. Of 
course, this will take a considerable period of time. We do not 
have illusions because we assess the situation realistically. 
We expect that when Hungary is a member of the EU, it will 
support Russia's membership application. [end recording] 
  At the news conference, which followed two days of 
negotiations in Budapest between the Hungarian and Russian prime 
ministers, other issues of integration and security policy were 
also discussed. A British journalist asked about Hungary's 
intention to join NATO. 
  [Begin Chernomyrdin recording, in Russian fading into 
Hungarian translation] It is a matter for Hungary, the Hungarian 
Government, and the Hungarian people to decide whether or not to 
join NATO. We may express our view on it, we may offer 
philosophical theories about it, but it is still a matter for 
the Hungarian people. [end recording] 
  It was also said at the news conference that Russia could 
pay 
back some of its debts to Hungary through arms deliveries. 
Chernomyrdin did not rule this out. Even more, he offered joint 
arms production, the possibility for Hungarian firms and 
entrepreneurs to participate in the privatization of Russian 
weapon manufacturing plants and to acquire share ownership in 
these plants as a form of [Russian] debt repayment. [passage 
omitted] 
  The main focus of the prime ministerial negotiations was the 
economy. Russia will repay its debt, which amounts to about 
$800 million, within three years through deliveries, services, 
and handing over Russian assets into the ownership of Hungarian 
entrepreneurs. Meanwhile Russia will pay interest on the 
existing debt. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Tibor J. Keri report: "If the MSZP Forms the Government, </F>
the MDF Will Not Have a Place in It, Gyula Horn, Leader of the 
Socialists Says"] 
  [Text] I do not wish to react to the statements of Viktor 
Orban [chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats, Fidesz] or 
other leaders of the Fidesz, Gyula Horn, chairman of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], told our correspondent. As is 
known, Orban recently said that the parliamentary parties had 
made a mistake by letting the MSZP out of quarantine after two 
years, and society will suffer for this. Horn also said that if 
the MSZP came to power, it would be a deception of the electors 
to take the current Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] back into 
government. 
  In connection with Orban's statement, Horn noted that he 
cannot do anything about such statements, but he finds it 
unfortunate that the Fidesz is adopting the style applied by 
some of the government parties. This does not suit them, Horn 
said, and at the same time, he believes that the Young Democrats 
will still have time to cool down. 
<H5>  Rather Than Wrestling, It Is Confidence Gaining </H5>
  Horn does not believe Prime Minister Boross, either, who 
said 
that the elections will be decided between the MSZP and the MDF, 
and the liberal parties will wither away. At the same time, he 
thinks it possible that, in the long run, the liberal parties 
will fulfill a political role similar to that in Western Europe. 
This means that they will be parties with a marked character 
but smaller social support than they now have. However, Horn 
certainly does not assume that the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ] would not have an important role in the May elections, 
and its results will be at least as good as those of the MDF. 
Therefore, Horn sees Boross's statement on this as a simple 
prediction, one that is solely meant to reassure the MDF, but 
which is unlikely to increase the number of their votes. 
  About the election prospects, Horn also said that the MSZP 
is 
not wrestling with the MDF, but the MSZP would like to gain the 
confidence of the voters. They would find it desirable if they 
reached a result that expresses that Hungary does have a 
European democratic left wing. A left wing -- whether it is in 
government or opposition -- which cannot be left out of 
important decisions. This is our fundamental goal, rather than 
dealing with other parties' predictions of chances, Horn noted. 
He added that it is their feeling that most of the citizens 
have already decided for whom to vote, but this will only come 
to light at election time. 
  Horn finds the increasing coarseness of the election 
campaign 
worrying. In reply to our note that a recent UJ MAGYARORSZAG 
interview called him the "most popular henchman," Horn said that 
if he took certain articles in the UJ MAGYARORSZAG seriously 
then he should indeed leave the country. What is published in 
this newspaper has nothing to do with honest information, he 
said. He finds it regrettable that newspapers that are 
presumably supported from state finances can allow themselves to 
take this tone. According to Horn, in the long run, a solution 
could be reached in the Hungarian press if all newspapers were 
privatized after the elections and the readers could then decide 
through their purchases if newspapers with this style are 
needed. At the moment, this newspaper can easily survive 
because its losses, which exist in spite of its declining 
print-runs, are presumably covered from state resources, he 
added. As for the so-called opposition press, he noted that, 
contrary to government propaganda, the MSZP's popularity is not 
to be attributed to the press. As an example, he also mentioned 
NEPSZABADSAG, because, as he said, this newspaper was not very 
good at reporting the MSZP's important proposals and 
parliamentary statements to the readers. 
<H5>  There Is a Witness to Every Lie </H5>
  According to information received by NEPSZABADSAG, 
government 
circles have asked the activists of the National Federation of 
Political Prisoners [POFOSZ] and the Historical Justice 
Committee [TIB] to seek out evidence and witnesses in connection 
with Horn's activities in 1956 and 1957. In connection with 
this, Horn said that it is possible that this kind of action has 
been started. In his view, it is an old truism that it is 
always possible to find and pay a "witness" for every lie. In 
the past four years, they have tried to accuse him of all kinds 
of acts but all these slanders have proved to be lies. It is 
possible that new ones will be brought up, and I will reply to 
them; however, if I receive any very rude insults then I will 
use my legal rights, he said. 
  According to Horn, it is necessary for the current 
government 
to prepare detailed accounts before it gives power to the new 
cabinet. This is important because, whatever kind of government 
comes to power, the new parliament must be clear about the 
country's real financial situation. From an opposition 
position, we were not able to find out many facts. For example, 
we do not know what kind of domestic and foreign financial 
commitments and guarantees the Boross government has taken on. 
Nor do we know exactly what kind of lasting effects the various 
government decisions will have and how Hungary's debt-servicing 
obligations may change. It is important to find all this out 
because these factors will significantly influence the next 
government's freedom of movement. This is one of the reasons it 
is important for the current cabinet to give a true report on 
the economy's real situation instead of the country being full 
of the propaganda of success, Horn stated. Should the Boross 
cabinet decide to distort the reality and deceive the new 
government and society, this will be discovered very quickly, 
within a few weeks, Horn said. He is convinced that expert 
committees will have to uncover the country's real situation 
while the coalition talks are being held. 

<H5>    Social Cooperation Is Needed </H5>
  In Horn's view, after the elections, regardless of the 
result, social unity will be needed to remove the country from 
the economic crisis. He said that the other side also has 
honest people and the loudest people in the parties need not be 
identified with the given parties. There are many clever and 
sober people who are free from extremism in this country. 
Therefore, Horn is convinced that the new parliament and 
government will have the opportunity to integrate these forces. 
I am optimistic, and believe that, sooner or later, it will 
certainly be possible to create social unity in this country, 
Horn said. Talking about a possible grand coalition, Horn said 
that it would be equivalent to deceiving the electors if the 
MSZP, in case it comes to government, retained the MDF in 
government. However, even if the current government parties are 
put into opposition, we would like to achieve a normal dialogue 
and cooperation between the parliamentary parties, Horn said at 
the end of the interview.

<F P=106> [Interview with Army Commander Janos Deak by Erika Gulyas, </F>
broadcast in the "Kinn Padon" program of Hungarian Television's 
Day TV on 21 March; place not given: "We Need A Hungarian 
Military Industry"] 
  [Text] [Gulyas] Kalman Lorincz, the predecessor of 
Hungarian Army Commander Janos Deak, who retired at the 
beginning of March, said that he was leaving a depressed army 
behind. Do you agree with this evaluation today? 
  [Deak] Kalman Lorincz obviously had a reason to say these 
things when he left. I think that the mood of the personnel of 
the Hungarian Army is very important. The mood is a reflection 
of our current situation, and the situation of the army 
personnel is indeed not very rosy, especially its social 
situation. I think Lorincz was right. 
  [Gulyas] In evaluating the social situation, he also said 
that the officers' mood was bad because they had not taken a 
really active role in the changes of the past four years. Do 
you agree with this, given that you have also participated in 
this process? 
  [Deak] The Hungarian Army has been a stabilizing factor in 
Hungary over the past four years. The Hungarian Army and its 
officers have done some excellent work. Our officers' corps is 
excellent, and their activity in the army has been exemplary. I 
do not think they should have played any other active role in 
the society. 
  [Gulyas] Nor did Kalman Lorincz think that; instead, he 
thought that the officers' corps had not played a sufficient 
role in shaping the issues within the army. 
  [Deak] We did everything in our power to make it possible 
for the Hungarian Army to start reorganizing and carrying out 
all the tasks that have been carried out over the past four 
years. We worked together with General Lorincz, who personally 
did some rather successful work, too. 
  [Gulyas] It was also said and it also appeared in the press 
that a third of the officers' corps were living at about the 
minimum subsistence level. Let us try to examine what 
percentage of the defense budget you are spending on wages. How 
much money can you allocate for maintaining the current level 
and how much is left for development? 
  [Deak] We have already presented these figures many times. 
I would like to present the situation from another angle. We 
spend a considerable proportion of our budget on personnel 
expenses, and another part of the budget goes for material 
expenses, so no money is left for development. For example, the 
monthly net pay of a first lieutenant is about 17,000-18,000 
forints, and I do not think that I need say anything else. 
Hoping that the bill on soldiers' legal status will be adopted, 
we think that the income of our officers, warrant officers, and 
civilian employees will increase, and we will also be able to 
give a better monthly payment to our conscripts. 
  [Gulyas] This law will probably not be passed by the present 
Parliament. Something might come out of this in September at 
the earliest. 
  [Deak] We very much hope that this will then take place in 
the autumn. I cannot say that the bill will not get to 
Parliament in the current legislative cycle. This is a decision 
for Parliament. However, if we cannot submit it to Parliament 
now, we very much hope that it will get there and will be 
adopted soon. 
  [Guyas] I read an evaluation that, with the exception of the 
MiG-29 aircraft, the army's equipment will become practically 
totally obsolete. Can we accept this evaluation? 
  [Deak] Not this way. We worked out a long-term military 
technology development concept and the government accepted it. 
There is also agreement with the parliamentary parties on this 
issue, but Hungary's capacity did not make it possible for us to 
start the implementation of this plan. We think that the 
situation of the Hungarian Army requires action. Regarding 
spare parts and certain replacements, we depend on Eastern 
imports. On the other hand, we would like to get high 
technology from the West and, most importantly, we would like to 
develop the armed forces based on a Hungarian military industry, 
something that perhaps does not yet exist. I would like to say 
that guns will be guns after the year 2000 too. We need Western 
technology mainly for our air defense, air force, electronic 
combat units, reconnaissance units, and command. We hope to 
purchase such technology when Hungary's economic performance 
permits. 
  [Gulyas] You mentioned our military industry. Many people 
complain that the Hungarian Army does not place orders, although 
there is a background and basis on which to build such an 
industry. People mention Videoton, MOM, and other enterprises. 
In your opinion, is this complaint justified? 
  [Deak] Absolutely. We need the minimal support from the 
current budget for projects that we can carry out. The Danube 
Aircraft Repair Factory has been mentioned recently. We could 
only place 400 million forints worth of orders this year. I 
think this whole situation will have to be considered 
differently. We need a Hungarian military industry in any case. 
  [Gulyas] In the long term, this country is interested in 
approaching NATO. In your opinion, to what extent can our 
joining the Partnership for Peace program help us to bring our 
technical level closer to that of NATO, because we cannot expect 
NATO to accept a country whose technical level is decades behind 
that of the NATO countries? 
  [Deak] The approach to NATO or other European alliances is a 
process. The Partnership for Peace initiative and process is a 
possibility for this approach and an opportunity to get to know 
one another. We must obviously get closer in technical systems 
too. 
  [Gulyas] What is the official duration of your appointment? 
  [Deak] My appointment lasts until the end of 1996. 
  [Gulyas] In your opinion, can you imagine a situation after 
the elections in which you will have to leave earlier than 
planned? 
  [Deak] We always carry out what the state leadership 
determines for us. We serve the army as long as we are needed 
and for as long as we can.

<F P=106> [Article by unidentified correspondent: "National </F>
Minorities and the Parties"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Hungarian Democratic Forum -- Place on the National List </H5>
  A separate chapter in the election program of the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] deals with the situation of the national 
minorities living in Hungary and the possible solutions to their 
problems. The National Committee accepted the party's Gypsy 
policy guidelines in 1992 and this has now been built into the 
current program. They stress the need to address the Gypsy 
population because, in their view, this community, the largest 
among the national minorities, is in the most difficult 
situation in the currently changing world. MDF spokesman Karoly 
Herenyi said that their program contains short and long term 
crisis management. In the short term, they want to solve the 
problem of Gypsy unemployment. The MDF considers it important 
to have the traditional Gypsy handicrafts restored. In their 
view, in the long term, the problems of the Gypsy population 
will be solved through organizing their education. Hungary's 
first Gypsy middle school established by the Ghandi foundation 
is a good example of this. 
  He called it unfortunate that the leaders of the national 
minorities enter the elections on party lists because, when they 
get into Parliament, they will have to fulfill the expectations 
of the party, then the parliamentary group, and they will only 
be able to represent their own national minority in third place. 
Two Gypsies are on the MDF's national list: Jozsef Raduly, the 
leader of a 100- member Gypsy orchestra, is in 48th place, and 
he is followed in 49th place by Florian Farkas, leader of the 
Lungo Drom Gypsy organization. 
<H5>  Alliance of Free Democrats -- Not According to the Principle </H5>
of Reciprocity 
  The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] emphasizes that the 
national minority issue cannot be made part of the election 
campaign, parliamentary deputy Istvan Szent-Ivanyi said. He 
added that this applies both to the minorities living in and 
outside Hungary. 
  Szent-Ivanyi believes that the rights of domestic minorities 
have to be guaranteed with agreements based on a broad 
consensus, and their parliamentary representation, which has not 
yet been resolved, also has to be ensured. In the SZDSZ's view, 
a mouthpiece organization for the national minorities would be 
set up by the domestic minorities forming a society that would 
delegate an ombudsman to Parliament every year from a different 
group, thus creating a rotation system. 
  A separate chapter deals with the issue of the national 
minorities in the SZDSZ's election program: Their main 
principle is that the situation of the domestic minorities 
cannot be made dependent on the situation of Hungarians living 
beyond the borders. The principle of reciprocity does not apply 
in this case. The state is obliged to ensure the rights of 
national minorities: The program recommends practical solutions 
to preserving the identity, and to ensuring education and the 
use of the native language. The party will prepare to amend the 
national minority law at all points where it has not lived up to 
expectations and they also intend to place the national minority 
financing system on new bases. 
  The Free Democrats [SZDSZ] have not consciously made an 
effort to have national minority representatives but it is no 
accident that there are many among them -- for example Antonia 
Haga, Boleszlav Pelcsinszki, Ferenc Wekler, and Tamas Freund -- 
because, owing to the SZDSZ's attitude, these people enjoy 
working in this party. 
<H5>  Hungarian Socialist Party -- Violation of the Constitution? </H5>
  According to the Socialists [MSZP], the parliamentary 
representation of the national minorities has to be resolved, 
parliamentary deputy Csaba Tabajdi said. Unfortunately, the 
Constitution has been violated in relation to the national 
minorities in the past four years. If we become the government, 
we will immediately start inter-party talks on solving this 
issue. The current situation can be remedied either through 
by-elections or when local elections are held. The national 
minority law is a means, rather than a goal, for us: A change 
should take place in the life of the national minorities, for 
example, in education. An overall government program is needed 
to achieve this. We have to set up the two 500 million forint 
funds in the budget as prescribed by the law, and this has to be 
provided for two years. The MSZP's program also includes legal 
measures against negative discrimination, and its justification 
lies in the fact that some statements have been made and acts 
have been committed to offend ethnic groups and national 
minority members in recent months. Action against discrimination 
is not laid down adequately in the Hungarian legal system. 
  Replying to whether the MSZP has any deputies belonging to 
national minorities, Tabajdi said that the Gypsy Tamas Peli and 
the ethnic Slovak Mrs. Robert Jakab are on the party's list. 
  As for an ombudsman, Tabajdi said that it does not 
substitute 
for the parliamentary representation of national minorities, 
which is their right as citizens, because an ombudsman for 
national minorities can mainly remedy legal violations, while 
the parliamentary deputies can initiate the prevention of legal 
violations or can participate in the fight against 
discrimination. 

<H5>    The Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] -- </H5>
Strong Representation Needed in the Local Governments 
  The KDNP's program has a separate chapter on the national 
minorities. According to Gyorgy Holvegyi, the KDNP's national 
minority expert, it is most important to strengthen the national 
minorities' sense of self-identity because this is the only way 
that they will be able to have representation in proportion to 
their size. Regardless of their size, the national minorities 
are due extra rights. The Christian Democrats emphasize that 
the national minority representations have to develop from the 
local self- governments to the highest level because this is the 
only way that their true level of organization and inner 
strength can be seen. In their view, the now frequent 
questioning of the legitimacy of the national minority 
federations can be avoided in this way. With the KDNP's deputy 
candidates, one's ethnic origin is not indicated but, for 
example, a number of ethnic German deputies are running in 
Baranya county in southern Transdanubia, who have established 
rather good relations with the organizations of Germany's 
Christian Democratic Union and the Austrian People's Party. 
They are expecting several visits from these sister parties 
during the campaign; however, on the basis of the electoral law, 
foreigners are always reminded that direct campaigning is not 
allowed.

<F P=106> [Article by Daniel Balan: "Colonel Mihai Lupu Is the New </F>
Chief of Counterintelligence Division"] 
  [Text] The newly appointed chief of the 
Counterintelligence Division of the Romanian Intelligence 
Service [SRI] is Colonel Mihai Lupu, a professional of the 
secret services. 
  Lupu has worked most of his career at Military Unit 0544 
(Foreign Information Directorate) both at the headquarters and 
outside the Directorate. 
  In 1983, he was appointed chief of the Directorate and 
deputy 
chief of Military Unit 0110, which was led by General Victor 
Niculicioiu. The unit, one of the most efficient in the former 
State Security Department [DSS], was in charge of 
counterintelligence in the former USSR area and the other 
socialist countries. General Niculicioiu's other deputy was 
Colonel Vasile Ionescu, who was transferred to reserve duty 
after the 1989 December events. 
  Colonel Mihai Lupu excelled in the counterintelligence 
structures because of his experience at the Foreign Information 
Directorate but also because he is considered a very 
well-informed person about the methods of the secret services in 
the former socialist countries. 
  After the establishment of the SRI, he worked in the 
counterintelligence Division and was General Gheorghe 
Diaconescu's deputy.

<F P=106> [Article by Dan Maracineanu, Daniel Capatos, and Dan Damian: </F>
"The Head of the SRI Counterintelligence Division Was Dismissed 
Because He Collected Evidence Against Virgil Magureanu"] 
  [Excerpts] The recent dismissal of the head of the SRI 
[Romanian Intelligence Service] Counterintelligence Division, 
Major General Gheorghe Diaconescu, stirred quite an uproar among 
employees who were his subordinates. As far as the reasons for 
Maj. Gen. Gheorghe Diaconescu's dismissal are concerned, 
numerous variations have been circulating, and the decision of 
the SRI Director Virgil Magureanu are explained through 
accusations of espionage against presidential counselor Marin 
Pancea. 
  Unauthorized sources at the SRI Press Bureau told us that 
the 
dismissal of the head of the SRI Counterintelligence Division is 
only settling accounts at the level of the SRI leadership. 
  In fact, it was for the first time that the reason for 
Diaconescu's dismissal has been mentioned, namely: "He was 
concealing documents of an intelligence nature." This is the 
claim made by SRI Director Virgil Magureanu before the 
Parliamentary Commission in Charge of Supervising the SRI 
Activity. 
  In reality, it seems that Diaconescu has been in possession 
of certain files according to which the SRI director, that is, 
General Virgil Magureanu, and his first deputy, Maj. Gen. Victor 
Marcu, were involved in certain crooked affairs that brought 
them a lot of money. 
  Diaconescu notified the Prosecutor's Office of Romania, 
namely, the deputy prosecutor general, Maj. Gen. Mihai Ulpiu 
Chercheleanu, head of the Military Prosecuting Magistracy and 
former prosecutor general of Romania, who sealed the file 
containing the respective documents and affirmed that he is not 
authorized to solve the respective issue. The SRI leadership 
acted immediately and, as a result of their action, the head of 
the SRI Counterintelligence Division was dismissed. 
  At the end of the talks that he held with the SRI director, 
the head of the SRI Counterintelligence Division, Diaconescu, 
warned Magureanu that it would be advisable for him not to empty 
the filing cabinet, because he is able at any time to 
reconstruct them from memory. 
<H5>  Dismissed, Hospitalized, Released </H5>
  On Friday 18 March, a Bucharest daily published an article 
according to which the former head of the Counterintelligence 
Division General Diaconescu is hospitalized at Bucharest 
Hospital No. 9, undergoing alcoholic detoxication treatment. 
More than that, the reporters of the same daily found out that 
Diaconescu was being treated in a severely guarded ward and his 
meals were brought to him from home. 
  The second day however, in the same daily that published the 
aforementioned piece of news, Diaconescu himself published a 
denial of the respective news. 
  In reality, things happened rather differently. One day 
before the "bombshell" was published, SRI Director Virgil 
Magureanu had a discussion with Diaconescu and ordered him to go 
to a hospital. The former chief of the Counterintelligence 
Division refused categorically to do so. The publication of 
that piece of news, which was sent to the paper's editorial 
office before learning about Diaconescu's reaction to 
Magureanu's suggestion, could no longer be stopped. 
  Thus, the next day, the denial was published, representing 
Diaconescu's right to respond to accusations. 
<H5>  The Documents That Were Not Reported by Maj. General </H5>
Gheorghe Diaconescu and Were Sealed by the Prosecutor's Office 
Are Compromising For the SRI 
  After having been on active duty for over 25 years at the 
head of Romanian Counterintelligence Service, Diaconescu was 
dismissed from his office by SRI Director Virgil Magureanu on 15 
March 1994. [passage omitted] 
  The dismissal of Diaconescu, head of the Counterintelligence 
Division on grounds that "he failed to inform the SRI leadership 
of the contents of certain documents" was generously offered to 
the press by the SRI leadership because they knew that the true 
reasons for this demotion will be clarified much later. 
  The fact that the head of the Counterintelligence Division 
"held back certain documents" is not unusual. Through his duty, 
Gheorghe Diaconescu could hold back not only a few but hundreds 
of documents that contained information of an operational 
nature, because the nature of his office allowed him to do that. 
  SRI sources affirm that the respective documents contained 
data with "certain aspects that might have been compromising for 
certain people in the SRI leadership." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Ralu Filip report on news conference by Virgil Magureanu, </F>
director of the Romanian Intelligence Service; in Bucharest on 
29 March: "In the Past, the KGB Coopted Many Romanian 
Politicians"] 
  [Text] In my report on the previous news conference of 
Virgil Magureanu, director of the Romanian Intelligence Service 
[SRI], I noted his desire to give a new image to the institution 
that he heads, one that should definitely distinguish it from 
what the Securitate was and meant for the majority of the 
Romanians. One cannot say that Magureanu's efforts in this 
respect are groundless, if we think of the immediate past and 
the overall context of suspicion in which the SRI was created 
and is now carrying out its activity. Therefore, on a scale of 
priorities, the problem of its public image is the SRI's number 
one problem, as Magureanu confirmed, in a way, at his latest 
news conference. 
  "I can assure you that there has been a positive change in 
the image of our institution after the re-election of its 
director and the confirmation vote in Parliament. First of all, 
the attacks against the SRI, according to the old formula that 
it was the successor of the old Securitate, have ceased, if not 
totally, at least to a large extent. Moreover, Magureanu 
believes that the SRI's image, as reflected in the national mass 
media, will further improve in the coming months. "I would like 
to assure you that we have done and will continue to do all we 
can to make this image more credible and acceptable to the 
Romanian public." 
  Tackling the subject of changes made in the territorial and 
central leaderships, Magureanu said that "this is the third 
stage of the changes." The first took place at the time of the 
SRI's creation, when "we took over only a third of the old 
Securitate." The second stage was completed in 1991, when some 
25-30 percent of the SRI personnel was laid off, since their 
services were no longer needed. The third stage began after the 
vote in Parliament, that is after Magureanu's confirmation as 
SRI director. "We are not making any purges. It is just that 
25 percent of the territorial and central command structures 
have been replaced." 
  Asked why General Gheorghe Diaconescu, the former 
counterintelligence chief, was dismissed, Magureanu tersely said 
that he was dismissed "mainly for professional reasons," without 
giving any concrete details. Similarly, Magureanu denied the 
existence of compromising files about himself. "If anyone has 
any proof against me, he should not hesitate to bring it up. I 
am keenly waiting to see any files put together against me." 
  Regarding the case of General Cristea [Major General Dumitru 
Cristea, the rector of the Higher Institute for Information 
Studies and deputy SRI director, accused of having an affair 
with a former female student], the SRI director said: "I took 
no decision in connection with General Cristea's departure from 
our structures." Calling him "a friend and colleague," 
Magureanu said the following in connection with the allegations 
of immorality against his deputy: "It may all be nothing but 
someone's concoction against someone else." 
  Asked about the Pancea case [Lieutenant General Marin 
Pancea, 
former secretary of the Supreme Defense Council, accused of 
espionage], the SRI head said that "there is no proof that 
General Pancea has worked against Romania during his posting 
abroad." Similarly, the SRI has no proof that General Pancea 
would have spied for the KGB. 
  Referring to certain documents and articles in the magazine 
ROMANIA MARE, Magureanu said that "someone is fabricating lots 
of material in our name. After the situation got out of 
control, everybody nonchalantly put the blame on the SRI. This 
is not true. We will make public the names of the people who 
leaked information and the way that the information reached the 
press, since their deeds harmed our institution." However, some 
documents are indicative of "yet unidentified leaks," which 
require further SRI internal investigations. 
  Answering the representative of Russian Television, 
Magureanu 
said that the KGB has pursued intensive activity in Romania by 
also coopting several politicians, which was also confirmed 
during his visit to Moscow. He said that these people are still 
under the scrutiny of the SRI. 
  In Magureanu's opinion, two of the dangers threatening 
Romania are the mafia-type structures operating in Russia and 
the states that used to make up the Soviet Union (structures 
which are involved in organized crime) and the Italian Mafia, 
which is laundering dirty money in Romania.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca by Marian </F>
Ivancu; place and date not given: "We Rely on the Essence of 
Our Military Doctrine"] 
  [Text] [Ivancu] Mr. Gheorghe Tinca, you are the first 
civilian in the post-war era to be appointed head of the 
Ministry of National Defense. What are the political 
implications of the appointment of a career diplomat to the 
position of defense minister? 
  [Tinca] It is obvious that the Army cannot be torn away from 
the Romanian social context. Its integration in the 
institutional system is totally different from what we 
understood as the relations between the Army and the political 
body in the past, when the Army was under the control of a 
totalitarian party. The Army institution will undoubtedly have 
links with the political structures, but they will be adjusted 
to the current pluralistic and democratic political system. 
  The main issue is to protect the Army against partisan 
political influences. It cannot afford to tailor itself to the 
political interests of any given party, thus deflecting its 
attention from the main mission, which is the defense of the 
country. 
  The civilian minister must ensure interaction between the 
Ministry of National Defense and the other state institutions or 
political forces in society. I was well received at the 
Ministry of National Defense and I feel encouraged by the people 
surrounding me. Their kindness and hope obliges me to do my 
best. The Ministry of National Defense is engaged in many 
contacts with the ministries of other countries. I could say 
that we are conducting a very intensive military diplomacy at 
this time. Therefore, the presence of a diplomat at the 
Ministry of National Defense has been considered as opportune. 
  [Ivancu] What direction is the Romanian Army taking? 
  [Tinca] A new geostrategic context has emerged, which 
requires a restructuring of the Army's missions, a readjustment 
of its equipment and training, and a process of reevaluation on 
the organizational plane. The Army must be the supreme defense 
instrument of our authentic national values, as stipulated by 
the Constitution. 
  [Ivancu] How do you estimate the defense budget? Are there 
ways and means for self-financing? 
  [Tinca] The Army's budget is relatively small. It is in 
accordance with the possibilities of our economy. I believe 
that the Army could find self-financing solutions in certain 
spheres. However, we must be careful that these measures do not 
impinge on the Army's training and equipment. 
  [Ivancu] What significance do you attach to the national 
armaments industry? 
  [Tinca] I appreciate the fact that the mass media has played 
a positive role in sensitizing public opinion on the 
difficulties faced by the national arms industry. One should 
realize that part of the budget money must go to this industry. 
One cannot have a modern army without making some effort and 
without ensuring its modernization in the technical, productive, 
and creative spheres. By proceeding cleverly and courageously, 
it is possible to ensure that production in the military sphere 
also have a positive impact on other spheres of our national 
industry. 
  [Ivancu] In what stage is the process of working out 
Romania's military doctrine? 
  [Tinca] Romania's military doctrine is being elaborated 
through the conjunction of the country's institutional and 
political factors. This document, which is being consolidated 
now, will be shortly submitted to the approval of the Country's 
Supreme Defense Council (CSAT). On the other hand, there is 
also the Integrated Concept on Romania's National Security 
(CISNR), a broader program that also includes the military 
aspect. This document is also being processed now, with a view 
to its adoption by the CSAT. The two documents will be endorsed 
by the CSAT and then submitted to parliament. 
  [Ivancu] What is the situation of Romania's military 
alliances? 
  [Tinca] Regarding the system of alliances, the situation is 
tougher here, since we do not have military alliances and no 
security guarantees either, in a military sense. However, we 
rely on the essence of our military doctrine and the essence of 
our defense policy. They are in accordance with the interest of 
many countries to have stability in our region and to be able to 
count on us in this respect. It is up to us to consolidate 
these interests and draw further sympathy and support. All our 
history proves that the essence of Romanian military policy has 
been defensive. We did not attack anyone. We only entered 
World War II because the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact obliged us to 
do so, including from the viewpoint of military honor. 
  [Ivancu] What role is played by the "Partnership for Peace" 
agreement? What is Romania's political-military orientation? 
  [Tinca] "Partnership for Peace" is no political-military 
alliance and offers no guarantees in a military sense. 
Nevertheless, it contributes to achieving stability, by granting 
equal treatment to all participants and by its convergence with 
our purely defensive military interests. It is a long process, 
which presupposes compatibility and gradual integration. We 
hope that we will also stand to benefit a bit from it, in the 
military technology and research spheres. We are interested in 
having peace around our country and in Europe and we want to 
develop relations with our neighbors, based on respect for 
international norms. Tensions and particularly conflicts are 
not good for us. 
  Our long-term political-military and economic orientation is 
in accordance with our national interests and not with set 
patterns or passing fads. The overall modernization of the 
country does not mean losing one's identity in action, but 
necessarily requires various forms of integration. 
  [Ivancu] How does the Ministry of National Defense view 
international military cooperation? 
  [Tinca] The Romanian Army is interested in modernizing its 
technology in a price-efficiency ratio as favorable as possible 
to the targets of our national defense. 
  We very much want to develop cooperation with the United 
States and other developed countries. In this respect, I would 
like to remind you that we cooperated with the developed 
countries in the sphere of defense industry before 1989, too. 
  The elimination of obstacles raised by the Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Control (COCOM) creates better 
prospects for cooperation in combat technology. We also hope 
that the "Partnership for Peace" agreement will entail positive 
developments in this respect, too. 
  [Ivancu] What is Romania's riposte efficacy and capability? 
  [Tinca] There is no reason to fear that the Army is not 
prepared, that it is hesitating or overwhelmed by difficulties, 
or that it cannot fulfill its basic duty of defending Romania's 
sovereignty and territorial integrity. We, like others, have 
problems and, unfortunately, have also had some accidents. But 
it would be wrong to draw hasty conclusions about the combat 
capacity and determination of the Romanian Army. It is not bad 
that these problems are brought to the fore in the media. The 
public becomes acquainted with our problems and thus more aware 
of the Army's needs. 
  [Ivancu] What, in your opinion, are the prospects of the 
Romanian Army? 
  [Tinca] I hope that the Army will make substantial progress 
in its modernization. For this year, I would like the Army's 
operative capability to be maintained and improved within the 
limits of the funds allocated to us from the budget. I -- and 
not just me -- am convinced that greater emphasis should be 
placed on the social protection of military personnel. It would 
be unjust to leave the soldiers -- who love their country both 
in good and hard times -- outside the current concerns with 
easing up the difficulties of the transition. However, I 
believe that now, when the Army is in full swing of the reform 
process, the civilian society should clearly indicate that it 
understands the Army's difficulties, including the social 
problems of the Army's military or civilian personnel.

<F P=106> [Simona Popescu article: "The Vacaroiu Government Is </F>
Compromised for the Majority of Romanians"] 
  [Text] The day when President Ion Iliescu signed the 
document pardoning his colleagues from the Communist Party, IMAS 
[opinion poll institute] published the results of the opinion 
poll initiated by the Soros Foundation For an Open Society. 
Probably sensing a decline in his popularity, President Iliescu 
probably hurried to do what was possible for the former members 
of the Political Executive Committee. As could be noted, the 
Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] recorded a decline 
compared with September 1992; only 24 percent opted for it 
while, according to IMAS, the Democratic Convention [CDR] has 
recorded a tremendous rise, winning approximately 35 percent of 
the population's options. 
  CDR President Emil Constantinescu is the most favored leader 
of the opposition, winning 49 percent support; thus he surpassed 
Nicolae Manolescu [president of the Civic Alliance Party] (33 
percent), Sergiu Cunescu [president of Social Democratic Party] 
(26 percent), and Petre Roman [president of the Democratic 
Party] (41 percent). With 55 percent of the options, Adrian 
Nastase [executive president of the Social Democracy Party of 
Romania and president of the Chamber of Deputies] is a dangerous 
opponent for President Ion Iliescu (44 percent). If Ion Iliescu 
decides for a new mandate, he is not going to let Adrian Nastase 
(who has firmly taken over the leadership of the unrelenting 
faction within the PDSR) run in the future elections, and thus a 
strong conflict could develop within the ruling party. There 
are signs that the president of the Chamber of Deputies is 
impatient to get to the top. 
  The affirmation by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu that the 
standard of living has improved is contradicted by the opinion 
poll results. If 45 percent affirm that the current incomes of 
the family are enough just for what is strictly necessary, while 
27 percent think that incomes are not even enough for that much, 
only 2 percent are coping with everything they need, without any 
savings. The government's activity, its economic policy, its 
anti-corruption measures, the level of wages, the standard of 
living, and its actions against crime generate massive 
dissatisfaction among the population. 
  The hope that a completely compromised government will be 
able in the future to take the country out of the economic 
crisis, that it will be able to do something to improve the 
standard of living has been shattered.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 3 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Foreign 
Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said on Sunday that he received new 
encouragement in Belarus that Yugoslavia is not alone despite 
its isolation and the international sanctions, and that the 
circle of countries which are showing solidarity with its 
justified objectives and resistance to outside pressure, 
sanctions and isolation, is spreading. 
  "The talks we had in Minsk covered all the aspects of the 
Yugoslav crisis, primarily the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina," 
Jovanovic told Radio Belgrade upon his return from the first 
official visit to Belarus since it became independent. 
  "Both sides underscored identical interests that the crisis 
in the space of former Yugoslavia end as soon as possible, that 
Yugoslavia recover its legitimate rights in international 
relations," Jovanovic set out. 
  Speaking About the talks in Moscow, which he visited 
earlier, 
Jovanovic said that he had agreed with Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev that developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina were 
marked by positive changes, but that there were still serious 
situations which made it imperative for both countries to be 
very active and to collaborate even more closely. 
  It was underscored that Russia had played an important 
positive role in the resolving of recent crisis situations, but 
that it can have an even more active role in removing the 
obstacles to peace, of which the biggest is the continued 
maintenance of the sanctions against Yugoslavia, Jovanovic said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sulejman Ugljanin, chairman of the Muslim </F>
National Council for Sandzak, by Amir Hodzic; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Hodzic] Mr. Ugljanin, due to the communications 
blockade and other blockades in Bosnia-Herzegovina, we are not 
in a position to found out more about the real state of affairs 
in Sandzak. This is a chance to find out from you about what is 
really going on there. 
  [Ugljanin] The situation in Sandzak is identical to that in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina before the war. There are mass arrests of 
Muslims, Muslim houses are searched, criminal charges are 
brought against them. Generally, this is a form of a refined 
state terror. It is nothing new, since with the start of the 
war, that is, the Serbian-Montenegrin aggression on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, a campaign of terror was launched 
simultaneously against the Muslims in Sandzak. 
  You know that since the start of the aggression on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina some 74,000 Muslims, women and children, 
adults who were expelled from Bosnia have passed through 
Sandzak. Some stayed a month, some two months, some stayed a 
year, and there are still some 16,000 of them there in Sandzak 
in our homes, who live with us. Apart from everything that 
happened to them [changes thought] their fears are doubled 
because they have experienced something terrible and now they 
are expecting even worse to come. 
  Serbia and Montenegro, you know, planned the ethnic 
cleansing 
of Muslim and Croatian people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the ethnic 
cleansing of the Muslim people of Sandzak, and the ethnic 
cleansing of the Albanian people of Kosovo. They are doing just 
that now. It is obvious. Now it is up to us to prevent that 
and have our status justly resolved. You might have heard, the 
whole world knows, that we as the national council called on the 
people to boycott the elections because of the 
Serbian-Montenegrin aggression on Bosnia- Herzegovina, and not 
one of our people voted in the Serbian and Montenegrin elections 
on 31 May 1992 or 20 December 1992, and the third time [words 
indistinct] that we do not have to participate in elections in 
the country that has attacked our mother state 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The people completely boycotted the 
elections for the third time on 19 December 1993. After that, 
when Serbian-Montenegrin authorities realized that the people 
are united and determined, that they are nationally aware -- the 
people stuck by the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] -- then the 
police was sent by the politically defeated Serbia and 
Montenegro, and -- you must have heard -- the entire political 
leadership of the SDA was arrested. Hamo Hadzic, SDA chairman 
for Montenegro, was arrested, so was Rasim [words indistinct]; 
the entire leadership was arrested between 25 to 31 January this 
year. 
  We have been publishing the statements of the lawyers who 
defend them -- a group of Montenegrin lawyers is defending them 
-- and the statements issued by the lawyers, the statements 
about the arrests given by our people in those prisons: that is 
a tragedy -- one can barely comprehend how a man can be such an 
animal toward another man. In this case, it has gone even 
beyond inhumanity. The attitude of the Serbian and Montenegrin 
authorities toward the Muslims in Sandzak is identical to the 
attitude in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The only difference is that we 
do not have the shelling.

<F P=106> [Report by Haluk Geray: "A Secret Message From Serbia to </F>
Foreign Minister Cetin"] 
  [Excerpt] Bucharest--Serbia has urged Ankara to agree to 
hold high-level diplomatic talks. Serbia's call came a few 
hours after UN officials asked for 2,700 Turkish troops for 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The message was secretly conveyed to 
Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin in Bucharest. It has been 
reported that Ambassador Bilgin Unan, deputy under secretary at 
the Turkish Foreign Ministry, may visit Serbia in the next few 
days. 
  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin accompanied President Suleyman 
Demirel to Romania. He held an unscheduled meeting with Foreign 
Minister Teodor Malescanu yesterday. Foreign Ministry sources 
have said that Malescanu conveyed a secret message to Cetin 
during their meeting. 
  In a statement to CUMHURIYET, Hikmet Cetin confirmed that he 
received a message. He stressed: "They wish to establish a 
high-level dialogue if necessary." 
  The Foreign Ministry circles have said that the message 
informed Cetin that Serbia wishes to establish a high-level 
dialogue with Turkey. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Miroslav Mikuljanac: "A Stall on the Brotherly </F>
Soil"] 
  [Text] The Russians have returned. Two Russian 
parliamentary delegations are traveling around Serbia, taking 
stock of the situation and making promises. The larger 
15-member delegation is visiting officials without much pomp, 
keeping company with the communists, and, at least publicly, 
does not seem to have any major ambitions. The other 
five-member delegation has been visiting all the Serbian lands 
in the company of local non-parliamentary right-wing parties 
with considerable media attention, promising everything that 
could please the Serbian ear. 
  To make matters more confusing, the smaller delegation 
actually represents the forces that won the majority at the last 
elections but not the power. It consists of two vice presidents 
of Aleksandr [as published] Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia, one communist (an astronaut), and two 
independent deputies, one of which is a veteran from 
Afghanistan. The malicious people would also add that they only 
lack a fire eater and a trapeze artist. Those who are more 
cautious know that the party representatives that won the 
majority of the several millions of votes in Russia should not 
be compared to a circus, regardless of the reception held for 
them and their preferred style of appearance. 
  However, the treatment that this small group from a large 
country is receiving in Serbia is truly worldly. The media 
follow them carefully, halls packed with people greet them with 
ovations, they have comfortable cars, and allegedly an airplane 
as well. If only the official authorities would have paid a 
little more attention to them.... They are much more prepared 
for public appearances than their colleagues who, equally well 
received, have visited "the brotherly Serbian land" in previous 
years. Now they know precisely what we need and what would be 
good to promise. 
  The most active member of this group, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy 
(the first man after Zhirinovskiy), is a decent stand in for his 
chief. "You are the first line of our defense," he said in 
Pirot. "Russia is a great market for your products," he 
announced in Bijelo Polje. "We will stop the supply of gas to 
Europe and bring it to you," he promised in Zemun. To the 
ecstatic Serbs in Pristina, he explained that Kosovo is "an old 
Serbian land and that a plan for its defense and protection is 
being prepared in Russia together with four brigades of 
soldiers." 
  Besides all the nice promises, there are also some other 
ambitions: "Our visit is a sign that Russia is returning to the 
Balkans and that we will never leave it again," was stated in 
Belgrade. Beside the four brigades for Kosovo, naval support 
from Boka has also been proposed, while the aforementioned gas 
would arrive at the Serbian borders in tanks, it was said. 
  As opposed to the larger delegation, this smaller one is 
pronouncedly anti-Yeltsin in its orientation; perhaps here lies 
the reason why the official authorities, at least at first 
glance, do not ascribe much importance to it. However, knowing 
that the host of the five-member group is the Serbian National 
Renewal party (which has been accused for years of having close 
relations with the police) and that (unconfirmed) Braca Karic 
(which also helped the Serbian Radical Party until Seselj's 
break with Milosevic) is financing their visit, things look a 
little different. 
  The chronologists of political events, prone to fantasy, 
have 
a simple explanation: The Serbian authorities need support, 
even if only verbal. However, it is not appropriate to 
officially host the most fervent of Yeltsin's opponents at the 
same time. On the other hand, Zhirinovskiy needs money for the 
realization of his visions outlined in the Last Jump to the 
South (a book promoted in Zemun during the visit) in order to 
carry out the actions of matching the executive power to the 
electoral results. Belgrade, in this sense, represents a 
crossroad on the way to the Indian Ocean, and a crossroad 
without stalls is not much of an attraction. 
<H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5>
<H5>  We Only Need Love </H5>
  As opposed to Zhirinovskiy's visit, when Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia President Mirko Jovic and Zeljko Raznjatovic 
Arkan arrived at the reception with Patriarch Pavle unannounced 
and with the help of their elbows, the visit to the Serbian 
church head the day before yesterday passed much more 
peacefully. Witnesses emphasize that the patriarch was much 
more balanced than the hosts of the Russian delegation and that 
to the announcement of all-encompassing brotherly aid, he 
diplomatically replied that the biggest assistance that could be 
given to Serbia is -- love. 
  However, incidents were not in short supply. At the news 
conference, Vengerovskiy said to a correspondent of the Russian 
NOVOSTI that upon his return to the country, he will check his 
report and that "perhaps there will be no need for him to return 
from Yugoslavia at all." [sentence as published]

  [Text] Zoran Djindjic, president of the Democratic Party, 
today held a news conference. Srdjan Savic reports: 
  [Savic] The Serbs in the Srpska republic were absolutely 
correct when they decided not to join the Croatian-Muslim 
federation, because when, in the second stage, a confederation 
with Croatia is established, the border would be on the Drina 
river. This is the view of the Democratic Party. The 
international community has shown discernment for the 
middle-of-the-road solution that could lead to peace. However, 
the lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia would very shortly 
demotivate extreme circles among Croats and Muslims, and this 
would be more effective than the peace talks, Djindjic said. The 
next move should be the recognition of the equal status of the 
Serbian Republic, and the issue of the final demarcation would 
be settled later. The leader of the Democrats has endorsed the 
negotiations between the representatives of the republic of 
Serbian Krajina and Croatia in Zagreb, stressing that the 
territorial status quo should be accepted and that more emphasis 
should be placed on the undisputed points. Zoran Djindjic said 
that a Democratic Party delegation will visit Russia between 4 
and 7 April to explain the national position of Serbs in 
discussions with the representatives of the state Duma and the 
democratically orientated parties. Commenting on the situation 
in our country, Djindjic said that the program of economic 
stabilization is entering the second stage, that the first stage 
has resulted in healthy currency and that the dinar will 
collapse in its contact with the ailing economy without an 
effective control of business activities.

  [Text] [Announcer] The Serbian police have started a new 
wave of repression against Albanians in Kosova. Reports confirm 
dozens of arrests and cases of maltreatment, as well as many 
raided homes. Here is a telephone report by Mehmet Haziri from 
Prishtina: 
  [Haziri] The raiding of Albanian families in Kosova under 
the pretext of searching for arms has intensified in the last 
few months. Punitive expeditions have been more frequent in the 
Llape and Drenice regions. 
  During the last five months alone, under the pretext of 
searching for arms, Serbian police raided 530 Albanian families 
in the Podujeve commune, 230 of which were raided as of 1 March. 
  The Information Commission of the Kosova Democratic Alliance 
[LDK] branch in Podujeve informs that during March, 
approximately 50 persons were brutally maltreated at the city 
police station, while 80 others received summons to appear at 
the police station and hand over weapons. 
  LDK activists and Albanian teachers were targets of the 
police. Lessons were interrupted many times due to police 
intervention, while many elementary school headmasters were 
summoned to the police station. 
  The LDK also reports that 22 peasants from Strovci in 
Vushtrri were summoned to the police station for such talks 
under the pretext of handing over weapons. 
  Raids and harassments have been reported in the villages of 
Skenderaj, Gjilan, Prishtina, Kline, and Prizren communes. In 
Qubrel in Skenderaj, Serbian police attempted to recruit four 
Albanian youths for the Serbian Army. The Albanians consider 
the Serbian Army foreign and did not respond to the recruiting 
summons.

<F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic] </F>
  [Text] According to the reconnaissance-intelligence reports 
of the special units of the East Bosnian Operations Group of the 
Army of Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Gorazde Ministry 
of Internal Affairs, the Serbo-chetnik aggressor is going to 
launch one of the fiercest attacks on Gorazde today. The attack 
is expected from the direction of Foca and (?Prata). 
  Yesterday and overnight, the aggressor brought in 30 more 
armored vehicles along with well-armed and fresh troops 
consisting of members of the Herzegovina Corps, local chetniks, 
and Russian and Romanian mercenaries. 
  Meanwhile, the Serbo-chetnik aggressor is continuing the 
intensive artillery and infantry attacks on the defense lines of 
the Gorazde defenders and civilian targets in this area. The 
courageous fighters of our army last night repelled a strong 
attack on Popovaca by drugged murderers. The attack lasted more 
than two hours. In this fierce fighting, the chetniks suffered 
major losses. One defender of Gorazde was slightly wounded. 
  This morning, the chetniks carried out one of the fiercest 
artillery-infantry attacks on Lastan, the 13th attack since the 
beginning of the offensive on Gorazde. Even though every single 
inch of territory in this region is literally being turned over 
by the destructive power of high-caliber projectiles, the 
fighters of Lastan and all other defense lines are saying that 
the ideas of war criminal [Radovan] Karadzic will never 
materialize in this region and that this region will always 
remain free 
  This is Enes Musovic reporting for Bosnia-Herzegovina radio 
and television from the the Gorazde region press center.

<F P=106> [Mladen Bosnjak report on the statements by </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Raymond 
Flynn, U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, in Sarajevo on 1 April -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Bosnjak] Mr. Silajdzic stressed at the 
beginning of his statement that the arrival of Raymond Flynn, 
U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, again confirmed the interest of 
Bill Clinton and Holy Father Pope John Paul II in the situation 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Then he said: 
  [Silajdzic] As for me, unfortunately I had to tell the 
ambassador about some things that do not sound very optimistic, 
generally speaking, and asked him to convey this to the highest 
authorities. What I said is that the continuation of the peace 
process is endangered with the latest attacks on Gorazde -- a 
massive offensive is under way, and many people are being 
killed, innocent people; with the attacks on Bihac, and the 
ethnic cleansing, the new wave of ethnic cleansing -- against 
which President Izetbegovic protested yesterday -- that is 
taking place in Bosnian Krajina. 
  Today I received information from the chairman of the 
International Red Cross, responsible for central Bosnia and 
Bosnian Krajina, who said that we have to either protect the 
6,000 people in Prijedor and the surrounding area or move them 
out. Their lives are in danger. This is very bad news. 
  In connection with Gorazde, the international community is 
silent about it. A zone that has been proclaimed protected by a 
UN Security Council resolution is under attack. An offensive is 
underway, and many people have been killed. I am certain that 
the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] in Bosnia-Herzegovina can 
follow the development of the situation, they can see it on 
their television here in Sarajevo, and their command knows very 
well what is going on. The United Nations has been informed; 
the Security Council has been informed. However, there is no 
reaction. The situation is repeating itself, where the 
aggressor is allowed to do almost anything he wants. I will 
repeat, the continuation of the peace negotiations has been 
seriously endangered with these latest activities by the 
aggressor in the region of Gorazde and Bihac, and the ethnic 
cleansing of the remaining non-Serbian population in Bosnian 
Krajina. 
  [Bosnjak] Ambassador Flynn expressed the concern and the 
understanding of the American people for the suffering of the 
people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and spoke of the appeals and 
prayers of the Holy Father for the return of peace. [passage

  [Text] Reviewing the grave situation in the republic which 
resulted from the continued aggression and ethnic cleansing on 
the occupied territories of the republic, our country's 
government, at today's session -- Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic 
presided -- adopted the following statement: 
  Two years have passed since the aggression on the sovereign 
and internationally recognized Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
The consequences of this aggression are over 200,000 killed and 
some 1,250,000 refugees and displaced persons. Unfortunately, 
the Serbian occupying forces are continuing the process of 
ethnic cleansing with relentless intensity, particularly in the 
areas of Banja Luka, Prijedor, Stipovo, Jajce, and other parts 
of the Bosnian Krajina. 
  The international public is acquainted with the dramatic 
news 
of murders and other forms of pressure against the non-Serbian 
population and with preparations for the evacuation of the 
remaining non-Serbian population. The government uses this 
occasion to lodge an energetic protest because of the fact that 
the international community is not showing a readiness to stop 
the aggressor in this fascist endeavor. 
  We call on the United Nations, the European Union, and the 
United States to do everything in their power to prevent the 
conclusion of the process of ethnic cleansing and that all 
citizens are granted the elementary conditions for safety of 
property and personal safety, and are guaranteed all other human 
liberties and rights established by international treaties and 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Constitution. We call on all states, 
signatories of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment 
of the Crime of Genocide from 1949 to carry out immediately all 
the obligations pursuant to this convention. 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina Government believes that the 
international community has failed to react to the 
Serbo-Montenegrin aggressor's attacks at Gorazde and Bihac. 
Since these attacks are attacks on protected areas as 
stipulated by UN Resolution 824, the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Government has taken measures with the goal of activating the 
mechanisms of the UN Security Council in order to stop these 
attacks and protect the civilian population. The government 
maintains the position that the aggressor is calling into 
question the continuation of peace negotiations and that the 
international community is obliged to take all measures to stop 
the attacks and create conditions for the continuation of the 
peace process.

  [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, 
Deputy Prime Minister Edib Bukvic, and Foreign Minister Irfan 
Ljubijankic received Mohammad Zarebi, ambassador of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, and held long and friendly talks with him 
today. 
  Our government expressed its gratitude to the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and its people for the aid that this country 
has given to the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina at its most 
difficult times. This is said in a Ministry of Information 
statement. 
  The talks also concerned economic cooperation between the 
two 
countries. Ambassador Zarebi gave assurances of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran's readiness to influence the process of 
distribution of investments in Iran to businesses from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina under favorable conditions, and the 
distribution of funds for the revival of the economic potential 
of our country. 
  Tatjana-Ljuic Mijatovic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency, also received Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Zarebi and 
his associates. The talks, which concerned further activities 
aimed at activating the initiative for a peaceful solution to 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina war tragedy, were attended by Presidency 
member Mirko Pejanovic, who is also chairman of the Serbian 
Civic Council; Ljubomir Berberovic, deputy chairman of the 
Serbian Civil Council, and Rajko Zivkovic, secretary of this 
council. 
  Miro Lazovic, chairman of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly, 
received Mohammad Zarebi, ambassador of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran to Bosnia-Herzegovina, today. During long and friendly 
talks, Lazovic informed the Iranian ambassador of the views of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly, and the efforts of professional 
legal bodies to establish peace in the country. 
  The Iranian ambassador expressed his satisfaction with the 
establishment of peace between Bosniaks and Croats, saying that 
this was an important step toward reaching a lasting and just 
peace throughout the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Zarebi 
expressed his government's hope that Karadzic's Serbs would join 
the peace process based on the Washington document, which would 
preserve Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent and sovereign 
state within its internationally recognized borders. He 
conveyed the support of his country for all peace efforts on the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia. The Iranian ambassador 
expressed his hope that the embassy of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran would open in Sarajevo as soon as possible.

  [Text] [Announcer] Today Sulejman Ugljanin, the chairman of 
the Muslim National Council of Sandzak [Muslimansko Nacionalno 
Vijece Sandzaka], held a news conference during which he spoke 
of the difficult position of the Muslim nation in Sandzak and 
the need to solve the national problem of the Sandzak Muslims 
within the framework of the international conference on the 
former Yugoslavia. Senada Cumurovic has a report. 
  [Begin recording] [Cumurovic] In the beginning of his news 
conference, Sulejman Ugljanin noted certain inconsistencies in 
the work of the international conference on the former 
Yugoslavia which is solving the national problem of Croats and 
Serbs globally, while only the Bosnian national problem has been 
reduced to solving the status of the Bosnians within the borders 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina alone. The aim of his visit is to alert 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina parliament and the international 
community to this problem. 
  [Ugljanin] You all know that the policy of the Muslim 
National Council of Sandzak is to solve the Yugoslav crisis by 
agreement and by peaceful means. The priority of our policy is 
a sovereign and unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina and a special status 
for Sandzak. A special status for Sandzak is the only way to 
prevent the (?cruel) ethnic cleansing of the Sandzak Bosnian 
people from that area. 
  [Cumurovic] The establishment of a special status for 
Sandzak 
implies the demilitarization of Sandzak, the right to display 
Muslim national symbols, education that honors the identity of 
the Muslim nation, and forming their own assembly and 
government. Explaining the difficult situation in Sandzak, 
Ugljanin pointed out the fact that the entire political 
leadership of the Muslim nation in Sandzak has been arrested, 
precisely at the time when the national problem of the Muslim 
nation is being solved. 
  [Ugljanin] I will briefly tell you that since the beginning 
of the Serbian and Croatian aggression against 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, eight Muslims were killed in 1992, [words 
indistinct] and 181 Muslims have gone missing. Around 60 houses 
were destroyed by planted bombs, as well as almost 1,000 
business premises, four mosques, and so on. Several thousand 
houses belonging to Sandzak Muslims (?have been attacked) by 
Serbs and Montenegrins in cooperation with the Serbian and 
Montenegrin police. 
  [Cumurovic] This tragic position of the Muslim people in 
Sandzak has led to the following demand by the Muslim National 
Council: 
  [Ugljanin] To urgently send CSCE observers, that is, a 
permanent CSCE mission with greater authority than the previous 
one had, to send UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], the UN forces 
for the prevention of conflicts, and to release the arrested 
political leaders of the Muslim people. We have placed this 
request with the European Twelve, the Geneva conference, and the 
United Nations, and I would like to repeat it during this news 
conference. 
  [Cumurovic] Answering the question of whether an armed 
attack 
on Sandzak by Serbs and Montenegrins was possible, Ugljanin said: 
  [Ugljanin] You know that 29,000 members of the 
Serb-Montenegrin Army are deployed in Sandzak on top of their 
peace time troops, that Muslim houses are searched every day, 
mainly at night between midnight and 0600 in the morning. 
Family members are harassed, our people are arrested. [Passage 
indistinct] Now, when the Bosnian crisis is over, we are 
expecting an open Serbian and Montenegrin aggression against 
[word indistinct]. 
  [Cumurovic] Sulejman Ugljanin also presented the following 
figures: 69,000 residents of Muslim nationality have left 
Sandzak in the past three years, and 59 villages bordering with 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have been ethnically cleansed. All this 
points to the need to solve the status of Sandzak, but not 
within the framework of Serbia and Montenegro, but within the 
framework of the international conference on the former 
Yugoslavia, it was said at the news conference today. [end

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 1 (AFP) -- Seventeen Moslems and two 
Croats have been murdered in the Serb-controlled western Bosnian 
town of Prijedor in the past two days, Kris Janowski, spokesman 
for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said Friday [1 April]. 
  Janowski said he had received the figures from the Moslem 
humanitarian organisation Merhamet, but that a UNHCR official 
who had visited the town Friday said the figures were "probably 
right."

  [Text] Kris Janovski, spokesman for the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] in Sarajevo, presented today, 
as he put it: Alarming news from Banja Luka on the 
intensification of the campaign of terror against the Bosniak 
people in that part of Bosnia. Over the last few days in 
Prijedor at least 7 Bosniak civilians were killed in retaliation 
for casualties the aggressor's army suffered in central Bosnia. 
The civilians were murdered after bodies of six of the 
aggressor's policemen, killed in the fighting around Doboj, were 
returned to Prijedor. All the Bosniaks have had their telephones 
cut off. The UNHCR was first informed of this terrible crime by 
a Muslim woman hiding in the house of her Serb neighbor. 
  [Word indistinct] is continuing in Sanski Most, where Serb 
refugees are moved into the homes of Bosniaks, Kris Janovski 
said. Exposed to constant pressure and unbearable living 
conditions, the Bosniaks are simply forced to leave their homes. 
Some 850 Serbs, refugees from Zenica, Zepce, and Zavidovici 
have recently arrived in Banja Luka, and they are accommodated 
through the expulsion of Bosniaks.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 3 (TANJUG) -- President of the 
Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.) Radovan Karadzic on Sunday ordered 
legal proceedings against and severe punishment of persons who 
have been trying to create chaos and discredit the civilian 
authorities of the Serb state. 
  Karadzic gave strict orders for the investigation in 
Prijedor, a town in the western R.S., to be stepped up and all 
persons responsible for the latest developments in that town to 
be arrested, a statement released by the presidential office 
said. 
  Karadzic stressed that the enemies of the R.S. were 
intensifying attacks on the republic's independence and 
sovereignty in an effort to create chaos, discredit the civilian 
authorities of the R.S., and thwart the functioning of the Serb 
state, the statement, a copy of which has been sent to TANJUG, 
said. 
  The R.S. president gave strict orders to all civilian and 
military authorities to offer all necessary assistance to the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). 
  All perpetrators of the crimes will be tried and most 
severely punished before the eyes of the international public, 
Karadzic said. 
  R.S. Prime Minister Vladimir Lukic on Saturday sharply 
protested because of an UNHCR report on an alleged deterioration 
of the position of Muslims and Croats in the region of the 
Bosnian Serb town of Banja Luka. 
  UNHCR officials uncritically drew up the report solely on 
the 
basis of statements by the local bishop and mufti and 
representatives of the Catholic humanitarian organization 
Caritas, and failed even to mention the criminal charges brought 
against individuals engaged in criminal activities of damaging 
the property of Muslims and Croats in the Banja Luka region, 
Lukic said in a letter sent to the Zagreb-based UNHCR 
representative. 
  The UNHCR report, which accused the R.S. authorities of 
allegedly not respecting the rights of the minority Muslim and 
Croat populations, was aimed at discrediting the R.S. 
authorities and attracting the attention of the international 
community and media, the R.S. prime minister said in the letter.

  [Text] Here is what Radovan Karadzic, president of the 
Serbian republic, said about the end of the war and the lifting 
of sanctions. Responding to our correspondent Dragan Colovic's 
question as to what the end of the war and a successful 
conclusion to the peace negotiations would depend on, Dr. 
Karadzic said: 
  [Begin recording] [Karadzic] I believe that now -- as in the 
past -- everything will depend on the international community. 
It is clear that Yugoslavia has been destroyed not so much 
because of the hostilities within it, but because of certain 
needs outside of it, primarily Germany's and, lately, the United 
States' need to destroy Yugoslavia and create tensions in this 
area. We know for a fact that the foreign factor has been 
putting off a political solution because an end to the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina did not suit it. Various interests are 
involved, from the military- industrial interests of the United 
States and the NATO forces, to Germany's and France's need to 
create European forces, and the U.S. need to destabilize Europe 
and thus postpone its unification. 
  If the United States has now really taken a firm stand 
regarding assistance in solving the crisis, the war will end. 
You have seen that both the Croats and Muslims respond with a 
high degree of submission to U.S. demands. If, however, 
something changes and the United States finds that it still 
needs the crisis in this area, the war will go on until the main 
international factors -- primarily the United States -- no 
longer want it. 
  [Colovic] How would you comment on the latest statement by 
Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev that we are closer to the 
lifting of sanctions thanks to the moves of the Serbian side, 
primarily the Bosnian Serbs, who -- as he said -- are a 
constituent nation and equal party. 
  [Karadzic] I think that during the entire course of the 
conference [on the Former Yugoslavia], from the beginning of the 
war to the present, the Serbian side has been the most 
cooperative side at every level -- humanitarian, political, and 
military. We proclaimed endless unilateral cease-fires; we 
simply released numerous prisoners; we accepted many political 
solutions that might well have affected our vital interests. 
After all, we accepted the calming of Sarajevo, the 
pacification of Sarajevo; we accepted observers' missions and 
separating forces throughout Bosnia- Herzegovina; to put it 
succinctly, Kozyrev is finally right. The Serbian side has 
invested immense efforts into ending the war and lifting the 
sanctions. I hope that all this has finally reached the 
consciousness of the main forces and I hope that they will be 
able to present the accomplishments of the Serbian side in 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serbian republic that is, as 
justification for the relaxation or lifting of the sanctions, 
perhaps even prior to the commencement of new negotiations. We 
requested that new negotiations not be initiated before we 
achieve an equal position, which presupposes either the 
suspension or lifting of the sanctions. 
  [Colovic] However, the suspension and lifting of sanctions 
presupposes the positive attitude of all those who insisted on 
them the most, namely the United States. What are your 
impressions after the talks with Charles Redman? 
  [Karadzic] I believe that we have indicated to the U.S. 
envoy what our base goal is and what we must achieve at any 
price. We have also opened the possibility -- after the 
recognition on which we insist -- perhaps linking up with others 
through various connections. We suppose that we could allow 
ourselves some kind of link with the Croatian-Muslim Federation 
under the condition that we be recognized in the meantime and 
that we have links with Yugoslavia, although we believe that our 
priority is unification with Serbia, and we shall insist on this 
priority. If we are forced to temporarily give up on our main 
goal, we are ready to be flexible and accept certain 
intermediate solutions. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The Serbian aggressor is continuing his 
offensive on the Bihac region on this 57th day of fighting in 
this part of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Karadzic's terrorists last 
night continued artillery attacks on Bihac and the surrounding 
area. Civilians in this UN protected zone are still being 
targeted. [passage omitted] 
  The lines of separation with the paramilitary formations of 
the so-called Cazin autonomous region were not quiet either. The 
separatists are constantly opening small-arms fire and provoking 
clashes. They are still shelling the (?Prusce) area in the Cazin

<F P=106> [Report by SRNA journalist Mirjana Kusnik] </F>
  [Text] Charles Redman, the U.S. President's special envoy 
for the former Yugoslavia, and Radovan Karadzic, president of 
the Srpska republic, met in Pale today. In a statement for SRNA 
after the meeting, Redman pointed out that he had come to reach 
political and territorial arrangements, albeit without concrete 
offers. We are making efforts to solve territorial borders in 
Bosnia in a new way, because after the creation of the 
Muslim-Croatian federation, we want to hear what the Serb side 
intends to do, Redman said and added that borders are a great 
problem that will not be easy to solve. These are extremely 
great problems as the war has been waged for two years already 
and I do not think that the situation will improve soon, Redman 
said. 
  Karadzic reiterated the readiness of the Serbian side to 
(?support) every proposal for solving the crisis in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina which would not be contrary to the interests 
of the Serbian people. 
  Redman and Karadzic hailed the efforts Russia, the European 
Union, and the United Nations made with a way to solving the 
crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Speaking about the ceasing of clashes between the Croats and 
the Muslims, Redman said that a united Croat-Muslim army will 
probably be formed, as, in his opinion, this is the best 
solution to establishing peace between Croats and Muslims on 
their territories. 
  This afternoon in the Muslim part of Sarajevo, Redman will 
meet Alija Izetbegovic and convey to him the stands of the 
leadership of the Srpska republic.

  [Excerpt] The Bihac region tried to heal its wounds today 
after almost two months of the Serb aggressor's offensive. 
However, members of Abdic's paramilitary units stepped in to 
make up for somewhat lower intensity of attacks launched by 
Karadzic's terrorists. The chetniks began by launching an 
artillery attack on the defense lines on the Grmusa-Srbljani 
plateau on the Bihac part of the front. 
  Civilians were the victims of this madness again today. A 
16-year-old girl was killed by a sniper shot. Abdic's 
paramilitary forces, reinforced by their chetnik allies, resumed 
their destructive attacks. On this occasion they shelled 
industrial facilities in the Cazin municipality belonging to the 
meat industry Puran in Pjanici. These facilities were one of 
the most important parts of Agrokomerc [food processing company 
founded by Abdic] in the Cazin municipality before the war broke 
out. The autonomists also attempted infantry breakthroughs in 
the Pecigrad area. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cajnice, 1 Apr (TANJUG) -- Following a short 
overnight lull, fighting in the triangle between Cajnice, Foca 
and Gorazde continued unabated around 0500 today, even though an 
attempted Muslim breakthrough launched from Gorazde on Tuesday 
and Wednesday ended in complete failure, the command of the Serb 
forces announced. The command said that the fiercest fighting 
was in the region of Gradina hill. These are the fiercest 
Serb-Muslim clashes in this area since the beginning of the war, 
with both sides using all types of weapons. The surrounding 
mountains have been ringing with deafening explosions and 
incessant shooting. 
  Two Serb fighters were killed in almost hand-to-hand 
fighting 
yesterday. According to Serb Command estimates, about 100 
members of the Muslim units have been put out of action.

  [Text] Banja Luka, April 3 (TANJUG) -- The Bosnian Moslem 
army has stepped up attacks on Serb defence lines in the area of 
Doboj in the north of the former Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina while their attacks in the areas of Gorazde, 
Cajnice and Foca in eastern Bosnia are becoming less intensive 
after a defeat of their troops in the area. 
  Bosnian Serb army sources said on Sunday evening that the 
strongest Moslem assaults had been reported in the area of Mount 
Ozren, south of Doboj, where they had carried out several 
infantry attacks on Sunday morning before being forced to 
retreat with major casualties in their ranks. 
  The Moslems fired ten shells on Doboj and continued to bring 
in fresh troops to the Teslic battlefront in the south. 
  As part of an all-out offensive on the territory of the 
Bosnian Serb republic, Moslems have been continually shelling 
Doboj over the past five days, causing great damage to the town. 
  Moslem units continued attacks in the area of Trebava east 
of 
Doboj and in the area of Brcko north of that town, as well as in 
the region of Srbobran (formerly Donji Vakuf) and Mt. Vlasic in 
central Bosnia. 
  Despite a defeat suffered over the past few days in the 
areas 
of Gorazde, Cajnice and Foca, the Moslem army is carrying out 
new mobilization and re-grouping of its troops, Bosnian Serb 
army sources said. 
  They said they had received an information that the Moslems 
had on Saturday night expected in vain a large quantity of 
weapons, ammunition and food to be airdropped in the Gorazde 
area. 
  The Bosnian Serb army command said on Saturday that it 
possessed proofs that the airdrop operation (in which 
humanitarian supplies are parachuted to the population of Moslem 
enclaves in eastern Bosnia, including Gorazde) was being used 
for supplying the Moslem army with up-to-date arms. 
  The Bosnian Moslem army has used those weapons in its latest 
offensive on Serb positions from the direction of Gorazde, where 
more than 10,000 Moslem fighters are based in spite of the fact 
that the enclave should have been demilitarized a long time ago 
under a resolution of the United Nations which proclaimed the 
town a "safe area."

  [Text] Cajnice, 4 Apr (TANJUG) -- Following a relatively 
quiet night, early this morning Muslim forces launched a fierce 
artillery and infantry attack from the direction of Gorazde 
toward Cajnice and Foca, the command of the [Bosnian Serb] 
Herzegovina Corps announces. 
  This is the seventh day of the spring offensive by the 
so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army aimed at reestablishing the 
green transversal from Sarajevo via Gorazde to Sandzak. The 
fiercest battles are being waged in the area of Potkozarje and 
Oglecevo. 
  Serb military sources claim that the Muslims have given up 
attacking toward Cajnice via Gradine and Trebesevo because they 
suffered huge losses in that area over the past few days. 
  The command of the Herzegovina Corps said that there were no 
casualties among Serb fighters in the past 24 hours.

  [Text] Kragujevac, 3 Apr (TANJUG) -- The Muslim offensive 
code-named "The Final Liberation of the Unitary 
Bosnia-Herzegovina" [Konacno oslobodjenje cjelovite Bosne I 
Hercegovine], launched in the middle of the last week against 
all Serb positions, has failed to yield any results, being a 
totally disorganized action, according to General Manojlo 
Milovanovic. 
  In the "Hallmark of Time" program on Radio Kragujevac, 
General Milovanovic referred to the setting up of a federation 
between the Muslims and Croats and went on to explain the 
reasons why it was created and the role of military circles in 
this move. "First, the Muslims rid themselves of the Croats as 
the enemy, while on the other hand the Croats were facing total 
military defeat and had to agree on the federation." 
  Asked if the Croats had joined in Muslim armed attacks 
against Serbs, General Milovanovic said: "No. They have been 
completely passive in relation to us and the Muslims and, like 
cunning Latins, are waiting to see who is going to win and then 
take the side of the stronger." 
  Explaining the main objectives of the Muslim offensive, 
General Milovanovic singled out Posavina and Podrinje as its 
main targets. "In Posavina the Muslims want to cut through the 
Serb corridor. They need to capture Brcko, and the Croats want 
to keep the areas where the Croat population was in the majority 
before the war. The Muslims have two options in the Drina river 
basin -- one of them is a lateral operation [esast to west] to 
reach the left bank of the Drina river from Tuzla and Kalesija 
to Zvornik, then to link up with Srebrenica from Kladanj via 
Vlasenica, to link up with Zepa from Olovo via Sokolac and Han 
Pijesak and also to link Sarajevo with Gorazde. The other 
option is a vertical operation [south to north] to connect the 
Muslim enclaves from Gorazde toward Zepa, from Zepa to 
Srebrenica and from there to Zvornik, or the other way round." 
  Milovanovic said that there is a rift between the Muslim 
military and state leadership and that the offensive was 
originally scheduled for the autumn. This is clearly a result 
of the military leadership's wish to prove themselves. 
  Commenting on the arrival of Turkish units, Milovanovic said 
that this is a clear provocation or a sign of the UN Security 
Council's weakness. "This is a religious and not a civil war, 
and the world should be aware of it. This is a war between 
Christianity and Islam."

  [Text] Belgrade, April 3 (TANJUG) -- The all-out Moslem 
offensive on the Bosnian Serb republic continues on all fronts 
on Sunday, the Bosnian Serb command says and adds that along the 
Sava river in the north the Moslems are being backed by regular 
troops of neighbouring Croatia. 
  According to the same source, Croatian multiple rocket 
launchers and long-range artillery on the left bank of the Sava 
river have been pounding the territory of the Bosnian Serb 
republic. 
  The shelling has been especially heavy in the Serb villages 
of Krepsic and Obudovac and the town of Doboj. 
  The Bosnian Serb command says that although the Moslems are 
attacking practically all borders of the Bosnian Serb republic, 
the brunt of their attacks is directed against the corridor 
linking the eastern and the western part of the republic. 
  The same source emphasizes that the Bosnian Serb army is 
responding to all attacks and inflicting heavy losses to the 
enemy, and that everything indicates to a complete breakdown of 
the Moslem offensive very soon. 
  Moslem-controlled Radio Sarajevo reports continuation of 
inter-Moslem fighting in the northwest between forces loyal to 
Fikret Abdic and Moslem hardline leader Alija Izetbegovic. 
  Abdic, a fierce opponent of Izetbegovic's war-mongering 
policy, last October proclaimed independence for the province of 
western Bosnia.

"President Drives Coalition Politicians to Madness"] 
  [Text] "President Walesa wants to drive the governing 
coalition politicians to madness, and he is being successful: 
Aleksander Kwasniewski uses a ladder and a window to get out, 
just like the count of Monte Cristo; the leader of the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] should ask for an extended long 
sick leave," claims Stefan Niesiolowski, when asked to comment 
on recent activities by Lech Walesa--namely, the fight with the 
governing coalition, his refusal to approve the nomination of 
Dariusz Rosati, and the announcement of his plans to veto the 
Budget Law. 
  According to the deputy president of the Christian-National 
Union [ZChN], Walesa has all along been implementing the same 
plan. He wants to be reelected for a second term. "Lech Walesa 
wants to destabilize the situation. He wants to rock the 
government coalition because... 
<H5>  In a Stable System He Would Have No Chance of Winning </H5>
  ...in the elections," believes Niesiolowski; he also 
perceives the president's activities as an attempt to return to 
their roots and to regain the popularity of the anticommunist 
electorate. The ZChN leader believes that another move by the 
president may be overthrowing the government and forming an 
interim government, and, finally, a repeat of history: the 
return of Walesa to save Poland from communism. 
  A diagnosis similar to this one was made by Janusz 
Piechocinski of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. "To achieve his 
strategic goal, the president must build a political camp, and 
right now he is demonstrating that only he, with his 
constitutional powers, is capable of stopping the center left. 
He claims that the alternative to the September winners is not 
the right wing, not the Democratic Union [UD] merging with the 
liberals, but himself--Lech Walesa. In this manner, he gives the 
Solidarity camp people to understand that, if they do not want 
to be defeated once again, he must again lead this camp, and 
only he himself is able to ensure efficiency and a victory for 
it," says the PSL deputy, who also noted that, while thinking 
about being reelected, the president is beginning to... 
<H5>  Force His Opponents to the Floor </H5>
  "He says: Look, in only six months, I made the victorious 
Kwasniewski do such things as leave the Sejm premises with the 
help of a ladder. He is showing that he is active, that he is 
someone more than just the president. He confirms his 
importance." This is how Piechocinski evaluated Walesa's 
activities. 
  Zbigniew Siemiatkowski of the SLD is also convinced that all 
of the president's moves and actions serve only one purpose: 
reelection in the 1995 presidential election. "All of his 
activities are dictated by the desire to gain better footing 
before the presidential campaign; this is why he so determinedly 
fought with the National Council of Radio and Television. When 
it turned out that, contrary to his expectations, the council 
became an independent body and even the people appointed by him 
demonstrated considerable independence, there came a fierce 
attack, criticism of the entire council; he did this just to 
have television, a powerful weapon, at his disposal during the 
presidential campaign," claims Siemiatkowski. 
  "The other platform of the president's activities consists 
of criticizing his rivals. This is why... 
<H5>  The Brunt of the Attack Was Directed at Aleksander </H5>
Kwasniewski 
  "In my opinion, the activities that aim at weakening the 
coalition are in fact caused by the desire to discredit the 
politician who seems to be his most important rival," says the 
SLD spokesman. He also says that the president is trying to win 
over new supporters before the next campaign. "This was 
supposed to be partially achieved by the people's constitutional 
initiative, which gave various extraparliamentary milieus the 
possibility of integration. Also, if the president does not 
sign the budget, it will be another attempt to find elements 
dissatisfied with the current economic policy; it will prove his 
desire to take over some of the social dissatisfaction that has 
been accompanying the economic reforms for years," believes 
Zbigniew Siemiatkowski. 
  According to Piotr Nowina-Konopka of UD, Lech Walesa's next 
term will depend on his ability to stabilize the political 
situation in Poland. However, Nowina-Konopka can see that the 
president's activities do not serve stabilization. "The 
president is thinking about his reelection in terms of positive 
developments in Poland. He is convinced that his reelection 
will be for the good of Poland. However, I am now submitting 
certain doubts whether... 
<H5>  Such a Manner of Approaching the Presidency </H5>
  ...serves the stability of the state," says the UD deputy. 
  Stanislaw Michalkiewicz, of the Union for Real Politics 
[UPR], believes that the recent moves by Lech Walesa should not 
be looked upon as attempts to destabilize the situation but, 
rather, as part of the fight for the shape of the political 
system in Poland. The UPR leader recalls that the left wing 
supported the parliamentary-cabinet government system, whereas 
Walesa believes that the balance of power should be respected. 
"A constant element of Lech Walesa's game is the following: 
When someone rises too high, Walesa draws up someone else from 
political nonexistence. This is what happened with Bielecki and 
then with Pawlak, who has come to the first division owing to 
Walesa, and who is still there." This is how Stanislaw 
Michalkiewicz tries to explain the president's intentions. 
  Krzysztof Krol of the Confederation for an Independent 
Poland 
believes that Lech Walesa, in all his activities, wants to 
maintain balance in the political scene and, in line with his 
constitutional powers, wants to represent the opinion of the 
people, deceived by the present governing coalition. "We should 
not look upon these activities as the presidential campaign." 
  "It is still too early for the campaign," adds Krol. 
According to him, Walesa will either force the coalition to 
implement the preelection programs of the SLD and the PSL, or it 
will want to form and support a minority government headed by 
Waldemar Pawlak.

  [Text] Following the return of a delegation of Polish 
members of parliament from Moscow, Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy has 
given assurances that Russia wants to develop good relations 
with Poland: 
  [Begin Oleksy recording] We were completely conscious of the 
purpose of this visit, and we were there to demonstrate that it 
is not only possible but also necessary for Poland and for 
Russia that our mutual relations be other than perhaps what they 
have been hitherto, even though the times then were different. 
Now, the times dictate the need for good relations with Russia 
for the implementation of Polish interests, and we confirmed in 
the course of the visit that Russia wants the same. There are 
no matters of dispute, there are no differences of view that 
could stand in the way or could be conditions incapable of being 
met, so that precisely these good Polish-Russian relations could 
come to fruition. 
  We talked with all of the well-known Russian politicians. We 
spoke with left-wing forces and right-wing and centrist ones. 
Concerning economic affairs, Russia, just like Poland, sees the 
opportunity for significant growth in the dynamics of trade 
turnover and of our own new joint economic, capital, financial, 
and investment undertakings. This is what Poland needs, this is 
what can serve the improvement of the situation in Russia. 
  We feel that this visit had a deep sense in political, 
economic, and state terms. And let no one seek in it something 
that was not there; let everyone find in it that which can serve 
Poland and Russia in thinking about Europe and its future, 
bilateral, and in thinking. [sentence as heard] [end recording] 
  Bronislaw Geremek, who was a member of the delegation, 
evaluates the visit as being very important: 
  [Begin Geremek recording] This is a visit that ought not to 
be measured in terms of what it was possible to achieve because 
this was not for executive power or for the signing of 
protocols. This was a political visit and, in my view, one of 
great significance because the Poles spoke the language of 
truth--various political groupings in various ways--but the hard 
language of truth. And the Russians replied to us in like 
fashion. We know at the moment where the differences of opinion 
lie. They relate to the issue of security, and they must relate 
to it. They relate to the issue of Polish participation in 
NATO, and they must relate to this. But, simultaneously, on the 
one side and on the other, there was a certain act of political 
will. It is worthwhile, for both Poland and Russia, to build 
normal relations. And, first, to start with the economy. There 
is business--Polish and Russian--to be done here, and it will 
show that there are no aggressive intentions on either side. In 
this sense, I judge that this was a successful visit. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Mariusz Jedrzejko and Krzysztof Jakobiec: "The </F>
Difficult Art of Management; Armed Forces Meeting on Economic 
Issues"] 
  [Excerpts] The Army cannot do without money; the 
Army's functioning must take into account market mechanisms to 
an ever-increasing extent; commanders at all levels, apart from 
fulfilling a training and an organizational role, are also 
managers. These are just some thoughts and concepts that were 
articulated during a debate within the Armed Forces on economic 
issues that took place in Warsaw on 31 March. 
  The meeting was organized by the Logistics Inspectorate of 
the Armed Forces' General Staff and included participants from 
the General Staff's leadership cadre, commanders of military 
districts, and commanders of the various branches of the Armed 
Forces, chief of the Finance Ministry [acting Finance Minister] 
Henryk Chmielak, chief of the Central Planning Administration 
[CUP], Minister Miroslaw Pietrewicz, Deputy Defense Minister Jan 
Kuriata, as well as representatives of the Supreme Chamber of 
Control, the Public Prosecutors Office, the Supreme Court's 
Military Chamber, and representatives of financial institutions 
and military educational units. 
  Interdependencies between the shape of the national economy 
and the possibility of meeting the tasks the Armed Forces have 
been charged with were strongly emphasized during the meeting. 
Despite announcements and declarations by various politicians, 
there has been no breakthrough in defense expenditures. In 
1994, 48.3 trillion zlotys will be appropriated for the Army, 
which, taking into account after-inflation figures, constitutes 
a drop of 1.8 percent from last year. The amount 
appropriated for the Army is bound to have an impact on its 
shape, on the rate of restructuring done within it, and on the 
introduction of modern combat technologies. 
  Despite the popular expectations of participants at the 
meeting, speeches by the chiefs of the Finance Ministry and CUP 
failed to include prospects for financial assistance to serve 
the fulfillment of defense needs. Lack of a model of action, at 
least with the next two to three years in mind, to a large 
extent makes it impossible for the Armed Forces' leadership to 
plan administrative and structural changes or training 
activities. One could hear statements by Armed Forces' 
representatives in unofficial talk: This is not the kind of 
position we expected to see. 
  The existing problems and interdependencies cannot impede 
the 
changes that are being implemented--or that are being 
planned--in the area of managing the military economy. These 
issues were very strongly emphasized during a speech by General 
Zbigniew Zalewski, chief of the Logistics Inspectorate. 
<H5>  Army and Market Mechanisms </H5>
  Because of our defense needs, we should be devoting 30 
to 40 percent of the Defense Ministry's [MON] budget to 
structural transformations, new technologies, and technical 
infrastructure. In reality, only one-tenth of the 
above-mentioned budget will actually be spent on satisfying 
these goals. This situation is further exacerbated by a faulty 
tax system, which is responsible for so-called empty money 
flowing between and among state institutions (state budget 
institutions). Banks are the only party benefiting from the 
phenomenon. 
  According to General Z. Zalewski, when it comes to 
parliamentary debate on defense issues that will take place in 
the near future, one should consider introducing a 
different type of tax system vis-a-vis the Armed Forces. It is 
also necessary to carry through amendments to the entire batch 
of so-called military-related statutes. There are also 
possibilities of introducing such changes that would make it 
possible to implement modern mechanisms of managing and 
supervising the Army's assets. On that theme, a proposal 
was presented, among other things, to establish an analytical 
center within the Armed Forces, which should deal with creating 
economic and financial fundamentals of the MON budget. 
Measures that have been undertaken so far--for instance, a 
decrease of logistical units by 30 percent--made it possible to 
direct additional means to the Army's most important areas of 
activity. The need to search for sources of additional economic 
measures was reflected in a speech by General Marian Robelek. 
Among other things, a rationalization of organizational 
structures and further decreases in the number of additional and 
protective units should constitute a source for such economic 
measures. It will also be necessary to... 
<H5>  ...Give Up Unneeded Military Premises </H5>
  ...the maintenance of which is a burden to the MON budget. 
Unless principles of transfer of assets are changed, and unless 
the resistance by the administration is overcome (the 
administration procrastinates with regard to taking control over 
unneeded sites), radical steps will have to be taken. 
  Given the limited resources that can be devoted to the 
Army's technical advancement, the following will receive 
priority treatment: purchases of reconnaissance and 
radio-electronic combat equipment, and also of command systems 
and antitank and antiaircraft systems. 
  The efficiency of implementing logistical concepts and 
eliminating irregularities in the military economy are an 
important problem. Among others, General Jan Wojtala, chief of 
MON's Supervision Department, spoke about this. [passage 
omitted] 
  The meeting did not resolve--it could not have--all of the 
problems faced by commanders and the Army's logistics branch. 
However, assessments and conclusions presented during the debate 
will make it possible to take the realities of military service 
into account in the decisionmaking process.

<F P=106> [Article by Konrad Sadurski: "Extension of Lessening Debt </F>
Burden"] 
  [Text] Seven state-owned banks have managed to deal 
with a majority of old credits that have not been repaid and 
that amount to 16 trillion zlotys [Z], the Finance Ministry 
says. Throughout April, the banks must either sell the so-called 
bad debts or regard them as losses. 
  By Thursday [31 March], the seven banks that have emerged 
from the Polish National Bank in 1989, were supposed to 
eliminate the so-called bad debts, which are worth approximately 
Z16 trillion. These are credits that companies have stopped 
repaying as early as before June 1991. 
  The law on lessening the debt burden allowed banks to decide 
what to do about dishonest debtors: to lessen their debt burden 
if the debtors' activity brings profit, to sell their debts, or 
to move to have the company in question declared bankrupt or 
dissolved. For banks not to get into financial trouble in the 
process of lessening the debt burden, the state budget gave the 
banks bonds worth Z11 trillion. At the same time, the budget 
imposed an obligation on the banks to get rid of the credits by 
the end of March. 
<H5>  There Are No More Old Debts Anymore </H5>
  According to the Finance Ministry, banks had gotten rid of a 
majority of old debts by the end of February. "We will not have 
complete data until mid-May, once the bank's situation is 
examined by auditors," chief of the Finance Ministry Henryk 
Chmielak assured his listeners during a press conference held on 
Thursday. 
  By the end of February, banks have concluded about 50 
agreements and contracts, which made it possible for them to 
restructure about Z3.6 trillion old credits. 
  "We have received signals that many banks managed to come to 
an agreement with their debtors only at the last moment. 
Yesterday, the Lublin-based Savings and Credit Bank signed an 
agreement with the Stalowa Wola steelworks," Minister Chmielak 
said. 
  "If a bank initiated proceedings before the end of 
February aimed at signing an agreement, it can continue with the 
proceedings.. But the agreement must be signed by the end 
of April," the minister warned. Banks have not yet completed 
their negotiations with companies that owe the banks about Z4.4 
trillion. 
<H5>  Unsold Debts Mean Debts Without Value </H5>
  In accordance with the law mentioned before, banks were also 
empowered to sell debts by bad clients at public auctions. This 
way, the seven banks wanted to get rid of financial claims worth 
Z980 billion. Two-thirds of those claims were actually sold. 
  A derivative market for selling financial claims has only 
begun its activity in March. "Banks are allowed to sell the 
remaining financial claims by 24 April--that is, before auditors 
initiate their control measures," employees of the Finance 
Ministry say. In their view, if banks are not successful in 
selling the debts of some companies, that will mean that the 
debts are without value, and the given bank will have to regard 
the money as a loss. 
<H5>  Strategic Debts Not Wanted </H5>
  Banks did not know what to do about debts by those companies 
that are in trouble but that are of strategic importance to the 
economy, like, for instance, arms factories. "The Finance 
Ministry has made efforts to have debts by 38 companies taken 
over by an Agency for Industrial Development," we were told by 
Finance Ministry officials. But the agency refused to do that, 
saying that the companies are hopeless cases. 
  These companies owed about Z1 trillion just to banks, 
whereas 
their total debt amounted to Z8 trillion. The ministry decided 
that the banks must also sell the debts of these companies. 
  Banks have submitted motions to have companies declared 
bankrupt or to have them dissolved. This applies to those 
companies that owe the banks Z676 billion. Companies that have 
not repaid the seven banks' Z1.6 trillion went bankrupt or were 
eliminated. Some clients have initiated servicing debts worth 
approximately Z1 trillion. 
<H5>  Western Money, Clean Accounts </H5>
  Banks must clean their accounts, and, in this way, they will 
become more attractive to investors during privatization. 
  "Privatization of those banks will bring two kinds of 
benefits to the state budget," Minister Chmielak argued. "First 
of all, the budget will receive revenue from the banks' 
privatization, and, second, the budget will not have to buy out 
the bonds that the budget had given to the banks." 
  After the sale of a bank, money to buy out the bonds would 
come from a State-Owned Fund for Bank Privatizations. The fund 
has about $650 million at its disposal; it was established out 
of the old Fund for Stabilization of the Zloty. A majority of 
the fund's monies comes from donations by other countries. 
  The money is in the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, and it 
earns interest. Privatization of a bank is the only precondition 
for being able to use the money. First in line is the 
Krakow-based Industrial-Commercial Bank, which must be 
privatized by 20 January 1995. 
  --According to the Finance Ministry, it will not be possible 
to use the money out of the Fund for Bank Privatizations to buy 
out Z10 trillion worth of bonds that the General Savings 
Bank-National Bank and the Food Industry Bank had received. 
These banks received the bonds later, which means they must get 
rid of the debts by the end of September.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Maciej Jankowski, under the "In My View" </F>
rubric: "There Must Be Pressure"] 
  [Text] The situation is very difficult. But one must 
get used to various things, including difficult situations. I 
have been saying from the very beginning of the protest action 
that one cannot expect spectacular victories, and that this will 
be a longer process that we must patiently go through. It will 
take at least several months. 
  All around the world, including in the United States and 
Japan, the fight went on for months. That is also what will 
happen in Poland. It is my prediction that the protests' first 
effects will be visible in a few months, but I doubt that we 
will be successful in bringing this fight to an end. 
  After all, there is also the issue of constitutional 
provisions that we must make sure are enacted. If we want to 
secure ourselves by protecting employee rights, by protecting 
the rights of people who work in trade unions--and also in 
various organizations--for free, that must be covered by 
constitutional provisions. 
  We could not have waited any longer to begin the current 
protests. If we were to consider a one-time protest, perhaps it 
would be worth delaying the action by a month or two--that is, 
until society receives the first increased electric and natural 
gas bills--and then society's outrage will increase. But that 
was not the issue. The fact that the scenario did not 
materialize is proof of Solidarity's logical strategies, whose 
goal is a wide, social aspect and not just individual interests. 
  Right now, everything depends on the positions that people 
will adopt. More and more people are becoming aware that their 
economic and social rights are in danger. But perhaps not 
enough people are aware of that. 
  People still do not realize that they will not get anything 
without a fight: They will have no guarantee of the right to 
social insurance, to vacations, and to other types of benefits; 
they also do not realize that they will cease to be partners [as 
published]. But there will come a time when they will lose their 
patience. 
  I was not optimistic from the beginning that our demands 
would be met soon. That is because such is the practice adopted 
by subsequent governments for very many years now: Specific 
problems are not solved but, rather, obscured. And I can see no 
reason for that situation to change. 
  I said during a recent rally in Krakow that this is not the 
way it is going to be: We have appointed negotiators, who will 
deal with the government for us. If we do not make ourselves 
seen in public--in factories, on the streets, and at 
rallies--the negotiators' mission will fail. We experienced 
that before, for many years, not just after 1980 but also 
before. There must be pressure: If there is no pressure, our 
demands will remain just that and nothing else. 
  The trade union should work out a strategy of political 
action, and special centers for substantive work should be 
established for that purpose. Money must be found. What is 
absolutely indispensable is to establish a bureau for economic 
and social-policy analysis. We must present specific arguments 
to the people--the "Mazowsze" region [of Solidarity] is devoting 
1 billion zlotys for that purpose already at this point. One 
must not spare money for that goal. We must also have a strong 
group that would be prepared to have the trade union participate 
in the mass media in order to present our arguments there. The 
trade union position on every issue important to society should 
be communicated.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 3 (TANJUG) -- Foreign Minister of 
the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) Slobodan Jarcevic described 
as positive development the agreement on cessation of 
hostilities which the RSK and Croatia signed last Wednesday in 
the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. 
  Hoping that the agreement would be the first step towards 
the 
normalization of relations between the two sides, Jarcevic told 
Radio Belgrade on Sunday that the agreement did not tackle 
demarcation issues. 
  The territories which remained in the so-called buffer zone 
or on Croatian side will be discussed as part of the demarcation 
package, he explained. 
  The RSK was created in 1991 in predominantly Serb-populated 
areas in Croatia in response to Croatia's violent secession from 
the former Yugoslav Federation. It was placed under U.N. 
protection in March 1992. 
  The Zagreb agreement may prove detrimental only on one 
point: 
If Croatia transfers troops from the borders with the RSK to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to support the all-out Moslem offensive 
against Bosnian Serbs, said Jarcevic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Drazen Budisa, head of the Social Liberal </F>
Party, by Norbert Mappes-Niediek; place and date not given: "No 
Reason To Rush Things"] 
  [Text] [Mappes-Niediek] You sharply criticized Croatia's 
Bosnia policy. Tudjman has now changed his course. Has harmony 
been restored in Croatia? 
  [Budisa] Croatia's Bosnia policy was double-faced. One 
could support what was stated in public, but what actually 
happened had nothing to do with it. There is now full agreement 
on the federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Mappes-Niediek] How do you view the planned confederation 
between the Croats and the federative Bosnia? 
  [Budisa] We have nothing against a confederation. Yet, it 
has to be a long process. Besides, there is absolutely no 
reason to rush things. When two of the three constituent 
nations of Bosnia -- Croats and Muslims -- decide to join 
Croatia in a confederation, one can, despite all criticism, not 
deny the Bosnian Serbs the right to join Serbia in a 
confederation. 
  [Mappes-Niediek] Your president seems to have a different 
view on that. 
  [Budisa] Tudjman is convinced that it is time to set up a 
kind of watershed between two worlds that are politically and 
culturally incompatible. Yet, we want to prevent a new cold war 
between East and West. As long as Russia is ruled by democrats, 
we do not need such a watershed. 
  [Mappes-Niediek] How do you perceive a solution for Croatian 
territories that are held by the Serbs? 
  [Budisa] We have a very good law on the rights of national 
minorities, which has, unfortunately, never been implemented, 
not even in that part of Croatia that is controlled by the 
government. This has weakened our position in the negotiations. 
I am thinking of the many blown-up houses of Serbs, the 
difficulties for Serbian citizens to get their certificate of 
nationality, and of how the proportional representation of the 
Serbs was implemented in Parliament. The Serbs in Croatia 
constitute a national community. I think that Croatia will be 
forced to go somewhat beyond the regulations for national 
minorities. But there will never be a solution that would turn 
the Croatian people in any part of Croatia into a minority, as 
would be the case in a confederative solution. Look at myself, 
for example. I am from Drnis, in Dalmatia. Before the war 
20,000 Croats lived there, constituting 70 percent of the 
population. Now there are 200. The house I was born in is now 
occupied by the Serbian police. For these parts of Croatia 
there cannot be Serbian autonomy. 
  [Mappes-Niediek] As a result of ethnic cleansing, 97 percent 
of Serbs now live in Krajina. They are determined not to accept 
any solution beneath a confederation. 
  [Budisa] There cannot be a confederative status for the 
entire occupied territory. This would only lead to a new war. 
Territorial autonomy can only be had for areas where the Serbs 
were a majority before the war -- that is, in the areas around 
Knin and Glina. 
  [Mappes-Niediek] Do you still expect the violent reconquest 
of the Krajina by Croatia this spring? 
  [Budisa] This spring? No. The current talks between the 
two sides are obviously going well. Serbia is being more and 
more affected by the sanctions, and the Milosevic regime in 
Belgrade is also the epicenter for the Krajina Serbs. The other 
side may not be cooperative now, but it will be in a few months.

  [Text] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister, has sent a letter to UN Security Council 
Chairman Colin Keating expressing concern over artillery attacks 
on Zupanja and the Zupanja Posavina area. Granic warns that the 
attack came after the adoption of the resolution extending the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] mandate and granting it greater 
authority, and after the recent cease-fire agreement signed 
between representatives of the Croatian authorities and Serb 
rebels from the occupied areas under UN protection. 
  Citing media reports and statements by senior UNHCR [UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees] and ICRC [International Committee of 
the Red Cross] officials on crimes committed against Muslims and 
Croats in the Prijedor region over the past few days, and on the 
inability of international humanitarian organizations to protect 
a large non-Serb population in northern Bosnia, which has been 
under pressure to leave, Minister Granic said that these 
criminal actions must be urgently stopped. The Republic of 
Croatia will otherwise be faced with a new wave of refugees, a 
burden with which it will not be able to cope given that it is 
already caring for about 500,000 refugees, Granic said. He 
calls on the UN Security Council to do everything in its power 
to halt these crimes. 
  The latest attacks on Zupanja Posavina indicate that the 
Croatian request to UNPROFOR to ensure firm control of the 
borders of the Republic of Croatia -- outlined in the 16 March 
letter from Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of 
Croatia, to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali -- is fully 
justified, Minister Granic says at the end of his letter.

  [Text] The Serbian national corpus this week heard with 
relief the news from Knin that the parties had agreed to form a 
government of national unity in Krajina. Just as Prime 
Minister-designate Borislav Mikelic announced this information, 
a statement by the Serbian Democratic Party [SDS] of Krajina 
appeared, saying that its leader, Milan Babic, had postponed the 
negotiations on his participation in the Serbian Krajina 
government. This was the reason why we asked Borislav Mikelic, 
whom not even his biggest enemy can deny wisdom and above all 
flexibility in establishing contact with everyone, what had 
actually happened. In asking this question, we were primarily 
prompted by the fact that the war in the republic of Serbian 
Krajina is still going on, that companies have not worked for 
nearly three years, that 40,000 pensioners have not received 
their pensions for months, and that hundreds of children have 
lost their parents -- that is, that another hour should not be 
wasted in forming the government. This is another reason to 
listen to Mikelic's statement: 
  [Begin Mikelic recording] I was of the opinion that we must 
carry out our task and form the government. I began from the 
premise that I had capable people for individual departments and 
not ministries, since it would be difficult to talk about 
ministries within the framework of the republic of Serbian 
Krajina at the moment. These ministries could perhaps be 
established only in three or four spheres; however, in other 
spheres this is not possible, bearing in mind the circumstances. 
Therefore, I am viewing the situation realistically. 
  On the basis of this plan, I proposed to the SDS four 
mandates and that Mr. Babic be appointed deputy prime minister 
for international relations and for liaisons with the Serbs in 
diaspora, which I believe is a sphere that he could cover. In a 
sense, he would be the first deputy prime minister in the 
government led by myself. To the radicals, keeping in mind that 
they already have the chairman of the assembly, I offered 
another two mandates. In this second stage, I did not even take 
into consideration the parties and their size but was motivated 
by finding expert people -- that is, to draw into the government 
those who can cover certain expert fields, as well as what is 
feasible at this stage. 
  Therefore, I made certain compromises here -- in some 
spheres 
even at the expense of quality -- with the aim of creating a 
government of national unity and to finally show those in the 
West, in Croatia, and others who are against the republic of 
Serbian Krajina that we can work together, that we -- Martic, 
Babic, Mikelic, Bjegovic, and all others who can in a way offer 
to the nation a little more than what has been offered so far -- 
will stick together. Thus, I held talks with the SDS and its 
president, Dr. Babic. In principle, he accepted my offer. I now 
hear that the SDS has issued a statement that they embrace the 
government of national unity, but based on the parity principle 
taking into consideration the number of parliamentary seats, and 
also that Babic has postponed his participation in the 
government. I view this as a SDS statement and not a statement 
by Milan Babic. If the SDS coordinated this with him, then Mr. 
Babic will probably inform me about it. For the time being 
though, I have not heard this from him -- that is, that he has 
postponed his participation. If he has postponed it and perhaps 
given up on this approach, then he could have done it only after 
our talks. 
  This is my approach and if I will not be able to fulfill it, 
then I doubt that I could agree to be prime minister in a 
government that would reflect the parliament -- that is, a 
government in which the majority and minority parties would 
disagree on certain decisions and to have the party struggle 
transferred to the government. I would not want to head such a 
government. They will have to find someone else. I have agreed 
to offer my services and come to Knin for patriotic reasons. I 
am willing to work and help some people save [words indistinct] 
for the sake of Krajina's future. However, if someone wants to 
place party interests above national ones -- I believe that 
national interests are above the party's interests -- then the 
people should judge what is more correct right now -- what I 
have to offer or what the party leaders and some party clubs 
have to offer. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, 1 Apr (TANJUG) -- Slobodan Jarcevic, 
minister of foreign affairs of the republic of Serb Krajina 
[RSK], today welcomed the UN Security Council resolution 
extending the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] mandate by six 
months. 
  Noting that due to financial difficulties the United Nations 
will send only 3,500 fresh soldiers, Jarcevic stressed in a 
statement for Radio Yugoslavia that the shortage of soldiers 
would be made up with the authority of the United States and 
Russia because "they guaranteed that peace along the border 
between the RSK and the Republic of Croatia would not be 
violated." 
  The RSK foreign minister also welcomed the fact that NATO 
will surveil the air space between the RSK and Croatia in order 
to "protect the blue helmets." 
  Jarcevic expressed the hope that the RSK will be 
internationally recognized in the next six months, that Zagreb 
will understand that it cannot defeat Krajina militarily, and 
that the Croatian demand to the United Nations to force the 
Serbs to return to Croatia with NATO's help cannot be fulfilled. 
  "In its actions, Croatia must take as the starting point the 
current state of affairs and the fact that Krajian exists," 
Jarcevic told Radio Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Zagreb, 1 April (TANJUG) -- Josip Manolic, chairman 
of the Croatian parliament's Chamber of Counties and recently 
ousted from all positions he held in the leadership of the 
ruling Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ], has said that 
Croatia is currently going through a parliamentary crisis. 
  In an interview for the Zagreb weekly GLOBUS, Manolic said 
that the crisis could be solved only through elections. 
However, he added, the state and the HDZ leadership did not 
want early elections "because it is clear to them that they 
would lose because of accumulated problems." 
  Speaking about his plans, Manolic said that he would move 
toward a differentiation in the HDZ. This means that a group of 
his supporters together with him will leave the party, which 
will "finally bring about a formal split in the HDZ," Manolic 
said. 
  According to Manolic, "The final show-down has begun and the 
casualty list could possibly include Chamber of Deputies 
Chairman Stipe Mesic, Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, and former 
Prime Minister Franjo Greguric." It seems that Tudjman "has 
moved against me first, regarding me as the toughest nut to 
crack" and that from time to time he will replace "one by one 
the members of the liberal wing of the HDZ." 
  According to Manolic, the vital difference between him and 
Tudjman lies in the strategic policy regarding 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. As far as the Washington agreement is 
concerned, I believe that my option for Bosnia prevailed: It is 
based on cooperation between Croats and Muslims and on respect 
for the integrity [celovitost] of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  It is a fact, said Manolic, that there is a group of 
politicians in Herzegovina who find the Washington agreement 
with the Muslims unsuitable. "A war can break out again over 10 
square km and whether they would be part of the Croat or the 
Muslim cantons, or about different posts in the federation and 
whether they should be occupied by Croats or by Muslims," 
stressed Manolic. 
  Manolic said he also came into conflict with Tudjman because 
of the functioning of a law-governed state. "We should halt 
forcible expulsions, the blowing up of houses, and 
discrimination along national criteria, which is still 
happening," he warned and said that "the present set-up has not 
proven capable of protecting the rights of all Croatian 
citizens." 
  He wanted to know who stood behind the political decisions 
to 
establish concentration camps in Herzeg-Bosna, to hold the 
eastern part of Mostar under siege for six months, to blow up 
the Old Bridge, and finally, to wage a war against Muslims. In 
his interview for GLOBUS, Manolic said that Croatian Defense 
Minister Gojko Susak "was the one most involved in the 
implementation of the Croatian policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina."

<F P=106> [Article by Edvard Popovic: "NATO Wants to Set Up Bases in </F>
Croatia"] 
  [Text] NATO is asking for Zadar airport, the plateau above 
Slano (around Cepikuce), and for two islands (Vis and another 
one) for its future bases -- this information has been leaked 
from the state leadership and has been unofficially confirmed by 
a high-ranking official of the Croatian Army Supreme 
Headquarters. Official sources have so far not said whether this 
is just an indication of NATO's growing presence within the 
activity of the UN in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, or the 
first step in taking Croatia, through the "Partnership for 
Peace," into full membership in NATO. Only the growing presence 
of NATO forces -- provided that elements of the Croat-Muslim 
agreements are implemented -- could guarantee the 
re-establishment of the disrupted balance, i.e., introduce a 
lasting and more stable peace in these parts. 
  The choice of location is no accident. Belgrade headquarters 
knows that very well, for many examinations for the rank of 
general in the former Yugoslavia were based exactly on variants 
of defending the hinterland of Zadar, the valley of the Neretva 
River, and the Kupres valley from potential landing operations 
and attacks by NATO forces. 
<H5>  Strategic Routes </H5>
  Zadar and its hinterland, Ravni Kotari, is the widest 
gateway 
to the Balkans. This is where a more serious marine-airborne 
assault could take place, one including an army group (about 
three divisions or 45,000 men) for further penetration toward 
the Balkan interior (toward Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia). No 
other part of the Adriatic coast, from Albania to Slovenia, is 
so suitable for assaults by major forces, for their 
consolidation and advance north- east. The potential assault 
would be made easier as Zemunik [Zadar] Airport is nearby and 
also as Croatian forces control a good part of the hinterland 
and the saddle of Mali Alan. A radar installation positioned on 
that saddle could knock out [Serb-held] Udbina Airport, thus 
establishing total control -- both on land and in the air -- of 
forces moving toward the heart of the Balkans, whose keys are 
held by those who control Kupres and the Kupres gateway, the 
main operational route for the Balkans -- the Serbs, in the 
present case. Establishing a bridgehead in Ravni Kotari and 
total control of the area would open the road to Kupres. 
  Another important Adriatic route toward the gateway to the 
Balkans is the Neretva valley. In comparison with the Zadar 
route, it is definitely a less suitable variant for penetrating 
into the Balkans, but only if the forces controlling the banks 
of the Neretva are hostile to those penetrating into the 
territory. That is not the case this time: The banks of the 
Neretva are controlled by the Croats and the Muslims. 
Consequently, it would not be very difficult for NATO to send a 
major fleet along the Neretva River from Ploce all the way to 
Capljina. The plateau above Slano, in the area of Cepikuce, 
which was liberated by the Croatian Army in a large-scale 
operation, is actually a lookout from which eastern Herzegovina 
is controlled and it is an ideal starting point for all actions 
toward Trebinje, Bileca and deeper into Bosnia-Herzegovina 
territory toward the Drina valley. 
<H5>  The Mosaic of Outcomes </H5>
  If Vis should become a NATO base, it would keep the role it 
played in the defense doctrine of former Yugoslavia; it would be 
an vital logistic base, an unsinkable warehouse of military 
supplies for land forces. 
  Such an outcome of the crisis in these parts, a replaying of 
the Yalta agreement moving the border of U.S. interests east of 
Trieste to the banks of the Bosna River or the Drina, is 
becoming increasingly certain. It is with this in mind that one 
must view the pronounced interest of Washington in the 
Croat-Muslim conciliation and the presence of U.S. soldiers in 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
(the Vardar valley is still an extremely important operational 
route for penetration into the Balkans). The statement of 
General John Shalikashvili, who said that interests in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are important enough to send 25,000 U.S. 
soldiers, sheds more light on U.S. interests. At any rate, 
Washington's message is that the Bosnia-Herzegovina fire must be 
extinguished in order to prevent it from spreading to Albania, 
Macedonia, and Greece, for, in that variant of the outcome of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem, "some other forces" might come 
into conflict as well. If we also consider the statement of the 
UN secretary general, who said that, after Russia and the United 
States came into the Balkan pot, the international Conference on 
Former Yugoslavia has become superfluous -- the mosaic of 
outcomes of the crisis will definitely appear in its more 
integral version. In any case, the UN has been unable to find a 
good model for peace in the Balkans. That organization -- in 
the Yugoslav crisis and in the war there -- has shown too many 
weaknesses, and if it really intends to be a moving force of the 
new world order, it must undergo thorough repairs. At any rate, 
it was announced that the UN would be completely reconstructed 
by the end of 1995. In these circumstances, a new world order 
means nothing else than realizing old global deals without (for 
the time being) large-scale military conflicts. 

<H5>    Croatian Gains </H5>
  The potential Croatian gains in the new circumstances -- 
that 
is, at a time of a more engaged presence of the United States 
and Russia in the Balkans and in the negotiations between Zagreb 
and Sarajevo -- have lately been discussed by general Anton Tus 
in his interview for VECERNJI LIST. The biggest gain is, of 
course, Washington's determination, in agreement with Moscow, to 
extinguish the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and stop the conflict 
between the Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Linking the airspace of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina is here 
very important for Croatia. "In military and defense terms, 
this joint area is extremely important for Croatia. There would 
be no critical intersecting points and there would be fewer 
unsafe borders. It would be much better to have a friendly 
neighbor without having to expect a strategic surprise from the 
territory. We would also gain with regard to strategic depth of 
the territory; consequently, Dalmatia and Slavonia would not 
have to fear a flank attack. Geopolitically and 
geostrategically speaking, the situation would be much better 
and balanced." 
  We still do not know the solution to the problem of the 
trans- continental main road stretching from the port of Ploce 
to the Neretva valley and the Bosna River, through Vinkovci and 
Vukovar, the Danube valley toward Budapest, Vienna, Slovakia, 
the Czech Republic, and further west on the Danube-Rhine-Danube 
canal. It is the shortest traffic route leading from the 
southern Adriatic to Central Europe and its geopolitical and 
geostrategic importance surpasses local interests. At present, 
the main road is cut in several places in Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and it is therefore important that the two 
countries, Croatia and Bosnia- Herzegovina, establish complete 
control over it. 
<H5>  The Legendary 50-50 </H5>
  Washington's fear that the war will spread to Macedonia, 
Albania, and Greece indicates the extreme importance of the 
events in Bosnia- Herzegovina for the stability of southeastern 
Europe. In that context, let us remember a Croatian initiative 
made at the CSCE, viz. the initiative for disarmament and arms 
control in countries created on the territory of former 
Yugoslavia, which was, in the future, to improve the stability 
of that territory and south-east Europe in general. According 
to our information, Croatia has already agreed to a quota of 
23,000 professional military forces. Judging by the military 
activities of the Serbs in Bosnia- Herzegovina and Croatia, and 
by the fresh supply of forces and equipment coming to 
[Serb-occupied] Croatia from Serbia, Belgrade is still not 
thinking about peace, security, or cooperation. The Serbian 
announcement that they would yield to the Muslims 16 percent of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory that they have conquered, and 
the announced arrival of the Knin team at the Russian Embassy in 
Zagreb for negotiations are encouraging, though weak signals of 
changing views (unless it is another case of a verbal trick). 
  By arranging the Croat-Muslim agreement, Washington has done 
its part of the job, and now it is Moscow's turn to put some 
pressure on the Serbs. With regard to that, it is encouraging 
to hear the announcement of closer military cooperation between 
Russia and NATO. Such cooperation is not possible without solid 
arguments. NATO could strengthen its arguments by setting up 
bases in Croatia. Anyhow, the U.S.-Russian deal could ultimately 
mean the surfacing of the final solution for the crisis in these 
parts and realizing the legendary 50-50 division and Russian 
access to a warm sea. Let us hope it will be east of the Drina 
route, not east of the valley of the Neretva and the Bosna.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Mate Granic by Visnja </F>
Staresina; place and date not given: "U.S. Support to Croatian 
Integrity"] 
  [Text] How will the negotiating process continue after the 
signing of the Washington agreement -- in other words, how to 
include the Serbs in that process? What has Croatia been 
promised in Washington and what will it have to do in return? 
For an answer to these questions, we talked to Foreign Minister 
Mate Granic in Washington the day after the ceremonial signing 
of the Croat-Bosniak agreement and his many talks with 
high-level U.S. officials and representatives of the European 
"Group of Three." 
  [Staresina] After signing the Washington agreement and 
talking with Mr. Silajdzic, is it more clear now how the Serbs 
should be involved in the negotiations? 
  [Granic] Signing the agreement was the first step toward 
establishing peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which means that this 
alliance or federation between the Bosniaks and the Croats has 
become a reality not only on paper but also in practice. We 
believe that most Bosniaks and Croats have accepted it, and 
reports confirm that. However, the crucial question now is what 
will happen next. The United States, or rather special envoy 
Charles Redman, and European constituents are going to discuss 
territorial demarcation in Bosnia-Herzegovina between the 
federation and the Serbian side and, on the other hand, 
sanctions imposed on Serbia that are connected both to the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to that in the United 
Nations Protected Areas [UNPA]. Furthermore, the Security 
Council is going to discuss the new mandate this week, and that 
will mark future developments. Moreover, the role of the 
Russian Federation in the negotiations with the third side has 
been defined to some extent; The European Union will be more 
involved in the negotiations. The framework and the location of 
the negotiations, as well as the determined compromise proposal 
on demarcation between the third side and the federation, are 
being decided upon. Internal demarcation will be discussed 
after the agreement on the final composition of the federation 
has been reached. 
<H5>  Demarcation Proposals </H5>
  [Staresina] Are there several projects of the cantonal 
demarcation between the part held by the Serbs and the 
federation? 
  [Granic] We have heard several negotiating standpoints 
recently: The Serb side is offering 45 percent of the territory 
to the Croat-Bosniak side, and Mr. Izetbegovic is demanding 60 
percent. That is what was said publicly. The European Union 
will probably try to organize the demarcation based on the 
Geneva talks -- that is, 51 percent of the territory for the 
federation. The United States will probably be prepared to 
apply more pressure on the Serb side to relinquish more 
territory in favor of the federation. 
  [Staresina] Mr. Churkin said that the Croats and the Muslims 
have the right to a confederation with Croatia, so the Serbs 
should have the same right to form a similar confederation with 
Serbia. 
  [Granic] In that case, Croatia would not want to form any 
kind of link with the Serb confederation. There would be two 
confederations. It is more likely that the Serbs will be 
invited to join the federation under the same terms. That could 
be a possible solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, it is 
not very likely the Serbs will agree to that. They have already 
indicated that. Another option is to form a very loose union 
between "the Serb Republic" and the federation, but it has not 
been thoroughly defined yet. 
  [Staresina] A loose connection between "the Serb Republic" 
and the federation would preserve the borders of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The next step would certainly be a 
confederate agreement between the federation and Croatia. In 
that case -- the Serbs have made this clear -- they would 
immediately go toward Serbia. Of course, that would result in 
forming two confederations and those two confederations could 
normalize all relations, even economic ones, but that is all 
they could do. All formal relations -- Yugoslavia and the union 
-- are out of the question for Croatia. 
  [Staresina] Do you also mean individual political 
resistance? 
  [Granic] There will probably be a number of people who will 
not be satisfied, but they cannot stop the process. 
<H5>  U.S. and Russian Influence </H5>
  [Staresina] Is there a possibility of a strong Serb-Russian 
alliance in the Balkans? 
  [Granic] The Russians have a great influence on Serbia and 
the Serb side. If the influence is coordinated with the 
European Union and the United States to reach a compromise and 
an honorable solution, then it could be positive. On the other 
hand, any kind of support for a national minority and ethnic 
community is legal, but only within the framework of 
international standards and international law. We hope that 
Russia's assistance will result in the following: reaching an 
agreement on solving the problem of UNPA zones in compliance 
with UN Security Council resolutions and European standards for 
minorities and ethnic communities and to find a peaceful 
solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina that will not destabilize 
neighboring countries. 
  [Staresina] The United States has confirmed its readiness to 
support a peaceful reintegration of UNPA zones, but Vice 
President Gore has pointed out that quality is much more 
important than haste. 
  [Granic] The vice president's words convey the basic U.S. 
view: firm support to territorial integrity of Croatia and to 
reintegration, political, and diplomatic support along with the 
pressure on Serbia, of course. But they also say that it is now 
more important that Croatia's politics be coordinated with the 
United States and that this is a process that cannot be stopped. 
Naturally, we would like to see it happen as soon as possible, 
while the United States thinks it is not so important to hurry 
the process. Consequently, it is important to find a compromise. 
<H5>  No "State Within a State" </H5>
  [Staresina] Has there been any talk about Serb autonomy in 
Croatia? Did they ask for more than has been provided by the 
constitutional law? 
  [Granic] Let me go back to President Tudjman's peace 
initiative. It provides the basis for negotiations, which means 
that it takes the territorial integrity and sovereignty of 
Croatia for granted and that it is possible to broach the 
discussion about the problem of local self-government. For the 
time being, we will stick to the constitutional law. However, 
it is possible to negotiate with the Serbs within President 
Tudjman's initiative, which was offered to the Serbs. It is no 
secret that there are different views on the problems of local 
self-government and local autonomy, and Russian views are most 
liberal, as Mr. Churkin has said a few times himself. 
  [Staresina] Do you mean a "state within a state"? 
  [Granic] That is absolutely out of the question. There will 
be no federalization or confederalization of Croatia. 
  [Staresina] Have the Russians proposed any particular 
model of autonomy? 
  [Granic] No. We mostly talked about rights rather than a 
specific model. We were very categorical about not wanting 
federalization or confederalization, but we said we would 
discuss a firm form of local self-government. 
  [Staresina] Have they ever openly demanded federalization or 
confederalization? 
  [Granic] No, but they did ask how far we would go. 
  [Staresina] Mr. Galbraith, the U.S. ambassador to Croatia, 
has recently threatened to introduce sanctions to Croatia. Is 
that still possible? 
<H5>  Open Doors to European Institutions </H5>
  [Granic] After signing the agreement, they only talked about 
ways of helping Croatia and coordinating views. They never once 
mentioned sanctions. 
  [Staresina] Has there been any specific discussion of 
Croatia joining "Partnership for Peace"? 
  [Granic] We discussed everything in great detail. The 
United States, or rather President Clinton, Vice President Gore, 
and Secretary of State Christopher, strongly supported the 
process of admitting Croatia to "Partnership for Peace." With 
the European Union, we discussed membership to the Council of 
Europe and associate membership to the European Union. Indeed, 
they will probably wait for the federation and Croatia to do it 
together. There are no more hindrances for Croatia, but they 
want to do it that way. Croatia will demand that it be accepted 
right away, so we will have to work out a compromise. 
  We talked about membership in all European institutions, the 
World Bank, the deblocking of loans, and the stand-by deals. 
The United States promised to help with regard to all that. 
  [Staresina] Belgrade radio says that there is a position in 
Serbia concerning your visit to Belgrade. Do you really intend 
to go there soon? 
  [Granic] I am prepared to go to Belgrade, if we agree on 
that. However, before doing so, in accordance with the previous 
agreement, the Serb -- Belgrade side -- must answer some 
questions regarding negotiations about telecommunications, the 
highway.... 
  [Staresina] About accepting the Croatian area code for the 
UNPA's, too? 
  [Granic] Yes, about that, too. 
  [Staresina] You also met with Turkish Minister Cetin. Will 
Croatia support the Turkish proposal on including Turkish 
soldiers in UN operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Granic] We suggested that they come to the occupied 
Croatian territory. Croatia has very friendly relations with 
Turkey. 
  [Staresina] Have there been any objections concerning human 
rights violations in Croatia? 
  [Granic] We did not talk about that at all. It was 
confirmed that Croatia is able to keep up with all the world 
standards in the field of human rights as well. 
<H5>  [Box, p 4] </H5>
<H5>  The Continuity of Croatian Policies </H5>
  [Staresina] What does this continuity consist of? You often 
point out that the Washington agreement presents the continuity 
of Croatian politics. 
  [Granic] It has a firm continuity because Croatia and 
President Tudjman personally -- much before the referendum for 
independent Bosnia-Herzegovina -- strongly advocated a 
decentralized Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which the Croats would have 
equal rights. This continuity is present in every proposal, as 
well as in the referendum and in recommendation that the Croats 
say "yes" and accept Couteillero's peace plan and the Vance-Owen 
plan. We had the most radical views regarding the European 
Union and the Owen-Stoltenberg plan of dividing 
Bosnia-Herzegovina into three republics. The present plan also 
contains decentralized Bosnia- Herzegovina. Furthermore, at a 
time when the Serbs are holding 72 percent of the territory and 
the international community has not done anything to stop that, 
the Croats in Croatia and Herzeg-Bosna will have to take a firm 
stand in defending their strategic interests. But it is also 
true that, as early as in August last year, when Mr. Silajdzic 
and Mr. Cetin visited Zagreb, we discussed possible models of 
relations that are similar to the present ones -- for example, 
those between the Croats and the Bosniaks, Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Later on, we continued those talks and 
President Tudjman and President Izetbegovic signed a public 
declaration and a non-public agreement on 14 September. We 
talked about the federation and the confederation during our 
stay in Sarajevo and then in Geneva. 

<H5>    [Box, p 5] </H5>
<H5>  Professionals </H5>
  [Staresina] How much have the changes in the political and 
military leadership of the Bosnian Croats contributed to the 
success of the negotiations? 
  [Granic] The arrival of General Ante Roso was primarily 
welcomed by the Croats, with the deep respect of the Bosniaks. 
The international community also supports professionals who 
carry out their tasks properly. On the other hand, there were 
certainly some reproaches of the international public regarding 
certain people in the previous leadership. However, that 
leadership organized the resistance to the Serb aggression, an 
efficient resistance, which should never be forgotten. The 
appointment of Mr. Zubak was certainly refreshing for the 
international community, and the Bosniak side has also accepted 
him. I believe that this has contributed to the success, but I 
repeat that the guidelines of the policy strategy have been the 
same from the very beginning.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus by </F>
Oldrich Zabojnik in Bratislava; date not given: "R. Filkus: We 
Are Not Contemplating the Third Way"] 
  [Text] There are many officials in the Moravcik government 
who are not very well known, even to the Slovak public. This 
does not apply to the finance minister of the Slovak Republic, 
renowned Slovak macroeconomist Rudolf Filkus, who granted the 
following interview to the HOSPODARSKE NOVINY Bratislava 
correspondent: 
  [Zabojnik] What are the principal objectives for your work 
in the ministerial post? 
  [Filkus] We must prove our efforts aimed not only at 
macroeconomic stability but also at microeconomic stability. We 
want to continue in the steps already made and never again 
contemplate some third way to the market. We have already 
passed through trade and price liberalization, the internal 
convertibility of the currency, privatization, and the 
restrictive macreconomic budgetary and monetary policies. 
Because of the conditions that emerge here, we will continue on 
this path. 
  [Zabojnik] Can you be specific about the monetary policy, 
for instance? 
  [Filkus] The finance minister should not speak about what 
the monetary policy should be like. That is the business of the 
National Bank of the Slovak Republic [NBS], and no one should 
interfere. The NBS is here to choose the steps according to its 
criteria, foreign currency reserves, inflation, or the deficit 
budget. Of course, mutual consultations and joint 
considerations of future steps are possible, but only insofar as 
I, as the minister, must help to seek such solutions, given the 
deficit budget, that would not accelerate inflation. I am 
thinking of the combination of banking, monetary, and economic 
tools. 
  [Zabojnik] Which sector of the Slovak economy do you see as 
the most troubled? 
  [Filkus] At present, the economic microsphere is the most 
risky one because it lives not off its results but off the 
principal. This is directly connected to insolvency, and 
especially to privatization, not only from the point of view of 
its acceleration, but also from its depolitization. This 
important tool of the transformation process has become here a 
tool of concentration of political power. 
  [Zabojnik] You were not enthusiastic about this year's 
Slovak budget when you were in the opposition. What specific 
outlet for these opinions will you use now as the minister, at 
the time you are contemplating an amendment to the Law on the 
State Budget? I would be interested most of all in how you want 
to deal with the expenditure side of it. 
  [Filkus] Many of our predecessors proceeded in such a way 
that, if they wanted to balance the budget, they were little by 
little cutting expenditures. The minister and the ministry must 
also be very interested in the revenue channels rather than in 
just keeping on cutting expenditures. Hence, I must also be 
interested in taxes and customs, where there are tremendous 
reserves in scrutiny. 
  [Zabojnik] Thus, you indirectly agree with your predecessor, 
who said that, when the coffers are empty, you can whistle for 
it? 
  [Filkus] O.K., but we have several handicapped sectors, like 
education, health care, and culture, where we cannot effort to 
reduce expenditures. 
  [Zabojnik] Given the objective possibilities of Slovakia, 
can this government proceed in relations with the Czech Republic 
any differently from the way Meciar did? 
  [Filkus] First of all, we must reach such an agreement that 
the results would be in the best interest of both parties. This 
applies to the certificates, customs union, and clearing 
accounts. We have to accommodate each other. In the customs 
union, for instance, the point of departure must be advantageous 
for the two sides, but one must also note the disadvantages for 
either party. Regarding the certificates, we made an 
accommodating step that will facilitate the continuing validity 
of the treaty on the mutual recognition of Czech and Slovak 
documents, and a situation such as there was before will not 
arise at the border. We have also unanimously agreed that the 
old lot of the clearing account [obligations originated before 
the currency division on 8 February 1993] must be abolished, but 
this also depends on parliament.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Havel by correspondent </F>
Eva Hulkova at Hradecek; date not given; from the "Conversations 
at Lany" program --recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Hulkova] Dear friends, we are recording these 
"Conversations" at Hradecek, where the president is ill. I must 
also say that he smokes a little and, as it appears, is 
overdoing it a little. How are you, Mr. President? Are you a 
good patient? 
  [Havel] I have a feeling that I am a perfect patient because 
I take all of the medication prescribed, I am in bed as I am 
supposed to be, and I am even smoking less. But I really do not 
like talking about my health or physical problems, and, if I 
remember correctly, I talked about my viruses extensively in 
"Conversations at Lany" three weeks ago, so I would very much 
not like to talk about it now. I should only like to add that 
the viruses are very unremitting. Simply, we have not been 
successful in destroying them. That is why I am undergoing a 
cure again, and I hope I will finish my cure once and for all 
soon. 
  [Hulkova] How do you feel mentally? It is known that it very 
much influences the curative process. 
  [Havel] I have been completely alone here for a few days. 
Admittedly, I am being guarded by my bodyguards, but they keep a 
fair distance from our house, and I like the loneliness very 
much because, when I am in Prague, naturally, I am surrounded by 
people from morning until night and have little time for this 
kind of concentration and contemplation, for reading. It is 
from this viewpoint that the treatment suits me. 
  [Hulkova] Let us return to when you were still healthy. You 
met at one of your regular quarterly meetings representatives of 
the parliamentary clubs. On such occasions, topical issues are 
usually discussed. It seems to me that one of the most topical 
is the method of elections to the senate. Was this issue 
discussed? 
  [Havel] Yes, you are right. It is a subject discussed a lot 
in our media, and, at the moment, it is very topical so we could 
not avoid it, either. However, it was not the main point of our 
talks. 
  [Hulkova] You are often accused of changing your mind on 
this 
issue. How do you look at it? 
  [Havel] I noticed that I was being suspected of 
this...[pauses] I am a bit surprised because I have always had 
the same opinion on this matter. Perhaps it will not do any 
harm if I repeat it. First, I have never been particularly 
partial to a two-chamber system. However, the opposite view 
won--namely, that we should have the senate. This issue was 
organically incorporated into the Constitution and is an 
integral part of it. I think we should honor the Constitution, 
and, therefore, the senate should be elected this year. In my 
opinion, we would be making a strong attack on the common legal 
consciousness if we treated the Constitution according to our 
whims, if we incorporated into it an institution with a firm 
standing, and, then, because of negligence or failure to agree 
on the election procedures, if we did not establish this 
institution. [passage omitted] 
  I welcomed the constitutional undertaking that the senate 
would have to be elected on the basis of a majority voting 
system. I am a champion of the majority voting system or at 
least, of a combined voting system. [passage omitted] 
  [Hulkova] According to my information, you talked about 
non-profit-making organizations with the deputies. Why is this 
such a problematic subject all the time? 
  [Havel] Much to my pleasure, I learned that all, but really 
all, of the parliamentary clubs agreed with me on the enormous 
importance of this whole sphere of non-profit-making 
organizations, about which I already talked in these 
conversations some time ago and intend to go on talking about. 
They consider it to be extremely important that the law 
regulates this sphere and agree that there is a need for more 
laws on this to be passed by the end of this year so that they 
could start being enforced by 1 January [1995]. 
  The present situation is very bad. It was inherited from the 
communist era, which has divided organizations into so-called 
budgetary and contributory organizations. These are, in effect, 
bodies controlled by the state by means incompatible with 
democratic conditions. All democratic countries have different 
structures [in this field]. The whole sphere of educational, 
health, cultural, and many other undertakings are regulated by 
special laws. [passage omitted] 
  You asked why there was such resistance against [regulating] 
this area. I am not quite sure who is resisting, but I was 
pleased to acknowledge that it was not parliament. 
Transformation of this whole non-profit-making area will 
require, at the same time, the restructuring of this area, and 
it is a process comparable, for example, to the whole process of 
privatization. [passage omitted] 
  [Hulkova] Is the idea of power part of this problem? 
  [Havel] Of course, it is connected with power because the 
issue here is related to decentralization of power. [passage 
omitted] Imagine, for example, that, in a highly charged, very 
dramatic situation, the citizens would be entranced, lulled by a 
political tempter who gains a lot of votes and wins, and then it 
transpires that he is a madman. The point is that the state 
must be able to continue, to flourish, to function, even if it 
is temporarily headed by this madman, until he is replaced by 
somebody else. This is one of the reasons I have undertaken to 
draw attention to this sphere of non-profit-making organizations 
because they are a joint part of decentralized, structured, 
civic society, in which everybody takes a share of 
responsibility for public affairs. 
  [Hulkova] Because we have come to this point, can I ask, as 
editor of Czech radio. which is a public body, about an issue of 
direct concern. You may know that the guardian of our 
treasures, Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, does not agree to 
radio license fees being increased. However, because we do not 
have laws that would punish those who do not pay, Czech Radio 
finds itself in a sad situation. What is your opinion? 
  [Havel] It is narrowly connected to what we discussed before 
with the non-profit-making organizations. After all, radio is 
such a non-profit-making organization. This is very difficult. 
On the one hand, it is obvious how important it is for this 
type of public body to exist. Look at radio or television. If 
they are going to be purely profit-making, they would not be 
able to fulfill to such an extent their aim of reflecting 
independently the world as it is. The same applies if they are 
exclusively state-controlled because then they are dependent on 
the state. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jiri Leschtina: "Puzzling Pleasure on the </F>
Part of the President"] 
  [Text] On Saturday [26 March], President Vaclav Havel 
confided to reporters that he was extraordinarily pleased about 
the proposal by a group of deputies that endeavors to 
consolidate the Civic Democratic Party [ODS] idea of 81 
single-seat constituencies for the senate elections with the 
remainder of the coalition that demands 27 three-seat 
constituencies. The newly emerged "81 + 27" hybrid is, 
however, more reason for lament than pleasure. 
  The "81 + 27" project assumes for the first senate 
elections 27 constituencies, in which the citizens would have 
three votes to cast in three smaller (sub)wards. While we would 
have 81 small wards, the citizen would not vote for a single 
senator in his ward, as proposed by the traditional majority 
system, but also in two additional ones. Moreover, these 81 
wards are to exist only the first time around. In the 
subsequent senate elections, the citizens would only vote for 
one candidate in 27 large constituencies, as the smaller 
coalition parties headed by the Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA] 
demanded from the very beginning. 
  In other words, the deputies propose: In the first year, we 
will satisfy the ODS's demand for 81 wards (no longer according 
to the pure majority principle of one candidate-one vote), and, 
in subsequent years, we will transfer to the ODA system. Every 
second year, then, a single senator would be elected in each of 
the 27 wards. In the meantime, the ODS proposal has the citizen 
elect his senator once in six years. 
  Why, however, is the president so pleased with this 
pseudocompromise, when he recently declared that he likes the 
idea of small single-seat constituencies, calling it a pure 
majority system as prescribed by the Constitution? 
  It seems that, at the last moment, the president revised his 
opinion so he does not have to support the ODS in its struggle 
against the ODA and the Christian and Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party [KDU-CSL]. The meeting on 
Thursday [24 March] between the president and [ODA chairman] Jan 
Kalvoda and [KDU-CSL chairman] Josef Lux (for the second time in 
absence of Vaclav Klaus] indicates that a certain triumvirate is 
emerging for defense against the prime minister and his party. 
  There is nothing wrong with Havel, Lux, and Kalvoda feeling 
the need to join hands and face the hegemony of Czech politics 
together. Nevertheless, it is no reason for the president to 
turn away from the practical project of the ODS, which complies 
with the constitutional stipulations better than any of the 
other projects.

  [Text] Skopje, April 3 (AFP) -- Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM] Sunday [3 April] accused 
Albania of trying to manipulate the independence-minded ethnic 
Albanian minority in this former Yugoslav republic. 
  The ethnic Albanians are seeking a degree of autonomy 
bordering on independence for a third of Macedonia's territory, 
mainly in areas where they form a majority of the population, 
such as on the frontier with Albania itself. 
  The Macedonian Government says the Albanians comprise 20 
percent of the population of 2.3 million people. The ethnic 
Albanians put it at 50 percent. 
  The main Albanian political party in Macedonia, the 
Democratic Prosperity Party, which is part of the coalition 
government in power in Skopje, split into two factions in 
February. 
  That rupture "was caused by direct interference from 
Tirana," 
Macedonian Interior Minister Ljubomir Frckovski said in an 
interview with AFP. 
  A party congress at which the split occurred was attended by 
lawmakers and diplomats from Albania proper. 
  The traditional leadership of the party was accused by 
Albania of damaging the cause of the Albanian minority in 
Macedonia. The leader of the new faction, 28-year-old Menduh 
Taqi, has received a hero's welcome in Albania. 
  But while he had tough words for Albania, Frckovski 
suggested 
that 30 ethnic Albanians due to go on trial for allegedly 
running guns to Albanian militia here would not have the book 
thrown at them. 
  Although the defendants could be sentenced to between two 
and 
10 years, the minister said, "Harsh sentences should not be 
expected."

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Foreign Minister Benjamino Andreatta </F>
for PULS by unidentified correspondent; place and date not 
given: "Italy Interested in Stability in Macedonia"] 
  [Text] Just a few days before the parliamentary elections 
in Italy, Italian Foreign Minister Benjamino Andreatta gave an 
exclusive interview for the weekly PULS (to be published 
tomorrow) in which he answered a number of questions related to 
political events in Italy, in Europe, and, in particular, the 
war in Bosnia. Of course, the accent was on the situation in the 
Balkans, more precisely on the situation in the Republic of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
in its dispute with neighboring Greece, as well as on general 
relations between Italy and Macedonia. 
  On the importance of the new transport corridor -- the 
corridor linking Italy, Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, and 
Turkey, Benjamino Andreatta stated: "Italy is very favorably 
viewing the project for the construction of a trans-Balkan 
east-west railway and highway corridor that could be a basic 
component for pursuing cooperation between the states in this 
region, as well as with the surrounding states, one of which is 
Italy, due to its geographic position. The initiative was 
renewed at the recent meeting in Sofia attended by 
representatives of transport ministries of the interested 
countries, when the `Memorandum of Understanding' was signed, 
confirming the commitment and good will for the realization of 
this project." 
  "The realization of the corridor," Andreatta emphasized, 
"would enable Macedonia to be better and more equally included 
in the system of European transport networks. Soon the BERS 
[not further specified] organization will send a mission to 
Skopje to determine priority spheres of involvement." 
  Commenting on the development of relations between the two 
countries, the Italian foreign minister also said: 
  "As you know, Italy has actively contributed to the 
stabilization of the new republic born after the dissolution of 
the former Yugoslavia, by assisting its gradual involvement in 
international life and activities. It is doing so with the firm 
belief that the association with Macedonia will have a positive 
effect on the realization of a gradual and desired stabilization 
of the entire Balkan region. In this context, Rome decided to 
establish diplomatic relations with Skopje on 16 December of 
last year. As a matter of fact, even before the establishment 
of diplomatic relations with Italy, continuing activity for 
support of your country had begun in the relevant international 
organizations, in reply to requests for economic aid submitted 
by the Macedonian Government. Parallel to that, Italy 
persistently supported the admission of your country to the 
Central European Initiative within the purview of supporting and 
approaching Macedonia, and it also expressed its wholehearted 
support to its admission to the CSCE [Conference for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe] which has, unfortunately, not yet 
been accomplished, due to the opposition of some member states." 
  "On the basis of such premises," Benjamino Andreatta pointed 
out, "there is a lot of room for strengthening bilateral 
cooperation, particularly on the economic and cultural plane. 
We will dedicate our attention to that in near future, with the 
hope that in the meantime conditions of stability and peace will 
be reestablished in the Balkans, that will ease the 
intensification of bilateral cooperation with all the countries 
in the region, including the Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia." 
  About the dispute with Greece, as well as its implications 
on 
security in the region, the Italian foreign minister emphasized 
that Italy was deeply concerned about the possible negative 
consequences on stability in the region after the restrictive 
measures undertaken by Athens. "Italy," Andreata emphasized, 
"together with the other European partners, never misses the 
opportunity to present that concern to Athens." He also pointed 
out that the Italian side looks forward to the resumption of 
direct negotiations between the two sides as soon as possible, 
in order to create prerequisites for a gradual normalization of 
bilateral relations between Macedonia and Greece. "In that 
regard, it will be necessary, more precisely it will be 
indispensable for both the sides, to demonstrate the needed 
flexibility," Andreata said in his exclusive interview for PULS.

<F P=106> [Article by Zoran Petrov: "Black Clouds From the Bosnian </F>
Sky"] 
  [Text] With any possible airstrike against the 
Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the first to suffer 
will be the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]; can the UN 
peacekeeping forces be pulled out of the Bosnian hell?; the 
direct involvement of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] 
in the conflict is almost certain, through which the war would 
actually spread beyond Bosnia-Herzegovina's borders; an 
"extraordinary chance" to include other forces as well in the 
possible conflict. 
  The long-announced military intervention by the Western 
allies to break the 22-month-old blockade of Sarajevo is 
becoming more and more certain, especially after the massacre in 
the Sarajevo market, in which 68 people died and over 200 were 
wounded by a shell's explosion, and after the UN's official 
request to NATO for authorization for airstrikes in Bosnia, or, 
more specifically, for bombing the Serbian artillery positions 
around Sarajevo. It seems that the international community's 
prolonged hesitation and wait-and-see attitude are finally over. 
The key decision was adopted the day before yesterday in the 
evening in Brussels at a meeting of ambassadors from the 16 NATO 
members, with the declaration of the critical date--21 February, 
one hour after midnight, when NATO planes will bomb artillery 
sites within a radius of about 20 kilometers around Sarajevo. 
The ultimatum, formulated as a warning primarily to the Serbian 
side, refers to the withdrawal of all of the heavy weapons and 
their placement under UNPROFOR control by a set date and time. 
  Regardless of the announcement of the international 
community's last argument of persuasion, military intervention, 
which the world public received in a way with a great deal of 
relief and support, many unresolved questions nevertheless 
remain despite everything. Will the air intervention against the 
Bosnian Serbs' artillery positions around Sarajevo settle the 
Bosnian conflict? To what extent would such a step by the 
Western alliance serve to establish the peace that is so much 
desired in the embattled region, especially after the statements 
by the leaders of the so-called republic of Srpska that they 
will defend themselves by all means available? Are there 
possibilities that after such an action the war might spread 
beyond Bosnia-Herzegovina's borders? Where is Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] in such a possible 
course of events, and what are the realistic chances that it 
might also become involved in the conflict? 
<H5>  UNPROFOR the First to Suffer </H5>
  According to the chief of the General Staff of the Army of 
the Republic of Macedonia [ARM], Major General Dragoljub 
Bocinov, the airstrike by NATO or UN forces against the Bosnian 
Serbs' artillery positions will complicate the already extremely 
delicate and complex situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This will 
already nullify even the present limited control over this 
military hot spot, thus creating broad possibilities for the 
conflict to spread and for it to be regionalized in southern 
Europe, with complete destabilization of the Balkans and with 
their being drawn into a zone of constant conflicts. One of the 
most essential aspects of the already announced intervention and 
the possibilities of its escalation into an open conflict 
between two or more combatants, according to General Bocinov, is 
the Serbs' attitude toward the UNPROFOR units deployed in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. In an operational sense, the UN forces have 
an enclave deployment, which means that they are not linked in a 
combat line and are in a situation of strategic encirclement. In 
other words, the chief of the General Staff emphasizes, to a 
certain extent they are already hostages. According to our 
interlocutor, an extremely significant element in this context 
is the attitude of the Western governments which have their own 
peacekeeping contingents in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In their 
assessments at any level of the balance of power, human life is 
the number one factor, and thus saving and protecting the troops 
in the UN multinational contingent can play the deciding role 
here. Thus, Bocinov emphasizes, these countries can be expected 
to decide to withdraw their forces, which in the first place is 
almost impossible in the present conditions, and in the second 
place, even then the conflicts will increase in intensity, 
ferocity, and uncontrollability. 
  This position coincides with the view of retired Major 
General Todor Atanasovski, namely the possibility that the UN 
may decide to abandon the battlefield and continue political and 
economic pressure, leaving the combatants to themselves. The 
only logic of this goal, according to General Atanasovski, is to 
maintain the conflict within the present limits. Many problems 
arise in this case, however, as he emphasizes. In the first 
place, whether the world can accept such an inhuman step with a 
clear conscience, and whether it is even possible for the UN 
forces to be withdrawn from Bosnia-Herzegovina at such a 
juncture. One has to bear in mind that their main goal at 
present is to protect humanitarian convoys, which in a way are 
the last crumb of hope for numerous unfortunates in Bosnia. With 
the possible withdrawal of the peacekeeping forces, in addition 
to the loss of any control and any sort of influence and 
mediation among the combatants, UNPROFOR may become their common 
enemy, and be attacked on all sides. This is the most difficult 
alternative to implement, Atanasovski emphasizes, although the 
governments of the countries that have their own contingents in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are becoming more and more nervous about the 
fate of their troops, and some of them, like France recently, 
have already announced the possibility of withdrawing them. 
<H5>  Will the Bosnian Cauldron Overflow? </H5>
  As an area that objectively gravitates toward the unsettled 
region and in a way is located in the critical zone, Macedonia 
is directly affected by the Bosnian military outcome. As 
Slobodan Dimiskovski, a doctor of military sciences and an 
expert on this problem, emphasizes, the FRY's attitude toward 
military intervention against the Bosnian Serbs is a significant 
aspect of a speculative situation thus formulated. One can 
assert with a considerable degree of certainty, Dimiskovski 
says, that the FRY would become involved in supporting, i.e., in 
the actions and operations of, the army of the so-called 
republic of Srpska. The general situation would thereby become 
more complicated not only in the area of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but 
also in a much broader area, including even the entire Balkans, 
and within them Macedonia as well. Retired Lt. General Mitre 
Arsovski, the former chief of the ARM's General Staff, has an 
almost identical view of things; in his opinion, the most 
natural thing is to expect direct intervention by the Republic 
of Serbia and its involvement in the conflict. General Arsovski 
emphasizes that this directly raises the possibility of an 
expansion of combat operations into the FRY as well, which, by 
the way, also borders on the Republic of Macedonia. In his 
opinion, a second significant element in assessing the possible 
course of events after air attacks against the Serbian positions 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina is the fact that fighter-bombers will fly 
from the aircraft carriers in the Adriatic and from the NATO 
bases in Italy. And what will happen, Arsovski asks, if the 
bases in Greece are used, even if the latter country still 
opposes it? In his opinion, if this possibility is realized, 
which is fairly likely in a given course of events, then by 
yielding its air space for overflight by American aircraft 
Macedonia would indirectly be joining one side, in all of this 
development of the conflict assumed so far. 
  This is essentially the worst alternative for the country's 
security, since in one speculative situation thus formulated the 
reality would be a response by Serbia using the so-called 
retaliatory strategy, at first against the U.S. troops on the 
Macedonian-Serbian border and then in a later phase against the 
Republic of Macedonia, thus creating a hot spot with 
unforeseeable consequences for the entire Balkans, or for the 
security of Europe in general. The situation can also be 
complicated in another way. According to General Bocinov's 
estimates, the Bosnian barrel can overflow at the moment when 
Izetbegovic's Bosnian army sees its own chance in the escalation 
of the entire conflict, and it will very likely also be joined 
by the Muslims in Sandzak and Montenegro. Bocinov says that 
this, at the same time, will also be an extraordinary 
opportunity for the Albanians from Kosovo, and then from Western 
Macedonia, who in a situation in which there would be military 
pressure and the expulsion of the Serbs from their positions in 
Bosnia, to join in the conflict. In effect, the chief of the 
ARM's General Staff emphasizes, this would mean the beginning of 
a hellish cauldron in which everyone would be against everyone. 
<H5>  Will the Americans Attack? </H5>
  The model for the outcome of the Bosnian conflict that is 
now 
being applied did not arise as a well-considered military system 
but rather arose step-by-step and was carried out partially, 
gradually, and in a palliative manner, General Atanasovski 
thinks. In his opinion, that lack of coordination is also 
reflected on the formal level--from resolutions, through 
conferences, to one more partial measure, namely the threat of 
air attacks against the Serbian positions. Obviously, 
Atanasovski emphasizes, the results of the latest initiative 
will be the same as the ones to date, i.e., this maximalization 
of the pressure indicates the counterproductive nature of the 
entire action. Instead of ending the war, it will lead to an 
even greater intensification of combat operations. The only 
model for resolving the Bosnian war, according to Atanasovski, 
should start with noting that the status of the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has already passed the level at which it is 
not important who is the aggressor and who is the victim. That 
former definition, Atanasovski claims, no longer makes any 
sense. "I agree and I accept the fact that the Serbs are the 
cause of the war," he says, "but the future operation will have 
to disarm all the armed sides in the Bosnian region, regardless 
of which side they belong to. That means their forcible 
immobilization and forced isolation in the entire war hot spot, 
and furthermore for a long period." According to Atanasovski, 
this is the only good solution for the Bosnian conflict. 
  On the other hand, as Dr. Dimiskovski emphasizes, it is 
unlikely that the airstrikes will even be carried out, 
regardless of all the seriousness of the NATO ultimatum. There 
were decrees in the past and they were almost always 
counterproductive, and thus Karadzic also said in response to 
the last warning that the Serbs would defend themselves by all 
means available. A similar attitude is also displayed by General 
Mitre Arsovski, according to whom airstrikes by NATO forces 
against the Serbian positions in Bosnia will not be carried out, 
and at the moment they serve to intimidate and exert 
psychological pressure and coercion for new negotiations. "I 
personally think," he says, "that by using air power alone one 
cannot resolve the situation on the front in Bosnia, and if it 
is used, it will be more demonstrative in nature." 
  In any case, regardless of whether these are empty threats 
or 
a warning that will be carried out at any cost, the fact is that 
a new, and perhaps the most serious trial for peace in the 
entire region to date is in sight. Everything else is entering 
an area of great uncertainty.

<H5>  Dragoljub Bocinov, Major General and Chief of the ARM </H5>
General Staff: "NATO Cannot Repeat `Desert Storm'" 
  For the time being the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is on 
the brink between war and peace. It is balancing between these 
two options, since it is already clear that there cannot be a 
middle solution. At the moment, the most problematic is the 
answer to the question of whether Serbian wants peace and a 
peaceful settlement of the war, since if it is achieved there 
will be serious internal upheavals, and even its 
destabilization. Imagine what would happen if 200,000-300,000 
armed soldiers returned to the FRY, which has already been 
devastated by the international sanctions. In other words, it is 
an extremely likely assumption that ending the war does not suit 
Serbia at all. 
  On the other hand, it is more than clear that NATO or the 
United States cannot implement in Bosnia-Herzegovina or repeat 
the model of the ground-air-sea battle of January 1991 from the 
"Desert Storm" operation, since at the moment they do not have a 
ground base organized. Without ground forces, territory cannot 
be conquered and the war cannot be resolved. 
<H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5>
<H5>  Slobodan Dimiskovski, Doctor of Military Sciences: "The Most </H5>
Horrible War in All Human History" 
  Hypothetically, in my opinion at least two options are 
possible for a Bosnian settlement. The first would be concrete 
implementation of the Karadjordjevo agreement between Milosevic 
and Tudjman, i.e., combined Serbian-Croatian forces would 
definitively defeat the Muslim army. This would achieve the main 
strategic goal--preventing, at any cost, the formation of an 
Islamic state in the Balkans, and creating a Greater Serbia and 
Croatia within their historical borders. 
  The second option is based on the assumption that the UN, 
the 
EU, and NATO will not succeed in using negotiations, political 
means, and even airstrikes to settle the Bosnian crisis, and 
then it is likely that the UNPROFOR units will be withdrawn from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The fate of the three hostile ethnic groups 
would thus essentially be left to their leaders and armies. That 
would constitute a horror in comparison with all wars in the 
course of all human history.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Prime Minister Nikola Kljusev by M. </F>
Jovanovski; date and place not given: "Social Endurance Like the 
Sword of Damocles"] 
  [Text] It seems that there is a tendency her for us 
to get used to the deficit in public spending; any effort to 
find a solution for getting out of the crisis, if it is 
realistically weighed, should be accepted; we do not have any 
institutions for measuring social endurance. 
  These days the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia --FYROM] Government's stabilization program is a 
frequent topic of discussion, both in the Assembly where it was 
adopted, and outside the parliament, at professional or less 
professional meetings. A large number of economists have also 
expressed their own opinion of it; they have evaluated the 
solutions envisioned for various sections of the program, each 
from his own standpoint. In several reviews, however, it seems 
to have been forgotten that we already have experience in 
creating our own program. This has to do with the Anti-Inflation 
Program, as it was officially called, or the "Easter" Program, 
as the people later called it. We talked about stabilization in 
1994, but also about other things, with one of the creators of 
the "Easter" Program, and at that time the head of the expert 
government--Academician Nikola Kljusev. 
  [Jovanovski] Mr. Kljusev, we are at the end of 1993, when 
results in various fields are being summed up. How do you assess 
the past year, viewed in economic terms? 
  [Kljusev] This year was also a very critical one, both in 
terms of events in Macedonia in the area of interethnic 
relations, and on the economic level. From the economic 
standpoint, several qualitative changes occurred in the economy 
and in general in the standard of living. The assessment is that 
we are still sinking toward the bottom of the crisis. On the 
other hand, several significant economic indicators are showing 
negative tendencies--the social product and employment are 
declining, there are no investments.... The losses are much 
larger than the modest capital formation. In spite of that, 
consumption is growing. Personal consumption has grown by about 
26 percent, and public spending is showing an enormous deficit. 
We also appear to be getting used to that deficit. If public 
spending is swallowing up 10 percent of the social product, the 
fact that it will fall to 6 percent in 1994 cannot make us happy. 
  [Jovanovski] The deficit will be covered from foreign 
sources, however. 
  [Kljusev] Those indicators are bad signals, because we do 
not 
have resources of our own to cover the deficit. It is an 
extremely complex problem. Thus, the economy is showing a 
structural atrophy, as well as declining trends--by 15 percent 
in industry, by 20 percent in agriculture (with the drought also 
having an effect), but also in other sectors. All of this 
induces caution, with the aim of opposing those trends and 
stopping consumption. The intentions of neutralizing the 
unfavorable effects of the declining trends are therefore noble 
ones. 
  [Jovanovski] In your opinion, what are the stabilization 
program's chances of success? 
  [Kljusev] Basically, any effort to find a solution for 
getting out of the crisis, if it is realistically weighed, 
should be accepted, if it is not based on illusory and 
exaggerated optimism. In that regard, it can be said that the 
program, as an effort to get out of the unfavorable situation, 
undoubtedly constitutes an expression of positive aspirations. 
If one studies it thoroughly and looks at its anatomy, 
however--the pillars on which it is based--one will see that its 
goals and ambitions are in conflict with the center of gravity 
that it does not have. It is simply not catching up. 
  [Jovanovski] What center of gravity do you have in mind? 
  [Kljusev] The center of gravity here is not the real economy 
and its potential; it is not the productivity and capital 
formation capacity of the national economy; instead, it has to 
be financial support from abroad. 
  [Jovanovski] What are the similarities and differences 
between the stabilization program and your Anti-Inflation 
Program? 
  [Kljusev] The theoretical postulates are the same. At that 
time we did not have a chance of expecting financial aid, since 
relations with the International Monetary Fund and the World 
Bank had not been settled, but the anchors were clearly 
emphasized: the foreign exchange rate, wages and the freeze on 
them, and prices and the monetary sphere, in which we 
established discipline. The "Easter" Program, however, fell 
precisely over what this program is going back to, namely the 
regulation of relationships in consumption. At that time, 
however, several frivolous deputies proposed a law on wages that 
the government did not support. The president of the Assembly 
also raised his hand in accepting such an idea. 
  [Jovanovski] In your opinion, what was the real reason for 
the adoption of the law on wages? 
  [Kljusev] There were probably manipulations by several 
parties that wanted to come to power. We reduced inflation of 74 
percent a month to 6 percent in August. The program fell, 
however, and so did the government. Let's not go into that. The 
essential thing is that those who voted against the program then 
have sobered up. They are beginning to realize that 
relationships in public and private consumption should be 
settled, and that a justifiably restrictive approach should be 
established. 
<H5>  Under the Conductor's Baton </H5>
  [Jovanovski] Will the people be able to endure that 
restrictive approach? 
  [Kljusev] Well, that is the key question. Actually, the 
program was worked out under the conductor's baton of the IMF 
and the World Bank. It is not our invention. How much it is our 
wish is even questionable. We are in debt to these institutions, 
but also to commercial banks. The IMF, however, has strict 
criteria regarding the repayment of loans, it does not allow 
rescheduling, but the IMF gives the green light for financial 
relations with the rest of the world. We are undoubtedly under a 
strict conductor's baton. The IMF's criteria are aimed at 
creating the conditions for repaying of the debt to the World 
Bank, and so actually a bridge arrangement is being established, 
a bypass arrangement to settle the obligations to these 
financial institutions, in the amount of $137 million. We are 
also prisoners in that respect. 
  [Jovanovski] We will have to face repayment of the debt at 
some point. Now we will have to repay the old debt, but we will 
receive new loans. What is the best thing to do in this 
situation? 
  [Kljusev] We should utilize the situation rationally. We 
should achieve creditworthiness abroad and initiate our projects 
that will be attractive to world financial institutions and the 
world industrial sector. We have to focus on joint investments, 
and not establish ties only with financial institutions on a 
credit basis. That would be fatal. 
  [Jovanovski] The loan approved by the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development for our Electrical Industry is a 
good sign, of course? 
  [Kljusev] It is a good chance. We have to make sure that all 
that money is utilized efficiently and fully in the economy. Not 
one dollar should go into consumption. 
  [Jovanovski] Let's go back to the stabilization program. How 
much can the completely unachieved but sought-after consensus 
affect implementation of the program? 
  [Kljusev] In this case we have to have a realistic attitude 
in assessing the partners. It has to do with the relationship 
among all the partners--the government, employers (i.e., the 
chamber), and the trade union. All three partners are not clear 
representatives in the role that they are supposed to play. The 
government, through the parliament, is not expressing the will 
of all the deputies, and, one might say, of the people as a 
whole. That is indicative, as the criticisms being made of the 
program and the criticisms being made of its adoption are 
refuted. Employers are unknown. Traditionally they are owners, 
but in our country a quasi-role is played by the chamber, 
reluctantly. The trade union likewise does not fully represent 
the working class, in conditions in which other independent 
trade unions exist. It does represent the lion's share of 
employees, however, and they should have been prepared for the 
price of depriving the working class of its subsistence. That 
price was recognized after the fact. That lack of preparation is 
making employees into potential opponents of the program. If the 
government wanted the program to be a national one or a state 
one, then all the entities should have been prepared while it 
was being coordinated. 
<H5>  Exaggerated Optimism </H5>
  [Jovanovski] But you have also developed your own program? 
  [Kljusev] We drafted it only because of the fact that along 
with the anti-inflation program, we also introduced our own 
currency. That is the biggest secret. The journalists' prior 
announcement of the introduction of the denar resulted in 
damages of several million marks, in just two or three days. 
  [Jovanovski] At the beginning you mentioned a 
term--exaggerated optimism. What do you mean by that? 
  [Kljusev] I mentioned it because significant areas have not 
been regulated here. In the first place, a systemic approach has 
not been completed in economics and in the economy. It is 
sufficient to mention the lack of a law on firms, i.e., 
enterprises. With respect to the development of the tax system, 
however, I agree on this. In this case the state should 
demonstrate its honor, its dignity, and its responsibility. If 
it gives in on taxes, then it cannot be a law-governed state, 
since in the West, the basic attitude of the citizen toward the 
state is viewed in terms of taxes. 
  [Jovanovski] Yes, but here the state has bought social peace 
by not collecting taxes. 
  [Kljusev] Well, it is an extremely significant issue. Why 
did 
we have that much of an increase in wages, 26 percent? Why do we 
have an enormous deficit in the public sector? Isn't that an 
answer to your question, that social peace is being bought? If 
that spiral continues, nothing will be left of this program. 
  [Jovanovski] The program provides for a real reduction in 
wages. How far can social endurance be stretched? 
  [Kljusev] I don't know how much the program is interfering 
with social endurance. Won't it collapse through several 
unwanted incidents? It is like a sword of Damocles hanging over 
the program. Who is studying social endurance in our country? 
There are institutions in the world that research it. All of the 
shifts and conflicts are giving signals that the government 
measures are being modified. There are also many other 
unresolved issues, however--political tolerance, slow 
privatization, rehabilitation of the banking sector, which is of 
exceptional significance and should be carried out as quickly as 
possible.... 
<H5>  [Box, p 3] </H5>
<H5>  Clearing Up Banks' Bad Debts </H5>
  It is very important to reexamine the entire banking system, 
which is perhaps the most problematic aspect now. It is sinking 
in various bad debts which are carried over from year to year, 
and if that trend continues, it will affect the entire economy. 
The government assumed a big obligation by specifying that the 
rehabilitation would begin in four months. The unrehabilitated 
banks can be a weak point in controlling financial flows and 
financial services provided by the banking system to the economy 
and the populace. 
  I am not completely certain whether a Bank Rehabilitation 
Agency should be formed or whether they should be rehabilitated 
bank by bank. If, for example, Komercijalna Banka has carried 
out some sort of rehabilitation itself, for which it has 
received certification by an international institution, it 
should be allowed to operate. One or two healthy operational 
branches should be taken away from Stopanska Banka and the 
headquarters and the rest of the branches, for example, should 
be rehabilitated. It is a difficult process that will require 
both time and money, and personnel changes at the banks. 
<H5>  [Box, p 3] </H5>
<H5>  Limiting Factors </H5>
  [Jovanovski] What factors can have a limiting effect on 
successful implementation of the stabilization program? 
  [Kljusev] In addition to the uncompleted economic system and 
social endurance, disruptions may also occur because only the 
social sector is being taken into account in personal 
consumption. But how much does the private sector share in that 
consumption, and how much does the gray economy? The latter is 
distorting the scale of the so-called effective consumer. There 
are people with uncontrolled sources of income who are exerting 
pressure on that sphere. There is nothing on them if they buy a 
modern type of automobile, and so forth. And an enormous part of 
the population is below the poverty line, on the brink of 
subsistence. The program did not take into account how much of 
total consumption consists of uncontrolled income from the gray 
economy. Balance-sheets should have been prepared for that, just 
as balance-sheets should have been prepared for all the debts 
and for all the obligations, both those abroad and the domestic 
debts, and then it should be stated what relationships will be 
like in the economic consumption sector, in public consumption, 
and in personal consumption. That leads into the issue of social 
endurance. We are also very vulnerable in the area of political 
tolerance. To what extent does it exist? A consensus has not 
been reached on issues that should naturally link us. Next, 
there is the slow transformation of ownership. Is there any 
insight into the positive and negative effects of the slow 
transformation model? In addition to those internal factors, 
there are also several external ones, which primarily have to do 
with our surroundings.

<F P=106> [Report by Istvan Kulcsar] </F>
  [Text] Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross and Russian 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, along with the Hungarian and 
Russian ministers concerned, signed six documents early this 
afternoon in the Cupola Hall of the parliament building here in 
Budapest. 
  At their subsequent news conference, Peter Boross 
highlighted 
two agreements in particular: The first provides for the 
transportation to Russia of the spent heating elements of the 
Paks nuclear power station, and the second for the settling of 
the Russian debt. The modalities of the latter are to be 
services, deliveries of goods, and access for the Hungarian side 
to property in Russia in Russian or mixed enterprises. 
  The latter was warmly welcomed by Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin, who stated that the trade the two countries 
conducted with each other last year could be doubled or even 
tripled in the medium term. 
  In answer to questions, the Russian prime minister said that 
his country welcomes Hungary's intention to join the European 
Union. As for Hungary's possibly joining NATO, that is 
something that will have to be decided by the Hungarian 
leadership and the Hungarian people. 
  Peter Boross stated that the Hungarian-Russian discussions 
have been even more successful than expected.

<F P=106> [Mioara Negescu report: "Pavel Grachev: `We Had a </F>
Political Dialogue With President Iliescu'"] 
  [Text] On Tuesday [29 March] at Cotroceni Palace, 
Romania's President Ion Iliescu received Army General Pavel 
Sergeyevich Grachev, defense minister of the Russian Federation. 
The meeting was attended on the Romanian side by National 
Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca and presidential counselors 
[Colonel General] Vasile Ionel and Traian Chebeleu. 
  In a statement made to the press after his meeting with 
President Iliescu, the Russian minister noted that "we agreed 
that our economic relations could be improved and enlarged, and 
this may only be achieved if the prime ministers of Romania and 
Russia meet in the very near future. 
  We had a political dialogue with Mr. Iliescu, during which I 
briefed your president on the political situation in our 
country, on the actions taken both by the [Russian] government 
and President Yeltsin to solve various domestic and foreign 
policy issues, as well as on the stage reached in the reform. I 
asked President Iliescu whether he has a message to be conveyed 
to President Yeltsin, and he very clearly replied that Romania 
wishes to cooperate more closely with Russia and that he wishes 
to meet President Yeltsin as early as this year. As a matter of 
fact, Russia's intentions are identical, in the sense that it 
also wishes to strengthen relations between our countries, as 
from a certain moment those relations have unfortunately become 
looser. Together with President Iliescu we also touched on the 
issue of the Partnership for Peace. We share a number of views: 
The Partnership ought to be based on the principles of equality 
among its members, there should not be any teachers and pupils, 
there should be a basic balance and mutual advantage, and all 
European states, under equitable conditions for all, should be 
involved in the ensuring of their joint security."

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 4 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leaders 
warned the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] on Monday [4 April] 
against sending more military observers to Gorazde as Sarajevo 
radio reported "bitter fighting" around the besieged Moslem-held 
enclave in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Spokesman Rob Annink said the Serbs had advised UNPROFOR to 
put off the dispatch of a team of UN military observers (UNMO) 
to Gorazde because of what they described as a Bosnian army 
offensive carried out from Gorazde both towards Zepa to the 
north and towards Sarajevo, further west. 
  Sarajevo radio said fighting was continuing around Gorazde 
for the seventh straight day. Since besieging Serb forces 
launched shelling attacks on the enclave last Tuesday, according 
to the Bosnian authorities, 47 civilians have been killed with 
207 others wounded. 
  The radio said around 30 troop transporters had arrived 
bringing reinforcements to the Serb side. 
  Sarajevo has called on the international community to take 
action to protect the enclave, designated by the United Nations 
last year as a "safe area." 
  Only four UNMO members are currently stationed in the 
enclave, so that UNPROFOR is able to obtain only limited 
information about the situation there. 
  Annink moreover said a convoy of three light armoured 
vehicles, three tanks, three trucks and three mortars had been 
seen crossing the military exclusion zone, travelling towards 
Gorazde, in clear violation of the February ceasefire accord 
between Bosnians and Serb separatists. 
  The Serb authorities in Pale, the separatist stronghold, 
have 
refused to allow a convoy of aid provided by the UH High 
Commissioner for Refugees to make its way to Gorazde, giving no 
reason, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said. 
  Meanwhile the situation in Prijedor in western Bosnia, where 
last week 18 Moslems and two Croats were murdered by local 
Serbs, was calm Monday as Red Cross spokeswoman Vanya Kewley 
said talks were beginning at Pale to organise the evacuation of 
up to 6,000 people from the region. 
  Janowski, citing a UNHCR official in Prijedor, said there 
were no Serb police patrolling the streets of the town. 
  The police chief in the town, Bogdan Delic, had asked 
Moslems 
to stay, offering them security guarantees. However this had 
not been enough to reassure the Moslem population, Janowksi said. 
  Kewley said Andreas Kuhn, head of the International 
Committee 
of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegation in Zagreb, was to meet the 
Bosnian Serb authorities to work out details of the operation, 
which would be the largest organised movement of civilians since 
the fighting began in April 1992. 
  The operation to be carried out by ICRC and UN personnel is 
to begin on Tuesday. 
  Bosnian authorities have given their assent to the operation 
after the killing of the 20 non-Serbs heightened the insecurity 
of Moslems and Croats remaining in the area around Banja Luka, a 
Serb-controlled territory. UN and ICRC officials have denied 
that this is tantamount to aiding the Serbs in their campaign of 
ethnic cleansing.

<F P=106> [Interview under the "Leaders" rubric with Polish President </F>
Lech Walesa by special correspondents Viktor Loshak and Valeriy 
Masterov at the Belweder Palace in Warsaw; date not given: 
"Lech Walesa: Neither Russia nor Poland Can Be Moved to 
America; We Are Forced To Depend on One Another"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Proposals 
are now being voiced in the United States that Poland and 
Ukraine should become a kind of "buffer zone" between the giants 
of Europe--Russia and Germany. What is your view of that? 
  [Walesa] People think up different things. I am a practical 
politician. The theoreticians have to do something, so they 
fantasize. But, as a practical man, I understand that the 
exhortations of the new era are different. Such comparisons, 
"buffer zones" and so forth, mean that we have still not broken 
away from the past. All of this is still a case of thinking in 
the category of the "division of the world" into two parts. But 
the world does not divide like that, of course. The differences 
are beginning to disappear. Of course, the world can be divided 
into the more developed and the less developed, the richer and 
the less rich. I think that, in this case, it is illogical now 
to speak of various zones. Even if everything were fine with 
us--that is, with Russia, Ukraine, and Poland--it would still 
take us 20 years to catch up with the West. Yes, there are 20 
years of development ahead of us. But the West is choking; it is 
suffering from overproduction. It needs us to enable it to 
develop at all. The West needs us more than we need the West! 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Were your previous hopes of Western 
aid 
justified? 
  [Walesa] I have never counted on Western aid. History has 
taught us quite well that we cannot seriously count on the West. 
We have received no aid from it apart from promises, and they 
were late, what is more. But you cannot complain about 
that--such is the way of the world. Business is business. What 
has sentiment got to do with it? Sentiment gets in the way. 
But, if you are talking about my disappointment with the West, 
well, of course, that is real. But it exists in completely 
different categories: The West does not understand what is 
going on here, it does not see us as partners. We and you, we do 
not need anything. All that we want is that they should 
recognize our equal rights and potential. Just as soon as that 
potential is opened up, we will sort things out ourselves. But 
the West opens itself up only if it stands to gain, and it does 
so using its surplus products, its best goods, which we lack. 
But when our goods are competitive and cheap, barriers are set 
up. So the West is very nationalistic; it is just that this a 
different class of nationalism. No, we do not count on any aid. 
We count on equitable and serious partnership. Then we will cope 
with the rest by ourselves. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] At the same time, the impression is 
being created in Russia that what we are seeing in Poland is 
simply some kind of NATO-mania. How do you reconcile this with 
your critical attitude toward the West? 
  [Walesa] Right now, after the disbandment of the Warsaw 
Pact, what is left is the NATO alliance--a stable, clear, and 
comprehensible alliance. Meanwhile, all that was left from the 
Warsaw Pact is unreliable. I have always had a great fear of the 
unreliable. I do not like being caught unawares. At such a 
moment as this, I would like the West to reduce the zone of 
distrust by accepting us and other countries. Then we would all 
be on the same side. We would sit down and talk about how things 
should be and what NATO should be like. But, because we are 
leaving the whole territory in a state of unreliability, there 
is no knowing what might arise here: nationalisms and all kinds 
of other demons, like in Yugoslavia. Anything could happen, but 
we have abandoned it all: We disbanded and we destroyed, but we 
did not manage to create anything. This is not directed against 
Russia. This is an approach to the creation of a united security. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] So, you do not rule out the 
possibility 
of postcommunist revanche in some part of Europe? 
  [Walesa] If we leave this zone of distrust, life will find a 
solution, and it might not be one we like. And the West's 
attitude is facilitating such a possibility. We are already 
seeing its snobbery and arrogance today. And, indeed, something 
might happen that would recreate the old order. Why should we 
repeat that lesson? 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] In other words, the West must insure 
East Europe against possible postcommunist relapses? 
  [Walesa] I say again: The point is to reduce this zone of 
distrust. We have not thought up anything new yet. I am 
certainly not saying that the West is so good, that its 
solutions are so good. We have no alternative. As Churchill 
said: Democracy is the worst of all systems, but no one has 
thought up anything better. If, at the moment, we do not have a 
security system, if we have no other economic system, we must 
affiliate to what there is and then think about it. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] When reading the Polish press, you 
realize that Kaliningrad is virtually the most acute question in 
relations between your country and Russia. 
  [Walesa] Kaliningrad, of course, is a relic of a bygone era, 
like Britain's colonies. Nothing can be changed because no one 
wants to fight or create a dangerous situation. Kaliningrad 
could now become a linking bridge, a unique bridge at the 
junction between two cultures, the peoples, and economic 
concepts, but not a military base because today this is indeed a 
colonial base protecting goodness knows whom and goodness knows 
why. It is dreadfully costly and absolutely senseless. I know 
that there is nowhere for the soldiers to be taken to. I 
understand all that. it is just that we must think about how to 
live not on a basis of struggle but on a basis of logic. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] But why must this base be regarded as 
an attack on Poland? 
  [Walesa] I am not criticizing. I am simply asking the 
question: If we are saying that there are no enemies and that 
we do not want to struggle--either NATO against Russia or Poland 
against Russia--why do we need this? An army should be 
stationed where the land is poor, not in a port where there is 
grain to be shipped and trade to be conducted. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Mr. President, what priorities would 
you highlight in Poland's eastern policy and in Polish-Russian 
relations? 
  [Walesa] In our era, nothing can be imposed on people. As 
politicians, we must encourage, offer incentives, remove 
barriers, and open up all ties. Life and the economy, 
businessmen and industrialists must do their job. We can only 
repeat to them: "Gentlemen, Moscow will always be nearer to 
Warsaw than to Washington." And, therefore, cooperation will 
always be more reliable and advantageous with Warsaw than with 
Washington: nearer, cheaper, and quicker. You cannot move either 
Russia or Poland to America. We are forced to depend on one 
another, we let everyone profit from this illogicality, from our 
squabbles. Let us come to our senses, turn this to our own 
advantage, and then invite others to join in.... [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by G. Mihajlovski: "Additional Contingent of </F>
Americans"] 
  [Excerpts] An additional contingent of 200 to 250 U.S. 
troops will arrive in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] in the next few weeks. This information was 
given by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John 
Shalikashvili at yesterday's news conference in Skopje. 
  Shalikashvili, who had meetings with President of the 
Republic Kiro Gligorov and Defense Minister Vlado Popovski, also 
visited U.S. troops serving as part of the UNPROFOR forces for 
Macedonia, located in the Petrovec military camp, and said at a 
news conference that President Clinton had announced his 
readiness to send more U.S. troops to Macedonia. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Defense Minister of the Republic of Macedonia Vlado 
Popovski also spoke at the news conference, and said that the 
Macedonian side thought that the U.S. contingent should be 
expanded, because that was a way of strengthening the preventive 
peacekeeping. "We agreed that Macedonia represented the key 
factor for peace and stability in the region, and that 
preventive peacekeeping in Macedonia was equally important as 
the solution to the conflict in Bosnia- Herzegovina." 
  Minister Popovski said that they had had discussions about 
military cooperation with the United States, in the sense of 
giving assistance to the transformation of our defense concept 
to NATO standards. On the possible arrival of a U.S. military 
attache in Macedonia, Popovski said that "there obviously is a 
need for a military liaison officer but he will be given the 
status of a military attache after the establishment of full 
diplomatic relations," explaining that the United States had 
also agreed that there was a need to send such a person to 
Macedonia. 
  Asked about possible discussions on ceding the Krivolak 
military camp to U.S. soldiers, Popovski replied: "Such ideas 
are neither current nor initiated by either of the two sides. 
We only discussed possible U.S. assistance in the 
transformation of our army, first of all for the defense of the 
Republic of Macedonia, and for its inclusion in the `Partnership 
for Peace' project." 
  According to the information released from the cabinet of 
the 
president of the Republic of Macedonia, the Macedonian-Greek 
dispute was also a subject of discussions between President 
Gligorov and Shalikashvili (also attended by Foreign Minister 
Stevo Crvenkovski and Popovski), in the sense that it could have 
negative implications for the wider stability in the south of 
the Balkans. President Gligorov personally has renewed the 
request by our state to join the "Partnership for Peace" NATO 
project.

  [Text] Athens, 1 April (MTI) -- Foreign Minister Geza 
Jeszenszky presented Hungary's application for full membership 
in the European Union [EU] to Greek Minister for Foreign and 
European Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos, current president of the 
EU Council. The document was signed by Prime Minister Peter 
Boross. At the same time, Pangalos confirmed that Greece would 
continue to help Hungary attain full EU membership. 
  On presenting the document, Jeszenszky said, "I deem it a 
great honor that I can present Hungarian Prime Minister Peter 
Boross's letter to the president of the Council of the European 
Union in Athens, which cradled Western civilization, in the 
country where the concept of Europe was born. In this letter, 
the Hungarian government expresses its intention to apply for 
admission to the European Union under article 'O' of the 
Maastricht Treaty." 
  "The application to join the greatest and most successful 
venture of European peoples reflects the Hungarian nation's 
commitment to return to the road which it chose a thousand years 
ago. After a long, forced waiting, history has again provided a 
chance for this move." 
  "Our government believes that over the past four years 
Hungary has taken the steps needed to join the organization of 
democratic European market economies." 
  "Our membership bid has the broadest possible support: The 
freely-elected Hungarian Parliament unanimously approved the 
relevant proposal." 
  "While filing our request, I would like to restate the 
position of Hungary's government and Parliament that we 
completely identify with the aims of the European Union, laid 
down in the Maastricht Treaty. We are ready to accept the 
commitments entailed in membership and wish to strengthen the 
process of European integration by joining the organization." 
  "I would like to assure you and the European Union that in 
the coming years Hungary will adopt all legal and economic 
measures necessary for full EU membership as soon as possible." 
  "Hungarian culture was part of European culture even when 
foreign occupiers attempted to isolate us. It is largely thanks 
to art and science that the spirit of European affiliation has 
survived and attempts to subvert our national interests failed." 
  "It is Hungary's conviction that joining the EU makes the 
political processes of the past four years irreversible. This 
is how our nation's security and continuing economic reform 
gains a favorable framework and guarantee. European integration 
is the only way to Hungary's modernization." 
  "I ask, Mr President, that the EU Council discuss our 
application at its April 18 session and forward it to the 
Commission for comment," Jeszenszky said.

  [Text] Athens, 1 April (MTI) -- "Hungary has never strived 
to get into the European Union [EU] to the detriment of others," 
Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said in Athens on Friday [1 
April]. He had never seen EU entry as a kind of competition 
between the region's countries. Hungary has an interest in its 
neighbors, facing similar economic problems, joining the EU at 
about the same time, he added. 
  He said Hungary could well become a full EU member by the 
end 
of the century. All political groups contesting May's elections 
support entry and the mood of country is unlikely to change 
considerably on this at the 1994 election, the Foreign Minister 
claimed. 
  "Among Visegrad countries, EU membership coordination talks 
were most successful with Poland. The Polish bid, even if 
submitted a few days later than Hungary's application, will be 
discussed at the ministerial conference on April 18. We proceed 
together, but may not necessarily reach the goal at the same 
time," Jeszenszky said.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 1/4/1994 -- Besides bilateral 
ties, the consultations held on 31 March in Athens between 
Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu and his Greek 
counterpart, Karolos Papoulias, have occasioned a thorough 
analysis of the crisis in former Yugoslavia, both sides 
insisting on the need to expand the concluded understandings, 
according to an interview granted by the Romanian head of 
diplomacy to Radio Romania Actualitati. 
  The two ministers pointed out the importance of a bilateral 
political dialogue that would enable the two foreign ministries 
to consult and act together under the circumstances of extremely 
rapid developments in the area. 
  "Obviously, besides these general issues, I presented the 
Hellenic side also some major projects of economic collaboration 
for which we have requested political support from the Greek 
authorities," Melescanu said. He also mentioned that they are 
several extremely important projects that are envisaged to be 
worked out with Greece in the ensuing period, projects that are 
to be financed by the European Union, such as the subway in 
Salonika and a electric power railway link between Athens and 
Salonika, in which Romanian companies are interested. 
  The Romanian foreign minister also mentioned that 
discussions 
covered extensively the area of conflict of both sides' 
interest, especially the Yugoslav crisis. "Practically, we 
agreed that several positive signs are showing up and that 
probably Romania's and Greece's contribution is to encourage 
such positive steps and expand the understandings concluded 
until present". 
  In that context Melescanu said that several similarities of 
opinions were noticed, including the idea that the cease-fire 
and the improvement of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
should be used to launch a global process of negotiations that 
would lead thus to a global solution to the crisis in former 
Yugoslavia. Also approached were obviously issues related to 
the economic sanctions, to the embargo, the two sides expressing 
their support for the decision adopted by the European Union 
Committee that is for a correlation of the progress made during 
negotiations with the slackening or the complete lifting of 
economic sanctions.

  [Text] Tirana, April 1 (ATA) -- An interpellation by the 
public order minister, Agron Musaraj, requested by the Socialist 
Party parliamentary group, took place at the People's Assembly 
on March 31. 
  Socialist Deputy Ilir Meta said that public order forces 
have, in some cases, violated the fundamental human rights and 
freedoms, violence has also been exerted against deputies, 
demonstrations and meetings requested by members and 
sympathizers of the Socialist Party have not been allowed. Mr. 
Musaraj said in his reply that the above claims are groundless. 
The SP [Socialist Party] has not been denied the right of 
collective organizing for any legitimate objective. He 
explained that the Public Order Ministry has not banned 
gatherings of the SP in the set places. On the contrary, it has 
taken all measures for the security of these activities, with 
the exception of the cases when they have been considered as 
seriously dangerous for public order and security. After 
mentioning some cases of law violations during manifestations, 
the minister stressed that in the future the public order forces 
will not allow such violations be repeated. None of the 
citizens has been discriminated because of sex, race, language, 
religion, economic and financial state or for any other personal 
circumstances. Such violations have not been made and will not 
be allowed for any deputy. On the contrary deputies have not 
been prevented in accomplishing their task. 
  Mr. Musaraj invited the socialist deputies to help the 
forces 
of order to observe the rules of security according to the laws 
in force.

  [Text] Sofia, April 2 (BTA) -- In an interview for the 
Panorama political show this evening President Zhelyu Zhelev 
harshly criticized the government of economist Professor Lyuben 
Berov (not affiliated to any party) which was formed in December 
1992. He also stated that he was withdrawing his support from 
this cabinet. 
  "15 months after taking the lead this government has got 
nowhere with privatization and has failed to carry out the 
priorities of its programme for which it was appointed by 
parliament. No real investments have come to Bulgaria during 
this period and we are still at the bottom of the list as far as 
foreign investments in Eastern Europe are concerned," the 
president pointed out. He said that not a single project had 
been carried out or even launched, and cited projects for which 
even competitions had been opened: a Kalotina -- Kapitan 
Andreevo motorway (linking the western and the southern border), 
a tunnel under Stara Planina (which divides northern from 
southern Bulgaria), a new airport in Sofia, and a new bridge 
over the Danube (the only existing bridge links Rousse with 
Giurgiu). According to the president, the land reform has come 
to a standstill and in reality only 25-30 per cent of the land 
has been returned to its owners. "And, to top it all, here is 
the financial destabilization: fluctuations that have to do 
with the rise of the dollar and the prices, which undermine 
social stability," he added. 
  "Under these circumstances I cannot but reconsider my 
attitude to this government and withdraw my support from it," 
the president stated. It is not the president, it is parliament 
who decides what government will be ruling this country, he 
said. "But when the actions of the government start to threaten 
peace and stability, I cannot regard that with indifference," Dr 
Zhelev pointed out. His personal attitude to Professor Berov is 
unchanged: "He is an honest, upright, decent and ethical 
person". "The point is that this government is much to the 
liking of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) as it gets a 
chance to do what it has always wanted to: govern without 
shouldering the political responsibility for it," said the 
president. 
  He stated that he was not holding any talks on the formation 
of a new government, for that is beyond his prerogatives. He 
said that it was normal for the parliamentary and 
non-parliamentary forces to seek to meet with him.

  [Text] Sofia, April 1 (BTA) -- President Zhelyu Zhelev 
suggested that the political forces sign an agreement scheduling 
elections for November at a meeting today with representatives 
of the New Union for Democracy (NSD) and the Alliance for 
Democracy (SD). Both groups consist of MP's who split off from 
the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS). 
  It would be inappropriate to set a time limit for the 
elections, Khristo Ivanov MP [member of parliament] of NSD told 
the press after the meeting. According to him, parliament 
should first pass the minimum of laws essential to the reform. 
The representatives of NSD and SD told the president that his 
idea of a government supported by the SDS, the ethnic Turks' 
Movement for Rights and Freedoms and NSD would be almost 
impracticable. This depends above all on the SDS which is not 
ripe for this move yet, said Ivan Pushkarov MP of the SD. 
Besides, the SDS leadership has confirmed its decision not to 
take part in a new government elected by the present parliament. 
  The MP's of the NSD suggested that Lyuben Berov's government 
be given one more chance. The prime minister should spell out 
his plans for raising the cabinet's efficiency and for 
structural changes. The alternative would be to re-launch the 
procedure of giving each parliamentary force a mandate to form a 
government and when it is our turn, we will propose an all-NSD 
government, Khristo Ivanov said. According to NSD, the Union of 
Democratic Forces would refuse to enter a coalition government 
and the NSD would not like to form a coalition with the other 
parliamentary groups. 
  The participants in the meeting told the press to expect 
further talks with the president. 
  Speaking to BTA about reports in today's press that 
President 
Zhelev offered the premiership to SDS floor leader Stefan Savov, 
the President's Press Office said it would make no comment on 
misinformers' reports.

  [Text] Sofia, April 3 (BTA) -- Today the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party (BSP, the former communists) held a meeting 
behind closed doors to discuss its attitude to the cabinet of 
economist Professor Lyuben Berov (not affiliated to any party). 
It decided to give this cabinet which is no longer supported 
even by President Zhelyu Zhelev a month and a half to get the 
crisis under control. 
  A six-point resolution on the price and currency crisis was 
adopted. The party's leadership is to formulate clear 
requirements to be presented to the government, said BSP floor 
leader Nora Ananieva. "We give the government a month and a 
half to resume control," said ex-Prime Minister Andrey Lukanov. 
In his opinion, the government stands an approximate 10 per 
cent chance of success but it should be allowed to try. It is 
unrealistic to consider the formation of a new cabinet within 
this parliament, he said. 
  The BSP will demand from the government control over price 
formation, rapid completion of the activity of liquidation 
commissions in regard to the land reform, stabilization of the 
foreign exchange market, no politically motivated dismissals in 
the army before the passage of the armed forces bill on second 
reading, and information on the progress of negotiations with 
international financial institutions. Emergency measures have 
to be taken to save the municipalities, health care, education 
and welfare payments. The government must present a clear stand 
on the issues of social policy together with the central bank's 
report in May. 
  The party's leadership and the parliamentary BSP will 
develop 
a stand on structural, functional and personal changes in the 
cabinet, more particularly in its economic team. 
  If the government fails to stabilize the situation elections 
are the only alternative, the socialists maintain. The Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS) whose government was overthrown in 
November 1992 took a firm stand for early elections.

  [Excerpts] Sofia, April 2 (BTA) -- "Elections promise to be 
a way out of the problems of the present moment, but there are 
almost no guarantees that voters will realize that fact," 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] leader Zhan Videnov told 
reporters in Plovdiv (the second largest town in Bulgaria, about 
120 km south-east of Sofia). According to him, there is little 
chance of forming a cabinet on a BSP mandate in this parliament. 
  The National Council of the non-parliamentary Bulgarian 
Liberals Party adopted the principles of an election platform, 
listing its priorities as follows: "Bread, security, private 
property, preferences for Bulgarian business and a united 
Eastern Orthodox church". [passage omitted] 
  The second congress of the Union of Tobacco Producers was 
held in Plovdiv. According to its re-elected president, Mr 
Georgi Petrov, 1993 was the worst year Bulgarian tobacco 
producers have ever had. [passage omitted] 
  The plunge of the lev against foreign currencies turned the 
Deutsche mark into a main medium of payment in Kyustendil 
(western Bulgaria) in the past few days, BTA's local 
correspondent reported. Many of the customers are Serbs, 
Macedonians [from The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] or 
Albanians from Kosovo. 
  Three Bulgarian workers were caught in an attempt to steal 
gold from a jeweller's in Kocani (The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia) and are now serving a prison term in Skopje, 
reports a local newspaper in Radomir (western Bulgaria).

<F P=106> [Report by Ekaterina Kazasova] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, April 1 (BTA) -- Bulgarians today saw their 
pockets get still emptier as the prices of electricity, heating, 
coals and liquid fuels went up. The situation is further 
aggravated by the entry into effect of the new Value-Added Tax 
(VAT), which also starts operating as of today. 
  Reports on the market situation across the country create a 
picture of complete chaos. This situation was brought about by 
the traders' ignorance as to the VAT in spite of the large-scale 
promotion campaign, rather than by the tax itself. Most regions 
are witnessing a considerable price rise. In others, like the 
Turgovishte region (northeastern Bulgaria), prices are still 
unchanged but the shops are closed waiting for the new prices to 
be set. A report from Petrich (southwestern Bulgaria) says the 
shop shelves have been emptied in spite of the fact that the 
prices fetched dramatic heights compared to other regions and 
one would have difficulties in providing even goods of prime 
necessity. 
  Prices have not yet gone up in most Sofia shops. Demand 
today is tending down from its peak in the past days, when 
people were buying virtually everything. An opinion poll found 
that Sofianites are stocking up goods: 27 percent of the 
respondents said they were stocking foods, 5 percent household 
appliances, and another 15 percent other commodities. About 38 
percent did not stock anything only because of financial 
difficulties. 
  According to figures of the Consumers' Federation, 70 
percent 
of Bulgarians are living under the social minimum. The data 
also said that a month ago the monthly cost of living for an 
adult was 1,468 leva; for a child of 14 to 18, 1,492 leva; and 
for elderly people 1,219 leva. At the same time the average 
December pay was 3,900 leva, and the minimum pay, 1,565 leva. 
The entry into effect of the new VAT and the higher 
electricity, heating, coal and liquid fuel prices will directly 
hit consumers and push up the figures cited above, says 
Consumers' Federation expert Iveta Minkova. 
  According to analysts, the new prices of fuels and 
electricity and the high exchange rate of the dollar against the 
lev will be felt in the next few months. In practice, however, 
shopowners marked up prices a couple of weeks ago, not waiting 
for the official markup. Household appliances and audio-visual 
equipment were the first to go up, followed by a substantial 
price markup for staple foods. Dairy prices reported the 
steepest rise, with yellow cheese soaring nearly twofold and 
white cheese more than 50 percent. 
  The National Statistical Institute said the retail prices of 
goods monitored and controlled by the Government climbed up 5.37 
percent between March 15 and 31. 
  Chicken rose 16.40 percent, cow's cheese 15.24 percent, veal 
9.77 percent, and yoghourt 8.18 percent. 
  The government, parliament and President's Office have 4 
million children, elderly people and unemployed to take care of 
who cannot be left at the mercy of fate, says Velichka Rangelova 
of the National Statistical Institute. According to her, urgent 
steps have to be taken to fend off an inflationary spiral and 
hyperinflation. 
  IMF resident representative Gregory Dahl also warned of such 
a danger yesterday. According to him, the new energy source 
prices, VAT and high dollar rate are three factors that will 
have a one-time impact on the price level. In his view it is 
very important that government incomes policy does not 
immediately respond to the price rise, as it would render the 
fuel and electricity markup meaningless.

  [Text] Sofia, April 2 (BTA) -- The ten-day visit of Deputy 
Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev to Australia and Indonesia 
ended today. He was accompanied by representatives of 15 
Bulgarian companies. The delegation negotiated on cooperation 
in the extraction of mineral resources, in transport and trade. 
They had talks with high-ranking government officials and heads 
of leading companies, Mr. Karabashev told reporters. It is 
unnatural not to use trade diplomacy to achieve some results in 
coutries holding key positions is eastern Asia, he said. 
  The chairman of the Geology and Mineral Resources Committee, 
Mr. Antony Panayotov, discussed the introduction of new 
technologies in gold and copper ore mining. He familiarized 
Australian companies with the possibilities to participate in 
auctions of oil prospecting blocks in the Black Sea shelf. 
Australian businessmen were interested in possible cooperation 
in the sphere of transport and in leasing planes of the Balkan 
air carrier. 
  This year the largest quantities of imported raw sugar are 
likely to come from Australia, said Mr. Valentin Karabashev. 
  Draft agreements on the avoidance of double taxation and 
mutual protection of investments were presented to the 
Australian government three months ago. According to the deputy 
prime minister, they will be signed in the near future. An 
agreement on the avoidance of double taxation has already been 
signed with Indonesia, now another step will be made towards 
free trade between the two countries. Interest towards the 
Bulgarian delegation was unexpectedly lively. "We might 
possibly start importing rubber directly from Indonesia, without 
the mediation of Singaporean companies," Mr. Karabashev pointed 
out.

  [Text] Sofia, April 3 (BTA) -- Belgium's Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Willy Claes arrived on 
an official visit here this afternoon. I would like to 
strengthen our bilateral relations but I must take the 
opportunity to discuss Bulgaria's contacts with the European 
Union as well as the problem of stability and security in 
Central Europe, he said upon his arrival. 
  Diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and Belgium were 
established in 1879 and were suspended between 1941 and 1947. 
The latest visit of a Belgian foreign minister to Bulgaria took 
place 10 years ago. In a televised interview last night 
Bulgaria's ambassador to Belgium, Ms. Lea Cohen, described the

  [Text] Sofia, April 1 (BTA) -- Mr. Friedrich Koenig, 
rapporteur of the Political Committee of the Council of Europe's 
Parliamentary Assembly, and Mr. Dominique Columberg, rapporteur 
of the Legal Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly, have been 
on a visit to this country since March 30. 
  Mr. Koenig and Mr. Columberg are here in connection with the 
Parliamentary Assembly's decision to check on the compliance of 
newly-admitted member countries with membership requirements and 
to draft a resolution on the current political situation in this 
country. In parliament they met with Bulgaria's permanent 
delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly, as well as with 
representatives of the five parliamentary groups. Each of them 
set forth its views on the current political situation, the 
government's economic and financial policy, the human rights of 
minorities, parliament's law-making and the difficulties faced 
by this country during the transition period. 
  Today Mr. Koenig and Mr. Columberg met with National 
Assembly 
Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov. He stressed that the political 
forces are in agreement on the principles and priorities of 
Bulgaria's foreign policy. He pointed out that the reforms have 
slowed down, stressing that they must continue. 
  Acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev and Justice Minister 
Petur Kornazhev today met with Mr. Koenig and Mr. Columberg. 
The government press office said the guests had been 
familiarized in detail with the government's activity, as well 
as with the formidable difficulties it has to deal with. Asked 
about the so- called re-communization, Mr. Matinchev and Mr. 
Kornazhev spoke at length, presenting solid arguments. The 
guests showed a special interest in executive-judiciary 
relations.

  [Text] Sofia, April 2 (BTA) -- Mr. Friedrich Koenig, 
rapporteur of the Political Committee of the Council of Europe's 
[CE] Parliamentary Assembly, and Mr. Dominique Columberg, 
rapporteur of the Legal Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly, 
have established that state institutions in Bulgaria differ 
considerably on many important home policy issues. Their 
mission here was to draft a resolution on recommunization trends 
in Bulgaria. 
  At a news conference today they summarized the results of 
their meetings with MPs of the different parliamentary forces, 
Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, Justice Minister Petar 
Kornazhev, Prosecutor General Ivan Tatarchev, Supreme Court 
Chairman Ivan Grigorov and members of the Supreme Lawyers' 
Council. Yesterday's schedule of the CE representatives proved 
too tight to squeeze in a meeting with the members of the 
Supreme Judicial Council. 
  We are not in a position to pass judgement, but the 
differences between the executive and the judiciary will make it 
very difficult for us to make our report quickly, Mr. Columberg 
pointed out. He explained that several principled requirements 
should be reflected in the report: whether the prerogatives of 
the different state institutions are observed, whether they 
enjoy an absolute autonomy, and whether they are not subject to 
political influence. The reports should be presented to the 
Parliamentary Assembly by July. 
  The CE representatives said that there are constitutional 
grounds for the building of the judiciary in Bulgaria but a 
series of important acts are yet to be passed.

  [Text] Prague, April 3 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav 
Havel said today he had never favoured much a bicameral 
parliamentary system, but stressed that the Constitution had to 
be respected and therefore the Senate should be elected this 
year. 
  Speaking in his regular Sunday radio programme "Talks from 
Lany", Havel said that if the parliamentarians reached the 
agreement that the Cezch Republic should have a unicameral 
parliamentary system, this would require not only "the deletion 
of several articles from the Constitution, but the rewriting of 
the whole Constitution." The way of filling the second chamber 
of the parliament, Senate, is currently the object of a broad 
and often heated discussion in the government coalition. 
  The strongest coalition party, the Civic Democratic Party 
(ODS) of Premier Vaclav Klaus has insisted on the elections to 
be held in 81 one-mandate constituencies. In the first 
elections the constituencies would be divided into three groups: 
In the first senators would be elected for two years, in the 
second for four years and in the third for six years. Under the 
Constitution the senators are to be elected for six-year terms 
with one third of them being replaced every two years. 
  The three other coalition parties have proposed 27 
constituencies each of which would have three mandates in the 
first elections and one mandate in the following balloting. The 
elections would probably be held in the autumn along with local 
elections. Elections to the existing Chamber of Deputies are 
scheduled to be held in 1996. The deputies are elected for 
four-year terms. 
  Havel welcomed the compromise solution proposed by deputies 
at the end of March. Under it three senators would be elected 
in 27 "large constituencies." Each of them would comprise three 
smaller ones which would make a total of 81 as proposed by the 
ODS. Havel said this would not breach the Constitution.

  [Text] Prague, April 1 (CTK) -- Prime Minister Vaclav 
Klaus today said that Russia's payment of its debts to the Czech 
Republic in the form of goods supplies is basically acceptable. 
Talking to reporters after a special cabinet meeting, Klaus 
stressed, however, that it depended on the character of the 
goods. The Czech Republic is interested in particular in oil 
supplies, he added. 
  Klaus was referring to his visit to Moscow, scheduled for 
April 4-5, to which he had been invited by President Boris 
Yeltsin. Klaus said he would try to settle economic issues 
which could not be settled at lower levels. 
  He called very important an accord on the support and 
protection of investments, to be signed during the visit. The 
Czech Republic has similar accords with other countries but the 
agreement with Russia will be "less liberal," said Klaus. 
  Another point the cabinet discussed was a proposal to 
negotiate an agreement on trade cooperation between the Czech 
Republic and Brazil. The accord is to be signed during Klaus's 
visit to Latin America, scheduled for mid-April. The Czech 
Republic is to have a similar accord with Morocco.

  [Text] Prague, April 1 (CTK) -- Head of the Latvian Armed 
Forces Dainis Turlais was today received at the end of his visit 
by Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys, the Defense Ministry 
Press Department told CTK. 
  During his three-day visit, Turlais has been negotiating 
cooperation between the Czech Republic and Latvia in the weapons 
industry. He showed most interest in the Czech army's excess 
equipment, and his suggestion that this equipment be offered to 
the Latvian Army, along with help in training will be given 
further consideration by the Czech Republic. 
  Turlais was also interested in the Czech soldier's 
experiences from taking part in peacekeeping missions. Latvia 
is interested in taking part in such international military 
activities as part of a joint Baltic force. He passed on to 
Baudys an invitation from the Latvian defense minister to visit 
Latvia.

  [Text] Budapest, 1 April (MTI) -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross 
signed a Hungarian-Russian deal to settle former Soviet debts to 
Hungary on Friday [1 April]. An accord on eliminating double 
income and capital taxation was also signed by the two prime 
ministers. 
  Foreign Economic Minister Bela Kadar and his Russian 
counterpart Oleg Davidov signed the minutes on the second 
session of the Inter-Governmental Trade and Economic Cooperation 
Committee, as well as a protocol on mutual goods deliveries for 
this year. Industrial Minister Janos Latorcai and his Russian 
counterpart Vitaly Mikhailov signed a protocol supplementary to 
the 1966 agreement on establishing a nuclear power plant. 
Transport and Telecommunications Ministers Gyorgy Schamschula 
and Vladimir Bulgak signed a memorandum on cooperation in 
telecommunications and postal affairs. 
  President Arpad Goncz was present. Boross said Russia had 
agreed to take back used fuel cassettes from the Paks nuclear 
power station. (This needs no approval from Russian 
legislators.) 
  Chernomyrdin felt the new agreements marked major progress 
in 
Hungarian-Russian relations. 
  He welcomed the idea of as many as possible Hungarian 
entrepreneurs taking part in Russian privatization. He also 
praised the no-double-taxation agreement, expected to help 
two-way trade grow from last year's $3.5 billion to $7 billion 
this year. 
  Asked whether debt repayment included arms deliveries, 
Boross 
said negotiations were under way on the question but details 
still had to be clarified by military experts. 
  Chernomyrdin confirmed that Russia would like to repay part 
of its debts by supplying military technology, of which a list 
had already been presented to Hungary. "Russia could supply 
enough of these 'commodities' for Hungary to finally become a 
debtor," Chernomyrdin said. 
  The Russian prime minister recalled that the Hungarian Army 
used to buy mainly Soviet weapons, and expressed Russia's 
willingness to continue these deliveries. 
  Asked if arms spending was not just money down the drain, 
Boross said the Hungarian Army is only defensive. Hungary's 
single purpose for maintaining an army is to prevent war. The 
size and level of the Hungarian Army show that it only has a 
security function. 
  Chernomyrdin said Russia welcomed Hungary's full European 
Union [EU] membership bid. The Russian Federation also hopes to 
join and hopes that Hungary, as a full EU member, will back 
Russia.

  [Text] Budapest, April 2 (MTI) -- "The fact that Hungary 
was the first among the Visegrad countries (Poland, the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia and Hungary) to submit its membership request 
to the European Union does imply a particular advantage. We 
still have much to do prior to membership. This opportunity is 
mainly accompanied by obligations," Hungarian Foreign Minister 
Geza Jeszenszky said on Saturday [2 April], in Pacin, along the 
Hungarian-Slovak border. 
  The foreign minister held a press conference at the new 
building of the border station on the Hungarian side. 
  Jeszenszky visited the border town to view the planned 
border 
station, meeting an invitation from Richard Horcsik, the 
region's parliamentary MPs and chairman of parliament's European 
Affairs Committee, and the mayors of 21 villages along the 
Bodrog River. 
  The foreign minister exchanged views with the locals about 
the opening of border stations in Satoraljaujhely, Pacin and 
Lacacseke, and the off-shore area planned to be created in the 
Lacacseke-Perbenyik region. 
  In Pacin, Mayor Attila Barati guided Jeszenszky through the 
completed and furnished border station and customs building. 
The facility will also ensure smooth work for Slovak border 
guard and customs authorities. 
  The mayor said people on both sides of the Bodrog are 
awaiting the opening of the Pacin-Velky Kamenec border station. 
Jeszenszky said it was regrettable that a struggle is needed to 
open a border station on the Slovak border, where families and 
relatives live in different countries. The demand of people 
living on both sides of the border for the immediate opening of 
the station is understandable, he said. The new Central Europe 
should be without borders, with local authorities cooperating in 
issues as this. 
  "We have opened many border stations towards the 
neighbouring 
countries, and in the case of Slovakia it is unfortunate that we 
were unable to meet the expectations. I very much hope that the 
fine words of the new, genuinely good intentioned Slovak 
Government will be followed by actions. We have replied to 
words with action, as we have built the border station," 
Jeszenszky said.

  [Text] Budapest, April 2 (MTI) -- The Social Democratic 
Party of Hungary (MSZDP) will win seats in Hungarian Parliament 
in the course of the elections in May, party chairman Zoltan 
Kiraly said at the MSZDP's press conference on Saturday [2 
April]. 
  The party's National Board discussed the results achieved so 
far in the election campaign. It approved the national list, 
which so far has 15 candidates. The list is headed by party 
chairman Zoltan Kiraly, followed by academician Laszlo Kapolyi, 
third is MSZDP Secretary General Istvan Podkoniczky. 
  It was reported that the MSZDP was able to put up 
territorial 
lists in 11 counties by Saturday, and 46 of the 170 candidates 
have already collected more than the necessary 750 
recommendation slips. 
  In answer to a question, Kiraly said that even if the party 
does not attain the 5 per cent limit needed to enter parliament, 
he is confident that an MSZDP group can be created with 10 
individual MPs. 
  Kiraly said a social-liberal coalition of the Hungarian 
Socialist Party (MSZP) and the Alliance of Free Democrats 
(SZDSZ) has chances for victory at the elections.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 31 -- President Lech Walesa has 
received President of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) Hanna 
Gronkiewicz-Waltz and NBP Vice-President Witold Kozinski to seek 
their opinion on the budget bill, the president's press office 
said. 
  Gronkiewicz-Waltz pointed out that the approval of the 
budget 
would open up an opportunity to negotiate another agreement with 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF). She said that the 
implementation of the previous agreement brought about the 
cancellation of 8 billion dollars owed to the Paris Club and 
contributed to a preliminary agreement on cancelling part of 
Poland's debt to the London Club. 
  She stressed that the signing of the agreement increased 
Poland's credibility in the international arena, reduced the 
level of Polish risk, created chances for the greater inflow of 
investment funds to Poland and made it possible to get another 
loan from the European Union (EU). 
  The president voiced its concern over lack of implementation 
of promises made during the election campaign by the present 
political alignment. Walesa said this was the problem making 
the president to be very cautious when making difficult decision 
concerning the budget.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 1 -- Commenting on President Walesa's 
yesterday's decision to veto the Sejm act on wage control, the 
leader of the largest Sejm faction Aleksander Kwasniewski said 
on Friday that the decision was risky. "I hope the president 
was aware of the consequences of his move when he made it," said 
Kwasniewski. 
  Another leader of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), Sejm 
Speaker Jozef Oleksy played down yesterday's comments from his 
party colleague Marek Borowski who termed Walesa's veto a 
declaration of war on the ruling coalition. 
  Oleksy said he believed the presidential decision had a 
broader meaning than just opposing the law on wage controls. 
What it means we will have to find out, Oleksy said.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 1 -- The government economic committee 
and the government socio-political committee Friday supported a 
legislative draft which, if adopted by the government and passed 
by parliament, will significantly change labour law and labour 
relations in Poland. 
  The draft is the most extensive and weighty amendment ever 
introduced to the labour code enacted in 1974. The new 
proposals have been tailored to the realities of a market 
economy and designed to make the labour law compatible with 
international standards. 
  The general idea behind the draft amendments is to restrict 
state intervention into labour relations and give greater 
freedom of negotiating labour terms and conditions to the 
parties concerned, that is trade unions and employers as well as 
individual employees. 
  The provisions of the draft define only minimal obligations 
and duties of both parties to a labour contract, leaving the 
rest to direct negotiations. 
  According to Labour Minister Leszek Miller, the amendments 
enhance the position of employees in some respects. For 
instance, the draft guarantees the right to severance pay to 
retiring workers and sets a minimum extra pay for night work. 
Both proposals are a novelty in the Polish labour legislation. 
  The amendments also make labour law more flexible than it 
has 
been to date, particularly with regard to work schedules and 
hours. 
  The draft tries to secure a better symmetry of the rights 
and 
obligations of employers and employees. 
  Under the draft provisions, the shortest paid vacation leave 
would be 18 days instead of the present 14 days. One other 
change consists in extending the status of employers to 
individuals who are not legal persons. This would be of 
particular importance to family businesses. 
  During their Friday session both government committees 
examined the most important criticisms addressed to the draft 
amendments by trade union federations.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 1/4/1994 -- Romania's President 
Ion Iliescu returned Thursday evening [31 March] to Bucharest 
after a two-day formal visit to Greece at the invitation of the 
Greek president. On his arrival in Bucharest President Iliescu 
stated among other things: 
  "We had a very busy schedule with interviews with President 
Konstandinos Karamanlis, with Premier Andreas Papandreou, with 
several members of the government and of parliamentary parties, 
as well as with representatives of business and banking circles. 
The common note of these interviews was their warm atmosphere. 
On one side we assessed the good level of the ties between our 
countries and a considerable similarity of opinions as regards 
issues of our direct concern, as well as international 
developments in our area and in Europe at large. We have also 
noticed the firm political will on both sides to support the 
expansion, diversification, and development of ties in all 
fields, especially the economic ones, and we also considered the 
current volume of commercial exchanges as modest compared to the 
potential of our economies. From this point of view my opinion 
is that there is a real interest and a climate of confidence 
among business and economic circles of both countries to expand 
these relations. However, these issues will be debated on the 
forthcoming session of the joint commission due next week in 
Athens. Worth mentioning would be also a new and positive 
element in our relations in the banking system." 
  "As for the issues confronting our area and Europe in 
general, we also noticed a similarity of opinions in their 
approach. Referring to Yugoslavia, both sides were of the 
opinion that progress could be made only by supporting efforts 
for a political approach of the potential solutions to be found, 
and that steps made until present in this direction are 
sufficiently promising." 
  Romania's president was accompanied during his visit to 
Greece by Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, by Traian Chebeleu, 
presidential aide, and by other officials.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 1/4/1994 -- Local elections 
should precede legislative ones, irrespective if the latter are 
normal or early, Oliviu Gherman, chairman of the ruling party, 
the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], told a ROMPRES 
correspondent after the Thursday, March 31, meeting of the PDSR 
Standing Delegation. 
  Gherman said that the PDSR had a very clear point of view on 
snap elections. "Although we are not afraid of early elections, 
we deem they are counterproductive, it may even be dangerous to 
favor them," mentioned the politician. 
  The PDSR chairman expanded by saying that huge sums of money 
would be necessary for the organization of early elections this 
year, which is decisive for the reform and characterized by 
financial shrinking. Gherman opined that the political spectrum 
had not changed considerably since 1992 and mentioned that a new 
electoral law should be drafted. The 1992 polls were held in 
keeping with a law written uniquely for them, added Gherman. 
  According to the PDSR chairman, favoring early elections is 
tantamount to political frivolity.

of a potential nuclear catastrophe and the dosimetric radiations 
lab, one of the key points in the institute. 
  The guest were also informed on the achievements of the 
center for the production of radio isotopes which are essential 
for collateral fields of physics. The Swedish guest was also 
presented the nuclear reactor built back in 1957, which almost 
doubled its capacity by successive modernization works, and the 
tandem linear accelerator regarded by the guest as a unique 
equipment in East Europe, which is producing heavy ions used in 
nuclear and atomic physics researches.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 3 (CTK) -- Marian Andel, Slovak 
National Party (SNS) parliamentary deputy, has told CTK he knows 
nothing when asked whether the SNS leadership sent SNS Deputy 
Chairman Juraj Molnar to the World Slavonic Congress held in 
Moscow today. 
  "I personally know nothing. Neither me, nor (SNS Honorary 
Chairman Jozef) Prokes, nobody," Andel said. 
  The World Slavonic Congress was initiated by the leader of 
Russia's extreme nationalist Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, as continuation of his party's congress 
held yesterday. 
  Andel, deputy premier under the former government of 
Vladimir 
Meciar, said that he knew from official sources that a sole 
person from Slovakia attending Zhirinovskiy's party congress was 
Jozef Lauko. But he is there as a private person, Andel added. 
  Andel said there was no need to be hunting for any 
sensations, even though "a sensation may be produced, but 
certainly not of this kind," he added without elaborating. 
  Molnar, along with other foreign guests, was today sitting 
in 
the presidium of the World Slavonic Congress at which 
Zhirinovskiy proposed the creation of an "Eastern European 
Community of Slavonic Nations" spreading "from the Adriatic Sea 
to the Kurile Islands."

  [Text] Tirana, April 3 (ATA) -- "Serbian police and army 
have been openly collaborating with the paramilitary groups for 
intensifying the violence and terror against the Albanian 
population in Kosova", Adem Demaci, holder of the "Saharov" 
Prize, and chairman of the Pristina Council for Human Rights 
Protection, appealed through a letter to the homologue 
international associations located in Geneva and to the 
embassies in Belgrade. 
  Mr. Demaci writes that the Serbian and Montenegrins think 
that in this way they can gain the favour of being the stronger 
side in any negotiations mediated by the international factor. 
  "During the period of February-March 19, 1994, 2,500 
Albanians have been cruelly mistreated in their homes, in front 
of their families and in public places, 47 Albanians have been 
sentenced with one to 10 years imprisonments by staged judicial 
processes, 41 Albanian families have been expelled from their 
homes and 2 innocent Albanians have been killed by the Serbian 
police and army", Mr. Demaci points out. 
  The council give evidence of the tortures exercised on 
13,400 
Albanians, the rise of the number of Albanians forcibly 
recruited in the Serbian Montenegrin Army as well the open 
threat to the Albanians emigrants not to return to Kosova. 
  Mr. Demaci also protests in the name of the council against 
the Serbian attack on the Albanian culture, such as the violent 
closing of the Academy of Arts and Sciences and Arts in Kosova 
and occupation of the Albanology Institute in Pristina.

  [Text] Tirana, April 1 (ATA) -- Some 25 Serbian families 
have recently been settled in Podujeve, Kosova, and 33 family 
members from a total of 78 have been immediately employed, 
JEDINSTVO, a Serbian newspaper published in Prishtina reports. 
  According to JEDINSTVO, the number of the Serbians mainly 
from Prokupla and Kurshumlija, who have been settled in Podujeve 
and employed in the jobs of the dismissed Albanians amounts to 
400 people. 
  According to the Serbian press, the number of the Serbian 
settlers is over 10,000 and 27,000 others are already get a job 
in Kosova [as received]. The Serbians have been provided 900 
houses, 467 of which have been forcibly taken from the Albanians. 
  But as RILINDJA writes, the above figures do not count for 
the construction sites granted to the Serbs or the concentration 
of the Serbian settlers in tourist centres, in the student's 
campus, the miners' centres and in the premises of different 
enterprises and factories which have been closed down for lack 
of raw material.

  [Text] Tirana, April 1 (ATA) -- Almost one third of 
Albanian young aged population in Kosova have gone abroad, 
writes the RILINDJA newspaper. Referring to the Albanian 
diaspora census of 1993, some 120,000 Albanians are in Germany, 
95,000 in Switzerland, 35,000 in Sweden, 35,000 in Austria, 
8,000 in Belgium, 5,000 in France, and the same number in 
Denmark, 4,000 in Italy, 3,500 in Norway, 2,500 in England, 
2,000 in Netherlands, 40,000 in Croatia, and 15,000 in Slovenia. 
  According to the newspaper, some 25,000 Kosovars are living 
in Albania. There are not exact data about the number of the 
Kosovars living in Turkey, Macedonia, the Czech and the Slovak 
Republics. 
  The reasons for this Albanian emigration are the Serb 
repression, the forceful called up of the Albanians in 
Serbian-Montenegrin Army, the economic poverty, and the 
insecurity of the life in Kosova.

<F P=106> [Dan Damian report: "KGB Agents Are Crossing Romania From </F>
One End to the Other"] 
  [Text] After 1990, in addition to Romanian entrepreneurs, 
a large number of foreigners, especially from neighboring 
countries, came to set up commercial companies. A number of 
various companies were set up either with entirely private 
capital or in association with the Romanian state. 
  The majority of these are to be found in Bucharest, 
Moldavia, 
and Dobrogea. It is interesting that between 1991 and 1993 
various "hotel" businesses were set up, which are closed to the 
public, offering their services exclusively to certain 
categories of foreign citizens. Just such a hotel is to be 
found in the city of Galati. If one, as a Romanian citizen, asks 
for a room there, one will be politely refused with the words 
"We are sorry, but our hotel is closed to the general public." 
  Moreover, certain analyses show that beginning with the last 
10 days in 1993 and over the first months of 1994 the number of 
foreign "tourists" coming from neighboring countries trebled, 
and more than half of them have remained in Romania for 
"business." Similarly, December 1993 represents a record for the 
spas in the Prahova Valley regarding the influx of foreign 
"tourists" coming from neighboring countries to ski on the 
slopes of Clabucet-Plecare and Cota 2,000. 
  From among the personalities involved in such businesses we 
can mention Eduard Hiznichenko, the owner of the Cominet Ltd. 
company at 57 Rozelor Street, in the town of Odorheiul Secuiesc, 
Anatoliy Ivanov, general director of the Biisik Ltd. Trading 
Co., and the Technotours Ltd. company, registered under the 
number J 40/6788/1991 in the Commercial Register, represented by 
Elisabeta Ana Stefanescu. 
  Is "KGB the most active intelligence service working on 
Romania's territory?" [quote from a 29 March news conference of 
Romanian Intelligence Service Director Virgil Magureanu].

<F P=106> [Report by Dan Andronic and Radu Tudor: "KGB Is Behind the </F>
Petromin-Forum Affair"] 
  [Text] EVENIMENTUL ZILEI has entered into possession of a 
number of sensational photographs proving that both Adrian 
Nastase, current executive chairman of the PDSR [Social 
Democracy Party of Romania and Traian Chebeleu, counselor of 
President Ion Iliescu, felt honored to be able to hold talks 
with a person whom now they reject, namely the Greek shipping 
tycoon Ioannis Alafouzos. [Article is accompanied by two 
photographs, one showing, among other persons, Nastase and 
Alafouzos, with the caption: "Adrian Nastase held talks lasting 
an hour and a half with the Greek shipping tycoon Ioannis 
Alafouzos. In those days they used to be friends;" the other 
photograph shows Alafouzos shaking hands with Chebeleu, with the 
caption: "Traian Chebeleu, all honey, amiably shaking hands 
with Ioannis Alafouzos, whom, after a short while, he would be 
denigrating!"] 
  The photographs were taken in 1990, at the official opening 
of the Ermis company in Bucharest, when Adrian Nastase and 
Traian Chebeleu chatted with Greek shipping tycoon Ioannis 
Alafouzos. The difference between 1990 and 1994 is that in 1990 
Iannis Alafouzos was one of the supporters of the Mitsotakis 
government, which was very close to President Ion Iliescu's 
heart. The moment the Greek shipping tycoon switched sides and 
began to support Andreas Papandreou, the most bitter adversary 
of Konstandinos Mitsotakis, both Adrian Nastase and Traian 
Chebeleu changed their tune. 
  According to last-minute data in the possession of 
EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, one of the intelligence services -- 
definitely not the SRI [Romanian Intelligence Service] -- has 
elaborated a report that established that the KGB is massively 
involved in the famed case of the attempted sale of the Romanian 
strategic fleet, also known as the Petromin-Forum Maritime 
affair. 
  As we already mentioned, the photographs date back to 1990. 
About that year, in issue No. 533 of our daily, soccer player 
Danut Lupu stated that he had to return to Greece because of the 
pressure that had been exerted on him by the [Romanian] Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, led at the time by Adrian Nastase. He 
explained having been pressured by the fact that "shipping 
tycoon Vardinoianis, owner of the Greek Panathinaikos soccer 
club, had large business operations in Romania." 
  The aforementioned intelligence service report proves the 
incontestible links between the Greek shipping tycoon 
Vardinoianis and the Moscow intelligence services, especially 
the KGB, on the orders of which he initiated a massive operation 
intended to purchase the 96 vessels belonging to Petromin. 
Those 96 vessels represented an essential component of our 
national security system. 
  The sum of $125 million with which the Greek shipping tycoon 
Stelianos Katounis was to buy the Petromin fleet comes, 
according to the cited report, from KGB funds, via shipping 
tycoon Vardinoianis. 
  We would like to remind our readers that the following 
persons were ardent supporters of striking a deal with the 
Greeks in the famous attempted sale of the Romanian strategic 
fleet: Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu; Paul Teodoru, 
former minister of transportation, currently counselor of the 
prime minister; Lieutenant General Marin Pancea, former 
presidential counselor and former secretary of the Country's 
Supreme Defense Council. According to information revealed by 
other dailies, the whole affair was closely supervised by 
presidential counselor Colonel General Vasile Ionel.

  [Text] Slowly but surely, the erosion of the current 
power's popularity is reaching to the very top at Cotroceni, 
despite the fact that President Ion Iliescu has made fewer 
public appearances of late -- as if the presidential institution 
in our country is like the one in the democratic countries, 
namely totally impartial vis-a-vis the political scene. The 
decrease in Ion Iliescu's popularity is an exceptional sign for 
our nation, which has been considered as dulled by 50 years of 
communism. 
  If Ion Iliescu wavers, then the power situation is truly 
serious, because the current president has more than close links 
with the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI] and the justice 
structure and is trying to achieve the same thing with the Army, 
and also because the executive branch is nothing but Cotroceni's 
direct extension. Ion Iliescu is also supported by another 
extremely important force: the great magnates of the market 
economy, who come from the ranks of the former nomenklatura and 
Securitate. 
  There are troubled waters in the Iliescu bloc. It is not so 
much the people's attitude that weakens Iliescu as the trend 
toward a split within the Social Democracy Party of Romania 
[PDSR]. It is obvious that quite a few people in the ruling 
party have realized by now in which direction the wind is 
blowing and that we are on the threshold of a process of the 
society's normalization. 
  These people, who are labeled the "reforming wing," are not 
interested in going into the opposition but rather in distancing 
themselves from a conservative power which, sooner or later, 
will give in. The crisis within the PDSR has been accentuated 
by the pitiable Vacaroiu government -- a straw cabinet run from 
Cotroceni. As a matter of fact, we are facing here a double 
crisis of disgrace and conceit. 
  The antidote to this crisis, namely the emergence (creation) 
of a new leader, [PDSR Executive President] Adrian Nastase, is 
very interesting. 
  Nastase began his mission by trying to attenuate the dissent 
within the party. However, his chances of success are very 
small, because it is difficult, if not impossible, to harmonize 
conservatism with reformism. Hence the dissonance occasionally 
struck by Nastase. In the morning he makes reformist statements 
on the radio, while in the evening he makes conservative 
statements on the television. However, all this has little 
impact on the population, which is politically untrained. 
  The second step by Nastase was to trigger off the electoral 
campaign for early elections. The intelligent PDSR executive 
president realized that these elections can no longer be 
avoided. Adrian Nastase is well aware of the significance of 
power at the local level, as far as elections are concerned. 
The ruling party needs the local administration. The 
opposition's mayors are beginning to receive their dismissal. 
The idea of early local elections is being spread around and 
gaining ground. Even if the power does not manage to lay hold 
of the mayoral positions, it will manage to intimidate the 
electorate by implying that the power is very strong and that if 
the opposition wants early legislative elections, then the power 
can also impose early local elections. 
  All this movement to create a new leader is fascinating. Of 
course, Ion Iliescu will often make public appearances alongside 
Adrian Nastase, thus drawing the attention of the electorate to 
the fact that he is endorsing Adrian Nastase. At the same time, 
Mr. Nastase displays an appealing seriousness, compared to Ion 
Iliescu's shallow smile. The moment will come when he will also 
distance himself from certain insignificant concepts of the 
president. 
  "The old" Iliescu will then pass onto Adrian Nastase the 
"secret keys" of the relations with the SRI and with the force 
of the former nomenklatura, turned great capitalists overnight. 
Anyhow, the current government must be preserved until the 
elections. 
  Why did such a move as the creation of a new leader become 
necessary? It is true that Ion Iliescu's image is sinking, but 
the elections are legislative, not presidential. Here lies the 
PDSR's subtlety -- the party won the previous elections thanks 
to its leader. It is trying the same thing again, only this 
time the leader will not be the outworn Ion Iliescu but Adrian 
Nastase. Therefore, the PDSR is trying to win over a new 
electorate; if the party splits, then those who leave will not 
be able to take with them part of the electorate. 
  We wonder whether Nastase will also distance himself from 
Ion 
Iliescu, if he is successful. After all, Mr. Adrian Nastase is 
an intelligent politician. Will he observe the guarantees he 
gave? Or do they have something on him to keep him on a leash? 
  As for us, we must vote. The waters are troubled and they 
hide all kinds of fish. Some of them are sharks, with wide open 
mouths....

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant Colonel George Toroiman, head of </F>
the Directorate for Weapons, Explosives, and Toxic Substances, 
by Luiza Cristina; place and date not given: "Public Order Can 
Be Ensured by Existing Laws"] 
  [Text] It could be that the name of the Directorate of 
Weapons, Explosives and Toxic Substances might say too little 
or, to the other extreme, might say too much to us. The exposing 
and punishing of persons who illegally possess, manufacture, or 
bring weapons into the country, the confiscation of the weapons, 
and the issuance of permits to carry guns are activities under 
the jurisdiction of this directorate. In 1993 some 1,813 weapons 
of different types and calibers were confiscated, along with 
72,062 bullets. The border police confiscated 209 weapons and 
8,833 bullets. Last year, according to the records of the 
directorate, 50,000 persons possessed weapons legally. Some 
13,561 of these people lost the right to carry weapons, either 
because of changes in their behavior (after they received the 
permit) or because of their failure to use or keep the weapons 
properly which resulted in accidents. 
  [Cristina] First, I would like you to describe the activity 
of the Directorate for Weapons, Explosives, and Toxic Substances. 
  [Toroiman] Our directorate is concerned with ensuring that 
laws on weapons and ammunition are respected and with meting out 
punishment for violations. Regulations on weapons and ammunition 
are stipulated in Decree No. 368/1971. Therefore, we are first 
involved in ensuring that regulations on weapons and ammunition 
are observed. 
  [Cristina] What is involved in this first objective of the 
activity of the directorate? 
  [Toroiman] We must say, first of all, that a person can 
possess a weapon on the basis of a permit issued by our 
directorate. Hunting weapons can be possessed only by members of 
the General Association of Amateur Hunters and Fishermen. Two 
attempts were made to establish some phantom associations which 
claimed: "We are independent." They did not even have the name 
of an athletic association in their title. I do not know and I 
cannot imagine what they were thinking about. Do they think that 
they are professional hunters and that this is the Siberian 
taiga? 
  [Cristina] What are the other categories of weapons and who 
can possess them? 
  [Toroiman] Rifles are another category of weapons. They are 
possessed by marksmen who, in addition to these weapons, can 
also possess other types of weapons, either those which are 
received for various sports competitions or those which are 
purchased for personal use. The possession of these weapons is 
legal and the possessors present proof that they are marksmen or 
have permits to possess weapons for competitions. There are also 
panoply weapons which are part of weapons collections. Persons 
who have such collections have to satisfy the legal requirements 
for possessing such weapons. One thing should be said at the 
very beginning: Weapons are very dangerous and a person who 
wants to possess one must exhibit irreproachable behavior. You 
cannot give a weapon to a person who has spent several years in 
prison for robbery. That is the way it must be! Or to a perosn 
who causes a scandal in the apartment building, beats his wife, 
or who knows what. 
  Another category of weapons is that of weapons used for 
personal defense and security. They can be possessed by persons 
who exercise state authority or some other important public 
activity. A person who wants to possess a weapon might be a 
senator, but if it is determined that he is in no danger of 
being attacked, then there is no reason why he should carry a 
weapon. The last category of weapons consists of those possessed 
by juridical persons, such as theaters, movie theaters, the 
State Circus, as well as weapons for guarding economic units 
(enterprises, private companies). In this area, the economic 
units send a request to the police and then the guard plan for 
the unit is discussed. The police specialist in the guard 
systems makes a decision in regard to the guard posts which 
require the weapons. Then the persons serving as guards who will 
be carrying the service weapons will be notified. The weapons 
will be rented from the police for 28,000 lei a year -- a rather 
small sum. 
  [Cristina] Where does the ammunition for these weapons come 
from? 
  [Toroiman] Also from us. At cost, of course. Returning to 
the 
objectives of our directorate, we can also include the 
authorization of a person to bear arms and the periodic 
examination of the person's behavior. If any negative aspects 
should appear, then the authorization can be withdrawn 
automatically. Let me stress the fact that the identification of 
persons illegally possessing weapons and ammunition occupies 
first place in our activity. The vast majority of those who 
possess weapons illegally are involved in poaching. Others have 
murder in mind. 
  [Cristina] Are there any other categories of weapons? 
  [Toroiman] Those remaining from the interwar period. They 
are 
found by the people under different circumstances. 
  We are concerned with preventing and combatting the illegal 
importation of weapons into the country, by Romanians or 
foreigners. The customs organs are a great help to us in 
exposing people who bring weapons into the country illegally. 
They are the first and also the last ones to carry out 
inspections. 
  [Cristina] The disadvantage of this inspection is that it is 
carried out at random. 
  [Toroiman] This is true, and violators profit from this fact 
when they pass through crowded border control points where the 
probability that they will be apprehended is much smaller. 
  [Cristina] So the exposure of the violators depends upon the 
mettle of the border guard? 
  [Toroiman] On the mettle of the border guard and the 
utilization of different techniques at the border points. Strict 
inspections are carried out at the Otopeni and Kogalniceanu 
airports. Each piece of baggage goes through an X-ray apparatus 
which provides a clear image of the contents. 
  [Cristina] How many weapons does the Directorate of Weapons, 
Explosives, and Toxic Substances have? 
  [Toroiman] Each officer has a pistol. Just like each 
military 
man in the country. 
  [Cristina] During the 1989 events, weapons were taken from 
the headquarters of the police. How many were taken? 
  [Toroiman] The total number of weapons taken is 1,897, if we 
take into account the weapons taken in June 1990, when the 
police headquarters of the capital was attacked. 
  [Cristina] How many weapons have remained in the possession 
of the population? 
  [Toroiman] Some 356. If they do not hand them over, out of 
fear that they will be interrogated or whatever else is on their 
minds, we would be happy to find them thrown over the fence into 
the yard of the police department. We do not care any more about 
the persons who had the weapons. We just want them to hand them 
over so we can recover them. 
  [Cristina] Are there any weapons trafficking networks 
operating on the territory of Romania? 
  [Toroiman] No. So far we have not run into this. 
  [Cristina] Does the current legislation help the directorate 
in its activity of stopping violations of the law? 
  [Toroiman] In my personal opinion, the penalties are not 
severe enough to prevent illegal manifestations. Authority in 
the field of law and order can be ensured by severe legal 
requirements. 
  [Cristina] How many people work in the Directorate of 
Weapons, Explosives, and Toxic Substances? 
  [Toroiman] Each county police department has a weapons 
office. We are not few in number, nor are we an army. 
  [Cristina] What do you want the most in the future? 
  [Toroiman] More severe penalties and a stricter system for 
authorizing the possession of weapons. If we think about it, as 
long as the state has organs which ensure law and order, why 
would the people need to possess firearms? The people can defend 
themselves by alarm systems. Weapons in the possession of the 
people create a state of fantastic danger. I assure you that 
youth, especially, would get firearms if they could. At any 
rate, we are not in the situation of having guns in our homes. 
It would be good for citizens to closely collaborate with the 
police -- in the best meaning of the word. They should help us 
to do our work. And I would also like the law which we proposed 
and introduced in Parliament to be passed as quickly as possible.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikaela Vuzharova: "Dialogue With the Union of </F>
Democratic Forces Is Necessary, Especially Under the Present 
Circumstances"] 
  [Text] A noncommunist government capable of implementing 
at least part of the reform by the end of 1994 could be formed 
under the current parliament. All this is possible. However, 
the goodwill and energy of a strong cabinet are required in such 
case. The country is suffering because it feels the lack of 
change. This is what President Zhelyu Zhelev stated in an 
interview for the daily NOVO SLOVO [NEW WORD]. A dialogue with 
the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] is necessary, especially 
under the present circumstances, he said. I am ready for such 
talks if the SDS should manifest an interest in holding them, 
the head of state declared a year and a half after his breach 
with the political forces, thanks to whose voters he obtained 
his present post, a breach that he was personally responsible 
for. At the same time, Dr. Zhelev continues to insist that he 
did not contribute to the fall of the SDS government in 1992. 
  A cabinet formed by noncommunist forces -- something that 
could not take place without the participation of the SDS -- a 
cabinet that will not rule forever, but that could do much in 
view of the forthcoming elections, so that they may give a 
greater chance to the democratic forces -- this is how President 
Zhelev explains his idea, which was repeatedly launched by MP 
Georgi Markov [from the SDS]. The head of state is categorical 
in stating that a cabinet that is based neither on the Berov 
cabinet formula nor the former Dimitur Popov government could be 
elected under the present parliament. 
  Zhelev's evaluation of the team that is ruling Bulgaria 
today 
is that it is supported by the Socialist Party. This fact ties 
the hands of the cabinet in many respects, according to the 
president. The program of the Berov government offered many 
opportunities, but they were not implemented at all, Zhelev 
thinks. He further declared that all parliamentary political 
forces, even those of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] 
under whose mandate the cabinet was formed, had great 
reservations about it, and hence, the possibility exists that 
the government would be soon overthrown. 
  Zhelyu Zhelev insisted on his previous statement that 
elections should be held in the autumn of 1994. 
  According to recent analyses made by the presidential team, 
the situation in the country is especially alarming, most of all 
due to the complete breakdown in people's trust in the state 
institutions. DEMOKRATSIYA was told this by a source at 2 
Dondukov Street [address of the Presidency]. According to the 
team's findings, the parliament is already in the ridiculous 
situation of falling below the critical 10-percent confidence 
barrier. According to a sounding of opinions among the 
political forces, it appears that the DPS intends to revise its 
behavior in parliament and support a possible new cabinet, which 
should prepare the forthcoming elections on a democratic basis. 
Numerous deputies of the new formations at the National 
Assembly, with the exception of a few individuals mostly from 
the Alternative Liberal-Social Party [ASP], reportedly share the 
same views. According to NOVO SLOVO, they are all awaiting the 
trend of the SDS's behavior after Prime Minister Berov's 
operation, namely in the new stage of the political and economic 
crisis. This factor, in particular, is supposed to be decisive 
for Prime Minister Berov's own dilemma, in connection with 
deciding whether he should remain in his post or resign after 
leaving hospital.

<F P=106> [Andrey Lukanov commentary: "Does the Constitution Apply to </F>
the President?"] 
  [Text] Loyal to his bad habits, the president of the 
Republic again chose a foreign audience in order to tell tales, 
about which he would again probably have to make clarifications 
to the Bulgarian public. Indeed, the things are clear even 
without any clarifications, because the basic theses that the 
president recently expressed in London continue to specifically 
express the same thoughts of his he has been trying to impose on 
our public in the last few months. According to Zhelyu Zhelev 
it is not the prime minister, Lyuben Berov, who is sick, but 
rather the Bulgarian Government and the formula on which it is 
based. Therefore, according to him, it is necessary to change 
the formula, find a new parliamentary configuration, or go to 
new elections by the end of the year. He even warned the 
sovereign Bulgarian voter not to reach out for the red ballot, 
because if the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] wins the 
elections it would not know what to do with this victory and 
could not succeed to form a government. 
  If those words would have been uttered by another Bulgarian 
citizen, public figure, or deputy, they would have hardly 
impressed anyone. Under conditions of political pluralism 
everyone has the right to an opinion, and the rest can agree or 
disagree with this opinion. This applies to everyone but the 
president. Assuming the grave constitutional burden of 
personifying the unity of the nation, he also assumes the 
commitment to the people to limit his public statements to the 
framework of those strictly defined functions and obligations 
which the constitution prescribes. He does not have the right 
to jabber everything that comes to his mind, because every word 
he publicly utters has a political effect which also is the 
subject of constitutional assessment. 
  What is disturbing in Zhelyu Zhelev's London revelations? 
First of all the fact that the president allows himself to 
determine the date of eventual early elections and engage in 
reshaping the parliamentary configuration, despite the fact that 
all this is not a part of his constitutional prerogatives. In 
this case Zhelev crudely and unceremoniously interfered with the 
prerogatives of the parliament and the parliamentary forces, 
which are the only ones empowered by the people to assess the 
cabinet, approve its composition and policy, and determine its 
fate. In this case I do not mean to defend the government and 
its policy, but defend the fundamental and constitutional 
principles of a parliamentary and not a presidential republic. 
In this republic the president only has the right of setting 
new elections if the parliament fails to form a cabinet, rather 
than the right of expressing an opinion whether there should be 
new elections and when should they take place, while the 
hypothetical situation described in detail in the constitution, 
which allows him to do this, does not exist. 
  It also is scandalous that the president finds it possible 
to 
call his country's cabinet a sick cabinet, and declare the 
country's legislative and executive powers provisional powers at 
a moment when difficult and delicate negotiations are being 
conducted with foreign governments, international institutions, 
and commercial banks, and decisions of fateful importance for 
the national economy and the future of the reforms in Bulgaria 
must be adopted. This is not only a violation of the 
constitution, but also an act that contradicts Bulgaria's 
interests. This reminds one very much of 1990, when the 
political configuration led by Zhelyu Zhelev was prepared to 
destroy the civic peace in the country in order to prevent the 
successful completion of the negotiations which the government 
at that time conducted with the international financial 
institutions and the Western partners. Now Zhelyu Zhelev 
decided to speak in London -- one of the world's basic financial 
centers, and thus ensure maximum response to his suggestions. 
  For some time already Zhelyu Zhelev usurps the right of 
evaluating one of the legitimate political and parliamentary 
forces in Bulgaria, supported by no less than one-third of the 
country's mature citizens. This testifies not only to the lack 
of political and civic culture, but also to an insurmountable 
prejudice, which obviously contradicts Zhelev's claim to be the 
president of all Bulgarians. Instead of reading lectures abroad 
on the topic of tolerance, the president should grasp his 
constitutional duties and understand that he could implement his 
functions of an honest arbiter and guarantor of national unity 
only if he equally respects all public forces and conducts a 
tolerant and equal dialogue with them, while at the same time he 
does not forget even for a moment the limits of his rights and 
prerogatives. Otherwise he could turn, and indeed he already 
has turned into a factor of public destabilization and national 
division. If he heads along this way he alone would relinquish 
the responsible role that the constitution assigns to him. 
  I would like to stress again that those infringements of the 
Constitution are not an accidental matter. They outline a 
consistent and insistent line of the president, which becomes 
ever more a threat to the constitutional order in Bulgaria. I 
will remind the readers of Zhelev's claim that the specific 
character of the transitional period in the postsocialist states 
justifies the establishment of a presidential rule. Thus those 
states would have faced the serious threat of restoring 
authoritarianism. Let me also remind the readers of his 
anticonstitutional interference in the progress of the agrarian 
reform, whose essence it was to restrict "from the top" the 
rights of the owners of the agrarian land and maximally extend 
the life of the liquidation councils, despite their lethal 
effect on the national economy and the normal supply of the 
people with acceptably priced foodstuffs. We would hardly 
forget soon the other anticonstitutional act of the president -- 
his attempt to create parallel structures to lead the Armed 
Forces outside the legitimate structures envisaged by the basic 
law, and as a counterbalance to those legitimate structures. 
Without claiming that we mentioned everything, we could not 
ignore his comment on the upcoming extraordinary elections, 
which he made for the national mass media after visiting 
Professor Berov in the hospital. In addition to its 
anticonstitutional character, this comment also impressed with 
its lack of political tact and elementary human ethic. 
  Those are grave words and harsh conclusions, but the 
president must hear them, also because his post involves special 
moral, political, and constitutional responsibilities, and 
because in the final analysis, we are discussing here the 
fundamental rules and principles of democracy and the democratic 
public culture. There was a moment during the president's term 
of office when the hope emerged that Zhelyu Zhelev would 
overcome his political bias and would really assert himself as 
the president of the entire nation, as a uniting figure capable 
of contributing to overcoming confrontation and asserting 
civilized social habits. Unfortunately, the last public 
statements of the president are far from those expectations. 
  His thesis regarding him being a "president of the 
transition 
period" is also insolvent. Obviously, this thesis justifies in 
his own eyes and the eyes of his advisers his recent and 
repeated liberties with the constitution. There is not and 
cannot be a "president of the transition period." We have a 
legally elected president of the Republic of Bulgaria, whose 
functions and rights are clearly spelled out in Chapter 4 of the 
Bulgarian Constitution. If Zhelyu Zhelev does not want to comply 
with the text of the Constitution by which he was sworn in, the 
National Assembly would have no other choice except invoking 
Article 103 of the Bulgarian Constitution, which envisages the 
procedure of terminating the presidential mandate ahead of time.

  [Text] Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of 
Kosova, held a news conference in Prishtina today. Here is a 
telephone report by our correspondent, Leke Musolli: 
  [Musolli] At the beginning of today's news conference, the 
president of the republic of Kosova, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, 
welcomed the visit of Albanian President Dr. Sali Berisha to 
Great Britain and considered it as very important, as it focused 
on the situation in the region and particularly on the grave 
situation in Kosova. Our political project on Kosova, which is 
supported by all the Albanian political parties, is clear and 
derives from the 1991 plebiscite on Kosova as independent and 
neutral state. 
  Rugova said that despite attempts to prevent the 
internationalization of the Kosova question, even this week 
Kosova was at the center of attention of the international 
community and forums. On this occasion, he greeted the report 
of Amnesty International, which objectively describes the 
torture and recent imprisonments in Kosova and will help the 
world to understand the repressive and police situation in 
Kosova. 
  Rugova also greeted the report of the Helsinki Committee of 
the U.S. Congress on human rights and the bill presented by U.S. 
Congressmen Angle and Molinari, which seeks a solution for 
Kosova, precisely to stop the repression in Kosova. 
  Rugova also welcomed all the rallies of Albanians all over 
Europe, which helped to sensitize people to the Albanian 
question. 
  At today's news conference, Rugova informed reporters about 
the police repression that the Serbian authorities has recently 
been causing in Kosova. 
  Asked whether there are any indications of an Albanian-Serb 
dialogue, Rugova stressed that for the moment there are no such 
initiatives, but added that the Albanian side is ready for 
unconditional dialogue, internationally supervised. 
  Another reporter asked Rugova how he would comment on the 
threats by a parliamentary group from the Russian Duma, members 
of Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party, who visited Kosova a 
few days ago. Rugova said that he considered such threats as a 
manifestation of Russian extremism but expressed his conviction 
that it did not present any serious problem. On the contrary, 
such forces are distressing for Yeltsin's power itself. 
  At today's news conference, the president of Kosova welcomed 
the agreement on the cease-fire between the representatives of

made between the problem of Knin and the Kosova question, the

  [Text] Marian Andel, deputy of the Slovak National Party 
[SNS], has told a news agency that he was not aware that the 
leadership of the SNS had sent Juraj Molnar, deputy chairman of 
the party, to the World Slavic Congress, which was set up in 
Moscow at the Congress of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. 
  Juraj Molnar, together with other foreign guests, sat in the 
presidium of the aforementioned World Slavic Congress where 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Liberal Democrats, 
suggested setting up an East European community of Slavic 
peoples reaching from the Adriatic to the Kuriles. 
  Pavol Hagyari, chairman of the Democratic Party, said that 
the participation of SNS Deputy Chairman Juraj Molnar in 
Zhirinovskiy's party congress harms Slovakia's already bad 
reputation. He noted that this step is a clear indication of 
the political thinking of the highest representatives of the 
purified SNS and its closest partner, the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. 
  Ivan Duris, chairman of the Republican Party, said that, 
even 
if the participation of Molnar in the Moscow Congress of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia is an internal SNS affair, 
such contact with a nationalistically oriented party is 
unsuitable. He said that it appears that the Russian Liberal 
Democrats will cooperate with the SNS in the future. However, 
this is not a positive signal for foreign countries.

  [Text] The Slovak National Party [SNS] did not send its 
deputy chairman, Juraj Molnar, to the fifth Congress of the 
Liberal Democratic Party in Moscow. This was stated by SNS 
Chairman Jan Slota in an interview with TASR today. He said 
that Molnar had left as an observer for the world congress of 
Slav Orthodox and Christian nations with the consent of the SNS 
executive but without authorization to deliver any kind of 
message. 
  According to Jan Slota, the invitation to the congress of 
Slavs did not mention the Fifth Congress of the Russian Liberal 
Democrats. 
  The SNS chairman stressed that the SNS has not made any 
contacts with Zhirinovskiy's party nor has it the intention to 
do so in the future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner by Juraj </F>
Handzo; place and date not given: "Peaceful Elections, Safe 
Streets"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Handzo] Organized crime has 
become a reality and is a very serious problem in Slovakia. How 
do you view the bill on investigation and punishment for 
engaging in various forms of organized crime, which was recently 
drafted by the prosecutor general? 
  [Pittner] I welcome the initiative of the prosecutor 
general. The fight against organized crime requires the 
utilization of adequate tools. The new bill would allow the 
police to use methods that have not been used in our country for 
several decades. I mean the protection of witnesses, for 
example, to avoid the danger of the Mafia exacting revenge. It 
seems to be necessary to establish a group of undercover agents 
to penetrate criminal organizations. This would not only secure 
their activity in the fight against organized crime but also 
protect them. Apart from these measures, which could be 
implemented after the law against organized law is passed, we 
would like to initiate additional changes in the legal system, 
which would help improve the quality of police activity. 
  [Handzo] What do you specifically have in mind? 
  [Pittner] We are facing the task of redrafting the Criminal 
Code and Law so as to make the police less burdened by 
bureaucracy and not obliged to document "trivial" cases as much 
as serious crimes. We must redraft the law because the Criminal 
Code and Law, which has undergone so many amendments, has become 
so muddled that it is very difficult for the police and other 
bodies to understand. 
  [Handzo] Economic crimes have become a serious problem, 
growing at an unprecedented pace.... 
  [Pittner] At the first regular meeting of the government, I 
provided information on economic crime. It has become obvious 
that, as a consequence of abusing the so-called old block on the 
clearing account between the Czech and the Slovak Republics, 
Slovakia incurred losses of more than 1 billion korunas [Sk]. 
Large transfers of finances to foreign countries through branch 
companies have gone on to a large extent and have caused damage 
to the Slovak Republic amounting to Sk1 billion. This is why we 
want to pay particular attention to economic crime. I expect 
that the passage of the law on the fight against organized crime 
will open more possibilities to us in that direction. 
  [Handzo] Many activities in Slovakia that have the character 
of organized crime are directly connected with the activity of 
foreign nationals, particularly from the countries of the former 
USSR and former Yugoslavia. Are you considering tightening up 
the conditions regulating the stay of foreigners on our 
territory or introducing measures that would make illegal 
immigration more difficult? 
  [Pittner] We have been watching the activity of foreign 
mafias on our territory for many years. They always penetrate 
here in waves. First, they usually establish a basis here that 
works legally, while creating room for the arrival of other 
people. They come here legally or illegally and are directly 
engaged in organized criminal activities. As a rule, they try 
to recruit our people, so that, if they are exposed, Slovak 
citizens are prosecuted and not the real organizers. 
  There is a widespread opinion among the public that 
introducing visa requirements would be the most efficient 
measure to counter the activity of foreign nationals. I 
believe, however, that such a measure is not needed at the 
moment. People who are committing said criminal acts would 
certainly find a way to circumvent the visa requirement. We are 
expecting a greater effect from the bill on the fight against 
organized crime, other laws, and the existing legal regulations, 
which allow us to adopt certain measures in cooperation with 
intelligence bodies.

<F P=106> [Article by Jindrich Sidlo: "A Fresh Wind Across Europe: The </F>
Czech Government Rejects the Collective Rights of Minorities"] 
  [Text] "In the Czech Republic, basic human rights are 
observed consistently. Therefore, there is no problem with 
ethnic minorities here," states Minister Igor Nemec (ODS [Civic 
Democratic Party]), chairman of the government council for 
national and ethnic groups. The "Recapitulation of the 
Government's Attitude Toward the Issues of Ethnic Minorities," 
which was debated by the Cabinet last Wednesday, is clearly 
based on this conviction. The issue is a basic document for the 
given area. The Czech Republic does not have a special law on 
ethnic minorities, and the relationship with them is not even 
mentioned in the government's declaration of its agenda. Thus, 
the adopted doctrine "summarizes and clarifies the government's 
attitude toward these problems" (Nemec). The material was 
prepared by the Council for National and Ethnic Groups, where 
all minorities are represented. Nevertheless, it cannot be said 
that the text fulfills their hopes 100 percent: At the very 
least, representatives of the Polish, German, and partly also 
Slovak minorities had expected more. Nemec's document defines a 
minority as "an association of persons who permanently live in 
the CR [Czech Republic], are citizens of that country, yet share 
ethnic, cultural, and language characteristics that differ from 
the majority of the inhabitants and wish to be considered a 
minority." In its doctrine, the government guarantees the 
members of a minority the right to develop their culture, be 
educated in their mother tongue, unite in their own associations 
and political parties, use their mother tongue in official 
relations, and participate in resolving issues concerning 
minorities. The Cabinet considers all of these rights to be 
strictly individual rights. Consequently, it does not intend to 
permit, among other things, different rules to apply to 
minorities in elections. Only representatives of those 
minorities whose parties get more than the five-percent minimum 
may sit in parliament. Considering the number of possible 
voters, however, none of the present "minority parties" can do 
this. Therefore, some of their leaders and speakers are striving 
to bring about a change in attitude. 
  The first to propose a different election device for 
minorities was Dana Branna, the representative of the Czech 
Poles. This occurred at the end of last year during the meeting 
of the Council for National and Ethnic Groups, and the idea was 
instantly supported by the former member of the CNR [Czech 
National Council], Walter Piwerka, from the Assembly of Germans 
in the CR. "Parliament deals with a large number of laws that 
could affect minorities, and yet the delegates may have 
insufficient information and could easily overlook some dangers" 
is Dr. Branna's explanation for her action. "Our representatives 
could watch out for such dangers and point them out." According 
to Piwerka, the representatives of minorities who hold 
parliamentary seats could "influence all kinds of issues and 
also prevent all kinds of disinformation in the present 
transition period, when a civic society is being formed in our 
country, but the Czech nation and the minorities are still 
burdened by nationalism." Nada Vokusova, who represents the 
Slovak Community in the Council, also agrees with Dr. Branna's 
proposal. According to Jozef Horal, of the rival Slovak 
Democratic Alliance, it is "absolute nonsense." This would 
totally deny the principles of a civic society. "The Slovaks in 
the Czech lands are voluntarily living in the diaspora and not 
in a ghetto," says J. Horal. He is convinced that, during the 
next elections, almost every party will place Slovaks on their 
list of candidates: According to unofficial data, the Slovak 
minority in Bohemia and Moravia now numbers 600,000 people, 
which constitutes a sizable electoral potential. According to 
Czech experts, the disagreement with a "ration" for 
parliamentary seats is more than the simple attempt to keep a 
few unfathomable voices out of parliament. "Collective rights, 
which include such demands as the demand for a seat in 
parliament on the basis of adherence to a specific national or 
ethnic group, is often linked to demands for autonomy in the 
areas of education, administration, and territory," says Hana 
Fristenska, of the Secretariat of the Council. "Furthermore, the 
right to a seat signals that minorities need special protection. 
Therefore, if one takes a civic approach, representatives of all 
definable groups--for example, invalids or homosexuals--should 
theoretically have a seat in parliament. On the whole, one could 
say that collective rights are political in character, while 
individual rights are a matter of the legal protection of the 
individual." However, the chairman of the movement 
Coexistencia-Souziti [Coexistence], Stanislaw Gawlik, states 
that the government's attitude toward minorities does not 
conform with international conventions, which the CR has joined. 
"According to the European charter on the rights of minority 
groups, minorities cannot be defined as an aggregate of 
individuals. On the contrary, collective rights are mentioned. 
The charter clearly states that minorities should participate in 
power at all levels in elected agencies," says Gawlik. The 
answer to whether the Czech legal code adequately protects 
against discrimination against all minorities was to be provided 
by a special analysis, which the council intended to commission 
in the fall of last year. Subsequently, however, the task proved 
to be too demanding and expensive, and the idea was dropped. 
Minister Nemec admits that, when preparing the materials, the 
government was not inspired by any foreign model, but, in 
contrast to Gawlik, he considers this to be an advantage: "We 
have the opportunity of letting a fresh wind blow across Europe."

  [Text] What is the reaction of the cabinet members to the 
opinion President Zhelyu Zhelev expressed regarding the current 
government? Bilyana Mikhaylova, who at present is at the 
Council of Ministers, answers this question. 
  [Mikhaylova] Perhaps I should remind the listeners that the 
president accused the cabinet of delaying the privatization, 
failing to encourage foreign investments in Bulgaria, and 
blocking the agrarian reform. We were interested in the opinion 
of various cabinet members and the prime minister himself 
regarding the president's opinion. 
  Industry Minister Rumen Bikov said that after the commentary 
of the prime minister the issue has been exhausted, and he would 
not allow himself a commentary as to what the president is doing. 
  However, Acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev was more 
talkative. He said that when the president makes such a 
statement this naturally should make the cabinet members uneasy, 
but according to him, the president's assessment is more 
emotional than based on real grounds in every single aspect 
mentioned by the president. 
  Matinchev also pointed out that no cabinet member 
contemplates resignation. He had a talk with Prime Minister 
Berov, and neither the prime minister nor he or any other member 
of the cabinet intend to resign. 
  Matinchev did not deny the fact that he feels himself 
responsible for the situation in which we find ourselves and the 
measures that the government must adopt in order to calm the 
situation as soon as possible. He added that he does not think 
that the hysteria which developed recently would positively 
affect the important accord and agreements that will be signed 
soon. 
  He did not deny that personnel changes were possible, but he 
said that it is too soon to talk about this. First of all, 
structural changes should take place, and this means assessing 
the present situation and deciding how to improve the efficiency 
of the government. 
  It appears that we will not learn anything specific until 
the 
precise and concrete opinion of the prime minister is issued.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 4 (TANJUG) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic's visit to Romania on Tuesday and his meeting 
with Romanian President Ion Iliescu is a step forward in the 
search for a solution to the problems of the region, Romanian 
Education Minister Liviu Maior said in Belgrade on Monday. 
  Maior, who is the vice president of the National Council of 
the ruling Social-Democratic Party of Romania (PSDR), met in 
Belgrade on Monday with a delegation of the Socialist Party of 
Serbia (SPS) headed by Goran Percevic -- the vice president of 
the biggest party both in the republican and the federal [word 
indistinct]. 
  The major achievement of the talks was an agreement to 
convene a Balkan meeting of moderate leftist parties to be held 
under the slogan "Balkans to the Balkan peoples", Percevic said. 
  He said that there was agreement about the direct link 
between peace and stability in these territories and the "fact 
that only the Balkan peoples and states should shape their own 
destinies." 
  The SPS Information Service announced that Maior said that 
Bucharest is in principle opposed to the U.N. sanctions against 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which Romania, as a member of 
the United Nations, has been forced to implement. 
  The U.N. Security Council in late May 1992 imposed strict 
sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia due to its 
alleged involvement in the civil war between the local Serbs, 
Croats and Moslems in the neighbouring ex-Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Maior underscored that the sanctions have caused much damage 
to Romania and recalled a recent statement by that country's 
leadership that the U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia should be 
lifted out of ethical and humanitarian reasons, and because of 
the damage they are causing to the entire Balkan region. 
  Romania said that in 1993, it has suffered damage amounting 
to seven billion dollars, while in the case of the other 
countries in the region this figure exceeds tens of billions of 
dollars. 
  Percevic warned that a part of the international community 
verbally urges a peace, while at the same time shutting its eyes 
before the fierce Moslem offensive in the territory of the 
Bosnian Serb Republic (RS) and thus threatening to annul 
everything achieved so far in the peace process. 
  The Moslems launched an offensive on RS in mid-March 
encouraged by the Washington agreement on setting up a 
Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia.

  [Text] The Czech Defense Ministry has decided to form its 
own fast deployment unit. Our correspondent Milan Repka reports: 
  Defense Minister Antonin Baudys has said that a fast 
deployment brigade will deal with, above all, the solution of 
sudden crisis situations at any place in the Czech Republic, 
including situations where the state is under threat. 
  According to Baudys, this unit should have about 3,000 men 
and should represent some kind of model of the future Czech 
Army. The equipment of this brigade should be compatible with 
the equipment of NATO countries, both in the case of hand 
weapons and helicopters. 
  As Baudys went on to say, he and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus 
agreed on putting domestic arms production first, while taking 
its quality strictly into account. 
  Another step of the ministry within the framework of 
transformation of the Czech Army is the necessary reduction of a 
large number of commander posts. In this connection, Baudys 
designated the basic principle of this transformation--above 
all, orientation toward recruiting new officers to achieve the 
aim of the Army service having to become attractive for high 
quality people.

  [Text] Unfortunately I have to send you bad news from 
Gorazde. After 10,000 shells of all calibers, after superhuman 
fighting and unprecedented heroism of the defenders, the defense 
line has been breached in the southern part of the battlefield 
on the right bank of the Drina. The situation is exceptionally 
dramatic, while fresh columns of refugees are moving into the 
town center from villages on the right bank. 
  The villages of Ahmovici, Uhotici, Kodzaga Polje, and some 
other villages from this area have been emptied of their 
inhabitants. Many civilians have been killed. Those who have 
succeeded in getting out in the face of strong aggressor forces, 
are trying to cross to the left bank and have somehow get into 
the town. In the town, however, the situation is extremely 
dramatic. 
  At about 1900, artillery shelling intensified. Howitzer 
shells are being used to systematically target houses one by one 
in Vitkovici, (Vaci), and (Vinarici). Many people have been 
killed. It is not possible to get information from the military 
hospital because everyone is involved there in giving help to 
the injured. 
  Infantry attacks also intensified at 2000 on the southern 
approaches to the town. No one knows what things will look like 
and what will happen in the night ahead. If anyone wants to 
help Gorazde they should do so immediately. For many people 
here tomorrow will be too late.

  Since this morning over a thousand shells have landed on 
(Batici) alone. The attacks are intensifying from several 
directions, and the aggressor is again trying to break through 
with tanks from Ustipraca and (Nezici). The chetniks are firing 
howitzers, multiple rocket launchers, and mortars of all 
calibers from (Kotovo), Djakovici, Kozara, (Paljika), 
(Preljuca), Carevo Guvno, from every hill they control. On the 
right bank of the Drina their infantry attacks intensified 
before dawn. At 1025 a major tank and infantry attack was 
launched north from (Kopaci). The battles are [word indistinct] 
and the strength of the artillery support from the chetnik 
forces is unprecedented here. 
  The situation is by far the worst on the free Rogatica 
territory. Hundreds of tonnes of steel have landed here over the 
last 10 hours. Despite their losses, the chetniks are 
intensifying their attacks by introducing fresh forces. All 50 
tanks are in full use, as are armored transporters, combat 
helicopters, and some 10,000 murderers of all kinds from the 
four chetnik corps. Their intention is obvious: They want the 
Herzegovina Corps, the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps, the Drina Corps, 
and the Uzice Corps to link up in Gorazde. They are not much 
concerned that Gorazde has been made a UN Protected Area with 
Resolution 824. True, during this morning's flights by two NATO 
planes over the area, the intensity of their attacks did let up, 
only to be resumed with even greater ferocity after the aircraft 
had gone. 
  This is Fahrudin Becic reporting from the Information 
Service 
of the Eastern Bosnian Operative Group.

  [Text] [Announcer] Poland has no chance to join NATO in the 
near future. This is an opinion expressed by Longin Pastusiak, 
deputy chairman of the Sejm Foreign Affairs Commission, who 
returned from Washington a few days ago. According to the 
professor, the Partnership for Peace program can be treated as 
the last stop before NATO. 
  [Begin Pastusiak recording] The program does not provide 
guarantees of security for us. Consequently, Article 5, the key 
article of the North Atlantic Treaty, which declares that 
aggression against a NATO member state means aggression against 
the entire NATO organization, will not apply to Poland. 
However, the states that will be included in the Partnership 
for Peace program will be covered by Article 4, which envisages 
that, in a situation of conflict or when Poland's security is 
threatened, the NATO countries would hold a meeting and carry 
out consultations. Such consultations might lead to military 
action, but it is not said clearly. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Kiro Gligorov, president of The Former </F>
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, by an unidentified DER SPIEGEL 
correspondent; place and date not given: "An Attack Would Mean 
War"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Serbia has been waging war against 
Bosnia for two years. Is Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia -- FYROM] also threatened with military aggression? 
  [Gligorov] I am not plagued by excessive fear, but I cannot 
rule out the possibility of this conflict spreading to the south. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You called for UN protection as far back as in 
November 1992; since last July U.S. blue helmets have been 
patrolling the border with Serbia. Does this guarantee peace? 
  [Gligorov] These units came when the danger of war was 
acute. The presence of the Americans should be sufficient 
warning to the Serbs. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Serbian army could occupy Macedonia within 
a few days; in the war against Bosnia NATO reacted only after 
almost two years. Are you deceiving yourself by believing that 
you would be able to defend your young republic in case of an 
attack by Belgrade? 
  [Gligorov] The Macedonian problem is far more complex than 
the Bosnian one. In Bosnia the war is a war in an enclave, 
which is hardly in danger of spreading. An attack on Macedonia 
would be a war on NATO's northern [as published] border, in 
which all the Balkan states would be involved. In addition, 
there could be a conflict between the two NATO states, Greece 
and Turkey. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Last spring Serbia's President Milosevic 
arrived unexpectedly for a brief visit to Lake Ohrid. What did 
he want from you? 
  [Gligorov] He presented a proposal for intensive 
cooperation; however, when I asked him why he did not recognize 
our republic, his answer was: This will be done only when 
Greece has diplomatically recognized Macedonia. Because for him 
Athens is his only true ally in the Balkans.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] ...with whom Milosevic would like to divide 
Macedonia. 
  [Gligorov] Athens' former Prime Minister Konstandinos 
Mitsotakis says that Milosevic did indeed suggest this to him. 
But he refused. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The plans are probably not yet off the table. 
Three weeks ago Greek Foreign Minister Papoulias visited 
Belgrade to discuss the renaissance of the former Yugoslavia. 
  [Gligorov] We will not join a new Yugoslav Federation 
voluntarily at any price. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does the quarrel between Skopje and Athens 
really just revolve around the name of Macedonia, which the 
Greeks claim for themselves? 
  [Gligorov] Nonsense. If this were so, the issue would have 
come up 50 years ago. This is how long we have used this name 
without anybody being bothered by it. Nationalism is reigning 
in Greece now. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How long can you resist the threat from the 
north and the embargo from the south? 
  [Gligorov] We are waiting. Our economic situation is 
difficult; there are no alternative trading routes. However, in 
the long run, the routes to and via Greece will be open again to 
us. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you fear tensions with the Albanian 
minority, who, after all, constitute a third of Macedonia's 
population? 
  [Gligorov] Even in our worst times we did not have any 
problems with our Albanian fellow-citizens. The only thing we 
do not permit is the demand by certain circles to declare them 
Macedonia's second state-constituting people. We give the 
Albanian minority all the rights that are set down in the 
Helsinki Final Act. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Will this prevent radical Albanians from 
striving for unification with the Albanian motherland in the 
long run? 
  [Gligorov] It is no secret that there is the idea of a 
greater Albania. However, all these dreams of greater Serbia, 
greater Croatia, greater Albania -- what is their point?

  The Cabinet of the President of the Republic of Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] informed

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Police Patrol Seized"] </F>
  [Text] On 30 March 1994, around 1100, in the vicinity of 
the spot called Mecka near Kumanovo, three members of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's army abducted a three-member 
police patrol at the police station in Zeglane, reports the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs. The police patrol was on its 
regular duty when in the vicinity of Mecka they were surrounded 
by three members of the FRY army. The latter pointed their guns 
at the policemen and told them to leave the vehicle and to 
surrender. Their weapons were then taken and the patrol, 
together with their vehicle, were brought to the Prohor Pcinski 
border army station on Yugoslav territory. Somewhere around 2230 
on the same day, the patrol were set free and, together with the 
complete equipment, their arms and the vehicle, were delivered 
to the Macedonian border authorities. The incident took place 
on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 350-400 meters off the 
border line. The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Macedonia 
delivered a protest note to the Foreign Ministry of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, expressing deep concern considering the 
fact that such incidents do not contribute to the establishment 
of regular friendly relations between the two neighboring 
countries.

<F P=106> [By Michel Viatteau] </F>
  [Text] Benkovac, Croatia, April 4 (AFP) -- Serb forces 
Monday [4 April] withdrew large numbers of artillery and tanks 
from the front line in their self-proclaimed republic of 
Krajina, as a ceasefire with Croatian forces came into effect. 
  A column of T54 tanks, 130mm guns, light mortars and 
military 
trucks loaded with ammunition pulled away from the front line in 
clouds of black exhaust smoke on the road between Benkovac and 
Knin, in southern Croatia. 
  Smiling young Serb soldiers sat astride their hardware next 
to the red, white and blue flags of Krajina, waving the victory 
sign. Crowds of local people came out to greet them in the town 
of Kistanje and its neighbouring villages, hailed in return by a 
loud chorus of honking horns. 
  The withdrawal was supervised by the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) at several control points, in accordance with the 
Russian-brokered peace accord signed last Wednesday. 
  According to the agreement, which took effect Monday 
morning, 
Croatian army forces and secessionist Serbs have until 0700 GMT 
on Tuesday to withdraw all their heavy weapons from an agreed 
demarcation line. 
  Mortar and anti-aircraft guns must be withdrawn 10 
kilometres 
(six miles) and artillery and tanks by 20 kilometres (12 miles) 
although some are to be redeployed at specified locations. 
  At one UN control point on the edges of Benkovac, by 1100 
GMT 
Canadian troops had counted 10 T55 tanks, eight T34s, eight 
105mm guns, nine 152mm guns and other weapons. 
  The checkpoint was visited by the commander of the 92nd Serb 
Brigade of Benkovac, Lieutenant-Colonel Uzelac, and the 
commander of the Canadian UNPROFOR unit stationed here, Major 
Andre Lefebvre, who confirmed that the withdrawal was going as 
planned. 
  They were both mindful of the Croatian offensive of January 
22 last year, which broke the first UN-backed ceasefire between 
the two sides. 
  After repeated demands by Uzelac for confirmation of the 
Croatian withdrawal, the Canadian commander contacted his 
counterpart on the other side by radio and reported, "They're at 
exactly the same point as here." 
  People living in the mountain town of Knin, the capital of 
the self-proclaimed Krajina republic, said they hoped the 
ceasefire would bring them peace and better supplies. "Perhaps 
we'll have chocolate at last for the children," said one young 
woman in the main street. 
  The leaders of Knin, which wants to join with Serbia proper, 
refuse to see the military agreement as a political concession 
to Croat sovereignty as Zagreb seems to think, a senior interior 
ministry official who wished to remain anonymous told AFP. 
  In Zagreb, UNPROFOR said the troop withdrawal included in 
the 
military accord would begin Monday afternoon. 
  Troops from both sides -- at some points only a few metres 
(yards) apart -- are to withdraw one kilometre (just over half a 
mile) from the confrontation line, forming a two-kilometer 
buffer zone to be controlled by UN forces. 
  The buffer zone line was drawn on a series of 35 maps during 
painstaking negotiations at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. The 
overall operation is to be completed by 0700 GMT Friday. 
  The UN Protection Force deputy commander General John 
MacInnis said last Thursday that the first task, "difficult if 
not impossible," would be "transforming what was written on the 
map to precise locations on the ground, the establishment of 
(...) joint (Serb-Croatian) commissions which will have the task 
of confirming precisely where those lines of separation are to 
be." 
  The commissions will also determine the number of Serb and 
Croatian police who are to be deployed in limited numbers 
between the two separation lines, said MacInnis, who hinted that 
the stated deadline might not be met. 
  To enable UNPROFOR troops to move into the buffer zone, the 
Croatian and Serb separatist adversaries are to provide maps 
setting out the location of mine fields between the separation 
lines. 
  They are to clear the mines themselves, under UNPROFOR 
supervision, removing several thousand mines that have been 
placed in the zone since the conflict erupted in June 1991.

<F P=106> [Report from Zagreb by Nada al-Isa] </F>
  [Text] The Croat-Serb agreement is still causing disquiet. 
The Croatian opposition is still not clear about the conditions 
under which it was signed or what has happened to the maps -- 
there were 35 on the table. There have been no offical 
statements on this from the Croatian side. They are keeping 
things concealed as best they can. 
  However the Zagreb press has published a map reprinted from 
the Vienna-based paper DER STANDARD and the borders on the map 
are shown in such a way as to give any Croat a headache. For 
example, the so-called republic of Serb Krajina has outlets to 
the sea at Biograd and Zadar, but what tops it all, the papers 
say, is that even Osijek is in the so-called Krajina. Is the 
leadership really concealing such a thing from ordinary people? 
  President Tudjman also has different political problems 
every 
day. The replaced Josip Manolic has announced that he is off to 
Washington as early as today where he is to have talks with U.S. 
congressmen responsible for military issues. The meeting has 
allegedly been fixed up by Dobroslav Paraga. So Manolic is not 
travelling to Washington with Tudjman's blessing. Who is he 
representing? What is behind the visit? Those in the know say 
that Dr Tudjman himself would like to know the answer to this 
question.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 4 (TANJUG) -- Croatia will sell out 
cheaply at least 20,000 apartments, summer homes and other 
facilities worth over three billion U.S. dollars, whose owners 
are nationals of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the 
president of the Association for the Equitable Treatment and 
Protection of the Property of Yugoslav Citizens, Mirko Lalovic, 
said on Monday. 
  That such a sale will take place is also evident from the 
fact that the Croatian Fund for Privatization announced in March 
the placing on sale of 18 holiday complexes, which are the 
property of firms from Serbia and Montenegro (federal units of 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), the president of the 
Belgrade Association told TANJUG. 
  Croatia has usurped the facilities, following its forcible 
secession from the former Yugoslav Federation in 1991 under the 
pretext that they were public property and has entered them into 
the land register as state property. 
  In order to usurp the private property of FRY nationals, 
Croatia introduced an exorbitant tax on the private property of 
non-Croatian nationals, 15 German marks per square meter 
annually. 
  The same tax for Croatian nationals is 3.75 marks, proving 
that it was a well thought out plan to coerce property owners 
from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to give away or sell 
them to Croatians at bargain price. 
  Since payment operations between Croatia and the Federal 
Repubic of Yugoslavia is non-existant, citizens from Serbia and 
Montenegro, Republics making up the Yugoslav Federation, are not 
able to pay their taxes. 
  The Croatian legislator has thus provided, when 
indedebtedness exceeds a third of the value of the taxed 
property, for selling it. The beneficiary will be the state. 
This will happen soon due to the accumulated interest (two 
percent daily), so that summer homes, houses, apartments and 
other facilities, property of FRY nationals have already been 
put on sale, Lalovic said. 
  Such an usurpation of assets contributes to the creation of 
an ethnically clean Croatia, because Serbs and Montenegrans will 
lose their properties in that republic, thus denying them the 
right to return once relations are normalized, he added. 
  Stressing that the Croation attitude towards real estate 
owners from Serbia and Montenegro is unprecedented in 
international law, Lalovic added that they acquired the property 
at the time when Croatia was part of the former Yugoslavia, 
which means under the same conditions as Croats have so that 
they should be treated equally, regardless of the fact that in 
the meantime they have become foreigners. 
  The usurpation of property in Croatia has been recordered by 
over 16,000 Yugoslav nationals. 
  It is assessed however that 25 to 30 percent of owners have 
not done so, expecting that the situation will sort itself out, 
so that it is certain that the total value of properties exceeds 
three billion dollars, Lalovic said in conclusion.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 5 April carries in its 
regular 10-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in 
the republic. Reception is poor. 
  Reporting from Gorazde, Fahrudin Becic says that "this has 
ben the worst night that the town has ever had. There have been 
24 people wounded, most of them seriously, while the number of 
those killed is still unknown. Howitzer shells are continuing 
to destroy the southwestern part of the town. The situation on 
the front could not be worse and the noose around Gorazde is 
tightening." He says that "the chetniks have committed new 
crimes against civilians in the villages on the right bank of 
the river. Several villages have been burnt to the ground. The 
town is full of new refugees." "Fierce infantry clashes 
continued this morning at about 0500. Fateful battles are under 
way at the gates of Gorazde." 
  In his report from Bihac Mirza Sadikovic says that "the Serb 
aggressor continued to attack the region overnight. Throughout 
the night and this morning Karadzic's terrorists have kept up 
the attacks with heavy machine guns and antiaircraft weapons on 
the (Gradiska) part of the front, and on the Grmusko-Srbljanski 
plateau and Hasin Vrh. The situation has been the same in the 
Croatian Defense Council's theater of operations, particularly 
in the area of (Veliki Postoj). As for the paramilitary 
formations of the so- called Kladusa autonomy, they kept up 
antiaircraft arms fire throughout the night." 
  Viktor Boban reports from the theater of operations of the 
Operative Group Bosna that "after trying in vain all day 
yesterday to recapture lost territories, last night the chetniks 
shelled civilian targets in the Hajdarevici area. Despite the 
heavy losses that the aggressor suffered overnight, he has again 
launched an attack this morning." 
  Reporting from Olovo, Amira Salihodzic says that "throughout 
the night the aggressor fired at our defense lines using a Praga 
[armored vehicle], a Bofors, antiaircraft guns and machine guns, 
and mortars, but without result."

  [Excerpt] Throughout the day yesterday, Serb-Montenegrin 
aggressors continued their heavy offensive on the free territory 
of the Gorazde district. 
  According to the press center of the Gorazde district, 
during 
the seventh day of the offensive on the town yesterday, the 
aggressor used over 350 types of the most destructive weapons 
and about 100 tanks and armored vehicles. Units of the 
Herzegovina, Sarajevo-Romanija, Drina, and Uzice Corps--as well 
as a large number of mercenaries from Romania, Russia, and 
neighboring municipalities--are taking part in the bloody 
onslaught on about 60,000 people, including refugees. The 
aggressor's fiercest attacks were directed against the southern 
section of the front, on the right bank of the Drina River, 
where--despite the defenders' fierce and heroic struggle--the 
chetniks succeeded in breaching our defense lines. [passage

  [Excerpts] Belgrade, April 5 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces 
confirmed Tuesday [5 April] they had broken through government 
defence lines in the eastern enclave of Gorazde in response to a 
government "offensive" and landed on the western bank of the 
Drina River. 
  In Geneva, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said 50 
people had been killed and 250 injured since last week in the 
fighting in Goradze. 
  Chief of staff Manojlo Milovanovic told the Bosnian Serb 
agency SRNA he had ordered his troops to launch a 
"counter-attack" towards Cajnica, southeast of Gorazde, close to 
the Serbian border, late Monday since "Moslem formations were 
trying to join up with forces from Sarajevo and the other 
enclaves." 
  SRNA said that Moslem units had fallen back to the villages 
of Vitkovici and Mrvavici. [passage omitted] 
  Milovanovic said the Gorazde defenders were attempting "to 
join up with Sandzak and beyond that with Kosovo." [passage

  [Text] Zagreb, April 5 (AFP) -- General Charles Ritchie, 
chief of staff of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in former 
Yugoslavia, dismissed Tuesday reports that the eastern enclave 
of Gorazde was about to fall to a separatist Serb onslaught. 
  "It is not our assessment that it is about to fall," Ritchie 
told reporters here. 
  Regarding "the more dramatic reports" of Serb incursions 
into 
the enclave, he said: "I'm afraid we have nothing to confirm on 
that." 
  Bosnian Serb chief of staff Manojlo Milovanovic confirmed 
earlier that his forces had breached Bosnian Army defence lines 
at Gorazde, succeeding in landing on the western bank of the 
Drina river which flows a few kilometres (miles) to the east and 
south of the town. 
  An UNPROFOR spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
warned of a "very serious" situation in the enclave.

<F P=106> [By Victoria Stegic] </F>
  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 5 (AFP) -- A UN spokesman warned 
of a "very serious" situation in the eastern enclave of Gorazde 
after Bosnian Serb forces confirmed Tuesday [5 April] they had 
broken through defence lines in response to a government 
"offensive." 
  A UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) official, insisting on 
anonymity, said the bombardment of the enclave on Monday had 
been so intense that UN military observers there had been unable 
to move about. Serb forces controlled every road or pathway 
leading to Gorazde and the two other beleaguered eastern 
enclaves Zepa and Srebrenica. 
  UNPROFOR spokesman Major Rob Annink said UN troops in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina were too thinly spread to spare men for 
Gorazde. 
  A spokesman here for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, 
Kris Janowski, said 49 people had been killed and 218 injured 
since last week in the fighting in Goradze. He cited a report 
sent from the enclave by UNHCR doctors at 1700 GMT Monday. A 
UNHCR spokesman in Geneva on Tuesday put the figures at 50 dead 
and 250 injured. 
  UN Security Council president Colin Keating of New Zealand 
said in New York late Monday that UN military advisors were 
being sent to the region. [passage omitted] 
  In Geneva, UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said a new wave of 
refugees was heading for Gorazde, according to one of the four 
UNHCR members there, with at least 45 arriving late Monday from 
Balici and other neighbouring villages. The level of fighting 
in the enclave was "still very high," he said. 
  Redmond said his organisation was "very concerned" with the 
situation in Gorazde where it had been "unable to get a convoy 
into the town since March 22. ... Those supplies are going to be 
running out and we desperately need to get more convoys." 
  Among those killed in the past week were 11 women and 
elderly 
people and seven children, he said, citing a UNHCR doctor who 
visited the town's hospital daily. Dozens of wounded needed to 
be evacuated, he added. [passage omitted] 
  Annink cited "other priorities" as a reason for the delay in 
getting UN troops to the Gorazde region, among them humanitarian 
aid and support of the ceasefire in Sarajevo and central Bosnia. 
  "We are already spread very thinly and we don't want to let 
up on security for our own troops. When we send them we have to 
be able to defend our own troops," he said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Jelena Dabarcic report] </F>
  [Text] After a brief lull on the Gorazde front yesterday, 
the Muslim forces early this morning renewed their attacks on 
the positions of the Serbian fighters in the direction of Foca 
and Cajnice. Fierce artillery-infantry attacks are being waged 
in the regions of Podkozare, Paljike, and Oglecevo, where 
Islamic fanatics are trying to breach the defense lines of the 
Serbian territory at any cost. 
  The Serbian military sources claim that the Muslims have 
regrouped their forces at the part of the front between Gorazde, 
Cajnice, and Foca, and that they have abandoned the idea of 
making an advance toward Cajnice via Gradina and Trebecevo, 
where they suffered major losses in the past few days. 
  According to Colonel Jezdimir Lakicevic, on the seventh day 
of their offensive, the Muslim forces from Gorazde are not 
giving up their plan of linking up with their forces in Sarajevo 
and reaching the border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 
and in this way realize their dream of establishing a green line 
linking Sarajevo, Gorazde, and Sandzak. 
  In the fighting that took place this morning, the Serbian 
side did not have any fatalities. Several fighters were wounded.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 5 Apr (TANJUG) -- The eight-day Muslim 
offensive launched from the direction of Gorazde towards the 
Serb territory in Srbinje (formerly Foca) and Cajnice has been 
crushed, while the units of the Srpska army have reached the 
right bank of the Drina River, Major General Manojlo 
Milovanovic, chief of the general staff of the Srpska army said 
today. 
  "Yesterday I ordered a counterattack to be carried out from 
the direction of Cajnice, because the Muslim units had 
persistently been trying to link up with their units in 
Sarajevo," Gen. Milovanovic said.

<F P=106> [Report by SRNA Journalist Mirjana Kusmuk] </F>
  [Text] We have learned from the Serbian Army Command in 
Rogatica that Muslim forces were fiercely attacking Serbian 
defense lines today from the direction of Gorazde along the 
lines of Mesici-Jabucko Sedlo and Ustipraca-Kopaci using all 
available weapons. The Muslim attempts at breaking through were 
successfully repelled and, according to Colonel Dragisa Masal, 
commander of the Visegrad Tactical Group, in these battles a 
score of Muslim soldiers were killed while there were no 
casualties in the ranks of the Serbian Army. 
  We have learned from intelligence sources of the Serbian 
Army 
in Rogatica that battles were again waged in Gorazde today 
between forces loyal to the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo and 
those who favor seeking a peaceful solution through agreements 
with the Serbs. Shots are being heard in the town during the 
entire day today and, according to the radio messages that have 
been monitored, there have been casualties on both sides. In a 
general panic, the civilian population of Gorazde is leaving the 
town and trying to go toward Sarajevo via Orahovice and Grebak. 
  According to well-informed Serbian military sources, 
Abduselam Sijeric (Belam), the Muslim commander responsible for 
the death of more than 300 Gorazde Serbs, was seriously wounded 
in inter-Muslim battles in Gorazde. Forces loyal to Izetbegovic 
under the command of Serif Buljubasic, which are mostly 
comprised of Muslims who had arrived from [word indistinct], are 
accusing Gorazde Muslims of an unsuccessful beginning of the 
long-planned offensive against Serbian positions in the 
direction of Cajnice, Rogatica, Srbinje, and Ustipraca. Open 
clashes between Muslims in Gorazde took place after this 
morning's raids in the town and arrests of military draftees who 
had not responded to summons to mobilization, as well as the 
execution of several deserters who were supposed to serve as 
examples to others. 
  The meeting held today between Radovan Karadzic, president 
of 
the Srpska republic, and Major General Manojlo Milovanovic, 
chief of the general staff of the army of the Srpska republic, 
with General Michael Rose, commander of UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, touched upon the 
current situation in Gorazde and the obligations of the army of 
the Srpska republic and UNPROFOR toward the peace process. As 
Gen. Milovanovic said after the meeting, special attention was 
devoted to protected zones in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
the obligations that UNPROFOR should meet in Srebrenica and Zepa. 
  Also discussed at the meeting was the realization of 
obligations taken in the Sarajevo region. Gen. Milovanovic 
pointed out that obligations are mostly met according to the 
agreement between representatives of the army of the Srpska 
republic and UNPROFOR from the meeting held on 9 February. 
  In reply to journalists' questions regarding the situation 
in 
Gorazde, Gen. Rose said that he does not know for sure what is 
happening in that town and that he cannot rely on reports by 
television stations such as CNN. He announced that, with a view 
to getting a more complete insight into the situation in the 
region, he will personally travel to Gorazde on Wednesday [6 
April]. 
  The meeting between Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the 
Srpska republic, and Andreas (Kuhn), representative of the 
International Red Cross Committee, is under way at the building 
of the presidency of the Srpska republic at Pale. The topic of 
the meeting is the current situation in Prijedor.

  [Text] U.S. Congressman Frank McCloskey is visiting 
Sarajevo. The U.S. visitor was today received by Presidency 
member and President of the Serbian Civic Council Mirko 
Pejanovic. 
  In the course of the meeting the topic most discussed was 
the 
possibility of the Serbs joining the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Federation. Moreover, the work of the Serbian Consultative 
Council and the Serbian Civic Council was also discussed, as 
were the possibilities for the return of Bosnian Serb refugees. 
Mirko Pejanovic acquainted the distinguished visitor with the 
new wave of ethnic cleansing that Karadzic's Serbs are carrying 
out in the areas of Banja Luka, Prijedor, and other places that 
are under their control. He asked McCloskey to strive for the 
United States' increased engagement in the region, because this 
great [word indistinct] is well-known precisely for the 
protection of human rights and liberties. If we fail in halting 
the Serbian fascism, I am not sure that we will be able to stop 
other fascism in these areas, said Pejanovic, and once again 
appealed to McCloskey to influence the United States' increased 
engagement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. McCloskey promised to do 
everything in his power to achieve -- through the consultative 
bodies of the U.S. Congress -- an increased U.S. presence in the 
solution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. 
  The distinguished U.S. visitor was also received by the 
Chief 
of General Staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army Supreme Command 
Rasim Delic. On this occasion, Mr. McCloskey showed interest in 
the progress of the implementation of the signed agreement 
between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Croatian Defense 
Council [HVO] and the implementation of the UN Security Council 
resolutions adopted so far. He also showed interest in the 
situation on the Bosnia-Herzegovina fronts, particularly in the 
situation in Gorazde after the Serbian aggressor's latest 
offensive. General Delic informed Mr. McCloskey about the 
situation on the Bosnia-Herzegovina fronts with special stress 
on the situation in Gorazde and Bihac. He reiterated that all 
that was happening in Gorazde and Bihac is yet another 
expression of the Serbian aggressor's defiance of the 
international community. General Delic also explained the 
Bosnia- Herzegovina Army's position regarding the situation in 
Sarajevo and regarding many other details important for grasping 
the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] U.S. Congressman Frank McCloskey spent yesterday 
and today in the capital city of Bosnia-Herzegovina. At today's 
news conference McCloskey stated his impressions of his visit to 
Sarajevo and Mostar. Guests at the conference were Prime 
Minister Haris Silajdzic and the President of the Serbian 
Consultative Council Ljubomir Berberovic. Nedzad Leko reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Leko] Congressman Frank McCloskey, 
member of the Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees in 
the U.S. Congress, said that the renewed attacks at Gorazde and 
Bihac confirm that the war is not over. 
  [McCloskey, in English fading into Serbo-Croat translation 
read by Leko] There is no doubt at all that the war still 
continues. Sarajevo, despite everything, is not a free city. It 
is a city under siege although it is not being shelled at the 
moment. I visited Mostar on two occasions on Friday and 
Saturday. The people on the eastern banks are still suffering, 
the food is inadequate, there is no electricity, they drink 
unfiltered water from the Neretva River. In the meantime, the 
terrible ethnic cleansing continues, particularly in the region 
of Banja Luka and Prijedor. Sixty thousand citizens of Gorazde 
are under siege. Many things still need to be done. In 
comparison to the pre-war situation, only 24,000, or 7 percent 
of the non-Serbian population, has remained in the region of 
Banja Luka. The entire world continues to turn a blind eye 
while this ethnic cleansing continues in Banja Luka and other 
areas. The planned evacuation from Prijedor is against all the 
provisions of international law and human ethics. That is why 
we need to ask ourselves what the world is doing, why is it not 
acting? Something must be done. The world must not turn a 
blind eye to this. When I return to Washington, I will request 
the Administration to send U.S. personnel here. For the time 
being, these do not need to be peace forces, but logistics 
personnel, engineers, administrators, medical crews. I believe 
that this would help maintain the peace between the Bosniaks and 
the Croats. 
  [Leko] Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic called on the 
international community to react urgently to the attacks on 
Gorazde and the ethnic cleansing. 
  [Silajdzic, in English fading into Serbo-Croat translation 
read by Leko] The question is why the UN Security Council is 
not reacting to this. What does the term safe haven mean if not 
the protection of the civilian population in Gorazde and Bihac? 
Second, why is the Convention on Genocide from 1949 not 
observed, when genocide continues in Bosnia-Herzegovina? The 
process of ethnic cleansing is being drawn to a close in Banja 
Luka and Prijedor, genocide is being completed. This, of 
course, to a great extent calls into question the continuation 
of the peace process. If in this way a situation is created 
where there will be no non-Serbian population in the occupied 
areas, then this creates a different situation at the 
negotiating table. The problem is that the international 
community minimizes this fact, which in turn creates yet another 
situation, that is, these people are encouraged to carry on. 
They are attacking Gorazde, Bihac, they are ethnically 
cleansing Prijedor, Sipovo, Banja Luka, yet there is no 
reaction. Our question is why the Security Council is not 
reacting to this, because they have an obligation to react. 
  [Leko] Dr. Ljubo Berberovic, president of the Serbian 
Consultative Council informed the correspondents about the 
measures this body was taking in connection to this. 
  [Berberovic, in English fading into Serbo-Croat translation 
read by Leko] The Serbian Civic Council and the Serbian 
Consultative Council in Sarajevo have written to the UN Security 
Council demanding urgent action to stop the further maltreatment 
of civilians and any further ethnic cleansing. If this is not 
done, there will be little chance of successfully defending 
Bosnia- Herzegovina as a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural 
community. We have proposed that groups of observers be 
urgently sent to Banja Luka and Prijedor as the first step 
toward maintaining chances for a successful continuation of the 
peace process. 
  [Leko] At the end of the news conference, Congressman 
McCloskey said that it was still not too late for the salvation 
of hundreds of thousands of human lives. Genocide and ethnic 
cleansing must be stopped by an urgent action of the 
international community. [end recording]

  [Text] Sarajevo, 4 April (Tanjug) -- President of the 
Srpska republic Radovan Karadzic and Srpska republic army Chief 
of General Staff Major General Manojlo Milovanovic received the 
UNPROFOR commander for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Britain's 
General Michael Rose, in Pale today. 
  Their talks focused on the obligations of the Srpska army 
and 
UNPROFOR; General Milovanovic and Rose made press statements 
following the talks. 
  "We met today to improve the initiated peace process on the 
territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina. We discussed many 
issues including obligations for the army of the Srpska republic 
as regards the peace process, but also UNPROFOR obligations in 
the restoration of peace in this area", Milovanovic said. 
  "We also had talks on the so-called safe areas and the 
obligations that UNPROFOR has to fulfill in Srebrenica and Zepa. 
We dwelt on the problem of Gorazde, which is also one of the 
safe areas according to UN Security Council resolutions," 
Milovanovic said. 
  He stressed that they also discussed the issue of Sarajevo 
as 
regards building on what was agreed on 9 February, saying that 
the implementation of the agreement was proceeding well. 
  General Rose said that at the meeting today they discussed 
the principles of defining the territories and borders of the 
safe areas. Commenting on the situation around Gorazde, Rose 
said that reports coming from that area were scanty, but he 
thought that there had been no important changes on the ground. 
  "We must not rely on media reports alone, CNN for instance. 
Military observers are on the spot, and I agreed with General 
Milovanovic that I should go to Gorazde on Wednesday [6 April] 
and see for myself what is really happening there", Rose said. 
  Their meeting was also attended by the speaker of the 
people's assembly of the Srpska republic, Momcilo Krajisnik, and 
vice president of the Srpska republic Nikola Koljevic.

  [Text] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Government has written to the 
Government of the Republic of Croatia from today's session 
[words indistinct]. 
  We were surprised to hear the instructions of the Croatian 
Government's Office for Refugees, which discontinues refugee 
status in the Republic of Croatia for citizens from the area of 
the Mostar municipality. Our surprise is all the greater since 
we know that Arif Smajkic, minister for refugees, labor, and 
social policy in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government, during his 
recent visit and talks with deputy prime minister of the 
Croatian Government Ivica Kostovic, and director of the Office 
for Refugees Adalbert Rebic agreed on joint activities of the 
two governments regarding the return of refugees from Croatia to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. An identical agreement was reached with the 
representatives of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina at 
the recently held Constituent Assembly of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Federation. Therefore, we propose to the Croatian Government to 
annul the aforementioned instructions and create conditions for 
joint preparations for all activities pertaining to the 
organized return of refugees and displaced persons to which we 
are obliged by the provisions of international treaties on the 
repatriation of refugees, reads the statement of the Information 
Ministry.

  [Text] Banja Luka, 3 Apr (TANJUG) -- The murders which took 
place in Prijedor between 29 March and 1 April are criminal acts 
commited by hitherto unidentified perpetrators, and intensive 
action is being taken to uncover those who committed them, the 
interior ministry of the Srpska republic [RS] has said in a 
statement. 
  The statement says that eight criminal acts of murder were 
committed in the specified period and that 16 people, mainly 
Muslims, lost their lives [as received]. 
  Regarding claims by some foreign agencies that the murders 
were part of ethnic cleansing in and around Prijedor, the 
statement says that these were criminal acts by hitherto 
unidentified perpetrators, against whom criminal charges have 
been filed. 
  "Teams of Ministry of Internal Affairs and security organs 
of 
the Srpska republic army are working intensively on collecting 
data in order to identify and arrest the perpetrators of the 
crimes," the statement says and adds that all possible 
preventive measures are being taken to stop any further 
escalation of crime. 
  The interior ministry points to the fact that the events in 
Prijedor took place during the Muslim spring offensive, which -- 
through the crimes committed -- demonstrated that the Muslims 
were prepared to use all available means to achieve their goals. 
This contributed to the escalation of the interethnic conflicts 
in this area, where such conflicts had not occurred for a long 
time. 
  The RS interior ministry appeals to all international 
institutions "which have influence in the area" to use it to 
protect the Serb population in the areas controlled by Muslims. 
  They particularly demand that prisoners be treated according 
to international law. 
  In this way extremists among the Serb people can also be 
opposed more effectively and better protection can be given to 
the Serb people and all citizens living on the RS territory, the 
statement says in conclusion.

  [Text] Belgrade, 3 Apr (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, today issued a strict order to 
relevant organs to speed up the investigation in Prijedor to 
uncover the perpetrators of the criminal activities and to 
arrest all those responsible for the events in the town, the 
Srpska republic president's office said in a statement. 
  The statement, forwarded to TANJUG, says that Radovan 
Karadzic's order particularly stressed that enemies of the 
Srpska republic were intensifying attacks against the 
sovereignty and independence of the Srpska republic, in an 
attempt to create a state of chaos, to compromise its civilian 
authorities, and prevent the creation and functioning of the 
Serb state. 
  The Srpska republic president also issued strict 
instructions 
regarding the safeguarding of the security of members of 
minorities, as well as instructions to all Srpska republic 
civilian and military authorities to give all possible help to 
the International Red Cross, the statement says. 
  President Karadzic's order also emphasized that all 
perpetrators of criminal activities were to be tried and most 
severely punished before the entire world public, the statement 
says in conclusion.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 4 (AFP) -- The Red Cross Monday [4 
April] postponed plans to evacuate thousands of Moslems from the 
town of Prijedor following ethnic killings, citing disagreement 
with Bosnian Serbs over how many people are to leave. 
  The announcement came from Andreas Kuhn of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross after a meeting with Bosnian Serb 
leader Radovan Karadzic in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale 
near Sarajevo. 
  "I am not sure whether we will go back to negotiation or 
we'll take other measures" to protect the Moslems of Prijedor in 
western Bosnia, Kuhn said. "This is to be decided in Geneva." 
  Asked if the Red Cross continued with preparations for the 
evacuation, Kuhn said, "We are ready and we remain ready." 
  The Red Cross and the United Nations had planned to begin 
the 
evacuation of about 6,000 people from Prijedor on Tuesday. 
  Moslems there fear for their lives following a massacre last 
week in which 17 Moslems and three Croats were killed, UN 
officials say.

  [Text] Banja Luka, 4 Mar (TANJUG) -- Christian Bruner, an 
International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] official in 
Banja Luka, has told a TANJUG correspondent that there will be 
no large-scale evacuation of the Muslim and Croat population 
tomorrow as intimated by some of the world's media, including 
the Croatian and Muslim media. 
  Bruner says the situation in Prijedor is much better 
following the order of Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska 
republic, that an investigation into the killings in Prijedor be 
completed so that those responsible are discovered. 
  Bruner says that it is only possible for permission to be 
granted for the resettlement of a number of people who have 
expressed great fear for their lives and who want to leave 
Prijedor. This resettlement will not begin tomorrow either but 
will be carried out over the next few days. 
  He stresses that security guarantees from the Serb 
authorities are needed during their transportation for this 
resettlement to take place. He added that talks will begin 
tomorrow between ICRC representatives and the Srpska republic 
authorities and that he believes that all the necessary 
gaurantees will be given.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 4 April carries in its 
regular 31-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in 
the republic. 
  The studio announcer says that "after bringing in fresh 
forces from Serbia and Montenegro and mercenaries from Russia, 
Romania, and other places, the chetniks continued their fierce 
attacks on Gorazde." 
  Gorazde correspondent Fahrudin Becic reports that "many of 
them [enemy troops] today remained in the woods in front of the 
defense lines on Lastan and Popovaca. The warmongers and 
chetnik commanders simply replaced them with new criminals. The 
defenders are paying no attention to this, and are readily 
responding to infantry attacks which follow after every savage 
shelling. They have repelled 10 such attacks. On the other 
part of the front, on the route towards Rogatica [words 
indistinct]. The defenders on the free parts of the Rogatica 
municipality have repelled several extremely fierce infantry 
attacks, supported by tanks, howitzers, and multiple rocket 
launchers. The aggressor also attacked the areas between Mecic 
and Ustipraca and the area of the 1,207 m high Mt. Gostunj. He 
suffered losses in all of these attacks. This is confirmed by 
the fact that 200 blood donors arrived in Cajnice today from 
Jagodina. As nightfall approaches, the chetnik attacks are 
intensifying. No one has the time to count all the shells, but 
according to a rough estimate, over 10,000 shells have landed by 
1700." 
  The studio announcer reads a report from the 7-South 
Operative Group, and says that "chetnik shells killed [stradati] 
12 people as they were unloading a humanitarian aid truck in the 
operational zone of the Croatian Defense Council Usora Brigade. 
There were small arms' provocations and sniper fire in the 
operational zone of the 201st Chivalrous Brigade. The aggressor 
also attacked with antiaircraft weapons in the area of Maglaj. 
A regrouping of the aggressor forces was sighted in this area." 
  Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko and says that "the Serbian 
aggressor is still [word indistinct] on artillery attacks. 
Today, recoilless guns, mortars, portable rocket launchers from 
Cadjavac and from the direction of Omerbegovaca pounded the 
defense in the region of Vranovaca. Chetnik antiaircraft guns 
fiercely shelled Djukici." 
  An unidentified correspondent from the Srebrenica Press 
Center reports that "the aggressor, using antiaircraft guns and 
antiaircraft machine guns from Kopresko and Visica Brdo, is 
relentlessly shelling the border areas of Sutjeska. He is using 
60-mm mortars to sporadically shell the region [name 
indistinct]. [Words indistinct] the aggressor's antiaircraft 
guns and antiaircraft machine guns are shelling the outskirts of 
the town. A concentration of manpower and equipment has been 
sighted in the region of Jasenova, where the aggressor has 
captured two demilitarized zones."

  [Text] News from Bosnia-Herzegovina: The Serbs committed a 
new crime in Usora today. Shrapnel from a grenade fired by the 
Serbs wounded 13 civilians who were lining up for humanitarian 
aid, the department for political activites of the 110th brigade 
of the Usora Croatian Defense Council has announced. 
  Doctors in a hospital in Tesanj are fighting to save their 
lives. One child has already died from the shrapnel wounds. 
According to the same source, since 1300 this morning Serb 
artillery has been pounding the villages of the free Croatian 
community of Usora from several directions. A humanitarian aid 
convoy and the spiritual center of the Usora Croats -- the 
parish church of St. Anthony in Sivsa -- are coming under the 
fiercest attacks. Considerable material damage has been caused 
to residential buildings.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 4 (TANJUG) - A Croatian radio 
correspondent reported from Mostar on Monday evening that the 
ceasefire has been seriously violated in this town in southern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina after several heavy shells were fired from 
Moslem east Mostar on Croat west Mostar. 
  Radio Free Europe reported this evening that two Moslem 
soldiers were killed and four were wounded in Croat-Moslem 
clashes near Gornji Vakuf. 
  Moslem Radio Sarajevo has not reported about Moslem-Croat 
clashes around Gornji Vakuf these days, but Croatian radio 
claims that the fighting is between two groups of smugglers. 
The Croatian radio did not say which side sustained casualties. 
  Military sources of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) have 
said that the HVO military police will try to seize the 
smugglers, who are said to have "abused the reached agreements 
on opening communications and are not refraining even from armed 
clashes." 
  Bosnian Croats and Moslems signed an agreement on the 
forming 
of a Moslem-Croat federation in Washington in mid-March under 
strong pressure from the United States. The federation 
Constitution has already been adopted but clashes between the 
two peoples continue. Serbs, the third nation who live in this 
former Yugoslav republic were not invited to the Washington 
talks.

  [Text] Banja Luka, April 4 (TANJUG)--Bosnian Moslems are 
continuing to attack on most fronts, with the brunt of the 
offensive directed against the areas of Teslic, Mt. Ozren and 
Doboj in the north, Bosnian Serb army sources said late on 
Monday. 
  The Moslems have intensified attacks on the Serb positions 
in 
northern Bosnia as part of an all-out offensive, launched with 
the object of taking the Sava River valley and cutting off a 
corridor linking the eastern and western parts of the Bosnian 
Serb republic. 
  The Bosnian Serb army command in Banja Luka reported the 
worst fighting to be in the Teslic area, where infantry attacks 
on the southern and southeastern sectors of the front were 
preceded by heavy artillery shellings. 
  Moslem forces have stepped up operations also on the 
southwestern sector of the Ozren front and on the southern 
slopes of Mt. Ozren, in an effort to break through the Serb 
defence lines, the source said. 
  Heavy artillery and infantry operations were reported also 
on 
the Doboj front, with the Moslems dropping several shells on the 
town of Doboj itself. There were no casualties, the report 
said.

  [Excerpt] Banja Luka, 4 Apr (TANJUG) -- Muslim forces have 
intensified their attacks on Serb positions west of Brcko, the 
information service of the First Krajina Corps of the Srpska 
republic army said in Banja Luka today. 
  The fiercest attacks were launched from the direction of 
Bajici on the Brcko suburb of Ulice which was targeted with more 
than 10 mortar shells. There was also fire from antiaircraft and 
infantry weapons on this part of the battlefield. Srpska 
republic army units were forced to respond to silence the enemy. 
  Large movements of troops belonging to the so-called 
Bosnia-Herzegovina army were observed on the Gradacac part of 
the front as well as very intense movements of armored vehicles 
near the frontline and in the enemy's territory. [passage

  [Text] Banja Luka, 4 Apr (TANJUG) -- Muslim forces this 
morning launched a heavy attack from the direction of Prusac and 
Bugojno against Serb defense lines five kilometers south of 
Srbobran [Donji Vakuf] the information service of the 1st 
Krajina Corps of the Srpska republic army announced in Banja 
Luka. The Muslims used 82-mm mortars, anti-aircraft and infantry 
weapons. The defense lines have not changed, but several Serb 
fighters were wounded. Members of the Srpska republic army 
responded to the fire, after which the firing stopped. 
  This report also denies yesterday's news broadcast by 
Croatian and Muslim media that their units reached a position 
one kilometer from the center of Srbobran. Serb military 
sources also deny that combined Muslim and Croat units took part 
in the attack, saying that this is a propaganda trick. They 
stress that the attack on Serbobran is conducted mainly by 
Muslims who earlier escaped from the town and also members of 
the 370th Donji Vakuf Brigade of the so-called 
Bosnia-Herzegovina army.

  [Text] Cajnice, April 4 (TANJUG) -- Following seven days of 
fruitless efforts by Moslem forces to penetrate Serb lines with 
offensive infantry and artillery attacks from Gorazde, a United 
Nations protected area in eastern Bosnia, the troops are 
panicking and deserting, Bosnian Serb military sources have said. 
  In the area of the village of Trebesevo on Monday the local 
command of the troops loyal to Bosnian Moslem Leader Alija 
Izetbegovic ordered four Moslem troops to be shot after they 
abandoned their positions, the sources said. 
  The Moslem offensive is aimed at Cajnice, Foca and Rogatici, 
and the heaviest fighting on Monday took place in the area of 
the villages of Podkozarje and Oglecevo. 
  Moslem troops began an offensive on the Bosnian Serb 
republic 
in the second half of March, after they signed an agreement with 
Bosnian Croats on setting up a Moslem-Croat federation in 
Bosnia.

  [Excerpt] Zvornik, Bratunac, 5 Apr (TANJUG) -- An all-out 
Muslim offensive against the Srpska republic in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with the Croatian support from the left bank 
of the Sava river is continuing, but the signs that it will be 
crushed have already become obvious, a TANJUG correspondent 
learned today from the circles close to the general staff of the 
army of the Srpska republic. 
  These circles have warned that "unless the regular Army of 
the Republic of Croatia halts its attacks on all Serb defense 
lines in Posavina [region along the Sava river] today," "the 
Srpska army will retaliate," from which the Serb side has 
refrained so far. 
  This means, the circles have said, that the army of the 
Srpska republic "would begin with actions with all their forces 
and from all means at their disposal against the territory of 
the Republic of Croatia," as "attacks from long-range artillery 
and missiles systems from the left bank of the Sava river have 
been incessant over the past three days." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Jadranko Prlic, prime minister of the </F>
Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, with unidentified 
correspondent-- live] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Our guest this evening is Jadranko 
Prlic, the prime minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. 
Good evening, and Happy Easter. 
  [Prlic] Thank you, the same to you and to all Croatian TV 
viewers. 
  [Correspondent] A slightly provocative question to start 
with: Does the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and its government 
still exist after the adoption of the Constitution? 
  [Prlic] Yes. In accordance with the adopted Constitution of 
the federation, all transitional legal arrangements are valid in 
this period until the elections are held or, in other words, 
until the Constitution agreement has been fully implemented. 
  [Correspondent] How do you view some statements--for 
example, 
the one by Ivo Komsic, that Herceg-Bosna is some kind of a para- 
state--something that is comparable to the so-called Krajina in 
Croatia? Can some individuals, such as Komsic from Sarajevo, 
jeopardize the agreement? 
  [Prlic] We adhere to our own policy, and we know what we are 
doing. Such statements cannot dispute the rights of the Croat 
people, which are most fully protected by the very creation and 
existence of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. 
  [Correspondent] Would you say that those rights have been 
respected over the last month? 
  [Prlic] Yes, although there have been some attempts--which 
was clear in Sarajevo--to say that Herceg-Bosna does not exist, 
that its existence is the key cause of the conflict between the 
Muslims and Croats. We, of course, have always denied this. 
The conflict began with Muslim aggression, and that is 
completely clear to everyone. 
  Another very important thing is an attempt to impose a 
feeling of collective guilt upon the Croats for everything that 
happened during the last year, which we have also rejected and 
have proved just the opposite. 
  [Correspondent] Croatian Defense Council [HVO] soldiers in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina told me when I was in Herzegovina that they 
would never have the fleur-de-lys [Bosnian symbol] sown on their 
uniforms. Can you comment on that? Also, how long can the 
transition to the federation last, and what will it be like? 
  [Prlic] The fleur-de-lys will not be worn because the 
Constitution envisages that all symbols of the Bosniak-Muslim 
and Croat federation--the flag, the coat of arms--will be chosen 
jointly. The fleur-de-lys is not a state symbol. It remains 
the symbol of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina only in the 
transitional period. For as long as the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina exists--with the old assembly, presidency, 
and government--the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna will also 
exist. 
  [Correspondent] Do you personally believe in a quick 
transition, or will it take time? 
  [Prlic] The transition will last for five or six months. The 
starting point was the adoption of the Constitution. Local 
elections will be held within five months and federal elections 
within six months at the most. We expect that the Constitution 
agreement will be fully implemented within that period. 
  [Correspondent] There are 32,500 Croats in Sarajevo, 
according to the church register. Many more of our people live 
elsewhere in Bosnia. Are they a forgotten part of the Croat 
people, deprived of their rights? 
  [Prlic] No. Who was looking after all the Croats who live 
outside of the territories controlled by the HVO? There are a 
lot of examples; one is the care provided for the Croats in 
Banja Luka, in the Krajina area [sentence as heard]. We also 
reacted sharply to the events in Prijedor. (?We also took care 
of) the Croats in Tuzla, Brcko, Zenica, Sarajevo etc. We allow 
other positions and views, but we will not go beyond a minimum: 
to secure for all Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina the same rights 
as those of the other constituent nation in the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. 
  [Correspondent] Where is the Sarajevo HVO? We have reports 
that the Croat National Council and the Bosnian presidency have 
been presenting themselves as representatives to Western guests? 
Where is the Sarajevo HVO ? 
  [Prlic] We installed an HVO headquarters in Sarajevo last 
week, and its activities will be in accordance with the 
Roso-Delic peace agreement, providing for deployment of our 
troops, our security service, and our officers. 
  [Correspondent] Some say that Croats have limited themselves 
to western Herzegovina, that they have forgotten about Sarajevo, 
Tuzla, and so on. You have just denied this. 
  [Prlic] We have not forgotten, simply because the Chamber of 
Deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna is made up of 
Croats from all parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. That is why I 
think that such statements are deceitful. 
  [Correspondent] Some on the Bosniak side are still against 
the agreement, and this makes things very difficult. Is there 
any dissent on the Croat side, and how would you define it? 
  [Prlic] Well, resistance to the agreement could be caused by 
the understanding of some that we have not achieved as much as 
we could have. This agreement is a historical necessity, and 
that is how it should be understood. My impression is that a 
huge majority of Croats and even more Bosniak Muslims support 
the agreement. Some of those against the agreement are 
extremist forces in both nations. Some have lost family members 
or friends during the war and cannot accept any kind of 
agreement with the side that we fought against over the last 
year because of the psychological state they are in. However, I 
believe that we have good foundations for the implementation of 
the agreement. I even believe that the agreement is being 
implemented in the field much faster than was expected in the 
beginning. 
  [Correspondent] When I ask you about the future, Mr. Prime 
Minister, I would like to know more about business 
possibilities. What can the people from prosperous Herzegovina 
offer to Croats in Bosnia, since they have been separated thus 
far? What can they get? 
  [Prlic] We have already worked out some 30 reconstruction 
projects, particularly in connection with infrastructure, 
education, and health. The rest of the program is being 
prepared, and I believe that we have to develop an appropriate 
system throughout the territory of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
federation in the initial phase. Until now--maybe it is immodest 
for me to say this--the only state that exists and that 
functions on the territory of Bosnia- Herzegovina is the Croat 
republic of Herceg-Bosna. I am aware how the state system 
functions in the territory controlled by the Serbs in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and now I have seen--and I knew previously 
from information we had--that such a system does not exist in 
factual terms on territory controlled by the Muslim army. 
  I expect that the deputy prime minister of the Sarajevo 
government will come to Mostar this week together with several 
other ministers. On this occasion, talks will be held on all 
operational matters in connection with the development of the 
economic and financial system, on the enabling of the free 
movement of goods and capital, and--conditionally--on the 
expected arrival of foreign capital--above all, for the 
reconstruction of the infrastructure. 
  [Correspondent] One of my friends is a businessman. When 
will he be able to go to Sarajevo, according to you, and open a 
factory there? Is there such a possibility, and do you see this 
happening soon? 
  [Prlic] I do. It was, in fact, I who initiated these talks 
and the possibility of opening up Sarajevo, and I believe that 
in the coming month we will be able to have more serious talks 
on this. 
  We reached agreement in Sarajevo with the military 
commanders-- who are already installing their headquarters in 
Sarajevo--to rent two or three large buildings in Sarajevo where 
we will open a Croatian bank and Croatian insurance company and 
make it possible for Croatian factories to establish themselves 
to a large extent and to set up the center of their business 
operations in Sarajevo. I believe we will achieve this in the 
coming month or two, and this will make possible the greater 
presence of Croats in the capital of the federation. 
  [Correspondent] Do you believe personally in the Croats in 
Sarajevo and in Tuzla? How do you see the possibility of their 
becoming involved and beginning to live? 
  [Prlic] I believe it is possible. I believe that this 
constitutional agreement and the quality-based selection of 
personnel for the authorities of the federation will ensure for 
them equality and the possibility of full national, economic, 
and personal prosperity. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, at the end of this 
conversation, have you got anything you would like to say to 
people in Herceg-Bosna and to people in Bosnia? 
  [Prlic] I would like to send them word that they are secure, 
that Croatian policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina takes account of all 
Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as those who are in the 
territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina and those who are refugees as a 
result of the war in these areas. We want to realize our 
rights, but not to the detriment of the other nation with whom 
we have joined to form the federation, and also not to the 
detriment of the third nation that we expect to accept this 
agreement in the period ahead. I would like to send word to 
them to be patient and to attempt, in the elections that will be 
held, to elect those people who can competently represent them 
and build a state that will be much better than the one in which 
we lived before the war. 
  [Correspondent] Dr. Jadranko Prlic, prime minister of the 
Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, thank you for being our guest. 
  [Prlic] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski: "President--Parliament, </F>
Coalition, Government; Conflict Over Everything"] 
  [Excerpts] There are increasingly fewer issues in which 
the president, parliament, and the government are harmoniously 
cooperating with one another. The Constitution, the concordat, 
the deputy ministerial posts in the Ministry of National 
Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs, the new Popiwek [tax on excessive wage 
increases] Law, the vacant post of the deputy prime minister and 
finance minister, the National Council of Radio and Television 
[KRRiT]--these are the most important areas of the current 
conflict. [passage omitted] 
  The next predictable disputes between the president and the 
parliament along with the coalition will be over KRRiT, when the 
report of the council is voted on and if the Constitutional 
Tribunal decides that Walesa did not have the right to recall 
Marek Markiewicz. Another controversial issue may be the 
concordat, if the Sejm rejects it, first of all with the votes 
of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. 
  A storm will be caused by the president's decision 
concerning 
the budget, regardless of what the president finally decides. 
If he vetoes the budget law, the coalition will accuse him of 
impeding reforms, populism, destructive activities. If he signs 
this law, he will cause a storm himself because he will want to 
justify the decision--to Solidarity, for instance. The 
foretaste of the storm can already be felt when Walesa 
criticizes the coalition for not implementing its preelection 
promises and for deceiving the people. 
  Now and then one of the coalition politicians... 
<H5>  Will Try To Frighten the President </H5>
  ...with prospects of limiting his powers--that is, something 
he does not like listening to the most. The president will 
repay in kind with threats of earlier elections--that is, he 
will hit the most sensitive spot of the parliament members and 
the coalition. On this issue, however, probably neither party 
will take any specific steps in the near future. The coalition 
seems to be aware of the fact that an attempt to limit Walesa's 
powers would mean total war. 
  In the Thursday [31 March] interview for the PAP press 
agency, Walesa implied very clearly that, in such a situation, 
he would ask the people to decide. "Then I would tell the 
people: You fought for Walesa, we fought for a president, and 
now we can see a monopoly of the communist type being 
established. Do you agree to that? Are you not afraid that 
communism is coming back in the way power is wielded and that it 
wants to exclude the president--not Walesa but the president? 
Therefore, if you do not wake up now, if you do not make your 
deputies retreat from that, I will not guarantee further 
stability processes." 
  In the future, we may witness a conflict over who should 
carry out Poland's foreign policy. Lech Walesa likes to make 
decisions in this area himself, and the activeness of the 
parliament members who willingly travel abroad is beginning to 
irritate him. 
  Walesa is not directing his criticism at the government or 
the prime minister. If he vetoes the new popiwek law, it will 
be a propaganda blow delivered to the parliament, to the 
coalition that passed this law and not to the government, which 
prepared it and forwarded it to the Sejm. If the post of deputy 
prime minister and finance minister is still vacant, it is the 
result of the game played between Walesa and the coalition, not 
the government. 
<H5>  It Is Not the Government That Is the Evil Spirit </H5>
  ...but the parliament and the coalition, or, in fact, the 
SLD. This does not mean that he protects the government. The 
reason for this is more banal: He may gain more, in terms of 
prestige, in a war with the parliament or with the SLD; one of 
the reasons for this is the fact that the government is for the 
time being not perceived as one "close-knit" team. Now, it is 
known that a good opponent is one that is clear and specific.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksander Malkiewicz: "CEFTA--Past and Future; </F>
A Market Like the EC's?"] 
  [Text] "In the next two years, we shall be repaying our 
roughly $87 million debt to the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 
the form of construction services and coal and equipment 
shipments," declared Maciej Lesny at a press conference. Lesny 
is an under secretary of state at the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Cooperation and the head of the Polish negotiating 
mission. He made this declaration following his return from the 
Prague meeting of the Joint Committee of CEFTA (Central European 
Free Trade Agreement signed on 21 December 1992 in Krakow by the 
Czech Republic, the Polish Republic, the Slovak Republic, and 
the Hungarian Republic). Under that agreement, a free trade zone 
is to be established among these countries by 1998. "An 
understanding to hasten the liberalization of trade among 
Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary will be 
reached by the end of April or the beginning of May of this 
year," Minister Lesny emphasized. 
  The gradual abolition of tariffs among the member countries 
of CEFTA, which represents a market of 65 million consumers, is 
intended to increase mutual trade, whose volume at present does 
not exceed $1 billion. Accordingly, the Prague meeting resolved 
to reduce by one-third the duties on industrial goods as early 
as on 1 July 1994. This is in the spirit of the provisions of 
the CEFTA agreement. 
  Unlike the agreements with the EC and EFTA [European Free 
Trade Association], the Central European agreement is based on 
the principle of equivalence and reciprocal advantages, meaning 
that all of the parties are to benefit equally from liberalized 
trade terms. 
  The agreement between Poland and its southern neighbor 
states 
reflects a compromise reached in the course of long and often 
dramatic negotiations. The main points of contention concerned 
the tariff abolition timetables and the division of manufactured 
goods into three groups among our countries, with separate 
duty-slashing schedules for each of these groups. Relatively 
speaking, the boldest attitude in this matter was represented, 
as the deputy minister explained, by Czechoslovakia, which has 
been levying customs duties of as little as several percent 
since 1991. In its turn, the position of Hungary, which has also 
been applying relatively low (though higher than the 
Czechoslovak) duty rates, was dictated by the desire to match 
these rates to those specified in its agreements with the EC and 
EFTA, which provide for completing the Hungarian reductions of 
duty rates by 1 January 2001. To Poland, which has during these 
negotiations been levying the highest duty rates among CEFTA 
members, an earlier date was acceptable because, as is known, 
duties on manufactured goods deriving from the EC and EFTA will 
be, with a few exceptions, abolished by 1 January 1999. 
  In effect, duties on the first group of merchandise, the 
so-called List A, were to be immediately abolished on the 
effective date of the agreement--that is, as of 1 May 1993. In 
general, that group comprises relatively unprocessed goods 
(among other things, raw materials and semifinished products). 
As a result, and owing to the even earlier applicable zero duty 
rates, approximately 50-60 percent of Polish exports to the 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary are duty-exempt. As for 
the second group of merchandise, the so-called List B, which 
comprises goods of medium susceptibility [to foreign 
competition], the related duties will be reduced in three equal 
installments of one-third each during the period between 1 
January 1995 and 1 January 1997. The so-called List C includes 
goods most susceptible to foreign competition, such as textile, 
metal, automotive, electronic, and similar products. The related 
duties will be reduced to zero in seven installments during the 
period from 1 January 1995 to 1 January 2001. 
  The CEFTA member countries also pledged themselves to 
gradually abolish the existing nontariff restraints on trade 
(such as concessions, import quotas, import and export 
prohibitions) and to refrain from introducing any new such 
restraints in mutual trade. 
  The problem of farm products received special treatment 
under 
CEFTA. No member country was prepared to fully open its 
agricultural and food market, and, hence, liberalization in that 
domain extended to only a few commodities, mostly in 
quantitative terms. In the case of agricultural products, the 
existing regulations remain binding, and new ones, protecting 
against foreign competition, may be introduced. 
  The text of CEFTA also provides for a gradual attainment of 
world standards (developed under GATT) by the parties thereto 
upon employing economic instruments distorting [as published] 
free competition in world trade. 
  This concerns, among other things, nondiscriminating 
domestic 
taxation, policy on state monopolies, rules of competition and 
governmental economic aid to enterprises, manufacturing orders, 
and antidumping measures. 
  Strictly speaking, CEFTA is not an integrative agreement to 
create an organization similar to that of the European 
Community, the European Union [EU], or EFTA. It does not provide 
for permanent bodies such as the EU Commission or the EFTA 
Secretariat. 
  This approach is dictated by the idea that an excessive 
institutionalization of economic cooperation may engender a 
mistaken belief in the political and economic self-sufficiency 
of the countries of Central Europe. 
  The more than a year that has passed since the provisions of 
CEFTA began to be implemented is, in the opinion of experts, too 
short a period to assess in detail its effect on the structure 
and volume of trade. But it can be stated that, even now, our 
country is deriving measurable advantages: In 1993, its balance 
of trade with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary was 
positive. 
  Although these countries, taken together, account for merely 
7-8 percent of our foreign trade, they rank among the 10 biggest 
Polish trade partners. 
  Even as CEFTA was being signed, the signatories provided for 
the possibility of modifying its provisions. Their concurrently 
signed joint political declaration of 21 December 1992 mentions 
the desire to hasten and broaden the liberalization of trade 
beyond the terms of the original agreement. Since last March, 
the partners have been discussing revisions of reciprocal 
concessions that will probably result, after 1 January 1998, in 
abolishing a definite majority of duties on manufactured goods 
as well as in marked reductions of duties on and increases in 
quotas for farm products. 
  Moreover, during the negotiations in Prague, it was decided 
to advance to 1 July 1994 from 1 January 1995 the commencement 
of the abolition of duties. Merchandise on List A will become 
nondutiable as early as at the beginning of next year. The duty 
rates on merchandise on List B will be reduced in three stages: 
on 1 July 1994, on 1 January 1996, and on 1 January 1997. Trade 
in susceptible [to foreign competition] merchandise (metal 
products, textiles, some chemicals) will be liberalized in four 
stages. 
  The text of CEFTA allows its signatories to conclude 
agreements on free trade with other countries, as well. 
According to Minister Lesny, such agreements are to be concluded 
[between Poland and] Turkey, Romania, and Israel. 
  Negotiations with the Baltic republics are also under way. 
For the time being, a highly liberalized flow of goods and 
capital is to be possible within the next year or so among the 
Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary. This should

<F P=106> [Article by "u.s." and commentary by Adam Michnik: "Simple </F>
Program of Recommunization"] 
  [Text] One of the side effects of the Mass Privatization 
Program [PPP] will probably be good-paying jobs for the economic 
dignitaries of the Polish People's Republic [PRL], instead of 
young and well-educated people, as it was planned. 
  The first stage of the selection of the candidates for the 
members of the National Investment Funds has already been 
completed. These funds will manage a few hundred companies that 
have decided on privatization under the PPP. 
  The selection is being carried out by a commission dominated 
by people appointed by Prime Minister Pawlak. The commission 
has defined the selection criteria and has not agreed to reveal 
them. 
  As we have learned unofficially, an especially important 
factor is "long work at a managerial post." This criterion is 
met only by former heads of the socialist economy. 
  "It is not important whether a guy has led a company to 
bankruptcy or not. What is crucial is the fact that he managed 
it," we were told by a cooperator of the Selection Commission. 
"This weakens the chances of young and well-educated people." 
  "When the Law on Mass Privatization was being passed, there 
were rumors that the posts in supervisory boards would be 
occupied first of all by well-educated and young people," we 
learned from an economist linked to the commission. "However, 
the commission has worked out a code that favors people with 
strong connections with PRL companies. They simply score more 
points only because they managed the giant socialist companies." 
  We did not like such discrimination: when the citizens were 
divided into "equal" (nonpartisan) and "more equal" (members of 
the Polish United Workers Party and the satellite parties). 
  This is why we rejected decommunization ideas as contrary to 
the logic of a democratic state. Therefore, it is with utmost 
concern that we have heard about the attempt to recommunize the 
state by giving privileges to the people of the communist 
apparatus of power. 
  This is inadmissible. This must have negative consequences 
not only for the Polish economy but also for those who conceived 
these ideas.

  [Text] Tirana, April 3 (AFP) -- Former Albanian Prime 
Minister Fatos Nano was sent to jail for 12 years Sunday [3 
April] for embezzling about seven million dollars in Italian 
humanitarian aid and forgery of official documents. Under 
Albanian law, Nano faced a maximum 25-year prison term or 
capital punishment. 
  Nano, 42, refused to make any statements or answer questions 
during the trial which he said was political. Bashkim Zeneli, 
spokesman for Nano's former communist Socialist Party, said the 
sentence was "the most serious violation of democracy and 
opposition rights in Albania." The Socialists would fight for 
Nano's release, he said, adding that Nano would continue to be 
party leader even while in prison. 
  The ruling Democratic Party said Nano's activities had to be 
judged in court. Nano who was arrested in July last year was 
prime minister in February-June 1991. 
  The court heard 51 witnesses including former Communist 
Party 
officials Ramiz Alia and Adil Carcani during the trial. 
  Several co-defendants arrested on charges of graft were 
sentenced to lesser prison terms. Sokrat Plaka, a former deputy 
foreign minister, was given a one-year suspended sentence 
because of bad health, Robert Gjimi, a former deputy food 
minister, was jailed for three years and humanitarian aid expert 
Hasan Hallkja for one year. 
  Nexhmije Hoxha, the widow of Albania's post-war communist 
leader, was jailed for 11 years late last year. A warrant for 
the arrest of Alben Alia, the son of the former communist 
leader, has also been issued.

<F P=106> [Georgi Asyov commentary: "Again Traitor"] </F>
  [Text] Zhan Videnov has again accused Zhelev of all kinds 
of sins, including high treason. Indeed, this is not a very 
original claim, since after all it was the Bulgarian Socialist 
Party [BSP] and its satellites in the Fatherland Labor Party who 
announced that Zhelev was traitor of the year in 1992. Even 
this was not very original. Similar accusations against Zhelev 
had been leveled even before the Vulkanov-Vodenicharov 
presidential election campaign. Zhelev had already been declared 
a traitor in the summer of 1989, so it could be said that the 
BSP is fully utilizing the experience of Mr. Zhivkov himself. 
  There is nothing surprising in the accusations of the BSP 
leader. After all, the Presidency is the only institution in 
Bulgaria that functions to a certain extent, and its 
destabilization remains a strategic goal of the party, which 
still has members who participated in the 1963 and 1973 plenums, 
which wanted to turn us into the 16th USSR republic. 
  Videnov, and not only he, should abandon once and for all 
these efforts to silence the president. The right to express 
his opinions on various matters is not only a part of his 
presidential prerogative, it simply is a human right that every 
citizen of a democratic state has. If Zhelev is denied this 
right, the turn of Videnov and all the rest will come soon. 
  Indeed the BSP should finally understand that the existence 
of an anticommunist president has its good sides. It was the 
Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] that proved that Zhelev was 
responsible for all the evils in this world -- from the "Sliver" 
Plan [infiltrating the SDS with former communist agents] to 
increasing the price of electricity, and from the ozone hole 
above the Atlantic to the lack of fish in the rivers. If Zhelev 
did not exist, how could the BSP and all the rest account for 
their own blunders?

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Peter Boross by Pal Eotvos </F>
and Peter Vajda; place and date not given: "The Liberal Efforts 
Are Slightly Unrealistic"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [NEPSZABADSAG] Mr. Boross, 
if we look beyond the coming elections and try to think without 
considering the election results, in your opinion, what dangers 
should Hungary take into consideration? 
  [Boross] Naturally, the unfavorable economic situation could 
represent a basic danger. In addition, our domestic economy 
greatly depends on foreign developments. Irrespective of its 
causes, economic decline could have social consequences. In a 
deteriorating economic situation, one cannot calm the people by 
claiming the inevitability of such a deterioration, and the 
demands from the government in power become quite simplified. 
Of course, this is so not only in Hungary but all over Europe. 
We cannot exclude this danger either: If economic 
deterioration leads to strikes and demonstrations, there will be 
no inflow of capital. So much for the economy. I see an 
internal political danger if conditions for a coalition capable 
of forming a lasting government fail to materialize.... 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] Can we count on the creation of a really 
stable government? 
  [Boross] The obligatory pre-election optimism dictates that 
such a government could also emerge this time, after we 
succeeded in forming one four years ago. On the other hand, 
this is not certain, because a coalition made up of too many 
parties might also emerge; for example, a coalition made up of 
five parties is difficult to handle because its fate could 
depend on the smallest participant. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] How many parties could form a still workable 
coalition? What about a coalition made up of three parties? 
  [Boross] Our coalition is also made up of three parties. 
The greater the number of parties in a coalition, the more 
unstable the situation. Government ineptitude can also lead to 
danger even in the case of a stable coalition. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] Do you think of external dangers? 
  [Boross] There is no external danger threatening Hungary at 
the moment; at the same time, a certain level of political 
instability can be felt in three areas, those with Hungarian 
minority populations. There will be elections in Slovakia in 
the autumn, and we do not know what the results of these 
elections will be. A certain disadvantage is always involved 
here regarding steady contacts. Political life in Romania is 
also changing, and there is the small Yugoslavia to mention here 
too. However, in spite of all this, I do not feel a direct 
danger of events in any of these countries, events that could 
seriously threaten the situation of Hungarians. [passage 
omitted] 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] There are various views of Hungary's 
international image and the national minority issue, which is 
indivisible from relations with our neighbors. According to 
some, there is a long-term solution: Animosity will stop with 
economic prosperity, which will hopefully take place in the 
region at more or less the same time. 
  [Boross] Every country strives to present a favorable image. 
There are countries in the former Eastern bloc which do this 
more loudly than us. A certain type of rivalry is therefore 
inevitable. However, this does not have too much in common with 
our bilateral relations. Stable governments are essential for 
these contacts, because people are negotiating with people. It 
does not help if the relevant people on the other side keep 
changing. When we met in Prague, Meciar told me that we could 
solve all the problems in two hours if the two of us got 
together. And now, when we negotiate, we have to get together 
with someone else. Given that the issues also include a 
long-term solution of national minority contacts, I must mention 
that two neighboring countries received suggestions from the 
Council of Europe on membership. These suggestions are 
generally verified. [passage omitted] 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] Mr. Boross, speaking of various government 
scenarios, one can hear of the possibility of a grand coalition 
government of experts. 
  [Boross] I cannot evaluate a government of experts. My 
government has outstanding experts, and I do not know who could 
be better than us. Why would a former departmental head at the 
planning office be a better expert? 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] What about a grand coalition? Does it stand 
a chance? 
  [Boross] I do not see any chance or will for such a 
coalition. Even if the oft-mentioned elite were ready for 
something like this, they would not be able to do it because the 
party behind them would disappear. The political reality is 
that the members would not forgive the party for such an 
alliance. Therefore, this does not depend on five relatively 
wise people getting together and saying that, although they hate 
one another and make contradictory promises, they should form an 
alliance because there is trouble now. Such things only happen 
in fairy tales. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] Finland is such an example.... 
  [Boross] That is true. But such a possibility only emerges 
after two decades of democracy, after many things have been 
tested, and a political concept and view has emerged that has 
different priorities. In Hungary, the priority to win still 
prevails. [passage omitted] 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] Although there is publicity in Hungary, we 
also notice that it is not functioning. For example, Finance 
Minister Ivan Szabo announces one morning that 20 billion 
forints has disappeared from the banks. It was interesting and 
bitter to notice the lack of any public outcry and also that the 
apparatus ignored the issue. I could also mention privatization 
matters that were not dug out or stressed by the press.... Do 
you think that there is both political and moral apathy in 
Hungary? 
  [Boross] We are now following a lengthy dictatorship, and 
every country in this region is complaining about low morality. 
One should not be surprised at this, given the precedents. On 
the other hand, distorted information has played a major role in 
the emergence of concrete affairs. As interior minister, I 
submitted an internal report to the government on banking 
affairs investigated by the police: A lot of things, from 
embezzling to stupidity, can be the reason for the disappearance 
of that 20 billion forints. Ivan Szabo did not participate in 
one part of the government session and issued a statement the 
next day, and this led to the "affair." I do not know how the 
population reacted to it, but the press reacted very strongly; 
however, the various commentaries failed to mention that this 
amount only made up 1 percent of the outstanding balance of some 
2 trillion forints. [passage omitted] 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] We have heard that you are ready to 
participate in a televised debate. NEPSZABADSAG would gladly 
participate in such a debate. Are there any plans for a 
television debate? 
  [Boross] As far as I know, a televised debate with the 
participation of Orban, Peto, Horn, and Surjan will be aired on 
2 May.

<F P=106> [Sumegi report: "Assessment of Liberal Chances -- The SZDSZ </F>
Would Not Join an MSZP-Led Coalition"] 
  [Text] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] would not 
participate in a coalition in which the Hungarian Socialist 
Party [MSZP] is the leading force. We can only imagine an 
opening toward the MSZP if the SZDSZ is the dominant force of 
the coalition, SZDSZ campaign chief Balint Magyar said at the 
party's news conference on 1 April. 
  He also said that the chances of the SZDSZ forming a 
coalition with the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] are minimal. 
Magyar believes, however, that cooperation with the Christian 
Democratic People's Party [KDNP] is "worth considering and it 
can be a healthy development in a given situation." It seems to 
be natural -- and is also supported by public opinion polls -- 
that people want to vote the MDF out of government. The only 
question is whether the people will give their confidence to the 
SZDSZ or the MSZP to form the government. According to Magyar, 
it is the SZDSZ whose policy will not increase the division of 
society. Therefore, the ideal solution would be a government 
dominated by liberals, with a concentric structure. The data 
that 81 percent of people would like to see the SZDSZ as part of 
the future coalition also shows society's support for the party. 
However, in order also to find the way toward the center right 
parties and to form a broad coalition, it is necessary that the 
MSZP does not become dominant. 
  Gabor Fodor reported on the public opinion poll data 
according to which the SZDSZ is "slowly but surely" progressing 
toward its goal. According to Fodor, it is important that the 
MSZP has the largest number of sure supporters but, because of 
the characteristics of the Hungarian electoral system, the SZDSZ 
may achieve a very good result in the second round of the 
elections. It can be expected that, because the MSZP 
considerably divides society, many people will choose the SZDSZ 
in the second round because it is the least rejected party. In 
contrast to this, due to the worrying processes in the party and 
the strengthening power of the etatist trend that advocates 
redistribution by the state, the MSZP is rejected by a large 
segment of society.

<F P=106> [Article by Fazekas-Sumegi-Varju: "Parties' Expressions of </F>
Support, Condemnation"] 
  [Excerpt] In the "Sunday News" radio program, Sandor 
Lezsak, managing director of the MDF [Hungarian Democratic 
Forum], answering questions from listeners about the dismissals 
at the radio, answered that the attacks related to the 
dismissals started immediately. Critics questioned the 
qualifications of managers and editors, he continued, 
who--having taken the places of the fired persons--have not had 
a chance to prove themselves. 
  In his opinion, it is necessary to wait until the newly 
appointed editors show evidence that they are truly rendering a 
public service and consider providing unbiased information to be 
their primary task. Speaking to the reporter, he said: "I 
understand you people, you find it very difficult to work, but 
from what I've seen, work is continuing at the radio and the 
mood is good." 
  Answering a listener's question about the MDF surpassing (to 
quote verbatim) the previous government's "villainy," Lezsak 
announced that it is symbolic of the degree of press freedom 
that such statements were being made into the "Sunday News" 
program's microphones. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  The Executive Committee of the KDNP [Christian Democratic 
People's Party] judges the reduction in force, which is a 
necessary evil that seems to be inevitable for financial reasons 
and which was planned already before the system change, the same 
way that it regards the similar forced steps taken by any other 
institution. However, at other institutions workers do not have 
the possibility of representing their interests in the domestic 
and international press. The KDNP rejects the assumption that 
the dismissals were initiated by the government. It considers it 
unjustified and harmful for political parties to try to 
interfere directly in the internal affairs of the radio. In its 
opinion, the statement of the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] 
and the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats]--which noted that if 
they win the election they will rehire the fired workers--is a 
mockery of media freedom. The Christian Democrats hope that the 
time of direct party direction and intervention in the life of 
institutions has passed. "There must be no returning to the 
past!" ends the KDNP's statement. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  Limiting freedom always begins with limiting freedom of the 
press, said Alajos Dornbach at the SZDSZ's political talk show 
on Saturday, kicking off their campaign. According to the 
National Assembly vice president, the government allowed its 
vassals to take these steps. They are afraid of a leftist 
danger, and at the same time they are centralizing mass 
communication so that people will not be able to choose among 
the various parties. Ivan Peto said that the government has 
ensured that the Democratic Charter's protest, which is planned 
for 14 March, will have plenty of substance. Gabor Fodor called 
the events a blatant political cleansing. In his opinion, once 
the new government takes over, Gabor Nahlik and Laszlo Csucs 
[acting presidents of Hungarian television and Hungarian radio, 
respectively] will be out in a matter of seconds. They have 
proved themselves to be politically biased and professionally 
unsuitable, so there can be no confidence in them. He also 
brought up the government's responsibility, saying that it 
pushes ahead using Csucs and Nahlik as battering rams. At the 
news conference after the meeting, Ivan Peto expressed the 
opinion that the people who were fired had played a much bigger 
role in creating freedom of information that the people who 
fired them. He called it regrettable that journalists must be 
afraid if they or their information sources say anything 
critical of the government. He added at the same time that no 
one has ever been able to win elections by such means. "However, 
we do not want the government to help the SZDSZ's campaign to 
achieve success by such means," he added with irony. 
  The IDE [Youth Democratic Association], the SZDSZ's youth 
organization, notes with outrage the fact that political 
cleansing has taken place at the public-service Hungarian Radio.

  At a news conference over the weekend, Istvan Csurka 
expressed the opinion that the firings at the radio were an 
important step toward creating freedom of the press. According 
to the chairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MIEP), 
if this step had been taken in 1990, the country would be in a 
completely different situation. 
  Csurka also announced that with the support of 88 
organizations and parties, the Hungarian Way Circles Movement is 
organizing a friendly protest in the interest of a free 
Hungarian press on 15 March at 1400 in Szabadsag Square. 
According to him, the reason they are not holding the 
demonstration at the Petofi statue is that Lord Mayor Gabor 
Demszky simply rented the square from midnight on 15 March to 
midnight the next day. 
  The MIEP chairman dissociated himself well before the fact 
from any provocations that may occur, saying that in today's 
situation such an event can only be held amid great danger. In 
connection with the recent events at the radio, Zsolt Lanyi, 
chairman of the Budapest branch of the FKGP [Independent 
Smallholders Party], who supports the 15 March protest, 
announced that his party considers the radio to be too 
pro-government. MIEP Spokesman Bela Gyori announced that on 
Friday several people broke into Laszlo Csucs's office and, 
while he was in the government's office, they purportedly 
smeared his chair and desk with feces. According to Gyori, the 
perpetrators are known, but he was not willing to betray their 
names.

  The Agrarian Alliance considers the dismissals at the radio 
to be the newest evidence of the mockery of press freedom and of 
the grinding into the dust of nonpartisan and objective 
information. With these steps the government and the vice 
president of the radio, who has full presidential power, have 
violated their constitutional duties. For this reason the 
Agrarian Alliance calls on Prime Minister Peter Boross to 
initiate Laszlo Csucs's immediate dismissal and to ensure 
personnel measures that will regain the people's trust. 
  There is democracy in Hungary, but we will only have proof 
of 
this after the election, when it will become clear whether or 
not the political line that misuses its power suffers a failure, 
emphasized Republic Party Chairman Janos Palotas on Saturday 
evening at a citizen's forum in the country seat of Vas County. 
In his opinion, the chiefs of the national media cannot set 
their judgment above that of the nation; that is, if six or 
seven times as many listeners or television viewers want to 
listen to or watch a program than the number that do not, then 
no one can take this right from them. Those who were dismissed 
generally prepared such programs, he emphasized. 
  Speaking of the dismissals at the radio, party Chairman 
Zoltan Kiraly stated at a meeting of the MSZDP [Hungarian Social 
Democratic Party] in Komlo that when dilettantes get into 
power--and this pertains not only to the radio but also to the 
television--it is clearly their aim, and it is also in their 
interest in terms of power politics, to get rid of talented 
people who are good at their jobs. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Katalin Antaloczy: "Exports' Nosedive. A Failing </F>
Sector"] 
  [Text] Bela Kadar, minister of international economic 
relations, could not have rated Hungary's foreign trade sector a 
"success" even if he had been wearing his rosiest spectacles at 
his briefing last week. He was forced to announce that, after 
two years of continuous increases, Hungarian exports plunged 
into a nosedive in 1993. Experts had already been predicting 
that change. To a large extent the minister attributed it to the 
fact that Hungarian economic policy has not been sufficiently 
"international economy-friendly." However, a retrospective 
analysis covering the preceding years shows that the policy 
itself has not been sufficiently "economy-friendly." 
  The value of Hungary's exports last year was $8.9 billion. 
In 
comparison with 1992, that was 16.8-percent lower in terms of 
foreign exchange, and nearly 10 percent lower in terms of 
volume. At the same time the value of imports rose considerably, 
by about 13 percent overall, to a total of $12.5 billion. Thus 
the balance of trade based on statistics compiled by the Customs 
Service (it includes all goods entering and leaving Hungary) 
showed a deficit of $3.6 billion for 1993. Even after deducting 
the items not involved in commercial transactions, this burdened 
the balance of trade by about $2.3 billion. 
  Last year, then, the contradiction that had existed during 
the preceding three years between the domestic economy's rapidly 
deteriorating performance on the one hand and foreign trade's 
improving performance on the other was resolved. Between 1990 
and 1992, the shrinking economy produced increasing dollar 
earnings, despite the forced switching of markets and the 
collapse of trade with East Europe. Special domestic and 
external conditions stimulated and made possible the growth of 
exports during this period. The narrowing of the domestic and 
Eastern markets led to increased sales to developed countries; 
the boom in the West, together with the related partial opening 
of Western markets and the economic-diplomacy moves (from the 
beginning of 1990 the EC granted Hungary import preferences 
under the Generalized System of Preferences, then Hungary 
concluded a Europe Agreement with the EC and subsequently an 
association agreement with the EFTA [European Free Trade 
Association]), made those increased sales to developed countries 
possible. Ownership posed hardly any obstacle to unprofitable 
exports and the squandering of assets. 
  Parallel with switching markets, however, there was no move 
toward a more efficient and more competitive export structure. 
To the contrary, the structure of Hungarian exports took a 
definite turn for the worse in 1991 and 1992. First, the two 
commodity division (sources of energy, and materials and 
components), for the production of which conditions in Hungary 
are certainly not more favorable than elsewhere due to the 
paucity of natural resources and the capital intensity of 
production, and whose rising transportation costs to greater 
distances set rigorous constraints on the expansion of supply, 
maintained their stable share of exports at about 40 percent. 
  Furthermore, the proportion of customs processing within 
Hungarian exports rose sharply in those years in comparison with 
1990. A whole range of domestic economic players--particularly 
in light industry, but also at many engineering and chemical 
enterprises as well--had undertaken the custom processing of 
other countries' materials, primarily for German firms, to load 
their own unused capacities and to provide work for their 
employees. (In 1992, the proportion of custom processing in the 
textile and clothing industry was 90 percent of its total 
exports.) However, this activity is not very economical; it does 
not make investment possible and therefore provides no 
opportunity for advancing beyond custom processing. The market 
for custom processing strongly depends on the international 
business cycle and is characterized by ever stiffer price and 
cost competition among the countries of East Europe. Therefore 
the increase in exports based on custom processing lacked a 
solid foundation and stemmed mostly from necessity. 
  Usually the proportion of machinery exports is regarded as a 
measure of an economy's competitiveness. The proportion of 
machinery within Hungary's exports dropped significantly after 
1990; with the sharp contraction of export opportunities to 
Eastern markets, Hungary's engineering industry had only 
moderate success in marketing its low-technical products in 
developed countries. 
  Agriculture and the food industry jointly account for about 
a 
quarter of Hungary's exports. In spite of the changes underway, 
however, large volumes of standardized products, often merely of 
inferior quality, (bread grains, meat products of a low order of 
processing, and wines in bulk, for instance) remained typical 
also in the 1990's. But this export structure is too 
capital-intensive for production conditions in Hungary. Like 
custom processing, it is very sensitive to the business cycle, 
and its economic efficiency is low. 
  The roots to the decline of exports since the end of 1992 
and 
the beginning of 1993 lie in the absence of structural change. 
Uneconomical production and sales manifested themselves in 
liquidity crises among businesses, resulting in mass 
bankruptcies because of the strict regulations. The tightening 
of monetary policy as of 1992, the abolition of prefinancing for 
exports, the shortcomings in the system of export guaranties, 
and recession in the West further aggravated the economic 
players' impossible situation. Cutbacks, one of the tendencies 
necessary for structural change, accelerated from the second 
half of 1992. (In 1992, for instance, farm output fell by 22 or 
23 percent, and the food industry's output by 13 percent.) A 
significant proportion of the large exporters underwent 
transformation; a part--and in some instances all--of their 
stocks of exportable commodities disappeared. Presumably the 
economic players' exports will not cease entirely after the 
bankruptcy proceedings and liquidations, and only the 
uneconomical exports will drop out. Consequently, the decline of 
exports in 1993 was a normal development. The main question 
today is what was actually at the bottom of last year's 
processes, of the significant decline in exports and the growth 
in imports. Was the worsening of the balance of trade a natural 
symptom of the commencement of economic growth, of the 
intensification of investment activity, and hence of structural 
change? Or was it a sign of the Hungarian economy's continuing 
slump? 
  Last year the export of energy sources showed the highest 
rate of rise, nearly 30 percent (based on figures for the first 
10 months). Materials, sources of energy, and electricity 
together accounted for nearly 42 percent of Hungary's total 
exports in 1993. In relation to a very low basis of comparison, 
even machinery exports showed an increase of about 10 percent 
overall. However, that average conceals a drop of about 15 
percent in shipments to developed countries, and the near 
doubling of machinery purchases by the former socialist 
countries. (Though not evident from the statistics, it may be 
assumed that the reexportation of aircraft brought in from 
Lithuania for repairs played a substantial role in the latter's 
increase. In the classical sense, however, such repairs cannot 
be regarded as Hungarian machinery exports.) Significant 
structural changes can already be perceived behind the 
engineering industry's shrinking export sales: the exports of 
products that once were traditional export items (buses, farm 
machinery, and machine tools) are declining, while the exports 
of several new commodity groups (cars and their subassemblies, 
for instance) are rising. 
  Three commodity groups--custom processing, bread grains, and 
food-industry products--played the decisive role in export's 
sharp decline last year. They jointly accounted for 77 percent 
of the overall decline. The drastic, more than 50-percent, drop 
in the export of custom processing is not surprising on the 
basis of what has been said above, but it is the more surprising 
in the light of available statistics. To wit, the value of 
materials brought into Hungary for customs processing last year 
was the same as in 1992. Consequently, on that basis and even 
with allowances for slippages in meeting shipping schedules, 
also the value of custom processing exported in 1993 should have 
developed roughly on the same level as in 1992. As an incentive 
to undertake customs processing, the requirement to pay duty on 
consumption entries with drawback privileges was abolished as of 
1 January 1993, in response to strong pressure from the Ministry 
of International Economic Relations. By now it is already 
evident that this change in the regulations is being widely 
abused: Materials brought in duty-free for custom processing 
simply "vanish" into domestic consumption. The deep crisis in 
agriculture and the food industry played the decisive role in 
the decline of these exports. This is clearly evident from the 
fact that last year, just as in 1992, the internal confusion and 
shortages of stocks of exportable commodities in agriculture and 
the food industry prevented domestic producers from taking full 
advantage even of the export opportunities provided by our 
Europe agreement. 
  Overall, the structure of exports did not change 
significantly in 1993 as compared with its previous structure. 
For the time being, the minor changes are mostly indications of 
cutbacks. In principle, however, the sharp rise in 
imports--consisting predominantly of machinery imports--could be 
perceived as an indication of the commencement of "recovery." 
But closer examination reveals that last year's import surplus 
in machinery was mostly a one-time occurrence, and that its 
purpose was not the modernization of production. To wit, 
machinery imports included about $100 million worth of repairs 
of Lithuanian aircraft (this item in itself represents an 
increase of about $40 million over 1992), deliveries of Russian 
combat materiel to offset earlier Hungarian claims, and the two 
Boeings purchased by MALEV [Hungarian Airlines]. Increasing 
purchases of internal combustion engines further augmented 
machinery imports. The causes of these increasing purchases were 
three-fold. Environmental-friendly DAF [Van Doorn Automobile 
Factory] engines for the buses being built for the BKV [Budapest 
Transportation Enterprise] accounted for the bulk of the 
increased purchases. Furthermore, export orders for buses 
increasingly specify foreign-made engines in them. Finally, the 
development of production at the Suzuki factory is also 
increasing the import of internal combustion engines. 
  Only an extremely small part of machinery imports--slight 
increases in imports of food-industry, farm, and lumber-industry 
machinery and of communications equipment--can be linked at all 
to investment activity. Energy and material imports more closely 
associated with economic growth continued to abate in 1993. The 
significant rise in imports of petroleum products can be 
attributed to scheming in conjunction with the supply of 
household fuel oil rather than to a "kick-start" of the economy. 
From the development of imports in 1993, in other words, it is 
not yet possible to infer economic growth. 
  According to the briefing provided by the minister of 
international economic relations, the earlier unfavorable 
processes slowed down during the fourth quarter of last year. 
But the casual observer is perplexed when attempting to identify 
the cause of this improvement. Was it due to the customary 
"year-end rush," to expectations of a devaluation, or to the 
suitable grouping of the data over time? However, one thing is 
certain: The improvement definitely was not due to the 
export-incentive package plan the government adopted last 
September. That decision did not mean measures that took effect 
and made themselves felt immediately. It is safe to say that 
nothing of that plan was implemented by 31 December 1993, with 
the exception of the forint's slight devaluation which, 
incidentally, was not even included in the package plan's 
proposal. To this day the prefinancing of exports remains 
unsolved, an Eximbank has not been established, and the rate of 
corporate income tax will be reduced only as of the beginning of 
1994. 
  The indicators for 1993 still reflect economic 
hedge-hopping. 
It is indisputable that the commencement of economic growth can 
be expected only from a rise in profitable export, and that in 
its turn is closely related to the general state of the economy. 
Today the stimulation of exports cannot be imagined solely on 
the basis of economic-diplomacy or trade-policy measures, for it 
is obvious that neither agriculture and the food industry nor 
the custom processors have been able to take full advantage of 
the opportunities that the Europe agreement provided. On the 
other hand, it would be essential to conduct several 
investigations for a feasibility study of a larger-scale (real) 
devaluation of the forint that numerous economic players and 
experts have frequently been demanding. We ought to know, for 
instance, whether the forint is truly undervalued or happens to 
be overvalued. How elastic is the response of exports and 
imports to a forint devaluation. How large is the imports 
content of exports. And how does devaluation affect the price- 
and cost-competitiveness of exports, and domestic inflation. In 
other words, does forint devaluation do more good than harm. 
  In the case of a devaluation for the purpose of stimulating 
export, we should take into consideration also the fact that 
this tool helps only those who already are exporting, but it 
hardly helps new players to enter the market. The frequently 
voiced argument that a larger devaluation would enhance the 
price-competitiveness of custom processing raises the question 
as to whether Hungary could afford to enter into cutthroat 
competition with its neighbors for custom processing, to regain 
its markets on this basis, and then to continue an export that 
has no future. 
  Because of the deep structural causes underlying the decline 
of exports, it is very unlikely that even a significant change 
in the exchange rate could substantially boost the export 
volume. A growth in exports can be expected only from an 
improvement in the general state of the economy--in other words, 
only in the long run. That improvement can be brought about only 
by an economic policy that, within the framework of budgetary 
reform, reduces the burden of taxes and social-insurance 
contributions, and thereby increases the resources available for 
investment, improves enterprises' efficiency, accelerates 
privatization, aids the entry of new exporters into the market, 
and creates order in the agricultural economy. It would be 
illusory to expect rapid improvement within a short time.

<F P=106> [Article by Peter Felix: "Not Selling Like Hot Cakes"] </F>
  [Text] It is virtually impossible to rate the performance 
of the State Property Agency [AVU] to date because--in the 
absence of a real market--the value of the firms it privatizes 
can only be estimated. Our tabulation examines the present 
situation in the individual industries within the food industry 
group and establishes what has been privatized to date and what 
has yet to be privatized. 
  The AVU regards the food industry group as one of the 
success 
stories of privatization. Most of the group's 162 state or 
municipal enterprises have been transformed into corporations. 
Only 56 of them were sold by the end of 1993, but they accounted 
for 46 percent of the 162 firms' combined registered capital. It 
is practically impossible to judge whether the experts of the 
AVU handled a specific sale well or badly. After all, there is 
no basis of comparison: A developed market that could determine 
the real value of a firm is lacking. Thus the AVU is able to go 
about its business practically without any risk, and only rarely 
is it forced to admit that it goofed. 
  According to the data provided by the AVU, the net worth of 
the food industry corporations can be estimated at 157 billion 
forints. Of this amount, 72.2 billion forints worth of assets 
were sold by the end of 1993. Except in a few insignificant 
minor cases, there has been no suspicion of any corruption. This 
is the more commendable because AVU employees are exposed to 
exceptional temptation: Each chief counselor-deputy director 
prepares the privatization of assets worth billions. 
  Several basic principles for privatization within the food 
industry group had been laid down as guidelines back in 1991, 
but the indications are that the AVU is not paying much 
attention to them. Basically the decisive factor is money, 
although officials at the AVU are able to cite numerous examples 
of rejecting the highest bid. Some experts are of the opinion 
that, in most cases when it was truly "interested," foreign 
capital managed in the end to get what it wanted. 
  It may be said to be a general practice at the AVU to offer 
25 percent of the equity, plus one vote, to a specifically 
targeted large-scale agricultural producer, when a large firm is 
being privatized. But experience indicates that raw material 
producers are not really interested in acquiring such a small 
stake. Others are of the opinion that it would hardly be 
possible to devise something better than the AVU's extremely 
pragmatic approach. Admittedly, it does seem expedient in 
principle to give control of individual food-processing firms to 
groups of domestic capitalists who would be able to gain 
significant markets for both the underlying agricultural 
activity and trade. However, the managements of the 
undercapitalized and debt-ridden agricultural cooperatives and 
food industry firms respectively would be ill-suited for this 
role. Most agricultural cooperatives are glad merely to be able 
to survive; in the extremely unlikely case of being given a food 
industry firm free of charge, they would have no opportunity 
(money) to finance the firm's production. 
  In these circumstances it is no wonder that--instead of 
complying with the laid-down principles--the AVU is selling 
everything for which effective demand exists. Understandably, 
foreign capital is seeking primarily safe businesses in the 
apparently risky Hungarian market. Thus foreign capital's 
attention has focused mainly on the tobacco and distilling 
industries, whose products are taxed; on the sugar industry, 
which consists of a few players and produces a foodstuff of 
strategic economic importance; and on the vegetable-oil 
industry, primarily because earlier only one firm had been 
established in Hungary for the processing of oil seeds, and it 
enjoys an absolute monopoly to this day. For instance, five 
international corporations--Philip Morris, Austria Tabakwerke, 
RJR Nabisco, BAT [British-American Tobacco] and Reemstra--now 
own the four tobacco factories in Hungary. The better-known 
distillery firms also have attracted foreign capital. (It will 
suffice to mention Peter Zwack's purchases.) 
  The immensely keen Western interest in sugar factories is 
more difficult to explain. Indirectly, three large concerns 
share most of the market in the sugar industry: Sud 
Zucker-Agrana (21 percent); Tate Lyle-Amylum (18 percent); and 
Eridania Beghin Say (34 percent). First Hungarian Sugarmaking 
and Trading Consortium comprises 60 growers and holds the 
majority interest in five sugar factories, which enables it to 
claim 27-percent share of the market. Some people are assuming 
that this unexpected "craving for sugar" was triggered by alarm 
among the world sugar industry's multinationals over the 
Austrian Agrana's sudden appearance in Hungary, causing them to 
acquire small or substantial stakes in Hungarian corporations, 
merely to establish their presence in East Europe. The 
Hungarian sugar industry does not hold out much promise of big 
business opportunities, especially not if we consider that three 
or four of the 11 sugar factories in Hungary will have to be 
shut down in the near future because there is simply no demand 
for that much capacity. 
  Besides the sugar-industry consortium, in the entire food 
industry group there were few other examples of the AVU selling 
all the shares in a firm exclusively to Hungarian investors. 
Precedents existed primarily in the meat industry. In addition 
to Zala County Meat Corporation, the Vas County Meat Industry 
Corporation, and the Papa Meat Corporation, however, the shares 
of the Dunakeszi Refrigeration Industry Corporation, the Hajdu 
County Grain Corporation, and Vardadrink Rt., a manufacturer of 
alcoholic beverages, are also 100-percent Hungarian-owned. It is 
not surprising that the meat industry has the most domestic 
players. Processing capacity is estimated to be three times 
greater than what is actually needed, and--sooner or later--a 
significant proportion of the processing plants that are being 
offered for sale will inevitably go bankrupt. Lately, with the 
decline of export opportunities to East Europe, the significance 
of the domestic market has increased perceptibly, and there was 
relatively greater interest in acquiring equity only in those 
firms that earlier had gained significant market shares, even 
though they too are not very sound economically. Thus the shares 
of Vas County Meat sold for 105 percent of par; those of the 
Papa integrated meat plant for 165 percent; and the initial 
public offering of Pick Szeged Rt. shares on the stock market 
was likewise successful. With the exception of a few larger 
meat-industry firms--Gyula Integrated Meat Plant Corporation and 
Debrecen Meat Corporation, for instance--not much foreign 
interest can be expected in the remaining ones when they are put 
up for sale. Perhaps there might be interest in the firms that 
are wholesale meat distributors. 
  Like in the meat industry, the situation is difficult also 
in 
the dairy industry, because it too has considerable excess 
processing capacity. For the time being, foreign capital appears 
to be skimming the bargains, picking out the firms with the most 
promising markets and developed secure supplier bases. Parmalat, 
for instance, has established its headquarters in 
Szekesfehervar, by acquiring Fejer County Dairy Corporation. In 
the dairy industry, including also the successors of the former 
dairy industry enterprises, the AVU had earmarked 48 firms for 
privatization. It sold 21 of these firms by December 1993, and 
will put another 21 on the block in the first half of 1994. At 
present, 21 players share the dairy market. Up to the end of 
1993, privatization brought 1.5 billion forints of additional 
capital into the industry. The monopoly of Budapesti Tejipari 
Vallalat (Budapest Dairy Industry Enterprise) has gradually 
weakened during the past two years, and today several provincial 
dairy firms also have significant shares of the capital's 
market. According to experts, really harsh measures have yet to 
come in the dairy industry. The trimming of surplus capacities 
will become inevitable in 1994. That will be accompanied by a 
substantial rise in unemployment in some regions. 
  The situation is ambiguous also in conjunction with 
privatization in the grain industry. Originally the grain 
industry comprised 20 county grain-trading and flour-milling 
enterprise (GMV's), and a number of firms servicing them. The 
GMV's operated 117 flour mills, 67 feed-mixing plants, and 181 
separate granaries. In March 1993, the AVU board of directors 
approved a detailed plan for the grain industry's privatization. 
On its basis, 71 flour mills, 36 feed-mixing plants, and 154 
separate granaries were earmarked for decentralized 
privatization. According to a summary report prepared in 
mid-January, 48 flour mills but only 14 feed-mixing plants and 
29 separate granaries have been privatized so far. The AVU 
attributes the conspicuously meager interest in the feed-mixing 
plants and granaries to the drought and the livestock 
population's decline. 
  By the end of last year, 15 of the 20 GMV's had been 
transformed into corporations, and the one in Veszprem County is 
in liquidation and is expected to be wound up by June 1994. 
However, only two of the transformed GMV's have been sold so 
far. The shares of Hajdu County Grain Corporation were bought by 
its MRP [Employee Stock Ownership Program] organization; and the 
state's stake in Hungarograin Rt., into which the Komarom County 
GMV had been transformed, was bought by a consortium comprising 
the MRP organization and a Hungarian company. In the opinion of 
the AVU, future foreign interest can be expected only in Cerbona 
Rt. It is hoped that domestic investors will buy the remaining 
firms, if there is effective demand for them. In the near future 
the AVU intends to make initial public offerings of the shares 
of three companies: Alfold Grain Corporation, South 
Transdanubian Grain Industry Corporation, and Pannonian Grain 
Corporation. 
  There seems to be hardly any foreign interest in the state 
baking industry, with the sole refreshing exception of Danube 
Bread Corporation. The AVU does not even know how many players 
there are in the market, because the number of private firms in 
the baking industry has increased dynamically since 1991. It is 
estimated that at present the private firms jointly have 
approximately a 60-percent share of the market and account for 
55 percent of the industry's total capacity. At the commencement 
of privatization, incidentally, there were 37 enterprises in the 
baking industry, and 19 of them were assigned to the so-called 
program of self-privatization [enterprise-initiated 
privatization]. Mainly the firms with smaller capacities were 
assigned there, while the privatization of the 18 larger 
corporations is being handled by the AVU itself. So far the 
success of the AVU's efforts has been very modest: Only four 
firms had been privatized by the end of 1993. 
  Of the nine refrigeration-industry corporations in which the 
state holds a majority interest, only six have been privatized. 
The investors include the multinationals Unilever and Shamrock; 
domestic entrepreneurs own the refrigeration plants in Gyor and 
Dunakeszi; while the refrigeration plant in Szekesfehervar has 
been purchased, for compensation bonds, jointly by individuals 
and legal entities. It is undeniable that the 
refrigeration-industry firms, which earlier had enjoyed a 
monopoly, have lately been forced to compete both on the 
domestic and the foreign markets. On the basis of the earlier 
invitations to tender, the AVU estimates that the refrigeration 
industry will attract nearly 1 billion forints of foreign direct 
investment in 1994. As a result of this among others, the AVU 
believes that export earnings this year could reach as high as 
$70 million, after last year's very modest export of $30 million. 
  In professional circles opinions are divided about the pace 
of privatization within the food industry group, just as they 
are about the pace of privatization in general. Many people find 
it amazing that the AVU has at all been able to sell so many 
firms in financial straits. Others believe that the AVU is 
following the path of least resistance, selling off assets on 
the principle of "let us be glad we have a buyer," instead of 
privatizing individual industries on the basis of comprehensive 
conceptual plans. The future will determine who was right on 
this issue. In any case, practically every political party has 
already announced that, once it came to power, it would 
investigate the earlier practice of privatization within the 
food-industry group.

  [Editorial Report] As Hungary goes through its difficult 
transition, tourism in 1993 failed to fulfill the government's 
prediction that it would become the "pace-setting" economic 
sector and would compensate for weaknesses in other parts of the 
economy, the prominent weekly HETI VILAGGAZDASAG (HVG) asserts 
in an unattributed article entitled "Tourism Assessment: Double 
or This Much" in its 19 March issue. Recent statistical data 
suggest that the National Tourism Office was under some kind of 
"illusion" when it predicted last year that tourism would 
increase significantly and that its contribution to the 
GDP--currently 8-9 percent, the same as that of the agricultural 
sector--would "double" by the year 2000, HVG asserts. 
  The apparent surge in tourism in 1993 is misleading, HVG 
says. While 41 million foreigners entered Hungary in 1993, 7 
million more than in the previous year, more than half of the 
total did not enter the country for tourism but for economic, 
political, or "existential" purposes, and almost half of the 
total number just "dashed" across the border for one day. HVG 
indicates that a "significant" number of the foreigners entering 
Hungary came from countries whose citizens are unlikely to have 
much spending power. More than half of the total came from 
Romania or the former Yugoslavia, while the number of visitorse 
arriving from the former Soviet Union more than doubled in 1993, 
to 2.7 million. There was "no significant change" in the number 
of visitors arriving from Western countries, HVG notes, although 
visitors from the united Germany increased by 23 percent in 1993 
after having declined the previous year. 
  Underlining its contention that foreigners coming to Hungary 
have not become the economic resource that Hungarians had 
expected, HVG illustrates the article with a picture of 
backpacking young people lying on the floor in a Budapest 
railroad station. The caption reads: "Resting in the station: 
Many come, but they spend little." 
  The article suggests at the same time that the picture is 
mixed. The 144 million nights that foreigners spent in Hungary 
in 1993 represented a 37-percent increase over the year before, 
and the average length of time spent in the country grew from 
5.2 nights to 6.3 nights. Those spending the longest time came 
from northern Europe and North America. While there appears to 
have been a 25-percent decline in the overall receipts of the 
tourism sector, HVG notes that the data may be misleading since 
it does not reflect the "presumable growth" in "black market" 
accommodations, which remain unreported by those who want to 
avoid taxes.

  [Text] Slobodan Milosevic, president of the Republic of 
Serbia, is in our country for a one-day visit. About one hour 
ago, the first round of talks between Presidents Slobodan 
Milosevic and Ion Iliescu, which was attended by members of the 
two delegations, ended at Cotroceni Palace [presidential 
headquarters]. 
  They approached various aspects of bilateral relations, the 
current stage of the peace negotiations on former Yugoslavia, 
and aspects of their finalization. They emphasized the good 
relations between Romania and Serbia and the two countries' 
actions toward instilling a climate of peace and security in the 
Balkans and achieving multilateral cooperation after the 
peaceful settlement of the conflicts in the region. 
  Our correspondent reported that the talks between the two 
presidents are to continue through a working lunch and in the 
afternoon at Cotroceni Palace. 
  About 40 minutes ago, President Slobodan Milosevic laid a 
wreath at the monument to the unknown hero in Carol Park, after 
which he held talks with Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. 
  President Milosevic's schedule also includes a meeting with 
representatives of the ethnic Serbs living in Romania and a 
joint news conference to be held with the Romanian president. 
  At 1600 Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu is to 
hold 
separate talks with his Yugoslav counterpart, Vladislav 
Jovanovic.

  [Text] Bucharest, April 5 (AFP) -- Romanian Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu said Tuesday that he hoped Serbia 
would make an effort in peace negotiations on Bosnia and in turn 
be rewarded with lighter sanctions. President Slobodan 
Milosevic and Foreign Affairs Minister Vladislav Jovanovic of 
Serbia were on an official visit to Romania Tuesday. 
  In an interview with AFP, Melescanu said: "The Serbs can not 
and must not stay outside of the peace process." He referred to 
the recent accord forming a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia 
which the Serbs refused to join. 
  He said that if the Serbs agreed to form some kind of 
relationship with the new federation, sanctions imposed on rump 
Yugoslavia should be eased. "The goal of the embargo is not to 
create useless suffering but to encourage a peaceful solution to 
the conflict," he said. "One must use the carrot as well as the 
stick." 
  He said Bucharest has a direct interest in a peaceful end to 
the conflict. Romania has lost nearly seven billion dollars in 
trade since the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro began 
two years ago.

  [Text] Today, at Villa Lac-2, Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic held talks with Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu. The talks were attended by the ambassador of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] to Bucharest. 
  A press release that was faxed to us a short while ago says 
that during their talks President Slobodan Milosevic -- after 
outlining the high level reached in bilateral relations before 
the introduction of economic sanctions against the FRY -- 
expressed his conviction that those sanctions will soon be 
lifted because, considering the recent evolution of the 
political situation in that area, they are no longer justified. 
Anticipating that moment, impatiently looked forward to not only 
by Serbia but also by its neighbors, who are severely affected 
by the embargo imposed by the international community, it is 
necessary that ways of cultural, scientific, and educational 
cooperation should be examined now, whereas after the partial or 
total lifting of the sanctions cooperation between Serbia and 
Romania should also be extended to industry, investments, 
finance, and commerce, so that within a short time the level of 
bilateral exchanges should equal or surpass the previous levels, 
the guest stressed. 
  In turn, Vacaroiu pointed out that Romania has strictly 
observed the international embargo imposed on the FRY but it 
also consequently acted by intervening at international fora for 
the reduction of the level of those sanctions, especially 
considering recent political evolutions that give reason to hope 
for the peaceful settlement of the conflicts that broke out out 
with the dismembering of the former Yugoslav Federation. The 
consequences of the embargo were drastic for Romania as well, 
especially because they came in addition to the difficulties 
emerged in the process of economic reform and industrial 
restructuring currently under way in our country. A number of 
enterprises, the Romanian prime minister emphasized, which used 
to work in cooperation with Serbian firms had to suspend their 
activity, which accentuated the decline of our industrial 
production and amplified unemployment. 
  During their meeting, the parties agreed to examine, at the 
level of a joint commission, possibilities of resuming, as soon 
as possible, bilateral economic and commercial relations, once 
the level of the international sanctions imposed on the FRY is 
diminished or the sanctions are totally lifted.

<F P=106> [Statement by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic at a news </F>
conference in Bucharest on 5 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] In brief, our mutual relations could be described 
as very good, I would even say excellent, but we still expect 
them to continually and constantly improve. There are many 
mutual interests, as well as numerous reasons for that. A few 
minutes ago President Iliescu mentioned some figures. These are 
our joint modest estimates of the possibilities for developing 
our cooperation. This is why it is absurd that presently we 
cannot realize much of that and improve the standard of living 
and our economies, because of the administrative measures and 
sanctions that represent an anachronism at the end of the 20th 
century, and which were unfortunately imposed by the countries 
that consider themselves to be more cultured and more civilized. 
  However, I am convinced that life itself will bring down 
such 
an approach, which is not civilized and which runs counter to 
the basic laws of the modern world that is integrating and 
uniting itself, the world that is permeating itself. In other 
words, the world that is opposite to these processes will have 
to go where it belongs, into the inglorious past, and I hope, 
will do so very quickly. 
  In any case, I am sure that regarding our country and 
friendly Romania, both sides will maximally contribute to this. 
There is no doubt, and this is something we jointly concluded 
today, that good mutual relations between our two countries 
represent an important factor of stability in this region. We 
rate our mutual cooperation very highly. We rate very highly 
the objective approach by Romania and President Iliescu to the 
problems of the Yugoslav crisis and believe that there is every 
reason for our cooperation in future to only improve and 
increase in the interest of both peoples and both countries. 
  We are very satisfied with everything we heard and saw and 
we 
are convinced in the success of our mutual cooperation.

<F P=106> [Report on a news conference by Serbian President Slobodan </F>
Milosevic and Romanian President Ion Iliescu in Bucharest on 5 
April; from the "Aktuelnosti" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Milosevic] My associates and 
I are very pleased to have had the opportunity to visit 
Bucharest today, to visit the capital city of Romania with which 
we are linked with long historical friendship and many joint 
interests. The very fact that the Serbs and the Romanians have 
never fought a war and that they have always had very good 
relations would be insufficient to describe the content of our 
wishes for the future, because what we expect from the 
development of our cooperation in the future, I hope will exceed 
by far our mutual very friendly and very good relations so far. 
  The focus of our talks was, therefore, bilateral relations 
and I could say that there is literally not a single sphere of 
activity on which we did not agree regarding our future 
cooperation. 
  In brief, our mutual relations could be described as very 
good, I would even say excellent, but we still expect them to 
continually and constantly improve. There are many mutual 
interests, as well as numerous reasons for that. A few minutes 
ago, President Iliescu mentioned some figures. These are our 
joint modest estimates of the possibilities for developing our 
cooperation. This is why it is absurd that presently we cannot 
realize much of that and improve the standard of living and our 
economies, because of the administrative measures and sanctions 
that represent an anachronism at the end of the 20th century, 
and which were unfortunately imposed by the countries that 
consider themselves to be more cultured and more civilized. 
  However, I am convinced that life itself will bring down 
such 
an approach, which is not civilized and which runs counter to 
the basic laws of the modern world that is integrating and 
uniting itself, the world that is permeating itself. In other 
words, the world that is opposite to these processes will have 
to go where it belongs, into the inglorious past, and I hope, 
will do so very quickly. 
  In any case, I am sure that regarding our country and 
friendly Romania, both sides will maximally contribute to this. 
There is no doubt, and this is something we jointly concluded 
today, that good mutual relations between our two countries 
represent an important factor of stability in this region. We 
rate our mutual cooperation very highly. We rate very highly 
the objective approach by Romania and President Iliescu to the 
problems of the Yugoslav crisis and believe that there is every 
reason for our cooperation in future to only improve and 
increase in the interest of both peoples and both countries, and 
in the interest of this part of Europe. 
  We will leave Bucharest very satisfied with everything we 
heard and saw and we are convinced of the success of our mutual 
cooperation. [passage omitted on Iliescu answering a question on 
the founding of the Yugoslav-Romanian Friendship Society] 
  [Predal, in Romanian with passage-by-passage translation 
into 
Serbo-Croatian] Bogdan Predal of ASSOCIATED PRESS. Mr. 
President, there are some speculations in the international 
press that the regular army of Yugoslavia is operating around 
Gorazde. Could you confirm these reports? 
  [Milosevic] There are, of course, no Yugoslav army members 
outside the territory of Yugoslavia. The UN officials on the 
ground know that. However, the problem of Gorazde raises 
another question. We are undoubtedly talking about a fierce 
offensive by the Muslim forces from the so-called protected 
zone, which, according to the very definition of a protected 
zone, should be demilitarized. 
  Therefore, one should raise a question of how this was 
possible at all, and whether it will finally become clear as to 
who is currently carrying out this offensive, and with what aim. 
Therefore, your question was well formulated when you said that 
there are some speculations. It is therefore correct that we 
are taking about speculations and not facts. [passage omitted] 
  Regarding the question that was addressed to me, there is no 
doubt that the stands taken toward the Yugoslav crisis have 
seriously compromised the system of the United Nations and the 
international community, because the UN Charter itself obliges 
the United Nations to preserve the integrity of its 
member-states. In the case of Yugoslavia, and especially when 
it introduced the sanctions, the United Nations in fact acted in 
the opposite direction. It encouraged disintegration and 
secession, and punished and attacked those who wanted to 
preserve and save their country. 
  The United Nations went even further than that. I think that 
one of the absurdities at the end of the 20th century will be 
the fact that a nation was accused of aggression on its own 
country. Therefore, one should not look for any logic, since 
there is no logic here. Everything that has been done was 
exclusively done according to the rule of the stronger. 
  Peace will be established when the international community 
adopts the same, or at least an approximately equal stand toward 
all sides in the conflict, and when it at least modestly moves 
toward its main declared principle of non-partiality. As far as 
we are concerned, it would have been best if they had never 
gotten involved in it at all, because this involvement only 
harmed us. 
  Regarding the direct question as to whether Romania is 
contributing to the improvement of this situation, my answer is 
affirmative. 
  [Rodin, in Romanian with passage-by-passage translation into 
Serbo-Croatian] Michaela Rodin of AGENCE FRANCE-PRESS. Mr. 
Milosevic, were you prepared to support the agreement between 
the Muslims and the Croats, and would the Serbs join the 
federation? 
  [Milosevic] A country's constitution and its setup are 
considered to be an expression of sovereignty of a nation in all 
countries. I personally do not believe much in the future of 
the creations nor constitutions that are imposed from outside. 
However, as far as I am personally concerned, I wish them all 
the luck. 
  Regarding the Serbian people, they have gotten used to 
writing their own constitutions in the past and to decide on 
their own fate, and this will remain the case. We are a free 
people and this is the greatest value that we place before all 
other values.

  [Text] The last point in the program of the visit that 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic made Bucharest was the 
meeting of the two heads of state with representatives of the 
mass media at Cotroceni Palace. 
  The two heads of state, Ion Iliescu and Slobodan Milosevic, 
stressed the fact that this summit visit is a significant 
political event in the traditional bilateral relations and a 
constructive factor in promoting a favorable climate for the 
establishment of stability in the area. 
  President Slobodan Milosevic expressed his particular 
satisfaction with the results of the visit and said that the 
viewpoints expressed on this occasion were quite close and they 
proved a mutual understanding of bilateral and international 
issues that are of great interest to both sides. 
  Likewise, the sides recalled the efforts made by the two 
countries to support and stimulate the peace process in the area 
of the former Yugoslavia. 
  President Ion Iliescu said that the only way to emerge from 
the current situation of conflict is through peaceful political 
means and not by resorting to the application of forceful 
measures. 
  In turn, President Slobodan Milosevic positively stressed 
the 
role played by Romania in developing relations in the region, 
commending the objective way in which our country approached the 
current situation. 
  The sides recalled the efforts made by the two countries to 
return to normal bilateral relations after the sanctions imposed 
on Yugoslavia by the UN Security Council are lifted and the 
conflict in the area is extinguished. 
  Answering a question asked by a journalist, the Serb 
President categorically denied the involvement of regular Serb 
troops in the conflict in Bosnia, however, he accused the 
Muslims of an offensive against the Serbs in the area. 
Referring to the recent establishment of the federation of 
Croatians and Muslims in Bosnia, President Milosevic declared 
that it is important that this federation should not harm the 
interests of the Serb side, which is in no way engaged in its 
operation. 
  At around 1900 the Yugoslav guest left for Belgrade.

  [Text] Bucharest, April 5 (AFP) -- Romanian Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu said Tuesday it was unacceptable that 
Russia should billet peacekeeping troops in former Soviet 
republics that are now independent states. 
  In an interview with AFP, Melescanu said Russian 
peacekeeping 
operations should be carried out only in accordance with the 
United Nations and the countries involved. "The presence of 
Russian military forces in countries that have declared their 
independence is a principle that we cannot accept," he said. 
  Russian troops are stationed in neighboring Moldova where 
separatists of Russian origin have declared a republic. Romania 
has historic and cultural ties with Moldova. Most of Moldova 
belonged to Romania until the area was annexed by the former 
Soviet Union in the 1939 peace pact between Stalin and Hitler. 
  "We understand Russia's worry about the Russian minorities 
that live in former Soviet republics. But for their protection, 
European diplomatic mechanisms must be emphasized instead of 
military means," Melescanu said. 
  There is to be a summit meeting between Russian and Romania 
later this year.

  [Excerpts] The quiet political scene last weekend was 
stirred a bit by the report that the Slovak National Party [SNS] 
deputy chairman Juraj Molnar delivered a speech at the World 
Congress of Slav Orthodox and Christian Nations in Moscow. 
According to SNS chairman Jan Slota, Juraj Molnar left for 
Moscow as an observer with the consent of the party leadership 
but was not authorized to deliver any message. According to Jan 
Slota, the SNS did not establish any contacts with the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia and does not intend to do so in the 
future. Our correspondent Vladimir Lach tried to find out more 
about the whole affair. Jan Slota, chairman of the SNS, told 
him the following, among other things: 
  [Begin recording] [Slota] The leadership of the party did 
not 
know that a congress of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
was being organized in Moscow, and, therefore, I will not 
comment on this; for me, it is completely unfounded. I also 
find the comments of Messrs. Bugar [Hungarian Christian 
Democratic Party chairman], Hagyari [chairman of the Party of 
Conservative Democrats], Duris [Republican Party chairman], and 
Mrs. Borzova [deputy chairwoman of the Party of the Democratic 
Left], for example, totally inappropriate and stupid because 
they are not verified. For example, Mr. Bugar said that Juraj 
Molnar delivered a speech at the congress of the Liberal 
Democratic Party. The truth is that the deputy chairman was not 
even there. So I suggest that, before making any comments, 
people check whether the report is first true. 
  [Lach] Mr. Chairman, do you know the whole text of Mr. 
Molnar's message of greetings to the world congress? 
  [Slota] Molnar said altogether five sentences at the 
congress. He simply said that all of the Slav nations should 
unite, and, in particular, the small Slav nations should be 
protected by the Pan-Slavic group of nations. At the end, he 
said, of course, that, without great Russia, the Slav nation as 
such would not exist. I am convinced about this. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Lach] In this connection, I cannot resist asking about your 
opinion. It is known that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy should come for 
a private visit to Slovakia on 16-19 April. We know that many 
countries expelled him. What is your view about Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy's visit because there is talk that the SNS--now I 
will exaggerate--is responsible for it. 
  [Slota] All I can say about this is that it is just as new 
for me as it is for you that Mr. Zhirinovskiy is supposed to be 
here between 16 and 19 April. I can unequivocally say that 
neither our deputy chairman nor the SNS has anything to do with 
the visit. I do not know who invited him privately. I 
personally think that, because we are such a democratic country, 
as everyone keeps saying--at the moment we have the most 
democratic government ever--I do not see any reason that we 
should be taken aback by the fact that Mr. Zhirinovskiy will 
come for a private visit to Slovakia. It can happen, for 
instance, that, in democratic elections, Mr. Zhirinovskiy will 
be elected president of Russia. I am not quite sure whether, if 
the new president wanted to visit Slovakia, we would be taken 
aback by that as well. I can only be surprised. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Bratislava--According to a representative 
public-opinion survey carried out by the Focus Agency--the 
Center for Social and Marketing Analysis--33.9 percent of 
respondents definitely agree with the dismissal of Prime 
Minister Vladimir Meciar. Between 16 and 23 March, 1,066 
respondents were asked their view of the dismissal of Prime 
Minister Vladimir Meciar by the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic. Another 17.5 percent "rather agree," 16.4 percent 
"rather disagree," 24.3 percent "definitely disagree" with the 
dismissal, and 7.8 percent of respondents are unable to assess 
the situation. The Focus Agency made the results of the survey 
available to our editorial office yesterday.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Peter Schutz: "For the Time Being, Meciar </F>
Stays"] 
  [Text] The government of Vladimir Meciar, which is 
criticized, damned, and cursed from all sides, can continue to 
govern Slovakia in a formal manner. However, it will be 
government in quotation marks. That is to say, last week, 
parliament, where the anti-Meciar opposition holds a majority, 
took a portion of power into its own hands. In other words, as 
of last week, Slovakia does not have a government that could 
fully carry out its functions. This somewhat bizarre situation 
came into being as the result of two "specifics" of Slovak 
politics--the absence of the term resignation in the political 
vocabulary of today's power elite, and the lack of readiness or, 
rather, the inability on the part of the opposition to take on 
the responsibility for directing the state. Its hesitation is 
more surprising because, in one breath and with unprecedented 
sharpness, it speaks of the "catastrophic consequences of 
Meciar's governing" and of the need to prevent "the further 
devastation of the country." 
  The political crisis began at the beginning of February, 
when 
the government coalition of the HZDS-SNS [Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia--Slovak National Party] made use of a 
parliamentary filibuster to defeat discussion of an amendment of 
the law on large-scale privatization (the dispute involved the 
personnel connections between the executive and the National 
Property Fund). The coalition decided to take this step at the 
moment the Cernak faction within the SNS notified the coalition 
that it was canceling its allegiance and when this move resulted 
in balancing the ratio of forces within the National Council at 
75:75. However, as early as the subsequent termination of the 
meeting of delegates, it was clear that, as long as the ratio of 
forces did not change, there was the threat of the total 
paralysis of the legislative power. This was obviously realized 
by Josef Moravcik, minister of foreign affairs, and Roman Kovac, 
deputy prime minister, under whose patronage the Political 
Realism Alternative (Alternativa politickeho realismu) 
parliamentary faction came into being within the HZDS. 
  The parliamentary session that was resumed last week 
confirmed the new distribution of forces. The "Alternative" 
faction joined the opposition, and the delegates adopted the 
amendment in the form in which it was being asserted by the 
opposition. (In practice, this means sidelining the prime 
minister from the National Property Fund.) But the subsequent 
step--the fall of the Meciar cabinet--did not take place. The 
necessity to agree on a date for early elections (the coalition 
was proposing June, the opposition suggested November) turned 
out to be the prerequisite for the declaration of no confidence. 
And shortening election time through parliamentary maneuvering 
requires a three-fifths majority (90 votes), and even two 
attempts to put such a majority together failed (the first 
attempt fell short by 21 votes, the second by seven). 
  The fact that both the opposition and the coalition agree on 
the necessity for calling early elections and, at the same time, 
cannot agree on such a secondary matter as the date for these 
elections is somewhat absurd. Logically, the question thus 
arises as to whether the common desire for early elections may 
not be just a mere pacifier of sorts. It is clear that the 
dispute over "June versus November" is a pseudoproblem, at least 
from the side of the opposition. The argument that June is not a 
suitable date for elections because "the political scene must 
become crystallized so that the parties can prepare their 
programs" and that the "transitional government requires time to 
stabilize the country" is, on the face of it, a proclamation 
regarding the harmfulness of the continued functioning of 
Meciar, which is not trustworthy. After all, anyone who takes 
the words regarding the continuing "devastation of the country" 
seriously is attempting to remove the government from power as 
quickly as possible. Vladimir Meciar is correct when he says 
that the crisis needs to be resolved immediately. The problem of 
present-day Slovakia actually lies elsewhere than in the 
deadline for early elections. It lies in the fact that the 
opposition continues unable to agree on the most substantive 
matter--on the decision to resolve the situation by making a 
radical cut. 
  Today, the anti-Meciar opposition is divided approximately 
into three camps--the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], the 
Hungarian parties, and the remainder around Carnogursky's KDH 
[Christian Democratic Movement]. Of course, the keys to further 
development are only in the hands of the Weiss former communist 
SDL. This party was the first to insist that a vote of no 
confidence in the government be preceded by a call for early 
elections and is currently holding its opposition colleagues 
under tension through bilateral discussions with Meciar. 
Although Weiss is rejecting Meciar's coalition offers, this is 
amply sufficient for purposes of disintegrating the opposition. 
Even in the face of efforts to outwardly maintain the appearance 
of unity, Ivan Simko, deputy chairman of the KDH, precisely 
characterized this situation on Friday: "The situation is 
obtuse, particularly thanks to the fact that the SDL is gambling 
on all parties. And that is what is decisive at this moment." 
  As far as Meciar's tactics are concerned, his gamble on 
early 
elections is, at the present moment, relatively trustworthy. 
This week, he is beginning to collect signatures of citizens to 
a petition demanding the announcement of a referendum on early 
elections. In the tradition of his populism, however, he wants 
the referendum to include two additional items: Citizens are to 
decide to deprive those delegates who have changed their 
political uniforms since the election of their mandate and to 
compel adoption of a law proving the source of money involved in 
privatization. If Meciar collects the necessary 350,000 
signatures--and this is a certainty--the president will have to 
announce a referendum involving all three of these topics within 
30 days. 
  The Hamlet-type questions besetting present-day Slovakia 
thus 
lie elsewhere than in the date for early elections. Even in the 
face of everything that is occurring in the country, has the 
time already arrived for recalling the Meciar cabinet? And can 
early elections in the foreseeable future bring an actual 
alternative to the government of the HZDS to the leadership of 
the state; can these elections mean a true turnaround? 
Understandably, an unequivocal response to the first question 
does not exist. It does exist with respect to the second 
question: The answer is no. 
  Arguments for the end of the "broad-gauge" Meciar government 
are serious and generally well known, and would be sufficient 
for a separate article. Meciar is a permanent threat to 
democratic development in the country, a threat that need not 
come about, but its very existence is a sufficiently momentous 
reason. On the other hand, it is true that Meciar continues to 
enjoy the confidence of one-fifth of the population. And so, 
even if he were to be removed from the prime minister's position 
in the foreseeable future, the new elections cannot prevent the 
HZDS from returning to power. Moreover, it is certain that, 
should Meciar enter the election campaign from the opposition 
end, the preference for his movement would again increase. In a 
highly likely preelection coalition with the Klepac Christian 
Socialists and the "Andel-Prokes" portion of the SNS, he will 
most likely obtain 30 percent of the votes. However, even if he 
were to obtain fewer votes--the count will surely not be lower 
than 20 percent--the only realistic possibility would be a 
government coalition between the HZDS and the SDL anyway. 
Anything else is out of the question. 
  Although the advent of the refined "Weiss boys" will serve 
to 
improve the overall impression of an old-new government team, 
that government team is aiming its policy still further toward 
the left. (While today Toth, minister of finance, is barely 
adhering to the recommendations of the International Monetary 
Fund and is thus at least holding inflation under control, it is 
likely that, in an HZDS-SDL coalition, this practice would come 
to naught.) The notion that Weiss will wish to avoid a coalition 
with Meciar--which would be politically difficult or even 
impossible--and would form a common bloc with the other parties 
is also not overly encouraging. Additional early elections would 
be only a matter of time. 
  Optimists will surely object to this somewhat catastrophic 
scenario by stating that there still remain some 50 percent of 
the people who do not want to go to the polls today and whose 
votes could change everything. But this is only a hope. A part 
of those who are undecided will certainly not vote, and the 
remainder, as is shown by experiences involving "nonvoters" in 
other countries, will divide their votes evenly between the 
strongest parties. 
  The future of Slovakia lies fully in the hands of the Slovak 
voter. Unfortunately, all public opinion polls conducted thus 
far and the analyses derived from them signal the fact that 
whether early elections are held in June or in November is 
completely immaterial. Therefore, for the time being, it is 
premature to expect not only fundamental but even partial 
changes in the situation as it exists today. Early elections in 
Slovakia will truly be premature.

  According to the chairman of the Israeli committee, the 
Knesset is informed every month about the activity of the

interested in the change of the structure of our Army. Chairman 
of the Committee Vladimir Suman said about this, among other 
things, that the reason for the existence of the Czech Army is 
the uncertain development in the countries of the former USSR, 
organized crime, and aggressive nationalism, especially on the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Article by Milos Sklenka: "COCOM as a Symbol of </F>
Confrontation Has Ceased To Exist"] 
  [Excerpt] The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral 
Export Controls, known as COCOM, was dissolved with final 
validity yesterday. This happened on the basis of a decision by 
all 17 member states of this international institution, made at 
The Hague in the Netherlands last November and confirmed in 
Amsterdam on Wednesday [30 March]. 
  A new organization to replace COCOM is to be set up in the 
very near future. It should no longer be open only to advanced 
Western countries but also to many states of Central and East 
Europe and the Third World. 
  "The Czech Republic [CR] is interested in participating 
actively in the work of the COCOM successor organization," 
Bretislav Gregr, director of the Special Materials Department 
operating under the Licensing Administration of the Ministry of 
Industry and Trade of the CR, told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY yesterday. 
As Gregr went on to say, our government is already engaged in a 
number of negotiations in this matter. According to Gregr, the 
termination of COCOM's existence definitely does not mean the 
abolition of [export] control regimes in industrially advanced 
countries. It means only the abolition of the existing 
institutional structure of this organization. [passage omitted] 
  The new organization, the establishment of which is foreseen 
for the beginning of next year, should associate all the member 
countries of the former COCOM, plus Austria, Ireland, New 
Zealand, and Switzerland. The admission of additional states, 
including Russia, China, the CR, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland, 
is planned in the future. 
  According to representatives of the former COCOM, the speed 
of the integration of these states will depend on the progress 
of their domestic legislation, which must provide safeguards 
against advanced Western technologies being misused. In 
contrast to COCOM practices, one no longer counts on the 
drafting of lists with embargoed goods or banned export 
territories.

<F P=106> [Article by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus: "A Few Words About </F>
the Convertibility of the Czech Koruna"] 
  [Text] The convertibility of the Czech koruna has become 
one of the most topical political issues in the past few weeks. 
This topic has appeared rather unexpectedly, and, according to 
our habits acquired in the post-November era, it has become a 
political topic. 
  Its real content has evaporated, and a completely wrong and 
misleading political viewpoint has been created instead: 
Whoever is in favor of full convertibility is a liberal--that 
is, a proreformist politician--and whoever is asking what is the 
proper moment and manner of the introduction of full 
convertibility and who warns against simplification is a 
politician who has abandoned his liberal faith and has become 
someone who is curbing the progress. 
  I would like to show that the convertibility problem is not 
so simple. I am not going to present delicate textbook 
definitions regarding the convertibility of currency. Neither 
am I going to deal with the problem that is irrelevant to our 
discussion today--that is, should the yearly limit on foreign 
currency purchases by Czech citizens be increased or lifted 
altogether? This is a completely different matter. 
  I believe that no one who has been engaged in this 
discussion 
is questioning the fact that it is economically advantageous to 
have: 
  --an independent and autonomous monetary policy that 
respects 
economic objectives; 
  --a fixed currency exchange rate, which is a starting point 
for making our economy strong and that is also a comprehensible 
signal to all domestic and foreign economic entities as regards 
our economic policy in the future; 
  --a liberal flow of international capital (that is, the 
koruna's full convertibility), which would complete our 
integration into the world economy, and which is a 
transformation step to follow after the koruna's "internal 
convertibility" was introduced and foreign trade flows 
liberalized on 1 January 1991. 
  It is not a problem to achieve one of the three goals--or 
two 
at a time-- but the problem is to achieve all three 
simultaneously. M. Goldstein and J.A. Frenkel said in their 
influential article in 1988: "The best thing to do is to 
achieve two of the three objectives. When there is a debate 
about monetary reform, the issue always is which of the two 
objectives should be opted for." I would be very happy if we 
discussed this problem rationally in our country right now. 
  From my viewpoint, I would like to say the following on this 
subject: 
  There are countries whose specific situation makes them 
indifferent toward the loss of the autonomy of their monetary 
policy. They are countries that are not undergoing any specific 
moment in their economic development. They are sorting out only 
"current and normal" problems, and, because of that, they can 
take the same course of action as their neighbors or their main 
economic partners. It is a paradox that not only countries of 
this type are willing to accept the loss of independence of 
their monetary policy, but also some politically unstable 
countries that do not have the courage to push for a tough and 
much-needed economic policy are willing to accept this loss. 
They believe that it is all right if the rest of the world, or 
an important neighboring country, gives discipline and toughness 
to their policy. (Certain countries participating in the 
European Monetary System could serve as an example.) I am fully 
convinced that the Czech Republic does not need to give up the 
autonomy of its monetary policy. 
  The unique economic transformation in our country is based 
on 
the koruna's fixed conversion rate and pinning all the 
price-affecting factors to a fixed exchange rate (while the 
prices are still oscillating toward final values). The 
consequence of our economic transformation is a fundamental 
restructuring of our entire economy and a significant movement 
of prices toward more balanced levels (for 40 years, prices have 
been kept at irrationally established and completely erroneous 
levels). To give up the fixed exchange rate would be unwise and 
unnecessary at the moment. The disadvantages would outweigh the 
advantages. 
  I would like to add one more thing. In Western countries, 
domestic prices are very rigid (that is, inflexible). There are 
various reasons for that (the oligopoly structure, excessive 
state interventionism, and faulty social policy). The 
flexibility of the currency exchange rate is a mechanism 
reducing the inflexibility of the domestic price structures. In 
our country, we do not have to do anything like that because our 
domestic prices are still in the adjustment phase and are still 
flexible enough. On the contrary, because their movement is 
dependent on many conditions, they need a fixed point, such as 
the exchange rate. 
  Despite the fact that our objective is to continue 
liberalizing external economic relations, proceed with the 
deregulation of the financial flows, and attain a higher degree 
of external convertibility (according to the definitions of the 
International Monetary Fund Charter, we will be able to achieve 
the lower degree of "full" convertibility--that is, full 
convertibility of the current account of the balance of 
payment), it seems advantageous for the time being to opt for 
the first two of the three hardly compatible objectives and make 
them a short-term (or medium-term) priority.

<F P=106> [Article by "tk, CTK": "Ministry of Defense Will Prepare </F>
Concept of Orders for Arms Manufacturers"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Ministry of Defense is to draw up 
within six months a basic concept concerning future long-term 
state orders for the arms industry, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus 
told journalists after the conclusion of a consultative meeting 
of ministers yesterday, which was devoted to the state's 
relationship with the arms industry. In its proposal, the 
Ministry of Defense will determine which long-term orders 
directly affect the country's ability to defend itself. The 
state will then focus mainly on this area, and the 
arms-industry's chances of obtaining such orders will look more 
promising, Vaclav Klaus declared. The second group of 
arms-industry items will be defined less precisely, and the 
state's long-term approach to it will be much looser. 
  The state will not organize the export of arms production, 
the prime minister declared further. It will only carefully 
monitor the fairness of economic competition and compliance with 
legislative regulations concerning production and exports. 
  Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said that, once the program 
for the Czech Army's reequipment has been drawn up, talks will 
be initiated with Czech firms that will be able to participate 
in the Army's reequipment. The process of reequipment will last 
up to 10 years, according to Baudys. 
  The Army's reequipment would bring long-term state orders 
for 
a number of companies. As early as the late 1980's, for 
example, the Ceska Zbrojovka [Czech Arms Factory] company in 
Uhersky Brod started to develop a set of new-generation small 
arms called Lada. The technical development and testing of the 
weapon have been wound up, and the company is waiting only for a 
state order. As representatives of Ceska Zbrojovka told 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, after the acquisition of the order, the 
technical preparation for the production of the Lada set will 
require three more years and investments of approximately 500 
million korunas [Kc]. A state order would be worthwhile for the 
Uhersky Brod arms factory and would also expand its export 
potential. The company does not need it in order to survive, 
however. It exports about 66 percent of its present production 
to 46 states all over the world. The biggest importers of its 
products are customers in Austria, the FRG, and the United 
States. The aggregate revenues of Ceska Zbrojovka Uhersky Brod 
a.s. reached Kc516 million last year. This year it expects to 
take in Kc900 million; the projected profit for this year is 
Kc105 million.

  [Text] Warsaw, 6 Apr--President Lech Walesa, while 
receiving Heikki Haavisto, Finland's foreign minister, in the 
Belweder on 6 April, expressed Poland's will to expand contacts 
with Finland. Earlier, Minister Haavisto was received by Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak. 
  According to the Polish president, Polish-Finnish relations 
are "not bad," but they do not make full use of all of the 
capabilities of either of the two countries. In his opinion, 
Poland and Finland, as medium-size countries, could play a 
greater role in international organizations. Lech Walesa said 
that Poland and Finland want to join European organizations that 
"have proved themselves so far." Finland has already succeeded 
in this field. Poland still has a long way to go, the president 
said. 
  The subject of talks with Waldemar Pawlak was economic 
cooperation between the two states and trade exchange. The 
prime minister conveyed to the Finnish minister an invitation 
for the head of the Finnish Government to pay a visit to Poland.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski </F>
by Christophe Turowski; place and date not given: "Poland Wants 
Its Voice To Be Heard"] 
  [Text] [Turowski] President Walesa appears disappointed by 
the reluctance of Western countries to commit themselves to a 
system that would guarantee security in Central and East Europe. 
Do you feel the same? 
  [Olechowski] Current events will determine Poland's position 
within the continent's future political configuration. First, 
we need to define what our role is to be within NATO and the 
European security system. We also need to take into account the 
state of relations between the Western world and Moscow. Poland 
cannot forget that Russia is its largest and most powerful 
neighbor. We therefore want our voice to be heard and taken 
seriously. 
  [Turowski] Is there not a risk that this Polish voice may be 
stifled by Russia's, which the West appears more willing to 
listen to? 
  [Olechowski] Seen from Warsaw, the priority for European 
powers, including Russia, must be to establish a reliable and 
strong European security system. Our position is therefore that 
existing institutions must be expanded and that Poland must be 
allowed to join such institutions as soon as possible. We 
believe they are the only guarantee of peace there is. However, 
Russia has so far remained wary of NATO, which makes for 
excessively rigid policies. Still, Warsaw and Moscow have now 
established good cooperative relations from both a bilateral and 
a regional standpoint. 
  [Turowski] The strategy of the United States has been 
visibly 
pro-Russian. Does that worry you? 
  [Olechowski] The United States has been doing everything in 
its power to incite Russia to embrace the rules of democracy and 
market economy. President Clinton's attitude is quite 
understandable. However, I would definitely worry should the 
Americans seek a strategic alliance with Russia. In the current 
context, such a move would be highly premature. 
  [Turowski] Poland was the first country to formally 
recognize the new Ukrainian state. How do you explain the 
special relationship that has since developed between the two 
nations? 
  [Olechowski] Poland is delighted with Kiev's rising 
political profile on the international scene. At first, 
Ukrainian independence created much uncertainty in the West. 
Today, the United States and Russia have initiated a political 
dialogue with Ukraine. Washington and Moscow have given 
assurances that are tantamount to a commitment to preserve 
Ukraine's independence and security. It would be desirable that 
the headquarters of an existing international institution be 
moved to Kiev in order to further anchor Ukraine to Europe. 
  [Turowski] Does this alliance between Poland and Ukraine not 
stem from an anti-Russian feeling? 
  [Olechowski] By definition, this cooperation between our two 
countries, both of which have an equal aspiration for liberty 
and democracy, cannot be a threat to anyone. Nowadays, Poland 
has many more neighbors than four years ago, and we have signed 
friendship treaties with all of them. For the first time in a 
region that was racked by fratricidal wars for centuries, all 
nations have recovered their independence. Consequently, there 
is a need to create good neighborly relations, a basic 
requirement for security in Europe. 
  [Turowski] Moscow made its considerable clout felt on the 
occasion of the settlement negotiated in Sarajevo by the United 
Nations. How do you view this change of tack? 
  [Olechowski] This is an unqualified success for Russian 
diplomacy. As for Poland, we have always supported European 
initiatives meant to put an end to the conflict in the former 
Yugoslavia. And our participation is commensurate to our means: 
UN forces in Bosnia include a Polish military contingent. This 
tragedy is also a warning, reminding us that similar conflicts 
could happen just about anywhere in Europe. This is a lesson we 
cannot afford not to learn if we intend to prepare for the 
future. And this is why Poland is so adamant about human and 
minority rights, and also why it supports the Balladur [French 
prime minister] plan for conflict prevention in Europe. 
  [Turowski] Two years ago, in your capacity as finance 
minister, you voiced some bitterness with respect to 
French-Polish relations. What is your point of view today as 
foreign minister? 
  [Olechowski] You could say that France and Germany have been 
our mentors within the European Union. The periodic meetings 
between the three countries' foreign ministers are the best 
testimony to this. Furthermore, these meetings are now 
supplemented by meetings between the defense ministers. Should 
France and Germany succeed in integrating Poland in the WEU 
[Western European Union], that would be proof that their efforts 
were effective. 
  [Turowski] And yet French companies seem strangely absent 
from Poland... 
  [Olechowski] While French companies are absent from Poland 
today, they will regret it tomorrow. Indeed, whatever the 
COFACE [French Insurance Company for External Trade] may think, 
Poland is no longer a risk-prone country. Those who invest now 
can be assured of very healthy returns.

<F P=106> [Article by Wieslaw S. Debski from Moscow: "The </F>
Oleksy-Yeltsin Meeting"] 
  [Text] On Friday [1 April] at the Kremlin in Moscow, Jozef 
Oleksy and Boris Yeltsin discussed Polish-Russian cooperation 
and European security. 
  The Sejm speaker pointed to the need to prepare new 
agreements and treaties that would be more specific than the 
interstate treaty already in place because the state of our 
cooperation, especially economic cooperation, is poor. 
  Yeltsin agreed with these arguments and promised that he 
would personally see to it that Minister Andrey Kozyrev responds 
quickly and specifically to the proposals of cooperation 
presented in Krakow by Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski. 
  It seems that most important for the Polish members of 
parliament [MP's] were talks on European security for Poland and 
Russia. Even though no breakthrough was achieved in this area, 
the two parties discussed many controversial issues related to 
this subject. It is worth mentioning that Oleksy met with the 
Russian president, prime minister, and minister of foreign 
affairs. He also spoke with the members of three important 
committees (defense, international affairs, and budget) as well 
as four factions (on Friday--Yegor Gaydar's "Russia's Choice"). 
The Russians tried to win the deputies over to the concept of 
collective European security, based on the CSCE. All forces, 
including representatives of the reform camp (such as Sergey 
Stankiewich and Oleg Bogomolov) were rather unenthusiastic about 
the "Partnership for Peace" initiative. There is still 
controversy in Moscow over the Partnership plan: Yeltsin's 
spokesman said on Thursday that the Kremlin still needs six or 
seven months to hold consultations on this issue; as early as 
the following day, Minister Kozyrev declared that his country 
would join Partnership for Peace in April. 
  However, the Russians' reluctance to accept the present 
concept of Partnership was clearly noticeable. They claim that 
the West is not treating them as an equal partner, "another 
architect of the new Europe," as Stankiewich put it. 
  Jozef Oleksy kept saying, politely but firmly, that Poland 
sees guarantees for its security in NATO membership, and it will 
strive to achieve this goal, no matter how dissatisfied Moscow 
may be with such a solution. 
  Summing up the entire visit, the speaker said the following 
at a press conference: "This is not the Sejm's foreign policy. 
This is merely the implementation of the main points of the 
state's foreign policy. The parliamentary platform helps to 
promote dialogue between various parties and political forces in 
both states." This exchange of views will be continued, perhaps 
also at the meetings of MP's from the Weimar triangle (Poland, 
Germany, and France), with members of the Russian State Duma.

<F P=106> [Article by "AWO": "We Want To Join NATO"] </F>
  [Text] The Partnership for Peace program does not 
guarantee us or other Central European countries membership in 
NATO. Even so, does it enhance our security? This question was 
put to a representative group of Polish citizens age 15 and over 
by the Public Opinion Survey Center. The answer is that most of 
us believe that Partnership for Peace is good for our security, 
as the table illustrates. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Does Partnership for Peace enhance Poland's security?                        | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|No                                    |24 percent                            | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Yes                                   |66 percent                            | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Hard to say                           |10 percent                            | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  A decisive majority of Poles believe that Poland should 
strive most energetically for NATO membership. Advocates of 
this option constitute 79 percent of respondents, while 
opponents of our association with the NATO pact represent only 7 
percent of those questioned. The belief that NATO membership is 
a correct course for Poland increases along with respondents' 
attained level of education. Its most fervent champions are 
optimistic, affluent, and inclined to approve the changes that 
took place under Solidarity rule. Those who are discontented 
and pessimistic rarely advocate our membership in NATO. 
  The survey also provided an opportunity to investigate our 
views on our country's sovereign status. A little over 50 
percent of those questioned believe that Poland is now fully 
sovereign and independent of other states. One in three 
respondents sees our situation as exactly opposite. This 
distribution of views has not changed for the past year. 
Residents of large cities are convinced of our sovereignty. 
Those who live in the rural sector and in smaller cities 
maintain a much higher degree of skepticism in this question. 
Discrepancies between views held by urban and rural dwellers 
are becoming progressively greater and embrace a number of other 
questions beside the subject under discussion. It has not yet 
been ascertained whether this phenomenon is caused by 
differences in urban and rural mentalities or by divergent 
interests.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Zalewski: "How and Why Lech Walesa Made a </F>
360-Degree Turnaround"] 
  [Text] In recent weeks, President Lech Walesa has launched 
an all-out attack on the postcommunists. The Belweder has 
opened attacks on many fronts. The most painful blow was the 
rejection of the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati to the post of 
deputy prime minister. Equally painful was the veto of the new 
Popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] Law. The victim of 
the skirmishes with the Belweder turned out to be Zbigniew 
Siemiatkowski, for whom the door to the Ministry of National 
Defense was once again closed. The president also said that he 
had a "Wunderwaffe" [secret weapon] up his sleeve: He may or may 
not sign the budget. He is not concealing the fact that the 
reasons for making such a decision will be purely political. 
Walesa's reservations concern not really the budget itself but 
those who have passed it. 
  For the first time since the presidential campaign in 1990 
and the first stage of his presidency, groupings coming from the 
Polish People's Republic have once again become Walesa's main 
enemy. As he delivered a blow to the Democratic Left Alliance 
[SLD], the president unfurled the anticommunist banners, which 
had gathered dust and lain in the Belweder completely forgotten. 
Walesa's statements started to include increasingly more of the 
anticommunist rhetoric that had been forgotten. He returned to 
the ideas of file-checking and decommunization, even though 
quite recently he has declared that he would not allow the 
political struggle to mean a series of revenge acts. 
  Most of the actors and observers of the political scene are 
close to expressing the opinion that the recent activities of 
Lech Walesa were the preliminary stage of his presidential 
campaign. One can suppose that, through this anti-SLD impetus, 
Walesa is hoping to kill two birds with one stone. First, he 
wants to clean the foreground in the race for the presidency: He 
is trying to weaken his most serious rival for this post. In 
line with the results of opinion polls, this rival is SLD 
Chairman Aleksander Kwasniewski. Second, he wants to build a 
camp supporting him, which would lead him to the presidency for 
the second time. Here the calculations are simple: Walesa 
thinks very highly of his personal prestige; however, he would 
like to back it with the support of the divided--but still quite 
strong--Solidarity camp. It so happens that the Solidarity 
parties are seeking a presidential candidate, even though they 
are not looking in the direction of the former Solidarity 
leader. Therefore, Walesa has decided to take part in the 
bidding, and he is presenting his assets before he has been 
officially requested to do so. 
  On the first issue, Walesa achieved definite, though 
unexpected, success. The attack on Kwasniewski, which was 
carried out with the tacit support of Waldemar Pawlak (because 
Kwasniewski is also his rival in both the coalition and the 
future presidential campaign) yielded results. Even though the 
SLD survived the onslaught, the nerves of its leader were too 
weak. First, Kwasniewski, who was probably in despair, stated 
that he is ready to publicly renounce his presidential 
ambitions. Next, he blurred his image of a serious and open 
politician through his escapade with the help of a ladder. That 
ladder will probably be one of the greatest arguments in any 
negative campaign aimed at Kwasniewski, especially a television 
campaign because the escape of the SLD leader was recorded on 
magnetic tape. 
  Now one should perhaps expect a change in the direction of 
the presidential onslaught. If Walesa decides that Kwasniewski 
has ceased to be a serious countercandidate in the race for the 
presidency, he will deal with another politician from the list 
of his rivals. This politician is Waldemar Pawlak. If there is 
not a "clandestine agreement" between the president and the 
prime minister, the harmonious cooperation between them may turn 
into a ruthless fight. The beginning of this may be the 
president's veto of the budget. It would be a blow, first of 
all, to the head of government. 
  Even though Walesa is fairly successful in "cleaning the 
foreground," he has not had any success in building a political 
camp supporting him. The president can see that the main 
Solidarity circles do not really trust him. He can also see, 
however, that their support may prove to be very beneficial for 
him. After he called them "screwups," he started trying to win 
the favors of those groups: On one day, the right-wing coalition 
severely criticizes the new "popiwek"; on the next, the 
president vetoes this law. 
  During his term of office, the president performed a 
complete 
360-degree turnaround, and today he is close to the position he 
was in back in 1990. His supporters of that time will probably 
not forget what came after that year. It will be difficult to 
say that Adam Michnik was wrong when he wrote the article 
entitled "Why I Will Not Vote for Lech Walesa"; he warned that 
this person was totally unpredictable. 
  Walesa may become the victim of his own style of wielding 
presidential power. He employed the strategy of weakening every 
political camp whose strength grew during his presidency. In 
the charged world of politics, the Belweder was a considerable 
force--disproportionately greater than its true power. The 
position of Walesa and the realm of his power were safe. 
  The first "victims" of Walesa proved to be his supporters, 
with whom he soon started to fight, supporting the so-called 
left pillar. The Suchocka government also had problems with the 
Belweder. However, at a certain moment, these tactics proved 
false: The SLD and the Polish Peasant Party became very 
powerful. At this time, it has turned out that the president, 
with few supporters, may prove too weak. He needs a political 
camp, which he has himself dismantled and which he will have 
difficulty putting together. 
  His chances are very slim. His roads and the roads of the 
right wing have diverged too much. He will definitely not 
enchant the liberal camp by transferring political disputes to 
the economy. The Democratic Union will certainly not like his 
ideas concerning decommunization. Such arguments might only win 
over the most radical electorate: the supporters of Marian 
Krzaklewski, Antoni Macierewicz, and Jan Parys. However, they, 
in turn, feel the most intense hatred for the present head of 
state. 
  Walesa can count on only one thing--that the "post-August 
Poland" will not manage to find a candidate for the president 
and, not wanting any postcommunist politician in that post, it 
will support Walesa in an act of despair. In such a case, 
Walesa would once again prove strong because the others are weak.

  [Text] Dariusz Rosati, the coalition's candidate for the 
posts of deputy prime minister and minister of finance, has not 
yet made a final decision concerning the withdrawal of his 
candidacy for these posts. He said in our early morning program 
that this will take a few days. Rosati said that, at the 
request of representatives of both coalition parties, he has 
changed his earlier decision to resign as the candidate. In his 
opinion, failing to appoint someone to the post of deputy prime 
minister for economic affairs and minister of finance has 
aroused concern in Poland and abroad. 
  [Begin recording] [Rosati] My impression is that the 
situation is certainly not good when there is no one responsible 
for the economy, when there is no one with whom one can have 
responsible talks on what government policy will be in the near 
future, on how the government will try to resolve the situation 
concerning the pressure of demands for pay hikes, how the 
government will solve the problem of restructuring of the state 
industries, etc. 
  [Reporter Olejnik] Would you put your name to this budget? 
  [Rosati] I have already said that the budget bill, in fact 
the budget itself [pauses]... Is this what you mean? 
  [Olejnik] Yes, yes. 
  [Rosati] The budget is a compromise between needs and 
capabilities, and, personally, I think I would sign my name 
under this budget. 
  [Olejnik] And what is your opinion on the excess wage tax 
[Popiwek] law? As you know, the president has not signed this 
law. 
  [Rosati] I was against Popiwek from the very beginning, and 
I 
did not like the new version of the law, either. I favor 
adopting different solutions, as I have written before. 
However, at the moment, we are in the worst possible situation 
because we do not have any law, and we also do not know if there 
is going to be any law in the future. Consequently, there is an 
incentive here for work enterprises to take advantage of this 
short period, when there is a lack of any legal regulations, and 
introduce pay rises. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Monika Olejnik was talking to Professor Rosati.

<F P=106> [Interview with OPZZ Chairperson Ewa Spychalska by Dorota </F>
Bardzinska; place and date not given: "An Umbrella on a Hanger"] 
  [Excerpts] [Bardzinska] The All-Polish Trade Unions 
Agreement [OPZZ] backed the government in the budget ballot. 
Was this voting not very comfortable for the union? 
  [Spychalska] It was very difficult because the budget is 
extremely stretched, does not secure the fundamental needs, and, 
on top of it all, is not the full implementation of the program 
of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. We understand that this 
is a four-year program, but the people, who are simply going 
through many hardships, do not really feel like waiting. 
  [Bardzinska] Why, then, did the union's deputies support the 
budget? 
  [Spychalska] No one can work miracles. We evaluated this 
budget and checked whether it was feasible and secure, whether 
it clarified the legal situation. We also analyzed how the 
budget distributed money for various purposes. The budget met 
all of these conditions. I must also say that the additional 
law that makes it possible to amend the budget is quite 
important. 
  [Bardzinska] Does your support for the budget mean that you 
have become a progovernment union? 
  [Spychalska] You are asking me whether we have placed a 
protective umbrella over the government? Well, we have not, 
among other reasons, because we publicly criticized all of the 
things we did not like about the budget. 
  [Bardzinska] When this government was only beginning its 
work, you used to say that the OPZZ would not give it even an 
umbrella handle.... 
  [Spychalska] The budget issue is not at all a matter of 
protecting the government, but a matter of stabilizing the state 
and setting things in order. As the situation gradually 
improves and the budget's revenues increase, we will make 
efforts to improve social protection mechanisms. 
  [Bardzinska] The budget ballot was probably difficult for 
you personally as well, was it not? One of the deputy chairmen, 
who, according to some commentators, may be your rival, voted 
against... 
  [Spychalska] It is of secondary importance. Deputy Chairman 
Wisniewski underscored very clearly the lack of money for 
expenditures in the area of social policy because he happens to 
be dealing with these issues. He stated in public that 
increasing the deficit is not as dangerous as causing a social 
outbreak by the lack of that money. He has good reason to say 
so. However, if we look at this issue realistically, increasing 
the deficit means greater inflation. The latter, in turn, hits 
the poorest the hardest. It was difficult to persuade him to 
change his mind; he remained faithful to his views until the 
end. As a result, by the decision of the club, he was expelled 
from the SLD. [passage omitted] 
  [Bardzinska] How would you comment on the president's veto 
of the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases]? 
  [Spychalska] The president's action is in line with our 
unionist action--when we voted against this law. 
  [Bardzinska] What can you say about the talks between the 
OPZZ unionists and this government? Are they easier because the 
OPZZ deputies belong to the coalition? 
  [Spychalska] They are difficult. Government representatives 
are telling us: Why, you do know the program, so you should 
understand the prospects for its implementation. We certainly 
know that. However, we want this stated clearly in negotiations. 
We want an implementation schedule to be prepared and certain 
social minimums to be guaranteed. 
  Actually, I found it easier to discuss certain difficult 
issues, such as the problem of reclaiming, with the 
representatives of the Suchocka government--Minister Kuron and 
Minister Osiatynski. The issues of reclaiming have not been 
brought to an end yet because part of the statement by the 
Constitutional Tribunal was adopted by the Sejm, but it did not 
pass through the legislative path. Now, the committee that 
handles reclaiming issues is forwarding so many motions to us 
that they exceed the number of motions forwarded to us during 
the two years of governments not favorable to us. The unionists 
are indignant and asking: Why is it so difficult to reach 
agreement? Or, what do we gain by being in the coalition? 
  Minister Miller told us that the committee is independent 
and 
is not in any way subordinated to him; he only ensures it 
administrative support. 
  [Bardzinska] Does the OPZZ support the idea of returning 
union property? 
  [Spychalska] Yes, it does. The controversial issue is only 
the problem of pricing. 
  [Bardzinska] Your deputy said that he is not satisfied with 
this government. 
  [Spychalska] I am not fully satisfied with it, either. 
  [Bardzinska] What are the reasons for this dissatisfaction? 
  [Spychalska] Talks with the government take too long. They 
are often too general, and there are not enough earlier 
agreements reached among the various ministries. Sometimes our 
government colleagues just cannot decide on a firm solution--in 
this or that way. However, it is high time they started doing it. 
  [Bardzinska] What does the OPZZ gain by being in the 
coalition? 
  [Spychalska] Not much, really. It is even a very 
troublesome situation for us, which we can feel rather strongly. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Bardzinska] What is your evaluation of the recent protests 
of Solidarity ["S"]? 
  [Spychalska] It is a pity that it all happened like this 
because the things that "S" demanded in its protest actions are 
the same issues we are discussing at the negotiation table with 
the government. Apart from that, any strike results in losses. 
People know perfectly well that there is keen competition on 
the market and that, when there is a stoppage in a company, the 
company's rival profits. Strike is a weapon that should be used 
as a last resort. If it is overused, it loses its strength; it 
simply ceases to be dangerous. 
  [Bardzinska] Did OPZZ unions take part in those protests? 
  [Spychalska] No, we did not approve of those activities. 
However, there was neither a recommendation to take part in the 
strikes nor a ban. Our organizations are legal entities and can 
decide their activities themselves. 
  In referenda, work forces were asked the following 
questions: 
Do you want to earn more? Are you satisfied with your living 
standard? Are you, then, ready to protest? Well, who would 
answer "no" to such questions? Therefore, I could see that the 
results of the referenda were not related properly. 
  [Bardzinska] Thank you for the interview.

<F P=106> [Report by R.W.: "CBOS on Strikes; They Are Caused by </F>
Activists, Poor People Strike" -- diagram appearing in original 
text not included] 
  [Text] The wave of strikes and protests across the country 
will increase, according to almost half (48 percent) of adult 
Poles questioned by the Public Opinion Research Center [CBOS] in 
mid-March, a few days after "Solidarity," in line with its 
February announcement, began a nationwide protest action. 
Almost two-thirds (63 percent) of respondents agree with the 
opinion that given the present situation, "staging a strike 
actually does not provide any results," and 70 percent object to 
the union's organizing a general strike. In comparison with 
February, the number of people approving strikes has decreased, 
which, however, does not apply to the group which most widely 
takes part in such protests -- that is, among skilled workers. 
  Forty percent of respondents would be ready to take part in 
an organized strike at their enterprise. Thirty-eight percent 
of respondents might go on a so-called solidarity strike, that 
is, a strike which backs protests at other enterprises; 41 
percent would be prepared to participate in a general strike 
against the government's economic policies. 
  Half of the respondents believe that strikes are most 
frequently caused by union activists. Every fourth respondent 
believes that activists announce strikes to avert an 
uncontrolled outbreak of dissatisfaction. Why do people take 
part in strikes? Almost half (46 percent of the respondents) 
say that the reasons are, first of all, political -- an aversion 
for the present government. A little fewer (40 percent) of the 
respondents think that dominating factors are economic 
considerations -- the desire to improve their material situation. 
  Regardless of the reasons, employees with low wages and 
those 
living on the brink of poverty (46 percent of respondents chose 
this answer) take part in strikes more often than employees with 
fairly good wages who would like to earn more (39 percent). 
  According to the respondents, most justified are the strikes 
of health-care employees (opinion of 64 percent of respondents), 
miners (55 percent), and teachers (43 percent). Support for the 
protests of railway workers, metallurgists, or employees of the 
arms industry is much weaker. 
  Among every hundred respondents, only eight believe that the 
protests of postal workers are justified; six -- that the 
protests of municipal transportation companies are justified; 
and only two -- that strikes by employees of the power 
engineering industry are justified. 
  Every second respondent believes that decisions concerning 
strike demands in state-run enterprises should be made by the 
directors of those enterprises; every fourth person thinks that 
such decisions should be left to the government. 
  The poll was conducted between 10 and 14 March on a 
representative sample of 1,228 adult Poles.

<F P=106> [Article by Janina Paradowska: "Taming the Peasant Party: A </F>
Ruling Party Still Desires Power"] 
  [Excerpts] Were a poll to be conducted nowadays among 
politicians from various parties, both those inside and outside 
the parliament, and were they asked a single question--namely, 
which political party is the greatest threat to market reforms 
and Poland's modernization--most would unequivocally name the 
Polish Peasant Party (PSL) and the Confederation for an 
Independent Poland (KPN). But, because the KPN suffered a defeat 
in the recent elections and is now perceived as a fringe party, 
the focus nowadays is on the PSL, a ruling party. 
  This is not a novel assessment of the PSL because that is 
how 
it has been perceived, more or less, for the past few years. 
Paradoxically enough, it has always been one of the most 
desirable partners for, properly speaking, all of the coalition 
governments, starting with the Tadeusz Mazowiecki administration 
and ending with the cabinet of Hanna Suchocka. During that 
entire period, the post-Solidarity groupings followed the same 
tactic of badmouthing the SLD [Democratic Left Alliance] and 
lauding first the ZSL [United Peasant Party] and then the PSL as 
a party that has won credibility, broken with its past, and is 
now an equal partner in the new democratic order. It could even 
be said that the PSL had no enemies. 
  Thus, the PSL owes its current standing to not only the 
economic situation and the ability of that party to flirt with 
every political alignment but also to its courting by many 
Solidarity politicians. They would say, "Without the PSL, Poland 
cannot be governed and the countryside modernized," and they 
attributed the defeat of the entire Solidarity movement to, 
among other factors, its evolution into a large number of 
parties of the still nonexistent middle class and its failure to 
create a political grouping attractive to any substantial 
segment of the rural electorate. 
<H5>  A Painless Transformation </H5>
  It is even my impression that for years there existed a 
strange belief that the PSL could be tamed by being gradually 
involved in governance and, on the occasion, made docile. 
Accordingly, the radical and claimant comments of PSL Deputies 
Jacek Soska and Wlodzimierz Wiertek were viewed as mere 
curiosities, while substantive negotiations were under way with 
Aleksander Luczak, who was erroneously believed to be more 
representative of the dominant thinking within the PSL. 
  In such a situation, the PSL was bound to succeed, and this 
success has many fathers. To this day, the difference between 
the SLD and the PZPR [Polish United Workers Party] persists in 
social awareness, whereas the transformation of the ZSL into the 
PSL occurred so painlessly as to surely amaze its own members. 
It is simply that there has always been the PSL, whereas the ZSL 
became just one of the episodes in the history of the peasant 
movement. In the course of 100 years of existence of the peasant 
movement, there were as many as 45 peasant parties; the parties 
were short-lived, but people remained attached to the populist 
tradition. After all, some 100 members of the former Mikolajczyk 
[1945] PSL and entire field branches have been incorporated in 
the present-day ZSL, and, as even the most deserving ZSL 
activists say, "This shows clearly where our roots lie." 
Solidarity activists, who are in the opposition nowadays, judge 
otherwise; they say that, if there is any political party that 
remained unscathed by the recent period of tumultuous changes on 
the political scene and has retained its 
nomenklatura, it is the PSL, and they point out that, 
even among the social democrats, the internal changes have been 
more extensive. 
  The truth about the present-day PSL lies between these two 
extreme opinions, although it is immeasurably difficult to 
discover, owing to both the obvious tendency to erase the past 
and the greatly different ways of thinking about the future. 
  The most that is known about the party concerns its 
organizational status and structure, even though, for example, 
its officiating Deputy Chairman Wincenty Stawarz has offered the 
caveat that the related figures are incomplete and that he will 
have more information only a few months hence because 
"organizational status is being determined." According to 
available data, the PSL has a membership of 250,000, of whom an 
unknown proportion pay dues of 10,000 zlotys [Z] monthly (for 
retirees, the dues are Z5,000). Among that quarter-million, only 
some 10,000 are party activists, meaning members who respond to 
every call and who are "experienced activists, not 
rabble-rousers like Lepper." It is not known how many of them 
used to be ZSL activists. Before 1989, the ZSL had a membership 
of about half a million, but on paper only, so to speak. After 
1991 [its transformation into the PSL], it gained some 50,000 
new members; this influx was undoubtedly due to the new 
proactivism among members of the former Mikolajczyk PSL, who 
brought in the young on their coattails. At any rate, PSL 
members are chiefly rural and small-town inhabitants. Farm 
laborers account for 10,000 and the intelligentsia, chiefly 
rural and small-town, for 20,000. In Warsaw, there are 3,500 
members, and undoubtedly the nation's capital is a white spot on 
the PSL's map. The PSL's traditional strongpoints are in 
southern and southeastern Poland. All of these figures appear 
inconsistent and incompatible. 
<H5>  No Debts </H5>
  There are 49 voivodship PSL boards at present, and each 
maintains its own office. [passage omitted] In the opinion of 
other political parties, the PSL is a rich party precisely 
because it survived as a nomenklatura grouping under 
the new order. However, its headquarters on Grzybowska Street 
[in Warsaw] has a "homespun" and far from luxurious look, and 
there are about 20 persons, including clerical employees, on its 
salaried staff. In the field, most offices are exercised on a 
volunteer basis, and their directors are on half-pay. 
  The PSL prides itself on having no debts. It owes no money, 
but neither does it have money for publishing its own press, a 
dream of most of its members because many activists believe that 
the problems with achieving rapport with public opinion would be 
solved once the party publishes its own daily, that once the PSL 
publishes a newspaper of its own and has a press spokesman of 
its own, its media image would be improved. The matter is 
considered so important that one of the major and most heated 
discussions held within the PSL leadership after the elections 
specifically concerned appointing a press spokesman. 
  The image of a party greedy for power and offices and 
lacking 
a program of its own other than the promotion of [peasant] 
interests, an image propagated by both politicians and the 
media, does not for the time being seem to prevent the PSL from 
winning social support. 
<H5>  Without Beating About the Bush </H5>
  The PSL is the sole party to have gained rather than lost 
since the elections. That is because, to the conservative rural 
and small-town electorate, it matters greatly that Waldemar 
Pawlak [PSL] is the prime minister, like [Wincenty] Witos [a 
popular prewar peasant movement leader], under whose portrait 
the prime minister liked to be photographed. [That electorate 
believes that Pawlak] is a good prime minister, but the liberals 
from the SLD--i.e., from the former PZPR--are obstructing him. 
Professor Mikolaj Kozakiewicz (PSL) put it as follows, without 
beating about the bush: "The PSL is suspicious and mistrustful 
toward all other parties. It cannot stand the Democratic Union 
and the Liberals, and, at the same time, it finds the SLD 
unbearable because it feels hostile toward its previous master, 
and its recent experiences provide proof of dictatorial 
intentions on the part of the SLD." 
  The PSL is nowadays a party that undoubtedly is aware that 
most actors on the political scene perceive it as wielding 
destructive clout, and it believes such perceptions to be 
unjustified and exaggerated, but, at the same time, it still is 
unable to bring its potential to bear. Prof. Kozakiewicz said, 
"That party is strong in having Pawlak as the prime minister and 
in counting on becoming the sole ruling party and winning the 
elections to local governments, which should strengthen its 
standing for a long time." 
  But, what some see as strength others view as weakness. 
Janusz Piechocinski, who is for ideological reasons most 
critical of what has been happening within the party in recent 
times, views the PSL's drive toward political power as a sign of 
weakness. He said, "Since July 1992, 33 days after Pawlak became 
prime minister, the entire strategy of the PSL has been focused 
on returning to the building on Aleje Ujazdowskie. The dominant 
belief within the PSL is that we shall return there, and this is 
combined with the belief that, once we are in power, we shall be 
able to do something for the nation. The drive for political 
power has become so obsessive as to completely suppress the 
internal discussion, waged during 1988-91, on what kind of party 
the PSL should be--a broad kind of peasants' trade union or an 
increasingly broad-based rather than class-oriented political 
party." 
  Thus, while, on the one hand, the 33 days of Pawlak's 
prime-ministership afforded an opportunity for the PSL in that 
they awakened the hope, verging on certainty, that the PSL would 
become the helmsman of the ship of state, on the other, they 
killed the hope that the PSL would become a new kind of party. 
This problem is perceived most acutely by Mikolaj Kozakiewicz, 
who believes that, since then, a kind of authoritarianism, of 
belief that the party's reins must be held in the firm hand of 
its chairman, that no internal discussions are needed, has taken 
root within the PSL. The ideal of the party chairman is thus 
that most faithful of loyalists, Michal Strak, who even waged 
his electoral campaign under the slogan "I did not let the party 
chairman down, and I won't let you down, either." Prof. 
Kozakiewicz pointed out that in no other present-day political 
party is so much power concentrated in the hands of a single 
person as within the PSL. Thus, Waldemar Pawlak is at the same 
time chairman of the PSL, chairman of the PSL's parliamentary 
caucus, and the prime minister of Poland. The attack against the 
concentration of powers failed. But this does not mean that 
Pawlak can say, "The party, c'est moi." 
  Despite the evident unwillingness to engage in intraparty 
discussions, such discussions are under way, even if, doubtless, 
to a limited extent because it is clear to some PSL leaders that 
a road must be chosen, that it is not enough to be a ruling 
party when experience in governing is limited. 
  Piechocinski pointed out, "In the 1991 elections, our slogan 
was `The peasants to the parliament,' deliberately, because we 
knew that we had a chance by appealing to our most faithful 
followers, the peasants. As a result of these elections, a 
significant number of parliamentary seats was won by the PSL, 
largely owing to such frontline peasant fighters as Soska and 
Wiertek, symbols of struggle for the peasant cause." 
  In 1993, the electoral slogan of the PSL was, "Poland needs 
a 
boss," and the votes were garnered by Waldemar Pawlak, a capable 
man who mastered the political scene following the "portfolio 
crisis" [shifts in ministerial appointments] and who presented 
himself as a serious and responsible politician, critical of 
Solidarity governments but, at the same time, reasonable and 
calm. 
  Was the change in electoral slogans followed by a change 
within the party? No. The PSL remains an arena for contests 
among various program ideas, each supported by a different 
faction. Jacek Soska and Roman Jagielinski support building a 
purely class-oriented party focusing chiefly on the defense of 
farm interests. In other words, they are turning back to the 
formula of a somewhat broader trade union of peasants. For his 
part, Kozakiewicz longs for a return to a leftist orientation of 
the PSL, but in a broadly based rather than a purely peasant 
edition. In his turn, Janusz Piechocinski supports a centrist, 
but also broadly based program, while Andrzej Micewski dreams of 
turning the PSL into a new Christian democratic party. But so 
far not one of these orientations has become predominant. 
However, history shows that, within both the ZSL and the PSL, a 
majority have always been greatly opposed to the concept of a 
party other than that based on a community of peasant interests, 
viewed to be sure in static rather than in dynamic terms. The 
desire to preserve the status quo in the countryside has always 
predominated over the desire to change that countryside and 
propose modernization programs for it. 
<H5>  A Lack of Ideas </H5>
  Artur Balazs, who failed in his attempts to build a not so 
much peasant as populist party based on West European parties 
with populist roots and a broad social program, claimed that the 
only policy pursued by the PSL nowadays is to alleviate the 
burden of the reforms on farmers by getting them additional 
subsidies from the budget. "The PSL has no idea what should be 
done about the agrarian structure, even though it is known that 
some 25 percent of the farmers will not survive in the long run. 
A part of that 25 percent will have to be transferred to the 
agricultural service sector, and there is no help for it. Yet 
the PSL has not put forward any related institutional solutions, 
and it even fails to say that change is inevitable. This is 
simply immoral." 
  Balazs pointed out that the only institutional solution for 
the countryside was put into operation during the administration 
of Tadeusz Mazowiecki--namely, a system of old-age pensions for 
farmers, which incidentally was established without the 
participation of the PSL. 
  An opposition politician can always be suspected of 
subjectivism. But a similar critical tone is being sounded in 
the thinking and comments of PSL deputies, chiefly those more or 
less opposed to their party leader and his immediate entourage. 
In the interview he granted to POLITYKA, Jozef Zych admitted 
that the PSL's program is a collection of generalities instead 
of specific economic proposals. Kozakiewicz said plainly that, 
aside from the agricultural program, whose outline had been 
developed while the ZSL was still extant, the present-day PSL 
has no other program planks. "Pawlak as a politician reacts 
instead of initiating; if the ball flies toward him, he kicks it 
rather than pursuing innovative approaches," the professor 
claims. In Kozakiewicz's opinion, an exchange of ideas within 
the party is moribund. The party became intellectually stagnant 
once the periodical WIES WSPOLCZESNA, on which the ZSL's 
intellectual creme de la creme used to labor, ceased 
publication. Now the situation is further complicated by the 
fact that former ideologists hold high government offices, and 
there is no one to replace them within the PSL itself. 
Piechocinski is of the opinion that, precisely after those first 
33 days, Pawlak had a chance to attract the young intellectuals 
from, say, the Agricultural Academy. At present, the PSL 
contains some intellectuals, but these are rather of the 
provincial kind, who need help in rising to higher rungs of the 
ladder and appealing to opinion-shaping circles, but the PSL has 
not availed itself of this opportunity because it is "focusing 
its effort on gaining political power, no matter who its partner 
might be." 
  When considered altogether, the opinions on various options 
available to the PSL at present indicate that the party has been 
placing emphasis on criticizing the policies of all of the 
governments so far without making any substantial effort to 
develop constructive "third road" proposals of its own. In 
ideological terms, we confine ourselves to dusting off agrarian 
slogans, although it is hard to say to what extent this is being 
done with the object of developing a new identity for the PSL by 
harking back to old prewar roots of the peasant movement, and to 
what extent this mirrors the belief, especially of the older 
party activists, that precisely a modified agrarianism offers 
that third road for Poland. Quite a few participants in the 
related discussions believe that it is the exploration of a new 
identity for the PSL that is of fundamental importance. 
  If, however, the planks of the PSL's program that are being 
so strongly exposed both on paper and in practice, if only in 
parliamentary practice, are to be characterized by a common 
label, that label would be principally leftist and closest to 
the program espoused by the Labor Union in the 
parliament--namely, labor first, capital second; equal 
opportunity; social justice; and a confusing attitude toward 
privatization. All of this is laced with "Christian values," 
treated here quite instrumentally. Besides, the attitude toward 
these values within the PSL is authentically pluralist and 
sometimes subordinated to tactics of power plays. Thus, any 
intent to transform the PSL into a Christian-democratic party 
does not appear feasible, even though this orientation will 
certainly be present. 
  In all of my conversations concerning the PSL, with its 
activists and representatives of other parties, the same basic 
motif kept surfacing: The PSL nowadays is a ruling party and one 
still desirous of political power; this is its sole distinct 
image. There is room for change. There must be a sharper 
confrontation between the factions in favor of the PSL as a kind 
of peasant trade union and those in favor of a more broad-based 
party. Which one will be the winner? Prof. Kozakiewicz believes 
that, these days, practically no one within the PSL any longer 
believes that it can become a broad-based rather than a purely 
peasant party. In an interview granted to POLITYKA, Aleksander 
Kwasniewski said that he expects the victory of the conservative 
orientation within the PSL and the survival of that party as a 
midsized one with an electorate of some 15 percent of the total. 
Piechocinski is upset because the PSL is forfeiting the 
opportunity to offer a more broad-based program. Jozef Zych is 
worried because the PSL's leadership is being depleted by 
appointments to offices in the government. Kozakiewicz summed 
up, "So long as farmers believe in Pawlak, nothing will change 
within the PSL."

  [Text] Warsaw, 6 Apr--According to Waldemar Pawlak, in a 
few years' time, Poland will be free to shape its future. It is 
important, however, to "have the courage to fight for Poland's 
position in Europe," the prime minister emphasized during a 
meeting with trade counselors held in Rynia near Warsaw. 
  Polish trade counsellors from 28 European countries as well 
as the United States and China are taking part in the meeting. 
  Cooperation within the "Partnership for Development" program 
gives us a chance to develop economic cooperation abroad. We 
should make efforts to achieve cooperation that is well balanced 
within the region and open in all directions. He added that, in 
the near future, information will be a strategic commodity in 
trade and in economic activity. 
  Trade counselors' offices play a decisive role in the flow 
of 
information between Polish enterprises and their foreign 
partners. Unfortunately, according to the prime minister, there 
is no cohesive computer network to facilitate the flow of 
information.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wieslaw Dominik, acting director of the </F>
State Treasury Agricultural Property Agency in Wroclaw, by 
Krzysztof Debek; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Debek] Are you here to save the state farms [PGR] 
or to liquidate them? 
  [Dominik] I am here to restructure the state sector in our 
agriculture. Our agency is a fiduciary organ, whose principal 
brief is to privatize state assets by selling them or renting 
them out. 
  [Debek] So, in the final account, it amounts to liquidation, 
does it not? 
  [Dominik] You could say so, although a special section, 
Section XIV, of the agency has been set up in Warsaw to 
represent agricultural enterprises of particular significance to 
the national agriculture, such as stock-breeding farms, plant 
nurseries, and seed-production centers. These will either 
remain under state administration or be transformed into joint 
ventures, with the State Treasury as the dominant shareholder. 
On the whole, however, local divisions of the State Treasury 
Agricultural Property Agency take over the PGR's in order to 
liquidate them. Here I should add that, during the transition 
period, the agency, as the owner, extends financial assistance 
to at least some spheres of the PGR's operation, such as 
housing, or, in justified cases, helps with the purchase of seed 
material or crop-protection products. After all, we must not 
allow freshly sown crops to go to waste, and banks no longer 
provide credits for the PGR's. 
  [Debek] You could get the impression that this is an 
ideological policy. Even the good PGR's are to be sacrificed 
because they are children of an ideologically incorrect system. 
The unfairness is compounded by the fact that most state farms 
suffer financial difficulties not because they have been 
incompetently or wastefully managed but as a result of the 
financial reform introduced by [former Finance Minister] 
Balcerowicz and the resultant astronomical interest on bank 
loans to agriculture, loans that are temporarily "frozen" in 
crop production and stock-raising ventures. 
  [Dominik] Agreed, but, in the first place, these debts are 
very real, and no one will relieve the PGR's of them. 
Agricultural farms in lower Silesia owe almost 1.5 trillion 
zlotys [Z] to the banks, the state budget, and their 
contractors. And, even if interest constitutes the lion's share 
of that debt, that does not change the picture. Second, there 
have always been farms that are more successful and those that 
are less so--and this not only because of differences in soil 
quality, equipment, or location but because of different 
management systems, varying degrees of care taken over their 
assets, or prudence in making major investment decisions. It is 
no coincidence that, even in these difficult times, certain 
PGR's, mostly in Walbrzych Voivodship but also some in Wroclaw 
Voivodship, manage quite well on their own. The worst situation 
is currently with PGR's in Jelenia Gora Voivodship: All of them 
have by now lost their creditworthiness. 
  [Debek] That is because they operate under the most adverse 
climatic and soil conditions. The previous authorities in power 
deliberately subsidized such farms in order to provide work for 
people in the area and utilize land that, on ideological 
principles, could not be left uncultivated. In addition, in the 
last analysis, attention was paid to the output obtained from 
those farms--that is, to the tons of livestock and grain--rather 
than to their cost-effectiveness. In addition, certain capital 
investments that still place great financial burden on state 
farms today are the result of earlier decisions imposed on them 
by the central administration. Ambitious powers-that-be would 
stipulate, quite arbitrarily, that a dozen poultry farms be 
built in one place, a huge dairy farm in another--more often 
than not in the middle of nowhere--and a massive stock 
production unit for 5,000 beef calves. They gave the orders and 
provided the funds.... 
  [Dominik] Even so, some farm managers were also very eager 
for their farms to be earmarked for such major investment 
projects. They were brilliantly skilled at justifying the 
financial and general economic profitability of such 
undertakings, and, later on, at manipulating the results so as 
to justify allocation of high bonuses for the economic effects. 
I was employed in such PGR's for 10 years, and I know only too 
well how things were. 
  [Debek] Such were the times and such were the conditions to 
which the PGR managers had to adjust. However, you are also 
aware that, regardless of the statistical manipulations of which 
they were guilty, given their trained cadres, their access to 
modern agrotechnology, and their financial resources, the PGR's 
provided models of modern agricultural technology and 
organization in Poland's rural sector. They were the first to 
introduce new varieties of crop plants and new stock-feeding 
systems; they persuaded the traditional peasant farmers that it 
was in their interest to apply fertilizers, to use 
crop-protection products, and so on. Who will assume the 
state's leading role in this capacity now, in our impoverished 
and fragmented rural sector? 
  [Dominik] The PGR's are being transformed, but they will not 
disappear from the map of Poland's economy. Only a proportion 
of our agricultural land will go into the hands of individual 
farmers and be submitted to fragmentation. The general 
principle is that whole farming complexes should be sold or 
rented in their entirety, together with the land, which should 
go with them on a rational basis. In this way, our rural sector 
will retain large and modern farming complexes. The only 
difference will be that they will be owned privately and managed 
in a better way. And, in general, they will be able to remain 
whole precisely because they will be transformed: This is 
because they will be handed over by us to new owners without the 
burden of debts. That is precisely the chance they need! The 
debts will be taken over by the agency, and it will pay them off 
with money obtained from the profits it makes from the 
privatization scheme. 
  [Debek] But where are you going to find those hypothetical 
new owners? The book value of the assets of the PGR's under 
liquidation in Lower Silesia is estimated at Z5 trillion--and 
that is without the value of the land. Where are all the 
capitalists with enough spare money to put into such an 
uncertain financial proposition? Is it not symptomatic that, 
out of the 163 agricultural complexes taken over by the State 
Treasury, your agency has to date managed to liquidate only 18? 
  [Dominik] A vast proportion of our time is taken up with 
preparatory work: stock-taking, preparation of estimates, 
sorting out ownership documents and related paperwork, and so 
on. I can say that this year the process of ownership 
transformations will be definitely speeded up because we have 
already completed the documentation stage for many agricultural 
complexes. And there are enough prospective buyers already: 
More than 80 percent of auction sales we have organized 
recently ended with successful sale transactions. This also 
furnishes an answer to your other question: where to find the 
new owners with sufficient money. Prospective renters at PGR 
auctions are usually people who are already associated with the 
PGR's. They most often form employees' joint ventures, and they 
find the necessary funds by borrowing money--sometimes even 
against the expected harvests. This is because they must, of 
course, have the required 10 percent for the initial down 
payment and for the first installment, just as they must produce 
for us guarantees that they will be able to pay the following 
installments. Apart from that, we are willing to help them by 
negotiating the terms with them. This is, after all, in the 
common interest of the agricultural complexes, the agency, and 
the PGR work forces.... 
  [Debek] Precisely. There are 12,000 people employed in the 
PGR's. For them, a PGR is not only a place where they work but 
also provides them with a whole environment--they live in PGR 
housing, their children used to go to PGR kindergartens, the PGR 
gave them the sheds in which they kept their hogs and the strip 
of field where they could grow their own potatoes, and each 
family was given its quota of milk from the farm's dairy. 
  [Dominik] Of course. And it was such social welfare schemes 
that finished off the state farms. 
  [Debek] But what will happen now? A new owner will take 
over the farm. He will work out that it would not be worth his 
while to raise cattle, and so he will dismiss his farm workers. 
He may at best promise them some seasonal work during the grain 
or potato harvest.... 
  [Dominik] Not at all. One of the terms of the rent 
agreement is that all of the farm employees must have their jobs 
guaranteed for at least one year. What is more, the amount of 
rent payment offered by the potential leaseholder does not 
necessarily have to be the decisive argument in his favor 
against other candidates. It is equally important whether he 
can offer guarantees of maintaining the farm's full production 
profile. We will sign lease contracts only with those 
candidates who can offer us fully credible assurances that they 
will keep these terms. 
  [Debek] In other words, they have to guarantee that they 
will cultivate the land, grow crops, and refrain from 
slaughtering all of the livestock on their farms and viewing the 
land solely as a profitable capital investment? 
  [Dominik] Precisely. 
  [Debek] Thank you for talking to us.

<F P=106> [Article by Maurice Lubatti] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, April 5 (AFP) -- Apparent swings in policy 
regarding the enclave of Gorazde and the non-Serb population in 
the Banja Luka region suggest there could be a crisis of 
authority among the separatist Bosnian Serbs, diplomats at the 
Conference on Yugoslavia said here Tuesday. 
  "Just when there appeared to be a process of normalisation 
under way, with some spirit of reconciliation among the Bosnian 
Serb authorities, everything has been thrown into question with 
this upsurge in tension," a negotiator here said on condition of 
anonymity. 
  A week-long Serb onslaught on the eastern Bosnian enclave of 
Gorazde, and a last-minute reversal on the proposed evacuation 
of several thousand non-Serbs from the northern town of Prijedor 
following a massacre last week, have thrown the spotlight onto 
possible divergences among the Serb leadership. 
  Differences have long been known to exist between separatist 
hardliners, mainly in the army and in the Serbs' Banja Luka 
stronghold, and supporters of Radovan Karadzic, leader of the 
self-proclaimed Serb Republic based at Pale, just outside 
Sarajevo. 
  These differences are seen as the most likely cause of the 
latest developments, the most astonishing of which was 
Karadzic's volte- face over the evacuation of up to 6,000 
Moslems and Croats from Prijedor, scheduled to take place on 
Tuesday. 
  On Sunday Karadzic gave written orders authorising UN and 
Red 
Cross officials to proceed with the evacuation, demanded by the 
non-Serb population of the region which had been terrorised by 
Serb militants. 
  Then on Monday he vetoed the agreed figure of 6,000, saying 
that such a large-scale evacuation was unncessary since, he 
said, measures had been taken to protect civilians in Prijedor. 
The operation was postponed as a result of the reversal. 
  The fighting in the Gorazde region comes after a ceasefire 
was agreed between Bosnians and Serbs in Sarajevo. 
  Rivalry between Serb civilian and military authorities is 
also seen as the likely explanation for such incidents as the 
theft of parcels at Banja Luka, or the confiscation of food 
supplies destined for the northern enclave of Maglaj. 
  The commander of Bosnian Serb forces, General Ratko Mladic, 
seen as the most militant of hardliners, currently spends the 
bulk of his time in the Banja Luka sector rather than at Pale, 
diplomats noted. 
  Unconfirmed reports here indicate that Mladic has fallen out 
with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Karadzic's sponsor in 
the Bosnian conflict. 
  European Union negotiator Lord Owen said last week that at 
his last meeting with Milosevic he had found the Serbian leader 
more amenable to a negotiated settlement to the conflict. 
Serbia has been severely hit by economic sanctions imposed on 
Belgrade in May 1992.

  [Excerpt] Banja Luka, 5 Apr (TANJUG) -- Muslim forces have 
resumed their offensive activities against Serb lines in the 
zone of responsibility of the First Krajina Corps of the Srpska 
republic army today, the information service of the corps said 
in Banja Luka this evening. The strongest Muslim attacks have 
been registered at the Ozren battlefield, particularly at its 
southern part in the Vozuca area. 
  Reinforced by fresh units and with artillery backing, Muslim 
forces attempted to break through the Serb lines at this part of 
the front. 
  The Teslic battlefield was not peaceful today either because 
of fierce attacks by the Muslim army on almost all parts of the 
front in which 82-mm mortars, and antiaircraft and infantry 
weapons were used. The fiercest attacks were launched northeast 
of Teslic. 
  Muslim attacks were resumed west of Doboj and 82-mm mortars 
were used. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sarajevo, 5 Apr (TANJUG) -- Nikola Koljevic, vice 
president of the Srpska republic, had a meeting in Pale this 
afternoon with the UN secretary general's envoy (Sergio de Melo) 
and with Andreas Kuhn, delegate of the International Committee 
of the Red Cross [ICRC]. 
  The talks that took place on this occasion referred to the 
situation in Prijedor and Gorazde and to ways of improving the 
humanitarian situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We agreed to make it possible for the people who wish to 
leave the territory of the Srpska republic to do so. We will 
provide the necessary security measures and guarantees. Those 
who wish to stay will be protected by the Serb authorities, 
Koljevic said after the talks. 
  Koljevic also said that the representatives of the 
international organizations were told that the Serb authorities 
insist on the Serbs in Sarajevo, Tuzla, and central Bosnia being 
given the same treatment, including the right to leave 
Muslim-controlled territory, if they so wish. 
  He added that the Srpska republic's authorities will discuss 
all possibilities for giving ICRC representatives access to 
Gorazde as soon as possible. 
  The UN secretary general's envoy said that "this is not a 
time for dangerous military activities" and that "the most 
important thing is the protection of the Gorazde area." 
  The ICRC representative said the agreement that was reached 
will "satisfy both sides and will provide the answer to the 
question of how to solve the situation in Prijedor." 
  He also said that a number of "specific measures for 
improving the humanitarian situation in Gorazde" have been 
agreed and that the ICRC intends to send food and medicine there 
as soon as possible.

  [Text] Cajnice, 6 Apr (TANJUG)-- Joint forces of the army 
of the Srpska republic this morning continued offensive actions 
from the direction of Cajnice and Foca towards Drina in an 
attempt to liberate Serb villages in the area of Podkozara, the 
command of the Srpska army in Cajnice has announced. 
  The turnabout in fighting in the Gorazde, Foca, and Cajnice 
triangle took place yesterday afternoon when the Serb fighters 
smashed the eight-day offensive of the Muslim army, which is in 
a panicked retreat towards the River Drina. 
  Without suffering any losses, the Serb fighters liberated 
the 
village of Biljin, half a km away from Vitkovici, in an 
unstoppable attack from the direction of Paljika and Trebinjaca 
yesterday evening, the command says. 
  Military police are deployed on the bridge in Vitkovici and 
are preventing the retreating Muslim soldiers from crossing to 
the left bank of the Drina River. 
  The command of the joint forces of the Srpska army says that 
the Muslim army yesterday suffered huge losses in manpower, thus 
denying reports by Muslim media about civilian casualties.

  [Text] We have just received the letter that Alija 
Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
has sent to members of the UN Security Council [UNSC] and the 
Council chairman (?for April). 
  Esteemed Sir, by the decision of Security Council Resolution 
Number 824 that your country also voted for, Gorazde was 
proclaimed a protected zone. However, on 30 March, the Serbian 
aggressor launched an offensive on this town, using artillery 
and tanks. Using their huge advantage in weapons and military 
hardware, Karadzic's Serbs have already taken some villages on 
the outskirts of the protected zone, setting to fire everything 
they reached. The exact toll among civilians is still not 
known, but it is certainly very high. 
  Esteemed Mr. Ambassador, in compliance with the seriousness 
of the situation, please demand for Resolution 824 to be 
consequently implemented, for further attacks at Gorazde to be 
immediately stopped, and for the attackers to be forced to 
withdraw to the lines that the protected zone had at the time it 
was proclaimed, that is, on 5 May 1993. 
  This is written in the letter President Izetbegovic sent to 
the chairman and members of the Security Council.

  [Text] The Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina devoted 
today's session almost completely to the military situation in 
Gorazde. Military and political measures have started and are 
continuing with a view to stopping the offensive on Gorazde. 
  Last night, Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency 
of 
the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, had a telephone conversation 
with Victor Jackovich, U.S. ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
who is in Washington at the moment, and U.S. special envoy 
Charles Redman. Contact has been established with U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher, who will inform U.S. President Bill 
Clinton about the (?Serbian)-Montenegrin offensive at Gorazde. 
  Contact has been established with Akashi, special envoy of 
the UN secretary general, as well as with General Rose, UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They 
were invited to come to Sarajevo. Gen. Rose is expected to come 
today and Akashi is expected to come tomorrow. 
  At the demand of Bosnia-Herzegovina, consultations of the 
members of the Security Council were held last night. It is 
worrying that reports by some UN observers present the situation 
in Gorazde in an entirely different light. According to them, 
the situation is not serious and even less critical. 
  Considering this, the head of our mission to the United 
Nations was told to demand an urgent Security Council session 
and call attention to a possible manipulation of the Council by 
some of its officials, something that may be very dangerous for 
further development of the situation in Gorazde. It will be 
demanded for Gen. Rose to visit Gorazde without delay and 
establish the real situation on the spot. It was decided that 
Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic send letters to chiefs of 
a number of states in which he will acquaint them with the fact 
that the attacked region was proclaimed a security zone under UN 
protection by Resolution 824 of the Security Council. 
  In the opinion of the Presidency of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the offensive on Gorazde, as well as some 
political games obviously linked with that offensive, may 
represent a form of pressure on our side to renounce its just 
and principled demands to be given back occupied territories. 
In any case, the attack on Gorazde and Bihac, as well as the 
continued ethnic cleansing in the Bosnian Krajina, are 
seriously endangering the peace process that has been started in 
the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Presidency is warning the public that all these sad 
facts 
in the field show that the war unfortunately is not over. The 
Presidency has been doing and will do everything in its power 
with a view to reaching a just peace as soon as possible. 
However, these efforts are obviously not met with good will by 
the opposite side that has started this war in the first place. 
Therefore, both our Army and our citizens must be ready for any 
contingency.

  [Text] Geneva, April 5 (TANJUG) -- A spokesman for the U.N. 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Ron Redmond, said on 
Tuesday that the situation in the regions of Banja Luka and 
Prijedor (northern Bosnia-Herzegovina) has stabilized since last 
week but that UNHCR was concerned about the fierceness of 
fighting around Gorazde (eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina). 
  The tragic events in Prijedor (northwest Bosnian Serb 
Republic) which killed 16 civilians, mostly Moslems, between 
March 29 and April 1, broke out after the Moslem army delivered 
six massacred Serb bodies to the Prijedor authorities. 
  The representatives of the local authorities and the ruling 
Serb Democratic Party (SDS) strongly condemned these murders on 
Tuesday. The enquiry conducted so far showed that many persons 
had participated in the killings and that they were committed 
for gain, while the Prijedor police underscored that they would 
persist with solving of each particular case. 
  Redmond set out that UNHCR was concerned about the 
development of the situation in Gorazde where heavy fighting was 
going on, and said that according to the latest U.N. report 
from Gorazde no UNHCR convoy had been allowed to enter the town 
since March 22. 
  U.N. Security Council President Colin Keating said on Monday 
that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] statements showed that the 
Moslems had provoked the latest fighting with Serbs in Gorazde. 
  The heavy Moslem offensive on Serb positions and villages 
was 
launched from Gorazde in late March, although the town should 
have been demilitarized as a U.N. protected area last spring. 
Over 10,000 Moslem troops are engaged in the operations. 
  After signing the Washington Agreement to form a 
Moslem-Croat 
Federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in March, the Moslems launched 
an all-out offensive on the Bosnian Serb Republic in an attempt 
to gain as much territory as possible before the resumption of 
the peace talks.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 5 (AFP) -- Hundreds of refugees 
poured into Gorazde from neighbouring villages Tuesday as Serb 
forces pressed on with an offensive against the Moslem enclave 
in eastern Bosnia, the United Nations said. 
  According to UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] 
spokesman Kris Janowski, 52 people have died and 249 had been 
wounded in the week-old offensive. 
  Radio Sarajevo put the toll even higher: at least 73 dead 
and over 300 injured. 
  Witnesses reported eight villages destroyed by Serb 
artillery 
in the southern part of the enclave, leaving some 1,500 people 
wandering around looking for shelter, the UN refugee agency said. 
  Major Rob Annink, a spokesman for the UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] in Sarajevo, said Serb forces had penetrated eight to 
10 kilometers (five to six miles) into the southern part of the 
enclave and were continuing their attacks on the northeast and 
southeast sectors. 
  There were conflicting reports on how far the Serbs were 
from 
Gorazde itself. Annink said they were 10 kilometers (six miles) 
away, but one military source speaking on condition of anonymity 
put them at just over three kilometers (two miles) from the 
southern suburbs of the town. 
  Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic spoke by telephone with 
the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Cristopher about the 
situation in Gorazde as well as with President Clinton's special 
envoy Charles Redman and UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi. 
  At the end of a special meeting, the Bosnian Presidency 
issued a statement informing the Bosnian Army and population 
that "they have to be ready for all contingencies." 
  "The situation in Gorazde and Bihac (another besieged Moslem 
enclave, in northwestern Bosnia) as well as the ethnic cleansing 
are proof that, unfortunately, the war is not over," the 
statement said. 
  The fighting in Gorazde and Bihac comes as ceasefires are 
generally holding in Sarajevo and central Bosnia. 
  Around 300 people marched in Sarajevo Tuesday to protest 
what 
they called the international community's indifference to Serb 
aggression.

<F P=106> [Report by Mustafa Kurtovic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Text] As we are sending this report, the hurricane 
artillery attack that the aggressor launched this morning on the 
defense lines on the right bank of the Drina River is being 
extended on all lines of defense of the Gorazde defenders. In 
this attack the Chetniks are using the most destructive 
howitzer, mortar, and tank projectiles. The blood-soaked ground 
of the free Gorazde territory is trembling. 
  Members of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina under the command 
of the East Bosnian Operations Group and the units of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs from Gorazde are still firmly 
holding their positions, expecting new attacks by the insane 
Serbo-Montenegrin infantry. 
  At the same time the aggressor is bringing fresh forces from 
the direction of Serbia and Herzegovina. Intelligence reports 
state that the aggressor has carried out a large concentrated of 
new armored-mechanized units in (?Premlje), and that it has a 
large number of new mercenaries from the army of the 
self-proclaimed Yugoslavia. 
  Fresh forces and hardware of the Herzegovina Corps are also 
concentrating in the Foca area. All this indicates that, by 
bringing fresh Chetniks, the aggressor intends to step up the 
offensive attacks on Gorazde. 
  The announced arrival of General Michael Rose, chief 
commander of the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Gorazde 
should and must bring about positive results in stopping further 
suffering of these people, and in the attitude of the 
international community toward Gorazde as a protected zone. The 
truth about Gorazde's suffering in the latest Chetnik offensive 
can be and is being confirmed by UN military observers and UNHCR 
representatives in Gorazde. 
  This is Mustafa Kurtovic reporting for the Radio and 
Television of Bosnia-Herzegovina from the Press Center of the 
Gorazde District.

  [Excerpt] Cajnice, 5 Apr (TANJUG) -- The army of the Srpska 
republic today halted the eight-day offensive by Muslim forces 
toward Cajnice, Foca, and Visegrad, and undertook a 
counteroffensive, the headquarters of the Herzegovina Corps 
announced this evening. 
  The same source says Muslim soldiers are withdrawing toward 
the Drina, where strong police forces, which are not allowing 
them to cross over to the left bank of this river, are waiting 
for them on all bridges. 
  The defeat of the Muslim forces was also admitted today by 
Ferid Buljubasic, commander of the eastern Bosnia corps, and he 
sought help from the international community. 
  At 0900 this morning, the headquarters of the Serb forces 
says, two NATO aircraft violated the air space of the Srpska 
republic throughout the whole area of the upper Drina valley at 
the impermissible altitude of 600 meters. If this happens 
again, the headquarters of the Serb army says, such aircraft 
will be shot down. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 6 April carries within 
its regular 8-minute newscast several reports on the combat 
situation in the republic. 
  According to Gorazde correspondent Enes Murtovic, "the 
beginning of the ninth day of the latest and the fiercest 
offensive on Gorazde does not hold out hope that the 
Serbo-Montenegrins will easily give up their aim, which is to 
capture Gorazde. By capturing the town Slobodan Milosevic and 
Radovan Karadzic would round off the borders of the phantom 
Srpska republic, whose borders are marked with blood and [word 
indistinct] of innocent people from this region. Last night the 
aggressor fiercely attacked Borova and (?Gosun) with all 
available means from the direction of Ustipraca. Dobrijevici 
and Razalice were attacked from Mesici. After fierce fighting 
and after inflicting heavy losses on the aggressor, the 
defenders of Gorazde repelled several infantry attacks by the 
Chetniks between Ustipraca and Mesici." 
  Murtovic also reports that "this morning the Chetniks have 
continued their fierce attacks in the Gorazde area. All the 
front lines of the Gorazde defenders between Foca, Cajnice, 
Ustipraca, and Rogatica are being targeted. The Gorazde city 
center was spared destructive shells this morning, probably 
because General Michael Rose, commander of UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces], is expected to arrive here." 
  Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports that "since last 
night, Karadzic's terrorists have continued their artillery 
attacks in the Bihac region. The target of their artillery and 
tanks deployed in Grabez are Bihac and [words indistinct] 
surrounding area. Civilians and civilian houses, as well as 
vital communications, are again being targeted." 
  The correspondent also says that "on the front lines facing 
the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa autonomous 
region, small arms provocations and the shelling of the Cajnici 
area and Krivaja in the Cazin commune have continued." 
  According to a correspondent from the free territory of 
Brcko, "the Serbian aggressor has continued shelling the defense 
lines and regrouping his forces. Last night, the Chetniks 
attacked the central part of the Brcko defense lines with 60-mm 
and 82-mm mortars and portable rocket launchers."

<F P=106> [Enes Musovic report from Gorazde] </F>
  [Text] This is the eighth day that the Chetniks have been 
furiously attacking the free Gorazde territory. Their shells, 
like the whirlwind -- which is the name of the latest Chetnik 
offensive on the Gorazde territory -- have been claiming human 
lives almost every hour. There are hundreds of wounded people. 
Streams of blood and tears are literally pouring down the 
streets of Gorazde and the surrounding villages. The Drina 
River valley is resounding to the sound of explosions of 
destructive shells of the largest calibers [words indistinct] 
murdered, mutilated, and forlorn. Terror can again be seen on 
the faces of the survivors. 
  Distress, tears, cries can be heard in the war hospital in 
Gorazde. The rooms and corridors in medical institutions are 
crowded. Additional facilities in the village and communal 
areas are also packed as the wounded keep arriving. Some 30 
seriously wounded are ready for evacuation, two of them are 
urgent cases. Two surgeons, one anesthetist, and one 
anesthesiologist from the Medicins sans Frontieres, with the few 
but always present local doctors and medical staff have been 
doing miracles. Many lives have been saved even with the 
minimal conditions that exist in the Gorazde hospitals. There 
is no adequate medical equipment, not enough medicine, no 
sanitary material, no water, but there are many volunteers 
giving blood who have done a lot so far. One should say that 
the medical staff, although few in numbers, has been deployed in 
all the field hospitals and are with the brave Gorazde defenders 
on the most prominent positions facing the cutthroats of the 
aggressor's army.

  [Text] According to a decision by the government's Office 
for Displaced Persons and Refugees, on 1 April 1994 refugees 
from Mostar lost their refugee status in the Republic of Croatia 
and will have to leave hotels and holiday facilities in the 
areas of Ploce and the Makarska riviera, the Ploce regional 
Office for Displaced Persons and Refugees has announced. 
  The majority of the 2,000 refugees from the Mostar area have 
been accommodated in hotels and other holiday facilities. 
Because of the Easter vacation, many learned about this 
decision too late to leave. Many whose homes have been destroyed 
have expressed concern about the decision because they have no 
home to return to.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 6 (TANJUG) -- Officials of the 
Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) have termed "sheer media ploy and 
distortion" the manner in which THE WASHINGTON POST has 
interpreted their statements. 
  RSK Foreign Minister Slobodan Jarcevic and Parliamentary 
Foreign Policy Committee Chairman Lazar Macura have said that 
their statements made to WASHINGTON POST's journalist John 
Pomfrit were "rephrased to suit the Croatian or possibly 
American view of things," and that "vital parts were omitted, 
ones which reflect the realistic positions of Serb politicians," 
the RSK news agency ISKRA said on Tuesday. 
  The U.S. daily said in an article in connection with the 
effectuation of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities 
between the RSK and Croatia on April 4 that the RSK was showing 
growing readiness, in exchange for broad autonomy, to agree to 
live together with Croats and be under Zagreb's sovereignty. 
  However, the RSK maintains that the ceasefire agreement in 
no 
way prejudices a political solution to the problem. 
  ISKRA quoted Jarcevic as saying that he had stated to THE 
WASHINGTON POST journalist that he would resign his post in the 
RSK government if the incredible was to happen and the Serb 
state was to agree to negotiate on autonomy, a federation or 
confederation with Croatia. THE WASHINGTON POST, however, 
interpreted Jarcevic as allegedly saying that he would be the 
first to return to Belgrade if the RSK was to lose its 
independence. 
  Macura, who stated that Krajina could be part of Croatia 
only 
if the big powers were to make Croatia be part of a new 
Yugoslavia and if Krajina was to have political autonomy in the 
new state, was interpreted in THE WASHINGTON POST as allegedly 
saying that the Krajina Serbs could live as citizens of Croatia 
if Croatia was to guarantee them equal rights. 
  The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 in response to Croatia's 
forcible secession from the then Yugoslav Federation and the 
attempts of Croatian authorities to deny the Serbs the status of 
a constituent people and reduce them to a national minority. 
  In mid-March this year, after three years of war and 
Croatia's four attempts to impose its authority in the RSK by 
means of force, the two sides signed an agreement on the 
cessation of hostilities.

weekly EKONOMSKA POLITIKA. In his interview, Mr. Gligorov speaks 
extensively also of the Greek embargo, pointing out that its aim 
is for Macedonia to accept the conditions given by Athens, which 
leads to identity loss of a nation and to destabilization of the 
region. He rejects the thesis that the Americans want Macedonian 
military bases to be given up to them in compensation for $1 
million. He also decidedly rejects the thesis that Washington 
requests Macedonia to join any of the state creation that are 
being formed on the territory of former Yugoslavia.

  [Excerpt] Ljubljana, 5 Mar (TANJUG) -- The Ministry of 
Communications of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
[FYROM] has banned the Slovene company, Adria Airways, from 
transporting passengers and goods from the FYROM to third 
countries. 
  From today, Adria's aircraft may fly from the FYROM only on 
regular flights to Slovenia and back. Air crews are allowed to 
stay overnight in Skopje. 
  The FYROM is demanding from Slovenia the same conditions for 
its air passengers [sentence as received]. 
  In a liberally minded way, Skopje and Ljubljana have until 
recently been promising great tolerance in reciprocal business 
and other contacts, especially in trade. Over the past few 
months, however, there have been an increasing number of 
obstacles to business between the two economies with each 
wanting to make a profit off of the other. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The group of seven Slovene citizens is still on 
hunger strike at the Cankar Hall in Ljubljana. They claim that 
they will continue insisting that President Milan Kucan resigns 
and that the authorities hold early elections. 
  Four of the people are employed and have taken regular 
annual 
leave for the time during the strike. Talking with one of the 
strikers, Jernej Jung, we learned that they were visited today 
by representatives of the Red Cross, Janez Jansa, and Marjan 
Podobnik. The strikers are visited regularly by doctors. 
According to the strikers themselves, their health is 
satisfactory so far.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] A trade agreement was concluded 
between Slovenia and Hungary. Kata Peli Nagy reports from 
Ljubljana: 
  [Peli Nagy] In six years time, Hungary and Slovenia will 
trade industrial products without customs duty and other trade 
obstacles. Although the agreement will come to force on 1 June, 
the process of dismantling customs levies will take place 
gradually. [passage omitted] 
  Through this agreement, which was signed about an hour ago 
by 
Bela Kadar, minister of international economic relations, and 
Slovenian Deputy Prime Minister Davorin Kracun in the government 
office in Ljubljana, an unhampered economic cooperation was 
established between the two countries. [passage omitted] 
  During the two years of its independence, Slovenia has 
increased its trade with Hungary by 20 percent. [passage 
omitted] The value of Slovenian exports to Hungary last year was 
$62 million and Hungary's exports to Slovenia was $139 million.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 5 (TANJUG) -- Two members of the 
civilian police and three armoured personnel carries of the U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) stationed in the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) on Monday [4 April] twice violated 
the territory of Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), the Yugoslav 
Army said in a statement on Tuesday. 
  Around noon on Monday, two UNPROFOR civilian policemen and a 
local interpreter illegally entered three kilometres into 
Yugoslav territory in a motor vehicle, the statement said. 
  Because of the illegal entry to Yugoslavia, they were taken 
to the Slavujevac border post to explain the reasons of their 
presence there. 
  Around 2:30 p.m. on the same day, three UNPROFOR armoured 
personnel carriers [APC] illegally entered 300 metres into 
Yugoslav territory, the statement said and added that the APCs 
returned to their base in FYROM after an energetic action of 
Yugoslav border guards. 
  This is the second time this year that the U.N. peacekeepers 
deployed in FYROM have violated Yugoslavia's territorial 
integrity. 
  In mid-January, two U.N. APCs manned with two U.S. and 
three Norwegian soldiers illegally penetrated 500 metres deep 
into Yugoslavia, also close to the Slavujevac border post. 
  About 800 U.N. peacekeepers, mainly from the United States, 
were deployed last year in FYROM which unilaterally seceded from 
the former Yugoslav Federation in 1991, to protect the 
newly-formed state from an alleged threat coming from its 
northern neighbour Yugoslavia. 
  The U.N. commander in FYROM said in his reports to the U.N. 
secretary-general, however, that no danger is coming from the 
north and that the Yugoslav-Macedonian border is calm and stable. 
  Some opposition parties in FYROM have urged Skopje to deny 
hospitality to the U.S. troops "because their presence has 
brought nothing good to any nation in the world: They brought 
neither peace nor calm, but only the loss of sovereignty, war, 
death, drugs and other troubles."

  [Text] Belgrade, 5 Apr (TANJUG) -- Around 1115 hours 
yesterday morning Yugoslav Army border guards arrested three 
persons belonging to the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
civilian police in the village of Slavujevac, three kilometers 
away from the border between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
[FRY] and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], 
because they had crossed the border without authorization, the 
information service of the Yugoslav Army General Staff says in a 
statement issued today. 
  Two policemen and a female interpreter who illegally crossed 
the state border in a motorized vehicle were kept in the 
Slavujevac watchtower where they were questioned about their 
motives and reasons for crossing into FRY territory. Around 
1430 hours three UNPROFOR armored personnel carriers entered 300 
meters into FRY territory. Following an energetic action by 
Yugoslav Army border guards, the armored personnel carriers were 
returned to their base on FYROM territory, the statement says.

  [Excerpts] Pristina, 5 Apr (TANJUG) -- The public 
prosecutor's office in Pristina today requested the district 
court to begin an investigation into the activities of six 
ethnic Albanians charged with undergoing military training in 
Albania for several months and with preparing to join Albanian 
paramilitary units in Kosovo and Metohija with the objective of 
forcefully seceding from the Republic of Serbia and the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia and joining with Albania. [passage 
omitted] They have all been remanded in custody. 
  For several months during 1992 and 1993, the group took part 
in military training in the village of (Ljabinot Fus), near 
Elbasan [in Albania], organized by the Tirana office of the 
self-proclaimed "government" of the phantom "Republic of Kosovo." 
  Albanian Army officers organized military training for the 
arrested group, in addition to a large number of other persons 
of the Albanian national minority from the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. They 
were trained how to handle all sorts of infantry weapons, 
armored vehicles, tanks, explosive devices, and how to carry out 
sabotage actions. 
  Having completed their training, these future members of the 
paramilitary formations of the Albanian separatist movement in 
Kosovo signed declarations saying they would, immediately upon 
receiving call-ups and after the break up of armed clashes 
between ethnic-Albanians and Serbs, report to the barracks where 
they were trained. 
  According to a statement by the deputy district public 
prosecutor in Pristina, Jovica Jovanovic, representatives of an 
"office" of the self-styled "Republic of Kosovo" in Tirana, Ali 
Alija, Mehmet Kraja, and Zumber Berisa, mediated the sending of 
this group to be trained in Albania. They subsequently visited 
them in the training center and instructed them on the goals of 
these activities. 
  One of the arrested, Nedzmedin Sadriju, completed his 
intelligence training which is being carried out in the Albanian 
center of Ljac. 
  Our bodies of prosecution, Prosecutor Jovanovic says, are in 
possession of indisputable details about several dozen 
ethnic-Albanians from Kosovo and Metohija who completed military 
training in Albania. A group of eight people who were arrested 
and sentenced in mid-1992, after completing their military 
training in the village of Surela near Tirana, smuggled into 
Kosovo and Metohija 74 automatic rifles with 14,000 bullets and 
a large quantity of military equipment. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Statement by President Ion Iliescu at the opening of a </F>
joint news conference with Republic of Serbia President Slobodan 
Milosevic in Bucharest on 5 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] We have hailed the presence of President Milosevic 
in the context of the good and traditional relations that are 
prevailing between our countries. In the past four years since 
the December 1989 revolution, there have been numerous contacts 
between us. President Slobodan Milosevic is visiting Romania 
for the second time. He visited Romania in 1992 and I have 
visited Belgrade twice in this period. Our relations have a 
longstanding tradition and are positive from every point of 
view. Throughout history, including the more recent history, 
Serbia and Yugoslavia have been Romania's best neighbors. We 
have never had conflicts or any type of dissensions. There have 
always been feelings of friendship and solidarity in relations 
between our peoples. These relations continued to develop after 
the December 1989 revolution and the economic relations between 
our countries also registered an upward course until the 
establishment of the embargo. 
  First of all, we followed with great concern and awareness 
the tragedy that people in the former Yugoslavia and in the 
republics which have emerged in Yugoslavia had to face and are 
still facing today. We believe that it is a real tragedy that 
our neighbor has had to face and this human tragedy still 
continues. We have always believed that the only solution is to 
find ways out from the state of conflict solely through 
political and peaceful means. The way of force, of military 
conflict, or of taking measures such as the embargo -- which is 
also a measure of force -- are not meant to ease actions of 
finding solutions to the problem. On the contrary. The 
situation in Yugoslavia has just confirmed this. 
  Therefore, we have hailed all elements of realism that have 
appeared in the meantime and that are aimed at supporting the 
efforts made by internal forces, which are directly interested 
and are the only ones able to find the best ways to solve this 
conflict. 
  During our talks, we tried to find out in what way the 
leadership of Serbia regards the evolution of the situation in 
Yugoslavia, including the conflict in Bosnia, and the effort 
made to find political and peaceful solutions to problems. 
  We have also discussed bilateral relations and preparations 
made by the two sides for the period that will follow the 
lifting of the embargo, because we believe that, in the 
situation that has been created today in the area of the former 
Yugoslavia, the lifting of the embargo is an important element 
in the process of creating premises for finding peaceful 
solutions to the conflict. 
  We also expressed the belief that we should be prepared, so 
that immediately after the lifting of the embargo we should be 
able to resume normal relations in the economic area and be able 
to diversify and revive these relations. 
  In 1992, until the embargo was imposed, for five months the 
volume of exchanges between our countries reached over $260 
million. We estimate that after the lifting of the embargo we 
will be able to reach easily a volume of $1 billion in our 
bilateral relations, even as early as the first year after the 
embargo. Likewise, we believe that the positive relations 
between our countries, under conditions of peace in the region 
of former Yugoslavia, will be a stabilizing, positive, and 
constructive factor in our efforts to develop dynamic economic 
relations in our area, with all the new states that have been 
formed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and with 
Bulgaria, Greece, and the other neighboring countries in our 
region. Thus, we wish to make preparations for such prospects. 
  In the same spirit we discussed the issue of finalizing the 
process of drafting the text of a treaty of friendship and 
cooperation between our countries, which should be concluded in 
the near future and should be signed at an appropriate time, 
within a framework that we are going to establish mutually. 
  Hence, we believe that the visit paid by President Slobodan 
Milosevic to our country and the talks we have held represent a 
significant political element for the relations between our 
countries and a constructive factor in the joint efforts aimed 
at promoting a climate that is favorable for the normalization 
and development of a political climate in this region of joint 
interest.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jan Slota, chairman of the Slovak National </F>
Party, by Robert Casensky and Michal Musil in Bratislava; date 
not given: "Slovak National Party Chairman Jan Slota: `Prague 
Is a Bastion of Dark Forces'"] 
  [Excerpts] [DENNI TELEGRAF] Do you believe that the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] will win the elections 
and Vladimir Meciar will return to power for the third time? 
  [Slota] The HZDS will achieve the largest percentage of 
votes, in my opinion. That is what I believe. I am convinced 
of this because, in the course of the past two weeks, I have 
taken part in several conferences in the east and south of 
Slovakia--in the Magyarized city of Filakovo, for example, where 
Slovaks represent 30 percent of the population. I think that my 
prediction that the Slovak National Party [SNS] would win 
between 15 and 18 percent of the vote is realistic. If we 
assume that the HZDS might reach approximately 30-35 percent of 
the vote, this would essentially mean the possibility of forming 
a majority [HZDS-SNS] government. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] Where lies the originality of your party 
that might have it attract 15 percent of voters, as you predict? 
  [Slota] The SNS is the oldest political party in Slovakia, 
with a tradition of over 130 years. From the very beginning, we 
have pursued the main programmatic goal of obtaining for Slovaks 
the rights of a state-forming nation, even though it was not a 
state-forming nation at the time. [passage omitted] We have 
achieved statehood and have a Slovak Republic, yet the rights of 
a state-forming nation have not yet been achieved, and the 
interests of Slovaks remain unfulfilled. We still cannot say 
that these interests are clear and comprehensible to the nation. 
This is because there still exist forces posing as 
representatives of this nation that, by their interests and 
their conduct, are seeking the exact opposite. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] How do you assess the dismissal of the 
former Meciar-led government and your subsequent transfer to the 
opposition? 
  [Slota] I would call it a normal putsch. It was a normal 
putsch staged by people who no longer had any business being in 
this parliament. They had betrayed their own parties and 
movements. They had betrayed their programs and voters. The 
voters did not vote for people but for programs. They voted for 
a program and for a party. Had these people in parliament been 
men of principle, they would have left parliament. But, instead 
of leaving, they staged a putsch. There was no political 
destabilization in Slovakia [as claimed by the then opposition]. 
They overstepped the borders that would bring about a 
stabilization of the situation. 
  It is self-evident in Western parliaments that a deputy who 
leaves his political party can only act as an independent 
deputy. On no account can he set up a new party because he did 
not receive anyone's mandate to do that. They represent only 
themselves. They do not represent any voters because, at the 
time of the elections, there did not exist any alliance or 
democrats [reference to Alliance of Democrats, set up by 
deputies who broke away from the HZDS]. Whom do they represent? 
No one. [passage omitted] We all speak about democracy and 
brandish the word in all its variations enough to make you sick. 
For example, who will ever remember that the French Government 
adopted a discriminatory language program that runs clearly 
counter to the Copenhagen [CSCE] agreements? No one criticizes 
that; it is completely in order. But, when the Slovaks want to 
enshrine some language as official, the world almost collapses 
and the globe almost begins to turn in the other direction. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] Why did Vladimir Meciar not obtain the 
necessary number of signatures for a referendum on excluding 
these "defectors" from parliament? 
  [Slota] We naturally accept that Michal Kovac is the head of 
the Slovak Republic. Nevertheless, I cannot help but say, in my 
capacity as deputy, that, when we discount various provocateurs 
who made deliberate mistakes, 350,000 out of the 420,000 
signatures that had been collected were definitely legally 
valid. I daresay, however, that, even had there been 700,000 
valid signatures, the president would have found some pretext 
not to call the referendum. I am convinced of that. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] Under the Constitution, however, the 
president must call a referendum when there are 300,000 [figure 
as published, correct figure is 350,000] signatures asking for 
one. In other words, one could almost speak about fraud in this 
case. 
  [Slota] You were the one who said that. I clearly said that 
he would have found a pretext. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] Speculations have appeared in the Czech 
press about attempts by the Czech Social Democratic Party to 
restore Czecho-Slovakia. 
  [Slota] I beg your pardon, these are utopian delusions. I 
personally think that the best thing for the Slovak and Czech 
nations would be to cooperate, but with everyone staying in his 
own backyard. [passage omitted] 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] How do you personally assess the fact that, 
through the medium of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], 
former communists have returned to government after less than 
five years? The same thing has happened in Poland. and 
everything suggests that the situation in Hungary will not be 
too different. 
  [Slota] Look, I am known for being an anticommunist out of 
principle. Naturally, I am not pleased by this and regret very 
strongly that these "neocommunists" have regained power after 
such a short time. This is very dangerous, also from the 
viewpoint that, if left-wing forces are victorious in Hungary as 
well, a left-oriented bloc would again come into being. I 
personally believe that this is one of the greatest dangers, not 
just for Slovakia but also for Central Europe as a whole. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] Shortly before the declaration of the 
Slovak state, you supposedly said that those who opposed the 
declaration of Slovakia's independence would be steamrollered 
and tried in court. Could you return to that statement, provided 
you actually made it? 
  [Slota] I said it in a completely different context. About 
two sentences were torn out of the interview. It was an 
instance of irresponsible work by journalists. I am convinced 
that they are paid by certain forces in the Czech Republic 
because Prague is a bastion of these forces, which always try to 
portray people with different opinions in such black colors. 
Unfortunately, one who gives such an interview and does not 
authorize it does not have a chance to comment on its text--for 
example, when he is abroad at the time of publication--so they 
portray him in such colors as their character and ethics permit. 
I can only add that I meant it figuratively when I said then 
that people opposed to Slovak statehood would be steamrollered. 
And the Public Against Violence [VPN] movement, which was a 
clear advocate of the Czechoslovak state from the very 
beginning, really has been steamrollered. What I said then in 
figurative terms has become a reality. As for the courts, I 
would really protest fundamentally against such a statement 
being attributed to me. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] Your unusual assessment of Mr. Zhirinovskiy 
has intrigued the public. Could you return to this issue and 
tell us whether the assessment that appeared in the press was 
not distorted? You have supposedly invited him to Slovakia. 
  [Slota] Because I am an honest person, I reply to every 
journalist. When I was asked directly my view of Zhirinovskiy, 
I replied: "He is an interesting man." And, because I am a 
dynamic person, they immediately started portraying Zhirinovskiy 
and me as good friends and such. In my entire life, I have 
never seen him with my own eyes, nor have I ever heard him with 
my own ears. I only know his picture from television and the 
commentaries about him. The only thing I have claimed is: 
Zhirinovskiy is an interesting man. The whole world writes 
about him. Were he not interesting, they would not write about 
him and would not show him on all of the television channels. 
Is he interesting, or is he not? In my opinion, he is. And I 
do not know what is wrong with saying that, whether my attitude 
toward him is positive or negative. As I have said already, I 
do not have any attitude toward him. That is all. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] And what about the invitation? 
  [Slota] I do not know of any invitation. If someone from 
Slovakia has invited him, I do not know about it. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] How do you assess current Slovak-Hungarian 
relations? 
  [Slota] Look, relations between Slovakia and Hungary should 
be, first and foremost, friendly. When these relations are 
unfriendly, it is to the detriment of both sides. Unfortunately, 
there exist certain forces--naturally, on the Hungarian 
side--that bring permanent pressure to bear on Slovakia, with 
their excessive demands. I was in Filakovo, and the Slovaks 
there are afraid. They represent 30 percent of the town's 
population and are afraid of saying anything critical about the 
Hungarians. They are afraid and frightened. It is abnormal for 
a member of the state-forming nation to be afraid on his own 
sovereign territory. It is absurd. Look, the Czechs had the 
very same problems [with the Sudeten Germans] in 1938, and they 
managed to cope with them. This is not to say that I agree with 
the system that was used. I disagree with it, of course, with 
the killing of the civilian population and all that. You know, 
everyone should therefore sweep his own doorstep first and only 
then criticize someone else. They deported 3.5 million people, 
and you are going to advise us on how to deal with the situation 
in southern Slovakia. This is not well intentioned, to put it 
moderately. The Benes decrees should definitely be abolished. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] So it is the existence of Benes that is a 
problem for you and, naturally, also for us? 
  [Slota] I personally believe, and have said so on a number 
of occasions, that speaking about Benes is a waste of time. He 
always had some plan [plan] and it was called airplane 
[aeroplan]. [sentence as published] The entire Czech nation had 
to pay dearly for this man. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] Slovakia, too? 
  [Slota] Of course, indirectly and by proxy, Slovakia had to 
pay, too. After all, he made it possible for the communists to 
seize power. Had he been a man of principle, developments might 
have taken a completely different course. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] A while ago you spoke about journalists who 
distort statements, and not just yours, and about your 
conviction that they receive their pay from certain circles. 
Could you be somewhat more specific? 
  [Slota] You are asking me something that you should be able 
to answer yourselves. Ask yourselves who is paying you. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] Thank you for the interview.

  [Text] I am convinced that there will be joint maneuvers of 
our troops and North Atlantic Pact troops before the year is 
out, Minister of National Defense Piotr Kolodziejczyk said after 
meeting U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Rey. The meeting was the first 
opportunity to put into effect the agreements signed during the 
minister's U.S. trip. A joint defense affairs commission will 
be set up in May. It will tackle, among other things, the 
restructuring of the Polish arms industry. 
  [Correspondent] The representatives of both states talked 
about the possibilities of making practical use of the 
Partnership for Peace in military cooperation betwen both 
states, and the issue of security in our part of the world. 
  [Begin recording] [Rey in English fading into Polish 
translation] We have specifically discussed the possibility of 
joint maneuvers. Such an undertaking requires a detailed plan. 
We will be working on it. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] We are presenting the whole range of 
training 
undertakings we will implement this year, which are being 
implemented by the Polish Army, and the U.S. side will indicate 
which undertakings it wishes to take part in. All this will 
require the appropriate preparation, also on the staff side, so 
that there will be no disharmony. This means harmonizing the 
communications networks, the command systems, on some sort of 
chosen scale, and this will be the first very important step, 
very important experience for our Polish Army. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] Ambassador Rey mentioned the proposal that 
the Americans should finance a modern air navigation system but 
did not give any specific information on when and how this would 
come about.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 5 Apr (TANJUG) -- Vladimir Lukic, prime 
minister of the Srpska republic, told TANJUG today that the 
authorities of the Srpska republic have taken all measures to 
bring to justice the perpetrators of the deplorable events in 
Prijedor as soon as possible. 
  "Some international humanitarian organizations were in a 
rush 
to make the Prijedor events into a spectacle, with the clear 
intention of accusing the authorities of the Srpska republic of 
attempting to carry out a systematic eviction of the Muslim 
population," Lukic said. He added that although there have been 
some excesses, the civilian and military authorities of the 
Srpska republic have been doing everything to minimize their 
number. 
  "It is regrettable that the international humanitarian 
organizations do not see the real state of affairs on the 
territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is a fact that the 
human rights of Serbs living in Muslim and Croat territories are 
under much greater threat," Lukic said, citing as an example the 
position of the Serbs in Sarajevo, Konjic, Zenica, and Tuzla. 
  He stated that the best confirmation of the situation 
regarding human rights and the rights of national minorities is 
the fact that many Muslims do not wish to leave the territory of 
the Srpska republic, because they feel completely safe and 
protected.

<F P=106> [Article by Michel Viatteau] </F>
  [Text] Knin, Croatia, April 5 (AFP) -- Both separatist Serb 
forces and Croatian troops were respecting Tuesday [5 April] a 
day-old ceasefire in the breakaway republic of Krajina, UN 
Protection Force [UNPROFOR] officials said here. 
  UNPROFOR's Colonel Geroge Oehring, who visited the area 
Monday, when the truce began, said the withdrawal of heavy 
weapons had almost been completed ahead of the Tuesday morning 
deadline set for this pullout. 
  "The withdrawal of weapons occurred and is still occurring. 
Most importantly, we had guns silent this night, first time 
since last September," said the Canadian officer, the UN 
military commander for the area. 
  According to the agreement which took effect Monday morning, 
Croatian army forces and secessionist Serbs had until 0700 GMT 
Tuesday to withdraw all their heavy weapons from an agreed area. 
  The ceasefire accord between the two sides was reached last 
month after negotiations at the Russian embassy in Zagreb, 
ending some two years of war in the region. 
  Oehring said Serb weapons still in the area near Licka were 
not completely withdrawn because of technical problems -- the 
Serb separatist forces underestimated the amount of time it 
would take to move the weapons. 
  "The ceasefire is working, it is a cause for celebration," 
said Oehring. "Both sides are seriously following the 
agreement," he added. 
  By Friday, April 8, the two sides should have established a 
demilitarized zone two kilometers (1.2 miles) wide. UN forces 
will patrol this zone, Oehring said. 
  He confirmed that the Croat airport at Zadar-Zemunik, closed 
because of Serbian artillery fire, had been reopened to civilian 
flights. Regular flights from Zagreb to Split were to resume 
soon, he said. 
  Separately, UNPROFOR civilian affairs coordinator Enrique 
Aguilar and EU military observers' chief Jean-Pierre Thebault, 
said they hoped the two sides would meet in the next few weeks 
to discuss economic cooperation.

  [Text] A new wave of Serbian repression in Kosova. 
Deputies of the parliament of the Republic of Kosova have 
recently been targets of police expeditions. For more, our 
correspondent Sherif Konjufca: 
  [Konjufca] During the last week alone, 30 Albanian families 
were raided in the Kallamoc, Serpeve, Drenoc, Karashnik villages 
of the Malisheve commune. Among those raided was the house of 
Agim Bytyci, deputy of the parliament of Kosova. Gani Krasniqi, 
another deputy from this commune, a former prisoner of 
conscience for many years, and the chairman of the Communal 
Council for Finance, was among many who were maltreated. 
  The Serbian police behaved with brutality everywhere. On 
this occasion, the police damaged the houses and savings of the 
raided families and confiscated the passports and other 
documents of numerous inhabitants. 
  The police undertook similar actions in many localities in 
Ferizaj, in Prishtina, Suhareke, Obilisht, as well as against 
casual passers-by on the roads of Kosova. 
  Another form of Serbian repression against the Albanians, 
through which the ethnic cleansing of Kosova is carried out, is 
the seizure of Albanian homes. Dr. Bardhyl Caushi, professor of 
the Prishtina University and chairman of the Kosova Jurists' 
Independent Association, was added to the great number of those 
whose homes were seized. 
  At the same time, as reported by the BUJKU newspaper, a 
Serbian Army unit has been stationed in Mulliq village, in the 
border area between Kosova and Albania. This unit is causing 
great problems for pupils and inhabitants of the Potok village. 
  On the other hand, the militant Serbian Association of 
Bozhur 
asked the Serbian highest authorities to send an official note 
to Albania, informing that allegedly 280,000 Albanian nationals 
and an even greater number of their followers live on Serbian 
territory.

<F P=106> [Interview with Albanian President Sali Berisha by Reis Cico </F>
aboard the presidential aircraft returning from Turkey on 6 
April-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Albanian President Sali Berisha 
returned home today after his official visit to Turkey. 
  [Cico] Mr. President, what was the aim of your visit to 
Turkey? 
  [Berisha] I visited Turkey at the invitation of President 
Demirel. The main goal of my visit was to encourage and 
implement the further development of political, economic, and 
overall friendly relations between our two countries, as well to 
discuss regional problems. 
  I can say that relations between Albania and Turkey are 
proceeding well and developing quickly. These relations are 
such because first, there exists a sound and solid foundation 
for these relations, based on the powerful blood ties existing 
between Albania and Turkey, as well as on historical and 
cultural ties. In two years relations at the political level 
have assumed new dimensions and developed very well. Similarly, 
relations in technology and other fields are developing very 
well, quickly, and in a friendly spirit. On the other hand, 
economic cooperation and relations leave room for strengthening. 
  When I say economic cooperation, I should stress here that 
over the last two years, Turkey has given Albania considerable 
economic assistance, more than 35 million [currency not 
specified] in humanitarian and other aid. However, there is a 
lot of room for more economic cooperation. Regarding this, I 
insisted to both President Demirel and Prime Minister Ciller, as 
well as in today's meeting with investors in Istanbul, that 
Turkish investment is very welcome and will play a great role in 
bringing our two countries together. 
  [Cico] Mr. President, do you think that the goals of this 
visit have been achieved? 
  [Berisha] I think that they have been completely achieved. 
First, I should say that on a political level, the will is 
mutual and certain to develop relations further. Both sides are 
seeing with pleasure the rapid and harmonious development of 
these relations. In the same way, Albania and Turkey have the 
same views on the developments in the region. Both countries 
are making a real contribution to peace and stability on the 
Balkan peninsula. 
  Economic issues and problems occupied a special place in our 
discussions. I particularly insisted that the Turkish 
Government, the president, and prime minister encourage Turkish 
investment in Albania. There exists a full judicial basis, and 
this we improved with the agreement on avoiding double taxation. 
That is, there exists a judicial basis between the two 
countries on the rapid development of economic relations. I can 
say that for Turkish investors, and this point I also stressed 
in today's meeting in Istanbul, there are many sectors in which 
they can invest and make large profits in Albania. I insisted 
on economic ties through investment, because this is precisely 
the relations that will weld and increasingly strengthen the 
friendship and cooperation between the two countries. 
  We discussed the East-West corridor, which is a very 
powerful 
artery in the process of Balkan integration. We also discussed 
the possibility, or I insisted on the possibility, of soft 
credit on the part of the Turkish Government, so that Albania 
will be able to use it to set up its infrastructure. 
  Prime Minister Ciller and President Demirel promised that 
they would study the possibility of finding a mechanism to 
create such credit. 
  We also discussed the expanding and strengthening of air and 
naval ties. A new Tirana-Ankara airline will soon go into 
operation. They promised me that they would study the rapid 
establishment of naval ties. Thus, I think that another horizon 
is being opened in economic cooperation between our two 
countries, and I am very optimistic that this cooperation will 
have a future. 
  [Cico] Mr. President, do you think that Turkish investment 
will come to Albania to the extent that it will reach the level 
of political relations, which you stressed are much better than 
economic ones? 
  [Berisha] I hope that Turkish and other investment will come 
to Albania. I am optimistic that Albania is becoming an 
increasingly attractive country for foreign investors. Albania 
offers many advantages: an extremely favorable geographical 
position, excellent natural resources, a qualified labor force, 
a profitable labor market, and above all legislation based on 
freedom for the investor, the freedom of the individual, and the 
freedom of free enterprise. I think that all these factors, 
taken together with Albanian hospitality, in fact make Albania a 
small country geographically, not big from the geographic point 
of view, but a country with great chances for investment. I see 
with pleasure that this message is being increasingly clearly 
understood by Turkish, European, and world business and other 
circles. 
  [Cico] After the meetings that you held with top-level 
Turkish officials, it was declared that Albania and Turkey 
maintain the same position concerning regional problems. Can 
you tell us something more concrete about this? 
  [Berisha] First, I want to stress that Albania and Turkey 
are deeply interested in peace and stability in the region and 
have contributed and are contributing in this direction. I can 
say that Turkey has made a special contribution to the 
reconciliation between the Croats and Muslims. Months ago, the 
Turkish Government was engaged in and was one of the first to 
support the Washington Agreement on the creation of this 
[Bosnia-Herzegovina] federation. In this aspect, I am sure that 
the dispatch of Turkish troops to Bosnia will be a further 
contribution to the gradual stability of the region. 
  I would like others to render their own contribution. We 
particularly expect the Russians to convince the Serbs to join 
the agreement, because the signing of the agreement by the 
Serbian side will really be a decisive and very important moment 
in establishing peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In our talks, we devoted a special place to the solution of 
the Albanian question. Turkey, or I can say in Turkey, the 
dimension of this question is very clear. Of course, Albania 
and Turkey oppose the changing of borders through violence. 
However, I insist that the crisis in the Balkans cannot be 
solved without resolving the Kosova problem and without 
stability in Macedonia [Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM]. In this aspect, Turkey supports Albania's efforts for a 
peaceful solution to this problem, just as as it is interested 
in Macedonian stability. 
  I can say that we had a complete convergence of views and 
once again I want to thank my hospitable friends -- President 
Demirel and Prime Minister Ciller -- for the very warm and 
friendly reception that they extended to us. 
  [Cico] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by Rezear Xhaxhiu] </F>
  [Text] The Nano question was again placed at the center of 
the news conference that Socialist Party [PS] leaders gave for 
radio and mass media reporters today. 
  The statement issued by the General Steering Committee of 
this party, which was read by Bashkim Zeneli, considered the 
trial against Fatos Nano as a trumped-up trial that was 
finalized with an unjust decision. 
  The statement said that this decision was a logical result 
of 
an antidemocratic mentality of the present power and a 
consequence of the total submission of the judicial power to the 
political one. 
  Signed by members of the PS General Steering Committee, the 
statement considers Fatos Nano being locked in jail as an open 
wound in the body of Albania. The more it stays so, the 
statement ends, the worse it will be for Albania and the future 
of democracy. 
  Further on, they passed onto questions posed to the trio 
Pellumbi-Dokle-Zeneli, who addressed the conference. 
  Asked whether the Council of Europe representatives 
expressed 
interest on Nano's trial and the Nano question in general, Mr. 
Dokle answered that their interest was very special, but he did 
not prefer to give details of this stance maintained at a 
meeting that a group of socialist deputies held today with the 
Council of Europe envoys. 
  Answering another question, Dokle said that we will follow 
the judicial course of the Nano question, such as the appeal and 
the supreme court's verdict, though according to him, they do 
not cherish any special hope regarding the latter. 
  Asked whether Nano will remain the PS chairman and whether 
it 
is possible for him to lead the party from prison, the deputy 
chairman of the socialists, Servet Pellumbi, said that it is not 
a preoccupation whether Fatos Nano should be substituted or not. 
However, the trial showed that he has not besmirched his figure 
and the party he leads. That is why, Pellumbi continued, we see 
no reason to substitute him in the high post appointed by the 
congress. 
  He continued saying that the PS has no rigid concept of 
management by only one person, but in a collegial way. 
According to Pellumbi, friends have taken it upon themselves to 
compensate for Nano's absence. 
  Asked where the PS sees political elements in the Nano's 
trial, at a time when the indictment, summation, and verdict 
showed clearly the misappropriation of large sums and the 
falsification of official documents by Fatos Nano, Namik Dokle 
answered in a laconic way: The Nano question is a judicial 
attempt to eliminate the opposition. 
  In continuation, Pellumbi, Dokle, and Zeneli answered a 
series of questions from the audience that were related to early 
elections, the new political steps that the PS will undertake 
after the conviction of its chairman, its stance toward 
Albania's acceptance into the Council of Europe, and the 
existence of factions in the PS. Regarding the latter, Pellumbi 
answered that this cannot happen in the PS, because this party 
has been formulated as a real democratic party with free 
opinions and different stances.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bela Kadar, minister for international </F>
economic relations, by Sandor T. Bekes; place and date not 
given: "Bela Kadar on the NGKM's Four Years -- We Will Repeat 
Our Forefathers' Country-Renewing Activities"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Bekes] You have been 
leading the Ministry of International Economic Relations [NGKM] 
for four years. During this time, the activities of the 
ministry have been repeatedly attacked from time to time, now 
again by the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. Certain 
opposition politicians have stated that the NGKM should be wound 
up. What are your views on these accusations? 
  [Kadar] I have indeed been heading the NGKM's activities as 
minister since 1990 in implementing the change of the foreign 
economic system and emphasis, and the tasks of opening up the 
economy to the world. According to international assessments, 
Hungary has solved these problems more successfully than some 
other countries in the same situation. This is reflected in the 
essential elements of our economic diplomacy negotiations, in 
our foreign trade performance, in the number of enterprises by 
foreigners -- some 1,800 foreign ventures were operating in 
Hungary at the end of 1989 and 19,000 at the end of 1993 -- 
capital investment -- at the moment, foreign capital investment 
in Hungary exceeds $7 billion, which is 60 percent of the 
foreign capital invested in the East- Central European region -- 
and, in general, in the smooth operation of the ministry. After 
all this, I wonder why certain political forces and politicians, 
who are noticeably annoyed about the country's successes, have 
been wanting to eliminate the NGKM with a stubborn consistency. 
We are now dismissing the statements that are made regularly 
every month, showing that those who make them want to eliminate 
a professional culture. Even the most obstinate of these people 
have to admit that the ministry is doing a good job and its 
elimination would not result in budget savings. Therefore, 
"just because" remains the most convincing reason for 
eliminating the ministry. It is especially interesting to hear 
this from those who had very different views on this issue a few 
years before the elections. [passage omitted] 
  [Bekes] Can you please give a general assessment on 
Hungary's foreign economic performance over the past four years? 
  [Kadar] It should never be allowed to assess the foreign 
economy on the basis of subjective views because statistical 
information is available. As a result of the change of the 
regime, the U.S. dollar value of exports of the former CEMA 
countries was reduced by 10 to 60 percent between 1989 and 1992. 
In that period, only Hungary of the former socialist countries 
managed to exceed the peak export level of the 1980's. The 
exceptionally long Western recession, the decrease in Russian 
imports, the consequences of the south Slav [Yugoslav] war, and 
a Hungarian economic policy that had very little support for the 
foreign economy, caused a halt to the Hungarian export offensive 
in 1993. Our exports calculated in U.S dollars decreased by 17 
percent. The export-stimulating measures taken by the Hungarian 
Government in September 1993 have brought the improvement of the 
economy's competitiveness to the forefront. As a result of 
this, the 27-percent fall in the first half of 1993 had finally 
been dampened by the end of the year. In my view, the 
assumption is not without basis that these -- rather limited -- 
measures, in addition to slowing the decrease in 1993, have 
actually helped exports to start to increase in the first 
quarter of 1994. The fact is that certain members of the mass 
media who only yearn for bad news do not even bat an eyelid in 
saying that it is all success propaganda when I note that 
monthly exports in dollars exceeded the monthly average of the 
first three quarters of 1993 by 15 percent in November and 20 
percent in December 1993. [passage omitted] 
  [Bekes] You have said it many times -- also at the Uruguay 
Round of the GATT talks -- that the central axis of the world 
economy has moved away from Europe. What are the prospects of 
Hungarian foreign trade in the Pacific region and what can we 
expect on the traditional European markets? 
  [Kadar] For almost two decades, Hungary has been struggling 
with the problem that the focal point of the world economy and 
world trade increases have been shifted further away from 
Hungary to countries in the Pacific and the Far East. The 
resources and experience of the new domestic foreign trade 
salesmen and entrepreneurs do not yet make it possible for us to 
rely more on the Far Eastern markets, which are expanding more 
rapidly than the average. Naturally, Hungarian foreign economic 
policy has already been doing all it can to promote this, but we 
must not forget about the realities. In Hungarian foreign 
trade, the proportion of foreign economic cooperation with the 
world's most dynamically developing area will for a long time 
continue to reach only a few percent. Our place is in Europe. 
Some 90 percent of Hungarian foreign trade is with the 
countries of old Europe. In this area, it is a positive result 
that, except for Serbia and Montenegro, we managed to halt the 
decrease in turnover with our neighbors in 1993. In Russia and 
the CIS countries, the general crisis and slump are still having 
their effects. In the near future, we will extend our system of 
free trade agreements to Slovenia. We also assume that the 
improving economic situation in Western Europe, the lifting of 
the market restraints affecting Hungarian goods, and our free 
trade agreements will contribute to an increased Hungarian 
foreign economy and exports. The current major proportions show 
that, in 1993, some 47 percent of our exports went to the 
countries of the European Union [EU] and 14 percent to the 
countries of the European Free Trade Association [EFTA]. Our 
free trade agreement with EFTA has been in force for six months 
now. If the EU accepts Austria and the Scandinavian countries 
as members in 1995, nearly two-thirds of Hungary's exports will 
be going to the EU. This clearly indicates to what the 
Hungarian economy and society must adjust. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Hungarian Gallup Institute on </F>
Party Preferences in the Middle of March -- The MSZP Is Leading, 
the MDF's Support Has Decreased"] 
  [Text] Between 11 and 16 March 1994, the Hungarian Gallup 
Institute carried out a public opinion survey on the adult 
population's party sympathies using a sample of 2,500. The 
margin of error linked to the size of the sample is plus or 
minus 2 percent. The survey establishes that the proportion of 
people voting for the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] has 
continued to increase among those who selected a party. The 
Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] and the Christian 
Democratic People's Party [KDNP] are coming increasingly closer 
to the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], which has lost further 
"votes." The MDF leads the list of unpopular parties, with a 
third of people who have an opinion saying that they would by no 
means vote for this party. The MDF is followed by the FKGP and 
the MSZP. Two-fifths of people who tried to predict the final 
result of the elections think that the MSZP will receive the 
most votes at the May parliamentary elections. Significantly 
fewer people give a winning chance to the Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ] or the MDF, which follow the MSZP. 
  In the middle of March 1994, 24 percent of the population 
did 
not know which party they would vote for "if elections were held 
next Sunday in Hungary"; a tenth said that they would not vote, 
and 6 percent refused to answer this question. The uncertain 
people who do not (yet) know whom they would vote for are more 
common among women (28 percent) than among men (20 percent), and 
more among the over-60's (31 percent) and people with the least 
education (39 percent) than younger people (22 percent) and 
people who have at least completed eight years at school. 
Within this last group, the differences between the various 
educational levels are negligible because 23 percent of people 
with eight years of education and 20 percent of people with 
higher education do not know who to vote for. 
  Some 61 percent of the population has party preferences. 
  Some 31 percent of people who chose a party would vote for 
the MSZP, 4 percent more than in the previous month. The 
Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] and the SZDSZ are in 
second and third places with near equal support (15 and 14 
percent). Since the end of February, the MDF has lost 3 
percent, and at the time of the survey, it has the confidence of 
10 percent of potential voters. The biggest governing party is 
closely followed by the FKGP (9 percent) and the KDNP (8 
percent), and 12 percent would vote for other parties. Of these 
last ones, none would reach the necessary minimum to get into 
Parliament. 
  Gallup measures the certainty of participating in the voting 
on a scale of seven. In the middle of March, 52 percent of 
respondents said that "it is very certain that they would vote 
next Sunday." However, within these "certain" voters, 18 percent 
do not yet know which party to support. Out of those who do 
know, 35 percent would choose the Socialists and 15 percent the 
Free Democrats. The Fidesz and the MDF would be supported at 
almost the same level (12 and 11 percent respectively). The 
Smallholders would receive 8 percent, the Christian Democrats 7 
percent, and other parties 12 percent. If we examine the 
sympathizers of the various parties according to what proportion 
of them are "very certain" in participating in the elections, we 
have the following result: The MSZP's and the SZDSZ's potential 
voters are most determined about their intention to participate. 
Seventy-three percent of the former and 71 percent of the 
latter are very certain that they would vote. The MDF follows 
this line with 67 percent, then the FKGP (60 percent) and the 
KDNP (60 percent) with almost the same percentage. Half (49 
percent) of the Fidesz's voters are determined that they would 
go to vote "next Sunday." 
  The potential voters of the various parties also differ in 
how certain they are that they would vote for the currently 
preferred party "in the first round of the May parliamentary 
elections." Almost half (47 percent) of all people who selected 
a party are "very certain" about this: They would vote for the 
party they now sympathize with. A third (34 percent) of them 
are slightly less certain, they are "only" certain about this, 
and a fifth (18 percent) are "uncertain." Socialist 
sympathizers are most determined; 60 percent of the party's 
current supporters are "very certain" that their opinion will 
not change before the elections. Half of the Smallholder (51 
percent) and Hungarian Democratic (48 percent) voters are also 
determined, and 42 percent of the KDNP's and SZDSZ's voters each 
are very certain on this issue. Of the parliamentary parties, 
the Fidesz again is the last: A third (32 percent) of their 
current supporters are very certain that they would vote for 
this party, but almost as many (27 percent) are rather uncertain. 
  The survey also included the examination of secondary party 
preferences. People who chose a party were also asked "if, 
apart from this, is there another party that you would be happy 
to vote for?" and 29 percent of those questioned said that there 
is no such part and 7 percent said that they did not know. Out 
of those who named a party, the Fidesz was mentioned most 
frequently (22 percent), followed by the SZDSZ (18 percent). 
The rest were as follows: MSZP 13, KDNP 10, MDF 8, and FKGP 7 
percent. A fifth (22 percent) of those who replied mentioned 
other parties, most of them the Entrepreneurs' Party (5 
percent), the Republic Party (3 percent), and the Workers' Party 
(2 percent). 
  The individual candidates of the various parties cannot 
expect the same level of support as their parties. Naturally, 
in the case of all parties, the majority of people would 
"certainly" vote for the individual candidate of the preferred 
party, but the deviations are noteworthy. At least seven-tenths 
of the Socialist, Free Democrat, and Smallholder voters are 
certain (75, 72, and 70 percent) that they would vote for their 
party's list as well as its individual candidates. In the case 
of the MDF and the KDNP, 65 and 63 percent of people hold this 
view. Again, the Fidesz is the last, 59 percent of its 
potential voters would also vote for the party's individual 
candidates. 
  Examining antagonistic feelings to parties, Gallup asked 
people if "there is a party that they would definitely not vote 
for." Two-thirds (65 percent) of those surveyed selected a 
party from the list of 15 parties. The MDF was mentioned most 
often (33 percent), followed by the FKGP (21 percent). For a 
tenth (12 percent) of those who selected a party, the MSZP is 
out of the question, and almost as many reject the Workers' 
Party (9 percent) and the Hungarian Justice and Life Party 
[MIEP] (9 percent). Five percent would definitely not vote for 
the Fidesz, and 3 percent each for the SZDSZ and the KDNP. Half 
(52 percent) of the people who do not have a party preference 
also said "I do not know" to this question. Of the other half, 
the order of parties disliked is the same as above: MDF 28, 
FKGP 25, MSZP 14, MIEP 9, and Workers' Party 8 percent. 
  Some 41 percent of respondents did not venture to predict 
the 
final outcome -- which party will receive the most votes -- of 
the elections. The vast majority of those who made a prediction 
named the MSZP (40 percent). Twenty-two percent predicted 
victory for the SZDSZ, and 17 percent for the MDF. The Fidesz 
is expected by 9 percent as winner, the FKGP by 6 percent, and 
the KDNP by 3 percent. This result is somewhat different when 
the question applies to "your electoral district." In this 
case, half (50 percent) the population would not make a 
prediction. Out of those who did, 31 percent selected the MSZP 
as winner, 20 percent the SZDSZ, 14 percent the FKGP, and 12 
percent the MDF. Some 8 percent expect the Fidesz and 7 percent 
the KDNP to be winners in their electoral district.

<F P=106> [Article by Claudiu Harcioaga: "Restoration Is Being </F>
Prepared in the Army -- The Slave of the Power"] 
  [Text] A number of young army officers, the names of whom 
we will not disclose to protect them, have warned us that 
important changes will be carried out within the leadership of 
the Romanian Armed Forces. Thus, commanders of various units 
are to be replaced with "political commissaries of the Ceausescu 
era," under the pretext that during their lengthy careers and 
especially after 1989 the latter "distinguished" themselves by 
not making any mistakes. The same sources revealed that this 
genuine restoration is to take place with the consent of the new 
defense minister, Mr. Gheorghe Tinca, whom the military consider 
"the slave of the power," and that the move is part of Romania's 
"new" military orientation distinguishable over the past month, 
intended to establish a full-scale alliance with Russia. 
  Considering that Mr. Adrian Nastase [speaker of the Chamber 
of Deputies and executive chairman of the Social Democracy Party 
of Romania] is also pleading for the replacement of the army 
commanders appointed by the former defense minister [Lieutenant 
General Niculae Spiroiu], there are no more doubts left as to 
the efforts made by the state power to place the armed forces 
under its authority.

<F P=106> [Interview with Senator Radu Timofte, president of the </F>
Senate's Defense Commission, by Irinel Radulescu; place and date 
not given: "Foreign Intelligence Service Will Harm Neither the 
Citizen Nor His Rights"] 
  [Text] The draft law on the organization and 
functioning of the Foreign Intelligence Service [SIE] was 
submitted to the Permanent Bureau of the Senate last week. The 
legal initiative of the Commission for Defense, Public Order, 
and National Security is part of the package of laws that will 
form the necessary legal framework for the organization and 
functioning of an important component in the structure of the 
intelligence system. The document, which is the first legal 
project that refers to the Foreign Intelligence Service, is 
notable through a number of distinctive features compared to the 
document referring to the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI]. 
Thus, we asked Senator Radu Timofte, president of the Senate's 
Defense Commission, to comment briefly on this subject. 
  [Radulescu] Mr. Senator, the commission that you are heading 
has submitted the draft law on the organization and functioning 
of the Foreign Intelligence Service to the Permanent Bureau of 
the Senate. There was no such law during the interwar period in 
Romania and there is no such law in many other countries because 
the activity of the respective services is carried out only in 
accordance with internal operational rules. Then why is such a 
law necessary now? 
  [Timofte] The assistance of such a law is needed to enable 
us to oversee the organization and functioning of the SIE, 
because of the specific and complex nature of its activity, as 
well as because of the duty -- established by the Constitution 
and by the law on national security -- that an authorized body 
such as the SIE should operate in accordance with the law. 
Thus, we will coordinate our activity with the legislation 
currently effective in our country. According to the law on 
national security, the activity of the SIE will be organized and 
controlled by Romania's Supreme Defense Council and will also be 
supervised by the parliament. 
  [Radulescu] In connection with this parliamentary 
supervision, Article 2 of the respective law stipulates that 
this control will be carried out "through the special commission 
of the two chambers of the Parliament." Will a new commission 
be established or will the current "Vacaru Commission" take over 
this task as well? 
  [Timofte] Through this draft law, we are trying to enable 
the current commission that is in charge of supervising the SRI 
activity to expand its control over the SIE as well. This is 
the wish of those who initiated this document. However, I do 
not know to what extent the parliament will like this idea. I 
am already anticipating stormy debates on this subject, because 
many people will want the Parliament's Defense Commission to 
carry out this control of the SIE activity. The reason for 
choosing the "Vacaru Commission" for this job is linked to the 
wish and the need to limit the number of those who come into 
contact with and have access to information that the SIE is 
dealing with. 
  [Radulescu] However, by limiting the number of those who 
have access to such information, more power is given to the 
control commission, which will have access both to the SRI and 
the SIE information. How will the Parliament react to such a 
situation? 
  [Timofte] That is precisely why I said that there will be a 
heated discussion on this subject. My personal opinion is 
identical with the stipulation of the law. If the parliament 
rejects this idea, then the control over SIE will pass to the 
two defense commissions. 
  [Radulescu] What other sensitive articles are included in 
the respective law? 
  [Timofte] When the law was submitted to the Permanent Bureau 
of the Parliament, I requested that the Commission in charge of 
human rights should also be informed about it. Thus, I would 
like to stress the idea that in no way will the law on the 
organization and functioning of this service harm the citizen or 
his rights. Certainly, any of the articles of the respective law 
might become sensitive at one point and positive or negative 
examples from the legislation of other countries might be 
brought up at any time. I hope that no particular problem will 
be encountered before the law is endorsed, as long as this 
service carries out its activity in accordance with its own 
rules. We tried to avoid as many problems as possible. I could 
give you an example regarding the "way in which the service 
carries out covert activities." Had we not included such a 
stipulation in the draft law, useless and interminable 
discussions in the parliament on the issue would have followed. 
I would like to mention once again that it is not the law that 
has to include sensitive issues but the SRI regulations. 
  [Radulescu] Mr. Senator, compared to the SRI, the SIE seems 
to have a preferential regime, although it is also under the 
parliament's control. I am talking about the way in which 
reports are submitted and the level at which they are submitted. 
Could the SRI react to this or could there be an unprofitable 
competition between the two services? 
  [Timofte] According to the law, the opening of the SIE 
toward the parliament and the coordination of its activity by 
Romania's Supreme Defense Council is carried out annually or 
when the situation requires it. This is identical with the 
situation when the director submits a report on the way the 
service carries out its duty. The fact that the SRI submits 
reports to the parliament and the SIE to the Supreme Defense 
Council means precisely that access to information that cannot 
be made public is limited as much as possible. Debates on such 
a report in the parliament might have a negative effect on the 
activity of the service and even on national security. 
  Theoretically, there is no reason why this "discrimination" 
should stir adverse reactions because the SIE and the SRI are in 
charge of completely different areas, which exclude competition. 
It is true that both services carry out their activity in the 
field of national security, but one carries out its activity 
inside, the other one outside, the country. No competition can 
arise in such circumstances. One might rather talk about 
cooperation because, in the activity carried out beyond the 
country's borders, one could encounter such situations that 
might affect the country's internal situation. And this is the 
area in which the two services, I mean all the structures of the 
intelligence services, have to cooperate.

<F P=106> [Report by Dan Andronic: "The Former Head of the </F>
Counterespionage Division Discovered Where the SRI's Money Is 
Going"] 
  [Text] Despite the fact that several weeks have elapsed 
since the spectacular dismissal of Major General Gheorghe 
Diaconescu, the head of the SRI [Romanian Intelligence Service] 
Counterespionage Division, the sole explanation given by Major 
General Virgil Magureanu, the SRI director, was the lack of 
professionalism of the deposed official. That accusation seems 
to be childish, to say the least, considering that Major General 
Gheorghe Diaconescu worked in the field of counterespionage for 
decades and he was one of the fundamental members of the famous 
anti-KGB unit titled UM 0110. 
  Owing to the lack of openness of the SRI, we have to rely on 
other information to complete the picture of Major General 
Gheorghe Diaconescu's dismissal from his office as head of the 
SRI Counterespionage Division. According to such information, 
while investigating a number of cases in which foreign citizens 
were involved -- a task that was among his duties -- Major 
General Gheorghe Diaconescu stumbled across certain firms in 
which persons belonging to the SRI leadership, such as Major 
General Virgil Magureanu, the SRI director, and Major General 
Victor Marcu, the deputy SRI director, were also involved. 
  The famous filing box that was sealed [following 
Diaconescu's 
dismissal] by Major General Popa Ulpiu Cherecheanu, deputy 
general prosecutor, contains -- or contained -- files containing 
operative information, photographs, and audio and video 
cassettes proving the involvement of others, apart from the 
aforementioned persons in arms trafficking and other, not too 
clean deals. It is worth mentioning that the profit obtained 
from such deals is not to be found on SRI bank accounts, but 
rather on those of certain persons holding important state 
offices. 
  Details later.

<F P=106> [Article by Zoran Petrov: "The Thieves Are Not Among Us--We </F>
Are Among Them"] 
  [Text] Now there are already numerous indications, 
information, and above all, facts showing that organized crime 
exists in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM] and that among others, individuals from the Macedonian 
Government's ministries are involved in it. One of the most 
fundamental characteristics of organized crime is the brutality 
of its approach, and its basic method is corruption, and 
directly associated with it, blackmail, threats, and 
retaliation. 
  Macedonia is one of the few countries in the world where a 
person can get rich overnight, with just a single deal, 
arrangement, or transaction. Macedonia is one of the rare places 
in the world where the laws exist to be evaded, where everything 
that is not prohibited is automatically permitted, and where one 
does not go to jail for an illegal shop, for example, or for tax 
evasion. Macedonia is a sort of unique case, where directors 
open private firms as partners and competitors of socialized 
enterprises, where state officials are deeply involved in 
private business, and where the transformation of state property 
has been turned into universal theft. In such a legal vacuum, 
criminals, regardless of whether they are "white collar 
criminals" or common pickpockets, virtually obtain an alibi for 
their actions. The period of the transition from one system to 
another is full of risks and uncertainties, even when it is 
thoroughly prepared and outlined, and in circumstances like ours 
today, the danger is doubled. From any aspect, this is a time of 
various con men and worldly troublemakers. 
  In a situation like the present one, it is evident that 
there 
has been a rapid fragmentation of citizens and increasingly 
deeper dissatisfaction among the public with the striking cases 
of abuses, machinations, and speculations. The claims that the 
state authorities do not have a role in such dirty business are 
stories for little children. In a word, no matter how painful it 
sounds, the ancient system of a link between economic and 
political power is slowly coming onto the scene in the Republic 
of Macedonia; in turn, this is creating the preconditions for 
reviving the alliance between criminal circles and the state 
establishment, and in some countries that is called the mafia. 
Thus, in parallel with the newly established businessmen, 
murders for hire, threats, blackmail, kidnappings, "rackets," 
loan sharks, and drug smugglers, have appeared in Macedonia, 
i.e., everything that "embellishes" a classic mafia. 
<H5>  The Mafia Is in the Government or... </H5>
  "There is organized crime in Macedonia, and that has to be 
said openly for once," said Pavle Trajanov, assistant minister 
for operational affairs in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
What is significant in all this, in his opinion, is that 
organized crime has slowly begun to penetrate the state's 
executive branch, since criminal conduct in an organized manner 
is not possible unless the authorities participate in it, or in 
our case, individual ministries of the government of the 
Republic of Macedonia. As our interlocutor emphasized, there are 
several evident cases of machinations under the leadership of 
state bodies. 
  One of the most characteristic cases is the process of 
obtaining a location for the construction of a temporary or 
permanent building. The Ministries of City Planning, 
Construction, Transportation, and Ecology participate in issuing 
the building permit, and the Ministry of Economy for a permit to 
conduct business, and to these one must add the Ministry of 
Finance through the tax inspectorate, and the SOK [Public 
Auditing Service].... In this whole chain, where numerous abuses 
have appeared, as Trajanov said, it is impossible that some of 
the institutions cited are not involved. The case of importing 
products is even more specific. We have analyses for three years 
back of which firms received import permits and which amounts 
they imported, Trajanov said, from which it can be clearly seen 
that all these things revolve around a small number of 
enterprises which receive import permits, and then simply sell 
them to another firm and, naturally, in the end the money is 
shared with the one that provided the permit. In other words, 
the one who is closer to the authorities through any type of 
"closeness" gains a privileged status for earning a profit. 
Thus, there are no built-in criteria for all those who have an 
interest in importing; instead, protectionist measures are 
created, through which only a narrow circle of firms are 
patronized. I can state quite authoritatively that the executive 
branch bodies are behind all of this, Trajanov said 
categorically. This highly organized crime has been going on for 
two years, and high officials in both the production enterprises 
and the government are participating in it. According to the 
assistant minister of internal affairs, it is not possible for 
what is produced and what is marketed not to be recorded without 
the involvement of some government ministry, since the net 
profit from just one truckload of cigarettes is about 300,000 
German marks [DM]. The basic methodology of organized crime is 
bribery and corruption. According to our interlocutor, these 
modes are conducted today in a very perfidious manner. "We have 
a great deal of information," he emphasized, "that state 
officials, even government ministers, have private firms, 
usually in the name of a close relative, through which organized 
crime takes place. How? The method is very simple--first a 
permit is obtained for the transit or importation of certain 
goods into Macedonia, and then the trade in the goods is 
conducted through one's own firm. Formally, everything is within 
the law," Pavle Trajanov said, "but the genesis is in the 
ordinary abuse of one's position. Nevertheless," as our 
interlocutor emphasized, "the most modern form of organized 
crime is acting as a middleman." In other words, those who are a 
factor in decisionmaking only act as middlemen among two or more 
firms, and receive a commission in return. For example, if there 
is an offer from some foreign firm, for instance for exporting 
technical equipment needed by a certain ministry or other state 
institutions, then the "middleman" appears, and puts the foreign 
firm in touch with the domestic one and charges a commission for 
this. This, Trajanov said, constitutes a textbook case of 
corruption. 
<H5>  ...The Government Is in the Mafia </H5>
  "As police, our hands are tied by several things that keep 
us 
from dealing with organized crime efficiently," Pavle Trajanov 
said. In his opinion, it is impossible for the police, without 
cooperation with other supervisory bodies in the state, to act 
on their own in this area, and likewise, another big problem is 
the still incomplete legal regulations defining certain 
relationships in the state, which at the moment are actively 
being exploited by organized crime. Our limitation, our 
interlocutor emphasized, is the constitutional barrier according 
to which only letters can be monitored, while the monitoring of 
telephones and other means of communication is not permitted. If 
this does not change in a short time, and the use of these 
operational-technical means that would be used under strictly 
established legal conditions and by a decision by a competent 
judge is not permitted, we will only obtain information that we 
will be able to comment on, but it will be much more difficult 
for us to obtain evidence, without which criminal proceedings 
cannot be started, Trajanov stated categorically. 
  Now there are already various indications, information, and 
above all facts showing that organized crime exists in Macedonia 
and that above all, the state institutions of the executive 
branch are involved in it. All of this, Trajanov emphasized, 
does not force us as the police to restructure ourselves 
organizationally. It is planned that a special section will be 
formed soon at the Ministry of Internal Affairs that will deal 
exclusively with curbing organized crime, and that will possess 
all the necessary conditions for effective operation. That, 
above all, means its staffing and professionalization of its 
operation, as well as providing it with appropriate technical 
equipment. 
  "I want to emphasize," Trajanov said, "that the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs is seriously preparing and is already 
considerably involved in all these matters associated with 
organized crime. The Ministry of Internal Affairs," he added, 
"possesses an extensive body of information, and it is known 
quite well who is involved in these illegal activities, how, and 
why, including individuals who at the moment are in high 
government positions." 
<H5>  Parallel Rule by Organized Crime </H5>
  "Collective organized crime constitutes one of the forms of 
professional crime which is characterized by a close alliance 
between professional criminals and law enforcement officials," 
said Dr. Tome Batkovski, a lecturer at the Security School in 
Skopje. According to criminologists from Western countries, of 
which this form of professional crime has been and is most 
characteristic, organized crime could not exist without 
connections and assistance from politics and politicians. 
"Professional criminals' connections with government officials," 
Batkovski emphasized, "gives representatives of organized crime 
an enormous advantage over other criminals, precisely because of 
that protection that they have. There is actually a tremendous 
threat to the human rights of a large part of the population, 
just because the center of power goes outside the framework of 
the legal institutions." 
  The criminal areas of activity of collective organized crime 
consist of smuggling narcotics, white slavery, smuggling money, 
gold, and other valuables and cultural goods, smuggling weapons, 
carrying out paid killings, prostitution, gambling, and 
recently, selling ecological wastes. According to Dr. Batkovski, 
the characteristics of the illegal associations whose activity 
in practice is organized crime are the following: above all, 
internal organization, structure, the existence of internal 
standards of conduct with discipline in carrying out 
assignments, a division of duties, a broad radius of activity, 
high effectiveness with the use of modern methods, a high degree 
of maneuverability, and going beyond the national framework. 
Finally, according to Batkovski, one of the most fundamental 
characteristics of organized crime is the brutality of its 
approach, i.e., a lack of scruples, and its basic method is 
corruption, and directly associated with it, blackmail, threats, 
and retaliation. 
  Organized crime represents a tremendous social danger, above 
all because it introduces disorganization in the state, destroys 
the legal fabric of society, instills distrust among the legal 
state bodies, and in the case of smaller states, there is a 
danger of parallel rule by organized crime, which can have 
unforeseeable consequences for undeveloped countries, including 
Macedonia. According to Dr. Batkovski, the extent of the power 
of this form of crime is best illustrated by the case of the 
Colombian cocaine mafia, which offered to repay part of this 
country's foreign debt, in the amount of--believe it or not--$28 
billion. In return, the Colombian Government was supposed to 
refuse to extradite the captured heads of the drug mafia to the 
United States. Dr. Batkovski stressed that this is a vital 
example of the enormous power of organized crime. 
  "We are talking about an extremely serious matter, and I 
think that the struggle against this organized crime has to be 
an integral part of a national strategy in the broader sense," 
our interlocutor emphasized. "Without that, through palliative 
and partial solutions, nothing can be achieved," Tome Batkovski 
said in conclusion. 
<H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5>
<H5>  Batkovski: "Organized Crime Should Not Be Underestimated" </H5>
  "If we are talking about the struggle against organized 
crime, we should note once again that it possess enormous power 
and influence. It is precisely for that reason that it is always 
one step ahead of society in the use of modern methods and 
resources. That means that in curbing it, the state's expert 
bodies and services have to keep up to date, and stay in step 
with the methods and resources used by representatives of 
organized crime. From the standpoint of its organization, modern 
operational services have to be created that will be capable of 
maneuvering quickly and adapting to organized crime's methods 
and resources, but on the other hand, that requires a societal 
guarantee to the employees of these services--not just by 
ensuring the safety of their families, but also in their 
salaries, since it is an illusion that an employee with a salary 
of DM300 or DM400 will objectively be capable of dealing with 
illegal activities in which hundreds of thousands or millions of 
German marks are involved." 
<H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5>
<H5>  Trajanov: "Some Political Parties Are Also Financed by Dirty </H5>
Deals" 
  "I can authoritatively state that the mafia in Macedonia is 
assuming an increasingly larger scale and is threatening to grow 
into a parallel state government. Likewise, I stand behind the 
assertion that numerous people in authority are also involved in 
organized crime in our country, especially in the Macedonian 
government's ministries. Those who are now enriching themselves 
this way will slowly and surely achieve influence in political 
life as well. We already possess information that certain 
political parties are being financed by such dirty deals and 
`businesses.' In other words, someone who invests in a certain 
political party will subsequently demand compensation, i.e., 
greater political influence and participation in the division of 
power in the country. All the preconditions now exist for a high 
degree of corrosion in the state, and the consequences are truly 
extremely dangerous. Unless Macedonia urgently undertakes 
something in the area of legal regulations and the internal 
organization of all structures and supervising bodies, I think 
that in two or three years we will find ourselves in the same 
situation as some of the neighboring countries."

  [Excerpt] Knin, 6 Apr (TANJUG) -- In western Slavonia, both 
sides [Krajina Serbs and Croats] today started to withdraw heavy 
weapons 10 or 20 km, Officer Branko Opacic from the Serb Krajina 
army's general staff told TANJUG. 
  The withdrawal -- envisaged by the Zagreb cease-fire 
agreement -- had been delayed because of a misunderstanding 
concerning the interpretation of a number of clauses of this 
agreement, but all problems were resolved on the spot by joint 
commissions. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Milan Martic, president of the republic of </F>
Serbian Krajina, by B.A. and S.C. on 30 March; place not given] 
  [Text] On Wednesday morning, when it was announced 
that the Croats and the Krajina Serbs had signed a cease-fire, 
Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serbian Krajina, 
responded to NIN's request and answered a few questions by 
fax. 
  [NIN] Do you believe that the U.S. pressure, which resulted 
in the creation of a Muslim-Croat Federation, will have a 
crucial influence on the further progress of negotiations 
between Knin and Zagreb toward the establishment of (con)federal 
ties between the republic of Serbian Krajina and Croatia? 
  [Martic] The United States has shown great decisiveness in 
taking over the key role in solving the crisis in the area of 
the former Yugoslavia. We expect an even more intense 
manifestation of the political and diplomatic strength of the 
U.S. Administration in the coming period. This will have the 
goal of securing a sphere of interest in these Balkan regions. 
One cannot say that this will not affect the course of 
negotiations between Croatia and Krajina. This tone was already 
evident during the first two rounds of negotiations that were 
conducted in Zagreb, and in this sense, the United States will 
try to keep the initiative. Of course, we also have Russia's 
significant role, because it does not wish to be left aside, but 
it is clear that at the moment the United States has the leading 
role. I think it is still too early to discuss in what way the 
U.S. diplomatic initiative can influence the solving of the 
Krajina's political status. This latest peace package has three 
levels of negotiations. We have practically solved the first 
one by signing the agreement on the cessation of hostilities. 
This should be followed by negotiations on economic cooperation 
and communications, while the solving of the Krajina's political 
status has been left for the end. We are ready to participate 
in all of these negotiations, in the same way that we are ready 
to accept everything that is not in contradiction with the basic 
stances of our people and the negotiating platform adopted by 
the assembly. In other words, the limit below which we will not 
go, not under any kind of pressure, is the people's right to 
self-determination, its confirmation in a referendum, that is, 
which can even be organized by the international community. 
  [NIN] How do you explain the announcement that Croatia has 
received guarantees from the United States that it will manage 
to keep the Republic of Serbian Krajina within the borders of 
the former Socialist Republic of Croatia, and Charles Redman's 
statement that the United States would recognize Croatian in its 
AVNOJ [Antifascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia] 
borders? 
  [Martic] The recognition of Croatia by the United States -- 
of which you speak -- is nothing new. Almost all European 
states have recognized Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina with their 
AVNOJ borders. Nevertheless, the Republic of Serbian Krajina 
has been functioning as an entirely independent and sovereign 
state for over three years. Or, to be more precise, there will 
be no lasting solution to the Croat-Krajina conflict until both 
sides devise a way of sitting down at the negotiating table, 
and, starting with the actual situation, try to find some kind 
of compromise solution. As far as we are concerned, we have no 
special demands on Croatia, and we are ready to cooperate with 
it in all spheres that do not threaten the vital interests of 
our people. 
  [NIN] Do you believe that it is possible to solve the 
Krajina problem quickly and as part of the same package as 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Martic] At the moment, the most important thing is for the 
Croats to honor what they have signed in the Russian Embassy in 
Zagreb, and for peace to come to these areas. This will create 
conditions for negotiations of an economic and political nature. 
What the result of these negotiations will be does not depend 
only on us. 
  [NIN] Do you believe that the establishment of communication 
links between Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is 
possible before a lasting political solution on the status of 
the Republic of Serbian Krajina is achieved? 
  [Martic] I believe that the defined sequence of solving the 
Croat-Krajina conflict is conceptually wrong. The first phase 
must in any case be the end of the war and the establishment of 
lasting peace. Now that we have signed an agreement on the 
cessation of hostilities, and once we implement it, we need to 
immediately move on to solving the political relations between 
the Republic of Serbian Krajina and Croatia. Once this problem 
is solved, issues pertaining to economic cooperation and 
communications will not really present a problem. I have 
stressed on several occasions that there is no reason why the 
Republic of Serbian Krajina should not have cooperate well with 
all neighboring countries including Croatia, since this is in 
the interest of both sides. My only fear is that the sequence 
established now will result in new blockades and the creation of 
new crisis points. Experience has taught us that Croatia has so 
far always used forceful, unilateral solutions to undermine 
everything that has been accomplished regarding the solving of 
certain humanitarian problems. 
  [NIN] How do you see the further progress of talks between 
Knin and Zagreb, and which points are currently the most 
controversial? 
  [Martic] So far, we have no reason to be dissatisfied with 
the results. If the Croats comply with what was signed in the 
Russian Embassy in Zagreb, conditions will be created for 
lasting peace and the continuation of negotiations. We expect 
that the peace forces will soon take their positions on the 
demarcation line established by the maps and thus take over 
their real role. In the continuation of negotiations involving 
economic issues, we have our conditions that primarily concern 
the suspension of Security Council Resolution 820, which places 
the Krajina in total economic isolation. Because, you 
understand, there is no sense in negotiating about economic 
cooperation in conditions where we are not allowed to import or 
export, which, in turn, calls into question the state's economic 
survival. 
  [NIN] How would you assess the current political situation 
in the republic of Serbian Krajina in view of the fact that the 
parliamentary majority has not accepted your proposal that 
Borislav Mikelic be the future prime minister? 
  [Martic] I believe that we are in for a period of more 
stable internal relations. The temperature was quite high at 
the beginning of the work of the parliament, as a result of the 
accumulated political tensions from the time before the 
elections and during the first and second electoral rounds. The 
climate is gradually changing and as you have had the chance to 
hear, a compromise on the future composition of the government 
has already been reached. The coalition of the Serbian 
Democratic Party of Krajina and the Serbian Radical Party has 
already accepted the proposal that the prime minister designate 
should be Borislav Mikelic. He is currently conducting all the 
necessary consultations concerning the composition of the future 
government with representatives of all political parties, and I 
am convinced that it will all end in the best possible way. 
  [NIN] In Belgrade, your statements are interpreted as a hint 
that the parliament will be dissolved. Is that at all possible? 
  [Martic] My address to the public had only one goal -- to 
point out the possible consequences of a considerably 
destructive trend in the work of the parliament and to 
accentuate the necessity of accepting the concept of national 
unity. Because, after all, the republic of Serbian Krajina is 
at war, and we cannot duplicate on our political scene models 
that are valid in states that have had peace for a long time and 
where the parliamentary life is developed. My address to the 
people and the deputies did not have any other allusions. 
  [NIN] To what extent do internal disagreements weaken the 
position of the republic of Serbian Krajina? 
  [Martic] I have already said that these disagreements are of 
a temporary nature and therefore cannot significantly weaken the 
position of the republic of Serbian Krajina. There is complete 
political consensus on certain global issues that concern the 
future status of our state. This is evident in the good 
cooperation of the parliamentary committee for foreign affairs 
and the foreign ministry with the negotiating team that 
participated in the negotiations in Zagreb. 
  [NIN] Is there truth in the complaints that the important 
cadre positions have been taken by the supporters of members of 
the League of Communists -- Movement for Yugoslavia, which to a 
certain extent circumvents the electoral results? 
  [Martic] I do not know where such stories originate or whom 
they concretely concern. It is known that so far only the 
assembly has been constituted, and that everything was done in 
accordance with the wishes of the coalition. The government 
still has not been formed, and electoral results will most 
certainly be taken into account when choosing cabinet ministers. 
Therefore, it is clear that these are just rumors. 
  [NIN] Do you believe that it will be possible in due course 
to reintegrate Yugoslavia in the form of a confederacy, a union, 
or a third entity? 
  [Martic] I do not believe that it will be possible to create 
a new Yugoslavia that would be comprised of former republics, 
again linked through political links. It is to be expected that 
after the war is over, economic, communication, and even 
cultural links will be reestablished in the area of the former 
Yugoslavia. The strength of these links will depend on the 
international community's disposition toward solving political 
relations, that is, its readiness to apply the same standards to 
all the participants in the crisis in former Yugoslavia. I wish 
to stress once more that we ask for nothing more than what the 
same international community has granted the other peoples in 
former Yugoslavia, and that is to enable us -- in accordance 
with the strictest criteria -- to exercise our right to 
self-determination.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chairman of the Commission for Constitution, </F>
Standing Orders, and Legislature Tereza Ganza-Aras by Zdenko 
Duka; place and date not given: "This Is Indeed a Parliamentary 
Crisis"] 
  [Text] The attempt to replace Josip Manolic in the 
Chamber of Counties brought the Commission for Constitution, 
Standing Orders, and Legislature -- whose chairman is Tereza 
Ganza-Aras -- into focus. We therefore asked Tereza Ganza-Aras 
when she intended to convene the Commission. 
  [Ganza-Aras] I will convene the session as soon as I receive 
a request that will satisfy both the material and formal terms 
as foreseen by Article 50 of the Chamber of Counties Standing 
Orders. The request of a group of deputies, whose signatures 
were illegible, demanding that the session be convened urgently, 
should have specified why the request was made and exactly what 
they meant by "urgent," and it should have explained the reason 
for this urgency. 
  [Duka] No valid requests have been made recently? 
  [Ganza-Aras] No. The above-mentioned article of the 
Standing Orders that the group of deputies refers to, specifies 
that one must state the topic that is to be discussed at the 
session. I acted in accordance with the Standing Orders and 
thereby protected the dignity of the Commission and of the 
Chamber of Counties. The president of the HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Community] Club used expressions like "we demand," as 
if this was a party directive that I had to obey without 
objection. 
  [Duka] Is it difficult to figure out who is behind this 
request? 
  [Ganza-Aras] Yes. Names and surnames should have been typed 
next to signatures in order for it to be seen whether they are 
members of the Commission. When I find out exactly what problem 
is to be evaluated by the Commission, then I will use the 
possibility provided by the Standing Orders and consult experts. 
There are lawyers in the Commission, but it would not be 
harmful to hear the opinion of professors of law. If I had 
satisfied the "demand" of the president of the HDZ Club, it 
would have been pure voluntarism. 
<H5>  30-Day Deadline </H5>
  [Duka] You have mentioned a deadline of up to 30 days for 
convening the session. Is that according to the Standing Orders? 
  [Ganza-Aras] The Standing Orders say that the duty of the 
president of the Chamber of Counties is to submit agenda 
proposals within 30 days. The other rule says that presidents 
of working bodies have the rights and obligations toward their 
bodies that apply to the president of that chamber. Therefore, 
the longest deadline is 30 days. However, according to a 
Standing Orders article, there is a possibility of shortening 
deadlines, so, since this request is urgent, I will convene the 
Commission as soon as I get everything necessary for the regular 
course of the session. 
  However, the date for which I will convene the session will 
depend on when I get the material and when I get assessments. 
Notice of a session is sent to members eight days before the 
session takes place. 
  [Duka] Still, even without professional opinion, do you 
think different interpretations of the Standing Orders are 
possible? Was it legally possible to replace Manolic last 
Friday? 
  [Ganza-Aras] I think his interpretation was valid. All 
lawyers I met in those long recesses in the corridors of the 
parliament house share my opinion. There was a state of general 
consternation due to attempts to impose a party model on the 
work of the parliament. 
  [Duka] Professor Smiljko Sokol says this is not a 
parliamentary crisis. What is you opinion? 
  [Ganza-Aras] I think he is wrong. I do not know what else 
could be called a parliamentary crisis if not replacing the 
president of a chamber of the parliament?! Secondly, the 
Chamber of Representatives and the Chamber of Counties are 
obviously dependent on each other, and the Chamber of 
Representatives will not be able to begin a new session until 
this interrupted session of the Chamber of Counties is brought 
to a close. For a certain group of bills it is obligatory to 
first get the so-called previous opinion of the Chamber of 
Counties, and there are such bills at every session. 
  And in order to alleviate the crisis, I will try to convene 
my commission as soon as possible, but even that opinion is not 
reliable. Again, the Chamber of Counties will alone decide 
whether it will accept that opinion or not. 

<H5>    What Kind of Ballot? </H5>
  [Duka] At the session of the Commission, there will probably 
be outvoting. What is the party structure of deputies? 
  [Ganza-Aras] All commissions are composed so that HDZ 
members have an absolute majority. Commissions have 17 members 
each, four of which are liberals, one member of the Social 
Democratic Party, one member of the Istrian Democratic Congress 
-- Sosic is formally a member of the Croatian Party, but he is a 
member of the HDZ Club -- and one member of the Croatian 
Peasants Party. There are eight HDZ members -- nine with Sosic. 
I suppose they will all come to the Commission session so that 
there will be outvoting, as usual. 
  [Duka] If Manolic is replaced, they will vote for a new 
president. In case there are several candidates, there will be 
a secret ballot. 
  [Ganza-Aras] Yes, but only as a rule. For, if seven 
deputies demand an open ballot, then an open ballot will decide 
whether there will be an open or a secret ballot. The Standing 
Orders are composed so as to disable the opposition as much as 
possible. The president of the Chamber has absolute power and, 
now, in the case of Manolic, it recoils on the HDZ. People say 
that a stick has two ends. Therefore, it is best not to have it. 
  [Duka] In early Fall, one began working on new standing 
orders for both chambers. This work was particularly aided by 
Mesic and Manolic. However, in the end, it was all stopped. 
  [Ganza-Aras] We completed the Standing Orders in November 
last year. During a year and a half of work of the Chamber of 
Representatives and a year of work of the Chamber of Counties, 
many Standing Orders solutions appeared vague, so new Standing 
Orders regulated many matters more precisely. However, when 
they were already copied and ready to be sent to deputies for 
approval, everything was stopped. 
<H5>  Who Stopped Standing Orders? </H5>
  [Duka] Who stopped them and why? 
  [Ganza-Aras] I can only guess. Prominent HDZ spokespersons 
raised the issue. Among other things, the secret ballot was 
emphasized as a problem. Those standing orders explicitly 
demanded a secret ballot when making decisions about people. 
They tried to introduce more order in deadlines for composing 
the agenda. However, it seems that the ruling party wants to 
have incomplete standing orders so as it can interpret them as 
it likes. 
  [Duka] Now we see that Professor Sokol is not satisfied with 
these standing orders. Therefore, he too might be replaced 
after this case. 
  [Ganza-Aras] Yes, he is not only dissatisfied with the 
Standing Orders but also with the constitutional definition of 
the Chamber of Counties, and we know that he and Mr. Seks were 
those who wrote this Constitution. 
  Sokol, for instance, says that the president of the 
parliamentary chamber must enjoy the trust of most deputies in 
the chamber or must step down. No one disputes that. But, the 
session of the Chamber of Counties began on Wednesday, continued 
on Thursday, and there were demands for Manolic's replacement on 
Friday, and in two days of the session, the president of the 
chamber [Manolic] did not come into conflict with any deputy. 
It seems that 36 deputies remembered overnight, after full two 
days of session, that they no longer trust their chamber 
president. 
  The opposition wanted to continue and conclude this session. 
HDZ deputies finally suggested interrupting the session. The 
demand for replacement could have been put on the agenda of the 
next session of the chamber. Furthermore, Sokol concluded that 
the constitutional position of the Chamber of Counties must be 
changed. All parliamentary opposition parties think that the 
Constitution must be amended exactly with regard to the position 
of the parliament.

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Jakov Gelo, director of the </F>
State Bureau for Statistics; place and date not given: "I Am 
Afraid of Emigration of the Croats"] 
  [Text] [DANAS] What are the possible demographic 
consequences of the Croatian-Muslim federation and confederation? 
  [Gelo] I consider the internal arrangement of federal Bosnia 
and Herzegovina very important in this regard. Unless the 
boundaries between the two nationalities are relatively 
well-drawn, that is, unless the space belonging to the 
respective nationality is set off so that the Croats have their 
sovereignty in a specified part, we can expect emigration of 
Croats from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The central government in 
Sarajevo need not be supreme to cause that: economic reasons 
will be paramount in motivating Croats to leave Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, as they have up to now. Unless Croatia is able to 
conduct a differentiated economic and demographic policy toward 
the part of Bosnia and Herzegovina where the Croats live, that 
is, unless there are special economic relations between the 
Croatian cantons and the Croatian state, over the next 10 years, 
while a true market is coming to life, we could lose all the 
Croats in Bosnia. That is why as a demographer and statistician 
I consider it very important to have precise territorial and 
political definition of the area and rights of the Croats in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina where as a sovereign nation they will 
decide the essential matters concerning their future. 
  [DANAS] How do you make the case for that fear? 
  [Gelo] The area where the Muslims live is the most heavily 
populated, but not the most highly developed. Two-thirds of the 
population of Bosnia and Herzegovina live in that area. 
Demographic trends show that the Muslims will continue to 
increase numerically. Unless there are precisely defined 
limitations on moving from one place to another, the Muslims 
will spread not only to the territory of the federation, but 
even to the territory of the confederation, that is, Croatia. 
They will have a hard time integrating with the Croats, because 
in religion, customs, and culture they belong to a different 
cultural context. Experiences in the past show that with respect 
to those criteria the Croats and Serbs are closer than the 
Croats and the Muslims. And when it comes to moving from one 
place to another, certain restrictions have to be set up between 
the cantons in the federation, not only concerning the Muslims, 
but this should also be done concerning the Croats from Bosnia 
and Herzegovina. They are the smallest nationality in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, they live in the least developed area, they have a 
less promising demographic trend than the Muslims, and they 
naturally tend to move to the parent state. That is why from the 
economic standpoint Croatia must fight for its right to bypass 
the central Bosnian government in its relations with the 
particular cantons. Unless it succeeds in doing that, this 
federal-confederal framework will result in disappearance of the 
Croats from Bosnia and Herzegovina and a threat to the present 
composition of the population in Croatia. 
  [DANAS] What would be the ethnic composition of that 
confederation? 
  [Gelo] The confederation would have a population of 7.5 
million: 4.5 million Croats, 1.9 million Muslims, 500,000 Serbs, 
and the remainder are other nationalities (see the table [not 
translated]). So, the Croats would represent about 60 percent in 
that community of states. Demographic developments, which cannot 
change in a few years, but only over decades, indicate that the 
non-Croats will have a stronger population growth, which in time 
could have the result that there are more non-Croats than 
Croats, which means a threat to the stability and survival of 
the Croatian state. Regardless of the war, Croatia has a decline 
in population, for two years now there have been more deaths 
than births. And the demographic process, as I said, cannot be 
changed that fast. 
  [DANAS] But what if the Bosnian Serbs join the federation 
and 
then the confederation? 
  [Gelo] Add to that number of 7.5 million the 1.3 million 
Bosnian Serbs, and if we take into account demographic processes 
which are unfavorable for the Croats, the Croats would very soon 
be a minority in that structure. 
  [DANAS] What needs to be done to change the process? 
  [Gelo] A population policy, which has been lacking up to 
now, 
has to be established in order to correct those negative 
demographic trends. And then a migration policy to distribute 
the population on economic and strategic grounds. The Adriatic 
islands, parts of Slavonia, and the Lika Plateau have a trend of 
population loss. We also need to include the return of Croats, 
for example, from Kosovo, from Vojvodina, Kotor Bay, Romania, 
Hungary.... 
  [DANAS] How do you evaluate the Washington agreement as a 
whole? 
  [Gelo] If it is implemented and if the sovereign Croatian 
cantons in Bosnia and Herzegovina are not delineated, and if the 
right of the Muslims to move into those cantons or to Croatia is 
not limited, and then if Croats are not prevented from moving 
out of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Washington agreement is a bad 
decision from the demographic standpoint. It most likely will 
cause a new wave of emigration of Croats not only Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, but also from Croatia, because renewal not only of 
its country, but also of the much more devastated Bosnia, will 
be placed on Croatia's shoulders. Unfortunately, those are the 
indications of the science of demography.
