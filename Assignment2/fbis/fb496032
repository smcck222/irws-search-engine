<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Magda </F>
Pospisilova; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Pospisilova] In the last few days, the 
government has been working mainly on the summarization of its 
policy statement. It is not quite clear from the policy 
statement proposal so far to what concept of transformation the 
government is going to adhere. Is it going to be a shock 
method, or are you going to continue with what some people 
consider to be a more acceptable method for Slovakia? 
  [Moravcik] We tried to solve this matter unequivocally and 
express it in the programmatic statement of the government. We 
are concerned with a speedy transformation, with maintaining the 
budgetary deficit at a certain level, and we are also concerned 
for this transformation to be socially viable. These are the 
basic economic principles of the policy statement. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Pospisilova] Are the elections going to take place at the 
end of September and the beginning of October, as was agreed? 
  [Moravcik] We have no intention of lengthening this period. 
We consider the elections at the end of September and the 
beginning of October to be very necessary. 
  [Pospisilova] Negotiations with the IMF and World Bank 
representatives that have taken place here seem to point to a 
tangible change in their attitude toward Slovakia after the 
change of government. Suddenly, it seems to be possible to 
reach the set economic aims, not only by increasing taxes and by 
reducing social allowances, subsidies, and similar items, but 
also by a complex of interconnected active measures that are not 
limited by the six months' period. Should the credit for this 
go to the first woman deputy prime minister? 
  [Moravcik] Yes, she should also be credited for it. We have 
to add that Mrs. Snegnerova represents a certain type of 
economic and political view that is identical or very similar to 
the one represented by other economy ministers. [passage omitted] 
  We were very pleased when this economic program found 
response in the attitude of IMF representatives. It means that 
our political and economic considerations are gaining an 
international dimension, which is very important. It means that 
we have come closer to the global way of thinking. 
  [Pospisilova] Representatives of the Hungarian Christian 
Democratic Movement [MKDH] and others expressed dissatisfaction 
over your government's tardiness in clarifying illegal 
procedures of the so-called wild privatization of the former 
government of Vladimir Meciar. Vojtech Bugar [MKDH chairman] 
openly forecasts that, if you fail to clarify this matter by the 
fall elections, you would lose completely. Simultaneously, he 
asks what was then the point of voting the former government out 
of office. 
  [Moravcik] Deputies did not vote the government out of 
office 
to confront it now with its mistakes. We took this step in 
order to present a different policy, to introduce a different 
political style. Naturally, it is important to point out 
mistakes that were made. It must be said that, in the case of 
privatization, it is not such a simple matter because illegal 
steps were executed very cunningly. However, in the course of 
time, we will be able to show the public the real face of those 
who were privatizing in the previous government. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Pospisilova] This week's visit of your Czech counterpart, 
Vaclav Klaus, to Moscow drew attention not only because he 
answered in fluent Russian the questions put to him by the 
Russian editor during a live television broadcast, but also 
because of the interesting agreements he concluded at the talks 
with the Russian prime minister--in particular, the agreement on 
settling the Russian debt to the Czech Republic. Slovak Deputy 
Prime Minister Brigita Snegnerova already observed that you did 
not want to continue in the direction taken by the former 
government--namely, that the Russian debt to us would be paid, 
for example, only by increasing import of military technology. 
When then are you going to visit Moscow? 
  [Moravcik] We think that Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin will shortly come for a visit to Slovakia, as was 
agreed. 
  [Pospisilova] Jozef Prokes, honorary chairman of the Slovak 
National Party, said that your government was a traveling one 
because you agreed on so many foreign trips right at the 
beginning of your term, that they equal all the trips of 
Vladimir Meciar's Cabinet undertaken in the space of more than a 
year. If you are not going to Moscow, where are you going to go 
within these six months? 
  [Moravcik] My program is not yet clarified. It is being 
prepared. Concerning the reproach implied in your question, 
quoting Prokes, it is totally unjustified and, in principle, 
absurd because Slovakia is very dependent on foreign relations. 
To move developments in all areas here in Slovakia is not 
possible without very intensive foreign cooperation. It is the 
government's duty to develop these contacts and to align 
Slovakia into international relations. 
  [Pospisilova] Tomorrow's [9 April] Cabinet session will also 
discuss the final report on the application of law passed by the 
former federal parliament that deals with the return of the 
Communist Party assets to the people of the federal republic. 
This matter has been dragging on for three years, and rumors 
have started to circulate about how interesting it is that, 
after three years of quarrels, suddenly there is a chance to put 
a stop to it--and this only one month after the present 
government came to power, sharing it with seven ministers from 
the Party of the Democratic Left. 
  [Moravcik] This point will be discussed on Tuesday's [12 
April] Cabinet meeting. A full stop must be put to all 
problems. We have to concentrate on business. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Prime Minister Josef Moravcik by </F>
Andrzej Niewiadowski on 31 March; place not given: "We Must 
Depart From Confrontation"] 
  [Text] [Niewiadowski] Mr. Prime Minister, you are head of 
the new coalition government in the Slovak Republic; this 
government has "replaced" the much-criticized cabinet of 
Vladimir Meciar. How would you characterize the program of the 
governing coalition, and what guarantees can you see that this 
government will be more democratic? 
  [Moravcik] We have only six months at our disposal. We will 
have new elections in October, which is earlier than originally 
scheduled. Until that time, we want to change the style of 
governing. We must depart from the policy of confrontation that 
was pursued by Mr. Meciar. We want to establish conditions for 
cooperation among all interested political entities, and we are 
declaring this desire in our international relations as well. 
  [Niewiadowski] However, is it possible to reach a political 
consensus despite all of the programmatic differences in the new 
coalition, which is made up of both the Christian-Democratic 
Party, led by Jan Czarnogurski, the "center orientation," which 
is represented by yourself, and, finally, by the Democratic Left 
Party [SDL], chaired by Peter Weiss? 
  [Moravcik] We want to underscore whatever links the new 
coalition, not the differences. I do not agree with the opinion 
that the main reason for recalling the previous government was 
so- called anti-Meciarism. We simply had a different concept of 
governing. 
  [Niewiadowski] What exactly was this concept? 
  [Moravcik] The Meciar government was a government of 
improvisation, which we will try to avoid. In parliament on 12 
April, I will submit a long-term program for overcoming the 
crisis in the country. 
  [Niewiadowski] Could you reveal the most basic points of 
this program? 
  [Moravcik] The most important thing will be the 
transformation of the Slovak economy. We must fairly rigorously 
adhere to the schedule in our contacts with international 
establishments. The point is to attract foreign capital. We 
must establish a system of guarantees that would make investment 
in Slovakia profitable; on the other hand, we must liberate the 
initiative of our own citizens. 
  [Niewiadowski] Are you also thinking about the privatization 
of the national wealth? 
  [Moravcik] Yes, we are. We want to return to the old 
federative concept of coupon privatization implemented, with 
small technical changes, in the Czech Republic. We want our 
citizens to have as much of the national wealth as possible. 
  [Niewiadowski] In the daily commentaries of the pro-Meciar 
daily RESPUBLIKA, the opposition accuses you of acting against 
the legislature because you have annulled the privatization 
contracts that have been signed so far. Can the law be 
retroactive? What is your response to this allegation? 
  [Moravcik] I cannot agree with it. We reviewed the 
privatization contracts that have recently been forced by the 
Meciar cabinet. We did this because we received information 
that, during the privatization process, party interests took 
precedence over the interests of the state. The people who were 
privatizing the national wealth were selected in line with the 
priorities of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. 
Whenever we came across a contract that--I want to stress 
this--was not in conformity with the binding legal norms, we had 
to annul it. Incidentally, it was not very difficult to find 
such contracts. The government of Mr. Meciar was in an awful 
hurry in its last days and committed legislative errors. 
  [Niewiadowski] Will the new Cabinet avoid such errors? 
  [Moravcik] The process of privatization will be accompanied 
by permanent control; the coupon privatization will make it 
possible for citizens to control the national wealth. 
  [Niewiadowski] Still, you are being severely criticized by 
Meciar, who has even formed a "shadow cabinet" made up of former 
ministers of his government. Do you not fear that the 
preelection campaign may reach the streets and that Meciar, as 
we already witnessed during a demonstration in front of 
parliament, will accuse you of destroying the state and will 
bring about a wave of nationalistic demonstrations? 
  [Moravcik] I would not overestimate the strength of Mr. 
Meciar. When Meciar was recalled for the first time in 1991, 
before the government of Jan Carnogursky was formed, tens of 
thousands of people gathered in the Slovak National Uprising 
square. There were far fewer this time. They were mostly 
fanatic supporters of Mr. Meciar. One cannot feel the need for 
confrontation in Slovakia. What seems to be wanted is the 
creation of the atmosphere of peace and awaiting the moves of 
the new government. 
  [Niewiadowski] These moves will also be of an international 
nature. What do you consider to be the priority in the 
relations with your closest neighbors? Let us start with the 
Czech Republic. 
  [Moravcik] We must resolve the open questions of the 
division of the federative national wealth and the issue of 
frontier rigor. We are interested in maintaining the customs 
union. These are the issues of paramount importance. 
  [Niewiadowski] What about your relations with Hungary? 
  [Moravcik] We must intensively seek a platform of agreement 
so as not to allow nationalistic trends to increase. From this 
point of view, cooperation with representatives of the Hungarian 
national minority, which is represented in the Slovak parliament 
by "Egyuttels" and the Hungarian Christian-Democratic Party, 
will be very important. 
  [Niewiadowski] What stand is Slovakia going to take on the 
increasingly more active foreign policy of Russia? Will it be 
similar in any way to Polish foreign policy? 
  [Moravcik] I believe that the basic directions of the 
foreign policies of both states are the same. Just like Poland, 
Slovakia would like the political situation in Russian to 
develop in the direction of democratic transformations. We can 
say the same about Ukraine. 
  We need a stable Ukraine very much because it is our 
neighbor, so it is our desire that the political and economic 
situation in this country be based on solid foundations. The 
maintenance of democracy in Russia and Ukraine is the best 
guarantee of our security. 
  [Niewiadowski] Is the orientation of Slovak foreign policy 
defined clearly and unequivocally? 
  [Moravcik] The new government will support the idea of 
Slovakia's integration into the structures of Western Europe as 
soon as possible. This is our principal strategic goal. What 
we want is to join both the Western European Union and NATO. I 
believe that the fundamental directions of the political 
strategy of Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland 
are very similar in this area. Thus, we can cooperate quite well 
within the Visegrad Group, because it would be a pity not to 
take advantage of the idea of this agreement. It is too bad 
that the concept of establishing a joint security system within 
this group has been put aside. 
  [Niewiadowski] Are you also for the institutionalization of 
the structures of this agreement? 
  [Moravcik] No, I do not think this is necessary. I believe 
that a system of regular consultations on the ministerial level 
would be sufficient. 
  [Niewiadowski] A lot has recently been said about economic 
cooperation between our states. On both sides of the border, 
considerable pressure can be felt to establish the "Tatra 
Region." Do you envision any concrete decisions on this issue 
within the next six months? 
  [Moravcik] I believe that there are no serious reasons that 
the "Tatra Region" should not be established and that it should 
not function properly. The government will discuss the 
materials left over by the cabinet of Mr. Meciar, and, with 
certain amendments, the entire project may be accepted by the 
Slovak party. 
  [Niewiadowski] What about over a dozen interministerial 
agreements that were supposed to be signed this year? 
  [Moravcik] We are ready to make a considerable step in this 
area to pass from purely verbal declarations to specifics. So 
far, a lot has been said about cooperation; in practice, 
however, it has looked different. 
  [Niewiadowski] After the 1993 elections, a leftist cabinet 
was formed in Poland. Do you think the left may win the Slovak 
elections as well? 
  [Moravcik] Most probably the left will not obtain such a 
number of votes as to be able to form a government that would 
have the support of a majority of parliament. The optimum 
solution for Slovakia would be to maintain the agreement of the 
present coalition, which has the character of a social consensus. 
  [Niewiadowski] Do you think Peter Weiss's SDL may run in the 
elections along with Vladimir Meciar's HZDS? 
  [Moravcik] This would be a tremendous failure for me. I 
believe that the SDL will be strong enough to transform itself 
into a modern party of a social democratic character. 
  [Niewiadowski] You are the representative of the "center 
orientation" and support the program of "democratic liberalism." 
However, the "center orientation" includes other parties as 
well: Milan Kniazko's "Association of Democrats" and Ludovit 
Cernak's National-Democratic Party, which considers itself to be 
the only heir to the Slovak national traditions and which is not 
concealing its conservative ambitions. Do you think it is 
possible for the entire "center orientation" to unite? Now, if 
the center is divided, Meciar will certainly gain more undecided 
voters.... 
  [Moravcik] There exists such a danger. However, we must not 
forget the political reality. It is quite possible to unite the 
center partially--that is, agreement may be reached by the 
"Alternative of the Political Realism" and the "Association of 
Democrats." Both groupings will soon form the "Democratic Union 
of Slovakia." Yesterday (that is, on 30 March--editor's note) 
we decided to establish it. The "Union" will have a 
"liberal-democratic" character. The supporters of Cernak are 
further "to the right." All of the other "center" parties, 
however, will form a joint preelection front; there is already 
an agreement on that. 
  [Niewiadowski] If the coalition won the elections and you 
were once again asked to form a new government, would you accept 
such an offer? 
  [Moravcik] I have already said twice that I would not accept 
the post offered to me--first in March of last year, when I 
became foreign affairs minister in the Meciar government, and 
second, in March of this year, when President Michal Kovac said 
I should head this Cabinet. Well, if I were forced to change my 
opinion once again...

    [Editorial Report] After assuming office on 16 March, the 
new Slovak Government, led by Jozef Moravcik, found itself 
confronted with the results of what it believes to be 
last-minute petty acts of pilferage on the part of the outgoing 
government of Vladimir Meciar, as well as evidence of 
questionable financial dealings by officials of the Meciar 
regime. These charges are contained in a 21 March ZEMEDELSKE 
NOVINY article by Ivan Rajecky, who writes that the new deputy 
prime minister, Ivan Simko, found his offices stripped of 
movable property, including even such insignificant items as 
coffee cups and water glasses. Labor Minister Julius Brocka was 
confronted with a work stoppage by ministry officials, who 
refused to serve under him because they "do not officially 
recognize" the Moravcik government. According to Rajecky, 
Brocka did not manage to get even a cup of coffee on his first 
day in office. 
  As had been "predicted" by his predecessor, Roman Hofbauer, 
Transportation Minister Mikulas Dzurinda did not find even paper 
or pencils in his new office. What Dzurinda did find in his 
ministry, however, was former Minister Hofbauer ensconced in the 
civil-service position of deputy minister, having "mysteriously" 
been appointed by a state secretary who was at the time on an 
official visit to Greece. Rajecky also reported that, on taking 
office, many new ministers found gaps in official files and 
records. 
  According to Rajecky, the new government has discovered 
evidence that significant expenditures were made without proper 
parliamentary authorization, including a supplementary budget of 
1.2 million korunas [Sk] obtained by former Prime Minister 
Meciar's secretariat director, Anna Nagy, and Sk1.3 million in 
unauthorized severance payments to government employees who had 
been fired by Meciar because they "did not share his views." 
Rajecky also alleged that the chairman of the Supreme 
Inspection Office, Marian Vanko, was found to have purchased 14 
Audi automobiles off budget, two of which had apparently been 
loaned to the secretariat of Meciar's party, the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). Rajecky reported that parliamentary 
investigations of these matters are planned. 
  According to an article in the 21 March ROLNICKE NOVINY, 
Privatization Minister Milan Janicin allegedly has evidence of 
at least 13 instances of illegal actions in privatization 
projects approved by the Meciar government in its last month in 
office. The Bratislava daily reports that Janicin has requested 
that the Finance Ministry freeze the National Property Fund's 
accounts and halt further property transfers until the issue is 
resolved.

  [Excerpt] [Announcer] Slovak Economy Minister Peter Magvasi 
returned from Moscow last night. He signed a protocol there on 
trade and economic relations for 1994. Today, in Bratislava, he 
talked to journalists in greater detail about his negotiations 
in the Russian Federation, about whose markets a view prevails 
here that they are insolvent. Economy Minister Peter Magvasi 
was interviewed by our editor Ivan Bielko. 
  [Begin recording] [Bielko] Our trade balance with Russia has 
been negative in the past few years. Is it going to improve 
after your negotiations in Moscow? 
  [Magvasi] The protocol that I signed with Oleg Davydov, the 
Russian foreign economic relations minister, will open up some 
new opportunities for our enterprises to penetrate Russian 
markets. 
  [Bielko] For example? 
  [Magvasi] Above all, there is a chance for enterprises to 
open their own accounts in selected banks of the Russian 
Federation and in the Slovak Republic. 
  [Bielko] A view prevails here that the Russian market is 
insolvent. What about it? 
  [Magvasi] I think this is an opinion that prevailed from 
1990-91, when it was true that the disintegration of the whole 
system in Russia did lead to the insolvency of some partners. 
On the other hand, today the position is clear. There are 
partners in Russia who are highly solvent. In view of the fact 
that the ruble is convertible and there is an opportunity for 
our Slovak businessmen to open their own accounts, there is far 
better payment security in trade with Russia than there is today 
within Slovakia--with insolvency there--and in trade with the 
Czech Republic. I consider this to be a decisive window of 
opportunity that our businessmen should exploit very intensively 
and immediately. 
  [Bielko] You held talks at the Russian Ministry of Atomic 
Energy relating to supplies of nuclear fuel and to Russian 
participation in the reconstruction of Jaslovske Bohunice 
[nuclear energy plant in central Slovakia], as well as to some 
other issues. 
  [Magvasi] The Russian Federation confirmed its continuing 
interest in supplying nuclear fuel. Second, we reassessed the 
state of readiness of the intergovernmental agreement on nuclear 
energy that should be ready to be signed by the end of April or 
the beginning of May. Third, I think it is very important that 
the Russian Federation is eminently interested in participating 
in the construction at Mochovce [nuclear plant in southern 
Slovakia]. [end recording] [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Bratislava SME in Slovak on 6 April on 
pages 1 and 2, under the headline "The Appointment of 
Commissioners Had No Backing in Law," carries an 800-word 
interview with Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner by Boris 
Koren. In the interview, the place and date of which are not 
given, Pittner justifies the government's decision to recall 
"eight government commissioners" appointed by the former 
government of Vladimir Meciar, whose task was to "prepare" 
Slovakia's new territorial and administrative arrangement. 
Pittner explains the decision by the agreement reached by the 
present coalition that "territorial and administrative division, 
horizontal integration, and transfer of powers from the state 
administration to self-administrative bodies are problems of 
such importance that they should be tackled only by the 
government that will emerge from the early elections." He also 
argues that the appointment of the eight commissioners "had no 
backing in law" and that it "anticipated a certain form of 
administrative arrangement and administrative and territorial 
division." As he notes, the appointment of eight such 
commissioners "came suspiciously close to one of the government 
proposals," under which Slovakia was to be subdivided into seven 
or eight territorial and administrative units.

  [Text] Warsaw, 11 Apr (PAP)--A period of confrontation in 
Europe has not been followed by major changes. There is a 
chance for a peaceful solution of problems, but swift actions 
and brave decisions are needed. The United States has the 
greatest responsibility for the future, President Lech Walesa 
said today, when greeting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe 
Talbott at the Belweder Palace. 
  According to the president, a chance exists for building 
unity in Europe, and, "acting together with the United States, 
we might achieve splendid victories." "It is the United States 
that is the most important in the battleground at present," Lech 
Walesa said. Poland is concerned with the remnants of communism 
and the Warsaw Pact, although, according to the president, there 
are no major threats. 
  Lech Walesa underscored that West Europe maintains its 
position and NATO is not expanding. "We have been struggling 
for 50 years with millions of victims and great financial 
costs," he said. Poland has devoted the past four years to the 
search. No great structural changes have been made, and life 
cannot stand a vacuum, Lech Walesa argued.

  [Text] Belgrade, 11 April (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav Army's 
General Staff today stated that the bombardment of civilian and 
military targets in the Srpska republic carried out by the NATO 
air force last night was an act that might bring about 
unforeseeable military consequences. 
  The Yugoslav Army is following the developments caused by 
this aggressive act. Bearing in mind the latest circumstances, 
all necessary measures have been taken to protect the 
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the 
Yugoslav Army's General Staff says in its statement.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 9 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces, 
pressing a 10-day offensive, have seized a strategic height 
overlooking the Moslem enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia, a 
UN spokesman said here Saturday. 
  But Major Rob Annink of the UN Protection Force in former 
Yugoslavia told reporters that "we don't think that Gorazde is 
under imminent threat of being taken by the Bosnian Serb army" 
following Friday's seizure of the highest flank of Mount Gradina. 
  He said he based his conviction on the fact that "the 
(mainly 
Moslem) Bosnian army is still strong and that the Serb army does 
not want to take the town." [passage omitted] 
  Despite the breaking of a 24-hour truce declared on Thursday 
[7 April], UNPROFOR spokesman Annink said General Rose was 
"quite optimistic" he could obtain a ceasefire between the 
warring sides on Saturday. [passage omitted] 
  Annink pointed out here that the Serbs could have bombarded 
the city from the positions they had captured in recent days but 
had chosen not to do so. 
  After taking Mount Gradina, the Serbs now hold 7.5 percent 
of 
the original Moslem pocket. This includes most of the right 
bank of the river Drina which the Serbs want to control along 
all its course and which follows the route between 
Zvornik-Gorazde-Gacko-Trebinje in southeastern Bosnia. 
  UNPROFOR believes the Serbs are also trying to force the 
Bosnian government to sign a ceasefire just as it is notching up 
important military successes against Serb forces in northern 
Bosnia. 
  Bosnian government troops have widened the Maglaj enclave it 
controls and threaten the Serb-held town of Doboj. Further 
north they are exerting pressure the corridor that links 
Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Croatia with Serbia proper. 
  In the northwestern Bosnian town of Prijedor, the Bosnian 
Serbs said on Saturday they had arrested several people 
suspected of murdering some 20 Moslems at the end of March. 
  Drago Vukovic, interior ministry spokesman for the 
self-proclaimed Serb Republic of Bosnia told AFP that those 
thought responsible for the killings were behind bars and that 
their names would be published soon. 
  The killings spread terror among the 6,000 Moslems living in 
the region and forced the United Nations into negotiating their 
evacuation.

  [Text] Geneva, April 9 (AFP) -- UN chief Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali Saturday ordered UN forces in Bosnia to use "all 
available means" to obtain the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb troops 
threatening the Moslem enclave of Gorazde. 
  Butrus-Ghali said in a statement released by his spokeswoman 
Therese Gastaut that the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in 
former Yugoslavia must "use all available means as authorized by 
the relevant Security Council resolutions to attain this 
objective." 
  Gastaut said the resolutions included the possible recourse 
to NATO air strikes because Gorazde was a protected UN "safe 
haven". 
  The statement was issued as the Bosnian Serbs seized 
strategic high ground overlooking Gorazde as part of a 10-day 
offensive on the Moslem pocket in eastern Bosnia. 
  In his statement, Butrus-Ghali welcomed ``the positive 
momentum and progress towards peace and stability in the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  ``With regard to the safe area of Gorazde, the 
Secretary-General has taken note of the improvement in the 
situation there which was reported to him this (Saturday) 
morning. 
  "At the same time, he calls for a return by the parties, 
especially the Bosnian Serbs, to the positions they held before 
the outbreak of the recent fighting." 
  The statement was issued after the UN chief held meetings in 
Geneva earlier on Saturday with his special representative to 
former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, as well as UN mediator 
Thorvald Stoltenberg, Sarajevo special coordinator William 
Eagleton and UNPROFOR chief General Bertrand de Sauville de 
Lapresle.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 9 (AFP) -- Ceasefire talks 
between Bosnian and Bosnian Serb military leaders at Sarajevo 
airport broke down Saturday afternoon minutes after getting 
under way, the UN said. 
  Bosnian general Rasim Delic and Bosnian Serb general Ratko 
Mladic will now have a 48-hour cooling off period during which 
they will both hold consultations with political authorities, 
said United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) commander in 
Bosnia, General Michael Rose. 
  The meeting was called to reach an agreement on a ceasefire 
for the eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde, where the 
Serbs launched a major offensive two weeks ago, and on ways of 
securing a global solution to the Bosnia crisis. 
  But Delic insisted on a "short-term arrangement" for Gorazde 
while the Bosnian Serbs were seeking an overall ceasefire, 
UNPROFOR spokesman Captain Eric Chaperon said. [passage omitted] 
  Despite the breakdown, the UNPROFOR spokesman said Rose 
remained confident an agreement would eventually be signed.

  [Text] The Czech Foreign Ministry reacted to Sunday's [10 
April] NATO air strike on Serbian positions near the eastern 
Bosnian town of Gorazde. Czech Radio received the ministry's 
statement from ministry's press spokesman Vit Kurfuerst. 
  The Czech Foreign ministry supports yesterday's decision by 
the UN and NATO on the air strike in the vicinity of Gorazde, 
which was done in full accordance with the relevant resolutions 
of the UN Security Council. The Foreign Ministry is concerned 
about the continuing escalation of fighting in the eastern 
Bosnian enclave of Gorazde, which has been declared a security 
zone by Security Council Resolution 824. Of special concern are 
the intensifying artillery attacks against Gorazde, which lead 
not only to civilian suffering but also to the immediate threat 
on the UN military observers. 
  The Foreign Ministry considers the NATO air strike 
coordinated by the United Nations as another warning signal to 
the initiators of this conflict and appeals to Bosnian Serb 
leaders not to reject a return to the negotiating table. The 
Foreign Ministry considers yesterday's action as further 
confirmation of the credibility of UN attempts to settle the 
situation in former Yugoslavia peacefully. Further extension of 
war acts could thwart the results of international attempts for 
the peaceful settlement achieved so far and bring the situation 
in the whole crisis area to a head.

  [Text] Our Skopje correspondent Takis Dhiamandis has 
reported that the Defense Ministry of Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] has denied reports about 
an alleged concentration of Greek armed forces along its 
northwest borders. These reports have been circulating for the 
past few days. Moreover, it was one of the issues Skopjean 
President Kiro Gligorov raised in his interview with the French 
newspaper LE MONDE. 
  Tension was noticed in Skopje last night after reports began 
coming from Gevgelija, which is near the border, about the 
movement of a Greek tank column. The Defense Ministry of Skopje 
issued a statement late last night that stressed that these 
reports are not consonant with the facts.

  [Text] According to a statement by the Croatian Foreign 
Ministry, the Croatian Government welcomed the resolute NATO 
action against the military positions of the Bosnian Serbs 
around the besieged Muslim enclave, that is, the protected area 
of Gorazde. 
  The Croatian Government believes that the air strikes 
against 
the Serb military positions around Gorazde are a legitimate and 
justified action in support of the implementation of UNPROFOR's 
[UN Protection Force] mandate in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
statement stresses the fact that the action followed a blatant 
violation by Serbs of all UN Security Council resolutions and 
statements on the protection of Gorazde, and was in keeping with 
a plan of action jointly elaborated by the United Nations and 
NATO. 
  Besides the immediate effect of stopping Serb advances on 
central Gorazde, and averting danger to the town and tens of 
thousands of civilians and refugees, the NATO action undoubtedly 
has a symbolic significance. The NATO air strikes carried out 
by U.S. fighter-jets shows that, despite the complexity of 
international coordination mechanisms, it is possible to reach 
an effective consent at short notice, and that the international 
community has enough legitimately adopted documents, measures 
and responses to counter violators of international norms. 
  The Croatian Government therefore considers the Gorazde 
action to be the last warning of the international community and 
a call to certain forces among the Serbian people to stop 
military activities, blatant violations of international norms 
and agreements, and to join serious negotiations, in order to 
find a solution acceptable to all sides and to restore peace, 
stability, and security in this part of Europe.

<F P=106> [Report on a statement by Milan Martic, president of the </F>
republic of Serb Krajina, on the NATO air strike on Serbian 
positions near Gorazde, from Knin; date not given; monitored in 
progress] 
  [Text] ...the leadership of the republic of Serbian 
Krajina [RSK] is deeply embittered by the unparalleled precedent 
created by NATO forces under the auspices of the United Nations 
by bombing Serbian positions in the Srpska republic without any 
announcement or valid reason. 
  We protest resolutely against such an impertinent action 
that 
undermines the root of all efforts to resolve the crisis on the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia in a peaceful way, the 
statement emphasizes and then stresses: 
  The attack of NATO forces against the republic of Serbian 
Krajina [as heard] further diminished the trust of the Serbian 
people in the international community, which has been minimal 
even so far due to its partisan and biased attitude in the past. 
With such an act of aggression, the international community has 
declared war on the Serbian people, and is, with the threat of 
the NATO war machinery, trying to force it, in this way, to 
embrace immediately the solutions that are in the interest of 
the other two warring sides and to its detriment. 
  At the end of the statement issued in light of the NATO 
attack on Serbian positions in the vicinity of Gorazde, RSK 
President Milan Martic points out: 
  The people and the RSK leadership once again give their 
unreserved support to our brothers in the Srpska republic in 
their efforts to defend their country and their freedom, won 
with blood. The responsibility for all possible consequences 
that can, due to the bombing of the Srpska republic, further 
(?undermine) the course of the peace process on the territories 
of the former Yugoslavia will be borne by the perpetrators of 
this hasty act. 
  At the same time, we warn the responsible international 
factors that the RSK will not tolerate any attempts to resolve 
its future political status through pressures, regardless of 
where they might come from. 
  This is all from Knin for the time being -- a statement by 
RSK President Milan Martic in light of the NATO attack.

Culture and Repose; Another Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
Preelection Rally"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava--The overcrowded Theater Hall of the 
Park of Culture and Repose was the scene of the second 
preelection rally of Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] 
(and Slovak National Party) supporters last night. It was 
addressed by most members of the "shadow cabinet," with Vladimir 
Meciar at the head. [passage omitted] 
  Responding to the criticism of the so-called wild 
privatization in the last weeks and days of his government, 
Vladimir Meciar declared that, in this way, the government 
wanted to prevent the sellout of state property abroad and make 
it possible for the employees of the privatized companies to 
become their co-owners. [Former Minister of Culture] Dusan 
Slobodnik told the rally in this context that the fall of 
Meciar's government has been contributed to also by a certain 
sector of foreign capital, which supposedly needed a more pliant 
Slovak Government. The HZDS chairman spoke, furthermore, about 
various pressures to sell the Slovak gas industry. A certain 
Western financial group has supposedly offered our high-ranking 
officials a commission of 1.6 billion korunas for being helpful 
in this transaction. The HZDS Club of Deputies intends to 
disclose the details at a meeting of the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic, where it also plans to expose other facts about 
the interest of some members of the present government in the 
privatization of specific companies, about attempts to restore 
Czechoslovakia, about the unlawful activities of the 
Presidential Office, and the like. The main speaker also 
criticized the provisional government's excessively 
accommodating attitude toward, in particular, the Czech Republic 
and Hungary, whereby it supposedly goes beyond the limits of 
Slovakia's state interests. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Bulgarian Socialist Party leader Zhan </F>
Videnov by Rozalina Evdokimova; place and date not given: 
"Urgent Changes in Government Are Needed"] 
  [Excerpts] [Evdokimova] Mr. Videnov, do you see a 
coincidence between the interview President Zhelev gave to the 
BBC British radio station and the arrival of observers of the 
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Bulgaria, who 
will analyze the political situation and "recommunization" in 
Bulgaria? 
  [Videnov] I do not think that there is such a connection, 
however, it is obvious that ideological statements and 
scholastic disputes, as well as deliberately fanning 
confrontation rather than discussing the real socioeconomic 
problems of the Bulgarians today, are a basic issue for 
President Zhelev, and for people who do not know our country's 
reality. It is not strange that foreigners assume such a 
position. They are far away from the country's reality and not 
especially concerned with its real problems. However, the 
position of the president is absolutely inadmissible for any 
head of state. 
  [Evdokimova] Mr. Zhelev devoted a lot of space in his 
interview to the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] and the 
situation in our country. Speaking about the BSP's support for 
the cabinet, Mr. Zhelev said that this is nothing else but a 
road leading to new elections, already in the fall. What could 
you say about this? 
  [Videnov] The fact that the cabinet relies on the BSP 
despite the fact that Berov's cabinet contains many BSP 
opponents from the near and remote past, implies that the BSP is 
a highly responsible, state-responsible, and competent party, 
capable of participating in the government (unlike the other 
parties, which regardless of the people's vote results, are 
unable of translating this vote to governing). I include among 
these parties the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] that 
President Zhelev likes so much, and even the president himself, 
as former SDS leader. Within the framework of the confidence 
received by the people in 1991 the BSP helps the country to 
resolve its most urgent problems. It is the success or failure 
of these efforts that will determine when Bulgaria will head 
toward new elections. It must be pointed out that these are the 
efforts of the entire country, rather than the efforts of a 
single party or the government. [passage omitted] 
  [Evdokimova] The BSP is being ever more frequently accused 
of being responsible for the economic and social situation that 
emerged in the country, and for supporting a cabinet that cannot 
do its job. What could you say about this? 
  [Videnov] The situation could be corrected through early 
parliamentary elections. If someone thinks that he is ready for 
such a step toward decisively improving the situation in the 
country, let him convince the people that they should 
participate in such a step. However, the people are not 
convinced of this. It is not clear what early elections could 
contribute to the country. As long as the cabinet remains 
within the framework of its program and tries to move things 
forward, it could rely on a certain parliamentary consensus. 
This support will be denied when the cabinet fails. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Evdokimova] Will you demand personnel changes in the 
cabinet? 
  [Videnov] Of course. They are absolutely necessary and 
should have been effected immediately after the budget was 
adopted. The changes have been postponed because of the prime 
minister's illness, however, they will become topical again, as 
soon as next week.

which a meeting between PLO leader Yasir `Arafat and Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres will be held in Bucharest on 15 
April, a possibility assessed by Palestinian sources in Tunis as 
not very likely, our correspondent Eugen Baboi, who is 
accredited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, contacted 
Ministry spokesman Mircea Geoana, who said the following: The 
Romanian Foreign Ministry has no knowledge of such an event. 
The Foreign Ministry sent an invitation to `Arafat and Peres to 
participate in the proceedings of the Crans Montana Forum that 
will be held in Bucharest on 21-24 April, but it is still 
waiting for confirmation regarding the participation of the two 
officials. Therefore, the Romanian side cannot comment on the 
information regarding an `Arafat-Peres meeting in Bucharest on 
15 April because it has no knowledge of such a meeting.

  [Text] Four Romanian citizens who had been condemned in 
Iraq for entering that country illegally were released this 
morning from a prison near the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. The 
pardon decree was signed last night by Iraqi President Saddam 
Husayn, following a request by Romanian President Ion Iliescu. 
  A press release received from the Romanian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs notes that the message addressed in this respect 
by the head of the Romanian state to his Iraqi counterpart was 
handed over yesterday to Iraqi Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn 
Khudayyir by Marcel Dinu, secretary of state with the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and special envoy of Romania's president. 
  The names of the four citizens are Danila Dumitru, Nicolae 
Aghachi, Florin Boiga, and Gabriel Encea. The formalities for 
bringing the four of them back to Romania with the assistance of 
the TAROM company are being completed by the Romanian Foreign 
Ministry through Romania's embassies in Baghdad and Amman. Their 
arrival in Bucharest is scheduled for 13 April at 1400 on a 
TAROM flight from Amman.

  [Text] Willy Claes, Belgian deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister, held several meetings with Romanian officials 
today. During this morning's meeting with Senate President 
Oliviu Gherman the guest withdrew for a few minutes for a 
telephone conversation, trying to reach UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali to discuss the serious worsening of the 
situation in Rwanda. Ten Belgian UN troops were killed in the 
Kigali incidents. 
  Also at the meeting with the president of the Senate, which 
was devoted to discussions about the political and economic 
situation in our country, prospects for the Partnership for 
Peace, and relations with the European Union, Claes announced 
that he will cut his visit short to participate, together with 
his colleagues, in a government meeting in Brussels that will 
examine the situation in Rwanda. 
  Our correspondent also informed us that in a second round of 
official talks this morning between Claes and Romanian Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu, the sides examined international 
issues, particularly the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Melescanu 
briefed his counterpart on his contacts in Athens and the visits 
to Bucharest of Presidents Slobodan Milosevic and Suleyman 
Demirel; he also discussed the Romanian position regarding the 
need to involve Bosnian Serbs in the peace process. 
  The sides also examined developments in the former Soviet 
Union, especially in the Russian Federation and Ukraine. The 
Romanian side also informed the guest about aspects of our 
relations with neighboring countries: Hungary, Bulgaria, and 
the Republic of Moldova. Willy Claes noted that one of the 
major elements in addressing developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
is the UN sanctions policy. The Belgian guest expressed the 
view that it was imperative to reach an accord on the three 
approaches to this issue: the American, the Russian, and the 
European Community's. 
  The two foreign ministers also examined aspects of the 
Partnership for Peace and the Balladur Pact. Belgium believes 
that an enlarged Europe is also a stable Europe. 
  After the talks, the two foreign ministers signed the joint 
political declaration between Romania and the Kingdom of 
Belgium. Mr. Melescanu was invited to pay a visit to Belgium.

  [Text] The second congress of the Socialist Party of Labor 
[PSM], which concluded in Bucharest on 10 April, reelected Ilie 
Verdet to the position of president of this political formation. 
The Steering Council of the party also includes the following 
members: Adrian Paunescu, first deputy president, and Tudor 
Mohora, Traian Dudas, Maria Lazar, Nicolae Ontanu, Mihai 
Paraluta, and Ion Sasu, vice presidents. 
  The congress adopted two motions. One proposes that the 
parliament adopt a law on the need for the state to grant 
compensation to former owners and to grant tenants the right to 
purchase flats that they currently occupy. The second motion 
asks all bodies of the current leadership to free all political 
detainees, that is, deputy members of the Executive Political 
Committee of the former Romanian Communist Party and to 
eliminate all forms of instigation to hatred, revenge, and 
extremism. 
  In his statement to Bucharest Radio station, party President 
Ilie Verdet affirmed that the proposed objectives have been 
achieved and, as far as the election of the new leadership 
bodies of the party are concerned, the goal was to renew them by 
admitting younger people to the ranks of the party. One can 
state, said Ilie Verdet in conclusion, that the PSM is a new and 
democratic party, suitable for entering the competition for 
ruling.

<F P=106> [Bogdana Paun report: "Three of the Ethnic Hungarians </F>
Pardoned by Iliescu Have Not Been Released From Jail"] 
  [Text] Three of the eight ethnic Hungarian convicts who 
were pardoned by Ion Iliescu, namely Istvan Illyes, Ferenc 
Boldizsar (both inhabitants of the village of Zetea), and Mihaly 
Balint (of Cristuru Secuiesc), have not been released from jail, 
although their names were also mentioned in the presidential 
pardon. 
  In the case of the three named persons, the presidential 
initiative was overruled by the Alba Iulia City Court. The 
reason given was the unfavorable report of the Aiud penitentiary 
direction. The report cites an attempted breakout (Illyes), the 
slapping of the face of a cellmate (Balint), and the gravity of 
the crime for which he was convicted (Boldizsar). 
  All three have appealed the Alba Iulia Court decision. 
  "The UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania] 
lawyers 
and parliamentarians will take all possible legal steps to have 
them released and to have the presidential decree applied in 
their case as well," says a UDMR communique.

<F P=106> [Interview with Romanian President Ion Iliescu by Polish </F>
Television representatives; place and date not given: "There Is 
No Other Way But To Further Consolidate the Democratic 
Organization of Society and Promote Economic Reforms and the 
Transition to the Market Economy"] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Mr. President, a few months ago you 
said that the atmosphere in Europe is more favorable toward 
Romania. Would you still say that today? 
  [Iliescu] Yes, generally speaking I would say that this is 
still valid today, despite the fact that new elements of tension 
have emerged in Bosnia and Yugoslavia and that we are faced with 
a tense moment in our domestic political life, linked to the 
ongoing negotiations among the parties. However, regarding the 
overall perception of Romania in Europe, I would say that my 
assessment still applies. 
  [Reporter] What can you tell us about the internal 
atmosphere currently prevailing in Romania? 
  [Iliescu] There are two elements. First, the difficult 
situation of the economy and the people's social and living 
conditions. There has been a general deterioration in the past 
four years, due to the dismantling of the internal structures of 
the former centralized economic system and the transition to the 
market economy, which is a most complicated and difficult 
process. Second, there is the international aspect of our 
economic relations, characterized by the disappearance of our 
traditional markets and of our traditional sources of energy and 
raw materials. All this has created a very difficult situation 
for our economy. To all this, one should add the external 
sources of tension -- such as Yugoslavia, the former Soviet 
Union, or the loss of the traditional markets in the Arab 
countries, in the wake of the Gulf crisis -- and the general 
world recession and economic crisis. All this has had a most 
unfavorable impact on our economy. Right now, our industry only 
works at half capacity, unemployment has become a widespread 
phenomenon, with more than 1 million people out of a job, and 
inflation is growing at an intensive pace. All this has led to 
the deterioration of the people's living standard and is a 
source of social tension and dissatisfaction for the population. 
The second aspect refers to the political situation. After the 
last elections, the Parliament has acquired a structure that 
does not allow any party to have a majority and form a stable 
government. 
  [Reporter] Does that mean that the government does not have 
a majority in Parliament? 
  [Iliescu] It does not. The party that supports the 
government only has 34 percent of the seats in Parliament. It 
is the largest number of Parliament seats obtained by a single 
party. Consequently, we tried to put together a coalition 
platform after the last elections held in the fall of 1992. I 
even suggested the creation of a national unity government, with 
the representation and involvement of all political parties. At 
that time, I thought that, in view of the difficult conditions 
of the country, that initiative would have been useful and might 
have constituted a political signal for the readiness of all 
political forces to make a common effort. However, the 
opposition parties did not accept my proposal. They wanted to 
join the government, provided that they held the "levers of 
power," as Mr. Corneliu Coposu, president of the National 
Peasant Christian Democratic Party [PNTCD], said, that is, they 
wanted to hold all instruments that would enable them to control 
the power. But how can one control all levers if one does not 
have the majority in Parliament? One must achieve certain 
relations and understandings and even a coalition with other 
parties. Consequently, we did not manage to form a coalition and 
not even a political pact of all parties -- something that I 
suggested at the time -- as a foundation and framework for 
cooperation, as happened in Spain with the Moncloa Pact. Such 
round tables and talks took place even in Poland and Hungary, 
where a kind of political accord was struck among the political 
forces there. But all these proposals were rejected and we were 
obliged to form a minority government, which has always had to 
perform some balancing act in order to promote the legislative 
initiatives. In the past two-three months, I have tried to 
initiate new dialogues with all political parties in this 
respect. 
  [Reporter] How do you assess these dialogues? 
  [Iliescu] It was good, sincere, and open dialogue, and, what 
is more, it was my dialogue with all the political parties. A 
round table is now going on among the parties, since reaching an 
understanding should be the result of consultations among the 
parties. I am not a partner in political discussions among the 
parties. I have only mediated this dialogue. The Social 
Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], which supports the 
government, is now engaged in such negotiations. We will see 
what the final result of these discussions is going to be. 
  [Reporter] What can you tell us about the trade unions? 
  [Iliescu] This is the second aspect of the problem. In 
this climate of social tensions, the trade unions are obviously 
very active and there have been movements, strikes, claims, and 
so forth. However, I believe that all this has also had a 
positive aspect. I have personally met with the representatives 
of the three most important trade union federations and we 
conducted a pretty civilized dialogue. They are now conducting 
talks with the government representatives to finalize the 
problem of the collective contracts for this year. There are 
many claims, of which quite a few are pretty unrealistic, in 
view of the real situation, but there are also certain positive 
elements. The trade unions have declared their endorsement for 
the Memorandum with the IMF, but at the same time they are 
asking for social compensations that are not realistic in view 
of our current possibilities. Therefore, all this should be 
discussed and negotiated and I believe that such talks could be 
held right now. 
  [Reporter] Who, in your opinion, holds the true power in 
Romania? 
  [Iliescu] It depends on what you mean by that, since our 
country is now organized on democratic bases and it has a 
democratic Constitution, which includes all elements 
characteristic of a democratic state. There are concrete 
provisions in connection with the role of each element of power: 
the Parliament, with its prerogatives, the government, as an 
executive body, the presidency, as a mediating element between 
the levers of power, and so forth. We have this scheme of our 
country's organization and there is no concentration of power in 
the hands of a single person or institution. 
  [Reporter] What do you think about the discontent among 
Romania's population? 
  [Iliescu] It is a normal reaction. When a country's economy 
collapses, you cannot improve living standards. It is obvious 
that people are not satisfied with explanations alone, since a 
popular revolt took place in Romania -- a social explosion which 
characterized the Romanian revolution of December 1989 -- and 
the most important reason for that revolt was the low level of 
the living standard. Of course, everybody accepts the idea that 
we have more freedom and democracy, but they are dissatisfied 
with the fact that the living standard has not gone up. This is 
obvious to everyone. However, we must take into consideration 
the objective situation and openly discuss it: There is no 
other way but to further consolidate the democratic organization 
of society and promote economic reforms and the transition to 
the market economy. But all this requires effort, work, and 
social discipline as well as the acceptance of this reality by 
everyone. 
  [Reporter] Is this your perception of the new democracy? 
  [Iliescu] I do not understand what you mean by that. 
  [Reporter] There are new democracies in all our countries, 
in Poland, Romania, and the former Soviet Union. You said that 
this is the road toward the new democracy, am I right? 
  [Iliescu] By new democracy -- since democracy has existed 
before, in history -- I mean the existence of the new reality of 
the state's democratic organizations, since we did not have 
democracy before, in our country. It was the monopoly of a 
single party, since we had a totalitarian regime here and a 
dictatorship of a single family and single man. Hence, one 
cannot talk of democracy in our country. Now, we have entered a 
new stage of our development -- a democratic stage for the 
Romanian society. 
  [Reporter] You once said that Romania is isolated in Europe, 
but Romania is a member of the Council of Europe, it is the 
first country that signed the Partnership for Peace scheme, and 
so forth. Do you still maintain that your country is isolated in 
Europe? 
  [Iliescu] I have never said Romania was isolated. This may 
be the interpretation of others. We may be more or less pleased 
with the level of our relations and links with other states of 
international political forces, but I do not think and never 
thought that Romania has been isolated in this period. There 
is, of course, the issue of the range of our relations. Now, 
this is another aspect, linked to the development of our 
relations and the degree of trust extant on the continent. I 
noted many similar expressions of discontent from many leaders 
or political forces from Eastern or Central Europe in connection 
with the support received from the West. Even Mr. Lech Walesa 
has often expressed his discontent with Western support and the 
West's real opening toward our countries, which are now going 
through such a very difficult period of changes. Mr. Vaclav 
Klaus, the prime minister of Czechoslovakia [as published] -- 
one of the countries with the best situations in this respect, 
which has not faced the same difficulties as Romania -- is still 
displeased with the climate of cooperation with the West. The 
Western countries have developed a kind of protection screen 
vis-a- vis our countries. I said that at a meeting of the World 
Economic Forum held in Crans-Montana, last year: I said that 
the last chance for the Western countries currently going 
through an economic recession as well as for us is to open 
economic relations between us and to grant each other mutual 
support for the economic recovery in our countries. 
  This would be a chance for the West to overcome the present 
economic situation. We will thus be able to say that we all 
have the political strength to revise and inaugurate a new 
philosophy and perception as well as a new understanding of the 
economic relations among all the European countries. We have 
overcome the "iron curtain" in political, military, and 
ideological relations, but we are witnessing the raising of a 
new economic curtain. We must overcome this situation, too, so 
as to create better conditions for our economic relations, on 
the basis of equal partnership. I said that, if the West looks 
upon our countries only as a hinterland for the developed 
countries and a potential market for their products and not as 
equal partners, both of us will suffer. We must jointly build a 
new community of equal partnership on our continent. 
  [Reporter] How do you see your integration in Europe's 
political and cultural life? 
  [Iliescu] I believe that this will be achieved by life 
itself, since all our countries are European and European 
history and culture is the synthesis of all national cultures 
and histories of all European countries. After a long 
separation in two parts, we will have to build a new Europe, a 
new united Europe, which can make use of all these assets and 
all this patrimony of our culture. 
  [Reporter] What is your opinion about the relations between 
Romania and Poland? 
  [Iliescu] I believe that we have a very good tradition of 
relations throughout history and we can say that our countries 
have gone through some very troubled times. Our nations have 
had to suffer throughout history because of the great European 
powers. We are situated in this part of Europe, where the 
interests of three great European powers, which dominated this 
region, met: the Ottoman Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, 
and the Russian one. For several centuries on end, we suffered 
because of this foreign domination. In its turn, Poland did not 
have a better situation either, since its geographical position 
placed it between two large empires, the Russian and German one. 
Therefore, there are many similarities between our destinies in 
this respect. At the same time, there have been mutual 
sentiments of solidarity between our countries during some very 
difficult moments of our history and I can say that the Romanian 
people have always nurtured sentiments of friendship, empathy, 
and solidarity for the Polish people. I believe we should use 
this tradition to the benefit of both countries. At this point, 
we are going through similar difficult moments in our history, 
since we are building the new structure of our democratic states 
and an economy that must be efficient, competitive, and useful 
for our nations. All this will be achieved with great efforts. 
In these circumstances, our cooperation can be useful for both 
our countries and I believe that we have a lot to do to improve 
the cooperation between us. I believe that there is room for us 
to make a greater contribution -- I am particularly referring to 
the political forces and leaders of our countries -- to building 
a network of cooperation in all respects, that is the political, 
economic, social, cultural, scientific, and human spheres. 
  [Reporter] Who in Romania wants the return of King Mihai? 
  [Iliescu] You know, at this time of change, when we are 
faced with great hardships, many people look back and think that 
it was better in the past. We have all sorts of people struck 
by nostalgia -- people longing for the near past, which is not 
considered as having been democratic, but which provided greater 
stability for the people and a kind of social protection; and 
people longing for our country's pre-war past. The latter see 
the monarchy as a solution for Romania, but I believe that we 
should be looking forward, not backward. The only way for us is 
to go toward the future, not the past. 
  [Reporter] What is your opinion about the nostalgia -- or 
maybe we should call it empathy -- for Marshal Antonescu 
[Romanian dictator during World War II]? 
  [Iliescu] Again, it has to do with people longing for the 
past. Of course, we must write an objective history of our 
country, since it has been deformed. Antonescu is a very 
controversial figure. For some people, he was a hero, because 
he led the country at a very critical moment, when our country 
was threatened from the outside, after the dictatorship of King 
Carol II was demolished and the fascist-Iron Guardist elements 
came to power, with Antonescu's help. Antonescu was the savior 
of the Romanian state at that time and he also took the decision 
to liberate the territories occupied by the Soviet Union. 
Therefore, he is considered a historical hero by some people, 
who nevertheless ignore the fact that Antonescu was also an ally 
of fascist Germany and of the Romanian fascists, with whose help 
he took over power. They also disregard the fact that he pushed 
Romania not only into the war against the Soviet Union, but also 
against the coalition of democratic states, and that he is 
responsible for that before history. However, there will still 
be many controversies on this subject. 
  [Reporter] Is it possible to achieve unification between 
Moldova and Romania and when will this happen? 
  [Iliescu] This is a matter of history. We have to take 
realities into consideration. Of course, from a historical and 
legal viewpoint, the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact was an erroneous 
decision and measure that led to the domination of this part of 
Europe by both fascist Germany and the Soviet Union. At the 
same time, we must also take into account the circumstances of 
the post- war period and the existing international documents on 
the stability of borders and the integrity of the present 
states. These are also realities that we must accept. One 
should also take into consideration the emotional aspect, that 
is the subjective sentiments referring to our history and 
theories as well as the feelings referring to our fellow 
nationals living beyond the country's borders. However, in 
politics one should also take reality into consideration. The 
same applies to Poland: The problem of territories that have 
changed hands during history cannot be resolved only with 
sentiments, but must be examined with great realism. 
  [Reporter] In your capacity as president of Romania, how do 
you see your country's future? 
  [Iliescu] I see it in the only possible way one can see such 
things, that is optimistically. We must preserve our hope in a 
better evolution for our country and I believe that we have good 
reason to do so. We have a good human potential, which 
represents the basic element of the evolution of contemporary 
society. Despite the difficulties facing us, I have trust in 
our people's potential, creativity, and capacity to overcome all 
difficulties and integrate Romania in the civilized world. 
  [Reporter] I wish you all the best. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Adrian Nastase, executive president of the </F>

date not given: "A Modern Social Democracy; A Normal 
Parliamentary Life"] 
  [Excerpts] 
<H5>  Human Rights, an End of Century Religion </H5>
  [Pavelescu] Mr. President, do you believe that the world 
should know more about one of the most important people in the 
leadership of this country? 
  [Nastase] To tell you the truth, for quite some time now I 
have not been approached with such questions as "What have you 
done in the past four years?" Still, if you wish to know more 
about me, I am ready to tell you. I was born in Bucharest on 22 
June 1950, under the sign of Cancer, a terrible sign for those 
who choose politics for their field of activity. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Pavelescu] Now, I will approach you in your capacity as 
president of the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania]. 
Recently you have embarked fully on the activity of organizing 
this political formation. You have paid visits in provinces and 
attended symposiums. All this leads to the impending question: 
People said of your party that it was established 
instantaneously around the president of Romania Ion Iliescu, 
whose immense prestige permitted the party to achieve stability 
very quickly, on a somehow sentimental basis. What is left of 
the initial feeling and what are the current goals? 
  [Nastase] Certainly there is still immense sympathy for Mr. 
Ion Iliescu, who has assumed the responsibility to pull Romania 
out of the crisis and certain people, not able to discredit him, 
resort to the uncivilized means of insults. Only a person who 
possesses such qualities as the head of our state, democratic 
through his entire structure, tolerant and conciliatory, can 
continue untouched by these ignoble attacks. But since you have 
referred to the party and its destiny, I will give you a frank 
answer. No political formation can survive if it does not 
construct its structures and activity on modern bases. After 
the [December 1989] revolution, some associations were set up 
that were mostly against rather than in favor of something. The 
FSN [National Salvation Front] itself was against the past, 
super-centralized dictatorship in the economy, suffocated in 
politics, like a house that has not been aired for a long time 
and which the rejuvenating flow of life has not penetrated. The 
Civic Alliance was established in the same way. This is to give 
you just two examples. All these structures can no longer 
resist the new conditions. As far as we are concerned, the 
change of name that took place at our party's last congress, 
from FDSN [Democratic National Salvation Front] into PDSR 
[Social Democracy Party of Romania] was not only a formal 
modification but it was conceived as a fundamental change in our 
way of thinking and in our actions. We wished to establish an 
intelligent party that has its own message to promote. 
<H5>  We Have an Economic Concept That Is Capable of Inspiring </H5>
Dynamism and Efficiency in Our Society 
  [Pavelescu] Now, we are going to talk about a sensitive 
area, namely about ideas. On what doctrine do you base your 
activity? 
  [Nastase] It is definitely the modern social-democratic 
doctrine, that so many social-democratic parties in Europe and 
in the world follow. It has been emphatically stated that 
social democracy does not have its own concept in the economic 
area. This is a completely false idea. In Europe at least, 
social-democracy has formed its own school of managers and has 
experts capable of conferring dynamism to economic life and 
inspiring the motivating force that is necessary in our century. 
One should not assign a purely social component to 
social-democracy. This would look as if in the same society 
there were two models of society, one for production and another 
one for distribution of production. This could be compared to a 
car with two engines and two steering-wheels. This is absurd. 
We have one single concept, which we could call an integrating 
one, which is capable of incorporating the economic, managerial, 
and social-human progress in one and the same vision. In fact, 
we define more precisely the relationship between individual and 
the productive sphere. Likewise, we have an individual concept 
about economic areas or sectors and about the area of 
production, and services. The way in which we regard things 
allows us to introduce new, individual elements in our social- 
economic life and not elements borrowed from abroad. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Pavelescu] Thus, could we assume that the PDSR views itself 
as a party which, through its program and its activity, 
constantly wishes to ensure the economic and social 
modernization of the country, in order to eliminate the remnants 
of the excessive centralism of the past and to create new 
sources of dynamism in both areas? 
  [Nastase] This could be a good definition for a continuously 
changing reality. 
  [Pavelescu] But what are we going to do about those who 
dispute all this? They continue to accuse you of every possible 
sin or charge you with the most extravagant intentions.... 
  [Nastase] We have lived too long in the atmosphere of 
clashes between socialism and capitalism. Thus, we got used to 
answering questions about the future only with terms created in 
this confrontation. But this seems to me to be a simplistic and 
incorrect attitude. Socialism has an emotional impact on fewer 
and fewer people. On the other hand, capitalism still seems to 
us permeated with too many negative connotations at the 
political and social level for it to represent the miraculous 
key or the magic word with a strong magnetic force. Through our 
ideology, we have found solutions for the better organization of 
relations between individual and society. This is the essence 
of our concept. How do we regard this relationship? We cannot 
formulate it correctly without also referring to the role of the 
state. We believe that at least for the transition period, the 
state has an important role to play. We cannot pretend that all 
that is happening in the area of production relations does not 
concern us. 
  [Pavelescu] At a symposium organized at Poiana Brasov, Mr. 
Mircea Cosea [chairman of the Council for Coordination, 
Strategy, and Economic Reform] made a speech in which he drew 
attention to the fact that the concept of the market economy 
must be applied in such a way that the ordinary individual 
should regard it as a necessity. Was he speaking on behalf of 
the PDSR? 
  [Nastase] This is a rhetorical question. Certainly, Mr. 
Cosea included in his idea the party whose member he is. At the 
same time, referring to the market economy as if we had a 
choice, is wrong. The market economy has been implemented all 
around us. We cannot stay isolated. It would be as if we were 
to choose another rail gauge for our engines. This is 
inconceivable. The problem however is that we should work in a 
way that could make people perceive other effects, not only the 
negative effects of this economy, such as the increase of 
prices, inflation, and unemployment. 
<H5>  Optimal Conditions for Competition, for Contest </H5>
  [Pavelescu] Do you have a solution? 
  [Nastase] There are solutions. I was not the one who 
invented them. Optimal conditions must be created for economic 
competition. We should eliminate monopolies that generate high 
and disproportionate prices, bureaucracy, and corruption. 
However, we can see a vicious circle here. We need 
restructuring and financial sources to permit the development of 
industries, and they, in turn, can establish the framework for 
the operation of the laws of competition. This is our 
understanding of the way in which we can emerge from the current 
impasse. And we have to do it alone. Nobody will work for us. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Pavelescu] Mr. President, how do you explain that while you 
remain a party that is closely connected with the 1989 December 
revolution, thus not marked by the defects of the past, your 
influence in universities is still poor? 
  [Nastase] There is a very simple explanation for this. 
Certain university teachers, who were also part of the old 
structures, have repainted their past, have bluffed and continue 
to bluff, and attract students. This situation is anomalous. 
Students all over the world are basically left-oriented. Only 
in our country have the students' opinions deviated. 
  [Pavelescu] And God forbid that a basically right-wing 
concept should penetrate the students' world. 
  [Nastase] You are right. We are trying to get closer to 
this section. Basically, their interests are closely connected 
with those that we are fighting for. We are going to establish 
a Youth Forum. The university group will play an important role 
in this forum. 
  [Pavelescu] Considering that yours is such a young party, 
you have not had time to take care of other, important social 
strata of the electorate. Why, for example should so many women 
vote for the PD(FSN) [Democratic Party (National Salvation 
Front)] when, as a matter of fact, that party has brought them 
only disappointment? 
  [Nastase] I believe that in principle our viewpoints come 
quite close. We intend to organize a PDSR Women's Association. 
In general terms, due to past frustrations and due to our 
negligence -- I have to be frank here -- the proportion of women 
in the structure of our leadership is insignificant. By all 
means, we will correct this mistake. And you will see that the 
number of women ready to join us will increase. The days when 
people voted on the basis of feelings are gone. This is certain. 
  [Pavelescu] What type of organizational formula have you 
adopted? 
  [Nastase] Those that are included in our statute: local 
organizations, coordination councils, the executive bureau, and 
the standing delegation. We continually follow aspects that are 
gradually becoming our distinctive features: representation and 
democracy. 
<H5>  The PDSR Has Become and Will Remain a Political Force </H5>
  [Pavelescu] Therefore, can one say that the PDSR has become 
a powerful force? 
  [Nastase] One can say that. Why not? And it will continue 
to grow stronger. We need a few months to organize our 
strategy. We will increase our activity in the provinces. In 
the coming period, Mr. Oliviu Gherman [PDSR president] and other 
members of the party leadership will participate in activities 
that are aimed at enhancing the organization of our branches in 
the provinces, will hold theoretical debates with a practical 
character, and will disseminate our precise message. 
  [Pavelescu] Thus, those who consider the PDSR a party of 
pedants are mistaken!... 
  [Nastase] They are utterly mistaken. We are a militant 
party. If this characteristic does not take concrete shape in 
what Mihai Eminescu [Romanian poet] called "ugly street scenes" 
it is because we detest the idea of turning the street into a 
place where political disputes are solved. However, those who 
mistake our good manners for weakness are wrong. What is new 
and noteworthy in our activity is the combination of joint 
actions, with the participation of party cadres and, considering 
that we are the ruling party, with the members of the executive. 
This fact is beneficial for two reasons. The FSN made a 
mistake in leaving the government in charge of dialogue on all 
issues after the May 1990 election. The party felt in a way 
neglected. We wish to make good this error. Therefore, we 
approach the local party organizations with groups of people 
that include both members of the party and of the executive. The 
government members can only gain from seeing everything on the 
spot. The members of the party leadership can also only gain 
when they take over a part of the responsibility. 
  [Pavelescu] A modern party, with a clear message, and with 
viable structures, thus a party that is constantly increasing 
its mobilizing force -- is this the way you want to appear in 
the eye of the public? 
  [Nastase] This is more or less what we are and this is 
definitely what we want to become! 

<H5>    We Try To Find Ways for Cooperation With All Political </H5>
Forces in the Parliament 
  [Pavelescu] I am going to approach you now in your capacity 
as president of the Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian 
Parliament. Is it only our impression or are you really annoyed 
with the Chamber? 
  [Nastase] Annoyed might be a little too strong an 
expression. Dissatisfied, yes. And I have reason to be. An 
atmosphere that is at variance with the rules for a proper 
functioning of such an institution has been established in the 
Chamber of Deputies. There are deputies who are absent without 
any reason. Others ask their friends to sign the attendance book 
for them. Therefore, often we do not have the necessary number 
of deputies to adopt certain laws. However, I have to tell you 
something else. If you ask any president of a Chamber of 
Deputies, you will see that they have the same reasons for 
discontent. A parliament often looks like an undisciplined 
structure, a machine that is working to no avail. However, a 
very important aspect can be overlooked: We, at the level of 
parliament, absorb a great amount of tension which would 
otherwise overflow the streets with consequences that would be 
difficult to estimate. 
  [Pavelescu] I am not concealing the impression that a part 
of the public perceives things a little differently. The 
impression exists that we are witnessing two types of blockage: 
an economic and a legislative blockage, which fuel each other. 
What is your view on this issue? 
  [Nastase] This is an exaggeration. You should not forget 
that the parliament is also a sort of mirror of the nation's 
wishes, its symbol. If the nation had wanted a parliament in 
which the PDSR held 51 percent of the deputies and senators, the 
nation would have acted accordingly. But the nation chose the 
current situation and we have to respect its will. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Pavelescu] You have initiated a dialogue in which, 
willingly or unwillingly, virtually all political forces 
representing the parliamentary spectrum participated. Are you 
pleased with it? 
  [Nastase] Do you want a sincere answer? We believe that it 
was a good idea. As a matter of fact, dialogue should become a 
regular component of the public life in Romania. It is sad that 
some people considered it as an exceptional case. We tried to 
carry out a certain inter-party exercise of democracy. Because 
apart from our options, we are also duty-bound to cooperate in 
order to reach our well-defined goals and stop what used to be 
called the cold war after the elections. 
  [Pavelescu] Have you had any results so far? 
  [Nastase] I believe so. For example, we succeed in changing 
at least our way of approaching others. Therefore, when Mr. 
Dinu Patriciu [prominent leader of the Liberal Party '93] so 
rudely attacked the entire PDSR, it was easy for us to isolate 
him, to turn it into an example and not a rule. And please note 
that we have not identified for a moment the whole Liberal Party 
'93 with the respective deputy. In any event, we will not hold 
talks with him before he apologizes. However, the dialogue had 
exceptional results from another aspect. It changed the image of 
the PDSR. The party that has been labelled in every possible 
way, has proved that it has been accepted indeed. Thus, the 
effort was worthwhile. 
  [Pavelescu] The Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] 
accuses you of preparing for early elections. To what extent is 
this affirmation true or false? 
  [Nastase] Certain parties -- for example the PD(FSN) -- have 
publicly announced their intention to induce early elections. 
Other parties, including the CDR, are preparing for those 
elections although they are apprehensive about the future. In 
these conditions we would be naive just to stand aside and wait. 
As we have declared, we consider this solution of early 
elections as the worst and the most uninspired one. It would 
block us for a while without offering anything to anybody in 
exchange. However, if we are faced with such an alternative, we 
will act accordingly. Nevertheless, I believe that the position 
we expressed publicly was not properly understood. 
  [Pavelescu] What are you referring to? 
  [Nastase] I am referring to the need that before early 
general elections early, local elections should be organized. I 
am saying this because a somewhat paradoxical situation has been 
created. At the last local elections we were not a party. 
Therefore, among the leaders of counties and of Bucharest 
sectors, many people who are members of the Democratic 
Convention or members of the PD(FSN) were elected. It is clear 
that early general elections will be organized with the same 
competing ideas, thus the results can already be anticipated. 
Therefore, we are going to propose a modification of the law on 
public administration and the electoral law, so that our 
representation corresponds to the proportion of the electorate 
that votes for us. Any form of action aimed at undermining this 
procedure will be interpreted only as a measure of "arrogant 
egoism" just to quote Roman [PD(FSN) leader]. 
  [Pavelescu] Mr. President, since you have been so patient 
with us, we cannot resist the temptation to ask you a question 
that will probably seem to you inappropriate. Do you believe 
that the UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania] has 
committed itself to obstructing the leadership forever? 
  [Nastase] I am going to answer you truthfully. Recently in 
Cluj I addressed this formation and asked them to show a more 
reasonable attitude. Well, let me tell you that I received a 
number of positive signs. This means that your question was not 
exactly inappropriate.

<F P=106> [Radu Stefanescu report: "PDSR Is Forcing the </F>
Politicization of the Romanian Army"] 
  [Text] The leadership of the Social Democracy Party of 
Romania [PDSR], in the person of its executive chairman, Adrian 
Nastase, has begun a sustained offensive intended to politically 
enroll the Romanian Army. This action of the ruling party is 
openly backed by Minister of National Defense Gheorghe Tinca and 
tacitly supported by the head of the general chief of staff, 
Lieutenant General Dumitru Cioflina. 
  During the recent electoral tour of Adrian Nastase, also 
nicknamed "Sweety" [Bombonel], he tried to make the army 
division heads and even the army commanders join the PDSR. 
Specific similar cases were reported in Buzau and Craiova. 
  After a strong rapprochement with the East, Gheorghe Tinca 
accepts the excessive politicization of the army personally 
attending to the PDSR's electoral actions, along with the head 
of the chief of General Staff. After the elimination of [former 
Defense Minister] Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu, the chiefs 
of the National Defense Ministry departments were actually 
expecting a concentrated counteroffensive from the PDSR. 
Currently that counteroffensive is stronger than ever, and the 
"mastermind" behind this politicization campaign being none 
other than Adrian Nastase, also nicknamed "Sweety."

<F P=106> [Report by Teodora Encheva] </F>
  [Text] STANDART NEWS learned on 5 April that Father 
Gelemenov's "skinheads," Dr. Ivan Georgiev's people, Russian 
Cossacks, and Bulgarian volunteers are ready to leave for Serbia 
as soon as Turkey sends "Blue Helmets" there. The Fatherland 
Party of Labor [OPT] and the Russian All-National Union 
[Ruskiyat obshtenaroden suyuz] (ROS) have informed the state 
leaderships of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Russian 
Federation that they will send volunteers to our western 
neighbor with a view to ensuring equilibrium. Anatoliy 
Dolgopolov, a Cossack from the Kuban and a parliament deputy of 
the Russian Path party, declared: I think that no state or 
parliament will forget about its peoples and fail to protect 
them. At the moment I have no troops, Dolgopolov said, but if 
anyone dares to encroach upon Bulgaria's interests...," 
suggestively failing to complete his sentence. 
  Father Gelemenov told STANDART NEWS: "My lads (the 
'skinheads' -- editorial note) say that it is quite easy to 
enroll as a volunteer in Serbia." Gelemenov said that last year 
he wanted to leave for Bosnia, but a woman called Petya had 
become very dear to him, and this stopped him from going. The 
leader of the unregistered National Socialist Party claims that 
Bulgarian mercenaries received 2,500 German marks a month. He 
said he know of special offices in Serbia that recruited 
volunteers and sent them for training. The nationalist parties 
do not intend to found a special union of volunteers, but they 
will encourage them, Gelemenov said. 
  A source close to the Bulgarian "Blue Helmets" association 
declared that four or five former "Blue Helmets" from Cambodia 
are already on the territory of southern Yugoslavia. The source 
said they left on a trip abroad and, at the moment, are earning 
their livings as professional rangers. 
  The Defense Ministry refused to make any comment, because it 
regards the statement issued by the OPT and ROS as a piece of 
utter nonsense. 
  Nikolay Slatinski told STANDART NEWS: This is nonsense, and 
it repeats the incredible stupidity of those who applauded the 
bombing of the Serbian positions in Sarajevo. As chairman of 
the Parliamentary National Security Commission, he added, I am 
against the idea of sending volunteers to former Yugoslavia, 
although we are Slavs and Christians. 
  The people who signed this document should be reported to 
the 
prosecutor, Zhan Videnov, leader of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist 
Party], told STANDART NEWS. It is a technical omission that so 
far the PSSD [Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy] has not 
stated any official viewpoint on the fascist statements and 
activities of Father Gelemenov. Mr. Videnov considers that 
Bulgaria should reconfirm its stance of nonintervention in the 
Yugo-conflict. Yesterday the Socialist leader refused to have a 
meeting with the Russian Path party, which under the 
chairmanship of Sergey Baburin represents the ROS in the Russian 
Duma.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Kolev, deputy chairman of the </F>
Interdepartmental Council on Issues of the Military-Industrial 
Complex and Mobilization Readiness, by Ventsislav Todorov; place 
and date not given: "We Are Encountering Difficulties in 
Restoring Lost Positions"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Todorov] Recently the 
cabinet issued a decree on regulating control over foreign trade 
activity with military and specialized production. Does it mean 
that prior to this state control was not efficient? 
  [Kolev] No, after 10 November 1989 Bulgaria firmly declared 
that it would observe the international norms related to the 
export of arms. Then we issued a document that regulated the 
manner and means of trading in arms. We worked on the basis of 
that document until the decree was adopted. The decree is 
stricter toward the exporters in anything related to the 
information that they must provide. I would like to stress that 
the Interdepartmental Council firmly, steadily, and 
uncompromisingly controls arms exports. In many cases we refuse 
the exports because we are concerned that Bulgaria should not be 
drawn by any means into international scandals regarding the 
arms trade. 
  [Todorov] It has been claimed that in recent years we have 
lost 80 percent of our arms markets -- is this the real picture 
and what could be changed? 
  [Kolev] This figure is probably related to the collapse of 
the agreements with the former Warsaw Pact countries. Our 
exports were predominantly directed toward those countries. In 
comparison with the top year -- 1988 -- our exports have 
decreased eight times. I do not want to cite precise figures. 
However, at the same time I very much hope that in 1994 
Bulgaria will export twice as much as in 1993. While we are 
encountering difficulties in regaining our positions, we are 
nevertheless slowly and painfully regaining them in our 
traditional markets. Our arms and goods are of high quality and 
they are being sought. However, I must point out that arms 
markets throughout the world have shrunk. We can hardly compete 
with such giants as Russia, the United States, China, or even 
Switzerland and Sweden. However, we have our place and are 
doing everything possible to regain our positions. The main 
thing is how to come up with new systems and new items. It is 
high time that those who are concerned about Bulgaria began 
speaking about investment, innovation, creating new production, 
and purchasing licenses, and not rally slogans and cliches. In 
1945 Japan was restored from ashes because it purchased licenses 
on a massive scale. [passage omitted] 
  [Todorov] Recently at the National Assembly Economic 
Commission Andrey Lukanov, National Assembly member, said that 
our middleman companies have taken advantage of Bulgarian 
obligations to the former CEMA. The Teraton Company and the sum 
of 230 million leva were mentioned. Do you consider such deals 
normal and do they help our military-industrial complex? 
  [Kolev] I sincerely regret that I cannot answer this 
question in a profound manner, because it has not been reviewed 
by the Interdepartmental Council, and I do not have the 
necessary documents. I am vaguely aware of the problem from 
what I read in the press, and thus I cannot commit myself to a 
professional answer. I could say one thing -- the trade 
companies must work in a manner that will bring revenue to the 
state. 
  [Todorov] There are four state companies, which have been 
allowed to conduct arms business -- Kintex, Armymex, Teraton, 
and Element Engineering. Have additional companies, including 
private ones, shown any interest? 
  [Kolev] Now a barrier rightly exists -- the arms trade must 
be implemented only by state trade companies. Probably the 
moment will come when, under certain conditions and criteria, 
private businessmen will be allowed to trade with such 
production, if they can prove to the state that they have the 
possibilities of doing this. The arms trade is a complicated 
process. It is not regular trade. It require specialized 
knowledge and training. The people who work in these 
organizations must have experience. There is a risk involved in 
allowing private companies to trade in arms without having any 
guarantees that we would not be drawn into a new international 
scandal. [passage omitted] 
  [Todorov] Are you optimistic over the possibility of the 
Bulgarian military industry restoring the stability and market 
scope of 1988? 
  [Kolev] I am a realist. It will be incredibly difficult, 
but restoring those dimensions and even expanding them can 
become possible only when we change the range of our 
merchandise. Arms production as a generalized concept is an 
agent of technical progress. Its top achievements were 
incorporated in space vehicles. Inventors in the United States 
and Russia were slow and rather jealous in conveying their 
achievements to civilian production. Even now the top 
technologies in the United States, Russia, France, and the world 
technical and technological centers are utilized first of all by 
the military industrial complexes. Therefore, we must be 
realists in assessing our possibilities and place. 
  [Todorov] Thank you for this interview.

<F P=106> [Report by Veselka Damyanova and Lidiya Lecheva] </F>
  [Excerpts] A check by specialists from the Kozloduy 
Nuclear Power Plant in the public health protection zone around 
the nuclear plant established that milk produced at the dairy 
farm of the labor collective farm (now in liquidation) in the 
town of Oryakhovo was radioactive. The milk was found to 
contain radioactive cesium-137, and the degree of radioactive 
contamination was found to be 30 becquerels per liter. The 
results of measurements taken on two successive days -- 23 and 
24 March -- were the same. On 30 March, the instruments 
established the presence of cesium in the milk with a 
radioactivity of 60 becquerels per liter. The source of the 
contamination proved to be silage pit that had been sealed off 
some time ago. A lack of food for the animals obliged the dairy 
farm workers to resort to the feed buried in the pit. On 1 
April, measurements taken showed that the fodder had a 
radioactivity of 800 becquerels per kilogram. [passage omitted] 
  On 4 April 1994, a commission comprised of representatives 
from the Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, the Kozloduy 
Nuclear Power Plant, and other authorities with an interest in 
the problem decided on measures to render the area safe. 
  The specialists assert that no one has consumed the 
contaminated milk and that it did not enter the commercial 
market. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Edmond Laci report: "Beatings Accompany the New Greek </F>
`Cleanup'"] 
  [Text] Kapshtice -- Albanian refugees forcibly repatriated 
by the Greek authorities are making chilling allegations. Only 
one week after the harsh statement by the Albanian Foreign 
Ministry condemning the murder of a young Albanian by Greek 
border guards, many Albanian refugees expelled in the last few 
days tell of inhuman crimes committed against them. After an 
interruption in the mistreatment and mass expulsions of 
Albanians, the Greek authorities embarked on a new "cleanup" 
campaign on 29 March. Most of the 1,600 Albanians returned on 
that day -- at a time when the average number of returnees 
amounts to 200 refugees per day -- have testified to the 
Albanian border authorities that they were tortured and even 
obscenely baited. The statement by the Human Rights Union 
deputy in the Albanian parliament on 30 March, protesting 
against the police who, according to him, prevented the [Greek] 
minority from celebrating 25 March, the anniversary of the Greek 
Revolution of 1821, has compounded the most recent 
Greek-Albanian incident. 
  About 1,000 refugees returned at the Kapshtice border 
crossing immediately on reaching Albanian soil spoke of 
previously unheard-of crimes. This contingent had fallen prey 
to the special police of Kostouri, in whose cells more than 30 
refugees were kept for four or five days without food of any 
kind. The most chilling tales include cases of the rape of 
Albanian girls by Greek soldiers, even before the eyes of other 
men who were in detention alongside them. Meanwhile, other 
victims of this terror confirmed at the border other cases of 
extreme torture such as the use of electric shocks on their 
bodies. The contingent returned on 29 March also confirmed to 
the Albanian authorities that they had left dozens of other 
mistreated Albanians at Kostouri, one of them in serious 
condition. The baiting of the Greek soldiers with the words, 
"Whose is Macedonia?" often involved beatings with rubber 
truncheons. Drachmas and food were also confiscated, and 
passports with valid visas for their bearers were also torn up. 
  This raises once again tensions between Albania and Greece 
at 
the very time when matters appeared to be reverting to normal. 
Greece's turn as EU chairman and the recent visit of high-level 
Greek Foreign Ministry officials to Tirana had given new 
positive signals not only for interstate relations but also for 
the delicate problem of Albanian emigrants and the regulation of 
their status in Greece.

<F P=106> [Interview with Socialist Party Deputy Chairman Namik Dokle </F>
by Erion Brace; place and date not given: "Fatos Nano's Sentence 
Symbolizes the Violations of Human Rights, Press Freedom, and 
the Independence of the Judiciary"] 
  [Text] [Dokle] The Socialist Party [PS] expected such a 
sentence, and it does not matter whether it is of 12, 14, 11, or 
seven years, because it is a political decision issued by what 
Dritero Agolli has rightly called the supreme staff of state 
policy, and is without legal grounds. It is a verdict that 
conflicts with Albanian public opinion, with the opinion of the 
European Parliament and of the Interparliamentary Union, and the 
motion for a resolution proposed by deputies of the 
Parliamentary Assembly. It is thus a verdict issued by the 
Democratic Party [PD] in a tight fix, in an attempt to recoup 
what it has gradually been losing since 22 March [1992 
elections]. This is a disaster not only for the PD, but for all 
Albania and for the solution of Albania's problems, which cannot 
be settled by political trials but only by wise government for 
the people, genuine democracy, tolerance, and cooperation and 
understanding among the political forces. The PD normally makes 
comparisons with the past when such things are mentioned. 
  Indeed, when one compares society today with totalitarian 
society, one cannot fail to notice many improvements, but one 
cannot make such comparisons. Comparisons should be made with 
the kind of society we want to create, with the principles of 
democracy, and the experience of European democracies today. In 
this sense, there are extraordinary violations of human rights, 
press freedom, and the independence of the judiciary. Fatos 
Nano's sentence precisely symbolizes these violations. 
  To sentence Fatos Nano means to sentence the free press; to 
sentence Fatos Nano means to sentence political pluralism; to 
sentence Fatos Nano means to sentence democracy; sentencing 
Fatos Nano means that the unemployed will remain out of work for 
a longer time. People on welfare will remain on welfare, and 
will then lose it. What do I mean here? I mean that the PD and 
its government, instead of tackling the extraordinary economic 
problems, are politicizing the economy and, being unable to 
solve its problems, are involving themselves in trials such as 
that of Fatos Nano. 
  Of course, the length of the sentence is quite unimportant 
to 
the PS. What is important for us is how long the 900 days until 
the new elections that Mr. Berisha has announced will last. We 
think that Albania must hold early elections as soon as possible 
in order to realize the aspirations of those students who first 
shouted, "Let us lead Albania to Europe" and "Let us lead 
Albania to democracy." When Albania sets out on this path, it 
will not have political prisoners such as Fatos Nano or any 
other politician. 
  [Brace] What political action will you take? 
  [Dokle] Of course, we do not work in spurts, but have 
concentrated political activities in every field. As I said 
before, the sentencing of Fatos Nano means the sentencing of the 
democratic path in Albania, the violation of human rights, and 
the violation of the independence of the judiciary. Our future 
work will therefore consist of a struggle for the respect of 
human rights and basic freedom, because Aleksander Frangaj and 
Martin Leka have been sentenced alongside Fatos Nano, and also a 
struggle to restore the lost independence of the organs of the 
judiciary. It is not simply the problem of one Fatos Nano, but 
that Fatos Nano symbolizes something. He symbolizes the scope 
for democracy in Albania, and the PS's struggle to defend Fatos 
Nano symbolizes this party's struggle in the defense of fragile 
Albanian democracy. 
  [Brace] Since you spoke about symbols, you mentioned that 
Shefqet Beja was the first deputy to oppose the totalitarian 
methods of the old regime, and that Fatos Nano was the first 
deputy to oppose the totalitarian methods of Berisha's regime. 
Shefqet Beja and Fatos Nano are brothers in a single democracy. 
How would you comment further? 
  [Dokle] It is true that this trial, which lasted one month 
and produced its verdict today, reminds you precisely of the 
conviction of the earlier deputy in the years immediately after 
World War II, because he was the first deputy to oppose the 
totalitarian tendencies of the new Albanian state. Fatos Nano 
was the first Albanian deputy to oppose the totalitarian 
tendencies of Berisha's regime. These tendencies were 
highlighted in the resolution of the European Parliament, which 
explicitly states: "While the totalitarianism of the past 
regime has been dealt a heavy blow, there is a temptation toward 
authoritarianism that seriously imperils pluralism and the 
development of democratic processes in Albania." This trial 
resembled those of the past, and to my mind only the portrait on 
the wall was missing, because in other respects this trial was 
the spitting image of those that went before. What were the 
similarities? For example, Mr. Bendo was the legal master of 
ceremonies, and his entire verdict was rescued by the testimony 
of Adil Carcani. He purposely forgot that Adil Carcani was the 
man who, when the students asked him to remove the name of Enver 
Hoxha from the university, steadfastly refused, and was 
apparently obliged to sign the instruction by an order. Agim 
Bendo takes this man as a witness, a man who amazingly seems to 
have known nothing about the aid coming to Albania at that time. 
However, the problem lies deeper, and is not simply that of an 
individual. In Albania, the 1976 Constitution has been 
abrogated, but, in the absence of a new constitution, the Civil 
Code, Penal Code, and Penal Procedure Code all stem from the 
Stalinist 1976 Constitution, and everything that takes place is 
conducted in a totalitarian way. This is the greatest evil, 
because political instructions and orders from above take 
priority, rather than legal evidence, the evidence of a witness, 
and the confrontation or arguments. 
  [Brace] Since you mentioned orders from above, do you think 
that Berish kept his promise of an open and transparent trial, 
with an independent verdict? 
  [Dokle] This promise, i.e. that Fatos Nano's trial would be 
open and transparent, was broken when there was a telephone call 
to Mr. Berisha about a delicate matter connected with the Nano 
trial, and when the lawyer Sanxhaku, who was to travel to Paris, 
was held by the police under an order from above. 
  I think that the trial was open but not transparent. It was 
open because it was held in open court, but this trial lacked 
transparency. It suffices to mention the fact that, in Fatos 
Nano's defense session, the prosecutor's case was broadcast is 
full, and Judge Bendo's verdict was also filmed in full today, 
while not even 1 percent of Fatos Nano's defense was carried by 
the radio and television, even when one knows that Fatos Nano 
remained a deputy enjoying full rights until the day of the 
verdict. However, the organs of justice and finally the court 
systematically denied him this right and others that the law 
guarantees.

  [Text] Brussels, April 11 (AFP) -- A U.S. jet fighter 
apparently destroyed three tanks Monday [11 April] during the 
second NATO attack in less than 24 hours on Serb positions 
around the mainly Moslem town of Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
NATO said here. Manfred Woerner, secretary-general of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organisation, said a single U.S. FA-18A jet 
fighter carried out the strike. 
  "We have only first pilot reports, which say that three 
tanks 
seem to have been destroyed but that is not confirmed," he said 
in a statement. The attack occurred at 1224 GMT. 
  On Sunday [10 April] two U.S. F-16 aircraft dropped five 
bombs on a Serb artillery position outside Gorazde, a Moslem 
enclave being besieged by Serb forces which is under United 
Nations protection as an officially-designated safe area. 
  The operation was officially launched in support of UN 
personnel at Goradze. Bosnian Serbs fired more shells on the 
town on Monday, reportedly injuring 200 people at a refugee 
centre. Woerner said: "Serbs had resumed shelling from the 
south and UN personnel trapped in the area were in some danger." 
  On Sunday, after the first strike, U.S. President Bill 
Clinton warned that U.S. warplanes would strike again in Bosnia 
if UN authorities asked for military support. Sunday's attack 
was the first by NATO warplanes on Serb ground positions since 
the civil war in Bosnia began two years ago.

  [Text] Brussels, April 11 (AFP) -- NATO Secretary General 
Manfred Woerner said Monday [11 April] that effective air 
strikes in Bosnia would be impossible if Russia was to be 
consulted first as it had demanded. "If we have to set up a 
process of consultation which would last hours and hours, it 
would never happen," Woerner was quoted as saying by a NATO 
official. 
  He also warned Serbs against revenge attacks against UN 
Protection Forces, saying NATO would not hesitate to launch more 
air strikes if requested. 
  Russia reacted angrily to air strikes Sunday [10 April] and 
Monday on Serb positions around the besieged Moslem enclave of 
Gorazde by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). After 
Monday's air strikes, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
insisted that Russia should be consulted before all NATO raids. 
  "It is very dangerous and a big mistake to make such 
decisions without prior consultation with Russia," Kozyrev said 
during an official visit to Madrid. 
  But Woerner, speaking at Aachen in Germany, said it would 
not 
be possible to protect UN troops -- who called for NATO's air 
strikes Sunday and Monday -- if there were hours-long delays. 
  "Close air support has to be rapid. You have troops under 
fire. You want to protect them. You have to hit very rapidly," 
Woerner was quoted as telling reporters. 
  He also said he hoped attacks on UN troops and Gorazde, in 
eastern Bosnia, would stop after Monday's air strikes. But he 
added: "We did what we said and we will not hesitate to repeat 
close air support air strikes as long as requested."

  [Text] New York, April 12 (TANJUG) -- No one at the United 
Nations headquarters could confirm or deny on Tuesday reports 
that a NATO aircraft bringing special troops and war equipment 
had landed at Tuzla airport in eastern Bosnia. 
  The report surprised even U.N. peace missions spokesman Fred 
Eckhard. He told TANJUG that he did not know anything about it, 
but that it was possible that the report was correct and that 
the troops and equipment involved could be those intended for 
securing the airport. 
  The Bosnian Serb army general staff accused NATO on Monday 
of 
having used its aircraft for a synchronized action with Bosnian 
Moslem infantry against Serb positions at Gorazde and of having 
brought its rapid deployment force units to Tuzla airport. 
  The Bosnian Serb army general staff also said a NATO C-130 
transport aircraft landed at Tuzla's Dubrava airport at 16:50 
hrs local time on Monday, bringing members of the NATO Rapid 
Deployment Force and a considerable quantity of ammunition, 
weapons and military equipment for a coordinated action with 
Bosnian Moslem units against Bosnian Serb units. 
  The synchronized attack in the Gorazde area and the use of 
the Tuzla airport for military purposes (the airport has not 
been reopened for relief aid deliveries yet) indicates that the 
U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has overstepped its mandate and 
that it will be fully responsible if the conflicts in former 
Bosnia- Herzegovina escalate, the general staff said. 
  Bosnian Serbs have opposed the reopening of Tuzla airport, 
justly fearing that it might be used as a conduit for supplying 
Moslem units with military equipment. They have demanded that 
Serb observers and Russian peacekeepers be deployed at the 
airport.

<F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Surjan, chairman of the Christian </F>
Democratic People's Party, by Moricz; place and date not given: 
"Calm Is in the Public Interest"] 
  [Text] Despite their public fighting, the parties have 
been making statements in the spirit of a foreign political 
consensus, even if some parties thought this consensus was 
lacking, Laszlo Surjan told us. 
  [Moricz] After his visit in Budapest, the Russian prime 
minister received the Hungarian journalist in Moscow and spoke 
with great appreciation of his talks with the Hungarian 
Government. How did you receive this evaluation at home? 
  [Surjan] On behalf of both the government and myself, I can 
say that the visit of the Russian premier in Hungary was 
extremely important indeed. We highly appreciate the firm 
Russian readiness to settle the outstanding Russian debt to 
Hungary. Hungarian participation in the Russian privatization 
process opens up possibilities for both settling the debt issue 
and vitally broadening our foreign trade that dropped 
considerably after the collapse of the Soviet market. 
  [Moricz] What effect could the domestic political echoes of 
this visit have on the ratification of the basic agreement? 
  [Surjan] This cannot affect the ratification of the basic 
treaty. At the same time, caution and consideration are needed 
in the course of election speeches, and I also include myself in 
this requirement, because emotional elements can greatly affect 
the public mood and the relations between individual parties. 
  [Moricz] In your opinion, how will Hungary fare in the 
period until the May 8 elections? 
  [Surjan] It is a positive development that, according to 
opinion polls, the percentage of people willing to participate 
in the elections is increasing. I am convinced that a bad 
decision will not emerge if a sufficient number of people go to 
vote. In the current difficult economic situation, it is in the 
public interest to enable the new government to lead the country 
in calm and stable circumstances.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross </F>
by correspondent Pal Lakatos on the "Sunday Newspaper" program 
-- live] 
  [Excerpts] I welcome our studio guest, Prime Minister Peter 
Boross. Pal Lakatos, duty editor of "Sunday Newspaper," will be 
putting both the listeners' and his own questions to the prime 
minister. 
  [Lakatos] [passage omitted] The collection of nomination 
slips for next month's elections closed on 8 April. According 
to the statistical data, the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] 
can put up candidates in 166 places, the Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ] in 172, the Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP] in 
176, and the Workers' Party in 146. [passage omitted] On the 
basis of the figures, should one not, or do you not, fear the 
possibility of a shift to the left? [passage omitted] 
  [Boross] On the basis of the figures I do not fear this. 
Otherwise, a tendency towards a shift to the left is something 
that everyone can sense. As for its proportion, that is 
something that only the elections will decide, and I hope that 
it will not be of a greater proportion than desired. These 
figures by themselves do not say anything. The nomination slip 
collections in more than one case were a show put on by campaign 
groups that tend to do this, rather than an expression of the 
personal qualities of the candidates. [passage omitted] 
  [Lakatos] It is interesting to note that during the past few 
days on the part of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] there 
have been more and more appeals to the Christian Democratic 
People's Party [KDNP]. It is generally known that you too would 
join a coalition with the KDNP if the chance presented itself. 
What is your opinion on this? 
  [Boross] My opinion about this is that our cooperation with 
the KDNP is a natural one deriving from shared political 
orientations on the basis of shared principles and ideas. 
Whereas other parties -- the abovementioned one as well, I 
think -- would have to struggle with this difference in concept 
which separates them from the Christian Democrats. My 
impression is that the KDNP will not fall for various siren 
voices which are speaking in its direction, because it is aware 
that from the point of view of the party's future, it is 
extremely risky to conclude a political alliance contrary to the 
demands of the membership and the masses that support it. 
  [Lakatos] Pardon the expression, but this is what people 
say, 
this is how they put it: Prime Minister Peter Boross is engaged 
in undermining work [aknamunkat vegez] to divide the party of 
the SZDSZ. At the same time they also say that he would like to 
lure the Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats] to the MDF. 
  [Boross] It is no accident that they use this word -- 
undermining. It is true that it takes place under ground and in 
secret and not in full view or within earshot of others. 
[passage omitted] My conviction is that in the SZDSZ there are 
two parties and two trends. I must add that the SZDSZ is the 
one that did not in any way split in the course of the trials of 
the previous four years. On the whole this sort of thing did 
happen to the parties, and in certain cases it ended sadly, as 
in the case of the smallholders. In others it could even be 
called a purification process. This split did not happen with 
the Free Democrats. However, this dual trend is perceivable in 
the SZDSZ. 
  Now, in the case of Fidesz there is nothing: Our stance has 
not changed in any way. It is simply that Fidesz's national 
conference or congress, or I don't know know what they call it 
exactly, in Debrecen, proclaimed a national liberal profile. 
And naturally this aroused the attention of a 
national-orientated party, such as the MDF. But if this looks 
like some kind of allurement, then I have to say that this is 
not a well-meaning interpretation. We are looking for the 
motifs in every party that could become the basis for future 
cooperation in the country's interest. Accepting the national 
trend is one very serious element of this, and it can be found 
without doubt in the case of Fidesz. However, this means 
nothing with regard to the future. At present we are rival 
parties in this election struggle and each represents his own 
principles and programs, which, in more than one case, clash. 
  [Lakatos] Let us leave party politics proper for a moment 
and let us remember the date, today's date to be precise, 10 
April 1994, when throughout the world people remember the 
600,000 Hungarian Jews who perished in the Holocaust. Is this 
an occasion for the world to bow its head? 
  [Boross] It is an occasion for the world to bow its head; it 
is an occasion for every right-thinking person to bow his or her 
head; it is particularly an occasion for every right-thinking 
Hungarian to bow his or her head. On 19 March 1944 the country 
was caught up by the tragedy, the tragedy of the Nazi 
occupation. And what happened after that is the darkest point 
in Hungarian history, when old people, women, children 
indiscriminately were transported to their deaths. And these 
kinds of trains set off from this country. I think that the 
memory of this terror must shake everybody. [passage omitted] 
  [Lakatos] Our late prime minister, Jozsef Antall, whose 
birthday, 62d birthday, would have been on 8 April, declared 
himself to be the prime minister -- in spirit -- of 15 million 
Hungarians. A listener from Nove Zamky [in Slovakia] asks: Do 
you think in exactly the same way? 
  [Boross] I have already spoken about this; yes, I do think 
in 
exactly the same way. And on this occasion as well I would 
stress with great emphasis the oft-misquoted phrase of Jozsef 
Antall's -- in spirit -- lest it arouse excitement among those 
who would infer from this some kind of intention to change the 
borders, let alone to change the borders by force. Throughout 
the world there are 15 million Hungarians: four million here [in 
the neighboring countries], beyond the borders, and one million 
in the wide world who call themselves Hungarian. This has been 
their fate in the 20th century. And a Hungarian prime minister 
at all events must pay heed to these 15 million as well; and I 
think he has every moral basis for feeling himself to be the 
representative -- in spirit -- of 15 million Hungarians. 
  [Lakatos] Istvan Gangesz from Budapest, telephone number 
1320- 428, asks in connection with this: If you consider 
yourself the prime minister -- in spirit -- of 15 million 
Hungarians, then why did you permit 10,000 foreigners to 
privatize Hungarian industry? 
  [Boross] I don't know who counted these 10,000, or where 
this 
figure comes from; I have no personal knowledge of this. I will 
give a very much simplified answer: In 1938 about 30 percent of 
Hungarian industry was in foreign ownership; at present this 
figure is around 10 percent, but it is not even as much as that. 
[passage omitted] A significant part of what has passed into 
foreign ownership in our country represents developed, modern, 
up-to-date technology; it means production in our country, wages 
paid in our country, and in every way it is a blessing to the 
country. [passage omitted] In any case, if this foreign capital 
were not to appear in Hungary, then the oft-repeated 
modernization, the problems caused by the oft-repeated shortage 
of capital, would never be resolved. I can reassure everybody: 
We take great care that this foreign investment should not go 
beyond the limits beyond which a country's self-determination, 
or its sovereignty, might become doubtful. Those who know us 
will know that we take extraordinary care about this and this is 
a real priority with us. 
  [Lakatos] Prime Minister, are you not afraid, after these 
remarks, that the accusation of the recent past will be revived, 
namely that you are conducting success propaganda? 
  [Boross] [passage omitted] These four years have been full 
of 
a lot of bitterness and a lot of counter-propaganda. There have 
been results, and the Hungarian economy -- but not just the 
economy, other sectors as well -- has started on an irreversible 
road. I know that this is not yet making itself felt directly 
in the households, but it carries within it the promise of the 
future. 
  [Lakatos] Allow me to quote the words of Gyula Horn, HSP 
[Hungarian Socialist Party] chairman. Gyula Horn's message to 
the voters a few days ago was: Dismiss this MDF-led government 
which gives the people, the nation, as its authority, but which 
in the meantime, dispossesses [kisemmiz] the majority. 
  [Boross] Well, one could quote numerous other things from 
Gyula Horn's ex-cathedra sentences. [passage omitted] This far I 
can understand it, because Gyula Horn wishes to have a socialist 
government; after all this is the essence of the election 
struggle now. Only, this socialist government has already 
existed once; at least, in the two years prior to 1990 it called 
itself a socialist reform government. Anyone who has a good 
memory will remember what it achieved with this reform. My 
conviction is that it would be very bad for the country if it 
listened to Gyula Horn. [passage omitted] 
  [Lakatos] Agnes Csongradi from Budapest, or possibly not 
Budapest -- the telephone number is 133-203 -- remarks or asks: 
Will you be leaving the velvet seat with a clear conscience 
after having sold off the country? And she hopes that the new 
government will be much better than the present one. 
  [Lakatos] [passage omitted] Will you be leaving the velvet 
seat with a clear conscience? We don't want to, and I 
personally do not want to leave this velvet seat, I who have 
held the post of prime minister for six months, not even for six 
months. But let me put it [the velvet chair] into quotation 
marks. This much-vaunted velvet seat is full of quite 
unpleasant fakir's nails. [passage omitted] 
  [Lakatos] [passage omitted] If we have a look at the 
popularity ratings and if I remember well, you received a rating 
of around 20 percent, while the MDF received around 10 percent. 
These two data suggest that you may be the most popular 
candidate for prime minister, but if your party does not win the 
elections, then you are not going to be a prime minister. 
  [Boross] The listeners should know that I can only be the 
prime minister of the country if they cast their vote for the 
MDF. [passage omitted] I aspire to be the prime minister of the 
country for four years so that I can put my ideas into practice 
in the country's economy and other fields. 
  [Lakatos] Several opposition politicians say if they enter 
government they will complete the compensation process; however, 
they cannot give any compensation for the past four years. 
  [Boross] Well, this is the usual irony. [passage omitted] 
But 
as far as compensation is concerned, I think that there can be 
many types of privatization, but privatization as a means of 
compensation has its own moral underpinning. 
  [Lakatos] It would be worth talking about what the country 
was like in 1990 when this coalition entered government and what 
it is like today. Just a few important facts need to be 
mentioned. 
  [Boross] [passage omitted] This country was on the brink of 
insolvency. It has already been said several times that the 
foreign currency reserves today are nearly 10 times what the 
previous government had at its disposal. 
  [Lakatos] Then it was 800 million dollars and now it is 
nearly 7 billion dollars. 
  [Boross] Yes, around 7 billion, but this number is moving. 
[passage omitted] I refute allegations that the country is in a 
worse condition now -- especially now, when there is no writer 
on economic topics or economist who would deny that industrial 
production grew by 10 percent at the beginning of this year. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Lakatos] However, many say that to implement the tasks more 
quickly, debt rescheduling would be necessary. [passage omitted] 
  [Boross] [passage omitted] We have already transformed the 
country's short-term debts into medium and long-term debts to 
make these years easier. It was only possible because we give 
the impression of being a stable country with our financial 
reserves and internal relations. [passage omitted] If somebody 
has reserves like Hungary has and submits a request for 
rescheduling over an even longer period, then on the one hand it 
will be turned down, and on the other hand it will give a very 
bad impression on the international market, where every tiny 
movement is closely monitored. They would arrive at the 
conclusion that the country is insolvent. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with MTI Director General Karoly Alexa by Miklos </F>
Vegh; place and date not given: "Party-Neutral National 
Institution"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Vegh] Few people would 
question the validity of the proposition that information is 
power. It is by no means an accident that the print and 
electronic media are constantly in the crossfire of party 
politics. Meanwhile the MTI [Hungarian News Agency] has remained 
unhurt. 
  [Alexa] It would be far-fetched to draw a direct parallel 
between the missions of newspapers, radio, and television on the 
one hand and the MTI on the other. Their functions in the 
transmission of news are quite different. We, for instance, have 
no direct contact with our readers. Here, in the case of news, 
the decisions are practically forced ones. We are not the only 
news service in the market, and it would not be in our best 
business interest to let the truth content of our information be 
compromised and our credibility damaged. Our more likely dilemma 
is whether the necessarily variegated minor or major news 
stories flowing in to us cover the whole truth; whether the 
fragmentary events that thrust themselves into the forefront of 
attention obscure our view of the national, regional or local 
processes. But I wish to emphasize that we merely supply 
information to those who use them "in sharp focus," one way or 
another. 
  Far be it from me to claim that the people working here do 
not and cannot form personal opinions. But specifically these 
conflict-ridden days are the time when my directive became 
effective, the one that spells out what occasions, affairs, and 
forms in connection with the election campaign are incompatible 
with the duties of our employees. We cannot afford to let any 
political party accuse us of bias or prejudice. This directive 
is in accord with the Public Employees Law, yet it also has 
generated some resentment within our walls, because it clashes 
with personal interest. But I refuse to make any concessions on 
this issue... In the spirit of this same party-neutral attitude, 
we held a conference with the political parties about what the 
MTI will do as its duty, what we will offer to do voluntarily, 
and what we will not do under any circumstances, regardless of 
whatever pressure. This conference has been successful and "no 
complaints will be accepted" after this agreement. We will 
safeguard and strengthen the independence of this institution; 
in the interest of objective and trustworthy reporting, we will 
not yield to any blackmail. 
  [Vegh] Our interview is turning inevitably toward the coming 
elections, in which the governing coalition that orchestrated 
the change of political systems will draw up a balance sheet of 
its performance. Our approaching national holiday on 15 March, 
which is also Hungarian Press Day, might become yet another 
casualty of the partisan skirmishes that are already plagued by 
moral and political boorishness and falsehoods. 
  [Alexa] I must admit to having received numerous invitations 
from many places to speak that day, but I have turned them down. 
I do not find any such direct analogy with the change of our 
fortune in 1848 as I did in March 1989. To be more exact, I feel 
that the most appropriate way of celebrating the anniversary 
these days would be with diligent work rather than with pompous 
speeches. There certainly is less need for personal sacrifices. 
After all, awareness of our numerous losses is also decisive 
when preparing the balance sheet of the past four years. Here I 
am referring primarily to the death of Prime Minister Jozsef 
Antall. It is symbolically intertwined also with my own fortune, 
because I seem to be his last appointment to high state office. 
Indeed, when I received my nomination, the inkspots next to his 
signature seemed to suggest that this had been practically the 
last pen stroke he ever made. I was already in this chair when I 
learned of his death. I found it extremely disturbing that this 
historical loss suddenly became an item of daily news that had 
to be processed. 
  At the same time I am observing with hope how the country's 
fortunes are developing, and I sincerely want to see the country 
preserve and strengthen its ability to function. Let more and 
more people realize that what is happening in Hungary is their 
common undertaking; and let no one labor under the delusion that 
the various functionaries rallying around different banners are 
about to attack him. Let everyone bear in mind that here we are 
now jointly writing the history that will become our children's 
and grandchildren's history lesson that will lend itself to 
accurate assessment. If we wish to avoid disappointment for 
ourselves and posterity, we must do our work with less bluster 
and in closer mutual understanding. In this respect it gladdens 
me to see that the governing coalition is standing behind Peter 
Boross with fewer convulsions, less anxiety, and more 
self-assurance than previously. Practically every party has been 
disturbed by the extremists in its own ranks, to such an extent 
that even the opposition has been forced to purge its own 
ranks--the moderates are the ones now in control. 
  Regarding the Hungarian media in conjunction with all this, 
I 
am obliged to establish that they are being exposed to ever 
greater political pressure. All sorts of groups are striving to 
win the media over, to annex them, to convert them into their 
own organs. Day by day, this is threatening freedom of the press 
in that stage of its evolution where journalists do not yet 
realize what freedom of the press actually means. It does not 
mean their ability to say anything in the same organ, rather 
their ability to say the same thing anywhere they find a forum. 
That is also the lesson of the "revolts" about the 
public-service media.

<F P=106> [Article by Attila Herpai: "Gyorgy Szabad has the Csucs </F>
Case"] 
  [Text] The chairman of the Assembly's Committee on Culture 
appealed to the president of the National Assembly to resolve 
the problem presented by radio Vice President Laszlo Csucs when 
he failed to answer the Committee's questions by the established 
deadline. 
  Attila Zsigmond announced at the meeting of the Cultural 
Committee that as of the day before the Committee had received 
no response to eight questionsfor Laszlo Csucs, which he was 
supposed to answer by then. The MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] 
chairman declared that he had learned from the press that Laszlo 
Csucs requested an extension of the deadline for responding. 
  Some of the questions asked by the Committee pertained to 
the 
issue of whether the views of the public employee council of the 
radio had been sought regarding the dismissals, whether the 
employer had proved a causal relationship supporting the 
dismissals, whether the employer had provided an opportunity for 
the dismissed persons to clarify the charges brought against 
them, and whether severance pay had been consistent with the 
violation of professional and ethical conduct criteria. The 
Culture Committee took the position that the law provided that a 
public employee may be dismissed only if no other work 
commensurate with his education could be found, or if the 
employee rejected the transfer. Based on this position, the 
Committee asked the vice president of the radio whether such an 
offer had been made. The Committee also expected to learn 
whether the dismissals constituted layoffs or firings on a 
disciplinary basis, and about the legal basis of the vice 
president's order, according to which the persons to be 
dismissed were to be prohibited from performing work without 
providing any reason for such prohibition. Based on responses to 
these questions, the Committee wanted to decide whether it would 
hear the statements by the radio's vice president. 
  Tamas Fodor, representative of the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free 
Democrats], recommended that the Committee ask National Assembly 
President Gyorgy Szabad what to do if a person fails to respond 
by a deadline set by the Committee. Attila Zsigmond expressed 
the view that this matter was clearly settled by both the 
Constitution and the house rules. 
  In response to our inquiry, SZDSZ media politician Miklos 
Haraszti expressed his view that Laszlo Csucs's request for a 
delay amounted to no more than the fact that the vice president 
of the radio had frustrated the not-too-strong intent of a 
majority of the Cultural Committee to hear Csucs during this 
session of parliament.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by </F>
Robert Kotian; place and date not given: "We Do Not Want To 
Limit Ourselves to Six Months"] 
  [Text] [Kotian] Journalist Marian Lesko commented on the 
previous government with the maxim that it could not govern the 
way it wanted and did not want to govern the way it could. How 
does your government want to govern, and how will it be able to 
govern in the six months allotted to it? 
  [Moravcik] Although the factor of the six-month term 
significantly affects our operation and decisionmaking, we do 
not want to limit our program to this term--i.e., we are 
designing the program so that it is based on a long-term concept 
and development trends we want to outline and, in the coming six 
months, do something for their implementation. That is the 
general approach. From this point of view, we do not want to 
limit our ideas in designing the government policy to the 
six-month term. 
  [Kotian] Could you be more specific regarding the most 
important long-term trends? 
  [Moravcik] The economy is our number-one priority, although 
development trends must also be launched in the social sphere. 
In the economy, it is the fast transformation, which in turn 
requires accelerated privatization. Privatization must be 
executed so that it is a part of the economic concept--i.e., 
that it create conditions for the solution of economic problems. 
  [Kotian] A lot has been heard recently about legal and 
ethical doubts, about hectic privatization measures of the 
previous government. How do you intend to deal with this 
problem? 
  [Moravcik] From the vantage point of privatization, in 
general, it is a minor problem. We do not want to lose much 
time on this. It must be settled as fast as possible. 
  [Kotian] Your political adversaries claim that the broad 
coalition is held together by fear of Meciar and the interest in 
privatization. How do you argue against claims that the 
interests of political entities are your main concern in 
privatization? 
  [Moravcik] That cannot be argued, but, by deeds--we must 
consistently implement the basic approach of achieving 
transparency in privatization--projects will be published so 
that everybody can learn who privatizes what--i.e., make 
privatization subject to public control. 
  [Kotian] What is the place of the second wave of 
privatization in your concept? 
  [Moravcik] We are just now contemplating its extent. 
However, if we wish it to have a meaning, its extent cannot be 
significantly smaller than in the first wave. We want to do 
everything in our power for it to be executed before or at least 
soon after the elections. 
  [Kotian] Milan Knazko told SME that your government will not 
be election-conscious but, rather, has to implement some very 
unpopular measures. How do you personally deal with the 
internal dilemma of not being election-conscious but, at the 
same time, not fail in the elections. You certainly want you or 
a similar government to continue in the aforementioned trends. 
  [Moravcik] Obviously, a balanced approach must be found. To 
act with just the elections in mind would be in direct 
contradiction to our political beliefs. It is necessary to work 
for the benefit of the country--if I can phrase it so--and I 
believe that we can convince the citizens of this country that 
some measures are necessary even if they are unpopular. From 
this point of view, I would not perceive election interests as 
an effort to be popular at any cost. After all, that would not 
even be convincing. 
  [Kotian] It may be convincing for a citizen, in the negative 
sense, if you adopt unpopular measures without a convincing 
justification or if you adopt solely unpopular measures. 
  [Moravcik] Of course, we have reckoned with that. There is 
a limit in the unpopular measures, beyond which we cannot go, 
not because of the elections but, rather, because we have to 
consider the social acceptability. We have to move within these 
limits. 
  [Kotian] Could you possibly indicate now some of the 
measures that could make life easier for, let us say, 
physicians, teachers, pensioners, businessmen...? 
  [Moravcik] It is difficult to talk about it now because we 
have to take another look at the budget first. Even if we take 
some measures concerning transport or pension indexation, or 
public catering in educational and health-care institutions, we 
would like the impact to differentiate between those who are at 
a certain level of social minimum and those who can afford it. 
In simple words, regardless of the position of the vantage 
point in the political spectrum, we cannot impoverish the 
country or move a large number of people below the sustenance 
minimum. 
  [Kotian] How do you want to convincingly address the trade 
unions, to whom the former prime minister laid it on with a 
trowel by the adopted General Agreement? 
  [Moravcik] We propose to change the General Agreement, in 
general, and some of its stipulations, in particular. The 
biggest problem is the arduous question of the social fund, and 
we must explain in actual figures whether the implementation of 
such a demand would bring the desired effect. We must reflect 
this problem onto its macroeconomic correlations and consider 
its feedback in the social sphere. 
  [Kotian] The IMF supplement to the Slovak Government 
Memorandum is a considerable problem. You decided to accept it, 
although it will translate into restrictive measures. Can you 
give us some details of this amendment as well as the measures 
to moderate its impact? 
  [Moravcik] So far, this supplement is not really topical 
because we are building on the assumption that, if we find 
another way of securing the objective, an agreement with the IMF 
can always be reached. 
  [Kotian] Do you know another way of securing the objective? 
  [Moravcik] For example, it is not acceptable to us that we 
implement the value-added tax according to this proposal. This 
means that we will have to distribute the cost of these measures 
to society in a differentiating fashion, according to the social 
strata. Hence, if the price of food were increased, we would 
have to take care of a pay raise for certain groups of 
population. Thus, the increase in the price of food would not 
be so drastic. 
  [Kotian] Do you have in mind some sort of compensatory 
allowance? 
  [Moravcik] It is rather a raising of pensions and income. 
This society must maintain a certain culture, and this includes 
security for people with lower incomes. 
  [Kotian] A new body emerged at the time of the coalition 
talks--the Coalition Council, which is to smooth the rough edges 
between the individual entities represented in the government. 
Does the Coalition Council limit your powers? 
  [Moravcik] So far, the Coalition Council has been helping. 
I am convinced that I will be able to repeat this at the end of 
my term of office. We discuss the principal problems at these 
talks. We come up with certain ideas that are examined here, and 
thereby we are assured that our decision is correct. 
  [Kotian] How do you see the prospects of such a coalition 
council, of such a cooperative form of government? 
  [Moravcik] I believe, that, in the positive sense of the 
word, we have been forced to such a form of government. We 
would like to continue in this fashion. We have to do our best 
to achieve favorable results in the next elections, to convince 
our citizens that this form of government brings them agreeable 
conditions for their work. 
  [Kotian] What holds together such entities as the Party of 
the Democratic Left and the Christian Democratic Movement so 
that they are capable of governing together? 
  [Moravcik] I believe the political responsibility for the 
fate of this country that they assumed, and I believe that, if 
they assumed this responsibility, they must not gamble, they 
must reach an agreement. The agreement will be a complex one, 
but the experience to date has not revealed any significant 
differences. 
  [Kotian] Does it mean that the difference between the left 
and the right wings is vanishing in Slovakia, or, the farther 
down or in the corner Slovakia is, the more unequivocal is the 
way out? 
  [Moravcik] However we look at it, one thing is clear: The 
time for pragmatic solutions is here. We are able to unite on 
that. This society must get out of its predicament and 
isolation--i.e., the society at any cost, and subsequently we 
can implement right- or left-wing policies. At this time, all 
entities united in a certain orientation, and it is important 
that they agreed on the acceleration of the transformation. 
  [Kotian] You referred to pragmatic solutions and the 
agreement between the left and the right wings. How do you 
perceive through the prism of your words a certain tension and 
strife in the center regarding the liberal or conservative 
orientation? 
  [Moravcik] I believe it of marginal importance. The logical 
disintegration of political forces and the formation of a 
rational political scene is taking place in Slovakia only now. 
It is a process that is marked also by numerous subjective 
factors, but I firmly believe that it will eventually lead to a 
rational distribution of political entities. From this point of 
view, I regret that we have not managed to form a single party 
with Cermakites, but, if they feel that their place is on the 
right, they are likely to approach the Christian Democratic 
Movement. We want to cooperate with the National Democratic 
Party; at least we would like to go jointly to the elections. 
The fact that we have not formed an integral entity certainly 
makes us weaker, but it would not do to try forcing something 
that is not internally consistent. 
  [Kotian] A problem of the government that failed in the 1992 
elections was the media rendition of their intentions, their 
objectives, their lack of convincibility. Despite having a very 
short term of office, this problem also pertains to you. Do you 
feel certain weaknesses of your government in the sphere of 
media influence? 
  [Moravcik] No, to tell the truth, even if we do not push 
ourselves through as markedly as Vladimir Meciar, for instance. 
I believe it correct. We do not wish to follow the path we 
criticize, and, furthermore, the situation is different from 
what it was after the first recall of Meciar. Now, a large part 
of the population has undergone adverse experiences with his 
government.

<F P=106> [Interview with Miklos Duray, chairman of the Coexistence </F>
Movement, by David Megyeri; place and date not given: 
"Slovak-Hungarian Chances"] 
  [Excerpt] Something has "moved" in Slovakia; we could 
already sense this at the end of February and the beginning of 
March while listening to statements of leading politicians. And 
then the change came about: the fall of the Meciar government 
and the establishment of the new Moravcik government, which let 
it be felt from the first moment that it would like to implement 
different politics, in a European spirit. We asked Miklos Duray 
to analyze and assess the situation and the prospects for the 
region. We first asked him about the chances of the Balladur 
plan. 
  [Duray] Hungarians, especially those living outside Hungary, 
have been particularly interested in the Balladur plan, which 
now, since the summer of 1993, has the name of European 
Stability Agreement in international politics. There are two 
major reasons for this. One is that this plan carries the 
possibility of a new peace treaty, which would actually mean 
making peace after the Cold War. The other possibility is that, 
through this, Hungarians living in their place of birth but 
being stuck outside Hungary could receive some kind of 
international settlement and guarantee. It is this second 
possibility that particularly interests us, mainly because we 
feel that, as a community, we were left out of the preparation 
of this document. To remedy this, we turned to the then 
Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef Antall in the fall of 1993 and 
informed him about our reservations. We mainly turned to him 
because, at that time, both Romania and Slovakia completely 
rejected the plan. In fact, in Slovakia, there was no dialogue 
between the government and the Hungarians. Even then we thought 
that this plan should be changed in such a way that the national 
minorities would also be given an active role in it, or perhaps 
in such a way that, within the given country, an agreement 
should be arrived at between the government and the legitimate 
representatives of the Hungarian communities on how the 
situation of the Hungarians would be settled. However, another 
way could be that the legitimate representatives of the 
Hungarian communities participate in the bilateral talks between 
the neighboring countries and in the preparation of bilateral 
agreements. Antall's government promised that it would identify 
with these proposals and [Prime Minister] Peter Boross's 
government confirmed this. 
  [Megyeri] Do the international political forces support your 
ideas? 
  [Duray] At the end of March, I held talks in Paris with a 
number of French Government and Foreign Ministry experts, and 
with politicians of the biggest government party, the Rally for 
the Republic (RPR, Jacques Chirac's party). My impression is 
that the solution that contains the agreement between the 
government of the given party and the legitimate representatives 
of the Hungarian communities may receive support. I also held 
talks on this in Switzerland with the government in Bern. The 
same solution was found to be acceptable here. Therefore, if 
our suggestion is successful, huge possibilities will be opened 
for us in connection with the Balladur plan--significantly 
bigger possibilities than ever before in the past 75 years. 
  [Megyeri] What if you do not achieve the change of the plan? 
  [Duray] If our efforts are not successful, I openly admit 
that it would be better not to have this plan at all. In that 
case, a worse situation might be created than what emerged as a 
result of the agreement on the protection of national 
minorities, which was made in Saint Germain after World War I. 
  [Megyeri] I feel that what you have said about your talks 
abroad gives grounds for cautious optimism. Can we also use the 
term "cautious optimism" in connection with the statements of 
the new Slovak Government? 
  [Duray] It is a fact that the current government cannot be 
compared with the previous one, neither in a political sense nor 
in terms of its human quality. There seems to be a huge 
difference, and this is clearly in favor of the current 
government. They are willing to hold talks with us. However, 
it has to be known that they were not willing to include us in 
the government. At the same time, it is also true that we are 
having talks and we are invited members of the coalition 
council. Before the government was established, we had agreed 
with them on a set of demands laid down in eight points, as a 
condition for our support of the current government. It seems 
that, in many respects, the government is willing to implement 
these. Talks are under way on the implementation of these 
points. The government program will be submitted to parliament 
for discussion on 12 April, and we hope there will be no reason 
for us not to vote for it. 
  [Megyeri] In your view, what are the possibilities and 
chances for the Moravcik government? 
  [Duray] Their possibilities are limited from two points of 
view. One is the length of the government's mandate, and the 
other is that the government is politically divided. In 
addition to this, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, 
Meciar's party, which has fallen out of government, and its 
partner, the Slovak National Party, and the Matica Slovenska 
behind it, do everything they can to make any possible positive 
steps of this government in our direction very difficult.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Tomanek on a news conference held by members </F>
of the Meciar-led "shadow cabinet" on board the Druzhba on 5 
April on the occasion of the first anniversary of the daily 
REPUBLIKA: "Provisional Cabinet Is Afraid of Control"] 
  [Excerpt] Gabcikovo--[Passage omitted] According to 
members of the shadow cabinet, the Party of the Democratic Left 
[SDL] as the strongest coalition party has an interesting 
position. Even though the government includes 11 former members 
of the Communist Party, the wires are actually being pulled by 
the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH], through the important 
posts of state secretaries. [SDL Chairman] Peter Weiss has 
gotten rid of four SDL representatives who were ready, in the 
interest of stabilizing the Slovak Republic, to negotiate with 
the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] by appointing them 
to posts. Pavol Kanis, Pavol Koncos, and Juraj Hrasko are 
ministers, and Lubomir Fogas is in the European Parliament. The 
SDL, which proclaims its social orientation, has given up these 
government departments and clearly goes after property through 
privatization. 
<H5>  They Are Trading in Deputies </H5>
  According to members of the shadow cabinet, the provisional 
government will try, out of fear of the election outcome, to 
change the electoral law. By asserting a lowering of the 
5-percent threshold [for winning seats in parliament], a greater 
number of parties would get into parliament, and the result 
would be a lasting destabilization of the political scene. The 
attempts by the coalition to gain 90 votes before the elections 
will probably continue. The elections would be in acute danger 
in that case. The government coalition keeps addressing eight 
to nine HZDS deputies, with seven-digit sums flying through the 
air. In spite of everything, Vladimir Meciar is confident of 
the HZDS's victory in the early democratic elections. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Increase in Number of Intelligentsia Members </F>
Registered"] 
  [Excerpt] Bratislava--The Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia [HZDS] has registered a large increase in the number of 
intelligentsia members among its members, and the movement's 
profile is improving from this point of view, HZDS Deputy 
Chairman Sergej Kozlik stated in an interview for TA SR. 
According to his words, statistical data confirm that the 
HZDS's structure is no worse in this regard than that of the 
Party of the Democratic Left. "We even have a lower percentage 
of people with only a basic education than, for example, the 
Christian Democratic Movement," he added. 
  Speaking about meetings between HZDS representatives and 
citizens of Slovakia, Sergej Kozlik said that it was necessary 
to seek forms that would alleviate tension and prevent outbursts 
of aggression, such as the recent physical assaults on four 
journalists. It is questionable, and it has not been proved by 
anyone, that these were HZDS supporters, he said of the 
assailants. He admitted that people are to be seen at the 
movement's rallies who behave in an uncivilized manner, often 
under the influence of alcohol. The HZDS does not regard these 
people as its supporters, however. "Dramatic political 
situations always attract these types of people," he said, and 
did not rule out that an attempt at political provocation might 
be involved. "At any rate, these manifestations are neither 
democratic nor ethical, and there is no place for them on the 
political scene," he stressed. Sergej Kozlik assumes that 
future HZDS rallies would have an expressly civic character.

  [Excerpts] The government's policy statement has been 
debated at the two-day session of the parliamentary committee 
for the national economy and the budget. Deputy Prime Minister 
Brigita Schmoegnerova took part in today's session. After the 
session, our correspondent Bibiana Gunisova asked the 
committee's deputy chairman, Jozef Kosnar, to assess the session: 
  [Begin recording] [Kosnar] As ensues from our committee's 
portfolio, the main points on the agenda were the points of 
departure for, and the risks of economic development. These 
include risks related to the period covering not only this 
government's term of office but especially the risks of the 
budget economy up until the end of 1994. 
  We also considered ways of eliminating these risks and 
creating a possibly more favorable point of departure for the 
development of both the budget economy and the macroeconomic 
indexes in the following period--that is, in 1995. 
  [Gunisova] From your point of view, are these risks 
appropriate? 
  [Kosnar] These risks are greater than the previous 
government 
was willing to admit when approving the 1994 state budget. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Gunisova] In your opinion and according to the committee 
for 
the national economy and the budget, are the proposals for 
tackling economic problems presented in the government's policy 
statement acceptable and realistic? 
  [Kosnar] This is a peculiar situation. The debate was very 
simple. No serious objections were raised against the measures, 
the philosophy or the outlines of concrete solutions, or the 
more detailed explanation presented by the ministers and the 
deputy prime minister. 
  However, when it came to the vote, a certain party 
discipline 
prevailed, and so the result of the vote was that the resolution 
did not receive the simple majority needed for it to be adopted 
by the committee, due to the fact that the deputies for the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia opposed this goverment policy 
statement. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Lubor Kohout: "Are We Releasing a Genie from </F>
the Bottle?"] 
  [Text] The Security and Information Service [BIS] is 
operating according to bill No. 527 of 1992. This bill, 
however, was valid only until the end of 1993. A new bill, 
properly drafted and permanently valid, was expected to be 
passed by the end of 1993. However, it was not drafted by that 
date. To make it possible for BIS to operate even after this 
date, parliament at the very last moment extended the validity 
of the temporary bill until 31 July 1994. Recently, the 
government handed over to parliament a draft in which it 
proposed the principles of the bill. Some of its contents, 
however, are very questionable. 
  For instance, if BIS decides to use intelligence-gathering 
technology against a constitutional official, then, according to 
the draft, this information must be indicated in the request 
handed over to the judge who approves the utilization of this 
technology. This means that only the judge has to be informed 
about the possible BIS eavesdropping on a constitutional 
official, and no one else--that is, neither the president, the 
prime minister, the chairman of parliament, nor the chairman of 
the senate (if the senate is established at all in the Czech 
Republic). It ensues that the government, particularly its 
prime minister, have waived their legal right to be informed 
about eavesdropping on constitutional officials. Vaclav Klaus 
has thus gotten rid of his responsibility. It is as if the 
prime minister told the secret service: "I do not want to know 
anything. It is your business if you want to eavesdrop on a 
constitutional official." 
  The prime minister's reluctance to deal with problems that 
smack of troubles has certainly affected this decision. Had we 
not often heard Klaus call for civic responsibility the 
situation would be less absurd. Like that, responsibility for 
eavesdropping on constitutional officials falls only on the 
judge who has approved it and the BIS director who proposed it. 
No one else has to be informed about it and bear responsibility 
for possible illegal utilization of intelligence technology. In 
other words, if the BIS director believes that, for example, the 
Democratic Union (replace this name with any other name, if 
applicable) is an extremist organization (or is conducting 
activity that could be used as a token justification for 
eavesdropping) and finds a judge who is of the same opinion, 
there is nothing to prevent eavesdropping. The same applies to 
the eavesdropping on deputies, ministers, senators, etc. If the 
representatives of the Democratic Union or another party find 
out and prove that they have been the subjet of [illegal] 
eavesdropping, the BIS director and the judge may be dismissed, 
but that is all. Neither the government nor any other 
politician will be responsible because it knew nothing. The BIS 
director did not even have the obligation to inform them. 
  In a similar way, this also applies to surveillance, where 
only the decision of the BIS director or a designated department 
chief is required. If the BIS director (or a subordinate to 
whom he has delegated this power) decides, for whatever reason, 
to carry out surveillance on a constitutional official, he does 
not have to have the approval of anyone else, nor does he have 
any obligation to inform anyone else--in this case, not even the 
judge. 
  It is impossible to completely rule out the possibility that 
the Secret Service apparatus will be used for political 
objectives. However, we should make such a possibility as 
difficult to materialize as possible and indicate who is 
responsible for the abuse of the secret service. Even if it was 
true that in countries with a long democratic tradition the 
eavesdropping devices have never been misused, the powers 
delegated to the BIS director would still be excessive. 
  The Watergate affair, where eavesdropping on the electoral 
staff of the Democrats was conducted with the knowledge of the 
then Republican President Richard Nixon at the beginning of the 
1970's, shows us that it is important to protect ourselves as 
effectively as possible against the misuse of intelligence 
technology. Well-drafted laws are part of this protection. If 
the Chamber of Deputies approves the bill according to the 
government-drafted principles, this law will certainly be 
flawed. It would help if the ministers and the deputies 
imagined the situation where they themselves could be 
eavesdropped upon or targeted for surveillance.

  [Text] Warsaw, 11 Apr--Two economic agreements, on 
protecting and supporting investments and on avoiding double 
taxation, and a consular convention were signed today in Warsaw 
by Polish and Bulgarian Ministers of Foreign Affairs Andrzej 
Olechowski and Stanislav Daskalov. 
  According to Minister Olechowski, a delay in signing the 
agreements had been caused by weak economic contacts, with which 
neither side is satisfied. According to Minister Daskalov, the 
creation of a legal base will give businessmen of both countries 
a feeling of security and will increase the scope of mutual 
investments. He said that, next year, Polish-Bulgarian talks 
might begin on setting up a free trade zone, when negotiations 
on Bulgaria's membership in GATT will be completed and the issue 
of Bulgaria's debts to Poland will be resolved (Bulgaria owes 
Poland 207 million transfer rubles). 
  The Bulgarian minister announced that it was decided during 
the talks how to resolve a dispute between both states 
concerning the localization of the Polish culture and 
information center in Sofia. 
  International issues were also discussed, including the 
aspirations of both states to the European Union and the 
situation in former Yugoslavia. The war there not only poses 
threats to Bulgaria's security but is also causing great 
economic losses. 
  Daskalow announced that he invited Andrzej Olechowski to pay 
a visit to Bulgaria.

  [Text] Warsaw (DDP/ADN)--Poland's Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak believes that German-Polish cooperation offers scope for 
development. Relations between the two states are good, and 
Germany is Poland's most important trade partner. Nevertheless, 
the opportunities offered by proximity have so far not been 
fully exploited, Pawlak said in an interview with DDP/ADN in 
Warsaw before his visit to Germany, which is due to begin on 
Thursday. "What is needed is stronger commitment in the search 
for partnership and balance," the prime minister said. 
  This applies above all because "certain disproportions" 
became apparent last year. For instance, Polish imports from 
Germany developed more dynamically than exports to Germany. 
Therefore, both sides should strive for equilibrium in the 
balance of trade. In Pawlak's view, for example, the export of 
Polish construction services could be again raised to the level 
reached years ago. 
  In the talks in Bonn, the Polish prime minister wants to 
concentrate on the practical side of cooperation. The priority 
is "the creation of mechanisms and infrastructures that promote 
exchange between companies and relations between people," Pawlak 
said. Governments have many opportunities to facilitate this 
process. The prime minister included in these the creation of a 
financial and transport infrastructure such as new 
border-crossing points, the development of cultural cooperation, 
youth exchanges, and tourism. Pawlak said he wants to talk 
about these issues in Germany. 
  He pointed out that Poland is very attentively watching 
Germany's stand on Poland's efforts to seek rapprochement with 
the EU [European Union] and with NATO. "I think our interests 
coincide in this area," the prime minister stressed.

<F P=106> [Article by Pawel Wronski and Wojciech Zaluska: "They Are </F>
Arguing About the Presidential RBN; Coalition Versus Belweder 
Again"] 
  [Text] The dispute between the coalition and the 
Belweder over Rosati has not yet completely subsided, but there 
is another one looming on the horizon. This time, it is over 
the National Security Council [RBN]: Is it supposed to be Lech 
Walesa's advisory body, or is it supposed to strengthen the 
president's powers? 
  "To clear up the situation, a Walesa-Pawlak-Kwasniewski 
summit meeting is necessary," leaders for the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD] kept saying yesterday. But they refused to 
comment on the president's two preconditions, which Lech Walesa 
says must be met before talks can be conducted: Give up Rosati 
and establish the RBN. 
  "There cannot be any preconditions," Oleksy said. 
  Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy refused to reveal yesterday 
whether 
the coalition has a new candidate for finance minister in lieu 
of Professor Rosati, whose candidacy was rejected by the 
president. Oleksy kept saying that Rosati is still the favorite 
of the SLD and the Polish Peasant Party. Aleksander 
Kwasniewski, who returned from his foreign trip yesterday, kept 
repeating the refrain: "Rosati is still our candidate." 
<H5>  A Dangerous President? </H5>
  Oleksy was also critical of his party colleague [Labor 
Minister] Leszek Miller, who told journalists that the SLD has 
found a new candidate. "Miller has extraordinary inspirations 
sometimes," Oleksy joked. But we learned unofficially that the 
SLD leaders tried to persuade Bank Handlowy Chairman Cezary 
Stypulkowski to take over the Finance Ministry. But 
Stypulkowski does not want to change jobs. 
  In the meantime, the SLD leaders, irritated by Walesa's 
position, are coming back to the idea of amending the Small 
Constitution so as to prevent the president from being able to 
interfere with personnel decisions in ministries. They tried to 
talk the prime minister into this, but without success. Pawlak 
does not want an open conflict with the Belweder. 
  But, during confidential talks with the opposition 
(Democratic Union) before a vote on the president's veto 
regarding neo-popiwek [wage-controlling legislation], Pawlak 
tried to convince his interlocutors that Walesa constitutes a 
threat to democracy and that parliament should resist him. 
<H5>  A Dangerous Council? </H5>
  But, instead of peace at the top, as had been expected, 
there 
emerged a new dispute between the coalition and the Belweder. 
Sejm Speaker Oleksy has said that he does not know what the 
president meant when he talked about the RBN being a forum for 
meetings between the coalition and the Belweder ("We talked in 
different languages," the Sejm speaker said), but Andrzej 
Drzycimski's statement following a Walesa-Oleksy meeting was 
perceived to be yet another precondition set by the president. 
  Since November of last year, the Belweder has been demanding 
that the RBN be established as the supreme state organ 
responsible for the country's security. The council would be 
headed by the president, while its executive organ would be the 
Council of Ministers' Committee for Defense Issues [KSORM], 
headed by the prime minister. 
  Initially, the idea was that the RBN and KSORM were to be 
established in the spring, thanks to "speedy legislative 
proceedings." But then the coalition withdrew its support for 
the idea. "According to the coalition, the establishment of the 
RBN in this form would mean introducing a presidential system 
through a back door." 
  The RBN's existence is provided for by the Small 
Constitution, but it is only described there as the president's 
advisory organ. "A council such as this may be set up at any 
time, just like KSORM," Oleksy declared. "But, if this is to be 
the kind of agency the Belweder wants it to be, there is simply 
no issue." 
<H5>  An Agency or a Plane? </H5>
  Other politicians have also criticized the Belweder's idea 
of 
the RBN as a forum for president-coalition meetings. "It does 
not include, for instance, Aleksander Kwasniewski, chairman of 
the SLD Sejm Deputies Club. How is one supposed to have 
political debates then?" asks Jerzy Szmajdzinski, a secretary 
general of Social Democracy of the Polish Republic. 
  "It is absurd for Lech Walesa to regard the supreme state 
agency for the country's security as a plane for political 
games," says Tomasz Nalecz, of the Union of Labor.

<F P=106> [Article by Robert Krasowski: "Everyone Is Waiting for the </F>
President's Move; Budget '94--Will Lech Walesa Use the Veto?"] 
  [Text] The president has two more weeks in which to 
make a decision on the Budget Law. Many politicians from the 
governing coalition fear that Lech Walesa will wait until the 
last moment, so as not to lose a bargaining chip. After the 
decision made by the Democratic Union [UD], everyone knows that, 
even if the veto is used by the president, it will be 
overturned. According to the most drastic scenario, the veto 
could be a pretext for dissolving the parliament. 
  Shortly after he received the draft of the Budget Law, the 
president stated that he has many reservations with regard to 
it, and that is why he does not know yet whether he will sign 
it. According to the president, the budget, which was prepared 
by the left-wing government, was adapted to the country's 
economic capabilities. That is true enough, but it also 
completely contradicts promises made before the elections. 
  "The nation will feel cheated again," Walesa says. 
  Two weeks passed since that time, and, throughout the 
period, 
the president did not make a decision. Sejm Speaker Jozef 
Oleksy tried to persuade the president on Thursday [7 April] to 
make a decision as soon as possible, so as to enable the 
coalition to "know where it stands." 
  According to the Small Constitution, the president has 30 
days in which to take a stand on a budget, which means he has 
precisely two more weeks to keep the coalition in suspense. 
According to many politicians from the coalition, the president 
will procrastinate until the last moment because the threat of a 
veto may be used as a bargaining chip in negotiations regarding 
filling the posts of deputy prime minister for economic affairs 
and of finance minister. 
  But, following Saturday's statement by UD, to the effect 
that 
the party will not support a possible presidential veto, it has 
become obvious that the coalition will have no problem 
whatsoever pushing the budget through. Only the date of its 
enactment could be a problem. A few days ago, Defense Ministry 
[MON] chief Piotr Kolodziejczyk tried to persuade the president 
to submit the budget to the Constitutional Tribunal. According 
to Kolodziejczyk, the Budget Law interferes with MON's powers to 
an unacceptable extent by telling the ministry what kind of arms 
equipment it is supposed to purchase and where. If the 
president vetoes the budget and sends it to the Tribunal, the 
Sejm will not be able to adopt the budget until after a verdict 
has been rendered by the Tribunal. 
  A dissolution of the Sejm is the most radical scenario; it 
is 
being mentioned by some politicians. The Small Constitution 
provides that the president is empowered to dissolve parliament 
if it fails to adopt a budget within three months. Actually, 
the Sejm did manage to adopt it this time, but an argument could 
be raised that enactment of the budget by the Sejm involves not 
only its adoption by the Sejm and debates on the Senate's 
amendments, but also taking a stand on a possible presidential 
veto. Under this interpretation, three months passed a long 
time ago, but, according to legal experts, no justification can 
be found for the above argument in the Small Constitution.

<F P=106> [Article by "knysz" and "dom": "Perhaps Borowski? Belweder </F>
Sends Up Some Trial Balloons"; passage following the subhead 
attributed to "knysz" and "pw"] 
  [Text] As we discovered yesterday from a politician 
running in Belweder circles, the president's camp is considering 
the possibility of Marek Borowski becoming deputy prime minister 
and finance minister for a second time. 
  By using the mass media, Lech Walesa wants to investigate 
how 
the coalition looks on the idea. 
  That is why Lech Falandysz, a minister in the President's 
Office, said rather casually yesterday, during the "Breakfast 
With Radio Zet" program: "Perhaps Borowski then?" "That is 
very interesting," said a surprised Aleksander Kwasniewski, a 
leader of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. 
  "It is not nonsense," our source from the Belweder tried to 
convince us yesterday. "Borowski was a good finance minister." 
  He also reminded us that the president already signed 
Borowski's nomination once in the past, and without any 
reservations. "So he can do it a second time," the source says. 
According to him, the reason the president signed Borowski's 
resignation so fast was that he thought Prime Minister Pawlak 
had a good candidate for the post. "But now we know that is not 
the case. So perhaps it could be Borowski after all?" This is 
the way the Belweder politician spoke about it. 
  But he is also afraid that such a scenario would be a bitter 
pill for the coalition to swallow. "It would have to admit that 
it had let go of a competent minister too easily," the Belweder 
source speculates. "They would also have to officially give up 
Rosati's candidacy, and that is something they, for the moment 
at least, find extremely difficult to come to terms with." 
  SLD Press Spokesman Zbigniew Siemiatkowski has said that the 
suggestion constitutes a clear message from the Belweder, but 
the SLD has yet to take a position on the issue. "At any rate, 
the concerned person [Borowski] is in Japan at the moment," the 
spokesman added. 
  It is also not known how Prime Minister Pawlak will respond 
to the proposal. Not so long ago, cooperation between the prime 
minister and a former deputy prime minister [Borowski] proved 
impossible, which resulted in Borowski's resignation. 
  Labor Minister Leszek Miller regards the whole thing as a 
joke by the Belweder: "It is indeed quite a perfidious kind of 
message to send, given the rush with which Lech Walesa signed 
Marek Borowski's resignation," Miller said. 
  According to other SLD politicians, the rush was very 
strange. Some expert opinions compiled on the SLD's order say 
that the president should not accept a resignation until he is 
determined to sign the nomination of a new minister. The Small 
Constitution provides that the president "makes changes" in 
ministerial posts. 
  Leszek Miller says that the SLD has a reserve candidate and 
that Borowski is not the one. "We will not reveal his name 
until the nomination is agreed upon within the prime 
minister-president-SLD triangle," Minister Miller adds. 
<H5>  Where To Meet? </H5>
  The Belweder is gradually abandoning the idea it put forward 
on Thursday [7 April] that sessions of the National Defense 
Committee [KOK] be the only site for meetings between the 
president and the government chief. 
  "These are two separate issues," Presidential Spokesman 
Andrzej Drzycimski explained to us yesterday. "The president 
wants KOK sessions to be a permanent place for debates on 
strategic issues by the country's most important people. 
Spur-of-the-moment meetings with the prime minister are quite 
another story." 
  Let us recall that Drzycimski said on Thursday that a 
National Security Council (which has not yet been established) 
or KOK sessions should be where the coalition consults the 
president. The idea resulted in immediate protests by the 
coalition politicians, who perceived a speedy establishment of 
the council to be another precondition for talks with the head 
of state.

<F P=106> [Article by "awo": "CBOS on President"] </F>
  [Text] The Small Constitution did not arm the president 
with sufficient range of powers to meet his suggested ideal 
model of the sociopolitical and administrative state system. 
However, the citizens of the Polish Republic do not share his 
view in this matter. In a March poll conducted by the Public 
Opinion Survey Center [CBOS], they expressed the opinion that 
the president wields too much rather than too little power. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|How much power does the president have at the moment?                        |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The picture emerging from the public response to the poll 
seems to highlight the president's "political games." Lech 
Walesa is perceived more as a person entangled in a variety of 
tactical stratagems than a politician concentrating on solving 
the state's problems. 
  In its commentary on the poll, the CBOS admits that it is 
not 
clear how far the president's identity and personality influence 
respondents' inclination to accord him a wider range of powers 
or, conversely, to stipulate that his powers should be 
restricted. It seems that the office is to a large extent 
identified with the person. Lech Walesa generates much public 
emotion, and, as a result, he is easily assessed according to 
stereotyped categories. Consequently, the CBOS claims, it could 
be assumed that opinions on the president's place and range of 
powers are influenced by the fact that we are talking 
specifically about Lech Walesa as incumbent in that office. It 
follows from this that it is important to identify the 
president's goals. 
  The ultimate targets to which the public believes Lech 
Walesa 
aspires are as follows: reinforcement of his power, 46 percent; 
winning the next election for another term of office, 40 
percent; weakening his political opponents, 25 percent; 
attainment of law and order in the country, 24 percent; keeping 
the "commies" firmly under control, 19 percent; improvement of 
Poland's position in the world, 16 percent; acceleration of the 
economic reforms, 13 percent. 
  A lenient attitude toward the president is conducive to 
greater tolerance in assessing the activities of the Solidarity 
Independent Trade Union. Acceptance of the work of the Sejm is, 
as a rule, accompanied by approval of the government's 
activities. These two options are, to a large extent, mutually 
exclusive. Those questioned are on the whole more ready to 
accept the work of the Sejm and the government than that of the 
president and Solidarity.

<F P=106> [Article by "NIKA": "Highest Pessimism Since August 1993"] </F>
  [Text] The level of social optimism is the lowest since 
August 1993. That is the result of a survey conducted by the 
Public Opinion Research Center [OBOP] at the end of March. A 
majority of Polish people (58 percent) think that the affairs of 
the country are heading in the wrong direction. Only one in 
four Poles is of the opinion that the situation is improving. 
  Seventy-nine percent of those polled say that moods among 
people are bad, and just 15 percent think they are good. Among 
the optimists, the most prevalent social groups are young people 
under age 19 (32 percent) and people who are well off 
financially (26 percent). 
  One-fourth of those polled predict an improvement in living 
conditions over the next three years, but one-third think that 
conditions will deteriorate. The latter view is shared most 
often by people between the ages of 40 and 49, with primary 
vocational educations and who are in poor financial condition. 
  Assessments regarding the current economic situation in the 
country are not the best, either. Only 5 percent of those 
polled think that the country's economic development is 
satisfactory, but as many as half of those polled (44 percent) 
are of the opposite view. 
  The number of people dissatisfied with the way democracy is 
developing in Poland is also on the increase (64 percent). It 
is the highest percentage since August 1993 of people negatively 
evaluating the social transformations. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  The survey was conducted by OBOP in the period 23-29 March 
of 
this year, using a random sample of 1,197 people.

<F P=106> [Article by "em" and "krzem:" "Diplomats and Politicians"] </F>
  [Text] The foreign minister agrees to deputy 
ministers coming from the coalition, but first he wants to 
reform the ministry by separating the political top from the 
apolitical rest of the ministry. 
  "I want to have two deputy ministers submitted by the 
parties 
of the governing coalition in the Foreign Ministry [MSZ] by 1 
July at the latest," announced Minister Olechowski. What must 
happen first is the introduction of a reform of the MSZ, which 
has been prepared and was presented by the minister to the Sejm 
Foreign Affairs Commission yesterday. The new deputy ministers 
will be performing political roles, and they will not perform 
managerial functions with regard to anything in the MSZ. The 
current deputy ministers will most probably take up the posts of 
director generals. 
  If the government approves the project, the MSZ will be the 
first ministry in which the political top (the minister, his 
deputy, and his cabinet), which usually changes with every 
government, will be statutorily separated from the apolitical 
office chaired by a secretary general. 
  The new concept, which was prepared over a period of three 
months by a hundred experts led by Jerzy Kozminski, a secretary 
of state in the MSZ, is said to be liked by the president. 
  For a few months, Sejm deputies for the coalition were 
critical of Krzysztof Skubiszewski, the former MSZ chief, for a 
"disastrous personnel policy." Yesterday, Olechowski outlined 
some new principles of recruitment, promotion, and assignments 
to posts abroad. We know unofficially that he was hoping that 
this would lead to termination of the infamous Sejm 
subcommission for MSZ personnel, which was established in 
January in order to "settle accounts with the MSZ." 
  Olechowski's ideas were enthusiastically received by the 
Sejm 
deputies, but Andrzej Micewski (an independent) unexpectedly 
moved for an extension of the subcommission's mandate by three 
months. Olechowski responded with anger: "This contributes to 
an atmosphere of scandal surrounding the ministry. Neither the 
MSZ nor Polish foreign policy nor the interests of the Polish 
state benefit from the subcommission's activity." 
  Micewski's proposal was rejected by one vote, but it is not 
known how the conflict will end because the Sejm deputies for 
the coalition put the results of the vote in question.

<F P=106> [Article by A.K.K.: "Finances of Privatization; How Much for </F>
the Treasury"] 
  [Text] In line with preliminary calculations from the 
Finance Ministry, last year's privatization yielded 7.8037 
trillion zlotys [Z]. The share of capital privatization--that 
is, the sale of stocks and shares of the Treasury--was Z4,8312 
billion; the liquidation privatization--that is, the sale of 
liquidated companies or parts of their property--was Z1.2199 
trillion. 
  This means that the privatization of state-run enterprises 
and banks did not yield the expected revenues: It was expected 
in the 1993 budget that privatization revenues would equal Z8.8 
trillion. This sum was supposed to be obtained from all sorts 
of privatization--that is, capital and liquidation 
privatization; this means that not only the Ownership 
Transformations Ministry was supposed to work to achieve it, but 
also other ministries that supervise privatization as well as 
other founding organs--first of all, voivods. 
  If one wanted to find out what the real privatization 
revenues are, one would have to take into account not only the 
budget's revenues obtained from privatization, but also costs 
incurred because of that. The results concerning all of 1993 
have not yet been prepared. In a brochure published by the 
Polish Economic Society, the authors Danuta Milczewska, Jacek 
Partyka, and Marianna Strzyzewska, using data from the beginning 
of privatization until the third quarter of last year, say that 
capital privatization yielded Z9.456 trillion for the 
state--that is, 64 percent of all privatization revenues. In 
that sum, foreign investors' contribution was Z5.541 billion. 
  At that time, on the basis of Article 19 of the Law on State 
Enterprises, 191 enterprises were liquidated, yielding Z592 
billion for the state; this means that, on average, one 
state-owned enterprise that was liquidated in this way was 
handed over to a private owner for Z3.1 billion. The revenues 
from the liquidation carried out on the basis of the 
privatization law--the liquidation of enterprises that were in 
better financial condition (there were 691 such cases)--came to 
Z4.575 billion. That means that one firm was sold for an average 
Z6.6 billion. 
  Since the privatization process began, the share of revenues 
derived from liquidation carried out on the basis of the 
privatization law--that is, voluntary privatization, not 
privatization forced by a poor financial-economic situation--has 
been 88 percent. At the same time, however, the number of weak 
enterprises has recently been growing faster than the number of 
companies that voluntarily chose the privatization path. Toward 
the end of September, there were 1,095 of the former and 723 of 
the latter. 
  This means that the state will not only have smaller 
revenues 
from the liquidation of enterprises (smaller direct revenues 
plus overdue payments to the budget) but also that the property 
will not be managed very efficiently. (After bankruptcy 
liquidation, the property is most frequently sold separately, 
less often, sold as a whole; after liquidation for the purpose 
of privatization, a given enterprise is most often leased or 
sold.) 
  The costs that accompany ownership transformations are, 
among 
others, outlays for sector research, notary fees, remuneration 
for consulting companies, advertising costs, and commissions 
paid to banks for the sale of shares. In 1992, outlays for 
privatization were set in the Budget Law for Z263 billion plus 4 
percent of the revenues from capital privatization. In all, 
Z365.8 billion, or 7.6 percent in comparison with all 
privatization revenues, was spent for this purpose. In the 1993 
Budget Law, outlays were set at the level of Z320 billion plus 4 
percent of the revenues from capital privatization. That means 
that the outlays should not have been greater than Z594 billion.

<F P=106> [Article by "hen": "The Petroleum Business"] </F>
  [Text] Unless Polish petroleum refineries are thoroughly 
modernized, they will not be able to stand up to competition 
from Western petroleum concerns after 1997. The capital 
investment projects required for their modernization will amount 
to $3-3.5 million. If we fail to find enough money to finance 
these, it is possible that the entire petroleum refining 
industry will have to be liquidated. The refineries themselves 
should be able to produce a significant share of the funds. 
Modernization is a much more urgent priority for this sector of 
the economy than ownership transformations. 
  This view is shared by the leadership teams heading our 
industry sectors. An intersectoral group set up by the prime 
minister will elaborate a project of restructuring the 
petroleum-extracting and -refining industry, which is expected 
to require about 100 trillion zlotys [Z]. Experts believe that 
the banks, together with petroleum refineries, which at present 
make profits on the order of 15 percent, will be able to produce 
this sum over the next few years. There is no shortage of 
opinions claiming that, if the petroleum sector were to be 
privatized, the budget's losses would overtake the revenues from 
the sale of selected elements of this industry to foreign 
concerns. Only partial privatization would be considered. The 
state does not intend to willingly relinquish control over the 
fuels market and its development strategy. 
  Foreign concerns are not particularly interested in 
participating in the modernization of Polish petroleum 
refineries. They find the prospect of taking over our fuel 
market a much more attractive proposition. The Central Agency 
for Petroleum Products remains the largest purveyor of fuels in 
Poland, selling them at 1,370 gas stations throughout the 
country. Private distributors sell much less gas, despite the 
fact that they have as many as 2,500 gas stations. Foreign 
petroleum concerns invest increasingly large sums of money in 
the development of the retail distribution network. Recently, 
16 large fuel stations were built by foreign petroleum 
companies, including three by Esso and six by the Neste concern. 
The U.S. petroleum concern Conoco is very active in Poland. To 
date, it has built four fuel stations in Poland. A fifth 
station is currently being built in Radom, and the construction 
of another three--in Czechowice-Dziedzice, Tychy, and Lublin--is 
to be launched in the next few weeks. The Conoco concern has 
already invested some $7 million in the expansion of its retail 
distribution network in Poland.

<F P=106> [Interview with Leslaw Farner, representative of the </F>
Economic Information Agency (AIG) in Szczecin, by Pawel 
Winiarski; place and date not given; from pages 1 and 5 of the 
Business section] 
  [Text] [Winiarski] The legal situation of firms providing 
services as so-called economic intelligence agencies is rather 
unclear. Where does economic information end and spying begin? 
  [Farner] Indeed, the legal status of economic intelligence 
agencies in Poland is not specified in definitive detail. 
However, this is also the consequence of the fact that many 
other things in our economy have not been properly legally 
defined. Economic intelligence agencies are not particularly 
loved anywhere in the world, but their role in the stabilization 
of the economy is nonetheless appreciated. Their existence 
minimizes the risk inherent in all economic initiatives that 
require cooperation with one, several, or even more contractors 
or subcontractors. Economic intelligence agencies make it their 
business to gather generally accessible information about such 
firms and to analyze their findings. Their conclusions can 
provide a basis for deciding whether to enter into cooperation 
or terminate negotiations. 
  [Winiarski] What does "generally accessible information" 
mean? 
  [Farner] It means information that reports companies' 
turnover, profitability, and credit rating, and supplies lists 
of their contractors and subcontractors as well as regular 
clients. The better these data look, the more attractive the 
given firm's business image, which in turn helps to make 
business contacts and secure new contracts. In Poland, that 
sort of information is often deliberately withheld and made 
"classified" by the firms themselves, which usually does more 
harm than good. A business partner who has something to hide is 
simply not very credible. Of course, I refer here to 
information that should not be kept secret. Consequently, many 
firms, both Polish and foreign, use the services of economic 
intelligence agencies not in order to analyze the available 
information but to obtain it in the first place. This secrecy 
undermines the credibility of may Polish enterprises. 
  [Winiarski] So you believe that all information should be 
for sale? 
  [Farner] Most emphatically not! Paradoxically, our 
companies do not attach any importance to the protection of 
information that is really essential to their interests. I am 
thinking here mainly of technological processes and information 
networks and data bases that can be penetrated very easily, 
without even needing to enter company premises. There are firms 
in our country that pursue such activity in the guise of 
economic intelligence agencies. That is a most dangerous 
phenomenon. 
  [Winiarski] Do Polish companies often turn to firms like the 
AIG to secure their help in checking out foreign, or even 
domestic, contacts? 
  [Farner] In my view, they do it far too seldom, and even 
when they do turn to us, it is usually five minutes before they 
are due to sign a contract. That is when the real trouble 
starts. It is only large companies, with properly developed 
marketing networks, that have come to appreciate the 
"preventive" role of economic intelligence agencies and use 
their help from the very start of the negotiating process. This 
not only allows them to save time but also saves them a lot of 
money. The truth is that, unless we begin to treat our own 
money seriously, we are bound to lose it. 
  We still need some time before we can come to appreciate 
that truth properly. Nevertheless, even now there are some 
discernible changes for the better in our economic landscape. 
The number of fraudulent operations actually carried out or 
attempted in our business circles is decreasing, although it is 
still difficult to check out and assess the credibility of 
business partners with 100-percent certainty. We are still 
waiting to see the creation of trade and industrial 
organizations, membership of which would be tantamount to a 
guarantee of a company's credibility and reliability. It is 
also quite hard to put proper information dossiers together in 
our circumstances and to build up adequate data bases for 
economic analysis. 
  [Winiarski] So how do you solve this problem? 
  [Farner] During the three years our firm has been in 
operation, we have collected information on nearly 800,000 
economic entities throughout Poland. We have standing 
cooperation agreements with 15,000 partners, and we have 
accumulated a considerable pool of information on foreign firms 
operating in our country. This gives us a significant overall 
bank of information, which enables us to carry out many 
commissions thoroughly and accurately. It also helps us in work 
involving finalization of completed negotiation processes before 
the signing of final contracts. This sometimes enables us to 
save our client firms from getting into serious trouble. 
  [Winiarski] Have you handled such cases in our region? 
  [Farner] Yes, there were several such cases here. Not long 
ago, a Szczecin manufacturing plant was virtually on the eve of 
finalizing a rather large contract for the amount of $100,000 
with a foreign partner. The name of the foreign company sounded 
good, and its letterhead looked impressive, but the Polish firm 
still turned to us--at the last moment--to check out its 
potential partner's credibility. And what did we find? It was 
a typical front company, intending to cheat the Polish partner. 
Fortunately, we were able to ascertain this before the final 
contract was signed. 
  [Winiarski] So what guidelines should our companies follow 
before they move to finalize any business transactions? 
  [Farner] First of all, they should adopt the principle that 
"a lack of confidence in a potential partner means that you take 
your own interests seriously." They must not be impressed by 
the way the partner's representatives look and dress, by their 
cars, the equipment and interior design of their offices, or 
their declarations of a splendid financial condition. 
Everything should be checked and cross-checked several times 
over, and expert assistance should be sought for that. 
  [Winiarski] But where are the trustworthy experts to be 
found? After all, you admitted yourself that there are 
occasional black sheep among economic intelligence agencies. 
  [Farner] There is no precise recipe here. One possible 
successful method of choosing such a partner is through the 
grapevine--that is, obtaining a report on the work of an 
economic intelligence agency from people who have used its 
services before. And it is definitely essential to make use of 
their services, just as it is essential to treat one's money 
seriously and not invest it in risky undertakings. It is not 
enough to find a potential partner; you must still sign a 
satisfactory contract with him, which will offer a good chance 
of profitable business to both sides. Business dealings require 
not only mutual respect but also mutual confidence. However, 
you have to work hard to secure both.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- Special Russian envoy 
Vitaliy Churkin said after the talks with Srpska republic 
president Radovan Karadzic in Pale this evening that "ways are 
being sought to restore the peace negotiations and to find a 
political solution to the current crisis." 
  President Karadzic said Russian diplomats would try to 
bridge 
the current gap between the Serb side and the UN Protection 
Forces [UNPROFOR]. 
  The talks between Churkin and Karadzic lasted almost an 
hour. 
The Russian envoy said he was immediately leaving for Sarajevo, 
where he should meet UNPROFOR officials. 
  "I hope to return [to Pale] this evening to resume talks 
with 
president Karadzic," Churkin added. 
  Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic told reporters 
that the previous crisis (NATO ultimatum on 20 February) had 
been successfully resolved owing to Churkin. 
  "However, now we do not know how to find a way out of this 
situation, but we know for certain that UNPROFOR has abused the 
presence of UN representatives,, blamed the Serbs for the 
attacks, and bombed our positions," Karadzic said. 
  "We do not see how we can cooperate with UNPROFOR when they 
have sided with one of the sides in the civil war. However, the 
Russian diplomacy will try to bridge the gap between us and 
UNPROFOR," Karadzic said. 
  It is expected that talks between Karadzic and Churkin will 
be resumed later this evening after the Russian envoy returns 
from the Muslim part of Sarajevo.

  [Text] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army Press Center has 
announced that all information points to the fact that Generals 
Perisic [chief of the General Staff of the FRY Army] and Mladic 
are directly commanding the Serbian aggressor's offensive on 
Gorazde. 
  The immediate commander of the ground forces is Colonel 
Grubac, who has received orders to unconditionally continue 
(?attacks) and capture Gorazde. It is up to him to decide on 
the means of achieving this. The Chetnik warlords' intentions 
toward Gorazde have not been deterred by yesterday's NATO air 
strikes. The losses inflicted by the NATO air strikes on 
Chetnik positions are not significant for Perisic, Mladic, and 
Grubac, although the targets that were hit are obviously 
important to the Chetniks and there is reliable information that 
they suffered losses on their side. [Words indistinct] will not 
say a word about this, just like they did not admit that it was 
their planes that were shot down over Novi Travnik at the 
beginning of March this year. 
  Information [words indistinct] must not be given out. 
Karadzic and Mladic have imposed an embargo on everything that 
is happening around Gorazde. Colonel Grubac, who has orders to 
capture Gorazde, did not take the NATO planes' attack as a 
threat. On the contrary. This is yet another in a series of 
motives to continue carrying out his orders. General Momcilo 
Perisic is chief of the General Staff of the Army of the 
so-called Yugoslavia, and although he and Mladic are the same 
generation as far as their education in military schools is 
concerned, when it comes to operations around Gorazde, Perisic 
is avoiding Mladic. He is often in contact with Colonel Grubac, 
who directly briefs him on all events. Perisic's obsession is 
the forcing of the Drina River, which is why he has sent 
pontoons of the so-called Army of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia to this area. It is not excluded that in case of 
repeated NATO air strikes, the Chetnik forces will attempt to 
down them. The Chetnik persistence best shows whether and how 
many more planes again need to attack the aggressor's phalanx 
around Gorazde, states the Bosnia- Herzegovina Army Press Center.

  [Excerpt] This evening is no different from the previous 15 
days of the chetnik offensive. The town is still being fired on 
while the attacks of Karadzic's followers are under way in the 
surrounding area. At around 1900 the attacks by aggressor's 
artillery from the direction of Ustipraca intensified. 
Immediately after that mortars fired on a central part of town. 
  Serb artillery was active throughout the day. Several 
buildings in the town have been hit, among them a building 
housing refugees. According to figures released by the 
authorities, six people had been killed and 27 wounded by 1500.

  [Excerpts] This afternoon NATO aircraft attacked Serb 
positions near the eastern Bosnian town of Gorazde for the 
second time in 24 hours. [passage omitted] 
  In the N-TV "Newspunkt" program, Bosnian Prime Minister 
Haris 
Silajdzic commented on the NATO air strikes on Serb positions. 
  [Haris Silajdzic, in English, with superimposed German 
translation] "The principle is right but unfortunately it is not 
enough. This is not enough of a deterrent. Unfortunately there 
was too much hesitation, and then when finally intervention 
came, it was only half-hearted. Although we really welcome the 
work of NATO and the United Nations, it is still not enough. I 
think a not very strong message was sent there, not strong 
enough." 
  [Announcer] To the question of what more had to be done, 
Silajdzic told N-TV: 
  [Silajdzic] "As far as I know, two or three tanks were 
destroyed in these attacks. Serb soldiers, however, destroyed 
far more than 10 Bosnian tanks and the people in them. The 
lesson is not yet hard enough. A clear lesson would be to 
destroy all the Serbs' tanks, that is the only way. A clear 
message would be to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnians. 
As you know we have been denied this so far. The international 
community owes us this, however. Then we can deal with our own 
defense. Let us defend ourselves and we will do it ourselves."

  [Text] Sarajevo, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- The NATO air force and 
Muslim formations in the area of Gorazde carried out 
synchronized attacks against Serb positions between 1415 and 
1445 today, the information service of the Srpska republic army 
general staff has said in a statement. 
  The statement says that the Srpska republic army 
"successfully responded to the strong attack and is holding its 
positions." 
  A NATO C-130 transport carrying a NATO rapid intervention 
unit with a large quantity of ammunition, weapons, and military 
equipment, landed at Tuzla airport at 1650, the statement says. 
  The general staff of the army of the Srpska republic has 
learned from reliable sources that rapid intervention forces 
with their weaponry and equipment have been sent from 
Frankfurt's NATO base to operate together with members of the 
Muslim force against Serb units, the statement says. 
  The synchronised attack in the Gorazde area and the abuse of 
Tuzla airport as a military means (the airport is yet to be 
opened to humanitarian operations) indicates that UN Protection 
Forces [UNPROFOR] units have overstepped their mandate and that 
they bear all responsibility for further escalation of conflict 
in the area of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement says. 
  It adds that the UNPROFOR's present activities fully confirm 
the assumption that they have openly sided with the Muslim 
forces and become directly involved in the civil war in the area 
of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (TANJUG) -- Jovan Zametica, 
spokesman for president of the Bosnian Serb republic Radovan 
Karadzic, on Monday warned the international public, and 
particularly the world organization, of the far-reaching 
consequences of continuing military action against Serb military 
forces in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  If Serb lives are threatened with the U.N. air strikes the 
conduct of the Bosnian Serb Army [VRS] towards U.N. Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) troops on the ground cannot be guaranteed, 
Zametica told BBC radio. 
  If air strikes continue we shall find ourselves at war with 
the United Nations, said Zametica. 
  The VRS general staff said on Monday morning that the VRS 
artillery "was not shelling Gorazde at all so that UNPROFOR 
forces, members of humanitarian organizations, and the civilian 
population cannot be in any danger". 
  "The Moslem war propaganda launches new fabrications from 
Gorazde, which dangerously fuel reckless decisions about the 
combat use of NATO air force and contribute to the escalation of 
the war", said the VRS general staff. 
  Croatian radio on Monday morning quoted the U.N. commander 
in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Lieutenant-General Rose as saying that 
Gorazde was quiet on Monday morning and denying Moslem 
accusations that Serb forces were attacking the town. 
  When asked directly on Monday morning if the Serbs were 
attacking the eastern enclave of Gorazde, Rose answered 
negatively and said his reports were "extremely accurate".

  [Text] Sarajevo, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, said this evening that Gorazde 
cannot be considered a protected zone because the Muslim forces 
in the towns of Gorazde, Zepa, and Srebrenica have not been 
disarmed nor has the area been demilitarized, as the UN 
resolution envisaged. 
  "Constant attacks on our territory have been launched from 
this area and our soldiers have been killed in the actions of 
the Muslim forces launched from the territory under UN 
protection," Karadzic told Serb radio and television. 
  "We do not want to negotiate any more about the territories 
for which our young men are dying, for the Muslim side has 
chosen the war option over the peace process, and will thus have 
to accept the war results as well," he added. 
  Speaking about the Srpska republic's stance regarding the 
current situation, president Karadzic noted that all contacts 
with the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] have been suspended, 
including those with its civilian department. 
  "We want to establish exactly who in UNPROFOR is responsible 
and to what extent. We will then decide whether and with whom 
we will communicate. They cannot play a role of an impartial 
mediator and do what they are doing," the president said. 
  Speaking about the role of the United Nations and NATO in 
the 
new conditions in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Karadzic said 
he blames NATO less, for its role is one of a mercenary. 
  "They are not choosy about the means of achieving their 
goals 
-- today they shot at an ambulance clearly marked as a Red Cross 
vehicle, which is the best illustration of their role," Karadzic 
said. 
  Karadzic said that the United Nations is "dangerously 
nearing 
the point of no return." 
  "They will have to regain their soul, to return to a 
balanced 
an impartial policy. If they do not do this, nobody will allow 
the UN forces access to their territories," Karadzic said and 
continued: "We will now reconsider whether we will permit them 
any kind of activities in our territories." 
  Karadzic said that the cooperation between the civil and 
military authorities of the Srpska republic is excellent and 
that speculations in connection with this clearly indicate the 
interest of some centers in the West to destabilize the Srpska 
republic which, as he said, "shows how powerful a united nation 
is." 
  Asked about the situation in the immediate future, Karadzic 
said: "I think that we are winning. It is clear that we are 
winning and the anger of some international factors illustrates 
this best." 
  "They threatened to bomb us. We have rejected the pressure 
and now we have seen the implementation of these threats. We 
have seen what they did and the manner in which they did it, how 
precise they were, and now they are free to go home because they 
have used their last card. Their repertoire has been exhausted 
with this act," Karadzic said, pointing out that the Serb nation 
would never forgive its leadership if it acted in a cowardly 
manner. 
  "They would have never forgiven us if we had got scared and 
if our army had stopped. We have our goals. Gorazde is not a 
safe area. Gorazde is a Muslim forces' stronghold from which 
they have been attacking us and this was recently confirmed by 
UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali himself. Gorazde also belongs 
to the Serbs and they have the right to return to that town. We 
will protect the Muslim civilians, too, because wo are not 
waging a war against civilians but against the enemy, the Muslim 
army," Karadzic told Serb radio and television.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 12 Apr (TANJUG) -- I have to say that NATO 
bombarded the center of Gorazde, its Muslim part, with horrible 
consequences -- a large number of people were killed in this 
attack, Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic said this 
morning following his talks with Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin. 
  I am going to visit Gorazde to find out as to how we can 
help 
the Muslim civilians in a most effective way since NATO is 
bombing both sides, Karadzic said as he was setting off for 
Gorazde. 
  The president of the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
met Vitaliy Churkin, Russia's deputy minister for foreign 
affairs late last night following the latter's visit to the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] command in Sarajevo. The talks 
continued this morning, although no major success has been 
achieved. 
  Churkin's idea was to organize a meeting of Karadzic, 
Yasushi 
Akashi, and Charles Redman, the U.S. President's special envoy 
for the former Yugoslavia, but this initiative was met with no 
enthusiasm on the part of the leadership of the Srpska republic, 
TANJUG has learned from reliable sources. 
  The question of what to discuss, and how, with those 
officials who had taken an active part in taking the decision to 
bomb Serb territories remains the main obstacle.

<F P=106> [Interview with Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska </F>
republic, by unidentified correspondent in Pale on 11 April -- 
recorded, monitored in progress] 
  [Text] [Karadzic] ...at the time of the London Conference 
we lifted the blockade of Gorazde. The Muslims abused this. We 
now still have Serbs in Gorazde. For a whole two years the cries 
of Serbs could be heard from Gorazde. Our troops on the 
surrounding mountain peaks could hear them and it was not easy 
for them. If the attacks continue, we will employ the measures 
that all peoples and armies employ in self-defense. If we deem 
it necessary, we shall proclaim a state of war. It is clear 
then, that we have to name the aggressor and all the structures 
that belong to this aggressor are not welcome on our territory, 
but we are convinced that incidents will not happen, with the 
exception of what we command and the orders issued from the 
level of the General Staff and the Interior Ministry. In any 
case, our army showed restraint, and that is why the effects of 
the bombings were not worrying. Moreover, we have our objective 
and that is the breaking of the Muslim offensive. If the 
attacks should continue, I am convinced that an escalation is 
unavoidable, but everyone needs to know that we will not become 
frightened. Our people have a goal, they know precisely that 
they are right. Our army is ready and raring to go, and we have 
no reason to be afraid. There is no air force that can deter us 
from realizing our goals, nor can it turn the war luck. On the 
contrary, it can plunge the entire region into a crisis, and, as 
I said, the West will be the first to plunge into a crisis 
because of what it has done. We believe that the international 
community is pushing us precisely in the direction that it 
wanted to divert us from. It is pushing us toward creating a 
unified state. If the Serbian people continue to be exposed to 
our enemies' attacks and to the international community's 
benevolence toward our enemies, it may decide to go ahead with 
unification. We want everything to progress in phases, and we 
want everything to progress in accordance with the international 
community. However, if the international community continues 
with such behavior, we may decide to take a different course. 
And then the international community will find itself facing a 
fait accompli. 
  [Correspondent] What is the Serbian side's position in the 
war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina regarding a political 
solution to the war, the crisis in these areas, that is, and 
tell us frankly what is the Serb side's position regarding the 
partition of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Karadzic] Well, look at it this way. We did not want this 
war, we did not want the (?disintegration) of Yugoslavia, or if 
you want to put it this way, we are still in Yugoslavia because 
we never agreed to leave it. We were forced to create our 
republic in order to be able to defend ourselves and to 
legitimate all our efforts. The essential interest of the 
Serbian people is to live in one state. Our priority is 
unification with Serbia. We are even ready to consign the 
Srpska republic to memory, and to unite with Serbia as a whole 
[sentence as heard]. If this proves impossible, we will accept 
the status of some kind of Serbian federation for as long as we 
want it, and then later we will go ahead with unification. If, 
however, this too proves impossible, we will nevertheless not 
give up on independence. Whether we are going to link up with 
someone after recognition, and who this will be, this remains 
[changes thought] this is a political issue. 
  As far as territory is concerned, let me put it this way: If 
Serbs are dying for their village, then they are not giving it 
up. Knowing the concessions the Serbs would have made, it is 
completely unclear why the Muslims are attacking certain areas 
that could have been theirs without any struggle. Since they 
are fighting, and the Serbs are dying for these areas, they will 
not get anything. The Muslims are at a great risk of losing 
everything. We hold (?64 percent) of the territory as our own, 
and we live on (?65 percent) of the territory as a majority 
people. We control 72 percent of the territory. We will 
probably have to give back at least the percentage from 72 to 64 
percent [sentence as heard]. Perhaps -- in the name of 
communications and [word indistinct] and so forth -- we could 
go a little below (?64 percent). However, 50 percent or below 
50 percent.... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] Forty-nine, which is [words 
indistinct] 
  [Karadzic] That is out of the question. That was a variant 
in which the Muslims would get 33 and the Croats 17 or 17.5 
percent had peace been signed that day. At the same time, there 
is a calculation that, I admit, (?has been calculated) by Mr. 
Krajisnik, which is correct. We should actually get 60 percent 
and the Muslims and Croats should get 50 percent. 
  This means, that the former Bosnia-Herzegovina has 110 
percent, naturally. This is actually so, as the Muslims and the 
Croats have some territories that overlap, that is, the 
territories that [word indistinct] to the Muslims and the Croats 
alike. Therefore, the Muslims and the Croats can satisfy their 
appetites in this respect. However, if a war solution takes 
place, we will most definitely keep everything. For this reason 
it is much better for the opposite side to immediately agree on 
restoration of peace and political talks. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, in place of my last question, 
would you like to send a message to our nation, which probably 
expects you to say something regarding the latest events? 
  [Karadzic] I can say that all the Serbs worldwide are proud 
of the way in which we, here, have faced the threats of bombing. 
Now, the bombing has materialized and we have seen what it 
looks like. Simply as if the people would say, fire away and we 
will see what next, what you want. The people feel as strong as 
Antaeus, they feel strong because they are on their own soil. 
  I would like to send a message to our people not to worry, 
as 
it will be the way the people have decided. The authorities, 
the army, and the police will do what constitutes the tendency 
and aspiration of our nation. We know this aspiration from 
several referendums, from the first elections, and finally also 
from daily contacts.

  [Text] Belgrade, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the Srpska assembly, said today that "the U.S. 
bombing of Serb positions is a crime against the Serb people and 
against peace." 
  It is obvious that neither the United States nor the UN are 
ready for the establishment of peace in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Krajisnik told Radio Yugoslavia following 
yesterday's bombing of Serb positions near Gorazde. 
  The Serbs have the right to defend themselves and will not 
allow the UN to help the Muslims to improve their positions, 
Krajisnik added. 
  He stressed that the Serb side has demanded to be told by 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] who ordered the bombing and that 
those who made the decision to authorize the attack would be 
unwelcome in the Srpska republic. 
  Krajisnik said the Serb side has clear evidence that 
UNPROFOR 
provided help in arming the Muslims and that it is biased in 
favor of the Muslims. 
  "The bombing by the U.S. planes was further proof that 
UNPROFOR is not impartial in the civil war in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina", Krajisnik said. 
  "We cannot solve problems partially and establish peace in 
the areas where the Muslims are suffering military defeats. We 
said this to General Michael Rose on three occasions yesterday 
and asked him to use his influence with the Muslims so that we 
can achieve peace in Gorazde." 
  The Serb side, according to Krajisnik, agreed to have 
Gorazde 
defined as a protected zone and to find a way to define its 
borders, but the Muslim side has rejected such proposals.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (TANJUG) -- Assembly President of 
the Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) Momcilo Krajisnik on Monday 
said the renewed air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions on 
Monday were a disastrous move on the part of the United Nations, 
which he said had greatly exceeded its authority and assigned 
NATO the task out of a wish to aid the Bosnian Muslims in their 
offensive in the area of Gorazde. 
  "We had proposed that the war stop on all of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina territory, but the proposal was not upheld by 
either the Muslims or the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), but, 
quite the contrary, the Muslim offensive was tolerated and 
(Bosnian) Serb positions were air raided," Krajisnik said on 
Belgrade's Politika TV. 
  The Muslim side in late March launched a strong offensive on 
Bosnian Serb positions from Gorazde, a Muslim enclave which 
should have been demilitarized last spring as a U.N.-proclaimed 
"safe area." around 10,000 Muslim troops were massed for the 
offensive. 
  Krajisnik said that the Serb side countered the Muslim 
offensive because it was provoked and because the Muslims used 
the "safe area," which has not territorially been defined, "as a 
source of war" in eastern Bosnia. 
  The R.S. assembly president said that UNPROFOR had for no 
reason at all violated the U.N. charter and its mandate in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina, and instead of censuring the Muslims had 
"completely sided with the Serb enemies." 
  Krajisnik said that the R.S. leadership was following the 
situation and that it had requested of the United Nations to say 
who had ordered the air strikes. 
  Krajisnik said that the R.S. leadership would decide on its 
further action and contacts with UNPROFOR, which he said had 
been frozen for the time being, only upon receiving an answer 
from the United Nations.

  [Text] Obrenovac, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, the 
president of the Srpska republic assembly, said today that the 
bombing of Gorazde was a great blow to peace, which was within 
reach. 
  We are not ruling out fresh strikes, but if there are any, 
we 
will take certain political and military steps, Krajisnik said. 
  However, we cannot abandon Gorazde because before the war 35 
percent of its residents were Serbs. We cannot watch and do 
nothing while the Muslims are constantly mounting provocations 
from all three protected areas. This is what happened this time 
as well. The world should know that this area will never be calm 
unless the causes of the conflict are removed; and they lie in 
the Muslim violations of the agreement on protected areas. 
  Answering a question by a Radio Obrenovac [in Serbia] 
journalist, of whether yesterday's events will influence 
diplomatic activity and postpone the negotiations, Krajisnik 
said: We cannot remain indifferent to what the Muslims are 
trying to do, but despite everything, we have not closed the 
door on negotiations and on establishing peace.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (TANJUG) -- The general staff of 
the Bosnian Serb Republic Army reported Monday that its 
artillery "was not shelling Gorazde at all and that therefore 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops, representatives of 
humanitarian organizations or the civilian population cannot be 
in danger there". 
  "The Moslem war propaganda is hastily launching new fraud 
from Gorazde, calculated to call for and justify the engagement 
of the NATO airforce against the Serb people and army. It seems 
as if some senior UNPROFOR officers and officials have joined in 
the Moslem propaganda deceptions", the statement given to TANJUG 
says. 
  NATO U.S. warplanes on Sunday evening launched air strikes 
on 
Bosnian Serb positions near the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, a 
U.N.-designated "safe haven" which should have been 
demilitarized last spring. In late March, about 10,000 Moslems 
from Gorazde surged into a heavy offensive against Serb 
territories. 
  Moslem fabrications about attacks on Gorazde fuel hasty 
decisions on the use of force by the NATO aviation and 
contribute to the escalation of war. This prevents and 
postpones a lasting and complete cessation of hostilities and 
the reaching of an agreement on lasting peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement says.

during the night and this morning, unfortunately, the Serbs 
resumed their advance, they resumed their thrust toward the 
town, and they jeopardized the safety of our staff once again. 
This is what led General Rose to call for the agreement to air 
strikes. This took place at 1407. The planes launched the 
attack at 1419. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sarajevo, 12 Apr (TANJUG)--One of the two "F-18" 
planes attacking Serb positions around Gorazde yesterday bombed 
the town center by mistake, it has been learned from a radio 
message sent by a UN monitor to the pilot, which was intercepted 
at a radar base in neighboring Yugoslavia, SRNA reported early 
this morning. This caused panic among the people of Gorazde and 
Muslim soldiers who began to flee toward the surrounding hills. 
  Several inhabitants of Gorazde who made it to Serb positions 
said that the explosion of a bomb caused a horrific scene, large 
number of casualties and huge material damages.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 12 (TANJUG) -- One of the two U.S. 
F-18s which attacked Serb positions near Gorazde on Monday 
bombed the centre of the city by mistake killing a large number 
of civilians, says SRNA, the news agency of the Bosnian Serb 
Republic. 
  SRNA cites a radio message sent by a U.N. observer in 
Gorazde 
to the pilot of the aircraft and adds that this was also 
confirmed by several citizens of Gorazde who managed to reach 
the Serb positions. 
  According to SRNA, the blast killed many civilians and 
caused 
considerable material damage. 
  Moslem Sarajevo Radio on Monday evening said that the Serb 
shelling left 160 people wounded and 62 dead. 
  U.S. NATO-assigned warplanes on Sunday and Monday launched 
air strikes on Serb positions close to Gorazde, Moslem enclave 
in southeast Bosnia-Herzegovina. The number of victims is as 
yet unknown. 
  Bosnian Serb Republic Vice-President Biljana Plavsic said on 
Monday that the victims were Serb civilians and that Serb 
children had been bombed by sophisticated laser technology. 
  The United Nations months ago ruled Gorazde a safe area, 
together with five other zones in Bosnia. Although it was set 
to be demilitarized, this city served as a starting point of a 
major 10,000-strong Moslem offensive against the Serbs. 
  According to U.N. reports, the Gorazde battles were provoked 
by the Moslems.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- At least 10 prisoners 
of Serb nationality who have been detained in a silo in Tarcin, 
30 km southwest of Sarajevo, for nearly two years were killed 
last night when refugees from Gorazde broke into the prison, 
which is under the control of the Muslim authorities. 
  Serb intelligence sources say that Muslim refugees from 
Gorazde, who are living in Tarcin and the nearby village of 
Pazaric, had held the silo under blockade since Friday. The 
refugees demanded the lynching of the detained Serbs. 
  The Muslim police had the situation under control until 
Sunday evening when the mob broke into the prison and killed at 
least 10 Serbs, using firearms and other objects. 
  Muslim Sarajevo radio confirmed that the incident had 
happened, saying that shooting had been heard amid a totally 
chaotic situation, after which -- according to the radio -- 
three prisoners were missing. 
  The radio reporter says that it is assumed that there had 
been some casualties, but does not give the figure. 
  Nothing is known about the fate of the survivors of the 
massacre, but Muslim sources claim that the police again took 
control of the silo-prison. 
  The Serb side has been trying for 18 months now to organize 
the release of over 200 prisoners from the silo on the principle 
"all for all" with the Muslim authorities, and with the help of 
international humanitarian organizations, but the Muslim 
authorities have rejected all attempts to exchange prisoners.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (TANJUG) -- The vice-president of 
the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.), Biljana Plavsic, on Monday 
said the attacks by NATO planes near the eastern Bosnian Moslem 
enclave of Gorazde had killed Serb civilians and that the 
"bombing of Serb children used sophisticated laser technology". 
  At a protest rally organized outside the U.S. Embassy 
building in Belgrade by the independent anti-racial association 
"White Rose", Plavsic said that at the time when Serbs were 
offering lasting peace, the United Nations, instead of sending 
observers to Gorazde, sent experts for the guiding of missiles. 
  The R.S. vice-president said a toll of the NATO air strikes 
is yet unknown, but the R.S. leadership is on the ground. 
  She said it was quite certain that civilians had been killed 
because she said bombs had been dropped deep in the R.S. 
territory -- on the populated areas. 
  She said Bosnian Serbs had broken off all contacts with U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR). 
  "Nothing is as it had been before the bombing any longer, 
and 
the Serbian people has a new aggressor before it," she said. 
  Plavsic announced that further steps to be taken by the Serb 
side would be decided on Tuesday, at a meeting of the R.S. 
supreme command. 
  The vice-president of the "White Rose" association, writer 
Radomir Smiljanic said the air strikes on Serbs had eventually 
unmasked the United Nations, NATO and the Western powers. 
  By the NATO move yesterday, peace has been undermined, and 
the world community has sided with one of the parties to the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Moslems, he said. 
  The protest was held in front of the U.S. Embassy in 
Belgrade, in connection with U.S. NATO planes' air strikes on 
Serb positions near the eastern enclave of Gorazde, which were 
carried out on Sunday at the request of UNPROFOR. 
  Although Gorazde should have been demilitarized last spring, 
as one of the six Moslem safe areas, it was used as a 
starting-point of attacks of 10,000 Moslem troops on Serb 
positions around the town. 
  According to UNPROFOR reports, the fighting around Gorazde 
has been provoked by the Moslems. According to Serb military 
sources, the Moslem authorities in Sarajevo want to capture more 
territory before the resumption of the peace talks mediated by 
the international community.

  [Text] Cajnice, 12 Apr (TANJUG) -- The details of events on 
the Gorazde battlefield following the U.S. bombing raids on 
civilian targets and positions of the Bosnian Serb Herzegovina 
Corps have finally been revealed, the TANJUG correspondent from 
Cajnice, south of Gorazde, reports. 
  According to the command of the Herzegovina Corps, the 
second 
NATO attack at about 1445 yesterday [11 April] took place in the 
area of the Serb village of Bare, 2 km from Gorazde. 
  However, ambulance cars belonging to the Serb forces were 
hit 
instead of Srpska republic army tanks, as NATO representatives 
claimed. 
  Two paramedics from Gacko [Serb-held town south of Gorazde] 
were killed on this occasion and two ambulance cars were 
completely destroyed. Two Serb houses were also completely 
destroyed. Their inhabitants had fled the Muslim attacks almost 
two years ago. 
  The Americans fired missiles and dropped bombs of great 
destructive power on Serb positions. This is illustrated by the 
fact that one of the missiles broke through three 20 
centimeter-thick concrete floors. 
  According to Serb sources, everything was most probably 
carried out in agreement with the Muslim side -- immediately 
before the bombing raid yesterday thick black smoke rose from 
chimneys of houses in Gorazde. In this way the Muslims were 
marking the no-target zone for the Americans. 
  Simultaneously with the attack of the American planes, the 
Muslim forces launched an infantry attack on Serb positions from 
Gorazde, with strong support from recoilless guns, mortars, 
antiaircraft guns, and multiple rocket launchers. 
  Where did the Muslims from Gorazde, a UN safe area, get all 
the weapons and ammunition? That is what only they and the NATO 
representatives know. However, they were not able to move the 
Serb positions. 
  Details of the U.S. attack in the Mount Preljuca area two 
days ago have also been revealed. This area is 15 kilometers 
from Gorazde and it is a part of the [Serb-held] Foca 
municipality. 
  It is logical to ask: How did the Americans want to protect 
UN military observers in Gorazde by bombing positions so far 
away? 
  As long as one can remember, Preljuca has always been a Serb 
territory, and a year ago the Muslims committed a horrific crime 
in the village of Crnetici just beneath Preljuca, killing more 
than 20 civilians, including two infants. The U.S. planes have 
carried on the job.

  [Excerpts] Cajnice, 12 Apr (TANJUG) -- According to the 
command of the Bosnian Serb Herzegovina Corps, a paramedic team 
was hit in the American bombing raid on civilian targets and 
positions of Herzegovina Corps soldiers yesterday instead of 
tanks, as NATO representatives claimed. 
  Milomir Ceranic and Radomir Maljevic, paramedics from Gacko, 
were killed on this occasion. Two houses in the Serb village of 
Bare, two km south of the Gorazde town center on the right bank 
of the Drina river, were also destroyed. [passage omitted] 
  No one was killed in the attack launched by American planes 
on Preljuca [15 km south of Gorazde] but one passenger car was 
destroyed. Serb forces' tanks were not hit in this attack 
either, contrary to claims by NATO representatives. [passage

<F P=106> [Scepan Aleksic report from Cajnice] </F>
  [Text] Finally, all the pieces of the mosaic of events on 
the Gorazde battlefield linked to the U.S. bombing of civlian 
targets and positions of the Herzegovina Corps have been put 
together. 
  Yesterday, at approximately 1445, the attack was repeated in 
the region of the Serbian village of Bare, which is 2 km from 
Gorazde, the command of the Herzegovina Corps has confirmed. 
However, it was not the tanks of the Srpska republic army that 
were hit, as NATO representatives claim, but ambulance vehicles 
of the Serbian forces. On that occasion two paramedics from 
Gacko were killed, while two ambulance vehicles were competely 
destroyed. 
  Two Serbian homes, whose residents had fled from the Muslim 
onslaught nearly two years ago, were razed. The Americans fired 
rockets of the biggest caliber and dropped bombs of enormous 
weight. This conclusion is implied by the information that one 
of the rockets penetrated three 20-centimeter thick concrete 
plates. All this was most probably done in agreement with the 
Muslim side, as thick black smoke was rising from the houses in 
Gorazde directly prior to yesterday's bombing. In this way the 
Muslims marked the zone which the Americans should not pound. 
  At the same time as the attack of the U.S. aircraft, an 
infantry attack of the Muslim formations from Gorazde at the 
Serbian positions started, supported substantially by recoilless 
guns, mortars, antiaircraft guns, and rocket launchers. Where 
the Muslims in Gorazde, which is a UN protected area, obtained 
all these arms and ammunition from, only they and NATO 
representatives know. However, they did not succeed in moving 
the Serbian positions. 
  The details of the U.S. atttack in the region of Preljuca 
the 
day before yesterday are also known. That area is 15 km from 
Gorazde and is situated on the territory of Foca Commune. A 
logical question arises here: By bombing positions so distant, 
how were the Americans trying to protect the UN military 
observers in Gorazde. Preljuca has been Serbian territory since 
time immemorial, and precisely in the village of Crnetici, 
directly underneath it, the Muslims committed a terrible crime a 
year ago, killing more than 20 civilians, among whom were two 
preschool children. The American aircraft will most probably 
finish off their job, so it seems.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 12 (AFP) -- The Moslem enclave of 
Gorazde, eastern Bosnia, was hit by seven shells early Tuesday 
morning, UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] spokeswoman 
Lyndall Sachs said in Belgrade. 
  The situation, however, was "relatively calm" after Monday's 
second air raid by NATO forces against Serb positions around the 
enclave, she said. Regular bursts of small arms fire could be 
heard, she added. 
  She was reporting information received from United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Gorazde. 
  Spokesman in Belgrade for Doctors Without Borders [Medecins 
sans Frontieres], Eric Stobbaerts, also said he had been told 
the situation in Gorazde was calm Tuesday morning, although 
isolated bursts of gunfire could be heard in the enclave. 
  He commented after speaking with the organisation's team of 
doctors in Gorazde. 
  "Overnight Monday, 34 more people were injured, four of whom 
died," Stobbaerts said. 
  Speaking in Sarajevo Tuesday, United Nations Protection 
Force 
(UNPROFOR) spokesman Major Rob Annink said the situation in 
Gorazde remained serious. 
  The Bosnian Serbs had "closed up to the River Drina" all 
along the southwest of the enclave Monday, he said, and were 
trying to push southward from the north, coming close to Bosnian 
Army positions. 
  Major Roy Thomas, senior military observer in Sarajevo, 
said, 
meanwhile, that UNPROFOR was trying, via contacts with the 
Bosnian Serb army, to gain contact with a Dutch military 
observer and his Serb interpreter who have been missing since 
they left the mainly Moslem encalve of Zepa, northeast of 
Gorazde, Monday morning. 
  The observer was on a routine administrative patrol, Thomas 
said. He and his interpreter passed through a Serb checkpoint 
out of Zepa and were last heard of at 9:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) 
Monday.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic by </F>
announcer Peter Snow; Snow in London studio, Silajdzic in 
Sarajevo; from the "Newsnight" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Snow] Mr. Silajdzic, what do you hear about the 
situation around Goradze tonight? Is it quiet? 
  [Silajdzic] Yes, I spoke with them at 10 tonight -- our time 
tonight -- and they said that actually the attacks on Goradze 
intensified after the air strikes. Now it's rather quiet, but 
I'm afraid that those people are looking for a very difficult 
and tense night tonight and God knows only what happens tomorrow. 
  [Snow] But it is your judgment that the air strikes may have 
been enough and may now have done the trick and stopped the Serb 
attack on Goradze? 
  [Silajdzic] The air strikes were too late, too limited to 
impress the Serbs. They obviously were not impressed for they 
intensified, as I said, their attacks on Goradze today. 
Twenty-five people died after the air strikes, and I must say 
that torture of Goradze people must stop. Either by the UN and 
Nato action, or by lifting the arms embargo for the Bosnian's so 
as we can defend ourselves. 
  [Snow] Now how about the Russian Foreign Ministry's 
suggestion today that UN peacekeepers now going, if General Rose 
can find the peacekeepers to go in there, go into Goradze and 
disarm both sides, the Serbs and your own soldiers, Bosnian 
government soldiers, in Goradze? 
  [Silajdzic] Well that's disarming the victim. So the Serbs 
who were attacking Goradze for 15 days, attacking the safe zone, 
attacking civilian areas, attacking the UNPROFOR base, and now 
they should be disarmed together with their victims. And I 
heard on the news that Russian Minister Kozyrev said that this 
was a dreadful mistake. So the 15 days of killing civilians is 
not a mistake. Don't human lives mean anything anymore? So, 
the Serbs will have to withdraw to the exclusion zone lines in 
order for the peace negotiations to be continued. 
  [Snow] Well now, that's what the Americans appear to be 
saying as well. If the Serbs do now relax their pressure, if 
they do now stop, and if they are ready for ceasefire talks, are 
you ready to do that too? 
  [Silajdzic] Well, as soon as they withdraw, because they 
attacked the safe zone, as soon as they withdraw behind the 
exclusion zone lines to be established by the Security Council, 
of course we are ready to talk. The problem was that they were 
saying they were ready to talk and applying the tactics of 
talking and negotiating. We warned General Rose from the very 
beginning that this was their tactics. 
  [Snow] But you will talk Mr. Silajdzic about a ceasefire all 
over Bosnia provided this attack on Goradze stops? Is that 
right, you will do that? 
  [Silajdzic] I'm sorry, will you repeat the question? 
  [Snow] You are prepared to sit down and talk with the Serbs 
and General Rose about a ceasefire over the whole of Bosnia if 
the pressure on Goradze stops, is that right? 
  [Silajdzic] Not if the pressure on Goradze stops, when they 
withdraw behind the lines of the exclusion zone, that means 20 
kms in the radius around Goradze, then we are ready to sit and 
talk yes. 
  [Snow] Thank you very much, Mr. Silajdzic.

  [Text] A delegation of the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees [UNHCR], comprising among it members Sadako Ogata's 
special envoy (Nicholas Morris) and the UNHCR head for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina (Karen Abu Said), today talked to our 
government delegation headed by Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. 
Nedzad Leko reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Leko] Prime Minister Silajdzic said the 
following in talks with the UNHCR delegation: 
  [Silajdzic] We mostly discussed repatriation -- that is, the 
return of refugees. The government considers this to be a 
priority and very difficult task, particularly in view of the 
fact that we do not have defined borders because of the 
situation with the aggressor. The borders of the (?Serbian) 
cantons have not been defined because it is now impossible to 
define them. [sentence as heard] We [words indistinct] on 
territories that are under the control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
legitimate authorities and the areas now controlled by the 
Croatian Defense Council [HVO]. We can attempt to do something 
in these areas, beginning with the easier cases, meaning those 
cases where people can return home -- that is, they have a place 
to return to, but because of transportation or [words 
indistinct] or owing to problems with possible conflicts they 
actually cannot go home. Therefore, we need to facilitate their 
return home to the extent that this is possible. However, we 
need to have a general plan because all these issues are 
mutually very intertwined, this is an entire network of 
problems. If we do not come up with such a plan, we will be 
unable to carry out this task. I repeat that this is a priority 
task, a very complicated and difficult job. 
  [Leko] After the talks, (Nicholas Morris), Sadako Ogata's 
special envoy, made the following statement for correspondents. 
  [(Morris), in English with superimposed translation into 
Serbo-Croatian] The best solution to any problem of refugees 
and displaced persons is voluntary repatriation, which means 
making it possible for them to return to their homes in a safe 
and dignified way. The UNHCR wishes to work closely with the 
Bosnian Government in order to help carry this out. We value 
that we were able to discuss this today with the prime minister. 
As you know, several problems exist, but I believe they can be 
solved so everyone who wishes to do so is given the chance of 
returning [home] as soon as possible. The UNHCR will offer its 
help to the Bosnian Government in returning people to their 
homes. 
  [Leko] In response to a question pertaining to the 
humanitarian situation in Gorazde, (Morris) said: 
  [(Morris)] At the moment, our convoys have no access to 
Gorazde. The last convoy entered Gorazde on 22 March. In the 
past three days we have distributed the last food reserves that 
we had [words indistinct]. This food might last another four to 
five days. We have the possibility of again delivering food 
from the air. This is unsatisfactory, but it is the only 
possible solution. However, owing to the configuration of the 
terrain around Gorazde, the conflicts would have to stop. The 
organization of medical evacuation of victims of the latest 
fighting in Gorazde is an additional problem. At the same time, 
the delivery of medicine to Gorazde is another problem. 
  [Leko] Reporters wanted to know when the air bridge and 
humanitarian aid convoys would be restored. 
  [(Morris)] As far as the air bridge in concerned, we do not 
know the answer to that, but we suppose that if no great 
problems arise today, we hope that the air bridge will be 
reintroduced. As far as the suspension of convoys that pass 
through the territory under the control of the Bosnian Serbs, we 
hope that they will be restored tomorrow or the day after. 
Access to Gorazde is out of our hands. That will have to be 
decided by a political solution of the problem. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (TANJUG) -- Official of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Peter 
Kessler said in Zagreb on Monday that several civilians had been 
hit by snipers in Gorazde overnight, which would mean that Serbs 
have rifles such as the world has never seen, since the nearest 
Serb positions are located 5 km from Gorazde. 
  Kessler, true, did not openly say which side the snipers 
belonged to, but said that all this happened after the NATO air 
strike on Serbs who are surrounding this Muslim enclave in 
eastern Bosnia. He was evidently relying on the intelligence of 
those who hear his statement immediately to conclude that the 
snipers were Serb snipers firing from Serb super rifles. 
  The Serb positions nearest to Gorazde are located at least 5 
km to the south, outside Vitkovici. It therefore follows that 
Serbs have rifles of so far unknown make, because the most 
effective fire-arms currently known to man can hit targets at a 
distance of 3 km at the most. 
  If Serbs did not open sniper fire from Vitkovici, then, for 
instance, they could have done so from their positions in 
Kovaci, 6 km north of Gorazde, or, why not, from Uhotica Hill, 
only 10 km southwest of the town. 
  Perhaps it will even be "discovered" that Bosnian Serbs have 
invented rifles which military experts throughout the world did 
not even dream existed, or perhaps Kessler's statement is aimed 
at preparing the media and providing justification for new 
attacks by NATO -- U.S. warplanes, in fact. 
  Since the U.S. and the U.N. still have not reached final 
agreement on what was the exact reason for bombing Serb 
positions in Bosnia, it could be gathered that the field was now 
being prepared for new attacks, in which event the contradictory 
explanations about the first attack would be quickly forgotten. 
  While British media are carrying a statement by a member of 
British special units within the U.N. Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) in Gorazde, who reported by radiotelephone that the 
U.N. staff had been in danger from the local population, 
Washington keeps repeating that the U.S. planes launched attacks 
following a request from the U.N. staff in Gorazde for 
protection. 
  After all this, it is really not clear why Bosnian Serbs 
were 
bombed on Sunday and Monday, but it is possible that the 
make-believe Serb snipers could provide a suitable excuse for 
NATO's repeated military siding with the Bosnian Muslims.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 12 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs closed 
checkpoints out of Sarajevo and mined access roads leading to 
arms depots guarded by UN troops Monday as tension mounted 
following NATO airstrikes on Serb positions near the Moslem 
enclave of Gorazde. 
  The mines were layed during the day outside at least three 
arms depots where Serbs had earlier placed their heavy weapons 
under UN control. Two depots were located north of the city at 
Vogosca and Radava and one, to the west, near Blazuj, a UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman said. 
  UNPROFOR had suspended all movement of its forces, spokesman 
Rob Annink said. 
  Meanwhile, all checkpoints leading to the city were closed 
and even the head of UNPROFOR, French general Bertrand de 
Lapresle, had to skirt around a Serb-held area to reach Sarajevo 
airport from where he flew to Zagreb. 
  An attempt to organize a meeting between De Lapresle and 
Serb 
commander General Ratko Mladic was called off after Bosnian 
Serbs broke off all contacts with UNPROFOR Sunday night in the 
wake of a first North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air strike 
against their forces outside besieged Gorazde. A second strike 
was carried out Monday. 
  The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Monday 
suspended its air bridge to Sarajevo and a spokeswoman said 
UNHCR would reassess the situation Tuesday before deciding 
whether to resume airlifts of injured Bosnians out of Sarajevo 
to the Italian airforce base at Ancona.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 11 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs closed 
checkpoints out of Sarajevo Monday [11 April], witnesses said, 
as tension mounted in the city following NATO air strikes on 
Serb positions in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde. 
  Some 50 people waited in vain at the Bratstvo-Jedintsvo 
[Brotherhood and Unity] Bridge linking Sarajevo with the 
Serb-controlled Grbavica district but it remained shut, foreign 
photographers reported. 
  Even UN peacekeeping troops were stopped by Serb forces or 
delayed by formalities at the checkpoints, a UN spokesman said. 
  The closure of Serb checkpoints around Sarajevo followed 
Serb 
anger at air strikes Sunday and Monday on their troops' 
positions around besieged Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. 
  Bosnian Serbs overnight broke off all contacts with the UN 
protection force (UNPROFOR), while the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) Monday suspended its air bridge to Sarajevo. 
  A spokeswoman said UNHCR would reassess the situation 
Tuesday 
before deciding whether to resume airlifts of injured Bosnians 
out of Sarajevo to the Italian airforce base at Ancona. 
  The Bratstvo-Jedintsvo bridge out of Sarajevo was opened on 
March 24 under the surveillance of UN protection forces for 
civilians and humanitarian aid transport. 
  The only passable route to Sarajevo airport on Monday was a 
detour through the Dobrinja quarter of town, controlled by 
Moslem-led Bosnian Government forces. 
  An UNPROFOR spokesman said protection forces would wait and 
see how the situation developed in Sarajevo before deciding 
whether to take any action.

  [Text] During this newscast, we have received a statement 
by the [words indistinct] of Information of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Interior Ministry. After the action of the 
NATO planes, carried out on 10 and 11 April against the 
artillery positions of the Serbian aggressor around Gorazde, the 
military police authorities of the so-called Srpska republic in 
Pale have made a decision to block all the access routes to 
Sarajevo and all road communications used by the UN peace forces. 
  By closing the checkpoints, the Serbian aggressor has 
thwarted the free movement of civilians -- stipulated in earlier 
agreements -- over the Brotherhood and Unity Bridge in Sarajevo 
and in the corridor toward Visoko. The Pale-imposed ban on 
movement also applies to all members and vehicles of the UN 
Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] and international humanitarian 
organizations, which annuls and violates all agreements on the 
establishment of special routes for the members of the UN peace 
forces, which in turn directly threatens their basic role and 
narrows the scope of their engagement to the territory under the 
control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. UNPROFOR members 
continue to move freely in these areas. This act of the Serbian 
aggressor implies his readiness to continue with repressive 
measures and threats to the civilian population in Sarajevo, as 
well as in the other Bosnia-Herzegovina towns that, by decision 
of the UN Security Council, have been proclaimed safe havens.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 11 April carries in its 
regular 42-minute newscast the following reports on the fighting 
in the republic. 
  Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports on the situation 
in the area and says that "Buzim, Caute, and other villages in 
the area have again been shelled in the course of the day. 
According to as yet unconfirmed information, several civilians 
were injured and some killed. The defense lines on Grabez, the 
Grmusko-Srbljanksi plateau, and on the Buzim front have been 
under fire all day. In addition to relentless antiaircraft and 
heavy machine gun fire, the forward defense lines were shelled 
several times. The activity is becoming increasingly intense on 
the defense lines on the Buzim front, and the enemy continues to 
regroup and reinforce his positions on Ivanjski Put. Movements 
of the [Serbian] aggressor were sighted today in the area of the 
so-called Serbian autonomous province of Krajina, while reliable 
sources speak of preparations for a new, joint offensive by the 
Kladusa traitors [of Fikret Abdic] and the chetniks on the Bihac 
commune, which should begin around 15 April. The main points of 
attack would be Bugar and Trzacka Rastela, and the (?main 
objective a consolidation) of forces on the Buzim part of the 
front." 
  Mirudin Aldobasic, reporting on the situation in the 7th 
South Operative Group's theater of operations, says that 
"targeted by their [the Serbs'] weaponry were the residential 
areas of the Doboj region -- Matuzici, Mravici, and [name 
indistinct]. In the early afternoon, the aggressor on several 
occasions directed fierce artillery fire at the defense lines of 
the 110th Glorious Croatian Defense Council [HVO] Usora Brigade 
and the 215th Glorious Motorized Doboj-Bosna Brigade. All 
attacks were successfully repelled." 
  Correspondent Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko that "after 
several fierce but unsuccessful attempts at tank and infantry 
breakthroughs carried out on the Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca line and 
in the Vitanovici region, the enemy infiltrated several 
reconnaissance-subversion groups. However, these well-equipped 
Chetnik units fared no better in their attacks on our positions. 
All their attempts were thwarted. It is estimated that 10 
Chetniks were killed in the battles. The free Brcko territory 
has been under fire all day with three people injured. The 
shelling of civilian targets has escalated in the early evening, 
and the Serbian aggressor is concentrating his manpower and 
hardware in front of the defense lines of the 108th Motorized 
Brigade, the 108th Infantry Brigade, and units of the 2d Corps. 
The enemy is evidently preparing an extensive and lengthy 
offensive." 
  Olovo correspondent Amira Salihodzic reports that "the 
shelling that began in the early morning continued into the 
afternoon. Howitzers, guns, tanks, and mortars were active from 
almost all the Chetnik strongholds. Our defense lines in the 
area of (?Batici) suffered a fierce artillery and infantry 
attack." 
  The studio announcer reads a report from the 1st Corps Press 
Center saying that "in retribution for the two aircraft over 
Gorazde, the Chetniks in the Sarajevo area [words indistinct]. 
A member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army was wounded by a shot 
fired from Grbavica, while the aggressor from the (?Bosuce) 
barracks in the Vis area and Batici also fired at the defense 
lines and the city itself." 
  Mostar correspondent Omer Vatric reports that "as has been 
announced by the Command of the Spanish Battalion [words 
indistinct] of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR], an agreement 
has been reached in Medjugorje between the HVO and the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army on the moving of the city's demarcation 
lines in Mostar. The deployment of units on the new lines has to 
be completed by midnight on 13 April, while the final agreement 
on this should be signed tomorrow [12 April] in Gornji Vakuf. 
The establishment of joint checkpoints and joint police 
patrolling of the [words indistinct] and UNPROFOR on the [words 
indistinct] has also been agreed. [passage indistinct] A new 
exchange of 13 bodies from the western part of Mostar and seven 
from the eastern part has also been carried out, while in the 
HVO prison at the heliport, 225 Bosniak Muslim prisoners are on 
a hunger strike for the fifth day running, protesting that the 
HVO is not implementing the Roso-Delic agreement on the 
disbanding of all camps and prisons."

  [Text] Sarajevo, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- Certain sources and 
media in Italy have used the U.S. planes' attack against the 
Serb territory around Gorazde yesterday to broadcast false 
reports on the wounding, and even the death, of General Ratko 
Mladic, commander of the main headquarters of the Srpska 
republic army. 
  TANJUG's reporter in Sarajevo spoke on the phone with 
General 
Mladic this morning, a fact that completely denies the 
disinformation of the Italian media. At the same time, this 
reveals the truth that all forms of special war are being waged 
against the Serb nation and the Srpska republic. Such alleged 
information aims at causing panic among members of the Srpska 
republic army and destabilizing the overall situation in the 
Srpska republic.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Sabic: "Rich and Untaxed"] </F>
  [Text] Two years have passed since the economy of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, which had fallen into deep trouble even before 
the war broke out, was in a position to guarantee even the most 
necessary financial minimum for operation of the government in 
that portion of Bosnia-Herzegovina under Muslim control. Even if 
the costs of that government are reduced exclusively to 
diplomatic activity, that is, to the participation of Muslim 
delegations in peace negotiations, tours of friendly countries, 
and covering the expenses of diplomatic missions and missions to 
international organizations. 
  From what sources, then, are all those expenditures 
financed; 
in particular, what are the sources of funds to cover 
expenditures for the armed forces and to care for the large 
number of refugees, which are certainly considerably greater? 
What is more, in Bosnia-Herzegovina they are even thinking about 
introducing the most recent technologies in certain segments of 
the economy and public communications. Hajrudin Suman, general 
director of the PTT of Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example, has 
announced the introduction of a mobile telephone network in 
Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Zenica, and he announced that the Motorola 
company was one possible supplier of equipment. Where is the 
money coming from to "cover" all that? 
  At the beginning of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Libya 
furnished aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina in the amount of $50 
million. That amount had been fixed during an earlier visit of 
Alija Izetbegovic to Tripoli. After that, other Islamic 
countries sent financial aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina, but these 
were always considerably smaller amounts intended for the care 
of people threatened by the Serbian aggression, and the donors 
decided considerably more frequently to send aid in the form of 
food, clothing, and medicine. In mid-June 1992 the Kuwaiti 
agency KUNA reported that that country's government had decided 
to make a donation of $3.1 million to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and at 
approximately the same time Saudi Prince Fahet set aside $8 
million. 
<H5>  Izetbegovic's Reproach </H5>
  However, all that is insufficient to cover regular costs, 
and 
even less would the Muslim leadership be able to acquire 
armament and equipment for its military units on the basis of 
such amounts of aid. During last year's visit to Riyadh, 
arranged so that he might accept the award of Saudi King Faisal 
for his contribution to Islam, Alija Izetbegovic reproached the 
Islamic countries for furnishing insufficient aid to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and said that "several Islamic countries had 
not fulfilled their obligations" within the Organization of the 
Islamic Conference (OIC), but he expressed confidence that "with 
the help of the Islamic countries, the war will not be lost." On 
that occasion an official figure was presented to the effect 
that aid in the amount of $53 million had been obtained since 
the beginning of the war. 
  Unofficial estimates have indicated considerably larger 
amounts spent to care for the refugees, but also to purchase 
weapons and other military equipment. At that time, of course, 
before the general Croat-Muslim conflict broke out, there was no 
great difficulty with the illegal advancement of arms into 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. But there is no doubt whatsoever that the 
purchases, and accordingly the payments for them, have occurred 
later as well. They are of course difficult to prove, and it is 
especially difficult to show that sizable quantities have been 
purchased, although it is clear that otherwise the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina would not have been able to achieve certain 
military successes. 
  In late January DER SPIEGEL wrote that $15 million for arms 
purchases had come in from certain Bosnian representative 
offices abroad. The same authors said the money had in fact been 
spent for the purposes planned, that the MOS [Ministry of the 
Armed Forces] had purchased six transport helicopters in Russia 
and two light scout planes in France. According to reports that 
cannot be described as completely reliable, Muslim armed units 
have been furnished with arms and equipment purchased in Great 
Britain, Italy, Switzerland, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Armenia, 
Lebanon, and Serbia, and one journalist from the German 
television station ZDF said on his return to Germany that he had 
seen Iranian-made ammunition in Sarajevo. 
  The German weekly FOCUS wrote recently that in 1993 the 
Izetbegovic government received $250 million from the Islamic 
Conference; the donors were allegedly Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Saudi 
Arabia, and Iran, along with Islamic humanitarian organizations 
in Europe. According to the same source, Islamic organizations 
in Great Britain collected $20 million, and certain arms 
deliveries from Serbia were "covered" with a delivery of oil 
from Iran and Libya, with Greece and Romania serving as 
intermediaries. 
<H5>  "Local Tax" Collected at the Market </H5>
  "Oil is the weapon of the Islamic countries" is a sentence 
uttered frequently. There was a time when one heard it in the 
context of announcement of pressure on the Western countries to 
remove the embargo from delivery of weapons to the Bosnian 
Muslims, and on the eve of one meeting of the member-countries 
of the Islamic Conference it was uttered even by Hikmet Cetkin, 
Turkish foreign minister, but the threat was never carried out. 
If we ask ourselves why, the most logical answer is because it 
is in the interest of the Islamic countries to sell their oil, 
but there are also other possibilities. For example, an 
agreement that would go like this: we supply you oil, you give 
us a free hand in providing aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Certainly all the expenditures of the government in Sarajevo 
cannot be reduced to covering the costs of caring for the 
refugees and purchasing armament and military equipment. The 
government must also have certain amounts to meet other 
expenditures. From what informed sources say, the donors are 
once again the Islamic countries and organizations, and the 
money is being paid into private accounts abroad or literally 
carried into Bosnia-Herzegovina in cash. Volunteers from the 
Islamic countries are said to have brought in rather large 
amounts in hard currency when they arrived in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Certain officials of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] in 
central Bosnia say that before the war groups of foreign 
citizens were crossing their territory and large amounts were 
discovered when they were searched. As for private accounts 
abroad, it is assumed that the largest are owned by Alija 
Izetbegovic, Haris Silajdzic, and Ejup Ganic. It cannot be said 
that the funds are paid into the private accounts exclusively in 
order to obtain personal benefits under circumstances favorable 
to that practice, but rather there is also an effort to leave 
the government accounts empty. This gets around the possibility 
of someone tracing the purchases of military supplies, and at 
that same time it avoids the possibility of those funds being 
included in the amount that would figure in the succession, 
assuming of course that it ever occurs. 
  Nevertheless, the Turkish newspaper SABAH recently published 
an article stating that the Turks have found fault with the 
leadership of Bosnia-Herzegovina for having used the immense 
financial aid for its own purposes. Under the present 
circumstances it is of course difficult to distinguish precisely 
between personal and general needs, and it is still more 
difficult to ascertain the amounts that pass through accounts 
and through the hands of particular officials. Especially since 
many tales have been woven in this connection. According to one 
of those tales, just one Turk from Bosnia, a member of a company 
of several hundred people who reached Turkey following the 
Austrian occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1878, made a money 
contribution sufficient to equip the entire building of the 
embassy of Bosnia-Herzegovina when it was opened in Turkey. 
  The Muslim government has taken certain steps to procure on 
its own some of the funds necessary to cover the war budget. A 
law was passed requiring citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina working 
abroad temporarily to pay a portion of their earnings as their 
contribution to the defense of Bosnia-Herzegovina, something is 
probably also "earned" by issuing (expensive) Bosnian passports 
and other documents in diplomatic missions abroad, and certain 
amounts, it is difficult to determine how large, are obtained 
through one kind of legal smuggling. 
  That is, there is "warranted suspicion" that consumer goods 
reaching government warehouses in one way or another are going 
onto the market and being sold at black-market prices. It is 
known for sure that last year this was the method used in 
selling off a certain quantity of vegetables which the 
government of Bosnia-Herzegovina, through the mediation of 
certain international organizations, had sent to Sarajevo from 
Serbia, so that citizens of Sarajevo buying those vegetables 
with no knowledge of that were paying a kind of local tax. 
  The war budget of Bosnia-Herzegovina is obviously so 
complicated that probably no one has a complete picture of it, 
that is, of all the sources of funds and all the purposes they 
are spent for. The only thing that seems to be certain is that 
there are large holes in the budget.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (AFP) -- Russia's special envoy 
to ex-Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin criticized the United Nations 
Monday for launching air strikes against Serb positions in 
Gorazde saying that the international community had embarked on 
a "slippery slope" in Bosnia. 
  "We are very much concerned that maybe we are on a slippery 
slope in terms of international involvement in this fighting 
area, and our main effort now will be directed at making sure 
that this tragic experience of Gorazde is not going to be 
repeated," Churkin told reporters here after holding a two-hour 
meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. 
  He said Milosevic had asked him to try "to help find a way 
out of this situation" which has been rendered more difficult by 
the Bosnian Serb decision to break all contact with the UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR). 
  Churkin said he believed Russia could play an important role 
in relaunching the peace process which would be aimed at finding 
a "firm and lasting cessation of hostilities." 
  He said Russia was not pleased at the "level of 
communication 
in this very tense moment," apparently referring to the UN 
decision to launch the air strikes without consulting with 
Russia first. 
  "I believe that if Russia was involved in a much closer way 
in this conflict area, maybe some of the developments may have 
been prevented," he said. 
  Churkin was to travel to the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale 
later Monday to meet with military leader Radovan Karadzic. The 
latter earlier cancelled a meeting with U.S. special envoy to 
ex-Yugoslavia Charles Redman.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav </F>
Jovanovic by Dragan Colovic in Belgrade on 11 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Colovic] Minister Jovanovic, last night and again 
this afternoon, Serb positions around Gorazde were bombed by the 
NATO air force under the auspices of the international 
organization. This event is in the center of attention now. We 
would like your comments on this event? 
  [Jovanovic] As the Federal Government has already said in 
its statement, we deeply regret this act of the international 
organization, which used NATO to legitimize an act of aggression 
against the Serbian people and to carry out air strikes on the 
territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina close to our borders. 
The international organization has significantly compromised 
itself with this act and [words indistinct] for continuing the 
role of peacekeeper and impartial arbiter in the otherwise 
complex and contradictory Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. 
  We are deeply concerned about this irresponsible and risky 
act, which borders on a military adventure because it actually 
marks the crossing of the Rubicon, after which nothing is clear 
any longer and nothing can be foreseen with any degree of 
certainty. We believe that those who have made this decision 
will soon realize their mistake and will withdraw the decision 
on the further engagement of NATO air power. For us, this act 
presents not only a threat to the peace process and a hindrance 
to the negotiations that should lead to the signing of an 
agreement on the absolute cessation of all hostilities, but also 
a new, very dangerous escalation whose consequences cannot in 
practice be entirely calculated and for which the international 
organization has taken all the responsibility. On the other 
hand, Gorazde has been taken as a reason and excuse for the 
engagement of NATO military forces, while at the same time, 
nothing is said as to why in this so-called safe haven Muslim 
forces still have not been demilitarized, and why Gorazde, as a 
zone, has been used as a [word indistinct] for the beginning of 
a massive military offensive by the east Bosnian corps against 
the Serbs in a number of places, and not only in the immediate 
vicinity of Gorazde. 
  Therefore, if anyone has violated the provisions of the 
agreement and the resolution on safe havens, and certain 
provisions of the [UN] Charter, then it is precisely those who 
have called upon NATO to act. Therefore, no one can deny that 
with this act, NATO and the international organization have 
interfered in the civil war on one side and against the Serb 
side. All this greatly complicates the situation and makes it 
difficult to maintain the peace process and revive it with 
greater chances of ending the war and reaching a lasting 
political solution. 
  [Colovic] Yes. Mr. Jovanovic, I would like to ask you one 
thing. What do you expect of other international factors that 
have not been consulted on all of this -- I have Russia 
primarily in mind. President Yeltsin's statement implies that 
the UN Security Council was not even consulted on all of this? 
  [Jovanovic] Not only was it not consulted, it was 
circumvented. Certain provisions of a certain resolution were 
applied here that allegedly authorize the secretary general and 
other high officials of the international organization in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to make the decision to use NATO forces on 
the spot. This is only one of the many interpretations possible, 
and whenever you have the possibility of diverse 
interpretations, it means that the one that has been highlighted 
is not enough to warrant making such an important decision. 
[sentence as heard] As far as I know, Russia objected to the 
NATO ultimatum [on Sarajevo] for precisely the same reasons, and 
I take President Yeltsin's statement as a continuation of 
Russia's dissatisfaction that the Security Council has been 
circumvented, and in this way, the voice and opinion of Russia 
as a great European and world power that has historical and 
other interests in its Balkan neighborhood. 
  On the other hand, with these hazardous actions, the world 
organization itself has rather facilely become an instrument for 
the realization of aims and interests of the individual great 
powers and a group of countries, which is also a dangerous 
precedent as this could be repeated tomorrow in some other 
situation and in other places. Therefore, it is time for the 
international community, above all the smaller and medium-sized 
countries, seriously to study this problem and ask themselves 
where the international community is heading and what such 
irresponsible behavior means from an organization whose main aim 
is to preserve peace and security, that is, to carry out a 
peace-making role, and not expand military activities and 
escalate a civil war that threatens to assume the proportions of 
a wider-scale confrontation. Therefore, we want to believe that 
reason will nevertheless prevail in the minds of those who so 
irresponsibly headed into an adventure, and that they will also 
realize that peace cannot be reached through war, but through 
peace, and particularly through stopping any kind of war. 
Therefore we support the demands by the Bosnian Serbs, as well 
as all other people who advocate an immediate, unconditional, 
and lasting end to all hostilities throughout the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is the only way to start finding a 
political solution to the crisis on the basis of equal respect 
for the legitimate interests and rights of all three constituent 
peoples. This is the only alternative to this gloomy 
development, which gathered speed with yesterday's and 
(?today's) military attacks on Serb positions and Serb-populated 
places in this part of Bosnia-Herzegovina, because the 
alternative to peace that I am speaking about is a continuation 
of war, which nobody can consider a joyful prospect and nobody 
can profit from, not even these who crossed the Rubicon when 
they decided in favor of this adventure. 
  [Colovic] Yes. What are your expectations in the coming 
hours and days? 
  [Jovanovic] Despite all the dramatic events, one must retain 
both presence of mind and a cool head. After all, these air 
strikes, as much as their form and gesture denote an act of 
aggression, are nevertheless virtually limited to a few NATO 
aircraft that appear and carry out the destruction and killing 
of civilians of Serbian nationality. This shows that at this 
moment, the tactic of pressure is dominant in the other side's 
thinking. On the other hand, there is the presence of Mr. 
Churkin, special envoy to President Yeltsin, who has visited 
Belgrade today and has already gone to Pale, where he will try 
to repeat his role of a useful bridge between the opposing sides 
with a view to overcoming this tense situation as well. 
Finally, in this civil war, everybody can do much evil to 
others, but nobody can do I do not know how much evil and 
thereby benefit from it himself. These advocates of war in 
Sarajevo on the East River and in Brussels are finally going to 
realize that because, after all, any policy is carried out with 
a view to benefiting from it, and not exclusively to doing harm 
to the other side. 
  [Colovic] You mentioned Mr. Churkin, who is visiting Pale 
and who will be talking about this with Serb republic officials. 
We would like to hear from you what the Government of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will offer in this direction, in 
the direction of peace. 
  [Jovanovic] In the announcement that I hope has already been 
issued to the public, we reiterate the consistent policy of 
peace, cooperation, and the political solutions to all disputes, 
including the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On that line we are 
ready to give full support and help to all efforts, wherever 
they may come from, directed to reducing the present tension, to 
ending all the hostilities, and establishing a just and lasting 
peace. This resoluteness of ours has not been abandoned even 
after this latest aggression. On the contrary, it has gained in 
topicality, significance, and strength because it has almost 
turned into a lighthouse in the darkness that has come in the 
wake of this unreasonable decision of the top officials of the 
world organization and NATO to start this adventure. We expect 
Russia and the other countries that kept their political 
presence of mind and rational reasoning about the entire 
situation to make their full contribution and help those people 
who have refused to use their reasoning and view the world with 
realistic eyes more easily to see their mistake and return to 
the only possible line leading to a way out of this crisis, to a 
reduction of tension, an end to hostilities, and a return to 
negotiations as the only means for finding way out of the 
Bosnian crisis. 
  [Colovic] Thank you, Minister Jovanovic. 
  [Jovanovic] Not at all, Mr. Colovic.

<F P=106> [Statement by FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic on </F>
NATO air strikes on Gorazde for "Radio and Television of 
Serbia"; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Apart from representing an act of aggression and 
the siding with one side in the civil war, the latest air 
strikes also represent a new form of direct, unprovoked, and 
provocative pressure not only on the Serbian side in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also on the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia. Together with other forms of pressure that we have 
so far had an opportunity to acquaint ourselves with and to 
feel, this is the biggest and most dangerous straw that 
threatens to break the camel's back. Therefore, those people 
who decided on this kind of military adventure are at the same 
time the side that takes on itself the responsibility for all 
possible consequences, as well as the entire development that 
nobody can say can be completely controlled. In that respect, 
NATO, as well as the United Nations, has simply abandoned the 
impartial role that the situation assigned to them and sided 
with one of the parties to the civil war, that is, with the 
Muslim side. This very much discredits the United Nations and 
the other foreign factors that got deeply involved in such 
military action and called into question their impartiality and 
their ability to continue to carry out peace efforts. The very 
act of aggression on the Serbian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
in itself certainly a great enough provocation for the prospects 
of peace and for us who live on this side of the Drina [River]. 
On the other hand, launching military operations with air power 
in close proximity to our borders always carries the great risk 
of deliberate or accidental mistakes, something that makes the 
entire situation very complex and can lead to uncontrolled 
negative development in the whole region. 
  As regards our resoluteness to defend our own country with 
all means against any foreign enemy and danger, that should not 
be questioned. This would be poor advice to all other factors 
if they took this in a facile way and underestimated our 
resoluteness to defend ourselves.

<F P=106> [Miroslav Lazanski commentary: "Askers in Bosnia"] </F>
  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has 
accepted Turkey's offer to send troops to former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. 
Butrus-Ghali's decision was undoubtedly dictated by the 
problems of providing a new contingent of troops for UNPROFOR in 
Bosnia. The United Nations could not find additional troops 
from other countries, so that the Security Council openly 
stressed that it was forced to accept Ankara's offer. That is 
the excuse by which the United Nations, the Security Council, 
and Butrus-Ghali have tried to justify their action in view of 
all the criticism from throughout the world, and particularly 
from the Balkans, at the Turks being sent to a region where they 
were masters and governors for more than 500 years. The UN 
Security Council's decision, lacking any subtlety of historical 
memory, is becoming more and more the object of serious analysis 
and criticism by many NATO member-states, among which Greece, of 
course, takes the lead. 
  Nevertheless, come what may, some 2,700 Turkish soldiers are 
getting ready to set off for former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Askers 
[Turkish soldiers] are again on the road to Bosnia. How, with 
what, in which way, how capable are they in military terms [as 
published]? From what is known, UNPROFOR intends to deploy 
exclusively engineering units of the Turkish Army in Bosnia, in 
the first place for logistical support, but also for more 
difficult engineering works in order to fix communications. 
Since the task involves activities in the conflict zone, the 
Turkish troops will have to have protection, of course, if the 
war continues. Whether that protection will be given by NATO 
war planes, or their own forces, will be seen very soon, as soon 
as the Turkish troops and their equipment arrive in Bosnia. 
  How capable are the Turkish engineers, and other soldiers, 
of 
carrying out UNPROFOR assignments, given the terrain of former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? The answer lies in the picture of the 
contemporary Turkish army, its equipment and armament, the 
doctrine of its deployment, the concept of development, 
membership in NATO, the historic role of the army in the 
development of modern Turkey.... 
  The second greatest military power in NATO, after the United 
States, is the Turkish Army, numbering some 480,000 soldiers 
(390,000 recruits, service lasts 15 months). In terms of status 
in Turkish society, the army members are an elite class, which 
since 1960 has intervened three times to suppress riots, or 
rather to attain power. It is an army that, until the collapse 
of the Warsaw Pact, policed one third of the border between NATO 
and the former Soviet Union, that is, some 400 kilometers of the 
only direct border with the former Soviet Union, except in 
Norway. That was a task of the 3d Turkish Army, being actually 
the most powerful operational-strategic Turkish armed force. 
  After the demise of the Warsaw Pact, and the disintegration 
of the Soviet Union, Turkey relocated its armies, so that now 
the most powerful 1st Army is concentrated on the border toward 
Greece and the islands in the Aegean. The American military is 
still present in that country, and every year Ankara is given 
great economic and military aid, because of its role on the 
southern wing of NATO. There are 26 large U.S. and NATO military 
bases on Turkish territory, in addition to several dozens of 
smaller military compounds. The most important is certainly the 
great air force base in Incirlik, including warehouses for 
logistical support in (Iskendrun?) and (Yumurtalik?). In that 
base the planes equipped with nuclear weapons are stationed. In 
(Chigly?), near Ismir, there is another U.S. air-force base, 
and, in addition, the U.S. planes are using the airports in 
(Pirinchlic?), Ankara, and (Eshishecher?). The ships of the U.S. 
Navy are using almost all the Turkish ports and shipyards. The 
ships of the U.S. 6th Fleet are anchored very frequently in the 
port of Iskenderun in the Mediterranean. There are very 
important radio-locating [as published] stations in Synop and 
Pyrinchyluk, while 14 Nage [not further specified] stations of 
the NATO anti-aircraft defense system are positioned throughout 
Turkish territory . 
  Being so tightly bound with the NATO and the United States, 
Turkey is trying to overpower the Kurds in the southeast of the 
country, and to obtain a more prominent place on the 
international stage. During the Gulf War against Iraq, Ankara 
allowed the Allies to use Turkish territory -- airports and navy 
ports, as well as the entire border belt toward Iraq itself. 
  Later, Turkey was financially rewarded by the West for its 
support, so it is a state that receives the most military aid 
from NATO. True, some NATO member-states sometimes give their 
outdated arms and equipment to Turkey for free, but still, the 
Turkish Army is today one of the most powerful armies in Europe 
-- 4,835 tanks, 3,000 infantry armored vehicles and 
transporters, 4,550 cannons of various calibers, 1,870 
anti-aircraft cannons, 2,100 mortars. The ground forces have 
their own aviation, numbering 269 aircraft and 538 helicopters, 
the air forces involve 60,000 people and 539 combat aircraft, 
126 of which are F-16's, 137 F-5's, as well as 155 F-4's, while 
the navy numbers 50,000 people, 15 submarines, 11 destroyers, 
eight frigates, 16 missile craft, including its own naval air 
force.... There was a time, 20 years ago, when the Turkish 
armament industry was incapable of manufacturing even a simple 
piston aircraft for amateur flying clubs. Today, Turkey 
manufactures U.S. F-16 fighters, the latest electronics, and 
missiles. 
  As for the engineering equipment, the Turkish soldiers 
deployed within UNPROFOR in Bosnia will have various types of 
engineering vehicles, based on the old M-47 U.S. tanks (German 
version), as well as Bailey pontoons. Since the UNPROFOR units 
are a multinational force, it will be interesting to see how the 
Turkish troops function under the command of foreign officers. 
  All in all, the UN decision, not very wise from the 
political 
point of view, will place the Turkish soldiers in much 
temptation. It seems as though the problem with the Kurds is not 
enough of a problem for Ankara. Or is this all about the old 
dreams of coming back to the Balkans?

  [Text] Belgrade, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- At its session today 
the federal government discussed the situation in the wake of 
the NATO air strike against the territory of the Srpska republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the vicinity of Gorazde. It decided to 
send a delegation of the Yugoslav Government, headed by Vice 
Prime Minister Zeljko Simic, to the Srpska republic where they 
will acquaint themselves with the situation and consequences on 
the spot. 
  The government, as is reported, also decided to send a 
protest note to Italy, because it provided its air bases for the 
aircraft that attacked the Serb territories in 
ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the same time it decided that the 
federal government would send a letter to UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali in which it will point out the facts that indicate 
that the NATO air strike against the territory of the Srpska 
republic was a violation of the UN Charter.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (TANJUG) -- A delegation of the 
Yugoslav Federal Government, headed by Deputy Prime Minister 
Zeljko Simic, will visit the Srpska republic in order to look 
into the consequences of the NATO plane bombardment there. 
  The government brought this decision at an extraordinary 
session Monday [11 April] devoted to the situation following the 
bombardment of the Srpska republic around the town of Gorazde, 
in the east of war-shattered Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The government has also decided to address a protest note to 
Italy for having allowed NATO planes to fly from its airfields 
and a letter to the UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
pointing out that the NATO air attacks on the Srpska republic 
constitute a violation of the U.N charter, it is said in a 
statement issued by the government. 
  At the same session the government has assessed the U.N. 
decision about the engagement of NATO airforces in the 
bombardment of the territory of the Srpska republic as direct 
involvement in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina on the side 
of the Moslems and a dangerous precedent which could have 
far-reaching consequences. 
  The cabinet of Prime Minister Kontic has also conveyed the 
solidarity of all Yugoslav citizens with the Serb people in the 
Srpska republic who are the victims of aggression. 
  The U.N. has brought the decision about the engagement of 
NATO planes at the request of the peacekeepers on the field who 
accused the Serbs of attacking the civilian population in 
Gorazde. 
  According to Serb military sources, however, it was from 
Gorazde that around 10,000 Moslem troops launched an attack on 
Serb positions around the town, which should have been 
demilitarized last spring as a UN-protected area. 
  Reports of the U.N. peackeepers confirm that the combats 
around Gorazde were provoked by the Moslems. According to Serb 
military sources the Moslem offensive is aimed at gaining as 
much territory as possible from the Serbs ahead of the 
continuation of the peace talks conducted under international 
mediation.

    [Editorial Report] The following items on economic 
developments in former Yugoslavia are from the Belgrade daily 
POLITIKA: 
<H5>  Revival of "Srpska Republic" Economy </H5>
  The government of the republic of Srpska [RS], the 
self-proclaimed Serbian state on the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, set up a group of experts "a few days ago" 
to work with counterparts from Serbia in preparing the 
groundwork for linking the economic system of the RS to that of 
Serbia, POLITIKA reports on 18 March. The experts will create a 
"consortium of reputable RS businessmen" who live and work in 
Belgrade. "Again this spring," the daily points out, agriculture 
has priority in revitalizing the economy. A diesel oil allowance 
of 50 liters per hectare is being distributed to RS farmers at a 
price of one German mark per liter. POLITIKA reports that the 
fuel was imported, but that "it is officially not known how it 
came from Italy, whether it came via Croatia, and what the 
arrangements were." "At this moment," the daily reports, 60 to 
70 million dinars would be sufficient to get production moving 
in the RS. Svetislav Mudrenovic, vice president of the RS 
Economic Chamber and president of the Banja Luka Economic 
Chamber, said that in addition to securing the needed funds, 
workforce issues should be resolved, and "specialists" should be 
brought back from the army. Moreover the customs duties between 
the "Serbian lands" [Serbia and RS] should be lifted, Mudrenovic 
said, pointing out that customs fees in Sremska Raca (Serbia) 
and Bosanska Raca [Bosnia] are so high that they are harder to 
endure than the international sanctions. 
<H5>  Protest by "Cheated" Bank Depositors </H5>
  Depositors of the Inos Bank in the Serbian city of Paracin, 
whose owner, Boro Kostic, allegedly defrauded them of their 
savings, have announced a large protest to take place in the 
center of Paracin, the 18 March POLITIKA reports. Although the 
municipal court in Paracin has issued a decision in favor of the 
3,800 complainants against Kostic and the Inos Bank, the 
depositors will be unable to collect their claims. This is 
especially true of people with small deposits of 100 to 500 
German marks, who, if property belonging to Kostic and the Inos 
bank is sold, will be able to collect only about 50 dinars each, 
enough to cover the cost of their court fees, POLITIKA states. 
The paper notes that Kostic, "formerly a producer of window 
blinds," registered houses and businesses he bought in the names 
of relatives, and such properties cannot be confiscated. The 
paper claims that depositors with large accounts were able to 
withdraw their money in time. It is believed that the Inos Bank 
collected about 100 million German marks from "naive" 
depositors, POLITIKA reports. 
<H5>  Bank's Loans To Aid Agriculture </H5>
  The Vrsac (Vojvodina) Bank, a branch of the Beogradska 
(Belgrade) Bank, has purchased 1,000 metric tons of fertilizers 
for the Vrsac wheat-producing agricultural enterprises Elan, 
Panonija, and Agrovrsac, according to the 18 March POLITIKA. The 
daily explains that the Vrsac Bank had paid the Pancevo Azotara 
fertilizer company 360,000 dinars and granted short-term loans 
to the farmers, with payment deferred until the completion of 
the harvest. According to the bank's director, it has approved 
about 700,000 dinars' worth of loans to support the region's 
agriculture and revive its economy. 
<H5>  Karic Bank Loan to Serbian PTT </H5>
  On 8 March, representatives of the Karic Bank signed a 
contract with the Post, Telegraph, and Telephone [PTT] Public 
Enterprise of Serbia on a $13.5 million loan, POLITIKA of 9 
March reports. These funds will be used for the purchase of 
"indispensable components and supplies" for the PTT, thus 
enabling this enterprise to remain technologically at the top of 
the Yugoslav market, POLITIKA states, adding that with this loan 
the Karic Bank continues its "investment cycle" in the Yugoslav 
economy. Karic Bank representatives, according to POLITIKA, 
consider this contract to be among the safest of the bank's 
investments. 
<H5>  New Brewery, Factories </H5>
  A new brewery, Inventing-Roganovic, was inaugurated on 7 
March in Temerin near Novi Sad, Vojvodina. The ceremony was 
attended by federal, republic, and provincial officials, 
including the governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia, Dr. 
Dragoslav Avramovic, reports the 8 March issue of POLITIKA. 
Avramovic praised the brewery's owner, Slobodan Roganovic, 
declaring that "people like Roganovic are our future." POLITIKA 
observes that "during the time of crisis, [Roganovic] decided to 
build three factories." In addition to the brewery, he has just 
finished building Invent Durvin in Temerin, a plant that 
produces and processes polyvinyl chloride, and Invent Poliplast 
in Beocin, which manufactures bathtubs and shower stalls. Before 
the "international blockade," states POLITIKA, Roganovic's 
"Invent" plumbing-fixture factory in Rakovac exported more than 
one-third of its production.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (TANJUG) -- NATO's bombing of 
Serb positions around Gorazde has dispersed the illusion about 
the international community's objecitive stand toward the crisis 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, President of the Yugoslav Republic of 
Serbia Slobodan Milosevic said after meeting with Russian envoy 
Vitaliy Churkin on Monday [11 April], the presidential cabinet 
said in a statement. 
  Milosevic said that the offensive of the Bosnian Moslem army 
had been going on for weeks before the very eyes of the 
international public but that the United Nations had done 
nothing to stop it, apart from a few mild warnings. 
  On the contrary, the Moslem enclave of Gorazde in eastern 
Bosnia was used as a springboard for the offensive on Bosnian 
Serb positions. By launching air strikes, the U.N. evidently 
became involved in the civil war on the Bosnian Moslem side, 
which is highly reprehensible and discredits the world 
organization as a mediator in the peace process, he said. 
  U.S. NATO warplanes on Sunday and Monday bombed Bosnian Serb 
positions around Gorazde, a Moslem enclave which should have 
been demilitarized last spring as one of the six U.N. "safe 
areas." 
  Late in March, around 10,000 Moslems, who had been massed in 
Gorazde for the offensive, launched a strong offensive on Serb 
territories. 
  After breaking the offensive, the Serb army made a strong 
counter-attack and penetrated to a distance of several 
kilometres close to the town. 
  Milosevic said that, in order to surmount the current 
crisis, 
it would be necessary to reach peace without prejudice 
concerning political solutions, rather than to allow an 
escalation of war. When there are no more armed conflicts, 
political negotiations should be brought to an end, he said. 
  The Serbian president supported the resumed talks between 
Knin and Zagreb and expressed satisfaction over the sucessful 
implementation of the ceasefire agreement between the republic 
of Serb Krajina (RSK) and Croatia. 
  The new phase of talks between the two sides, expected to 
focus on normalization of economic ties, in itself touches the 
problem of the sanctions, which are at this moment the biggest 
obstacle to successful talks. 
  Undoubtedly, all factions who care for peace and an end of 
the crisis hope that the talks between Knin and Zagreb would 
result in restored economic and communication ties. However, it 
is impossible to achieve that while one of the sides (Serb) is 
constantly being exposed to sanctions of the international 
community, which make such ties impossible, Milosevic said. 
  The international community and its public will therefore 
face a choice of either supporting a normalization of relations 
and peace or, through the implementation of the sanctions, 
insisting on confrontation. 
  In that case, the sanctions would be the biggest obstacle to 
the peace process and a normalization of relations, Milosevic 
said and added that he expected the forces of peace and 
cooperation to overwhelm the advocators of war and prolonged 
crisis. 
  The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 in the Serb ethnic and 
historical territories within the administrative borders of the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia in response to Croatia's 
violent secession from the former Yugoslav federation and the 
downgrading of the Serbs' status to that of an ethnic minority. 
  In March 1992, the RSK territory was proclaimed a United 
Nations protected area (UNPA). 
  The talks between Milosevic and Churkin were also attended 
by 
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic and Russian 
Ambassador in Belgrade Gennadiy Shikin.

  [Text] Belgrade, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic today received the special envoy of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and held lengthy and open talks with him. 
  According to the cabinet of President Milosevic, the latest 
developments in the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina were discussed, as well as the positive 
developments in the negotiations between Knin and Zagreb. 
  President Milosevic stressed that the bombardment of Serb 
positions around Gorazde had shattered the delusion about the 
international community's unbiased attitude to the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army's 
offensive has been going on for weeks before the eyes of the 
entire world public whereas the United Nations has done nothing 
to stop this offensive except for placid warnings. On the 
contrary, Gorazde as a protected zone has been used as a 
bridgehead for an offensive against the Serb positions. By 
intervening with its air force, the United Nations has 
undoubtedly taken part in the civil war on the side of the 
Muslims, something that should undoubtedly be condemned as it 
seriously dents the reputation of the United Nations in its 
capacity as a mediator in the peace process. In President 
Milosevic's view, in order to overcome the crisis that has 
emerged it is necessary to settle for peace without prejudicing 
a political solution instead of escalating military operations 
and then -- in a situation marked by the absence of armed 
conflicts -- finish political negotiations. 
  As far as the negotiations between Knin and Zagreb are 
concerned -- during the course of which the Russian side played 
an undoubtedly constructive role -- President Milosevic 
expressed support for further negotiations while expressing 
satisfaction with the successful implementation of the agreement 
on the cessation of all hostilities between the army of the 
republic of Serb Krajina and the Croatian Army. President 
Milosevic also stressed that his personal contacts with 
President Martic of Krajina had convinced him of the Krajina 
leadership's constructive attitude and their sincere desire to 
overcome the crisis through negotiations. However, the next 
phase of negotiations that should follow the normalization of 
economic relations raises in itself the problem of sanctions, 
which at the moment poses the largest obstacle to the success of 
the negotiations. 
  It is beyond doubt that all factors interested in peace and 
in ending the crisis want the economic and traffic links between 
Knin and Zagreb to be reestablished through negotiations, but 
that cannot be achieved as long as the international sanctions 
-- which make such links impossible -- are being applied against 
one (Serb) side. This is why the international community and the 
world public will have to face the choice: Either they support 
the normalization of relations and peace, or -- by keeping the 
sanctions -- they insist on disrupted relations and 
confrontations. In that event, the sanctions would be the 
greatest obstacle to the peace process and the normalization of 
relations, President Milosevic stressed, expressing his 
expectance that the forces of peace and cooperation will 
overpower the protagonists of the war option and of prolonging 
the crisis. 
  Today's talks between President Milosevic and Vitaliy 
Churkin 
were also attended by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav 
Jovanovic and the Russian Ambassador to Belgrade Gennadiy Shikin.

  [Text] Mirko Jovic, chairman of the Serbian People's 
Defense Party, said in a statement for Belgrade Radio that an 
aggression was carried out on Serbian land. All U.S. citizens 
that are currently anywhere on the Serbian territory should be 
told that we consider them to be aggressors and that we are 
going to treat them as such. If one more aircraft takes off 
from Italian territory to fly to Serbian space, we are going to 
consider this to be participating in the aggression, because of 
which one should declare war on Italy, Mirko Jovic pointed out. 
He added that the FRY Government is obligated to proclaim 
general mobilization and ban the work of all media with a 
pro-U.S. orientation.

  [Text] Belgrade, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- The ruling Socialist 
Party of Serbia [SPS] today condemned the NATO attack against 
the positions of the Srpska republic army and warned that it 
could have immeasurable consequences on the escalation of the 
war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina and on the stability in the 
Balkans. 
  By committing the unannounced, treacherous April act, NATO 
has sided with the Muslims in the civil war in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, a statement by the SPS main committee says, 
and adds that NATO forces directly helped the Muslim offensive 
by military means and clearly declared their support to the 
forces that favor war. 
  The SPS believes that this action instigates and encourages 
the militancy of the Muslim side, and hardens their unrealistic 
aspirations, which could put in jeopardy the peace process by 
strengthening those who advocate the war option in solving the 
Bosnian drama. 
  This action threatens all constructive approaches to find a 
just solution through political negotiations and in a peaceful 
manner and resumes the policy of pressure, which places the 
sides in the conflict on an unequal footing, the statement says. 
  The SPS warns that this brutal act also represents a basis 
for preserving and maintaining permanent instability in the 
Balkans and that pressure, saber rattling, frequent border 
provocations, and bombing are all integral parts of a scenario 
for the escalation of the war in the area. 
  By giving cover to NATO for this act of aggression, the 
United Nations is losing its credibility in the peace mission in 
the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, the SPS main committee says and 
concludes that by covering up and falsifying the facts, by 
concealing the Muslim offensive, smuggling weapons to the Muslim 
side, by making a decision to deploy Turkish forces in Bosnia, 
and now by bombing the Serb positions -- the United Nations has 
confirmed that it is a mere instrument in the hands of those 
countries that want to achieve their interests and aspirations 
in the Balkans by prolonging the war. 
  The SPS believes that the way out of this situation must be 
sought through the prompt reaching of a truce in order to create 
conditions for the resumption of negotiations, the SPS says. 
  The statement says that political negotiations are the only 
way to reach a just and lasting solution to the conflict in the 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina and appeals to those circles in the 
international community who want peace in the Balkans to support 
such efforts.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (TANJUG) -- All political parties 
in Yugoslavia on Monday condemned the NATO air strikes against 
Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde on Sunday, and set out 
that the siding of the international community with one of the 
warring sides could effect an escalation of the war not only in 
the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina but also 
beyond in the Balkans. 
  The ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) issued a 
statement 
warning that NATO forces had "directly militarily aided the 
Muslim offensive and clearly declared support to the forces 
which want war," while the United Nations, "by lending its name 
to the aggressive act," had lost credibility for its peace 
mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "By covering up and falsifying facts, concealing the Muslim 
offensive, delivering arms to the Muslim Army, deciding to 
engage Turkish troops, and now resorting to bombing, the United 
Nations has shown to be merely an instrument in the hands of the 
countries which want to achieve their interests and aspirations 
in the Balkan region by prolonging the war," the SPS statement 
set out. 
  The U.N. took the decision to engage NATO aircraft at the 
request of the U.N. peace-keepers in the field, who have accused 
the Bosnian Serbs of allegedly launching attacks on the civilian 
population in Gorazde. 
  However, the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, which should have 
been demilitarized last spring as one of the six U.N.-proclaimed 
"safe areas," has been used by the Muslim side to mass around 
10,000 troops and launch the offensive operations against 
Bosnian Serb positions in the area. 
  The U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), itself, has said in 
its 
reports that the fighting in the area of Gorazde has been 
provoked by the Muslims. Bosnian Serb military sources have 
said that the Muslim offensive was launched with a view to 
winning territories before the internationally brokered peace 
talks resume. 
  The SPS said that a solution to the existing situation 
called 
for peace to be signed immediately so that conditions would be 
created for further talks. The ruling SPS underscored that 
talks were the "sole means of equitably and lastingly resolving 
the conflict in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  Serbia's Democratic Party (DS) termed the air strikes 
against 
Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde an "act of aggression." 
  The DS statement recalled that the U.N. Security Council 
resolution proclaiming "safe areas" in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina called for the protection of the civilian 
population and the full demilitarization of the respective areas. 
  The Gorazde "safe area" has, however, been turned into a 
real 
military base which is used by the Muslim army to prepare troops 
and launch offensive operations, the DS statement said. It set 
out that the Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) took the necessary 
measures to neutralize the dangers of the misuse of "safe areas" 
and the bombing of Serb positions by NATO was, therefore, 
totally unfounded. 
  The Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) recalled that UNPROFOR 
reports from the field had said that the fighting around Gorazde 
had been provoked by the Muslim troops. The DSS set out that 
"NATO, that is, those who are irresponsibly pulling its strings, 
have shown with the attack on Serb positions that they have war 
and not peace on their mind." 
  The Serbian Radical Party (SRS) qualified the NATO air 
strikes on Bosnian Serb positions as "aggression against the 
entire Serb people." 
  The SRS called for the Yugoslav parliament to hold an 
emergency session "clearly and loudly to take a stand on the 
aggression." It urged the federal government urgently to take a 
decision to terminate Yugoslavia's membership in the United 
Nations, close the Yugoslav U.N. mission in New York, expel all 
United Nations personnel from Yugoslavia, and ban transit across 
Yugoslavia to all U.N. missions. 
  The SRS called on the state leadership of the Bosnian Serb 
Republic (R.S.) within the shortest period to expel UNPROFOR 
troops and United Nations and European Union representatives 
from its territory. 
  "We are convinced that the Serb army should counter with all 
available means every attack from the air," the SRS set out. 
  The Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) said that it was "against 
every violence, even if carried out at the orders of the U.N. 
secretary-general." The SPO statement said that "peace is the 
only alternative" and "everybody in Bosnia-Herzegovina has had 
enough of death, devastation, and suffering." 
  The SPO, nevertheless, feels that the "United Nations is not 
an enemy of the Serbs" and that the enemies are those who are 
"pushing (Serbs) into a war with the whole world." 
  The New Democracy (ND) said that "the use of force leads to 
a 
further escalation of the war and draws the entire region 
further away from the much needed equitable and lasting peace." 
  The ND maintains that "the siding of UNPROFOR with one side" 
and the use of NATO aircraft were reckless moves. 
  The Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), the ruling party 
in 
the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, expressed deep concern and 
indignation at the NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serbs 
positions around Gorazde, and said that the moves were a 
violation of the basic United Nations commitments and principles. 
  The DPS statement said the NATO air strikes threatened to be 
an introduction to the dangerous practice of the imposition of 
solutions by means of force and the favouring of individual 
interests without the acknowledgement and equal participation of 
all warring sides. 
  We consider unacceptable and extremely dangerous the use of 
external force against any side in the civil war, especially at 
a moment when an end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been 
initiated with a strong diplomatic action on the part of the 
international community and its most important representatives 
-- the United States, Russia, and the European Union, the DPS 
statement said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Zeljko Avramovic] </F>
  [Text] Politics is primarily an ability to accomplish what 
is possible to accomplish, and every political activity relying 
on imaginary strongholds inevitably leads away from reality, 
toward nothing. Returning to reality usually means (?returning 
to the essence of the matter), which, like every other nucleus, 
is covered in darkness. 
  This should have been borne in mind by those who, entering 
political waters, assumed the responsibility of leading the 
Albanian people in Kosovo toward the aim that, as everyone 
knows, is outside the domain of serious political thinking. The 
intoxicating seductiveness of the idea of Kosovo as an 
independent state, which would be represented by these very 
people in the capital cities of Europe and the world with the 
accompanying sounds of an anthem and a guard of honor, is 
returning to Rugova's supporters as a bitter pill that they do 
not want to swallow but cannot spit out either. 
  The painful sobering up has divided the Kosmet [Kosovo- 
Metohija] political elite. The rift in Rugova's Democratic 
League of Kosovo and clashes between the party and the 
government of the so-called republic of Kosovo that has been 
concealed for a long time have escalated in the past few weeks. 
  The party was left by Jusuf Budzovi, Ismet Salihu, Ibrahim 
Berisa, and Dr. Rexhep Islami. Rugova, Agani, and Hiseni have 
stayed in the Presidency of the so-called republic of Kosova. 
The clash between the government and the party leadership must 
have reached the upper limit considering that Bujar Bukoshi, 
prime minister of the self-declared Kosovo state, is being asked 
to resign. 
  Shkelzen Malici is publicly saying that the government is 
playing more the role of an improvised ministry for relations 
with other countries than is making vital decisions. The 
problem also arose as the consequences of the undefined 
hierarchy and control within the secessionist leadership. 
  Ibrahim Rugova has so far been the untouchable boss. The 
illegally elected parliament now formally no longer exists. The 
so- called government has been reduced to the prime minister and 
one minister, even though 17 ministries had been planned. So, 
everyone is accountable to Rugova, and he is accountable to no 
one. 
  Perhaps the motives for these clashes, whose cause is a lot 
more deeper and is encroaching the most sensitive sphere, the 
sphere of finances, should be sought in this backdrop. This is 
supported by a statement by Fehmi Agani, who is still loyal to 
Rugova. He said that the distribution of financial resources 
and the collection of the compulsory 3-percent tax from the 
workers of Albanian nationality in the country and outside it 
are beyond control. 
  Rexhep Cosia, who split with Rugova earlier, holds the same 
view. The proximity of money is directly proportionate to the 
proximity of authority and every separation from it leads to 
resistance and proofs that something is wrong with the present 
authorities. 
  The former self-proclaimed prime minister Jusuf Zeinulahu 
also spoke up recently. He admitted what he had been aware of 
right from the beginning. According to him, the Assembly and 
the Government of the so-called republic of Kosovo were formed 
ad hoc with directives from the political parties of Albanians, 
and are not legitimate. Zeinulahu's public statement about 
something that many people were aware of has stirred the spirits 
in the leadership of the so-called Albania alternative and 
opened the road to the struggle to preserve the present 
positions, while creating covers in retreat. In this light one 
should view the participation in the debate in KOHA by the 
former high official of the Central Committee of the League of 
Communists and the spectacular return of Veton Suroi, who left a 
long time ago. 
  That something strange is happening is also confirmed by 
separate visits to the United States, first by Bukoshi, and then 
Rugova, and the statement by the former, which was not approved 
of by the Democratic League of Kosovo. In an interview for the 
Voice of America, Bukoshi said that the status of an autonomous 
region for Kosovo can be accepted as the first step toward the 
ultimate solution of the Kosovo issue. This statement 
represents a major turnabout in relation to the sacred stand 
hitherto on Kosovo as an independent state. This raises the 
question as to why a section of the Albanian political 
leadership has redefined its position and accepted the existence 
of Yugoslavia and a dialogue with its legal organs. 
  It is difficult to believe that this a result of regret or 
bad conscience before one's own nation whom they pushed into an 
abyss. One could say that this is more a result of the unwilling 
acceptance of the fact that, on the one hand, no country in the 
world recognized Kosovo as an independent state, and on the 
other, that the state of Yugoslavia is sufficiently strongly 
standing on its legs, and that it is capable of thwarting the 
political exhibitionism of forced secession without difficulties. 
  In these circumstances an increasing number of Kosmet 
Albanian politicians and intellectuals are trying to extend 
their political activities with conciliatory stands. 
Belligerent statements and the policy of extreme demands have 
not yielded any results, and the advocates of the idea that the 
page should be turned over, or even begin writing a new book of 
political activities by Albanians in Kosovo, are becoming 
increasingly vociferous.

  [Text] Tirana, April 12 (AFP) -- More than 30,000 
Albanians turned out Monday for the funerals of two soldiers 
killed, according to authorities in an attack on their training 
camp by "Greek terrorists" backing autonomy for Albania's ethnic 
Greeks. 
  About 10,000 mourners in the southern town of Gjirokaster 
massed outside the Greek consulate in protest at the reported 
attack near Peshkopia early Sunday. Another 20,000 attended the 
second funeral in Siera. 
  Defence Minister Safet Zhulali attended the funeral in 
Gjirokastra and in a speech hit out at "the Greek Government and 
the Greek church... conspiring behind our backs". 
  He said Greece which has expressed fears for the safety of 
the Greek minority in southern Albania "bears full 
responsibility for these acts which will be punished if they are 
repeated". 
  Albanian officials said officer Fatmir Shehu of Gjirokaster 
and conscript Arsen Gjini of Siera were killed and several other 
soldiers wounded when a Greek commando crossed the border at 
night and attacked the training camp. The Greeks allegedly 
opened fire on the sleeping soldiers. 
  Zhulali dismissed Greek calls for incorporation into Greece 
of the Greek-populated area of southern Albania which Athens 
refers to as Northern Epirus. "Northern Epirus does not exist 
and never existed," he said. 
  The Albanian Government, in a communique Monday, said 
Sunday's attack was a "direct attack on Albanian sovereignty and 
territorial integrity". Albania reserved the right to "take all 
necessary steps to respond to this policy of provocation", the 
statement said.

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement by Kiro Gligorov, president of The </F>
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; no date given: 
"Cooperation With Greece -- Our Constant Course"] 
  [Text] Kiro Gligorov, president of the Republic of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], 
has issued a statement on the EU Commission's decision to take 
the Greek embargo against the Republic of Macedonia to the 
European Court of Justice. 
  There follows the text of the statement: 
  ``The EU Commission has decided to take the Greek embargo 
against the Republic of Macedonia to the European Court of 
Justice. 
  ``On this occasion, I would once again like to reassert the 
constant course and interest of the Republic of Macedonia to 
achieve an overall development of relations and cooperation with 
the neighboring Republic of Greece. We therefore firmly believe 
that the lifting of the embargo against our country by the 
Republic of Greece would represent a substantial step toward the 
renewal of negotiations between our two countries, and an 
important contribution to the stability of the region in which 
we live. 
  ``The lifting of the embargo would normalize the situation 
on 
the Macedonian-Greek border regarding the free flow of people 
and goods, which is of mutual benefit for both countries, for 
their economies and citizens. 
  ``As a measure, the lifting of the embargo would have a 
significant impact on the intensification of mutual confidence 
and good will for the continuation of the Macedonian-Greek 
negotiations within the framework of the United Nations. 
  ``We reiterate our commitment to continue the dialogue, on 
an 
equal basis, about mutual relations in disagreement, including 
the ones pointed out by the EU Commission of 6 April this year. 
We are convinced that only negotiations in good will and with 
mutual respect can lead to appropriate and mutually acceptable 
solutions for all questions. 
  ``Therefore, we firmly believe that the lifting of the 
embargo is essential for the benefit of both countries and for 
stability in the region. Ultimately, bearing in mind the 
serious nature of these issues and our responsibility for our 
respective countries, we are called upon to do our best in a 
principled way and on an equal basis, to achieve normalization 
in our mutual relations, to intensify peace and stability in the 
Balkans.''

  [Text] Strobe Talbott, U.S. deputy secretary of state, who 
is on an official visit to Poland, has been received by 
President Lech Walesa and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak. He 
also had a one-hour conversation with Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski. 
  After years of confrontation and polarization, Walesa said 
in 
greeting the U.S. guest, there is now a chance to build a new 
order in Europe. We have fought for 50 years for Europe without 
divisions. This has cost millions of victims; the financial 
costs were enormous. After the sophisticated struggle in the 
1980's, there is now a chance to resolve the problems. Fast 
action and courageous decisions are needed, the president said. 
  [Begin Walesa recording] I am convinced that, by cooperating 
with the United States, we can achieve beautiful victories in 
Europe. We are, however, concerned about the remnants of 
communism and the Warsaw Treaty. Of course, there are no direct 
dangers, but a sphere under a question mark still remains. We 
wonder whether this sphere, when left alone, can rebuild the old 
setup in different conditions but following the communist 
pattern, or whether one should aim at unity in Europe. [sentence

  [Text] A meeting between Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and 
the U.S. deputy secretary of state, which lasted almost an hour 
and a half, concentrated on Polish-U.S. cooperation. Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak said after the talks: 
  [Begin Pawlak recording] We talked with Secretary Talbott 
about the internal situation in Poland. I presented a report 
about our economic indicators for the first quarter. Inflation, 
which is at its lowest for the past seven years, and a 
considerable increase in industrial output are worth noting here. 
  We also talked about cooperation within various 
international 
organizations, starting with financial institutions like the 
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and also those 
that speed up various ways of development, among them GATT and 
the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]. 
  Discussion of the Partnership for Peace program played a 
very 
important part in our talks. Further talks on this matter will 
take place between experts so that practical, concrete, and 
joint projects can be initiated this year. I think that the 
development of our region, Central Europe, is also very 
important. We discussed how the development of Europe can be 
supported in an efficient and effective way. [end recording] 
  It has transpired from brief statements made by Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Polish Foreign Minister 
Andrzej Olechowski that their talks focused on the philosophy of 
the Partnership for Peace program. Partnership for Peace, 
Minister Olechowski said, is an instrument that could result in 
a Europe without divisions, or in a new division of Europe. He 
added that this opinion was shared by his U.S. guest. Our 
efforts in implementing the idea of the Partnership of Peace 
program, Minister Olechowski said, go in the direction of 
possibilities for cooperation between Poland's and NATO's 
defense systems. The objective is that, if need be, these 
systems should be able to cooperate with each other at any time. 
  Minister Olechowski added that there would be visible 
evidence of this partnership and that there would be more joint 
exercises and joint actions. Journalists asked Minister 
Olechowski whether this visit would change anything in our 
mutual relations. 
  [Begin recording] [Olechowski] No, I do not think so. I 
think that the nature of this visit.... [pauses] Mr. Talbott is 
a man with vivid interests, he is intellectually alert, and he 
promised to come to Poland on his first visit. I think that he 
wanted to show that he is interested not only in Russia. That 
is why he came to Poland to listen to what we have to say. We 
have heard the most recent opinions. I do not see any great 
differences here with what I heard three months ago. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Specifically, can you name any 
undertakings with regard to the Partnership for Peace? 
  [Olechowski] There is our program, the presentation 
document, 
that we shall submit to Brussels very soon. We can see that 
this document, which has been written according to the 
philosophy I have described, is being favorably received. 
  We also talked about President Clinton's visit. He is to 
visit us in July. We talked about our region, and we shall 
continue this conversation this evening.

<F P=106> [Report by Marica Lalovic from Pale] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Vitaliy Churkin, special 
Russian envoy, is expected to arrive in Pale at 1630. He will 
have talks with the state leadership of the Srpska republic 
about the latest events concerning Gorazde and a possible 
resumption of the peace negotiations, for which the UN forces 
bear further responsibility, it is said in the announcement of 
the supreme command of the Srpska republic. The announcement 
further says that a harsh protest is being issued for raiding 
Serbian territory around Gorazde, stressing that with this 
gesture, the UN has openly taken the side against Serbs in this 
civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. The supreme command 
of the Srpska republic warns that politically motivated elements 
in NATO and the United Nations are encouraging Muslim attacks, 
so that they can take advantage of a Serbian response as an 
excuse for a military intervention. However, Serbs will not be 
frightened and they will retain the right to self-defense with 
all available weapons, it is said in the announcement by the 
supreme command. 
  There are still no precise reports on what is really 
happening around Tarcin. However, the situation is still 
extremely tense because Muslim radio [Sarajevo Radio] is no 
longer concealing the fact that several hundred Muslim refugees 
from eastern Bosnia have occupied the prison in Tarcin and 
kidnapped three Serbian inmates from it. The Tarcin prison has 
been blocked since Friday and it is threatened that all Serbs in 
it will be killed if the alleged shelling of Gorazde does not 
stop. The Serbian side has been demanding the closing down of 
Tarcin prison for some time now, but Muslim representatives have 
persistently refused, although at the Geneva conference they 
signed an agreement to release all prisoners under their control. 
  By the way, all humanitarian convoys and humanitarian 
flights 
on the territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Srpska 
republic have been suspended and the Serbian civil authorities 
have closed down all the blue roads in Sarajevo.

  [Text] After his talks with Vitaliy Churkin, Radovan 
Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic, gave the following 
statement to the Serbian Television: 
  [Begin Karadzic recording] Well, Mr. Churkin has urgently 
come because of the new situation and to try to learn about the 
Serbian side's position. We did not want to talk much about 
Gorazde itself. This is purely a military question, as Gorazde 
is not a protected zone nor has it been defined as such. 
Regarding its borders or its contents, according to 
international war law, this should be a strictly limited zone 
without any army apart from the United Nations Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR]. The two commanders should sign an agreement on 
this. The Muslims have always refused to do so, hoping to expand 
the Gorazde zone right up to the borders of Serbia and Sandzak, 
to gain much more after such a military offensive, and to ensure 
a green line [zelena transferzala]. 
  We briefed Mr. Churkin on our position, which is either war 
or peace. It cannot be a little bit of war and a little bit of 
peace. It cannot be war at Kupres, in Teslic, on Mount Ozren, in 
Doboj, along the corridor, that is, at Trebava, southward of 
Brcko -- everywhere where the Muslim forces are attacking us -- 
and in Gorazde, all until we set off into a counteroffensive. 
And when we set off into a counteroffensive, then (?everyone 
wants) to preserve peace and everywhere where Muslims still 
[word indistinct] for instance [name indistinct], (?Usora), and 
so on, one can calmly wage war there. Our position is that we 
want peace. Likewise, we said that our artillery is not 
shelling the town. Our aim is not the town's civilian targets. 
Our aim is to break up the Muslim offensive, the military 
defeat of the Muslim forces in Gorazde. 
  You shall see; hardly a few days will pass when it will be 
clearly told in the West. Democratic forces in the West will 
clearly say what interfering in this war on the side of the 
Muslims means, what it means responding to calls by UNPROFOR 
observers in Gorazde itself who are probably being shelled by 
the Muslims and who are probably being threatened by the 
Muslims, but they are certainly not threatened by the Serbs. In 
any case, this is a very critical moment in our relations with 
UNPROFOR. We have suspended all relations with UNPROFOR. We do 
not know how we would and whether we would establish any 
relations in the future. Since the arrival of General Rose, 
these relations are marred all the time because Gen. Rose 
sometimes forgets -- as we have informed Mr. Akashi in several 
letters -- that he is not in the Malvinas [Falkland Islands] or 
in an English colony; he is on Serbian territory and should 
behave as someone who is impartial and who must respect this 
people and its dignity. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- At an extraordinary 
session today chaired by Prime Minister Radoje Kontic, the 
Yugoslav federal government discussed the development of the 
situation following NATO's air strikes against the territory of 
the Srpska republic in the Gorazde area last night. 
  The federal government sharply condemned the United Nations' 
decision to use NATO's air force, which amounts to its direct 
involvement in the civil war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina on the 
Muslim side, a statement by the Federal Ministry of Information 
said. 
  The federal government particularly stressed that the United 
Nations did this without having fulfilled the assumed obligation 
of demilitarizing the Muslim army in Gorazde. Furthermore, it 
tolerated the planning and carrying out of Muslim offensive 
military operations launched from the protected area against 
Serb positions in the Gorazde area. Only when the Muslim spring 
offensive was defeated did the United Nations remember that 
Gorazde was a protected area and asked NATO fighter-planes to 
launch strikes against the Serb side under attack. 
  It is regrettable that the United Nations, which is obliged 
by the Charter to preserve peace and international security, 
took steps that put in jeopardy the peace process and caused the 
escalation of the war. By taking such biased and war-mongering 
positions, the United Nations has seriously discredited its 
reputation as a peace-making force in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
and has assumed responsibility for all consequences of a 
possible further uncontrollable development. 
  By acting as a side involved in the conflict, the United 
Nations has set a dangerous precedent, which can have 
far-reaching implications. 
  The federal government stresses that the way out of the 
crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina should not be based on a policy of 
double standards, and on the world organization [UN] and other 
factors siding with any of the three warring sides in the civil 
war there, but on the same treatment of all three warring sides, 
as well as on unbiased and unselfish contributions to the peace 
process. Any deviation from this principle only boosts the 
Muslim side in its belief that by stubbornly obstructing peace 
efforts and continuing military hostilities it can win the civil 
war and impose the concept of a united Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
federal government calls on the United Nations to immediately 
abandon the irresponsible and dangerous policy of getting 
involved in the war on the side of the Muslims and to fight 
against the war and fight for its unconditional, immediate, and 
lasting end by pursuing peace rather than war. 
  By consistently pursuing its principled and peaceful 
policies 
in resolving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia will continue to provide support for all 
constructive efforts to reduce the present tensions and to bring 
an end to the hostilities, and to a just and comprehensive 
political solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On this 
occasion, the federal government draws attention to the 
solidarity of all citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
with the Serb people in the Srpska republic who are victims of 
the latest aggression, the Federal Ministry for Information says 
in its statement.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav 
Government on Monday [11 April] most energetically condemned the 
United Nations decision to engage NATO forces to air raid the 
territory of the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.) in the area of 
Gorazde, and qualified the decision as direct involvement in the 
civil war in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
on the side of the Muslims. 
  At a session devoted to the latest development, the Yugoslav 
Government took the stand that the world organization had 
assumed the role of a side in conflict and, thereby, set a 
dangerous precedent which could have far-reaching consequences, 
the released federal government statement said. 
  The Yugoslav Government underscored that the U.N. had taken 
the decision on the air strike without previously fulfilling the 
assumed obligation to demilitarize Gorazde, and that it had, 
moreover, tolerated the planning and carrying out of the Muslim 
offensive operations from the U.N.-proclaimed "safe area" of 
Gorazde on Bosnian Serb positions around that town. 
  Gorazde and five other towns in Bosnia-Herzegovina were 
proclaimed "safe areas" by the U.N. last spring, upon which they 
were supposed to be demilitarized. However, Gorazde was used in 
late March this year for an attack on the Bosnian Serb positions 
around the town. Around 10,000 Muslim troops were engaged in 
the atack. 
  The fighting in the area of Gorazde has been provoked by the 
Muslim side, both according to Bosnian Serb military sources and 
reports of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The Muslim 
attack from Gorazde was launched as part of an all-out Muslim 
spring offensive, with a view to winning territories before the 
internationally brokered peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina 
resume. 
  It was only after the Muslim spring offensive failed that 
the 
U.N. remembered that Gorazde was a U.N.-protected "safe area" 
and invited NATO bombers to raid the Muslim-attacked Serb side, 
the federal government said. 
  "It is regrettable that precisely the United Nations, the 
organization duty-bound by its charter to preserve peace and 
international security, has taken a step which threatens the 
peace process and causes an escalation of war, the [words 
indistinct] has seriously discredited itself as a peace force in 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina and assumed the responsibility for all 
the consequences of possible further uncontrolled developments," 
the federal government said. 
  The Yugoslav Government reiterated that "the way out of the 
crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina is not the policy of double 
standards and the siding of the world organization or other 
factors with any side whatsoever in the Bosnian civil war, but 
it is in equal treatment of all warring parties and impartial 
and unselfish assistance to the peace process." 
  "Each and every departure from this principle serves only to 
strengthen the Muslim side in its conviction that by 
persistently sabotaging peace efforts and by continuing military 
hostilities it can win the civil war," the Yugoslav Government 
statement said. 
  The Yugoslav Government called on the U.N. immediately to 
abandon the "irresponsible and dangerous policy of joining in 
the war on the side of the Muslims" and to strive for peace and 
an immediate, unconditional and lasting end to the war. 
  The Yugoslav Government reiterated its continued commitment 
to a "principled and peaceful policy in the solution of the 
crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina," and said that the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia would continue to lend the necessary 
support to all constructive efforts aimed at reducing the 
current tensions, effecting an unconditional and lasting 
cessation of hostilities, and achieving a comprehensive and 
equitable political solution to the crisis in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Tirana, April 11 (ATA) -- On April 10, 1994, at 
about 2.30 a.m., a unit of 6-7 armed Greek terroristic 
commandos, among whom one who spoke Albanian with a Greek 
accent, entered the Albanian territory in the vicinity of 
Peshkepi village in the Gjirokaster district. At a distance of 
four kilometres from the border, in a military training centre, 
two of the group killed the soldier Arsen Llazar Gjini, 20 
years, from the Seman village, Fier. After that, four others 
rushed into the bedroom of the officers and opened fire against 
some officers who were sleeping. As a result, the training 
chief officer, first captain, Fatmir Sali Shehu, 34 years old, 
was killed. Shehu was born in Tepelena and lived in 
Gjirokaster. Three soldiers were also wounded and many others 
had injuries. During these terrorist acts, one of them 
screamed: "You have this for the north Epirus. Don't think we 
have forgotten". 
  The investigation group led by public order minister, Agron 
Musaraj, went to the spot immediately. It was concluded that 
the act was carried out by Greek terroristic commandos in 
military uniforms and with masks on their faces. They wore high 
shoes of Greek production. All of them were armed with 
shotguns. Material proofs found in the spot and the testimonies 
by officers there prove that this is a planned barbarous act. 
The fact that traces of the criminals lead to a Greek border 
point is a clear proof that it is a massacre, the report of the 
spokesman of the Public Order Ministry says.

  [Text] Tirana, April 11 (ATA) -- On April 10, 1994, at 
about 2.30 a.m., a unit of 6-7 armed Greek terroristic 
commandos, among whom one who spoke Albanian with a Greek 
accent, entered the Albanian territory in the vicinity of 
Peshkepi village in the Gjirokaster district. At a distance of 
four kilometres from the border, in a military training centre, 
two of the group killed the soldier Arsen Llazar Gjini, 20 
years, from the Seman village, Fier. After that, four others 
rushed into the bedroom of the officers and opened fire against 
some officers who were sleeping. As a result, the training 
chief officer, first captain, Fatmir Sali Shehu, 34 years old, 
was killed. Shehu was born in Tepelena and lived in 
Gjirokaster. Three soldiers were also wounded and many others 
had injuries. During these terrorist acts, one of them screamed 
in Greek: "You have this for the north Epirus. Don't think we 
have forgotten". 
  After this act, the commandos, followed by Albanian border 
forces left passing the Greek border. Traces of the commandos 
led to the Greek border point of Argjirohor. 
  All the environments of this ugly crime makes one think that 
its was a deliberate criminal act of the Greek special forces, 
for which the Greek Government bears all responsibility. The 
act is a grave violation of the Albanian state's sovereignty, 
which the Albanian Government denounces before the Greek 
Government as well as before the governments of other countries 
and international organisations. The Albanian Government will 
make known this act to other states and international 
organisations and ask them to put pressure on the Greek 
Government to put an end to these criminal acts, which have very 
dangerous aims against peace and stability in our region. They 
are part of the strategy and destabilization of the Balkans and 
intend to stir up tension in its south. 
  In a strong protest against this mean terrorist act, the 
Albanian Government asks the Greek Government to find out the 
authors of the crime and punish them publicly. Otherwise, it 
will bear all responsibility resulting from the consequences of 
this grave terrorist act which runs counter to all international 
acts that guarantee inviolability of sovereignty and regulate 
relations between countries.

  [Text] Tirana April 11 (ATA) -- Presidency spokesman 
informed that President Berisha commented on the terrorist 
attack in the recruit's barracks to Peshkepi e Siperme area, 
saying: 
  I express my condolences to the Albanian people and the 
families of the militaries that gave their life while fulfilling 
the duty and condemn the massacre committed against the recruits 
in the Peshkepia e Siperme area. This is a disgraceful act and 
extraordinary grave of Greece towards Albania, its sovereignty 
and integrity, so Greek Government has full responsibility for 
its consequences. I demand from the government to take all the 
necessary measures to prevent such acts and to respond properly 
to this act and policy. I appeal to Albanian opinion, 
governments of the whole world, their institutions, and the 
international public opinion to condemn this massacre. I point 
out that Greece and its policy of blockades and bands aims at 
the encouragement of Serb's aggression in the north of Balkans 
and the destabilization of the southern part of the region in 
favour of Greek expansionist goals. The Albanian will for good 
and friendly relationships, Greece was responded systematically 
with a series of criminal acts that aim to destabilize the 
country, but I stress that going back to the policy of bands 
during the beginning of the century, and fostering terrorism, 
Greek Government holds the responsibility of converting its 
country into a source of dangerous conflicts of which they are 
responsible. 
  At the same time I express mine and government determination 
insisting that the Albanian policy should serve to preserve 
peace and stability in the southern Balkans, as we have done up 
to now.

<F P=106> ["Criminal Act Against Sovereignty of the Republic of </F>
Albania and Stability in the Balkans -- Statement of the 
Government of the Republic of Albania" -- ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, April 12 (ATA) -- On April 11, the 
Government of the Republic of Albania launched the following 
statement: 
  Regarding the April 10, 1994 incident, with a commando made 
up of 6-7 Greek-speaking persons in Greek Army uniform, attacked 
a training center of Albanian recruits about four kilometres 
deep in the Albanian territory, killing the soldier on guard, 
Arsen Gjini, age 20, and the first captain, Fatmir Shehu, age 
34, opening fire against the recruits asleep wounding three of 
them, Eduard Vermishi, Frederik Kalemi and Janaq Xega, and 
lightly wounding many others before fleeing and pursued by the 
forces of order. The traces of the commando led to the Greek 
border point of Argjirohor. The government of the Republic of 
Albania expresses its deep indignation against this hostile act, 
which is a direct attack against the sovereignty and integrity 
of our Republic. 
  The Albanian Government notes that the April 10, 1994 
massacre is the gravest incident in the series of incidents 
provoked by the Greek Armed Forces, such as the violation of the 
Albanian territorial waters by Greek warships, which opened fire 
on January 4 and 10, 1994, by a Greek minesweeper on March 10 
1994, the killing of the Albanian citizen, Alfred Muco on March 
21, 1994 by Greek Armed Forces on patrol in the vicinity of 
Kosturi after detaining him, and other incidents taking place 
during this year alone. All these have been doubled with an 
anti-Albanian propaganda by the radio stations installed in 
northern Greece, which testify to territorial claims by Greek 
chauvinistic circles against Albania. 
  The policy of the terrorist acts and massacres conforms the 
Greek new policy of defence which, as it is declared, extends 
from Cyprus to the so-called "Northern Epirus", as Athens calls 
southern Albania. Let us mention here the frequent statements 
with territorial claims towards Albania by Greek Government 
members and high politicians such as those by former Premier 
Mitsotakis, who, on July 14, 1993 speaks of north Epirus' 
annexation by the Albanian state in 1913, that by the government 
spokesman Evangelos Venizelos, who in October 1993 considers 
Albania as the Greek Northern Epirus, the statement by the 
minister of the presidency Kuvellos, who on August 10, 1992 in 
the stadium of Athens publicly speaks of Himara as an 
"unliberated" land, or the statement of the leader of the 
current opposition Miltiadhis Evert, who goes so far as to say 
in January 1994 that Northern Epirus is northern Greece. 
  The Balkans and Europe know well the policy and morale of 
the 
Greek bands. Many a time, in the first half of this century, 
Greek armed units have penetrated into the Albanian territory, 
committing massacres, setting fires, and carrying out 
destructions and many other terrorist acts. The Albanians will 
forget neither the massacres of the Greek army and pre-military 
bands of General Damianos, Colonel Santos-Vardas, Sub-lieutenant 
Stratos, Captain Cyprus and others in the years 1912-1914 in the 
Korce-Kolonje region, nor the massacres and barbarisms of 
Deljanaqi in 1913 and of Zerve in 1944 for the ethnic cleansing 
of the Albanian population of Cameria. The Albanians will also 
not forget the fact that even today, the Greek Government 
refuses to recognise the Protocol of Florence on the southern 
borders of Albania. 
  Following the same policy also in the present days is both 
strange and shameful in this century end, especially now that 
the European Union has bestowed its presidency on Athens. The 
Greek authorities, instead of working for the consolidation of 
bridges of friendship and cooperation with the neighbours and 
stability of the tense region of the balkans, they are imposing 
blockade against Macedonia, setting up and training terrorist 
bands and organizing terrorism against Albania. Such a policy, 
which intends to create facilities to the allies, Serbian 
aggressors, is also embodied in the exchange of visits and 
meetings in Athens, Belgrade and Pale, as well as in the 
statements by the Serbian criminals that "only the God in heaven 
and the Greeks on earth are our allies". 
  The statements of the Greek officials that Greece is "a 
factor of peace, security and stability in the Balkan region" do 
not respond the reality. Regarding the April 10, 1994 massacre, 
the spokesman of the Greek Government, not only does not express 
regret for the victims, but voices no commitment on the part of 
his government to find out and punish the authors of this 
massacre, who after committing the criminal act, left in the 
direction of the Greek border point. On the contrary, he tries 
to invent nonexistent contradictions in the note of the Albanian 
Government. 
  On its part, the Albanian Government will undertake steps to 
react with determination against any hostile act against 
Albania, as well as reserves the right to undertake the 
necessary measures in response to this policy of provocation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "There Has Been Never and Will Never </F>
Be Northern Epirus -- Minister Zhulali Declares in the Funeral 
of the Victims of the Massacre of the Greek Commando"] 
  [Text] Tirana, April 12 (ATA) -- The funeral of the first 
captain, Fatmir Sali Shehu, killed on April 10 by the bloody 
hand of the Greek chauvinist forces, was held on April 11 in 
Gjirokaster. "The act committed by the Greek commando has 
certain anti-Albanian aims. It intends to create tensions in 
the south, in the context the Greek-Serb Orthodox 
fundamentalism, as well as aims to stir up old and fresh 
appetites of the Greek chauvinists towards Northern Epirus," 
declared the Albanian minister of defence, Safet Zhulali, during 
the funeral. 
  Giving the last farewell to this martyr also on behalf of 
the 
president of the republic, Sali Berisha, the minister of defence 
said that the Albanians intend to bother no one, but certain 
political circles, the Greek Government, the Greek church, hatch 
up deliberate criminal plots against free and friendly people, 
against a neighbouring country. This is a manifestation of a 
savage and absurd chauvinism intending to destroy friendship 
between the two peoples. At a time when the democratic 
governments of Europe are making efforts to establish peace, the 
Greek Government, with its constant support to Milosevic, does 
the contrary. We tell them: "Halt their criminal hand, no one 
can alienate the Albanian soil and the albanian nation," Mr. 
Zhulali said adding that there has been never and will never be 
Northern Epirus. 
  Further on he said that the Albanian Government strongly and 
resolutely denounces this act, which is a very grave violation 
of the Albanian people's sovereignty, before the Greek 
Government and those of other countries and to the international 
organisations. We ask the governments of the democratic 
countries to put pressure on and halt the criminal hand of the 
Greek Government against Albania, we ask the Greek Government to 
make public the authors of the crime and their punishment. 
  The Greek Government must put an end to the policy which 
intends destabilization in the Balkans and incitement to extend 
conflict to the south, Mr. Zhulali said underlining that the 
Greek Government bears full responsibility for these acts, which 
will face punishment if repeated in the future.

the Black Sea Economic Cooperation [BSEC], Mr. Ibrahim Atvinli. 
  "It is a fact that Albania and Turkey, as two friendly 
peoples, have the same views regarding BSEC, Mr. Arbnori said 
expressing the need of a greater cooperation between the two 
parliaments, especially in the field of legislation. 
  Mr. Ibrahim Atvinli said that the visit to a friendly 
country 
as Albania is of special delight to every Turk, especially now 
that it is following the path of democracy with devotion. In 
every international forum, Mr. Atvinli said, Turkey supports the 
foreign policy of Albania, which is an actor of peace and 
stability in the region. The strengthening of our parliamentary 
relations, he said in conclusion, will surely help the promotion 
of cooperation in economy and other sectors.

  [Text] Tirana, April 9 (ATA) -- "The Albanian Army and 
people have a special respect for NATO as an alliance of peace 
and security," Lieutenant-General Ilia Vasho, chief of the Army 
General Staff, said in the meeting with NATO supreme commander 
and the commander-in-chief of the U.S. Forces in Europe, George 
Joulwan. Mr. Vasho described for his honoured guest the reforms 
carried out in the Albanian Army, focusing on the main tasks of 
the army to create new visions in training, improvement of 
living conditions for troops and officers, preparation of a new 
military doctrine, and upgrading the qualifications of the 
officers in contemporary military science. 
  General Joulwan said he was impressed by the great progress 
that had been made in restructuring and modernizing the army. 
He extolled the character and high qualities of the Albanian 
fighting man which, General Joulwan said, were evident both in 
his meetings with the staff at the military bases and in his 
talks with Albanian officers. General Joulwan hailed the role 
of the alliance in promoting friendship among peoples. "The 
peoples appreciate freedom, friendship and sovereignty, these 
are the values that unite mankind and which our alliance 
manifests," General Joulwan said. 
  During its stay in Tirana, the NATO delegation attended the 
inauguration of the Academy for Non-commissioned Officers.

  [Text] Tirana, April 9 (ATA) -- At the end of his visit to 
Albania, the NATO supreme commander, General Joulwan, held a 
joint press release with the minister of defence, Safet Zhulali. 
  Minister Zhulali said that Albania favours close cooperation 
with NATO and an active participation in the Partnership For 
Peace. Mr. Zhulali expressed Albania's readiness to open its 
airport facilities to missions of the Alliance to preserve peace 
and stability in the region and beyond. He voiced Albania's 
commitment to participate in all the NATO structures. Joint 
military training, Mr. Zhulali said, will help the Albanian Army 
to keep up with the standards of NATO's member countries. The 
Albanian Army, he added, is preparing a company, which, after 
qualification, can take part in the peacekeeping forces of the 
United Nations. 
  He said that they are making arrangements for the Albanian 
forces to participate in rescue operations and to deliver 
humanitarian aid to the fighting areas. 
  Mr. Zhulali said that Albania has asked for greater material 
assistance and training of Albanian personnel in NATO's member 
country academies. He received positive replies to both these 
requests. Minister Zhulali said that they also discussed the 
possibility of the extension of the conflict to Kosova and 
further south as well as the threat posed by Serbian repression 
of the Albanian population in Kosova. 
  General Joulwan described the aim of his visit, which he 
related to Albania's support for the CSCE resolutions and NATO 
initiatives, its very strategic position in the region and 
Europe. "I appreciate your national commitment to freedom and 
democracy," General Joulwan said. "They are values for all the 
NATO countries with which we share these ideals. The general 
appreciated the commitment to strengthen democratic 
institutions, and the development of structures within the army. 
We will be looking forward to your document of presentation in 
the context of Partnership For Peace, which will present 
Albania's goals and objectives. NATO will do its utmost to 
create and build up mutual confidence between NATO and Albania. 
"I say you are on the right path," General Joulwan said. 
  To the question whether the Albanian Army can be furnished 
with new weaponry, General Joulwan said that "we are in the 
process of reviewing the request in order to examine the 
strategic role of Albania, but we shall do our best to help you." 
  Asked about NATO's attitude in case the conflict spreads in 
Kosova and beyond, General Joulwan replied that NATO, the United 
Nations, and other international organizations are deeply 
concerned over this matter. The UN forces, the Nordic and 
American battalions in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
show that the situation in this zone has been under serious 
consideration, General Joulwan said.

  [Text] Tirana, April 6 (ATA) -- The delegation of Ad Hoc 
Committee of Council of Europe [CE], headed by the vice 
president of Parliamentary Assembly, Lord Finsberg, held talks 
on April 6 afternoon with the Albanian permanent delegation to 
the Council of Europe, composed of Mr. Eduard Selami, Ali 
Spahia, and Namik Dokle. 
  Later, the representatives of the Council of Europe held 
talks with the minister of justice, Mr. Kudret Cela, and the 
attorney general of the republic, Mr. Alush Dragoshi. 
Journalists were not allowed to participate. 
<H5>  Albania Demands New Ways of Cooperation With the Council of </H5>
Europe -- Minister of Justice Meets With the Delegation of the 
Council of Europe 
  Albania demands new ways of cooperation with the Council of 
Europe as well as material assistance which will help improve 
the image of and consolidate the role of law, the minister of 
justice, Kudret Cela, said at the meeting with the delegation of 
the Ad Hoc Committee of the Council of Europe on April 6 
afternoon. 
  Minister Cela informed the European parliamentarians of the 
reform carried out during the last two years in the Ministry of 
justice. The realization of this reform, he said, has been 
considered in three main directions, administrative, structural 
and the reform in consciousness. 
  Mr. Cela familiarized the representatives of the Council of 
Europe with the work carried out regarding the draft 
constitution as well as a series of other laws not previously 
existing in Albania, such as advocacy and notary. Mr. Cela also 
said that the new civil code had already been approved by the 
government and will soon be submitted to the parliament. The 
new criminal code is concluded and is expected to be submitted 
to the government for approval. All these changes in the 
judicial system create possibilities for Albania to be admitted 
to the Council of Europe, Mr. Cela concluded. 
  The representatives of the Council of Europe asked Mr. Cela 
many questions about the independence of the judicial system in 
Albania, the content of the new criminal code, the composition 
and functioning of the High Council of Justice, and the 
functioning of advocacy.

institutions for the assistance it has received from them," 
President Berisha said in a meeting he had yesterday at the

all the conditions for becoming a member of the Council of

rights of national minorities. "Albania is determined in 
further cooperation with the Council of Europe and its 
integration into Europe," President Berisha emphasized. 
  Lord Finsberg appreciated the profound changes made in the 
course of reforms and said he would like to see Albania be as 
soon as possible a full member of the Council of Europe.

  [Text] Tirana, April 8 (ATA) -- Premier Aleksander Meksi 
received on April 7 the delegation of the Ad Hoc Committee of 
the Council of Europe led by Lord Finsberg, deputy president of 
the Parliamentary Assembly, the premier's spokesman reports. 
  Mr. Meksi pointed out that Albania should become a member of 
the Council of Europe after great transformations it has made in 
all the fields. He focused on the economic reform and 
especially on the steps made in the privatization process, the 
land division, the privatization of trade and transport, and 
services in general and in the food industry. Mr. Meksi also 
underlined the importance that the democratic government 
attaches to foreign investments in Albania, particularly to 
those in infrastructure. 
  Then, Mr. Meksi spoke about the growth of the agricultural 
production to the amount of 15 per cent, the increase of the 
gross product by 10 per cent, and the reduction of the budgetary 
deficit and inflation. Now Albania has its legislation and 
public order, and the bases of the market economy are being 
established, Mr. Meksi said. 
  Mr. Meksi also dwelt on the work for the creation and 
continuous improvement of legislation including the Civil Code, 
the Family Code, the Code of Labour, the Penal Code, and other 
documents. 
  Mr. Meksi mentioned some problems which the democratic 
government has to solve such as the elevation of the standard of 
living for the population, the increase of social assistance, 
resolution of the housing question and care for the formerly 
politically persecuted families. 
  Mr. Finsberg said that the mission of his delegation was to 
closely see the reform developments in Albania and the 
acceleration of the rates of the procedure of Albania's 
adherence to the Council of Europe. "We appreciate the progress 
Albania has made over this two year period," Mr. Finsberg said. 
"The information we got during this visit convinces us of the 
success of your democratic and economic reform programs."

  [Text] Tirana, April 8 (ATA) -- The Ad Hoc Commission of 
the Council of Europe, led by Lord Finsberg had today a meeting 
with representatives of the press in Albania. The commission 
showed interest in the application of the press freedom in 
Albania and listened to opinions by press representatives of the 
position and the opposition present in the meeting. 
  Expressing the desire for Albania's membership in the EU, 
the 
chairman of the Professional Reporters' Association and 
editor-in-chief of ALEANCA DEMOKRATIKE, Prec Zogaj, expressed 
the concern of his association over the Press Law passed by the 
parliament, describing some of its articles as "repressive." 
According to Mr. Zogaj, these articles "overpass the claims of 
the law as a means to discipline the press." 
  Ylli Rakipi, chairman of the Reporters' League of Albania, 
which includes 95 per cent of all reporters in Albania, said 
that "there are more newspapers than reporters in Albania. The 
Albanian press lacks professionalism and the ethic of journalism 
rather than the freedom of the press. You can find in the 
Albanian press directs offence, sometimes going so far as 
threatening to death the head of state," Mr. Rakipi said. 
  Thoma Gellci, editor-in-chief of ZERI I POPULLIT, asserted 
the fact that the press freedom has changed a lot as compared 
with the past but he laid the stress on the fact that 
information in newspapers that represent certain parties is 
under the parties' control and the presentation of the opposite 
opinions is not a practice. 
  "When through my freedom I cause damage to others' freedoms 
then it means that there exists no democracy," a reporter of the 
RD [RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE], Edi Paloka, said, adding that there 
is a lack of journalistic ethic in the Albanian opposition press. 
  Director of the newspaper KOHA JONE, Nikolle Lesi, expressed 
his support for reporters Martin Lekaj and Aleksander Frangaj, 
considering their punishments as "a pressure of the state over 
the press organs." 
  RTV reporters Bujar Muharremi and Zamira Koleci pointed to 
the fact that free press has just appeared in Albania and it 
needs ethic and professionalism. 
  Rafael Floqi, an ATA reporter, concentrated on the 
professional weak points of the Albanian press. He said that "a 
totally independent press does not yet exist in Albania, because 
even those papers considered to be independent still express 
certain political tendencies. There can be no talk of the lack 
of press freedom," Mr. Floqi said, "when about 70 per cent of 
the number of the newspapers belong to the opposition." 
  The representatives of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Council 
of 
Europe showed interest in the possibilities existing to get the 
information. They asked whether government forums invite 
representatives from all newspapers in their press conferences. 
In general all reporters accepted that such invitations have 
been made. 
  All reporters present in the meeting replied positively a 
question by Mr. Lambert Kelchtermans, member of the committee, 
asking them whether they agreed that Albania become a member of 
the Council of Europe.

  [Text] Sofia, April 12 (BTA) -- "Bulgaria's position of 
non- intervention in the developments in Sarajevo was spelled 
out by President Zhelev and Prime Minister Berov and will remain 
unchanged," STANDART NEWS quotes Defence Minister Valentin 
Aleksandrov as saying in Ankara, where he is on an official 
visit. A STANDART NEWS special correspondent reported that the 
prevailing opinion in Ankara is that the Turkish contingent to 
Sarajevo will hardly be allowed to cross Greece and Bulgaria, 
and Turkey is ready to send it by sea. 
  Quoting government sources, 24 CHASA says that U.S 
Ambassador 
to Sofia William Montgomery asked "recently" that "Turkish blue 
helmets be granted passage through Bulgaria." According to the 
daily, President Zhelev and senior diplomats had been under 
strong pressure. "Some of them were even given a hint that if 
Sofia complied, its foreign debt problems would be settled in 
the talks with the creditors of the Paris and the London Club," 
24 CHASA says. It quotes U.S. Press Attache William Cook, who 
"categorically denied yesterday that U.S. officials had attacked 
Bulgarian institutions about the passage of Turkish 
peacekeepers."

<F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, April 12 (BTA) -- The dailies lead on 
yesterday's NATO air strike, the second in two days, on Bosnian 
Serb artillery positions in the Muslim enclave of Gorazde. The 
dailies of the two major political forces frontpage stories 
headlined: "NATO Planes Bomb Eastern Herzegovina on Two 
Consecutive Days" (DUMA, the daily of the Bulgarian Socialist 
Party) and "Russia Wants No More Air Strikes on Bosnia" 
(DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of Democratic Forces). 
  "NATO's air strikes showed that the Serbs had obviously 
misjudged the patience of the international community. After 
what happened, there is hope that they will rethink their 
position and will return to serious negotiations," says 
ZEMEDELSKO ZNAME, the daily of the most influential 
extraparliamentary Agrarian Party. A signed commentary in the 
trade union TRUD daily says: "Clearly, the bombs came too late 
and no one will rise from the 250,000 dead lying in graves 
across the former Yugoslav Republic." The author asks whether 
there is an international conspiracy against the former 
Yugoslavia, the Balkans and European unification and whether it 
was pure chance that Washington and Moscow actually gave 
Belgrade the signal to start the war with their declarations 
that they "are firmly in favour of Yugoslavia's unity." "If we 
survive, we will come to the age-old truth that it is all a 
matter of division of labour: the big ones make a mess and the 
small ones do the clean- up," the author of the TRUD commentary 
says in conclusion. 
  A signed article in 24 CHASA, headlined "NATO Brings Us 
Closer to New Balkan War," says: "Three rockets won't scare the 
Serbs who fought Islam for centuries." According to STANDART 
NEWS, Russian President Boris Yeltsin in "an angry telephone 
conversation" with U.S. President Bill Clinton protested that 
the United States had not consulted Russia before the attack; 
"this was another way of saying that Russia dreams of being a 
factor in the Balkans but that's all it was." "Recent 
references to Malta and Yalta are not a coincidence," says a 
signed commentary in OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK. The author says the 
outcome of the latest developments is "likely to be reached 
through secret diplomacy, as it has always been." A story in 
KONTINENT headlined "Bomb-happy Love of Peace" recalls that 
there have been dozens of cases when the Serbs were much more 
deserving of air strikes. The author asks "whether (the reason 
for the air strikes is that) the time had come to show the world 
that NATO exists and works, that it still is under Washington's 
command, that NATO commands the United Nations and involves the 
world organization in a civil war?" "What are the Balkans 
supposed to become in the future: a new Vietnam or a new 
Afghanistan?" The KONTINENT commentary says in conclusion.

  [Text] Varna, April 11 (BTA) -- We were hoping that Russian 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would visit Bulgaria in 
March-April but apparently the visit will take place later as it 
is related to the drafting of intergovernmental documents on 
further cooperation between Bulgaria and Russia, Russian 
Ambassador to Bulgaria Aleksandr Avdeyev said at a press 
conference here tonight. 
  One of the documents refers to debt settlement and is being 
drafted by financial experts of the two countries, the second 
regulates payments between the two countries in the national 
currencies. There are also several other documents on 
cooperation in nuclear power engineering, in conventional power 
engineering, in agriculture and health care. 
  Ambassador Avdeyev informed journalists of joint projects he 
discussed during his three-day visit to Varna: on Russian 
investment in tourism, on a Bulgarian-Russian ferryboat link and 
on restoring direct contacts between enterprises of the two 
countries.

  [Text] Sofia, April 11 (BTA) -- A failure of the general 
strike organized by the Confederation of Independent Trade 
Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) is out of question, KNSB leader Prof. 
Krustyu Petkov told DAILY NEWS and foreign correspondents today. 
According to Prof. Petkov, this is the most appropriate time to 
strike. Only shock forms of action and pressure on the 
government can awaken Bulgarian politicians from their current 
slumber, Prof. Petkov said. 
  The KNSB, one of the two major trade union amalgamations in 
this country, decided to resort to a general strike on April 4, 
1994, scheduling it for May 17. It has been provided for 
staggered strike actions to start already on April 13. The 
management of about 200 enterprises across the country will 
receive strike declarations already this week, Prof. Petkov 
said. In two-thirds of the enterprises there will be joint 
strike actions with the other major trade union amalgamation in 
this country -- Podkrepa, the KNSB leader told journalists. Two 
enterprises are already protesting, he added. Protest actions 
will first start in the mechanical engineering branch, the 
military industrial complex, the electronic industry and the 
food processing industry, the KNSB leader said. KNSB structures 
cover 55-60 percent of Bulgaria's employed active population, 
according to Prof. Petkov. 
  A protest rally has been scheduled for April 14 in Sofia. 
The KNSB member federations will start strike actions on May 
14. According to Prof. Petkov, KNSB has received proposals from 
some political forces for joint strike actions, but he declined 
to comment or provide further information. The KNSB is planning 
to accompany the general strike with a civic boycott of prices 
and tariffs imposed by state-owned monopolist enterprises. 
  KNSB demands an agreement with the government envisaging 
compensations for the latest drastic drop in incomes. The trade 
union calls for bringing wages, pensions and social benefits in 
line with the real cost-of-living rises. KNSB insists on a 
temporary price freeze for staple goods and services. It urges 
that a state programme for stabilization of the foreign exchange 
and financial market be adopted. The union will call off the 
strike if Prime Minister Berov takes part in the official talks 
and gives guarantees that the trade union's demands will be met. 
Prof. Petkov did not specify what kind of guarantees KNSB 
expected. In his view, the strikers would score a 
"supersuccess" if parliament passed a decision obliging the 
government to meet the trade union's demands. 
  KNSB will seek support from the European Trade Union 
Confederation, the International Confederation of Free Trade 
Unions and national trade unions in Europe. KNSB sets great 
store by the principled position of the organizations and the 
possibility to exchange experience rather than by financial 
support, Prof. Petkov said today. 
  KNSB demands have the backing of leaders of the 
extraparliamentary Bulgarian Social Democratic Party and the 
Civil Alliance for the Republic. The Socialist Party's 
leadership linked its support to the condition that no political 
demands be made. KNSB and the Socialists will be holding 
consultations on a weekly basis. The trade union leadership 
will meet other political forces as well.

  [Text] Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- The following is the full 
text of Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus's address at the first 
congress of the Bohemian-Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions 
(CMKOS) today. 
  The government considers trade unions an important element 
of 
a democratic society. I see trade unions as a good example of 
organizing, on a voluntary basis, people who are united by 
common interests and who want to pursue these interests together 
within our democratic society. There had never been, there are 
not and there will never be any doubts about this. 
  The government is attentively watching the trade union 
movement's transformation in the Czech Republic, a process which 
is accompanied by the same search and the same difficulties as 
the transformation of the whole country. I wish you well in 
managing successfully and quickly the transformation of the 
former trade union movement -- false, formal, monolithic, 
passively agreeing with the communist regime and with obligatory 
membership -- into a voluntary, authentic, active and 
pluralistic organization. This transformation is in the 
interests of us all, in the interests of the whole country. 
  I firmly believe that like our whole society the trade union 
organization should also be consistently reformed from below 
because the essential meaning of trade unions lies in the 
relationship of individual union members and their basic trade 
union organizations on the company level towards employers and 
towards the management of the company -- that is in the 
relationship on a micro level and not on a macro level which 
consists of relations between the trade unions' leadership and 
the government. These relations are only supplementary ones, 
they are only that famous top of the iceberg which, although 
seen more frequently in the media are not decisive. I hope that 
this is exactly the sense in which you understand certain recent 
government statements about its intention to gradually withdraw 
from the Tripartite (the Council of Economic and Social 
Agreement comprising representatives of the government, unions 
and employers) which was established in the post-November 1989 
period or about its possible transition into a consultative 
body, an idea which we are in no case abandoning. I hope that 
some of our reservations against higher collective agreements 
and others are understood exactly in this sense. 
  Our emphasis on micro-relations, on relations on a company 
level, stems from our deep conviction that every voluntarily 
established civic organization should represent its members and 
that it should not speak on behalf of its non-members, be they 
employees of the same company or workers of the same profession. 
In the first case it would approach the status and the role of 
a political party, in the second it would be something close to 
guild or a professional chamber. I believe that trade unions 
are neither the first nor the second. 
  The government understands the employees' interest on the 
company level, it fully respects it and believes that this 
interest, defended by the unions, contributes to something that 
surely concerns us all -- the creation of a well functioning and 
prosperous society and economy where we will all feel good, 
where we all find the place that suits us and where the 
elementary principle of honesty and fair play reigns. 
  The government is completely aware that the interests of the 
employee and employer are not identical in the short term and 
maybe also the medium term (in the long term it is less clear) 
and therefore we consider it utterly logical that this clash of 
interests is institutionalized -- on the company level -- in 
collective agreements. As I have already said we do have our 
doubts about the meaning and actual contribution to be made by 
collective rights of a higher type and in particular of 
employer-employee negotiations on the macro-level. 
  We consider erroneous and contentious any attempts to 
transfer automatically wages or other employment conditions from 
one company to another, from one branch of industry to another, 
or even from one country to another. The government 
nevertheless does not have the least doubt about the mission of 
the unions and it would be wrong to accuse it of doubting this. 
  At this point I am coming to some thoughts on our opinion 
of the operation of unions on the macro-level. I have 
repeatedly spoken in favor of consultative relations, in favor 
of mutually informing each other, in favor of listening to each 
other and thanks to all of this in favor of significant mutual 
enrichment. The government does not have a patent on 
reasonableness and thus listens carefully, and I can assure you 
that in the future also it will listen to union recommendations 
on legislation and the economy and the social policies of this 
country. The government is seeking the fundamental consensus of 
the people on basic questions of our present and our future and 
it realizes that the unions play an exceptionally important role 
in this. 
  Hence we respect the Council of Economic and Social 
Agreement 
and will endeavor to continue to negotiate within its framework, 
even if the role of the government (and state) as employer 
changes in an essential way because of privatization. We will 
bring proposals on partial changes and shifts in the Tripartite 
talks, but I would like to emphasize, here before you, that we 
will not call for any revolution, nor for radical change. 
Partial differences of opinion in these matters should not, in 
my view, be dramatized. 
  In its economic and social policy, the government strives 
for 
the maximum possible well-being of all our citizens and maximum 
possible employment since we are aware of the unpropitious 
effect, one which degrades the human nature, of high and 
long-term unemployment. I believe that every one of our 
fellow-citizens and union members can see the extent of our 
country's achievement in the period since November 1989, and 
that they can see and assess them not in isolation but 
  -- in the context of the unique task of removing the 
communist heritage and 
  -- in relation to the other countries faced with a task 
similar to one facing this country. 
  I am not drawing on any statistics here because I think we 
have discussed them quite often and because after all everyone 
is able to see them all around them in their everyday life. I 
feel certain that everyone knows that our rate of inflation as 
well as unemployment are among the lowest in the world, and 
usually run at ten times lower then elsewhere. 
  Nor do I believe that recent developments in employment 
legislation were a turn for the worse for the workers' situation 
and I also believe that the recent pointed differences between 
the government and the unions were no more (and no less) than 
different opinions on one and the same issue and that they are 
common differences of opinion which every democratic society 
allows to exist legitimately. 
  I cannot agree with people saying, as they did at your 
recent 
demonstration, that unions have to face up to "apathetic 
politicians and deputies" since I can responsibly claim that in 
the recent past the government accepted lots of union proposals 
on wide-ranging issues; I cannot accept reproaches that we are 
"unable to listen to the people" and that we "shut ourselves 
away in offices, luxurious foreign cars and behind empty little 
phrases," because it simply is not true. We, as well as others, 
may not succeed at everything but it is not true that we do not 
strive for maximum possible dialogue with the people of this 
country. Nor do I agree that we fail to show "social 
sensibility" since we have implemented and continue on a day to 
day basis to implement a number of social measures. I do not 
believe it fitting to say at that same demonstration that "we 
must not let people at work feel like helpless cogs in a 
machine." I, for one, do not believe that this is really the 
union members' dominant feeling -- except perhaps of those who 
in the past Communist era became used to a leisurely working 
pace. 
  I am convinced -- and I believe that most of you will feel 
the same -- that we have been tackling the sorely needed task of 
social change at the fastest pace and least individual expense 
possible. This is why I also cannot agree with the view, voiced 
at your recent demonstration, that we "as citizens 
democratically voted for belt-tightening," since I want to say 
that we did not vote for anything like that. Our belts were 
tightened without our consent by the former communist regime, 
and in the moments of returning to normal society we are not 
left with any other options. The collapse of communism and 
consequently that of our Comecon [CEMA -- Council for Mutual 
Economic Assistance] markets has led to inescapable and 
irrevocable losses which of necessity it will take all of us to 
repair. If we could go on exporting our goods to the former 
Soviet Union, a number of our companies would be better off than 
they are. But you yourselves know best that this is what the 
government, along with you, wished. Unfortunately, we have not 
had any choice in this and we have not begun to tighten our 
belts of our own free will. It must be said that in the past we 
not only lived off the more distant past but also off future 
while today we are left with no one and nothing to live off. 
When I hear someone say that "already far too many people feel 
that this belt is beginning to be too tight," once again I 
cannot agree. After real incomes plummeted in 1991, at the time 
of the breakup of Comecon, they grew 10 per cent in 1992, 4.5 
per cent in 1993 and in 1994 the trend has so far been holding. 
I am sure that this year will see an economic recovery equal to 
a rise of several per cent in the GNP and that this will enable 
further growth in real incomes. I do not see any reasons why 
the real income growth should stop in the near future. 
  If I say this I also say, in the same breath, that we are 
aware of the irregularity of economic and wage development 
within our country and of certain remaining social problems 
which weigh heavily on some of our fellow citizens, and 
therefore we are trying our utmost -- in most cases, I think, 
not in conflict with union views -- to perfect our social 
policy. Not at the expense of our future, but on the basis of 
our possibilities today and our activities today. 
  I know the unions do not like the introduction of pay 
regulation, but after the excesses of too fast a growth in wages 
in some companies over the last two years, the step 
unfortunately was essential. I believe the very cautious extent 
of regulation that was chosen makes two basic things possible: 
  -- the growth of real wages and 
  -- essential wage differentiation between successful and 
unsuccessful companies, effective and ineffective workers. 
  And this is precisely what is most needed today for all of 
us. A sensible level of wages is after all the most important 
precondition for maintaining a low level of unemployment and for 
the general success of our post-communist era. 
  I believe that in all these things and in many others we are 
not too distant from the opinions of the unions and therefore 
the little phrase at your recent demonstration that "we will 
choose more carefully at the next elections" was only rhetorical 
overstatement and did not represent a serious and universal 
appraisal of the situation in our country. 
  The era of state ownership and state enterprises is drawing 
to an end. The share of private ownership is increasing; 
employers, entrepreneurs and private owners of businesses are 
getting stronger. The counterweight to this is the unions and we 
want them to really be a counterweight and contribute in this 
way to the creation of a conceptually, economically and socially 
balanced society. I am certain that you will address these 
matters at your congress and that on the basis of this you will 
formulate your strategy for the time to come. 
  For all these reasons I wish your congress great success.

  [Text] Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- Czech Prime Minister 
Vaclav Klaus today rejected the possibility of confrontation 
between the government and trade unions mentioned by Deputy 
Chairman of the Bohemian-Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions 
(CMKOS) Pavel Hajek in his address at the CMKOS's first congress 
today. 
  "I believe nobody is interested in confrontation," Klaus 
told 
journalists at the break in the congress, at which he delivered 
a speech. 
  CMKOS Chairman Vladimir Petrus, commenting on Klaus's 
address 
said that "he was glad to hear some of Klaus' statements, but 
had to think about others." 
  Regarding the apology which the trade union leadership 
demanded from Klaus for comparing the trade union demonstration 
on March 22 in Prague Old Town Square to the pro-communist 
demonstration from February 25, 1948, Petrus said that Klaus's 
presence at the union congress was already his apology. 
  "Klaus would have definitely not attended a conference of 
participants in a new February putsch. He came to the congress 
of his own trade unions in the Czech Republic and I personally 
fully satisfied with such an apology," Petrus said.

  [Text] Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- The speech delivered by 
Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus at the union congress today 
did not satisfy the congress participants too much, according to 
a mini-poll conducted by CTK. 
  The delegates expressed their disapproval mainly of what 
they 
called Klaus's effort to "atomize the unions and force them 
merely to the enterprise level". The unionists already 
expressed their disapproval when Klaus was speaking. In one 
moment a slight whistle could be heard. 
  Andreas Botsch, an aide to the general secretary of the 
Trade 
Union Advisory Committee affiliated with the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (TUAC-OECD), called Klaus's 
speech an address of a "neoliberalist economist listening with 
one ear and seeing with one eye only." Botsch was loudly 
applauded for his statement. 
  According to Botsch, Klaus said that it would be necessary 
to 
"tighten belts" even in the future. When Botsch finished his 
speech, one of the delegates proposed that his address be 
adopted as the congress's official response to Klaus's speech. 
  Some delegates expressed their displeasure at the fact that 
Klaus had not apologized for his comparing the union 
demonstration on March 22, 1994, with the communist putsch of 
February 25, 1948. 
  In the morning Vladimir Petrus, chairman of the Bohemian and 
Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS) said Klaus apologized 
by his participation in the congress. "Klaus would have 
definitely not attended a conference of participants in a new 
February putsch. He came to the congress of his own trade 
unions in the Czech Republic and I am personally fully satisfied 
with such an apology," Petrus said.

  [Text] Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- Richard Falbr, one of the 
candidates for the chairmanship of the Bohemian and Moravian 
Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS), described as unacceptable the 
recommendations concerning the role of the unions, made by Czech 
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus at the 1st CMKOS congress earlier 
today. 
  According to Falbr, Klaus wants the unions to work in basic 
organizations, and the union associations not to be too active 
and not to play the role of political parties. 
  Addressing the congress this morning, Klaus said that "the 
essential meaning of trade unions lies in the relationship of 
individual union members and their basic trade union 
organizations on the company level towards employers and towards 
the management of the company -- that is in the relationship on 
a micro level." 
  Falbr noted that the situation in basic organizations had 
been worsening just due to measures pushed through by the 
government and Parliament. However, Falbr did not specify the 
measures. 
  Falbr told CTK that the methods of work were exclusively the 
unions' own matter. He said that Klaus's speech was "smartly 
composed," but could not conceal the premier's ideas which are, 
according to Falbr, identical with Margaret Thatcher's negative 
view of union work.

  [Text] Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- The 1st congress of the 
Bohemian and Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS), after a 
stormy discussion, approved the CMKOS news statutes tonight. 
Representatives of some small trade unions even walked out of 
the negotiating room in protest against the deletion of the 
article establishing the Council of Union Chairmen. 
  The Council comprised 38 chairmen of the individual unions 
associated in the Chamber, each having one vote. 
  On the other hand, the new statutes create a new body -- the 
CMKOS Assembly, in which individual unions are represented 
proportionately to their memberships. The Assembly is to meet 
once in six months. 
  Representatives of small unions were opposed to the 
abolition 
of the Council because they are afraid of the numerical strength 
of large unions in the Assembly. Representatives of the large 
unions, on the other hand, said the Council was not functional.

  [Text] Prague, April 9 (CTK) -- Richard Falbr, 54, has 
been elected chairman of the Bohemian and Moravian Chamber of 
Trade Unions (CMKOS), it was announced officially at the CMKOS 
1st congress shortly after midnight. 
  Until now CMKOS deputy chairman, Falbr received 943 out of a 
total of 1,362 valid votes in the first round of the vote. He 
is replacing Vladimir Petrus who was elected CMKOS chairman in 
April 1990. 
  Cyril Zapletal, chairman of the Union of Mining, Geology, 
and 
Oil Workers won 150 votes, Bohumir Dufek, chairman of the 
Bohemian and Moravian Agriculture and Food Trade Union, received 
84 votes, and Karel Macura, deputy chairman of the strongest 
Kovo (metallurgy) union was supported by 61 delegates. 
  Immediately after the election, the CMKOS Assembly, 
comprising representatives from individual unions 
proportionately to their memberships, met at its constituent 
session. It is to elect four CMKOS deputy chairmen. 
  After the November 1989 "velvet revolution", Falbr became 
the 
chairman of the Bohemian-Moravian Trade Union of Service 
Workers. He briefly held the post of deputy chairman of the 
Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party (CSSD), and was the last 
head of Czechoslovakia's largest union organization, the Czech 
and Slovak Confederation of Trade Unions (CSKOS). 
  He held the post even after Czechoslovakia's split on 
January 
1, 1993, as the CSKOS continued its operation to help solve the 
problems of the labor market and joint Czech-Slovak economic 
relations. In November 1993 the CSKOS disbanded, and its two 
successors, the independent Czech (CMKOS) and Slovak chambers, 
were established. 
  Falbr continued his union activities. He contributed to the 
integration of three trade unions, those of service area, gas 
industry, and foreign trade workers, into the UNIOS trade union, 
of which he was elected chairman in mid-February 1994. 
  Falbr, a doctor of law, was born on September 29, 1940 in 
Chester, Great Britain, where his father served in the Czech air 
force unit. Falbr's mother was Spanish, which may have 
contributed to Falbr's good knowledge of foreign languages. 
  From 1968 to 1970 Falbr was a member of the Communist Party 
of Czechoslovakia. From 1963 to 69 he taught Spain and English 
at the Interior Ministry's School of Languages. Falbr is 
married and has a son and a daughter.

  [Text] Prague, April 9 (CTK) -- The new chairman of the 
Bohemian and Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS), Richard 
Falbr said today the speech which Premier Vaclav Klaus delivered 
at the CMKOS congress on Friday [8 April] indicated that 
"nothing nice and nothing pleasant is awaiting us." 
  "I would like to create a team of people who would be good 
opponents to our social partners (the government and employers) 
who sometimes do not behave like partners," Falbr told the 
delegates shortly after his election. 
  He promised to do everything to improve union activity. "I 
will proceed from the achievements of the Bohemian and Moravian 
Chamber of Trade Unions," he stressed. 
  The congress continues at 9:00 a.m. today. The names of the 
four deputy chairmen to be elected by the CMKOS Assembly during 
the night are to be announced on Saturday [9 April]. Falbr is 
expected to deliver a speech after the delegates approve 
congress documents.

  [Text] Prague, April 9 (CTK) -- The election of Richard 
Falbr as chairman of the Bohemian-Moravian Chamber of Trade 
Unions (CMKOS) is more favorable than unfavorable, Premier 
Vaclav Klaus said today. 
  "Of course a more moderate candidate won," he said, adding 
that it was not really up to the government to make such an 
evaluation. 
  Congress delegates today voted down a suggestion to withdraw 
from the General Agreement between the unions, government, and 
employers as a "last resort" to President Vaclav Havel's 
signature of the new labor law amendment, which the unions had 
strongly opposed.

  [Text] London/Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- Czech President 
Vaclav Havel will avoid interviews with news agencies because 
his office cannot check the published text, presidential 
spokesman Ladislav Spacek told Reuters today. 
  "We have to control in which way, in which shape, it (the 
text of the interview) will be published," Havel's spokesman 
Ladislav Spacek told Reuters. 
  "I think it is good for us to be sure that nobody can take 
just a part of the text and publish it in convenient context." 
  Reacting to this, Reuters wrote that under the communist 
regime Havel had worked in the executive committee of the Czech 
Pen Club, "a writers' organization which campaigned for freedom 
to publish without government intervention." 
  According to Spacek, Havel stated he would refuse all 
requests for interviews, including that from Reuters, before the 
forthcoming meeting of the presidents of the Central European 
countries in Litomysl, East Bohemia, to take place on April 
15-16. 
  Spacek said that Havel was "dismayed" by the published 
versions of several recent interviews he had had with local 
press. Havel will not give any interviews to any news agency in 
the future, Spacek announced. 
  "You know our press. Sometimes we must be more careful than 
in the Western democracies where the press is on a higher level 
of responsibility," Spacek said. "It's not very convenient for 
us to see some quotation or cutting without any context which we 
can't prerequisite or check beforehand." 
  Spacek gave a similar answer to the Czech News Agency (CTK) 
when it requested an interview with Havel last week. "We cannot 
approve the form of information in which it reaches the reader. 
What matters in every case is also the context in which the 
report appears in the media, and the statement which is 
selected. These are the risks because of which we have not 
granted an interview to CTK since the president has assumed 
office (in January 1994)," Spacek told CTK, adding that "we can 
still leave the question open." 
  CTK has requested the presidents of other Central European 
states to grant it an interview before the Litomysl meeting. 
Some press offices answered in the affirmative or turned the 
request down, saying the head of state was busy.

  [Text] Prague, April 9 (CTK) -- President Vaclav Havel 
today signed the amendment to the labor law passed by the 
government last month, chairman of the Bohemian-Moravian Chamber 
of Trade Unions (CMKOS) Richard Falbr informed delegates of the 
First CMKOS Congress today. Jiri Sitler of the President's 
Office confirmed the information for CTK. 
  Sitler said the president would speak about his reasons for 
signing in more detail during his regular Sunday radio address 
tomorrow. 
  The congress had decided to ask President Vaclav Havel, 
through either a declaration, resolution or letter, not to sign 
the amendment into law. The deadline for signing the law was 
midnight tonight. 
  Frantisek Klima, chairman of the Union of Public Road 
Transportation, suggested the congress call a 10-15-minute 
general strike if Havel signed the law, but the new CMKOS 
chairman, Richard Falbr, rebuffed the idea, saying it was 
necessary as soon as possible "to establish order among 
ourselves." 
  "Don't expect this congress to call a general strike," he 
said. His words were met with applause from congress delegates. 
  Falbr said he had expected Havel to sign the law, since it 
would be difficult for him to defy the government coalition. 
  The parts of the amendment that most disturb the unions are 
those defining work agreements for fixed periods of time and 
regulating night shift work for pregnant women. On March 22, 
about 40,000 union members from throughout the country gathered 
on Prague's Old Town Square to protest the amendment. 
  Parliament passed the amendment the following day, vetoing 
all opposition amendments to the amendment.

  [Excerpt] Prague, April 10 (CTK) -- President Vaclav Havel 
did some explaining during his regular Sunday radio address 
today. He said that he had signed the new labor law amendment 
into law on Saturday because it did not hurt employees nor 
conflict with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms or 
any international agreements. 
  He said he'd received numerous letters asking him not to 
sign 
the law "from various unions, the Helsinki Committee, and other 
institutions," but decided he "could sign this law with a clean 
and peaceful conscience." 
  Union objections, he said, would unleash "mistrust in the 
independence, self-awareness, and responsibility of people, of 
employees," and added that collective agreements between 
employees and employers existed to further protect workers' 
rights. 
  Havel also pointed out that this was the 17th amendment to 
the labor law overall and already the tenth since November 1989, 
"so that if this or that one doesn't pass the test, it can be 
changed with the help of more amendments." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prague, April 11 (CTK) -- Leaders of the Czech 
Social Democratic Party (CSSD) presented its deputies with a 
recommendation to initiate a constitution-based revision of the 
employment law, Vojtech Matejicny from the CSSD press department 
told CTK today. 
  Before being passed by parliament, the employment bill was 
criticized by the unions who organized an Old Town Square 
demonstration on March 22 to highlight their reservations 
against the possibility of a repeated conclusion of 
limited-period work contracts and an article allowing pregnant 
women to work night shifts. 
  Parliament passed the bill the day after. The coalition and 
the Liberal Social National Party supported the bill while the 
opposition including the CSSD voted against it. Czech President 
Vaclav Havel signed the law on April 6.

  [Text] Prague, April 11 (CTK) -- The Civic Democratic 
Party (ODS) Executive Council, in a resolution adopted at its 
meeting today, confirmed its will to redress property wrongs 
inflicted on Jews who did not receive their property because of 
political changes in February 1948 and whose property currently 
belongs to the state, ODS Deputy Chairman Jan Strasky told 
journalists. 
  The Executive Council supports the adoption of a law to 
right 
the injustices inflicted on Jewish people, Strasky said. 
  He said that the Executive Council discussed a proposal by 
the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party 
(KDU-CSL) concerning the restitution of church property, 
currently in the state's possession. 
  The Council had asked ODS ministers and deputies to take a 
positive stand on such a bill provided an agreement on a 
limitation or restriction of restitutions of land and forests 
was achieved and that is was agreed that this bill would be the 
final one redressing property wrongs inflicted on the Church, 
Strasky said.

  [Text] Prague, April 11 (CTK) -- The Civic Democratic 
Party (ODS) Executive Council, at its meeting today, rejected a 
document submitted by Chairman of the Civic Democratic Alliance 
(ODA) Jan Kalvoda to ODS Chairman and Czech Premier Vaclav 
Klaus, ODS Deputy Chairman Petr Cermak told journalists. 
  The document to serve as a basis material for coalition 
talks 
on higher self-administrative units was bad and the ODS 
Executive Council was disappointed with it, Cermak said. 
  He said that the document "did not reflect things which had 
been long agreed upon" and was not acceptable to the ODS. The 
document "was conceptually empty, incomplete, not oriented 
towards the future and practically makes it possible for higher 
territorial administrative units to start functioning only 
around the year 2000," Cermak added. 
  If the political will to agree on the system of elections to 
the Senate, the as yet non-existent upper chamber of the Czech 
parliament, is shown, the ODS will not object to senatorial 
elections being held this autumn simultaneously with local 
elections, Cermak said. Judging by the state of preparation for 
the establishment of higher self-administrative units the ODS 
considered the elections to these units being held in 1996, as 
proposed by the ODA, unacceptable, he said.

  [Text] Prague, April 11 (CTK) -- The Executive Council of 
the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) is not pleased that the bill on 
the competences of higher local administrative units has not yet 
been put before the government, which is supposed to discuss it 
on Wednesday, ODS Deputy Chairman Jan Strasky said at a press 
conference today. 
  The relevant material, which Civic Democratic Alliance 
Chairman (ODA) Jan Kalvoda was to give to ODS Chairman Vaclav 
Klaus, was marked as party material and dated April 8, Strasky 
said. He added that the Executive Council was disturbed by the 
standard of the material's groundwork, which returned to 
alternatives which had already been considered and rejected. 
This was not in keeping with ODA's proclamations about setting 
up higher local administration units as soon as possible, 
Strasky said. 
  There is still room for improvement in coalition relations, 
and the ODS Executive Council is somewhat disturbed by the 
statements of several Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) 
representatives about the ODS, the party's Executive Deputy 
Chairman Petr Cermak said. 
  The Council had repeatedly stated that there was very little 
talk about the matters on which the four coalition parties 
agreed, and too much emphasis on the differences in opinion, 
Cermak said. 
  He had made "a very accommodating speech," as a guest at 
last 
weekend's ODA conference, he said, and believed that ODS was 
tending towards a conciliatory solution to relations. 
  The ODS Executive Council meeting is continuing late into 
the 
night, with election laws and the preparation of a law on the 
financing and activities of political parties on the agenda.

  [Text] Prague, April 10 (CTK) -- Defense Minister Antonin 
Baudys announced on NOVA TV today that had completed a list of 
former army "political officers" who, on the basis of a December 
1989 order by then Czechoslovak Defense Minister Miroslav Vacek, 
were "dispersed and camouflaged by a wide variety of methods" 
throughout the army. The list took six months to compile, 
Baudys said. 
  "A range of personnel measures are only now before us," he 
said, adding that 1994 would be the most significant year for 
the transformation of the armed forces. Units are finally being 
reorganized, at last creating "the right situation" for 
replacing some officers, he added. 
  Baudys also said the army was prepared to launch a 
recruiting 
campaign in search of leaders at the company and platoon level 
for drilling soldiers and strengthening discipline, especially 
in the handling of weapons.

  [Text] Prague, April 10 (CTK) -- Most of the expert 
reports and surveys commissioned by the Czech Television Council 
(RCT), as well as its own observations shows that Czech 
Television (CT) provides government politicians with more air 
time than it is usual in standard democracies, the RCT annual 
report for 1993 says. 
  This stems from the fact that "the activity of government 
representatives is very important and interesting from viewers' 
point of view" and "in a number of important political, 
economic, and social issues no independent experts and observers 
exist," states the report, which was submitted to the parliament 
this week. Therefore, their role is taken by government 
officials or even ministers, the report adds. 
  Further causes are that recently most opposition parties 
have 
been dealing with internal problems and that controversial views 
exist even within the coalition, the report states. 
  "The RCT does not consider the current state to be optimal," 
the report says. However, it is possible to say that 
objectivity in news coverage has increased, while the occurrence 
of concealed commentaries within the news reports has declined. 
The work of foreign correspondents has improved as well, the 
report says. 
  CT holds a unique position in the production of original 
dramatic programs for adults, the report notes. "For long years 
to come, no private TV company will be able to produce what the 
CT can make in a single year," the report says, specifying that 
the CT has produced 63 premieres of feature films, shown seven 
theater performances, and 11 serials. 
  CT shows were watched by 85 percent of the Czech Republic's 
population, the report says. Virtually every adult person 
watched CT, while the largest interest focused on CT 1 channel 
(79 percent of viewers). Forty-nine percent watched CT 2, and 
11 percent CT 3. People aged 50-59 watch the most CT. 
  The decline in watching CT recorded in 1992 stopped in the 
second half of 1993, while the degree of satisfaction with 
broadcast shows has increased, the report says.

  [Text] Brno, April 8 (CTK) -- In terms of the gross 
domestic product and industrial production, the Czech Republic 
has overcome "the biggest decline and we can basically speak of 
potential prospects of economic growth," Czech Minister of 
Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy said today. 
  Taking part in a discussion meeting with university students 
in Brno, he said "the decline of GDP was 14.2 percent in 1991, 
7.1 percent in 1992 and 0.3 percent last year, while this year 
we expect growth of around 2 percent." 
  Dlouhy said that "we can expect inflation to be under 10 
percent" this year. He stressed that the Czech Republic in this 
point differed from other post-Communist economies, including 
Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. 
  Dlouhy also said that European Community countries had 20 
percent share in the Czech Republic's exports at the end of the 
1980s, while last year the figure was 55 percent and this year 
it may reach 60 percent. 
  He attributed the figures to the fact that a number of 
companies had managed to find new markets and at the same time 
penetrate "hard world markets, when the soft, socialist ones, 
simply disappeared."

  [Text] Prague, April 11 (CTK) -- Confidence in the 
president, government, and parliament is stable, according to a 
March poll of 885 individuals by the Institute for Public 
Opinion Research (IVVM). 
  The poll showed 69 percent of respondents having confidence 
in President Vaclav Havel, the same percentage as in December 
1993 and three percent more than in January 1994. Confidence in 
the government registered at 57 percent in March, up from 56 in 
December and 53 in January. 
  Only 25 percent expressed confidence in parliament's work; 
still that was up from a mere 20 percent in December and 21 
percent in January. 
  The March poll also showed no difference in results between 
Bohemia and Moravia, or between cities and the countryside. 
Differences showed up between white and blue collar employees: 
The former generally expressed higher levels of confidence. 
  The greatest differences, however, showed up in a breakdown 
by respondents' political party affiliation. The greatest 
confidence in the president, government, and parliament was 
expressed by supporters of the (coalition) Civic Democratic 
Party (ODS), with 93, 87 and 44 percent respectively. The least 
confidence (23-18-2 percent) was expressed by Left Bloc (LB) and 
Communist Party (KSCM) voters. 
  In between, 77, 77, and 25 percent of voters for the 
(coalition) Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) expressed confidence 
in the three institutions, while confidence dropped to 44-37-15 
percent among voters for the Czech Social Democratic Party 
(CSSD).

  [Text] Plzen, April 8 (CTK) -- The Plzen district court 
today sentenced former Federal and Security Information Service 
(FBIS) employee Vaclav Wallis to 37 months' unconditional 
imprisonment for selling secret information from the FBIS to 
former Harvard Investment Funds director Viktor Kozeny. 
  The sentence is to be carried out in a prison with the 
second 
highest security level. The verdict has not yet taken effect, 
and the accused and the state attorney are still able to appeal 
against it. 
  Justifying the verdict, Judge Premysl Spicar said that by 
betraying state secrets in 1992, Wallis committed two crimes -- 
that of threatening state secrets and abusing public office. 
  Despite the objections of the defense, the court said Wallis 
was a public servant, although it did not uphold the claim of 
the prosecution that by abuse of public office Wallis had caused 
particularly serious consequences. Thus the court finally gave 
a lower sentence than that asked for by the state attorney, who 
in his closing speech had proposed that Wallis be imprisoned for 
6.5 years.

  [Text] Prague, April 11 (CTK) -- Environment Minister 
Frantisek Benda rejected the possibility that the Temelin 
nuclear power station could be brought into operation before an 
"atomic law" is adopted. 
  "I still consider the preparation of an atomic law to be a 
condition for the licensing process for the Temelin power plant 
to be initiated," he said on the Nova television station. 
  Nova claimed information given by the State Office for 
Atomic 
Safety (SUJB) in a government hearing cast doubt on the date the 
south Bohemian plant is due to be brought into operation. That 
report "confirms the caution I have been trying to push for with 
regard to the total nuclear energy programme," Benda said. 
  If no atomic law existed he would oppose the operation of 
Temelin, he said. 
  The process of loading fuel into Temelin's reactors is 
scheduled to begin at the end of 1994 and by mid 1995 the first 
reactor should be working at full performance. The second 
reactor should be brought on line in 1996. The completed plant 
is expected to produce 2,000 MW.

  [Text] Prague, April 7 (CTK) -- Prime Minister Vaclav 
Klaus met today former Prime Minister of the Serbo-Montenegrin 
Yugoslavia Milan Panic who is consulting his concept of the 
post-war economic reconstruction of former Yugoslavia on his 
trip to some European states and the United States. 
  Asked whether he contemplates a come-back to high politics, 
Panic replied he still considered himself a politician. He 
added that the countries of former Yugoslavia needed a new 
generation of young ambitious politicians. 
  Panic said he was, indeed, acquainted with the affair 
regarding his alleged letter to former Slovak Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar in which he had allegedly refused Meciar's offer 
for weapons to former Yugoslavia. He stressed that he had not 
written the letter, and that the speculations of this sort were 
absurd. 
  Panic's visit includes meetings with Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec and Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy.

  [Text] Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry 
denounces Wednesday's [6 April] massacre in the north Israeli 
town of Afula in which innocent people, including women and 
children, were killed, says a statement given to CTK today. 
  The militant Islamic organization Hamas said in its 
statement 
the Afula attack was retaliation for the massacre in Hebron in 
the occupied West Bank in February in which a Jewish extremist 
shot dead 29 Palestinians. The Afula massacre claimed the lives 
of seven people and of the attacker himself, and 50 people were 
wounded. 
  The Ministry "is opposed on principle to the solution of 
problems by the use of violence and terrorist actions which only 
aggravate the situation in the Middle East," the statement says 
and expresses support for political settlement on the basis of 
dialogue. 
  "The Israeli-Palestine agreement the implementation of which 
has been the subject of intensive negotiations indicates a 
suitable way of solving the situation," the statement says.

  [Text] Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- Israel and its defense 
industry are among serious applicants for close cooperation with 
the Czech Republic, Defense Minister Antonin Baudys told 
journalists today. 
  "We bear in mind that the Israeli military industry is 
state-of-the-art," said Baudys who met Israeli deputies Orri Orr 
and Moshe Nissim today. However, it would be premature to speak 
about concrete cooperation in this field, he added. 
  Baudys discussed army modernization, relations between armed 
forces and parliament, military buildup and acquiring public 
confidence with the Israeli deputies. 
  "The meeting was very useful" because Orr is a former senior 
Israeli military officer "with a very successful military record 
so that he can consider the problems both from the military and 
parliamentary views," Baudys stated. 
  Orr and Nissim, who arrived in the Czech Republic for a 
one-week visit on April 4, also met the Federation of Jewish 
Communities.

  [Text] Prague, April 11 (CTK) -- Questions of economic 
integration and European security were the main topics discussed 
by visiting members of the Finnish Parliament's Foreign Affairs 
Committee and their Czech colleagues at their meeting today, 
Pertti Paasio, chairman of the Finnish Parliament's Foreign 
Committee, told CTK after the talks. 
  Paasio said that the Czech Republic, given its interest in 
joining NATO, had a somewhat different idea about its security 
than Finland, which did not see participation in a military 
grouping as its way to security. "The roles of our countries in 
the Partnership for Peace project are therefore somewhat 
different but the two countries will be complementing each 
other," he said. 
  Paasio said that within the Partnership Finland was sharing 
its experiences with United Nations peace-keeping operations but 
did not intend to participate in joint military exercises of the 
countries which participate in the project. 
  Paasio mentioned similar efforts of Finland and the Czech 
Republic at approaching the European Union (EU) and achieving 
full membership of European economic structures in the long run. 
He voiced the hope that trade between Finland and the Czech 
Republic would be more extended in the future that it has been 
before.

  [Text] Prague, April 11 (CTK) -- Loic Bouvard, chairman of 
the North Atlantic Assembly (NAA), and Peter Corterier, NAA 
secretary, are convinced that the Czech Republic should have 
"differentiated status" within the Partnership for Peace 
programme, in comparison to some other post-communist countries, 
which are "less fit for integration". 
  They said they considered the Partnership for Peace a step 
towards full NATO membership, Czech Deputy Chairman Jan Kalvoda 
told journalists after his meeting today with the two 
representatives, who arrived in Prague on Sunday [10 April]. 
  Kalvoda quoted Corterier as saying he had registered "more 
accommodating stances" towards the Czech Republic's admission to 
NATO in parliaments of NATO member countries than on the level 
of NATO representatives. Kalvoda refused to specify which the 
countries "less fit for integration" were, according the guests 
from the NAA, saying that no Czech Republic's direct neighbor 
was among them. 
  He said he had discussed with the NAA representatives the 
ways of Czech Republic's coping with the infiltration of the 
exponents of the former, communist regime in the new democratic 
structures. Asked by CTK in this connection, Kalvoda said that 
he considered the passage of the screening law a correct 
legitimate act. However, he added he was personally 
dissatisfied with judicial punishments for concrete wrongdoing. 
  "The principle of individual responsibility could be applied 
to more people," Kalvoda said, stressing that the issue was 
fully in the courts' jurisdiction. 
  The Screening Law, adopted by the Czechoslovak parliament in 
1991, bans from high government and economic posts until 1996 
peopled linked to the former communist StB secret police, 
Communist Party officials and members of the People's Militia. 
  Bouvard and Corterier today also met with Czech Economics 
Minister Karel Dyba. Dyba informed journalists after the 
meeting that he had discussed with the NAA guests mainly the 
economic situation in the Czech Republic and the country's 
relations towards the European Union and NATO.

  [Text] Budapest, 11 Apr (MTI) -- During his trip to Fejer 
county today, the prime minister was at a press conference where 
he was asked whether the AWACS aircraft would have to leave 
Hungary after NATO's Sunday attack on Bosnian Serb positions. 
  The reporter reminded the prime minister of his statement 
made in February to foreign journalists -- that Hungary would 
not like NATO's aircraft to use its airspace when bombing 
military targets in Bosnia. The prime minister was also quoted 
as saying that during an air attack the AWACS aircraft should 
leave the country. 
  "Hungary's airspace has not been used for military actions 
against Bosnian targets. And this is the key issue," the prime 
minister said in his answer. 
  The February statement expressed Hungary's determination not 
to allow its airspace to be used for concrete military actions 
or controlling attacks on Serbia, he continued. 
  "We have received clear-cut guarantees that the function of 
the AWACS aircraft will be only to monitor Bosnian airspace," 
the prime minister added.

  [Text] Budapest, 11 Apr (MTI) -- NATO's attacks against 
Serbian military positions in Gorazde served peace not war and 
the Bosnian Serbs will hopefully take the warning seriously 
enough to return to the negotiating table, Hungarian Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszenszky told the press in Los Angeles today. 
  Hungary's involvement in controlling no-fly zones in Bosnia, 
which is based on a UN mandate, has to be separated from NATO 
actions in Sarajevo and Gorazde. The latter manoeuvres were 
governed by other Security Council resolutions, and had nothing 
to do with AWACS surveillance flights over Hungary, the minister 
said. 
  In reply to MTI, Jeszenszky said he welcomed all steps that 
promote a political solution and, at the same time, warn 
aggressive forces. 
  He expressed the hope that the action would contribute to a 
political settlement, which started with the Croat-Muslim 
agreement. 
  Asked about the position of the Russian government, 
Jeszenszky said Moscow had to be aware that such action might 
occur. 
  The minister expressed the hope that Moscow would continue 
to 
cooperate with the United States and the United Nations in 
settling the Yugoslav crisis. 
  He recalled that Russian policy had played a useful role in 
Bosnian mediation over the past few months. He added that peace 
in Bosnia is as much a Russian interest as that of the Unites 
States, Hungary and Bosnia itself.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 11 -- Feasible cooperation between the 
Polish defence system and NATO is the most important issue. If 
that occures Poland's membership of NATO will be a formal 
confirmation of the existing state of affairs, Foreign Minister 
Andrzej Olechowski told journalists following Monday's meeting 
with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. 
  According to the Polish minister, the visit of Mr. Talbott 
in 
Poland has rather not changed anything in Polish-American 
relations. "I do not see substantial changes in relation to what 
I heard three months ago," Olechowski said. 
  He stressed that Polish presentation document stipulating 
proposals and possibilities for Poland's cooperation within the 
framework of the "Partnership for Peace" programme, to be 
presented soon, is being welcomed warmly. The minister said 
that Poland has various proposals of cooperation but declined to 
disclose details. He added that President Bill Clinton's July 
visit to Warsaw was also discussed at the Foreign Ministry. 
  Strobe Talbott, asked by journalists when Poland is to 
become 
NATO member, replied that the Partnership for Peace programme is 
a path leading to NATO and stressed the determination of the 
Polish side to actively participate in the programme.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 11 -- U.S. Deputy Secretary of State 
Strobe Talbott told a Monday press conference, summing up his 
official visit to Poland, that the American administration 
supports Polish reforms and will back the introduction of Polish 
goods to Western markets. He said that the United States are 
proud of their contribution to Poland's success and stressed 
that they are the biggest foreign investor in Poland. 
  Talbott disclosed that apart from issues related to economy 
his talks focused on Poland's efforts to enter the European 
security structures. The American politician added that the 
"Partnership for Peace" programme is a way leading to NATO but 
added that the date of Poland's admittance into the organization 
remains an open question. 
  Talbott expressed the conviction that Poland appreciated the 
significance of her participation in the "Partnership for Peace" 
programme. He explained that the programme aims at stepping up 
Poland's integration with NATO and that the creation of 
mechanisms allowing for the transition from the era of divisions 
and competition to the era of integration and cooperation 
remains at the foundation of the programme. 
  Talbott recalled that Poland's security and independence of 
other countries of eastern and central Europe are of special 
significance for the United States. He stressed that the 
American administration was of the opinion that there can be no 
spheres of influence in this part of Europe and the countries in 
this region should maintain equal-footing relations, 
irrespective of their potential.

<F P=106> [Report by Veselin Yankov: "Bulgaria, Poland Sign Important </F>
Documents"] 
  [Text] Warsaw, April 11 (BTA) -- Bulgarian-Polish 
relations will continue to develop on a broad, balanced basis 
along the principles of cooperation for the mutual benefit. The 
official visit to Warsaw by Bulgaria's Foreign Minister 
Stanislav Daskalov ended on this note. He arrived here last 
night at the invitation of his Polish counterpart Andrzej 
Olechowski. 
  The two foreign ministers signed a consular agreement, an 
agreement on the avoidance of double taxation and an agreement 
on reciprocal investment protection and promotion. 
  President Lech Walesa received Mr. Daskalov to discuss a 
wide 
range of international issues, more specifically the two 
countries' relations with the European Union and the crisis in 
the former Yugoslavia. They agreed that bilateral political 
contacts are very good and economic cooperation should be 
intensified on this basis. 
  Mr. Daskalov conveyed an invitation by Bulgaria's President 
Zhelyu Zhelev to President Walesa to make an official visit to 
Bulgaria. 
  Mr. Daskalov met with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak to 
discuss steps to expand trade and settle Bulgaria's debt to 
Poland dating to the time of the COMECON. It was said that a 
free trade zone could be set up in the near future. 
  Mr. Daskalov held meetings with leaders of the Ministry for 
Foreign Economic Cooperation, the Polish Chamber of Commerce and 
the Senate. The Bulgarian delegation laid a wreath at the 
Monument to the Unknown Warrior in Warsaw.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 11 -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister 
Stanislav Daskalov, on an official visit to Poland, met Monday 
with Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski to sign economic 
agreements on the protection and support for investments and on 
avoiding double taxation. According to Olechowski the delayed 
signing of the documents testifies to poor economic relations 
between the two countries. 
  The ministers also discussed international issues. Stanislav 
Daskalov also met with President Lech Walesa to discuss 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  "For many years we used to be in one political and economic 
camp so certain ties and cooperation were established. Now, 
when we are reforming our countries, I think that we should 
return to some questions," the president told the Bulgarian 
guest. 
  According to Walesa, Poland and Bulgaria should make joint 
efforts to create the vision of the new Europe. 
  Daskalov said that Poland and Bulgaria have common 
goals--the 
integration with the European communities. He also conveyed the 
invitation of President Zelyu Zelev for Lech Walesa to visit 
Bulgaria. 
  The Bulgarian guest and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
discussed problems connected with the development of 
Polish-Bulgarian economic and trade contacts, including the 
liquidation of trade barriers and the establishing of free trade 
zones. The two sides stressed that efforts to integrate with 
Europe should not replace bilateral agreements. 
  Pawlak stressed that the boosting of economic cooperation 
between Poland and Bulgaria would allow to overcome obstacles 
which had existed in contacts between the two countries in the 
past. 
  Minister Daskalov stressed that Bulgaria will continue to 
repay its debt to Poland with deliveries of goods. He added 
that there are chances for the debt being settled later this 
year. "Our economies are complementary," said Daskalov. 
  The prime minister and the visiting Bulgarian foreign 
minister also touched upon the questions of Macedonia and the 
conflict in the former Yugoslavia. 
  In another development, Daskalov met with under-secretary of 
state at the ministry for foreign economic relations Maciej 
Lesny to discuss the opportunities to boost economic cooperation 
between the two countries. 
  Later in the day, Minister Daskalov met with deputy Senate 
speaker Zofia Kuratowska to touch upon the questions of European 
integration and adjusting Polish and Bulgarian legislations to 
the European Union standards.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 11 (CTK) -- Europe needs a new 
"vision of openness" to solve many of its present problems, 
similar to the era of "Renaissance, free trade and states 
without borders", Polish President Lech Walesa said in an 
interview with CTK today. 
  Among topics discussed at the meeting of the seven Central 
European presidents on Friday [8 April] and Saturday would be 
"how today, at the end of the 20th century, we can build a new 
`amber road' for people, ideas and goods from the Adriatic along 
the Odra River to the Baltic," Walesa said. 
  Walesa will be attending the meeting, to take place in the 
east Bohemian town of Litomysl, along with the presidents of the 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Austria, Hungary and 
Slovenia. He hopes the two-day event will open new prospects 
for European unity and kick off debate on the matter, he said. 
  The countries of the Visegrad Four -- Poland, the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia and Hungary -- have justified the existence 
of the group, he said: They have rid themselves of foreign 
soldiers, they have established close ties with the European 
Union, signed the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) 
and joined the Partnership for Peace project. "It could be 
asked: What would have happened if there hadn't been the 
Visegrad group?" he said. 
  When asked for his views on Polish-Czech relations, he said 
the two countries had many aims and activities in common and 
managed to conduct good neighborly cooperation. "On Good Friday 
half a million Czechs crossed the border at Tesin. It delights 
us that they have reason to come," he said. 
  At the same time many bad facets and absurdities remain in 
bilateral relations, remnants of the former communist regimes. 
"People telephone across the border by means of an international 
exchange; in a number of border towns the communal network has 
been artificially divided by the border," Walesa said. Despite 
this "border regions are prospering and trade is picking up," he 
said. 
  Besides cooperation in the border regions, Poland and the 
Czech Republic should in his opinion carry out more joint 
projects. "That is the task of governments, which are already 
working on it," he said. "The possibility of contacts between 
the peoples, momentous in our history, allows negative 
stereotypes of Czechs and Poles to be overcome. All this allows 
us to talk about a new page in our relations and in the history 
of uniting Europe," Walesa said.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 11 -- Presidential press spokesman 
Andrzej Drzycimski said Monday that President Lech Walesa would 
be willing to meet representatives of the government coalition 
if a new candidate for the post of finance minister was put 
forward. 
  He added that the coalition should look at matters anew and 
consider a new approach to the problem of who is to replace 
Marek Borowski as finance minister. President Walesa has 
already refused to accept the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati from 
Premier Waldemar Pawlak. 
  Asked whether Walesa had finally decided whether or not to 
sign the budget law, Drzycimski replied, "The president still 
has time for this under the Constitution, he is considering the 
matter." 
  According to the "small" interim Constitution the president 
signs a law within 30 days after it has been presented to him 
having been passed by both houses of parliament. According to 
Andrzej Gliniecki from the legal office at the president's 
chancellery, the budget law was presented to Walesa on March 28.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 9 -- Leader of the Confederation for 
an Independent Poland (KPN) Leszek Moczulski said during a 
meeting of the KPN Political Council on Saturday that KPN, 
despite press reports, is not facing a split. He stressed there 
are various options within the KPN leadership, adding that he 
even believes the differences are too small as similar views 
result in similar proposals of solutions. 
  The KPN leader also said that if Lech Walesa does not sign 
the 1994 budget, KPN will support this decision. "We are the 
only parliamentary caucus which asked the president not to sign 
the budget law," he added. 
  In the opinion of its members, KPN is a uniform political 
force whose isolation has been caused by the KPN decision not to 
be engaged in alignments which would be incompatible with the 
KPN programme. 
  While addressing the meeting, Political Council Member 
Krzysztof Kaminski sharply criticized the press for reporting on 
the alleged split in the KPN. 
  Moczulski is the unquestionable KPN leader and a candidate 
for president, Kaminski said. The KPN leader confirmed he would 
run in the next presidential elections. 
  At the end of the meeting, heads of the KPN regional 
organizations presented reports concerning preparations for 
local government elections. They said the KPN was setting up 
coalitions with centre-right parties in numerous provinces. 
  Leader of the KPN parliamentary caucus Krzysztof Krol 
stressed that members of regional chapters of centre and 
right-wing parties were much more responsible than their 
leaderships, and added that this provided a chance for winning 
the common struggle.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 8/4/1994 -- Geza Entz, member of 
the Hungarian Government, paid his Romanian visit in spite of 
the fact that the Romanian Foreign Ministry was emphatic about 
abstaining from this until Romanian authorities agreed. "It is 
regrettable that the Hungarian dignitary chose to ignore the 
Romanian authorities", said Ambassador Traian Chebeleu during a 
news conference on 8 April, in answering a ROMPRES question. 
  Referring to the same aspect, the presidential spokesman 
showed that the Romanian authorities were worried by that 
gesture "that accounts for a very serious brake in the efforts 
to normalize the Romanian-Hungarian relations and conclude the 
basic treaty between the two countries," as the Budapest 
official's behaviour defied the principles of inter-state 
relations. 
  Referring to the pardoning of the ethnic Hungarians involved 
in the crimes at Zetea and Dealu, Harghita County, presidential 
spokesman Traian Chebeleu said it was not complete. It was made 
in such a way as to have the convicts eligible for parole while 
the final decision would be made in keeping with the existing 
procedures by the local court. 
  As regarded the treaty envisaged to be concluded with the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Ambassador Chebeleu said it was 
part of Romania's policy of equal treatment of all states in the 
territory of former Yugoslavia. 
  The statement of Moldovan Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli, 
who 
did not name Romania among the countries that gave the Republic 
of Moldova support, accusing it instead of failure to fulfil its 
obligations, was termed as "ununderstandable" by Traian Chebeleu 
who said the Romanian authorities waited for "the necessary 
explanation" that would be requested through the Romanian 
Embassy in Chisinau. 
  The spokesman also said President Ion Iliescu was 
represented 
at the funeral of playwright Eugen Ionesco by Romania's 
Ambassador in Paris, Anton Vatasescu. 
  Requested to deny or confirm an alleged meeting between 
President Slobodan Milosevic and American General George Joulwan 
during the Serb head of state's stay in Bucharest, Ambassador 
Traian Chebeleu definitely denied it: "The meeting did not and 
could not occur because of President Milosevic's very busy 
schedule, he said. [no closing quotation mark as received] 
  Romanian President Ion Iliescu will pay a state visit to 
France over 14-11 April, 1994, presidential spokesman Traian 
Chebeleu also announced in his news conference. 
  The schedule of the visit includes, apart from talks with 
President Mitterrand, an interview with Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur, meetings with Senate President Rene Monory and 
President of the National Assembly Philippe Seguin, with other 
politicians. 
  He is also expected to meet at the National Council of the 
French Employers with representatives of business circles and to 
visit the GEC-Alsthom works. 
  The presidential spokesman assessed the visit was "a natural 
moment in the evolution of the Romanian-French relations after 
the revolution and at the same time it is meant to boost them." 
Stressing that in the four years after the revolution France has 
given Romania decisive support in its efforts for rapprochement 
and integration in the bodies of the European democratic states, 
Ambassador Traian Chebeleu highlighted that Romania's president 
attached great importance to the forthcoming political 
consultations with France, that would cover a wide area of 
issues, from ways to further develop the bilateral relations and 
the speeding up of Romania's integration in the European 
institutions to the current questions of security in our zone 
and in Europe generally. 
  The visit will have also an important economic dimension, 
the 
result of which we hope to be an ever more significant presence 
of the French companies in the Romanian economy, the 
presidential spokesman said.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/4/1994 -- Romania's national 
defense doctrine and the training of the Romanian peace-keeping 
unit were among the issues approached at the Romanian Defense 
Ministry's first weekly press conference, on Friday [8 April] in 
Bucharest. 
  Romania's national defense doctrine is based on the 
principle 
of defense sufficiency during peace-time, said the defense 
ministry spokeswoman, Major Elena Olariu, who is the first woman 
to hold that office in the history of the Romanian Armed Forces. 
The doctrine provides that Romania will never attack another 
state. For the situations when Romania could be the target of 
an aggression, the doctrine provides for reactions based on the 
principle of omnidirectional defense. The defense doctrine is 
going to be discussed on Monday [11 April] by Romania's Supreme 
Defense Council, together with all the other documents 
concerning the whole concept of national security. 
  The Romanian peace-keeping unit, established on 15 July 
1993, 
is now in an advanced stage of preparations, a fact appreciated 
also by General George Joulwan, the supreme commander of the 
Allied Forces in Europe. The unit comprises one staff company, 
three infantry companies, one millimeters-caliber thrower 
battery, one anti-tank artillery battery, one mixed 
anti-aircraft artillery battery, and a logistics sub-unit. 
  Romania is currently contributing to the U.N. missions with 
the following military: Six watchers in Iraq-Kuwait, six 
watchers in Rwanda ("no bad news about them at the time being," 
Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu said on Friday after 
his meeting with Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes,) and 136 
people with the Romanian military hospital in Somalia (where the 
tide of patients is rising and stronger security measures have 
been taken after the departure of the U.S., German, and Italian 
troops.) 
  The defense ministry spokeswoman said also that the ministry 
had nine officers sent for studies in the U.S.A., six in the 
United Kingdom, six in France, and five in Germany.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/4/1994 -- Romania's President 
Ion Iliescu presided on April 11 a meeting of the country's 
Supreme Defence Council. Two drafts were examined and initialed 
on the occasion, namely "The Integrated Outlook of Romanian 
National Security" and "Romania's Military Defence Doctrine." 
  The former includes the fundamental tenets, objectives and 
trends defining the general policy of security of Romania. The 
latter has been drafted with observance of the provisions of 
Romania's Constitution and laws, the basic principles, 
objectives and guiding lines of the security policy of the 
Romanian state, the current stage and the tendencies of the 
political-military affairs at a world, continental and regional 
scale, risks and threats that appear as likely against Romania's 
national interests, the short- and middle-term evolution of the 
country's military integration with the European and 
Euro-Atlantic security structures. 
  The country's Supreme Defense Council decided that the two 
documents be referred to parliament for endorsement. 
  The agenda included debates and approval of a draft 
"Presentation Document: Romania," written by the Romanian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Romania's Ministry of National 
Defence, in consequence of Romania's joining the "Partnership 
for Peace" plan. The document includes the measures proposed by 
Romania, necessary for fulfilment of the political objectives of 
the Partnership and the aspects of military character or of 
other type that Romania can made available for NATO, which is 
going to be forwarded the draft. 
  Romania reasserts in the document its determination to be 
faithful to all the principles and targets of the "Partnership 
for Peace" to the assertions in the "Declaration of the Heads of 
States and Governments Who Attended the Sitting of the 
North-Atlantic Council Held in Brussels on January 10-11, 1994." 
  Political and organisation measures have been enlisted in 
the 
document intended to secure a democratic control on the Army and 
facilitate transparency in planning national defence and 
drafting the budget, fields of cooperation, human and logistic 
resources that Romania can contribute to the Partnership for 
Peace plan.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/4/1994 -- Several leaders of 
the opposition parties making up the Democratic Convention of 
Romania [CDR] expressed at a press conference on Saturday, 9 
April, their decision to use all possibilities offered by the 
present political situation in order to prevent early elections. 
  Ion Diaconescu (National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party 
-- PNTCD), Dinu Patriciu (Liberal Party '93 -- PL '93), Attila 
Verestoy (Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania -- UDMR), 
and Nicolae Taran (Civic Alliance Party -- PAC) maintained that 
the time for theoretical discussions had passed and that 
concrete solutions were necessary. They claimed the opposition 
had these solutions to offer. 
  Dinu Patriciu said that the dialogue with the ruling party 
[Social Democracy Party of Romania -- PDSR] could resume only if 
the Vacaroiu cabinet resigned. The representatives of the CDR 
member parties concluded that they could resume the dialogue 
with the ruling party if PDSR understood "it is not the 
country's master but its servant." 
  CDR leader Emil Constantinescu presented to the press 
conference a "Manifesto for Romania's Salvation," whereby the 
CDR suggests several measures termed as "simple and efficient," 
meant to boost Romania's recovery from the crisis caused by "a 
incompetent and corrupt" government. 
  Considering themselves rightful to fight by any legal and 
democratic means for the nation's rescue, the CDR member parties 
call for: A "tough and fair" justice able to stop corruption; 
the allotment to the local administration of at least 18 percent 
of the taxes paid by the population; the cancellation of the 
farm taxes and the finalization of the process of granting the 
property title deeds; jobs to be created through investments and 
privatization; social protection for the youth, unemployed, and 
underprivileged; increased budgetary funds allotted to 
education, health, and culture; the Armed Forces' endowment to 
strengthen the defense capacity; and integration within the 
Euro-Atlantic structures and a stop to the slide toward other 
spheres of influence.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/4/1994 -- The government's 
daily VOCEA ROMANIEI writes in a comment on the recent visit in 
Bucharest of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic that Romania 
has recently launched a diplomatic offensive in the Balkans," 
starting from its position of stability in the area and its 
yearnings to reach a mediator's status. 
  "Preceded by meetings with dignitaries from neighbouring 
states, such as the presidents of Croatia, Turkey and Greece, to 
be soon followed by the visit of Bosnia's president, the 
presence of Milosevic in Bucharest is a confirmation of 
Romania's being a centre of stability in the Balkans, that it 
has a chance to make a step forward on the political scene, with 
good consequences for the Romanian diplomacy, adds the daily. 
  Even if the area of conflict has shrunk to former 
Yugoslavia, 
one cannot underestimate the conflict that could readily 
encompass other states. Potential hotbeds also exist between 
Greece and Turkey, Greece and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia], Albania and the present Republic of 
Yugoslavia, that includes the province of Kosovo, 90 percent of 
whose population is formed by Albanians, who also claim 
autonomy, adds VOCEA ROMANIEI. 
  The commentator analyses Russia's position in the area: 
"With 
its roads to the West cut short, Russia looks at the Balkans, as 
it has always done in such situations, where it has always found 
good ground for its pan-Slavic tendencies. As a matter of fact, 
following the agreement between Bosnia's Croats and Muslims, 
backed by Washington and far from being unknown to Moscow, 
Western political analysts do not refrain from calling the peace 
negotiations in Bosnia, with the involvement of the White House 
and the Kremlin, "a small-scale Yalta." Everybody knows what 
Yalta was for Romania. What we don't know is what it can mean 
this time, that is why we think the recent diplomatic offensive 
of Romania to be welcome," concludes VOCEA ROMANIEI.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 6/4/1994 -- American General 
George Joulwan, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces of 
Europe, said on 6 April in Bucharest that there was clear will 
with the NATO to back Romania and the Partnership for Peace 
would be paralleled by a "Partnership for Prosperity", the two 
elements being considered as guarantees of lasting stability. 
The general, now on a visit in Romania, met with Prime Minister 
Nicolae Vacaroiu. 
  The main issue discussed was Romania's adhesion to the 
Partnership for Peace and the prospects of the country's full 
integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures. The Romanian 
premier stressed that Romania's foreign policy laid stress on 
the development of the relations with the NATO and all its 
member states, an orientation backed by all political forces of 
the country. Referring to the military domain, the premier 
integrated the specialty problems in the general picture of the 
country's economic situation, stressing that, although 
administrating an austerity budget, the Romanian Government was 
ready to back financially, more than in the past years, the 
process of reorganization and updating of the Army. 
  "The main issue the Army is facing is the lack of financial 
resources and specialty technical assistance, domains in which 
the NATO support would be very efficient," the Romanian premier 
added.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 7/4/1994 -- Romanian Premier 
Nicolae Vacaroiu and Turkish Minister of the Interior Nahit 
Mentese met on Thursday in Bucharest to discuss general issues 
of the relations between Romania and Turkey as well as some 
specific issues concerning the interior ministries of the two 
countries. 
  In the context of the cooperation between the two interior 
ministries in fighting against drugs and firearms trafficking, 
crime and terrorism, the collocutors agreed that the way actions 
are conducted in this sector impinge on the achievement of a 
proper climate for the development of each country as well as of 
the bilateral relations. 
  Approaching the general frame of the Romanian-Turkish 
relations, Premier Vacaroiu underlined the fact that many 
possibilities existed that they further develop, including 
through joint companies to operate on third markets. Sharing in 
the opinion, the Turkish guest remarked the increasing interest 
in Romania showed lately by important Turkish companies. He 
expressed also the hope that the recent economic measures taken 
by the Turkish Government would prove attractive also for 
Romanian businessmen.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 8/4/1994 -- After significant 
contacts with Romanian officials and a concert at Radio Hall 
conducted by Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, the chief 
diplomat was received by Romanian president Ion Iliescu on 8 
April at the Cotroceni Palace. 
  Summing up his discussion with the Romanian head of state 
and 
other officials, Willy Claes said that the political statement 
he signed in Bucharest offered a framework "comprehensive 
enough" to allow for the development of relations, especially 
legal and economic. The Belgian foreign minister said that when 
there are sufficient guarantees of stability in Romania, Belgian 
investors would not hesitate to do business in Romania. 
  The same day, the Belgian foreign minister had an interview 
with Chamber of Deputies Speaker Adrian Nastase, during which he 
said Western Europe did not intend to treat countries in Central 
and Eastern Europe differently than any others. 
  Minister Willy Claes had to cut his Romanian visit short 
because of recent events in Rwanda which cost the lives of 
several Belgian UN officers stationed in that country. He left 
Romania in the afternoon of April 8.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 8 (CTK) -- The time for the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the former governing 
party, is irrevocably past and after the next elections the 
Slovak political scene will resemble the classic European form, 
Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac told CTK today. 
  He said a movement that combines left-wing, right-wing, 
centrist and nationalist streams can only work when there is a 
common aim. Such was the case of Civic Forum and Public Against 
Violence whose unifying aim was getting rid of communism after 
the Velvet Revolution of 1989. Another such unifying aim was 
Slovak independence. Once these goals are achieved, the big 
movements fall apart, he said. 
  "The aim now in Slovakia's prosperity and ideas on how to 
achieve it differ. Differing views can be contained in a 
coalition but not in a single party... that is the fate of the 
HZDS," he said. "If a broad movement wants to go one way it 
needs a very authoritarian and autocratic policy, concentrated 
on the person of the leader. This is the path chosen by the 
HZDS," Roman Kovac said, referring to HZDS chairman and former 
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. 
  Kovac himself was former deputy prime minister and deputy 
chairman of the HZDS before being expelled from the party for 
what Meciar called "betrayal." He was later instrumental in 
Meciar's downfall. 
  Kovac said he believed the creation of the current coalition 
-- comprising the left, centrist groups of "dissidents" from the 
HZDS and the right-leaning Christian Democrats -- will help 
crystalline the political scene. After the September general 
elections he expects the emergence of classic centrist, left and 
right parties. 
  Referring to a recent poll conducted after the no-confidence 
vote toppled the Meciar government but showing the HZDS was 
still the most popular party with a quarter of the respondents 
backing it, Kovac said "in Slovakia as in every other state 
there is a group of radical citizens who long for an autocratic 
style of government as a solution to problems. They vote 
Vladimir Meciar. The HZDS bloc will definitely get into 
parliament... but the time for broad movements is past," he told 
CTK. 
  Assuming the HZDS gets into parliament but does not win an 
absolute majority of seats, "it's hard to say whether the party 
will manage to find a coalition partner," he said, adding Meciar 
could only become premier again if there is a "very radical 
change in his manner of thinking and governing." 
  He personally reckons the HZDS will get perhaps twenty per 
cent of the September vote, the left wing a similar share and 
the centrist formations will have to compete for the remainder. 
Although Kovac's own party, the Alternative of Political Realism 
(APR), as yet scarcely figures in opinion poll results, he 
remains optimistic that there is room for a political center. 
  "We want to give voters the chance... to vote for a balanced 
center with a liberal economic policy that pragmatically 
respects social needs," he said. To this end, the APR, composed 
of disaffected HZDS members, and the Alliance of Democrats (AD 
SR), led by former foreign minister in the Meciar cabinet Milan 
Knazko, are expected to merge later this month to form the 
Slovak Democratic Union (DUS).

  [Text] Bratislava, April 12 (CTK) -- Slovak President 
Michal Kovac said last night he could imagine resumption of his 
cooperation with former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar if 
Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) wins the 
early elections. However, there are indications that Meciar is 
not willing to do so, Kovac said in a televised discussion. 
  If Meciar accepts the assignment to create a new cabinet and 
then initiate the replacement of the president, Kovac would 
defend himself. If he fails, he would democratically resign. 
  Kovac said he did not expect any political formation to gain 
a simple majority in the elections. He said he considered a 
broad coalition government the best alternative for Slovakia 
after the elections, adding he would welcome the present variant 
without top political leaders. 
  Only one month has passed since Kovac's significant speech 
before the Slovak parliament, in which he proposed the creation 
of a broad coalition government. Kovac today described as 
positive the changes which the society underwent within such a 
short period. He appreciated the calming down of the political 
situation, the quick agreement on the election date, the smooth 
constituting of the new coalition government, and the 
accommodating reaction of foreign countries. 
  Kovac expressed his conviction that in a short time, changes 
would occur within the HZDS and democratic principles of 
political work would be pushed through. However, if the thesis 
"HZDS is Meciar and Meciar is Slovakia" continues to be 
promoted, Kovac would reconsider his HZDS membership. The 
membership has been suspended since he became president last 
year. 
  Kovac admitted he had been little active in relation towards 
HZDS bodies since the very beginning of the conflict between 
Meciar and himself. He justified this mistake by the fear that 
he might be accused of interfering with the HZDS's internal 
affairs.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 8 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government 
is considering the postponement of local elections, Prime 
Minister Jozef Moravcik said at the 4th congress of the 
Association of Slovak Towns and Villages (ZMOS) today. 
  Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic supported the stance, 
explaining that the parliament would not probably be capable of 
discussing a bill on changes in the organization of local and 
state administration. The local elections are scheduled to take 
place in the autumn. 
  President Michal Kovac pointed out that no essential 
progress 
in the reform of state administration had been made since the 
past local elections held in 1990, when the system of national 
committees was abolished. 
  ZMOS Chairman Michal Sykora, delivering a report on the ZMOS 
activity, stressed the need to ratify the European Charter of 
local administration. 
  He added the previous government could not ratify it because 
of legislation differences. But the parliament has recommended 
to the new government to prepare necessary documents for the 
ratification of the Charter which has been signed by the three 
other Visegrad Four countries -- the Czech Republic, Hungary and 
Poland.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 11 (CTK) -- The position of the 
general director of the News Agency of the Slovak Republic (TA 
SR), Dusan Kleiman, seems uncertain after today's meeting of the 
Slovak Coalition Council, which was mostly taken up by 
discussion of the situation in the Slovak media. 
  Chairman of the Deputies' Group of the Democratic Left Party 
(SDL) Milan Ftacnik told journalists after the meeting that 
Deputy Premier Roman Kovac would be meeting with Kleiman soon, 
so that the latter could "explain his behavior with TA SR 
property and its transfer to private persons." 
  According to the Slovak press, Kleiman gave the order for 
the 
agency's publishing rights to the "pro-Meciar" paper REPUBLIKA 
to be transferred to the paper's editor-in-chief, Jan Smolec, by 
March 20. They were transferred back eight days later, but 
during this time TA SR operated the newspaper and paid its 
costs. The press is also saying that the very publishing of the 
loss-making REPUBLIKA by the agency is a violation of the law. 
  Ftacnik also said that the situation surrounding the Slovak 
Television and Radio Councils and the Council for Radio and 
Television Broadcasting also had to be clarified. The law 
should be changed so that each parliamentary party nominated an 
expert to the Council, he said. 
  "The Councils' activity could thus be renewed without the 
suspicion that the ruling majority of the moment will always 
fill it with its people, people who suit it," Ftacnik said, 
adding that it was not impossible that a bill would be put 
before parliament at the end of April. 
  Deputy Vladimir Miskovsky said that reservations concerning 
television news broadcasting were the main reason for the 
intended changes. Critics said, for example, that with party 
press conferences more coverage was given to the opposition than 
to the governing parties. 
  Speculation about alleged "painful spots" in the government 
coalition was groundless, Ftacnik said. "Sometimes there are 
differences in opinion concerning the speed or effectiveness of 
several measures, but we always agree in the end," Miskovsky 
said of the state within the coalition, which comprises the SDL, 
three centrist groupings and the Christian Democratic Movement 
(KDH). The coalition is also supported by the Hungarian 
minority parties, representatives of which also attended today's 
meeting.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 11 (CTK) -- The new Slovak 
Government's intention to accelerate economic change cannot be 
effectuated without an eye on the social fallout of reform, 
Deputy Premier Roman Kovac told CTK. 
  "If we launch economic transformations such that the 
population cannot hold out to the end, this social 
unacceptability will put the brakes on economic reform once 
again," he said. 
  About Slovakia's high (14.8 percent) unemployment, Kovac 
said 
that "especially disquieting is the large share of long-term 
unemployment, which is threatening to become unemployability. 
More than a third of the people without work are below the age 
of 25. This is a very bad start to life." 
  He described the onset of a decline in unemployment in 
districts where economic change is apparently happening faster 
and strengthening the private sector as a springboard. The new 
government's recipe for reducing unemployment comes from 
understanding that the solution lies not with the Ministry of 
Labor and Social Affairs, but with the economics ministries. 
  "The fastest method of eliminating unemployment lies in 
developing small and medium businesses and the neglected area of 
tourism, although this could suck up the work force like a 
sponge," he said. "If we are able to start a system of 
supporting small and medium businesses, we will hold 
unemployment below the desired ceiling of 17 percent." 
  The system is to consist of simplified legal regulations, 
clear rules for rapid privatization, easier availability of 
credit, and tax breaks for businesses. This system should also 
restore the confidence of foreign investors, whose interest in 
Slovakia weakened last year, Kovac said. 
  The solution also lies in better preparation for the 
restructuring of the economy so that companies can alter their 
production plans rapidly, and in the launching of large 
construction projects such as highways, the reconstruction of 
the railways, the completion of the Mochovce nuclear power 
plant, or a dam in Zilina, West Slovakia. 
  In the meantime, the government must keep alive the 
educational and health care systems, which have reached a 
critical condition because of "ill considered restrictions 
without (properly) prepared systemic measures." The health care 
system, threatened by debts of 50 billion Slovak crowns ($1.5 
billion) from uncompleted construction projects and obsolete 
equipment and 1.8 billion crowns ($54 million) for unpaid-for 
medications and other materials, should be protected through 
emergency financing at the beginning, but changes must be 
adopted quickly, Kovac said. 
  "It is necessary to complete the privatization of pharmacies 
and to set in motion the privatization of spas and the 
activities of the health profession. This is possible only 
under a relatively stable system of incentives.... I believe it 
will be possible to introduce the new system as early as June or 
July." 
  A compromise under preparation with the labor unions on 
changes in the Tripartite (government, labor, employers) General 
Agreement should also help preserve social peace, Kovac said. 
But concluding talks with the unions depends on the views of 
the International Monetary Fund concerning the new government's 
economic program.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 11 (CTK) -- The Slovak Workers' 
Association (ZRS), a newcomer to the Slovak political scene, 
came fourth in March popularity polls of political parties, 
Slovak Radio said today. Over five percent of the respondents 
preferred the ZRS. 
  The news has aroused foreign interest, as evidenced by 
today's talks between ZRS Chairman Jan Luptak and British 
Ambassador in Slovakia David Bright. 
  Speaking on the radio, Luptak said Bright had been 
interested 
by the (blue collar) workers' negative attitude to market 
economy being introduced throughout Slovakia. [sentence as 
received] 
  "It is impossible to privatize quickly and at the same time 
justly," Luptak said, pointing to the privatization of British 
Rail, whose privatization he said has been going on for twenty 
years despite Britain having a healthier economy (than Slovakia). 
  "The ZRS has made contacts with the international workers' 
movement and is especially interested in the policy of the 
Norwegian Workers' Party which won the latest elections," Luptak 
said.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 12 (CTK) -- U.S. Undersecretary 
of State Strobe Talbott will meet with top Slovak politicians in 
his one-day visit to the capital today. He will be received in 
the morning by President Michal Kovac, then meet in the 
afternoon with Premier Jozef Moravcik, Parliament Chairman Ivan 
Gasparovic, and Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan. Talbott and 
Kukan will hold a press conference at the conclusion of their 
meeting. 
  Kukan says in the Slovak press that Talbott's visit is 
significant not only because of his close personal relationship 
with President Bill Clinton, but as a signal with regard to the 
current situation in Slovakia. He says he expects his 
discussion with Talbott to revolve around international 
questions and Slovakia's economic situation, particularly in 
regard to opportunities for American capital and businesses.

  [Text] Poprad, east Slovakia, April 8 (CTK) -- The 
cooperation of the Visegrad Four countries in the military 
sphere, their admission into Western military systems and 
modernization of the Slovak and Polish armed forces were 
discussed by Slovak and Polish Defense Ministers Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk and Pavol Kanis today. 
  Kolodziejczyk told journalists he was optimistic regarding 
regional cooperation of the Central European countries and the 
Partnership for Peace project. This is a way of creating a 
joint defense area which has no alternative, he added. 
  Kanis (left-orientated Democratic Left Party, SDL, appointed 
to the post on March 16) said that Slovakia's orientation 
towards the West would continue. This is evidenced by the 
identical view of the ministers that the Visegrad Four countries 
(Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic) should enter 
NATO jointly, he added. 
  Kolodziejczyk said the Polish offer to jointly use military 
training areas, including that above the Baltic Sea, was still 
topical and it was being discussed by experts. 
  Poland is planning a string of joint military exercises with 
NATO countries. It would like Visegrad Four representatives to 
participate as observers, Kolodziejczyk said. Kanis added that 
the exchange of smaller units had been proposed as well.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 8 (CTK) -- A note sent today by 
the Slovak Foreign Ministry to the Hungarian Embassy in 
Bratislava expresses Slovakia's readiness to resume as early as 
possible the talks on the establishment of a temporary water 
regime on the Danube. 
  The Slovak Ministry thus responded to a note from the 
Hungarian Foreign Ministry of March 28, in which Budapest urged 
the Slovak government to resume the negotiations immediately. 
The Hungarian note reacted to Slovakia's rejection of a 
compromise proposal by European Union experts for the method of 
division of the Danube's water between the original bed of the 
border river and a derivation canal built by Bratislava on 
Slovak territory. Budapest itself accepted the compromise 
proposal, though with reservations. 
  In opposition to this, the Slovak note recalls that the EU 
experts had also recommended to build weirs in the Danube's 
original bed to prevent drying up of some river's branches, but 
the Hungarian parliament recently rejected the weirs' 
construction. Nevertheless, in its document Bratislava says it 
favors further search for a rational and effective solution to 
the problem.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 9 (CTK) -- Interior Minister 
Ladislav Pittner said he did not rule out that certain disputed 
stretches of the Czech-Slovak border would be resolved before 
the early elections. "I think we will be able to close the 
issue of the Sidonie and U Sabotu settlements and regulation of 
the Morava river," Pittner said after a government session today. 
  He stressed at the same time that he did not consider 
Kasarna, a settlement of Czech vacation cottage owners, a 
disputed place and would not cede it to the Czech Republic. 
  Pittner called "strange" the decision by Vladimir Meciar's 
cabinet, which approved only one part of the previous 
recommendations by ministers while rejecting the other. 
According to the ministerial recommendation, Sidonie had to be 
incorporated into the Czech Republic, while U Sabotu should 
remain with Slovakia, including territory provided as 
compensation for a change of border during the regulation of the 
Morava. However, Meciar's government refused to cede Sidonie. 
  "But the Czech Republic could not agree that a part of its 
territory would be acquired by Slovakia which would not provide 
anything in turn," he stated.

  [Text] Ljubljana, April 12 (CTK) -- The Muslim-Croatian 
federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina will remain only a first step 
toward an already problematic peace if the international 
community does not aid in searching for a solution to the 
Serbian nationality question, Slovene President Milan Kucan told 
CTK. 
  Kucan is one of the seven Central European presidents who 
will meet for informal talks in Litomysl, East Bohemia, on 
Friday and Saturday at the invitation of Czech President Vaclav 
Havel. 
  It is necessary to seek a solution to the problem of Serbian 
minority rights in Croatia as well as Albanian and Hungarian 
minority rights in Serbia, Kucan said. 
  For nationally homogeneous Slovenia, however, Kucan said he 
sees no possibility for any kind of political union with the 
lands of the former Yugoslavia any time in the future. But 
after the war Slovenia would be willing to cooperate with 
countries on ex-Yugoslav territory in a variety of fields on the 
same basis as other European countries. 
  Kucan said that Slovenia had never belonged to the Balkans 
either historically, culturally or even geographically, and 
pointed out that Slovenia and the Czech Republic have always 
been close and always belonged to Europe, despite its unnatural 
division between 1945 and 1989. 
  However, the lack of understanding of the Balkans and its 
traditional instability is one of the main reasons Europe 
squandered so many chances to prevent, and later end, the war. 
  With regard to European integration, Slovenia has the same 
kinds of capabilities and obstacles as other countries of the 
former communist bloc, and likewise requires both time and 
support to adapt itself to European institutions, Kucan said. 
  He also expressed his belief that the Czech Republic and 
Slovenia, with their historical traditions and hidden economic, 
scientific and cultural potential, could help make the common 
European house a "functional and successful arena" where all 
would be equal.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/4/1994 -- Commenting NATO's 
air raids against the Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Bucharest 
says that "deciding for armed actions, the United Nations has 
abandoned the role of peace maker which it used to play, and 
overtly sided with the Muslims," which questions the nature and 
the mandate of the UNPROFOR (United Nations Protection Force) in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the embassy states in a press release. 
  The statement released for the press writes that the 
Yugoslav 
Embassy is definitely against the policy of pressure and 
ultimatum, against armed attacks over the Serbian area, and 
pleads that double standard policies should be renounced.

  [Text] Pristina, April 11 (ATA) -- Great forces of the 
Serbian Army, armoured vehicles and other military facilities 
have been deployed in the Han of Elez, near the 
Kosova-Macedonian border. In the Peldenica village in the same 
zone, four other armoured vehicles have been sent, the 
information centre of Kosova reports. It also says that Serbian 
police has made a check point in a road that links some villages 
with the town of Hani i Elezit. It controls Albanian citizens 
who travel in the villages of the border zone. Three tanks have 
been staying in Ura e Kashanit. Serbian military forces in 
these areas are provoking citizens and plundering them, the 
information centre says. 
  Movements and concentrations of the Serbian military and 
police forces are noticed near Gjakova, bordering Albania. 
  Serbian information sources report that the commander in 
chief of the Yugoslav Army, Momcilo Perisic, stayed several days 
in Kosova "on a visit to the units of the Pristina army corps" 
and to control the fighting readiness of the units in the 
terrain.

  [Text] Sofia, April 12 (BTA) -- "Launching air strikes to 
resolve the Bosnian conflict may have unpredictable negative 
consequences for the national security of Bulgaria," it is said 
in a statement by Nikolay Slatinski, chairman of the National 
Assembly Committee on National Security, which was made public 
at the committee's news conference today. "Similar actions 
could have expanded and internationalized the armed conflict, 
they could have led to a confrontation between the great powers 
in an extremely risky way, they could have turned the 
international community from a part of the mechanism regulating 
the conflict into a part of the problem itself; there still is 
such a danger," the statement says. According to Mr. Slatinski, 
"there is also the danger of the great powers learning to 
cleanse themselves from their sins, inaction, contradictions and 
impotence by air strikes". 
  In the view of the National Security Committee chairman, 
there is yet another reason for serious concern about the 
developments in the Balkans: the fate of the Bulgarian minority 
on the territory of Eastern Serbia, which once belonged to 
Bulgaria but "were detached from it by great powers in an 
utterly unjust and cynical way under the Treaty of Neuilly in 
1919". 
  "Bulgaria has taken the heaviest losses as a result of the 
strict application of sanctions against ex-Yugoslavia," Mr. 
Slatinski said at today's news conference. "The international 
community should clearly state that after the settlement of the 
conflict, Bulgaria will be given the right to participate in 
rebuilding the countries in ex-Yugoslavia under preferential 
terms," he pointed out. "Given the colossal losses suffered by 
non-embargoed countries, no doubt the lack of compensations will 
discredit sanctions as the most important instrument of the 
United Nations," Mr. Slatinski says in his statement circulated 
today. "To right a wrong by doing another wrong undermines the 
efforts of the world community and makes them pointless," Mr. 
Slatinski's statement reads. 
  "While Europe continues to distance itself from the Balkans, 
a process of nuclear buildup is going on in the region; NATO has 
not stopped guarding itself against threats and risks... Today 
our neighbours are on friendly terms with us, but what about 
tomorrow?", is Mr. Slatinski's question. "We need mechanisms of 
control, confidence building, protection and easing tensions," 
it is said in his statement. 
  In Mr. Slatinski's opinion, Bulgaria stands a chance of 
becoming a factor in the region. 
  "Bulgaria's primary national interest is its non-involvement 
in the military conflict in the region," the chairman of the 
Parliamentary National Security Committee said. "But who can 
guarantee that Bulgaria will assume the role of a passive 
observer if the developments in the Balkans take a turn for the 
worse and its national security and national interests are 
directly threatened?" Mr. Slatinski says in his statement.

  [Text] Vidin, April 12 (BTA) -- The representatives of the 
Bulgarian state institutions controlling the implementation of 
sanctions along the Danube and the officials of the Western 
European Union [WEU] ended their formal meeting. 
  The participants focussed on the measures that would ensure 
efficient control over the application of sanctions along the 
Danube and specified the actions which the teams of the WEU and 
the Bulgarian institutions should take in case of embargo 
busting, BTA was told by Vasko Vasilev, deputy head of the Vidin 
Customs. 
  The representatives of Bulgaria and the WEU shared the 
opinion that each specific conflict should be resolved by 
peaceful means in order to protect the population and the 
population centres and prevent any environmental disaster along 
the river. 
  It was agreed that a similar meeting should be held in 
Bucharest, where the WEU representatives would talk with 
Romania's governmental commission to specify the actions to be 
taken in a case of embargo busting and their coordination by the 
Bulgarian, Romanian and WEU teams.

  [Text] Sofia, April 12 (BTA) -- The leader of the 
opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) Filip Dimitrov 
almost does not rely on parliamentary methods to oust Prof. 
Lyuben Berov's government from power and provoke early 
parliamentary elections. SDS wants the fall of Prof. Berov's 
cabinet, which was formed in late December 1992 on the mandate 
of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms and with 
the support of the ex-communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 
the New Union for Democracy (expellees or defectors from the 
parliamentary SDS) and several independent MP's. After the 
regular meeting of SDS's leadership today, the union's floor 
leader Stefan Savov categorically denied that when he met with 
President Zhelyu Zhelev yesterday they discussed Mr. Savov's 
possible candidature to head a future cabinet. The union 
insists on early elections. Stefan Sofiyanski, a deputy 
chairman of SDS's National Coordinating Council, said the union 
was not going to abandon the parliamentary methods in order to 
provoke elections. In his view, SDS will insist that the 
National Assembly debate and vote a resolution on the cabinet's 
financial policy which, according to the opposition, has been 
the cause for the steep appreciation of the U.S. dollar and the 
rise of prices over the last few months. It will be only after 
the National Assembly adopts such a resolution that SDS might 
move its sixth vote of no confidence in the cabinet after its 
previous ones were defeated. 
  The BSP will keep up its pressure on the government, 
demanding practical measures to get inflation under control and 
speed up the efforts to offset the erosion of the incomes of the 
socially disadvantaged, Mr. Doncho Konakchiev MP of the BSP told 
a news conference today. This is the decision taken at today's 
meeting of the Socialists' leadership. The Socialists intend to 
celebrate the International Labour Day on May 1 by "raising 
slogans with demands for better social policy," for a crack-down 
on profiteering and corruption, for taking practical measures to 
solve the problems of the socially disadvantaged and for 
economic stability", Mr. Konakchiev said. 
  The Socialists confirmed today the decision of their plenum 
ten days ago to demand that the cabinet present in mid-May a 
reasoned progress report and ideas of its economic policy. 
According to the Socialists, the cabinet's report and the 
report of the National Bank will have to be tabled for 
discussions in the National Assembly. They said they were not 
satisfied with the measures that the state and the bank 
institutions are taking to bring the crisis in the currency 
market under control. 
  The general strike announced by the Confederation of 
Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB), one of the major 
trade unions in the country, is also scheduled for mid-May. 
Today the Women's Democratic Union declared its support for the 
strike. "We neither support nor reject the strike but we cannot 
accept some of the conclusions about the economic situation in 
Bulgaria that the KNSB leadership has made," Mr. Sofiyanski 
said. He emphasized that according to SDS some of the trade 
union's demands are justified, but they can only be met by a 
strong government, formed after early parliamentary elections. 
  KNSB and Podkrepa, the two major labour amalgamations, did 
not attend today's regular meeting of the National Council for 
Tripartite Coordination. A week ago the two amalgamations 
walked out of the council over differences with the Government 
and warned this might be their first step towards a final 
withdrawal. 
  A special statement of the employers and the government, 
circulated this afternoon, says that "the refusal of the trade 
unions to participate in discussions poses a tangible obstacle 
to a final settlement of the social partnership problems." The 
employers and the government believe that irrespective of their 
differences on the issues concerning collective bargaining, at 
today's meeting they could have discussed current social 
problems. The statement denies the allegations made by the 
trade unions that the government was unwilling to reconsider the 
principles of incomes policy. 
  Today KNSB leader Prof. Krustyu Petkov made public a letter 
in which he says that the trade union is distancing itself 
completely from the policy of the government, "from the inaction 
and irresponsibility for the fate of the economic reform." KNSB 
is expecting the prime minister's personal response to the 
demands over which the amalgamation has threatened to go to 
strike. 
  The extraparliamentary Bulgarian Agrarian Party (BZNS) again 
criticized the government today accusing it of inability to cope 
with the grave problems in the country. BZNS is staging a rally 
and procession on April 23 under the slogan "Early Elections 
Will End Crisis". 
  The parliamentary BSP and DPS discussed cabinet changes this 
afternoon. The movement is considering so far only structural 
changes in the cabinet and it will leave it to the prime 
minister to decide on the personal replacements. According to 
DPS, the Committees of Tourism and Power Engineering should be 
transformed into separate ministries or placed under the 
jurisdiction of other ministries. DPS leader Ahmed Dogan is 
expected to meet with Prime Minister Lyuben Berov this week. 
Socialist PM's discussed changes in the government's policy. 
At the end of last week, BSP representatives handed the prime 
minister a memorandum setting forth their views. They expect 
suggestions and even structural changes in the government to be 
made by the end of April. The Socialists suggest the formation 
of a Ministry of Privatization, Ministry of the State 
Participation in Economy and a structure performing the 
functions of the former Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations.

  [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav 
Havel firmly believes that the April 10 NATO bombing raid 
against the Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde will be the 
last real warning that would bring the Bosnian Serbs to the 
negotiating table, Havel told CTK and the daily RUDE PRAVO today. 
  "I have long thought is was necessary that the international 
community use stronger means to let it be known that (the Serbs) 
cannot do whatever pleases them," Havel said. 
  Two U.S. Air Force F-16 jets under NATO command attacked 
Bosnian Serb units which had entered the southern suburbs of 
Gorazde. It was the first NATO air strike against ground 
targets in Bosnia.

  [Text] Prague, April (CTK) -- The NATO air strikes on 
Bosnian Serb positions on Sunday and Monday are a dangerous 
game, foreign policy spokesman of the Democratic Left Party 
(SDL) Zdenek Masopust said at a party press conference today. 
  NATO was looking for a new identity and was not yet able to 
take into account that in the post-communist world Russia plays 
an important role, he said. He emphasized that Russia should 
not be humiliated for fear of "feeding nationalist extremism" in 
the country. 
  NATO fighters attacked Bosnian Serb positions on Monday 
afternoon in an attempt to prevent a Serb advance on the Bosnian 
town of Gorazde, a UN designated "safe haven". The strike came 
less than 24 hours after a Sunday strike against Bosnian Serbian 
positions. Russia strongly protested against both attacks, as it 
did against the NATO ultimatum to the Serbs besieging Sarajevo. 
  At the same conference SDL deputy Vladimir Rezac pointed out 
possible conflicts between the post-1989 Land Law and its 
amendments and the decrees of post-war Czechoslovak President 
Eduard Benes. He said it is often overlooked that the Benes 
decrees were ratified by the Czechoslovak parliament in 1946, 
making them constitutional. Hence the return of land formerly 
belonging to "German Nazis" living in Czechoslovakia who were 
deprived of their land by the Benes decrees might be illegal, he 
said. 
  Rezac referred in particular to the case of Karl Des Fours 
Walderode, who was granted Czech citizenship again last year. 
Walderode was a member of Konrad Henlein's Sudeten German Party, 
adopted German citizenship in 1939 and joined the Wehrmacht.

  [Excerpt] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- Commenting on the NATO 
air strikes on the Bosnian Serbs besieging Gorazde, the 
independent MLADA FRONTA DNES writes, "Although in their extent 
and effect they cannot bring the Serbian aggressors to their 
knees, they have exceeded the dimensions of the region. They 
have become not only the first NATO military operation in Europe 
led against ground forces, but above all the first intervention 
by Americans on the old continent since the Second World War." 
  It is too late for Bosnia to return to 1992, when it was 
still possible to talk about a state based on the civic 
principle, the paper says. "The important thing is, however, 
that in Belgrade and Pale they should understand that aggression 
cannot be repeated in the future," MLADA FRONTA DNES says. 
  The left-leaning RUDE PRAVO adds that the United Nations had 
made it clear to the Serbs that it was time to stop playing 
games. There was nothing else the UN could do if it did not 
want to create the impression that there was no way out in 
Bosnia. "If Sunday and Monday's events are not to be a mere 
belated warning to the Serbs, it seems that the West will become 
more deeply involved in Bosnia than ever before," the paper 
writes, adding that "there is no other way." 
  The right-leaning TELEGRAF points out that the first armed 
NATO operation in Europe came about due to the uncompromising 
position of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] leader in Bosnia, 
Michael Rose. "Although the situation was not significantly 
safer before the UN units than many times previously, Rose did 
not hesitate and after several warnings to the Serbs he asked 
the allied air forces for help," the paper says. 
  The UN and NATO now have to show that the events in Gorazde 
are the harbinger of a consistent attitude towards any sort of 
expansionist nationalism. "Serbian resistance will be all the 
stronger, because the leaders there have become used to the idea 
of the Greater Serbia," TELEGRAF concludes. 
  "Not one step forward has been motivated by the unambiguous 
will to reach a clearly defined goal, but by the attempt to 
avoid a greater evil," the independent LIDOVE NOVINY writes, 
adding that the West is trying to avoid steps which would drag 
it further into a conflict over which it would have no control.

  [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav 
Klaus said on Czech Radio today that no controversial themes 
came up during his meeting with Polish Premier Waldemar Pawlak 
in the Polish province of Jelenia Gora on Sunday [10 April]. 
  Asked if during the almost five hours of discussion between 
the chairman of "one of the few genuinely right-wing parties in 
Europe and the leader of the post-communist Polish People's 
Party" there reigned only harmony and agreement, Czech Premier 
Vaclav Klaus said he would be "more careful about using these 
easy labels such as post-communist," because the world was 
always a little bit more complicated. He had talked to Pawlak 
about completely specific things, in the realization of which 
both countries were interested. "Thus I do not think there was 
any room, essentially, for disagreement on such matters," Klaus 
said. 
  He said that Poland, at least according to Pawlak, did not 
have differing foreign policy ambitions. However, Klaus said it 
was not impossible that if he had spoken to President Lech 
Walesa or Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski, the difference in 
opinion on some things might have been greater.

  [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- First Deputy Foreign 
Minister Alexandr Vondra pointed today to the crucial importance 
of Syria, Pakistan and Iran which exceeds the scope of the 
region from the power, political and economic points of view. 
Vondra, who returned from a twelve-day trip to the three 
countries, also pointed to their large markets which make them 
attractive for European partners. 
  Czech politicians and entrepreneurs should pay more 
attention 
to these countries because privatization has been advancing 
there and local economies are adapting themselves to the new 
budgetary and taxation policy, Vondra said. 
  Despite changes in the political climate in the past on both 
sides, the long-term traditions of good commercial relations 
with these countries have remained. It would be erroneous not 
to take this into account and not to strive to maintain and 
develop all the good moments in the tradition of mutual 
relations, he added.

  [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic will 
negotiate new trade accords and agreements on investment 
protection with Syria and Pakistan. The two documents are 
likely to be negotiated with Syria this year, Czech Deputy 
Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra said today. Vondra was 
speaking to reporters after his return home from a trip to the 
two countries and Iran. 
  He said that as far as Syria is concerned, all agreements 
with that country will be reviewed, which is important from the 
point of view of past commitments and accords concluded with 
Syria by former Czechoslovakia. Vondra handed over an 
invitation for the Syrian foreign minister to visit the Czech 
Republic. 
  Vondra also said that since Syria was a traditional region 
for investment and commercial activities by Czech firms, he had 
tried to support the activities of Czech business people in 
realizing promising projects. 
  Vondra believes that the issue of Czech liabilities in Syria 
dating from the 1970's and particularly from the 1980's will 
best be settled through the maintenance of mutual trade 
relations. He said Syria was now in a very good position 
regarding payments. Over the past two years, particularly after 
the Gulf War, it has been a responsible partner, said Vondra. 
  Pakistan is following the path of extensive privatization of 
the state sector. Vondra believes it is necessary for Czech 
business people to obtain information about the changed 
situation there so that they will be able to orientate 
themselves quickly. That was also one of the reasons why the 
Czech Government decided some time ago to turn the former 
commercial department in Karachi into a general consulate.

  [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- Czech Deputy Foreign 
Minister Alexandr Vondra told journalists today that he did not 
say anything about exports of Czech arms to Iran during his 
three day talks in this country. 
  The Czech Republic had clearly said several times that no 
arms were currently being supplied to Iran, Vondra said at a 
press conference upon his return to Prague from the trip on 
which he visited also Syria and Pakistan. 
  For many years Iran had been one of the most trustworthy 
partners as regards payments, Vondra said, adding that only 
during the last half year had some problems appeared. It 
should, however, be noted that some minor problems had arisen 
due to the transformation of the Czech economy and partly also 
due to the inevitable change in Czech firms' behavior, Vondra 
said. 
  There had been a considerable drop in oil prices recently 
and 
besides Iran had been handling the consequences of the war with 
Iraq. All this was leading Iran to adopt a new economic and 
budget policy which also concerned the Czech Republic as many 
Czech companies were developing busy trade contacts with Iran 
and participating in large investment projects there. Problems 
with payments for Czech activities had appeared recently, Vondra 
said. 
  "These are things which the Czech private sector should be 
aware of and proceeding with utmost responsibility while 
entering the Iranian market, which is a large one with good 
prospects, " Vondra said. 
  He said that the Iranian Government started to negotiate new 
payment relations with many countries at the beginning of this 
year. These problems would probably also be discussed at the May 
meeting of a Czech-Iranian joint commission established last 
autumn, Vondra said.

  [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- A list of almost 150 
people imprisoned in Vietnam for their religious convictions or 
for expressing disagreement with the Vietnamese Government has 
been sent to Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec by the 
chairman of the Czech Section of the Vietnamese Renewal Party, 
Pham Viet Hung. 
  CTK was today given an open letter addressed to Zieleniec, 
together with a copy of the document issued by the Puebla 
Institute, a U.S.-based human rights organization which is 
aiming for the establishment of democracy in Vietnam. The 
organization says the list is not complete, and that in actual 
fact there are many more prisoners. 
  In the open letter, the Renewal Party's Czech section 
expresses disappointment that recent articles in the Czech press 
about Czech leaders' visits to the Vietnamese Socialist Republic 
did not mention human rights breaches in Vietnam. 
  In connection with Zieleniec's forthcoming visit to the 
country, Pham Viet Hung says that millions of people in Vietnam 
long for freedom and democracy, and asks Zieleniec to bear this 
fact in mind during his meetings with Vietnamese government 
representatives. 
  The letter also says that the Czech Republic has an 
unusually 
good reputation in the area of human rights, and that for 
countries such as Vietnam, still ruled over by a communist 
regime, it provides an example on their non-violent path to 
democracy. 
  Czech Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Vit Kurfurst said that 
the 
ministry was aware that problems existed with regard to the 
observance of human rights in Vietnam. He added that this was a 
problem which needed to be talked about with the Vietnamese 
government and which should be pointed out. In no event, 
however, should it hinder the mutual development of economic and 
trade relations, Kurfurst said.

  [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav 
Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek gave CTK on Tuesday [12 April] 
a written statement denying that Havel had started to shun 
interviews with news agencies. 
  The statement came in reaction to press commentaries 
criticizing the Presidential Office's announcement that it would 
not mediate Havel's interviews for news agencies. The statement 
was reported on April 8 by REUTERS and CTK. 
  "There are no changes in dealing with requests for 
interviews," Spacek wrote. 
  Turning to the REUTERS information that Havel would shun 
interviews with news agencies because his office could not 
control the published text, Spacek wrote: "In my personal 
discussion with the REUTERS correspondent...I said that we 
preferred papers to agencies, but no 'strict' ban was mentioned." 
  This is at variance not only with the REUTERS report, but 
also with the written statement which Spacek gave CTK on March 
25 after it requested an interview with Havel. 
  "On principle we provide interviews only to media about 
which 
we are sure when, where, and in what shape the interview will 
appear. With agencies we do not have the opportunity to approve 
the final shape of the information in which it reaches the 
reader." Nevertheless, Spacek allowed for the question to be 
left open. 
  On March 25 Spacek said that an interview given to an agency 
involved "risks due to which we have not granted any interview 
to any agency since the president assumed his post (in January 
1993)." 
  But in his statement yesterday Spacek said that REUTERS had 
been given answers to its questions three months ago. 
  Spacek also wrote yesterday that as Czech President Havel 
had 
granted a total of 149 interviews to the media from 21 countries. 
  He also wrote it was not true that Havel would not grant an 
interview before the April 15-16 meeting of seven Central 
European presidents in Litomysl, East Bohemia. 
  According to Spacek, Havel gave one interview yesterday, and 
another will be granted today. But Havel's health condition and 
busy schedule did not allow him to grant an interview to REUTERS 
immediately after it was requested. Spacek did not mention 
CTK's request for an interview. 
  The originally announced attitude of the Presidential Office 
to agencies was criticized by the Czech independent daily MLADA 
FRONTA DNES yesterday. It said that the statement that the 
president would not grant interviews because the Presidential 
Office could not control the published text created the 
impression that the Castle (seat of the president) wanted to 
assume the right to control the independent press. The paper 
also wrote that "the decision seems to have come more from the 
minds of the ruling Castle bureaucrats than from the 
president's."

  [Text] Brno, South Moravia, April 12 (CTK) -- The 
Constitutional Court today decided to abolish part of Article 
102 of the criminal code dealing with the defamation of 
parliament, the government and the Constitutional Court. The 
ruling will take effect on the day of publication in the Digest 
of Laws. 
  The Constitutional Court reacted to President Vaclav Havel's 
proposal to delete the above provisions, but to keep the 
provision on the defamation of the republic. 
  Article 103, concerning the defamation of the president of 
the republic, also remained untouched. President Havel had not 
recommended that it be deleted. 
  Court spokesman Vladimir Klokocka said the Czech Republic 
was 
not exceptional in protecting the republic and its 
constitutional organs in this special way. What was unusual, he 
said, was the way in which they were protected, with no 
difference being made between the crime of defamation in various 
specific constitutional organizations, which had certain 
functions and certain competence. 
  Justifying the court's ruling, Klokocka said that similar to 
Article 102 were Articles 154 and 156, which dealt with gross 
insult or slander of a state organ or public official. 
  The similarities and differences between Article 102 and 
Articles 154 and 156 would lead to interpretations which kept 
under which parliament, the government and the Constitutional 
Court would not count as state organs, although they were. In 
Article 102 they were offered a superior type of legal 
protection, which was otherwise only usual for abstract symbols 
of a state, such as the republic. Here Klokocka pointed out that 
the conception of Article 102 was at variance with the Czech 
Republic's international undertakings, and that it went over the 
head of its constitutional order. 
  "What is important is not only how Article 102 would be 
interpreted by the courts, but also the way in which these laws 
would be interpreted by the general public. If people are 
uncertain about the law, they will lose confidence in the legal 
state and will also be hindered in civic activity," Klokocka 
said. 
  Because suitable special protection for these institutions 
was not specified, "the concept of defamation takes on a general 
and indefinite meaning, abused by the old authoritarian 
regimes," which in certain questions allowed misty formulations 
to be used, and these could be interpreted according to need. 
  Article 102 did not have to be a necessary measure for the 
very reason that the protection offered to state organs in 
paragraphs 154 and 156 was sufficient, and from the point of 
view of limiting the object of protection, even more precise, 
Klokocka said. 
  The concept of "defamation" was used in the Czech lands by 
the criminal law in 1852. In 1923 Czechoslovakia incorporated 
it into the law on the protection of the republic, and later 
into the criminal codes of the 1950's and 1960's. Defamation 
was understood as a gross detraction of dignity, gross 
dishonoring, degradation and ridicule. 
  The term was still understood in the same way today, 
Klokocka 
said, but the difference was that the 1923 law used it only in 
connection with defamation of the republic, with a concept, 
therefore, which was not an expression for a certain institution 
with certain competence.

  [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- The Constitutional Court 
made the right decision in complying with President Havel's 
request to abolish part of Article 102 on the defamation of 
parliament, the government or the Constitutional Court, Deputy 
Chairman of Parliament Jan Kasal told CTK today. 
  By taking this step, he added, the court had showed that it 
had its place in the republic's constitutional system. "That the 
court decided differently from parliament I certainly do not see 
as a wrong towards parliament." he said. 
  Kasal said he firmly believed that the defamation clause 
should not have stayed in the criminal code "for all time." 
  Another deputy chairman of parliament, Pavel Tollner, said 
that he personally welcomed the Constitutional Court's verdict. 
However, he added, the provision had in practice remained 
unused in the application of the criminal code. 
  Chairman of the Left Bloc deputies' group Jaroslav Ortman 
said today's decision showed that the demands of Left Bloc 
deputies during parliamentary debate of the amendment to the 
criminal code were right. Left Bloc deputies had proposed that 
the clauses on the defamation of the republic and its 
representatives be left out. 
  Dalibor Matulka, formerly a Left Bloc deputy but now in the 
Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), agreed with 
Ortman, adding that he was surprised that President Vaclav Havel 
had not proposed that the court abolished Article 103 as well, 
which concerned the defamation of the president of the republic. 
  Pavel Kulicka (Liberal National and Social Party, LSNS) said 
that his club welcomed the decision of the Constitutional Court, 
and Rudolf Opatril, press spokesman for the Bohemian and 
Moravian Centre Party (CMSS), said the same. 
  On November 10 last year parliament passed an amendment to 
the criminal code, and voted to keep the provisions on the 
defamation of the republic and its representatives in it. Havel 
subsequently signed the code but proposed that the 
Constitutional Court reconsider the defamation provisions.

  [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- The Czech Government 
coalition faces no crisis; however, some problems should be 
called by their true names, which would lead to redressing 
relations within the coalition, Czech Industry and Trade 
Minister Vladimir Dlouhy says in an interview published by the 
independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY today. 
  Dlouhy explains that he has been avoiding commenting on some 
political problems because he does not feel sure about some 
topics, as his post of industry and trade minister does not 
allow him to center on these problems in detail. 
  It is impossible to question the Senate (the parliament's 
upper chamber still to be created), as it is embedded in the 
Constitution, Dlouhy says. It should be less politically based 
in relation to the Chamber of Deputies (the lower chamber), and 
it should control its activities. Members of the Senate should 
be real personalities rather than people elected primarily 
according to electoral preferences, he adds. 
  Turning to the restitution of church property, Dlouhy says 
he 
preferred a compromise. It is impossible to insist that either 
everything or nothing be returned. The church should get back 
the property designed to serve religious, charity and 
humanitarian purposes. 
  The Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA, one of the four 
government coalition parties of which Dlouhy is deputy 
chairman), "has crystallized into a liberal-conservative party," 
which "has succeeded in selling its policy to people" and thus 
become the second strongest political party of these days, 
Dlouhy says, adding that the ODA should enter the next elections 
(scheduled for 1996) independently. 
  Dlouhy says he does not find reasonable casting doubt on 
Frantisek Benda as the Environment Minister by the (strongest 
coalition party) Civic Democratic Party (ODS). He considers it 
an example of unhealthy relations within the coalition (Benda is 
a member of the coalition Christian Democratic Party, KDS). 
"Coalition mechanisms will have probably to be examined and 
respected," Dlouhy stated. 
  "The ODS has (and mainly had) very specific vocabulary 
(which 
has discouraged the left-wing opposition), but from time to time 
it has accommodated its policy to the views of a large number of 
people from the whole of the political spectrum," Dlouhy says. 
  The ODS and the ODA have, Dlouhy believes, a chance to 
divide 
the political center in the elections. The ODA will be chosen 
particularly by liberals, as it will honor the basic "authentic 
conservative values," while the ODS will be favored by "people 
typical of the center, who adhere to the it because they wish 
their standards of living to be sure," Dlouhy says. 
  Speaking about Slovak developments, Dlouhy says that the 
former government of Vladimir Meciar had not made any principal 
mistakes in the economic sphere. But the abuse of technical 
obstacles, such as the introduction of import certificates and 
veterinary certificates has surpassed the reasonable measure, he 
adds. 
  Dlouhy rejects the idea of Czechoslovak union as mentioned 
again by Chairman of the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) 
Milos Zeman. The reunification of the Czech and Slovak Republics 
could destabilize the political situation in Central Europe 
because the powers of the union and the individual republics 
would be taken up for discussion once again. "Only he who 
cannot come with nothing else can raise this banner. I don't 
understand Milos Zeman," Dlouhy says.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 12/4/1994 -- "Deciding for armed 
actions, the United Nations has forsaken the role of peacemaker 
it used to play, overtly siding with the Muslims in the civil 
war going on in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and has discredited the role 
of this organization in the subsequent evolution of events," 
Desimir Jevtic, the ambassador of the Yugoslav Federal Republic 
in Bucharest told a ROMPRES correspondent. 
  The ambassador also said that "the Yugoslav Federal Republic 
firmly condemns the NATO bombings under UN patronage, because 
such actions affect the efforts directed towards stopping the 
civil war and reaching a lasting and peaceful, political 
settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. UN officials invoke 
resolution 836 of the Security Council, while they themselves 
fail to entirely abide by its provisions." 
  "The spring offensive of the Muslims was announced long in 
advance, and it started under the very eyes of United Nations 
and UNPROFOR (United Nations Protection Forces) military 
observers who did nothing to disarm the Muslim troops in Gorazde 
and other protected areas. It was also with the cognizance of 
the foreign observers that 6,000 Muslim military were armed as 
soon as the Serbian side proceeded to self-defensive 
counter-attacks. When the situation on the battlefield turned 
to its (Serbs) advantage, the United Nations resorted to air 
strikes against the Serbs' positions, and this caused the death 
of civilians and the destruction of economic units," the 
ambassador said. 
  "The Yugoslav Federal Republic definitely pronounces against 
a policy of pressure, ultimatum and armed attacks over the 
Serbian areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and shares the conviction 
that all this is far from capable to lead to a peaceful 
settlement. Therefore, the Yugoslav Federal Republic pronounces 
for a cease of all activities against the Serbs in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and for the renunciation of a double-standard 
policy."

<F P=106> [Interview with Romanian President Ion Iliescu by Dominique </F>
Audibert; date and place not given: "Romania: `There Still Is an 
Economic Iron Curtain"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Audibert] The Romanian 
revolution will be five years old at the end of the year. What 
is your assessment? 
  [Iliescu] As for the democratic transition process, I 
believe that we have achieved the most significant reforms, and 
that these have deeply changed Romanian society. We now have a 
multiparty political system with genuine freedom of expression 
and a veritable boom as far as the press is concerned. Over 200 
political parties have emerged, 90 of which participated in the 
various elections, whose fairness nobody questioned. All this 
was done in record time, and the process must of course continue 
and expand. The foundation for a constitutional state and a 
democratic society has now been laid in Romania. 
  [Audibert] But has the rapporteur of the Council of Europe 
not just reminded you of some of your commitments concerning the 
demilitarization of the police and the rights of the Hungarian 
minorities in Romania? 
  [Iliescu] Look, one can find room for improvement in any 
country. I could draw a list, say, for the United States of 
America. We do not view ourselves as perfect in this regard, 
but I do want to stress the fact that we have made considerable 
headway. We are being judged on the matter of national 
minorities, but quite frankly, I do not know of a single country 
in Europe where minorities have comparable rights. Here, all 
minorities are represented in Parliament. Hungarians alone have 
39 representatives in the lower and upper houses, and they can 
study their native tongue in primary and secondary school. Who 
can match this? Not Hungary, I assure you. 
  [Audibert] What about the economic situation? 
  [Iliescu] The Cold War is over, but there still is a 
veritable economic iron curtain between the West and the East in 
general, and Romania in particular. At first, we had the 
theoretical advantage of starting out without being burdened by 
an external debt. In fact, this turned out to be a liability. 
While countries such as Hungary or Poland were showered with 
credits, Romania had to beg, and sometimes it felt it was being 
treated like a second-class country. 
  [Audibert] Is the real reason not the fact that you oppose 
economic reform? 
  [Iliescu] But this is crazy! I am not stupid, I am a 
realist. On the contrary, I believe we need to get rid of any 
ideological prejudices to tackle new national and international 
realities. As soon as I was reelected in 1992, I put forward a 
project to foster national unity between all parties and to 
promote reform and see the country through the transitional 
period. My position remains the same today. There is no 
alternative to a free and competitive market economy, but it 
must include a veritable safety net. The real difficulty is 
reconciling these three imperatives. 
  [Audibert] What causes the deadlock, then? 
  [Iliescu] We have three groups of enemies. First, people 
longing for a return to the previous system, who take advantage 
of an obvious social reality: Since 1989, life has been very 
difficult and, for most people, democracy without any 
improvement in daily life has no value per se. Yet, that old 
system which ensured everyone a minimum wage and which those 
people want to reinstall is pure fiction in an open economy. 
Second are those who would return us to pre-war Romania, who 
cannot see that the real challenge is to integrate the country 
into the European mainstream. Last, there is a mafia whose only 
concern is getting rich by taking advantage of the difficulties 
encountered during any period of transition, and which increases 
corruption. I for one do not have ties with any of these groups. 
  [Audibert] What do you think of the return to power of 
former Communist parties, as in Poland, or their increased 
popularity, as in Hungary or Slovakia? 
  [Iliescu] This stems from a feeling of disappointment from 
people who had applauded the democratization but are 
disappointed by the way right-wing parties have managed the 
transition. So they turn to left-wing forces in the hope that 
they will know how to protect them better. But one should not 
overestimate this phenomenon and its extent. I do not believe 
in any possibility of reverting to the previous system. 
  [Audibert] You were the first to adhere to the "Partnership 
for Peace" formula offered by NATO. Do you think it is enough 
of a security guarantee for Central and Eastern European 
countries? 
  [Iliescu] No, it is not, but it was the best way to avoid 
being discriminated with regard to the Visegrad group (Hungary, 
Czechoslovakia, Poland), for instance. In future, this 
Partnership also needs to become an economic development 
partnership. This is a crucial aspect for security in Europe, 
one that has not been properly dealt with yet. The military 
Iron Curtain is no more, but the economic Iron Curtain may yet 
turn out to be even more damaging, a new source of tensions. 
Instead of indulging in navel-gazing over its small internal 
problems, Europe would do well to become more open to the East 
and to study ways to go beyond such disparities. 
  [Audibert] Many of your neighbors fear new hegemonic 
pretensions from Russia in the region. What about you? 
  [Audibert] Such pretensions exist, there is no doubt about 
it. The Russian problem will remain for a long time a hot issue 
both for Europe and with respect to the global balance of power. 
Russia is and will remain a large country with a huge economic 
and military potential. In such a large entity, transition and 
stabilization are much more complicated issues than in Romania, 
so one sees nationalistic movements cropping up as well as a 
kind of imperial nostalgia -- which is understandable in a 
country which long held a superpower status equal to that of the 
United States. In such a context, the worst mistake one can 
make would be to isolate Russia and exclude it from the general 
process of European partnership and integration. 
  [Audibert] Do you believe in a sustainable solution to the 
Yugoslavian conflict? 
  [Iliescu] Romanians feel strongly about Yugoslavia, which 
was always our best neighbor. We are deeply affected by the 
tragedy of this heroic people, and we have maintained ties with 
all parties. However, I consider that the international 
community must be more attentive and balanced with respect to 
all parties. There is an anti-Serb attitude that is 
inappropriate. This war is a tragedy for everyone, and the 
Serbs have been suffering as much as the others. The only 
sustainable solution is for the belligerents to reach a 
political settlement, with the support of the international 
community. We all know that there cannot be a purely military 
solution. In any event, one thing is certain: the Yugoslav 
problem cannot be solved at the Serb's expense.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/4/1994 -- A flow of 
statements by political personalities of various leanings about 
the likelihood of early elections, a flurry of travelling from 
one territorial branch to another of party executives, seasoned 
with statements of intention of more and more political parties, 
have raised the temperature of the political life in Romania. 
  This animated picture of party life became obvious after the 
government reshuffle of 6 March this year, and some political 
observers see it as a direct effect of the changes made by 
Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu, considered to have dissatisfied all 
the parliamentary political forces. Two weeks after the 
reshuffle, two leading polling institutions were reporting a 
redistribution of the electorate's preferences. Though 
susceptible of interpretations as interests were dictating, the 
results of the two opinion polls revealed a slight advance of 
the opposition on the ruling party, and practically spread among 
Romanian voters the idea of early elections. Asked about such a 
development, many political leaders said early elections were 
untimely. 
  Adrian Nastase, executive president of the ruling Social 
Democracy Party (PDSR), and speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, 
was saying on 29 March that calling early elections "would block 
Romania's political and economic functioning." He was also 
saying that what the polls seemed to indicate was that the 
ruling party was still enjoying a high degree of popularity, 
even if the opposition's hold was increasing. Close to this 
point of view was Corneliu Coposu's (National Peasant Christian 
Democratic Party-PNTCD) assessment that "early elections would 
be noxious for romania, they would halt the on-going of the 
reform, would entail huge expenses, and would carry a pretext 
for social troubles." 
  Concomitantly, the leadership of PDSR started, in mid-March, 
a series of meetings with its local organizations in 
Transylvania and in the counties of Buzau, Bacau, Ploiesti. 
PDSR's executive president explained this as an activization of 
its branches, and denied that his contacts in the province had 
electoral purposes. The following days, however, the parties 
allied with PDSR, and among them were the National Unity Party 
(PUNR), and the Civic Alliance Party (PAC), started a touring 
campaign in the territory, or scheduled such activities for the 
period following. 
  in the meantime, the leadership of the ruling party 
continued 
its meetings with opposition parties, initiated by its honorary 
president, Oliviu Gherman, on 4 February this year through a 
letter sent to PNTCD, Democratic Party-PD(FSN), PAC, 
Social-Democratic Party (PSDR), and to the independent group 
which titles itself "A Future for Romania." The overt 
intention of the ruling party is that the negotiations proposed 
help reach a political pact, apt to bring to light the best 
solutions for the problems of the transition period. The 
Saturday, 9 April dailies were writing about a meeting PDSR was 
planning to have with Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania 
(PDAR) this week, an opportunity for the small parliamentary 
supporter of the ruling party to claim the agriculture 
portfolio, commentators say. 
  It was also at the end of last week that three party 
documents surprisingly had something in common: They were all 
pleading for the necessity of political compromise. The ruling 
party launched the initiative of "the pact for national 
consensus," which maintains that the present internal and 
international context, the world and European developments of 
the moment "compel all the political parties and conglomerates 
that claim to pursue the good of this country to join solidary 
on the platform of national consensus." PD(FSN) launched the 
"Statement of Oradea", and the Democratic Convention of Romania 
(CDR), the largest opposition bloc, issued a "Manifesto for the 
Salvation of Romania." 
  The plea for national consensus by parties of different 
leanings is something new for the political life of Romania 
after December 1989, so far "stimulated" more by party 
interests rather than national interests, often sacrificed for 
the sake of the former.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 12/4/1994 -- The ruling Party of 
Social Democracy (PDSR), presented a document at a Tuesday, 
April 12, press conference of the party treating about the 
social-economic priorities of the PDSR programme, that were 
proposed for discussions with economic experts of other parties. 
  The eight chapters of the document, said PDSR Executive 
Chairman Adrian Nastase, refer to the main objectives of the 
economical-social activity, to the speeding up of privatisation, 
to in-depth restructuring of the fiscal and budgetary policy, to 
the monetary and hard-currency policy, to the putting in place 
of the objectives and priorities regarding foreign economic 
relations, to measures aimed to further the reform in the other 
sectors of the social activity, in fields such as the salary 
policy and welfare. 
  The PDSR executive chairman said that the governing party 
was 
aware of its responsibilities and it would show responsibility, 
consistence, interest as far as the country's destiny is 
concerned, in order to translate into deeds the guiding lines 
and priorities of the economical-social strategy, with a view to 
continue the consolidation of the state of law and ensure real 
social security.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 12/04/1994 -- The leaders of 
the Liberal Party '93 (PL '93) have made their intention known 
to the press by issuing an "Appeal to All Romanians for 
Conciliation and Concord," which also runs as an "invitation" 
extended to the former sovereign of Romania, Mihai I. The 
appeal is signed by 84 members of parliament representing PL 
'93, the Peasant Party (PNTCD), the Civic Alliance Party (PAC), 
the Hungarians' Union (UDMR), the Social Democrats (PSDR), the 
Democrats (PD-FSN), and two independent parliamentarians. It 
shows that on the religious holiday of Easter (Orthodox, 1 May) 
"King Mihai of Romania must be together with all Romanians, in 
the ancestral land, as a citizen of this country, observant of 
its constitutional order." 
  The former sovereign expressed his wish to celebrate Easter 
in Romania, at Timisoara.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/4/1994 -- On 10 April 1994, 
on the occasion of the convening in Bucharest of the annual 
assembly of the Jewish communities in Bucharest, Doru Dumitru 
Palade, minister of research and technology, presented the 
"Declaration of the Government of Romania Regarding the 
Commemoration of the World Day of the Holocaust," which states, 
among other things, the following: 
  "We are evoking, with this opportunity, the painful memory 
of 
the hundreds of thousands of Jews, many of whom were of Romanian 
language and culture, and who, living in the territories 
temporarily snatched away from Romania through the Vienna 
Diktate, were arrested massively and later on deported to 
extermination camps with the approval and the active connivance 
of the occupation Horthyst authorities. Even more painful for 
the Romanian people is the remembrance of the innocent victims 
of the legionnaire terror, the remembrance of the pogrom in 
Iasi, a tragical moment, unprecedented in the history of our 
people, as well as the remembrance of the mass deportations made 
by the military and the Nazi field gendermerie from Bessarabia 
and Dniester, atrocities which Romania did not have at that time 
the means and capacity to oppose. Although Romania," the 
statement further shows, "never surrendered citizens of Jewish 
nationality to the Nazi extermination machine, nor did it 
organise or tolerate others to effect mass deportations from and 
exterminations in its national territory, the memory of the 
attitude of a tolerance fringing on complicity of the then 
Romanian authorities towards the anti-semitic atrocities, the 
remembrance of the vexing racial laws which Romania, following a 
foreign example, but alien to the Romanian traditions and 
feelings, had to pass in those times, are still burdening, more 
than half a century after, the conscience of the Romanian 
people. Unfortunately, like in many European countries, we 
cannot nowadays speak of anti-Semitism, racism, intolerance and 
xenophobia only in the past tense; resurgent traces of this 
bloody insanity are still emerging now and then. We must admit 
with regret that even in this country there are attempts of 
rehabilitating the legionnaire movement, against a background of 
an incomplete description of the World War Two period. 
  The Government of Romania is firmly disapproving of such 
manifestations, that have nothing in common with the spirit and 
traditions of the Romanian people. 
  The Government of Romania is hereby expressing, on this 
occasion, the hope that in the Europe nearing the end of the 
second millennium the efforts directed to the observance of the 
fundamental human rights, to the final elimination of any forms 
of racism, anti-semitism, and xenophobia, will prevail.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 12/4/1994 -- "I am coming to 
Bucharest with an open heart and with optimistic plans. Both 
countries need to cross the threshold of conciliation and, 
moreover, of cooperation, and I hope that in future our peoples 
will work together in friendship," said Imre Pozsgay, president 
of the Democrats' National Alliance of Hungary [MDSZ] on the eve 
of his delegation's visit to Romania. 
  "As far as the Romanian-Hungarian relations are concerned, I 
also wish to add that MDSZ, which the forthcoming elections are 
very likely to usher into parliament, is pursuing a foreign 
policy based on understanding, not on [word indistinct] looking 
back into the past. Only a foreign policy looking ahead at the 
future stands the chance of forging the conditions of 
cooperation between our countries in a united Europe," the 
president of the Democrats' National Alliance of Hungary also 
said. 
  MDSZ President Imre Pozsgay arrived in Bucharest today for a 
visit to Romania. 
  Adrian Nastase, speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, received 
Tuesday, April 12, a Hungarian parliamentary delegation, led by 
independent deputy Imre Pozsgay, co-chairman of the Democrats' 
National Alliance of Hungary. 
  Adrian Nastase and Imre Pozsgay reviewed the political, 
economic and social evolutions in Romania and Hungary in the 
past four years. It was stressed that it was important for the 
two countries to have normal, good neighborliness relations, 
with stress being laid on the necessity to increase economic 
links. 
  Adrian Nastase mentioned that it was essential that 
psychological barriers be overcome, for the progress the two 
parties intend to be put in place in point of their relations. 
  The Hungarian parliamentary delegation had interviews 
Tuesday, April 12, with leaders of the parliamentary groups in 
the Chamber of Deputies, with members of the Foreign Policy 
Commission. The two parties showed willingness to establish 
good neighborly links, to support each other in the two 
countries' activity in international bodies. 
  Imre Pozsgay expressed total confidence in an exemplary 
solution to the problems still causing divergencies. "Our common 
interests are more powerful than our divergencies and all means 
have to be found to pull down existing barriers."

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/4/1994 -- Romanian President 
Ion Iliescu received Monday, April 11, Colombian Foreign 
Minister Noemi Sanin Posada. The stage of Romanian-Colombian 
ties was examined, the way in which projects were fulfilled 
agreed on in the summer of 1993, when Romania's president paid a 
visit to Colombia. 
  The interview occasioned talks on bilateral projects of 
interest and an exchange of opinions on the situation in 
Romania's area. Colombia is interested to enter the 
East-European economic market. President Ion Iliescu spoke to 
the Colombian guest about the economic prospects of his country 
for the period to come. 
  The agreements of scientific and cultural cooperation 
between 
Romania and Colombia are to be followed by commercial, 
interbanking and air transport accords, that are going to 
complete the legal framework necessary for the development of 
bilateral links, Romanian Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu and Colombian 
Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin Posada showed in their Monday, 
April 11 interview. 
  The prime minister proposed, in the presence of Romania's 
Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, that a Chamber of Commerce be 
set up in the month of May, when the Colombian minister of trade 
is scheduled to visit Bucharest, with a view to turn to good 
account projects that have already been sketched, such as the 
production in Romania of sugar and juices. 
  Mrs. Sanin specified that her people was viewing Romania as 
its closest friend in this geographic area. She opined that 
Romania could become one of the main distributors of Colombian 
products in Europe, that a swap of experience and cooperation 
between the two sides could be beneficial for both of them. 
  Premier Vacaroiu was pleased to accept the invitation to 
make 
a visit to Colombia, extended by Foreign Minister Sanin. 
  The minister of foreign relations of the Republic of 
Colombia, Noemi Sanin Posada ended Monday, 11 April, her 
official visit to Romania. On leaving, Mrs. Posada told the 
press that her visit had excellent results, and that her talks 
with the Romanian officials were extremely productive. 
  The Romanian-Colombian cooperation must be boosted mostly in 
what economic ties are concerned, the chief of the Colombian 
diplomacy said, and said her country's minister of foreign trade 
was to visit Romania soon. "We want to import from Romania as 
many cars and steel products as possible, and hope that 
companies in our countries go into closer relations," she said.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 12 (CTK) -- The Slovak Foreign 
Ministry "believes NATO's military intervention will contribute 
to ending confrontation between the hostile sides in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina," a ministry declaration obtained by CTK today reads. 
  The communique states the NATO strike "will lead to the 
resumption of political negotiations under the auspices of 
international organizations." 
  NATO fighters attacked Bosnian Serb positions on Monday [11 
April] afternoon in an attempt to prevent a Serb advance on the 
Bosnian town of Gorazde, a UN designated "safe haven." The 
strike came less than 24 hours after Sunday's strike against 
Bosnian Serbian positions. 
  The ministry's communique expresses concern at the 
escalation 
of the conflict in Bosnia just as new hopes for peace had 
emerged after the end of the siege of Sarajevo. 
  The air strikes demonstrated that the "international 
community is prepared to use even these means to prevent the 
further suffering of the civilian population" in Gorazde, the 
communique reads.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 12 April (CTK) -- "Slovakia has 
found itself at a crossroads. It is important at such a moment 
to say the truth and to give things their proper names, 
otherwise we will lose our orientation," Slovak Premier Jozef 
Moravcik said today, submitting his cabinet's programme to 
parliament. 
  Moravcik declared his belief in the ideals of the November 
1989 revolution. "Values should exist in politics which are 
above political parties. These are values on which the majority 
of Slovak people were united at the end of 1989 -- the 
protection of citizens' rights and freedoms and a democratic 
country," he said. 
  Moravcik said there was no need to invent new paths for 
Slovakia which could only harm its interests. He pointed to the 
danger of opening the question of borders and spoke in favor of 
confirmation of the current borders with all Slovakia's 
neighbors, including Hungary. 
  Moravcik said that the collapse of the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) had a wider background. The HZDS at 
the time of the 1992 parliamentary elections and the HZDS now 
were two different entities, Moravcik said. Key figures had 
left the movement who formed it at its very beginning, and it 
had also lost a considerable part of its voters, he added. He 
ascribed the responsibility for the current political crisis in 
Slovakia and for the necessity of calling early elections to the 
HZDS and the Slovak National Party (SNS), the HZDS's former 
government coalition partner. 
  "We often hear from the HZDS that only this movement is 
capable of forming a functioning government and that only its 
chairman Vladimir Meciar is capable of managing public affairs. 
We should be very vigilant towards such voices. We have our 
own experiences from the period when one party declared itself 
an exceptional one. Stalin and Brezhnev, for example, were also 
convinced that nobody could replace them," Moravcik said. 
  The responsibility for Slovakia's future would be borne by 
all who were living and who decided to live in this country no 
matter how they assessed the appearance of an independent state. 
"Independence for us is a chance to prove our own strength and 
to demonstrate our vitality. At the same time it is also a 
responsibility towards future generations. If we do not 
understand that we should stop dividing ourselves into those 
faithful and more faithful to Slovakia then we will lose our 
republic," Moravcik said. 
  The creation of the government coalition was the only way 
out 
of the current crisis. However, a permanent solution would only 
be brought by new elections. The submitted government programme 
was an alternative which could ensure such a solution, Moravcik 
said. 
  Voting on confidence in Moravcik's government is expected in 
Parliament on Wednesday [13 April].

  [Text] Bratislava, April 12 (CTK) -- Slovak Deputy Premier 
Brigita Schmognerova today in an address to parliament asked for 
support from deputies and citizens for the tough measures her 
government was going to pursue in order to make up for 
ex-premier Meciar government's mistakes. 
  "The government has not taken over an easy heritage," said 
Schmognerova at today's parliamentary debate on the government 
programme. 
  She said that in addition to economic recession and the 
breakup of the federation, the previous cabinets incompetence 
and hindrance of reforms were to blame for the bad state of the 
Slovak economy. 
  As a result, gross domestic product fell last year by 4.1 
percent, industrial production by 13.5 percent and construction 
work by 25 percent. Slovakia's foreign trade deficit was nearly 
27 billion crowns, the state sector's debt reached 60 billion 
crowns and prices grew by 23 percent. Fifty-seven percent of 
all enterprises were loss-making. 
  "This government could have chosen the easier path of 
preserving the present status quo without the unpleasant impact 
of unpopular measures, whereby it would have achieved a good 
pre-election position," said Schmognerova. 
  She stressed that reaching the government's stated goals -- 
approaching zero GDP growth, a 10-13 percent inflation rate, 
unemployment below 17 percent and a budget deficit below four 
percent -- would be very complicated and would require public 
support.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 12 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government 
of Premier Jozef Moravcik today called on the chairmen of 
several district councils to leave their offices. 
  Several days after Slovak President Michal Kovac's address 
in 
parliament, considered to be the start of the process which led 
to the dismissal of Vladimir Meciar's cabinet, 17 district 
council chairmen and two government commissioners signed a 
statement accusing the president of "gross insult to 
parliamentary democracy." They said Kovac deliberately 
destabilized the political scene and discredited Meciar's 
government in his speech. 
  "The district council chairmen who signed the statement 
violated the professional honor and committed a serious offense 
incompatible with the exercising of high administrative 
functions," Slovak Deputy Premier Ivan Simko told journalists 
today after the cabinet meeting. 
  Moravcik's government believed that after taking the office 
it provided these district council chairmen enough time to 
apologies to President Kovac and to reassess their stand, 
Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus said. "This is a moral appeal and 
not an appeal for political reasons," he added. 
  Asked if controls of district councils' activities could be 
expected Simko said that the government had ordered internal 
controls in all branches including the central state 
administration bodies.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, April 11 (CTK) -- "The Christian 
Democratic Movement (KDH) wants to keep its identity, its KDH 
label, at all costs," KDH Chairman Jan Carnogursky says in an 
interview for the independent daily SME. Everything is possible 
concerning the emergence of pre-election alliances between 
Slovak right-wing parties, except for the possibility of KDH 
joining any new party, "named, let us say, the Right Bloc, in 
which individual parties would lose their identity and would 
create a joint list of candidates," Carnogursky says. 
  He explains the KDH's idea that all right-oriented parties 
(the Party of Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen, the Democratic Party, 
the Alliance of Democrats, the groupings around Ludovit Cernak 
and Jozef Moravcik) should create a free alliance, with each of 
these parties relying on its own list of candidates for the 
elections. Later all these parties, or some of them, would ally 
in a group, under the election law, or create a joint list of 
candidates. 
  If it turns out that any of the above parties is unable to 
acquire parliamentary representation, the KDH is ready to put a 
few people on its list as independent candidates, Carnogursky 
says. The Slovak right wing should be united by the end of 
July, when the lists of candidates have to be submitted, he 
adds. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bratislava, April 12 (CTK) -- "If the government 
treats us correctly we will never betray it," Stefan Harna, a 
deputy from Egyutteles (Coexistence), a Hungarian minority 
movement in Slovakia, told journalists today. 
  Duka-Zolyomi, chairman of the Egyutteles deputies' group, 
added that the movement's cooperation with the new government 
had been good thus far. Hungarian minority parties had had an 
opportunity to participate in the coalition council's talks when 
the government's programme was drafted and Hungarian deputies 
would therefore support the programme, Harna said. 
  Harna was reacting to information that some Hungarian 
deputies would allegedly not support the programme. Deputy Erno 
Rozsa condemned efforts to place Hungarian parties once more in 
the role of enemy. 
  Harna said Hungarian parties, through no fault of their own, 
had found themselves in a position in which their votes would 
decide the future of the current Slovak Government. 
  Rozsa noted that the current election law was adequate as it 
ensured calling early elections and that there was in fact 
nothing to change in it. The law guarantees the right of ethnic 
minorities' representatives to enter parliament and defend their 
rights.

<F P=106> [Report by Zamira Koleci] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer] The country continues to express deep 
indignation against the criminal act by the Greek chauvinists 
who took the lives of two Albanian officers and wounded several 
others. As we have learned, President Berisha last evening met 
with political party representatives, government members, and 
chairmen of various associations to discuss this tragic and 
painful event. 
  [Koleci] The president's press and information office 
reports that President Sali Berisha yesterday afternoon 
organized a meeting attended by Meksi, Vukaj, Malasi, Serreqi, 
[Public Order Minister] Musaraj, [Social Democratic Party 
Chairman] Gjinushi, Laco, [Republican Party Chairman] Godo, 
Shamata, Hajdaraga, Kola, and [Independent Trade Union Chairman] 
Xheka to discuss the massacre that one of the Greek commando 
units carried out with premeditation in the early hours of 
Sunday [10 April] in the recruiters barracks in Peshkepi e 
Siperme, 4 km into Albanian territory. 
  President Berisha stressed that this act is a real massacre 
and an unprecedented violation of Albania's integrity and 
sovereignty since 1949. This marks an open hostile act by 
Greece against Albania and is a continuation of other 
terroristic acts committed by Greek forces, such as the case of 
the murder of the shepherd in Devoll and the assault on our 
warship in our own waters. All of these -- even though they are 
documented -- have been negated by the Greek Government through 
dishonest means. 
  For the past two years, Berisha continued, we have made 
intensive efforts to develop cooperation and relations with 
Greece. We have tried and will continue to try so that the 
Greek minority in Albania and our emigrants in Greece will be a 
powerful factor of cooperation and understanding between our two 
peoples and countries. 
  Unfortunately, I would say, for the misfortune of the Greek 
Government circles, we have ascertained that the Greek side has 
used Albanian emigrants as a means of pressure against Albania, 
even openly making calls for its destabilization. Concerning 
the minority, attempts have been made to manipulate it and turn 
it into an apple of discord for Albania. 
  Berisha stressed that our policy toward the minority cannot 
change because of the absurd stance of the Greek Government and 
officials toward Albania. The president continued to say that 
the minority is and will be free citizens of Albania. We will 
continue our efforts for the expansion of human rights and 
freedoms for Albanians and the minority. 
  Further on, Berisha reconfirmed his determination and that 
of 
the government to persistently continue the policy of decreasing 
the tension and contributing toward peace and stability in the 
region, something that is not at all desired by those who are 
interested in creating tensions and conflicts. 
  On the other hand, the Albanian president informed those 
present that the government is making all the demarches to 
friendly countries and international organizations to condemn 
this grave act of terrorism on the part of Greece and ask her to 
put an end to this policy by finding and convicting its 
culprits. The Albanian Government will take every measure to 
counteract terror of any kind and secure its own citizens. 
  Those present supported the statement by President Berisha 
and considered this meeting very useful. They strongly 
condemned the ugly and terroristic act against Albania and 
supported the constructive policy of the Albanian Government in 
the region. They also asked the government to condemn this 
terrorist act to the UN Security Council and international 
organizations and take all measures to see that such acts are no 
longer repeated. 
  They also asked the Albanian Government to continue to 
oppose 
the policy of Hellenism in the south of the country and expand 
its policy on preserving peace and stability in the region. 
Those present at the meeting said that everyone should clearly 
understand that when it is a question of the national question, 
the Albanians are and will remain a sole voice.

  [Text] [Announcer] In a plenary session this morning, the 
People's Assembly approved a draft statement presented by the 
Permanent Parliamentary Commissions of Foreign Policy, Defense, 
Public Order, and ShIK [National Information Service] regarding 
the criminal act of 10 April by Greek terrorists against 
Albania's integrity and sovereignty. 
  [Begin recording of unidentified speaker at the People's 
Assembly] As you have been informed, an incident occurred on 
the Albanian-Greek border on 10 April 1994 that ended in a 
tragic event -- two Albanian officers lost their lives, three 
others were wounded, and many others' lives were endangered. 
  To honor the memory of the martyrs, these two youths who 
lost 
their lives in their prime, I invite you to stand up and honor 
their memory with a minute's silence. May their memory not be 
forgotten. 
  The Foreign Affairs and Defense Commissions met yesterday to 
analyze this incident. They presented a draft statement to the 
People's Assembly, which, after being discussed in the 
presidency with the chairmen of the parliamentary groups, was 
later discussed in the parliamentary groups as well. I will now 
read this draft statement: 
  The People's Assembly of the Republic of Albania is deeply 
indignant over the unprecedented criminal act of 10 April that 
was committed by Greek terrorists against Albania's integrity 
and sovereignty. 
  According to the official confirmation, at approximately 
0230 
a Greek terrorist unit of seven armed people dressed in Greek 
military uniforms entered Albanian territory near the Peshkepi 
village in the Gjirokaster district. Penetrating approximately 
4 km, at a recruits training center two of them surprised and 
killed with an automatic weapon Arsen Llazar Gjini, an 
18-year-old soldier from the village of Seman in the Fier 
district. After this act, four others entered the officers' 
dormitory while the officers were sleeping and opened fire on 
them. The 33-year-old head of training, Captain First Class 
Fatmir Sali Shehu, born in Tepelene and resident of Gjirokaster, 
was shot dead in this barbarous act. Three soldiers were 
wounded and many others' lives were endangered. While these 
inhuman acts were being committed, one of the terrorists shouted 
in Greek: This is for Vorio-Epir, do not think we have 
forgotten. 
  After this act, the unit -- pursued by Albanian border 
guards 
-- left and crossed the Greek border. The direction of the 
pursuit proved that the unit came from the direction of the 
Greek post of Argjirohor. 
  This was a premeditated act carried out by a criminal group, 
for which the Greek Government bears full responsibility. Such 
events on our border have been recurrent, despite the protests 
and careful stance maintained by our government. Under the 
present extremely tense situation in the Balkans, an escalation 
of such events endangers the progress of relations that exist 
between our two countries. Albania is a democratic country that 
respects all principles and known international norms in 
relations between states and is devoting every effort tries to 
creating a climate of understanding, peace, and equilibrium in 
the Balkans. However, such events run contrary to international 
and EC efforts for peace and stability. 
  The People's Assembly of Albania asks the parliament of the 
Republic of Greece to see to it that the Greek Government bear 
responsibility for this act and condemn those responsible, as 
well as take serious measures to prevent a repetition of such 
events, which can cause unforeseen developments to the detriment 
of our bilateral relations and peace in the Balkans. 
  We urge all international organizations to exert all their 
influence on the Greek parliament and Government for a rapid 
solution to this tense situation created by the Greek side. 
  Deeply feeling the pain of the victims' families as a common 
Albanian pain, the People's Assembly of the Republic of Albania, 
the legitimate representative of the Albanian people, extends 
its deepest sympathy to them. 
  By unanimously condemning and denouncing such a criminal 
act, 
the People's Assembly of the Republic of Albania asks that all 
Albanian citizens remain calm and mature in keeping with our 
people and the determination for the country's defense and the 
preservation of peace and good neighborliness. 
  The People's Assembly of the Republic of Albania. [applause] 
  Deputies, I invite you to approve this draft statement 
through a consensus. The statement, as I can see, is 
unanimously approved. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] The People's Assembly will devote a whole 
plenary session to the discussion of this grave event at 1000 on 
15 April, when Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi and Public Order 
Minister Agron Musaraj will address the deputies.

  [Text] After repeated queries on our part, a few minutes 
ago Raycho Raykov, head of the government Press Center, issued 
the following announcement: 
  Having recuperated from his cardiac bypass operation on 12 
March, Professor Berov began taking an active part in the work 
of the Council of Ministers on 7, 8, and 10 April. 
  According to information received at 0900 on 13 April from 
Dr. Todor Gerasimov, head of Lozenets Hospital, the condition of 
the prime minister's cardiovascular system and blood circulation 
continues to be stable. 
  However, on 11 April a change in Prof. Berov's health 
condition was noted. The clinical conclusion was that there was 
the possibility of hepatitis. Specialized laboratory tests are 
under way and the results will be published in a day or two. 
  According to Dr. Gerasimov, because of the development of a 
clinical picture of the hepatitis virus, Prof. Berov is in 
quarantine. He will have no personal contacts in the next few 
days.

  [Text] The Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] will await the 
National Assembly's discussion of the interpellation of the SDS 
deputies on the government's financial policy, and if the draft 
decision that negatively assesses the government policy is not 
supported, a no-confidence vote will be proposed. This was 
decided at today's meeting of the SDS National Coordinating 
Council. 
  The behavior of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] shows 
that very little could be achieved through parliamentary 
methods, Filip Dimitrov said. However, he did not say what 
extraparliamentary actions the SDS plans to prompt the 
resignation of the cabinet and early elections. 
  At an extraordinary meeting next Wednesday [20 April] the 
chairmen of the member parties of the SDS coalition will discuss 
the SDS' strategy and tactics. The parties must propose the 
criteria according to which the future SDS deputies will be 
approved. 
  The SDS will not support the strike prepared by the 
Executive 
Committee of the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in 
Bulgaria, but it does expect the strike to facilitate the 
toppling of the cabinet.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandur Tomov, chairman of the Civic </F>
Alliance for the Republic, by Todor Tokin; place and date not 
given: "We Will Support Any Government That Brings About the 
Country's Stabilization"] 
  [Text] The chairman of GOR [Civic Alliance for the 
Republic] is nearing his 40th birthday. Last July he left the 
BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party], and 10 days later also left the 
Socialists' parliamentary group. The GOR has almost 800 local 
and 110 municipal organizations. 
  [Tokin] Mr. Tomov, how do you assess the economic and 
political situation in Bulgaria at the moment? 
  [Tomov] I think that the situation has become extremely 
heated at an awkward time, and the politicians are the main 
cause of this. Many people have lost their nerve who are 
striving at all costs to seize power. What is more, it is clear 
that some people have become scared that if we sign the 
agreement with the IMF and the banks of the London Club, this 
will happen without them and they will be unable to utilize the 
substantial sums that the world organizations are granting. I 
think this political gambling with margins is untimely and very 
harmful for the country. Unfortunately, the general situation 
at the moment is destructive. In Zlatograd recently someone 
said to me: "At one time Simeon Radev wrote `The Builders of 
Modern Bulgaria'; today someone around will probably write a 
book called `Destroyers of Modern Bulgaria.'" 
  [Tokin] Have things really become as bad as that? 
  [Tomov] Today very few people think about the consequences 
and the cost of the changes that they are demanding. Every 
spring, political schizophrenia breaks out in Bulgaria, and this 
is the fifth year in which it has happened. 
  [Tokin] Did the president not add fuel to the flames by 
saying in London that the government is sick? Who would 
conclude the expected agreements with a sick government? 
  [Tomov] To blacken the name of the state and the state 
institutions abroad harms Bulgaria, whatever the reasons are. 
In civilized countries, no one makes assessments of their 
government when abroad. If you want people to respect you 
abroad, you should say only nice things about Bulgaria. 
Accordingly, I do not think the president's statement in London 
was constructive. Second, I have always advised him to act as 
an arbiter and stand above the national parties and the 
situation at the time, above petty feuds and petty aims. This 
is the president's constitutional role, one that cannot be 
replaced, in view of the weakness of the institutions and the 
power vacuum. In his statements President Zhelev took sides, 
and when he has taken one side, he has always lost. If he does 
not do so, he will always win. 
  [Tokin] How do you view the other statement he made in 
London, about the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces], NSD [New 
Alliance for Democracy], DPS [Rights and Freedoms Movement], and 
the independent members of parliament forming a government? 
  [Tomov] The president probably does have some idea of this 
kind. However, first, it was not the right place to announce 
such a thesis; second, such a prospect is not very realistic. 
Offers of this kind are made when it is clear that they will be 
accepted. When a head of state makes such statements and it 
turns out that everything is hanging in the air and that those 
who are expected to form this government do not want to hear 
anything about it and make statements to the opposite effect, 
this naturally dooms such proposals to failure and does not 
increase the authority of the head of state. 
  [Tokin] What kind of government does the GOR advocate? 
  [Tomov] We will support any government that brings about the 
country's stabilization and solves the two great problems, 
namely signing the agreements with the IMF and the creditor 
banks. If this comes about, if the government guarantees 
relative stability for the lev and skillfully manages the scanty 
reserves at our disposal, then this would be of benefit. If, 
however, the country is thrown into chaos, the people who make 
the political provocations will have to take the responsibility. 
  It is possible to achieve a political consensus on holding 
elections in the fall, but at the moment, when this outcome is 
being forced upon us by declaring that the government is 
useless, by holding rallies, and by launching attacks on the 
Bulgarian lev -- something that I regard as especially 
dangerous, all this leads to destructive tendencies. This is 
the scenario offered to us by the people who want elections as 
soon as possible. Here I would like to stress that GOR has no 
commitments to the present government. We can see its numerous 
weaknesses. Accordingly, if someone proposes replacing it by a 
better one, the GOR will support this idea. However, is there 
anyone who can make such an offer? If the government simply 
falls now, and the elections are not held until October or 
November, this will lead to five or six months of chaos, and we 
will find ourselves in a situation of spiralling inflation -- 
this is my solemn warning. 
  [Tokin] Nevertheless, now that the president has withdrawn 
his confidence in the present government, which government will 
sign the agreements? 
  [Tomov] Any legitimate government can do this, but not a 
caretaker government or one that has been toppled. If anyone 
topples Lyuben Berov's cabinet now and no new alternative 
cabinet is formed quickly, then it is possible that no 
agreements will be signed. 
  The thesis that Ivan Kostov developed last week, that it is 
impossible to maintain the dollar at a reasonable level and at 
the same time sign the agreements, is actually a thesis against 
the agreements. However, as we saw, the next day following his 
statements the IMF slapped down this thesis by announcing that 
the issue will be examined before 11 April. I maintain that the 
lev can be saved if the agreements are signed and if we receive 
the first tranche by 15-20 April. 
  [Tokin] In the meantime, there is talk about a "blue" [SDS] 
caretaker cabinet.... 
  [Tomov] If Dr. Zhelev appoints a caretaker government, this 
government will probably have such a tinge, despite the fact 
that a balance should be maintained. The best thing would be 
for it to be composed of people who have no direct commitment as 
regards the elections and who will not be tempted to act in 
favor of one or another party. 
  [Tokin] What do you think about applying value-added tax to 
newspapers? 
  [Tomov] We cannot deviate from European standards. As I 
have said in parliament, it is ridiculous for us to have rates 
three or four times higher than the average European ones. I 
look at the issue purely pragmatically: The revenue that the 
budget receives from the press is insignificant. I say that the 
taxation policy proposed by Ivan Kostov is totally wrong. To 
me, it is a policy favored by tax collectors. 
  [Tokin] Would you agree to lead a cabinet now, at this 
moment? 
  [Tomov] I hardly have a moral right to do this within the 
term of the present National Assembly. Nonetheless, I will say 
that the problems facing a politician are now quite specific, 
that is, everything depends on the balance of forces inside 
parliament. I would associate myself with a government on one 
sole condition, namely if I feel that I have solid support 
behind me both in parliament and in the nation at large. I am 
especially interested in the latter. Moreover, I would want to 
be given a free rein to do what I want. Change must come about 
in Bulgaria. Bulgaria needs a new choice. 
  [Tokin] Do you remain an optimist, despite everything you 
have said about concluding the agreements with the financial 
institutions? 
  [Tomov] Yes. This is a chance for Bulgaria to escape from 
the present situation and join the family of civilized states. 
  If we fail because of political machinations, the whole 
blame 
will fall on the shoulders of those "Bulgarian politicians" who 
cannot see any further than their own noses.

<F P=106> [Lazar Tomov commentary: "Eliminating Shoulder Straps"] </F>
  [Text] In all probability the massive "shock" dismissal of 
officers and sergeants will afflict the depleted ranks of the 
Bulgarian Army. This became clear after the second meeting of 
the Consultative Council on National Security. At the meeting 
Defense Minister Aleksandrov reportedly declared his Ministry's 
inability to feed the Army. Therefore, in the near future we 
could be relying on a 55,000-man Army. The food will suffice 
only for such a size. 
  Everyone understands that even the present armed forces 
personnel cannot guarantee the country's national security and 
integrity. This is also well known to our benevolent (for the 
time being) neighbors in the Balkans. In addition, no one 
doubts that the results of the "reform" in the army in the last 
four years have amounted to dismissing 2,000 officers. 
  The new element now is that the 3,000 officers and almost 
1,000 sergeants who have been marked (in the best case) for 
"gradual" dismissal will be requalified according to a U.S. 
model. Thus, after comprehensively using the Soviet leading 
experience, now we are advancing toward using the U.S. 
experience. The minister reportedly proposed other novelties: 
As consolation, the officers and sergeants dismissed will 
receive securities rather than the 12-months of wages that they 
are entitled to. Perhaps he wants to turn them into stock 
market dealers? 
  The methodology of a British military institute has also 
been 
used for the envisaged cuts. However, we do not know whether 
this methodology also recommends cuts in the drastically 
inflated payroll of the high-ranking officers on the General 
Staff and in the Defense Ministry. And another thing, is our 
army not turning into a producer of young pensioners? 
  Is is not more appropriate to adopt first the national 
security concept and pass the Law on Defense and the Armed 
Forces? Otherwise all this resembles cutting off the head of 
the army. It also reminds us of the experiments of the "father 
of all nations" [Stalin], who from 1937 until the beginning of 
the war against Germany "purged" his army of its talented and 
able officers. We know the results of this purge. Let us hope 
that we will not have to experience those results in our country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Surjan, welfare minister and chairman </F>
of the Christian Democratic People's Party, by Pal Reti; place 
and date not given: "Silence and Espousal"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Reti] Your party succeeded 
in causing a sensation last week with the privatization issue, 
which has become the party's number one campaign issue. Why is 
the leadership of the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] 
-- a party that wants to present itself as a careful center 
party -- demanding a radical step like a complete and almost 
immediate stop of the privatization process? 
  [Surjan] This proposal is nothing else but to encourage some 
thoughtfulness. We are not particularly happy if a state 
enterprise is sold at a price that is four times higher than the 
declared price, like in the case of the Budapest Kozert because, 
in this case, the real value can be even ten times higher than 
the original price. The KDNP views on privatization are 
different from those of the other two coalition partners, but 
this in itself should not lead to the breaking of our 
friendship. The symbolic break of a few weeks in signing 
contracts between the last day of the current Parliament and the 
first day of the new Parliament can also be interpreted as a 
gesture to the Hungarian parliamentary life. However, I hope 
that no one will see the KDNP as a party that denies the need 
for privatization. [passage omitted] 
  [Reti] When it became clear that, contrary to its bigger 
coalition partner, the KDNP is basing its campaign on criticism, 
rather than mainly on the embellishment of the past four years, 
you often declared that you accept as much from the past as your 
share in the coalition. What is the acceptable one-seventh of 
the coalition of Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]-Smallholders' 
Party- KDNP? 
  [Surjan] One could also put this question even more nastily, 
namely whether we accept everything that is good and nothing 
that is bad. If the activity of this coalition is ever analyzed 
objectively, and not in the heat of the election campaign, the 
balance will clearly be positive. Take, for example, the 
poverty issue. The poorest 20 percent of Hungarian society has 
advanced as much as the richest 10 percent since 1988. The 
percentage of welfare expenses related to the GNP increased from 
14 percent to 18 percent. Obviously, we had to withdraw these 
funds from production, and if we want a lasting development in 
the next four years, we will have to rethink the welfare 
distribution as well. [passage omitted] 
  [Reti] According to opinion polls that you do not value too 
highly, the KDNP was at the top in the fall of 1993. At that 
time the party "signed up" big names like former finance 
minister Ferenc Rabar, industry minister Janos Latorcai, and 
state secretary Pal Becker. Your party's popularity has been 
dropping since then. Have you, perhaps, started the campaign 
too early? 
  [Surjan] I would not like to send the "message" to opinion 
pollsters that I do not appreciate them, but it is a fact that 
they regarded us at around 2 percent in the previous elections. 
If the KDNP again gets three times as much as the "predicted" 
4-8 percent, we will be in quite a good position. As for the 
early campaign, we had quite a good publicity in the fall of 
1993; then, when our ways parted with the MDF, the KDNP began 
receiving less publicity in the media. Television reports on 
the party and me were not aired, and important events in the 
party were not reported, or were reported insufficiently. All 
this is reflected in the opinion polls. [passage omitted] 
  [Reti] However, the KDNP has a good chance to overcome the 
changes. None of the parliamentary parties rejects the KDNP as 
a possible partner. As for your economic program -- a "not 
hasty" privatization and a "social sensitivity" -- it mostly 
resembles that of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. 
However, so far, KDNP leaders have only answered with disdain 
to the MSZP approaches and mentioned their "quilted jacket" past. 
  [Surjan] I can only rejoice at any common elements in any 
party's program, because this increases the chances of 
implementing these programs. However, the quilted jacket is a 
symbol, a symbol of the organization that continues to live in 
the MSZP and thus, it is a continuation of the Hungarian 
Communists' Party [MKP] and the Hungarian Workers' Party [MDP], 
but has not apologized for their crimes. At the same time, the 
MSZP is one of the most complex parties: It includes the 
national-populist Tabajdi, Annus, and Szuros, who played a 
positive role in the past too, but I do not know how they will 
be able to cooperate with the Hajdu-group; nor do I know how the 
liberal wing close to the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] 
will cooperate with the Sandor Nagy-group. In principle, a 
social democratic party is capable of partnership with both 
liberal and socialist parties. Therefore, this is not a 
principled rejection. But, the way many people questioned our 
real Christian democratic line until I was elected deputy 
chairman of the European Christian Democratic Union, the same 
way we can also say that the MSZP, which has only an observer 
status in the Socialist International, has not yet received a 
similar international legitimacy. 
  [Reti] Would you accept the position of prime minister in a 
government coalition in which a current opposition party has 
more votes than the KDNP? 
  [Surjan] Yes I would, but with certain conditions, namely to 
refrain from having to make unprincipled compromises for power. 
The new coalition must be functional with 55-60 percent of the 
votes. 
  [Reti] After some detours, the KDNP has again included the 
direct election of the president of the republic into its 
program. Who is your candidate? 
  [Surjan] The authority of the president of the republic is 
well formulated in Hungary today, and we do not want to broaden 
his authority. It is too early to nominate a candidate, but it 
is sure that the position requires a different person if he has 
to be accepted by the whole country through an election 
campaign, instead of only being elected by Parliament.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Undecided Voters With Antipathies"] </F>
  [Text] Before the elections, when deciding on which party 
to vote for, the voters apply both positive and negative 
considerations. Thus, they regard some parties as worthy of 
their votes and exclude others. However, at the end of this 
decision process, some kind of positive approach emerges in the 
actual voting, because voters do vote in favor of some party 
after all. According to the Szonda Ipsos opinion poll, 12 
percent of the citizens only express their antipathy at the 
moment: They only name the parties for which they would 
definitely not vote, but they do not name the parties for which 
they might vote. We asked 3,000 people in February and March 
1994, and we are only considering those of voting age now. 
  The exclusivity of party aversion is mainly characteristic 
of 
high school and university graduates, and 15 percent of each 
group mentioned a party they would definitely not vote for, and 
these have not formulated a clear sympathy either. The higher 
the educational level, the more people can be listed among those 
with party aversion. The same applies to the positive approach: 
The more educated they are, the more probable it is that they 
are sympathetic toward a certain party. We also found another 
characteristic among those who expressed their lack of 
preference: They can be found mostly in the towns (15 percent 
in Budapest and 13 percent in provincial towns), rather than in 
the villages (8 percent). However, we could find no age 
differences: This attitude is equally characteristic of old 
people, middle-aged people, and young people. 
  Some 29 percent of those who have a negative approach to the 
political parties regard the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] as 
the most disliked party. This list continues with the 
Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP], with 21 percent of the 
people rejecting it. The fourth on this negative "top list" is 
the Labor Party with 13 percent, closely followed by the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] with 12 percent. Few show any 
definite antipathy toward the other parties: 7 percent 
mentioned the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], 6 percent 
the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP], 4 percent the 
Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], and 2 percent the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. The negative preferences of 
the intelligentsia within this group slightly differ from the 
average: More intellectuals exclude the FGKP than the MDF. 
  No one in this group has a party preference that he would 
vote for, but this does not mean that these people will renounce 
their right to vote. Their willingness to vote is above 
average: Some 69 percent of these regard themselves as certain 
voters if the elections were held today, and 18 percent said 
they would probably vote. This considerable desire to vote will 
probably mean actual participation in the elections in May. 
These people's election forecasts can provide some basis to the 
question of their actual voting preferences. Lacking a clear 
party preference, it is possible that they will vote for a party 
that they think will win the elections. Several people forecast 
the victory of two parties: Some 17 percent think that the SZDSZ 
will win, and 16 percent think that the MSZP will win. Only 7 
percent think of the MDF and 5 percent the Fidesz as victors. 
As for the other parties, these give them minimal chances of 
victory. There is still a great deal of uncertainty in this 
group because 48 percent did not mention any party. 
  Therefore, this group of people with party aversion is a 
politically active group, and the current opposition parties can 
count heavily on their votes; but not so the government 
coalition parties.

<F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "The S-300 Missile Is Coming -- </F>
Military Equipment in Exchange for Debts"] 
  [Text] According to information from the diplomatic corps 
in Budapest, following the Russian prime ministers's recent 
visit to Hungary and the exchange of expert views, the chances 
of getting military technology from Russia in exchange for the 
outstanding Russian debt to Hungary have increased considerably. 
We are talking about armored personnel carriers, as the current 
stock of such carriers in Hungary has become obsolete. 
  In addition, we can also count on the S-300 air defense 
missile system. This is a system resembling the Patriot 
missiles used in the Gulf War. It transpires from the study 
recently published in MAGYAR HONVED [HUNGARIAN SOLDIER] that the 
updated version of this S-300 missile is capable of intercepting 
targets flying at a speed of 10,000 km/hour from a distance of 
90-150 km. It can be used against both aircraft and missiles. 
Prior to the end of the Warsaw Pact, the first and relatively 
cheaper version of this system was exported to the CSSR and 
Bulgaria. Defense Ministry leaders repeatedly expressed their 
view that Hungary needs this missile system.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Gorazde With Variations"] </F>
  [Text] We cannot yet know whether the NATO bombing on 
Monday [11 April], a repetition of the bombing on Sunday, at 
Gorazde is the start of regular aerial activity against the 
attacking Serbs or whether it was, once again, an isolated 
punitive action. Experience from wars indicates that a military 
situation cannot be decided solely by air power. Especially not 
when the military operation is limited to one or two bombs that 
happen to be dropped a day. 
  We also know from Hungarian history that a bit of bombing 
like this only helps the bombed side find an excuse to do 
something that it had not dared do before; however, it is not 
suitable for changing the existing intentions. The still 
unclear bombing [in 1942] of Kassa [Kosice, now in Slovakia] was 
an excellent opportunity for the Hungarian Government to declare 
war on the Soviet Union. One year later, when the British 
destroyed the Zilahy house on the Rose Hill [district in 
Budapest] with bombs, one thought that Budapest would quit the 
war -- perhaps this was not the goal of the Brits anyway. In 
addition to this, precisely at this time, the Germans were 
marching an apparent irresistible force across the Russian 
steppe. However, the English bombing was very good for creating 
an Anglo-Saxon enemy image in Hungary. 
  When the United Nations, in the shape of NATO, began the 
aerial attacks on the Serbian artillery and tanks besieging the 
Bosnian towns, it was exactly two years late. A spectacular and 
shocking aerial attack would only have made sense, perhaps, at 
the very beginning of the Bosnian war. At that time, it might 
have been able to deter those who were eager to fight from the 
accidental unleashing of a war that many people had expected 
with absolute certainty. However, at that time, no UN 
resolutions or NATO preparations existed. 
  It is also questionable whether the current aerial attacks 
have any military purpose. The liberation of Gorazde and the 
other "protected areas," and that the Serbs suspend the military 
maneuvers aimed at occupying these areas, could be such a goal. 
This has little chance. If this is known in Budapest, it is 
obviously known in Brussels, New York, Aviano, and in the field. 
In that case, why are they bombing? We can risk saying that 
there are many reasons, but that none of them have much to do 
with establishing peace in Bosnia. 
  Teaching Karadzic and his followers a lesson may be a goal, 
because they have become far too "insolent." They had the 
audacity to launch an all-out attack on Gorazde when, after the 
decision on the Bosnian-Croatian federation in Bosnia and the 
confederation in Zagreb, it seemed that a prescription might be 
found for a peace system in the whole former Yugoslavia. 
Retaliation was needed for the disappointment. Perhaps it was 
also among the assumed that an effect would be that that the 
Serbs in Belgrade would give up their solidarity with their 
brethren in Bosnia. This did not happen. 
  It is also possible that they also wanted to roast Moscow a 
little bit. Although its unrequested involvement in the 
ultimatum situation in Sarajevo indeed helped progress, since 
then, Kozyrev and Co. have been saying a trifle too often that 
Russia continues to be a superpower, a major power, that it 
cannot be excluded, and so on. Perhaps, it had to be shown that 
the earth can continue to move without it. 
  Finally, the fact that the bombing at Gorazde was again a 
CNN 
spectacular cannot be ignored. The U.S. public recently again 
began to demand, more emphatically, that "we should at last do 
something definite" in Bosnia. On the morning of 10 April, the 
pictures of the determined action arrived in U.S. homes.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Endre Aczel: "AWACS Dilemma"] </F>
  [Text] Now that a NATO air strike was delivered against 
the attacking Serbs in the area of Gorazde in Bosnia, albeit a 
very limited air strike, I find it essential to remind the 
readers that this was the second time that the AWACS aircraft 
(also) patrolling the Hungarian air space helped NATO in its 
combat activity in Bosnia. The difference now is that, on 10 
April, the Hungarian Defense Ministry in Budapest acknowledged 
the fact that there were AWACS aircraft in Hungarian airspace on 
the day of the attack; as for the attack carried out a few weeks 
ago, there were only speculation that the reconnaissance planes 
flying in the Hungarian airspace were the first to notice the 
appearance of the two Serbian Galeb aircraft downed over Bosnia. 
  In other words, we lost our "innocence" earlier, 
irrespective 
of Prime Minister Peter Boross' promise to preserve it, a 
promise made during his international news conference on 11 
February. 
  Let us stop for a moment at this point. We should answer the 
question of whether the prime minister made a hasty declaration 
and an impossible promise or not. 
  I can say that Hungary's effort to keep away from the armed 
conflict in Bosnia is a fully legitimate and correct effort. 
Hungary's direct national interest requires this, irrespective 
of whether it is aiming at NATO membership or not. (Regarding 
the weight of the national interest, let me bring up the example 
of the NATO-member Greece, which, out of fear for its territory, 
placed Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM] under a boycott, although this is precisely the 
post-Yugoslav republic that blocks the possible spreading of the 
flames of the Yugoslav conflict to Greece and, subsequently, to 
NATO territory). 
  On the other hand, once the Hungarian Government (under 
Jozsef Antall) allowed the AWACS aircraft into Hungary, it 
obviously must have been aware of the fact that its patrolling 
activity will be a constant one. In others words, this mission 
could lose its goal if it had to constantly report to Budapest 
about the hostile activity in Bosnia and ask permission for NATO 
participation in fighting against this development. This is an 
absurd situation. Budapest is definitely not present in the 
"chain of command" linking the UN forces in Bosnia, the UN 
secretary general (or his emissary), and NATO. 
  However, I would like to point out Boross' presumed dilemma, 
which must have led to his incriminated declaration disapproved 
of by NATO circles. This is a real dilemma, because the 
appearance of the AWACS was connected to the UN decision on 
banning the use of Bosnian airspace. Thus Hungary took, and is 
taking part, in implementing this decision. This is why the 
downing of the aforementioned Galeb aircraft did not cause any 
problem. However, as far as I know, this UN decision did not 
affect the (civil) war being waged on the land and did not 
include sanctions in the case of an attack against Muslim 
enclaves declared as UN-protected areas, like Gorazde. In other 
words, this must have come up in the Hungarian Government, and 
Boross also expressed it, namely that the surveillance activity 
authorized by him only referred to a single UN decision, and it 
cannot be used for other purposes, without special permission. 
  Could this have been made clear at the time? In principle, 
yes. But not in practice. Once they are airborne, the 
reconnaissance aircraft observe what they have been ordered to 
do: Everything. They report what they see. Budapest cannot 
order them to carry out a "selective view," namely to ensure the 
airspace boycott but refrain from directing the attacking 
planes. Therefore, if there was such a thing at all, the 
dilemma is real.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lajos Berenyi, deputy state secretary at the </F>
Ministry of International Economic Relations, by Agnes G. Barta; 
place and date not given: "Council for Mutual Economic 
Assistance Foreign Trade -- Conditions Becoming Settled"] 
  [Text] Our trade relations are developing well with the 
former CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] countries, 
in spite of the extremely difficult economic conditions that can 
be found in certain places, according to Lajos Berenyi, deputy 
state secretary at the Ministry of International Economic 
Relations [NGKM]. 
  [Barta] In the past four years, the NGKM has often been 
criticized for our trade not being sufficient with the countries 
of our region. 
  [Berenyi] This opinion can be strongly disputed in view of 
the facts. With the region's countries, we switched over to 
applying the conditions normally used in world trade in our 
economic relations on 1 January 1991. The introduction of free 
currency accounting meant that the economic performance of the 
region's countries was measured by world market requirements. 
It was obvious to everyone that a whole range of products would 
not live up to these requirements and, as a result, the 
artificially inflated bilateral trade of the CEMA period quickly 
began to decline. This decline was made worse by the increasing 
economic crises among our partners, especially in the Soviet 
Union of the time. The Hungarian Government's efforts were 
aimed at stopping the decline in trade and establishing new 
types of economic relations that have a future and are in 
accordance with modern times. 
  According to the statistics, the decline in trade with 
Russia 
was relatively small, only 40 percent, while this reached or 
even exceeded 60 percent with the other CEMA countries. As 
early as 1990, the Hungarian Government and members of the 
business community made a conscious effort also to prepare 
enterprises for the changes. We signed agreements with almost 
all the Soviet republics on promoting economic and trade 
relations. In the meantime, naturally, the enterprises also 
took up contact with their partners, and so we managed to reduce 
the shock effects that resulted from the decline. A year later, 
in 1992, we managed to achieve increasing foreign trade turnover 
with the successor states of the Soviet Union. 
  [Barta] In spite of this, many Hungarian enterprises that 
had mainly produced for the Soviet market and were unable to 
change in time, went bankrupt. However, this is the past. What 
is the situation now? 
  [Berenyi] I think that we have reason for some optimism 
because Russia now is Hungary's second largest trade partner 
after Germany. In 1993, trade with Russia amounted to $3.4 
billion. Raw materials and energy resources are still the 
leading products. Even now, almost all our crude oil and 
natural gas needs are satisfied from here. In terms of 
Hungarian exports, Russia is a huge market. Hungarian 
enterprises continue to be present, although they are aware that 
the solvency of Russian enterprises is unsure and this situation 
cannot be expected to change in the near future, so it is 
essential to specify adequate payment assurances. Although our 
exports have decreased as a whole, the export of machines and 
processed agricultural and food industry products have started 
to increase dynamically. It is clear that demand for Hungarian 
products is much greater than the effective demand. It also has 
to be mentioned that, from a distance, the Russian laws appear 
to be rather confusing, but they are much clearer for those who 
are already present on the market, and they offer several 
possibilities. Recognizing this, Hungarian entrepreneurs are 
establishing an ever increasing number of joint ventures in 
manufacturing and trade. Hungarian enterprises are maintaining 
representations and our trade representation has set up 
sub-offices in Bashkiria, Tatarstan, and in the territories 
beyond the Urals. In spite of all our efforts, it would be vain 
to believe that it is possible to achieve anything more than a 
modest 5 to 10 percent export increase in the coming years. 
  [Barta] What is the situation with the other member states 
and the republic? 
  [Berenyi] Partly because of the common border, Ukraine is 
very important to us. In 1992 and 1993, our foreign trade 
turnover amounted to $300-350 million. Relations with 
Subcarpathia are improving and an increasing number of Hungarian 
enterprises are present in Kiev, where we have trade 
representation. Ukraine is also important for us because of the 
natural gas and crude oil pipelines. Out of the other 
republics, I have to mention Kazakhstan because of our project 
in Tengiz and their purchase of our agricultural systems. 
Uzbekistan is similarly important; we delivered goods to the 
value of $40 million in 1993. Turkmenistan is rich in natural 
resources. Our economic links with Belarus and Moldova expanded 
promisingly in 1993, just as with the Baltic states. 
  [Barta] Trade with the Visegrad four has also declined, 
although the Central European Free Trade Agreement [CEFTA] may 
significantly boost relations. 
  [Berenyi] Our annual foreign trade amounts to nearly $1 
billion with Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. One can 
say that this is a nice figure but it can also be increased. 
This is one of the reasons we signed CEFTA in 1992, which came 
into force in March 1993 and the legislatures of all states 
expect Poland have ratified it. 
  Because of the shortness of time, it would be difficult to 
prove the effects of the agreement in the second half of 1993 
with statistical data; however, it is a fact that almost half of 
the trade of industrial products became duty free, and this is a 
significant advantage, even compared with the most favored 
status treatment. We are continuously modernizing the CEFTA 
agreement to reduce the tariffs further. We will completely 
remove duty on industrial products by 2000, and we are also 
planning considerable changes in the case of agricultural 
products. We will probably sign the the supplementary agreement 
in Budapest in the second half of 1994. With Slovakia, 
bilateral links on the level of enterprises are very lively, and 
this is a good opportunity for small and medium-sized 
enterprises, whose activities the NGKM supports in every way. 
The Czech Republic is also a traditional market for us, as our 
trade with them is somewhat bigger than with Slovakia, and in 
our daily work, it is our experience that, on both the 
entrepreneurial and the governmental levels, they are interested 
in further developing bilateral links. After the prior decline, 
our trade with Poland increased by 14 to 15 percent in 1993. We 
have to recognize that these countries have keen competition in 
agricultural products and consumer goods because, like us, they 
have made association agreements with the European Union and the 
European Free Trade Association. Therefore, the Hungarian 
exporters have serious competitors on these markets. 
  During the transformation, it was also a major task to 
establish relations with the Yugoslav successor republics. We 
have now done this. Hungarian exports to Slovenia approached 
$150 million in 1993 and we reached a significant trade surplus. 
In addition to this, we have drawn up a free trade agreement 
similar to the CEFTA agreement. We also have good relations with 
Croatia although our trade has decreased a little. In addition 
to foreign trade, these countries are also important for us 
because of tourism and transit routes. Serbia is a painful loss 
to our foreign trade; we have had to accept a $1.3 billion loss 
because of the embargo. Relations with Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] are promising, the 
value of Hungarian exports is from $20 million to $30 million 
per year. The Yugoslav embargo is also making an impact on our 
trade in the Balkans: Our trade with Bulgaria and Albania have 
continued to decrease. Nevertheless, we do not want to give up 
the market opportunities in these two countries. We can assess 
our economic links with Romania positively, with the value of 
Hungarian exports at $200 million in 1993. We have a trade 
surplus. The number of Hungarian enterprises registered in 
Romania exceeds 1,000. 
  [Barta] Owing to the change to dollar accounting, there are 
huge amounts owed to us by the former CEMA countries. Have 
these been settled in the past four years? 
  [Berenyi] Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia have 
settled most of their former debts. The same can also be said 
of Romania. Bulgaria has not yet started to repay its debts. 
Russia, which has taken on the debts of the former Soviet 
Union, repaid half of its $1.7 billion debt in 1993 through 
military industrial deliveries. Talks are under way on the 
second installment. The remaining amount will be repaid between 
1994 and 1996 at 3.5-percent interest. They will partly pay 
with goods but we are also discussing the possibility to use 
some of this amount for Russian privatization or in establishing 
joint ventures.

  [Excerpts] During today's session of the Romanian Senate, 
Senator Ioan Alexandru of the PNTCD [National Peasant 
Christian-Democratic Party] read out a declaration regarding the 
recent vote in the Chisinau parliament that endorsed the 
Republic of Moldova's joining the CIS and regarding, quote, the 
ambiguous reaction of the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
to that adherence, unquote. 
  The declaration states that the vote of the Chisinau 
parliament reconfirms the criminal pact by which Bessarabia was 
torn away from Romania in 1941 and it annuls the indefeasible 
right of the Romanian nation to a part of its territory. 
Alexandru presented the declaration as one issued by the 
Romanian Parliament, but the chairman of today's session, Senate 
Deputy Speaker Valer Suian, stated that to be properly endorsed 
by the law-making body the declaration ought to be debated and 
passed by the two chambers. As a result of this, Senator Ioan 
Alexandru's declaration was considered a personal one that 
merely represents a possible suggestion made to the Romanian 
Parliament. [passage omitted] 
  During today's plenary session of the Chamber of Deputies 
the 
representatives also discussed issues that were not included in 
today's agenda, the principal one being the situation in Moldova 
after the Chisinau parliament's vote in favor of joining the 
CIS. In that context PNTCD Deputy Petre Dugulescu suggested that 
the Chamber of Deputies adopt a declaration by which the 
Romanian Parliament would declare in front of the whole world 
that the Romanian nation's right to a part of its territory is 
an indefeasible and inalienable one, and that no act 
contradicting that right can be valid as an international 
regulation. 
  The declaration is to be adopted if it is approved of by the 
Foreign Policy Commission. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Tana Ardeleanu and Elena Tumulescu: "Moldovan </F>
Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli Attacks -- Romania Has Not Given 
Us Even a Pencil for Free"] 
  [Text] Moldova's Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli made a 
shocking declaration on Radio Chisinau that is meant to put an 
end to the misunderstandings regarding the possible association 
of Moldova with Romania. Mr. Sangheli stated: "No matter how 
strange it would seem to you, we are fed up with the misery and 
intrigues published by the press, which keep telling us that 
Romania has allegedly granted us disinterested aid. In the past 
two years, Romania has not given us even a pencil for free. I 
would like to tell you that, in fact, Romania did not respect 
its commitments and is not a correct economic partner for 
Moldova. As far as political aspects are concerned, I do not 
even want to talk about them." The declaration was made in the 
Russian language, shortly after Andrei Sangheli chaired a 
government meeting devoted to the issue of relations with the 
CIS. The government spokesman, Ion Rosca, refused to comment on 
the Moldovan prime minister's statements. 
  [Romanian Presidency Spokesman] Traian Chebeleu rejected 
Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli's declarations and noted that 
"the affirmations do not correspond with reality and I hope 
that, through the Romanian Embassy in Chisinau, we will receive 
the necessary clarifications on the viewpoints expressed."

<F P=106> [Dinu C. Giurescu commentary: "Romanian-Russian Military </F>
Accord"] 
  [Text] On 28 March the Russian minister of national 
defense, Army General Pavel Grachev, arrived in Romania. During 
his visit he signed a military accord between the two countries. 
The accord includes several domains of cooperation: technical 
cooperation, the training of expert cadres, operational 
cooperation, cooperation in the medical and military history 
domains, and so on. 
  Romanian officials noted that the recently signed document 
is 
similar to the ones concluded by Romania with other states. 
  At his 30 March news conference Army General Pavel Grachev 
made a number of statements that should be noted: 
  a) "Russia," he said, "recognizes the sovereign right of 
every state to choose its own way, but it reserves the right to 
influence in a civilized way those evolutions that concern its 
own security." 
  Romanian public opinion can remember very well that in the 
name of its own security the Soviet Government imposed communist 
regimes in all central-eastern and southeastern European 
countries. Those regimes were born in 1944-1945 and ended in 
1989. 
  Also perfectly well known are the armed involvement in 
November 1956 in Hungary and in August 1968 in Czechoslovakia, 
and currently the 14th Army's presence and action on the 
territory of the Republic of Moldova, merely 100 km from its 
border with Romania. 
  The concept of "influencing in a civilized way those 
evolutions that concern its own security" can lead any time to 
most comprehensive and direct involvements in the affairs of the 
neighboring countries. 
  b) At the same news conference Army General Pavel Grachev 
also stated: "Throughout its history Russia has never attacked 
anyone, never conquered anyone, but rather merely defended 
itself, as it was always the attacked party." 
  That assertion baffles all people having some knowledge of 
history. It makes Romanian citizens and those of the 
neighboring countries even more fearful and suspicious, as they 
recall their not-so-long-ago history. 
  However, the importance of the visit of Minister Pavel 
Grachev lies in the fact that it highlighted one of Romania's 
essential issues: its relations with Russia. 
  To have good and stable relations with Russia is a sine qua 
non condition. However, Romania's renewed dependence -- even if 
it is a "civilized" one -- upon that Eastern superpower cannot 
be accepted, nor repeated any more. Be it "civilized" or not, 
dependence still means submission. 
  The Romanian delegation conducting the talks with Army 
General Pavel Grachev reminded him, and did so rightly, that 
Romania opposes all theories intended to divide Europe into 
spheres of influence. 
  However, that is not the end of the story. 
  In Romania there are groups that politically incline toward 
the East. They directly manifested themselves when the 
friendship and cooperation treaty with the USSR was elaborated 
and initialed in April 1991. 
  Those groups are also supported [by parties]. The left-wing 
and the nationalist-communist parties attract, according to 
recent IRSOP [Romanian Institute for Public Opinion] polling and 
IMAS [Applied Media Research Institute] polls, about 20-21 
percent of the electorate. 
  The domestic groups pursuing Romania's alignment to the East 
are acting within the somewhat confused situation in which the 
central-eastern and southeastern European countries find 
themselves with respect to their political and military security.

<F P=106> [Article by Oana Stanciulescu: "Russia Will Continue To </F>
Deliver Arms to Romania"] 
  [Text] On the occasion of the visit that Russian General 
Pavel Grachev paid to Bucharest, Romania and Russia agreed to 
continue with the delivery of spare parts for the three types of 
military technology in which we are still dependent on the 
ex-Soviet industry, namely radar, air-to-air missiles, and air 
force, government sources informed us. However, Russia was not 
successful in its efforts to sell us artillery technology and 
armored vehicles. As far as armored vehicles are concerned, 
General Grachev was taken to witness a military drill of an 
armored unit to shatter any illusions he nurtured in this area. 
  Nevertheless, Romania shows interest in purchasing air force 
equipment. Romania is counting on the McConnel Amendment to the 
draft federal budget of the United States for 1995, which 
represents the legal basis for loans and military assistance 
promised to our country by the United States when Romania joined 
the Partnership for Peace.

<F P=106> [Interview with Petre Roman, president of the Democratic </F>
Party (National Salvation Front), by Roxana Badralexi; place and 
date not given: "Can We Ignore the Danger to or Posed by the 
President and his People?"] 
  [Text] [Badralexi] Mr. Roman, do you know President Ion 
Iliescu well? 
  [Roman] I thought I knew him well, but I received a 
surprise. Of course, the surprise was only as far as I was 
concerned. I thought we had the same political beliefs and the 
same human features. But I had to ascertain that my trust in 
him was not justified. 
  [Badralexi] Do you think it possible that he once uttered 
the words: "I cannot leave the political scene now, because the 
others will put me in jail"? 
  [Roman] Anyone might say words like that at a time of 
political discord. Maybe some people feared such a thing at a 
certain point in time when the vindictive feature was very 
strong in Romanian society. Now, I consider such a statement to 
be pointless, if we think of the things that are known... 
  [Badralexi] What if there are some other things? 
  [Roman] In that case, everyone is also responsible for what 
is not known, if he is guilty of anything. Everyone is also 
responsible for what is not known at a given point. 
  [Badralexi] To conclude this topic, would you say that the 
danger resides in the fact that President Iliescu does not 
sincerely believe in giving land to the peasants and that he 
considers that the only purpose of factories is to ensure food 
for the workers? 
  [Roman] From a political viewpoint, this is definitely a 
danger. I would like to be more concrete and recall the million 
jobs promise he has made during the electoral campaign, 
something that was obviously impossible to achieve. Therefore, 
there is a danger here, because the peasants' work has always 
been the main source of economic growth in Romania. Second, the 
Romanian factories can only survive if they adjust to the 
generally recognized principles of management. They have 
markets, technology, and everything else they need so that, 
briefly put, they can obtain 1,001 lei-worth of production for 
1,000 lei-worth of costs. This was not the case in Ceausescu's 
[former communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu] time, when many 
industries were operating at a loss despite the fact that the 
raw materials were cheaper than in other countries. To continue 
this state of affairs today, through such a political attitude, 
is a dangerous thing. 
<H5>  If the President Is Not Able To Adjust to Reality, the </H5>
Citizens Will Draw Appropriate Conclusions 
  [Badralexi] Can anything be done to convince the president 
that his approach is dangerous? 
  [Roman] The influence of such an approach is obviously 
nefarious. However, since he keeps coming in contact with the 
economic reality of the developed world, I believe that the 
president will realize that this is the only way for us, too. 
Moreover, I subscribe to the idea of maintaining the social 
structure -- this is a dominant feature of our party -- only 
that this effort becomes meaningless, if it does not rely on a 
solid economic reality. This is all. This is the simple 
difference between demagoguery and pragmatism. 
  [Badralexi] Do you believe that we can simply ignore the 
danger to or posed by President Iliescu? 
  [Roman] One can never ignore what a president says, 
particularly in a semi-parliamentary republic like ours. 
However, the reality obliges the president to realize what the 
situation is really like and if he is not able to adjust to that 
reality, the citizens will draw appropriate conclusion. 
  [Badralexi] Let us hope so. Mr. Roman, many share your fear 
that Romania might lose the race with the other Eastern European 
countries. Do you think that the current holders of the power 
do not share these fears? 
  [Roman] I am afraid they do not. The majority of those 
currently occupying important positions in the administration 
are people used to the methods and mentalities of the 
centralized regime. Somewhere, at the back of their minds, they 
do not believe in the need for Romania to reach the standards of 
the civilized world. 
<H5>  It Would Be a Crime for Romania To Now Miss Its Greatest </H5>
Chance 
  [Badralexi] Are we talking here about irresponsibility, 
ignorance, or stupidity? 
  [Roman] We are faced here with an entire mental system that 
shaped the people who grew within that system. Consequently, 
they are unable to think differently. I noted this in many 
ruling acts and recovery plans of the current government. I am 
really concerned about this aspect. Romania has missed a lot of 
chances in its history, and it would be a crime to also miss a 
chance now that is probably greater than ever before. 
  [Badralexi] Why is it greater than ever before? 
  [Roman] For an external and internal reason. In the modern 
world, the desire to see as many nations as possible entering 
the democratic space is very big. I am firmly convinced of 
that. On the other hand, from an internal viewpoint, the great 
majority of the people are capable of getting hold of 
information in various ways. They have access to information. 
To all this one should add the everlasting desire of the 
Romanians to see their country make as much progress as possible. 
  [Badralexi] In your opinion, what are Romania's chances that 
the great powers will not sacrifice it again to the omnipresent 
Russians? 
  [Roman] I do not believe in this desire to sacrifice 
Romania. I am qualified to state this, in the wake of my 
contacts with responsible representatives of the great powers. 
I repeat, today there is a desire to see Romania in the 
front-ranking group. 
  [Badralexi] I hope to God you are right... 
  [Roman] God will see to it, while we will actually do it. 
  [Badralexi] May this come true. Is this desire shared by 
other quarters, too, outside Western Europe? 
  [Roman] It is also shared by the United States. I have 
enough proof of that. But let us go back to our being 
sacrificed to Russia's omnipresence and omnipotence -- so as to 
return to your question. In this respect, everything depends on 
our choice. Until now, our choice has categorically been in 
favor of NATO integration, with the exception of the extremist 
hysteria, which, however, is not decisive. Well, this 
commitment should remain categorical and should be implemented. 
Then, we will be able to eliminate the Russian insistence on 
maintaining a certain sphere of influence. Let us remember that 
Romania has already managed to do that in the period between the 
two world wars. 
<H5>  We Are Not Calling Upon the People To Make New Sacrifices </H5>
  [Badralexi] Would an eventual victory of the opposition in 
the case of early elections further the cause of Romania's 
integration into NATO? 
  [Roman] This is a very good question. Regarding our 
progress toward the Western structures, the answer is definitely 
yes. The opinion-shaping leaders of the majority would no 
longer be people who are definitely indebted to, if not even the 
slaves of, the Ceausescu mentality. However, there is still the 
problem of overcoming the economic blockage. In this respect, 
it is not sure that an opposition majority would be able to do 
much about it. The reason for that is that we need a solid 
consensus in these times of transition. However, I believe that 
such a majority should be endorsed by a broader political 
spectrum, since contestations are extremely damaging to the 
implementation of reform. It is obvious that we must take 
unpopular steps in the short run; but if voices come up 
promising to ease the people's lot, then everything is going to 
be spoiled... However, reform does not require new sacrifices. 
We are not calling upon the people to make new sacrifices, but 
to work. However, if the people are to do that, they must first 
realize that there is no alternative to it. 
  [Badralexi] Therefore, in case the current opposition 
emerges victorious in the elections, will it engage into 
negotiations with the future opposition? 
  [Roman] Yes, I believe it will be necessary to engage in a 
very serious dialogue with it. 
  [Badralexi] What makes you think that that dialogue would be 
more successful than the recent negotiations? The dialogue 
partners will be practically the same... 
  [Roman] This does not matter, since the other side will no 
longer negotiate from its current position. At this moment, 
they are putting their own interests above the country's 
interests. 
  [Badralexi] Do you think that they will keep believing that 
their power is everlasting? 
  [Roman] This is quite possible, if we think of the 
mentalities I referred to before. This is how they used to 
think and this is how they are going to think in the future, 
too. Not all of them, of course, but anyhow, those who are now 
represented in the government. 
  [Badralexi] Nevertheless, do you believe that a man like Mr. 
Adrian Nastase [Party of Social Democracy, PDSR, executive 
president] can be so naive? 
  [Roman] No. I suspect that Adrian Nastase -- a man who has 
been around the world -- does not believe in that, but I see 
that he is playing that game. Therefore, he probably has no 
independence in the matter. 
  [Badralexi] Does Mr. Gherman [Oliviu Gherman, PDSR 
president] have such independence? 
  [Roman] I do not think he has it either. However, Mr. 
Gherman is a man without strong personal ambitions. 
Consequently, he is sometimes able to give a better and more 
positive nuance to his stands. 
  [Badralexi] Could Mr. Gherman's attitude have a positive 
role within the PDSR? 
  [Roman] I hope so. 
<H5>  17 June 1990 Was a Great Trial for Me... </H5>
  [Badralexi] If the Democratic Convention [CDR] wins the next 
elections, would you want or be able to participate in a 
government? 
  [Roman] I do not think we would really want to do that. 
However, we would like to reach an agreement with the CDR on the 
package of necessary measures, after which we can give them our 
endorsement. 
  [Badralexi] Would such an alliance be viable? 
  [Roman] Yes. 
  [Badralexi] Mr. Roman, do you not regret now that you agreed 
to become prime minister at the beginning? 
  [Roman] When, on 26 December [1989] or 28 June [1990]? 
  [Badralexi] On 28 June. 
  [Roman] If I think about it, I do not regret it, since what 
was done at the time -- to the extent of eliminating certain old 
structures or filling up certain gaps in the process of the 
country's modernization -- is a positive thing. 
  [Badralexi] This may be so, but I was addressing myself to 
the politician Petre Roman of today. 
  [Roman] On 17 June I was thinking of resigning. That was my 
great trial. If I were to think about it as a politician, 
therefore with a certain degree of egotism, the answer is yes. 
After all, such a gesture would have probably solved a lot for 
the following year. I am not the man to think egoistically...

  [Text] The negotiations between a Croatian delegation and 
representatives of the Serb authorities from the UN-protected 
areas, scheduled to resume tomorrow, will not materialize. 
  Nobody wants to make any guesses about the reasons behind 
the 
postponement of the negotiations or about a possible new date 
when they could take place. Slavko Degoricija, member of the 
Croatian delegation, said that the Croatian delegation is ready 
for the next round of talks and stressed that the resumption of 
the talks depends on the decision of the Serb representatives. 
Economic and social issues were to be discussed in this round 
of the negotiations.

  [Text] Obrenovac, 12 Apr (TANJUG) -- Slobodan Jarcevic, 
minister for foreign affairs of the republic of Serb Krajina 
[RSK], today cited three reasons why Zagreb is not acceptable as 
a site for further negotiations between the RSK and Croatia. 
  In a statement to Obrenovac Radio, he said that the first 
reason is the fact that the Russian Embassy in Zagreb is too 
crammed, given that a delegation that would discuss 
possibilities of restoring economic relations should be 
relatively numerous since the subject of negotiations requires 
broader and more frequent meetings. 
  The second reason is that there is a great deal of pressure 
from the Croatian media whose headlines are full of words such 
as "criminals from Knin," something that clearly characterizes 
the atmosphere and ambience surrounding the negotiations. 
  Jarcevic also mentioned that representatives of the Russian 
Federation, some in Zagreb and some in Moscow, are openly 
advocating the recognition of Croatia within its AVNOJ [prewar] 
borders and stated that this is what Russian diplomacy will 
stick to. 
  He said that the Krajina side has pointed out that this is a 
kind of pressure and demanded that representatives of Russia and 
the United States should refrain from such statements for at 
least as long as the negotiations are taking place. 
  ``Because of all this we categorically demand that the 
negotiations should resume on neutral ground, in a Russian 
Embassy in a neighboring countries. This is what we told 
Vitaliy Churkin, deputy minister for foreign affairs, and Kai 
Eide, deputy cochairman of the peace conference, who have 
nevertheless insisted on continuing the negotiations in Zagreb. 
  Asked to what extent the continuation of negotiations would 
depend on what has been going on around Gorazde, Jarcevic said 
that this could decisively influence further negotiations. 
  ``For, it is evident that the United Nations has taken the 
side of one party, something we were aware of even when NATO 
weaponry was far from our borders,'' he said. 
  "However, we do not rule out negotiations and the mediation 
of Russia and the United States, although they cannot expect any 
concession from our side unless the Croatian side agrees to this 
too," Jarcevic said in conclusion.

  [Text] A meeting between a delegation of the Republic of 
Croatia and a delegation of the Serbs living in the UN-protected 
areas should have been held in Zagreb today. The meeting had 
been agreed upon in principle back on 29 March when the 
cease-fire agreement was signed. The new meeting should have 
been devoted to the normalization of the situation in the sphere 
of economy. 
  Despite an intervention by the mediators of the Zagreb 
negotiations, the Serb delegation did not come to the meeting 
today, probably because of the confusing situation prevailing in 
those areas, particularly now that they are constituting their 
new leadership. This was stated by Hrvoje Sarinic, head of the 
Croatian delegation to negotiations with the local Serbs. He 
added: I would like to recall that the cease-fire agreement is 
only a part of a project of normalization of overall relations 
throughout the Republic of Croatia, not a sort of a settlement 
between the Republic of Croatia and the UN-protected areas. 
Further negotiations will refer to economic issues and the 
final political solution within the internationally recognized 
borders of the Republic of Croatia. It is under these 
conditions and with the guarantees by the United States, Russia, 
the European Union, and the United Nations that we agreed to 
hold Zagreb negotiations and sign the agreement itself. 
  The Republic of Croatia is, as it has always been, 
interested 
in the resumption of negotiations leading to the complete 
normalization of relations and we are expressing our readiness 
that these negotiations could continue anywhere on the territory 
of the Republic of Croatia.

  [Text] Knin, April 12 (TANJUG) -- The republic of Serb 
Krajina (RSK) and Croatia are successfully cooperating on the 
implementation of the agreement on ceasefire and troops 
disengagement, the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
representatives said on Tuesday. 
  The delegations of RSK and the former Yugoslav republic of 
Croatia signed the agreement to end hostilities and disengage 
troops in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb on March 30. The 
agreement has been effective since April 4. 
  UNPROFOR representatives in Sector South, Alan Roberts and 
Lieutenant Colonel Paule Sautvel, told a news conference that 
heavy weapons had been completely withdrawn, that the withdrawal 
of troops from the lines of confrontation is soon to be 
completed, and that the problems of the four outstanding 
locations will be solved by joint committees. 
  The deployment of U.N. peace-keepers along the line of 
confrontation is still in progress and Roberts and Sautvel said 
and their taking over is further delayed by the slow mine 
clearance operations [sentence as received]. 
  The conflict between RSK and Croatia broke out in 1991 
following Croatia's forcible secession from former Yugoslav 
federation and an attempt to reduce the status of the Serb 
people to that of an ethnic minority. RSK was proclaimed by 
Serbs in their ethnic and historical territories within the 
arbitrary communist-era borders of Croatia. 
  RSK has been U.N. protected area (UNPA) since March 1992, 
and 
UNPROFOR mandate was extended for another six months in March.

  [Text] President Tudjman has sent a letter to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic 
regarding a hunger strike by Muslim prisoners in Mostar's 
prison. The following is the letter in its entirety: 
  It was with a great deal of surprise that I received the 
news 
that 225 Bosniak-Muslim prisoners were on a hunger strike in 
Mostar's Heliodrom prison because of a delay in the agreement 
between the Bosniak-Muslim and the Croat side on their release 
and the simultaneous release of imprisoned Croats and members of 
the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] from prisons in Zenica and 
Travnik. 
  As far as the latter are concerned, your authorities have 
not 
given permission for them to be released because they have been 
put on trial for participating in the enemy army--namely, the 
HVO--and for not heeding their call-up notices. I maintain that 
such actions on the part of both sides are at odds with the 
Washington agreement. It is explicitly at odds with Article 3 of 
the joint statement signed in Geneva on 10 February 1994 by 
Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of the Government of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mate Granic, vice president of 
the government and minister for foreign affairs of the Republic 
of Croatia, and General Ante Roso in his capacity as a 
cosignatory. 
  This is why I have instructed Mate Granic, vice president of 
the government and minister for foreign affairs, to discuss this 
issue with Silajdzic immediately as a matter of urgency. I 
hereby ask you to do your best so that the prisoners from both 
sides can be simultaneously released prior to my visit to the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This should be done regardless 
of whether there are persons under investigation among the 
prisoners or whether they have already been sentenced, in which 
case we suggest they be pardoned or granted amnesty. Meanwhile, 
both sides should take on an obligation to carry out adequate 
procedures in line with jointly adopted legislation and 
international conventions, once peace has been restored and the 
new federal order established. 
  Mr. President, I appeal to you so we can together do 
everything that is needed in order to resolve as soon as 
possible this situation, which can only damage our efforts to 
implement the Washington agreement. Let this be a concrete 
contribution to the restoration of mutual trust in every area of 
our coexistence. Please receive my personal regards.

<F P=106> [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the </F>
Democratic Left, by Anna Vargova; place and date not given: "One 
Must Prepare Oneself for Entry Into the European Union"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] While in Vienna, you surely 
also discussed our interest and endeavor to become a member of 
the European Union [EU]. How do the Austrian partners perceive 
our chances? 
  [Weiss] The Slovak Republic naturally wants to become 
integrated into the EU. I believe that it is necessary to be 
well prepared for entry practically, legally, and economically. 
The Slovak Republic, too, could file a formal application for EU 
membership within a few days. That is not what matters, 
however. I am in favor of preparing a well-thought-out strategy 
of preparing Slovakia for this entry, which should be based on 
the Agreement on Association With the EU. 
  [Vargova] Have you discussed within the framework of the 
coalition the possibility of the present government filing such 
an application? 
  [Weiss] No, we have not discussed this issue. 
  [Vargova] At the news conference in Vienna, you said that 
you would like to become prime minister after the elections. 
Could you specify your reply? 
  [Weiss] I said that every party naturally wants to win 
elections and have the prime minister. 
  [Vargova] If the SDL should win the election, has a decision 
already been made in your party that you would be its candidate 
for this post? 
  [Weiss] No decision on this issue has yet been made by SDL 
bodies. In the case of our electoral victory, we would 
definitely nominate the prime minister.

<F P=106> ["Highlights" of government policy statement read by Prime </F>
Minister Jozef Moravcik to the National Council on 12 
April--recorded] 
  [Text] Esteemed Mr. President, esteemed Mr. Chairman of the 
National Council, esteemed Deputies, ladies and gentlemen: 
  In the history of the nation and in the history of the 
state, 
there are periods reminiscent of crossroads. I am convinced 
that, at this very moment, we find ourselves precisely at such a 
place. And it is precisely at this moment that it is important 
to speak the truth and give things their correct names. 
Otherwise, we might lose our direction at this crossroads. 
That is why it is important to think over what we are being 
told so that we do not succumb to passions that could lead us to 
disastrous conflicts. What we need is healthy judgment, so that 
we are not turned into a tool of demagoguery. 
  We must say this to ourselves to explain why it is we, this 
government, who are here, why we thought it necessary to change 
the government in the middle of an election term. It is not 
something extraordinary in the history of European 
parliamentarism. However, it is not something that happens very 
often. I believe very strongly that it needs to be explained 
before we start assessing this government's policy statement. 
  To start with, I would like to talk about something 
personal. 
When I think about public affairs, I often think about what 
happened in November 1989. At that time, I was with my students 
at the Comenius University in Bratislava. I can still feel 
their resolve to change the current state of affairs, their hope 
and faith in the future. I identified with their feelings. I 
promised myself then that I must not let them down. This moral 
obligation is for me the highest criterion in my political 
activity, as well. It is more important than belonging to a 
political party or to a movement. I am trying to say that there 
are and must be in politics values that are above political 
parties and that political parties must respect. Otherwise, our 
Constitution will yet again become a formal document. 
  These are values that an overwhelming majority of the Slovak 
population agreed on at the end of 1989. The stability and 
prosperity of advanced Europe is built on these values. We have 
identified these values as protection of a citizen's rights and 
freedoms, protection of his right to own property, and the 
democratic management of public affairs. There is no need to 
think of other methods. Other methods lead to stagnation. We 
are in the center of Europe. If we invent other rules and other 
principles of arranging the state and society, we will only harm 
ourselves. 
  I would like to discuss one problem whose explanation is 
very 
important for our future. It is the problem of the Movement for 
a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], which won in the election two 
years ago but was not able to maintain power. The question 
emerges: Is this only an internal tragedy of this movement, or 
is it a fact that can be generalized and from which lessons can 
be drawn for all? I am convinced that the demise of the HZDS is 
not only a question for this movement but also touches upon many 
aspects of the main issues of our young state and concerns the 
reason for the existence of this government. 
  Every political party is composed of people who give it its 
form, direction, and aims. It is from this point of view that 
the HZDS at the time of the election and the HZDS today are two 
different entities. The key personalities that formed it in the 
beginning either left the party or were expelled from it. It 
lost a significiant part of its electoral base. These 
pronounced changes could not but be reflected in the composition 
of our parliament. Eighteen deputies left the HZDS club, and 
others are considering this. The original club of the Slovak 
National Party [SNS] has also fallen apart, which is also 
connected with the development of the HZDS. 
  We often ask the justified question of why they did so. 
Some reply that it was treason, personal interest, changing 
sides for reward, as is the case with football clubs. All this 
is a fabrication. It is used, above all, by those who want to 
hide in this way their share of guilt. The reality is more 
unpleasant than that. 
  Let me point to my personal experience. In the last election 
campaign, together with Michal Kovac, Roman Kovac, Milan Knazko, 
Rudolf Filkus, and Lubomir Dolgos, I did not tell our voters, 
the voters of the then HZDS, that we were trying to win them 
over to be able to carry out the privatization for our benefit 
and for the benefit of our party followers, that, with their 
help, we wanted to build a state party. We promised them 
something completely different. We told them we wanted 
democracy, cooperative, nonconfrontational politics--that is, 
cooperation with the other political parties, better social 
security, a better sense of security, high-quality performance 
in office, and so on. 
  From the point of view and experience of today, we have, in 
fact, introduced them to these things because reality has 
developed differently for two years after the elections. 
  For instance, what explanation can Deputies Meciar, 
Keltosova, and Tothova offer to their electorate about the fact 
that, as Cabinet members, they voted in favor of a decision by 
which, within the framework of privatization, they have 
literally donated 1 billion korunas to private individuals--I am 
speaking about the transfer of shares of the VSZ [East Slovak 
Ironworks] to a private company. Is this what they promised the 
citizens? 
  There are more questions we can and must ask. Is it in 
harmony with the democratic principles of executive power to 
finance a party's newspaper with state money--that is, using 
money from taxes paid by all of the citizens? I am speaking 
about the REPUBLIKA daily. We would not find something like this 
in any democratic state. 
  Is it right to use taxpayers' money to organize a 
referendum, 
the aim of which is to be one party gaining seats they have lost 
in parliament? 
  Did those who voted for the HZDS expect the prime minister 
to 
strictly demand from his ministers that they appoint HZDS 
members to head personnel departments and control bodies at all 
ministries? 
  I am mentioning all this so as to ask a more fundamental 
question: Is the preservation of democracy guaranteed by a 
political party or by the deputies' conscience? No party can be 
or is the supreme authority. If we go along with the HZDS's 
proposal to subordinate a deputy's conscience to the party will, 
we will sow a seed in our parliament that might grow very fast 
into a one-party system. 
  We are quite often told by the HZDS that it is the only one 
capable of forming a functioning government, that its chairman 
is the only one capable of managing public affairs at this time. 
We must be very alert when hearing such voices and not 
underestimate them in any way. We have previous experience in 
the period when one party declared itself exceptional. Both 
Stalin and Brezhnev were, for instance, convinced that no one 
could replace them. 
  To achieve stability in our state, we need stable political 
parties that will secure the permanence and continuity of the 
democratic process. Much, therefore, depends on the future 
development of political parties in Slovakia. It is necessary 
to pay proper attention and take note in which parties and 
movements malice is spreading against certain groups of 
citizens, which parties and movement have built their profile on 
excessive worshipping of one person, from where confrontational 
attitudes and demagoguery are ensuing, being perceived as 
fundamental methods of the political struggle. It is not 
possible to cooperate with such political parties. They do 
exist, but they belong to the margins of the political spectrum. 
  It is exactly in this connection that I would like to stress 
the importance of the current government coalition. This 
coalition proves that effective cooperation between political 
entities of different political orientations is possible also in 
Slovakia. These parties have come to understand that they must 
place the state interest above their differences of opinion. 
  At this stage, the future of Slovakia is being decided for 
a long time ahead. It is therefore necessary to bring together 
Slovakia's whole creative potential right now. To achieve that, 
we will have to create favorable conditions, an atmosphere of 
peace, understanding, and willingness to cooperate. This means 
that we need the national and civic reconciliation for which the 
president of the Slovak Republic appealed in his speech to this 
parliament--which has been recalled in this parliament by a 
prominent Slovak personality, Cardinal Tomko--and the need for 
which is, as a memento of Svatopluk twigs [fable in which 
Moravian ruler Svatopluk told his sons to stay together because 
a group of twigs bundled together is stronger than the total of 
the individual strengths of each twig], ever present in our 
history. 
  This government coalition is offering such an atmosphere and 
the concentration of creative potential. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, another very important and repeatedly 
debated issue is the relation between the emergence of our 
independent state and the development of our statehood. I do 
not want to lead a discussion on who deserves credit and to what 
extent for the fact that Slovakia is an independent republic or 
to belittle or exaggerate the merits of individuals or political 
parties, even though legends always surround such historic 
events. In a way, these issues already belong to the domain of 
historians. 
  It is beyond doubt that Slovakia's independence is a great 
challenge for us, an opportunity to gauge our own ability and 
strength and to prove our viability. At the same time, it 
brings great responsibility toward this generation as well as 
future generations, whose life-styles we are predetermining 
today. Most of all, it is important what foundations we lay for 
statehood, what we leave to the coming generations. 
  The resposibility for this is equally shared by all who live 
and have decided to live in this country, regardless of how they 
have assessed the emergence of an independent state, whether 
they were in favor or against. This has to be understood 
especially by those who would like to differentiate between 
greater and lesser patriots, who claim that words published in 
one Slovak paper are more Slovak than those published in another 
Slovak paper. If we go on differentiating like this, we will 
lose our republic. Slovakia is our homeland. 
  It is home to Slovaks and members of many other ethnic 
groups 
who have been living in Slovakia for centuries. We have proved 
our maturity also by being able to create a peaceful atmosphere 
for the coexistence of citizens of different ethnic backgrounds. 
This is of great value, and we must not lose it by nurturing 
national intolerance, which is alien to our character. 
  Slovakia's borders have been determined by international 
documents. Anyone who questions the borders in order to whip up 
nationalist passions is harming Slovakia. Confirmation of the 
borders, including the borders with the Republic of Hungary, 
should be the basis for establishing mutual trust. We would 
thus make a major and important step on the path to historical 
reconciliation. 
  The principle of searching for enemies both at home and 
abroad cannot be used to consolidate Slovak statehood. This is 
a path leading to conflicts that need never occur and that 
impoverish us. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, the demise of the HZDS and the SNS as 
ruling parties, their inability to maintain policy unity, and 
their inability to cooperate with other political parties were 
the direct cause of the recent political crisis. These parties 
bear the political responsibility for the fact that there have 
to be early parliamentary elections. The HZDS, especially, or 
what remains of this movement was unable to cope with the 
responsibility with which it had been vested by those who cast 
their votes for it in the election. The movement has exercised 
power in a way that has put off some of its members and 
discredited the movement itself in the eyes of the majority of 
this state's citizens. Its activity resulted in doubt being 
cast on our credibility in international relations and led the 
country to economic collapse. 
  Under these circumstances, the only possible solution to the 
long-lasting political crisis in Slovakia was the setting up of 
a broad coalition government. However, after the collapse of 
the political power that emerged from the election, only a new 
election can bring a more permanent solution. The proposed 
policy statement presented by this government is an alternative 
that can secure such a solution for Slovakia. 
  With this statement, I am presenting to you the draft of the 
government policy statement for your consideration, and I am 
asking you to support it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bela Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian </F>
Christian Democratic Movement, Miklos Duray, chairman of the 
Coexistence Movement, and Laszlo Nagy, chairman of the Hungarian 
Civic Party, by Ondrej Dostal; place and date not given: 
"Positive First Steps"] 
  [Text] The Hungarian parties are sometimes referred to as 
holding the balance of power because the present government 
coalition depends on their votes in parliament. We spoke with 
the chairmen of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement 
[MKDH], the Coexistence Movement, and the Hungarian Civic Party 
[MOS] about the new government and the present state and future 
of Slovak-Hungarian relations. 
  [Dostal] Could you compare the previous and present Slovak 
Governments? 
  [Bugar] For a year and a half, we were searching for 
consensus and possible dialogue with Meciar's government. No 
dialogue took place and a tone of confrontation prevailed. Now 
we can participate in coalition talks, and one takes an interest 
in our views. In May 1993, we had a meeting with the Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. One of the results was the 
agreement that laws concerning minorities would be deliberated 
with us before they get into the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic [NRSR]. Unfortunately, this did not happen. We have 
now received the promise that not only laws concerning 
minorities but also all laws will be discussed at meetings of 
the Coalition Council, and it seems that this promise is being 
kept. I believe that it is necessary to show the Slovak public 
that it is possible to govern by other than confrontational 
means, as was typical of Meciar's government. The endeavor on 
the part of the new government is a sincere one. 
  [Duray] The present government differs in a very fundamental 
way from its predecessor. First and foremost, it is not 
confrontational and overpoliticized and is more accommodating 
toward various components of society and more acceptable to 
foreign partners. 
  [Nagy] In one respect, the new government differs from its 
predecessor in a fundamental way: It sends out very clear and 
unambiguous signals about its political orientation. So far, it 
has not left the domestic and foreign public in any doubt that 
it is oriented toward the Western type of democracy, the market 
mechanism, and the NATO security system, and that it wants to 
have normal relations with its neighbors, be it the Czech 
Republic, Hungary, or the other neighbors. 
  [Dostal] How will the activity of the new government make 
itself felt in Slovak-Hungarian relations, in your opinion? 
  [Bugar] My first experience as regards statements by members 
of the new government is very good. The government is looking 
for possibilities of coming to an agreement with the Hungarian 
side in some way. I think that the change of the 
confrontational tone can have a positive effect. A braking 
factor is that soon there will be elections in Hungary, and it 
is highly unlikely that some specific steps concerning, for 
example, bilateral agreements will be taken by then. It is 
possible to at least agree on certain principles concerning 
mutual cooperation. On both sides, one can feel the realization 
that the confrontational tone that existed between Hungarian and 
Slovak political representatives at the government level needs 
to be changed. 
  [Duray] The first statements by the prime minister and 
individual government members are incomparably friendlier toward 
Hungary and the Hungarians living in Slovakia than statements by 
the previous government. There have already been positive 
echoes to this from the Hungarian side. It is questionable 
whether this government will have the time to bring about some 
specific changes in relations between Hungary and Slovakia but, 
judging from the first statements, there exists the possibility 
of an atmosphere being created between the Governments of 
Hungary and Slovakia that will reinforce trust. 
  [Nagy] Positively. The first speech by the prime minister in 
parliament testifies to his accommodating steps. The government 
evidently realizes the importance and significance of 
Slovak-Hungarian relations and wants to take steps to meet the 
other side halfway. The response from the Hungarian side has 
been positive, according to my information. It would be good to 
seal the bilaterally accommodating attitude by a meeting at the 
highest level still in this period [prior to elections in 
Hungary and Slovakia]. This good atmosphere and the warming up 
in mutual relations have been contributed to also by the will of 
the new Slovak Government to tackle some problems of the 
Hungarian minority in Slovakia. 
  [Dostal] Will the new situation have any impact on the 
assertion of demands that were adopted at the assembly [of 
representatives of the Hungarian minority] in Komarno [on 8 
January]? 
  [Bugar] These demands are of a long-term nature. Everyone 
who knows what they contain realizes that this cannot be 
accomplished within six months and not even in one year. There 
exist various areas in which certain steps could be taken. But 
I would not insist that the Komarno documents be incorporated 
into the government's program, as it were. They do not even 
figure among the demands of the Hungarian parties because we, 
too, realize that this cannot be accomplished in six months. 
  [Duray] The shortness of this government's term of office 
does not make it possible to take any major steps, in my 
opinion. It will not be possible, for example, to pass a 
constitutional law on the status of minorities in Slovakia, but 
some partial steps can be taken. And these are already being 
taken. We assume, for example, that a law on birth registers 
and a law on the bilingual names of communities will be passed 
before the summer, that structural changes will be made at the 
Ministry of Education, and that the concept and the composition 
of the Government Council for Ethnic Minorities will be changed. 
It is clear already that the reorganization of the territorial 
and administrative division of Slovakia planned by Meciar's 
government is being halted. This was a general demand, however, 
which is to the satisfaction of all self-administrative bodies 
in Slovakia. 
  [Nagy] I believe that the government will fulfill the 
agreements that have been reached between the political parties 
represented in government and the Hungarian parliamentary 
parties. An agreement has been reached on Council of Europe 
recommendations as well as on some personnel issues. I do not 
think that the Komarno documents were used as a basis for the 
agreements between the government and the Hungarian parties. 
  [Dostal] Do you not expect an aggravation of 
Slovak-Hungarian relations in the course of the election 
campaign? 
  [Bugar] At the moment, I can only rely on the specific steps 
of this government. I assume that also other steps will help 
eliminate existing mistrust on both sides. It is very important 
for us that this government and the political parties that make 
it up be given a chance also after the elections. Both the 
government parties and the Hungarian parties are interested in 
searching for possible rapprochement, and the election campaign 
could be different from that of 1992, in that respect. In view 
of our experience with the HZDS and the Slovak National Party 
[SNS], it is to be expected that they will exploit the issue of 
ethnic minorities in their election campaign. They will be 
taking advantage of every step of this government, but also of 
our steps, in order to demonstrate who is "the savior of this 
nation" and who "protects the Slovak nation against Hungarians." 
  [Duray] They could come to a head. The question, first and 
foremost, is how long the new government will need parliamentary 
support. We expect the political tranquility we have in 
Slovakia right now to end with the start of the election 
campaign, at the latest. The aggravation of political 
atmosphere in the national sense will depend also on the other 
Slovak parties, particularly those that were represented in the 
previous government because it was mainly these parties that had 
introduced the tone of confrontation into Slovak politics. 
  [Nagy] I expect the HZDS and the SNS to intensify 
Slovak-Hungarian tension and to play the so-called Hungarian 
card, as they have done heretofore. They have no other option 
if they want to win a certain part of voters to their side. 
They will create a picture of the enemy with regard to 
Hungarians and the Czechs. I would be surprised if they did 
not. But I hope the population of the Slovak Republic will not 
swallow for the second time the bait of the empty promises of 
this movement, as it did in 1992.

    [Editorial Report] The Bratislava STV 1 Television Network 
in Slovak at 1905 GMT on 12 April, on its regular Tuesday "Press 
Club" program, carries a 55-minute discussion with Slovak Deputy 
Prime Minister Roman Kovac, Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner, 
and Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan. 
  The Cabinet members take turns in answering journalists' 
questions. Topics include crime, social welfare, unemployment, 
foreign relations, the Slovak Government's appeal to heads of 
district offices, and the progress of parliamentary debate on 
the government's policy statement. 
  On the subject of Slovakia's relations with Hungary, Foreign 
Minister Eduard Kukan is asked about an election campaign speech 
by Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross, in which Boross says 
he is the spiritual prime minister of 15 million Hungarians. A 
journalist asks Kukan: "What is your view of this stance, this 
statement, when considering the prospects of the development of 
our neighborly relations with Hungary?" 
  Kukan gives the following response: "This is one of the 
easier questions. Elections in Hungary are approaching, and, 
thus, all opportunities are being used to attract votes, and the 
issue you spoke about is naturally very topical, given the 
internal political situation in Hungary. 
  "We have said several times that we are interested in an 
uninterrupted dialogue with Hungary, in a calm and 
matter-of-fact dialogue, not an emotional one. I heard about 
the Hungarian prime minister's statement, and my understanding 
is that he really means some sort of a spiritual leadership of 
the Hungarians living abroad. As far as I know, in the same 
speech, he also said Hungary recognized the existing current 
borders. From our point of view, this is the decisive thing. 
  "Our view is that the issue of the borders' inviolability is 
the fundamental question as regards development of our normal, 
good-neighborly relationship with Hungary. All other questions 
will start from there. In our diplomatic relations, we have 
consistently returned to this issue, and we will insist on 
resolving it in a way satisfactory to Slovakia's interests. We 
believe we will succeed in resolving this issue in the future, 
on condition, naturally, that Hungary will meet us halfway 
because this is what Slovakia is doing--showing willingness to 
hold talks and not closing communication channels. 
  "If we succeed in resolving the issue of the inviolability 
of 
the borders in a way satisfactory to Slovakia's interests, I 
believe our relations with our Hungarian neighbor will have the 
space to develop in a normal way." 
  No further processing.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "National Property Fund Presidium in New </F>
Composition"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava--An extraordinary 28th meeting of 
the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] was convened 
yesterday, on the initiative of NRSR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic, 
to decide on the composition of new supreme bodies of the 
National Property Fund [FNM] of the Slovak Republic. [passage 
omitted] 
  The deputies decided by secret ballot that Rudolf Janac will 
be president of the FNM Presidium and Viliam Vaskovic vice 
president. A total of 92 ballots were distributed; the two votes 
were then held separately. Rudolf Janac, who had been proposed 
by the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], received 77 votes, 
and Viliam Vaskovic (proposed by the "Center" coalition) won the 
support of 76 deputies. 
  A third secret ballot determined that Zoltan Zimmermann 
(Christian Democratic Movement), Pavol Kinces (Center), Juraj 
Kamaras (Center), Karol Pittner (SDL), Frantisek Szomolay 
(Coexistence/Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement), and Igor 
Mathe (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) became members of the 
FNM Presidium. No other candidate won the needed more than 50 
percent of vote. The seventh member of the FNM Presidium will 
therefore be elected at the next meeting of parliament. 
  After the promulgation of the results of the secret ballot, 
NRSR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic declared the extraordinary meeting 
of parliament closed. The next, 29th, NRSR extraordinary 
meeting, which will open on 12 April, will be devoted to the 
Slovak Government's Policy Statement. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by "kn": "The Army of the Slovak Republic Will </F>
Survive, but...."] 
  [Text] Major General Andrej Sabol, state secretary at the 
Ministry of Defense of the Slovak Republic, stated yesterday 
that, in dividing the CSFR Army, we performed "the largest peace 
operation in Europe." Out of 7,000 professional soldiers of 
Slovak nationality, some 5,000 have stayed on the territory of 
the Czech Republic for various reasons. According to Sabol, the 
Army, too, suffers from a shortage of money, but "our arms 
systems will survive until approximately 2015." It is not true 
that the Army of the Slovak Republic is weaker than Hungary's. 
Slovakia abides by the international agreements on troop 
numbers and armaments, and its compliance with those agreements 
is being regularly monitored. Our involvement in the Partnership 
for Peace is not conditional on the compatibility of our arms 
systems. What must be common, however, is the method of 
communication. The prerequisite for this is command of the 
English language, which is still a problem for our Army.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Eva Cobejova: "What Is Hidden Behind One Post </F>
Office Box"] 
  [Text] The weekly ZMENA [Change] has presented to the 
Slovak youth an offer to become involved in the activity of the 
Slovak National Front (SNF). We do not learn from the quite 
extensive article who specifically stands behind this 
initiative. The address, a post office box in Trnava, does not 
reveal much. What does the front actually offer us? To build 
on the "traditions of healthy patriotism and Christian ethics." 
The aim is to "make the political and economic leadership of 
the state respect the interests of the nation and protect its 
freedom.... On no account do we intend to stand idly by and 
watch the cryptocommunists in parliament and in the Slovak 
Government sell our homeland to the political-criminal 
underworld and the international mafia." The SNF will be 
against foreigners being given jobs in Slovakia and foreign-made 
goods penetrating our market. The SNF calls for a "morally pure 
government, supported by a potent Army, the police, and 
voluntary units of armed citizens in the style of the National 
Guard." Hidden behind the anonymous post office box in Trnava 
are thus new armed units that want to defend this nation, 
whether we want it or not. Does this not remind you by chance of 
some organizations from Slovak history, about which a judge of 
the Slovak Supreme Court recently said that these were "good 
organizations, which were only misused by politicians"? Who 
will misuse the SNF?

President Slobodan Milosevic received Yasushi Akashi, head of 
the UN mission in former Yugoslavia, and colleagues. 
  During the talks, which covered the latest developments in 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Milosevic said that by 
bombing Serb positions, the United Nations has abandoned the 
principles of impartiality vis-a-vis the warring sides in the 
civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and openly sided with the 
Muslims. This has seriously brought into question the trust 
required for the realization of its role as mediator in the 
negotiating process in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Serbian president pointed to the fact that the offensive 
by the Muslim forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been going on for 
a long time now, and that Gorazde's position as a so-called safe 
zone, in full view of UN representatives, has been abused by the 
Muslim forces, allowing them to concentrate on their offensive 
against the Serbs. 
  The United Nations has neither prevented, nor hindered these 
attempts but, on the contrary, has supported them in terms of 
direct military involvement, something the Serb nation and the 
Serb Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina condemns energetically. In 
the view of President Milosevic, this behavior is not in the 
interest of peace but prolongs the war and intensifies 
instability in this region. 
  In President Milosevic's opinion, the only real way out of 
the current situation is to achieve a general agreement on the 
cessation of all hostilities. 
  A peace agreement should be reached as soon as possible 
without prejudging the political solution, President Milosevic 
stressed, pointing out his belief that the Serb side will accept 
new negotiations without preconditions after a cessation of all 
hostilities is in place. However, this can be done only on an 
equal footing. This means that the sanctions should be lifted. 
If the international community sincerely wants peace then it 
should respect the principle of equality. Sanctions imposed 
against Serbia and the Serb nation represent a constant impetus 
for the Bosnian authorities to continue the war. That is why 
lifting the embargo is the simplest way to make the Bosnian 
authorities abandon their war policy. 
  Yasushi Akashi agreed with the assessment that an agreement 
on a general cessation of hostilities is better than a partial 
one because it ensures the best conditions for the resumption 
and successful conduct of political negotiations based on the 
principle of the equality of all three sides. 
  Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic also attended 
the talks, the statement issued by the Serbian president's 
office says in conclusion.

<F P=106> ["Statement by the government of the republic of Kosova"; </F>
place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Greek terrorist attack on the Albanian military 
barracks is one of the most grave infringements of Albania's 
territorial integrity and is a flagrant violation of 
international rights. This is not the first time that certain 
Greek circles -- for which the Greek Government swears it has no 
knowledge of -- have provoked the escalation of a situation of 
violence and tension south of Albania with the aim of 
destabilizing the new Albanian democracy and creating the 
conditions for the realization of Greater Greece aspirations. 
  Statements by representatives of the most nationalist clergy 
in the presence of Greek Government officials and the case of 
the Greek priest who, fairly enough, was shown his proper place, 
and many others culminate in the act of open terrorist attacks. 
  The government of Kosova expresses the outrage of its people 
and cannot but assess that in these actions, it sees a 
coordination with the Serbian policy in Kosova and Serbia's 
efforts to open the southern front. 
  On this occasion, we want to remind Greece and Serbia that 
any kind of attempt to open this front will be confronted with 
the common answer of all Albanians and all the consequences it 
can bring. 
  The government of the republic of Kosova thinks the chairman 
of the EC Presidency should clearly dissociate itself through 
concrete actions to condemn state terrorism and prevent such 
phenomena before they take on Balkan dimensions. The statements 
on a policy of good neighborliness and barbarous terrorism do 
not correspond to the European climate. 
  Reminding that our neighbor has problems with more than one 
country on its borders, we call on the international community, 
the European Union, and other organizations to examine the 
respect of international rights from its members and take 
relevant measures to preserve democratic, common European 
values, the statement by the government of the republic of 
Kosova states.

  [Text] The NATO air strikes against Serb positions are the 
best response the world can give to justice and peace in the 
former Yugoslavia, as well as providing the best hope for a 
long-term solution to the crisis, a communique by the government 
of the republic of Kosova states concerning the NATO attacks. 
  The communique further states that experience has shown that 
only by destructing Serb military machinery will the aggression 
be prevented from sacrificing neighboring peoples and 
accomplishing their ambitions for Greater Serbia, because only 
in this way can equalibrium be attained in the Balkans and ways 
for an unconditional dialogue among the peoples in the region 
created. 
  On this occasion, the government of the republic of Kosova 
reiterates its appeal to the United Nations and NATO to 
undertake indispensable preventive steps in Kosova, including 
its demilitarization and the placement of international forces 
there. The communique is signed by Prime Minister Dr. Bujar 
Bukoshi.

<F P=106> [Article by "(rc)": "The Skoda Plant Is Liquidating Its </F>
Research Reactor"] 
  [Text] The Plzen Skoda factory is liquidating its SR 
research reactor in Vochov near Plzen, including spent fuel and 
unused fuel. The reactor is of its own construction and 
manufacture and was used from 1970 until 1989. This information 
was provided to RUDE PRAVO by Engineer Frantisek Svitak, deputy 
director of the Skoda Nuclear Engineering Plant in Plzen. The 
Skoda plant does not need the reactor anymore. It was used to 
test various measuring methods and devices, to train reactor 
operators, to train students from the West Bohemian University, 
and to conduct radiation testing for the republican Civil 
Defense organization. 
  Despite the fact that the reactor is not contaminated (it 
was 
reconstructed in 1986 and was not put into operation after that 
date), all legal standards must be met during the liquidation of 
the workplace in Vochov. Regulations regarding the handling of 
fuel are equally strict. The State Office for Nuclear Safety in 
Prague and the International Agency for Atomic Energy in Vienna 
supervise fuel-handling. Moreover, any fuel-handling must not 
contravene the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear 
Materials. 
  At present, they have approximately 10 kilograms of uranium 
235 in sandwich-type metallic fuel at the Skoda plant. The 
Slovak Technical University has shown interest in the reactor 
and fuel. Because of the lack of funds on the part of the 
customer, however, the negotiations failed. Prospective buyers 
in Germany have also shown interest but did not meet the 
requirements. The Nuclear Research Institute in Rez near Prague 
is currently interested in the reactor. According to Eng. 
Svitak, the Skoda plant is conducting the most promising 
negotiations with two French firms that would like to buy the 
research reactor and the fuel.

  [Text] Prague--Some 20,000 arms permits have been issued in 
the capital. The permit holders own 19,000 handguns, 5,000 
rifles, and 1,000 small-caliber firearms. M. Dohnal of the 
Prague police told reporters this yesterday. Last year, in 
comparison with 1992, the number of arms-permit applications 
doubled. According to Dohnal, this is caused by the growing 
number of businessmen who want to protect their property. The 
Interior Ministry is drafting a law on arms and ammunition. It 
should do away with the so-called group arms permits (there are 
800-900 of them in Prague) and require special training for 
applicants for individual permits and a psychological 
assessment. The policeman, unlike the legislators, believes 
that a permit should also be required for crossbows, which he 
described as very precise, quiet, and deadly. The law should go 
into effect at the beginning of next year. The theft of 
firearms is alarming; approximately 10 disappear in Prague every 
day.

  [Text] Olomouc--Beginning immediately, the 2d Army Corps 
of the Army of the Czech Republic General Staff will operate in 
the Havlickuv Brod, Chrudim, Usti nad Orlici, and Svitavy 
districts instead of the Olomouc Military Command Center. 
  The former six-tier organization of the Army is merging into 
three levels--General Staff, army corps, and brigades. 
According to Army Chief of Staff Jiri Nekvasil, the democratic 
states' representatives could not understand the former 
multitier organization. The main reason for the ongoing 
transformation of the Army is to make its structure transparent 
and harmonize it with the system used in the armies of the 
democratic states. 
  According to the commander of the 2d Army Corps, Frantisek 
Podesva, the Olomouc corps will be responsible for the smooth, 
properly developed general training of the troops and the 
organization of their daily life. It will also take care of the 
conscripts and the reserve soldiers in its territory. The 
previous divisions will be replaced in the lower-level 
arrangement by three motorized brigades--specifically, the Brno 
6th motorized brigade, the Kromeriz 7th motorized brigade, and 
the Valasske Mezirici 8th motorized brigade. The NCO training 
centers and courses will start their operation on 1 October. 
The soldiers of the combat units will begin to train in the 
brigade structure on 1 January of next year.

<F P=106> [Article by J.B.L.: "Rosati in Several Months"] </F>
  [Text] The leaders of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] 
and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] still believe that, in direct 
negotiations, they will be able to persuade the president to 
change his mind about the nomination of Dariusz Rosati for 
deputy prime minister and finance minister. Lech Walesa's 
spokesman says that a meeting with the coalition will be 
possible if it submits a new candidate. 
  SLD Spokesman Zbigniew Siemiatkowski said that the coalition 
insists on the candidacy of Professor Rosati because Poland 
cannot afford to lose such a competent man. Asked about the 
arguments Waldemar Pawlak and Aleksander Kwasniewski may use in 
their meeting with Walesa, he said that it may concern 
constitutional law and political custom. He would not, however, 
answer the question of whether the president might be threatened 
with amending the Small Constitution, so that the coalition 
would be able to neutralize the presidential veto--for example, 
by rejecting it in a vote by the Sejm, as happens in the case of 
other laws. 
  Aleksander Kwasniewski stated: "We will tell the president 
that he is a very good candidate, that his behavior in recent 
days has shown that he is a responsible and serious man. I 
think we will have to think about how the traps of the Small 
Constitution can be avoided; however, this is only one of the 
subjects of the meeting. We will not avoid a discussion on 
amending the Small Constitution because this is also required by 
the proposed change in the formula of the National Security 
Council." The SLD leader also said that he and Prime Minister 
Pawlak are waiting for a meeting with the president and that 
they are hoping that it will be held within the next few days. 
  It is possible that what the coalition wants is not to amend 
the Small Constitution, which would take several months, but 
only to use this argument in the meeting with Lech Walesa. 
However, if this argument does not yield any effect, the 
nomination of Rosati might be possible following the period that 
is needed to amend Article 68 of the Small Constitution. This 
would explain his statement that the issue may become topical 
again in a few months' time. 
  The suggestion by yesterday's GAZETA WYBORCZA that Marek 
Borowski may return to the post of deputy prime minister does 
not seem very likely. The Belweder would perhaps be prepared to 
accept this candidacy; however, it is very unlikely that 
Borowski would be able to cooperate harmoniously with Prime 
Minister Pawlak. Their cooperation was not very good the last 
time, all the more so because the former deputy prime minister 
criticized the head of the government after his resignation, 
saying that he had only one face. His comeback, though not 
entirely impossible, seems very unlikely today. 
  If the guess is right that the coalition is trying to force 
the president to accept the nomination of Rosati, the statement 
by Leszek Miller that there is a new candidate would be merely a 
smokescreen. Perhaps the SLD and the PSL want to wait for the 
president to sign the budget law and only then decide on a 
serious, as it seems, war with the Belweder concerning the 
limitation of presidential powers. Another solution is also 
possible: Having "softened" the president with Rosati, the 
coalition will propose someone else. 
  Presidential Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski told a PAP 
journalist yesterday that a meeting of coalition leaders with 
the president would be possible only when it submits a new 
candidate for deputy prime minister and finance minister. He 
added that the coalition should exhibit "a new look at things, a 
new approach." 
  Drzycimski stated that Walesa had not yet decided whether or 
not to sign the budget law because "he still has the time 
allowed by the Constitution; he is thinking about it." The 
president should sign the law within 30 days of 28 March.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Zalewski: "Will Right Wing Be Walesa's </F>
Artificial Limb?" under the "Analysis" rubric] 
  [Text] The right wing is facing a strategic choice. The 
decision it will make regarding the presidency will not only 
determine the camp's immediate victory or defeat but also define 
the right wing's form and future. 
  The right wing has two possible choices: It can either seek 
agreement with the camp associated with the Democratic Union 
[UD] and the Liberal-Democratic Congress and strive to come up 
with a joint, compromise-based candidate in the presidential 
elections, or unite around Lech Walesa again. On a party level, 
that would also mean an alliance with the Polish Peasant Party 
[PSL]. Peasant activists will most probably have their own 
candidate for the Belweder Palace, but, until such an official 
candidate is named, Walesa will try to avoid alienating a 
potential ally who could lend his popularity to the currently 
unpopular head of state. 
  While deciding on one of the above-mentioned options, the 
right wing will also choose the part of the political scene it 
wants to occupy, and with whom it wants to rule Poland in the 
future (of course, such are its aspirations): With Waldemar 
Pawlak, Michal Strak, and Jacek Soska, or with Bronislaw 
Geremek, Jan Rokita, and Donald Tusk? 
  Sympathies of right-wing politicians are diversified. It is 
easier to predict the future of the liberal coalition made up of 
the Union for Real Politics, the Conservative Party, the 
Peasant-Christian Party, the Party of Christian Democrats, and 
the Democratic-National Party because any kind of rapprochement 
between the coalition and the PSL is impossible for program 
reasons. But, on the other hand, this bloc (known as the Accord 
of 11 November) also includes politicians who continue to 
believe in Lech Walesa's lucky star. Despite many bitter 
disappointments, they would most certainly be willing to place 
their bets on this quite worn-out and uncertain card. 
  But support for Walesa's candidacy is regarded as a last 
resort by the Accord of 11 November, while sympathies for him 
are treated as a rather shameful trait. One party declares 
unofficially--in a whisper and in secret--that there is still 
some love for Walesa glowing in another party. The other party, 
in the meantime, says the same thing--in a contemptuous 
tone--about the first party. There is no one daring to admit 
openly his like for the current president. That is even more so 
because the little whispers are being efficiently jammed by 
determinant and tough declarations by Aleksander Hall, the 
conservatives' leader, who, ever since the "war at the top," 
remains Lech Walesa's vigorous critic. 
  It was precisely Hall who was one of the first activists to 
initiate a campaign for the sake of a broad agreement among 
Solidarity-derived forces and who has been calling for the 
"After-August [1980] Poland" to come up with a joint 
presidential candidate. And, according to Hall, Walesa cannot 
be the one, if only because he makes a bad president, but also, 
which is of importance, as well, because he has no chance for 
reelection. 
  It is quite a different story with the other right-wing 
bloc, 
which comprises the Center Accord [PC], the Christian-National 
Union [ZChN], the Movement for the Republic, the Peasant Accord, 
and the Conservative Coalition [KK]. On the face of it, the 
issue is less complicated in this case: The camp is driven by 
anti-Walesa moods that spread from the PC and are gladly taken 
up by the other parties. This right-wing dislike of Walesa can 
be easily explained. In statements by politicians of this side 
of the political spectrum, who, after all, contributed to 
Walesa's taking over his post in the past, disappointment with 
his actions is prevalent. They continue to hold it against him 
that he strengthened the left wing and weakened the right, that 
he betrayed his election program, that he approved and expanded 
on the principle of a "thick line," and that he is looking for 
support among remnants of the Polish People's Republic [PRL] 
power apparatus. 
  The right wing list of accusations against Walesa is long, 
and it seemed that the Belweder's cooperation with the 
"screwups" [Walesa's description of right-wing activists] is 
just an unrealistic fantasy. But, faced with the coming 
presidential election, Walesa began to look vigorously for 
allies: He vehemently attacks the postcommunists, and he 
mentions a need for decommunization and file-checking. For the 
moment, the right wing ignores the president and pretends that 
it is not at all interested in the Belweder's occupant because 
it is aware of the bankruptcy the previous investment in Walesa 
resulted in. 
  But there is a trait in many people of the right wing that 
could push them right into the incumbent president's arms again: 
an obsessive hatred of UD. This hatred is sometimes the main 
driving force of political action, and sometimes it is even an 
indicator of "being right-wing." Such right-wing politicians as 
Slawomir Siwek (who used to be in the PC) and the ZChN's Jan 
Lopuszanski long ago called for the establishment of an 
anticommunist and anti-UD front based on the Belweder. But, 
back then, Walesa contemptuously ignored the proposals. Now he 
is making an attempt to revive sympathy for himself (which has 
waned significantly) among right-wing men. Reluctance to UD may 
be helpful in that regard; this is even more so because, even 
now, some right-wing politicians (who, it is true, are active on 
the margins of the coalition of the "five") have been declaring 
slogans for a return to Walesa's bosom, accompanied by the 
spread of anti-UD banners. But a majority of right-wing leaders 
(among others, PC President Jaroslaw Kaczynski, a majority of 
ZChN politicians, and KK's Kazimierz Ujazdowski) are absolute 
opponents of such a scenario. 
  The implementation of the scenario in practice would bring 
about serious and long-term consequences. First of all, it 
would turn out that the Polish right wing does not exist as a 
subject on its own, while, without a battering ram like Walesa, 
it is not capable of scoring a political victory. This would 
reduce the right wing's role to one of an imitation, a dummy, or 
an artificial limb that can be used to lean on when there is a 
need, instead of a serious camp capable of political and 
ideological influence over Poland. The right wing would mean 
nothing without Walesa. 
  Second, right-wing voters could feel confused and could say: 
First we are called on to support Walesa, then we are told 
repeatedly that he is evil incarnated and a traitor, and then, 
in the end, we are to support him again. What is this all 
about? Have the wounds that were inflicted on the right wing in 
political battles with the president healed completely? Will 
Walesa not lead us astray this time? These are questions they 
could ask, and quite justifiably. 
  Some right-wing politicians also think it is the PSL that 
would be their best partner for a future ruling of the country; 
Walesa would also see the PSL in his camp willingly. While 
praising the "Christian-Democratic" and national aspects of the 
PSL, the party's admirers fail to perceive its weaknesses. The 
right wing would have to pay with economic concessions in return 
for an alliance with PSL activists: Centralist and 
state-control tendencies would most certainly score a triumph in 
the economy. 
  But, first of all, it is precisely the PSL, along with the 
Democratic Left Alliance, that has been defending the legacy of 
the PRL period particularly willingly, and they are also the 
ones that have been attacking especially aggressively the 
accomplishments of the four years of Solidarity-derived 
governments (in the latter aspect, the PSL is definitely even 
"better" than the postcommunists themselves). It is Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak who surrounds himself with Polish 
United Workers Party apparatchiks, whom the Social Democracy of 
the Polish Republic tries to hide particularly well in the vast 
areas of its premises. It is PSL politicians who have been 
comparing the post-1989 years with the Nazi occupation. The 
anticommumist right wing should keep that in mind.

<F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski: "Lech Walesa Will Fight; </F>
Advantages of the President"] 
  [Text] Recent opinion polls on the popularity of 
politicians have been very unfavorable to Lech Walesa. Sixty 
percent of the respondents to the opinion poll carried out by 
the Public Opinion Research Center [CBOS] a month ago believed 
that his decisions weakened the state; 17 percent were of the 
opposite opinion. In another poll carried by CBOS two weeks 
ago, 5 percent of the respondents pointed at Walesa as the best 
candidate for president; Kwasniewski received 17 percent and 
Pawlak 10 percent. 
  Lech Walesa will fight for the electorate. Even if he does 
not run in the presidential elections, he would certainly like 
to vacate the post with good ratings. If he manages to increase 
his popularity quite noticeably, if he has solid reasons to 
believe that he might win the election, he will run. 
  During his term in office, Walesa plucked up the courage to 
make unpopular decisions; he probably knew in advance that they 
would not increase the number of his supporters in the 
traditional electorate--among dissatisfied people. He might 
have expected that, instead of that, he would gain new 
supporters among people advocating market reforms, among those 
who "took matters into their own hands." It seems that Walesa 
attempted to "change" his electorate and replace the "negative" 
electorate with "positive" voters. 
  Now, toward the end of his presidency, it is clear that he 
has not made it. He lost a lot among the former and did not 
gain much among the latter. The same holds true of the 
political sphere: As he lost his rightist electorate, no new 
leftist supporters appeared. Today, there is no substantial 
group that, because of its material situation, interests, or 
views, would be mostly pro-Walesa. 
  Most probably, over a year before the election, Walesa 
decided to fight for his former electorate--the dissatisfied 
people. Discussing the budget law, he recently wondered: "The 
question arises what is more important to the 
reforms--`mathematical problems' or the understanding of the 
people." This may mean that he will be less inclined to make 
decisions this group might not like. 
  The dissatisfied are now favoring the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD], the Polish Peasant Party, the Union of Labor, 
and Solidarity. Many of those people do not define their 
political preferences and do not go to the polls. 
  Walesa won the sympathy of trade unions by vetoing the new 
popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] law. It is not known, 
however, to what extent it really reflects the moods of 
employees. 
  Why is Walesa speaking about the return of communism, about 
Stalin as Kwasniewski's idol? Among other reasons, because some 
of the votes supporting the SLD were cast not by staunch 
supporters of this group but by people who were dissatisfied 
with the reforms that had been carried out before. Lech Walesa 
would now like to win them over to his side. 
  The slogan "Down with communism" may still be an effective 
political weapon. Part of society will forgive a consistent 
spokesman of such a slogan many mistakes. However, will Walesa 
manage to achieve that? The people Walesa might win over with 
this slogan may remember his strengthening of the left pillar; 
some of them even accuse him of collaborating with the Security 
Service as an agent named "Bolek." 
  There is still a long way to the election, and Walesa may be 
retrieving the points he has lost. He is the president and has 
much greater possibilities than any other candidate will have. 
On the other hand, this is also a fundamental obstacle. Other 
candidates will be able to present their voters with a vision of 
the future without any limitations. Walesa is being carefully 
observed by the mass media, and he may always be accused of 
making a populist decision. Such decisions may be more of an 
obstacle than an advantage for him.

  [Text] Warsaw, 13 Apr--Presidential spokesman Andrzej 
Drzycimski said on Wednesday on Radio Three that Lech Walesa had 
decided to sign the budget law because he believed that, "at 
this moment and in this situation, Poland needs stabilization 
and a signal for the Western partners with whom we cooperate 
that we are a country that is taking a grave risk but, at the 
same time, is trying to bring about political stabilization by 
introducing legal norms." 
  "It has been a difficult decision because we already know 
today that the budget law will not be fully implemented. 
President Walesa hopes that modifications will be introduced 
during the course of the budget year. This need is probably 
also perceived by the authors of the law," Drzycimski pointed 
out. He added that the president does not rule out the 
possibility of filing a complaint with regard to the budget with 
the Constitutional Tribunal. However, he will acquaint himself 
with experts' opinions and legal analyses beforehand. 
  One of the reasons the president wants to veto the parish 
local government law is that this law comes into force during 
the course of the election campaign, Drzycimski said. "This law 
does not resolve many problems; generally, it does not resolve 
anything, and, in fact, it introduces more chaos," he said. 
  The president wants to talk to the coalition but not about 
the past, Drzycimski said. "The issue involving Rosati belongs 
to the past, in the president's opinion. This matter has been 
closed, and there is no need to return to it. If the coalition 
puts forward a new candidate, a meeting will certainly take 
place," Drzycimski added.

  [Text] President Lech Walesa today signed the law on the 
1994 budget. This information was passed on to us by the 
president's Press Office staff. The president previously 
criticized the budget, which had been passed by the Sejm, for 
not taking into account social expectations and particularly for 
failing to keep the promises given by the government parties 
during the course of last year's election campaign. 
  Today's decision was preceded by consultations the president 
conducted among various circles. Andrzej Drzycimski, press 
spokesman for the Belweder, recently explained that Walesa had 
asked the question whether to sign or not to sign many times and 
had received various answers. 
  The government coalition argued that the president could not 
refuse to sign the budget, which had been adopted by the 
government and passed by parliament, because this would be 
against state interests. 
  At a meeting of the Council for Local Government Affairs at 
the Belweder, the president announced that he intends to veto 
the electoral law for parish councils. He said he will be 
prepared to accept the law, provided the local government 
elections are postponed until next year. 
  [begin Walesa recording] My assessment of local government 
is 
quite good or even very good. For this reason, in this 
complicated situation, I wanted to postpone the election for a 
year, but it has not worked. The coalition wants to have its 
own people. This is normal. That is why, no matter what I do, 
I will not have time to make another move. If I had another two 
months, I could do it. There was social pressure. They are not 
strong enough not to change their minds. But I do not have 
enough time. My only possibility is the electoral law, whether 
it should be the old one or the new one. I am convinced that the 
new one should not be introduced. 
  Now, either changes are introduced, or I will insist on my 
veto of the new law. They will not have time to introduce 
changes. The choice will be either to change the law and 
postpone it for a year, or retain the old electoral law. [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] The council supported the president's position. 
Let me remind you that the council's members are representatives 
of local government assemblies and the Union of Polish Cities, 
as well as academics and parliament members responsible for 
local government affairs.

  [Text] Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, press spokesman for the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], has said that there is no need 
to postpone local government elections. He has described as a 
political game the president's announcement that he will veto 
the local government electoral law unless the coalition agrees 
to a postponement of the local government elections until next 
year. 
  [Begin Siemiatkowski recording] Delaying the elections means 
that 1995 would be dominated only by elections. Let me point 
out that we think the presidential elections and a referendum 
approving the Constitution must be held in 1995. 
  Adding the local government elections to these would result 
in a situation where we would not have time in Poland for 
anything but elections. The president, by bringing about this 
situation and moving the constitutional deadlines connected with 
elections, is creating a very dangerous precedent. We can start 
discussing the duration of other terms in office in Poland that 
could perhaps be cut short or extended. [end recording] 
  SLD leader Aleksander Kwasniewski has said that he does not 
understand the president's motives. According to Kwasniewski, 
Poland needs a stable political calendar; hence, the local 
government elections should be held on the dates already fixed.

  [Text] The government has decided to set up a committee for 
defense affairs attached to the Council of Ministers. The new 
committee will be chaired by the prime minister, with the 
minister of national defense as his deputy. Committee members 
include deputy prime ministers, the ministers of internal 
affairs, foreign affairs, finance, industry, and foreign 
economic cooperation, and the heads of the Council of Ministers 
Office and the Central Planning Office. 
  According to National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk, 
the committee should, above all, deal with reforming the command 
structures to bring them closer to West European standards. 
  [begin Kolodziejczyk recording] In brief, it will mean the 
departure from the existing command structures, the setting up 
of the post of the commander in chief of the Polish Army, and 
land, air, and naval forces commanders subordinated to him. 
  The next important issue the committee should deal with is 
to 
put in order the legal foundations for the functioning of the 
ministry and the Army. Here I would give priority to the deep 
and long-ranging amendments to the law on the public defense 
duty, which first of all should introduce a division of powers 
between the civilian minister of national defense and the 
commander in chief, or, for the time being, the head of the 
General Staff of the Polish Army. It is also necessary to 
regulate a number of other matters, which are outdated in the 
present reality and are even hampering all progress. [end

<F P=106> [Article by Victoria Stegic] </F>
  [Text] Sarajevo, April 13 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic said Wednesday he was "cancelling" all 
agreements signed with the United Nations as international 
mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg flew into Sarajevo 
to try to defuse the crisis. 
  In a letter to UN chief Butrus Butrus-Ghali Karadzic said he 
was cancelling all accords signed by the Serb side in the 
Bosnian conflict prior to NATO airstrikes launched at the 
weekend against Serb forces attacking the eastern enclave of 
Gorazde, the SRNA news agency reported. 
  "All of the accords that have been signed and the positive 
efforts, based on trust, are cancelled and we must interpret the 
behaviour of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) as coming from a 
potential enemy force," Karadzic said in his letter. 
  He added that the strikes by warplanes of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation against Bosnian Serb positions in the 
government-held Gorazde pocket could be not justified and meant 
that the United Nations was siding with Bosnia's Moslems. 
  As such, he added, "relations between us can no longer be as 
they were before this thoughtless act." 
  Karadzic said Butrus-Ghali should understand that the Serbs 
"could no longer cooperate" with the UNPROFOR command and said 
they would have to be "more careful regarding UNPROFOR troop 
movements and any equipment they transport." 
  The airstrikes and other "hostile acts" toward the Serbs 
must 
"cease immediately," he warned. 
  About 40 UN observers based in Serb-controlled areas in 
Bosnia were placed under house arrest following the NATO raids 
in Gorazde Sunday and Monday. 
  UN peacekeepers have also been blocked in weapons collection 
points throughout the UN-imposed exclusion zone around Sarajevo. 
The Serbs have reportedly placed mines near these points. 
  An AFP reporter observed Wednesday that a UN convoy was 
still 
held up at a checkpoint near the village of Kubiljaca, around 30 
kilometres (18 miles) from Sarajevo, by Serb policemen who had 
placed a dozen anti-tank mines in front of the leading 
transporter and behind the three trucks that were following it. 
  The convoy was stopped on Sunday "for customs reasons," the 
Swedish commanding officer said. 
  Meanwhile the Geneva conference co-presidents, Owen for the 
European Community and Thorvald [Stoltenberg] for the United 
Nations, arrived here amid a flurry of diplomatic activity aimed 
at defusing the crisis. 
  They went immediately to the headquarters of the UNPROFOR 
chief in Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Michael Rose, for talks 
with U.S. special envoy Charles Redman and Russian envoy Vitaliy 
Churkin. 
  Later they were to hold talks with the Bosnian authorities, 
a 
government spokesman said. 
  UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi and the UN Protection Force 
chief in former Yugoslavia, General Bertrand de Lapresle, were 
also due in Sarajevo later in the day, arriving from Belgrade 
following talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, 
UNPROFOR spokesman Major Rob Annink said. 
  On Tuesday they had attempted without success to travel to 
Pale for talks with Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. 
  Churkin was making his third visit to Sarajevo in as many 
days, arriving from the Serb stronghold of Pale, 20 kilometres 
(12 miles) east of the Bosnian capital, where he has been in 
talks with separatist Serb leaders. 
  Talks aimed at securing an overall ceasefire in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina have stalled following a UN threat to order air 
strikes against Serb forces unless they pull back from their 
assault on Gorazde, a UN-designated safe area.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 12 (AFP) -- Russian envoy Vitaliy 
Churkin and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic reportedly 
headed to the beseiged Moslem enclave of Gorazde Tuesday as Serb 
forces pursued their advance on the town in defiance of NATO 
warnings. Karadzic told the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA early 
Tuesday that he and Churkin were leaving for the eastern Bosnian 
enclave "to see the situation on the ground." The two men had 
met earlier in the Serb stronghold of Pale outside Sarajevo as 
part of a bid by Churkin to renew the dialogue between Serb 
forces and UNPROFOR following NATO airstrikes on Serb attackers 
around Gorazde on Sunday and Monday. Karadzic accused the UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) of taking sides in the confict and 
said the NATO attacks had "caused significant damage and caused 
deaths" in the centre of Gorazde, SRNA said. "NATO bombed both 
sides" in the dispute, Karadzic insisted. 
  Major Rob Annink, a spokesman for UNPROFOR, said meanwhile 
that Serb forces had on Monday "closed up to the river Drina" 
all along the southwest of the Gorazde enclave and were also 
trying to push southward from the north, coming close to Bosnian 
army positions. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
quoted aid officials on the spot as saying seven Serb shells hit 
Gorazde early Tuesday. Regular bursts of small arms fire could 
also be heard, said UNHCR spokeswoman Lyndall Sachs. But she 
said the observers in place described the situation in the town 
as "relatively calm" the day after NATO warplanes carried out 
their second strike in two days on advancing Serb forces. 
  In Sarajevo on Tuesday, UNPROFOR commanders defended the 
NATO 
airstrikes as a legitimate support of the UN-declared "safe 
haven" in Gorazde, denying Serb claims that UN forces were now 
taking sides in the conflict. Lieutenant General Michael Rose, 
UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia, told journalists the airstrikes 
were a legitimate, limited tactical defence and it was out of 
the question to see them as a political act. General Bertrand de 
Lapresle, commander of all UN forces in former Yugoslavia, said 
the air strikes should not be blown up in importance and should 
not "put in question the well advanced peace process," 
interrupted by the Gorazde offensive. "We hope to be able to 
restablish bridges and resume political negotiations, which 
alone make sense," he added. 
  A total 156 people have died and 646 been wounded in Gorazde 
since the Serb offensive began two weeks ago, UNHCR spokeswoman 
Sylvana Foa said Tuesday at the organisation's headquarters in 
Geneva. The total did not include the victims of Monday's 
fighting as the Gorazde hospital could not be reached, she 
added. Food was running out, with only 50 tonnes of supplies 
left in storage, since fighting has prevented fresh aid 
deliveries since March 22, she said. 
  In another report, SRNA charged that Monday's raid by NATO 
planes had hit a clinic near Gorazde, killing two Serb male 
nurses. Serb military sources quoted by the Belgrade-based 
agency TANJUG said the first raid on Sunday by two American 
F-16s only hit a civilian car. 
  Washington said Sunday's raid hit a Serb command post near 
Gorazde and Monday an F-18 bomber destroyed an attack tank and 
two military transport vehicles on the southern edge of town. 
Major Roy Thomas, the senior military observer in Sarajevo, said 
UNPROFOR was trying via the Bosnian Serb army to gain contact 
with a Dutch military observer and his Serb interpreter who have 
been missing since they left the mainly Moslem encalve of Zepa, 
northeast of Gorazde, Monday morning. The observer was on a 
routine administrative patrol, Thomas said. He and his 
interpreter passed through a Serb checkpoint out of Zepa and 
were last heard of at 9:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) Monday. 
  In Belgrade, a UNPROFOR spokesman said several UN vehicles 
had been damaged by vandals overnight, but he said it was not 
possible to link the attacks to Serbian anger over the NATO air 
raids.

Churkin will try to renew conditions for a resumption of 
dialogue between the Serb side and representatives of the UN 
peacekeepers following NATO's military intervention, which 
strained the relations between the Srpska republic and UNPROFOR. 
  Churkin has been visiting Pale for two days now, and he is

  [Text] Belgrade, April 13 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs have 
agreed to a ceasefire around the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, 
Russian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin said Wednesday [13 April]. 
  According to the Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency, Churkin said

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 12 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs 
retaliating against NATO air strikes placed at least 40 UN 
observers under house arrest Tuesday, a UN official said, 
severing lines of communication with peacekeeping authorities. 
[passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile the United Nations special representative in 
former 
Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, was thwarted in a bid to 
re-establish contact with Bosnian Serb leaders at their Pale 
stronghold near the Bosnian capital. 
  After a meeting earlier with Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic, Akashi said he and the UN Protection Force's 
(UNPROFOR) overall commander, General Bertrand de Lapresle, were 
seeking an urgent meeting with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic. 
  But Akashi and De Lapresle left Sarajevo for Zagreb Tuesday 
afternoon after failing to reach Pale. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, April 12 (AFP) -- Serbs placed at 
least 40 UN military observers under house arrest on Tuesday [12 
April], a UN official said here, as retaliation for air strikes 
against Serb troops around the besieged Moslem enclave of 
Gorazde. 
  Major Rob Thomas, Canadian head of UN military observers, 
said house arrests took place in Serb-controlled zones in Bosnia. 
  Police and Serb soldiers stood guard outside some of the 
observers' homes, Thomas said, while other observers had been 
threatened with arrest if they left their places of residence. 
  The house arrests were one of the responses by Bosnian Serb 
forces to NATO airstrikes Sunday and Monday on Serb positions 
around Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. 
  Another UN military observer and his interpreter were 
missing 
on Monday in Serb territory after they left Zepa, a Moslem 
enclave north of Gorazde. 
  Elsewhere, General Michael Rose, UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) commander in Bosnia, said Tuesday he was "worried" 
about peacekeeping forces trapped by Serb mines in several areas 
of Bosnia. 
  Talks were continuing Tuesday to free a convoy of Swedish 
peacekeeping troops blocked since Sunday at a Serb checkpoint in 
Kobiljaca, northwest of Sarajevo, French journalists said. 
  Serb troops planted mines around the convoy of six vehicles 
and 16 men after the first NATO airstrike on Sunday. The 
original reason for the blockade was said to be "administrative." 
  More peacekeeping troops were also trapped and surrounded by 
mines in at least three Serb heavy arms centres in the exclusion 
zone around Sarajevo, a UNPROFOR spokesman said. 
  Rose told reporters at a press conference: "They (the 
troops) 
are not under any direct threat at the moment." He said he was 
"worried" by the situtation but did not want to increase 
tension. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Staffan Heimerson from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] A report from Bosnia tonight says that 13 Swedish 
and two Norwegian UN soldiers have been held by the Serbs at a 
roadblock outside Sarajevo since Sunday. The Swedes were on 
their way to Tuzla when they were stopped and landmines were 
placed around them. 
  The nightmare in the intensifying conflict in Bosnia in the 
last few days has been that in retaliation for the UN calling 
for help from NATO planes or in revenge for the UN losing its 
neutrality and taking the Muslim side -- in the view of the 
Serbs -- the Serbs will deliberately start pointing their rifles 
at the UN peacekeepers. And now it has happened: 13 Swedish UN 
soldiers and two Norwegians are being held prisoner for the 
third day at the Koviljaca road block northeast of Sarajevo on 
the normal route to the main Swedish base in Tuzla. This 
information came just after 2100 from the AFP news agency and it 
was later confirmed by the leaders of the battalion. According 
to the same source, the Swedes are trapped behind landmines. 
  The Swedes were driving a convoy of six vehicles carrying 
essential supplies to the Swedish bases when they were stopped 
for what was called administrative reasons on Sunday afternoon. 
A few hours later the first aerial attack took place which was 
to force the Serbs to ease the pressure on the encircled Muslim 
enclave of Gorazde. The Serbian soldiers then placed landmines 
around the Swedes and their vehicles. 
  In the war in Bosnia, UN soldiers of all nationalities are 
living dangerously, but generally they have been able to avoid 
harassment or acts of war deliberately directed at them. The 
situation of the Swedes, however, is not so precarious. The 
leaders of the battalion are hoping to send other soldiers 
tomorrow, so that the soldiers, who are virtually imprisoned, 
can be replaced.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 13 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb soldiers 
have tried to reclaim heavy weapons placed earlier this year 
under UN control, UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Rob 
Annink said Wednesday [13 April]. 
  He said the soldiers tried to take the weapons Tuesday in 
Krivoglavci, northwest of Sarajevo, and withdrew after receiving 
orders from their command post in Lukavica which had been 
contacted by the UNPROFOR. 
  The weapons were placed under UN control following a 
February 
accord between Bosnian Serbs and Moslems on an immediate 
ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from around the 
capital Sarajevo. 
  The agreement was prompted by a NATO ultimatum to Serb and 
Moslem units to remove artillery pieces to sites outside a 
20-kilometre (12-mile) radius or face air strikes. 
  Annink said that following the recent NATO air raids against 
Serbian position in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, Serb troops 
have placed mines around three of the weapons collection sites 
thus blocking the UN personnel guarding the sites. 
  He added that the UNPROFOR is also unaware of the 
whereabouts 
of a UN military observer and his Serb interpreter who 
disappeared two days ago after leaving the Moslem enclave of 
Zepa. 
  He said attempts to get information about the pair from 
Bosnian Serb authorities have been unsuccessful. 
  Annink said that 58 other UN military observers have been 
blocked in Serb-held territory since the NATO raids Sunday and 
Monday. 
  He said some of the observers are considered hostages while 
others have been allowed limited freedom of movement. They 
include observers based in Lukavica, near Sarajevo.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 12 Apr (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, today visited positions of the 
Srpska republic's army on the Gorazde front. 
  At the Serb forces command post, General Ratko Mladic, 
commander in chief of the Srpska republic's army, briefed him on 
the situation on this part of the front. They then toured the 
front line together. 
  Karadzic did not hide his satisfaction with the army's state 
of preparedness and morale. During the tour, he answered 
numerous questions from soldiers. They focused on the current 
aggression by NATO forces. The United Nations has made a 
catastrophic mistake, Karadzic said. He added that Michael 
Rose, commander of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] will be 
remembered for his ignominious order to NATO -- that is to the 
United Nations -- to interfere in the conflict, thus siding with 
one of the parties in the civil war. 
  "They have aided the Muslims before, but this is the most 
direct form of support," Karadzic stressed. 
  In his address to the soldiers Karadzic said: "We have won 
and this is why there is so much anger against us. We won by 
protecting our people and our territory. They are now attacking 
us because they cannot stop us, and they have promised it to 
Muslim countries because their domestic interests are involved 
here. This is the twilight of the United Nations which is now 
under the dictate of one power." 
  The president of the Srpska republic added that some circles 
in the United States are behind this UN abuse and who have 
carried out their threats, thus "playing their last cards." 
"Now, they will have to send in ground troops to fight us," 
Radovan Karadzic said. 
  The Serb soldiers have said that they are prepared to fight 
to the last man. Radovan Karadzic told them: "You are not 
bare-footed Somalians. You are one of the most capable armies 
in Europe and they will consider their next step carefully." 
  Ratko Mladic, commander of the Serb army, described the 
current situation on the Gorazde battlefield as very positive 
and stressed the readiness of the Serb army to face every 
eventuality. The Serb army's morale is fantastic, Mladic 
stressed. He added he knows there will be further air strikes 
and that as far as he is concerned this is not news. 
  "Up to now, NATO has been waging a war against our people 
and 
the Srpska republic. They have been helping the Muslims and 
Croats in their fight against us with logistics, communications, 
equipment, advice. They have been stopping us where we were at 
our most powerful. Only now has NATO shed its mask," Mladic 
said. 
  "President Radovan Karadzic and I have issued an order that 
anything that flies over us and opens fire will be downed," 
Mladic said.

<F P=106> [Report by Mirjana Kusmuk] </F>
  [Text] After his meeting with Russian special envoy 
Vitaliy Churkin, at which they discussed the situation in 
Gorazde following NATO's air intervention, Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, visited Serbian fighters on 
the Gorazde front. At the headquarters of the Serbian army in 
Rogatica, general Ratko Mladic, commander of the general staff 
of the army of Srpska republic, submitted a report to Karadzic 
on the military situation on the ground. 
  The president of the Srpska republic then visited the 
positions of the Serbian army and the command of the Gorazde 
brigade. In conversations with the soldiers, Karadzic stressed 
that the United Nations and General Rose bear the sole 
responsibility for the bombing of the Serbian civilian targets 
around Gorazde, and that they have taken sides with one side in 
the civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We are constantly being threatened with bombing. They have 
now played this card. The only thing left for them to do is to 
send ground forces. You here are more superior. You are not 
the bare- footed Somalians, but are currently the best army in 
Europe, Karadzic said. 
  General Mladic expressed the view that there will be more 
air 
strikes. He said that the army's morale is exceptional and that 
the general command of the Srpska republic has issued the order 
to all soldiers to shoot down whatever flies toward them. 
  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] has been providing logistics 
support and giving advice to the Muslims and Croats for two 
years. They have now removed their mask and placed themselves on 
their side. Our only strategy is to defend our hearths, the 
weak, and our territory, General Mladic said. The president and 
the general also played a chess game on the first line of the 
front. 
  The Rogatica part of the Gorazde front is quiet today. Owing 
to poor weather, the Muslim soldiers have reduced their attacks. 
NATO aircraft are also affected by fog and rain and are today 
flying unusually high.

  [Text] Cajnice, 12 Apr (TANJUG) -- NATO aircraft overflew 
Serb positions around Gorazde several times late this afternoon 
and this evening, dropping to only 1,000 meters, but did not 
engage in combat actions, the command of the Herzegovina Corps 
has announced. 
  The Muslims again tried to take advantage of the low-flying 
U.S. aircraft, launching a fierce attack from the direction of 
Gorazde on the positions of the Herzegovina corps in the region 
of Jardiste and Majdan. Their infantry attack was supported by 
artillery fire. 
  As the command of the Herzegovina corps announced, the 
attack 
has been repelled while the Muslim units, having suffered huge 
losses, were returned to their starting positions. One Serb 
fighter was killed and two others wounded in the attack.

  [Excerpts] Bosnia is experiencing renewed tension with the 
advance of Serbs on Gorazde, which has been shelled for several 
days. [passage omitted] 
  General de Lapresle, the commander of the UN forces in the 
former Yugoslavia, justifies the air strikes by the difficult 
situation faced by the Blue Helmets in the region. General de 
Lapresle was interviewed by Remy Hourdan: 
  [Begin Lapresle recording] The first point, which seems 
essential to me, is not to give undue importance to the close 
air support actions. These were simply aimed at enabling the 
United Nations to protect its personnel based in the town of 
Gorazde. This was a very precise case fully anticipated by UN 
guidelines perfectly known to all parties on the ground. When 
UN soldiers or personnel are placed in a situation of 
self-defense we use all means at our disposal. If UN personnel 
had not been threatened in Gorazde we would not have used the 
close air support action as we did; we would have used another 
UN procedure to take into account the fact that Gorazde was 
designated a safe area and we could have called on NATO planes 
through the channels provided by the UN resolution. [end

  [Text] President Alija Izetbegovic of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency received Butrus-Ghali's special 
envoy Jasushi Akashi, and General Bertrand Guillaume de Sauville 
de Lapresle, UN commander for the former Yugoslavia. The talks, 
which were attended by Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic and Bosnia-Herzegovina Army Supreme Commander General 
Rasim Delic, concerned the difficult situation in Gorazde. 
  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic 
said after the talks: 
  I expressed to Mr. Akashi the readiness of our side to halt 
the fighting throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina on condition that the 
attacks on Gorazde cease. The Serbs [words indistinct] have to 
withdraw to the positions of 30 March, and then the political 
talks can start. An arrangement has to be reached that the 
cease-fire agreement does not turn into the freezing of the Serb 
occupation. There can be no political talks while the population 
is being killed. These are our conditions, and Mr. Akashi 
expressed understanding for our position. We stand available to 
Mr. Akashi and his [word indistinct] to continue the talks in 
order to achieve a cease-fire around Gorazde as soon as possible. 
  President Izetbegovic stressed the cooperativeness between 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina side and the UN, and said that, if the 
aggressor failed to show cooperativeness himself, decisive 
action against the Serb side was expected from the UN. This 
implies energetic [word indistinct] of air power against Serb 
equipment in and around Gorazde. 
  Expressing his satisfaction and honor at meeting President 
Izetbegovic, Prime Minister Silajdzic, and Army General Delic, 
Butrus-Ghali's special envoy Akashi said: 
  We agreed at the talks that the situation in Gorazde 
requires 
special attention. I understand very well now the position of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government. Based on these talks I will 
now be going to hold talks with the Serb side in accordance with 
our constant efforts to find common ground for reaching a just 
solution. Asked by the reporters whether he had already 
contacted Karadzic and whether there were indications that the 
Serb side would agree to talks, Akashi said: I will try and 
meet Karadzic as soon as possible. I do not think that anyone 
should refuse to talk to the peacekeepers from the United 
Nations. Asked whether there would be further air strikes 
against the Serb positions in Gorazde, Akashi said that this 
depended on the development of the situation. If our staff and 
the staff of the humanitarian organizations come under attack or 
are exposed to direct threats, and if there is a threat to 
Gorazde as a safe haven, then the United Nations will draw the 
relevant conclusions and can ask for close air support from 
NATO. I think that enough restraint will be shown, and that we 
will not be placed in that situation. We have carried out close 
air support action twice already, and I think that this is 
enough. I think that this should be enough for reasonable and 
realistic people. This is what Butrus-Ghali's special envoy 
Yasushi Akashi said.

  [Excerpts] Things are escalating in Bosnia. [passage 
omitted] Naida Nakad reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Nakad] [passage omitted] In the face of 
this dangerous escalation of tension, General Rose, commander of 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] in Bosnia, has tried all day to 
calm people down: 
  [Rose, in French] We must accept the fact that UNPROFOR has 
not asked for air support apart from for those times when their 
units are running great risks. Yesterday and on 10 April we had 
troops in pockets of Gorazde that came under unacceptable 
bombardment. Even after warnings. 
  [Nakad] Michael Rose also asked the Bosnians to stop their 
provocations in Gorazde. He suspects that they shoot on the 
Serbs to step up the pressure and to obtain a fresh intervention 
from NATO. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 12 (AFP) -- Late Tuesday [12 
April] Izetbegovic questioned Rose's assertion that Moslem 
soldiers inside Gorazde had shelled Bosnian Serb positions. 
  "We have sufficient reasons to doubt the reliability of 
General Rose's sources," the Bosnian president said in a 
statement. 
  He also criticised the fact that Rose had not specified 
whether the Moslem mortar fire had been in response to a Serb 
attack or a defensive manoeuvre. 
  Izetbegovic said UNPROFOR had "systematically... denied" 
Bosnian reports on the serious nature of the Serb offensive 
against Gorazde, adding that the NATO air strikes had been 
launched too late and that their "limited and selective nature 
has only encouraged the enemy." 
  Serb shells had killed 23 people in Gorazde Monday, he said. 
  Izetbegovic said he was willing to return to the negotiating 
table provided Serbs withdrew from all areas of the eastern 
Bosnian enclave they had conquered and a political solution was 
found which did not legitimise "the occupation of Bosnia."

  [Text] Cajnice, April 12 (TANJUG) -- Moslems from Gorazde 
were told when the NATO-U.S. planes would carry out the second 
attack on Serb positions near the town, a number of Serb 
fighters, who witnessed Monday's attack launched a little after 
14:00 hours told the TANJUG correspondent. 
  Two U.S. planes carried out the raid which lasted 45 
minutes. 
Civilian targets and Serb positions near Gorazde were attacked 
and six missiles were fired accompanied by incessant machinegun 
fire, According to Serb fighters on the front line in the Serb 
village Bare, two kilometers south of the town on the right bank 
of the river Drina. 
  According to the Serbs a full hour before the attack the 
Gorazde Moslems had informed the Serb fighters by radio when the 
U.S. air raid would take place, Goran Saric, a commander of a 
Serb unit in the Gorazde battlefront said. 
  As soon as the planes flew in a huge crowd came out on the 
streets of Gorazde and many climbed on roofs of buildings and 
looked on with binoculars, the deputy commander of the unit 
Ljubisa Borovcanin said. They had nothing to fear because the 
Serbs had not shelled the town in the last 15 days, he added. 
  For all their sophisticated electronic equipment the U.S. 
planes seemed to fire clumsily, with imprecision and at random, 
Borovcanin said adding that they used very powerful missiles 
judging by the ten meter long and two meter deep craters they 
had left and which were also seen by the TANJUG correspondent. 
  We did not have the authorization from our command to fire 
on 
U.S. planes and that is why we did not do so, commander Saric 
said. "However the fighters are already losing patience, 
especially after the death of their friends and I am sure that 
they will fire on the planes next time not heeding anybody's 
orders." 
  In NATO's Monday attack two Serb sanitary cars, clearly 
marked with Red Cross signs were destroyed, two Serb paramedics 
were killed and two Serb houses razed to the ground and not 
tanks as is claimed by NATO, according to information from the 
command of the Herzegovina Corps of the Bosnian Serb army.

<F P=106> [Report by Jelena Dabarcic] </F>
  [Excerpt] Muslim forces on the Gorazde front -- supported 
by U.S. aircraft, which have not been engaged in fighting up to 
the time of sending this report -- are attacking the positions 
of the Serbian fighters, and are firing with all available 
weapons. These Muslim infantry attacks have been repelled. The 
Serbian army fighters are firmly holding their positions on the 
right bank of the Drina River and are saying they will launch a 
counterattack if the Muslims do not stop their attacks. 
  The Muslim forces have been noticed carrying out fresh 
regrouping on the elevations of Gradina, Olujaca, and Trebecevo. 
A high-ranking officer from the command of the Serbian army 
told us that they had intercepted a radio message from the 
Muslims that U.S. aircraft will attack Serbian territories again 
today. 
  At the same time, the command of the Herzegovina Corps 
confirmed that despite the constant lies by Muslim radio 
[Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina], the Serbian units are not 
in Gorazde, nor are the fighters of the Serbian army attacking 
the town. 
  What was it like during the air attack by the U.S. aircraft? 
You can hear this from the following conversation between my 
colleague Milenko Draskovic with Ljubisa Borovcanin, deputy 
commander of a unit at the front. 
  [Borovcanin] I must admit that I had the opportunity for the 
first time to watch live how the U.S. Air Force supported the 
Turks, whose spirits were raised, especially when they saw that 
the U.S. aircraft were accurately pinpointing vehicles with Red 
Cross markings. I do not know where they trained and whose 
orders they were carrying out, but this was (?indeed) a morale 
booster for us. We waited for the order from our command, we 
were even ready to shoot at these aircraft. However, considering 
that the army has its hierarchy, we did not want to act on our 
own. I can convey you the feelings of the soldiers -- who were 
not frightened, which is shown and confirmed by the fact that we 
have retained the newly taken positions -- that next time the 
air force is used, it will be met with fire, according to our 
capabilities. 
  [Draskovic] According to what you know, since you are in 
visual contact and listen to their radio stations, it appears 
that they knew precisely when the attack was going to take place. 
  [Borovcanin] I can tell you that at the time when the 
aircraft were coming, we were observing the town of Gorazde. I 
personally was looking at it together with my fighters and my 
commander, who was here before me on the front line. At the 
time when the aircraft were overflying, a large number of 
citizens of Gorazde came out in the streets with binoculars, 
which clearly showed that they knew when the aircraft were going 
to come. They wanted to watch a great miracle that did not 
happen after all. 
  [Draskovic] You also intercepted a radio message? 
  [Borovcanin] We heard a conversation. We were threatened. 
The Turks threatened us that at 1500 the Phantoms would wreak 
havoc. It actually happened at 1445. So, this was a coordinated 
attack. 
  [Draskovic] The moment when they starting shooting, when 
they dropped the bombs, must have been horrific. What was it 
like? 
  [Borovcanin] Believe me, it was not horrific. It looked 
like a war game that we used to play on computer. We survived 
it and so did the attackers, unfortunately. The question is 
whether they will survive it next time.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 12 Apr (TANJUG) -- The government of the 
Srpska republic today expressed indignation at the United 
Nation's effective involvement in the civil war in 
ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina and its siding with the Muslim side, the 
ministry for information of the Srpska republic has stated. 
  The government draws attention to the already looming risk 
of 
this act leading to the very brink of a conflict of cataclysmic 
proportions and maintains that there is no need to emphasize the 
fact that the United Nations has undermined the relatively 
reasonable logic of the hitherto peace process by taking this 
action. 
  Apart from the necessary measures, derived from its powers 
and taken in keeping with the latest situation, the government 
has also decided to acquaint in detail the international public 
with the consequences of the bombardment of the Serb positions 
around Gorazde. 
  In this context, the ministry for foreign affairs of the 
Srpska republic will inform Russia, Germany, China, Japan, and 
India in particular about the NATO aggression and demand of 
these countries to condemn this aggression and support the peace 
process. 
  Taking into account all the elements of the civil war, a 
formula for peace in ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina must recognize the 
right to self- determination of all three peoples, including 
their right to have their own state, the lifting of sanctions 
against Yugoslavia and the Serbian people in general, a lasting 
cessation of hostilities, the disengagement of the warring 
parties under the supervision of the United Nations and 
territorial demarcation, the statement says.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1300 GMT on 13 April carries within 
its regular 40-minute newscast several reports on the combat 
situation in the republic. 
  According to the correspondent from Gorazde, ``the heavy 
suffering of the people of Gorazde has continued today. The 
chetniks have killed five and seriously wounded 31 people in 
Gorazde over the last 24 hours alone. The tragic (?list) of 
those killed [word indistinct] the latest offensive by the 
chetniks on this town has risen to 187. Of these, the criminals 
killed 25 children and 54 women and elderly people. At the same 
time they seriously wounded 778 people. Of these 84 were 
children and 170 women and elderly people. 
  "A particularly difficult and unbearable situation is in the 
Vitkovici settlement. The chetniks are constantly shooting at 
unarmed people from Biljinska Kosa, Sutjeska, and Hripete with 
snipers, M-84's, and antiaircraft weapons." 
  Hamiz Ceronjic and Nihad Salihovic report from Brcko that 
"the artillery and tank shelling of the Omerbegovaca and 
Vranovaca region this morning was followed by a major infantry 
attack on Omerbegovaca. The response by our fighters was even 
fiercer. Having suffered major losses, the chetniks withdrew to 
their initial positions." 
  Reporting from Bihac, correspondent Mirza Sadikovic says 
that 
the "targeted by the attacks were again the defenders as well as 
civilian houses, especially in the Buzim and Bosanska Krupa 
section of the front. Dozens of mortar and howitzer projectiles 
landed on Buzim and the surrounding area. (?Cazin) and [word 
indistinct] regions were shelled from 1100 AM. According to 
still incomplete reports, 15 people were hit, that is, they were 
wounded either seriously or slightly. The attacks on the 
defenders on the Grmosko- Srbijanksi plateau and Grabez are not 
abating either. Attacks by the paramilitary formations of the 
rebels and traitors from Kladusa were renewed this morning." 
  A correspondent from northern Bosnian reports that "the 
fighters from (?Lukavac) crushed the enemy formations in a 
powerful counterattack and forced them to flee in panic. After 
this successful counteroffensive, the fighters from Lukavac 
(?captured) the strategically important elevation number 403, 
holiday resort [word indistinct], and the hamlet of Mihajlovici." 
  According to a studio announcer, the "aggressor continued 
attacks on the Olovo front. The defense lines and civilian 
houses in [words indistinct] are being subjected to artillery 
attacks all the time." 
  Reporting from the territory controlled by the 7th South 
Operative Group, correspondent Smail Terzic says that "today, 13 
April, the aggressor attacked all the defense lines, and, as we 
have learned, [words indistinct] but without success. Your 
reporter has learned from reliable sources that there was some 
unrest today in temporarily [Serb] occupied Doboj, involving the 
civilian police and the residents of [word indistinct], who are 
leaving Vozuca and other places. As I report, Tesanj is quiet, 
but the enemy is shelling the villages of Jelak, Kalosevici, 
Alibegovci, Maltuzici, and Sije. Some civilians have been 
wounded." 
  A correspondent from Breza reports that "Karadzic's Serbs 
continued using heavy artillery to shell civilian targets in the 
Breza region. This has been going on continuously for three 
days."

  [Text] United Nations, April 12 (AFP) -- Ukrainian 
peacekeepers are to begin arriving in Bosnia on Monday [18 
April] to be deployed in Gorazde, a UN spokesman said Tuesday 
[12 April]. 
  Fred Eckhard said the 550 troops will travel by different 
means to Sarajevo and their arrivals will be staggered. 
  Some 220 will fly to Bosnia between April 18 and 21, while 
330 will travel by train with military equipment, Eckhard said. 
  He did not say when they would leave Sarajevo for Gorazde 
but 
Colin Keating, who holds the rotating Security Council 
presidency, said it would be as soon as possible. 
  Ukraine has already sent 710 peacekeepers to Bosnia and 
Eckhard did not rule out the possibility that additional troops 
could be deployed in Gorazde where there are already a dozen UN 
military observers. 
  Keating indicated that as many as 1,000 could be sent.

<F P=106> [Report on a telephone interview with Bosnian Prime Minister </F>
Haris Silajdzic by MBC correspondent Mu'awiyah Yasin; date not 
given; correspondent speaks in Arabic and Silajdzic in English-- 
recorded] 
  [Text] The prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina told MBC 
during a telephone conversation that his country does not have 
sufficient influence to resist the Russian efforts aiming to 
halt NATO air raids against Bosnian Serbs. 
  Our correspondent Mu'awiyah Yasin asked Haris Silajdzic 
about 
his government's reaction to the NATO action against the Serbs. 
  [Silajdzic] We can get a good action but, in my opinion at 
least, they are being too cautious and I am afraid that they 
would interpret this hesitation as another green light and that 
a different action, a decisive action, would be much more 
productive. 
  [Yasin] If the Serbs continue to shell the city [Gorazde], 
what action do you expect to see? 
  [Silajdzic] They have been hit twice but only two, as I 
understood, two tanks or at most three tanks were destroyed, not 
enough to send a very strong message. That is a problem. I am 
afraid if the Serbs practically make a draw, manage a draw with 
the United Nations and NATO, in this case I think they will be 
encouraged to do many other things in Bosnia and there will be 
only one thing left to ask [words indistinct] to lift the arms 
embargo for Bosnia and let us defend our country and that has 
been, as you know, denied to us. To tell you the truth, we have 
many soldiers that killed [as heard] more than 10 Serbian tanks 
there and they are not very impressed with the results. 
  [Yasin] We know that Russia is earnestly seeking to persuade 
the UN Security Council to halt NATO's attacks against the 
Serbian positions. Is Bosnia-Herzegovina expected to launch a 
campaign to resist these Russian efforts? 
  [Silajdzic] Well, we do not have that leverage. We actually 
expected this action; just like in the case of Sarajevo they 
came in at the last minute and actually made a big diplomatic 
point here. They will do the same round Gorazde and they will 
look like a big and important player there. They are an 
important player but it is true that they let Serbs attack 
civilian areas, safe areas, and the UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] for almost 15 days without any action. Now when the 
United Nations and NATO have acted, they want to be consulted, 
they want to be an equal player. This is what they are going to 
achieve, unfortunately.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1300 GMT on 12 April carries in its 
regular 43-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in 
the republic. Reception is poor. 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 1st Corps Information Service 
reports on the situation in Sarajevo that "since the morning the 
chetniks have been firing with small arms at the defense lines 
and the city itself. From the region of Perivoj they fired 
cumulative [kumulativni] grenade launchers at Vis, Dobrinja was 
under small arms fire all morning, while a sniper from Azici 
wounded a member of our army. Grenade explosions could be heard 
today near the FAMOS factory in Hrasnica, grenades that were 
fired from the direction of Vojkovici. The same weapons were 
used from the temporarily occupied territory of Grbavica and 
another of our fighters was wounded on the defense line." 
  Hajrudin Sermic reports on the situation in Maglaj that "the 
general alarm was sounded at about 1215 as the chetniks from the 
direction of Teslic fired six 155-mm howitzer shells at the 
town. The chetniks have over the last few days been 
intensifying their artillery and small arms fire, particularly 
at night, at the positions of the 201st Brigade. They have also 
been firing antiaircraft machine guns and snipers at the 
northern part of the town." 
  In his report from Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that 
"Karadzic's terrorists have intensified their attacks on the 
defense positions on the Buzim part of the front and Buzim 
itself, including the surrounding villages of (Cava), (Mahmici), 
(?Strabanda) and others. The artillery attacks are also 
continuing on the free Bosanska Krupa territory. The outskirts 
of Bihac have also been shelled, while the defense positions on 
Grabez and the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau are under constant 
artillery fire and fire from antiaircraft weapons." He says that 
"on top of all this, the Kladusa rebel traitors have intensified 
their attacks on the free Bihac territory. They have been 
cooperating with Karadzic's fascists on the Buzim front, and 
this morning launched several major infantry and artillery 
attacks in the region of (Pecina) in the Cazin commune." 
  Reporting from Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says that "the Serbian 
aggressor is carrying out extensive preparations for the 
continuation of the chetnik offensive launched two days ago. 
The defense lines of the free Brcko territory are again being 
targeted today by enemy artillery. In attacks on our positions 
the aggressor is mostly using mortars and recoilless guns, while 
heavy fire with antiaircraft guns and machine guns is being 
directed at (Djukici) and (Kladje). On several occasions this 
morning the aggressor fired a 155-mm howitzer at residential 
areas inside the free territory." He says that "the enemy has 
not completed the grouping of his forces. The aggressor has 
brought in new artillery pieces along the front line." 
  Mahmet Bulic reports from Lukavac that "yesterday's shelling 
of the defense lines seemed to have been only an introduction 
for today's fierce aggressor's attacks. Since early morning the 
Serbs have fired hundreds of mortar rounds and artillery and 
howitzer shells at the area. Karadzic's followers have also 
attempted several infantry breakthroughs but they have all 
failed, and the enemy has suffered great losses in manpower. 
And as always when the army of the so-called Srpska republic 
are frustrated on the front, they have turned their artillery at 
the civilian targets. Today they fired several howitzer shells 
at the town itself." 
  The studio announcer says that "the general alarm has been 
in 
force in Travnik since midday as the chetniks from Mt. Vlasic 
have been firing with howitzers." The correspondent from the 
town, Ahmed Begicevic then reports that "at almost the same time 
they started to shell the defense lines in Turbe. This small 
town some six kilometers from Travnik is at the moment being 
shelled with howitzers from (Komare) and Mt. Vlasic. At the 
time of filing this report, and it is now just after 1300, 
artillery shells are pounding Travnik and the citizens are being 
warned to exercise maximum caution."

  [Excerpt] Doboj, 13 Apr (TANJUG)--Muslim units intensified 
their attacks on Serb positions and residential areas in the 
Doboj area over the last 24 hours, the information service of 
the First [Bosnian Serb] Krajina Corps of the Srpska republic's 
army has reported. 
  Strong Muslim forces carried out several infantry attacks 
with artillery backing on the Ozren front. Ozren defenders 
responded efficiently forcing the attackers to withdraw. 
  The Muslims fiercely targeted Serb positions on the western 
part of the Doboj front. They fired several artillery shells on

  [Text] Petrovac, April 12 (TANJUG) -- Forces loyal to 
radical Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic and troops of 
his rival, Fikret Abdic, on Tuesday fiercely clashed in the 
region of the Cazin Krajina in northwestern Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  This was announced by the 5th Corps of the Moslem army loyal 
to Izetbegovic, which also said that Abdic's forces had launched 
an offensive along the entire front line and that the heaviest 
fighting was reported around Todorovo, Pecigrad, Skokovi, 
Culumak, Jabukovac and Buzim. There was no immediate 
information on casualties and on whether the front line had been 
moved. 
  In the autumn of 1993, Cazin Krajina Moslems voted for 
autonomy of their province in protest against Izetbegovic's 
radical policy. They favored negotiations with Serbs and Croats, 
with whom they subsequently signed peace agreements. 
Izetbegovic then ordered his troops to crush the autonomy. 
  Radio Velkaton in Abdic's stronghold, Velika Kladusa, 
reported a split between the local authorities, the command of 
the Bosnian Moslem 5th Corps and the Bosnian Croat command in 
Bihac, a town held by Izetbegovic's forces. The radio did not 
elaborate. 
  The Moslem media in the Bihac region say the commissions for 
prisoner exchanges of followers of Izetbegovic and Abdic have 
met three times in the Cazin Krajina region without any success.

<F P=106> [Article by Radovan Lazarevic: "The Factories Have Remained, </F>
the Experts Have Left"] 
  [Text] If it remains at least approximately in its present 
borders, the Srpska republic could quickly heal the wounds of 
war as far as its economic potential is concerned and become a 
moderately developed area. This assumption is not bold, but 
realistic, because this is an area which can more than feed 
itself, one that possesses an impressive stock of timber, 
considerably greater than the capacity of its own wood 
manufacturing industry, mineral wealth, sufficient power to meet 
its own needs, and a relatively advanced industry which by and 
large was not destroyed in the war. If it were not for the 
destructive activity of the domestic human factor and the ill 
will of the world's powerful toward the Srpska republic, the 
present hard times would quickly become the past. 
  Just as elsewhere in wartime, in the Srpska republic 
agriculture is at the moment the most productive part of the 
economy. And the figures themselves indicate how wrong people 
are who see the Srpska republic exclusively as a land of 
mountains, forests, and meadows. That is, no less than 97 
percent of the plains in the former Bosnia and Herzegovina were 
in the Serbian area. The Srpska republic, at least in its 
present boundaries, possesses 64.3 percent of the farmland, land 
which produced about 80 percent of all the wheat and corn in the 
former Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has even been calculated that 
the Srpska republic has more plowland per capita than the 
present Yugoslavia. 
<H5>  Ores in the Serbian Areas </H5>
  Mineral wealth, which at one time was the principal economic 
potential of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina, was also largely 
in the Serbian section of that former Yugoslav republic. To be 
specific, according to the figures of the Srpska republic 
Chamber of Commerce, its territory accounts for 37 percent of 
the brown coal reserves, 35 percent of the lead and zinc 
reserves, 84 percent of the bauxite, 68 percent of the iron, 12 
percent of the lignite, 88 percent of the gypsum, 89 percent of 
the quartz.... Although the Serbian side perhaps did not fare 
all that well in the redistribution of electric power potential 
in the former Bosnia and Herzegovina, even what has remained on 
the territory of the Srpska republic is enough to meet its 
needs. The installed capacity of electric power generating units 
on the territory of the Srpska republic amounts to 1,592 
megawatts, but because most of the Drina watershed is on its 
territory, and this is the largest unutilized power potential in 
the former Bosnia and Herzegovina, the energy prospects of the 
Srpska republic are nevertheless favorable. 
  The Serbian area also includes about two-thirds of the total 
forest area of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina. Forests cover 
half of its area. The timber resources of the Srpska republic 
are estimated at about 214 million cubic meters. 
  Although the main industrial centers have remained on Muslim 
and Croatian territory (central Bosnia, Tuzla, Mostar), the 
Serbian side has not really been short-changed in this regard 
either. On the contrary. The Serbian areas have about 60 percent 
of the textile industry of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
then 50 percent of the leather and footwear industry, 55 percent 
of the food manufacturing industry, most of the paper and 
building materials industry, all the petroleum refining (it is 
true that the refinery in Bosanski Brod has been considerably 
damaged, so that repairs would cost nearly $30 million), and, 
especially important, most of the electrical equipment and metal 
manufacturing industries are also on Serbian territory. 
<H5>  The Established Boundaries of the Serbian Space </H5>
  Certain extremely profitable industries, like the alumina 
mill in Zvornik, are also on Serbian territory. According to 
Jefto Subotic, its manager for many years, this firm, which 
employs about 2,500 workers, had exports in 1990 worth $296 
million, which is more than our present foreign exchange 
reserves. As for the plant itself, he says, it could go back 
into operation overnight. However, this mill, along with all the 
industry in the Srpska republic for that matter, is suffering 
from a chronic shortage of the most highly trained personnel. 
Bozidar Antic, chairman of the Srpska republic Chamber of 
Commerce, has said in a statement to the press that at the 
plants which are somehow operating the number of highly trained 
personnel is no more than 10 percent of what it was before the 
war. 
  Subotic, who in 1990 was proclaimed the best business 
executive in the Yugoslavia of that time (he retired six months 
ago), points to another phenomenon which could be a hindrance to 
rapid economic recovery. The SDS [Serbian Democratic Party], he 
says, must free itself of the role of supreme arbiter in all 
matters, including even the economy. In some situations it 
behaves for all the world like the former party committees, not 
stopping short of determining even who is going to work where. 
And while this might make some sense under these wartime 
conditions, if it becomes established practice, it could be 
disastrous for the economy when the guns go silent, Subotic 
warns. 
  All the figures given are for the territory which belongs to 
the Srpska republic at this moment. Whether its present borders 
will coincide with the final borders, whether it will be 
independent or in some alliances with others, these are dilemmas 
which no one has answered as yet. 
  The three-year Yugoslav war drama has nevertheless resolved 
one riddle: For the first time in history, Serbian space has 
been precisely marked off with borders. The coming months will 
probably answer the question of whether and when they will be 
under the roof of a single state. But one of our eminent 
economists, who for reasons of his own does not want his name in 
the paper, examined that Serbian territory in the light of 
interesting figures. 
  It has a population, according to his calculation, of about 
12 million. And if it should turn out that all the Serbian space 
should become a single state community, it would be the 14th 
most populous country in Europe. In national income, the 
possible community of the Serbian lands would be larger than 14 
European countries, in per capita income it would be greater 
than only seven countries, in per capita plowland it would be no 
lower than eighth place in Europe (which at the moment has 38 
states), and in its energy potential, relative to its own needs, 
it also has a high 10th place. It is also in a high 11th place 
on the Old Continent for its rivers and streams, but in terms of 
road development it drops all the way to 27th place, and in 
terms of the age-specific and education-specific structure of 
the population it is in 20th place. 
  Regardless of what the future political map of the former 
space of Yugoslavia looks like, it is good for the Serbs to 
finally learn where they live and what as a people they 
represent on the territory of Europe.

  [Text] Tirana, April 12 (ATA) -- President Berisha has 
received a letter from the publisher and the editorial board of 
the newspaper LLAIKO VIMA, a paper published in Gjirokaster in 
the Greek language for the Greek minority. The letter follows: 
  The April 10 incident in the border point of Peshkepi e 
Siperme grieved all the employees and readers of this paper. 
Acts of this kind, wherever they come from, have nothing to do 
with the sincere feelings of the peoples and the desire of the 
Greek minority in Albania to play the role of the bridge and 
factor of friendship between the Albanian people and the Greek 
one. 
  We believe in the will to clarify this incident to the end 
in 
order not vanish hopes for relations of good neighbourliness. 
  On this occasion we also express our profound and most 
sincere condolences to the families of the victims, who were 
unjustly killed. Our paper offers the families of the victims a 
modest sum of 80,000 new leks in support.

  [Text] Tirana, April 12 (ATA) -- Since April 11, the 
border crossing point of Tushemisht in the border between 
Albania and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM] has begun a 24-hour service for the crossing of 
nationals from both sides and of small vehicles, such as cars 
and other means of transportation. 
  Whereas the Qafe-Thane border point, known for the long line 
of vehicles and people waiting to cross the border, will 
continue to work for 24 hours like before, but only for trucks. 
  This change intends to facilitate the crossing of the border 
by nationals and vehicles, according to a source close to the 
Albanian Ministry of Public Order. 
  According to a note published today by the newspaper 
RILINDJA, the Macedonian Ministry of Interior has confirmed this 
change in a communique, as well.

  [Text] We have received a statement from the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs spokesman on the air strikes against ground 
targets in the region of the Bosnian city of Gorazde, which has 
been declared a safe area. 
  The spokesman recalls the Foreign Ministry statement 
regarding NATO's ultimatum on withdrawing heavy weapons around 
Sarajevo, which also expressed the hope that there will be no 
need for radical means to halt military actions on the territory 
of Bosnia. However, developments in the situation showed that 
certain sides in the conflict are taking steps that contradict 
the decision of the UN Security Council. This causes serious 
concern and reduces the chances of finding a lasting peaceful 
solution to the conflict. 
  The reaction of the international community under the UN 
aegis is an expression of its determination to take all possible 
measures to implement the relevant decisions on defending the 
safe areas and the personnel of the UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR], the statement points out. Those actions are a clear 
signal to the sides to the conflict to enter active negotiations 
to end the conflict. 
  At the same time, the Foreign Ministry statement expresses 
the hope that similar radical measures will not cause a chain 
reaction. The sides to the conflict are called upon to refrain 
from actions that could delay the achievement of the vitally 
important peace agreements.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ferenc Kulin, parliamentary group leader of </F>
the Hungarian Democratic Forum, Laszlo Kover, parliamentary 
group leader of the Federation of Young Democrats, and Zoltan 
Gal, parliamentary group leader of the Hungarian Socialist 
Party, by Gabriel Oszy-Toth in Budapest; date not given: "There 
Is No Alternative to Western Orientation -- Ferenc Kulin, Laszlo 
Kover, and Zoltan Gal at the MAGYAR NEMZET Roundtable"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Oszy-Toth] When you talk 
about joining Europe, do you also mean NATO membership? 
  [Kulin] Economic integration and adjustment to the European 
Union's [EU] legal system are the primary tasks, and NATO 
membership and the establishment of a joint defense system may 
be a consequence of these. 
  [Gal] For us, the question is how to join Europe because it 
is clear that we have to join. It is impossible not to join. 
[passage omitted] Joining Europe is concomitant with the 
acceptance of a certain value system, our Hungarianness has to 
be adjusted to certain forms of behavior. Fortunately, a 
process of decentralization has started in Europe, the regions 
and links within the regions are playing an increasingly 
important role. This kind of integration ensures that national 
characteristics will not disappear. The most important question 
of European membership is how we can integrate ourselves with 
the least amount of sacrifices and making the most of the 
advantages. [passage omitted] 
  [Kover] I also believe that there is no alternative to 
Western integration and orientation. Neither isolation -- which 
is advocated by some extremist parties -- nor Eastern 
orientation are feasible ways. In my view, NATO membership is 
not primarily justified by security policy arguments in the 
narrow sense of the word. It is not because we have anything to 
fear either from the Romanians or the Serbs that we should join 
as soon as possible, rather, because NATO membership is a 
guarantee for investors of the developed Western world. 
  [Gal] I agree that NATO membership would be a kind of 
guarantee, at the same time, Hungary's security also depends on 
the size of foreign interest in our economy. Gaining membership 
in the EU will be a long process, therefore, it would be 
worthwhile to consider whether political and economic membership 
could be separated from the point of view of scheduling. The 
political institutions have a greater willingness to accept us. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Oszy-Toth] The leading politicians of the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] are talking about the danger of left-wing 
restoration while the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is 
advocating democratic socialism. Can Zoltan Gal tell us the 
difference between the so-called democratic socialism and the 
already known versions (existing, flourishing, and so on) of 
socialism. Is restoration really possible? 
  [Gal] At the most, threatening with the danger of 
restoration can only achieve momentary successes at our 
opponents' campaign meetings, but no serious political force can 
believe that this could happen in Hungary. We are part of and 
we endure world economic processes that we cannot much 
influence. People who want restoration here are simply fools. 
[passage omitted] 
  Democratic socialism is not an emphatic part of our written 
program, however, it has turned into a campaign issue because 
our political opponents have mentioned it so many times. The 
chairman of the Socialist International spoke about this during 
his recent visit to Hungary. The MSZP is part of this world 
movement, its politics are in accordance with this. We 
naturally represent the ideas of democratic socialism. In our 
view, democratic socialism means some kind of critical attitude 
to all that we call capitalism or social market economy. We 
start from the premise that this social system is not the best 
one. A world that carries an extreme amount of contradictions 
within society produces rich people and millions who are pushed 
to the periphery of society. We aim to continuously criticize 
and reform this system. [passage omitted] 
  [Kulin] I agree with Zoltan Gal in that it can only appear 
in campaign speeches that the MSZP's coming to government would 
mean restoration in the sense that the central planning system 
would be brought back and the political structure concomitant 
with this would be reborn. We are afraid of something 
completely different and we think that the MSZP's governing is 
dangerous and should be avoided. The transformation in Hungary 
and the changeover to the market economy indeed started in the 
socialist framework, before the change of the regime in 1990. 
The social basis of the changes was limited to a 
political-economic elite. If the elite of this period came to 
power, they would halt the process of bourgeois transformation 
in Hungary. The MSZP's basis today is an elite who were the 
recipients and beneficiaries of the last decade of socialism on 
one hand, the rest of them being Hungarian citizens living on 
wages and salaries who would vote for the MSZP purely on the 
basis of their sentiment for the socialist ideology. In other 
words, out of nostalgia rather than conscious choice. The 
political background supporting the MSZP is of a much worse 
quality than what is represented by the party's political elite. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Oszy-Toth] Various coalition speculations have been 
revealed before the elections. What are your views on the 
election chances of your parties and with whom would you form an 
alliance? 
  [Kover] I would not like to start guessing the chances 
because many things can happen under the current circumstances 
with still a month before the elections. A good prediction now 
may prove completely wrong tomorrow. Naturally, I trust the 
effectiveness of the liberal agreement that was made by four 
parties, including the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]. 
I also trust that this bloc, and the Fidesz within it, will be 
a determining force in the next coalition. As a matter of fact, 
the Fidesz's national committee or congress will decide on 
coalition matters. This does not mean that different views 
cannot exist within the Fidesz's board or party leadership as 
regards the coalition. [passage omitted] 
  [Gal] In my view, we would need a certain "grand coalition" 
in the social sense of the term. This means that the political 
forces should come to an agreement on certain basic issues. We 
spent the past four years questioning even each other's 
existence. I believe that these elections will make it clear 
that, in addition to the conservative-national and liberal 
views, the value system represented by the left-wing parties 
cannot be questioned in this country, either. I agree with 
Kover in that it would be too early to make guesses because we 
do not even know the results. We are preparing for governing in 
coalition and we accept the responsibility of governing. Our 
strategic goal is to replace the current coalition and to make 
it impossible to govern by ignoring us, as has been done in the 
past four years. I mainly see a possibility for cooperation 
with the liberal side. For me, a Christian democratic party or 
movement that approaches the problems in the way the pope does 
would be attractive. In my view, a coalition with a socialist, 
liberal, Christian democratic, and Christian social attitude 
would be feasible. 
  [Kulin] I find it important to emphasize two principles when 
assessing the coalition chances. We will not under any 
circumstances ally ourselves with extreme forces. However, we 
consider all parties that are sincere about the political 
struggle against the socialist alternative as potential 
coalition partners. I am very sorry that one month before the 
elections, groups that cannot clearly decide whether cooperation 
with the Socialists is a possibility for them still exist among 
the liberal political forces. In my view, the postponement of 
this decision spoils the historical chances of liberalism in 
Hungary.

  [Excerpts] Dr. Mate Granic and Karolos Papoulias, the 
foreign ministers of Croatia and Greece, agree that there is 
great scope for the comprehensive development of relations, 
especially economic relations, between the two countries. 
  Minister Granic, who arrived in Athens from Ankara this 
morning, had private talks for longer than expected with his 
counterpart and host, Papoulias. Afterwards they were joined by 
other members of the delegations and after the talks which are 
now over, and which lasted several hours, the two ministers 
spoke to journalists. [passage omitted] 
  The Croatian minister assessed that Greece could play a 
positive role in the peace process. This relates above all to 
the implementation of the Washington agreement and the inclusion 
of the Serbs in the negotiations on a federation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The EU, currently presided over by Greece, 
should play a more active role in this process. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by O. Korinek, TA SR correspondent in Washington: </F>
"Partnership for Peace a Priority; Prior to Strobe Talbott's 
Visit to Bratislava"] 
  [Text] Strobe Talbott, U.S. deputy secretary of state, is 
the thus-far highest U.S. representative to visit independent 
Slovakia. What is even more important, however, is that he is 
the author of the Partnership for Peace project, which sets the 
tone of current activities and considerations concerning points 
of departure and solutions to European security. 
  His visit is taking place at a time when U.S. relations with 
Central Europe assume, so it seems, a new dynamism. This is 
because the domestic political scene in Russia, on which the 
United States almost exclusively and, perhaps, idealistically 
concentrated at the beginning of the Clinton administration, has 
undergone substantial changes in the course of the past year. 
The almost conflict-free partner Russia--let us only recall the 
Vancouver summit--has begun to act as a power with its own 
foreign political interests that it wants to assert. That these 
need not always tally with U.S. interests is borne out by Strobe 
Talbott's words in the U.S. Congress that "we will cooperate 
with the Russians where we will be able to, and, in areas where 
we will not be able to cooperate, we will have to find ways of 
minimizing the deterioration of the problem involved and of 
[U.S.-Russian] relations in general." 
  During the Cold War, the United States spent considerable 
efforts and resources to defeat communism. It is therefore in 
its interest not to squander the political capital it gained 
with the fall of communism. And, as the hopes pinned on Russia 
are becoming increasingly problematic, Central Europe, where the 
thrust toward Western-type democracy is much less problematic 
and which could also form a geographic dam against opposite 
tendencies, is moving into the foreground. 
  It is therein that one must seek the roots of the 
intensifying dynamism of U.S. relations toward Central Europe. 
Partnership for Peace is not only a security issue, but also a 
supremely political issue. The fact that Strobe Talbott said 
shortly before his trip that it must be transformed from 
something abstract into something real and be "given practical 
significance, especially in the countries of Central and Eastern 
Europe" and that, according to his own words, precisely this 
will be the central issue of his talks in Bratislava and Warsaw, 
clearly underscored the growing importance of the Central 
European region in U.S. eyes. 
  In an interview for THE WASHINGTON POST on the eve of NATO's 
Brussels summit, President Michal Kovac proposed a certain form 
of political membership in NATO for the countries of the 
Visegrad Four Group, an idea that he also reiterated in a recent 
article for the NATO REVIEW. Of course, it is scarcely possible 
to expect any changes to the form of Partnership [for Peace] as 
approved by the supreme NATO body. The United States itself 
says, however, that Partnership for Peace is, by its very 
nature, an evolutionary process. Hence, if no specific criteria 
[for NATO membership] are set today, and if no form of associate 
membership is conceded, either, it does not mean that no 
conditions can be established for this in the course of the 
Pan-European and, in particular, East European political and 
security development, including by the activity of partners. 
  The United States's view of Central Europe is the view of a 
great power. It is no coincidence that its representatives 
repeatedly place emphasis on regional cooperation among members 
of the Visegrad Four Group. Translated into plain language, 
this is an evident hint that the states of the Visegrad Four 
Group should resolve their internal and mutual problems to such 
an extent that their basic stability and orientation become 
irreversible. When considering European security, it is easier 
to think in the dimensions of a 65-million bloc --one, moreover, 
located in a region that has always been a bone of contention in 
Europe--than in terms of smaller entities. The incorporation of 
this bloc [into Western structures] will resolve problems more 
fundamentally, and a bloc is also better suited to influence, by 
its weight, the overall climate.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 12 (TANJUG) -- The president of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) Zoran Lilic assessed 
tuesday that by its air raids in the territory of the Bosnian 
Serb republic (RS) near Gorazde, the U.N. has compromised itself 
and become directly involved in the conflict precisely at the 
time when the Moslem side was militarily defeated in this area. 
  Lilic said this during his talks with the delegation of the 
Greek town Xanti headed by Mayor Filipos Amiridis, it was 
reported by the presidential information service. 
  NATO aircraft raided Bosnian Serb army positions around 
Gorazde on April 10 and 11, after Bosnian Serb forces crushed a 
Moslem offensive launched in late May [as received] from 
Gorazde, a U.N.-protected "safe area" which should have been 
demilitarized in late spring. 
  "The Serbs were bombed by NATO because they were exercising 
their right to self-defence. The goal in fact, was to prevent a 
military defeat of the Moslem side, to prolong the fighting and 
even contribute to its escalation", Lilic said. 
  The attack was allegedly carried out to protect the UN 
peacekeepers in Gorazde, though there were only 8 of them 
according to our information at the moment of the strikes and 
the clashes were taking place quite a long way away from where 
they were stationed. Therefore there was no question about 
UNPROFOR troops being in danger. The case of Gorazde is a clear 
misuse of the protected areas, first by the Moslems and then by 
the U.N. and NATO. Attacks in the Gorazde area were launched by 
the Moslem forces and this was known and tolerated, the Yugoslav 
president set out. 
  It is particularly surprising that, as some American media 
report, only 25 minutes were needed for the U.N. to give a 
go-ahead for the air strikes. At the same time, when we ask for 
UN authorisation to import medicine or any other humanitarian 
aid, which is not even restricted under resolution 820, days and 
months are needed and it is sometimes even denied, Lilic said. 
This points to the double standard policy pursued by the 
international community or a larger part of it, and particularly 
the U.N. which has definitely become the handyman of the 
powerful. 
  Lilic expressed his conviction that all peace-loving 
countries will condemn NATO and that the Security Council will 
have sufficient wisdom and power to return to the peace process. 
In this context, he stressed that Yugoslavia would continue its 
policy of peace but that it will know how to defend itself if 
necessary. 
  Lilic expressed his gratitude to the Greek people for the 
friendly support extended to the Serb people. 
  Xanti Mayor Amiridis regretted that during the visit of his 
delegation to the mother and child hospital in new Belgrade, it 
unfortunately witnessed the "devastating effects of the 
stringent embargo introduced against Yugoslavia".

  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO--Jozef Oleksy, speaker of 
Poland's Sejm or lower chamber in the National Assembly, 
Wednesday [13 April] questioned the ability of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to prevent Serbian forces 
from continuing attacks against Bosnian Muslims. 
  Speaking at the Japan National Press Club, Oleksy, vice 
chairman of the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland 
(SDRP), said, "our question is whether NATO's air raids can have 
any effectiveness as a warning against Serbia." 
  Oleksy is a political rival of Polish President Lech Walesa. 
Oleksy, a former communist cabinet minister in charge of trade 
unions, opposed Walesa's Solidarity prodemocracy movement until 
the SDRP's predecessor, the Polish United Workers' Party, was 
ousted from power by the Solidarity-led coalition government. 
  Oleksy's remarks came two days after NATO Secretary General 
Manfred Woerner warned Bosnian Serbs not to retaliate in the 
aftermath of air strikes against Serbian forces besieging the 
Bosnian enclave of Gorazde. 
  NATO jets, in two rounds of air raids Sunday and Monday, 
destroyed Serbian tanks and armored personnel carriers, the 
first NATO bombing raids on ground positions in the 
organization's 45-year history. 
  "The situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is evidence that the 
European security system does not have the ability to resolve 
wars stemming from ethnic disputes," said Oleksy, who is 
visiting Tokyo at the invitation of the House of Representatives. 
  However, he voiced some support for the air strikes, saying, 
"although it may be hard to support the air raids 
unconditionally, sometimes we should not avoid invoking military 
means in view of the uncompromising attitudes of (Serbian) 
fighters and the complicated situation." 
  He also expressed a desire to see NATO accept Poland as a 
full member. Poland is now only qualified to join NATO meetings 
under the "Partnership for Peace" scheme pushed by the U.S. 
administration of President Bill Clinton and the 16-nation 
alliance. 
  The partnership scheme is designed to draw former Warsaw 
Pact 
adversaries closer to NATO without guaranteeing such countries 
would receive NATO defense if attacked by an enemy. 
  Russia has balked at proposals to give full NATO membership 
to Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and three Baltic states 
of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, while expressing interest in 
joining the partnership.

besieged Moslem enclave of Gorazde Tuesday [12 April] as Serb 
forces pursued their advance on the town in defiance of NATO 
warnings. [passage omitted] 
  General Bertrand de Lapresle, commander of all UN forces in

in importance and should not "put in question the well advanced 
peace process." [passage omitted] 
  Major Rob Annink, a spokesman for UNPROFOR in Sarajevo, said 
Serb forces had "closed up to the river Drina" all along the 
southwest of the Gorazde enclave on Monday and were trying to 
push southward from the north, coming close to Bosnian army 
positions. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Mustafa Kurtovic report from Gorazde] </F>
  [Text] [words indistinct] a large concentration of their 
hordes in several regions on the territory of the Gorazde 
commune, and particularly in Ustipraca, Kozara, and (Mesici), 
the Serbian-Montenegrin fascists have this afternoon launched a 
fierce artillery and infantry attack on all the defense lines 
and the town itself. The aggressor is intending to launch a 
massive onslaught from the direction of Ustipraca at the Gorazde 
defenders at (Borovik). With combined tank and infantry attacks 
with artillery support from (Vojkovici), the enemy is trying to 
capture the strategic points on this part of the free territory. 
According to all the information available, this would be the 
starting point for the chetniks to break through -- from the 
direction of Ustiprcaca -- the defense lines at the very access 
point to Gorazde. 
  We also have information that the aggressor used chemical 
agents in the attacks on the defense lines. The aggressor has 
also used artillery to fire on convoys of refugees fleeing the 
burnt villages that the aggressor has captured in the offensive 
so far. We do not yet have information on the possible 
massacres of refugees heading for the town. The situation in 
Gorazde is extremely dramatic. 
  Throughout the day the chetniks from the surrounding hills, 
from the right bank of the Drina River, fired with snipers, 
M-84s, and 82-mm mortars at the area of (Vitkovici), and from 
(Lug) the chetniks [words indistinct]. Many civilians have been 
killed and wounded. According to the latest intelligence 
information, the Serbian-Montenegrin fascists are carrying out 
extensive preparations for an even more intensive offensive on 
the free territory on the left bank of the Drina River. The 
full force of this offensive will be directed from the direction 
of Foca and the valley of the Praca River at (Ostanica), 
Orahovice, Bare, Jabucko Sedlo, (Trogrlo), and Ustipraca. The 
commanders of the latest chetnik offensive have been hurriedly 
bringing in new mercenaries, cutthroats, and other scum to this 
region.

<F P=106> ["`Every Piece of the Albanian Land Is Sacred For Us' -- </F>
Statement by the National Committee for Protection the 
Autochepaly of the Albanian Orthodox Church" -- ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, April 13 (ATA) -- The National Committee 
for Protection the Autocephaly of the Albanian Orthodox Church 
condemned through a statement the barbarian act of the Greek 
commandos who killed 2 Albanian military men and wounded several 
others. 
  The statement writes: "Taking advantage by establishing the 
democracy in Albania and the friendly feelings of the Albanian 
people toward the Greek one, the Greek chauvinists used all 
their means to bring to Albania propagandistic materials, 
so-called `Vorio Epiri' flags, Greek priests with anti-Albanian 
missions, as it was the case of Kostas Stamos; in illegal ways 
they tried to take the leadership of the Albanians Orthodox 
Church through Janullatus, who has declared himself the prime 
bishop of the Albanian Autocephaly Orthodox Church through 
devices and contrary to the statute of our church. Janullatus 
has been hindering the Albanian state through slanders and has 
gathered around himself anti Albanian elements." 
  The committee underlines that it is for preserving the 
friendship with the Greek people and primarily with our Greek 
brothers of the Greek minority. But at the same time, the 
committee emphasizes that it is for a strict approach and 
determination against the chauvinism. "Every piece of the 
Albanian soil is sacred," the statement emphasizes. 
  Further on the statement continues as following: "We urge 
our government to take measures that these acts never be 
repeated, to inform all the international organisms of this 
question, to dismiss Anastas Janullatus as soon as possible 
because as it has been proved that he has caused great damages 
to our country. We will solve our state and church problems 
without the Greek intervention."

<F P=106> ["Helsinki Commission Observers Reports on the Violation of </F>
Minority Rights in Greece" -- ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, April 13 (ATA) -- The Helsinki Commission 
published in the DIGEST of January an article on the minorities 
in Greece, commenting as following: 
  "Human rights observers increasingly report that groups and 
individuals in Greece face persecution for expressing opinions 
contrary to those of the government on issues concerning The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
  Longstanding tensions between Greece and its neighbours, 
exacerbated by upheaval in the Balkans, have apparently led to 
the increased restrictions on the free speech. 
  Over the past two years, Amnesty International, Helsinki 
Watch, the International Society for Human Rights, and the U.S. 
State Department have expressed concern to Greek authorities 
regarding cases where individuals have been prosecuted for the 
contents of their speech or writings. 
  During that time eight cases were brought against 21 
individuals criticized the Greek Government's policy toward 
Macedonia, or for recognizing themselves as part of a Macedonian 
minority in Greece. 
  The situation of the Greece's ethnic Turkish citizens who 
reside mainly in Western Thrace, has continued to be a focus of 
rights observers. 
  While the Greek Government acknowledges the ethnicity of the 
Turkish minority-formerly considered Greek Muslims, various 
forms of discrimination are still reported, including official 
harassment, occasional flare-ups of anti-Turkish violence and 
use of the citizenship code to revoke the citizenship of ethnic 
Turkish citizens who travel or live abroad for extended periods. 
  Outspoken ethnic Turkish members of the Greek Parliament 
have 
also faced attempts to have their immunity stripped so legal 
action could be brought against them for various statements.

  [Text] Sofia, April 13 (BTA) -- A BTA correspondent today 
asked Deputy Foreign Minister Todor Churov about the Foreign 
Ministry's stand on a UN request for Bulgaria's assistance in 
the transportation of UN property and equipment for the UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] contingent in Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] via its territory. The 
deputy foreign minister said taking an official stand on this 
matter is within the cabinet's powers. The Foreign Ministry's 
opinion after careful consideration of the request, made on 
behalf of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, is that this 
country's reply should be a positive one, Mr. Churov said. 
UNPROFOR-Macedonia has an entirely new task to carry out. With 
its task to prevent the Yugo-conflict from spreading to 
Macedonia, it is the first preventive operation the UN has ever 
launched. Bulgaria, therefore, sees UNPROFOR-Macedonia as a 
factor of stability in this part of the Balkans, and its 
presence there, as fully coinciding with this country's national 
interests. 
  Being committed to Article 43 of the UN Charter, this 
country 
is expected to meet any request on the part of the organization 
to facilitate its operations, including passage through 
Bulgaria's territory when it is essential for keeping the peace 
and security in the world. In this particular case were are 
being requested to facilitate the passage of UN equipment and 
not military troops, which means that a decision on the matter 
should be taken by the cabinet, Mr. Churov said. 
  The deputy foreign minister went on to say that Bulgaria's 
consent has nothing to do with granting corridors for the 
passage of military contingents of countries which, according to 
Bulgaria, should not in any way participate in the 
Yugo-conflict, even if under the UN auspices. Our conviction is 
that the United Nations will use the equipment for preventive 
and not military operations. The request is within this 
country's commitments under the UN Charter and has a mostly 
technical character, the deputy foreign minister also said. 
  Bulgaria's principled stand in favour of non-involvement in 
the Yugo-crisis remains unchanged. So is this country's 
understanding that neighbouring or Balkan countries should in no 
way participate in the conflict, Mr. Churov said.

  [Text] Sofia, April 13 (BTA) -- The government Committee 
on UN Sanctions today heard reports by Deputy Finance Minister 
Khristo Kulishev, chief of the Customs Department; Deputy 
Transport Minister Kharalan Kharalanov; and Interior Ministry 
Secretary Petko Angelov, in connection with an incident 
involving the Bulgarian ship Khan Kubrat, BTA learned from the 
Government Press Office. 
  The press release recalls that on the committee's proposal, 
the Council of Ministers adopted a decree banning the export, 
transit and re-export of petroleum products from Bulgarian ports 
on the Danube River. On the Customs Department's proposal, the 
government passed another decree limiting the time period for 
transit of goods across Bulgaria and envisaging speedy use of 
detained goods posing an environmental hazard. 
  An order by the ministers of the interior, transport, and 
finance, effective as of March 31, details the obligations of 
the three ministries and their interaction for strict 
enforcement of the UN sanctions along the Danube. 
  A series of meetings have been held with representatives of 
the Western European Union and the Sanctions Assistance Mission 
to achieve better coordination of concerted action for the 
implementation of the UN sanctions. 
  A commission appointed by the Customs Department has checked 
customs documents relating to the export of diesel oil by the 
Rutoplast company. It has held an inquiry into the actions by 
which the customs authorities placed the ship Khan Kubrat laden 
with diesel oil under customs control. 
  The Transport Ministry has prepared a proposal for 
amendments 
to the Code of Merchant Sea Shipping and the Statute of Merchant 
Shipping, envisaging suspension of licences in similar and other 
serious violations. 
  Investigative proceedings have been instituted on the basis 
of information on the incident involving the Khan Kubrat 
gathered by the Ministry of the Interior. Six Bulgarians and 
four Yugoslav nationals face charges. The investigation is 
going on. 
  An Interior Ministry commission has held an inquiry into 
actions of the ministry's units in "the Khan Kubrat case." 
Standby crews and equipment have been checked. The Interior 
Ministry units have prepared plans for reaction in similar 
circumstances. 
  Representatives of the three ministries reported that 
disciplinary punishments had been imposed. The Transport 
Ministry reported that it had imposed fines. 
  The government Committee on UN Sanctions discussed an 
initiative by the U.S. Government on the transportation of 
Balkan agricultural products detouring Yugoslavia (spring 1994). 
  The committee discussed proposals for foreign financial and 
technical aid ensuring sanctions enforcement by this country. 
  The Committee on Sanctions heard a report on the preparation 
of a claim by the Bulgarian Government concerning damage 
sustained by this country as a result of Iraq's aggression 
against Kuwait.

  [Text] Sofia, April 13 (BTA) -- No official report was 
released by 8 PM local time today on Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov's health, after the government said this morning that he 
was taken back to hospital on suspicion of having contracted 
hepatitis. On March 8 the prime minister had a heart attack and 
on March 11 he underwent a quadruple bypass operation. 
  Berov's doctors have not confirmed the hepatitis diagnosis, 
national radio quoted Gen. Vladimirov, boss of the National 
Security Service, as saying upon his return from the hospital. 
According to him, a medical statement will made by 1 PM 
tomorrow following more tests. 
  The premier's return to hospital set politicians discussing 
the fate of his cabinet. At a scheduled press conference today, 
the leader of the Civil Alliance for the Republic Aleksandur 
Tomov said the Prime Minister's probable infection spoke volumes 
not only for the level of Bulgarian health care but for overall 
attitudes toward that man. According to Tomov, all people 
involved in the prime minister's treatment, including the health 
minister, should offer to resign. 
  According to Acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, Prof. 
Berov will be under quarantine for about a week. Berov's health 
did not prevent him from having two lengthy meetings with 
Matinchev, Bulgarian National Television said in its evening 
news broadcast. Berov's return proved more than what he was 
equal to, Matinchev told national television. He said he today 
advised the Prime Minister to reduce his contacts as much as 
possible, relinquishing his duties to his two deputies. 
  "I am sure Prof. Berov has a will to live and, most 
importantly, to rule this country", the ethnic Turks' leader 
Ahmed Dogan told the press following a meeting with President 
Zhelev. According to the Presidential Press Office, the 
president and Dogan discussed the country's finances and 
economy. At this stage, a cabinet overhaul may be appropriate 
but it should be proposed by the prime minister and coordinated 
with all parliamentary factions, said Dogan. Parliament and 
politicians may be unprepared for any other option, said Dogan. 
According to him, the current developments may grow into a 
political crisis. 
  The health of the state depends on the health of a single 
state leader; Bulgaria cannot do without a prime minister under 
the present Constitution, Stefan Savov, floor leader of the 
Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), today told national 
television. The coalition led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
(BSP) today discussed possible action in case the cabinet cannot 
stay in control in Berov's absence, BSP floor leader Nora 
Ananieva told the same broadcast. Berov's sickness necessitates 
immediate consultations, said Gospodin Atanasov MP of the New 
Union for Democracy (NSD). A resignation tendered by the 
premier would be in keeping with the Constitution; otherwise, 
the way out is a vote of no confidence, said another NSD MP, 
Ruslan Semerdzhiev, adding he would vote no confidence in such 
circumstances.

  [Text] Sofia, April 13 (BTA) -- Parliament today passed on 
second reading the Judiciary Act. It regulates the structure of 
the judicial system on the basis of the 1991 Constitution. 
Under this act, the judiciary will consist of three independent 
parts: law courts, prosecutor's offices, and investigative 
bodies. 
  The act provides for the setting up of courts of appeal, a 
Supreme Cassation Court and a Supreme Administrative Court, 
beside existing regional, district and military courts. Thus 
the presence two-instance system is replaced with a 
three-instance one. 
  The Supreme Cassation Court (SCC) is the final authority on 
criminal and civil proceedings. It will exercise supervision 
over all law courts. The court will also exercise appellate 
jurisdiction over all judgments and orders of the courts of 
appeal. The SCC will have a civil, criminal and military 
divisions. 
  The Supreme Administrative Court (SAC) will exercise 
supervision over administrative proceedings. It will be the 
court of last resort to rule on the legality of administrative 
acts. It is the only authority to rule on the legality of acts 
issued by the executive. 
  So far the functions of a Supreme Cassation Court and a 
Supreme Administrative Court have been performed by the Supreme 
Court. 
  The structure of the prosecution will be analogous with the 
structure of the court authorities: Bulgaria will have 
district, military-district regional, military-appeals, and 
appeals prosecutor's offices and a Prosecutor General's Office. 
The prosecutors will be independent of the court. 
  Investigators will carry out preliminary investigations in 
criminal proceedings. The act provides for centralized 
supervision of investigative services by a National 
Investigation Service. The National Investigation Service will 
investigate especially complicated cases on the territory of 
this country, crimes committed abroad and cases opened under 
legal assistance treaties with other states. In the course of 
debates some MP's spoke against the existence of a National 
Investigation Service, citing the Constitution, which does not 
provide for a centralized investigative body. 
  The act regulates the status of judges, prosecutors and 
investigators. They will be appointed, promoted, demoted, moved 
and dismissed by the Supreme Judicial Council. Judges, 
prosecutors and investigators become irreplaceable following 
three years in office and are granted immunity. Immunity may be 
lifted by the Supreme Judicial Council, if there is enough 
evidence of the commitment of a public law offence. 
  The act sets an experience requirement for judges, 
investigators and prosecutors. Heated debates were caused by a 
text in the act requiring the presidents of the Supreme 
Cassation Court and the Supreme Administrative Court, the 
Prosecutor General and the director of the National 
Investigation Service to have served for at least 14 years in 
the legal system, of which at least 5 years as, respectively, 
judges, prosecutors or investigators. According to Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS) MP's, this text was aimed against 
President of the Supreme Court Ivan Grigorov and Prosecutor 
General Ivan Tatarchev, who have served only as lawyers. SDS 
MP's described the text as a step toward recommunization. 
Describing the provision as unconstitutional, they said they 
would refer the matter to the Constitutional Court.

  [Text] Kozloduy, April 13 (BTA) -- Jean-Pierre Delcasso, 
leader of a team of the World Association of Nuclear Operators 
(WANO), described as very fruitful his work together with 
operators of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant for the upgrading 
of the nuclear and operational safety of the older generating 
units. Mr. Delcasso called a news conference today at the end 
of his one-year mandate as WANO team leader. The team has been 
working here for two and a half years. It exercises technical 
and management supervision and shares its experience with 
Bulgarian operators. Summing up, Mr. Delcasso said Units One 
and Two had been revamped and their safety upgraded. The WANO 
team has helped sign an agreement between an engineering centre 
in Lyons and Energoproekt of Bulgaria. Contacts have been 
established between the Kozloduy Power Plant and Buget of 
France, as well as between the National Electricity Company and 
Electricite de France. In 1993 alone the latter provided 12 
million French francs to the Kozloduy Plant and a further 8 
million is to come. 
  Expressing WANO's position, Mr. Delcasso said the Kozloduy 
Plant was good and safe, adding that much money would be needed 
to keep it in that condition. He called on the Bulgarian 
Government to provide finance for the power plant and to commit 
itself to its future and to the future of nuclear power 
engineering. In France, both the prime minister and the finance 
minister bear direct, even legal, responsibility if they fail to 
perform their duty concerning nuclear power plants, Mr. Delcasso 
said. He presented the new team leader, Mr. Bernard Paillen, 
until now director of a nuclear power plant in Normandy. 
  For his part Kozloduy chief Kozma Kuzmanov said: "The day 
will come soon when we will have to shut down the plant for lack 
of money needed for its safe operation." The plant got an 
average of 200 million leva a month from the exchequer in 1993, 
and a mere 180 million leva for the first quarter of this year, 
despite the deterioration of financial indicators: the 
strengthening of the dollar against the lev, a rise in inflation 
and the introduction of VAT [value-added tax]. The Kozloduy 
Plant is not ours, we are only employees here; it belongs to 
Bulgaria, it is the dynamo of Bulgaria's economy, a national 
asset, so that everybody should care for it, Mr. Kuzmanov told 
the news conference. 
  He accused of demagoguery and terrorism "experts" who 
expressed faked concern in the press saying that the plant posed 
a danger. Kozloduy's operators and management bear the entire 
responsibility for its safety and they come in for a great deal 
of unfounded, tendentious and incompetent criticism. "We are 
tired of explaining that this is a normal power plant like any 
other power plant in the world. We have convinced the world of 
this but it will take more effort to do so in Bulgaria," Deputy 
Manager Ivan Ivanov said.

  [Text] Prague, April 13 (CTK) -- The Czech Government view 
of the NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb targets near 
Gorazde on April 10-11 was identical to the Foreign Ministry's, 
Premier Vaclav Klaus told journalists after a cabinet meeting 
today. 
  In a communique issued on Monday [11 April] the Foreign 
Ministry supported the United Nations and NATO decision to bomb 
Bosnian Serb positions near Gorazde in Bosnia. 
  At the meeting the government approved Klaus's visit to 
South 
America. Klaus will visit Chile, Brazil and Argentina. Klaus 
said the government considered Latin American countries to be 
very important markets for the Czech Republic and the territory 
where problems similar to transformation of Central and East 
European countries were being solved. 
  Klaus will leave Prague on April 17 to return on April 27.

  [Text] Prague, April 14 (CTK) -- The heads of state of 
seven Central European countries will gather on Friday against 
the background of the colorful, culturally rich East Bohemian 
town of Litomysl for two days of informal talks on the 
perspectives for cooperation in this region at the heart of 
Europe. 
  Czech President Vaclav Havel is host to the meeting, which 
will be attended also by: Thomas Klestil (Austria), Richard von 
Weizsaecker (Germany), Arpad Goncz (Hungary), Lech Walesa 
(Poland), Michal Kovac (Slovakia), and Milan Kucan (Slovenia). 
  The seven presidents will discuss long-term possibilities 
for 
cooperation throughout the continent, but primarily in Central 
Europe. They do not intend to form any kind of union, adopt 
some initiative, or sign any strategic documents. 
  Four specific themes have been identified as topics for 
discussion. First is the definition of Central Europe, its 
position and perspectives, and possibilities for cooperation 
within the region. Second is the position of Central Europe 
within an overall European context. Third is the problem of 
Russia and the Balkans. Fourth is the present condition of 
Europe, its problems and tasks, the threats it faces, and 
perspectives on its integration. 
  On Saturday the seven presidents will hold a live televised 
discussion, moderated by French political scientist Jacques 
Rupnik. 
  The April 15-16 meeting follows up a last year's meeting of 
Havel, Goncz, Klestil and Weizsaecker at the Salzburg Music 
Festival. Like that meeting, the current one will include 
several cultural events. 
  The two days may also include some bilateral discussions, 
although none are formally planned. At the request of Austria's 
President Klestil, Havel has expressed his willingness to 
discuss the Temelin nuclear power plant being built in southern 
Bohemia. 
  Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus will pay a brief visit as well, 
and will have dinner with the presidents on Friday night. 
  At the conclusion of the conference on Saturday, six of the 
presidents will bid farewell to President von Weizsacker, who is 
leaving office later this year. 
  Besides the hundreds of officials, police officers, 
journalists and others, local residents are also eagerly 
awaiting the presidential gathering. The last head of state to 
visit Litomysl was Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Josef I, who 
stayed there in the 1880s during some military exercises. 
  Litomysl is being repaired and cleaned up for the visit, but 
"we are not building any Potemkin village," Mayor Miroslav Brydl 
said. He added that he intends to invite the heads of state to a 
glass of slivovice (plum brandy), but is not sure if the 
beverage meets the requirements of diplomatic protocol. 
  The six guest presidents will spend Friday night at the 
Hotel 
Cernigov in nearby Hradec Kralove, while Havel is being prepared 
a room in Litomysl Castle. 
  On Saturday and Sunday the castle will also host a symposium 
of Central European intellectuals under the title "A Shared 
Solitude," organized by +Stredoevropske noviny+ (Central 
European News). Participants will meet with President Havel on 
Saturday. Among them are Czech Culture Minister Pavel Tigrid, 
former Slovak Culture Minister Ladislav Snopko and Czech writer 
Ivan Klima, political scientist Jacques Rupnik, and former Czech 
Premier Petr Pithart.

  [Text] Prague, April 13 (CTK) -- President Vaclav Havel 
told journalists today that he had prepared four broad topics 
for discussion during the meeting of the seven Central European 
presidents on Saturday [16 April] and Sunday in the east 
Bohemian town of Litomysl. 
  The first topic Havel proposes is the question of 
cooperation 
in Central Europe, the definition of the Central European space 
and the discussion of its character and prospects. 
  The second is the context of Central Europe in Europe 
itself. 
Theme three, Havel said, is Russia and the Balkans, because 
every discussion of Europe has to include these regions. 
Lastly, the present state of Europe, its problems, tasks, the 
dangers it faces and the prospects of its integration. 
  The main significance of the event, however, will be the 
opportunity it presents for informal discussions, during which 
differences of opinion need not be harmful, he said. 
  The six presidents Havel will be playing host to are from 
Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Poland and Germany. 
Although Germany has only got "one foot" in Central Europe, as 
Havel said, its president, Richard von Weizsacker, was in office 
during Germany's reunification and several other moments crucial 
for Central Europe. Germany's participation may also help the 
country to formulate its relationship with its immediate eastern 
neighbors, he said. 
  Havel said he hoped the location of the meeting would 
contribute to the renewal of the spirit of regionalism which 
characterized the Czech lands in the time before communism, when 
the Czech republic became "just Prague and its surroundings".

  [Text] Prague, April 13 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec, during his forthcoming visit to Vietnam, the 
main goal of which is to strengthen mutual economic relations 
after a long period of stagnation, intends to raise the question 
of human rights, diplomatic sources told CTK today. 
  They were reacting to an open letter received on Tuesday 
[April 12] by Zieleniec from the Vietnamese Renewal Party whose 
main goal is installing democracy in Vietnam. 
  The Czech section of the party added to the letter a list of 
almost 150 people imprisoned in Vietnam for their religious 
convictions or for expressing disagreement with the Vietnamese 
government. 
  The section expressed its disappointment that articles in 
the 
Czech press about Czech leaders' recent visits to Vietnam did 
not mention human rights breaches in that country. 
  Swedish Premier Carl Bildt and Australian Premier Paul 
Keating, during their recent visits to Vietnam, pointed to the 
violation of human rights and freedoms in Vietnam. Keating who 
was a subject of pressure from the strong Vietnamese community 
in his country, pointed to the Vietnamese leadership approach 
towards religious and political dissidents. Nevertheless 
Keating made it clear that human rights were only one topic for 
discussion and that they should not influence relations between 
Australia and Vietnam. 
  Hanoi is usually irritated when this side of the life of 
Vietnamese society is pointed at and considers it interference 
into its internal affairs. 
  Zieleniec will start his three-day official visit to Vietnam 
on April 16. From Vietnam he travel to Malaysia and Australia.

  [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- President Vaclav Havel 
met a delegation from the North Atlantic Assembly (NAA) and 
discussed Czech integration in West European structures, 
presidential spokesman Ladislav Spacek told reporters today. 
  Havel explained to them that the post-communist countries of 
Europe were rather "impatient" to be admitted because in view of 
recent historical experience they currently felt "in the air" 
politically, economically and in issues of security. They "have 
a different perception", Spacek said. 
  The delegation also met representatives of the Czech 
parliamentary foreign committee and discussed the transformation 
process underway in the Czech Republic as well as the creation 
of a Europe-wide security system, committee chairman Jiri Payne 
told journalists. Czech deputies acquainted NAA Chairman Loic 
Bouvard with some "concepts of the future of European security", 
Payne said. 
  Payne told CTK that remnants of the old bipolar logic had 
still to be overcome. "The world isn't so straightforward and 
black and white these days," he said. "There are also other 
possibilities." 
  Bouvard and NAA Secretary-General Peter Corterier started a 
three-day visit to the Czech Republic on Sunday. On Wednesday 
they are due to fly on to Slovakia. 
  Bouvard also met parliamentary groups of political parties 
today. Marek Benda, chairman of the Christian Democratic Party's 
(KDS) deputies, said Bouvard and the deputies had agreed that 
NATO was a "symbol of the protection of certain democratic and 
other traditions of Europe". Deputies had also expressed the 
wish that integration into Western structures should proceed 
"much more quickly", he said. 
  The NAA strives to increase cooperation among the member 
states of NATO. Founded in 1955, it meets twice a year in the 
presence of NATO representatives.

  [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- Deputy Foreign Minister 
Alexandr Vondra told the North Atlantic Assembly (NAA) 
representatives visiting the country that the Czech government 
is shortly to debate a document expounding its conception of 
cooperation with NATO in the framework of the Partnership for 
Peace. The Czech Republic joined the Partnership for Peace 
program in March this year. 
  The document will cover both cooperation in peace-keeping 
activities, such as the present participation of a Czech 
contingent in the UNPROFOR [UN protection] force in 
ex-Yugoslavia, as well as questions of funding and legislation, 
he said. Vondra was speaking after his meeting with NAA 
Chairman Loic Bouvard and Secretary- General Peter Corterier. 
  Parliamentary Chairman Milan Uhde told journalists it was a 
huge lesson in solidarity that the Czech Republic, although 
feeling threatened by no country, was intensively interested in 
collective European security.

  [Text] PRAGUE, April 13 (CTK) -- The intervention of NATO 
air forces and UNPROFOR troops is being dictated by a bad 
conscience for the past political incompetence of Western 
governments, Jiri Holub, foreign policy secretary of the Liberal 
Social Union [LSU] and former Czechoslovak Ambassador to Italy, 
told journalists today. 
  The LSU is convinced that not all political means have been 
applied, he said, adding that "we are harvesting the fruit of 
the disintegration of Yugoslavia, which was a bad act." At the 
beginning of the crisis there were several solutions such as 
"democratization, democratic federalization and a confederative 
set-up," Holub noted. 
  He also asked why Italy will not attend the forthcoming 
presidential meeting in Litomysl and why Slovenia is being torn 
out of the Balkan area. "If the presidential meeting is attended 
by Germany and Slovenia, it should also be attended by Italy," 
he stressed. 
  LSU Chairman Frantisek Trnka cautioned that Czech-Slovak 
relations were not developing favorably. He pointed to the 
reluctance of the Czech Republic to hand over the shares of the 
Czech Commercial Bank to which Slovakia has a legal right. He 
called the obstructions politically wrong.

  [Text] Prague, April 13 (CTK) -- At its meeting today, the 
Czech Government rejected the bill on the restitution of 
property to Jewish individuals submitted by Deputy Viktor Dobal 
from the government coalition Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), 
Premier Vaclav Klaus told journalists. 
  He said the government had been preparing its own bill on 
extra-judicial rehabilitations which would solve the problem of 
property wrongs committed against Jewish people in 1938-1945. 
  The government disagreed with certain passages in the 
deputies' bill, Klaus said. That the government bill did not 
provide for the return of other property than that in the 
state's possession was one of the main differences. "It is 
impossible for restitution to concern property already 
privatized and property in the possession of municipalities," 
Klaus said. 
  He added that the government favored the idea of paying 
financial compensation to Jewish people from the state budget 
for the property which ought to be returned and which was not in 
the state's possession. 
  Another difference was that the government bill considered 
only initial owners of property or their legitimate heirs to be 
eligible for restitution. According to the government bill, 
only property which was claimed before February 25, 1948 -- the 
communist takeover -- and which was not returned to its initial 
owners due to political changes would be restituted, Klaus said. 
  He said that restitution would concern only people 
persecuted 
for racial reasons and not all the people whom the post-war 
decrees of Czechoslovak President Edvard Benes concerned, for 
example those people who suffered for political reasons in the 
period from 1938 to 1945. 
  The government did not believe that the land law should be 
amended to ensure the restitution of property to Jewish people, 
as the deputies' bill defined, Klaus said. He told journalists 
that the government's negative stand on the deputies' bill was 
sent to Parliament today.

  [Text] Prague, April 13 (CTK) -- The parties of the 
coalition government disagree on the powers the bodies of the 
higher local administrative units should have, Premier Vaclav 
Klaus told journalists today. 
  The government therefore decided to limit the bill on the 
competence of the higher administrative units to their powers. 
He said while there were not significant differences of opinion 
between the coalition partners on the matter of the competence 
of the higher administrative units, there were "fundamental 
discrepancies" between them concerning the competence of the 
bodies of these units. 
  The government was concerned that the powers of higher 
administrative units might expand in the future, he said. "It 
would be naive to assume that competence can be determined once 
and for all time, since higher units are living organisms," he 
said. 
  Klaus said the government would debate the narrowed down 
bill 
on the constitutional law on April 27 and submit the definitive 
form of the bill to parliament on April 30.

  [Text] Prague, April 13 (CTK) -- The Parliamentary 
Committee for Petitions, Human Rights and Nationalities today 
rejected two deputy-proposed bills on Czech radio and 
television. Most opposition deputies -- who form the majority 
in the committee -- rejected the proposals, while the coalition 
deputies were for them. 
  The committee members' report concentrated on the 
nine-member 
Czech Television Council, an organ supposed to guarantee the 
public's right to control the making and broadcasting of Czech 
Television's programmes. 
  The proposals were put forward by deputies of the Christian 
Democratic Party (KDS) and the Liberal National Social Party 
(LSNS).

  [Text] Prague, April 13 (CTK) -- The State Office for 
Atomic Safety (SUJB) is not ruling out a new round of talks on 
construction authorization for the Temelin nuclear power plant 
in south Bohemia, because it does not expect the necessary 
documents on a new security system to arrive in time, MLADA 
FRONTA DNES writes today. 
  Karel Bohm from the SUJB told the paper that unless the 
Czech 
Energy Utility (CEZ) submitted documents on the effect of 
Westinghouse technology on nuclear safety, the SUJB would not 
permit the installation of the safety equipment. The 
construction project envisages the installation to be realized 
in mid-1994. 
  "CEZ will probably not be capable of submitting the document 
in an acceptable form in time," Bohm says. 
  He said that Russian-type safety equipment should be used 
for 
the Russian-type reactors in Temelin, and that the 
reconsideration of Temelin construction can be initiated only by 
the local district administration in Ceske Budejovice if the 
Westinghouse equipment application would substantially change 
the original project, Bohm says. 
  Westinghouse has been chosen to replace the Russian 
technology in an effort to raise the plant's safety. 
  Construction at Temelin started in 1986 but later was 
suspended. In March 1993 the Czech Government gave its final 
approval to the project, which has met with strong criticism 
from some officials and environmentalists both at home and in 
neighboring Austria, which is strongly anti-nuclear. 
  The first Temelin reactor is to be operating at full 
capacity 
by mid-1995 and the second in 1996. The completed plant is 
expected to generate 2,000 MW. 
  Czech Environment Minister Frantisek Benda has also 
mentioned 
the possibility of reconsidering the Temelin project. On Monday 
[11 April] he warned he would not allow the plant to go into 
operation unless the planned "nuclear law" was adopted. The law 
is to define the responsibilities of the plant's operator and 
deal with ways of storing burnt-out fuel. 
  Benda's criticism of Temelin led Austrian Chancellor Franz 
Vranitzky to note yesterday that debate about bringing the plant 
into operation was far from over even in the Czech Republic. 
  Once again he repeated Austria's offer to cooperate with 
Prague in the development of alternative power sources.

  [Text] Budapest, 13 Apr (MTI) -- The Hungarian Foreign 
Ministry has not received any new proposals from Romania on the 
debated issues of the Hungarian-Romanian basic treaty, foreign 
affairs spokesman Janos Herman told MTI today, challenging a 
press statement from his Romanian colleague, Mircea Geoana. In 
the statement, Geoana mentioned Romania's recent efforts to 
advance bilateral talks on the issue. 
  Herman agreed that a treaty is in the interest of both 
sides, 
but declined to predict any deadlines for reaching an agreement. 
  Romanian senior officials had said that they expected an 
agreement on the debated issues, i.e. on the inviolability of 
borders and the question of minorities, before June 1. 
  The Hungarian spokesman said there had been certain hints in 
the statement suggesting that the elaboration of the treaty 
could be based on formulas given by NATO, the U.S. and some 
Western European countries. 
  Herman said that while the Hungarian side had not received 
any such formulas relating to the treaty, Hungary has, in a 
broader sense, accepted suggestions from NATO and the U.S., for 
instance, by signing the Partnership for Peace agreement.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 13 (CTK) -- "Jozef Moravcik has 
no moral right to be the Slovak premier and I therefore call on 
him to resign from his office," Tibor Cabaj, chairman of the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) Deputies' Group, said 
today at parliamentary debate on the programme of the new Slovak 
Government. 
  Cabaj said that Moravcik had harmed and dishonored the 
Slovak 
Republic, pointing to a report worked out by the Slovak Foreign 
Ministry when headed by Moravcik before Slovak President Michal 
Kovac's visit to the Vatican last year. 
  The Vatican's state system was characterized in the report 
as 
a "theocratic and absolutist monarchy headed by the pope," Cabaj 
said. He said that the document also pointed to the Vatican's 
cooperation with the fascist states in the 30's. Cabaj 
described as scandalous the passage in the report saying that 
"under the pontification of John Paul II the Vatican has been 
evidently seeking to propagate the concept of Christian Europe 
and the Christian Pan-Slavism." According to the report the 
Vatican is aiming at "strengthening positions of power and the 
ideological influence of the Roman Catholic Church and is 
propagating the concept of Christian Europe, ideological and 
subversive activity and the clerical coalition with the United 
States and other NATO states," Cabaj said.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 13 (CTK) -- The Slovak Parliament 
today approved the programme of Premier Jozef Moravcik's 
government, with 80 out of the 119 deputies present voting in 
favour. 
  "For the government such discussions are a test of how 
various groups of the population react to its proposals," 
Moravcik said, commenting on the parliamentary debate. "However 
I must say that the objective criticisms to the government 
program, although there were not many of them, will help us 
further improve it," he added. 
  Regarding the accusations voiced during the debate that the 
new cabinet had simply rewritten the program of the previous 
government, Moravcik said that the fundamental macro-economic 
goals stemmed from the approved law on the state budget and that 
his cabinet did not want to interfere with the law. 
  "However, analysis of developments did not testify to the 
possibility that all the goals put up by the former cabinet 
could have been fulfilled. We will therefore seek 
implementation of the basic macro-economic goals," Moravcik 
added. 
  Moravcik was reacting to an accusation by Tibor Cabaj, 
chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) 
deputies' group, who called on Moravcik to resign from his 
office. The reason Cabaj gave was a report submitted by the 
Foreign Ministry headed by Moravcik in May 1993 before Slovak 
President Michal Kovac's visit to the Vatican. There were 
passages in the report reminiscent of assessments of the Vatican 
common before the November 1989 revolution. 
  Moravcik said that Cabaj had merely quoted working material. 
The part which he criticized was an archive document which 
appeared in the report by mistake. "As soon as the mistake was 
discovered we put it right and the people responsible were taken 
to task. What was read out by Cabaj had never been an official 
document of the Foreign Ministry," Moravcik said. 
  In his closing speech before the vote of confidence in the 
government was taken Moravcik said that his cabinet would aim at 
speeding up the process of transformation in the economic and 
social spheres, creating favorable conditions for investors and 
stopping the collapse of health care and education. 
  The government intended to restore citizens' trust in the 
state, improve their security and prepare early parliamentary 
elections, Moravcik said.

  [Text] Prague/Bratislava, April 13 (CTK) -- "If in the 
future Vladimir Meciar ever headed the Slovak government I would 
consider it dangerous for Slovakia," Slovak President Michal 
Kovac said on Czech television this evening. 
  If the man ousted from the Slovak premiership by a March 
no-confidence vote were to become premier again, it "would only 
serve to strengthen Meciar's exceptional, almost superhuman 
abilities," Kovac said in an interview on the programme "21". 
  Meciar's style, methods and means had threatened Slovakia's 
interests. He had not managed to solve economic problems which 
in normal circumstances could have been solved, Kovac said. 
  "We were aware citizens were losing faith in politics and 
public servants, people's dissatisfaction was growing and ideas 
were entering their heads of the need for a strong hand and an 
authoritarian regime -- ideas far from the democratic style of 
government," he said. 
  Most of the original supporters of Meciar's party, the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), and many members of 
parliament had realized the danger and harmfulness of Meciar's 
ways, Kovac said.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 13 (CTK) -- Slovak President 
Michal Kovac, in an interview with CTK today on the forthcoming 
meeting of seven Central European presidents in the east 
Bohemian town of Litomysl, pointed to its importance for the 
future of the Central European region and the prospects of the 
region's integration with the European Union (EU). 
  "I am expecting that the meeting will contribute to 
strengthening mutual trust and creating an appropriate 
atmosphere needed to enhance and expand the zone of peace, 
security, stability and prosperity," Kovac said. 
  He pointed to the mutual interest of Central European states 
to join the European democratic economic and security 
structures, to carry through the transformation of their economy 
to a market mechanism and to carry out other economic, political 
and social reforms. 
  "Unlike other states of the Visegrad group (the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland), after the fall of the 
totalitarian regime, Slovakia had to solve much more complicated 
problems linked to the appearance of an independent state. In a 
short period of time we had to introduce all constitutional 
functions, to establish the central state administrative bodies 
and to transfer to an independent economic and banking system. 
And all this had to be done while implementing economic reform 
and fighting hyper-inflation and the excessive growth of 
unemployment. We have managed to handle these problems 
comparatively successfully; various catastrophic scenarios which 
predicted the collapse for the Slovak Republic have not come 
true," Kovac said. 
  Kovac confirmed Slovakia's interest in developing relations 
with the Czech Republic and especially in preserving the Customs 
Union and in creating the conditions which would not hinder 
mutual cooperation. 
  "In broader interconnections our cooperation and the ability 
of mutual communication is also important as regards the 
interests of the whole Central European region. I firmly 
believe that the process of our integration into the EU will 
depend on the level of our cooperation within the Visegrad 
group. The Partnership for Peace programme obliterates the 
differences between Central European and East European countries 
and our cooperation is thus acquiring, in its final meaning, not 
only economical but also political and security dimensions," 
Kovac said. 
  He pointed out that also after the division of the former 
Czechoslovak Federation its two successive states - the Czech 
and Slovak republics were united by similar interest of 
completing their transformation and integrating into the 
European structures. "This is a basic pre-condition from which 
our relations will ensue also in the future. The feeling of 
alienation or drifting apart is a temporary one and we will 
certainly overcome it," Kovac stressed.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 13 (CTK) -- Slovakia would like to 
hold an ongoing matter-of-fact dialogue with Hungary in peaceful 
and level-headed atmosphere, new Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard 
Kukan said on Slovak Television last night. 
  In response to recent statements by Hungarian Premier Peter 
Boross that he considered himself the spiritual premier of even 
those Hungarians living outside the state's borders, Kukan 
pointed out that elections are looming in Hungary and all means 
are being employed to win votes. 
  "I understand that to mean that he has in mind some kind of 
spiritual leadership. As far as I know, in the same speech he 
also said that Hungary respected its current borders. And from 
our point of view, that is decisive," Kukan said. 
  The recently deposed government of Vladimir Meciar reacted 
to 
similar statements by Boross' deceased predecessor, Jozsef 
Antall, with an anxiety that led it to challenge the loyalty of 
the approximately 600,000 ethnic Hungarians living in Slovakia, 
and to charge Hungarian leaders with irredentism, which 
contributed to a worsening of relations between Budapest and 
Bratislava. 
  "For the normal development of good neighborly relations 
with 
Hungary, inviolability of the border is the basic question from 
which stems everything else," Kukan said, adding that this 
question can be answered once and for all if Budapest displays 
in its "willingness to discuss and to leave doors open" the same 
accommodating spirit as Bratislava. 
  "If we can solve the question of the inviolability of the 
border in a way that satisfies Slovak interests, our relations 
with our Hungarian neighbors can develop normally," Kukan said.

  [Text] Prague, April 13 (CTK) -- The original version of 
Balladur's security plan for Europe included clauses 
unacceptable to Slovakia, Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan says in 
an interview with the Czech left-leaning daily RUDE PRAVO today. 
  Slovakia cannot accept the linkage of border issues with the 
situation of ethnic minorities, he adds. 
  However, the idea of Balladur's plan has evolved and the 
text 
is still being discussed, says Kukan. "I think the authors of 
the plan have adopted some of our positions," he states. 
  The new cabinet has been harshly criticised by Meciar's 
opposition for its allegedly too accommodating approach to the 
Czech Republic, says Kukan. "Just slamming the door in case of 
some discord is very easy," he comments on this. 
  "In the election campaign there will certainly emerge 
politicians who try to play the tune that we are yielding to 
Prague," he states. 
  Kukan says he does not cherish any illusion that 
Slovak-Hungarian problems will be resolved quickly. However, we 
have proposed talks on the readmission agreement and a temporary 
water regime for the Danube River, as well as other issues to 
Budapest, he adds. 
  Asked what Americans think about Slovakia, Kukan, former 
Slovak Ambassador to the United Nations, says that ordinary 
Americans do not know much about the country. When some of them 
planned to travel to Slovakia, they asked us about security in 
the country. Lots of them still mistake us for the former 
Yugoslavia, explains Kukan.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 13 (CTK) -- A meeting between the 
Slovak and Hungarian environment ministers which included 
discussion of the Gabcikovo hydroelectric project ended without 
concrete results today. 
  On the controversial subject of the division of the Danube 
waters, Slovak Environment Minister Juraj Hrasko said he and his 
Hungarian counterpart Janos Gyurko had agreed to recommend that 
their governments prepare themselves to discuss the approval of 
a political decision. 
  "We did not bind ourselves to any conclusions. However, we 
both said the tone of the meeting was much friendlier than in 
the past," Hrasko said, adding that he was ready to continue 
negotiations with the aim of improving the state of the drying 
out branches of the Danube. 
  Hrasko confirmed that in the dispute over the dividing of 
the 
Danube waters between the old river course and the Gabcikovo 
canal he had proposed negotiations without the participation of 
experts from the European Union (EU), but declined to give 
further details. 
  Gyurko, however, rejected the offer of bilateral 
negotiations, thus sticking to Hungary's demand that talks take 
place with the participation of EU experts. However, he 
appreciated the change for the better in the atmosphere of the 
negotiations. If the Slovaks were to send more water into the 
old course than before -- and this would mean a fall in the 
output of electricity from Gabcikovo -- the Hungarians would 
support any request made of Slovakia by a third party for 
compensation for these losses. 
  "We were assured that no standpoint from the Hungarian 
Parliament or Government had to be definitive in the search for 
an agreement," said Hrasko, who used to be chairman of the 
parliamentary committee for Gabcikovo. 
  "A mare is never sold at a market for the asking price, but 
nor is the first offer paid," he added. 
  The compromise proposal by Western experts on the division 
of 
the Danube waters was approved conditionally by Hungary, but 
Slovakia rejected it. However, the Hungarian Parliament then 
went against the recommendations of both the experts and its own 
government, and decided that the drying out branch of the Danube 
would be supplied with water by pumps, not by the building of a 
dam. 
  Nonetheless, Hungary recently invited Slovakia to resume 
talks forthwith, to which Slovakia replied that it was still 
prepared to negotiate. 
  Hrasko said today's talks also concerned broader issues of 
cooperation in environmental protection and improving the 
quality of contacts between the two countries. Concretely, they 
discussed the creation of a joint national park on the border 
area and an agreement on a common approach to the pollution of 
waters.
