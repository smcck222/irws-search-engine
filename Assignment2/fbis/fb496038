<F P=106> [Report by Maria Elsa Suarez from the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The government has held a nine-hour meeting to 
discuss the significance of the signing of the ESAF [Enhanced 
Structural Adjustment Facility] Agreement with the IMF. This 
meeting was attended by 58 delegations from across the nation 
and included representatives from unions, Army, police, 
political parties, producers, businessmen, mayors, and media 
directors. 
  At the beginning of the meeting, President Chamorro called 
for a moment of silence for the recent assassinations of Javier 
Barahona in Wiwili and Donaldo Colosio in Mexico. Chamorro later 
asserted that stability will lead to the country's growth. She 
also welcomed the recent visit by the IMF director and the 
International Development Bank president, who granted additional 
resources to support production. In addition to this, she 
underscored the importance of signing the ESAF Agreement. 
  [Begin Chamorro recording] This agreement will enable us to 
obtain additional resources that are unavailable to other 
countries that have not complied with the economic plans and 
commitments assumed with the international financial 
institutions [IFI's]. Today, I have asked cabinet members to 
brief you on the progress made in our negotiations with the 
IFI's so that we can have your valuable contributions and 
recommendations. [end recording] 
  During this meeting, all sectors presented their positions 
regarding the ESAF accord. The president of the Central Bank 
and the minister of finance presented a detailed report on the 
current situation and ESAF conditions. 
  [Begin Central Bank President Jose Taboada recording] The 
reforms now being negotiated with the IFI's have been discussed 
extensively, and, as a result of successive negotiations, some 
conditions or aspects that were considered vital during the 
initial negotiations have been overcome. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Ibeth Vega G.] </F>
  [Text] Panamanian Public Force, with the aid of the U.S. 
military and in coordination with Colombian authorities, have 
destroyed at least 10 coca fields in Darien Province and 
detained an undisclosed number of people. Operation Tornado, 
directed by Major Santiago Fundora of the National Air Service 
(SAN), was confirmed to LA PRENSA by President Guillermo Endara 
himself, who thanked the newspaper for not reporting on the 
operation before its completion, even though the newspaper had 
received all of the information well ahead of time. 
  Operation Tornado was launched Saturday morning when three 
teams -- one from the SAN, one from the National Police, and one 
from the Institutional Protection Service (SPI) -- flew to 
Darien aboard several SAN helicopters to destroy the coca 
fields, whose acreage was not disclosed. The groups also 
destroyed coca-processing labs in the region along the border 
with Colombia. 
  On 27 March, Fundora reported that the operation had been "a 
complete success" to Endara because at least 10 coca fields had 
been destroyed. Endara said the Panamanian authorities also set 
fire to several huts presumed to be small coca-processing labs. 
He also confirmed that several people were caught and handed 
over to the proper authorities. 
  One source, who asked to remain anonymous, said Operation 
Tornado was carried out quickly and without any clashes. Those 
arrested were taken by surprise in the afternoon and evening of 
last Saturday. The operation was nearly complete yesterday, 
Sunday morning, although several coca fields, allegedly planted 
by Colombians, had yet to be destroyed. 
  The source said Panamanian and Colombian authorities took 
part in the operation, along with the U.S. Government's 
logistical support through the U.S. Embassy in Panama. The 
source also told LA PRENSA that the authorities are looking for 
a hacienda worth several millions of dollars located somewhere 
in the Darien jungle. Endara said: "I have been told that the 
operation was a complete success. The second stage consists of 
burning other fields that were found." 
  Members of the special teams that participated in Operation 
Tornado are still in Darien. They are expected to begin 
returning to Panama City today provided no trouble arises with 
guerrillas in the Palle area who have threatened to shoot down 
Public Force planes and helicopters. Endara did not reveal the 
size or exact location of the coca fields destroyed or the 
number of police who took part in the operation. An official 
report is expected to be released today, however. 
  Panamanian and Colombian security forces have been carrying 
out a coordinated work against drug trafficking and to heighten 
border security to prevent a number of crimes perpetrated in and 
around the jungle. This type of work started to be carried out 
in the framework of good-neighbor commissions that Presidents 
Endara and Cesar Gaviria installed last year. As part of the 
effort, a number of Pamamanian agents have received police 
training in Colombia. 
  In addition to fighting drug trafficking, the two countries 
have been implementing a process of rapprochement and 
cooperation on energy, trade, culture, and agriculture and 
livestock, according to official reports of the two governments.

<F P=106> [Report by Vilma E. Figueroa] </F>
  [Text] Narcotics Division Chief Ramiro Yarvis of the 
Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) has said "clandestine ports" all 
across the country are being used by drug traffickers to smuggle 
drugs. Yarvis indicated that Darien Province, currently the site 
of an operation to destroy coca plantations, is just one of the 
areas in which drug traffickers harvest the drug. He added that 
Colombian guerrillas protect the coca plantations in Darien, 
where hostile and remote terrain makes entering the jungle 
difficult. He admitted that other drug laboratories in Darien 
may not have been destroyed. Yarvis said the technical and 
personnel resources available to state security agencies, the 
PTJ, National Air Service, and the National Maritime Service are 
virtually incapable of combating this problem. "There is a huge 
number of clandestine ports being used to smuggle drugs," he 
noted. 
  Former National Customs Director Rodrigo Arosemena told 
reporters that a bill to authorize the destruction of drugs 24 
hours after they are seized is necessary to stop drug 
traffickers who are flooding the country with drugs.

  [Text] Free trade agreements are not new to Panama's 
commercial relations. The country has been maintaining such 
agreements with Central America since the 1970's. Panama has 
bilateral preferential commercial agreements with Costa Rica, El 
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. This kind of 
contract, however, is not limited to the region. Panama has also 
signed treaties with members of the Latin American Integration 
Association (Aladi), specifically Mexico and Colombia. In 
addition, the government is forwarding talks in that direction 
with Ecuador and Venezuela. 
  Carlos Castaneda, director of the Panamanian Foreign Trade 
Institute (IPCE), has told EL PANAMA AMERICA "all these 
agreements are directed at increasing and strengthening 
commercial relations between contracting parties." The official 
said that "with such agreements, Panama has achieved a sustained 
increase in its trade relations with Central America." 
Statistics indicate a total of approximately $100 million in 
overall commercial activities between Panama and Central 
America. The official said this result benefits the business 
sector and, consequently, the country's economic policy. The 
figures show 62 percent of that amount represents imports from 
Central America into Panama, which suggests a trade balance 
deficit for the country. 
  The IPCE director argued Panama is an importing country, 
given its service-oriented economy. He added overall trade 
figures for Panama and the rest of the world total $2 billion, 
1.5 billion of which are imports. Costa Rica is Panama's major 
economic partner with 56.3 percent of the total. Guatemala (21 
percent), El Salvador (13.8 percent), Honduras (5.8 percent), 
and Nicaragua (2.3 percent) follow in order of importance. 
  Under these commercial contracts, Panama has exported 
$37.4-million worth of goods, of which $21.7 million are the 
product of negotiations with Costa Rica. According to official 
figures, Costa Rica sold Panama more than $47 million last year, 
while it purchased $35 million. 
  The main products Panama exports via these preferential and 
free trade agreements are medicines, condensed milk, spices and 
condiments, tomato-based products, mayonnaise, cheese, 
cosmetics, packaged tea, shrimp, and aluminum containers. Panama 
receives mostly chemicals, fertilizers, and batteries from 
Central America. 
  Regarding trade relations with Mexico and Colombia, 
Castaneda 
said Panama has signed several partial preference agreements. 
Concerning Mexico, import tax preferences are unilateral and 
nonreciprocal in Panama's favor, meaning 110 products entering 
Mexico under the agreement receive partial tax exemptions, but 
Panama is not obligated to grant these same privileges. 
  Trade with Colombia, based on a recent agreement signed in 
July 1993 and pending approval at the National Assembly, 
includes 10 products yet to be negotiated. It is expected the 
agreement will lead to higher levels than with Central America, 
due to the development and size of the Colombian market, with 
its more than 40 million inhabitants.

<F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Harmodio Arias, deputy commerce and industries 
minister, has referred to the banana situation, saying that 
economic interests and not Latin American unity seem to prevail 
on this issue and that Costa Rica had not reciprocated Panama's 
actions in the banana business. Colombia's and Costa Rica's 
decision to negotiate, on their own, a banana agreement with the 
European Union negatively affects Latin American unity and 
directly harms Panama, Harmodio Arias has said. 
  [Begin Arias recording] I believe this shows there is no 
Latin American unity. With Costa Rica, we have respected our 
promise to vote for Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus 
[at the OAS elections], but they have broken our unity on the 
banana issue. [end recording] 
  Arias said Colombia and Costa Rica want to get the best part 
of the banana business with Europe without caring about the rest 
of the region, and this cannot be. 
  [Begin recording] [Arias] We cannot accept a quota for each 
country; this goes against everything that deals with free 
trade. It is not possible for several European gentlemen to be 
the ones to decide Panama only has the right to export 19 
percent of bananas consumed by the European Economic Community. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What does this 19 percent represent 
regarding our interests, farms, and workers? How much will this 
hurt us? 
  [Arias] Crumbs. We are left with crumbs. Panama exports 70 
percent of its banana production to Europe; thus, we have been 
left with only crumbs. [end recording] 
  Arias was emphatic when he said the other banana-producing 
countries will not allow unilateral agreements with the European 
Union and will negotiate as a block to obtain added economic 
advantages.

  [Text] Brasilia, 30 Mar (EFE) -- Official sources reported 
here today that the Brazilian Government has ordered an increase 
in import duties for wheat over a period of four and a half 
months. The sources added, however, that Argentina -- Brazil's 
main trade partner in the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) 
-- will not be affected by the increase. 
  The wheat surcharge -- which ranges from 10 to 17 percent -- 
will be enforced from 15 September 1994 to 31 January 1995, the 
period for marketing Brazilian wheat. The measure will 
particularly affect U.S., Canadian, and German wheat. 
  An Agriculture Ministry spokesman told EFE that the decision 
is designed to expand trade with Argentina and to promote 
Brazilian wheat production. 
  Agriculture Minister Sinval Guazelli is also studying a 
proposal to impose a surcharge on grounds of unfair competition 
on any wheat purchased by Brazilian mills from countries that 
are subsidizing agricultural production. 
  The proposal, which is part of a package that would go into 
effect until 1997, seeks to make the surcharge match the value 
of the subsidies granted by the producing country. 
  In light of the process of eliminating customs duties within 
Mercosur, under which member countries are entitled to an 82 
percent tax reduction, the import duties to be paid on Argentine 
wheat sold to Brazil amounts to 1.8 percent. 
  Additionally, a bilateral agreement guarantees the annual 
purchase by Brazil of 2 million tonnes of Argentine wheat. 
Actual purchases have, however, often been higher than this 
minimum figure. 
  In 1994, Argentina will export between 3 and 3.5 million 
tonnes of wheat to Brazil, but the Brazilian imports will total 
some 5.5 million tonnes. 
  Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has described the 
purchase of Argentine wheat as a "strategic" decision linked to 
integration within Mercosur and has said that Brazilian mills 
have acknowledged the advantages of purchasing Argentine wheat 
because of the low import duties and lower freight costs 
involved. 
  The Argentine Government has expressed its displeasure over 
the U.S. offer to sell 500,000 tonnes of wheat to Brazil at 
subsidized prices. 
  According to official sources in Brasilia, a U.S. Government 
delegation has made the offer to Brazilian officials. 
  Argentine-Brazilian trade, which has markedly increased 
since 
1990, is negative for Argentina, whose deficit in 1993 amounted 
to $1,074,200,000. 
  According to the Brazilian Foreign Trade Secretariat, in 
1993 
Brazilian sales to Argentina totaled $3.7 billion, while its 
imports from Argentina totaled $2,625,700,000.

  [Excerpts] On 31 March, nine years after the murder of 
three communist teachers -- Jose Manuel Parada, Manuel Guerrero, 
and Santiago Nattino -- Judge Milton Juica sentenced 17 former 
Carabineros members and a civilian. Three of the former 
Carabineros were sentenced to life in prison. The judge also 
determined that high-ranking Carabineros officers, including the 
institution's director, General Rodolfo Stange, and former 
General Cesar Mendoza, must be tried by the Military Courts for 
failing to carry out their duties. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] There was an 
atmosphere of great tension early this morning at the seat of 
the Sixth Criminal Court, where it was known that today Judge 
Milton Juica would make known his sentence. 
  Just after noon, those involved in the triple murder arrived 
at the courthouse to receive their sentences. Alejandro Saez 
Mardones, sentenced to life imprisonment, was the first to 
arrive. The former military policeman entered the courthouse 
amidst the shouts of demonstrators from human rights 
organizations. 
  Similar incidents occurred with the arrival of Colonel 
Guillermo Gonzalez Betrancourt, retired, who has also been 
sentenced to life imprisonment. 
  Former Carabineros Captain Patricio Zamora Rodriguez, also 
sentenced to life imprisonment, was the last to arrive. 
[passage omitted] 
  The most serious incidents took place with the arrival of 
Miguel Estay Reyno, alias El Fanta, the only civilian involved 
in the murders, who was tried under the charges of kidnapping 
and murder. Estay Reyno was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment. 
Jose Fuentes Castro received the same sentence. Claudio 
Zalazar Fuentes was sentenced to 15 years in prison. 
  These six people were accused of terrorist-style kidnapping 
and of triple murder. [passage omitted] [end recording]

safe and sound. Rissen is the security chief at the Summer 
Linguistic Institute in Loma Linda, Meta Department. General 
Luis Bernardo Urbina Sanchez, commander of the Army's 7th 
Brigade, has commented on this kidnapping and other issues for 
Radio Caracol. 
  [Begin Urbina recording] He was riding a motorcycle along 
the 
highway between the municipal capital of Puerto Lleras and Loma 
Linda, where the Summer Linguistic Institute operates. During 
the trip he was intercepted by individuals we believe are--or we 
are certain are--members of the 43d Front of the FARC 
[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]. They violently took 
him away. We had certain information about where they initially 
took him, but we learned later they had moved. We have been 
unable to recontact them. [end recording] 
  Urbina also said there is no information on the whereabouts 
of the two U.S. missionaries Steve Welch and Timothy Vandyck, 
whom FARC guerrillas also kidnapped in the hamlet of San Jose, 
near Villavicencio, on 16 January.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 3 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Delegates of 
the Socialist Renewal Movement (CRS) signed today the peace 
agreement achieved with the government of President Cesar 
Gaviria, which will lead to the demobilization of 300 rebels on 
9 April. The rebels at the conference, which was held at the 
rebel camp in Flor del Monte, some 1,300 km north of Santa Fe de 
Bogota, stuck to their request for a seat in the Senate once the 
organization turns over its weapons. 
  The CRS, a dissident faction of the National Liberation Army 
(ELN), signed a political agreement with the Colombian 
Government last week. The agreement signed between the 
guerrillas [words indistinct] and the Colombian Government 
includes the government's pledge to grant sufficient resources 
for the incorporation of the CRS into the country's democratic 
life and guaranteeing two seats in the Chamber of Deputies for 
the rebel group. 
  The CRS summit, which began on 31 March and concluded today, 
welcomed the proposal of Jacinto Ruiz and Gabriel Borja -- its 
negotiators -- to vote blank on 29 May, the date of the 
presidential elections in Colombia. After rejecting the 
candidacy of Antonio Navarro Wolf as an alternative, the CRS 
plenum announced that it will promote a political movement "with 
a high degree of internal democracy that will set us apart from 
the bipartite tradition that has dominated this nation." 
  According to a CRS spokesperson, participants in the summit 
included at least 140 CRS delegates as well as followers of the 
legally constituted left wing, leaders of unions, and peasant 
organizations that are interested in the new political project. 
  Presidential Adviser Carlos Eduardo Jaramillo approved the 
signing of the agreement and [word indistinct] toward the 
consolidation of peace in Colombia.

  [Text] The investigation into the suicide of Private 
Leonardo Castro has led to the removal of Colonel Carlos Pinzon, 
commandant of the Presidential Guard Battalion. 
  [Begin General Norberto Adrada, Army 13th Brigade commander, 
recording] We have decided to relieve the colonel to allow a 
smoother investigation, without any kind of obstacle. 
Lieutenant Lozano was also moved, primarily to make the 
investigation process a little easier. [end recording] 
  For the same reasons, Pinzon was not present for today's 
change of command ceremonies. His future in the army is being 
questioned. 
  [Begin Adrada recording] That is a decision the commander of 
the Army must make. It is something we are evaluating, as you 
know, because the investigations are continuing. The Army 
commander will make the final decision. [end recording] 
  Regarding Ricardo Lozano, the 13th Brigade commander simply 
said he had been transferred to a position similar to the one he 
held when the tragic events occurred. The new commander of the 
Presidential Guard is Colonel Jose Domingo Rubio, former 
commander of the Military School.

  [Text] The Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces suggested 
yesterday that Colombia join Protocol II of the Geneva 
Convention of 1949, a multilateral agreement that contains the 
international human rights principles that cannot be violated 
during armed conflicts. The protocol bans terrorism as a form of 
armed struggle, inhumane and collective punishments, torture, 
the taking of hostages, and, especially, attacks on the civilian 
population, church representatives, and medical missions, among 
others. 
  The Cesar Gaviria government decided to submit to Congress a 
bill to include Protocol II in Colombian legislation after 
deeming that the agreement does not adversely affect the 
country's sovereignty, nor undermine the operational 
capabilities of the Public Force in the fight against armed 
rebels. 
  Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda and General Ramon Emilio 
Gil, commander of the Armed Forces, sent a letter to President 
Cesar Gaviria yesterday saying it was "advisable" for Colombia 
to join the Protocol II. The defense minister said adherence to 
Protocol II "would not imply the recognition of the guerrilla 
groups as a belligerent force." 
  The government's adherence to what has been stipulated in 
the 
aforementioned protocol is, in practice, Colombia's 
demonstration to the international community that in the country 
the rights of the participants in the armed conflict are 
respected, which means that international human rights norms are 
respected. 
  Protocol II supplements Article 3 of the Geneva Convention, 
which refers to the protection of persons who are victims or who 
are adversely affected by the conflict. This agreement 
regulates the treatment given to persons not involved in the 
conflict or those who have intervened in the conflict but are no 
longer capable of participating in it. 
  Protocol II, in addition to prohibiting the taking of 
hostages, homicides, torture, practices such as slavery, 
terrorism, pillage, and collective punishments, also calls for 
the protection of persons who have been stripped of their 
freedom. 
  In the case of a noninternational conflict that is taking 
place on the territory of a high contracting party (the state, 
in this case Colombia), Protocol II is applied as long as the 
rebels are carrying out their actions under a responsible 
command and are exercising control over part of the territory 
that can allow them to conduct sustained military operations. 
If these conditions (as in the case of Colombia) are not 
fulfilled, the guerrillas may not apply the protocol rules. 
  In this regard, in the letter sent to President Gaviria, 
Pardo and Gil pointed out that the country's adherence to 
Protocol II "would not imply recognition of the guerrilla groups 
as a belligerent force because adherence only implies a 
commitment by the state or the high contracting party. Besides, 
it is clear that the illegal armed groups are not subject to 
international law." 
  The text of Pardo and Gil's letter sent to the president 
follows: 
  Mr. President: At the direction of the Armed Forces General 
Command, the Joint Staff has conducted a study of the main 
recommendations that have been made regarding the advisability 
of adhering to Protocol II of the Geneva Convention of 1949. 
  The arguments in favor and against have been reviewed, the 
results of which are contained in an attached document. In 
general, we have found that adherence to the aforementioned 
protocol would not imply recognition of the guerrilla groups as 
a belligerent force because adherence only implies a commitment 
by the state or the high contracting party. Besides, it is 
clear that the illegal armed groups are not subject to 
international law. 
  We may conclude, therefore, that the aforementioned 
organizations will not have the go ahead to freely conduct 
gun-running activities or to have diplomatic representation 
abroad; in no case will the members of the aforementioned 
organizations, who may be captured, receive prisoner of war 
status and they must surrender to the justice system as it is 
now done. 
  Seen in light of international law and other such 
protocols, particularly Article 3 of Protocol II, it is clear 
that national sovereignty will be respected at all times: To 
the letter, Article 3 of Protocol II states: "No provision of 
this protocol may be cited to undermine the sovereignty of a 
state or to defend the national unity and territorial safety of 
a state by all legal means." [sentence as published] Therefore, 
the state's ability to repress and control subversion will not 
be reduced at all. 
  The Armed Forces are in compliance with those provisions of 
International Humanitarian Law that are included in Protocol II 
in question. The laws and regulations that govern the Armed 
Forces meet the requirements set forth in said Protocol II. 
Hence, its application will not imply any degree of limitation 
or diminishment of the Public Force's operational capability. 
  Furthermore, as established by No. 2 of Article 214 of the 
Constitution, the provisions of International Humanitarian Law 
will be abided by during a state of emergency. This obviously 
includes those cited in Protocol II. These provisions, then, 
were in effect during the State of Internal Disturbance, from 8 
November, 1992, to 4 August, 1993. 
  Upon the conclusion of said state, this Ministry felt that 
the Armed Forces should continue to abide strictly by these same 
rules and issued Defense Ministry Directive No. 017 of August 
1993. In so doing, the Ministry issued permanent orders and 
instructions to all members of the Armed Forces, regarding the 
respect for and adherence to Human Rights and International 
Humanitarian Law. The directive also provides for training 
personnel in these areas, which are the same areas invoked by 
Protocol II. 
  Last, the attached document includes several 
recommendations, 
based mainly on the following two aspects: 1) The need to adopt 
the necessary legal measures to penalize serious violations -- 
yet to be defined -- of the regulations listed in Article 3, 
which are common to the Geneva Convention and Protocol II; and 
2) The need for prior study of any reservations presented by 
other states regarding the provisions of Protocol II, as an 
important elements in analyzing the new instrument. 
  As stated in this note and in the attached documents, 
therefore, we believe it would be beneficial to present this 
Protocol II of the 1949 Geneva Convention to the Honorable 
Senate for discussion during the current congressional session. 
  Signed: Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda and General 
Ramon Emilio Gil Bermudez, the commanding general of the Armed 
Forces.

<F P=106> [Report by Diego Hernan Canal; from the "NTC News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Colombian drug authorities are very concerned 
because, apparently, Peru's successful struggle against the 
people who traffic in drugs in that country has resulted in a 
significant increase in coca growing in Colombia. Authorities 
have confirmed that Bolivian and Peruvian coca crops are being 
moved to Colombia and that the number of coca plantations has 
increased 100 percent in the past four years. This prompts a 
new and distressing situation in our country. 
  [Begin Colombian Drug Director Gabriel De Vega recording] We 
are becoming a country that produces coca and are very close to 
supplanting Bolivia for second place, after Peru, as a 
coca-producing country. [end recording] 
  The situation is developing as a result of Peru's struggle 
against the aircraft that transport coca base from that country 
to Colombia to be processed into cocaine. The large number of 
planes downed by the Peruvians has caused pilots involved in 
drug trafficking to decide to leave the business or to charge 
too much. 
  [Begin De Vega recording] Confronted with this situation, 
for 
example, they prefer to shift coca growing to Colombia, even if 
it is not as productive as in Peru. They would rather increase 
the number of crops to compensate for the loss in productivity. 
[end recording] 
  This situation is making Colombia not only a cocaine 
processing and marketing country, but also a coca grower as big 
as Bolivia.

<F P=106> [Address to Congress by Efrain Goldenberg, president of the </F>
Council of Ministers and foreign minister, in Lima on 17 March] 
  [Text] Mr. President of Congress, Messrs. Congressmen: 
  Complying with Article 130 of the Constitution, this 
ministerial cabinet is hereby reporting to Congress to reveal 
and debate the general government policy it intends to develop 
and the main measures that are required for its work. 
  Mr. President: 
  Every time a cabinet reports to this assembly, the first 
great problem has been to gather a set of good results to show. 
Fortunately for Peru, this has not been a problem in our case. 
  Actually, our main concern today is to consider, without an 
overly optimistic attitude and as impartially as possible, the 
large number of indicators that Peru is on the right course. I 
will point only to the most significant ones. 
  With a strict policy of austerity and fiscal order, 
Peruvians 
have collectively attained undeniable macroeconomic achievements 
in only three and a half years. 
  We have controlled the second highest inflation rate and 
longest inflationary period that mankind has ever had to 
confront. Our efforts reduced inflation to 39.5 percent in 
1993, the lowest rate in the past 16 years. We have reduced the 
fiscal deficit from more than 13 percent to a reasonable 1.4 
percent of the GDP, which was financed without resorting to the 
deceitful "machine" for printing money without proper backing. 
  We have doubled tax revenues -- which were not enough even 
for paying current government expenses -- from less than 5 
percent to more than 10 percent of the GDP. 
  We have increased our net reserves, which had previously 
been 
squandered to favor privileged sectors who were close to power, 
increasing them from less than $150 million to more than $3 
billion. 
  We also managed to pull the Peruvian economy out of a 
difficult recession phase. In 1993, the GDP growth rate was 3.3 
times as big as the population growth rate, reaching the highest 
level in the Americas: 6.8 percent. 
  Estimates for 1994 are also encouraging. The inflation rate 
is expected to stand at approximately 20 percent, while it is 
estimated that the fiscal deficit will be eliminated, even 
reaching a primary surplus ranging between 1 and 2 percent of 
the GDP, and a tax revenue level of 12 percent of the GDP. 
Reserves are expected to reach $3.5 billion. 
  Besides, the GDP growth rate is expected to be at least 
twice 
that of the population growth rate, and this means that the 
economy will have more resources for each inhabitant. As in 
1993, it will be a healthy and vigorous growth, based on savings 
and work, all of which will give it stability. 
  On the other hand, the pacification process and the 
eradication of terrorism as a threat to the state are firmly 
moving forward. Several thousand terrorists have been captured, 
and the number of repented terrorists is rapidly growing, 
marking the beginning of massive desertion from terrorists' 
ranks. At the present time, as evidence that the terrorist myth 
is undergoing an internal collapse, 3,000 Shining Path and 1,000 
MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] members have already 
deserted. It is important to note that the vast majority of 
desertions within Shining Path took place after the letters 
written by Abimael Guzman were made public. This shows that the 
government's antiterrorist strategy is effective. 
  Two other facts have clearly reflected the progress in the 
pacification process and the deterioration of the terrorist 
movement. First, the amounts requested by insured enterprises 
from insurance companies to cover terrorist damages are today 
seven times lower than in 1992. 
  Second, the number of tourists arriving in Peru has 
increased 
by 37 percent over the last 8 months of 1993, something that 
would have been impossible had we been a country that did not 
inspire growing confidence and security. 
  Yet beyond those indicators, Mr. President, the most 
impartial evidence of the radical improvement we have 
experienced is our revitalized love for and faith in Peru. 
  When in 1988 -- even before the most difficult time in the 
economic crisis -- a prestigious polling company asked Peruvians 
where they would like to be born if they had a chance to be born 
again, 70 percent of those polled replied that they would like 
to be born outside Peru. We Peruvians did not want to be 
Peruvians. Barely two weeks ago, when asked to answer the same 
question, 77 percent chose to be born again in Peru. 
  Mr. President: 
  We are not here -- we cannot do it -- to change an 
orientation that has allowed Peruvians to envisage a modern, 
prosperous future, no matter how difficult this could have 
seemed a few years ago. 
  Neither are we here to make any claims about 
responsibilities 
that are shared by all Peruvians. Yet we want neither to 
relinquish nor forget our experiences, because they make us 
strong and because they promote our unity. A country that does 
not remember its history is a weak country that repeats its 
mistakes. This cabinet wants to correct mistakes and find 
achievements. 
  We are sure that, along with the pacification process, the 
main achievement of our government has been, far and away, the 
enforcement of deep structural reforms based on the principles 
of the free market, a prudent fiscal and monetary policy, a 
redefined role for the state, a redefined relationship between 
the public and private sectors, opening up to international 
commerce, the modernization of institutions, the liberalization 
of all economic sectors, a rejoining with the international 
financial system, and the enforcement of clear regulations for 
local and foreign investment. 
  Through these reforms the state is creating the conditions 
for private initiative to develop production, which will 
gradually allow greater efforts and resources to be devoted to 
improving the standards of living of all Peruvians. In this way 
the state will be able to better fulfill its unavoidable 
obligation to provide education, health, and justice, as well as 
to maintain and build the infrastructure, provide security, and 
guarantee an open market for the benefit of consumers. 
  In addition, the reforms have allowed a reduction in costs 
and an improvement in the efficiency of operations and 
investments made in Peru, by transforming an artificial economy 
into a dynamic economy that is creating jobs. 
  Mr. President: 
  Economic growth through investment -- not through 
indiscriminate spending -- is the basis of the Peruvian 
development model, because investing is the only way to maintain 
current employment and guarantee future jobs. The logic of the 
reforms, and government action at all levels, is therefore to 
give investments a framework of stability and security. 
  The numerous and valuable human and natural resources that 
Peru has are worthless if incapable of providing security. 
Security -- commercial and non-commercial -- is the first thing 
an investor seeks in a country. It is therefore the best way to 
compete internationally and to strengthen our readmission into 
the economic and financial community. 
  In this regard the new Constitution, which was drawn up by 
this Congress and approved, for the first time in our republican 
history, through a plebiscite, contributes to the consolidation 
of the reform system being carried out, by providing political 
support and juridical stability that will guarantee the 
permanence of the Constitution through the years. The 
Constitution provides economic freedom, freedom for initiative, 
and equal conditions, which makes for a viable nation and a 
promising future. 
  Our government also believes that pacification is a needed 
requirement in order to attract investment and reach economic 
development and social well-being. This is one more reason to 
continue to struggle unceasingly toward achieving the complete 
defeat of terrorism in the near future, which is something we 
are convinced we can. 
  But we are also convinced that it is necessary to have broad 
respect for human rights if we want the effectiveness of the 
antisubversive measures to be complete and lasting. We know 
perfectly well that the success being achieved reflects the 
degree of unity of Peruvian society in the search for common 
objectives, and the support of the organized population in 
alliance with the police. 
  Mr. President: 
  The environment of stability and opening existing in the 
country, as well as the investment opportunities it offers, has 
led to a remarkable growth in national and foreign investment. 
  As a result of these conditions, in the last three years the 
national private sector has invested more than $300 million in 
the fishing sector and in plants for producing fishmeal and 
building ships, and has submitted proposals for mine prospecting 
over 50 percent more hectares than in the entire history of Peru. 
  These conditions also have drawn the attention of 
international investment banks and the main multinational 
corporations, which have expanded the capital of established 
local firms through joint ventures [preceding two words in 
English] with private Peruvian companies, created new firms, or 
purchased state companies. 
  There are three very good examples that show that new 
investments are not to be attributed to sheer luck, but to the 
success of a strategy that gradually is beginning to pay. The 
first example is the fact that 11 companies are prospecting for 
oil in Peru while five others are engaged in exploiting more 
than 50 oil wells. 
  The second example is that the budget the U.S. Government 
submitted to Congress this year allocates more aid to Peru than 
to any other Latin American country. 
  The third, and most significant, example is the recent sale 
of a portion of the state's shares of telecommunications 
companies for a large sum of money. 
  The benefits of this privatization will be clearly perceived 
by all Peruvians. Before the year 2000, Peru will have 1 
million new telephone lines. This means that over the next five 
years more than 500 new lines will be installed every day. This 
will give Peru 250 percent more lines than it has today. 
Furthermore, there will be 10 times more public telephones, and 
telephone services will expand all over the country reaching 
every village that has more than 500 inhabitants, thus linking 
1,500 villages that so far have no telephone services. 
  These three examples clearly indicate that Peru is beginning 
to be looked upon as a country with a future, and nobody would 
bet on the future of a country unless its present is solid and 
stable. 
  Mr. President: 
  It has been made clear that to privatize does not simply 
mean 
the handing over of state enterprises to the private sector. 
  Privatization is a process in which there is the intention 
to 
ensure the full competition of the enterprises to help increase 
production, as occurred, for example, with the Chinese company 
called Shoughang, which increased the production of Hierroperu 
[Peruvian Mines Iron Enterprise], which always ran a deficit, by 
125 percent. 
  Privatization means the democratization and decentralization 
of the country by reducing excess power and control. It also 
means an expansion of ownership by allowing the workers' 
participation in the purchase of the enterprises. 
  Privatization means an enlarging and internationalization of 
our economy by increasing the welfare that we enjoy within its 
framework, thus stimulating social development and economic 
growth that requires larger resources than internal savings can 
provide. 
  Privatization means promoting the creation of new jobs and 
the possibility of achieving adequate technical and production 
levels. 
  Privatization means the release of resources that in years 
gone by were used to cover the deficit of state enterprises, 
which amounted to $2.5 billion in 1990, and to obtaining fresh 
resources so the state can provide increased funds for the 
expansion and improvement of the services it gives the people. 
  In the years that the Commission for Promotion of Private 
Investment (Copri) has been functioning, it has privatized some 
30 enterprises for a total of $1.994 billion and has obtained 
investment commitments amounting to an additional $2.272 
billion. Forty-five privatizations have been programmed for 
1994, including Centromin [Central Peru Mining Enterprise], 
Mineroperu [Peruvian State Mineral Marketing Company], 
Electrolima [Lima Electric Power Enterprise], Pescaperu [State 
Fishmeal and Fish Oil Production Agency], Siderperu [Peruvian 
Steel and Enterprise], and Interbanc [expansion unknown]. 
  Mr. President: 
  The series of reforms that have been outlined also have 
positively influenced the development of the capital market and 
have attracted an interesting international flow of capital, and 
they have multiplied financial and banking operations with the 
rest of the world. 
  The new Banking, Financial, and Insurance Institutions Law 
also has been approved, and it has introduced new mechanisms 
into the capital market that are revolutionizing credit and 
generating a series of operations that are highly profitable, 
especially in the cases of credit and long-term financial 
instruments. We have as an example mortgage bonds, which will 
promote the construction of housing financed with adequate 
interest rates and terms of up to 20 years, thus fulfilling 
Peruvians' longtime desire of having access to their own homes. 
  These reforms in the capital market have stimulated stock 
exchange activities, making the Lima Stock Exchange, which is 
currently managed by the private sector, one of the most 
profitable ones with the largest growth in the world for three 
consecutive years. 
  On 2 March, the Lima Stock Exchange set an exchange record 
of 
$68 million, which means that three-quarters of what was 
negotiated in 1990 was negotiated in a few hours. 
  The development of agile, cheap, and unrestrained foreign 
trade has promoted the expansion of our exchange of trade with 
the world, thus allowing Peruvians access to assets and services 
produced in international markets, which in turn feeds the 
competitiveness of our exports and generates major income from 
imports. Thus, by reducing tariffs from 66 percent to 16 
percent, the income from imports has multiplied two and one-half 
times between 1990 and 1993, increasing from some $600 million 
to some $1.5 billion. 
  It is true that our exports have to be promoted. This is why 
we are carrying out a complete study to determine our 
competitive advantages and potential markets, and we also are 
carefully evaluating our weaknesses and strengths. In a 
globalized and interdependent economy that has trade as its main 
instrument, Peru aspires to recover its position as an exporting 
country. 
  Mr. President: 
  Many of the noteworthy structural reforms already have been 
implemented and are in force. Now it is a question of 
consolidating the reforms that have been implemented and to 
continue rationally with those that still have to be implemented 
by refining development mechanisms and by concentrating on 
improving the conditions that affect the daily lives of Peruvian 
men and women. 
  In order to carry out this challenge it is necessary that we 
place an ever-increasing emphasis on social aspects. This is 
why I wish to explain some of the most important changes that 
have occurred in the sectors directly involved in the country's 
social development. 
  In health care, the hub of the government's strategy is to 
enhance preventive medicine and the quality of basic medical 
care provided at dispensaries so they can effectively solve 
minor ailments affecting the majority of the population. We are 
seeking not only to tackle problems when they are staring us in 
the face, but also to forestall the damages to which nearly 18 
million Peruvians needing medical aid -- which has to be 
provided by the government -- are exposed. 
  In order to attain this objective, we are streamlining the 
Health Ministry through efficient management and the linking of 
administrative systems that previously were unconnected. This 
will be instrumental in improving and expediting the 
decisionmaking process and the administration of the scarce 
resources we have at our disposal. 
  Moreover, the community will share the management of the 
health care system with the government. This will enable the 
community to directly administer health centers and dispensaries 
with government funds. 
  This shared management is not a political measure designed 
for the government to abandon its obligations. It is a 
technical approach to come to grips with the health problem in 
Peru, which will enable us to pinpoint the population's real 
needs. It also conforms to the constitutional mandate to 
coordinate goals with institutions from the sector and the 
people involved. 
  Furthermore, by giving key decisionmaking power to the 
community, the state reinforces nonpolitical criteria that will 
prevent changes of government from affecting long-term health 
care plans that the people are rightfully demanding. 
  To finance their undertakings, health officials have 
obtained 
$200 million from international cooperation agencies. These 
funds will be basically used to supply equipment and 
infrastructure facilities to medical centers and posts. They 
also will be earmarked for improving basic maternal-child 
survival and nutrition levels, eradicating diseases like 
measles, and controlling others like tuberculosis and cholera. 
  Mr. President: 
  The current educational situation poses the enormous 
challenge of modernizing the system by promoting the principle 
of freedom of teaching at public and private levels alike and by 
decentralizing education. To this end, the government is 
promoting community participation, strengthening school 
directors' authority, and internal autonomy for educational 
centers. 
  Educational modernization also requires the improvement of 
school facilities. To this end, more than 200 schools were 
built and nearly 100 schools were refurbished in 1993. One 
school per day will be built in 1994. 
  Educational modernization also requires that teachers be 
adequately trained and earn decent salaries. To this effect, 
the government has started an aggressive training campaign for 
50,000 teachers -- who have been neglected for 20 years -- and, 
for the first time, this training program includes all directors 
of public schools nationwide. 
  The government also soon will implement a gradual salary 
increase for teachers. 
  Additionally, a school evaluation system will be implemented 
that will include tests designed to assess the performance of 
teachers and students alike with a view to ensuring that 
progress be made and that the teaching methods, techniques, and 
subjects are the appropriate ones. To implement these 
objectives, 1 million textbooks will be distributed free of 
charge to schoolchildren in the country's poorest districts. 
  Furthermore, 200,000 children for the first time are 
receiving free preschool education in accordance with the 
mandate of the new Constitution that free education must be 
extended to this age level. 
  Mr. President: 
  Recognizing that good administration of justice is essential 
in any democratic system, our government is trying to make 
justice available to all Peruvians. To this end, we are 
coordinating with the judicial branch an increase in budget 
resources to expand the basic justice system structure by 
increasing the number of justices of the peace and 
first-instance judges. 
  Furthermore, radical changes are being made in the Peruvian 
prison system, which is bound to become the best one in Latin 
America. These changes include the creation of the Prison 
Studies Center and the remodeling of 108 rundown prisons into 
modern penitentiaries. The government's investment plans call 
for the construction of eight prisons and the remodeling of 12. 
  But most importantly, these centers will be adequately 
equipped to provide the necessary services to improve health, 
work, and education for the rehabilitation of some 18,000 
inmates. 
  Finally, the executive branch has submitted to Congress a 
draft law on the national public registries system, establishing 
guidelines for its consolidation, modification, and automation. 
The reform in the area of public registries will guarantee 
property rights and expedite the use of mortgages to secure 
loans from financial institutions. 
  Mr. President: 
  Peru wants to be an integrated country; it wants to expand 
its domestic market and produce more. To achieve this, it 
requires basic infrastructure facilities for transportation and 
communications, electricity generation, potable water and sewage 
systems, and ports and airports. These facilities will improve 
the standard of living of all Peruvians and promote efficiency 
in the private sector. 
  Twenty-six bridges and 3,500 km of roads were either built, 
repaired, or maintained in 1992. This figure rose to 4,200 km 
in 1993. Today these projects include approximately 2,000 km of 
the Panamerican Highway and the Central Highway, and 1,300 km in 
the Selva area. All these projects, which have been implemented 
thanks to efficient management of Treasury funds and 
international cooperation, have used a great deal of manpower. 
  The government also is implementing a plan to take 
corrective 
action and improve efficiency in its power companies, with a 
view to avoiding electricity theft and reducing delinquent 
payments. To this end, it has put into motion the Special 
Benefit Program for the Regularization of Electricity Debts. 
  As a result of greater efficiency, electricity maintenance 
improved markedly in 1990s [when electricity production 
increased 9.3 percent compared with 1992]. 
  Additionally, to increase the energy supply in the future, 
the government has built the Ventanilla plant, which required an 
investment of $100 million, and has earmarked $17 million for 12 
small power plant projects. Work also is already under way for 
the construction of the Cachimayo-Abancay high-tension line 
that, at a cost of $11 million, will be instrumental in bringing 
about the much-delayed and much-awaited electrification of 
Apurimac Department. 
  Besides, the private sector plays a key role in meeting the 
people's needs for infrastructure facilities and public 
services. Thus, thanks to the new Law of Electricity 
Concessions, private companies have been authorized to engage in 
projects that will substantially increase the electricity supply. 
  Mr. President: 
  Our cabinet is aware that there will be no comprehensive 
solution to social problems without promoting the development of 
rural areas, where one-third of the Peruvian people make their 
living. Thus, it wants to assign top priority to modernizing 
the agrarian sector by adopting essential business guidelines 
that will give it greater dynamics. 
  To this end we are implementing a special program for land 
deeds that will enable tenants of rural plots to obtain deeds 
and thus promote the establishment of a formal land market and, 
consequently, attract investments in agriculture as soon as 
possible. Furthermore, tenants with deeds will be able to sell 
their plots or mortgage them to obtain loans for the first time. 
  Similarly, excessive regulations governing water resources 
have resulted in unrealistically low prices, which may be 
corrected through a law on water that we will be proposing to 
Congress. We firmly believe that the consolidation of a market 
for land and water is the best strategy for promoting agrarian 
development. 
  Thus, private companies could invest in major projects such 
as Majes or Chavimochic, which earlier had been entirely 
financed by the state and which -- as proven by facts -- require 
large resources from the Peruvian people to benefit only a few. 
  We cannot fail to mention the painful natural disasters that 
have affected both urban and rural areas of our country. In 
addressing these problems, we count on the determined support of 
the Armed Forces, the National Police, friendly countries like 
Japan and Great Britain, and the solidarity of the Peruvian 
people. 
  We also want to take this opportunity to make a public 
announcement that fills us with satisfaction. The Peruvian 
Government has concluded its negotiations with Shell, the 
world's largest oil company, for an agreement to assess the 
potential of the gigantic Camisea gas deposit. This agreement 
will pave the way for the signing in 1995 of a contract for the 
exploitation of this deposit, the contents of which are 
equivalent to 2.5 billion barrels of oil -- eight times larger 
than our hydrocarbon reserves. 
  The establishment of the Municipal Compensation Fund [Fondo 
de Compensacion Municipal] is one of the most socially 
meaningful measures of our administration. This fund's 
resources are distributed with decentralization in mind, to 
really help out the country's most remote and poorest villages 
and towns. Through the implementation of this fund this 
February, districts like Ate in Lima and Independencia in Huaraz 
received seven or eight times more money than the year before. 
  Mr. President: 
  We are aware that there is a great deal to be done yet in 
order to attain the main goal of our administration and, 
especially, of this cabinet I preside over: a modern and 
efficient, but above all fair, society in which the state will 
guarantee rights, not distribute privileges. In sum, we aim for 
a society capable of offering real and better opportunities to 
all. 
  This society is the new Constitution's main objective, and 
President Fujimori has instructed us to give top priority to 
this goal. On the eve of the 21st century we also believe that 
this is what the people want. 
  At this point the overall social deficit -- that is, the 
difference between what we Peruvians actually consume and what 
we should consume to have access to an adequate basket of basic 
staples -- stands at $15 billion per year, twice the nation's 
overall budget. 
  It is quite clear that these shortcomings will not be fully 
overcome shortly or through the mechanisms of a market economy 
and the creation of new jobs. Therefore, the state as a whole 
must help overcome extreme poverty. 
  The number and the size of the shortcomings are enormous, 
especially if we take into account that between 1986 and 1990 
state spending on social projects fell from $3.2 billion to $750 
million per year. 
  Thus, just as this administration prepared a serious plan 
for 
economic stabilization and structural reforms, it has prepared a 
social stabilization plan that seeks to strengthen basic 
institutions and improve the quality of state spending on social 
projects. This plan is designed to develop low-complexity, 
large-scale, socially meaningful programs that will help take 
care of the most burning needs of the majority of the people, 
especially the extremely poor. 
  Our administration believes that people are the most 
valuable 
capital a country has, and that resources spent on building up 
this capital should not be looked upon as waste but as a very 
profitable investment. This investment, however, should be 
increased like any other investment in a realistic and 
responsible manner in keeping with the growth of state resources. 
  For a start, the state has budgeted more than $1.6 billion 
for social spending this year, twice the amount budgeted for 
1990. We are sure, however, that in the medium term we will be 
able to provide the $2.8 billion we need to fulfill basic and 
urgent social requirements as far as health, education, 
nutritional assistance, and justice is concerned. 
  The long-term approach and the freedom of initiative that 
the 
economic reforms encourage and the economic system established 
in our Constitution advocates are prompted by the aforementioned 
burning needs of Peruvian men and women. 
  Mr. President: 
  During the preceding three and one-half years Peru has 
undergone a radical change that has renewed domestic and foreign 
optimism in our future as a nation. We have ceased to be a 
country concerned only with current problems and threatened by 
political and economic problems. 
  Because of the progress we have made toward pacifying our 
nation and making it economically stable, now we can see the 
light at the end of the tunnel and move surely toward social 
stabilization and development based on investments, savings, 
efficiency, and productivity. 
  At this stage we want to invest more in our human capital, 
which will be essential for meeting the challenges of 
development because we are convinced that we must satisfy the 
demands of our citizens and give opportunities to everyone for 
our country to prosper. 
  Firmly committed to attaining this objective, we have come 
to 
this Congress in compliance with the Constitution to ask for a 
vote of confidence. Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Part four of a judicial reform series by Victor Andres </F>
Ponce] 
  [Text] Just as it is important to resolve the problem of 
the inadequate number of judges to meet the requirements of 
justice, it is crucial to address the crisis of the judicial 
career, which has been markedly degraded in recent decades. 
  Specialists contend that this is a key factor in the reform 
because judges are responsible for handing down decisions and 
bringing prestige to their offices. 
  The system used to appoint judges has been one of the most 
controversial issues concerning the judicial career, as well as 
a topic that has been widely debated in the nation. Political 
interference has caused considerable damage in this respect. 
<H5>  Background </H5>
  In accordance with Article 223 of the 1933 Constitution, the 
Judicial Branch Organizational Law provided that "the 
performance and qualifications of first instance and appellate 
court judges will be evaluated every five years by the Supreme 
Court, which, acting as a jury and after conducting the 
inquiries it might deem appropriate, may dismiss any judge from 
office..." 
  It should be noted that the only time an evaluation was 
conducted in accordance with that law was in 1966. No further 
attempt to evaluate magistrates has been made since that year. 
  Later, a decree-law issued in December 1969 by the military 
dictatorship provided for a special confirmation in office of 
judges (based, of course, on criteria advocated by the 
government at that time). 
  Later, the 1979 Constitution established that Supreme Court 
justices must be confirmed by the Senate and that all other 
lower-ranking magistrates must be confirmed by the Supreme Court 
plenum. The 1979 Constitution did not provide for the periodical 
confirmation of judges. 
<H5>  Prospects </H5>
  The new Constitution has entrusted the National Council for 
Magistrates (CNM) with the task of selecting and appointing 
judges and prosecutors. Until the CNM is organized, its 
functions will be exercised by the Disciplinary Board for 
Magistrates. 
  Specialists contend that the CNM organizational law should 
include the requirement of periodical evaluations based on 
established guidelines for each level. 
  In this respect it should be noted that the Judicial Branch 
Organizational Law establishes clear, precise guidelines for 
evaluating the merits of judges, namely the timely and correct 
disposition of cases, moral integrity, the lack of sanctions or 
disciplinary measures, duly accredited academic degrees and 
training studies, publication of legal papers, awards, and 
decorations. 
  Therefore, there can be no argument against establishing the 
requirement for periodical evaluations in the CNM organizational 
law, especially considering that the evaluation is to be 
conducted by an independent, nonpolitical body. 
<H5>  Impact of the New Procedural Codes </H5>
  In earlier reports we stated that our procedural laws are 
being rapidly modernized through the Code of Civil Procedures, 
the Code for Minors, and the imminent implementation of the Code 
of Penal Procedures. 
  Specialists have argued that the "pro-code" mentality that 
prevails among judges and that is taught in our law schools is 
not the most appropriate one for implementing the new procedures. 
  In fact, our judges have always preferred to go to trial 
instead of promoting conciliation between contending parties. 
  As we reported earlier, judges now are required to seek 
conciliation, because if they fail to do so the procedure may be 
nullified. But what happens when judges have been trained for 
litigation and for applying laws instead of administering 
justice conscientiously and equitably? 
  A civil judge said: What could happen is that conciliation 
may become a pro forma, pointless procedure because the judge is 
not prepared to bring litigants together. 
  In this context, there is an undeniable truth: Law schools' 
curricula must be reformed to conform to the new procedural 
trends. 
<H5>  Academy for Magistrates </H5>
  The creation of a judicial school for higher studies, which 
had been proposed in every reform initiative for decades, was 
incorporated in the new Constitution. An organizational law -- 
which should be proposed by the judicial branch -- now is 
required to outline its objectives and functions. 
  Through this institution, which will make it possible to 
implement a policy of steadily training judges and prosecutors 
and to promote discussions on the administration of justice in 
our country, the Peruvian justice system will have the chance of 
measuring up to the judicial branches of other countries. 
  In this respect, it has been reported that the judicial 
branch manager went to the United States in October to negotiate 
an agreement with the vice rector of Harvard University whereby 
the latter would support the future academy for magistrates. A 
well-informed source said: "The objective is to create a legal 
school similar to ESAN [School of Business Administration]." 
  It also has been learned that the judicial executive council 
is drafting the bylaws for the academy and all that remains to 
be done is to remodel a recreational center in Chaclacayo that 
formerly belonged to the Popular Bank. 
  In his book "Alternative Justice," specialist Alberto 
Bustamente states his opposition to the idea that the academy 
should be the only institution charged with training judges and 
prosecutors for selection and appointment purposes. He contends 
that this will pose the risk of allowing a single institution to 
monopolize the training of magistrates on the basis of its own 
ideologies, and this procedure would entail going back many 
decades as far as training techniques is concerned. He 
believes every law faculty should be prepared to give these 
training courses so there will be several trends of thought in 
the law. 
  Another decisive factor in the judicial career crisis is 
salaries. In a previous report, we reported that the monthly 
salary of Supreme Court justice amounts to only 3,800 soles 
(less than $2,000), while their counterparts in other countries 
earn an average of $5,000 monthly. 
  The Judicial Branch Organizational Law establishes that a 
superior court member should earn 90 percent of the income of a 
Supreme Court justice; that is, 3,400 soles. The reality is 
quite different: He makes only 1,600 soles. 
  In the case of criminal, civil, and other judges, the law 
provides that their salaries should be equivalent to 80 percent 
of the salary of a Supreme Court justice; that is, 3,000 soles. 
In reality, they only make 1,100 soles. 
  Justices of the peace with law degrees should earn 2,600 
soles, but they only make 700 soles. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  The solution to the judicial career crisis requires actions 
by several institutions, from the CNM to law faculties. 
  One of the key reform topics is to include the requirement 
for a periodical evaluation in the future CNM organizational law 
-- based on merit guidelines -- for confirmation and promotion 
purposes. Thus, annual evaluation panels will become true 
national events. 
  Additionally, law schools' curricula must be reformed to 
conform to the new role assigned to judges in accordance with 
procedural codes. This job must be coordinated with the Academy 
for Magistrates. 
  Finally, there will be no judicial career reform if the 
current salaries are not increased.

<F P=106> [Part five of a judicial reform series by Victor Andres </F>
Ponce] 
  [Text] Before the new Judicial Branch Organizational Law's 
issuance, the Supreme Court or the higher courts handled both 
jurisdictional and administrative matters. As a result, the 
management of resources, which was looked upon as a secondary 
issue, was bad. 
  Higher courts' members had to worry whether some given court 
needed a desk, a typewriter, or more personnel. The results of 
this type of management are staring at us: extremely bad 
infrastructure and management conditions. 
  Court buildings and the quality of Peruvian justice declined 
simultaneously. All one needs to do to agree with this 
assessment is take one look at the mounds of files on the 
tables, the shortage of typewriters, the courtrooms' small size, 
and put it together with the sluggishness of legal procedures 
and the lack of sentences. 
  In other words, bad management is also partly to blame for 
the shortcomings of Peruvian justice. 
<H5>  Judicial Branch Management </H5>
  As has been pointed out in previous parts of this series, 
one 
of the main innovations of the new Judicial Branch 
Organizational Law is the separation between jurisdictional 
issues -- which are dealt with by a Supreme Court plenum -- and 
managerial and administrative issues. The Executive Council was 
created to handle the latter. This council has several bodies. 
The Office of the General Manager is one of the most important. 
  Thus, for the first time in the Peruvian judicial branch's 
history there will be a general manager to handle administrative 
matters, taking these matters out judges' hands. 
  The new Judicial Branch Organizational Law gives the general 
manager the same rank as that of a Supreme Court member, which 
means that he has a seat on the Executive Council and can voice 
his opinion but does not have the right to vote. This will lead 
to greater integration and better coordination. According to a 
source, "this is the first time that a professional other than a 
lawyer or judge will hold the rank of Supreme Court member." 
  To better carry out his duties, the Office of the General 
Manager will have a personnel manager, a computer systems 
manager, an organizational manager, and an infrastructure 
manager. 
  The Office of the General Manager was created, among other 
things, to make the judicial branch a financially more dynamic 
organization capable of generating on its own much more funds 
than it does nowadays and to tap new sources of funds. Another 
reason was, of course, to manage these resources rationally and 
technically. All this is absolutely new for an institution 
used to obscure management. In the next part of this report, we 
will provide further details on the progress made in this area. 
  The establishment of the Office of the General Manager, 
however, has awakened some jealousy, especially in the lower 
courts. Certain judges feel they are losing power with every 
minor administrative decision made or there is a power beyond 
them organizing the courts. Our source stated: "It is not a 
question of taking power away from the judges but of seeking 
logical and effective management." 
<H5>  The Infrastructure Problems </H5>
  One of the new management's main challenges is to resolve 
the 
infrastructure shortage. Roberto Alvarez, who is in charge of 
the Judicial Branch Research Center, said: "We now have 400 
more judges than we had in the seventies but no new courts have 
been built. The problem stares at us: The space that a single 
judge used in the seventies is now shared by four judges." 
  In the country's capital, the old Justice Palace houses most 
of the courts. 
  It is well known that the palace was built toward the end of 
the thirties and has suffered from the earthquakes that took 
place in 1949, 1966, 1970, and 1974. The building's structure 
has been severely damaged by these quakes. 
  The only efforts to make it less of a warren were the 
opening 
of new courts in northern Lima, the project to open other courts 
in southern Lima and Chosica, and the transfer of 30 civil 
courts to the building at the intersection of Arenales Avenue 
and Dos de Mayo Street. 
  According to projections by the Office of the General 
Manager, the ideal area for a court to carry out its tasks 
adequately is 140 square meters. The current average area in the 
courts is 20 square meters. The criminal court's situation is 
alarming: mountains of papers, one judge, four secretaries, two 
administrative employees, and the public, and they all have to 
squeeze in to do their work and process the documents. 
  The same situation prevails in civil court, but with the 
additional burden that many secretaries work in the court's 
basement because there is no room in the judges' offices, and in 
some cases they work in the office on Azangaro Street. 
  In the provinces the courts work in facilities donated by 
the 
municipalities, and some of them have no water or electricity. 
Regarding equipment, the situation is also poor. In only a few 
cases is there more than just a typewriter. 
  In some places there are cases when the judge buys the 
equipment from his own pocket. 
  In this regard, it is worth commenting that among the new 
management's immediate plans is the adaptation of small 
facilities to decentralize the courts. A source who knows the 
problem said: "There is no need for judicial palaces. The idea 
is to build court facilities." 
  The delay in installing the criminal courts in the building 
that housed the Economy Ministry and the civil courts in the 
building that housed the Education Ministry also will be solved. 
It also is known that the Popular Bank, Agrarian Bank, and 
Industrial Bank branch buildings are about to be transferred to 
the judicial branch. 
<H5>  The Administrative Personnel Problem </H5>
  The judicial branch has 4,700 employees. Of that amount, 
4,000 are "jurisdictional administrative" personnel (they carry 
out work related to the administration of justice) who include 
court secretaries, secretaries, and court reporters for higher 
courts and the Supreme Court. The jurisdictional administrative 
personnel have two problems. They must have a law degree to 
fulfill the new Judicial Branch Organizational Law's requirement 
to carry out their tasks. And the other problem is their 
salaries. For example, a court secretary only earns 350 soles. 
  It is known that the management will make a general 
evaluation of the "jurisdictional administrative personnel" and 
then will make a public call to fill positions based on 
qualifications. But regarding salaries, there is still no 
solution to this problem because the judicial branch has 
obtained very little additional resources in the 1994 budget. 
  The last problem is very serious because the secretaries are 
the link between the judges and the litigators. This link allows 
them to become corrupt by asking for money to expedite the 
process and sometimes getting money on behalf of the judges who 
are not even aware of it. 
  In the Court of Appeals' case, the problems of the 
administrative personnel get worse. 
  There are four secretaries in every criminal court and, 
according to them, their two administrative assistants are not 
enough to support them in their task of processing incoming 
cases. 
  Something similar happens in civil court, which has two 
secretaries and two administrative assistants. Regarding the 
case of the 15 courts resolving cases with the old Code of 
Procedure, there are six secretaries, provisional ones, to 
expedite the process. 
  Is there enough or an excessive number of employees? 
Everything seems to indicate there are not enough. But what 
happens if the courts are equipped with computers? In the 
previous reports it was indicated that computers can save 50 
percent in court work. In this regard, informatics could reduce 
the number of "jurisdictional administrative personnel." 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  The report comes to the conclusion that the judicial 
branch's 
administrative system is as important as the quality of judges. 
There can be no reform of justice if there is no new 
administration of human and material resources. The new Judicial 
Branch Organizational Law has favorably resolved this historic 
deficit in the courts. 
  Regarding the main problems to be faced, there is the 
alarming deficit of court facilities and equipment, and the 
situation of court employees. The new requirements demand that 
jurisdictional administrative personnel have a law degree, that 
they be able to handle court procedures, and be well paid. To do 
that it is certainly necessary to have more resources, which 
will be our topic in the next report.

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] Poll on Fujimori, La Cantuta, Phone 
Company Sale 
  A March poll shows that in a two-way presidential contest, 
President Alberto Fujimori would trail slightly behind former UN 
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, but in a 
multicandidate election, Fujimori would lead, as he also would 
do in a two-way race with Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont. In the 
same poll, 40.9 percent of the respondents thought that 
Fujimori's chances of being reelected had gone down "in recent 
months." 
  The IMASEN poll shows that Perez de Cuellar has moved 
slightly up since January, with 45.2 percent in a two-way 
contest (from 43.1 percent in January) to Fujimori's 43.4 
percent (essentially the same as in January). If the contest 
were between Fujimori and Belmont only and were held "tomorrow," 
Fujimori would lead Belmont with 49.6 percent of the vote to 
Belmont's 31.3 percent, while 19.1 percent did not respond to 
this question. If the candidates were Fujimori, Perez de 
Cuellar, Belmont, and "others," Fujimori would lead Perez de 
Cuellar by 3.2 percent (down from a lead of 4.7 percent in 
January), with Belmont and "others trailing far behind. The 
respondents were fairly evenly divided over whether Fujimori's 
reelection chances had improved or diminished in recent months, 
with 38.5 percent saying his chances had improved, 40.9 percent 
saying diminished, and 19.9 percent believing Fujimori's chances 
remained the same. There were 403 respondents interviewed. 
  The March poll also showed that 69.7 percent approved of the 
highly profitable privatization sale of the Peruvian Telephone 
Company, with 24.3 percent disapproving. 
  In a poll on the La Cantuta affair, 354 interviews were 
conducted. Asked whether all involved in the affair had been 
prosecuted, 84.7 said not all had been, and only 8.8 percent 
thought they had. Some 66.1 percent thought the speed with which 
the military trial was conducted was cause for distrust, while 
only 27.7 thought it was not. Asked whether the sentences had 
been just or light, 54.5 percent said they had been light and 
34.5 percent believed they were just. 
  The data indicate that gender, age, and socioeconomic status 
were not significant factors in determining responses. The polls 
were conducted 1-4 March and covered all age and socioeconomic 
groups. Margin of error was not given.

  [Text] Montevideo, 1 Apr (EFE) -- During a news conference, 
Uruguayan Interior Minister Raul Iturria stated today that the 
Uruguayan intelligence services have not discovered any 
indications of terrorist activities in the country linked to the 
Basque organization ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty]. 
  The minister indicated that he had only called the news 
conference because of repeated media requests due to information 
published in Madrid newspapers regarding those possible links. 
  He made it clear that in any case it was not a question of a 
new investigation, that it is a question of an investigation 
that was carried out due to the arrest of an alleged group of 
Spanish ETA activists in May 1992, and that the current 
investigation has come up with the same results. 
  The minister added that he understood the Spanish 
authorities' concern regarding the delay in handing over the 
three alleged terrorists. Uruguayan courts now have granted the 
Spaniards' extradition because in a country with a strict 
separation of the branches of government, such as in Uruguay, 
that is an affair that pertains to the judicial branch, and the 
executive branch cannot interfere. 
  "No one wants this type of situation, but they must be 
handled in a very balanced way if they crop up," Iturria said, 
and he added: "Terrorism is a serious evil, as we Uruguayans 
know, and we suffered a 12-year institutional rupture due its 
activities." 
  Uruguayan intelligence services director Saul Claveria 
indicated in a separate conversation that his investigation 
regarding the charges of links between the ETA and the legal 
Uruguayan Tupamaros Party has come up with nothing that 
Uruguayan courts can term a crime. 
  Claveria also indicated that the presence of alleged ETA 
members in Uruguay cannot be presupposed to be a reactivation of 
the terrorism this country suffered in past decades, "because 
the Uruguayan people and government are against subversion: We 
Uruguayans have suffered to much because of terrorism, and we do 
not want a repeat."

<F P=106> [Report by Giuliana Chiappe] </F>
  [Text] Loan assistance granted by the Venezuelan Central 
Bank [BCV] rose 1,000 percent from early January to mid-March of 
1994. The loans granted totaled 342.013 billion bolivares on 18 
March. 
  According to the latest report on weekly indicators, the BCV 
statements show the Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection 
Fund [Fondo de Garantia de Depositos y Proteccion Bancaria-- 
Fogade] received most of that amount, or 308 billion bolivares, 
to be granted in turn for financial assistance to Banco 
Hipotecario de Occidente and seven banking institutions having 
problems of liquidity. The BCV has loaned 35.435 billion 
bolivares directly to commercial banks in the form of 
anticipated payments, discounts and securities borrowing, and by 
regular methods of loan assistance. During the second week of 
March, mortgage banks required 270 million bolivares, whereas 
financial corporations did not require direct aid. 
  During the previous week, the nominal increase was 29.698 
billion bolivares, because by 11 march the BCV's loan assistance 
was 312.314 billion bolivares; 35.085 billion bolivares went to 
commercial banks, and 276.959 billion bolivares went to public 
institutions, a segment in which Fogade is included. 
  At the start of January, the BCV's outlook for loan 
assistance was totally different. By 1 January granted loans 
totaled 29.073 billion bolivares. Banks had barely needed 23.128 
billion bolivares, whereas public institutions needed 5.945 
billion bolivares. 
  The financial crisis, heightened by the closure and 
intervention of Banco Latino, absorbed 1,000 percent more than 
the figure registered in January. More precisely, the aid went 
up 1.076 percent. 
  Requests for money in general decreased during the week of 
18 
March, in relation to the week of 11 March, as BCV officials 
reported when they explained the results of their studies on the 
institution's activities during the past period: 
  "BCV's actions were aimed at lending credit aid, directly 
and 
through Fogade, to institutions that have problems of liquidity, 
although to a lesser degree than during the preceding week." 
<H5>  Regarding Other Operations </H5>
  The BCV concentrated on selling zero coupon bonds [bonos 
cero 
cupon] and did so in record amounts for the ones with the 
regular 91-day validity and even, for the first time in 1994, 
for the ones valid for 184 days. Furthermore, it placed 
Government Treasury notes into private operations. 
  Liquidity during the week studied by the BCV increased by 
1.3 
percent, due to a 1.4-percent increase in cash deposits 
[depositos a la vista] and a 2.8-percent increase in savings. 
  The monetary base increased .7 percent due to the "incidence 
of expansion" created by Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation's 
internal financial effort and the financial institution's credit 
aid, "all of which was not compensated in the base absorption 
carried out by the institution through open market operations 
and the sale of foreign exchange." 
  Commercial banks' acquisitioning and placing of assets 
increased at the same 1.3-percent rate during the week. 
Concerning investments, clients preferred cash deposits, which 
increased 3.4 percent. [figure as published] In contrast, 
long-term certificates decreased 1.1 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Adela Leal] </F>
  [Text] The failure of shareholders to make the capital 
investments required to undertake new projects and expand 
others, and the management's inability to make the necessary 
corrections to adapt to new market conditions are the main 
causes of the deep crisis that has the basic enterprises in the 
Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana (CVG) holding company on the 
verge of collapse. 
  This assessment can be deduced from the report by an ad hoc 
congressional committee that looked into the financial 
statements of the enterprises from 1987 to 1992. The committee 
was chaired by Deputy Ramon Jose Medina, who was accompanied by 
Abdon Vivas Teran (the current minister president of the FIV 
[Venezuelan Investment Fund]), Gustavo Marquez, Freddy Lepage, 
Rafael Rodriguez Acosta, Amarilis Valor, Ildemaro Martinez, and 
Margot Siso. 
  The study, which focused on the aluminum and iron and steel 
industries, concluded that the CVG enterprises are in critical 
condition, some of them technically bankrupt, such as Alcasa, 
with liabilities more than double their assets. 
<H5>  Properly Planned Privatization </H5>
  The drafters of the report evaluate each of the six 
enterprises in the aluminum and iron and steel industries 
separately but offer overall conclusions and recommendations 
that are valid for them all. 
  They blame the CVG, as the agency that promotes the region's 
industrial development and as a major shareholder in the 
enterprises, for having spurred new projects and expanded 
existing ones without the capital investments by shareholders 
needed to complete them. 
  Most of the time these funds were not forthcoming, according 
to one of the conclusions, and other times they arrived 
belatedly. As a result, the enterprises had to resort urgently 
to short- and long-term borrowing, which in turn has meant huge 
financial costs for them, with the resulting damage to the 
industries' capital resources. 
<H5>  Aluminum Sector in Danger </H5>
  The report notes that the enterprises in the aluminum sector 
are in a critical, perilous condition owing to the steady 
decline in international prices, which has seriously disrupted 
their operations. This, along with the failure to recognize the 
industries' external debts and the sharp rise in international 
interest rates, explains the magnitude of the crisis. 
  Maintaining operating efficiency until 1989 and closing down 
inefficient, obsolete production lines were necessary steps. 
Today they are indispensable. 
  In another regard, the report says that now that the 
government has capitalized 60 percent of the SIDOR [Orinoco Iron 
and Steelworks] debt, the iron and steel sector is in less 
danger and its financial indices reflect reasonably good 
performance; as a result, its problems are altogether manageable. 
  In conclusion, it states that privatization should not be 
viewed dogmatically, arguing that although it is not a panacea 
for the problems of the CVG enterprises, it should not be 
regarded as harmful to the national interest either. 
<H5>  Alcasa [Caroni Aluminum, Inc.] </H5>
  This enterprise has structural problems, as reflected in the 
fact that its manufacturing costs stand at some 18.06 billion 
bolivars while its sales are around 17.6 billion. 
  It also faces a serious insolvency problem, as it has a 
working capital deficit of 21.1 billion bolivars, which is 
equivalent to more than 14 months of sales. 
  This enterprise, the report finds, is technically bankrupt 
unless shareholders give it fresh infusions of investment 
capital. In practice, Alcasa's creditors own it, and unless an 
estimated $300 million in investments is forthcoming, the best 
option is to close it down. 
<H5>  Venalum [Aluminum Company of Venezuela, Inc.] </H5>
  Venalum also has structural problems, as its manufacturing 
costs stand at 97.3 bolivars for every 100 in sales. 
  Its debt amounts to 44.6 billion bolivars, with assets of 
63.9 billion, a ratio of 0.7 to 1, which can be regarded as very 
sound financially. 
<H5>  Interalumina </H5>
  Its manufacturing costs were equivalent to 83 percent of 
costs in 1992, a very high ratio (it should not be more than 70 
percent). 
  The enterprise is reasonably solvent, with working capital 
of 
around 7.7 billion bolivars, although the reducers have a 15 
billion bolivar debt that they would seem unable to pay back in 
the short run. 
<H5>  Bauxiven [Venezuelan Bauxite, Inc.] </H5>
  As of December 1992 this project required 23 billion in 
investments, and only 4.5 billion was forthcoming. As a result, 
it is beginning operations with a heavy financial burden and a 
high indebtedness index. 
  It is failing to comply with the IDB and FIV financing 
agreements. 
<H5>  SIDOR </H5>
  Its manufacturing costs have remained very high, reaching 90 
percent of sales in 1992. 
  Its current ratio during the years under study can be 
considered reasonable, and its working capital as of the end of 
1992 was 27.5 billion bolivars. 
  The government's capitalization of its debt obviously 
improved its debt ratio. 
<H5>  Ferrominera </H5>
  Its manufacturing costs rose from 50 to 60 percent of sales. 
This means that cutbacks have to be made in order to reverse the 
trend back to 40 percent, which would be acceptable for this 
mining firm. 
  Its debt ratio stood at 2.69 in 1992, and the enterprise's 
current ratio is slightly worse.

  [Excerpt] Guatemala City, 2 Apr (DPA) -- Magistrate 
Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon, president of Guatemla's 
Constitutionality Court, was killed this morning by unidentified 
gunmen while driving his car in the company of his wife and son. 
The shooting occurred just before the family reached their home. 
  After being notified of the situation, Guatemalan President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio expressed his dismay at the news, 
Information Secretary Felix Loarca Guzman told DPA. De Leon 
immediately ordered Interior Minister Danilo Parinello to 
conduct an exhaustive investigation and to put his best men on 
the case, Loarca stated. 
  The Constitutionality Court is currently the court in 
Guatemala with the most credibility and trust. It was 
instrumental in mantaining the de jure state following the 
incidents of last May when then-President Jorge Serrano Elias 
dissolved Congress and the Supreme Court and attempted to govern 
with absolute power. At that time, the Constitutionality Court 
outlined the legal and constitutional path that should be 
followed by the Army. Gonzalez Dubon, in a historic and solemn 
act attended by the diplomatic corps accredited to the country, 
announced that state institutions would be maintained while 
deposed President Serrano was replaced. Shortly after this 
occurred, current President Ramiro de Leon Carpio was elected.

  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, accompanied by his 
cabinet, made statements to the media and said certain details 
about national security will possibly be made known today. Let 
us listen to the Guatemalan president: 
  [Begin recording] [De Leon] [Words indistinct] in the same 
building, he was my teacher, and was specially recognized as a 
jurist. The Guatemalan people appreciated him greatly as a 
lawyer. Finally, he was president of the Constitutional Court, a 
mandate that was about to end. He did an outstanding job there, 
not only during the 25 May incidents, in which we returned to 
the institutional and constitutional order that had been broken 
by former President Jorge Serrano Elias, but during recent 
actions carried out by the court. He recently ruled that the 
electoral and political party law was unconstitutional. [Words 
indistinct] his actions as head of this court, the highest in 
the country in charge of constitutional matters. 
  It has been a hard blow for me personally. I appreciated him 
greatly; we were friends. And from the institutional point of 
view, as president I regretted his death from the moment I 
learned of it. I was not in the capital but I ordered the 
necessary investigations and we hope there is sufficient 
evidence to locate the criminals. We do not have the words to 
express our sorrow. We cannot understand how it could have 
happened to a person who loved peace and freedom for which he 
fought. 
  Once again the Guatemalan family has to deal with an act of 
violence. Guatemala is going through difficult moments from the 
point of view of citizen's security and the government is 
willing to take all the necessary measures to restrain this wave 
of violence, which is adversely affecting all social classes. As 
we said in the beginning, this is something for which we cannot 
find the necessary words to explain [words indistinct] no matter 
from where it comes. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [De Leon] We do not know yet. The truth is that [words 
indistinct] enough evidence. Today the Government Ministry, 
through its experts, will reveal details of the unfortunate 
incident. We cannot confirm or rule out anything [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [De Leon] We do not really know what the reason was [words 
indistinct]. [end recording] 
  The president said that up until now, this incident could 
not 
be described as a political crime, but that at 1600 [2200 GMT] 
the Government Ministry will reveal the results of the 
preliminary investigation.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Public Relations Secretariat of </F>
the Presidency in Guatemala City on 2 April -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has said the 
government of the Republic hereby condemns the murder of Chief 
Justice Eduardo Epaminondas Gonzalez, president of the 
Constitutionality Court [CC], and has ordered an exhaustive 
investigation into the incident. The president said he was a 
close friend of the slain attorney, for whom he had great 
respect. The president was appalled by this undescribable crime, 
which has caused him great consternation. Such feelings are most 
surely shared by the people of Guatemala. 
  We began an investigation as soon as we learned the news, 
the 
president added, assigning the case to the best investigative 
specialists available to the security forces. De Leon Carpio 
said the investigative teams have instructions to use all 
resources at their disposal to capture the perpetrators. De Leon 
added Gonzalez' death means the loss of a model Guatemalan 
citizen, a jurist of renowned prestige, and a true defender of 
democracy and peace. De Leon recalled that Justice Gonzalez, as 
CC president, played a leading role last year by enacting the 
resolutions that restored constitutional order following the 
events of 25 May. 
  In condemning this crime, De Leon stated, the government 
reaffirms its determination to press on with its efforts to 
establish an atmosphere of security and coexistence in 
Guatemala. He concluded by expressing his condolences to 
Gonzalez' family, as well as his fellow justices, CC officials, 
and administrative personnel, wishing them forbearance in this 
moment of tragedy.

<F P=106> [Communique Issued by the Supreme Court read by Justice Juan </F>
Jose Rodil Peralta in Guatemala City on 2 April; from the 
"Patrullaje Informativo" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] Supreme Court Justice Juan Jose Rodil Peralta has 
condemned the murder of Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon: 
  [Begin Rodil recording] You are going to be the first to 
know 
this information. The Supreme Court is drafting a communique, 
and I am going it to read to you. You will be the first media 
source to have it. The communique states the following: 
  The presidency of the judicial branch, representing the 
Supreme Court of Justice, has heard with astonishment and 
indignation of the vile assassination of Constitutional Court 
President Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon. We manifest our strong 
condemnation and aversion for this sad occurrence, which 
directly attacks the state of law and the legal regime. To 
silence with bullets the voice of the leading authority in the 
defense of our Constitution directly attacks the state of law 
and the legal regime, the basic supports of our democratic life, 
and, in essence, negatively affects all Guatemalans. 
  We state this vile and cowardly action clearly shows the 
vandals and assassins, who caused bloodshed in Guatemala in the 
past, are active and are now attempting to destroy the 
Guatemalan democratic process again and, with it, the defense of 
human rights and the demands for social justice for the 
Guatemalans who live between violence and poverty. The murder of 
the president of the Constitutionality Court threatens, in 
essence, freedom in Guatemala. 
  We demand the government of the Republic, headed by 
President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio, immediately implement each and every 
measures established in the Constitution to safeguard the state 
of law and the legal regime, which are being threatened as never 
before in the current Guatemalan democratic process. At the 
same time, it must order all civilian and military investigation 
offices, which the state controls, to direct all their efforts 
to determine promptly and efficiently the truth of the events so 
that the material and intellectual authors of Epaminondas 
Gonzalez Dubon's murder can be punished in an exemplary manner 
and with all the weight of the law. 
  With great sadness and pain, we send our heartfelt 
condolences to Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon's relatives and hope 
they will find acceptance in our Christian values. 
  This is the Supreme Court of Justice communique, which we 
are finishing right now and giving "Patrullaje Informativo" as a 
scoop. [end recording]

The second point is very important. The Constitutional Court 
warns authorities to refrain from labeling the crime a priority 
before concluding the investigations because this [words

victim's outstanding honor. Third, it expresses its sincere 
condolences to Gonzalez' relatives, and fourth it will send a

<F P=106> [Report by Lucia Dubon from the "News Patrol" newscast] </F>
  [Text] We are starting to receive the first reactions from 
the political world to the murder of Constitutionality Court 
President Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon. We now have statements 
from National Congress President Vinicio Villar Anleu condemning 
the murder. 
  [Begin Villar recording] That is correct. In all actuality, 
once more, we must condemn these violent incidents taking place 
in our country. We are not just condemning the violent act 
against Constitutionality Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez, 
but acts aganst any human being, any Guatemalan. 
  I believe we are still living in a time in which all 
Guatemalans must reflect, ponder, and try to live in a state of 
law where the law will be respected over everything else, and I 
think we must not take the law into our own hands. This is a 
very unfortunate incident. As National Congress president, I 
would like to take the opportunity to express my condolences to 
the relatives of Mr. Epaminondas Gonzalez, and most naturally to 
all of Guatemala for these violent incidents we are experiencing 
-- all of which are very unfortunate. 
  Events like this leave a lot to be desired from a country 
seeking to progress through understanding and dialogue. We 
oppose this unfortunate act and we strongly condemn it. At the 
same time, we call on the executive branch to put a stop to this 
rise in criminal activity and to acts of violence against 
Guatemala's political and professional sectors. We regret what 
has happened and hope the government can rapidly clarify, as is 
done in other countries, the origins of this act, of this 
violent death that befell the president of the Constitutionality 
Court. [end recording]

part of the crime prevention operation to provide security for 
the Guatemalans traveling into the city from various points 
around the countryside. 
  Police, the Treasury Guard, and the Guatemalan Army are 
guarding access routes. No abnormal activity has been reported; 
everything is under control. Military personnel have been 
assigned to assist the police, and the Treasury Guard is 
checking those coming in from the countryside or leaving 
Guatemala City via one of the main access routes. 
  We have also learned military units are controlling the main 
entrance routes, specifically Puente de Belize, Incienso, and El 
Trebol, as well as key electricity high-tension pylons in the 
capital city, as prevention measures against terrorism. We 
hereby inform Guatemalans there is nothing abnormal going on in 
the country. The military personnel are assisting with security 
for those moving in an out of the city.

  [Text] Mexico City, 3 Apr (DPA) -- Today, the Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity [URNG] condemned the assassination 
of Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon, president of the Guatemalan 
Constitutionality Court. The URNG said this "abominable 
incident" undermines the human rights agreement signed with the 
government. According to a URNG communique published in Mexico 
City, the magistrate's assassination "bluntly reveals the 
opposition that exists within government sectors, particularly 
within the Army, to the Global Agreement on Human Rights," which 
was signed in Mexico City on 29 March. 
  Gonzalez Dubon died in the early hours of 2 April as a 
result 
of an attack in downtown Guatemala City by several unidentified 
men who shot him while he was driving home. Police have called 
the attack an "apparent robbery attempt," but several prominent 
members of the political and legal professions pointed to death 
squads as possible culprits. 
  In its communique, the URNG said the assassination of the 
Constitutional Court president "is aimed at limiting the role of 
the people, which had been opened by the aforementioned 
agreement in the area of human rights." The communique added: 
"It is important for the government of President Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio and the Guatemalan Army to completely fulfill without 
delay the promises made to the Guatemalan people and the United 
Nations as the only way to uproot repression, assassination, and 
barbaric acts from our fatherland." 
  The URNG also demanded that the security corps and the 
Guatemalan Army be purged "of the assassins opposed to peace and 
human rights" and deemed that "thorough measures, not just 
publicity and cosmetic measures," are needed. Meanwhile, the 
guerrillas also called on the United Nations, the mediator in 
the peace talks between the government and the URNG, to send a 
preparatory mission for the verification of human rights to 
Guatemala "without delay" as established in the agreements 
signed in Mexico City.

  [Excerpt] Guatemala City, 2 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- [passage 
omitted] The hope for peace in Guatemala seems to fade with the 
murder of Chief Justice Eduardo Epaminondas Gonzalez, president 
of the country's highest constitutional authority, during the 
predawn hours of Holy Saturday. Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge 
Mario Garcia Laguardia said the murder is a "national absurdity" 
perpetrated by "savages" who have dealt a heavy blow against the 
Constitutionality Court. He expressed regret such actions could 
occur when there "seemed" to be hope for peace in the country, 
following the signing of the human rights agreements between the 
government and the guerrillas. He demanded the authorities find 
and punish the guilty. 
  Holy Week ceremonies have also seen attacks against a cousin 
of former President Jorge Serrano Elias and journalist Marco 
Tulio Roca, the murder of a street child, and the lynching of a 
U.S. tourist. The Catholic Church has asked Guatemalans not to 
"falter" in this wave of violence and impunity, and has asked 
the government to seriously face the task of attaining peace.

<F P=106> [Communique from the Government Ministry and the National </F>
Police on the murder of Constitutionality Court President 
Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon; issued in Guatemala City on 3 April 
-- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Through this document, which is related to the 
events that took place in Guatemala City during the evening 
hours of Good Friday, the Government Ministry and the National 
Police hereby take the opportunity to advise the public of the 
following: 
  On 1 April 1994, in a failed vehicle robbery attempt, Mr. 
Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon, president of Guatemala's 
Constitutionality Court, was murdered in the presence of his 
wife and youngest son. 
  In condemning this villainous crime, National Police 
authorities hereby report they are already searching for the 
parties responsible for this crime in light of evidence gathered 
at the scene of the crime. The police are also receiving 
support from the Guatemalan Armed Forces. The National Police 
Criminal Investigation Department is working arduously to 
locate, in the shortest time possible, those individuals 
responsible for this crime and to turn them over to the 
appropriate courts of law. 
  Because we live in a democracy and because Mr. Gonzalez 
Dubon's activities were transparent, he readily refused to be 
escorted by security guards which, unfortunately, proved to be 
advantageous for the criminals. 
  The security forces will utilize all of their expertise in 
investigating this murder. Nevertheless, the Guatemalan 
people's cooperation is being requested to expedite the 
investigation. All Guatemalans are also urged to provide any 
evidence that may lead to identifying the murderers.

<F P=106> [Report by Lucia Dubon] </F>
  [Excerpt] A news conference by National Police spokesman 
Fernando Lopez has just concluded in the parking lot of the 2d 
Division Headquarters of the National Police. Some very 
important information was disclosed regarding the status of the 
investigation into the murder of the Constitutionality Court 
President Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon. Here are some statements 
by National Police spokesman Fernando Lopez: 
  [Begin Lopez recording] [words indistinct] members of the 
domestic and international press so that you as well as the 
Guatemalan people can get an idea of the condition in which 
Magistrate Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon's vehicle was found. 
Again, the incident took place at the intersection of Seventh 
Street and Seventh Avenue in Guatemala City's Zone 2. 
  The National Police Directorate condemns this murder and 
would like to report to the Guatemalan people that it has 
already issued instructions to the National Police Criminal 
Investigation Department to assign its best personnel to each 
and every area of this investigation. In addition, we would 
like to disclose that any developments with respect to the case 
will be immediately reported to the National Police director, 
the government minister, and to the president of the Republic. 
  As you may know, we recovered five .38 caliber bullets. This 
one was taken out of the body of Magistrate Epaminondas Gonzalez 
Dubon. This one is a fragment found inside the vehicle. As you 
can see, when it hit the car it split into [words indistinct] 
and the rest was found in the magistrate's body. This one was 
found in the door of the vehicle, and this other bullet was 
found in the [word indistinct] located in the rear. This bullet 
was found in the trunk, and this one was embedded in the 
vehicle's spare tire. 
  These five bullets correspond to the five shots fired at the 
vehicle. When we combed the area, we discovered a .45 caliber 
bullet that has nothing to do with the bullets that hit the 
magistrate's car. This bullet was found approximately 50 meters 
from the site where the .38 caliber bullets were found. By 
looking at the car, you can see these three impacts [words 
indistinct]. The only bullet to hit the magistrate was this one, 
and, according to reports, it entered the left side of his 
chest, and this was what caused his death. 
  In terms of national security, we would like to report that 
[words indistinct] to locate those individuals responsible. The 
National Police also are requesting cooperation from the 
Guatemalan people, urging them to provide any information which 
might help us solve this case. Their assistance will be 
well-received because it will help us locate the people 
responsible for this crime. [end recording] 
  These were statements by National Police spokesman Fernando 
Lopez, who condemned this gruesome crime and noted that National 
Police authorities are already searching for those responsible 
for this crime based on evidence gathered at the scene of the 
crime. The police spokesman also disclosed that the country's 
security forces are cooperating in solving this case. This 
includes the Guatemalan Armed Forces. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Guatemala City, 2 Apr (DPA) -- The slaying of 
Constitutionality Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon is 
not an isolated incident, much less a common crime, 
personalities we have consulted have told DPA. [passage 
omitted] Meanwhile, Supreme Court President Juan Jose Rodil 
Peralta issued a strong statement condemning the killing, which 
adversely affects the state of law in Guatemala. Rodil Peralta 
added this killing demonstrates those responsible for numerous 
acts of violence in the past are still on the loose. 
  Gonzalez Dubon's wife, the main witness to the killing, said 
she does not believe the motive of the killing was a car theft, 
as certain versions have reported. She added there was no 
attempt to steal the car, and the assailants unloaded their 
weapons into the car, damaging it badly. 
  According to another version, unidentified gunmen were 
following Gonzalez, who tried to take shelter in his home, where 
they reached him. Apparently, police protection at the victim's 
home had been withdrawn due to the recent change of the interior 
minister. Gonzalez' body was taken to a funeral parlor, where 
several people have come to express their condolences, including 
lawyers, former magistrates, and other Guatemalan political 
personalities. Gonzalez's funeral was scheduled for tomorrow, 
after being honored at the Constitutionality Court.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 3 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Guatemalan 
President Ramiro De Leon Carpio announced he might declare a 
state of emergency as result of the murder of Constitutionality 
Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez in the next few days. De 
Leon made the announcement during the funeral services of one of 
the country's most distinguished legal experts. The murder, 
which was carried out early yesterday by unknown gunmen, has 
been condemned by all sectors of the country. The president 
acknowledged that he has considered the possibility of declaring 
a state of emergency but that the measure will have to be 
approved this week by the State Council of Ministers. 
  On Friday, Government Minister Danilo Parinello announced 
that a possible state of emergency declaration is being reviewed 
as result of numerous crimes, attacks, and disturbances taking 
place throughout the country and threatening to become a 
national catastrophe. Last week, journalist Marco Tulio de la 
Roca was shot and, as result, lost his left eye. In addition, 
Francisco Elias, the cousin of former President Jorge Elias 
Serrano, was also shot and remains in serious conditions at a 
private hospital. There was also the recent murder of a 
so-called "street child" and a mob attacked an American citizen 
in the northern community of San Cristobal Verapaz, after being 
accused of attempting to abduct a small boy. Another American 
tourist was fired on for no apparent reason by a group of 
unknown individuals on a Guatemala City street. 
  Gonzalez's murder has disturbed the country's judicial, 
union, government, church, and diplomatic communities, which 
believe the murder will become just another of the countless 
crimes that go unpunished in this Central American nation. 
  Yesterday, De Leon announced he had ordered an in-depth 
investigation to locate the murderers of the Constitutionality 
Court magistrate, whom he described as an "outstanding citizen, 
prestigious jurist, and an authentic advocate of democracy and 
peace in Guatemala." This past July, however, when the 
president's cousin Jorge Carpio Nicolle, editor of EL GRAFICO 
newspaper and secretary general of the Union of the National 
Center party [UCN], was murdered, De Leon appointed a special 
commission to investigate the crime, which to date has failed to 
accomplish anything. The Catholic Church and Carpio Nicolle's 
relatives, who were present when the journalist was murdered 
along with three other people, insist that the murder was 
carried out by the paramilitary Civilian Sel-Defense Patrols 
(PAC), but the authorities have dismissed these claims. 
  The archbishop of Guatemala and the human rights ombudsman 
have said it is De Leon's moral duty to solve the Gonzalez 
murder, which occurred just 10 days before Gonzalez was to 
conclude his term as Constitutional Court president. He was 
killed four days after the court had ruled that 
Congress-approved reforms to the Electoral and Political Parties 
Law were unconstitutional. Gonzalez had argued that the deputies 
not only modified the law but, in fact, created a new law. He 
ruled that this was illegal because the Electoral and Political 
Parties Law can only be repealed by a national constituent 
assembly. 
  The reforms are aimed at increasing the number of 
congressional deputies as well as establishing that any party 
that does not field candidates in an election for deputies 
should be taken off the official political parties list. 
Moreover, the congressional deputies affected by the new law 
rejected the independence of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and 
opened the way for civic committees to participate in the 
election process. 
  The new election law also required the resignation of all 
political party members holding government positions and whose 
leader occupied the Presidency [alta magistratura], and also 
changed name of the new law to the "Election and People's 
Organization Law [Ley Electoral y de Organizationces Populares]." 
  Gonzalez presided over the Constitutionality Court when it 
ruled against the 25 May 1993 "self-inflicted coup" carried out 
by then-President Jorge Serrano. The court's decision proved 
decisive in reestablishing constitutional order in Guatemala.

<F P=106> [Report by Julita Corrado] </F>
  Text] The Mutual Support Group [GAM] has issued a 
communique denouncing and lamenting the assassination of 
Epaminondas Gonzalez, saying this crime highlights the perilous 
conditions under which the population is living, as well as the 
government's unwillingness and inability to find solutions. 
Although it is likely a state of emergency will be declared, 
GAM believes this will only worsen the situation. 
  The assassination of the Constitutionality Court president 
is 
a harsh blow against the institutional and constitutional order 
that prevails in Guatemala because the Constitutionality Court 
is the guarantor of rights in Guatemala. The GAM pointed out 
that it believes militant sectors may have ordered and carried 
out Gonzalez's assassination, thereby employing violence and 
impunity in response to the recent signing of the human rights 
agreement to prevent the creation of the Truth Commission and to 
hinder the subsequent signing of a fair and democratic peace 
agreement. 
  The GAM communique concludes by asking the president and 
security authorities to readily and resolutely investigate this 
unofficial execution. Such an investigation will lead us to the 
whereabouts and identities of the perpetrators and masterminds 
of this crime. These people must be prosecuted to establish a 
precedent of stopping impunity in the country and to prevent the 
Epaminondas Gonzalez case from joining the already long list of 
unsolved crimes.

<F P=106> [Interview with new Government Minister Danilo Parrinello </F>
Blanco by Jeovany Ibanez; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Ibanez] Why did you accept the appointment of 
government minister at a time when the country is experiencing a 
political, economic, and social crisis, which in turn has led to 
a complete lack of security? 
  [Parrinello] Because I am optimistic and feel certain that 
we 
can do something for Guatemala. I am aware of the responsibility 
I assumed and know that a difficult task awaits me. We must be 
realistic, however. We know we cannot fully resolve the 
security problem, but we can lay the groundwork for society to 
walk the path of justice. We must struggle to recover the values 
we have lost -- ethics, respect for the family, church, and 
homeland. We Guatemalans need a reassessment of moral values. It 
is a difficult process, but it must be started soon. I have been 
given an opportunity and I am determined to use it. 
  [Ibanez] Why do you think you can succeed where many others 
have failed? 
  [Parrinello] I trust myself and my team. Ortiz Moscoso had 
good intentions, but he is the one who should talk about why he 
failed. We will show, with short-term results, that we can 
provide the security Guatemalans desire. For this reason, I have 
outlined an emergency plan to be put into effect within the next 
60 days. We will see what happens after that date. 
  [Ibanez] What methods will you use to attain results and 
what 
experience do you have in security matters? 
  [Parrinello] I have used my first days in office to organize 
a full team, which includes National Police [PN] directors, 
immigration officials, and Finance Police, two deputy ministers, 
and several advisers to outline strategies to fight crime. The 
team complements the plan I have already mentioned. Regarding 
your second question, I have prepared myself for the post of 
government minister, not for PN director. I have taken courses 
related to security issues in the United States and Brazil. 
  [Ibanez] Security is a universal demand. How do you intend 
to 
meet this nationwide need? 
  [Parrinello] We are aware of a great lack of security, which 
has created a climate of instability and led people to mistrust 
the authorities. My most important role at this time, however, 
is to restore social order. I am certain that, with the 
creation of the Immediate Reaction Platoon, which will be an 
elite PN group initially comprising 300 men, we will fight crime 
better. We will work vigorously and in some cases employ 
reasonable uses of force. Also, an investigation section will be 
created, which will operate independently from the PN's Criminal 
Investigations Department. 
  A special remanding unit, which will try to prevent judges 
from releasing criminals because of police errors, will also be 
created. Respect for human rights and compliance with the law 
are part of my principles, and I intend to stick to them while 
in office. Nevertheless, I will also use all available resources 
and mechanisms to prevent crime. We are determined to raise the 
status of the police to one of dignity. In exchange, we will 
demand that the police make a commitment to the people. As for 
weapons, patrol cars, and other equipment, we will update these 
to curb crime. 
  [Ibanez] How do you intend to carry out these plans 
considering there is not an adequate budget to fund programs of 
this kind? 
  [Parrinello] It is true that a shortage of resources is one 
of our greatest problems. Nevertheless, I not only have the 
president of the Republic's backing, but I also have been 
offered economic support from private sector representatives 
willing to cooperate with the government. This support 
represents a mutual benefit. This is why we will create a kind 
of patronage or committee to manage the funds we will collect. 
In addition, we will seek advice on security matters. 
Meanwhile, we will do our best with whatever we have. Also, we 
will ask the government to allocate the necessary funds so 
people can have a PN that truly offers protection. 
  [Ibanez] People do not trust the police. How will you change 
this image? 
  [Parrinello] We are aware of this. For this reason, we do 
not 
intend to reorganize it but to start a program to purge it, 
whereby police officials involved in corruption will be fired 
and tried. For this purpose, I have appointed a PN director who 
will be responsible for initiating the appropriate proceedings. 
Nevertheless, we must be realistic and admit that we do not have 
a magical formula to purge the PN. 
  [Ibanez] How do you explain the appointment of a military 
officer as deputy minister in charge of security? Does this 
appointment represent the establishment of a hard-line in the 
Government Ministry? 
  [Parrinello] I want to be very clear on Colonel Merida's 
appointment. In relation to his appointment, there was no 
pressure and there will be none in any other appointment I might 
make. I nominated him because he is a very good friend of mine, 
because I have confirmed that he is truly a security expert, and 
because he will contribute all of his expertise to eradicating 
crime. As for the hard line, I am willing to do a good job. 
This means I will act with a heavy hand, but according to law 
so no one can violate the Guatemalan people's rights.

  [Text] San Jose, 24 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- The Judicial 
Investigation Agency reports that Costa Rican police dealt two 
harsh blows to international drug trafficking in two separate 
operations this weekend. Initial investigations indicate that 
the drug operations were linked to one of Colombia's most 
violent cartels, the Pereira Cartel. 
  Police attribute the trafficking of 720 kg of cocaine from 
Colombia to Europe to one gang and report that another gang is 
responsible for illegally introducing 180 kg of heroin into the 
United States this year. The authorities claim that with the 
capture of five Colombians, one Costa Rican, one Dominican, and 
one U.S. citizen, they have broken a connection to the Pereira 
Cartel, an organization that grew after the fall of Pablo 
Escobar and which police consider to be one of the most violent 
of its kind. 
  The cocaine traffickers, Colombian citizens Luis Diez Diez 
and Moises Nader Vargas and Costa Rican citizen Carlos Alvarado, 
were arrested on charges of possessing 10 kg of cocaine 
following months of investigation and 24-hour surveillance that 
began the day the entry register of foreigners into Costa Rica 
through Juan Santamaria Airport was scrutinized, eight days 
before their arrest. Alvarado was under surveillance for two 
years under suspicion of being an international drug trafficking 
ring's contact in Costa Rica. 
  Elsewhere, 2.5 kg of heroin destined for the United States 
was seized in Costa Rica after evading Colombian, Panamanian, 
and Costa Rican customs agents when one of the "mules" 
(carriers) had a drug-filled packet rupture in his stomach. This 
was the lead that led narcotics agents to the other members of 
an international gang that was using Costa Rica as a 
transshipment bridge. 
  Juan Tribino, a Colombian citizen, was hospitalized in a 
state of shock Sunday night in Alajuela -- a city 25 miles north 
of the capital -- where it was determined he was suffering from 
a heroin overdose. Although in a coma, Tribaldo defecated five 
packets containing drugs, which prompted doctors to notify 
narcotics police. The other members of the gang were identified 
as Fernando Ramirez and Claudia Cardoze, both from Colombia; 
Geovanny Ferrer of the Dominican Republic; and U.S. citizen 
Felix Lopez. Tribino remains in critical condition in Alajuela 
hospital, while the rest of the drug traffickers are under 
arrest and charged with international drug trafficking. 
  Costa Rican Security Minister Luis Fishman said drug 
traffickers recruit young men in his country to transport the 
drug to different parts of Europe. He added that 16 Costa 
Ricans currently imprisoned in Europe could be contacts for this 
gang. Ten of them are in Spain, three in the Netherlands, and 
the rest are either serving terms or waiting to be sentenced in 
Germany, Belgium, France, and Italy. None of them had previous 
criminal records. 
  Although unconfirmed by authorities, judicial sources have 
confirmed to ACAN-EFE that the interrogations and investigations 
show the Pereira Cartel is very active in Costa Rica and has a 
number of connections. According to these sources each 
connection only has enough information to work within a specific 
organization. In case they are arrested, they cannot be linked 
to other drug traffickers or the rest of the network.

  [Excerpts] A new poll conducted by Ibope [Brazilian Public 
Opinion and Statistics Institute] reveals how Brazilians would 
vote if the presidential elections were held today. 
  The poll took into account three different candidates for 
the 
PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] because the party has 
not yet elected its presidential candidate. 
  According to Ibope if the elections were held today, Workers 
Party candidate Inacio Lula Da Silva would be in first place 
with 33 percent of the votes. Former Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] 
would be in second place with 14 percent. Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo 
Maluf of the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] would be in third 
place with 10 percent. Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola of 
the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] would be fourth with 8 percent, 
and Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes of the PFL [Liberal 
Front Party] would be fifth with 5 percent. If the PMDB 
candidate were former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia, he 
would be in sixth place with 4 percent. Flavio Rocha of the 
Liberal Party would be seventh with 1 percent. The undecided, 
blank, and null votes would be 25 percent. [passage omitted] 
  If Senator Jose Sarney were the candidate of the PMDB, Luis 
Inacio Lula da Silva would still be in first place with 30 
percent of the votes. Former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso would keep second place with 13 percent of the votes. 
Jose Sarney would be in third place with 11 percent of the 
votes. Mayor Paulo Maluf would be fourth with 10 percent. 
Governor Leonel Brizola would be fifth with 7 percent. Governor 
Antonio Carlos Magalhaes would be sixth with 5 percent. Flavio 
Rocha would be seventh with 1 percent. The undecided, blank and 
null votes would be 23 percent. 
  The Ibope poll does not show what the results would be if 
Governor of Parana Roberto Requiao runs for the PMDB. 
  The poll also shows the people's preferences after Sao Paulo 
Mayor Paulo Maluf withdrew from the race. Maluf's decision to 
withdraw, made in Sao Paulo yesterday afternoon, led Ibope to 
conduct another poll. The following are the first four 
candidates: 
  According to Ibope if the elections were held today Luis 
Inacio Lula da Silva would continue to lead with 37 percent of 
the votes. Former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
would be second with 19 perecent. Governor Leonel Brizola would 
be third with 10 perecent, and former Governor Orestes Quercia 
would be fourth with 6 percent. The undecided, blank, and null 
votes would be 28 percent. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Air General Ramon Vega Hidalgo, Chilean Air </F>
Force, FACh, commander in chief, by reporter Maria Eugenia 
Oyarzun "yesterday on the occasion of the 64th anniversary of 
the Air Force" at the Armed Forces building in Santiago] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Oyarzun] Does the FACh have 
deterrent power? 
  [Vega] During the past 64 years the Air Force commanders' 
main concern has been to provide the Air Force with effective 
deterrent power. It is not just the Air Force but the nation's 
air power as a whole. This is what Arturo Merino Benitez [one 
of the founders of the FACh] envisaged when he established LAN 
[Chilean National Airline], the Main Hangars, and the Chilean 
Air Club, long before founding the FACh. The development of 
aeronautics is intertwined with the economic development of the 
nation. We canot expect to have the kind of air force developed 
countries have because there are priorities which have to do 
with social needs that must be taken care of. Within these 
limitations the FACh has an excellent professional team of 
outstanding potential in terms of human resources which are 
scientifically trained and know their job inside out. Within 
this context the FACh is technically and professionally a first 
class organization. 
  [Oyarzun] Was the Hunter plane purchased in 1968 later 
modified in Chile? 
  [Vega] Yes, it has been modified. We added several systems 
which made this plane more versatile and gave it some 
capabilities it did not have before. This plane was used to 
train more than half of the FACh personnel. 
  [Oyarzun] What is the current status of the National 
Aeronautical Enterprise (Enaer)? 
  [Vega] Enaer started operating under the military 
government. 
General Matthei [Fernando Matthei Aubel, former FACh commander] 
was the driving force behind the establishment of a national 
aeronautical industry. The initial steps were difficult because 
the aeronautical industry is complex, dynamic and amazingly 
prone to changes. This means that technicians, managers, and 
workers must keep up with these changes. An air force cannot 
remain in the past, it must be modern or else it is no air 
force. The need for such fast changes and technology requires 
excellent human resources because planes do not stay up in the 
air through magic but because man wants them to. Planes pose 
several requirements which means that those who operate them 
must be up-to-date on the technology in their hands. Thus, 
Enaer cannot stop working and neither can the very sophisticated 
DTS [Desarrollo de Tecnologias y Sistemas Limitada -- 
Technologies and Systems Development Ltd.] company specialized 
in avionics. All this means that we have to have a plane which 
will be more or less up-to-date bearing in mind that our 
technology cannot be similar to that of the United State or 
other developed countries, but in keeping with national 
priorities. 
  [Oyarzun] It has always been said that the Air Force is in 
the third place after the Army and the Navy. In today's wars 
which is more important, the Army, the Navy, or the Air Force? 
  [Vega] All three branches must be tightly coordinated and 
act 
in unison. The three are interdependent. This means that the 
three braches must develop at the same rate and plan along the 
same lines. The Armed Forces are a system whose subsystems must 
all have the same quality. 
  [Oyarzun] United? 
  [Vega] Total coordination and unity is essential. That is 
how Chile's Armed Forces do things. 
  [Oyarzun] Have they always been united? 
  [Vega] Always. The Army and the Navy gave the Air Force its 
start. We inherited the ranking system, discipline and uniforms 
from the Army. The star on the tail of our planes is the Navy 
star and the shield on the wings of our planes is the Navy 
shield. The Air Force has been fully integrated with the other 
branches of service from the very beginning. As of 1930 the 
FACh began moving toward autonomy because the technology, 
strategy, and doctrine applicable to this branch of service are 
different and so is the approach to the building up of 
capability. 
  [Oyarzun] All this costs money... 
  [Vega] Every action or movement in life has a cost. I 
believe that the point is knowing how to establish priorities 
for spending and how to direct the funds available to the 
fulfillment of objectives that can help each institution carry 
out its mission. There will never be enough funds and there will 
always be more needs than resources available, even in the U.S. 
Air Force. 
  [Oyarzun] There are politicians who believe that the Armed 
Forces budget should be cut because "no military conflicts are 
expected" in the short or medium term, and because from looking 
at the overall international scenario, the phantom of war seems 
to be fading away. Do you agree with them? 
  [Vega] Your question is very interesting. I do not reject 
outright any opinion, but one does not build an air force from 
one day to another. It takes years to build up operational 
effectiveness, train technicians, develop the infrastructure and 
the quality which is necessary to operate sophisticated 
materiel. An air force cannot become obsolete, it should either 
be maintained up-to-date or disappear. If it is no longer there 
one day, there is no room for improvisation. It takes years to 
train workers, pilots, mechanics, technicians, and to set up the 
logistic support for the highly sophisticated systems that an 
air force operates nowadays. There may be no conflict in sight, 
but no one can say for sure what will happen tomorrow. We have 
dramatic examples of what could happen. Perhaps a huge 
ideological east-west conflict is no longer likely, but regional 
conflicts are certainly possible. 
  [Oyarzun] Why do you say so? 
  [Vega] Because whenever regional interests are at stake 
there 
could be conflicts. We can see it in Yugoslavia and in many 
other parts of the world where they may be latent -- whether 
valid or not it is not for me to say -- but sometimes lead to 
the use of force. I would not like this to happen in our region. 
I believe that we have taken the course of reasonable regional 
understanding and the Latin American countries have taken an 
unprecedented approach. 
  I agree that there is a new approach to development methods 
which does not necessarily mean that there are no conflicts. It 
is impossible to prepare for conflicts from one day to another 
and it is the responsibility of the Air Force leadership to 
prepare the branch as best they can with the funds available for 
this. [passage omitted] 
  [Oyarzun] Did the FACh contribute to Chile's development 
during the military government? 
  [Vega] I believe that it is not easy to quantify the 
results, 
but undoubtedly Chile is a very modern country, one that has 
prestige both domestically and abroad. This all began after 
1973. 
  [Oyarzun] Some people claim that the Armed Forces did not do 
enough for national reconciliation during President Patricio 
Aylwin's administration. What do you think? 
  [Vega] I do not engage in political discussions, all I can 
do 
is voice an opinion. Chile is moving along amid widespread 
reconciliation. I have reached this conclusion on the basis of 
the opinions of politicians of different leanings and the 
motivation with which Chile is working and developing. 
  [Oyarzun] The Eighth International Airspace Fair [Fidae] 
opened on the occasion of the 64th anniversary of the FACh. Is 
there anything that sets this year's Fidae apart from those of 
preceding years? 
  [Vega] Just as Chile as a whole, the Fidae has experienced 
spectacular growth. Since technologically speaking our country 
is far behind the highly developed nations, the FACh is making a 
great effort to bring some of this technology down here. Not 
everyone around here can get a close look at high technology. 
The Fidae allows us to bring this technology to Chile. 
  [Oyarzun] Why do so many foreigners attend the Fidae? 
  [Vega] Because Chile's current image is excellent. It is a 
developing country clearly on its way up, and capable of 
becoming a developed country in the short term. There is no 
show like this anywhere else in South America, and I believe 
that it offers an excellent opportunity to display all the 
aeronautic technology available. I do not mean just planes and 
arms. The Fidae's strong point is that it displayes everything 
that has to do with aeronautic technology. All countries need a 
meeting place and this is an attractive one. 
  [Oyarzun] What does Fidae show? 
  [Vega] Aerospace technology. 
  [Oyarzun] What does this technology include? 
  [Vega] We would like to have a complete array of space 
technology items. It has not been easy but there are some 
interesting things. Russia is participating for the first time. 
  [Oyarzun] What can Russia contribute at this point? 
  [Vega] The Russian Academy of Sciences is the oldest in the 
world. Their level of development in rocketry, satellites, 
communications and aeronautic technology is very high. 
  [Oyarzun] Haven't they become obsolete? 
  [Vega] Russia has had a temporary setback, but I believe 
that 
their scientific potential is still there. They will have to 
streamline their production systems and their companies after 
the drastic changes they have undergone. They will have to find 
new ways to produce goods, that is not an easy task. They will 
have to redesign a number of systems taking into account new 
economic and production conditions, but I believe that they will 
find their way. The Fidae is an important meeting; 400 companies 
and 36 countries are participating. [passage omitted] 
  [Oyarzun] How did the Air Force fare during the four years 
after the end of the military government? I am asking this 
question because you seem to have managed to keep out of the 
conflicts... 
  [Vega] It is not that I do not want to answer your questions 
on politics; it is simply not appropriate for me to do so. I 
love my fatherland, and I have tried to serve it from this 
position that has been entrusted to me. I never expected to 
become the Air Force commander in chief. As a Chilean citizen I 
believe that this has been an extraordinary stage in Chilean 
history. It has been very positive, with pros and cons as any 
endeavor is bound to have. In any conflict among human beings 
each one tries to make his own legitimate interests prevail. 
Overall, Chile has moved steadily, calmly, and confidently 
forward on the wings of an exceptional development. 
  [Oyarzun] What do you expect from the newly installed 
administration? 
  [Vega] I do not believe that there will be any substantial 
changes. Steps will be taken to improve this positive 
development of ours. We have set a very stable course and all 
Chileans -- regardless of their political and personal interests 
-- are making a significant contribution to the nation's 
development. 
  [Oyarzun] What is the status of the FACh on its 64th 
anniversary? 
  [Vega] Good. It is surprising how many people join the FACh 
because of their inclinations! The results of this year's draft 
were very good. I admire the energy and knowledge that the new 
generations have. 
  [Oyarzun] A person who joins the Air Force knows that he 
will 
make less than he could as an independent professional in 
private business. What prompts people to join? 
  [Vega] Not all human beings aim at material achievements. 
Many people join the FACh because they have a calling, and they 
follow their instincts. The people who join the FACh do so 
because they have a calling, like the people who get involved in 
arts. 
  [Oyarzun] What effect will the Chilean Copper Corporation's 
[Codelco] loss of $206 million have on the FACh? 
  [Vega] It will have no effect on us this year, next year I 
do 
not know how much it will impact on our budget. We have a 
budget established by law and we operate within the framework of 
this budget. We streamline and rearrange our priorities in 
order to do our yearly programming... Institutionally speaking 
I would say that Codelco's loss will have no effect on us. 
  [Oyarzun] It is not like you can spare the money... 
  [Vega] One never has money to spare, especially in the case 
of small air forces like ours. Our budgets have been cut and 
are relatively small for the kind of technology we are operating 
with. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 1 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- U.S. citizen 
Ramon Rissin, the Summer Linguistic Institute's security chief, 
has been kidnapped by guerrillas in Meta Department in southern 
Colombia, military sources confirmed today. The Army's 7th 
Brigade reported that Rissin was relaxing at a resort hacienda 
in Puerto Lleras, some 300 km from Santa Fe de Bogota, when he 
was abducted by six men who identified themselves as 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC, members. 
  With Rissin's abduction, the number of U.S. citizens 
kidnapped by FARC in Meta increases to three. In January, 
guerrillas took missionaries Steve Welch and Timothy Vandykc 
hostage while at a camp near Villavicencio. 
  The Army report says that FARC political propaganda was 
found 
at the site where Rissin was taken captive. The FARC is 
Colombia's largest and oldest rebel organization. "We can 
confirm Rissin's kidnapping, but we do not know the reasons for 
it," a 7th Brigade source said. He added that a special 
operation was mounted in the area to try to find Rissin. 
  On 3 March, National Liberation Army, ELN, guerrillas 
released, safe and sound, U.S. citizen Manning Lowis, who had 
been taken captive in the jungle of Choco Department, on the 
border with Panama, one year earlier. The FARC and ELN are part 
of the Simon Bolivar Coordinating Guerrilla Board, CGSB, which 
two years ago abandoned the peace negotiations with the 
Colombian Government in Tlaxcala, Mexico.

  [Text] Lima, 31 Mar (EFE) -- Peruvian Justice Minister 
Fernando Vega Santa Gadea described as "inconsistent" a report 
by a commission of international jurists led by U.S. attorney 
Robert Goldman that criticizes the Peruvian administration of 
justice. 
  On 24 March Goldman informed Minister Vega that on 31 March 
he was going to release the report on "the administration of 
justice in Peru," which was prepared by the Goldman Commission 
after a three-day visit to Peru in 1993. 
  In a letter to Goldman disseminated today, Vega denies 
Goldman's contention that the Goldman report has been released 
"at the request of the Peruvian Government." 
  Vega states that in the face of repeated requests by the 
U.S. 
Government "it was agreed" to allow a team of jurists led by 
Goldman to visit Peru to learn about the Peruvian administration 
of justice. 
  Vega adds that he has not asked the Goldman Commission for 
any report and that the U.S. Embassy in Lima has noted that the 
commission of jurists "has received this task from the State 
Department." 
  These remarks, Vega says, should not be construed as a 
refusal by the Peruvian Government to have U.S. jurists come to 
Peru to learn about its justice system. He adds: "Yet, to 
accept an analysis which criticizes the current legal system, 
and which contains warnings and drastic recommendations that 
should be applied immediately is an altogether different thing." 
  In his letter, Vega states that spending three days 
analyzing 
the Peruvian legal reality causes the report to be "so 
superficial that most of its conclusions and recommendations are 
only based on prejudgements and legal inconsistencies." 
  Vega adds that the report has overlooked the progress made 
in 
November 1993 in making the Peruvian antiterrorist laws more 
flexible and states that the "reformulation" of the conclusions 
to convert them into simple "suggestions" reflects "the low 
degree of seriousness with which the original report was 
conceived." 
  Vega "categorically" denies Goldman's allegation that he had 
informed him that the commission was going to prepare a report 
on the administration of justice in Peru.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 2 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Constitutionality 
Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez was killed this morning by 
a group of unidentified gunmen who shot him as he entered his 
home, a local radio station reported today. 
  Sources close to the Gonzalez family said the magistrate was 
attacked this morning in the downtown Zona Dos neighborhood of 
the capital a few blocks from the National Palace as he entered 
his home. He died early this morning. Gonzalez sustained a 
fatal gunshot wound to the left side of his chest, according to 
Radio Sonora. 
  Last week the Constitutionality Court had declared the 
electoral law reforms being debated by the congressional 
deputies unconstitutional because "the reforms totally change 
the law." The reforms were agreed upon by the deputies and 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio as part of a package of reforms 
to the Constitution which was approved in the January referendum.

  [Text] Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon, president of the 
Constitutionality Court [CC] and one of the country's most 
oustanding men in recent times, was killed last night. He was 
gunned down while driving to his house on Seventh Ave., No. 750, 
Zone 2. Gonzalez Dubon, 64, was in a 1990 Mitsubishi white sedan 
with license plate No. 259-899 when two unidentified gunmen 
driving by in a red car shot him in the chest. 
  Gonzalez Dubon was rushed to the Latinoamericano Hospital. 
He 
was admitted at approximately 2255, but died at 2310. Today, his 
body was taken to the Mancia Funeral Parlor in downtown 
Guatemala City, where he will be laid out and later buried. 
  The Guatemalan state is the first to feel the (?shock) of 
Gonzalez Dubon's murder, because he was one of the country's 
most oustanding men. He was a man who was wholeheartedly devoted 
to his work in the CC, where he had shown ample signs of his 
virtue, adherence to the law, and a devotion to his work and 
family.

<F P=106> [Article by Daniel Santoro, copyright CLARIN 1994] </F>
  [Text] The announcement of the candidacy of Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria to the OAS General Secretariat on 24 
December 1993 was for various reasons a Christmas present for 
the diplomacy of President Carlos Menem. This is why, when 
Gaviria's victory was known on 27 March by 20 votes in favor and 
14 against, the Argentine Government expressed its satisfaction 
and presented Gaviria's victory as its own achievement. The 
government changed candidates three times to obtain this victory. 
  The first reason for a change was that Foreign Minister 
Guido 
Di Tella's hopes collapsed that his Radical predecessor, Dante 
Caputo, would be able to restore democracy in Haiti, and so gain 
enough political support to replace Brazilian Joao Baena Soares 
as OAS secretary general. 
  In view of this situation, the Foreign Ministry, after 
unofficially promising its support for a Venezuelan candidate, 
endorsed with little enthusiasm the candidacy of Costa Rican 
Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, after sounding out without 
success Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle and Chilean 
President Patricio Aylwin. 
  The possibilities of transforming the OAS into a regional 
institution at UN level, and incorporating the Inter-American 
Defense Council into the OAS, which was one of Di Tella's more 
valuable projects, began to disappear with Niehaus' candidacy. 
This is another reason why Gaviria's candidacy came as a gift 
from heaven. 
  Argentine sources told CLARIN that the first news about the 
bold step taken by Gaviria -- it was the first time that a 
president in office was a candidate -- was learned by the 
government from Argentine Ambassador to the OAS Hernan Patino 
Mayer. On Christmas eve Patino Mayer received the following 
message: The United States wanted Gaviria to become a 
candidate, but before deciding Colombia wanted to know if it had 
Argentine support. 
  Four hours later President Carlos Menem phoned Gaviria to 
tell him: "If you become a candidate, you can count on my full 
support." 
  Then, Di Tella had to carry out the difficult task of 
telling 
Niehaus -- who on 27 March in Washington charged that the United 
States was acting imperialistically, to its colonies, in 
opposing his candidacy -- that Argentina was withdrawing its 
support. 
  Meanwhile Menem talked with other presidents. His agenda 
included the presidents of the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and 
Chile, among others. Soon, most of the South American countries 
gathered around Gaviria, who had the blessing of Washington. It 
is assumed that Chile, more meticulous, kept its original 
commitment to vote for Niehaus (the vote is secret). 
  Finally, the debate before the voting on 27 March ended in a 
scandal. Niehaus left the OAS in Washington denouncing those 
who had betrayed him, and now Gaviria will have five years to 
heal the wounds opened during this political debate.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Sergio Crivelli -- copyright LA PRENSA]--FOR </F>
OFFICIAL USE ONLY 
  [Text] According to a report that was circulated widely 
over the weekend, President Carlos Menem assumed a commitment to 
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Mickey Kantor in connection with the 
approval of the patents law. According to the report, which the 
government has not denied, Menem assured Kantor of two things: 
a) that the government has the "unanimous support of 
pro-government legislators," and b) that he expects to approve 
the bill "before mid-1994." Despite the president's optimism, 
the future of the bill does not seem very clear, if regarded 
from the viewpoint of Congress. 
<H5>  Threats and "Advantages" </H5>
  In order to exert pressure for the passage of the patents 
law, Washington has recently resorted to two weapons: commercial 
sanctions, and exclusion from NAFTA. In Chile, a little more 
than two weeks ago, Kantor explained to Menem that if there is 
no news on the subject by 30 April our country will be included 
on the list of countries that do not protect intellectual 
property, something that will, fatally, entail serious sanctions. 
  Ten days later, Argentine Ambassador to the United States 
Raul Granillo Ocampo informed LA PRENSA that the Menem 
administration has decided to promote a patents bill with 
features identical to those demanded by the United States, which 
is the only possibility for joining NAFTA. 
  Even though Congress is not working because of the electoral 
campaign, the news has reached the Senate, in whose hands 
remains this bill whose approval Washington has awaited in vain 
for years. Yet the reaction of the few pro-government lawmakers 
who could be found did not seem favorable to the expectations of 
U.S. medicine manufacturers, despite the intense lobbying that 
top White House officials have been doing in their favor. 
  Why? First, because the possibility of being included on the 
list of "sanctionable" countries has not caused too much 
concern. For example, Brazil was at one time included on the 
list, and was excluded when it signaled that it had began to 
look into the matter. On the other hand, most of Argentina's 
enormous commercial deficit comes from its trade with the United 
States. This means that in order to defend some hundreds of 
millions of dollars for its pharmaceutical industry, the 
Democratic administration will expose several billions to the 
risk of a bilateral short circuit. 
  As for joining NAFTA, the situation is also complex. All 
legislators are aware that if the bill is approved the way it 
was submitted by the executive branch -- that is, the way 
Washington wants it -- a cash prize will be given to the U.S. 
pharmaceutical industry, without an immediate matching benefit 
for our country. In fact, becoming a member of NAFTA -- a 
common market made up of the United States, Canada, and Mexico 
-- might be possible only in the medium term. 
<H5>  The Balance of Power Within the Government </H5>
  However, the reasons, arguments, rebuttals, and 
counter-arguments -- no matter how convincing -- have little 
weight at the time Congress makes decisions, when votes are the 
really important matter. And those votes, at least in the 
Peronist Party, are tied to a balance of power within the 
government, in which there are some who support the patents law 
and others who have so far successfully tried to delay it. 
Those who claim to know the events behind the scene at Casa 
Rosada make assurances that Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo 
belongs to the first group, while Presidential Secretary Eduardo 
Bauza is in the second. 
  What is the lesson of this situation? That the majority 
want to delay the bill. There is tangible evidence. For a long 
period the bill was retained by the Commission of Industry in 
the Chamber of Deputies. When ex-Deputy Jorge Yoma took up the 
task of expediting the study of the bill, he had smooth 
relations with Terence Todman, then U.S. ambassador to Argentina. 
  Whenever he was consulted off the record, Yoma predicted: 
"One of these days we will go to the Olivos residence with the 
congressional bloc leaders, Carlos will tell them `go ahead, 
boys,' and we will rapidly approve the bill." But this meeting 
never took place. Finally, one afternoon, at the Hall of Lost 
Steps in government house, Yoma confessed: "No, brother, I gave 
up the patents issue. No one paid any attention to me, and I 
went to see Bauza and I told him: "Please, fellow, do not send 
him (Todman) to me any more." 
  Shortly afterward, Alberto Iribarne -- currently the deputy 
interior minister and at that time the chairman of the 
Commission of Industry -- had a surprise. The opposition was 
pushing a bill to abstain from debating on the patents law 
unless the United States and the European Economic Community 
[EEC] eliminate the agricultural subsidies that are harming 
Argentina. At the time of the vote, Iribarne was practically 
alone, because the Peronists supported the opposition 
initiative. Even the ultraliberal Federico Zamora agreed to put 
aside the unrestricted property rights issue, in the face of the 
need to defend the agricultural sector. The United States and 
the EEC never eliminated the subsidies. 
  After this experience, the government submitted the bill to 
the Senate, where it was once again shelved. The Peronists put 
the subject in the hands of Radical Civic Union member Jose 
Genoud, and this made it clear that the executive branch was 
exerting no pressure to have the bill approved. The situation 
seems to have changed now, but nothing seems to indicate that 
the law will be approved the way the U.S. pharmaceutical 
industry wants it. On the contrary, based on the available 
signals, the text of the law might follow not the government 
model but the GATT agreement, a position that is supported by 
local laboratories but is rejected by foreign manufacturers.

<F P=106> [Article by Hugo Caligaris: "The PJ Needs More Air To </F>
Breathe at the Constituent Assembly"] 
  [Text] Not everything has been decided. The convention will 
take up changes that were not agreed on at Olivos. The governing 
party must win by a wide margin at the ballot box in order to 
avoid surprises in connection with constitutional reform. 
  Regardless of the lead that the polls are giving it, the 
Justicialist Party (PJ) needs to win the 10 April elections by a 
very wide margin in order to avoid surprises at the future 
Constituent Assembly. 
  Contrary to what people believe, the changes in the new 
constitution do not stop with the reelection of the president or 
even the so-called core agreement, the "closed package" 
containing the measures that Menem and Alfonsin agreed on in the 
Olivos pact. 
  Up to this point the assumption is that Peronists and 
Radicals will vote together. It will be interesting to see, 
however, when the convention delegates gather in Santa Fe or 
Parana, what wording they will use to describe the powers of the 
cabinet chief, the election of the third senator, or the 
autonomy of the Federal Capital. Each period, each comma will be 
examined under a microscope because they may subtly confirm or 
distort the spirit of the agreement. 
  But the changes in the constitution do not stop there. There 
is another vast sphere, the 15 issues that Congress has 
authorized for discussion by the Constituent Convention, on 
which there is no agreement. 
  The assumption is that the PJ will be able to do as it 
pleases on these varied issues, inasmuch as not many people are 
daring enough, not even in the UCR [Radical Civic Union] itself, 
to deny that the ruling party is going to win. This certainty 
will not give way to complete calm until we know whether the PJ 
has an absolute majority in the legislature that will take a 
scalpel to the Constitution of 1853. 
  "Yes, we will get 50 percent," the president of the bloc of 
deputies, Jorge Matzkin, told LA NACION. If this happens, the 
ruling party will have nothing to fear when a vote is taken on 
the "uncontrolled," open issues. But there are several people 
who are still losing sleep over this. One is Minister Cavallo, 
who feels that in this regard the Constituent Assembly could 
pose a threat to his economic program. 
<H5>  The Federal Issue </H5>
  The section "Authorized Issues" is made up of the following 
items: 1) Federalism; 2) Municipal autonomy; 3) Mechanisms of 
semidirect democracy; 4) Senate approval of officials in 
oversight agencies and the Central Bank; 5) Powers of Congress 
and the Executive; 6) Ombudsman; 7) The nation's attorney 
general; 8) Investigative powers of Congress; 9) International 
treaties; 10) Political parties and electoral system; 11) 
Environment; 12) Economic and social council; 13) Protection of 
customers and consumers; 14) Habeas corpus and amparo; and 15) 
Consolidation of terms of office. 
  There are disagreements between the two major parties on all 
of them, but the most striking differences concern various 
aspects of item 1. 
  The UCR insists that the amounts of federal revenue sharing 
be indicated expressly in the constitution, in other words, what 
percentage of the taxes collected by the federal government 
ought to be sent to each province. It also wants to empower the 
provinces to conduct international negotiations aimed at taking 
out loans or bringing in investment. 
  Led by Cavallo, the ruling party wants to block such moves 
and any under point two (there is a proposal under which cities 
would be able to collect and administer their own taxes), 
because they could "impair stability." 
  The provincial parties could play a decisive role in the 
vote 
on the federal issue if the PJ does not command an absolute 
majority and they back the UCR's stand. 
<H5>  Further Doubts </H5>
  The doubts about what the constitution might look like are 
branching out, as the summary below shows. 

  -  Two mechanisms of "semidirect democracy" will be 
introduced, but it is not known what their scope is. The UCR is 
an especially strong backer of the "initiative" (a bill backed 
by a certain number of signatures of citizens must be taken up 
as soon as possible by Congress). The PJ wants the "binding 
referendum." 
  Knowing that they have not done well at the polls lately, 
the 
people in the largest minority party are afraid that the 
administration will call referendums to impose its programs. 
"What would happen if there were two or three terrible murders, 
and the idea of bringing back the death penalty through a 
referendum were raised?" they ask, citing an extreme case. 

  -  Senate confirmation will be needed for officials in 
oversight agencies, but the Radicals do not want this 
requirement applied to the auditor general, who henceforth will 
be a Radical whom they do not want subject to confirmation by a 
PJ-controlled legislature. 
  -  What powers will the ombudsman have? 
As far as the UCR is concerned, he will be able to file suit in 
the event of improprieties. The Peronists, as potential targets 
of complaints since they are in power, do not go as 
far. 
  -  According to the Radicals, the nation's attorney general (a 
post that will be provided for in the next constitution) may be 
removed only by impeachment. The PJ wants to leave the door open 
so that the president can tell him to leave, as has already 
happened. 
  -  The status of international treaties may be open to 
many changes. If they are accorded constitutional rank (that is 
to say, higher than a regular law), then various issues related 
to human rights could be incorporated into the constitution. 
  -  The 
election system also raises question marks. According to the 
Radicals, the current law may be amended only by a two-thirds 
majority of Congress. The ruling party accepted this in 
principle, and it was written into the "closed package." But 
qualifying the issue for unrestricted debate seems linked to the 
PJ's desire to eliminate or water down the D'Hont system (which 
is proportional) and to assure more generous representation for 
electoral majorities. 
  -  An economic and social council, made up of 
businessmen, workers, and representatives of various social 
sectors, will be formed. The PJ is pushing this strongly and 
wants to give it broad powers, whereas the UCR wants to assign 
it only advisory functions. 
  -  What will be done to consolidate 
terms of office? In light of their election winning streak, the 
Peronists are proposing that all terms (of the president, the 
deputies, and the governors) begin on the same day. In this way 
the party that wins an election will have clear political 
sailing. The Radicals, who have been losing, want a more gradual 
approach. 
<H5>  Disagreements in the Constituent Assembly </H5>
  Federalism: This is what worries the administration, 
especially Minister Cavallo, the most. The Radicals, backed by 
the provincial parties, are insistent about setting the amount 
of revenue sharing in the constitution and about the provinces 
being able to negotiate foreign loans on their own. 
  Referendum: This will be incorporated into the new 
constitution, but the UCR fears that the administration will use 
it for purposes of "political manipulation." 
  Municipal autonomy: The disagreement has to do with whether 
cities should be able to set and collect their own taxes and 
spend the revenues. 
  Checks and balances: The PJ wants the auditor general of the 
nation (who will be from the opposition) to be confirmed by the 
Senate, in which it has a wide majority. 
  Election system: The UCR is calling for a two-thirds 
majority 
in Congress to amend the election law. The ruling party's desire 
to eliminate or pare back the D'Hont system is hovering over the 
issue. 
  Economic and social council: As far as the PJ is concerned, 
this council representing social sectors ought to play a 
prominent role. To the Radicals this smacks of "corporativism," 
and they want to "pare back its scope appropriately."

  [Text] Radical, Great Front, and Socialist deputies will 
sally forth today with a call for the impeachment of Judge Juan 
Jose Mahdjoubian, whose Friday ruling that there was not enough 
evidence to prosecute the defendants in the Comprehensive 
Medical Assistance Plan (PAMI) bribery case unleashed a storm of 
controversy. 
  Both Radical Jesus Rodriguez and Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez of 
the Great Front, as well as Socialist Hector Polino, stated 
yesterday that they will support the call for Judge 
Mahdjoubian's impeachment and also a proposal for Congress to 
name a committee to investigate all the charges of bribes or 
kickbacks in the PAMI. 
  Rodriguez declared that "the courts' complacent attitude 
toward power, the absence of effective watchdog agencies, and 
the lack of openness in government actions mean that it is up to 
Congress to take the bull by the horns." 
  According to the Radicals' plan, the investigating committee 
would have seven members, and would have 30 days to publish its 
conclusions. In other words, they would come out after the 
upcoming elections. 
  Meanwhile, Alvarez stated that Judge Mahdjoubian "must be 
impeached" because his decision "is shameful from all 
standpoints, and what it amounts to is condoning the 
distribution of bribes in broad daylight." 
  In Polino's view, the judge's ruling was "a mockery. From 
now 
on, only chicken thieves will be sent to jail." 
  On Friday, Mahdjoubian declared that he did not have enough 
evidence to prosecute the owners of clinics with PAMI contracts, 
who were arrested on 25 February. 
  When the police arrived, these people were standing in the 
bank lobby, exchanging envelopes without receipts. The envelopes 
contained money amounting to 25 percent of the payments they had 
received from the PAMI the day before. 
  The arrestees were accused by Councilman Anibal Ibarra, who 
contended that one of them, Osvaldo Calvo, president of the 
Association of Psychiatric Entities of the Argentine Republic, 
had been demanding bribes from the clinics to allow them to work 
with the PAMI. 
  From that time on, new accusations began surfacing in the 
capital and in various provinces, implicating the PAMI and its 
director, Matilde Menendez.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Bribes in the PAMI"] </F>
  [Text] It was with more indignation than surprise that the 
community received the news of the arrests of National Institute 
of Social Services for Retirees and Pensioners contractors who 
provide services under the Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan 
(PAMI). The arrests came as the contractors were handing over 
considerable sums of money, presumably intended--according to 
the accusation that led to criminal charges--as payment of 
bribes to administrative officials in the system for the 
privilege of being service providers and getting patients. 
  It is public knowledge that Councilman Anibal Ibarra of the 
capital was able to witness the handoff and then made the 
accusation before the judge. Though the judge does not yet think 
he has solid grounds to order the prosecution of the suspects, 
he has in his hands a case that should be pursued until no stone 
is left unturned. 
  More or less vague and sweeping insinuations and suspicions 
are commonplace when it comes to the funds managed by various 
public agencies, and the existence of widespread administrative 
corruption in government is, unfortunately, a fact of life in 
Argentine society that is as unprovable as it is irremediable. 
To be sure, there are few opportunities to record a concrete, 
verifiable incident in the presence of a judge, and this is 
probably what has made the PAMI case so special. 
  But even if the fact were irrefutably proven and a trial 
were 
to be conducted, that would say nothing about the true nature of 
these payments, their ultimate destination, or the goods and 
services received or to be received in exchange for them. That, 
precisely, is what the courts must clear up and what public 
opinion must discover. The public has viewed this case as the 
key that will unlock the door to finally expose the corruption 
and punish the perpetrators of the crimes that have been 
committed. 
  In this regard, the episode appears to have been unduly 
publicized because of the upcoming elections, even though it is 
of such singular importance that it should be protected from 
political grandstanding and be handled according to strict 
judicial guidelines. 
  No matter what the investigation reveals, however, the 
leadership of the agency involved bears some responsibility, 
whether it is proven that they were directly involved in the 
incident or that there were administrative shortcomings or lax 
controls. Furthermore, some serious ethical questions come to 
mind, since what is at stake are the funds that the community 
has allocated for meeting the needs of its weakest members, 
those who generally are most in need of medical care. No matter 
who is lining his pockets and stealing some of the funds that 
the workers and their employers have contributed to the PAMI, no 
matter what mechanism is used, substantial harm is being done to 
the system, and of course, to those who turn to it when they 
need assistance. 
  After the initial accusation was made, implicating providers 
of psychiatric services and prompting a judicial investigation, 
other allegations were made against various entities for 
overcharging, billing for services that were never rendered, 
paying bribes, etc. Now the charges involve geriatric and dental 
facilities and clinics and sanatoriums all over the country, and 
they must be investigated as well. The situation has gotten even 
more complicated with Ibarra's new claim that he has been 
subjected to threats and a bribery attempt. 
  The PAMI budget is more than 2 billion pesos a year, which 
can give rise to a lot of temptations. It is imperative that the 
judicial investigation be carried out to the fullest extent, 
without political interference of any sort, to shed light on the 
medical and administrative management of cases, the use of 
resources, and the mechanisms for contracting services for 
retirees. And not just for the sake of efficiency and honesty, 
but also because we have a moral obligation to the elderly, to 
whom society is still indebted.

  [Text] Corruption is the most serious flaw a politician can 
have, according to a poll of 1,000 Argentines conducted in the 
Federal Capital and Greater Buenos Aires by the New Majority 
Studies Center consultancy. 
  According to the study, 77.3 percent of those queried said 
corruption was the most serious flaw a politician can have, 18.1 
percent cited dishonesty, 2.7 percent thought it was infidelity, 
and 1.8 percent pointed to lack of seriousness [frivolidad]. 
  The poll, conducted during February 1994, showed that 85.1 
percent of Argentines polled in the Federal Capital view 
corruption as the most serious flaw as opposed to 72.9 percent 
in Greater Buenos Aires. 
  By political affiliation, voters belonging to the UCeDe 
[Democratic Center Union], United Socialist, and Grand Front 
parties assigned greater significance to corruption as a 
politician's most serious flaw than did voters of the PJ 
[Justicialist Party], UCR [Radical Civil Union], and Modin 
[Movement for Independence and Dignity] who felt that dishonesty 
was most significant. 
  Furthermore, more men than women cited corruption as the 
worst flaw.

<F P=106> [From the "Economic Report" column by Miriam Lage: "What Is </F>
Good for the United States ..."] 
  [Text] During his visit to Brazil, U.S. Commerce Under 
Secretary Jeffrey E. Garten [title as published] launched 
torpedoes at the Brazilian law that regulates the purchase of 
telecommunications products by calling it protectionist and 
bureaucratic. Thus, he echoed the words of U.S. Commerce 
Secretary Ronald Brown, who at the beginning of the month sent a 
letter to Brazilian Science and Technology Minister Israel 
Vargas condemning the protectionist attitude in government 
purchases of technological products. 
  The Brazilian telecommunications market has tremendous 
growth 
potential. Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc. cannot meet the 
demand for expansion and it would be great if telecommunications 
prices dropped. The U.S. accusations are somewhat irresponsible. 
  The recently edited Brazilian law is strictly inspired by 
American law. Here, exactly like in the United States, it has 
been established that a public bid can be won by a national 
company with up to 6 percent overpricing or even 12 percent 
overpricing if it comes from a high unemployment area. 
  The point of view of Garten and Brown is more backward if we 
analyze a public bid published a little more than a month ago by 
the National Renewable Energy Laboratories, a U.S. public 
institution that looks after renewable energy sources. The bid 
will choose a solar energy system for Brazilian Electric Power 
Company, Inc. in a joint research program. The bid establishes 
that offers from foreign manufacturers will have a 50 percent 
overpricing. And if the offer is the same as that of an American 
company, the American company wins the bid. It is the typical 
case of do as I say and not as I do.

<F P=106> [Selected remarks by Finance Minister-designate Rubens </F>
Ricupero as published in various past newspaper articles] 
  [Text] Thoughts of Minister Rubens Ricupero 
<H5>  Productivity </H5>
  "Due to the crisis, productivity and competitiveness have 
increased over the past few years in Brazil. I was surprised 
recently when I could verify that in fact many Brazilian 
companies have become smaller and more competitive. But there 
still is much to be done in this field, especially sectors that 
are lagging behind international quality standards." Interview 
published in JORNAL DO BRASIL on 6 February 1994. 
<H5>  Industrial Policy </H5>
  "An industrial policy, which unfortunately we still lack, 
must be adopted in Brazil. The country opened its market and 
removed customs barriers, and the industrial policy model of 
replacing imports (a policy that privileged domestic 
manufacturing, imposing trade barriers on the importation of 
products similar to those manufactured locally), is no longer 
applicable. Brazil has not adapted its industrial policy to the 
reality of foreign trade." Interview published in JORNAL DO 
BRASIL on 6 February 1994. 
<H5>  Inflation </H5>
  "The main problem with inflation, even with monetary 
correction, is that it destroys future expectations, making 
people live only in the present -- an increasingly short 
present. This trend is not compatible with the idea of 
investment because financial speculation is more profitable than 
economic activities." Article published in FOLHA DE SAO PAULO 
on 22 February 1994. 
<H5>  Stabilization </H5>
  "The solution is stabilization. As the Catholic Church used 
to say before the Second Vatican Council: Out of stabilization, 
there is no salvation. There is no measure, no matter how 
appropriate it may be, nor any internal or external plan, that 
will work without economic stabilization." Interview published 
in JORNAL DO BRASIL on 6 February 1994. 
<H5>  Social Pact </H5>
  "Since 1986 I have observed many similarities between what 
is 
happening here and in Russia (...) In Brazil, as in Russia, the 
old country resists changes. What is happening in Brazil and in 
Russia is that there is no consensus. Social pacts have been 
broken, there is an absence of hegemonic thought, and we are 
facing the situation that Italian politician Antonio Gramsci 
[1891-37] used to describe: The old resist dying, the new world 
cannot be born, and in this impasse all sorts of morbid symptoms 
appear. Corporate interests break up the political system in 
such a way that it is very difficult to make decisions for the 
common benefit because no one understands what the common 
benefit is." Interview published in JORNAL DO BRASIL on 6 
February 1994. 
<H5>  Social Action </H5>
  "To hamper the economic adjustment means running the risk of 
precipitating expectations capable of complicating the election 
process, restraining and paralyzing any future government, 
leaving the way open only for the destructive alternative of 
hyperinflation to break the impasse (...) To end inflation is 
the first and best social measure." FOLHA DE SAO PAULO on 31 
December 1994. [date as published] 
<H5>  Speculation </H5>
  "Among broad sectors of society, there is no true awareness 
about the need to curb inflation. On the one hand, we have half 
a dozen people who, in real partnership with inflation, are 
multiplying their wealth with no effort at all. On the other 
hand, the majority of the people, who are suffering the impact 
of the steep price increases, daily express their anguish in 
face of this reality, but in the end accept living with it." 
Article published in O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO on 8 February 1994. 
<H5>  Political Transition </H5>
  "Political support -- as a result of consensus -- for the 
stabilization program will be capable of generating enough 
psychological power to turn around the negative expectations 
that still prevail in Brazil. The concrete chance to 
successfully walk along the path of economic stabilization will 
lead us to a much better political transition in 1994, free of 
the frights of 1989-90." FOLHA DE SAO PAULO on 22 February 1994. 
<H5>  Democracy </H5>
  "The issue is not to support President Itamar Franco's 
government or a given minister, although the different political 
forces have promised to do so when he came to power. The 
presidential candidates must understand that the more they try 
to put off the struggle against inflation to 1995, the greater 
the risk of affecting their mandates, bringing forward voters' 
frustrations and wearing out people's confidence in the 
democratic system." FOLHA DE SAO PAULO on 22 February 1994. 
<H5>  Elections </H5>
  "Now that we are approaching the time when people will elect 
their next rulers and representatives, it is our duty as 
citizens to unite in a national movement to stabilize the 
economy. (...) It is imperative that now more than ever the 
exercise of democracy go way beyond the act of voting." O 
ESTADO DE SAO PAULO on 8 February 1994.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The Central Bank [BC] had difficulties 
in restricting the amount of money in circulation during 
February. The monetary base (volume of money in the hands of the 
public plus the compulsory reserves the banks keep in the BC) 
increased 43 percent in February compared with January's average 
daily balance. This is 2 percent more than the average inflation 
rate measured by the IPC-Fipe [Consumer Price Index-Economic 
Research Institute Foundation], the IGP-M [General Market Price 
Index], and the INPC [National Consumer Price Index]. As a 
result of high interest rates, the internal debt also increased 
4.6 percent more than inflation in February, reaching 31 
trillion cruzeiros. 
  Based on the average daily balances, the monetary base only 
increased more than the average inflation rate in the months of 
December in the last two years. In the other months the BC 
managed to control the monetary base through the issuance of 
government titles. The main factor in the monetary base's 
expansion was the exchange of dollars -- coming from abroad -- 
for cruzeiros. The net inflow during February was 1.1 trillion 
cruzeiros. Part of this pressure was compensated for by the 
issuance of public titles. The BC withdrew 552 billion cruzeiros 
from circulation in this operation. 
  In the case of the internal debt, its proportion of the GDP 
jumped from 8.3 percent in January to 8.6 percent in February, 
which is the same rate as November 1992, when the volume of the 
internal debt in government titles placed on the market began to 
drop. 
<H5>  Reserves </H5>
  Hard currency reserves, including cash and short-term 
credits, reached $29.1 billion by the end of January, which 
represents a considerable increase of $3.3 billion compared with 
December. Under the concept of international liquidity, which 
includes mid- and long-term credits, the increase was $3.2 
billion, amounting to a total $35.4 billion. 
  In the commercial exchange market, in which imports, 
exports, 
and the arrival and remittance of foreign investments are 
registered, the February surplus was $2.4 billion, 27 percent 
less than in January.

  [Text] Havana, 31 Mar (PL) -- President Fidel Castro has 
announced the possibility that on 1 May the Cuban parliament may 
analyze a package of economic measures designed to improve the 
country's economy. 
  The announcement was made by Castro when closing the Cuban 
Workers Federation (CTC) plenum on Tuesday, according to a 
version of the speech published today by the newspaper GRANMA. 
  He said that on 1 May, as the best greeting for 
International 
Workers Day, the National Assembly of the People's Government 
[ANPP] (parliament) might hold an extraordinary session, which 
was originally slated for the early part of the month, to 
consider proposals for improving the nation's internal finances. 
  The CTC plenum -- known here as the workers parliament -- 
studied the progress made in the island's parliaments in the 
workplace in which participants explained their views and 
possible solutions to the country's principal economic problems. 
These solutions will be considered during a debate to be held 
by the deputies. 
  Fidel Castro noted that other countries usually adopt 
economic and financial measures with the participation of very 
few government officials and do not even present them to the 
legislature but, rather, decide on their approval and issue a 
respective decree. The people then learn of their approval 
through the newspapers, he said. 
  We felt that this method should not be applied in our case, 
he said, noting: "In fact, we were not satisfied with simply 
taking them before the ANPP, because they involved very 
sensitive issues. This is why we believed it was important to 
present them to the people." 
  He stressed the need to face intelligently and with 
political 
tact "decisions that must necessarily be adopted, knowing that 
any restrictive measure will not be popular and that it will 
always be easier to agree on general issues rather than on 
specific issues." 
  Regarding the country's current stage, he explained that 
some 
progress is being achieved. This includes producing hundreds of 
thousands of more tons of sugar; a better tobacco harvest; 
greater production in vegetables and oil; and increased income 
from tourism biotechnology, and the pharmaceutical industry. 
  "We have had to work miracles to keep the country standing 
in 
the face of this complex situation and the most rigorous 
blockade which has sought to make us incapable of resisting," he 
added in his nearly two-hour speech, GRANMA reported.

  [Text] Havana, 1 Apr (PL) -- The National Assembly of the 
People's Government [ANPP] (parliament) of Cuba will hold an 
extraordinary session on 1 May, according to a summons by the 
Council of State divulged today in this capital. 
  The newspaper GRANMA published the document on its front 
page 
today which notes that the objective of the meeting will be to 
analyze the country's internal financial situation. 
  The holding of the important Cuban parliament meeting was 
suggested by President Fidel Castro, on delivering the closing 
speech at the plenum of the national committee of the Cuban 
Workers Federation, which began early this week. 
  The workers plenum -- known here as the workers parliament 
-- 
reviewed a vast analysis process in work centers on the island, 
the purpose of which was to have the participants propose 
possible solutions to the current primary national economic 
problems. 
  The suggestions of over 3 million workers participating in 
the meetings, as the Cuban president has said, will be 
considered in the upcoming sessions of deputies, who will adopt 
a series of economic measures aimed at improving the country's 
internal financial situation and boosting its economic 
efficiency.

<F P=106> [Report by Raimundo Lopez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 1 Apr (PL) -- This May, following the 
conclusion of a unique process of consultations with the rank 
and file of the workers unions, the Cuban parliament will begin 
working on solutions to one of the most delicate problems facing 
the nation's economy: cleaning up the domestic financial 
situation. 
  The debates will begin on the first of next month, which is 
International Labor Day, according to a summons published today 
calling for a special session. The Council of State, led by 
Cuban President Fidel Castro, issued the summons. 
  The National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] made 
the decision to hold such a meeting at the end of last December, 
during its second ordinary session of the year in which the 
financial issue was a leading topic. 
  According to statements by Jose Luis Rodriguez, chairman of 
the state committee on financial matters, the country has a 
currency surplus of more than 10 billion pesos, equal to the 
same amount in dollars, according to the official exchange rate. 
  The fiscal deficit has reached 4.2 billion pesos while 
subsidies for production losses in the agricultural and sugar 
sector alone are more than 7 billion pesos. 
  Rodriguez explained that such a financial imbalance 
seriously 
hampers the flow of Cuba's economy, which has been severely 
battered by the loss of its commercial partners and the 
heightened U.S. trade embargo. 
  Cuban President Fidel Castro and other officials have said 
the situation will never be resolved by neoliberal methods, 
which have had dramatic social consequences in other nations. 
  Osvaldo Martinez, chairman of the legislative commission on 
economic matters, said the members of his commission are working 
with the state financial committee to assess the situation and 
compile proposals to solve the complex problems plaguing the 
economy. 
  Martinez told the local media the commission will evaluate 
the possible decisions and draft recommendations from there, 
which could be used during the debates at the ANPP. 
  He said the basic criteria used in the analysis begins with 
the need to reduce the internal financial imbalance, 
specifically the problems of surplus cash and budget deficit. 
  He added the purpose is to reorganize the domestic economy 
in 
order to encourage the production of goods and services, recover 
salary values, rescue labor discipline, and gradually regain the 
purchasing power of the national currency. 
  Controlling the internal financial imbalance is like 
performing vital surgery on a sick patient, our economy, and the 
people understand this, he affirmed. 
  Martinez said the general understanding of the measures 
needed to resolve the current financial situation became evident 
during the so-called workers parliament, a series of meetings 
held by the workers unions from January to March. 
  During these assemblies, attended by more than 3 million 
people, methods of achieving economic efficiency at each center 
as well as other general measures were studied. 
  The leaders of the Central Organization of Cuban Workers 
Federation (CTC), along with President Fidel Castro, examined a 
summary of the proposals made at these meetings. 
  Pedro Ross, secretary general of the organization, has said 
none of the suggestions will be left unconsidered.

  [Text] Havana, 28 Mar (PL) -- Today, Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina wished newly elected OAS Secretary General Cesar 
Gaviria success in leading that organization. 
  Our hope and wish is that he will be successful in his new 
role, Robaina said in a statement to PRENSA LATINA when asked 
about the nomination [as received] of the current Colombian 
president to that important regional post. 
  Regarding the Colombian daily EL TIEMPO's retraction of 
previous reports on an alleged guerrilla summit in Havana -- 
another current topic relating to that South American country -- 
Robaina simply said: "EL TIEMPO admitted we were right." 
  Robaina made that statement upon welcoming Zambian Foreign

  [Text] Havana, 28 Mar (PL) -- The Foreign Ministry 
confirmed today that the Cuban Government will invite 
representatives from a broad political spectrum of Cuban 
immigrant communities abroad to "The Nation and the Immigrant 
Community Conference" to be held in late April. 
  People associated with different organizations and various 
political persuasions will attend, said Rene Mujica, an adviser 
to Foreign Relations Minister Roberto Robaina. 
  During an interview on Radio Rebelde, Mujica explained that 
approximately 200 persons will receive personal invitations and 
that representatives of anti-Cuban terrorist groups -- which are 
mainly based in the United States -- will be excluded. 
  This meeting, scheduled for 22-24 April, was announced by 
Foreign Minister Robaina on 14 February. 
  Robaina explained that one of the conference's goals is "to 
examine measures that could be adopted to normalize the 
immigrants' ties to their homeland." 
  Mujica says this is not seen as a short-term issue, since 
most of the immigrants' ties with their homeland have developed 
within the framework of 35 years of [word indistinct] by the 
United States against the Cuban revolution. 
  Considering these antecedents, one can understand that the 
goal of normalizing the immigrants' relations with their 
homeland will not be easy, Mujica said. 
  However, he added, we believe this is a legitimate objective 
that benefits all parties involved and injures no one, and it 
can be achieved if both we and the immigrants have the will to 
work towards its realization. 
  The official did not rule out finding a way to achieve this 
goal with former counterrevolutionaries who have changed their 
attitude, but he made clear that this objective can never be 
achieved with those who persist with an antinational attitude. 
There is no place here for the counterrevolution, Mujica 
stressed. 
  It was recalled that the first meeting between local 
authorities and immigrants took place in late 1978, but 
afterward, the aggressive policy toward Cuba of the Ronald 
Reagan and George Bush administrations deftly constrained the 
development of these ties.

<F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez: "Participation in Upcoming Conference </F>
Without Conditions"] 
  [Text] Havana, 1 Apr (PL) -- Representatives of Cuban 
emigres from 40 countries and the local government will discuss 
important topics starting with different ideological positions 
and without preestablished conditions, during a conference 
scheduled for this month. 
  Today, well-informed sources of the Cuban Foreign Ministry 
informed PRENSA LATINA of the diverse geographical backgrounds 
of the representatives invited to the meeting, which will be 
held from 22 to 24 April in this capital. 
  The participants of the conference "The Nation and the 
Emigre 
Community," approximately 200, will include critics of the Cuban 
political system who will be able to freely state their views 
and even make proposals in pursuit of a common effort, an 
authorized spokesperson confirmed to PRENSA LATINA. 
  Although the largest group will be from the United States, 
given a large number of emigres reside there, other large 
delegations will include Cubans living in Mexico, Venezuela, and 
Spain. 
  There will also be delegates from countries that are very 
diverse, including Costa Rica, Germany, Puerto Rico, Angola, 
China, Argentina, Brazil, France, the Dominican Republic, the 
eastern Caribbean islands, Australia, Hungary, Poland, 
Switzerland, Czechoslovakia [as received], and Canada. 
  According to the agenda, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
will deliver a keynote address during the first working day on 
the country's relations with the emigres as well as on various 
issues. During the second day Vice President Carlos Lage will 
present a report on the national economic situation. 
  Two other main presentations on the government's behalf will 
be made by Abel Prieto, president of the Union of Writers and 
Artists, who will give a presentation entitled "Culture and 
National Identity." Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government, will speak on the Cuban 
political system and the work by the organization that he heads. 
  After each presentation, the participants will exchange 
views 
and make proposals on immigration regulations and emigres' 
participation in the cultural and economic life of their country 
of origin. 
  Regarding the latter, it was noted that professionals and 
Cuban-American businessmen recently demonstrated great interest 
in participating in a seminar also held in Cuba, an interest 
intellectuals who reside abroad have also shown. 
  Information obtained by PRENSA LATINA indicates the 
government is stressing the fact that guests to the event should 
include delegates from a broad spectrum of political positions, 
excluding only those who are engaged in aggressive or terrorist 
attacks. 
  Although current problems are different and the concept of 
bilateral relations between Cuba and the United States are also 
different, Cuba believes the dialogue with the emigres held in 
1978 can serve as a precedent for the new talks. 
  On this occasion, according to the same source, the Cuban 
Government has decided to raise again the issue of normalizing 
relations with emigres, despite the fact there are no 
expectations that bilateral ties with Washington will improve, 
as happened during the 1970's. 
  In this context, it is expected Cubans who live outside the 
country will be able to voice interests and concerns of a 
specific nature. Also, it is understood the conference will not 
be able to exhaust all the topics of interest to the government 
and nationals who live abroad. 
  In light of this, the meeting can be described as the first 
step in an important direction and, also, as a pillar for even 
more ambitious and definitive projects.

  [Text] Moscow, 29 Mar (PL) -- Sources in the economic 
section of the Cuban Embassy in Russia have stated, based on the 
bilateral agreements signed last December, the exchange of 
Russian oil for Cuban sugar should start soon. 
  Cuban officials who have spoken to PRENSA LATINA mentioned 
the information published by the INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY today on 
Russia shipping 2.5 million tons of oil to the Antillean island. 
  This exchange was agreed upon at the talks held between both 
countries in December 1993. The exchange only required 
ratification by this country's government [not further 
identified], a step which was taken 25 March. 
  INTERFAX added Havana will send 1 million tons of sugar, and 
the Russian Foreign Economic Relations Ministry is to determine 
which firms will export the crude oil. 
  This operation was ratified in Resolution 228 of the 
government headed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the 
Cuban officials in Moscow added.

  [Text] Havana, 24 Mar (PL) -- Today, Luis Suarez, director 
of the Center of Studies on America, CEA, called the anti-Cuban 
bill presented to the U.S. Congress by Representative Robert 
Menendez vengeful and illogical.. 
  In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Suarez said the proposal, 
which will be analyzed today during a hearing at the U.S. 
Senate, reacts to the impact caused by the converse project 
defended by a group of representatives led by Charles Rangel. 
  Rangel spoke out in favor of repealing the so-called 
Torricelli Law, as well as lifting the economic and trade 
blockade imposed by Washington on the Caribbean island. 
  Menendez, with his antihistorical proposal, wants to 
strengthen a policy in Congress that is clearly receiving 
growing rejection. In the United States, this policy has 
triggered demonstrations of civil disobedience like that by the 
Pastors for Peace, the CEA director noted. 
  To conclude, Menendez said the proposal deserves the name of 
Residual Project of the Cold War [Proyecto Remanente de la 
Guerra Fria] as it opposes even the interests of U.S. 
businessmen who want to improve relations between both nations. 
  Meanwhile, Lazaro Barredo, vice president of the 
International Relations Commission at the National Assembly of 
the People's Government, said Menendez' proposal is an 
expression of how, in U.S. power circles, there are those who 
shy away from the necessary and civilized negotiating table. 
  Barredo explained that what the representative of Cuban 
origin proposed definitely is no different than the amendment 
previously presented by Robert Torricelli, while he agreed with 
Suarez that it is in response to Rangel's proposal. 
  Rangel's proposal had strong repercussions in the political, 
economic, and academic sectors as it advocates true and 
effective solutions to the Cuban-U.S. conflict, Barredo 
indicated. 
  Barredo, who is also a Cuban reporter, recalled that 
Menendez, together with Ileana Ros Leithenen and Lincoln Diaz 
Balart, both of whom are also of Cuban origin, became a trio 
that far from representing their constituency, have undertaken a 
policy aimed at favoring only their personal interests.

  [Text] Havana, 25 Mar (PL) -- The first full session 
between Cuban and Netherlands businessmen concluded today with 
the recommendation to both governments to sign a document 
protecting investments and increasing trade between both nations. 
  The result of previous contacts turned into a $50-million 
credit granted to Cuba by the Bank of Curacao. This amount is 
earmarked mainly for the Cuban nickel and sugar industries, 
Willem C. Van't Wout [name as received], chief of the 
Netherlands delegation, told PRENSA LATINA. 
  He also reported that he has signed a letter of intent 
between the Cuban tourist institutions and the Netherlands hotel 
group the Golden Tulip. The group has committed to building 
five hotels with a $75-million investment. 
  Van't Wout and Ariel Maso, chief of the Cuban delegation, 
signed a protocol of the meeting's minutes that will be followed 
up next year in the Netherlands. 
  Both executives expressed their satisfaction with the 
seriousness and cordiality that characterized the negotiations. 
  Maso, director of the Cubaniquel [Cuban nickel] Company, 
labeled the Netherlands kingdom as one of Cuba's most important 
access doors to the EU. 
  William C. Van't Wout, who has been negotiating with Cuba 
for 
26 years, said that three-quarters of the Netherlands mission on 
this occasion was made up of businessmen who were visiting the 
island for the first time. 
  The executive announced that specific results of the first 
session are still abstract although they allow for future 
businesses, particularly in the construction and dredging of 
ports. 
  Among this missions' participants were representatives of 
several large banks, as well as trade companies interested in 
investing in production for the local market. 
  Van't Wout was questioned on his role in the presence of 
Netherlands buses on Havana streets, to which he replied that 
the operation was the result, in part, of a donation by 
Rotterdam municipality, while other buses were sold at low 
prices. 
  The Netherlands mission met during their stay with Isabel 
Allende, deputy foreign minister; Ernesto Melendez, minister 
president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation; 
Orlando Hernandez, vice minister of foreign trade; Abraham 
Maciques, president of the Cubanacan Corporation; and Carlos 
Martinez Salsamendi, Chamber of Commerce president.

<F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 29 Mar (PL) -- A counterrevolutionary 
activist is currently facing a possible seven-year prison term 
after having acknowledged today in court his attempts to spread 
anti-Cuban propaganda on behalf of U.S. radio stations. 
  Rodolfo Gonzalez Gonzalez violated provisions of the Cuban 
penal code by using the telephone to relay, in a calculated and 
consistent manner, distorted information with respect to the 
Cuban situation and by encouraging, according to the charges 
filed, public unrest with the intention of causing apprehension 
and dissatisfaction among the population. 
  Gonzalez's appearance before a provincial people's court was 
carried out in an unobstructed manner, with the presence not 
only of the accused's relatives and friends, but also of 
national and foreign journalists, as well as diplomats 
representing the U.S. Interests Section and the Canadian, 
Swedish, and Czechoslovakian [as received] Embassies. 
  Gonzalez, according to his own admission, relayed reports 
related to alleged unrest in Havana bakeries and supermarkets to 
the so-called Radio Marti radio station. He also provided 
reports on alleged abuses and inadequate medical attention for 
various inmates including Sebastian Arcos Bergnes and Maria 
Elena Cruz Varela. 
  Likewise, he insisted that a Cuban television station 
employee on Isla de la Juventud had been fired because of his 
religious convictions and political opinions. 
  Statements by numerous witnesses, including employees and 
neighbors of the area where the alleged protests took place, as 
well as police agents, attested to the inaccuracy of the 
reports. In addition, the television station employee himself 
denied having been fired. 
  On the other hand, reports filed on medical assistance 
provided to Arcos Bergnes and Cruz Varela, who has already been 
released, including a video showing Arcos in good health, were 
used to prove that Gonzalez and Radio Marti had lied with 
respect to the incidents. 
  An interesting development occurred during the trial when 
the 
accused was allowed to read a 30-minute statement [words 
indistinct] bordering on the offensive, criticizing the 
revolutionary leaders' conduct, without the court doing anything 
to prevent it despite protests by prosecutor Edelmira Pedriz. 
  Gonzalez had already once been sentenced to 16 months in 
prison because of his attempts to depart Cuba illegally.

<F P=106> [Article by Victor B. Carriba] </F>
  [Text] Mexico City, 22 Mar (PL) -- The third Solidarity 
with Cuba caravan took advantage of its return to the United 
States to conclude a pending matter: sending to the island part 
of the humanitarian aid that had been detained by U.S. Customs. 
  A day after returning from Havana, the members of the 
caravan 
went back to the U.S.-Mexico border, set up the portable 
satellite communications station that was not taken to Cuba two 
weeks ago, and nonchalantly moved it into Mexico. 
  According to caravan members, the driver of the vehicle told 
the customs officers that the equipment was being sent to Cuba, 
but they "did not respond or stop the vehicle," which crossed 
the international bridge and headed into Mexican territory. 
  Later, two members of the convoy who were riding in a 
station 
wagon behind the vehicle transporting the portable station were 
stopped and arrested by the municipal police. The station wagon 
was loaded with powdered milk and school supplies. 
  The two persons arrested were Reverend Lucius Walker, 
executive director of the Interdenominational Foundation of the 
Communities (IFCO) and founder of Pastors for Peace, and 
Cuban-Canadian Camilo Garcia. Force was used to remove Walker 
and Garcia from the vehicle. During the incident the police 
fractured Garcia's nose. Garcia also suffered blows to his back 
and one of Walker's hands was injured. The two men were 
released on bail yesterday afternoon. 
  On 9 March, Laredo Customs officials prevented the group 
from 
crossing into Mexico, from where they would go to Cuba. The 
excuse used by the Laredo customs officials at that time was the 
bans established by the Torricelli Law aimed at heightening the 
blockade imposed by Washington on Cuba more than 30 years ago. 
  The communications system was part of the more than 140 tons 
of humanitarian aid for Cuba the third solidarity caravan had 
collected in Canada and the United States. 
  Sources from Pastors for Peace, an organization that 
sponsors 
this type of action to help Cubans, pointed out that in addition 
to the communications system, 22 boxes of various products to be 
sent to Cuba were also taken across the border. 
  The 22 boxes taken across the border contain computers, 
typewriters, spare parts for electrical appliances, a monitor 
for blood transfusions, toasters, and other supplies that had 
been retained by the customs officers. 
  According to Tom Hansen, a Pastors for Peace director, the 
portable station will be installed at the Martin Luther King 
Center in Havana to receive U.S. programs that will later be 
distributed by the churches on the island. 
  The Cubans have requested people-to-people diplomacy. Since 
the U.S. Government refuses to talk to the Cubans, with this 
system the peoples will be able to talk to one another. We can 
break the information blockade established by the U.S. 
Government on the people of the United States, Hansen said. 
  When the second caravan crossed the border last summer, U.S. 
Customs officials also detained a school bus. It was released 
23 days later after a hunger strike staged by some caravan 
members. Today, the school bus is being used by the Ebenezer 
Baptist Center in Havana.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 30 Mar (PL) -- Cuban President 
Fidel Castro has acknowledged the newspaper EL TIEMPO's 
recantation of reports published about an alleged guerrilla 
summit in Cuba which reportedly was attended by a Colombian 
clergyman. 
  In a letter sent to Director Fernando Santos Castillo, which 
the most important newspaper in Colombia included on its front 
page today, the head of the Cuban revolution states "the issue 
was important and difficult." 
  "(The incident) could have serious and unwanted 
repercussions, concerning the credibility of many persons and 
the relations between our nations," the letter emphasizes. 
  EL TIEMPO published, beginning on 10 March, a series of 
alleged important revelations concerning the aforementioned 
January summit in Havana with Bishop Nel Beltran's 
participation, despite the Cuban Government's reiterated 
assurances and denials. 
  The existence of that meeting was even personally denied by 
Bishop Beltran, Catholic Church leaders, and the most important 
Colombian Government officials. Nevertheless, since the Attorney 
General's Office presented what was purportedly evidence, the 
government decided to request an explanation from Cuba, which 
was immediately answered. 
  The newspaper, which recanted its report on Sunday, admitted 
it had been manipulated by still unspecified interests, and 
apologized to the Cuban Government, Nel Beltran, and its 
readers, in an action that is termed important because it is so 
unusual. 
  "I consider it my duty to express my sincere appreciation 
for 
the step taken by EL TIEMPO to deny recent reports that were 
published by the same newspaper and that do not conform to the 
truth, and to apologize to Monsignor Nel Beltran and the Cuban 
Government," Fidel Castro states in his letter. 
  "By explaining the incident, reporting the hoax of which it 
had been a victim, and apologizing to those involved, EL TIEMPO 
has shown courage and honesty. We recognize this; we accept 
your apologies, and we congratulate the newspaper's board of 
directors, its journalists, and its workers for this attitude, 
which greatly exalts you," the Cuban statesman adds. 
  "We hope and wish that all of us will learn a useful lesson 
from this unpleasant incident, and that mutual respect and 
relations between the peoples of Colombia and Cuba will be 
strengthened," the Cuban revolution leader's letter to EL TIEMPO 
ends.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Gabriel Molina "for EL SOL DE </F>
MEXICO": "The Cuban Economic Situation Will Make Ration Books 
Disappear"; PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 0259 GMT on 29 March 
transmits a service message killing this item] 
  [Text] Havana -- The Cuban ration book is about to 
disappear. Strangely enough, this is not because it is no longer 
necessary, but because it is so necessary that it has become 
unsustainable. 
  Researcher Dario Machado Rodriguez, director of the Center 
for Social, Political, and Public Opinion Studies [Centro de 
Estudios Sociopoliticos y de Opinion] told EL SOL DE MEXICO that 
surveys and studies carried out among the population show, among 
other things, that products should no longer be subsidized by 
maintaining the so-called ration book. Consensus indicates, 
however, that subsidies should be granted to people or families 
with lower incomes or experiencing a particularly difficult 
social situation. 
  "It is my opinion that the general subsidy offered by the 
ration book should gradually disappear. 
  ``At the same time, salary policies should change. I believe 
it is essential for these measures to include a wage 
reevaluation, from which to establish some sort of 
differentiation system. But this must be accomplished 
gradually, not in one single blow.'' 
  Machado pointed out the contradiction "between the policy of 
egalitarianism implemented by the revolutionary process and the 
inevitable nonegalitarian solution" to solve the crisis. 
  He explained that this is a basic problem that has been 
examined during the meetings of the Parliaments in the 
Workplace. According to the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC), 
there have been about 80,000 such meetings. He added that "the 
meetings allow us to better understand the crudeness of the 
possible solutions and the realistic approach the situation 
requires, in addition," he stressed, "the will to apply these 
solutions gradually and not as a shock treatment." 
  Machado, a 1977 political science graduate, has worked as 
the 
Center's director for eight years. As a leading researcher, he 
specializes in social issues. 
  He said the people have stayed abreast of the situation, 
especially since the discussions at the plenary session of the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba last year and 
later at the National Assembly of the People's Government. 
  "Our investigations show that the meetings in the workplace 
have created an interest that has been increasing ever since 
their inception. The debate itself, the goal of which is to 
collect ideas, has generated enthusiasm and reaffirmed the 
people's trust in their right to participate in the consensus 
building process. In addition, I believe it has allowed people 
to express their expectations regarding economic measures, which 
billowed after the first measures were announced in June 1993." 
  Machado pointed out that two months after the possession of 
dollars was deregulated, the expectation was that the situation 
would improve. Self-employment had an 82 percent approval 
rating, while 73 percent of those polled said that it would 
create new jobs and 72 percent believed that it would help 
reduce excess currency by establishing taxes on income. About 
58 percent of those interviewed said that cooperative production 
revenues are a good short-term initiative, while 73 percent said 
the basic production units would increase food supplies and 80 
percent believe they would help attract people to work 
permanently in agriculture. 
  "Other studies indicate that basic achievements in 
education, 
health, and social security should not be affected because no 
one should be left out in the cold. As a rule, however, there 
should be no other similar egalitarian distribution." 
  With the exception of these three basic guarantees, the 
socialist principle that preaches "to each according to his 
ability and to each according to his work should apply," he 
said, "because there is no other way of offering sufficient 
incentive to get people to produce. It is, therefore, essential 
to structure an economic system to guarantee equal pay for equal 
work." 
  Official sources admit that since the crisis worsened, 
egalitarianism -- the highest expression of which is the ration 
book -- has increased absenteeism and the lack of motivation in 
the workplace.

  [Text] Havana, 29 Mar (PL) -- Pedro Ross Leal, secretary 
general of the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC), has cited the 
proposals by the workers movement to heal the country's 
finances, saying a change in mentality is needed to find 
solutions. 
  He has said the more than 80,000 meetings at work centers, 
attended by more than 3 million people, undoubtedly had had a 
positive outcome. The objective of the meetings, which started 
in late January, was to consult with the rank and file on 
solutions to the economic problems. 
  The labor movement's biggest accomplishment has been in 
promoting a change in mentality, even in its own union groups, 
the CTC leader has told the newspaper GRANMA. 
  After saying the assembly process, popularly known as 
workers 
parliaments, had yielded high political gains, Ross said the 
main demands had centered on greater control of material and 
financial resources and the implementation of penalties on those 
who steal government assets. 
  The workers explicitly understand a revamping of the 
country's finances requires an increase of production based on 
improved productivity and efficiency, he has said. 
  Ever since Cuba lost its commercial partners in the former 
socialist bloc, it has been confronting an adverse economic 
situation that can be translated into an excess of currency 
greater than $10 billion--equivalent to dollars in the official 
exchange--a fiscal deficit of 4.2 billion [no currency 
specified] and high subsidies. [sentence as received] 
  Furthermore, the U.S. blockade, in effect for more than 30 
years, was intensified, causing losses calculated at more than 
$40 billion, according to local authorities' conservative 
estimates. 
  The Cuban Parliament agreed last December to hold a special 
meeting to discuss the restoration of the country's internal 
finances. The date of the meeting has still not been announced 
officially, but media sources estimate it will be in April.

  [Text] Havana, 26 Mar (PL) -- A Cuban province is 
responsible for the food supply for nearly one third of the 
country, capital city included. To meet this objective, that 
province is struggling to overcome the deep crisis affecting its 
output and local economy. 
  Havana Province, with 600,000 inhabitants, 5 percent of the 
country's productive soil, and a somewhat significant industrial 
and scientific output, will have to stimulate substantial 
improvements in agricultural commodities to nearly 3 million 
people. 
  During a recent conversation between Hiram Gonzalez, head of 
the provincial government, and the diplomatic corps accredited 
in Cuba, a conversation to which PRENSA LATINA had access, he 
cited efforts to increase food and vegetable harvests, milk and 
egg supplies, and sugar and tobacco production. 
  In order to better explain these issues, Gonzalez cited the 
impact caused by the difficult situation through which the 
island is going as a result of the U.S. economic blockade and 
the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe. 
  For example, Gonzalez mentioned the death of more than 
100,000 heads of cattle as a result of the shortage. He also 
cited the significant drop in egg and milk production also due 
to the inability to obtain half a million tons of needed fodder. 
  Despite the fertilizer and fuel shortages, Havana believes 
it 
can produce more than 12.5 million quintals of food and 
vegetables during the current year, 3 million quintals more than 
what was obtained during 1993 and which could result in an 
improvement in the food supply to the people, in addition to the 
production of 50 million liters of milk. 
  According to disclosed information, it is expected by 
encouraging cooperative agriculture production through state 
assistance it will be possible to ensure an increase in harvest 
yields via a smaller work force and less technical measures. 
Concurrently, the increasing cattle mortality rate has been 
decreased by simply changing pasture systems. 
  The province is working to meet its sugar production targets 
as well as its tobacco surplus. It has also announced the use 
of five large cold storage plants and the completion of 36 
scientific-productive plants already in operation. 
  Despite all these setbacks, the provincial government has 
cited the fact there are no unemployed teachers or students 
without a school in Havana. In addition, the infant mortality 
rate stands at 9.9 per thousand infants born. 
  Adopted measures to ensure the continuation of these 
advances, and as a result of the lack of more than 400 
medications in Havana drugstores during 1993, include the 
production of more than half a million doses of byproducts from 
herbal medicine [derivados de la medicina verde], the use of 
which has been greatly encouraged. 
  According to an announcement made by Gonzalez, industrial 
production is in a depressed state, the reactivation of which 
will depend on foreign investments in certain sectors. 
  Havana is also relying on specialized companies, such as in 
cement production, electrical energy, ceramics, and aluminum, 
among others, in addition to sugar factories. 
  We are under extreme pressures and experiencing significant 
shortages, but we also have some very dynamic options to solve 
these problems, the provincial leader explained to the foreign 
diplomats. In conclusion, Havana's task is just one aspect of 
the efforts the entire country is undertaking to deal with the 
most complex phase of its history.

<F P=106> [By Moises Perez Mok] </F>
  [Text] The Cuban Corporation of Tourism and International 
Trade, Cubanacan S.A., currently immersed in a modern process of 
structural change, has set itself goals that at the beginning of 
the decade were unimaginable. 
  This was stated during a news conference by Abraham 
Maciques, 
president of Cubanacan's Board of Shareholders. Maciques said 
that in 1995 the island's tourism facilities will be able to 
accommodate 1 million tourists and secure $1 billion for the 
country. 
  He recalled that last year Cuba received 640,000 visitors, 
according to preliminary reports. These visitors brought in 
between $720 million and $740 million to the Cuban economy, 
which has been enduring an adverse international situation since 
the end of the 1980's. 
  Of this total, Maciques said, Cubanacan brought in 240,000 
tourists and more than $195 million, approximately 40 percent 
more than the 1992 figures. 
  He said: The corporation envisages bringing approximately 
250,000 tourists in 1994, mostly from Canada, Germany, Spain, 
Italy, Netherlands, and Argentina, without forgetting nascent 
markets such as Great Britain and France. 
  He said Cubanacan is ready to plan bigger promotions for the 
next few years because the quality of what it offers has been 
steadily improving and this has earned the trust of tourist 
agents and foreign partners. This also helps entice tourists to 
return. 
  Polls conducted by Cubanacan among guests point to a 4.6 
level of satisfaction on a five-point scale. 
  Currently, Cubanacan S.A. operates 48 hotels with a total of 
7,200 rooms. Fifteen of these hotels function under the mixed 
enterprise or mixed management arrangement. 
  This year, with the opening of the hotels Las Americas, in 
the Varadero beach resort; Las Brisas, in the northeastern 
province of Holguin; and Cohiba and El Viejo y El Mar, in 
Havana; Cubanacan S.A.'s room availability will increase to 
8,400. 
  With regard to mixed investments, Maciques said that by the 
year 2000, they will have 8,000 rooms (more than 3,000 in Cayo 
Coco alone) operating mostly in working tourist centers. 
  Development demands participation in joint investments. 
Cubanacan S.A. resources are to be used only on highly 
profitable enterprises, and both types of investments must take 
place in sites where infrastructure of already available (roads, 
electricity). 
  Regarding supplemental hotel services, Maciques reported on 
a 
plan to restore some installations and to open new ones that 
will offer typical entrees at moderate prices. 
  He mentioned, as an example, El Aljibe, a Havana restaurant 
that specializes in chicken, an experience that will be 
implemented throughout the country because of its demonstrated 
efficiency. 
  Referring to the new structure adopted at the beginning of 
this year by Cubanacan, Maciques said this is part of a process 
of improvements by means of which each of the previous managers 
(18) opened independent companies. 
  He stated: None can be unprofitable, and all are suitable 
for 
serving not only our corporation's tourists but also anyone 
requesting our services. 
  According to Maciques, the new organization will guarantee 
more efficiency and quality control, reduce intermediate 
structures, and grant more authority to rank and file employees. 
  Maciques also praised the opening of accounting offices and 
the signing of foreign venture contracts for the administration 
of construction projects, something without precedent in Cuba. 
  The first agreement of this type was signed between a 
Spanish 
group and the Union of Caribbean Construction Enterprises to 
complete the hotel Las Americas, in Varadero, with a reduction 
of costs and improved quality. 
  The same concepts will apply for constructing the Coco-Miel 
Hotel, in Cayo Coco. This type of agreement allows the island 
to acquire up-to-date technology and important construction 
know-how.

<F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said in 
Havana that the tour he begins today through five South American 
countries will allow Cuba to advocate [word indistinct] in the 
area, and for the coming Ibero-American Summit to be held in 
Cartagena, Colombia. During a news conference at Havana's Jose 
Martin Airport, Robaina said Latin America and the Caribbean 
constitute priorities for Cuban foreign policy. Asked about the 
possibility of Cuba's eventual reintegration into the OAS, 
Robaina noted that the country awaits the OAS decision on this 
because, he emphasized, we cannot knock on the door of a place 
from which we were arbitrarily removed. 
  Robaina attributed underhanded intentions to the White House 
decision to exclude Cuba from the so-called Americas Summit 
convened by President William Clinton. Robaina's tour will 
include Uruguay, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, and Paraguay.

  [Text] On 3 April, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
departed for Uruguay, the first stop of a tour through five 
South American countries, which will conclude on 19 April. In 
statements to the press at Jose Marti International Airport, 
Robaina said he will discuss with the authorities of the 
countries he will visit the two summits scheduled for this year: 
the Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, and 
the one in Miami convened by U.S. President William Clinton, in 
which Cuba will not be participating. 
  Robaina described his visit to Paraguay, with which Cuba has 
no diplomatic relations, as semiofficial, and said it will be 
useful to expand mutual understanding. Foreign Minister Robaina 
reiterated his wish for Cesar Gaviria's success as head of the 
OAS, a post to which he was recently elected.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with correspondent Roberto Cavada, who </F>
is with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina on his tour of South 
America, by reporter Maria Elena Alonso from Montevideo, Uruguay 
-- live] 
  [Text] [Alonso] We know you have been flying for several 
hours now, that you have made several stops, and that there are 
many important things to be said. We are going to turn the time 
over to you because we know you have very little time to explain 
all this to our listeners. 
  [Cavada] Thank you. We are transmitting live from Montevideo 
for the Cuban people. It is raining and cloudy here. We arrived 
in Montevideo just two minutes ago. Foreign Minister Robaina was 
greeted at the airport by Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio 
Abreu. 
  The work of this tour began last night during all the 
obligatory technical intermediate stops that Robaina and his 
delegation made. In Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, and Argentina, 
Roberto Robaina met with the respective Cuban ambassadors of 
those countries. There was contact with the national press. 
Foreign Minister Robaina was interviewed by the NACIONAL 
newspaper of Caracas and by Channel 11 of Bogota. 
  Another significant point was his conversation with 
Colombian 
Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio in Bogota with whom, 
according to official sources of the Cuban delegation, he 
discussed bilateral relations and the speculation by the EL 
TIEMPO newspaper. 
  I reiterate, Cuban Foreign Minister Robaina has arrived in 
Montevideo. The Cuban delegation was greeted at the airport by 
Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu. We have confirmed that 
Robaina will be meeting with Uruguayan President Luis Alberto 
Lacalle within the next few hours.

<F P=106> [Special report from Montevideo by correspondent Roberto </F>
Cavada -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] At the end of the first talks held this Monday 
afternoon with Uruguayan Central Bank Director Enrique Braga, 
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said Uruguay is willing 
to not freeze the Cuban debt to Uruguay and to look for 
solutions favorable to both countries. On this matter, the Cuban 
foreign minister told this station the following: 
  [Begin Robaina recording] I think the main objective is not 
to submit a concrete proposal on how or with what to pay the 
foreign debt. Cuba does not have what is in fact needed to pay 
the debt as far as money is concerned, but we are surely willing 
to try to find a solution and to sit at a negotiating table to 
discuss all possibilities. We can establish what Cuba needs and 
the investment possibilities for Uruguay. Some Cuban products 
could be useful to Uruguay, so these products can contribute to 
solving this problem. 
  The important thing is that a Cuban delegation headed by the 
Cuban Central Bank president will arrive here soon, and they 
have the decision-making power to choose the options to solve 
this debt problem. [end recording] 
  The Cuban foreign minister met previously with Uruguayan 
President Luis Alberto Lacalle. They exchanged ideas on the 
forthcoming Ibero-American Summit to be held in Colombia, 
transformations in the economic area taking place in Cuba, and 
preparations for the emigre conference that will take place by 
the end of this month, among other subjects. 
  Robaina's agenda, which is certainly tight, included a 
meeting with Liber Seregni, president of the Broad Front; an 
interesting meeting with the Uruguayan Congress foreign 
relations committee, at which the Cuban foreign minister 
explained the true situation in Cuba; a meeting with Cuban 
residents in Uruguay; and another meeting with Uruguayan 
intellectuals. 
  According to a Cuban delegation spokesman, Tuesday's agenda 
contemplates the beginning of talks at the Foreign Ministry 
level, a meeting with his Uruguayan counterpart Sergio Abreu, 
contacts with several television networks from Montevideo and 
the most important national newspapers, like EL OBSERVADOR 
ECONOMICO.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Eduardo Dimas] </F>
  [Text] For a few months now, we have been receiving 
information on the United States' attempt to force the DPRK to 
allow inspections of their nuclear facilities under the pretext 
that this country is manufacturing or is currently in possession 
of atomic weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency has 
already checked those facilities on two separate occasions. 
Nevertheless, the U.S. Government continues to insist. 
  Recently, the UN Security Council asked North Korea to 
authorize inspections, which that government later rejected. The 
UN Security Council's petition was not mandatory. That same day, 
President William Clinton threatened to isolate the DPRK 
internationally if they persist in that position. 
  At the same time, the United States began sending Patriot 
missiles to South Korean territory and placed U.S. troops 
stationed on the peninsula on alert. The South Korean defense 
minister made militant statements in an obvious attempt to 
intensify the situation. The North Korean Government also 
mobilized its forces to reject any aggression. A state of war 
has been created, which does not benefit anyone in the world, 
especially the more powerful Asian countries like China and 
Japan, or other countries known to possess nuclear weapons, like 
India and Pakistan. 
  This situation has created a difference of opinion among 
regional analysts. For some, this is no more than a diplomatic 
arm-wrestling match, a contest for a more favorable position at 
the negotiating table. Others believe a real threat of war 
exists between the two Koreas, the consequences of which would 
be unpredictable for the region and for the world as a whole. 
  The moderate positions of China and Russia, who on repeated 
occasions have requested a continuation of negotiations between 
Washington and Pyongyang, have reduced the possibility of a 
harsher stance toward North Korea by the Security Council, in 
accordance, as usual, with Yankee wishes. 
  In any case, for those who believe that in these times, war 
is impossible because there is a new government in the United 
States, I would like to read this paragraph from the book, 
"Mandate for Change," a compilation by the Institute for 
Progressive Policy affiliated with the Council for Democratic 
Leadership, which is to be the leading book of the Clinton 
administration. 
  It reads: The next key challenge for collective security in 
the new period will be to give the United Nations the power to 
use preventive diplomacy. It goes on to emphasize: Of course, 
the United States should never renounce its prerogative to use 
unilateral force when its vital interests are threatened. 
  Until now, what the United States calls UN preventive 
diplomacy -- in other words, to do as it pleases -- has failed 
in the case of Korea. Therefore, I ask myself: Can one dismiss 
the possibility of a unilateral action by the United States? I 
do not think so.

<F P=106> [Report by Marta Moreno] </F>
  [Text] A delegation of 18 Chilean businessmen is visiting 
our country to establish possible trade deals with Cuba in 
divers areas of the economy. The meeting between these Chilean 
businessmen and representatives of various Cuban institutions 
was held in the (Tanganada) Hall of the Hotel Nacional. This 
meeting is sponsored by Conaf [expansion unknown] Inc. During 
the meeting, the Chilean businessmen were briefed on legal 
requirements, the banking system, personnel contracting, taxes, 
business facilities in general, and guarantees provided by Cuba 
to foreign businessmen. They were also briefed on the operation 
of mixed companies and the transactions needed to establish 
firms in the country. 
  [Begin unidentified Chilean businessman recording] I am 
essentially an exporter of medicines to Cuba. At the same time, 
I am trying to import some medicines from Cuba to Chile, namely 
vaccines. Right now, we are in the process of registering Cuban 
products in Chile, especially the vaccine against meningococcal 
meningitis, and I believe this will be approved within a short 
period of time. [end recording] 
  In the next few days, the Chilean businessmen will contact 
national organizations and companies in a quest for more 
information. In Cuba, there are more than 500 representative 
offices, which have invested in different areas of the economy, 
investments that are suitable for Cuba and the foreign investor.

  [Text] The presence of the Japanese Mitsubishi Company in 
Cuba has been confirmed by the presentation and display of its 
automobile products. The Mitsubishi Company has been announced 
as the first Japanese company to establish a long-range business 
deal in Cuba. Present in that investment also is the Sumitomo 
Trading Corporation [name given in English], one of the largest 
automobile companies in Japan. Mitsubishi declared the 
Panamanian company, International Engines, its representative in 
Cuba. This company has been operating in the Cuban automobile 
market for more than 10 years. 
  This is conceived as a short-term investment with an 
immediate impact on the Cuban tourism sector, although the 
Japanese managers have expressed interest in extending their 
investments into other economic areas, and have confirmed their 
confidence in Cuban economic growth. The Cuban party said that 
this investment implies the first economic rapprochement between 
Japan and Cuba.

  [Text] (Martin Roddin), representative of the Japanese 
Mitsubishi Automobile Corporation, has said in Havana that 
Mitsubishi is studying the possibility of establishing a 
dealership office in Cuba to sell vehicles and spare parts, in 
addition to offering maintenance services. 
  According to (Roddin), the Japanese company intends to sell 
a 
line of vehicles for tourism and rental service, as well as 
trucks for the sugar industry. (Roddin) ruled out an immediate 
decision on this project, however, because these are medium- and 
long-term prospects. 
  Today, a Japanese company delegation began a series of 
consultations with Cuban economic circles to evaluate the 
project. Mitsubishi is the tenth-largest automobile industry in 
the world, manufacturing a total of 2 million units annually.

<F P=106> [From the "Evening Information News"] </F>
  [Text] Since last weekend, electricity generation in Cuba 
has been seriously hampered because of breakdowns in 
thermoelectric plants located in various provinces of the 
nation. The demand for this service is much greater than the 
generating capacity, and therefore power outages of 8-10 hours 
daily are currently scheduled for the population. Originally, a 
lack of fuel forced thermoelectric plants to operate at lower 
capacity, and now, on top of this, is the problem of equipment 
breakdowns. 
  In a conversation with Jorge Carballo, the power supply 
chief 
at the Electrical Union of the Ministry of Basic Industry, the 
following was explained: 
  [Begin Carballo recording] We are experiencing very 
difficult 
times. On some days, we have no problems with the petroleum 
supply, but then on other days we lack petroleum, and then on 
other days it is the [words indistinct]. I can tell you that 
the current problem is not a lack of petroleum, but there will 
be a cutback in services because of breakdowns. There will be 
longer-than-normal power outages of 8-10 hours. Nevertheless, I 
hope that during the early hours of the day we will be able to 
[words indistinct], and that during the early hours we will not 
have power outages. [end recording] 
  A lack of spare parts for electric power plants together 
with 
the years the equipment has been operating and the continuous 
forced shutdowns have all affected electricity production. 
  [Begin Carballo recording] The trouble is that we are 
working 
without any spare parts. Can you imagine? If you have a 
thermoelectric system working at full capacity when the (words 
indistinct] fails you have a power outage. If you have a 
thermoelectric system working above capacity, when one of the 
[word indistinct] fails, what you do is turn on the [words 
indistinct], but service is not halted. 
  This is the accumulation of many small problems: It is the 
fuel problem, the quality of the fuel, the lack of maintenance, 
and the continuous shutdowns because of the lack of fuel. Some 
equipment is designed to be shut down and started up again, but 
other equipment is not designed for this. Some equipment is 
designed to run 24 hours a day. In terms of the equipment 
designed to work 24 hours a day, if you shut it down, start it 
up again, and shut it down again, little by little the equipment 
will eventually wear out. [end recording]

  [Text] An editorial in today's newspaper TRABAJADORES 
states: All the activities of the labor union movement converge 
in the struggle for efficiency. The traditional Assemblies of 
Production and Services will be replaced by a new type of 
meeting that will have the same sincere, critical, and 
self-analytical spirit established in the workers parliaments 
and will be called Assemblies for Economic Efficiency. 
  TRABAJADORES underscores that an immediate task for labor 
union organizations is the implementation of plans and measures 
and the solutions suggested by workers during the workers 
parliaments. Economically feasible criteria and suggestions 
should be grouped according to each level of labor union 
organization to unleash the consequent action by enterprises, 
branches, sectors, provinces, and organizations, so that 
everyone knows his specific responsibility. 
  In many work centers where concrete measures have been 
implemented, absenteeism has begun to decrease, interest in 
production has been reanimated, and workers make an effort to 
cut costs. 
  The Assemblies for Economic Efficiency, which will be held 
periodically, will follow up on the ideas and suggestions of the 
workers parliaments. The editorial goes on to say: We must 
maintain a constant teaching and learning presence at the 
centers and each contact must leave an impression on the 
workers. The parliaments taught us that the prestige of 
representing the class that governs the country is maximized 
through the active efforts of the labor union leader, wherever 
he may be, through effective communication with workers, and 
through the use of vivid language that conveys information, 
concepts, and ideas.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments carried on Havana 
radio and television in Spanish between 30 March and 4 April. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 30 March reports that 
solidarity 
groups from Ukraine are shipping 400 tons of milk to Cuba as a 
token of appreciation for the treatment provided to the 
Ukrainian children affected by the Chernobyl disaster. 
  Radio Reloj at 1506 GMT on 30 March reports that the vessel 
(Wals Wabi) owned by (Grupo Uno) is unloading 15,650 tons of 
bulk wheat in the Port of Havana. The ship, which is returning 
from a four-month journey, visited ports in Suriname, Brazil, 
France, and England where wheat was loaded. The ship has seven 
holds for freight. 
  Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 30 March reports that in 
Matanzas, 
milk production has increased, while the death rate for cattle 
has dropped considerably, compared to the same quarter of 1993. 
This report was released by Jorge Pena, a local Agriculture 
Ministry official. Pena said that milk production for the first 
quarter of 1994 increased by 1.5 million liters in comparison to 
the same period in 1993. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 31 March reports that the 
supply 
of recycled paper and cardboard to Havana City Province's main 
paper and cardboard recycling center has decreased by 
approximately 70 percent and that Cuba is buying old paper 
abroad in order to produce various types of containers, like egg 
cartons and ice cream cups. A recycling official stated the 
center is now recycling one ton a month, as opposed to the three 
tons per month it formerly recycled. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 31 March reports that six 
provinces -- with Havana Province in first place -- had 
fulfilled, as of 30 March, the sugarcane planting schedule that 
covers the period up to 31 March. Cuba attained 90 percent of 
this quarter's goal, planting 2,811 caballerias, a figure that 
may increase once the final calculations and adjustments are 
made. 
  Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 1 April reports that seven 
platoons from the Espana Republicana sugar agroindustrial 
complex in the municipality of Perico, Matanzas, have cut 1 
million arrobas of sugarcane this harvest. Two of these platoons 
have already cut 2 million arrobas and are striving to attain 
the third million. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 2 April reports that after 10 
years of inactivity, the Patricio Lumumba plant in Minas de 
Matahambre, Pinar del Rio Province, has resumed producing 
sulfuric acid. The director of the (Sulfo-Metales) enterprise 
said resuming production will help save the nation $69 per ton 
of sulfuric acid currently being imported. This plant is 
expected to produce some 35,000 tons of sulfuric acid yearly, in 
addition to byproducts. 
  Radio Reloj at 1501 GMT on 2 April reports that Jose Luis 
Arias Munoz, a Spanish communist residing in Switzerland, has 
made a personal donation of medicines worth $4,000 to the Centro 
Habana Pediatric and Teaching Hospital. This is Arias' third 
trip to Cuba and his second donation. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 2 April reports that a physical 
rehabilitation facility at the General Calixto Garcia Teaching 
Hospital has undergone a $50,000 renovation and that a new 
endoscopic, minimal-trauma surgery unit will be inaugurated soon. 
  Radio Rebelde Network at 1700 GMT on 4 April reports that 
the 
Spanish Ibero-Star company, which participates in the joint 
administration of the Tripton and Neptuno Hotels in Havana, has 
announced that these hotels will be refurbished to enhance 
service and attract more tourists, thus obtaining more currency. 
The general manager of these hotels said that rooms will be 
enlarged and all bathrooms and furniture replaced or renovated. 
We have also decided to build a larger kitchen here at the 
Neptuno to offer full pension service to clients, he said. 
Together with our Cuban partners, we hope to find, either in 
Mallorca or in Cuba itself, a discotheque expert because we are 
interested in establishing a discotheque in the Tripton Hotel.

  [Excerpts] The Justice and Peace Archdiocesan Commission in 
Port-au-Prince has published an overwhelming report on 
repression in Haiti, entitled "The Cry of the Executed People of 
Cite Soleil." [passage omitted] 
  Since the coup d'etat, Cite Soleil has been turned into a 
true refugee camp. About five Front for Haitian Advancement and 
Progress [FRAPH] offices keep the population in anguish and 
fear: one is located in Projet Drouillard and is headed by a man 
named Herve Black. Four other offices are located near the 
former Babeth Cinema and is headed by Gabriel Saint-Lot; on the 
wharf; in Soleil 4; and in Soleil 17. These offices make 
arrests, imprisonments, tortures, executions, and openly act in 
collusion with and under the protection of the Army. 
  In only two days, seven bodies were found in the area. On 16 
March, three bodies were found in Soleil 17; and on 17 March, 
four bodies were discovered in Cite Belacour and Cite Lumiere. 
The Sarthes slaughter, which occurred on the night of 2 
February, resulted in 12 deaths, one person missing, and one 
wounded. The missing persons are Jean-Pierre and Toussaint. 
Survivors from this same group of youths are still being pursued 
by the Army and FRAPH members. On 9 March in Soleil 9, Clotaire 
Francois, 23, was murdered with cold steel. Witnesses 
identified, among the attackers, a FRAPH member, Reverend 
Hubert, who leads a church in Soleil 17. The attackers heavily 
pressured the victims, who revealed the whereabouts of three 
other youths. 
  Finally, the Commission established a more or less final 
assessment of victims from that horrible day, 27 December 1993, 
when 37 people died, 23 disappeared, and 10 were wounded and 
[word indistinct] were recorded.

  [Text] The Committee for Research and Communication of the 
Haitian Religious Conference, CHR, published an Easter 
reflection in which it criticizes the attitude of the 
international community toward the Haitian crisis. The increase 
in crime and repression in Haiti coincides with the so-called 
parliamentary plan supported by the U.S. Administration, writes 
CHR. 
  After reading recent news releases by the UN/OAS civilian 
mission on increased violence in Haiti, the Haitian Religious 
Conference asserts that hands washed in vain by U.S. 
Administration authorities, and all those who together with them 
plan for the death of innocent people, are stained by their 
victims' blood. The Haitian Religious Conference especially 
denounces the contradictions and disparities between the 
international community's words and deeds in Haiti's case.

<F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Deputy Attorney General Miguel Montes Garcia, the 
special assistant prosecutor in charge of investigating the 
murder of Revolutionary Institutional Party [PRI] presidential 
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, has charged that several 
individuals acting according to plan took part in the crime. In 
other words, a plot existed and the individuals conspired with 
one another. 
  In a news release, Montes says that, according to 
investigations, Mario Aburto Martinez, Tranquilino Sanchez 
Venegas, and Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela -- the latter is a 
former Judicial Police member -- may have acted in concert. 
Montes also mentioned in the news release the simultaneous 
participation of Rodolfo Mayoral Esker, Rodolfo Rivapalacio, and 
two other people who have been identified visually but whose 
names and whereabouts are still unknown. Montes says the 
investigation could later be expanded to include a larger number 
of people. Here is the complete message that Montes read for the 
media this morning: 
  [Begin Montes recording] Ladies and gentlemen, as was 
reported in a release issued by this office on 31 March, we have 
found new evidence leading to several important details related 
to the Colosio assassination. 
  1. Several individuals participated in concert with the 
intention of killing Colosio. 
  2. So far, the simultaneous participation of the following 
individuals can be mentioned, although this does not rule out 
the possibility that the investigation might be expanded to 
include a larger number of people some time in the future: Mario 
Aburto Martinez, assassin; Tranquilino Sanchez, who watched 
General Delmiro Garcia Reyes, who was in charge of security at 
the outer perimeter, thereby making it possible for Aburto to 
approach and walk up beside Colosio; Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, 
who pushed back the crowd making a path for the individual I 
will mention next; one participant, visually identified but 
whose name and whereabouts are unknown, who stood in front of 
Colosio and then threw himself to the ground with the purpose of 
blocking Colosio's movements and permitting Aburto to put 
himself in a position to fire on Colosio; one participant, 
identified visually, a man who was wearing glasses, but whose 
name and whereabouts are unknown, who blocked other people's 
movements until he positioned himself on the candidate's left 
side, crouching moments before Aburto fired; Rodolfo Mayoral, 
son of Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, who pushed and blocked 
Colonel Federico Antonio Reynaldo del Pozo, the man in charge of 
security at the inner perimeter, diverting the colonel's 
attention and forcing him to relax his vigilance; Rodolfo 
Rivapalacio, who hired Sanchez, Mayoral Valenzuela, and Rodolfo 
Mayoral to be part of the group seemingly created to maintain 
order. This is according to the list of the members of the 
group. The last name on the list has been altered. 
  3. Similarly, it has been confirmed that, during the meeting 
and before the assassination, Sanchez and Rodolfo Mayoral stayed 
with Aburto and chatted with him in a clear demonstration they 
knew one another. 
  4. The facts, based mainly on video footage and pictures 
studied by the authorities, constitute firm evidence, reinforced 
by eyewitness testimony, that confirms the actions perpetrated 
by the accused and validate the origin and authenticity of the 
material analyzed. Other circumstances, which are part of the 
investigation and which also point unmistakably to a criminal 
conspiracy, are also being studied. 
  Sanchez, Mayoral Valenzuela, Mayoral Eskes, and Rivapalacio 
have been handed over to judicial authorities. [end recording]

Monterrey -- live] 
  [Text] At 0900 this morning a strong explosion destroyed a 
branch of Banorte, located on Manuel L. Barragan and Tlalpan 
Avenues in the neighborhood of Valle de Anaguas in San Nicolas 
Uzgarte, a metropolitan municipality of Monterrey. So far, it 
has not been possible to determine the cause of the explosion. 
What was confirmed is that the building was totally destroyed 
after its personnel and some clients had already entered. The 
strong explosion also damaged some homes adjacent to the 
building. Some vehicles were also totally destroyed. Only 
license plates were left of some vehicles, which were left in 
pieces. 
  Red Cross units of San Nicolas Uzgarte Municipality, the Red 
Cross, the Green Cross, firefighters, and State Governor 
Socrates Rizo Garcia are at the scene of the tragedy. Also, 
Attorney General Benito Morales is there. State officials are 
trying to rescue the victims of the tragedy, which occurred at 
0900 this morning in the Banorte branch, located on Manuel L. 
Barragan and Tlalpan Avenues in the neighborhood of Valle de 
Anaguas in San Nicolas Uzgarte in Nuevo Leon. So far it has 
been impossible to determine the number of victims. We know 
that there were some clients and personnel inside. The cause of 
the explosion is not known. For the time being, work is under 
way to rescue the victims of the Banorte explosion, which was 
totally destroyed by a strong explosion.

<F P=106> [Report by Joaquin Alvarez] </F>
  [Text] The reform of the power structure and the 
strengthening of the federal system, which will give the nation 
a "new and equitable political balance," are irreversible 
pledges that Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon will champion and 
strengthen, according to the National Executive Council of the 
PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party]. Meanwhile, former PRI 
President Pedro Ojeda Paullada defended the substitute 
presidential candidate's political experience and role as 
activist, stating "he is certainly no newcomer." 
  During an interview yesterday, Ojeda Paullada advised 
Zedillo 
to increase his public consultations and to discuss the party's 
basic political proposals in an effort to place his personal 
stamp on the presidential campaign. He referred to the PRI's 
political situation and said Fernando Ortiz Arana's timely 
refusal to accept the party's nomination prevented an internal 
split. 
  Meanwhile, Ernesto Zedillo's campaign team said that over 
the 
weekend the presidential candidate studied the political 
strategies he will implement in the next few months, adding, 
"they will be consistent with the democratic principles of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio and the party." A source within the campaign 
coordination team said Zedillo will design his own political 
philosophy and that it will be consistent with the statements, 
pledges, and thesis he defended when he was in charge of the 
Programming and Budget Secretariat, which no longer exists, and 
the Public Education Secretariat. The source said: "Zedillo is 
well aware of the nation's problems. Let us not forget he was 
directly involved in the state reform strategy and policy, one 
of the current administration's leading achievements." 
  Pedro Ojeda Paullada, former president of the PRI's National 
Executive Council, said the candidates' nomination to the post 
of assembly member, deputy, and senator will entail some 
modifications within the party, but he denied that these include 
changes in the PRI's national leadership. He also said there is 
no statute that prevents national leader Fernando Ortiz Arana 
from being nominated to the post of senator and remaining in 
charge of the organization. 
  At about 2100 last night -- the eve of the formal start of 
the campaign, which promises numerous political activities in 
Mexico City -- a group of community leaders and land holders 
from Magdalena Contreras and Santa Ursula personally delivered a 
list of proposals to resolve land ownership problems to Zedillo. 
Raymundo Munoz Ocadiz, adviser to the group, said Zedillo 
agreed to contact Manuel Jimenez Guzman, PRI leader in Mexico 
City, and that the two may discuss the group's problems with 
Federal District Mayor Manuel Aguilera Gomez and Agrarian Reform 
Secretary Victor Cervera Pacheco. 
  According to Ocadiz's version, Zedillo "promised to defend 
and protect Los Dinamos ecological reserve in Magdalena 
Contreras." The meeting between the community leaders, the land 
holders, and Zedillo was held at his private residence in Cruz 
Verde 172, Lomas Quebradas neighborhood, southern Mexico City. 
  Sources within the PRI's National Executive Council 
consulted 
yesterday said Luis Donaldo Colosio's public pledges to reform 
power and to strengthen the federal system as well as to bolster 
the autonomy of the municipalities will be endorsed and 
championed by Ernesto Zedillo, who will even "strengthen" these 
pledges. "PRI members will fulfill all of the pledges assumed by 
the man who was our candidate," the sources confirmed. One 
source recalled that the issues of a new balance between the 
Union's branches -- reform, particularly within the judicial 
branch, and the strengthening of the federal system -- remain 
firm. 
  At the same time, Pedro Ojeda Paullada, currently a federal 
deputy, openly defended Zedillo's political experience; his role 
as an activist; and his well-known "capability, skill, 
knowledge, intelligence, and sensibility" to lead the country 
should he win the election. Asked about the criticism 
surrounding Colosio Murrieta's substitute, Ojeda Paullada 
adamantly said: "He is certainly no newcomer. Quite the 
contrary, he is knowledgeable about the party because he 
participated in Carlos Salinas' campaign. At that time, he was 
programming and budget secretary, and, until recently, he was 
public education secretary. These secretariats gave him an 
ample vision of the country and its current reality." 
  Referring to the PRI's internal situation he said: The fact 
that Fernando Ortiz Arana did not vie for the post (the 
presidency) shows there is no division because this would have 
engendered another position, and, at this time, I only see one 
-- one that supports Zedillo Ponce de Leon's candidacy. 
  Meanwhile, Miguel Angel Barberena, leader of the National 
Front of Organizations and Citizens, said Zedillo's candidacy 
restores confidence because it endorses the late Luis Donaldo 
Colosio's ideology and goals. He said there is unity within the 
PRI and its members are advancing united toward an election 
victory in August.

<F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] As of today, the Bank of Mexico [Banxico] will have 
independent control of internal loan activities to ensure 
stability for the nation's currency. Miguel Mancera Aguayo also 
becomes the bank's first governor. So begins a new phase for 
Banxico as an autonomous organization, within an atmosphere of 
stability in the area of monetary policy, guarantees in the 
fight against inflation, and the highest figure in international 
reserves the country has ever seen. This means the central 
financial institution will have independent control over 
domestic credit and no government agency will have the authority 
to order it to adjudicate funds to any other. This will ensure 
the stability of the national currency's buying power. 
  Miguel Mancera Aguayo will head the organization as its 
first 
governor. He was a key figure in restricting the Mexican 
economy. He had the ability to remain calm even in the most 
difficult of times. 
  [Begin Mancera recording] The Board of Governors must 
administrate Banxico's credit portfolio to attain stability in 
the national currency's buying power [end recording] 
  Mancera Aguayo is the author of the consumer price stability 
plan, which served as the basic economic policy strategy. He 
was tasked with lowering the inflation rate from 160 percent in 
1987 to annual figures under zero [as heard] and monthly figures 
of only four-tenths of a percent. Banxico's independence is 
another reason for the local and international financial 
community to feel confident. It confirms the continuity and 
honesty of the current economic plans. 
  Miguel Mancera Aguayo will hold the post of bank governor 
for 
three years and nine months. Different from the past, Mancera 
will not be alone at the head of Banxico because he will have 
four assistant governors to fill out the Board of Directors.

  [Text] San Jose, 4 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, Costa Rican 
Security Minister Luis Fishman played down a U.S. State 
Department report that "money laundering" and drug trafficking 
and consumption are on the rise in Costa Rica. Fishman said the 
report admits that "there is virtually no corruption" in Costa 
Rica's police force, which is prevented from taking more 
effective action against drug trafficking because of a lack of 
financial resources. "I am proud because they say there is no 
corruption," the minister told ACAN-EFE, saying that contrary to 
what Washington says, Costa Rica has dealt "harsh blows" to drug 
traffickers in recent years despite the limited resources. 
Fishman said he "disagrees" with the assertion that Costa Rican 
policemen are unprofessional. He said that Puerto Limon on the 
Atlantic coast is a problem area and added that many resources 
have been allocated to fight drug trafficking and consumption. 
  The State Department's annual report, released today, 
highlighted the progress made by Central American governments, 
with the exception of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, in the fight 
against drug trafficking and money laundering. The report says 
the "laundering of drug money" is particularly serious in Costa 
Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua, but virtually nonexistent in El 
Salvador. 
  The State Department praised Guatemala the most for its 
cooperation with Washington in several campaigns to eradicate 
cocaine and opium and to arrest drug traffickers. According to 
the State Department, meager resources and a lack of 
professionalism among security services preclude significant 
progress in the counternarcotics struggle in Costa Rica. The 
report says Puerto Limon has become the main point of contact 
between the Colombian island of San Andres, the Nicaraguan coast 
on the Caribbean, and the United States. At the same time, 
however, the report said there is virtually no corruption.

  [Text] An autopsy has revealed that the U.S. military man 
who died while playing with a hand grenade had taken three types 
of drugs. Dr. Juan Mateo Llort, director of the Forensic 
Medicine Institute, has confirmed that a toxicological 
examination on the body of U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Julio Ramon 
Rivera, who died early Sunday, reveals he was under the 
influence of three illegal drugs when he pulled the pin on the 
grenade that killed him and wounded four other people. Based on 
this conclusion, Dr. Llort will ask the U.S. Embassy in El 
Salvador to perform drug tests on all Embassy officials. Dr. 
Llort said Rivera died from multiple trauma caused by the 
explosion of the grenade, which he handled recklessly. 
  [Begin Llort recording] Only a person under the influence of 
drugs would have played with a live grenade, thinking it was a 
toy. The three drugs found were 25 nanograms of marijuana, 276 
nanograms of meta-amphetamine, and 440 nanograms of 
phenobarbital -- a considerable quantity. [end recording] 
  The official U.S. Embassy report says Lt. Col. Rivera had 
gone to the National Civilian Police in the Zacamil neighborhood 
to meet his bodyguards who were being released. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] He was meeting some 
of his bodyguards. That is when he received the grenade, which 
exploded. 
  [Dr. Llort] Routine toxicological tests should be performed 
on these kinds of people, who should be setting an example for 
the rest of the country. [end recording] 
  Lt. Col. Rivera was second in command of the U.S. military 
advisers who have been in the country for the past two years. 
His body was flown in a C-130 plane to Puerto Rico, where he 
resided.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Zelara; from the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] magistrates have 
confirmed that the call for the presidential runoff election 
will officially be announced on Tuesday. According to Rutilio 
Aguilera, no challenge has been received so far against the 
final vote tally. If this holds true until the official deadline 
expires on Monday, it will allow the TSE to announce the 
official call on Tuesday. Aguilera noted that the four principal 
shortcomings detected in the 20 March elections will be averted 
in the runoff because corrective measures have been taken. 
  [Begin Aguilera recording, in progress] ...fortunately there 
has not been any challenges, and also because of the delay with 
which the political institutes, via their representatives, are 
conducting them. As for your question, we have clearly seen 
that as of last Wednesday -- the date the final vote tally 
document was signed -- political groups were given 72 hours to 
submit requests to nullify the results. Because no such request 
has been presented, as I noted earlier, the TSE will have 48 
hours to issue the decree after the deadline expires. The TSE 
will first confirm the results. Second, it will issue the 
decree calling for a runoff election. [end recording] 
  For his part, Eduardo Colindres, the Christian Democratic 
Party's TSE magistrate, noted that the organization has 
initiated a campaign to urge citizens to notify the TSE of any 
problems encountered in their electoral districts or any 
problems with their electoral identification cards. He also said 
plans are being made to prepare identification and electoral 
identification cards. 
  [Begin Colindres recording, in progress] ...the preparation 
of the citizens' identification and electoral identification 
cards. In other words, these new documents will replace the 
electoral identification cards and the people's personal 
identification cards. We have implemented an information 
campaign to advise citizens where they can vote and how to vote 
in an effort to avert problems that occurred in San Salvador. We 
will conduct an orientation and information campaign on how and 
where to vote. [end recording] 
  The call for the presidential runoff election will be made 
officially on Tuesday, provided the departmental electoral 
boards in San Salvador and Cuscatlan turn in the consolidated 
results of the 20 March elections for deputies in accordance 
with the electoral code.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 4 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- The Guatemalan 
Government announced today that civil rights will not be 
suspended in the nation despite the instability created by the 
weekend assassination of Constitutionality Court President 
Epaminondas Gonzalez. In a State Council meeting held today, 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and his ministers decided not to 
declare a state of exception [estado de excepcion] and to 
continue to monitor the situation in upcoming working sessions, 
according to government spokesman Felix Loarca. 
  After the assassination of Gonzalez, 62, some sectors had 
asked that civil rights be suspended because of a prevailing 
climate of violence. Human rights organizations, however, 
rejected a possible suspension of rights, arguing that such a 
suspension would pave the way for repression. In addition, the 
Army said it would support the measure if it was approved by the 
executive. 
  [In related news, Guatemala City Teleonce Television in 
Spanish at 1900 GMT on 4 April, in its "Telepress" newscast, 
broadcasts a one-minute recorded interview with Government 
Minister Danilo Pariello, who was interviewed on his way to the 
State Council meeting called to discuss the possible suspension 
of rights in Guatemala. Noting that the session was called "to 
assess the serious situation caused by the Constitutionality 
Court president's death," Pariello adds that "pertinent measures 
have already been taken." Asked whether a "state of exception" 
will indeed be declared, he says this "will have to be decided 
at the cabinet meeting." He notes that any state of exception 
that might be declared would be "one of prevention, and one 
which could be declared immediately."]

  [Text] The possibility of establishing a state of 
exceptional measures in Guatemala to halt the nationwide wave of 
crime, violence, and terrorism continues to be a topic of 
discussion between the president and his ministers, but, for the 
time being, such a decision has not been adopted, according to 
Felix Loarca Guzman, public relations secretary of the 
Presidency. 
  The nation's situation will continue to be studied at future 
cabinet meetings, but, for the time being, this measure is on 
hold. Although the death of Constitutionality Court President 
Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon was one of the arguments used to 
raise the possibility of resorting to such a measure, the 
discussion at today's cabinet meeting centered on the search for 
those responsible for the crime. The government spokesman said 
security personnel are working hard on the investigation. 
  Meanwhile, it has been learned in legislative circles that 
Congress, through a resolution, might recommend that the 
executive branch decree a state of exceptional measures. At this 
time, opinions are divided among legislators about whether a 
state of exceptional measures should be established to control 
the extreme violence in the country. Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla 
Vega has said the government of Ramiro de Leon Carpio should 
immediately establish a state of exceptional measures. Congress 
President Vinicio Villar, however, does not agree that the 
executive branch should adopt such a measure.

  [Excerpt] Over the 1 April weekend, President Carlos 
Roberto Reina announced that the economic cabinet will announce 
this week the nine measures to be implemented by the current 
administration. Although he did not specify what type of 
measures his economic cabinet will announce, Reina reiterated 
that the measures are necessary "and will be disclosed this 
week." 
  Regarding the last increase in fuel prices, Reina said: "We 
are doing the best we can within our means. We cannot avoid 
certain adverse situations, but everything will be done to 
increase social spending." He added, "The people have given me 
their trust, and I ask them to continue to do so." 
  Meanwhile, Reina recalled that the increases are not the 
only 
measures that require unselfishness. He stressed, "unselfishness 
is also fighting corruption of all types, and this is what we 
are doing; unselfishness is telling the people the truth and 
meeting all challenges courageously." 
  Regarding the substantial increase in the price of kerosene 
for home use, Reina noted that the product had been subsidized, 
"and if you want the real price, you will see it is still higher 
than the fixed price." He argued, "I have tried to prevent this 
as much as I could. Nevertheless, the government must continue 
with its plan; otherwise, we will return to the high levels of 
corruption that prevailed in this country in the past." 
<H5>  Huge Debt of the Wealthy </H5>
  Referring to the economic crisis the country is facing, 
Reina 
pointed out that the government's plan is to increase social 
spending to ease the population's hardships. He said, "Our goal 
is to increase social spending to as much as 35 percent of the 
national budget." Nevertheless, he said it is first necessary to 
correct situations like the one detected in the National 
Enterprise for Electric Power, where the government discovered 
that "wealthy people" owe some 190 million lempiras. 
  Reina went on to explain: "It is wealthy people, not poor 
people. How can we allow this to continue? There are situations 
the government will explain.... These are extremely dramatic 
aspects of recent circumstances." 
  Asked if he was bowing to pressure from international 
financial institutions [IFI's], he answered, "I will never bow 
to the dictates of the IFI's." He argued, "I have the highest 
opinion of the mandate, but we have inherited a very difficult 
situation that must be faced with honesty." 
<H5>  Tragedy in Mexico </H5>
  Regarding the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
presidential candidate of the Mexican Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, Reina said it would be a tragedy to return 
to a time of assassinations and security threats to political 
figures. He said he hopes the Mexican people will recover from 
the shock of the incident, "and that this barbaric conduct will 
never again be emulated in Honduras." Reina believes this tragic 
incident in Mexico will not have repercussions in the Central 
American countries. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Adolfo Miranda Saenz] </F>
  [Text] No one got an absolute majority in the Atlantic 
Coast elections, but given the conditions, regardless of the 
number of votes garnered by each candidate, the percentages 
indicate that the big winner was the Constitutionalist Liberal 
Party (PLC), and the big loser was the Sandinist National 
Liberation Front (FSLN). 
  The Sandinists, having accumulated vast resources during the 
years when they were in power, were unable to put in a strong 
showing against the PLC, which was transformed from a small 
party to a big adversary. It joined the fray on its own and 
bravely fought to win a decent percentage, which is an 
undeniable victory. 
  The FSLN may try to minimize the failure it suffered, 
winning 
such a small percentage in spite of all its power and resources. 
But the fact remains that in comparison to the votes it 
garnered, the PLC's percentage--won without joining the parties 
that make up the National Opposition Union (UNO) or any other 
liberal parties--suggests that if the liberals were to lead a 
democratic alliance, they could defeat the FSLN in 1996. 
  The FSLN has been unable to recover from its electoral 
defeat 
of 25 February 1990 because it has been unable to correct its 
mistakes. Its two main factions have said that they recognize 
their errors, but no faction has come out and identified by name 
those who committed abuses under Laws 85, 86, and 88. Nor is 
there any talk of returning the ill-gotten gains, expelling 
corrupt members, or fixing the blame for the government's 
leading us into a chaos from which we have not yet emerged. 
  In other words, they have limited themselves to expressing 
repentance, but only in words...while the fact is that they left 
our country in ruins, with 50,000 dead, widows, orphans, blind 
people, amputees, etc., plus the tragic fact that we have 
regressed three decades in history, becoming the most backward 
and impoverished country in the Americas. 
  On the Atlantic Coast, in contrast, people know that in 
Managua a man accused of being a fascist, ultrarightist, 
radical, mean, corrupt, and the embodiment of Somozism, as mayor 
has carried out more development projects and accomplished more 
for the people than the Sandinists and the current government 
combined. 
  That is to say that everything the Sandinists and the 
officials of the current government have said against Arnoldo 
Aleman is nothing but words, in contrast to a man who has 
responded with deeds. This situation leads me to the conclusion 
that since Arnoldo Aleman poses a real political threat to them, 
they have tried to push him out of the race by portraying him as 
the most terrible thing on earth in order to discredit him. 
  But that tactic has not yielded any results, although I 
confess that I, like others, believed them for a while. The 
tactic of tarring a candidate as a Somozist to oust him from the 
political arena did not work in 1990, but they did not learn 
their lesson. The percentages obtained by the PLC in the 
Atlantic Coast elections show that our people are not swayed by 
mere words; they know how to evaluate deeds. 
  A mayor who can show visible accomplishments that cannot be 
hidden or denied deserves respect. He has been able to 
revitalize liberalism in a country where, not too long ago, 
admitting to being a liberal was tantamount to pleading guilty 
to a crime before the accusing finger of the "immaculate" 
Sandinists, who have been very good at accusing and maligning 
others, but incapable of being honestly and clearly critical of 
their own corruption, beyond superficial and ambiguous words. 
  That is why the people held them accountable in the 1990 
elections, and have just done so again in the 1994 elections on 
the Atlantic Coast, even though they are celebrating their 
"triumph" (?). The votes won by the PLC, added to those cast for 
other non-Sandinist political groups, confirm that the FSLN is a 
losing party whose image of failure will be difficult to shed 
between now and 1996. 
  We liberals--all liberals--must acknowledge this triumph by 
Dr. Arnoldo Aleman and the PLC, and must close ranks to form a 
unified movement. This great effort by the PLC deserves our 
support. Those Nicaraguans who do not want a return to Somozism 
or the continuation of Sandinism in power should close ranks and 
not fall into the trap of diluting our strength or discrediting 
the mayor of Managua, blindly accepting the accusation that he 
is a "Somozist," a well-worn ruse often employed by the 
Sandinists. 
  The results of the Atlantic Coast elections, with the 
undeniable liberal triumph of the PLC, should cause us to stop 
and reflect and rethink our political strategy. The FSLN's 
emphatic denunciation of Arnoldo Aleman should not prevent us 
from supporting the PLC and the mayor of Managua. The FSLN has 
Dr. Arnoldo Aleman and the PLC in its sights because it knows 
that this force can defeat it at the head of a democratic 
alliance. 
  Those of us who, without being Sandinist militants, at one 
time supported the FSLN, without asking or getting anything in 
return because we were doing it for Nicaragua's sake, have the 
most right to demand redress for the harm they did and the 
deception they perpetrated. We also have the right to demand 
that they drop their aggressive and derogatory remarks about 
other politicians whom they accuse of corruption, because those 
"corrupt" people have shown by their deeds--not their 
words--that they are better than the Sandinists. As the old 
saying goes, people who live in glass houses should not throw 
stones.

<F P=106> [Article by Heloisa Magalhaes from Buenos Aires] </F>
  [Text] The Chinese telephone network grew by 51 percent in 
1993 with the installation of 5.83 million phones, a little less 
than the total number of lines Brazil had in 1992. This is the 
largest, most booming market in the world in this field. In 
face of this market force, the Chinese Communications Ministry 
has sent a strong message regarding deregulation policy to the 
representatives of the International Telecommunications Union 
which is sponsoring its first meeting aimed at developing 
countries. 
  Zhu Gaofeng, Chinese vice minister of Posts and 
Telecommunications, will visit Brasilia on 4 April. He said: 
"It is not possible to follow only one development model in the 
field of telecommunications; there is not one model that can be 
adapted for all countries. Developing countries have become the 
greatest market in this field, which is why international 
financial institutions cannot establish short-term conditions. 
Partnerships with countries that need a lot of investment must 
follow a model of equal and mutual benefit." 
  He is negotiating with the Brazilian Government the first 
stage toward a possible "joint venture" [preceding two words in 
English] in the field of telecommunications and postal services. 
Based on a scientific and technological cooperation agreement 
signed between the two governments in Beijing in 1993, the 
partnership foresees the integration of private companies like 
Promon Telecommunications, Darum, and Ericsson. 
  These cooperation agreements will benefit: 
  The postal system: through development of a new postal 
policy, organization of the postal network, administration of 
services, marketing, courier, payment orders, and manufacture of 
new equipment. 
  The telecommunications system: through a new policy for 
voice 
and data transmission services, rural communication using 
satellites, point-to-point and mobile systems; through fiber 
optics; through administration and planning of telephone 
networks and value-added services. 
  The agreement also contemplates the joint development of 
telecommunications equipment.

miner in the village of Parima, in the country's Amazon region. 
  According to official reports, the Brazilian miner -- who 
was 
known as Franco -- shot at a Venezuelan patrol when the patrol 
found an illegal camp in Parima, which served as a base for gold 
and diamond mining. 
  Brazilians Antonio Edilmar Ribeiro and Cicero Eduardo Britto 
were arrested and are being held in Puerto Ayacucho, the capital 
of the Amazon province.

  [Text] Caracas, 4 Apr (EFE) -- Today, Peru officially 
presented its request to return to the Andean Pact -- a request 
that was accepted -- and said it will "fully resume all of its 
commitments" on macroeconomic issues and joint commercial 
negotiations that bind the five members of the Cartagena 
Agreement. Peru's return was approved at the 70th period of 
sessions of the Cartagena Agreement Commission, which was 
inaugurated in Caracas today. 
  The Peruvian delegation presented its request to the 
Bolivian, Colombian, Ecuadoran, and Venezuelan commissions. The 
proposal, which included the terms for Peru's return to the 
Andean Pact after nearly two years of absence, was approved 
unanimously. Peru was authorized to continue as an observer in 
the regional organization's internal negotiations to establish a 
common custom duties tariff, which is now being discussed by the 
remaining members of the Andean Pact. 
  The Cartagena Agreement Commission's Decree No. 353 declared 
that now that Peru has returned to its full commitments within 
the Andean Pact it will be allowed to start incorporating 
products into the free trade zone -- products to be included 
under a 31 December 1994 customs tariff of 0-5 percent. 
Likewise, bilateral agreements on commercial integration signed 
by Peru with the rest of the Andean Pact member-states will 
continue to be valid until all of the products are gradually and 
concurrently incorporated into the Andean Pact system. 
According to the commission's statement, Peru's reentry into 
the organization highlights the need for Andean Pact countries 
to reinforce their original purpose of providing a mechanism to 
expedite the process of bilateral integration. 
  Foreign Trade Institute Minister Albert Poletto said Peru's 
return to the Andean Pact "marked an important milestone in the 
Cartagena Agreement." Poletto stressed that the establishment 
of a common customs tariff is an important pending matter that 
must be resolved by the Andean Pact at the Cartagena Agreement 
Commission meeting being held in Caracas. Poletto added that 
another issue that requires agreement by the Andean partners is 
the need to increase the presence of the Andean Pact in the 
international trade sector.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina began his 
official visit to Uruguay by meeting with President Luis Alberto 
Lacalle in Montevideo. Robaina's agenda in Uruguay includes 
meetings with Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu, political 
leaders, bankers, and businessmen. 
  In initial statements to the media in Montevideo, Foreign 
Minister Robaina said he told President Lacalle of Cuba's 
efforts to spur economic openness. The Cuban foreign minister 
reaffirmed that Cuba prefers investments from Latin American 
countries but welcomes investments from any country. According 
to Roberto Robaina, foreign investors find tourism, oil, nickel, 
citrus, and general agriculture the most attractive areas for 
investment. 
  Foreign Minister Robaina will conclude his official visit to 
Uruguay on 6 April, when he will travel to Argentina, Ecuador, 
Peru, and Paraguay. The visit to Paraguay is unofficial because 
Cuba does not have diplomatic relations with that country.

  [Text] The week began with a new initiative by the 
political parties to unblock the crisis situation, notably an 
ultimatum that is scheduled to expire at the beginning of this 
week. 
  Last week, Front for Haitian Advancement and Progress; 
Hubert 
de Ronceray's Mobilization For National Development; the 
National Conference; and the Congress of Haitian People for 
National Rescue submitted a joint resolution demanding a 
solution to the political crisis. The leaders of these political 
parties suggested the definitive closing of the file on 
negotiating the return of President Aristide, the restoration of 
state authority, the priority of a national constitutional 
solution, the formation of an ad hoc government capable of 
managing the embargo and executing a precise political agenda, 
and finally, the organization of general elections. 
  The promoters of this resolution assert they have received a 
very large consensus on this proposal, a copy of which was sent 
to the Army General Staff, the Chamber of Deputies, as well as 
organizations and institutions from civilian society. In this 
resolution, an ultimatum was given to parliament. Parliament 
should come to a decision on the situation no later than this 
week.

<F P=106> [Report by Jaime Flores from Tijuana, Baja California; from </F>
the "ACIR Radio News" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Flores] I want to report that agents from the 
Attorney General's Office [PGR] sent to Tijuana have started to 
detain all of those who were part of Luis Donaldo Colosio's 
security team for the 23 March event. Roberto Cardenas Sanchez 
was detained at his business this morning. At about 1230, he 
entered the PGR building in Tijuana. 
  His wife has gone to see Ramon Del Cid Valenzuela, commander 
of the Federal Judicial Police [PJF] in Ensenada, to intercede 
on his behalf. She says her husband had nothing to do with the 
23 March events. She said they arrived at his place of business 
early this morning and that her husband was detained by PGR 
agents who took him to the PGR offices in Tijuana. It was 
learned that five other people also were arrested today by PJF 
agents for their alleged involvement in the Colosio case. 
  It has been learned that one of the arrested men is 
(Humberto 
Sanoja Morrel), a former state traffic and transportation 
official in the (Xicoten Catleiva) government. Many of the 
family members who are outside the PGR offices refuse to talk to 
the press. It also has been learned that Miguel Angel Suarez was 
removed from the State Judicial Police. His name also appears on 
the list of people responsible for security at the 23 March 
event. There are reports that Miguel Angel Suarez was drunk when 
he was arrested, and, at the time of his arrest, he allegedly 
was in possession of cocaine. Another man arrested is Genaro 
Valle. Valle was head of the Playas de Tijuana delegation. Two 
U.S. citizens accused him of extortion. In other words, arrests 
are continuing in Tijuana. All of these arrests are connected 
with the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio in Lomas Taurinas. 
  [Station announcer at Radio ACIR's Mexico City studios] 
Thank 
you for your report. 
  [Flores] Good evening. 
  [Station announcer] That is what is happening with the 
current investigations into Colosio's assassination. There are 
also rumors that some federal agencies are conducting unofficial 
parallel investigations into this matter -- parallel to the 
official investigations being conducted by the special assistant 
prosecutor appointed by the president of the republic. These 
parallel inquiries are reportedly being conducted at the request 
and suggestion of Luis Donaldo Colosio's widow Diana Laura 
Riojas. 
  If this is confirmed, it would be a serious matter. 
Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo has been quoted as saying 
that only one investigation will be conducted. Nevertheless, it 
has been learned that some federal agencies, unidentified 
federal agencies, have their own people in Tijuana investigating 
the matter because their superiors want to have first-hand 
information of what is going on. If this is true, they are 
violating the pact to find the truth, a pact requested by the 
president of the republic himself.

<F P=106> [Report by Edwin Gongora; from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Drug expert Carlos Aviles reported that U.S. Embassy 
personnel are involved in a drug network in El Salvador. Aviles 
added that the incident which resulted in the death of 
Lieutenant Colonel Ramon Rivera can only be explained by his 
emotional state as Rivera's autopsy revealed that he had used a 
considerable amount of marijuana and meta-amphetamines. The drug 
expert said meta-amphetamines are only produced in the United 
States; thus the officer had brought it into the country and 
committed a serious crime by doing so. 
  [Begin Aviles recording] How does this make the U.S. Army 
and 
Government look? How do they look when one of their soldiers 
brings meta-amphetamines from the United States to our country? 
Drug consumption....[pauses] Marijuana is a drug that Rivera 
could have bought here or in Guatemala, but it is still a very 
serious crime. This shows that our government must take a 
stronger stand and demand that foreign personnel in our country 
meet some basic requirements. [end recording] 
  Aviles thinks our nation is not respected because we do not 
require U.S. military delegation members to pass drug tests. 
  [Begin Aviles recording] I have said this for several 
months. 
I have said that we must more strict. Nationalism is not 
something found only in songs. It requires us to ensure that our 
Constitution and laws are respected. Unfortunately, nobody has 
paid any attention to me. Today, sadly we see how another 
scandal has erupted that has shown not only that the officer 
used marijuana and meta-amphetamines but that meta-amphetamines 
are powerful, synthetic stimulants that make cocaine look like 
breath mints. [end recoding] 
  According to Aviles, U.S. diplomats should practice what 
they 
preach in U.S. counternarcotics efforts because this is not the 
first time U.S. Embassy personnel have been involved in 
drug-related incidents.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by correspondent Mara Rivera, from the </F>
Supreme Electoral Tribunal Office in Panama City, with Julio 
Miller, Panama City Circuito RPC Television news director, in 
the studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Rivera] Good morning, dear listeners. A few moments 
ago a ruling was handed down in the case of [former Panama City 
Mayor] Mayin Correa, condemning Mrs. Correa. The sentence handed 
down is 187 days in prison and the suspension of citizen's 
rights, disqualifying her from holding public office for one 
year. It is noted that, according to Article 82 of the penal 
code, the prison sentence handed down can be converted into a 
60-day fine, considering the salary she received at the time the 
crime was committed. That is, she must pay a fine equivalent to 
60 days, in accordance with the salary she received while she 
was mayor. 
  She is disqualified from holding public office. The other 
people involved in this case, Mr. Juan Domingo Diaz, Alexis 
Morales, and Enrique Delgado Bolanos also received rulings. Juan 
Domingo Diaz and Alexis Morales were acquitted. Mr. Enrique 
Delgado Bolanos was sentenced to two months in prison, which can 
also be converted to the payment of a fine. 
  We learned here at the Electoral Tribunal that Mrs. Correa 
can run as candidate for the post of mayor. She cannot, however, 
assume the post -- should she be elected with the necessary 
votes. In this case, the post would have to be filled by her 
alternate, her first alternate. I do not know if Mr. Miller has 
anything else. 
  [Miller] Yes, Mara. Let us repeat the sentence handed down. 
Also, can she fill the post, after she serves the sentence 
handed down? Go ahead. 
  [Rivera] The ruling condemns her. The sentence condemns her. 
She is sentenced to 187 days, which can be converted to a 60-day 
fine. Then there is the sentence suspending her citizen's rights 
and disqualifying her from holding a public post for one year. 
After serving the sentence for one year, she can fill the post. 
In other words, if she is elected, she can fill the post of 
mayor after one year. In the meantime, her alternate would have 
to be in charge. 
  [Miller] What other alternative does she have, following the 
sentence handed down by the tribunal, Mara? 
  [Rivera] We were told she can submit an appeal. Nothing has 
been established yet because the sentence was just handed down. 
We understand her attorneys will immediately file an appeal with 
the tribunal. 
  [Miller] Thank you, Mara, for this last-minute report.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Fernando Cardenal] </F>
  [Text] In 1996, a large number of political parties will be 
presented to the Nicaraguan people. Will there be 15 or 20? We 
do not yet know. 
  The vast majority of the people who will consider these 
various political parties are unemployed and barely surviving; 
the majority are exploited day laborers or street vendors, and 
all of them are not just kept on the sidelines of human 
existence, but are actually excluded from it. 
  For the first time in Nicaragua's history, a party emerged 
whose fundamental objective was to make a radical change in that 
situation with the appearance of the Front. In the 1969 
Proclamation of the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN), 
Carlos Fonseca wrote: "We intend to travel the difficult path of 
the combatants who have sacrificed their lives for the sake of 
freeing the oppressed and exploited, the abused and humiliated." 
  And in the oath that the militants took at the end of "Zero 
Hour" (late 1969), they pledged to struggle for "national honor 
and the redemption of the oppressed and exploited people of 
Nicaragua." 
  The subsequent history of the FSLN is drenched in the blood 
of thousands and thousands of Sandinists who gave their lives to 
honor this oath. Once we were in power, we made many different 
mistakes, but never at any time did we lose sight of our 
fundamental objective: the redemption of the oppressed. 
<H5>  Paradox in the Front </H5>
  I sincerely believe that the FSLN is the only political 
party 
with the desire and the capacity, once it is in power, to build 
a society that is increasingly free of exploitation and social 
injustice. 
  But there is a great paradox that is now becoming the 
principal challenge to the Front. On the one hand, we have the 
FSLN that is always committed in principle to the cause of the 
oppressed and exploited; however (and here lies the painful 
paradox), the majority of the oppressed and exploited do not 
support the FSLN. Seventy-seven percent of Nicaraguans do not 
now regard it as their party, according to the latest polls. 
What is happening to us? How can we understand and resolve this 
contradiction? 
  It is imperative that we resolve it, because the party must 
win the 1996 elections. As the opposition we cannot change the 
political, economic, and social structures to benefit the 
majorities who are excluded from all material prosperity. 
  To win the elections, it is of vital importance that, with 
our work, attitudes, behavior, and our entire way of life, we 
send a signal to those majorities. Platforms and political 
programs are not enough, though they are very important, and 
indeed necessary. 
<H5>  Sending Clear Signals </H5>
  To resolve the above-mentioned paradox and win over the 
masses in Nicaragua, we must send them signals on a variety of 
subjects. Today I will focus primarily on two of them. 
  a) With a renewed leadership, we must send clear signals of 
our sincere defense of popular causes; support for the masses' 
struggles; maintain a clear and constant opposition to the 
government' neoliberal economic measures; and lead our lives in 
a way that proves we are still loyal to our oaths and our 
historic commitment to the oppressed and exploited. 
  b) With a renewed leadership, we must send clear signals 
that 
we are still true to the ethical values that are part of the 
historic tradition of our best cadres: honor, solidarity, 
sincerity, respect for Sandinists who do not share our ideas, 
using reason rather than insults to seek consensus and unity, 
managing the party's assets in a respectful and open way, and 
leading an austere life that brings us closer to the suffering 
people who are dying of poverty. 
  And finally, I also believe that we must, with our attitudes 
and our entire way of life, send clear signals that we do not 
represent the threat that war and death, commercial blockades, 
barriers to internal trade, etc., will return to our soil. 
Because of our mistakes--and above all because of the 
adversary's propaganda--we have an image that must be erased 
from the minds of our people if we are to win the 1996 elections.

<F P=106> [Article by Renato Garcia] </F>
  [Text] On 30 March, Secret Service agents of the Military 
Police [PM] and attorneys found computer diskettes with a list 
of names of politicians, policemen, and media professionals next 
to the amounts of money they allegedly received from numbers 
game kingpins. The diskettes were found at the headquarters of 
numbers game kingpin Castor de Andrade, in a huge old house at 
1040 Fonseca Street in Bangu District. Vice Governor Nilo 
Batista opens the list of politicians who allegedly received 
financial help from the numbers game kingpins during the 1990 
electoral campaign. Also on the list are Jose Vicente, Bocaiuva 
Cunha (deceased), Jamil Haddad, Simao Sessim, Messias Moraes, 
Cidinha Campos, Marcio Braga, Sergio Cinelli, Leoncio 
Vasconcelos, Aguinaldo Timoteo, and Ludmila Mayrink, among 
others. According to files found in Castor de Andrade's 
computers, they all received financial help during the 1990 
campaign. 
  District Attorney Antonio Carlos Biscaia said: It is well 
known that the numbers game kingpins have blocs in the city 
council, in the legislative assembly, and at the Chamber of 
Deputies. 
  According to Biscaia, bribes from the numbers game kingpins 
do not follow any political ideology: Leftist, center, and 
rightist congressmen resorted to these irregular funds to 
finance their campaigns. Biscaia reported that the list 
contained the names of politicians from all parties except the 
Workers Party, PT. As the lists contained in the diskettes are 
made known, however, new names will be added to the current ones. 
  The files also show that these illegal funds were 
effectively 
used to pay for the maintenance of police cars, repair work at 
the police precincts, and payment for "bonuses" to policemen. 
According to the documents, police inspectors, PM colonels, and 
almost all leaders of the Civil Police have received these 
funds. The names of reporter Nelio Bilat and sports commentator 
Washington Rodrigues, in addition to the names of the Tupi and 
Manchete radio stations, are mentioned in the documents. They 
also reveal the amounts distributed among all the special police 
precincts, police barracks, and district police precincts. Also 
recorded on the documents are the payment of extra bonuses, 
donations to philanthropic institutions and to the Confraria do 
Garoto, as well as the overall amount collected in numbers game 
bets and expenses. 
  The dismantling of the illegal game network and the raiding 
of its headquarters became possible with the November arrest of 
Castor de Andrade's son-in-law, Fernando Ignacio de Miranda. 
Miranda was caught red-handed trying to bribe Police Inspector 
Mario Covas, director of the DGPI [expansion unknown]. In a 
parallel investigation, and based on charges made by X-9 
[expansion unknown], Ivan Custodio de Lima (main witness of the 
Vigario Geral massacre), the PM agents, and attorneys arrived at 
the bunker without knowing what to expect. To their surprise 
they found what they believe to be the much sought after 
evidence of the involvement of politicians, policemen, and 
journalists in the numbers racket.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique </F>
Cardoso by FOLHA's special correspondent Susi Aissa at his 
Corrego da Ponte ranch in Burity, Minas Gerais State, on 1 April] 
  [Text] [Aissa] Do you have a government plan? 
  [Cardoso] I will not think about that until late April. Our 
program is the economic plan that we will support to the end. 
  [Aissa] When will the people start to feel its effects? 
  [Cardoso] The economy will be stabilized by the second half 
of the year. I have no doubt about that. Things have already 
markedly changed. 
  [Aissa] Will you interfere with the implementation of the 
economic plan? 
  [Cardoso] I will not interfere, but I will support it 
publicly. This I will do. 
  [Aissa] Will you maintain contacts with the economic team? 
  [Cardoso] I will maintain frequent contact with the new 
minister, at his request. 
  [Aissa] Some people contend that this is rather unethical, 
since you are a presidential candidate. 
  [Cardoso] That is an insincere remark. Everyone knows it is 
my plan, that I made it. I will continue to comment on it. 
Yet, I no longer assume responsibility for any actions taken in 
this respect. I will, however, assume responsibility for 
supporting it. 
  [Aissa] Will you seek alliances with the PFL [Liberal Front 
Party] and the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]? 
  [Cardoso] The PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] is 
taking care of that. Why would one seek alliances? To win. In 
our electoral system, which envisages a run-off election, 
everyone seeks alliances. It will not be the party leaderships 
that will decide this, but individual voters who move from one 
candidate to another. One party only needs to hold negotiations 
with another that is different from it. If both parties are 
equal, there is no need for negotiations. For instance, the PT 
[Workers Party] is seeking an alliance with the PC do B 
[Communist Party of Brazil], a truly obsolete party that still 
advocates a dictatorship. Why is the PT doing this? Because it 
needs votes. 
  [Aissa] Would you accept alliances with the PPR, or with the 
PFL? 
  [Cardoso] I would accept alliances with them, with the PDT 
[Democratic Labor Party], the PP [Popular Party], or the PT. I 
would accept an alliance with the PT. It could happen that 
neither I nor Lula [PT leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva] qualify 
for the run-off election. 
  [Aissa] Would PSDB voters agree to your sharing a platform 
with [Bahia Governor] Antonio Carlos Magalhaes? 
  [Cardoso] I have already shared a platform with Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes, and with Tancredo Neves, Lula, and many 
others. To focus on that is to overlook the real issues. What 
are the real issues? One's government program, who the 
trustworthy people are, and with whom one is going to rule. I 
would be very happy if the PT decides to enter into an alliance 
to support me. I have my background, my history. No one could 
say I am a rightist because I am not. 
  [Aissa] Who will finance your campaign? 
  [Cardoso] I still do not know. The subject is still being 
discussed. 
  [Aissa] Would you accept a contribution from Odebrecht 
[construction company]? 
  [Cardoso] Yes. As long as everything is done properly.

  [Excerpt] Santiago, 4 Apr (EFE) -- Chilean businessman 
Carlos Cardoen, who made a fortune in arms sales to Iraq and is 
now facing possible extradition to U.S. justice, will not 
voluntarily go to that country, his lawyer Nurieldin Hermosilla 
said. 
  Hermosilla's comments were published by LA SEGUNDA today. 
Hermosilla explained that Cardoen will not appear before a Miami 
court "because in the United States there is no certainty as to 
when he would be tried. He could be in prison for years before 
the trial." 
  The lawyer said: "Cardoen did not commit any crime. That is 
known in detail by the prosecutors. They met with us in 
Jamaica, last year in April, and we held a long conversation." 
  Hermosilla recalled that his son, Juan Pablo Hermosilla, who 
is also a lawyer, is in the United States talking with Eduardo 
Palmer, one of the prosecutors in charge of this case, to gain 
some "advantage" for Cardoen, but he reiterated: "They know 
this is a lost case." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Quito, 4 Apr (EFE) -- It was reported here today 
that the Ecuadoran Government has implemented measures to ensure 
and encourage a free market system and to increase production in 
the country's different industrial sectors. According to the new 
rules, investments in Ecuador's private sector will not require 
a patent, license, registration, permit, or certificate. 
Meanwhile, numerous decrees, laws, and administrative rules 
that had placed restrictions or limitations on industry and free 
trade were repealed. 
  The price of all local or imported goods, products, and 
services will be subject only to the free market laws without 
state controls, which means their prices will be established by 
the law of supply and demand, based on their quality and price. 
The new rules state that all products, goods, and livestock will 
be allowed free movement, transportation, and transit across the 
country without having to obtain a license or administrative 
authorization. Also, from now on, all Ecuadoran goods and 
products are exportable, with a few exceptions subject to 
quotas, restrictions, or limitations foreseen in the Law for 
Expediting Exports and Over Water Routes.

  [Text] Lima, 3 Apr (EFE) -- The Lima daily EXPRESO stated 
today that the U.S. State Department's support of a 
controversial report on the status of justice in Peru is 
political aggression by the latter country. The daily, which is 
believed to be pro-government, stated that "aside from the good 
or bad intentions" the U.S. Government may have, it has "clearly 
politically damaged" Peru by supporting the report, which 
harshly criticizes Peruvian justice. 
  The report, prepared by a group of legal experts presided 
over by Robert Goldman from the United States, states that the 
judicial reform the Peruvian Government has launched "severely 
undermined and, in some cases, eliminated judicial independence 
in Peru." The report also "suggested" that the Peruvian 
Government should annul the law that allows judges who try 
alleged terrorists to remain anonymous and substantially amend 
antiterrorist laws. 
  EXPRESO stated this evaluation of the situation "is 
unrealistic" because Peru is implementing an "in-depth reform of 
the judiciary that ranges from the appointment of honorable and 
knowledgeable justices by the Discipline Board for Magistrates, 
which has general approval, to the establishment of a managerial 
and modern approach to the institution and enactment of modern 
codes of procedure."

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 3 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Cesar 
Gaviria, recently elected OAS secretary general, has said he 
advocates a dialogue with the Cuban Government, but he rejected 
the possibility that Cuba could rejoin this hemispheric 
organization. 
  He added that the OAS "has always thought" that the 
reintegration of Cuba to the organization "is desirable." 
  "However, most countries believe that given the current 
circumstances, it is impossible," he pointed out. 
  In an interview published today by EL ESPECTADOR newspaper, 
the Colombian president said, "it is not up to me to determine 
the scope of the changes," but "I hope that within a few years, 
this change will be possible." 
  Gaviria recalled that the so-called Group of Three -- 
Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela -- has always favored holding 
talks with Cuba to seek ways to implement reforms in Cuba. 
However, Gaviria underscored, "there are countries that are 
very skeptical about conducting such talks; nevertheless, we 
have always advocated them."

<F P=106> [Interview with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria by Maria </F>
Teresa Ronderos and Francisco Celis; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The president was beaming. "It is not a matter of 
good luck," he laughed. "When things are done right, they come 
out right." Gaviria believes that Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin 
and the rest of the team that consolidated his election as the 
new OAS secretary general did things very well. Gaviria 
announced that he will not get involved in national politics in 
the next few years and added: "More than one person will be 
happy about that." 
  He appears confused when told what many people in the 
streets 
are saying, that he was put in the position by the United 
States. But he defends himself without hesitation and says 
firmly that he would not have been elected if the international 
community had not viewed Colombia as a very independent country. 
This is what he plans to do from his post at the OAS. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Why did you want to head the OAS, an institution 
in crisis? 
  [Gaviria] Late last year, some presidents and foreign 
ministers suggested that I should submit my name for the 
position. It looked like an interesting challenge. Although 
Joao Baena did a good job at the OAS and the organization has 
modernized itself in the past few years, nearly all 
international organizations lag behind in terms of the 
tremendous changes that have taken place and the speed with 
which the agenda has shifted. For those reasons, I thought I 
could do something worthwhile after I complete my term. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Aren't you interested in resting? Isn't this 
decision like getting off one bucking bronco to get on another? 
  [Gaviria] Yes. I would say it is a coincidence -- not a very 
happy one -- that I will have to leave one position and assume 
another without respite. But the situation was not under my 
control. I have not set the date, but I will have to assume 
office as OAS secretary general a few weeks after the end of my 
administration, maybe early in September. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What will have to change to make the OAS a true 
instrument of integration and to overcome the rhetoric that has 
gone on for the last 30 years? 
  [Gaviria] First, I perceive a great desire on the continent 
for the OAS to play a more important role in economic issues and 
in the integration processes of various countries. There is an 
American ideal to create a great free trade zone. I hope to 
make some progress along those lines in the next few years. 
Second, there is a general idea that the OAS must be more 
prepared and equipped to cope with the problems of democracy on 
the continent, problems such as ruptures and difficulties. It 
must also encourage democracy. Third, we are convinced that much 
more has to be done regarding human rights, not only studying 
specific cases but stimulating compliance with these rights. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Do these things depend on your leadership or on 
a 
change in the institution? 
  [Gaviria] I do not think it depends on my leadership. It 
truly depends on our capacity for political willingness and our 
ability to express it through institutional change, something 
that was not always possible in the world. Sometimes the 
willingness is there but no way is found to make changes or to 
use the means at our disposal, or maybe the adequate instruments 
are not found. I hope we will succeed. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Which case requires the most urgent attention: 
Cuba, Haiti, or Peru? Which is the most difficult? 
  [Gaviria] I think the Peruvian problem is a thing of the 
past following the Democratic Constituent Congress. I do not 
think Peru is a case at all anymore, nor do I think Cuba is on 
the organization's immediate agenda. Haiti, however, is on that 
agenda. Other than stating -- as I have several times before -- 
that we must continue to work to reestablish democracy in Haiti 
and to reinstall President Aristide, I have nothing new to add, 
except that I will have to study the situation carefully when I 
take office. There are still a few months to go yet, and I have 
no way of foreseeing what additional proposals or solutions 
could be adopted. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Among the most recent Colombian presidents, you 
have been one of the most open toward Cuba. You built bridges 
for them; you reestablished diplomatic relations; you met Fidel 
Castro; and now there is talk of selling oil to Cuba. Does this 
mean it will be easier for you to bring Cuba back into the 
Inter-American system? 
  [Gaviria] Nations all across the continent believe that if 
there is political and economic change in Cuba, approved, of 
course, by the organization, we could try to move Cuba back into 
the inter-American system. There is no way to assess the degree 
of such changes or the country's willingness to make them 
happen. If changes are made, it would be desirable to bring 
Cuba back into the system. 
  [EL TIEMPO] How will you maintain and guarantee your 
neutrality in conflicts involving Colombia? 
  [Gaviria] As soon as I take my oath, I will be the secretary 
general of the OAS. My opinion as the president of Colombia 
should have no bearing on my performance as secretary general. 
I will become the interpreter of the organization's mandates. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Trade, poverty, the environment, and drug 
trafficking are some issues on the continent's agenda. What are 
the priorities? 
  [Gaviria] I think the priorities are trade, the defense and 
conservation of democracy, human rights, the environment, and 
poverty. In the next few years we will have to work hard and 
see what happens. We need institutional reforms and new 
instruments. We must study everything carefully and see how to 
handle each specific situation. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Rumor has it that you were put in this position 
by the gringos. Niehaus said that after losing. How will you 
demonstrate your independence? 
  [Gaviria] I have no reason to demonstrate my independence. 
Colombia's foreign policy over the last few years should remove 
any doubt about the Colombian president's independence. 
Contrary to what one may expect to result from that policy, 
many countries backed Colombia because of its international 
policies and its independence. Colombia's success is due to the 
great work by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin and the ministry 
itself in spreading our message. It was not Colombia's message 
but the message of the nations that accompanied Colombia. My 
candidacy was successful because of the way Colombia presented 
its arguments and convinced 20 countries to support it. The 
United States publicly expressed its support for Colombia early 
in the race and gave us its vote. I don't think it did anything 
more than that. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Will you remain on the sidelines of national 
politics over the next five years? 
  [Gaviria] Without any doubt whatsoever. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Is there anyone who is particularly happy 
because 
of this decision? 
  [Gaviria] More than one person will be happy about that. Of 
course, I am going to be on the sidelines of Colombian politics. 
There is no possibility whatsoever that I will be able to 
participate at any level. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Mr. President, with respect to the issue of drug 
trafficking, it is being said that Colombia has no autonomy and 
that is agrees with what the United States believes must be done 
with the drug cartels. 
  [Gaviria] I strongly disagree with that assessment. 
Colombia's policy on drug trafficking has been independent and 
in agreement with our convictions and the country's fundamental 
interests, and we have been able register a high degree of 
international cooperation. Keep in mind that during the past few 
years we outlined a uniquely Colombian policy. Colombia 
eliminated extradition, we undertook the surrender program, and 
we decided to strengthen the justice system. In the beginning, 
the international community viewed these policies with 
skepticism, and yet, these policies proved to be successful and 
effective. I would like to know where you got the idea that 
these policies were imposed by the Americans. None of these 
policies... 
  [EL TIEMPO] I was referring to recent statements and 
positions regarding the Cali Cartel, and comparing them with 
what the United States believes must be done. 
  [Gaviria] Statements from whom? 
  [EL TIEMPO] For example, the U.S. drug czar and the attorney 
general. 
  [Gaviria] We must understand that judicial cooperation is a 
very difficult process and that the two countries' judicial 
systems are different. We got into instituting some programs, 
and also into a somewhat disturbing public discussion in an 
effort to determine whether we could cooperate. It is logical 
that differences should arise. The U.S. Justice Department has 
significant differences with the Prosecutor General's Office. 
In the past, the executive branch also had differences of 
opinion, but I believe we are overcoming these now. 
Nevertheless, we cannot be surprised by this. The president is 
usually very careful when he issues an opinion with regard to 
U.S. drug trafficking policies. However, the Prosecutor 
General's Office does not always react in the same manner. If 
this happens here, then we must expect to receive criticism from 
over there. 
  [EL TIEMPO] In light of your experience in dealing with drug 
trafficking, what do you think the struggle against this problem 
will be like within the OAS? 
  [Gaviria] I believe that for now the OAS has a very narrow 
program which basically focuses on prevention and crop 
substitution. I also believe that no one has proposed going any 
further; at least, I do not see any worthwhile proposals being 
evaluated at this time. 
  [EL TIEMPO] How will Colombia benefit from your being in the 
OAS? 
  [Gaviria] I believe my election already represents something 
positive, because it represents a recognition of the country's 
international policies. I also believe it is going to be 
positive in the future. If Latin America progresses, the 
integration process develops, and cooperation increases, then 
Colombia will benefit just as all the other countries will 
benefit. 
  [EL TIEMPO] It has been said that you were born under a very 
auspicious star, and, under such a star, we are going to end up 
as world soccer champions. What do you think about the team? 
  [Gaviria] I do indeed believe I am often considered a very 
lucky person. Of course, that is a somewhat fatalistic 
explanation. No, it is not a matter of good luck. When things 
are done right, they come out right. Obviously, those things 
that started out on the wrong foot turned out badly. Public 
opinion and the media pointed out these mistakes. I believe it 
is time the country learns that things can go right and that it 
is not simply a matter of good luck. No. I believe we 
Colombians are doing things right in areas such as the economy, 
politics, institutional change, the struggle against drug 
trafficking, and sports. In fact, things cannot go wrong all of 
the time.

  [Excerpts] San Salvador de Jujuy, 4 April (NA) -- The 
demonstration by Jujuy's Public Workers Union Front (FGE) 
[Frente de Gremios Estatales] that was convened for today to 
protest the veto by the executive branch of a salary increase 
approved by Congress left 12 people injured, six of them 
policemen. The police arrested six individuals. 
  The public workers protest ended, just as did last week's 
demonstrations, in serious clashes that included attacks with 
rocks, the throwing of tear gas, and rubber bullets. 
  The incidents were not circumscribed to Plaza Belgrano, 
located in front of the legislature, and where the marchers 
concentrated, but extended to other neighborhoods and to the bus 
terminal. Here there was another clash between police and 
workers, who burned and destroyed a police station. 
  In the morning Governor Carlos Ficoseco released a decree 
vetoing the salary increase approved by Congress. This was the 
cause of the protest. The governor presented an alternative 
bill granting salary increases to public workers. [passage 
omitted] 
  Jujuy police were reinforced with National Border Police and 
Salta Police agents to prevent possible incidents such as the 
one that occurred on 29 March. 
  Governor Carlos Ficoseco began his speech at the legislature 
shortly before 1830, while outside the number of protesters 
convened by the FGE increased. 
  Ficoseco's speech was scheduled to start at 1700 but started 
one and a half hours later. Meanwhile, police and public 
workers clashed outside. 
  A group of demonstrators tried to enter the Congress 
building, which had strong police protection, but were repelled 
by police with tear gas and rubber bullets and forced to 
withdraw by some 200 meters. 
  The anger of the demonstrators, and the unrelenting police 
persecution, forced workers to seek refuge at the local bus 
terminal, where they burned and completely destroyed the police 
station located in that area. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The current Bolivian Administration blames the 
previous administration for the negative report issued by the 
U.S. Government on the results of drug enforcement efforts in 
Bolivia. Our reporter Mario Espinoza has some information: 
  [Begin recording] [Espinoza] The executive branch believes 
the negative U.S. Government report on drug enforcement in 
Bolivia focuses on the first part of 1993. Social 
Communications Minister Ernesto Machicado has said the report 
contains positive aspects. He added that, during its 1993 
electoral campaign, Bolivia indisputably failed to fulfill its 
commitments to the U.S. Government. 
  [Machicado] I would like to underscore three aspects. First, 
the United States will continue to cooperate with Bolivia -- be 
it in drug enforcement or in any other area where cooperation 
exists. Everything will remain the same, there will be no change. 
  Second, the U.S. Embassy in Bolivia states that coca 
eradication was delayed entirely due to the administration of 
former President Jaime Paz Zamora, especially during the 
electoral campaign. Before the 1993 elections, the former 
Patriotic Accord administration decided to stop coca eradication 
efforts in the Chapare region basically for political and 
electoral reasons. 
  The third aspect is that the U.S. report clearly 
acknowledges 
the efforts of the current administration which has led to the 
arrest of several drug bosses and the breaking up of large drug 
rings. [end recording]

  [Text] Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada on 3 
April went to Sipesipe, a provincial village, where he attended 
Easter Mass. The president was very happy and in good spirits. 
Speaking to the local press, the president said that this will 
be a key month because the Popular Participation Bill, the 
educational reform bill, and the national budget will be 
approved here. He announced that workers will not receive any 
more salary increases. The president encouraged leaders of 
civic committees and municipal authorities to resort to dialogue. 
  [Begin recording] [Lozada] We hope that civic committee 
leaders will participate in a dialogue with the government 
because this month we have to approve the Popular Participation 
Bill and the national budget to allow the economy to operate 
according to [words indistinct] so that municipalities can start 
getting funds as of May and improve the standards of living of 
the people in their counties. The Popular Participation Bill is 
intended to benefit all the provinces of Bolivia. [passage

  [Text] The Chinese telephone network grew by 51 percent in 
1993 with the installation of 5.83 million phones, a little less 
than the total number of lines Brazil had in 1992. This is the 
largest, most booming market in the world in this field. In 
face of this market force, the Chinese Communications Ministry 
has sent a strong message regarding deregulation policy to the 
representatives of the International Telecommunications Union 
which is sponsoring its first meeting aimed at developing 
countries. 
  Zhu Gaofeng, Chinese vice minister of Posts and 
Telecommunications, will visit Brasilia on 4 April. He said: 
"It is not possible to follow only one development model in the 
field of telecommunications; there is not one model that can be 
adapted for all countries. Developing countries have become the 
greatest market in this field, which is why international 
financial institutions cannot establish short-term conditions. 
Partnerships with countries that need a lot of investment must 
follow a model of equal and mutual benefit." 
  He is negotiating with the Brazilian Government the first 
stage toward a possible "joint venture" [preceding two words in 
English] in the field of telecommunications and postal services. 
Based on a scientific and technological cooperation agreement 
signed between the two governments in Beijing in 1993, the 
partnership foresees the integration of private companies like 
Promon Telecommunications, Darum, and Ericsson. 
  These cooperation agreements will benefit: 
  The postal system: through development of a new postal 
policy, organization of the postal network, administration of 
services, marketing, courier, payment orders, and manufacture of 
new equipment. 
  The telecommunications system: through a new policy for 
voice 
and data transmission services, rural communication using 
satellites, point-to-point and mobile systems; through fiber 
optics; through administration and planning of telephone 
networks and value-added services. 
  The agreement also contemplates the joint development of 
telecommunications equipment.

<F P=106> [Report by Claudio Pereda Madrid] </F>
  [Text] The National Renewal [RN] party will be submitting 
to the Chamber of Deputies a draft bill that strives to avoid 
corruption at the civil servant level. This draft bill includes 
legal measures not in current Chilean law, such as influence 
peddling. 
  The draft bill, which will be submitted in the next few 
days, 
also adds regulations to the law on bribery, expands measures 
regarding conflicts of interest, and adds measures on illegal 
exactions. 
  The measures proposed by RN, which were disclosed by RN 
President Andres Allamand during a news conference, intend to 
punish officials or civil servants who seek to obtain profit for 
themselves or third parties through the illegal use of secrets 
or privileged information through influence peddling. According 
to Andres Allamand, influence peddling is the most common form 
of corruption at the civil servant level but it goes unpunished 
in Chilean law: 
  [Begin Allamand recording] It must be noted that in the last 
20 to 25 years, the majority of countries have held in-depth 
discussions to penalize influence peddling, which, I repeat, is 
not punished in Chile. [end recording] 
  The draft bill also intends to punish bribery, not only when 
the action takes place, but also when it is offered. The law 
currently establishes that bribery is a crime only when the 
illegal payment is made. 
  The draft bill also expands the list of people with whom 
government workers cannot negotiate, among whom are their 
business partners and direct relatives, such as spouses and 
direct ancestors or descendants. It also punishes public 
officials who are entitled to make any payments and who request 
a sum higher than what is established. The law currently 
punishes those who demand an additional payment but not when it 
is requested. 
  [Begin Allamand recording] Consequently, we are building 
[words indistinct] introducing in Chile the legal measure of 
influence peddling, which currently is not included in Chilean 
law. We are perfecting the law on bribery by establishing the 
punishment I mentioned before: when the public official either 
requests it or it is offered. 
  We also are expanding conflicts of interest and, last, we 
are 
perfecting the measures regarding illegal exactions. [end 
recording] 
  Finally, Andres Allamand explained that the draft bill is 
completed by measures expediting the defense of public officials 
unjustly charged with the crimes included in the draft bill.

<F P=106> [Report by Mario Contreras] </F>
  [Text] For centuries there have been discussions over which 
is a better learning method: Is it that which goes from the 
general to the specific, that is, the deductive method; or that 
which goes from the specific to the general, the inductive 
method? 
  A few days ago a specific issue led to the discussion of a 
very important subject for Chile: the definition of a national 
defense policy. 
  During the academic meeting held last week at the University 
of Chile Political Sciences Institute to discuss the possible 
purchase of Mirage combat planes from Belgium, one of the 
participants stated -- and the other agreed -- that Chile lacks 
a defined national defense policy. He added that national 
objectives have not been established and that this is essential 
for a united community of interests that intends to stay united 
in the future. 
  A nation state is organized on the basis of a human group 
with homogeneous characteristics, having similar principles, 
values, and believes that will be projected into the future. 
Otherwise, there is no sense in having a true contract between 
the state and citizens with reciprocal duties and rights. 
Moreover, a political community is established to achieve these 
goals and to project them into the future. 
  One of the relevant issues on this subject is the 
establishment of a national defense policy. It can be said that 
the prevailing situation during the current times, the so-called 
age of post-modernism, is different and that the possibilities 
for armed conflicts have diminished. This may be so. In 
addition, it also can be alleged that the world powers are 
downsizing their armed forces. This is also true. Nevertheless, 
everyone is aware that international ties are measured by 
influence of power and in no other way. Moreover, only a few 
developed countries have implemented a downsizing of their armed 
forces. 
  Chile, which holds a privileged position in Latin American 
because of its economic process, has emerged with a flourishing 
economy and a stable political system. In general, this 
situation is usually accompanied by a well-structured dissuasive 
policy. To do this, it is necessary to start at the basic 
level, that is, to establish national objectives and on this 
basis design an overall national defense policy. 
  This issue, which was raised again last week at the 
University of Chile Political Sciences Institute, is a cause of 
concern for current defense officials.

  [Text] The case of the three slain Communist leaders is 
reviewed in this Sunday's newspapers. Judge Canovas acted on 
firm evidence; he lived up to his reputation as a severe rural 
judge. He lived as one who has witnessed a horrendous nightmare, 
until he was defeated by a terrible death. 
  Nevertheless, Special Judge Milton Juica continued the task 
started by Canovas through confessions which went beyond the 
somber forebodings of the late solitary judge. 
  This is what Ascanio Cavallo writes in an article [in LA 
EPOCA] entitled: "The Doors of Hell": 
  Few people remember it now, but Carabineros General Rodolfo 
Stange tendered his resignation as Carabineros commander once 
before. It was on the afternoon of 1 April 1985, almost nine 
years ago, when it was reported that Judge Canovas Robles had 
just set bail for two Carabineros and indicted 14 others for 
their involvement, less than five months previously, in the 
abduction and killing of Communist Party leaders Manuel 
Guerrero, Santiago Natino, and Jose Manuel Parada. 
  After reviewing aspects of this case, and the many 
harassments of which [former Carabineros Commander] General 
Cesar Mendoza was not unaware, Ascanio Cavallo states: 
  Since then, Stange has done his best to improve the image of 
the Carabineros. He dissolved the Diconcar [expansion unknown], 
and little by little expelled Carabineros personnel who were 
involved in the DINA [National Intelligence Directorate], the 
CNI [National Intelligence Center], or in other similar 
organizations or had carried out similar duties. He cleaned up 
the generals corps, expedited the promotion process, and 
established an open-door policy to the public. 
  Stange ordered the Carabineros to maintain a prudent 
low-profile during the plebiscite. He showed a previously 
unsuspected ability for political maneuvering during the 
transition by accepting the court appointment proposed by 
Patricio Aylwin's Administration without yielding almost 
anything. 
  The case of the three Communist leaders was, however, 
hopeless. On 31 March, in his much-awaited first ruling, Special 
Judge Juica recommended that the military court indict Stange 
for serious nonfulfillment of military duties. This goes beyond 
the judicial measures that occurred as a result of Mendoza fall 
in 1985. Juica's ruling presupposes that the high command did 
not conduct the proper investigation and obstructed justice. 
  Ascanio Cavallo's article in LA EPOCA adds: At least the 
attitude of the Carabineros has changed throughout the process. 
  Canovas lived under surveillance and his credibility was 
subjected to continuous challenge while conducting the 
investigation. Many high-ranking officers systematically 
refused to accept that some of their men may have been involved 
in the homicide case, but tolerated the repeated lies from those 
responsible. 
  Only in 1992, when Juica's investigation had yielded the 
first irrefutable evidence, did one high-ranking officer, 
General Mario Morales, publicly express his shame. The 
admonitions to which he was subjected and the isolation he was 
forced to endure, compelled him to resign by the end of 1993. 
  Continuing its analysis on this case, the "Doors of Hells" 
adds: Subjected to these complex pressures, it has become 
difficult for Stange to exercise his command. Subtlety is not 
required to understand that the government wants Stange to 
resign. During a meeting that lasted more than two hours at 
President Frei's office on the afternoon of 31 March, the 
political team gave the Carabineros the long Easter weekend to 
decide. But the phrase urging Gen. Stange to conscientiously 
analyze the situation -- which was included in the communique 
that ensued from this meeting -- leaves virtually no room for 
doubt. It would be very difficult to find a case where the 
executive branch has appealed to the conscience of someone and 
have him remain in his post. 
  The defense used by the Carabineros high command on 1 April 
is more aimed at the groups that requested Stange's resignation 
than at the government's statement. 
  Nevertheless, the statement issued by the Carabineros high 
command could not have appeased the executive branch. The 
circumstances under which it was read -- with all the 
Carabineros generals standing behind Carabineros Deputy 
Commander Fernando Cordero who read the statement -- insinuated 
that the Carabineros would react as an institution, as they did 
in 1985 when the high command made it perfectly clear it could 
only be led by one of its own. 
  Therefore, the past few hours have served to establish if 
this statement has the approval of Gen. Stange, or if it is a 
noble but unrealistic gesture of solidarity. 
  The article ends by noting: The Carabineros high command 
believes charges of the involvement of its commander are partial 
and biased, but one cannot overlook the fact that the main 
conclusion of these charges is based on an independent 
investigation conducted over nine years by two special judges. 
  Who is going to confirm if these are biased and partial 
opinions? The military courts, for example, may decide there is 
no merit in holding a trial after such a long period or in 
holding a trial in which the Carabineros may be interested 
parties. 
  Whether or not Stange remains in his post is not a judicial 
question; it is strictly a political case. It has nothing to do 
with his work in modernizing Carabineros. Stange has the last 
word and, until he utters it, it is easy to predict the 
prevailing atmosphere: Tense, very tense.

  [Text] The Prosecutor General's Office is concerned. The 
United States is definitely not sending evidence on drug 
traffickers to Colombian authorities. Although there was no 
official announcement, the truth is that, in practice, the 
sanction is being applied. The Prosecutor General's Office has 
not received a single piece of evidence against Colombian drug 
traffickers from the United States for the past two months. The 
last evidence received was against Julio Fabio Dinol and Miguel 
Rodriguez Orejuela for drug trafficking. 
  According to Francisco Jose Cintura, the acting prosecutor, 
the refusal to send information on drug traffickers is worrisome 
because the evidence sent by the United States has been 
overwhelming and has served to convict 17 individuals. 
  [Begin Cintura recording] The cooperation of the U.S. 
Justice 
Department has been important in consolidating several cases, 
including those of the Ochoa brothers, Gonzalo Mejia Sanin, and 
17 individuals whose extradition was pending when the National 
Constitutional Assembly banned extraditions. The U.S. Government 
should carefully examine the decision because such a negative 
decision can only benefit drug traffickers. [end recording] 
  Particularly in the cases against the Ochoa brothers, the 
United States sent accusations of cocaine trafficking and the 
testimony of U.S. drug traffickers who incriminated them. In 
addition, it sent recordings of telephone conversations 
intercepted by the DEA as evidence against certain Cali Cartel 
members. 
  Although there is concern over the announcement by DEA 
Investigations Director Robert Nieves to suspend the exchange of 
evidence to Colombia, the Prosecutor General's Office not only 
cooperates with the United States but also exchanges evidence 
with Russia, Italy, Mexico, and Peru.

  [Text] The Motilones Indians are among the tribes that 
struggle the hardest to save their identity. The guerrilla 
movements have now surfaced as a formidable enemy. They say 
they are willing to fight the subversives. It took one whole 
day, traveling along dirt roads, canoeing along the Catatumbo 
river, and cutting through the jungle to get to the villages of 
the Caricacha Buquira tribe of the Motilones Bari Indians. 
Almost 300 Indians, whose ancestors go back some 500 years, 
base their economy on fishing, coffee, cocoa, yucca, and wild 
fruits. 
  "TV Today" came here after hearing about reports made by 16 
Indian communities. The Motilones are angry with the guerrillas 
and the white settlers, who have moved onto their historically 
defined reservations. 
  [Begin unidentified Indian chief recording, in dialect 
fading 
to Spanish translation] The settlers have been growing coca. 
The processing waste flows into the river. The guerrillas have 
contaminated the river with oil, and there have been no fish in 
the river for the last few years. Fish are the basis of our 
diet. [end recording] 
  The Indians filed a complaint against the Revolutionary 
Armed 
Forces of Colombia and the Army of National Liberation. 
Although there have been no clashes up to now, the Motilones 
Bari Indians threatened to burn the coca plantations they find 
on their lands. There are almost 4,000 Indians living all over 
the Catatumbo region who would enforce this request by the 
Motilones if the government representatives do not offer any 
solutions to the problem.

CSO 

  [Text] Fedesarrollo [Higher Education and Development 
Foundation] has recommended that the government immediately cut 
public spending, keep interest rates at least at their current 
level, and place effective controls on the entry of foreign 
currency. 
  These suggestions were made in an editorial of COYUNTURA 
ECONOMICA, which will be in circulation within the next few days. 
  According to Fedesarrollo's director, Eduardo Lora, only if 
those three steps are taken will the government and the Bank of 
the Republic's board of directors be able to control inflation 
and avoid revaluation. 
  According to Fedesarrollo's analysis, even though the 
Colombian economy is behaving very positively, it is essential 
to introduce corrections in order to slow down the accelerated 
growth of demand and the entry of foreign currency. 
  Domestic demand for goods and services is growing at 11 
percent, while it should not exceed 5 percent. That is, it 
should grow at the annual rate of the GDP [gross domestic 
product]. 
  The foundation called Minister of Finance Rudolf Hommes' 
idea 
for lowering domestic interest rates in order to reduce the 
differential with international rates unworkable. "If that is 
done, it will trigger an acceleration of domestic demand, making 
inflation even harder to control," said Lora. 
  About a year ago Fedesarrollo had proposed reducing domestic 
interest rates, but Lora said the circumstances at that time 
were different, for then there was no excessive demand or much 
business activity. 
  "A decline in interest rates would accelerate demand and 
generate higher inflation. Actually, to reduce the amount of 
foreign currency entering Colombia by equalizing domestic and 
foreign interest rates, we would need to lower domestic rates by 
about 10 points, and that would be catastrophic in terms of 
controlling inflation," said Lora. 
  He added: "If anything should be done to interest rates, 
they 
should be raised, or at least kept at their current levels, but 
not lowered." 
  Even though Fedesarrollo recognizes the success of the 
government's handling of the economy, he cited the need to 
introduce tax controls on foreign credit to deter money 
laundering and slow down the massive influx of foreign currency. 
  The foundation did not propose specific controls, but 
suggested introducing a 48 percent cash reserves requirement for 
all foreign credit, not just for loans made for an 18-month 
term, as in the current procedure. 
<H5>  Credit Soaring </H5>
  Fedesarrollo said private sector loans are now at levels of 
$200 million a month; until October 1993 the average was only 
$40 million a month. 
  Fedesarrollo also asked the government to make a new cut in 
public spending by at least the amount announced at the start of 
this year, equivalent to 360 billion pesos. 
  Fedesarrollo's director, Eduardo Lora, said that one cause 
of 
the inflation reported during February is that the government 
did not cut spending by the amount it had announced. 
  According to Fedesarrollo, the February acceleration of the 
cost of living was caused primarily by excess demand, not high 
food prices or educational costs. 
  "Putting price controls on foods is not a sound way to 
control inflation, for even though people may reduce their 
spending on food, it is quite certain that they will increase 
their purchases of other goods," said Lora.

  [Text] Lima, 3 Apr (EFE) -- Abimael Guzman, founder and 
leader of the Maoist gang Shining Path [SL], has gone on an 
indefinite hunger strike in his cell at the Callao Naval Base in 
Lima. Carlos Gamero Quispe, one of the lawyers who are defending 
Guzman, told the Lima newspaper LA NACION that Guzman is 
striking for medical care. In the statement published by LA 
NACION on 3 April, Gamero said: "My defendant is seriously ill, 
and the military have refused permission for two Red Cross 
International doctors to visit him in prison and treat him for 
the various diseases he has." 
  For 10 years now, Abimael Guzman has had psoriasis, a skin 
disease that causes patches of skin to be covered by white 
scales. Guzman's health has been deteriorating lately because of 
an inflammation of the throat that prevents him from swallowing 
prison food, Gamero explained. 
  Carlos Rolando and Delia Carrasco, Abimael Guzman's father- 
and mother-in-law who live in Sweden, hired Gamero. The lawyer 
explained that his defendant has decided to go on an indefinite 
hunger strike to protest the Supreme Court of Military Justice's 
decision to not allow two International Red Cross doctors to 
visit him in prison. 
  "Guzman's psoriasis has worsened lately because of the 
humidity the pervades the premises of the Callao Naval Base, 
which is located on the La Punta peninsula just off Lima. The 
inflammation of Guzman's throat is also due to this humidity," 
Gamero explained. He added: "He is also suffering from the 
confinement he has to endure. All this has made him lose weight, 
to the point that he now looks like a human scarecrow." 
  The Fifth Criminal Court has ruled against the writ of 
amparo 
or plea of "habeas corpus" that Guzman's lawyer filed, asking 
that Guzman be allowed to receive "private medical care." The 
lawyer said: "Since the rulings prevent my defendant from 
receiving medical treatment, he has decided to go on an 
indefinite hunger strike to the bitter end, and it is obvious 
that whatever the outcome, the government will be to blame." The 
lawyer explained that he will go to the Supreme Court to appeal 
the ruling that prevents Guzman from receiving medical care "so 
that the highest court can decide on this matter." 
  On 29 March, the 25th Criminal Court of Lima reported that 
Guzman was in good health, and that Red Cross International 
doctors visited him regularly in prison. According to current 
Peruvian criminal laws, people sentenced to life for high 
treason, as in Guzman's case, can be visited by their relatives 
only once a month. 
  Abimael Guzman was arrested on 12 September 1992 in a 
housing 
development in Santiago Surco, a Lima neighborhood. Other key 
Shining Path leaders were also arrested on that occasion. On 7 
October 1992, a Naval court judge sentenced Abimael Guzman to 
life imprisonment for high treason for the deaths of over 20,000 
people during 10 years of terrorist actions, and for destroying 
state property worth more than $28 billion. The Supreme Court of 
Military Justice upheld the life sentence on 15 October 1992.

  [Text] Lima, 4 Apr (EFE) -- Two years after the 5 April 
1992 coup of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, the economic 
isolation has been left behind and Peru has obtained $10.291 
billion in foreign investment. The total direct investment for 
production over the last two years has reached $1.619 billion, 
while commitments for the short and medium term, through 
contracts with 14 foreign companies, have reached $6.75 billion. 
  During the same period, another $1.922 billion entered the 
Peruvian stock exchange, especially the Lima stock market, with 
investments involving 1,312 foreigners (768 Chileans, 338 
Americans, and 84 British). Most of the investments were made 
through the sale of state companies and granting mining and oil 
concessions to companies from Argentina, the United States, 
Spain, Canada, China, Chile, South Africa, the United Kingdom, 
and others. 
  Those with the greatest impact were the sale of the National 
Telecommunications Enterprise of Peru and the Peruvian Telephone 
Company for $2.002 billion and the signing of a contract to put 
into operation the largest Peruvian natural gas deposit, 
Camisea, with the Anglo-Dutch Shell Company with an initial 
investment of $2 billion. According to experts, the great 
participation by investors is attributed to the incentives 
granted by Peruvian laws, which are considered by some people to 
be the most liberal in Latin America. 
  In the post-coup period, Peru was also able to return to the 
financial international community after reaching agreements with 
the IMF and the World Bank, although it has not yet been 
readmitted by the commercial banks. The IMF and the World Bank 
had virtually alienated Peru from their institutions since 1985 
when then Peruvian President Alan Garcia unilaterally restricted 
the payment of the foreign debt. Talks with the Bank Committee 
of creditors began last year, but are at a standstill due to a 
lawsuit by the U.S. Chemical Bank for a debt of $72 million, 
which will apparently be resolved soon. 
  Peru needs to reach an agreement with the private banks, to 
which it owes about $6 billion, so as to allow alternate 
financial sources that would give greater impulse to the plans 
for modernizing its economy. A choice proposed by Peru is to 
sign an agreement based on the Brady Plan, by which it would pay 
$1 billion in exchange for being forgiven 50 percent of the 
debt, about $3 billion. 
  The economic and financial stability obtained by Peru is 
also 
based on the harsh blows dealt to the terrorist groups, mainly 
the Shining Path, which in 1992 was about to destabilize the 
Peruvian Government. The downfall of this gang began in 
September 1992 with the capture of its chief, Abimael Guzman, 
and it fell even further when he asked for a peace agreement. 
The Shining Path, although divided and weakened, is, however, 
still active, and every so often tries, each time with less 
force, to spread terror in an effort to scare away investors. 
  In the political field, the Fujimori government has become 
internationally legitimate after holding three elections which 
were endorsed by observers of the OAS and other organizations. 
The unanimous international repudiation of the "Fujimori coup" 
has also been left behind, and now Peru is normalizing its 
relations with the rest of the world. 
  The internal political opposition, however, has not forgiven 
Fujimori for the coup. It still accuses him of being a 
"dictator," and is trying to form a single front headed by 
former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to prevent 
his possible reelection in 1995. The preelectoral polls indicate 
that Perez de Cuellar is the favorite candidate for winning the 
elections next year, but Perez has not yet decided to run. 
  Some analysts believe Perez de Cuellar can guarantee the 
continuity of the economic model, but others, like former 
Economy Minister Carlos Bolona, fear that Perez, with the 
support of the left and the right, will be pressured by those 
sectors, and that his eventual government will be "unviable."

  [Text] Montevideo, 4 Apr (AFP-NA) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina Martinez announced today that his country will 
implement an open market policy. He stated that in a move to 
overcome the economic crisis that is weighing heavily on the 
island, Fidel Castro's administration will not "impose 
limitations" on the entry of foreign capital. 
  During a news conference Robaina pointed out that "our visit 
to Uruguay, as the first leg of a tour of the region, seeks to 
explain to Latin American rulers the reality of the Cuban 
situation and to announce the opening of our market to foreign 
capital." 
  Robaina acknowledged that the economic and social 
deterioration confronting Cuba has obliged its rulers to seek a 
way out by "implementing an open market policy and accepting 
that foreign capital--regardless of its origin--can invest in 
our country free from any constraints." 
  The Cuban foreign minister, who arrived in Montevideo on 4 
April for a three-day official visit, was received by President 
Luis Alberto Lacalle at his private residence. They held a 
30-minute talk. 
  Robaina said: "We discussed several subjects of Latin 
American interest, laying special emphasis on the reality that 
we Cubans are living through at present and on the possibility 
of enhancing bilateral trade." 
  Trade between Uruguay and Cuba is paralyzed due to the fact 
that the Castro administration has a $30 million debt with 
Uruguay that has been outstanding for four years. Robaina 
offered to repay this debt by "sending medicines and medical 
equipment" to Uruguay. 
  The young foreign minister said that "the most promising 
sectors for those investors who are interested in coming to Cuba 
are tourism, biotechnology, and agriculture." 
  Following his meeting with Lacalle, Robaina had luncheon 
with 
Liber Seregni, the leader of the leftist coalition, the Broad 
Front, and then had a meeting with Cubans residing in Uruguay. 
  The Cuban foreign minister's agenda also includes a meeting 
with his Uruguayan counterpart Sergio Abreu on 5 April. On the 
last day of his visit Robaina will deliver a speech before 
representatives from the 11 countries that make up the Latin 
American Integration Association (ALADI), which is headquartered 
in Montevideo. 
  Cuban Embassy spokesmen have reported that Robaina's tour, 
which started in Uruguay, will also include visits to Peru, 
Argentina, and Paraguay.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcelo Izquierdo from Havana] </F>
  [Text] President Carlos Menem "several days ago" telephoned 
Fidel Castro. The conversation was unrestrained and served to 
resolve some pending problems that opened the doors for the 
visit Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina will make to Buenos 
Aires on 13 April. 
  "The telephone conversation took place," Robaina confirmed 
for PAGINA/12 in a brief chat on Juventud Island, located in 
western Cuba. 
  [Izquierdo] But who took the initiative? 
  [Robaina] Well, an incoming call was received some days ago. 
That means it came from over there, because that is the only way 
an incoming call can be received. 
  Robaina, 38, smiles about his remark while he is surrounded 
by some 50 foreign diplomats accredited to Havana during a visit 
to the archipelago's largest island. 
  "There was no need to use the language used in the past, 
because the topics that were discussed did not need the type of 
language that was used before the microphones," he said. 
Despite the official secrecy regarding the topic, it has been 
learned from diplomatic sources that the conversation lasted for 
some minutes. 
  The sources stated that Menem presumably showed interest in 
medical treatment for the son of his cousin, Alfredo Menem, who 
is currently recovering in Cuba from a physical illness, but 
this could not be confirmed. Castro was presumably willing; 
thus the dialogue was held on a cordial basis and helped reduce 
the tense relations, according to the sources. 
  In the same natural way that he dances a salsa at a 
diplomatic corps party, or when he makes a present of a 
caricature of an ambassador to the ambassador himself, Robaina 
agreed to chat with PAGINA/12. 
  [Izquierdo] Menem will receive you on the day of your 
arrival in Buenos Aires. How will you handle the interview with 
a president who openly declares himself to be "anti-Castro." 
  [Robaina] The exists a bilateral relationship that comes 
above any type of declaration. This is something my government 
has decided to work on, and I do not believe Argentina will be 
an exception. We are in a position to speak openly when a 
disagreement crops up. 
  [Izquierdo] Up to what point have bilateral relations been 
affected by Menem's continuous attacks against Fidel Castro? 
  [Robaina] Our relations are not difficult. The insistence 
(Menem's attacks) is something that only he can comment on. It 
also would be important if there could be time for us to explain 
what we are doing in Cuba. 
  [Izquierdo] The objective of your visit? 
  [Robaina] Argentina is not an exception among the other 
countries of the world. We seek to speak the truth about our 
program with its virtues and defects. 
  [Izquierdo] Is there any progress in the renegotiation of 
the 
more than $1 billion debt Cuba has with Argentina? 
  [Robaina] It was I who began the negotiations, and it will 
not be myself who will conclude them. We are taking steps to 
see how we can move that debt. We have no capital but there are 
other possibilities. 
  [Izquierdo] What possibilities? 
  [Robaina] We must see what interest there is in Cuban 
products, and we also must see whether some investments can be 
made in order to pay part of the debt. 
  The Cuban foreign minister will arrive in Buenos Aires from 
Peru on 13 April, and on the same day he will be received by 
Menem at Government House, according to Argentine Ambassador to 
Cuba Susana Grane. 
  "There is nothing to prevent an improvement in 
Argentine-Cuban relations. For this to happen, I have 
confidence in the rationality, intelligence, and good sense of 
the Argentines." Thus the Cuban foreign minister concluded his 
chat with PAGINA/12. 
  Robaina will remain in Argentina on 13 and 14 April, but he 
will return on 17 April for a short visit to Posadas, Misiones 
Province, after his semi-official visit to Paraguay.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 Apr (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
today denied that his chat with Cuban chief of state Fidel 
Castro was reconciliatory, and he indicated that he had called 
Castro to recommend a nephew who had traveled to Havana because 
of health problems. 
  The Argentine president indicated that when he called his 
Cuban colleague, "Castro was about to make a toast with some 
Menem wine" that he himself had sent Castro. 
  Menem also indicated that he had taken advantage of the 
contact "to again thank him for the attention he gave a dear 
friend, (Cesar) Chacho Jaroslavsky, and to recommend a nephew 
who also had traveled to Cuba due to health reasons." 
  In remarks to Radio 990, Menem emphasized: "This was all we 
chatted about," and he said: "Our disagreements within the 
sphere of democracy and freedom will again be made known during 
the Cartagena de Indias summit above and beyond these aspects."

  [Text] The Argentine Foreign Ministry yesterday said that 
it was not aware of the existence of a report written by a 
commission created by the Defense Ministry to investigate 
reports on war crimes in the Malvinas Islands. CLARIN's 
exclusive publication of the report appeared in yesterday's 
edition. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella revealed that the 
Foreign Ministry is not officially aware of the report mentioned 
by CLARIN, adding almost with resignation that "it would 
eventually become aware of it." 
  The publication of the Defense Ministry report is a hurdle 
in 
the path of the policy of seduction being implemented by the 
Foreign Ministry to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations 
with the United Kingdom. 
  In this particular case we must add the cyclical pushing and 
pulling between foreign and defense officials on issues like the 
Malvinas or the UN peace missions. 
  The report publishes, for the first time, the full names of 
Argentine soldiers who were wounded and are registered as 
executed. According to the investigation, at least nine 
Argentine soldiers in the Malvinas Islands died at the hands of 
British soldiers in a way that clearly violates Geneva 
Convention articles on treatment of war prisoners. 
  Petrella yesterday said that if the existence of the report 
is confirmed -- the Defense Ministry did not deny it -- it 
should be submitted to the British Government "as a matter of 
principle" in order to check whether "parts of it have not 
already been covered by the British investigators." 
  The deputy foreign minister was referring to a Scotland Yard 
investigation team that collected information from Mount Longdon 
battle survivors in London and Buenos Aires. It was reported 
that the British police had concluded that in the Malvinas 
Islands "there were assassinations, but not executions." 
  The investigation started following the publication in 1991 
of a book by former British Corporal Vincent Bramley entitled 
"Excursion to Hell." In the book Bramley described how the 
British military executed an Argentine soldier who had been 
taken prisoner following the bloody battle of Mount Longdon. 
  Bramley yesterday told Radio del Plata that "the only case 
of 
execution I know about is the one involving the soldier I 
mentioned in my book." Bramley expressed hopes that the two 
countries' governments "will sit down and work together in order 
to clarify this matter for good." 
  "The British Government ordered an investigation. The 
Foreign Ministry asked British investigators to visit Buenos 
Aires to collect the evidence available here. The team of 
investigators stayed in Buenos Aires for 20 days. They talked 
with veterans and then issued a report to the crown prosecutor, 
who must decide what to do with the report," the deputy foreign 
minister said. 
  The serious facts unveiled by the investigation presided 
over 
by military vicar Norberto Martina places the government in the 
predicament of having to decide whether to denounce the war 
crimes committed by British soldiers before international 
organizations. 
  Officials responsible for designing the government's foreign 
policy know well that if they go to a international court with 
documents proving that British soldiers were involved in 
attempted homicide, homicide, dangerous handling of prisoners, 
use of forbidden weapons, and execution of soldiers wounded 
during combat in the Malvinas Islands, they will have no choice 
but to throw away the policy of slow rapprochement with the 
United Kingdom that the Foreign Ministry has been implementing 
ever since Carlos Menem became president.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with President Carlos Menem by Andrew </F>
Graham-Yooll in Buenos Aires; date not given] 
  [Text] President Carlos Menem of Argentina is a gambling 
man. He enjoys the image, and he is unabashedly delighted when 
he wins. On Sunday he will be playing for his future. 
  A parliamentary election will decide his proposals for 
constitutional reform that would enable him to stand for 
re-election. 
  The man who has transformed Argentina from a country prone 
to 
military coups and inflation that reached 20,000 per cent into 
what investment fund managers call the boom region of the 1990s, 
is confident of victory. 
  "The people want stability, and I give them that," he said 
in 
an interview at the presidential palace, the Casa Rosada in 
Buenos Aires. 
  His government, which has brought inflation down to 10 per 
cent since he took office in July 1989, is renowned, however, 
for condoning widespread corruption, an accusation he brushes 
aside. 
  He has also given Argentina's stuffy officialdom a sense of 
humour. He has made Argentinians laugh at themselves by 
laughing at himself. "Sense of humour? Some of us have it. 
Churchill could laugh at himself," he says. 
  For laughs, he has played basketball with the Globe 
Trotters, 
football against Diego Maradona and tennis against Gabriela 
Sabatini. 
  At 64, his pursuit of youth, fitness and personal grooming 
are approached like a national emergency. His hairdresser and 
tennis coach have priority on all presidential travel. 
  He appears terrified of ageing, anxious to show that he is 
still young and able to govern. 
  "The man is without shame," a cabinet minister's wife 
remarked. She said Senor Menem was not troubled by mistakes and 
was not affected by adverse comment. 
  He loves good suits, fast cars and blondes, which he 
explains 
away as due to his Arab ancestry. He is first generation 
Argentinian. His father emigrated from Yabrud in Syria. 
  Asked about allegations that his infidelity drove his former 
wife, Zulema, out of the presidential home, and has been the 
subject of scandal, Senor Menem replied: "I am not a 
philanderer, I'm a seducer." 
  When he took office in 1989 he promised to end corruption, 
but the privatisation programme that has pumped money into the 
economy has also produced personal fortunes overnight, and with 
no questions asked. 
  He said: "There is a problem. But no worse than it ever was. 
You hear about some things now because there is absolute freedom 
of speech. Under previous regimes (the military) you were 
killed if you breathed a word." 
  The wave of corruption has touched the President. He has 
sacked relatives of his ex-wife from government jobs, when their 
get-rich-quick deals became scandalous. One relative organised 
an Argentine passport for Monzer al-Kassar, an arms dealer under 
arrest in Spain. 
  Amira Yoma, Senor Menem's sister-in-law, has been charged 
with laundering drug money. She was accused of organising her 
own sting against Colombian drug barons, and presidential aides 
had to dissuade a hit squad sent to kill her. 
  The election takes place as the fourth Argentine-British 
Conference, held every two years to build bilateral 
understanding, ends in the Andean province of Mendoza. 
  British politicians and businessmen, led by Viscount 
Montgomery, are in Argentina this week to discuss trade and 
build bridges broken by the Falklands conflict, which started 12 
years ago this month. 
  It was Senor Menem, in search of trade with Britain and 
Europe, who made the first move towards restoring diplomatic 
relations within weeks of entering office. 
  "I don't know why Britain wants those islands. Really, I ask 
you?" 
  His ambition, which he sees as natural after restoration of 
diplomatic relations, is to be officially invited to Britain. 
  "They don't want to invite me," he laughed, "which in the 
present circumstances between our two countries is not easy to 
understand. In fact, the two countries that haven't invited me 
are the UK and Syria." 
  Since Britain and Argentina renewed links under Senor Menem, 
bilateral trade has grown. 
  British Gas landed a share in a four-way contract with 
America to build a gas supply pipeline from Argentina to Chile. 
  Senor Menem was born in 1930 in La Rioja, one of Argentina's 
poorest provinces, and he joined the followers of the late Juan 
Peron in the mid-1950s, just after the general had been 
overthrown in a military coup. 
  But whereas Peron nationalised the mostly-British utilities 
in 1947, Senor Menem, within days of reaching office, announced 
mass privatisation. 
  He ordered the sale of all viable state enterprises and the 
closure of others, leaving himself open to charges that his 
policies were Thatcherite. 
  But he sees no conflict with his youthful Peronism. "There 
is no contradiction. General Peron would eventually have had 
the same policy. 
  "He had started calling for international investors into oil 
exploration when he was overthrown in 1955. They (the coup 
leaders) did not let him do what needed to be done." 
  He said he was confident that the public would continue to 
support his privatisation and stabilisation policies. 
  The election has to give him enough members in the chamber 
of deputies and the senate to be able to vote for a constituent 
assembly that will amend the constitution to allow Senor Menem 
to seek re-election in 1995. 
  Senor Menem also plans to abolish the condition that a 
president must be Catholic (Senor Menem was a Muslim but 
converted). 
  He is said to have told his aides, when he was running for 
his first six-year term: "I'm not coming in for six years and 
then going home. I am going to stay." 
  Then he softened the statement, saying: "We Arabs live a 
hundred years." Now he is in a hurry to secure a second term, 
as he feels time is running out. 
  In spite of his confidence, he is afraid of the ravages of 
time. 
  According to Gabriela Cerruti, the author of El 
Jefe (The Chief), he has succeeded against most challenges. 
  "For 20 years he invented the date of his birth to claim a 
youth that was unavoidably deserting him." she said. "He is 
horrified by the fact that his power cannot stop the clock."

<F P=106> [Article by Jorge Figueroa] </F>
  [Text] Montevideo, 2 Apr (EFE) -- The visit by Cuban 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to Montevideo on 4 April has 
divided the Broad Front leftist coalition--the country's 
third-largest political force--and is threatening to cause an 
internal crisis just eight months before the general elections. 
  Diplomatic spokespersons have said that Robaina begins his 
tour in Montevideo that will include Argentina, Paraguay, and 
Peru "seeking to re-insert Cuba into the Latin American 
framework." 
  Francisco Rodriguez Camusso is a veteran Uruguayan 
legislator 
with several decades in Congress who in 1989 was elected deputy 
to represent a group that includes, among others, the 
communists. He said he will not participate in the session of 
the International Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies 
which will receive Robaina on 4 April. 
  The committee comprises seven members; Rodriguez Camusso is 
the only representative of the Broad Front Coalition. He said: 
"I represent the Broad Front bloc on this committee, which fully 
supports the Leninist regime of Fidel Castro." 
  "I totally disagree with this and I would like to strongly 
discuss with Mr. Robaina the violations currently occurring in 
Cuba. This would mean contradicting the majority of my sector 
and for the sake of party discipline I will not participate in 
that session," the congressman added. 
  During the past few months he has been criticized by the 
most 
radical sectors of the Broad Front, which includes socialists, 
communists, Trotskyists, Leninists, independents, and former 
Tupamaro guerrillas, among others. 
  The decision not to participate in the session to honor the 
Cuban foreign minister and the congressman's harsh criticism of 
Castro's regime may provoke an internal crisis within the 
leftist coalition. 
  For the first time ever, the Broad Front in 1989 won the 
municipality of Montevideo where half the Uruguayan population 
live. Mayor Tabare Vazquez, a socialist and doctor, will be a 
presidential candidate in the 27 November elections. 
  The latest polls show the Broad Front currently in second 
place after the Colorado Party, which has traditionally governed 
and which is now the main opposition party ahead of the Blanco 
Party. 
  Robaina, 38, is the youngest foreign minister in Cuba's 
history. He will meet in Montevideo with Uruguayan President 
Luis Alberto Lacalle and with Tabare Vazquez. He will not meet 
with former Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti--the 
leader of the Colorado Party who, according to the polls, is 
most likely to win the elections--because he is currently abroad. 
  During Sanguinetti's presidency (1985-1990), Uruguay renewed 
diplomatic relations with Cuba in October 1985, after a 20-year 
rupture.

  [Text] Montevideo, 4 Apr (AFP-NA) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina Martinez announced today that his country will 
implement an open market policy. He stated that in a move to 
overcome the economic crisis that is weighing heavily on the 
island, Fidel Castro's administration will not "impose 
limitations" on the entry of foreign capital. 
  During a news conference Robaina pointed out that "our visit 
to Uruguay, as the first leg of a tour of the region, seeks to 
explain to Latin American rulers the reality of the Cuban 
situation and to announce the opening of our market to foreign 
capital." 
  Robaina acknowledged that the economic and social 
deterioration confronting Cuba has obliged its rulers to seek a 
way out by "implementing an open market policy and accepting 
that foreign capital--regardless of its origin--can invest in 
our country free from any constraints." 
  The Cuban foreign minister, who arrived in Montevideo on 4 
April for a three-day official visit, was received by President 
Luis Alberto Lacalle at his private residence. They held a 
30-minute talk. 
  Robaina said: "We discussed several subjects of Latin 
American interest, laying special emphasis on the reality that 
we Cubans are living through at present and on the possibility 
of enhancing bilateral trade." 
  Trade between Uruguay and Cuba is paralyzed due to the fact 
that the Castro administration has a $30 million debt with 
Uruguay that has been outstanding for four years. Robaina 
offered to repay this debt by "sending medicines and medical 
equipment" to Uruguay. 
  The young foreign minister said that "the most promising 
sectors for those investors who are interested in coming to Cuba 
are tourism, biotechnology, and agriculture." 
  Following his meeting with Lacalle, Robaina had luncheon 
with 
Liber Seregni, the leader of the leftist coalition, the Broad 
Front, and then had a meeting with Cubans residing in Uruguay. 
  The Cuban foreign minister's agenda also includes a meeting 
with his Uruguayan counterpart Sergio Abreu on 5 April. On the 
last day of his visit Robaina will deliver a speech before 
representatives from the 11 countries that make up the Latin 
American Integration Association (ALADI), which is headquartered 
in Montevideo. 
  Cuban Embassy spokesmen have reported that Robaina's tour, 
which started in Uruguay, will also include visits to Peru, 
Argentina, and Paraguay.

  [Text] Once again, the waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the 
eastern coasts of the United States will be the stage for 
military manuevers by U.S. naval, air, and land forces. These 
manuevers are called the (Fleet-tex-2-94) Joint Exercise. 
Today's edition of the newspaper GRANMA points out that for the 
purpose of setting the inhabitants of all regions of the world 
at ease vis-a-vis the mobilization of its military forces, the 
U.S. Government usually announces that the maneuvers are routine 
or that they are merely innocent exercises. 
  In this case, GRANMA adds, the U.S. Department of Defense 
says its goal is to put its stamp of approval on a large portion 
of those forces to be mobilized to Europe. It is difficult to 
understand the essence of that idea when the allegedly innocent 
exercises include approximately 13,000 troops; 23 ships, 
including a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier; and more than 100 
airplanes. 
  GRANMA, which is the official newspaper of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, also emphasizes the 
participation of an Argentine destroyer and submarine, which 
join a very dangerous military buildup in regions very far from 
their home base. Last, GRANMA underscores the moral, derived 
from another Creole saying: The road to hell is paved with good 
intentions.

  [Text] A bilateral antidrug agreement for cooperation 
between Cuba and Argentina was signed this afternoon at the 
Foreign Ministry. The agreement was signed by Cuban Justice 
Minister Carlos Amat and Argentine Secretary of State [title as 
heard] Alberto Lestelle. Lestelle told the press that this 
agreement will trigger the development of relations between the 
two countries within a very short term. 
  [Begin Lestelle recording] The signing of this agreement 
implies, first of all, something very significant for the two 
countries. This agreement extends far beyond the regions, far 
beyond government decisions, and far beyond other problems. It 
will become the main gate between Argentina and Cuba for the 
treatment of other problems, which perhaps could be even more 
important than the drug issue. 
  During a week of work in the areas of health, education, and 
the police, each group will meet independently and prepare a 
program. This program will determine how we will be able to 
provide assistance to Cuba, and how Cuba can provide us with 
assistance as well. We are going to analyze this further on a 
later date, but I also think that Argentine Health Ministry 
officials must visit Cuba to see the development of the family 
doctor program. We have only a brief sketch of this in 
Argentina, nothing else. By virtue of these meetings, we must 
establish what we can do here and what you can do in Argentina. 
So this possibility must remain open. [end recording] 
  I wish to add that Dr. Lestelle heads an Argentine 
delegation 
that has been visiting Cuba for several days, seeking the 
signing of this cooperation agreement for the antidrug fight. I 
would also like to tell our listeners that Cuba is a signatory 
of the UN convention for the fight against international drug 
trafficking and has agreed to sign bilateral agreements with 
many countries of the region.

  [Text] The Japanese Mitsubishi Company's presence in Cuba 
has been confirmed by the presentation and display of its 
automobile products. The Mitsubishi Company has been announced 
as the first Japanese company to establish a long-range business 
deal in Cuba. Also present in that investment is the Sumitomo 
Trading Corporation [name given in English], one of the largest 
automobile companies in Japan. 
  Mitsubishi declared the Panamanian company, International 
Engines, its representative in Cuba. This company has been 
operating in the Cuban automobile market for more than 10 years. 
  This is seen as a short-term investment with an immediate 
impact on the Cuban tourism sector, although the Japanese 
managers have expressed interest in extending their investments 
into other economic areas, and have confirmed their confidence 
in Cuban economic growth. The Cuban party said this investment 
implies the first economic rapprochement between Japan and Cuba.

  [Text] This weekend in Santiago de Cuba, border guard 
troops and workers of the Navegacion Caribe enterprise thwarted 
an act of naval piracy and kidnapping by people trying to 
illegally leave Cuba through the Guantanamo Naval Base: nine 
people, three women and two children, ages five and nine, in 
complicity with Angel Jesus Hernandez Laguna, the operator of a 
Navegacion Caribe self-propelled barge used in their escape 
attempt. 
  The barge was sighted in La Socapa area, before exiting 
Santiago de Cuba Bay, and was pursued by border guard troops for 
50 minutes in an effort to make them give up their illegal 
plans. At Daiquiri Beach, members of the border guard and 
workers of the Navegacion Caribe enterprise boarded the barge 
without firearms, engaged in a man-to-man struggle, and managed 
to subdue the fugitives. This is how the chief of the operation, 
Lieutenant Colonel Lesmes Leal Lescay, described it: 
  [Begin Leal Lescay recording] During the struggle, the only 
injuries the six men sustained were blows; three of our comrades 
also sustained minor blows, some requiring four or five 
stitches. We were able to subdue the men without using firearms, 
in compliance with the guidelines issued by the minister of the 
Interior and the provincial and border guard chiefs. 
  Throughout, we guaranteed that nothing would happen to the 
three women and two children. I took care of that, and once we 
had them, we were able to control the men and guarantee that 
nothing would happen to the women and children at any time. [end 
recording] 
  To prevent the illegal departure of these people, 20 border 
guard troops and workers of the Navegacion Caribe enterprise 
received the Interior Ministry's distinguished service medal, 
the 30 Years of Combat Fraternity pin, and the 20 Years of 
Committees for the Defense of the Revolution Vigilance pin.

  [Text] The Giron-94 exercise began on 5 April in Havana 
with the participation of the joint forces of the Unified 
Vigilance and Protection System. The exercise is designed to 
test the effectiveness of the system's various command levels 
and the defense and rapid-response mechanisms of the forces of 
the Interior Ministry [Minint] and the rest of the political and 
mass organizations, with the direct participation of citizens in 
defending the Revolution. The exercise will last until 17 April 
and comprises the 15 Havana municipalities. Different operations 
will be conducted to neutralize possible counterrevolutionary or 
criminal acts within the city limits. 
  Jorge Lezcano Perez, Politburo member and first secretary of 
the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Havana, top leaders of the 
provincial government, and high-level Minint and Revolutionary

<F P=106> [Report by Pepe Suarez] </F>
  [Text] Good evening, Cuba. The neutralization of a 
simulated enemy invasion of the town of Santa Fe on the western 
coast of Havana was the result achieved by the joint forces of 
the Unified Vigilance and Protection System [SUVP] of the Cuban 
capital, where the Giron-94 exercises began today. These 
exercises will be extended until 17 April in an effort to 
actively thwart criminal and antisocial actions. 
  In each locality of the capital, troops from the FAR 
[Revolutionary Armed Forces] and of the Minim [Interior 
Ministry], together with the fast-response brigades, are 
operating jointly with the troops of the political and social 
organizations under the command of the Joint General Staff of 
the SUVP to test the effectiveness of the command's guidelines 
and the revolutionary response capability against criminal and 
enemy actions. 
  Speaking with the inhabitants of Santa Fe in Havana City, 
Jorge Lezcano Perez, Politburo member and first secretary of the 
provincial committee in the capital, said the results of this 
operation, called Operation Dignity, were excellent. He also 
spoke with the people about Cubans who try to illegally leave 
the country and the risks these actions represent, both for the 
physical safety of the illegal runaways and for the Coast Guard 
troops who patrol our shores. Lezcano stressed the political 
manipulation conducted by the enemies of the Revolution, 
referring to the issue of illegal departures for the United 
States, and urged all revolutionaries who were there to offset 
any action that might tarnish the image and feelings of our 
people. 
  Giron-94 is already yielding its first political results, 
and 
on the field of operations, it will provide great surprises to 
those who might underestimate the defense and response 
capabilities of the Revolution.

  [Text] According to the newspaper GRANMA, deputies have 
begun their analysis in preparation for the next session of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP]. In Granma, 
ANPP President Ricardo Alarcon chaired the country's first 
meeting with deputies to analyze the results of Parliaments in 
the Workplaces and to note some of the ideas that could be used 
in preparation for the ANPP special session scheduled for 1 May. 
  Preliminary reports submitted by Deputy Ernesto Suarez, who 
is also an ANPP secretary, state that 3 million workers 
participated in the parliaments, by which the workers 
demonstrated their patriotism, honor, and willingness to do 
whatever might be necessary to save the Revolution. For that 
meeting, the ANPP president and seven permanent ANPP working 
committees visited Granma for the rendering of the province's 
accounts in preparation for the next special period of sessions 
of our parliament. 
  Rafael Dominguez Fernandez, president of the provincial 
government, released a report on the socioeconomic 
characteristics of Granma, its work objectives, and a rendering 
of its accounts. Also present were Deputy Jaime Crombet, who is 
a member of the Cuban Communist Party [PCC] Central Committee 
and vice president of the ANPP; and Alfredo Enriquez Pina, PCC 
first secretary.

  [Text] A special-assignment reconnaissance unit, which has 
been considered the vanguard unit of the FAR [Revolutionary 
Armed Forces] seven consecutive times, is a true example of the 
stability and strength of the Central Army, which is celebrating 
the 33d anniversary of its founding today. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified parachutist] I do not 
believe 
a parachutist is an amateur. A parachutist is a man capable of 
overcoming the fear that any man feels when he suddenly finds 
himself at a very high altitude, looks down, and realizes he is 
far from the earth. 
  [Second parachutist] It is not easy. When I was up in the 
sky, I looked down and things looked so small to me. That is the 
impression I had of things below. [end recording] 
  Although they may not admit it, they are surely exceptional 
men. This special unit has carried out two internationalist 
missions and is the best of its kind among the three Armies. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording, in progress] ...which 
we use to reach the enemy's rearguard and the area we want; that 
is, to carry out a reconoissance mission against the enemy. 
  This unit receives strong, overall special training, which 
includes physical training, target practice, tactics, and other 
aspects that make up the daily life of the troops. [end 
recording] 
  Skill, power, and diversity are the characteristics of these 
anonymous men, examples of willingness and commitment. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] What are the main objectives? 
  [Unidentified officer] Obviously, our main objectives are to 
maintain this condition and to remain the best unit of its kind 
within the FAR in the training being carried out. To achieve 
this, we are going to fulfill the seven major working guidelines 
of our Army, and thus, of our unit. [end recording]

  [Text] On 5 April, the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] 
announced that beginning this year, it will financially sponsor 
the Jose Marti Pioneers organization. Pedro Ross, Politburo 
member and secretary general of the CTC, made the announcement 
on 4 April in Camaguey following a ceremony marking the 
completion of the Jiguey Cayo-Romano Cayo Cruz causeway. Ross 
added that the decision was made on the basis of union dues 
contributed by the workers and which is their gift to the 
youngest organization in Cuba on its 33d anniversary, adding 
that 8 million pesos are already earmarked for that goal this 
year, thanks to expenditure reductions by the CTC. Ross pointed 
out that over the past three years, CTC expenditures have been 
less than 30 million pesos, and that in 1993 they were 28 
million as the result of reductions in personnel rosters and 
other expenditures.

  [Text] Health specialists encouraged organizations to work 
together in the prevention of illnesses transmitted from animals 
to human beings, which in medical terms is known as zoonosis. 
During a national workshop in Ciego de Avila on the diseases 
that animals can communicate to humans, there was unanimity of 
opinion that this can not be a task of the Ministry of Public 
Health alone, but of other institutions and the population in 
general. A call was made to the Ministries of Sugar Industry, 
Agriculture, Education, Fishing Industry, and Veterinary 
Medicine to cooperate in that area. 
  Dr. Raul Cruz de la Paz, head of the national program for 
control of diseases transmitted by animals, pointed out that it 
is necessary to double preventative measures to prevent many of 
these cases. It was advised that in May, the Pedro Couri 
Institute of Tropical Medicine will begin experimentating with 
the Cuban vaccine against leptospirosis in human beings. 
Leptospirosis is the most dangerous disease transmitted by 
animals in Cuba. In 1993, 1,446 people were affected by this 
disease, of whom 75 died. The leptospirosis section of Ciego de 
Avila was classified as the best in the country, in 1993, for 
its complete and systematic work.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Absenteeism: A Challenge to Collective </F>
Self-Respect"] 
  [Text] We Cubans have come to the 99th anniversary of the 
Proclamation of Independence with a real feeling that the battle 
waged by those revolutionaries continues today without the 
actual fighting but with the same need to give our all for 
national freedom and sovereignty. 
  Nevertheless, a century later the Fatherland is summoning us 
not to our military duty to kill or be killed but rather to our 
civic duty to do better work so that we can preserve law and 
order, as well as our resistance, and development potential. If 
we fail to do so, if we lack the willpower and intelligence to 
build today, tomorrow the temptation will be great to bring Cuba 
to its knees by force, and we will be forced to fight on the 
battlefield, where courage, valor, and patriotism are gauged by 
what we destroy, not by what we build. 
  Today's army must be one of creators. Just as soldiers are 
given the opportunity to fight because of their willingness to 
observe discipline, Cuban workers must be more disciplined than 
they currently are in order to assure victory on the economic 
battlefield. 
  In this effort the chiefs play a vital role, as their own 
main disciplinary failing may be their inability or 
unwillingness to demand discipline from their subordinates. 
  Cuban workers, most of whom are also soldiers, know that a 
joint action will not be successful unless someone wisely 
directs the efforts of all towards success. 
  One group of workers using the same materials as another 
similar group, often does a disciplined, enthusiastic, and 
efficient job just because they have a real leader. 
  Leadership is not a privilege; it is a demanding 
responsibility. We need chiefs who do not look at numbers 
impassively, who do not become demoralized, who can appeal to 
honor and ethics, who are passionate about their work and their 
people, and who can by their example inspire their workers to 
move ahead and tackle problems. 
  One suspects that in many cases the high level of worker 
absenteeism is due to cowardly chiefs and union leaders who do 
not understand their political function and fail to demand 
administrative action against labor indiscipline. 
  In their parliamentary meetings the workers are vigorously 
denouncing absenteeism, although they understand the current 
transportation difficulties and other limitations. 
  There is strong criticism of the people who regularly fail 
to 
show up for work. In many instances this small minority is to 
blame for the statistics that are giving everyone a bad image. 
  At thousands of assemblies the workers have expressed their 
desire to put an end to the lack of control over the issuance of 
medical certificates and over the protracted process of 
specialist reports on illnesses. In some cases these excuses are 
denounced as mere legal pretexts that conceal a lack of 
conscientiousness. In many places it is being argued that a 
limit must be set on the number of days a year a worker can 
avoid doing his duty on such grounds. 
  All of this contrasts with the simplistic approach to the 
problem of absenteeism at other centers. The managers and the 
unions there do not seem to realize that when they admit an 
absenteeism rate of 9 percent, for example, they are saying that 
they are not working one month a year. And we are talking here 
about a far from exaggerated rate, in light of the actual 
numbers. 
  In the wake of the work-center assemblies, where there was 
so 
much discussion about efficiency, without which the country's 
economic recovery is impossible, managers, unions, and workers 
have no choice but to devote themselves to reducing these high 
rates of absenteeism, because there can be no talk of efficiency 
in places that stop working one or two months a year. 
  We must show an elementary sense of social responsibility 
towards and solidarity with the many workers who are evincing 
true patriotism and conscientiousness. They are the ones who get 
up when it is still dark and return to their homes by moonlight, 
who do farm and other work often with worn out soles, who work 
double shifts at hospitals so that patients are cared for, and 
who do not flag in their daily duties in order to save the 
Fatherland with hard work, intelligence, and honor. 
  It is true that being on time for work is not the be-all and 
end-all of discipline. But if this primary obligation is not 
observed, if this elementary rule is not complied with, it 
cannot be denied that very little can be done to improve 
technological and economic discipline at work centers. 
  During these early months of the year we have made great 
progress in grasping the problems facing us. The year 1994 must 
not close without clear-cut gains in reducing absenteeism. 
  Prescriptions are not necessary. Each work center must do 
what each town demands. But also, in each town the problem of 
absenteeism must be a challenge to collective self-respect, to 
the expertise of chiefs, and to the prestige of the union 
section.

  [Text] Political dealings are becoming more intense in the 
Haitian capital in an effort to compel parliament to fill the 
institutional vacuum left when the government of Prime Minister 
Robert Malval resigned on 15 December 1993. Right after the 
Easter truce, political parties that rallied together in a 
coalition addressed the Haitian legislators. Until now, steps 
taken have been in political meetings, but now tend to extend 
beyond this scope into the street. The party leaders behind this 
movement are insistently asking for the application of the 
Constitution's Article 149, and are threatening to mobilize the 
population, their crowd of supporters, in the next few days. A 
first step might have been taken with the public radio 
announcements calling the senators and deputies to action in 
solving the crisis. More should perhaps be known today with the 
conference to be held by the Coordinating Committee for National 
Mobilization.

  [Excerpts] We are moving toward a straightforward rejection 
of the resolution of the Coordinating Committee for National 
Mobilization, a resolution enjoining parliament to implement 
Article 149 of the Constitution. The main political bloc within 
the Chamber of Deputies, the socialist bloc, is adhering to the 
parliamentary plan waiting to be ratified in the Senate of the 
Republic. Daly Valet who had an interview with the president of 
the socialist bloc, Deputy Duly Brutus, tells us more: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] The Easter season had a 
calming effect on all the political sectors that were pressuring 
the parliament to implement Article 149 and close the file on 
the 16 December [1991] president. The Easter season has ended 
and the political battle has resumed. No new solution has been 
proposed. The same ideas are being discussed. The political 
leaders are ruminating over the same proposals. Thus, the plan 
of the Action Committee for National Reconciliation, the Front 
for Haitian Advancement and Progress, and the Mobilization for 
National Development, which have formed an alliance, has a 
chance of being discussed in the Chamber of Deputies this week. 
This plan, which provides for the formation of an ad hoc 
government, has every chance of being rejected in the Chamber of 
Deputies because the principal political blocs remain attached 
to the parliamentary plan that was approved by the Chamber. On 
that score, the position of the president of the socialist bloc 
is quite clear. 
  [Brutus] As president of the socialist bloc, I can tell you 
that for the time being, our position remains unchanged. 
[passage omitted] Our position remains the same; that is, we are 
supporting the plan that was accepted in Washington among 
parliamentarians and was ratified in the Chamber of Deputies. 
  [Valet] The U.S. Government's arbitrary position, that is, 
involving itself in getting a plan signed that it will later 
boycott, has caused some parliamentarians to be apprehensive. 
These parliamentarians say they cannot understand why the U.S. 
Government says it supports the parliamentary plan, but has 
proposed a new plan called the synchronous plan. But in the 
opinion of other parliamentarians, like Duly Brutus, there is 
not much difference between the parliamentary plan and the U.S. 
plan. If there is any difference, the deputy says, it is in the 
way the two plans have been written and in their length.

  [Text] Over 200 employees of a factory are threatened with 
unemployment in view of the grave fuel crisis being experienced 
by the country for some months and the problem of power cuts. 
Let us listen to a report by our correspondent for the [Les 
Cayes] area, Henrisma Robert: 
  [Begin Robert recording in progress] ...the only one out of 
10 vetiver essence factories in the Les Cayes area has decided 
to shut down. Their fuel reserves have run out. The owners of 
those factories...[pauses] We met, for example, with Mr. 
(Eugene), who said he wanted to keep one of the three vetiver 
essence factories he owns, located near (Ravine du Sud), 
operating. This factory owner told us is he doing his best not 
to shut down because he employs more than 200 heads of household 
who have no other job. Moreover, said (Eugene), southern Haiti 
alone produces over 80 percent of the vetiver essence on the 
national market, so this product constitutes an important source 
of income for the southern region. (Eugene) explained, however, 
that given the difficulties he is facing because of the gasoline 
and gasoil problem and the high cost of materiel that has broken 
down or needs replacing, he is going to put an end, over the 
weekend, to the operations of the only factory operating in Les 
Cayes. The question many people are asking now is: When will the 
Dessalines [sugar] Company follow suit? 
  This is Henrisma Robert from Les Cayes for Signal FM. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with Ernesto Zedillo, presidential candidate for </F>
Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, by Jacobo 
Zabludovsky at the network's studio in Mexico City -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Zabludovsky] Dr. Zedillo, thank you for being with 
us this evening. 
  [Zedillo] Thank you for inviting me. 
  [Zabludovsky] Dr. Zedillo, a few days ago you were the 
coordinator of Luis Donaldo Colosio's campaign. After his 
tragic demise, you are now a presidential candidate, as a result 
of your party's decision. What are your feelings? How do you 
feel? 
  [Zedillo] First, I think that like all Mexicans, I have a 
deep and heartfelt feeling of pain over the tragic death of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio. Like all Mexicans, it is my great hope this 
crime will be cleared up very soon and that all Mexicans will 
know the truth about the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
It is a desire, a demand which we all make. Also, I am firmly 
determined to assume the responsibility given me by my party. 
  [Zabludovsky] You have said that you will continue what Mr. 
Colosio began. How do you view this presidential race? 
  [Zedillo] I see it as highly competitive. The parties that 
are different from mine, the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary 
Party], are serious, organized political organizations that have 
been working quite effectively and arduously in their campaigns. 
I can see that all the presidential candidates deserve my 
utmost respect and consideration. They are conducting intense 
political activities. I clearly recognize that this is a 
competitive race in which our party will face serious 
contenders. At the same time, however, I am convinced the 
voters, the Mexican people, on learning about the background of 
the different candidates and on learning about the different 
platforms each of us is proposing to solve the problems of 
Mexico, will choose the option I represent. 
  [Zabludovsky] You speak about experience, your background in 
public service. In a nutshell, what is that background? 
  [Zedillo] In a nutshell, it dates back to many years of 
experience, exactly 25 years ago. I began as an assistant 
auditor in the National Bank of the Army and Navy. Later, in 
the early 1970's, I went over to the Presidency Secretariat. 
After that, I left to study abroad. Upon my return, I worked 
in the Banco de Mexico for several years. Later, after 1987, I 
was appointed by the president as undersecretary for programming 
and budget. On 1 September 1988, I was appointed programming 
and budget secretary. In early 1992, I held the post of public 
education secretary. It is a 25-year career that has taken me 
to different sectors of public administration, two of the most 
modest posts, and to the post of state secretary. 
  [Zabludovsky] Dr. Zedillo, we are especially interested in 
hearing about your experiences as state secretary. First, can 
you expand a bit on what you did when you were undersecretary in 
the Programming and Budget Secretariat and when you headed that 
Secretariat? 
  [Zedillo] With great pleasure. There is something that I 
consider singular in my experience as undersecretary: that was 
participating in the drafting and implementation of the first 
national pact designed to banish the threat of hyperinflation, 
which loomed large over us in late 1987. Perhaps this action by 
the government was particularly important for the country's 
development. Above all, it was important for the people's 
welfare because inflation at that time hit the poor sectors 
especially hard, as it did salaried workers; those whose buying 
power deteriorates constantly with inflation. Hence, my 
satisfaction at having been there at that time and having 
participated at that moment in the overall planning for several 
years, which we must consider successful. 
  [Zabludovsky] Dr. Zedillo, that satisfaction of which you 
speak, the economic achievements in which you played a leading 
role to create the economic system we now have in Mexico, has 
been criticized by many people. Not only has it been 
criticized, but changes in the economic system have been accused 
of causing all our ailments. What do you say? 
  [Zedillo] I would respectfully but emphatically oppose that 
view. We have to recognize, and I would be the first to 
recognize, the serious problems we still have in our country. 
In our country, there are many Mexicans, millions of Mexicans, 
who are living in extreme poverty. These are Mexicans who lack 
the most essential necessities. They are facing a situation of 
marked inequality, not only among people but among regions of 
the country. 
  It would be absurd to assume an air of triumph when 
confronted with this reality. Likewise, I believe we should not 
deny the merit of what has been done in the past few years. It 
was the product of efforts not only by the government but by 
Mexican society as a whole. We have spent these years facing 
our country's deepest crisis in decades. We have laid the 
groundwork for a future that holds better opportunities for all 
Mexicans. It has been complex work, work that has led us to 
reform different aspects of national life, but I believe we can 
truly say that the transformation has been implemented with the 
Mexican people's welfare in mind. 
  If you allow me, I would like to cite a specific example. A 
while ago you asked me about my work at the Planning and Budget 
Secretariat. One of the essential aspects of that work was 
making sure that public finances would stop being the principal 
cause of inflation. We went from a huge deficit in public 
resources needed to cover public spending to a situation where 
we had virtual equilibrium. 
  That was necessary to bring inflation under control, to 
restore minimum order to the economy. But the great merit of 
this economic policy was that not only public finances achieved 
equilibrium and even surplus, but that an unprecedented policy 
was applied to increase social spending in our country. This is 
the most important spending because it is spending on people, on 
human beings. Just as we were achieving equilibrium in our 
public finances, our social spending went from nearly 30 percent 
of total public sector spending to 50 percent during the first 
three years of this administration, when I was planning and 
budget secretary. 
  I believe that is the outlook that must be adopted when 
analyzing efforts by all Mexicans over the last few years. We 
have to look ahead. We have to recognize that renewal is 
necessary in many aspects of the national life. Changes will be 
necessary, but these changes will always have to be oriented by 
the need to first serve the Mexican people. We must not 
diminish the value of efforts of so many people in the past few 
years. 
  [Zabludovsky] Bearing this in mind, what is the future of 
the 
NAFTA? 
  [Zedillo] NAFTA, as the other measures to open up trade, 
must 
only be seen as one of the many instruments we have obtained in 
the last few years to generate better job opportunities, better 
wage opportunities for Mexicans. That is the treaty's role. We 
must not confuse the means with the end; the end is the welfare 
of each Mexican family. NAFTA is one of the many means we have 
available to increase the welfare of the Mexican family. 
  [Zabludovsky] You were also recently in charge of the Public 
Education Secretariat. As public education secretary, what were 
your most important experiences during your tenure? 
  [Zedillo] I came into the Public Education Secretariat with 
instructions from the president to promote and coordinate, with 
the participation of many people, thorough and profound 
educational reform. This plan for educational reform was based 
on an very basic-level diagnosis of the condition of our 
country's schools and educational system. We were facing a 
severe problem with centralization and bureaucracy in our 
country's basic education system. As a result, the first 
instruction I received was to reach an agreement with the 
governments of each state and with the largest labor union in 
Latin America, the National Teachers Union, on the 
federalization or decentralization of the basic education 
system. This means that all those schools, elementary schools 
and high schools, that were supervised in all aspects from 
Mexico City, had to be transferred to the governments of each 
state so that the government authority would be closer to the 
interests, the needs of the school itself. This was necessary 
in laying the groundwork for a new educational system. It was a 
very complex political, administrative, and financial endeavor. 
  Some months later, thanks to the participation, in the 
first place, of the union, which played a key role in this 
decision and its implementation, and thanks to state 
governments, we were able to undertake what must be viewed as 
one of the largest decentralization operations in the world. We 
handed over to local governments 100,000 schools, 13.5 million 
students, 700,000 education workers, and a budget of 20 billion 
new pesos. This was the budget already earmarked for education 
by the federal government plus an additional amount to improve 
the operation of said schools. I think this is a very important 
example because it sets a guideline for the future. 
  This shows the federal government's determination, based on 
political consensus, to transfer authority, responsibility, and 
resources to local governments. People must have confidence in 
local governments because they are closer to the people. This 
was the first aspect of educational reform. 
  We also set out to revise for the first time in 20 years the 
lesson plans and programs which had been in force since 1972. 
Thanks to this reform of lesson plans and programs we were able 
to satisfy, within the educational system, long-standing desires 
of parents and teachers. For instance, we reinstated the way in 
which we learned our national language, that is by emphasizing 
reading and writing instead of the structural linguistics to 
which children were being exposed since the first grade of 
elementary school. We decided to teach children mathematics the 
way in which you and I were taught, with numbers, basic 
mathematics, and, above all, problem solving. 
  Something especially rewarding to those who participated in 
that reform was the reinstatement of the systematic study of the 
history of the fatherland, national geography, and civic values, 
which were lost in the 1972 reform. Parents and teachers had 
demanded that the aforementioned subjects be reinstated. 
  Also as secretary of public education, but always as part of 
a large team and counting on the support of many people and the 
union, we undertook an academic reform in the higher 
technological institutes of the country, which number about 130. 
This was the first in-depth reform since the creation of 
technological institutes. 
  It was also very rewarding to have participated in the 
consolidation of the national system of researchers, to have 
taken part toward the end of my term as public education 
secretary in the creation of the national system of authors, and 
to have presided over the in-depth reform of the National 
Council of Science and Technology and in general of all the 
institutions for scientific and technological research in our 
country. 
  Education is truly one of the most satisfying areas in my 
public life, for what it represents for Mexico and for the 
contact I established with teachers, Mexican children, and 
parents. There is no nobler task than education. 
  [Zabludovsky] While you were at the helm of the Public 
Education Secretariat, the measures adopted by the government 
were not superficial. A profound transformation was effected. 
  [Zedillo] These were the instructions of the president of 
the 
republic, to institute profound reform. During the 
implementation of said reform, Article 3 of the Constitution was 
reformed. This reform is very important because it established, 
for the first time in our Constitution, the right to education. 
Paradoxically, our Constitution did not guarantee this right. 
This reform established secondary education as mandatory for 
all people and as a mandatory obligation of the state. This did 
not exist before. 
  It was also very satisfying that this reform of Article 3 of 
the Constitution received support from all political parties in 
our country. Until that time, there was no precedent for 
constitutional reform of the kind approved for Article 3. 
  Another indication that the reform was structural is the 
fact that the process generated a new general education law, 
based on the new foresight the educational system should have. 
This new general education law, which I believe is innovative 
legislation, was approved by over 90 percent of the deputies 
present for the debates on this new legal instrument. I agree 
that the main objective of this was to implement profound 
reform. This reform is already in motion, it is being applied, 
and it will surely bear fruit in the coming years. 
  [Zabludovsky] I also believe, Mr. Zedillo, that one of the 
consequences of this deep transformation of our educational 
system was that it brought together all sectors of society to 
participate in a very intense public debate. The debate took 
several months. People expressed their opinion and managed to 
guide certain solutions in the field of public education. 
  [Zedillo] That is right. There was a big debate on several 
issues. One was the issue of decentralization. Thanks to a 
very complex but very interesting negotiation with the union, 
which I personally found very enlightening, we approved the 
federalization of the education system. There was a debate of 
the Education Secretariat's decision to reinstate the systematic 
study of Mexican history and how we would provide the children 
emergency study material -- as we called it at the time -- to 
study Mexican history, once the Secretariat issued the order. 
There were many differences of opinion over these books. In 
the end, however, the result was clear: the study of Mexican 
history was reintroduced, after 20 years of absence from Mexican 
schools. We laid the foundations and established the criteria 
to produce, write, and edit new and more specific textbooks, 
which Mexican children are using today. The debates and the 
controversy were well worth our while. 
  [Zabludovsky] We know the country has many problems, all of 
which would be difficult to enumerate. Of all of these problems 
we Mexicans face, which do you believe are the most important? 
  [Zedillo] Mr. Zabludovsky, I believe our country faces many 
problems, but given your question and in an effort to summarize, 
I would say that we face four basic problems. 
  First, we must recognize that there is a serious problem 
with 
injustice and insecurity in our country. It would be wrong to 
deny this reality. The second problem is unemployment. This is 
a problem that, by the way, has worsened recently. Unemployment 
has worsened significantly during the past year, after several 
years of improvement. The third very serious problem I see is 
the very low, and in many cases, insufficient income of our 
country's working classes. The fourth serious problem I see is 
the enormous social imbalance that persists in our country. 
Consequently, we have the conditions of poverty in which many 
Mexicans live. 
  I would rather not assign these problems specific 
priorities. 
Each is as important as the others. Furthermore, I believe it 
will be difficult to address any one of them without seriously 
and decidedly addressing the others. 
  [Zabludovsky] There we have four serious problems. How do we 
plan? Admitting that we need to very closely examine our system 
for administering justice. This means we need to evaluate our 
justice system's current situation and have the Congress examine 
the results. Then, if need be, they can approve the appropriate 
reforms that will permit the judicial system to execute its 
basic duty more efficiently. 
  The other three problems that you have mentioned are very 
interconnected. They are social and economic problems. One is 
unemployment, another is the working class' low salaries, and 
the fourth problem you mention is poverty in general. Let us 
group them together. I would like to ask: How do you plan to 
confront this situation that so concerns and obsesses all 
Mexicans? I am talking about solutions to the problems of 
poverty and economic inequality. 
  [Zedillo] I think these four problems must be solved in an 
integrated, development-oriented fashion. We cannot just deal 
with one problem at a time. We must take the four problems as 
one. Thus we can identify at least four areas in which the 
government can act. 
  First, we need to strengthen justice and democracy in our 
country. We need to have fairer laws that can be better 
applied. This speaks to the issue of the country's social, 
economic, and political life. If we do not take care of these 
problems, we will have serious difficulties in confronting the 
other problems. The first thing we must do is strengthen 
justice and democracy. 
  The second area for action is social development, which is 
nothing more than investment in human beings. We have to spend 
more on education, health, housing, basic urban services, and 
social security, this with our retirees in mind. We need an 
extremely ambitious social policy. Through this extremely 
ambitious policy, citizens will be more aware of their rights 
but also more willing and able to participate in national life. 
  The third part of the solution necessarily has to do with 
the 
problem of competitiveness or productivity of each person, in 
each company, and in each economic unit. These are the 
microeconomic aspects of development. 
  The fourth issue we already know about. It concerns the 
country's economic stability, which is necessary but not 
sufficient, I admit, for the nation's development. The country 
needs financial and price stability, things that we have 
achieved in the past few years through great effort. 
  The four issues are justice and democracy, social 
development, productivity, and economic stability. If we can 
come up with an integrated -- I believe this is completely 
feasible -- policy that includes these four issues, we will 
create a virtual circle of economic growth at a higher pace than 
in the past, accompanied by price stability and an indubitably 
more equitable distribution of wealth. This will help us 
progressively -- and we hope rapidly -- eliminate the conditions 
of extreme poverty in which many Mexicans live. 
  [Zabludovsky] We cannot avoid discussing a problem that 
emerged on 1 January. We can call it the Chiapas problem. How 
do you view this problem, and how do you view the peace process? 
  [Zedillo] First, I believe that, as all Mexicans have, I 
must 
express my feelings regarding the regrettable social conditions 
behind this problem. Poverty, backwardness, lack of education, 
and lack of health services are all at the root of this problem. 
We must accept this first. We must recognize that these 
conditions exist in Chiapas and other parts of our country. We 
have a great responsibility as Mexicans to face these social 
conditions that are so regrettable. 
  At the same time, with all due respect, with all frankness, 
I deplore the use of violence in the country under any 
circumstances. 
  I believe that in the face of what has happened, it was very 
fortunate our Army acted to protect national security, 
sovereignty, and peace. At the same time, I am very satisfied 
the government of the republic immediately sought peaceful ways 
to resolve this conflict. In this regard, I want to take this 
opportunity to express my full support for the job the president 
of the republic and his government have done to achieve a 
peaceful solution in Chiapas. 
  I support the government's decisions. I support each and 
every one of the steps it has taken through its representatives, 
especially the commissioner for peace, so we can soon attain an 
absolutely peaceful solution which can guarantee that we 
Mexicans will remain united. 
  [Zabludovsky] Dr. Zedillo, returning to Mexico's problems, 
what are your plans for Mexicans' health? 
  [Zedillo] The health problem is very important. 
Historically, in past decades, although Mexico has made great 
strides in extending its health care, we have to recognize that 
public health care is still insufficient. Even more serious, 
however, is that the health care system has not reached the 
country's poorest sectors. In the coming years, therefore, we 
must make an enormous effort to build more hospitals, increase 
the numbers of doctors and nurses, and guarantee that there will 
not be a single Mexican in this country who does not have access 
to this service. Of course, in the case of people who do not 
have access to social security, through the Mexican Social 
Security Institute and other institutions, we must ensure that 
the state's free medical service will take care of them. This is 
fundamental for humanitarian reasons. Nobody thinks there 
should be human suffering as a result of illness, or even death, 
as happens in many cases. Also, for economic reasons, we need 
better health in order to work better, produce more, earn higher 
incomes, and ensure income for all society. We must assume an 
enormous commitment to achieve better health for all Nexicans. 
  [Zabludovsky] One of Mexico's main problems is the 
countryside, Dr. Zedillo. 
  [Zedillo] I believe this is one of the state's most 
important 
areas of action. Approximately 28 percent of the country's 
total population, virtually 30 percent of Mexicans, live in 
rural areas. 
  We have two types of problems. Please accept my 
simplification. On the one hand, we have an acute social problem 
in the countryside. The poorest of the poor live in the 
countryside. The greatest needs for education, health, housing, 
potable water, and electricity are precisely there in the 
countryside. 
  But we also have a production problem. We have a situation 
where it has become increasingly difficult to have the Mexican 
countryside produce products demanded by the Mexican people for 
their sustenance. We must therefore attack problems in those two 
areas. We must have a very ambitious social policy to attack 
the root of that existing rural poverty. We must have a 
strategy to attack production problems. 
  The answer, as I said earlier, is to invest in human beings, 
which is the most important thing. Also, with regard to 
production, I think we must act on several fronts. We must 
apply, with great justice, Article 27 of the Constitution and 
reform the laws. We must invest in infrastructure, in technical 
assistance for the countryside. We must invest in training for 
farmers, support them in developing the new marketing system, 
and make sure that they obtain timely and sufficient credit -- 
as they say now -- at competitive costs. If they are to compete 
abroad, we must make sure that we give them competitive 
conditions. A fundamental factor in the countryside is credit. 
We cannot expect farmers to compete with imported foodstuffs 
unless we make sure that they also have raw materials and 
elements obtained at competitive prices on the international 
market. 
  I think it is a very important and complex task, but I am 
sure the transformation of the Mexican countryside can be 
achieved. With a strong social policy and with a coherent 
policy for increasing productivity in the countryside, we can 
help many million Mexicans living there to overcome conditions 
of extreme poverty that affect them. 
  [Zabludovsky] Doctor, in your proposal, what is the role of 
small and medium-sized businesses? 
  [Zedillo] Micro-, small-, and medium-sized businesses have 
always played a fundamental role in the economic life of the 
country. Some 52 percent of the jobs in Mexico are generated by 
these businesses. Some 98 percent of businesses in our country 
are either small or medium-sized. There are 1.3 million micro-, 
small-, and medium-sized businesses. 
  Evidently, the state and society must pay close attention to 
small and medium-sized businesses. It is not a matter of 
paternalism. Those businessmen would be the first to reject 
turning the clock back. I have many friends who are small 
businessmen, who have assumed with great dignity their new 
responsibility in light of the new circumstances but who also 
asked that they not be left alone. We must promote small and 
medium-sized businesses. 
  I believe there are very specific ways to achieve this. In 
the first place, the whole process must be made easier for them. 
All the red tape that encumbers small and medium businessmen 
must be eliminated. I am referring to the various regulations, 
including of course those related to taxes. 
  In the second place, it is necessary to know that for these 
businesses to succeed, they need to be up-to-date 
technologically. I believe that given the number of those 
businesses, specific state action is required, without 
paternalism, so they become aware of the need to seek new 
technology. All opportunities must be provided for this 
modernization to take place. 
  In the third place, I think it is very important for the 
state and businessmen to unite, making unprecedented efforts in 
Mexico's history to train the work force. In my opinion, this 
is one of the most significant challenges we face in the coming 
years. I believe this is possible because there is a great deal 
of experience in our country in this field. The problem is that 
the effort has not been widespread. 
  In the fourth place, it is also very important to foster 
models for partnerships among these types of businesses. 
Therefore, sir, I realize there is a very serious problem with 
regard to the small-, micro-, and medium-sized businesses. I am 
also convinced, however, there are solutions, and if these are 
applied we can overcome the obstacles. This is very important 
for all Mexicans that this occur. 
  [Zabludovsky] Doctor, what is democracy's role here? 
  [Zedillo] As I said before, we cannot seek to progress in 
one 
area of the nation's development and lag behind in another. 
Democracy is one of the fundamental political principles of the 
Mexican nation. It has been around since our Constitutions were 
drawn up during the last century. Democracy started the Mexican 
revolution: the holding of elections without reelection. This 
political principle was clearly established in the 1917 
Constitution, and therefore it is a principle that Mexicans must 
honor every day. 
  I must admit that this is an incomplete process. Our 
democracy can still be more perfect; a great deal of progress 
still has to be made. Nevertheless, I have a great deal of 
faith that if we can sustain that momentum, that drive in the 
progress made in the past years, very shortly all Mexicans will 
be able to say: We live in a fully and absolutely democratic 
nation. I believe, sir, that progress in democracy is 
imperative to progress in the other sectors of the nation's life. 
  [Zabludovsky] So then, as candidate for president, who does 
Ernesto Zedillo call on to do this? 
  [Zedillo] I call on all Mexicans who are willing to work so 
that at the beginning of the 21st century Mexico can be a 
sovereign and united country, a country that lives in peace and 
progress, a country that has left way behind very serious 
problems of inequality and poverty, a fully democratic country, 
as I said earlier. I call on all Mexicans who want to work to 
build the country in which we all believe and about which we all 
dream to participate with me in this election. 
  [Zabludovsky] What do you think of the other candidates? Do 
you think a debate would be useful? 
  [Zedillo] As I said earlier, I have great respect for and 
hold in high esteem the other candidates for president. I agree 
with Colosio and the other candidates that a debate is 
necessary. It is necessary to present to the Mexican people not 
only the problems of which we are all aware but also the 
proposals for solving those problems. I want my proposals to 
face off against the proposals of the other candidates. The 
Mexican people should be given an opportunity to compare these 
proposals so that everyone can cast his vote freely on 21 
August. And I expect the voters to cast their votes for me 
after they have compared the different proposals. As I said 
earlier, I have assumed this responsibility with determination, 
and I want to be president of the republic. 
  [Zabludovsky] Dr. Zedillo, is Mexico's existing electoral 
system reliable? 
  [Zedillo] My answer is yes. May I explain? First, in recent 
years, the Federal Congress or rather the Constituent Congress 
in the case of the Constitution -- or the Permanent Constituent 
Congress, as it is called, juridically speaking -- and the 
Federal Congress, in the case of Cofipe [Federal Code of 
Electoral Institutions and Procedures], has implemented a number 
of very important reforms. At least two basic facts can be 
pointed out in connection with these reforms: the existence of 
autonomous electoral institutions and the existence of an 
exemplary list of names, exemplary because of its outline, 
control, and verification characteristics. These reforms, which 
are very important, provide a much more trustworthy electoral 
system than the one we had up until a few years ago. 
  In addition, I must point out that the proposals PRI has 
drafted in past years to reinforce this electoral system and the 
proposals of other parties have crystallized, through consensus, 
in decisions to improve the electoral system. I have to recall 
that, on 27 January, the candidates for president from eight 
political parties signed an agreement for peace, democracy, and 
justice. Based on this agreement, the parties reached a 
consensus to reform Article 41 of the Constitution. This 
reformed article will surely be translated now into action as 
additional reforms to Cofipe. This enables us to expect -- we 
truly desire it and I fully endorse all of these agreements, as 
well as any others that derive from the Cofipe reform -- that we 
will have a fully reliable electoral system for the coming 
elections. So my answer is yes, we will have pure elections by 
virtue of all the effort made in the past few years. 
  [Zabludovsky] Speaking of political parties, how long have 
you been an active member of the PRI? 
  [Zedillo] Formally, since 1971, when I started activities at 
the Institute for Political, Economic, and Social Studies with 
then deputy director Leopoldo Solis. From a family standpoint, 
I can say I have been a party member for a long, long time. I 
am the son of an active female member of [words indistinct], who 
became leader in my state, and a PRI political activist, who 
always took me by the hand to all her activities. So I can say 
that I have been a proud member of the PRI since very early in 
my life because of my mother's influence, and formally a member 
since 1971. 
  [Zabludovsky] In light of the new laws, how do you view 
church-state relations, Dr. Zedillo? 
  [Zedillo] This is a very complex matter. Of course, I 
endorse and support the amendments of Article 130 of the 
Constitution approved two or three years ago. At the same time, 
I would like to point out some aspects of Article 130 of the 
Constitution. The role of the state has been historically 
defined. The state must preserve and defend national 
sovereignty, encourage and enforce just laws, and look after the 
people's general well-being. In other words, the state's role 
is more on the material side. The church's role, on the other 
hand, has to do with the people's consciences and beliefs and 
therefore is on the spiritual side. Hence, it is very important 
to have a clear separation between the activities of the state 
and the church. This is a tradition and a concept with deep 
historical roots in our country. I would like to reiterate my 
support for the amendments of Article 130 of our Constitution, 
stressing the importance of maintaining the separation, not only 
in the Constitution, but through actions, between the church and 
the state. I believe this is very important for national 
coexistence. 
  [Zabludovsky] I would like to make a pause between political 
and economic matters. Please tell us about the person named 
Ernesto Zedillo. 
  [Zedillo, laughing] Well, I am a normal person. I come from 
a large family. My mother, who died when she was relatively 
young, was born in Irapuato, Guanajuato. My father was born 
here in Mexico City in the Morelos neighborhood, between 
Sastreria and San Antonio Tomatlan. He was born and raised in a 
house that still stands. My grandmother lived there until not 
too long ago. She died the day I was appointed general manager 
of the campaign. I have two brothers and three sisters. I have 
a family, as a man of my age normally does. My wife's name is 
Patricia. We have been married almost 20 years. We met when we 
were students at the Higher Economy School. Later on I became 
her teacher. She was a good student. We got married and now 
have five children: Ernesto, Emiliano, Carlos, Linda Patricia, 
and Rodrigo. We are a normal and loving family, very united, as 
are all Mexican families. 
  [Zabludovsky] Did you say your mother passed away? 
  [Zedillo] Yes, very young. 
  [Zabludovsky] How old were you when she died? 
  [Zedillo] I was 18 or 19. It was a hard blow. 
  [Zabludovsky] Is the Morelos neighborhood north of La 
Merced? 
  [Zedillo] Yes, the house is near the former penitentiary. 
It is still there. That is where I lived as a student in 
Mexico City, in the Morelos neighborhood. 
  [Zabludovsky] Where else have you lived? 
  [Zedillo, laughing] I have lived in many houses. The list 
would be too long. We lived in Mexicali when we arrived in 
Pueblo Nuevo, which is a very dear and traditional neighborhood. 
We then moved to the newest part of the city. When I arrived 
in Mexico City I lived with my grandparents for a while in the 
Morelos neighborhood, then I moved to Jardin Balbuena. I am now 
living in La Magdalena, Contreras, where you are welcome to 
visit any time. 
  [Zabludovsky] Thank you. We gather from your biography that 
achieving the level of responsibility you have right now, 
considering your humble background, has undoubtedly required 
great tenacity. 
  [Zedillo] It has required tenacity, effort, discipline, and 
enthusiasm. It would not be fair, however, to claim all the 
credit. I believe it is the result of my own effort as well as 
the efforts of many other people. This of course includes my 
parents, who contributed with their work and through their 
example, and my family, particularly my wife, and my children 
who have always encouraged me. I must also mention my teachers. 
I always acknowledge their role, as what I learned from my 
teachers means a lot to me, particularly from those in grade 
school, high school, and at all educational levels. I always 
remember them with special affection. 
  I want to say something to those people with whom I have 
worked throughout my life and who have given me the opportunity 
to keep working and advancing in my career. I wrote this a long 
time ago in the introduction to my doctoral thesis. In the 
foreword of my thesis, I thank Mexicans because they pay the 
taxes that enable the government to open public schools, which I 
attended and 90 percent of Mexicans also attend. The resources 
from the National Council of Science and Technology [CONACYT] 
that sponsored my doctorate also belong to the Mexicans. 
Therefore, mine is not a personal endeavor; it is the result of 
the support of many people. 
  [Zabludovsky] Did you always attend public schools? 
  [Zedillo] Yes, except for my doctorate, for which I attended 
a private university. However, my doctoral degree was sponsored 
by CONACYT. 
  [Zabludovsky] As the PRI candidate, what do you expect from 
the 21 August elections? 
  [Zedillo] I expect these elections will be absolutely clean 
and will take place within a legal and peaceful framework. I 
also hope that they will be an exemplary civic event for us and 
future generations and that they result in a more united nation 
with increased confidence that will help us be a great nation. 
I hope, Mr. Zabludovsky, to win the coming elections because I 
reiterate: I want to be president of Mexico. 
  [Zabludovsky] Have you resumed the campaign that was 
interrupted by Colosio's death? 
  [Zedillo] We will be resuming it very soon. 
  [Zabludovsky] Many thanks, Dr. Zedillo. Do you have anything 
else to add? 
  [Zedillo] I only want to thank you and especially the 
viewers 
for this opportunity. 
  [Zabludovsky] This was PRI presidential candidate Ernesto 
Zedillo Ponce de Leon. Thank you. Good night.

  [Text] Mexico City, 5 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Presidents 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Rafael Angel Calderon of 
Costa Rica signed a bilateral free trade agreement in Mexico 
City. The treaty will expand their economic exchange as of 
1995. Salinas de Gortari and Calderon signed the document at a 
ceremony in Los Pinos presidential residence after the Costa 
Rican president's arrival in Mexico for a two-day visit that 
will end tomorrow. 
  Costa Rica is the first Central American country to sign a 
free trade agreement with Mexico. The latter is holding similar 
negotiations with Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, and 
Honduras. 
  "This treaty will allow a greater flow of commerce and 
investments between our countries" and will strengthen the ties 
of friendship and cooperation between Mexico and Costa Rica, 
Calderon said in a speech he gave at the event, which was also 
attended by Salinas de Gortari. Calderon said: "The 21st century 
begins for Costa Ricans" with the signing of this treaty. He 
said the agreement represents "a great step toward" Costa Rica's 
future integration into NAFTA, signed by Canada, the United 
States, and Mexico, which has been in effect since January.

  [Text] On Wednesday, 30 March, three days after the 
elections, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] announced the 
official results of the presidential election, which confirmed 
the need for a runoff between Armando Calderon Sol and Ruben 
Zamora. Only the official results of the election for deputies 
and municipal representatives are now pending. In the 
preliminary elections, the two majority forces obtained 
percentages similar to those of the presidential candidates. 
  After working for two days, the TSE finished counting the 
votes for president. According to official figures, ARENA 
[Nationalist Republican Alliance] leads with 641,108 votes, or 
49.03 percent of the total votes for president. The leftist 
coalition came in second with 325,582 votes, which represent 
24.9 percent of the total valid votes. The Christian Democratic 
Party came in third with 214,277 votes, or 16.39 percent. The 
National Conciliation Party received 70,504 votes, or 5.39 
percent. The rest of the parties won a total of 4.29 percent of 
the total number of votes for president and vice president. 
  It has also officially been reported that less than half the 
2.7 million registered voters voted on 20 March. 
  [Begin unidentified TSE official recording] The grand total 
of the voters who participated in the 20 March elections was 
1,411,320. [end recording] 
  Even so, the TSE described the election as successful. In 
addition, the TSE drafted a document saying that ARENA and the 
leftist coalition will be the only contenders in the runoff. 
  [Begin TSE official recording] These are the contenders who 
won the largest number of valid votes. Therefore, the TSE must 
be convened within the deadline stipulated by law. [end 
recording] 
  Beginning 30 March, all political parties have 72 hours to 
file challenges to the election results. If the parties do not 
do this, the TSE will declare the results valid and will call 
the runoff for 24 April.

  [Text] Jose Maria Monterrey, director of the National 
Civilian Police [PNC], reported that the U.S. officer who died 
after detonating a hand grenade that also wounded two members of 
the PNC, was under the influence of drugs. Monterrey added that 
the accident, which occurred at the PNC station in the Zacamil 
neighborhood, occurred after the officer threatened to try and 
reclaim the confiscated weapons. 
  [Begin recording] [Monterrey] They say that they arrived at 
the station after arresting the bodyguards of Colonel Rivera for 
drunken misconduct. They were firing their weapons, I believe, 
so they were arrested. They were taken to the police station. 
They said they were U.S. Embassy personnel, so we called the 
U.S. Embassy, after which the colonel arrived. We turned over 
the hand grenade and the weapons that had been confiscated from 
the two detained bodyguards. He then began to handle the 
grenade. At first they thought it was an accident. That was 
later ruled out because of the high amount of drugs involved. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The U.S. Embassy report says he 
thought it was a toy. [Words indistinct] could it be, given the 
state he was in because of the drugs, that he might have used 
the grenade to threaten those present? 
  [Monterrey] Apparently he was a little arrogant when he 
arrived. There was some of that with our people. You must 
remember that they always try to look down on our people. 
However, there is no doubt that this was caused by an excessive 
amount of drugs. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Monterrey] We are going to try and make this the highest 
amount they have ever paid in compensation. One of the boys is 
blind, and the other will lose one eye. 
  [Reporter] Are these the only wounded? 
  [Monterrey] Just these two policemen were wounded. 
Fortunately all the others fled when they saw him playing with 
the grenade in his condition. [end recording] 
  The PNC director added that they will ask for the highest 
possible compensation for the wounded policemen. It was 
reported that Col. Julio Ramon Rivera, who died in the incident, 
was a security officer at the U.S. Embassy in our country.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 5 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- The Honduran Armed 
Forces thwarted an alleged plan which would reportedly be 
executed by three Nicaraguan citizens to assassinate President 
Carlos Roberto Reina. 
  Army Spokesman Colonel Napoleon Santos announced today 
military intelligence learned about the plan after Nicaraguan 
citizens Luis Enrique Quintero, Santiago Rivas, and Roger 
Arguello entered the country on 7 March. 
  According to the high-ranking military officer, who said 
Enrique Quintero was a member of the intelligence department of 
the Sandinist People's Army (EPS), the three Nicaraguan citizens 
had planned to burn a paint factory and kidnap three businessmen.

<F P=106> [Statements by Press Director Carlos Calderon to </F>
correspondent Roberto Reyes at the Government House in 
Tegucigalpa -- live] 
  [Text] [Reporter Romulo Matamoros] According to the 
authorities, Honduran citizen Luis Hernandez Sosa and Nicaraguan 
citizen Luis Rene Quintero, who entered our country on 7 March 
through El Paraiso, are involved in an attempt against the 
president. Quintero also mentioned the names of Nicaraguan 
citizens Roger Arguello and Santiago Rivas Betancourt. They are 
reportedly in our country engaged in irregular activities 
related to drug trafficking and the illegal trafficking of 
vehicles, according to Nicaraguan officials. 
  [Station announcer] Thank you very much. We now have another 
report from the Government House. Go ahead, Raul Valladares. 
  [Valladares] Roberto Reyes is here with Carlos Calderon, 
press director of the Government House. Go ahead, Roberto. 
  [Reyes] Thank you very much. We are here with Press Director 
Carlos Calderon at the Government House. I asked Colonel Romero 
if this threat could change the president's agenda. What is 
your opinion? 
  [Calderon] We were with the president listening to the 
information broadcast by Voz de Honduras Network. Everything is 
absolutely quiet. I received reports that military intelligence 
officers had informed the president a few days ago about what 
was happening. 
  The president told me he hoped this report would not cause 
great alarm because he knows [words indistinct] state security 
organizations. He added that he did not think this incident 
would have any political significance. 
  As Col. Romero stated, these individuals were acting like 
common criminals [words indistinct]. They do not have any 
political connections. Therefore, the president expressed 
[words indistinct] with great responsibility. Despite the fact 
that the president learned of this situation days ago, the 
matter was kept secret, especially since the investigations had 
not concluded. 
  Now that the information has been made public, the president 
is quiet. He thanked those who expressed their solidarity with 
him and hoped the citizens would view this as a normal thing for 
the president. He said he hopes the incident will not alter his 
working schedule. President Reina is not worried at all about 
this situation. He knows that the state security organizations 
are efficient and that he has the support of the people. He 
knows he is a loved and respected individual. Reina is aware 
that these things can happen to any president: They are part of 
the risk of holding such an important post as the presidency of 
the Republic. 
  This will in no way affect the president's duties and 
everyday activities. 
  [Reyes] Will the president increase his security now? 
  [Calderon] State security organizations have recommended 
that 
the president take some precautions, and certain steps have been 
taken. For the president, this is no cause for alarm, and it 
will not affect his duties. He is quiet, relaxed, and will 
continue his normal activities. 
  [Reyes] Has the president downplayed the information given 
to 
him? 
  [Calderon] I wouldn't say so. I would say he has handled the 
information appropriately. He has given this report the 
attention it deserves. He has taken the recommendations made by 
state security agencies into account [words indistinct] but he 
will not change his routine and how he relates to the public. 
This does not involve a change in the president's behavior as 
head of state. 
  [Reyes] How has the president classified these actions? You 
are talking about crime, but how does he see the situation? 
  [Calderon] We have the same information supplied by state 
security organizations. When one talks about common crime, one 
implies there is no link to political groups. This is a 
unpremeditated action by a group of individuals who, for unknown 
reasons, have considered taking such actions. These actions do 
not reflect the political criteria or actions of any group, 
which would have given the problem a different look. 
  [Reyes] Has the president received calls from presidents or 
foreign officials other than the Nicaraguan Government Ministry 
official who contacted you? 
  [Calderon] No. The president has only received local calls. 
I suppose that when the news spreads, presidents of friendly 
countries will express their solidarity with the president. You 
are well aware of the enormous respect for President Reina 
throughout the continent. 
  [Reyes] What have the Armed Forces told the president? 
  [Calderon] I don't know anything about that. 
  [Reyes] Thank you very much.

  [Text] After signing an important agreement in Brussels the 
week of 28 March, Nicaragua withdrew its banana suits against 
the EU regarding the purchasing quotas and tariffs imposed by 
the EU on banana imports from Latin America. The agreement will 
benefit Nicaraguan banana exports. 
  According to reports from Belgium, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, 
Honduras, and Panama agreed not to begin any disputes within the 
framework of GATT against the 12 European banana buyers until 31 
December 2002. The agreement contemplates an increase in the 
banana purchasing quotas from 2 million tons a year to 2.2 
million tons for 1995.

  [Text] According to a report released yesterday by Robert 
Gelbard, U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American 
affairs, Panama's dollar-based economy, the existence of a free 
zone in Colon Province, loose control over the exchange of money 
and raw material, and lenient laws have made Panama vulnerable 
to drugs. 
  The report states that the Panamanian Government has not 
made 
any new, decisive efforts to curb the laundering of drug money 
in the past year, that Panamanian laws must be perfected, and 
that Panama's control organizations and resources are inadequate. 
  According to a U.S. State Department report on international 
drug trafficking presented to the U.S. Congress, a number of 
countries, including Panama, are victims of corruption fostered 
by drug traffickers. The Panamanian Government has rejected 
this accusation several times, saying that it is making all 
possible efforts. Vice President Guillermo Ford thus reacted to 
the report: 
  [Begin Ford recording] I am going to say this publicly and 
through our embassy. In 1990 the Republic of Panama issued a 
decree-law by which the Banking Commission would introduce rules 
to govern the management of cash through banks. Recently, 
through a cabinet decree, a new law was issued involving all 
assets coming into Panama through any port of entry. All 
countries are doing this. 
  Meanwhile, Panama approved the Mutual Legal Assistance 
Treaty, which has not been ratified by the U.S. Senate. I think 
that instead of criticizing and promoting the idea that Panama 
supports drug trafficking and money laundering, we should all 
work together to eradicate these two scourges. [end recording] 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. Government says that cocaine 
consumption has become a true worldwide scourge that corrupts 
and destroys lives, and it has accused Panama of lacking the 
political resolve to deal with the corruption caused by the drug. 
  [Begin Ford recording] I must say publicly that I think it 
is unfair to say that Panama is not doing enough to eradicate 
this scourge. [end recording]. 
  The State Department report asserts that drug production and 
trafficking are increasing and creating new opportunities for 
international criminals. In addition to Panama, the report 
lists Bolivia and Venezuela among the Latin American countries 
that are not making an effort to fight drug trafficking.

<F P=106> [Report by Abdiel Antonio Gutierrez from the "RPC Television </F>
News" newscast] 
  [Text] Panama will request a meeting with U.S. authorities 
at the highest level to discuss the laundering of money from the 
illegal sale of drugs. Members of the Foreign Relations Council 
held an urgent meeting with President Guillermo Endara to take a 
stand on the report issued by Robert Gelbard, assistant 
secretary of state for inter-American affairs, which describes 
our country as an important money laundering center. After a 
meeting that lasted two and a half hours, the Panamanian 
Government officially rejected the high-ranking U.S. official's 
report that Panama's efforts to combat money laundering have 
been small. 
  [Begin Foreign Minister Jose Mulino recording] We will also 
request a meeting at the highest level of the U.S. Government to 
discuss the drug issue. This issue must be broached, not only 
in regard to Panama, but also with respect to the United States, 
which is the country that consumes this product the most. [end 
recording] 
  He added that the Panamanian Government does not intend to 
argue the issue but wants to begin a constructive dialogue to 
correct possible errors in the management of the money 
laundering problem. 
  [Begin Mulino recording] Those issues do not stay at a 
bilateral level. It is offensive and denigrating for our 
country to be identified as one of the world's principal money 
laundering centers. [end recording] 
  The foreign minister announced that he will send Panama's 
official statement on the matter to U.S. officials early next 
week. In his opinion, the report tarnishes the country's image 
among nations.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 Apr (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
confirmed on 4 April "the diplomatic method" to recover the 
Malvinas Islands. Nevertheless, he hardened his stance compared 
with past years by reminding the "usurpers" that the Argentine 
soldiers who died in the 1982 war "are resting in our 
fatherland's soil." 
  Menem paid "tribute to these young men who said yes to our 
fatherland" and fell in that conflict with the United Kingdom 12 
years ago. He stressed: "Even though these usurpers hate the 
idea, these young men still are resting in our fatherland's 
soil." 
  The president made these remarks in a message of strong 
emotional content. His message was apparently aimed at again 
"Malvinizing" ["malvinizar"] society 12 years after the war 
against the British during a ceremony at the 1st Regiment 
Patricios. 
  The ceremony was attended by veterans groups from the South 
Atlantic war and their relatives. Menem personally greeted them 
-- shaking their hands -- after his speech. 
  Continuous drizzle on the regiment, headquartered in Palermo 
District, forced it to reduce the ceremony and hold it at the 
regiment's ceremonial hall, where forces and standard bearers 
from the three branches of the Armed Forces and security forces, 
as well as various war veterans groups, were lined up. 
  At the main rostrum, Menem was accompanied by Defense 
Minister Oscar Camilion, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, Joint 
Chief of Staff Mario Candido Diaz, Army Chief of Staff Martin 
Balza, Navy Chief of Staff Enrique Molina Pico, and Air Force 
Chief of Staff Juan Paulik. 
  On the ceremonial hall's first floor, designed for special 
guests, were Buenos Aires Mayor Saul Bouer; General Mario 
Benjamin Menendez, the former Malvinas military governor; 
Justicialist Deputy Erman Gonzalez; Jorge Isaac Anaya, a former 
member of the military junta that invaded the islands; former 
Army Chiefs of Staff Hector Rios Erenu and Jorge Harguindeguy; 
and PAMI [Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan] President 
Matilde Menendez, the Peronist Party's No. 2 candidate for 
Constituent Assembly member from Buenos Aires. 
  The ceremony started with the national anthem, after which a 
religious ceremony was held to pay tribute to the soldiers who 
fell in the military conflict. 
  Gen. Diaz spoke afterward. He also sorted out the diplomatic 
method as a recourse to recover sovereignty over the islands. 
Gen. Diaz said: "All of us will proclaim today to all and 
sundry that the Malvinas Islands belong to us de facto and de 
jure." 
  Diaz concluded by saying: "I am sure that, using this 
method, the day will come when this flag, devised by [Argentine 
independence hero] General [Manuel] Belgrano, will again and 
definitely fly over our Malvinas Islands." 
  For his part, Menem said we Argentines "have been claiming 
in 
every way and using every method available to us the restoration 
of this mutilated part of our fatherland to our territory." 
  Menem pointed out: "This is the goal to be achieved, a goal 
that we are not giving up and will not give up." He stressed: 
"This goal represents a projection of the Argentine people's 
soul and spirit." 
  Menem emphasized: "A war may be waged not only through 
military conflicts, but also through diplomacy, talks, 
agreements, and conversations." 
  Moving on, Menem stressed that he does not harbor "the 
slightest doubt that the Argentine Government's and people's 
attitude of using diplomatic methods will unfailingly lead us to 
the recovery of this part of our land that has been clumsily 
mutilated." 
  He emphasized: "This basically represents a tribute to these 
war veterans who said yes to our fatherland in our remote 
southern sea. This is a tribute to many of those present here 
who returned to our fatherland and to those who were unable to 
return. Nevertheless, even though these usurpers hate the idea, 
these young men are still resting in our fatherland's soil."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 Apr (NA) -- Interior Minister Carlos

intervention in Jujuy Province "for now." 
  Ruckauf said: "The situation in Jujuy is very complex, but 
it 
is not a province with structural problems. Therefore, for now, 
there will be no federal measures." 
  The minister made these remarks shortly before attending a 
dinner that Carlos Corach, the Justicialist Party's No. 1 
candidate for Constituent Assembly member for the federal 
capital, hosted for 600 entrepreneurs at the Alvear Palace Hotel 
in this capital.

  [Text] Fernando Cajias, a leader of the Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left, MIR, has accused the U.S. Government of 
plotting to destroy social democracy -- not just in Bolivia, but 
in the whole world. 
  [Begin Cajias recording] The point is that now the cold war 
is over and communism has fallen to pieces, social democracy is 
the only rival for the liberals. I believe there is an 
international plan to eliminate social democracy worldwide. [end 
recording] 
  As far as Bolivia is concerned, Cajias claimed the anti-MIR 
campaign linking his party to drug traffickers -- which is being 
orchestrated by the current Bolivian Administration and the U.S. 
Embassy in Bolivia -- has succeeded in removing from [former 
President] Jaime Paz Zamora his status as a national leader. 
  [Begin recording] [Cajias] As you probably know, a survey 
was 
done at the end of last year. It showed that Jaime Paz Zamora 
was regaining popularity. Thus, it was the right time to take 
advantage of circumstances and prevent this from happening. We 
are perfectly aware mistakes have been made, as the president of 
the party personally acknowledged. These mistakes have cost us 
dearly but we will not give up politics. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Will the MIR survive as it is or 
will 
it have to be reborn? 
  [Cajias] I believe this has thwarted many hopes, many people 
have ceased to believe in us, and even our militants are greatly 
demoralized. It would be worse, however, to abandon all our 
hopes. [end recording] 
  Asked about drug trafficker Isaac Chavarria's latest 
disclosures, Cajias answered that the next stage of the 
investigation -- during which those he has accused will testify 
-- will show who were actually involved in trafficking.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero by </F>
Washington correspondent Paulo Sotero; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Sotero] When you take the oath as finance minister, 
whether you like it or not, you assume the role of a decisive 
voter in the presidential dispute. Traditionally, the 
government spends money during election years to help its 
favorite candidate. Will this happen during your tenure? 
  [Ricupero] I want first to make it absolutely clear that I 
will play an entirely impartial role. I am a public servant. I 
have devoted my whole life to this. I may have my preferences 
as a citizen, but as finance minister I will keep in mind 
collective and public interests which are today embodied in 
economic stabilization. As I said earlier in some articles, I 
believe this is in the best interests of all of the candidates 
too. Anyone seeking a federal or state office will win if he 
gets elected when the economy is already at an advanced stage of 
stabilization. If there is no awareness of this fact, those 
elected will have to rule under the excessively heavy burden of 
an economy out of control. 
  [Sotero] Will government coffers continue to be locked? 
  [Ricupero] The government has clearly defined its position 
on 
spending: It will seek a strict balance between public accounts 
and the federal budget. The budget is both small and behind 
schedule. Many sectors will suffer hardships, but the budget was 
prepared along those lines. It is important for it to be 
approved so that clear guidelines may be established for the 
administration, and to enable it to be rigorously implemented. 
We only need the budget to ensure the success of the program. 
The budget will be the law for the government. This will 
preclude any possible use of it for electoral purposes. 
  [Sotero] Do you attach any significance to the fact that it 
was [Former Finance Minister] Fernando Henrique Cardoso who 
proposed your appointment to President Franco? 
  [Ricupero] I am a friend of Cardoso. I will not say that 
this is meaningless, because I am honored by his proposing me. 
This will be very important in ensuring the continuity of the 
plan. I fully endorse the plan. 
  [Sotero] Do you have any doubt about achieving fiscal 
adjustment with the measures adopted thus far? Is it a question 
of just implementing them? 
  [Ricupero] I believe fiscal adjustment has been basically 
achieved. We have to formalize it through the approval of the 
budget. It would have been better if the original Social 
Emergency Fund proposal had been approved. Unfortunately, it 
was not possible to have it approved without changes. Even so, 
we can achieve fiscal balance with what we have. New decisions, 
like salary changes for personnel of other branches of 
government, would make this goal more difficult. These expenses 
are not included in the budget. This is why I have insisted on 
the need for a final solution to these structural problems in 
the Constitution itself, whose provisions have led to salary 
differences among the branches of government and to decisions 
that provoked new problems. All this must be addressed with a 
desire to promote harmonious coexistence among the three 
branches. I have never addressed this problem without observing 
absolute respect for the Supreme Court, for the judicial branch, 
and for Congress, while bearing in mind the aim of their 
members, as Brazilians, to reach stability. We have to address 
the causes of these problems. If we find that the present legal 
system jeopardizes stability and that the country is thus 
finding it difficult to bring inflation under control, then the 
current constitutional revision process, which still has two 
months of sessions, should focus on this problem. There is no 
reason why we should not to try to improve those constitutional 
provisions. 
  [Sotero] In the wake of your appointment, it has been 
speculated that you might have problems because you will not 
enjoy the same type of relationship Cardoso had with President 
Franco. 
  [Ricupero] I am glad you mentioned that. I maintain very 
harmonious relations with the president and with members of his 
staff. I am a close friend of all of them. I am on very good 
terms with Henrique Hargreaves, who was my colleague during 
[Former President Jose] Sarney's government; and with 
[Presidency Secretary General] Mauro Durante, who helped me the 
most when I was appointed minister for the Amazon region. 
Besides, I have my own staff at Planalto Palace, whom I intend 
to keep with the president's concurrence. I am a close friend 
of Jose Castro Ferreira and the other presidential advisers: 
Osiris Lopes is a longstanding friend. I am also on good terms 
with the members of Cardoso's team, and I feel one of them 
because they are all longstanding friends. Thus, I cannot see 
any incompatibility, and I feel I will be able to move smoothly 
from one position to another. 
  [Sotero] Do you find it necessary to adjust the plan? 
  [Ricupero] I do not see any flaw in the plan. Respected 
economists like Mario Henrique Simonsen have praised the plan 
and have described the concept behind it as excellent. The 
issues we will have to address from now on will be focused on 
how to translate all this into our daily life. As the American 
saying goes: "The devil is in the details." Details have not 
yet been worked out. One cannot speak of adjustments, because 
this means correcting the plan, which would not be the case. As 
scheduled, we will now define all the financial, economic, and 
legal rules for the transition into the real cruzeiro. This 
process, which is now under way, requires an enormous amount of 
work. The legal side alone poses intricate issues. By 
arranging the transfer of office on 5 April, Cardoso and I will, 
in our speeches, touch on certain general guidelines for the 
next stage -- although still in very general terms -- because it 
is still in the preparatory stage. 
  [Sotero] Has a date been set for the change of currency? 
  [Ricupero] No. This is one of the topics under discussion, 
not just by the team but by the president and members of the 
government, because we need to find a point of equilibrium. We 
can neither be hasty nor wait for too long. This is not an easy 
task. It requires fine tuning with economic developments. The 
only firm information is that which has already been announced; 
that is, that the date for the implementation of the new 
currency will be announced 35 days in advance. Thus, no one 
will be taken by surprise. 
  [Sotero] Do you have a date in mind? 
  [Ricupero] You know I am not inclined to lie. Whenever I 
cannot tell something to the press, I state my reasons. The 
issue here is not that I cannot disclose a conversion date, 
written on a piece of paper, that is being kept in a safe. The 
truth is that no date has been set. 
  [Sotero] Does the same rule apply to the various exchange 
rates of the new currency? Does the internal debate indicate 
that the government is moving toward a fixed rate or a system of 
levels? How will the question of convertibility of the new 
currency be resolved? 
  [Ricupero] Those possibilities are being duly assessed, one 
in relation to the other. There has yet been no definition. I 
hope that by early next week the economic team will give me some 
paragraphs on the general characteristics of stage three of the 
plan. One thing I have sharply emphasized is that I will first 
examine any proposal brought to me by the team and then take it 
to the president. I want to do everything in absolute agreement 
with him, just as Cardoso used to do. 
  [Sotero] Is Brazil prepared to end inflation? 
  [Ricupero] I believe Brazilian society is mature enough to 
undertake the final effort toward stabilization and reform with 
a view to resuming development. People are weary of inflation 
and hope the country will find its course. There are still some 
problems stemming from our political institutions and 
constitutional provisions. I believe our objective economic 
conditions are good. We did not have these conditions during the 
previous transition period in 1989. We have a high level of 
reserves that enable the Central Bank to overcome any 
speculative maneuvers. We have concluded our foreign debt 
negotiations. In a few more days, the foreign debt will be a 
finished business. Furthermore, contrary to the situation 
prevailing a few years ago, our economy grew in 1993 and 
continues to grow in 1994. This has brought us relief. This 
growth has been achieved through an extremely high productivity 
rate. Our agricultural harvest could be the largest ever 
because the Northeastern region again figures for statistical 
purposes and companies have been streamlined. The rate of 
indebtedness within the private sector is currently the one of 
the lowest in the world. I believe the subjective conditions 
influencing business and workers confidence are equally good. 
There are also favorable international economic conditions 
because there has been an acceleration in the U.S. growth with 
reasonable interest rates, and there are signs of an economic 
recovery in Europe. All these point in a positive direction. 
All that is required now is to be very firm in the subject of 
balancing the budget and of improving our constitutional 
provisions.

<F P=106> [Article by Lucia Helena Gazzola] </F>
  [Excerpts] The immediate objective of the PT [Workers 
Party] is to attract the support of former Rio de Janeiro 
Governor Leonel Brizola (PDT) [Democratic Labor Party] in order 
to win the presidential election in the first round. This move 
seeks to confront the broad alliance being created around the 
candidacy of former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. This was the 
main issue on the agenda of the PT national executive board 
meeting with Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's campaign coordinating 
board in Sao Paulo yesterday. 
  PT leaders are scared and do not want to waste time. They 
want to create in Brasilia today -- during a meeting of the 
parties allied to the PT -- a commission headed by Lula and PSB 
[Brazilian Socialist Party] President Miguel Arraes to talk with 
Brizola. They are even hinting of offering the vice presidency 
to the PDT. "We have an agreement with the PSB, but if the PDT 
joins the front we will reevaluate the matter," Lula admitted. 
[passage omitted] 
  During the middle of last week, PT Vice President Aloizio 
Mercadante said an alliance with Brizola "was not at all 
viable," but yesterday he was considering inviting the former 
governor to attend the next meeting of parties that support the 
PT -- which until now just included the PC do B [Communist Party 
of Brazil] and the PSB. "We want to broaden the scope of the 
next meeting by inviting Brizola and other left-wing leaders, 
and intellectuals and artists." The date for such a meeting 
will be announced in Brasilia today. PT Secretary General 
Gilberto Carvalho said that on Tuesday [not further specified], 
he and another of Lula's other trusted men, government program 
coordinator Marco Aurelio Garcia, met with a PDT legislator and 
one of Brizola's assistants in Rio to discuss the possibility of 
meeting with the governor to ask him for his support.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- Former Governor Leonel Brizola 
(PDT) [Democratic Labor Party] has ruled out any possibility of 
an alliance with the PT [Workers Party] during the first or 
second round of the presidential elections. "An agreement with 
the current PT leadership is not viable," said Brizola, adding 
that he believes Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's candidacy is being 
artificially inflated by the surveys. "No one believes in the 39 
percent he is allegedly getting because that is what he obtained 
in the 1989 runoff election." 
  Regarding the possibility of an alliance with other parties, 
Brizola -- who yesterday lunched with Minas Gerais Governor 
Helio Garcia (PTB) [Brazilian Labor Party] at the Commercial 
Association of Rio de Janeiro -- said the only alliance already 
signed by the PDT is with the small National Mobilization Party 
(PMN). The former governor said a coalition with the PTB is a 
"natural" possibility. Regarding speculation that he would meet 
with PPR leaders, Brizola said: "Traditional politicians do not 
like me because they know I favor change and if I win the race I 
would end political chicanery." 
  Brizola resigned on 2 April to run in this year's elections. 
He said he was satisfied with what he did during his term, 
adding that no other governor did more. "They may have equaled 
me, at best," Brizola said. At the time the PDT governor left 
the government, he had the lowest popularity rate for any 
governor in the country. He was undecided whether to run for 
president or for the Senate. He said: "I am attracted to 
participate in the national campaign," adding: "This will be my 
last and greatest campaign. I will use all my accumulated 
experience."

<F P=106> [Article: "Obstacle Race," by Marcelo Bauer] </F>
  [Text] Ever since early February, when he publicly 
announced his intention to run for the presidency of Brazil, 
former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia has been busy rounding 
up support. In the space of three weeks he has met with his 
party's executive board and with the federal, state, and 
municipal delegations of PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party] legislators, received mayors in his office, gone to Rio 
de Janeiro to talk to Mayor Cesar Maia, and launched a furious 
series of attacks against some of his principal adversaries. On 
Wednesday 2 March, Quercia will participate in the first big 
public event of his campaign, a party thrown in Sao Paulo by the 
Paulista Association of Cities. The former governor says he has 
been encouraged by all these gatherings. His strategy at the 
moment probably is to build up some important grass-roots 
support in the various states. Except at the meetings he 
sponsors, however, all Quercia is collecting are problems. 
  Within the PMDB, the former governor faces opposition from 
the national leadership, which is dreaming of creating a 
National Salvation Front--uniting the PMDB, the PSDB [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party], the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], and 
part of the PFL [Liberal Front Party]--and watching the 
maneuvers leading to the launching of a presidential candidacy 
by current Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho. 
Meanwhile, in the courts, Quercia will have to testify and 
probably attend the proceedings concerning the legality of an 
importation of equipment from Israel that occurred during his 
administration, but which might also hurt Fleury. "For now, the 
status of his candidacy is still complicated," a 
quercista delegate admitted. 
  When he decided to run, Quercia knew he would have trouble 
winning the support of some factions of his party, like the Rio 
Grande do Sul group headed by Senator Pedro Simon, the leader of 
the Itamar government, and by former Social Security Minister 
Antonio Britto. It was also inevitable that this exposure as a 
candidate would swell the wave of accusations aimed at tying 
Quercia to charges of corruption and unexplained wealth. In his 
favor he has a history of four victorious campaigns that, like 
this one, also started at pretty close to zero. A rundown of the 
recent exciting days for the PMDB shows that although Quercia 
gained ground with his aggressive style, the constraints on his 
candidacy also grew. Led by Deputy Mauro Miranda (Goias), two 
dozen PMDB legislators from six states met in the Chamber on 23 
February to propose an anti-Quercia front. "If Quercia is the 
candidate, it will be practically impossible to unite the 
party," argued the party's leader in the Chamber, Tarcisio 
Delgado (Minas Gerais). That same day, Fleury was parading 
around Brasilia with the air of a candidate. In the morning, he 
met with President Itamar Franco, accompanied by the 
administration's leader in the Chamber, Luiz Carlos Santos, the 
governor's leading campaign strategist. In the afternoon, he 
lunched with Senator Jose Sarney (PMDB, Amapa) and greeted party 
legislators and leaders at the Hotel Naoum. In the evening, he 
met with deputies from several states at the offices of the PMDB 
leadership in the Chamber. "Most of the PMDB would very much 
like to see Governor Fleury's name on the list of the ones 
around which the party will have to make a decision," Britto 
announced. "Between Quercia and Fleury, I'm for Fleury," Simon 
advised. 
  Suspicious of the sudden interest in his candidacy displayed 
by old internal enemies, Fleury reacted cautiously. "I am not 
going to be the instrument of a party breakup," he promised. 
Deputies from the Sao Paulo PMDB do not rule out the possibility 
that behind the virtual support for the candidacy of the present 
governor is an attempt to isolate Quercia and force him to 
withdraw from the race, which would favor either an alliance 
with the PSDB or the emergence of a Britto candidacy. For all 
these reasons, although he is not ruling out a run for Planalto 
Palace, Fleury is still cautious in his statements. "I am not 
announcing a candidacy. I think it is important to work for 
party unity," he said. On the same day when he met in Brasilia 
with members of the party who oppose Quercia, Fleury telephoned 
the former governor to schedule a meeting. He wanted to tell 
Quercia that he did not plan to join any group that would 
exclude him from the negotiation. Quercia claimed that his 
schedule was full and postponed the meeting. 
  Irritated by the indecisiveness of his political godson, 
Quercia toughened his rhetoric against the governor. "Fleury's 
base in Sao Paulo supports me. If he announces his candidacy, he 
will be betraying both his electorate and me." Fleury reacted. 
"No one who wants my support should make a statement like that." 
The feud between the two is just part of the rhetorical duel 
promoted by the various PMDB groups and by the party's 
adversaries (see box). With his sharp candidate's tongue, 
Quercia has revived the "If you hit, you'll get hit" 
[bateu, levou] style of Collor's former spokesman, 
Claudio Humberto Rosa e Silva. Quercia's main targets, since he 
announced his candidacy, have been PT [Workers Party] President 
Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, tucanos Mario Covas, 
candidate for the governorship of Sao Paulo and Ciro Gomes, 
governor of Ceara, and fellow peemedebistas Pedro 
Simon and Antonio Britto. "The PSDB has this watered-down 
campaign. I'm going to start up the quercista 
bulldozer and roll right over all of them," Quercia promised. 
"He's talking about bulldozers because he is the candidate of 
the construction contractors," responded Covas, repeating a 
pronouncement by PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] Senator 
Esperidiao Amin (Santa Catarina). The shouting match has been 
loud enough to worry Governor Fleury. "We need to stop these 
assaults among leaders," he argued. "Internal disputes are 
healthy when they do not create splits." 
  There is speculation in the Sao Paulo PMDB that the 
launching 
of Quercia's candidacy was due to the need to nip in the bud a 
move by the top leadership to forge an alliance, for the first 
round of the elections, with the PSDB. "If they were to reach 
this agreement for the presidential race, they would also 
abandon Quercia in his effort to become governor of Sao Paulo 
and would back Mario Covas instead," said Deputy Roberto 
Rollemberg, president of the Sao Paulo PMDB. Rollemberg said 
that "by announcing for the presidency, Quercia torpedoed the 
accord." There is still talk about setting up that National 
Salvation Front, although the chances of an agreement during the 
first round are remote. A month ago, in a conversation with Rio 
Governor Leonel Brizola (PDT), PMDB President Luiz Henrique 
suggested a pact under which the PMDB, PSDB, and PDT could unite 
around whichever name ranks highest in the polls in May, when 
the conventions must indicate their candidates for president. 
Witnessed by two pedetistas and two 
peemedebistas, the conversation went even further. 
"My name is on the list, but it is not an obstacle to anything," 
said Brizola, according to what one of the witnesses told ISTOE. 
"I am tired of falling on my sword." After Carnival ended, the 
PFL wing that is headed by party President Jorge Bornhausen also 
came onto the dance floor. Brizola, Luiz Henrique, Bornhausen, 
and Tasso Jereissati, of the PMDB, now have 60 days to agree on 
this mutual plan that would result in a single candidate, a 
left-of-center anti-Lula. 
  Formation of the National Salvation Front would seem to be 
the only alternative to the increasingly unlikely candidacy of 
Deputy Antonio Britto. On Sunday the 6th, he will take part in 
the PMDB pre-convention that will nominate the candidate for the 
governorship of Rio Grande do Sul. He is running against Deputy 
Mendes Ribeiro and should garner 80 percent of the votes of 
those in attendance. Britto entered the state campaign in 
earnest in this past month. Two weeks ago in Vacaria, for 
example, he outlined his timetable to the party's municipal 
leadership. "I know there are a lot of people here who would 
vote for me for president," the former minister said. "I really 
will need your votes for president--but not in 1994. Now I want 
your votes for the governorship of Rio Grande do Sul," he said. 
Britto claims he wants to govern his state and not run for 
president until later. But not everyone in the PMDB is convinced 
of this. 
  Not only is he criticized by his party, but Quercia still 
has 
problems in court. On Monday the 28th, Governor Fleury will have 
a golden opportunity to either add to his predecessor's problems 
or lend him a helping hand. At 1600 in Brasilia, Fleury will 
testify in the case that is looking into an allegedly improper 
purchase of equipment from Israel. The testimony will be given 
in the chambers of Judge Costa Leite in the Superior Court of 
Justice (STJ) in Brasilia, at a closed-door hearing witnessed 
only by a federal prosecutor. Quercia is supposed to testify on 
Friday the 4th. If the inquiry ends in March, Costa Leite can 
still present the case against the former governor at the 
Special Court in April. This panel of 21 members of the STJ 
would judge Quercia. "At any rate, the case will go to trial," a 
court staffer said. "All that remains to be done is for Judge 
Costa Leite to conclude the case." In the event he is convicted, 
Quercia would lose the right to run for any public office in 
this year's elections. If acquitted, he would have an extra 
trump card to use in the attempt to discredit the charges 
against him, but it would not prevent his opponents from 
exploiting the issue.

<H5>  "If You Hit, You'll Get Hit" </H5>
  Here are some quotes from the rhetorical contest between 
Quercia and his opponents: 
  "If he announces his candidacy, he will be betraying both 
his 
electorate and me." (Quercia, on Fleury) 
  "No one who wants my support should make a statement like 
that." (Fleury, in response) 
  "I'm going to start up the quercista bulldozer and 
roll right over all of them." (Quercia, on the PSDB) 
  "He's talking about bulldozers because he is the candidate 
of 
the construction contractors." (Mario Covas, in response) 
  "I'm going to put that guy in jail. From the governor's 
mansion right into the clink." (Quercia, on Ciro Gomes) 
  "That's what he hopes to see--himself and those other 
thieves 
running around loose and the good guys in jail." (Ciro Gomes, in 
response) 
  "The candidate of the Right is Lula, along with his fascist 
party." (Quercia, on Lula) 
  "Quercia is using Gestapo methods." (Lula, in response)

  [Text] The computer diskettes seized by the District 
Attorney's Office reveal that since at least January 1990, still 
during Moreira Franco's administration, the civil and military 
police leadership were on the payroll of the numbers game 
kingpins. Until now the main police precincts subordinate to 
the General Department of Specialized Police [DGPE] have been 
included on this monthly payroll. There was money enough for 
the capital's precincts, as well as for those in Baixada 
Fluminense [region of poor satellite towns on the outskirts of 
the capital] and in the interior of Rio de Janeiro State. In 
addition, money was given to the Military Police [PM] barracks 
and to some sectors of the Federal Police. 
  According to the illegal game accounting, the Civil Police 
leadership have their monthly earning ensured. The list is so 
well detailed that it includes all the police inspectors who 
have occupied important positions in the Police Secretariat. 
  Under Secretary Joel Vieira, for example, had his name 
included up to October 1993, when he left his position and was 
replaced by Police Inspector Frederico Henning. Inspectors 
Paulo Emilio (former director of the capital's General Police 
Department, who was replaced by Jorge Mario Gomes), and Elson 
Campello (former DGPE director who was replaced by Marta Rocha) 
are also included on the list. 
  Rocha's name is not included on the payroll, but the main 
police organization is included under the acronym DPE [expansion 
unknown]. The name of the former DGPE chief of staff, Inaldo 
Santana, is also on the list. Other inspectors who have 
occupied important positions in the Civil Police, such as Helio 
Vigio, Antonio Nonato da Costa, Roberto de Castro, and Mauro 
Magalhaes, were included on the list next to the amounts they 
allegedly received from the illegal game kingpins. 
  PM Colonels Anani, Arouca, and Lages, in addition to the 
members of the PM Public Relations Department and of the 
operations nucleus, are mentioned on the list of those who 
received bribes.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The Finance Ministry announced late in 
the afternoon on 30 March that it managed to reach an agreement 
to sign contracts to reschedule the debts of the states and 60 
percent of the municipalities that owe money to the government. 
With this step, the federal government concludes the internal 
debt renegotiation process that began in 1991; reestablished the 
repayment flow between the federal government, the states, and 
municipalities; and ensured that the contracted debt -- which 
amounts to $23 billion -- will be paid in 20 years. 
  As payment guarantee the federal government will receive 
quotas from the states' and municipalities' Participation Funds 
besides their own budgets. Eleven states and many municipalities 
signed their debt rescheduling contract on 30 March. They are: 
Goias, Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro, Para, Tocantins, 
Rondonia, Roraima, Amazonas, Parana, Rio Grande do Norte, and 
Acre. The official deadline to sign the contracts is 7 April, 
but the federal government made an effort in the past few days 
to have them all signed by 1 April because with the inclusion of 
the new month, all the calculations would have to be redone. 
  The municipalities that have few debts may perhaps still be 
able to reschedule them before the final deadline, given that 
their main creditor, the Federal Savings Bank (CEF), is updating 
their debts and interest based on 1 April. 
  The capitals that already had signed debt rescheduling 
contracts by 30 March were: Maceio, Goiania, Campo Grande, 
Porto Alegre, Natal, Sao Luis, Rio Branco, Cuiaba, Fortaleza, 
and Belo Horizonte. 
  According to federal government experts, the big absence in 
the list is the city of Sao Paulo. 
  According to the national Treasury, only $8.3 billion out of 
a total $23 billion in debt had been renegotiated by 28 February 
-- that is, just seven municipalities had rescheduled their 
debts out of a total of 200 municipalities. 
  The reestablishment of the repayment flow will mainly 
benefit 
the CEF, which is the greatest creditor of states and 
municipalities. Out of the $8.3 billion renegotiated by the end 
of February, 85.4 percent is debts contracted with the CEF. 
Government experts believe the CEF will be able to grant more 
credits now that it has the guarantee of repayment by its 
debtors.

  [Text] An auditing study that the National Accounting 
Office (TCU) made of Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc. has 
detected differences, amounting to billions of dollars, between 
the figures reported by Furnas and the real cost of construction 
of Brazilian nuclear power plants, especially Angra-2. The 
report, which raises objections to the figures released by 
Furnas, remained shelved for months within the TCU. Its 
conclusions could destroy the executive branch's reasons for 
justifying the decision to continue with the construction of the 
plant. 
  The auditing study reveals, for example, that Angra-2 has so 
far cost $5 billion, according to the most reliable 
calculations. This figure is more than three times the amount 
that Furnas has officially declared to have spent since 1977 -- 
$1.7 billion. 
  The TCU report also concluded that the estimates of the 
investment that is necessary for concluding the project are not 
reliable. It is expected that the plant will call for 
investments that are higher than the cost of a hydroelectric 
plant with the same generation capacity of 1,300 megawatts. 
  Based on the results of the auditing study, the Greenpeace 
environmentalist organization will request suspension of 
construction of the plant. "Angra-2 accounts have been revealed 
for the first time," says Greenpeace leader Rui de Goes. He 
remarked that the auditing confirms the theses of 
nongovernmental organizations which are against the nuclear 
program. 
  The TCU document has not only challenged the credibility of 
Furnas, but has also cast doubts over the accounts of the entire 
electric power sector. It says that in the face of the 
estimated cost, "nuclear energy is not competitive in Plan 
2015," which was prepared by Eletrobras [Brazilian Electric 
Power Company Inc.]. "With the most pessimistic hypothesis, 
thermal power will not be competitive with hydroelectric power 
until 2005," the TCU report says, noting that the nuclear option 
is the most expensive thermal power generation alternative. 
  "For FURNAS, building a hydroelectric power plant or a 
nuclear power plant makes no difference, because the Union 
subsidizes the cost of nuclear energy," the TCU report says. 
Based on this report, the $5 billion that has already been 
spent, plus the $2.3 billion that is necessary for completion of 
the project, amounts to $7.3 billion for the total cost of 
Angra-2. 
  The limit for Furnas spending on the construction of Angra-2 
corresponds to the amount that would be spent on a hydroelectric 
power plant of the same size -- of approximately 1,300 
megawatts. This would mean an investment of $1.2 billion for 
Furnas. The Treasury must supply the remaining $6.1 billion, 
which amounts to two minimum salaries for each Brazilian family. 
  These figures, however, could be even larger. The TCU 
auditing did not estimate the financial expenses included in the 
construction of the plant. In the case of Angra, they account 
for 40 percent of the cost. For its part, Eletrobras has other 
estimates of the cost for completion of the project. It 
estimates that $2 billion is necessary for completion of the 
project. 
  The TCU auditing study also has doubts about those 
estimates. 
"Angra-2 cost estimates should be considered cautiously." The 
report recalls the case of Angra-1, "whose cost was estimated at 
$319 million, but which turned out to be several times higher." 
  The conclusions of the TCU concerning Angra-1 accounts are 
equally devastating. The auditors estimated the cost at $3.9 
billion, noting that this figure "affords a new base for 
calculation of the cost-benefit ratio for Angra-1," adding that 
this project "has obviously contradicted the terms of the 
economy-efficacy- efficiency trinomial." Angra-1 has been 
disconnected for one year, after a radioactive leak in the 
cooling system caused by a deficiency in the nuclear fuel rods.

<F P=106> [Article: "End of the Diet," by Jayme Brener and Flavio </F>
Pachalski, with contributions from Helio Contreiras in Rio 
Janeiro] 
  [Text] The Army's lean years--during the Collor de Mello 
administration there wasn't even enough money to feed the 
troops--seem to be nearing an end. At least this is what we 
infer from the plans announced last week by Army Minister 
Zenildo de Lucena during a lecture at the Army General Staff 
School (Eceme) in Rio de Janeiro. According to the minister, 
this year the Army will get $200 million to purchase weapons and 
equipment. The money is part of the $800 million that the 
government is supposed to inject into the Army's bank accounts 
over a four-year period. "We will not be able to leap into total 
modernization, but we will get up out of the bottom of the pit 
where we have been since the Collor administration," an official 
who attended the Eceme lecture told ISTOE. 
  The military command's idea is to split this year's $200 
million into two parts. Half will be used--on the domestic 
market--to buy personal equipment, such as helmets. The other 
half will be spent on armaments imports. One of the stars of the 
transaction will be the purchase of fifty 105mm guns, the Light 
Gun model made by the British firm Royal Ordnance that was used 
in the Falklands War (1982) and the Gulf War (1991). Four units 
had already been bought by the Army last year. Each gun costs 
between $800,000 and $1.2 million and has a maximum range of 24 
km, twice that of the American M-101's, the venerable survivors 
of World War II that the Army now uses. Interest in the Light 
Guns goes way back, but the military budget squeeze led the 
government to make the purchase of the guns conditional on 
extremely favorable financing over a 10-year period. Of course 
the purchase did not go through. 
  But, attention! The deal with Royal Ordnance does not 
involve 
merely a potential arms purchase. "We are dreaming big," said 
General Armando Paiva Chaves, president of War Materiel Industry 
of Brazil (IMBEL). "We see this as a long-term relationship," a 
spokesman for the British company told ISTOE in London. Royal 
Ordnance has long-term experience--400 years of it, since it 
descended from the first British weapons factories. Its 
approaches to the Brazilian army gained new energy in 1991. The 
company is aiming high; it wants to retire a good part of 
Brazil's approximately 570 old 105mm guns, as well as some 155mm 
guns. 
  The British firm and the Brazilian military really embraced 
each other in 1992, when they formed the joint venture known as 
South America Ordnance. There are three partners, with equal 
shares: Imbel, the Schahyn Cury group and, of course, Royal 
Ordnance. The objective is to use Brazilian influence in Latin 
America to market British weapons. On the other hand, Royal 
Ordnance's worldwide network would enable Imbel to expand its 
business. The joint venture is exporting about $10 million every 
year in munitions. One of its customers is the Philippines. 
Malaysia and Thailand are likely to follow. All this is very 
hush-hush, according to a golden rule of the explosive world of 
the arms trade. On Wednesday, when the Brazilian military 
command was already rubbing its palms together in contented 
anticipation of the new Light Guns, Lenio Zimmer, director of 
South America Ordnance, was denying that the transaction had 
occurred. "We are only concerned with the technical part, we 
have nothing to do with the commercial aspects," was the 
justification he gave later. 
  There are some who say that the marriage between Royal 
Ordnance and the Brazilian Army is destined to fly even higher. 
For example, there could be an agreement that would write a 
happy ending to the soap opera of the bankrupt Engesa 
[Specialized Engineers, Inc.], the manufacturer of a good part 
of the Army's vehicles and tanks. That and any other flight 
would probably have as takeoff point the willingness of the 
Brazilian Government to beef up the military budget. The $200 
million installment that is expected to be received by December, 
it is well to remember, was promised for 1993.

  [Text] Beijing, 5 Par (EFE) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister 
Celso Amorim said here on 5 April that Brazil prefers dialogue 
to the imposition of sanctions on the DPRK because of its 
alleged nuclearization for military purposes. 
  The minister thus replied to a question asked by an EFE 
journalist on a request that U.S. officials made today in 
Brazil, asking this country to cooperate with an eventual 
imposition of sanctions on the DPRK if it refuses to engage in 
dialogue and does not follow the UN recommendations in this 
regard. 
  Amorim explained that developing nuclear weapons is not 
favorable to the DPRK's interest, but demanded prudence on the 
subject, noting that this would give more credibility to the 
United Nations, and adding that the Chinese position on the 
subject is "very constructive." 
  In response to another question asked by the EFE reporter on 
Beijing's opinion on the expansion of the UN Security Council, 
and -- in a such case -- about the possibility of Brazil 
occupying one of the new positions as a standing council member, 
Amorim replied that China and his country have several 
similarities on the subject. 
  Brazilian authorities, Amorim explained, believe that an 
expanded Security Council will have more legitimacy, will 
prevent the expansion of the imbalance between developed and 
developing countries, and will make Security Council action more 
efficient. He noted that the Chinese position "is very similar," 
although he gave no details of it. 
  Brazil and the PRC act jointly in the United Nations to 
preserve world peace, the chief of Brazilian diplomacy said. 
This, he said, falls within the framework of "strategic 
relations" that the two countries maintain. 
  The largest Latin American country seeks to reinforce its 
presence in Asia, with whom it maintains -- except for the 
Middle East oil-producing countries -- 16 percent of its trade. 
This is why on 2 April Amorim held a working meeting with 24 
Brazilian ambassadors accredited to this continent, including to 
the Russian Federation. 
  Brazil, which is under the supervision of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), recently ratified a nuclear 
cooperation agreement for peaceful purposes with Argentina and 
is willing to broaden this cooperation to the PRC, Amorim said. 
  Brazil also is willing to sign without conditions the 
agreement on the control of medium-range missiles (MCR) [acronym 
as received] because, according to Amorim, it will allow a 
greater possibility of cooperation in the field of space 
research with countries like the PRC, whose "Long March" rockets 
will place two Brazilian natural resources monitoring satellites 
in orbit by 1996. 
  The Brazilian foreign minister announced that his Angolan 
counterpart will visit Brazil to discuss the situation in his 
country, and he asked the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola (UNITA) for "the necessary flexibility" 
to reestablish peace in Angola.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Clara R.M. do Prado] </F>
  [Excerpt] Brazilian financial relations with the 
multilateral credit organizations -- the World Bank (IRDB) and 
the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) -- have deteriorated 
in the last two years. In 1993, the country transferred a net of 
$1.744 billion to the two institutions, of which $1.467 billion 
was to the IRDB alone. 
  These transfers represent what the country had to pay in 
interest and servicing of the debt in exchange for what it 
received in disbursements by the two organizations. In the case 
of the IRDB, the situation is worse because its yearly 
disbursement to Brazil decreased from the already low level of 
$800 million at the end of the 1980's to about $500 million the 
IRDB has been disbursing annually since 1992. In 1993, the IRDB 
disbursed only $471 million to Brazil and received $1.318 
billion in debt service and $620 million in interest. 
  The value of the new loans also is decreasing. From the 
$1.344 billion the IRDB granted Brazil in 1992, the amount 
dropped almost 50 percent in 1993 and totaled only $636 million. 
As for the IDB, the loans decreased from $1.117 billion to $514 
million. 
  All sorts of problems help explain the deterioration of our 
relations with these organizations. Brazil has no resources to 
offer as compensation for these loans, the projects' management 
is ineffective, there is a lack of continuity in the projects' 
domestic administration, and there are bureaucratic difficulties 
that delay the flow of resources. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brasilia, 4 Apr (EFE) -- The Brazilian Foreign 
Ministry today reports that Brazil has agreed to the naming of 
Ramon Sanchez Parodi as new Cuban ambassador to Brasilia. 
Sanchez will replace Jorge Bolanos. 
  In an official note, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry stressed 
that between 1977 and 1989 Sanchez occupied "one of the most 
relevant and sensitive posts for Cuban diplomacy" as head of the 
Cuban Interests Section in the United States. 
  From 1989 to date, Sanchez, 55, has been a vice minister of 
foreign relations, a post to which Bolanos has now been 
promoted. Bolanos held the post of Cuban ambassador to Brazil 
for 7 years. 
  Brazil resumed diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1986 during 
Jose Sarney's government, after an interruption of more than two 
decades following the implementation of the one-party system on 
the island. 
  Brazilian companies have shown increased interest in 
economic 
and financial relations with Cuba, especially following the 
recent economic opening process.

<F P=106> [Report by Osvaldo Vega from La Moneda Palace] </F>
  [Text] Today President Eduardo Frei personally told 
Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange that he needs to 
retire from the institution. 
  This information was released through an official communique 
by Minister Secretary General of Government Victor Manuel 
Rebolledo this afternoon, after General Stange said at noon 
today after meeting with President Frei that he would not retire. 
  Minister Rebolledo said that according to the government the 
decision of Judge Juica, who proposes the opening of criminal 
proceedings against Carabineros Generals Cesar Mendoza Duran, 
Rodolfo Stange, and other officers for serious violations of 
military duties, puts the Carabineros in a worrisome situation, 
as it obstructs the effective and adequate fulfillment of their 
functions. Rebolledo added: 
  [Begin Rebolledo recording] Based on this situation, and 
with 
the purpose of guaranteeing above any other consideration the 
solidity and good operation of the Carabineros for fulfilling 
its duties, his excellency the president of the Republic 
conveyed to the Carabineros director general the need for him to 
retire, as a patriotic gesture in favor of the institution and 
the country. Unfortunately, Gen. Stange did not respond in a 
positive manner to the president's request. The president of 
the Republic, acting on behalf of the high interests of the 
country and of the Carabineros, trusts that Gen. Stange will 
reconsider his position, and if he does not the president will 
proceed to summon the National Security Council at the 
appropriate time. [end recording] 
  Minister Rebolledo did not answer questions from reporters 
on 
the government's deadline for Gen. Stange to reconsider his 
position, or when the National Security Council would be 
summoned by the president in case of a negative answer from Gen. 
Stange. President Frei will preside over the council, which is 
also made up of the Senate president, the comptroller general, 
the commanders of the Armed Forces, and the Carabineros director 
general, all of whom have the right to vote. The other 
officials who can attend the National Security Council meeting, 
but without the right to vote, are some ministers.

  [Text] The Supreme Court acknowledged a petition from the 
German courts requesting a series of judicial actions regarding 
the arrest and disappearance of three Chilean citizens by German 
citizens residing in the Dignidad Colony [in Chile]. 
  The court acknowledged the petition filed by Bonn's attorney 
general within the framework of legal proceedings against 
Dignidad Colony leader (Paul Schaeffer), suspected of being 
responsible for several murders. 
  Investigations in Germany refer to the murder of Alvaro 
Vallejos Villagran, aka Loro Matias; Alfonso Chanffreau; and 
Ezequiel Poncio Vicencio. 
  This information was disclosed by attorney Sergio Corvalan, 
who represents the Bonn court in Chile: 
  [Begin Corvalan recording] Basically, the petition requests 
the questioning of witnesses, one of them a German citizen who 
is not a member of the Dignidad Colony and the shipment of 
attested copies of legal documents, as well as information from 
the Rettig Commission archives so it can be officially included 
in the case being handled by the German court. [end recording] 
  Corvalan noted the significance of the Supreme Court's 
decision to acknowledge the petition because this is the first 
time the Chilean court has not objected to the German court's 
desire to investigate possible crimes committed by German 
citizens in Chile. 
  Corvalan added that he will request that (Paul Schaeffer) 
appear before the Bulnes Court once again within the framework 
of another lawsuit, a civilian one in this case, filed by the 
Dignidad Colony against one of its former leaders, (Hugo Bar). 
  Corvalan explained that (Schaeffer) appeared before the 
Bulnes Court on 31 March, but that he had been summoned for 
today, which represents an irregularity that annuls the 
proceeding.

  [Text] A telephone espionage scandal involving the Santo 
Domingo Group and SEMANA magazine sparked different reactions 
today. Bavaria Brewery president Augusto Lopez Valencia spoke 
from Cartagena: 
  [Begin recording] [Lopez] I am going to make a very brief 
comment because last week Felipe Lopez sent me a publication 
which carries a report about alleged telephone conversations. 
This situation was totally clarified. Lopez said SEMANA 
magazine, which I have yet to read because I was in meetings all 
day, published a completely different report. Our lawyers are 
studying the report and will issue a communique today or by 
tomorrow morning at the latest. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What measures will the company take? 
  [Lopez] The company is studying the matter. It is a very 
delicate issue [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] Do you think there will be a [words indistinct]? 
  [Lopez] It is not what I believe, but I think the country 
has 
already witnessed this. [end recording] 
  The Santo Domingo Group sent a fax to the media a few 
minutes 
ago. The fax states: SEMANA magazine published a report that 
illustrates the persecution to which the Santo Domingo Group has 
been subjected for a long time and which has increased since we 
received the contract to operate cellular telephones in the 
northwestern and coastal regions, where the communications 
[words indistinct]. SEMANA magazine reports that this scandal, 
which involves Mario Santo Domingo himself, started when Beatriz 
Davila, Mario Santo Domingo's wife, explained the dismissal of 
her brother-in-law, Carlos Perez Norsa Garay, from the Avianca 
board of directors. Maria del Pilar Ortiz filed a report. 
  [Begin Ortiz recording] The latest issue of SEMANA magazine 
published a front-page report that went on for five pages 
detailing an alleged espionage case. According to the magazine, 
businessman Julio Mario Santo Domingo listened to the 
conversations of Felipe Lopez, the magazine's president. This 
is telephone espionage. 
  According to the report, Carlos Perez Norsa Garay was 
dismissed from the board of directors of Avianca, which belongs 
to the Santo Domingo Group, after 10 years as a member. Augusto 
Lopez dismissed him unexpectedly. When Perez requested an 
explanation, he talked to his sister-in-law, Beatriz Davila, 
wife of Julio Mario Santo Domingo. The magazine reports that 
she told him: I have some tapes containing a telephone 
conversation where you told Felipe Lopez bad things about the 
group. She also gave other details that she was not supposed to 
know. According to Santo Domingo's wife, Felipe Lopez himself 
taped the conversation, and Bavaria Brewery Company President 
Augusto Lopez gave the tape to her husband. Augusto Lopez, in 
turn, told the prosecutor general that Felipe Lopez had given 
him nothing and that the recording did not exist; therefore, he 
had never been able to take it to New York. 
  SEMANA magazine told Prosecutor General Gustavo De Greiff 
about the case a week ago. Carlos Perez himself told the 
president. The SEMANA article hints that someone is lying 
because it seems that the recordings indeed exist. It is not 
known who made them or how they were made. The article also 
implies that if this telephone line was tapped, something 
similar could be done with the telephone line of a minister or a 
competitor in a bidding process. It is known that the Santo 
Domingo Group will operate a large share of cellular phones in 
the country. When the communications minister was asked about 
the case, he said the one thing had nothing to do with the 
other. Should it be proved the telephone taps did occur, there 
would be a legal punishment that would not affect the 
contracting process. [end recording]

    [Editorial report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 5 April. 
  The Agriculture-Livestock Marketing Institute [Idema] has 
said the government was forced to suspend Venezuelan rice 
imports due to a fall in Venezuelan rice production; 
consequently, it has authorized rice imports from China and 
Vietnam. Idema said despite rice imports, the country's rice 
stock remains very low. (Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol 
Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 29 March 94) 
  Recent figures show that in the past month, the consumer 
price index registered a 2.21-percent increase while the 
accumulated figure for the first quarter of 1994 is around 10 
percent. According to the National Administrative Department of 
Statistics, prices in the health sector, compared with the other 
sectors, showed a considerable rise. (Santa Fe de Bogota

<F P=106> [Article by Jaime Cristancho Gomez] </F>
  [Text] A new dispute has erupted between farmers and the 
board of directors of the Bank of the Republic about the rise in 
inflation. Agricultural sector spokespersons charge that some 
Bank directors and certain economists "act as if they live in a 
developed country." They pay no attention to rural poverty and 
focus only on statistics, while ignoring social considerations. 
  Spokespersons for the sector defended the Ministry of 
Agriculture for implementing agricultural recovery programs. The 
codirector of the Bank of the Republic, Maria Mercedes Cuellar 
de Martinez, blamed those programs for contributing to this 
year's increase in inflation, especially in February, when it 
was 3.68 percent. 
  The president of the SAC [Association of Colombian Farmers], 
Cesar de Hart Vengoechea, said the Bank of the Republic is not 
behaving responsibly when it blames inflation for errors in its 
calculations. 
  "In 1992 and 1993, the cost of living attributable to 
agriculture was used to cover up rises in other components of 
inflation, especially items for which the state is responsible, 
like utility rates and public services," said de Hart Vengoechea. 
  "It is time for the people who design economic policy to 
answer to the nation for their actions, due to their high social 
costs," he added. 
  The president of Fedegan [Association of Colombian 
Cattlemen], Jorge Visbal Martelo, said meat and milk price 
increases have been normal, below this year's projected 
inflation rate (19 percent). 
  "In our case, middlemen keep most of those increases. This 
year meat and milk prices will not go up very much. I can put 
consumers' minds at rest about that," said Visbal. 
  The director of Fedearroz [National Rice Growers 
Federation], 
Rafael Hernandez Lozano, said rice prices have been repressed, 
hurting profits in this sector. 
  In 1992, when inflation was 26 percent, the price paid to 
growers rose 4.8 percent; in 1993, when the cost of living index 
was 22.60 percent, prices paid to rice growers rose 14 percent. 
  Hernandez said that this year rice prices should rise 
between 
25 and 28 percent. "That has already started," he added. 
  "In inflationary periods, services and public spending go up 
and nothing is done about that. If we accept the unfettered 
operation of neoliberalism, the free market, as proposed by the 
National Planning Office and the Bank of the Republic, rice 
prices should go up 100 pesos per kilo this year," said the 
Fedearroz director. 
<H5>  Agriculture, a Burden </H5>
  According to the manager of Fenalce [National Federation of 
Cereal Growers], Adriano Quintana Silva, "grain growers cannot 
be held responsible for the rise in inflation." In his view, 
corn and sorghum producers are being overwhelmed by imports, and 
he asked that those grains be protected by the government. 
  "Economists consider agriculture a burden. Their problem is: 
what we do with the sector? They see nothing beyond cold 
mathematics, as they are only concerned about reducing 
inflation. They want cheap food with guerrillas, crime, and many 
social problems," said Quinta. 
  The president of Fedepapa [Potato Growers Federation], 
Augusto del Valle, said potato prices will go up until May, 
starting from last December, by about 80 percent, but will then 
begin to decline in the second half of the year. 
  "I support food imports. But what do we do about very 
low-tech campesinos, people who grow crops on vertical slopes? 
According to people from the Bank of the Republic, they should 
just go away. How? By digging a trench around them? Where do we 
put those people? Economists have skin as tough as a 
crocodile's. They seem impervious to social phenomena," 
commented del Valle. 
<H5>  Ministry Does not Control the Climate: Ocampo G. </H5>
  Armenia Minister of Agriculture Jose Antonio Ocampo Gaviria 
denied charges by some members of the board of directors of the 
Bank of the Republic, and said that a number of climate-related 
factors helped to boost inflation during the first two months of 
1994. 
  The minister denied that the government's present 
agricultural policy was responsible for the rise in inflation 
and said that, among other factors, the climate played a role. 
  Ocampo mentioned the Bank of the Republic and said that 
probably "some members of the board thought that as HIMAT 
[Colombian Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology, and Land 
Improvement] is part of the Ministry of Agriculture, the 
Ministry controls the climate." 
  Ocampo Gaviaria was in Armenia to take part in a seminar to 
publicize the General Agricultural and Fishing Development Law. 
  He announced that within the next few days the government 
will finalize two measures to protect campesinos whose yucca and 
fiber production (for bags) has been hurt by lowered trade 
barriers. 
  Ocampo said that when a certain type of import is 
detrimental 
to farmers, the law provides protective mechanisms that may be 
initiated or requested by private individuals, the private 
sector, or by the government itself.

    [Editorial report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 5 April. 
  The Ecuadoran Government has announced the inflation rate 
for 
March was 2.64 percent, bringing the yearly total to 31.62 
percent. Juan Jose Illingworth, director of the Institute of 
Statistics and Census, told reporters during a news conference 
in Quito the government is still determined to attain its goal 
of reducing inflation to 20 percent by the end of 1994. (Mexico 
City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2027 GMT 31 March 94) 
  The government has decided to increase prices for super 
gasoline to 3,000 sucres per gallon. The March currency 
exchange rate, according to authorities, caused the increase. 
(Quito Voz de los Andes in Spanish 2300 GMT 1 April 94) 
  Industry Minister Jose Vicente Maldonado has announced 
Ecuador will ask the Andean Group meeting to postpone 
discussions on the common import tariff. The group is scheduled 
to meet on 4 and 5 April in Caracas. The decision comes in 
response to a request by private industrialists. (Quito Voz de

  [Text] On 4 April, Paraguayan Foreign Minister Dr. Luis 
Maria Ramirez Boettner confirmed the government will officially 
receive Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, who announced 
his visit to our country as part of his South American tour that 
also includes Uruguay, Peru, and Argentina. 
  Ramirez Boettner made it clear that he personally will be 
unable to receive the Cuban foreign minister because it 
coincides with a scheduled visit to Morocco (Africa) where he 
will sign a final document on the Uruguay Round of GATT talks. 
The Paraguayan foreign minister added: "It is not that we will 
not receive him. It is just that it coincides with my visit to 
Morocco. Therefore, Vice Foreign Minister Cabello Sarubbi will 
be in charge of taking care of him." 
  Robaina, who is now in Montevideo, said: "The purpose of my 
visit to South American countries is to explain Cuba's current 
situation to the presidents and announce the opening of our 
markets to foreign capital, which will not be limited," in an 
effort to overcome the island's delicate economic situation. 
  The Cuban foreign minister held three official activities in 
Uruguay on 4 April. Robaina met 30 minutes with Uruguayan 
President Luis Alberto Lacalle Herrera, paid tribute to 
Uruguayan hero Jose Gervasio Artigas, who was exiled to and died 
in our country, and met congressmen from the three Uruguayan 
political parties (Blanco, Colorado, and Broad Front). Foreign 
Minister Robaina's duties include reviewing a way in which Cuba 
might settle a $33 million debt to Uruguay. This point will be 
discussed when he meets Central Bank President Enrique Braga. 
  Cuban ambassador Manuel Aguilera de la Paz, who began his 
duties on 18 March, told journalists: "We are not in a position 
to pay at this time, but we are actually willing to find new 
ways of contributing to finding a solution to begin paying this 
debt." 
  The Cuban foreign minister said the invitation to invest in 
his country has been prompted by the new economic measures 
promoted by Cuban President Fidel Castro's regime. Robaina 
emphasized: "We have no limitations on the reception of capital. 
No one has been excluded." He added that tourism, oil, nickel, 
citrus, and agriculture in general are the most attractive areas 
for foreign investment.

  [Text] Lima, 3 Apr (EFE) -- The immediate return of Peru to 
the trade integration program of the Andean Regional Group 
(Gran) was discarded today by Peruvian Integration Minister 
Liliana Canale. 
  Beside Peru, the Gran includes Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, 
and Venezuela. 
  Minister Canale left for Caracas to attend a meeting of the 
Cartagena Accord Commission. She said Peru will resume all its 
commitments in the Gran "as distortions affecting regional trade 
are eliminated." 
  Canale thus alluded to the fact that Peru's partners in the 
Gran have an external common tariff of four different scales (5, 
10, 15, and 25 percent) while Peru virtually has one 15 percent 
rate. 
  Before leaving, Canale said: "Instead of thinking of an 
urgent return to the group, we must consider how to strengthen 
Andean trade." She added: "We will consider returning as tariff 
distortions are eliminated." 
  Peru suspended its participation in the commercial program 
of 
the Gran in August 1992, with the agreement of its partners, 
until December 1993 when it requested an indefinite extension. 
  Meanwhile, Peruvian trade with the other four members of the 
group continues through bilateral agreements which, according to 
Canale, will be strengthened in the next few months.

  [Text] Today, Industry Minister Liliana Canale said Peru 
will gradually resume its obligations with the Andean Pact. She 
added that Peru has not returned to the subregional group, which 
is also made up of Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador, 
because Peru never left that organization. 
  She indicated that Peru is only resuming its obligations 
with 
the Andean Pact based on certain conditions. Among these, she 
mentioned the fulfillment of the proposal made by Peru in the 
meeting being held in Caracas. Our country requested the 
elimination of any type of export subsidies as well as of the

  [Text] Lima, 4 Apr (EFE) -- At least 10 convicts were 
wounded, some of them seriously, during a knife fight between 
two factions of the Shining Path at the prison of Huancayo City, 
in the Central Andes Region. The bloody fight was the outcome of 
an "ideological debate" between one faction which supports 
Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman, who wants to make peace with 
the government, and another faction which rejects the proposal 
and insists on continuing the "popular war" that it declared 
against Peruvian democracy in 1980. 
  An officer of the Huamanccacca Prison of Huancayo reported 
that the confrontation began when the dissident group called Red 
Path [Sendero Rojo], which rejects peace, launched a harsh 
verbal attack against Guzman during a Shining Path meeting in 
which the subversive chief's peace proposal was being discussed. 
Prison personnel and police had to separate the two factions, 
the source reported. 
  Shining Path is experiencing a prolonged crisis, which began 
with the capture of Guzman in September 1992 and which became 
even more critical one year later when the gang divided in to 
two factions because of the leader's proposal, who acknowledged 
the political and military defeat of his organization.

<F P=106> [Interview with Industry Minister Liliana Canale Novella; </F>
place and date not given: "Government Seeks Outward-Looking 
Economic Model"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Industry, Tourism, Integration, and 
International Trade Negotiations [MITINCI] is a complex 
portfolio that spans diverse areas of the country's economic 
activity, all of them keys to national development. To these 
must be added the fundamental task performed by Prom-Peru at the 
international level. Responsible for all these sectors is 
Minister Liliana Canale Novella. In an interview granted to EL 
COMERCIO, she provides details of her ministry's policy, and 
particularly those related to industrial development during the 
past few years, the outlook with respect to tourism, our 
position with respect to the Andean Pact, how the country should 
approach the new 21st century economy of blocs, and Peruvian 
efforts to improve its image abroad. 
  Following is a summary of EL COMERCIO's dialogue with 
Minister Canale. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Minister Canale, now that you are at the head 
of MITINCI, what will be your policy lines? 
  [Canale] We shall continue along the line begun by Jorge 
Camet, toward liberalization of the market and the attainment of 
other conditions such as the elimination of excessive regulation 
and complex red tape, which make it difficult to speed up 
investments in the productive sector. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Regarding a sector as important as small 
business, what will be your policy? 
  [Canale] In this regard, we shall make information readily 
available to these small-business and microbusiness sectors. We 
shall also play a promotional role in support of the work being 
done by Prom-Peru to promote investments, tourism, and exports. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Speaking of national industry, what has been 
the development of this subsector since 1990? 
  [Canale] I believe there have been advances in everything 
concerning regulation and liberalization of the market. Since 
the beginning of the reforms of the state structure, the indices 
have been very promising, especially in the manufacturing 
sector, whose growth rate has attained 9.3 percent. For the time 
being we want to at least maintain a similar rate for this year. 
  [EL COMERCIO] And what about tourism? 
  [Canale] Tourism from abroad attained a growth rate of 
almost 
30 percent in 1993. Domestic tourism, supported by FOPTUR 
[Tourism Promotion Fund] is exhibiting a growth that in the 
initial months of this year has already reached 20 percent, 
despite the fact that January and February are very low months. 
  [EL COMERCIO] What other aspects will your ministry develop, 
especially with regard to exports? 
  [Canale] The export sector will be given special status as 
regards support and improvement of the system of temporary 
imports. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Do you envision improved conditions for 
investment? 
  [Canale] As for the industrial sector, we shall have a 
sizable influx of foreign investments in local industries. This 
will enable us to create favorable conditions for the coming 
years. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Many are wondering what the purpose of a 
Ministry of Industry is in a free market.... 
  [Canale] We have been playing an important role. For 
example, 
we have facilitated the liberalizing of the economy at all 
times. We are supporting an outward-looking economic model. This 
involves not only the macroeconomic environment, but also the 
creation of sectorial conditions that will favor a rapid 
technology transfer, thus enabling us to create neutral 
competitive conditions that in turn will help our exporters to 
compete on an equal footing with exporters anywhere in the world. 
<H5>  Negotiations and the Andean Pact </H5>
  [EL COMERCIO] Are we approaching the time when a decision 
will have to be made with respect to the Andean Pact? What is 
Peru's proposal? 
  [Canale] For obvious reasons of negotiation, Peru's proposal 
will be revealed when it is presented to the ministers of the 
Andean Group. But there is an important principle. We want 
balanced trade among the partners in the GRAN [Andean Regional 
Group]. Therefore, our proposal will seek mechanisms to 
facilitate harmonization of the macroeconomic policies that 
today are distorting trade. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Will it seek equality of conditions in 
regional 
trade.... 
  [Canale] Our proposal will seek to expand trade channels, do 
away with distortions and inequalities, and advance the policy 
of macroeconomic and commercial standardization. 
  [EL COMERCIO] But what basic building blocks might this 
proposal contain? 
  [Canale] The proposal contemplates a rise in the level of 
trade with the other Andean partners. As a basic principle, we 
do not want to rigidly support a process of integration that may 
bring into play issues that go beyond that of the free-trade 
zone. 
  [EL COMERCIO] But is Peru in a position to become a 
full-fledged member of the GRAN? 
  [Canale] The issue of a joint schedule of customs duties on 
imports from abroad has not yet been resolved, and--except for 
Peru--the countries that favor this approach have not yet 
reached full agreement on it. In any case, it is an overall 
issue that encompasses the GRAN as a whole, and not the Peruvian 
position alone. I think it would be very helpful if the press 
would aid in creating awareness of the fundamental and worldwide 
economic principle involved. The question is not whether Peru is 
or is not in a given position. We need to understand that we can 
all grow together if we all struggle together, to homogenize our 
macroeconomic policies. 
  [EL COMERCIO] The essence of the issue with the GRAN is the 
flat 15 percent customs rate. Will this level be reached in 1995? 
  [Canale] It is one of Peru's goals. But the when and how is 
entirely the responsibility of the MEF [Ministry of Economy and 
Finance], which handles customs tariff policy. However, within 
the government's policy, our goal remains a flat customs rate. 
Consideration must also be given to something that in any case 
is positive. One sees the flat customs issue and forgets that 
provision is also included for knocked-down machinery imports, 
for example, on a partial payments basis. 
  [EL COMERCIO] We have become part of a bloc-oriented trade 
policy or "economy of blocs." How does Peru fit into this new 
context of economic and trade relations, with respect, for 
example, to the Free Trade Agreement? 
  [Canale] What is occurring is a rather attractive 
hemispheric 
integration. I believe that globalizing the international 
markets creates important advantages for all countries. And we 
are hoping to develop the genuinely competitive advantages. 
Achievement of a hemispheric bloc will depend on the progress 
made by each country. It is an issue that as yet has not been 
negotiated. 
  [EL COMERCIO] We came out of the GATT negotiations in good 
shape.... 
  [Canale] The Uruguay Round package has yet to pass the test 
of formal acceptance by the Congress; but we the executive 
branch are in agreement with what has been negotiated. Our 
position was studied and agreed to by the country's businessmen. 
Approximately 98 percent of the products being traded are 
already being subjected to the 15 percent tariff. When one joins 
the GATT one negotiates the consolidation of certain customs 
duties and determines a ceiling. Ours is 30 percent. This means 
that we cannot go beyond that ceiling. Our customs duty may 
actually be 15 percent, but it is normal in GATT to always keep 
a reserve, a margin for negotiation. In no case, however, shall 
we go beyond 30 percent. This rate does not affect the farm 
products that are subject to surtaxes. 
  [EL COMERCIO] What can you tell us regarding the forthcoming 
bilateral agreements? 
  [Canale] We shall begin talks with Mexico to work out 
agreements on complementary economic relations, with a view to 
liberalizing trade in some sectors. In an initial meeting we 
shall define everything relative to the general lines of those 
agreements and the concomitant regulatory framework. We shall 
also draft a viable trade agreement. In all of this, much will 
depend on the comprehensiveness of application of the regulatory 
framework. We must consider all aspects of taxation, 
liberalization of transport, and everything related to our 
agenda for the reciprocal development. This gives you an idea of 
the scope of the forthcoming negotiations. 
  [EL COMERCIO] And about the bilateral agreement that has 
been 
signed with Brazil? 
  [Canale] The agreement signed with Brazil on 31 December is 
in the process of formalization as regards marketing; but it 
goes much deeper. As regards Brazil and Argentina, the 
possibilities of expanding the list of products having favored 
tariff treatment has been reduced by Mercosur [Common Market of 
the South] guidelines, such as evaluation of joint external 
customs duties and harmonization of macroeconomic management 
policies. These are factors that the presidents watch 
rigorously. The expansion of lists with those countries cannot 
be very extensive; but we have had talks aimed at incorporating 
some products between now and May that can be of interest from 
an export viewpoint. We are hopeful that negotiations with Chile 
can be concluded during the first half of this year. In any 
event, they will have to do with the development of 
complementary economic relations. 
<H5>  Pending Review </H5>
  [EL COMERCIO] Nevertheless, there are other agreements that 
have already been signed and are currently under review.... 
  [Canale] We have a request by the Cuban Government to expand 
our limited-trade agreement. It is an agreement we signed many 
years ago within the framework of the ALADI [Latin American 
Integration Association]. We will review the items having 
favored tariff treatment. We are also working on extension of 
the time limit on Andean tariff preferences within the European 
market that were granted to countries affected by terrorism or 
drug trafficking. We are conducting a support and justification 
action together with the benefiting countries, aimed at 
extending the benefit of zero customs. We also have preferential 
zero tariff treatment in the American market for a large group 
of products such as leathers and footwear. 
  [EL COMERCIO] A question that is a must when speaking of 
integration and international trade, and that is the talk of 
many analysts: Will we be able to join Mercosur in the very near 
future? 
  [Canale] Our agreements with Brazil and Argentina are 
bilateral approaches within the framework of ALADI. We are 
thinking in terms of a process of hemispheric integration. We 
must gradually adjust the mechanisms that will gradually bring 
about this integration among countries with such dissimilar 
productive structures and such different trade policies, 
bringing these countries together in pursuit of the development 
of parallel trading and a harmonization of commercial policies. 
Our country's particular interest is to further the process of 
liberalization. 
  [EL COMERCIO] As regards tourism, there has been talk of 
investments totaling some $100 million.... 
  [Canale] Investments totaling $100 million have been 
arranged. A sizable group of foreign investors is interested in 
expanding the hotel infrastructure, besides participating in the 
Entur-Peru privatization process. There is interest in the 
exportable offer of adventure-type tourism. This is a very 
positive year, which therefore calls for investment in 
infrastructure and services. We are supporting this effort 
through Foptur. 
  [EL COMERCIO] A part of your work will be related to 
Prom-Peru. Will there be a change of promotion strategy? 
  [Canale] We shall continue actively supporting the projects 
already under way in all areas, such as exports and investments. 
We shall become involved in promotion aimed at attracting 
investments. We are planning a second visit to the European 
countries, because the first was very successful; and we will be 
resuming implementation of our work program. Our missions will 
be participated in by ministers of state and businessmen, or 
businessmen alone. Within 15 days, we are expecting visits by a 
group of businessmen from the United Kingdom, and another group 
from Japan. These visits are not necessarily being organized by 
Prom-Peru; but Prom-Peru is providing the necessary support for 
them.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Election Coffer"] </F>
  [Text] Now that dollars from the privatization program are 
beginning to shower down like rain, there is a legitimate 
concern about the fabulous election coffer which the government 
will have available in 1994. 
  In the first place the income from privatization will not be 
the $886 million which the executive branch forecast when it 
prepared the 1994 Budget. Let us say, in a preliminary way, that 
the income from privatization will be very much larger. 
  To the $1,391 million which the Spanish offered (obtained by 
subtracting $691 million for the purchase of 15 percent of the 
new shares of stock from the $2,002 million available) should be 
added $67 million from the sale of Cementos Yura [Yura Cement 
Company] and what is expected to be obtained from the sale of 
CENTROMIN [Central Mining Enterprise]--despite the fact that $60 
million will be contracted in additional foreign debt. This 
amounts to about $300 million in cash. 
  From the sale of INTERBANC [International Bank] and Banco 
Intercontinental [Intercontinental Bank] it was anticipated that 
about $200 million would be received ($50 million for INTERBANC 
and $150 million for Banco Continental). Another source of 
resources will come from the sale of the Lima Electricity 
Company, from which another $500 million are expected to be 
obtained. From the privatization of the Tintaya Mining Company, 
it is reasonable to expect $50 million; from Cementos Lima [Lima 
Cement Company], $55 million; from the PARAMONGA Company, 
another $40 million; from Cementos Pacasmayo [Pacasmayo Cement 
Company], $30 million; from Pesca Peru [State Fishmeal and Fish 
Oil Production Agency], $30 million; and from Electro Peru 
[Peruvian State Electric Power Enterprise], another $300 million. 
  Adding all of this up, we can say that if the flow of cash 
which began with the sale of CPT--Entel Peru [Peruvian Telephone 
Company--National Telecommunications Enterprise] should 
continue, the government may wind up receiving nothing less than 
$2.5 billion from the company privatization program. 
  The only thing left to do is to make sure that the rest of 
the Special Privatization Committees (CEPRIS) show the same 
seriousness, professional integrity, and openness as were 
displayed by Javier Tovar in the privatization of the Peruvian 
Telephone Company and Dr. Alberto Pandolfi in the sale of the 
Yura Cement Company. 
  When the government thought that it would barely obtain $886 
million from the privatization program, it also had as its goal 
tax income barely amounting to 8.5 percent of Gross Domestic 
Product [GDP]. 
  The present pace of tax collection has grown spectacularly. 
It now stands at 12.5 percent of GDP. 
  Sandro Fuentes, the superintendent of the Tax 
Administration, 
has just collected 1,971 million nuevos soles in January and 
February 1994, setting an astonishing record. At this level of 
tax collection the government will have an additional 4.0 
percent of GDP in tax income which it did not anticipate when it 
prepared the budget. These four percentage points of growth in 
tax revenue amount to no less than $1,640 million in additional 
funds for budgetary expenditures. What good luck! 
  You do not have to be a wizard to bet that government 
officials are going around with big smiles on their faces. The 
$2.5 billion obtained from the privatization program (compared 
to the $886 million anticipated from it), plus the $1.6 billion 
from additional tax collections, are a welcome surprise for 
anyone. 
  According to the 1994 Budget Law, budgeted expenditures 
amount to $5.9 billion. At the present rate of tax collection 
about $5.0 billion could easily be collected in 1994, as a 
result of which the government will soon have a budget surplus 
of 7.0 percent of GDP (about $2.8 billion). 
  Calculating the result is easy if you add to the $5.0 
billion 
in tax collections the $900 million obtained from foreign loans, 
the $300 million from the issuance of domestic bonds, and the 
$2.5 billion in income from the privatization program. This 
amounts to $8.8 billion in income, against expenditures in the 
order of $5.9 billion, as provided in the budget law. 
  The $2.9 billion surplus will be a great temptation for 
President Alberto Fujimori. Perhaps that is why the IMF visiting 
mission has urged that the income from the privatization program 
($2.5 billion) should go into an account which cannot be touched. 
  The election coffer which President Fujimori had before the 
resources obtained from the sale of the telephone company to 
Spanish interests appeared on the scene was not insignificant. 
  The government had and still has $650 million budgeted for 
investment expenditures in 1994. With these resources the 
construction of the Pasto-Grande, Chavimochic, and the Olmos and 
Tinajones projects, etc., will be continued. To these investment 
expenditures the government is adding the $154 million which 
Manuel Estela Benavides has available under the FONCODES 
[National Compensation and Social Development Fund] for programs 
to relieve poverty. 
  As if all of the foregoing did not amount to much, we 
published in issue No. 364 of SI a confidential document from 
the Ministry of the Presidency, in which it is proved that Raul 
Vittor Alfaro, the new cabinet minister, will have $456 million 
to spend in 1994 from resources obtained from FONAVI [National 
Housing Fund]. (Some $156 million of this total were carried 
over in the accounts from 1993 and almost $300 million will be 
provided by FONAVI in 1994.) 
  The arbitrary way in which the government spends the 
resources of FONAVI is an open secret. As an example of the 
height of irresponsibility no reliable system has even been set 
up to recover these resources. Out of the hundreds of millions 
of dollars which have been misappropriated only a handful of 
dollars has been recovered. 
  Each time that the president makes a trip to some outlying 
area of the country he offers running water and drainage 
systems, or the construction of a college, with resources 
obtained from FONAVI--as if this money was part of the budget. 
Another important resource which the president's reelection 
campaign will have is the $500 million in International 
Technical Cooperation which will come into the country in 1994, 
as Eduardo Ishi Ito, the deputy minister of international 
cooperation, stated on 17 January to EL PERUANO, the official 
daily newspaper. 
  Finally, how these $500 million dollars--which other 
countries extended to us as a gift--will be divided up remains a 
great mystery. On repeated occasions SI has tried unsuccessfully 
to obtain this information from the highest reaches of the 
government. The silence has been that of the tomb. Finally, Ishi 
Ito has drawn aside the veil over the astonishing size of these 
resources: $500 million. Having so much money available is quite 
a temptation. There are the $2.5 billion from the privatization 
program and $1,640 million from additional tax collections. 
These funds will be a powerful kind of fuel for the reelection 
campaign which is approaching. 
  If you add to this additional income the $650 million in 
investment expenditures under the budget, the $154 million from 
FONCODES, the $456 million from FONAVI, and the $500 million in 
International Technical Cooperation funds, the campaign chest 
will burst from its present state of being full. 
  In short, even before the bid for the purchase of Telefonica 
Peru [Peruvian Telephone Company] is opened, the government 
already has a powerful election campaign chest of $1,760 million. 
  To this figure should be added the $1,614 million in 
increased income from the privatization program and the steady 
increase in tax collections, expected to amount to $1,640 
million in 1994. 
  These $5,014 million should not be spent or given away on 
public works which do not support development over the medium 
term. On the other hand it is not easy to spend so much money. 
The daily pace of expenditures should be in the order of $13 
million. Neither the government nor the country as a whole 
presently has design and construction teams and projects on hand 
to use up this money. This is not a small matter. It would 
amount to more than $218 in expenditures for every Peruvian, the 
result of dividing more than $5,014 million among the 23 million 
people living in this country. 
  The election coffer which President Fujimori has is the 
largest which any presidential candidate has had in the history 
of Latin America. If Fujimori loses his reelection bid, it will 
not be the result of a lack of money but simply because so much 
money killed him with indigestion.

<F P=106> [Article signed J.A.M.: "Ministro's Sailors"] </F>
  [Text] Yurimaguas, the most important river port on the 
lower Huallaga and one of the great entry points to Amazonia, is 
also one of the forest capitals around which today operates one 
of the most active drug trafficking bands. 
  The Huallaga river is navigable to deep-draught vessels up 
to 
this point. Beyond the port, upstream, traffic is limited to 
launches. Distances are measured in launch/hours. The principal 
product of traffic by this means is basic cocaine paste (BCP), 
gathered by the so-called "traqueteros." 
  A port captaincy operates in Yurimaguas, which is manned by 
a 
detachment of the Peruvian Navy. From August to October 1993, 
the period within which these events took place, the port 
captain was Navy First Lieutenant Victor Herrera Sheen. One of 
his deputies was AP [Peruvian Navy] Lieutenant Pedro Huarcaya 
Briceno. 
  Huarcaya and Herrera are the central figures in this 
account, 
provided voluntarily by a maritime officer [oficial de mar] to 
the Special Investigative Working Group on Drug Trafficking, 
appointed by the Constituent Democratic Congress (CCD). The 
investigative group is headed by Julio Castro Gomez of the 
Democratic Movement of the Left (MDI). 
<H5>  Telejo Airport </H5>
  Leaving Yurimaguas going south on the Huallaga, after two 
hours one arrives at the village of Telejo. In August 
1993--according to the testimony of the maritime witness to the 
CCD committee--a clandestine airport was constructed there under 
the benign gaze of his chiefs. 
  Shortly before 1993, through the intermediate ports of 
Garcilaso, Abel Guerra and La Boca, people noticed--and they 
noticed it because access to the port is open--heavy traffic in 
iron and cement from Yurimaguas to Telejo. Mention is made of 
frequent shipments (it is not specified whether daily or weekly) 
of 50 bags of cement. But there are no important building 
projects in Telejo. Then why so much building material? 
  "The boat owners and the pilots told us that it was for the 
airport," said the mariner. 
  The members of the CCD committee asked him specifically if 
he 
knew of BCP flights from Telejo. 
  "I knew of an initial flight about 30 days ago (calculating 
dates, this had to be about mid-September) and of a second 
flight Thursday at midnight (in mid-October), that is, with 
night navigation. 
  Between 40 and 50 men worked on the project. But who gave 
the 
order to build the airstrip? 
<H5>  The "Caletas" </H5>
  The accuser also testified to an intense traffic of raw 
materials for the manufacture of BCP. He mentioned kerosene, 
carbonate, sulfuric acid, and calcium. The lieutenants observed 
this without reacting. 
  The enumeration of the delivery points for these materials 
by 
the accuser is interesting. Within the environs of Yurimaguas he 
indicated the settlement of Shitari, at 15 minute distance, and 
Santa Elena, Santa Maria, Santa Isabel and Dos de Mayo, within a 
similar radius. 
  At more remote distances--from two to three and a half 
hours--he mentioned Shucushuyacu, Yarina, Shazuta and Huimbayoc. 
The crude paste reaches these locations and is converted into 
refined paste. The places where these conversions take place are 
called "caletas." 
  All of these places centered around Huimbayoc form the 
domain 
of Waldo Vargas Arias, "capo" of the drug traffic, of Colombian 
nationality, better known under the nickname of El Ministro. 
<H5>  Which Authorities </H5>
  The CCD committee asked the maritime officer for the names 
of 
the officials or authorities who knew of the activities he was 
revealing. 
  "The only names of officers that I could give--he 
replied--would be those of Lieutenant AP Pedro Huarcaya Briceno 
and First Lieutenant AP Victor Herrera Sheen. Lieutenant Herrera 
is the port captain and Lieutenant Huarcaya, chief of personnel, 
reports to him daily." 
  The witness was asked whether he knew the version according 
to which the military authorities were providing security to the 
drug traffickers so that the airplanes could take off without 
problems. 
  "I had no knowledge of that, but I can add something. One 
can 
see--he declared--police officers as well as naval officers 
having meetings with people connected to the drug traffic. I can 
mention Mr. Miguel or Luis Farro. This individual is known in 
the area as a "narco." He has several launches that travel all 
over the Huallaga. I have even seen two emissaries from El 
Ministro who came from Huimbayoc to visit my superiors." 
<H5>  Detachment in Yurimaguas </H5>
  One of the premises of the maritime officer was that the 
activities of the "traqueteros" or collectors was by means of 
the launches. 
  "Did your immediate commander ever order an action against 
these `traqueteros,' he was asked. 
  "We were never ordered specifically to intervene against 
`traqueteros.' However, on one occasion we crossed the river to 
the Huimbayoc area, under the command of Lieutenant Huarcaya." 
  They departed in two launches at 0430, so as not to be seen. 
But the crossing took place without incident. When they reached 
Huimbayoc, Huarcaya deployed his people behind an island and 
ordered them to act. They proceeded to search everyone without 
distinction. Dollars were discovered, but no drugs. The 
lieutenant claimed that the money came from drugs and gave the 
order to seize it. Everyone turned over the proceeds to the 
chief. Lieutenant Huarcaya kept the booty until the return to 
Yurimaguas. Only then would he proceed to distribute it, 
according to the rank of each. 
  Meanwhile, the operation continued. "This is good, and we 
are 
going to stay," he ordered. 
  A brothel was operating in Huimbayoc, on the banks of the 
river, despite the explicit prohibition of the regulations. The 
naval witness said that the rule is as follows: the entire 
riverine zone is property of the state and no establishement of 
that type may operate there. 
  On that tropical night, Lieutenant Huarcaya was the special 
guest of a certain "Passion." The eight military personnel who 
accompanied him acted as security. The naval witness and accuser 
asserted that on that occasion, in addition to the pleasures 
provided by the service, "Passion" paid Lieutenant Huarcaya the 
sum of $2,000, so that the patrol would continue to turn a blind 
eye to the brothel's activities. This is what is stated in the 
testimony in the hands of the CCD's working committee. 
  Two caches were discovered in the village, the first of 
about 
120 kg and the second of 100 kg of paste in the process of 
steeping, deposited in plastic drums. 
  "We must not get involved in problems. I am going to fix 
things with the secretary for discipline of the night patrol, 
Mr. Alegria aka `Guitarron,' and with the president, Mr. 
Macedo," was the lieutenant's remark. 
  The detachment went to Yurimaguas. The amount collected was 
$2,800 ($800 seized on the island and $2,000 paid by "Passion"). 
Huarcaya tipped the senior technician $60, those beneath him in 
rank $40, and $20 to the corporal. The intelligence technician, 
Reynero Gallo, was the one who actually paid out the shares. And 
the rest of the booty? Naturally, there were complaints. "The 
matter is closed and do not test my patience," was how 
Lieutenant Huarcaya dealt with this issue. 
  "Do you know whether any of this money reached higher 
ranking 
personnel?" was an important question asked of the naval witness. 
  "No. The only officer of higher rank was Lieutenant Victor 
Herrera Sheen, who at that moment was in Lima. Lieutenant Pedro 
Huarcaya ordered the raid while he was alone. He did everything 
without informing the director of captaincies, Admiral Texeira, 
and without informing his superiors in Lima. 
  The CCD Special Investigative Working Group on Drug 
Trafficking, directed by Julio Castro Gomez, has been 
investigating the case since the end of October 1993. 
<H5>  [Box, p 35] </H5>
<H5>  The Art of Escaping </H5>
  Not only National Police personnel were involved in the 
escape of the Colombian drug trafficker called El Ministro, on 
May 1993, but also naval officers in charge of the Yurimaguas 
Port Captaincy. 
  Also involved in the illegal liberation of Waldo Vargas 
Arias, in exchange for a bribe of $100,000, were Navy 
Lieutenants Victor Herrera sheen and Pedro Huarcaya Briceno, 
officers who were in charge of the naval base at the port of 
Yurimaguas at the time. 
  This is what is emphatically stated by the maritime officer, 
who witnessed the events, and who decided late last year to 
present himself to the CCD Special Investigative Working Group 
on Drug Trafficking to tell the whole truth. 
  According to his testimony, two policemen whose names he 
does 
not know but who he could recognize, turned over to Navy 
Lieutenant Victor Herrera the sum of $8,000. The money was paid 
so that the naval officers would allow the departure without the 
required authorization of the boat or launch on which El 
Ministro, his companion, and two bodyguards made their escape. 
  A Navy quartermaster named Ramirez was an eye witness to the 
payment of $8,000 and it was he who communicated the fact to the 
rest of the personnel of the Captaincy. Quartermaster Ramirez 
also claimed that four days before the arrival in Yurimaguas of 
the PNP [Peruvian National Police] Investigative Commission, led 
by General Rodolfo Angeles, the policemen met with the commander 
of the Port Captaincy. 
  The Commission did not interview either of the two naval 
officers. Neither did any Navy inspection team investigate the 
incident. There is only the report of the appearance of a naval 
inspector who limited himself to checking the Captaincy's 
administrative work, according to the version of the accuser 
that was provided to the CCD Working Group. 
  There is more. With regard to the various irregularities 
that 
have occurred at the Port Captaincy of Yurimaguas, the assistant 
technician of the naval police, Jaime Huaman, submitted a 
detailed report to the deputy chief of personnel in Lima. But 
the outcome was negative. Informed of the report, Lieutenant 
Herrera began to harass technician Huaman. The latter's report 
described the lack of surveillance of drug trafficking in the 
area and abuses of authority by the two officers. 
  Lieutenants Victor Herrera and Pedro Huarcaya continued on 
at 
the base in Yurimaguas until late last year, in spite of having 
exceeded the six-month period of assignment to the area 
established for officer personnel.

  [Text] Montevideo, 4 Apr (AFP-NA) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina Martinez announced today that his country will 
implement an open market policy. He stated that in a move to 
overcome the economic crisis that is weighing heavily on the 
island, Fidel Castro's administration will not "impose 
limitations" on the entry of foreign capital. 
  During a news conference Robaina pointed out that "our visit 
to Uruguay, as the first leg of a tour of the region, seeks to 
explain to Latin American rulers the reality of the Cuban 
situation and to announce the opening of our market to foreign 
capital." 
  Robaina acknowledged that the economic and social 
deterioration confronting Cuba has obliged its rulers to seek a 
way out by "implementing an open market policy and accepting 
that foreign capital--regardless of its origin--can invest in 
our country free from any constraints." 
  The Cuban foreign minister, who arrived in Montevideo on 4 
April for a three-day official visit, was received by President 
Luis Alberto Lacalle at his private residence. They held a 
30-minute talk. 
  Robaina said: "We discussed several subjects of Latin 
American interest, laying special emphasis on the reality that 
we Cubans are living through at present and on the possibility 
of enhancing bilateral trade." 
  Trade between Uruguay and Cuba is paralyzed due to the fact 
that the Castro administration has a $30 million debt with 
Uruguay that has been outstanding for four years. Robaina 
offered to repay this debt by "sending medicines and medical 
equipment" to Uruguay. 
  The young foreign minister said that "the most promising 
sectors for those investors who are interested in coming to Cuba 
are tourism, biotechnology, and agriculture." 
  Following his meeting with Lacalle, Robaina had luncheon 
with 
Liber Seregni, the leader of the leftist coalition, the Broad 
Front, and then had a meeting with Cubans residing in Uruguay. 
  The Cuban foreign minister's agenda also includes a meeting 
with his Uruguayan counterpart Sergio Abreu on 5 April. On the 
last day of his visit Robaina will deliver a speech before 
representatives from the 11 countries that make up the Latin 
American Integration Association (ALADI), which is headquartered 
in Montevideo. 
  Cuban Embassy spokesmen have reported that Robaina's tour, 
which started in Uruguay, will also include visits to Peru, 
Argentina, and Paraguay.

  [Text] Montevideo, 5 Apr (EFE)--There were many demands to 
introduce the democratic system in Cuba during the first day of 
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's official visit to 
Montevideo. Robaina is seeking support for the Cuban regime. 
  Uruguay's President Luis Alberto Lacalle received Robaina 
for 
half an hour on 4 April, but made no comments on the meeting. 
Sources close to the president confirmed to EFE that one of the 
things the two officials discussed was the democratization of 
the Cuban regime. 
  Deputies from various parties also made comments in that 
regard. The Congressional International Affairs Committee held a 
one-hour meeting with the Cuban foreign minister behind closed 
doors. Deputies who attended the meeting, as well as members who 
did not, commented on the matter. 
  Out of a total of 12 committee members, three did not 
attend. 
The three said "they did not want to meet with the 
representative of a dictatorial regime." 
  The three legislators absent were Broad Front (leftist 
coalition) Deputy Francisco Rodriguez Camusso; committee 
chairman Oscar Magurno of the Colorado Party of former president 
and new presidential candidate Julio Maria Sanguinetti; and 
Colorado Party Deputy Daniel Garcia Pintos. 
  Among the deputies who attended the meeting, Hector Lezcano, 
of the Christian Democratic Party, said he told Robaina that the 
Cuban Government should "embark on a democratic opening program 
leading, in the near future, to the establishment of a 
multiparty system in the country." 
  Committee member and Colorado Party Deputy Guillermo 
Stirling 
said he attended the meeting because "talking is the best way to 
show leftist and right-wing radicals which is the best path." 
  Robaina answered that Cuba respects human rights, does not 
have political prisoners, and the government is willing to 
preserve the essential characteristics of what was achieved 
during the 34-year period that started on the date of the 
revolution. 
  Robaina admitted that the economic inefficiencies of the 
Cuban system have forced them to open their market to foreign 
investments, adding that economic changes on the island 
"continue day by day," and that today 100 companies already have 
investments in Cuba. 
  It was known that President Lacalle asked Robaina today 
about 
the debt of $33 million the Cuban Government has owed to 
Uruguayan entrepreneurs since 1986. 
  The Cuban foreign minister said that his country does not 
have the cash to pay back that debt, adding that Cuba could 
cancel the debt with pharmaceutical and sanitary products. 
  Robaina will be received today by his Uruguayan counterpart 
Sergio Abreu. The Uruguayan foreign minister has also publicly 
mentioned that he intends to remind Robaina about the need to 
repay the debt. 
  Robaina will stay in Montevideo until tomorrow, and will 
then 
visit Ecuador, Peru, Paraguay, and Argentina within the 
framework of his government's "Latin American offensive." This 
initiative seeks to obtain regional countries' support against 
the U.S. "blockade" and private investments in the island. 
  The Cuban foreign minister's youth and dynamism has prompted 
various communication centers to consider him as "President 
Fidel Castro's probable successor."

<F P=106> [Speech by President Rafael Caldera at Miraflores Palace in </F>
Caracas -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] Easter week has begun with good news. The reopening 
of Banco Latino and the performance of the people involved with 
that organization in the first days of the reopening have been 
truly impressive. They have given us reason to be optimistic. 
Many people involved with Banco Latino have expressed confidence 
in the institution; that is, they have expressed their 
confidence in the steps taken to make it serve the people. Some 
people have renewed their relationships with Banco Latino, thus 
proving that they believe the promise made to account holders, 
depositors, and all those who experienced moments of great 
anguish. A total of 98 percent of the people who had loans up to 
10 million bolivares will receive reimbursement for virtually 
all their rights, properties, and interest. 
  Solidarity and joint efforts by the legislative and 
executive 
branches, the financial system, and all sectors of society have 
made this possible. It proves that solidarity is the answer to 
Venezuela's problems. I must say that in the name of that same 
solidarity, I hope we will soon appoint a banking superintendent 
and president of Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking 
Protection Fund] and that we will also make the urgent 
modifications proposed for the banking deficit emergency law. 
  I must also say that the sacrifice that has been made, 
especially the great financial sacrifice of recovering Banco 
Latino and guaranteeing the financial system in general, was not 
done with money given to bankers, as some people have said. That 
money is to protect account holders and depositors, to prevent 
the same thing from happening to people who are involved with 
other banking institutions, to spare them the anguish of those 
who dealt with Banco Latino. We are making the sacrifice for 
them. Fogade has not contributed that money for nothing. It has 
done so to gain control of those institutions through equivalent 
properties to guarantee the financial system in general and so I 
can say today that Venezuelans can go to banks with the 
assurance that they will not be deprived of what is rightfully 
theirs. 
  I must also say that the punishments meted out to the people 
responsible for the Banco Latino disaster will not be the result 
of passing fancies but of the government's firm, persistent 
resolve; of my administration's pledge to execute every action 
compatible with the domestic and international de jure state to 
apply sanctions to the full extent allowed by circumstances and 
the law. They will serve as an example and keep such incidents 
from happening again. 
  We received more good news in the favorable solution of the 
problem of the soldiers awaiting trial. Practically all of them 
are free, and those who are not will soon be released. Everyone 
implicated in the 4 February action has received a presidential 
pardon in accordance with procedures that had to be maintained 
in deference to the military institutions. Soldiers who have 
returned from abroad are receiving dignified treatment and are 
enjoying freedom. Today I signed a document dropping the charges 
against 20 soldiers who had arrived from Peru and Ecuador. 
Eighteen of them will return to the Armed Forces, and the rest 
will join civilian life, where their civilian and political 
rights will be totally respected. I must say that the vast 
majority of them are convinced that their role is to make a 
positive contribution to our peace efforts. The country would 
not understand if those who have received pardons from 
Venezuela's democratic government were to become negative 
factors, incapable of recognizing, encouraging, promoting, or 
supporting the profound changes in the country. 
  The other problem we face is a very difficult one: the 
fiscal 
deficit. This problem has worsened with the deterioration of the 
oil market. Various factors are involved. Therefore, we must 
accept the measures proposed in the so-called Sosa Plan. This 
plan does not represent the national government's entire 
economic policy. It should be seen, however, as the first step 
in dealing with the problem in the near future. We can assure 
you that the same path followed in these short-term measures 
will be followed in long-term measures. In other words, we will 
maintain the tendency of placing the heaviest burden on those 
who can pay and of diminishing as much as possible the burden on 
those who are experiencing more economic difficulties. 
  Confronting the fiscal deficit and keeping the promise of 
eliminating the value-added tax from sales has undoubtedly 
required a great effort, but there has been great understanding. 
The initiative to establish a special powers law arose in 
Congress. I must admit that I have never favored special powers 
laws. I have often expressed distrust, from a legal standpoint, 
of institutions [institucion] such as these, which have been 
utilized during the past few administrations. In view of the 
situation I face, however, I have no right to tell the nation 
that I reject the powers bestowed upon me to decree, through 
that special powers law, the measures I have proposed to 
Congress and which I consider essential. Therefore, I am willing 
to assume my responsibility. I want to be given full powers. 
Since I have this great responsibility on my shoulders, I must 
have your confidence in taking this step, which is essential to 
implementing the economic policy we want. As we have said 
before, we want an economic policy that will create a 
competitive economy; an economy that will encourage investment 
and admit privatization when it is really advisable. We want an 
economy that will seek stability, that will struggle against 
inflation to meet our goals of reducing interest rates, which 
are so high, and of attaining the necessary monetary stability 
for our economy to prosper. 
  In this framework, we have proposed a bill, which we hope 
will be included in the special powers law, to facilitate the 
construction of large public projects through the contract 
system. We desperately need freeways, buildings, public 
services, and aqueducts, but the country's fiscal situation does 
not allow us to have them. We suffer when we see an urgent need 
for roads and essential services but we do not have the 
resources to make them a reality because our budget situation is 
truly very serious. This law, which will allow us to call 
investors to build these projects and recover their money from 
user payments, is indispensable, fundamental, and essential. 
  Many other sectors require active guidance. For example, we 
desperately need tourism in Venezuela. Few countries in the 
world have Venezuela's positive qualities and propitious 
conditions for establishing a large tourist industry. Among 
other things, we must overcome the difficulties presented by our 
own people who do not understand the importance of tourism. We 
must firmly stop any type of attack, offense, or impropriety 
against tourists. When a taxi driver friend of mine, who has a 
right to improve his standard of living, tries to exploit a 
tourist by charging more than what is fair, he harms not only 
the tourist but the entire country. He is damaging an economic 
activity that the country needs. 
  We will also start to give more and better support to many 
other sectors. Mining is a very large and promising possibility 
in Venezuela. We have to work hard to further this sector. We 
will do so with actions that range from reconsidering the 
current mining laws to reviewing the systems used so far. We 
will also direct our efforts at agricultural recovery. This 
sector suffers from the effects of a number of shock [previous 
word in English] measures that were not implemented reasonably 
or gradually. They have caused damage that is hard to fix and 
which will take a great deal of work to rectify. 
  We are determined to support the small and intermediate 
firms. We will emphasize this sector because it is a large 
source of jobs, and jobs are what the country needs most. 
  There is also the neighborhood program. This program is the 
center of our concerns. We will start to work, with the 
resources we have available, in this sector very shortly. 
  The personal security situation has been a very difficult 
problem. We have, however, made some progress. For example, we 
managed to dismantle powerful bands of auto thieves. We have 
also started a purge process in the police corps. But we cannot 
begin a witch hunt or dismantle a corps that has many honorable, 
capable, and efficient people. The process will continue, and we 
will get the crime rates to drop. We must also reach the 
necessary agreements with state governors and mayors to achieve 
our goals in this sector. 
  The country is changing. There have been profound changes. 
There have been changes in public administration. There have 
been changes in public spending--although they must be 
bigger--as we managed to implement a few measures to cut fiscal 
expenses. The reordering of expenses, however, is a very 
difficult process in an excessively complicated budget such as 
Venezuela's. But we are working on it and we are making progress. 
  This is an austerity government. We have made important 
changes in the Armed Forces. We have made important changes in 
PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum] management, which is the most 
important private economic institution in the country. We are 
solving the jigsaw puzzle. We have an austere government. We 
have a government without thieves. If there are thieves and it 
is reported, they will be investigated, punished, and suspended. 
We do not want to jump into a void. We said this many times 
during our electoral campaign and we repeat it today. The 
country does not want to jump into the void. The country wants 
consistent, firm, permanent actions to achieve positive and 
thorough changes. 
  We are putting the puzzle together. We said more than once 
that Venezuela seemed like a puzzle with some pieces that did 
not fit. We are performing that task. We are cleaning house, 
which is more difficult than anyone can imagine. We want our 
country to prosper. We want our country to be successful and 
prosper steadily, not violently. We want to do it responsibly 
and firmly. To do so, we need the country's trust. 
  The country views with pleasure our message of a commitment 
to solidarity; that is, an economic solidarity commitment that 
can take us to a relative yet necessary and desirable stability 
that will guarantee real wages to fight inflation and that can 
stop the prices of basic necessities and medicines from rising. 
We are exploring all paths to find a remedy to the grave 
situation the population is facing. We need solidarity to 
achieve it. I am optimistic that we will achieve this 
solidarity. Each day we find more ways out of this situation. 
Those who refuse to understand this, those who criticize 
everything, and those who obstruct our goal are becoming more 
outdated by the day. 
  The country wants us to help it surmount this difficult 
situation. I know we are going to do it. The trust that returned 
to the country and that the population showed in view of Banco 
Latino's financial problem is a principle that is filling us 
with hope about the future of Venezuela. 
  I run into many people who ask what they can do. I reply 
that 
you can do a great deal by keeping faith, by promoting 
understanding, and by contributing just a little, because what 
lies ahead of us is big. We will not make it unless everybody 
joins forces. I want to insist on this. That is why I talk of 
the solidarity commitment. The economic theory of this 
government--economy ministers have insisted on this--is that all 
sectors reach a consensus, a basic agreement to ensure that all 
of us can protect ourselves from the anarchic and selfish 
attitude of many groups that want to harm the population. 
Venezuela is first and above us all. Each one of us, including 
the humblest individual, can contribute a lot. When a humble 
person says in front of television cameras that he has faith in 
the future of Venezuela, he is doing a very valuable service. I 
ask my compatriots to continue providing that service. We must 
continue to fight for the Venezuela we all love, for the 
Venezuela that has the full right to receive everyone's 
contribution to give it a better life. Thank you very much.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 5 
April. 
  Venezuelan inflation reached 2.8 percent during March, 
according to a report issued by the Venezuelan Central Bank. The 
source has said the main contributor was household goods, 
followed by food, liquor, and tobacco. In the first three months 
of 1994, accumulated inflation was 9.3 percent, a slightly 
higher figure that that registered for the same period last 
year. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1442 GMT 2 April 94) 
  Venezuelan oil officials have said oil production levels 
will 
remain unchanged. Following two days of discussions in Geneva, 
Erwin Arrieta, mines and energy minister, announced OPEC expects 
to counter falling prices. He also announced that Venezuela has 
nominated Alirio Parra as a candidate for secretary general and 
that the election will be held at the next OPEC conference.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina has announced 
in Montevideo that Uruguay is willing to negotiate [a no 
congelar] Havana's debt with Uruguay and to seek a solution that 
is favorable for both countries. Robaina made these statements 
minutes after his meeting with Enrique Braga, director of 
Uruguay's central bank. 
  Robaina met earlier with Uruguayan President Luis Alberto 
Lacalle, with whom he exchanged ideas on, among other issues, 
the upcoming Ibero-American Summit scheduled to be held in 
Cartagena de Indias, Colombia; the changes being made in certain 
areas of the Cuban economy; and preparations for the conference 
entitled "The Nation and the Emigre Community" scheduled to be 
held in Havana this month. 
  Robaina's agenda included meetings with General Liber 
Seregni 
Mosquera, president of the Uruguayan Broad Front; a very 
interesting meeting with the foreign relations committee of the 
Uruguayan Parliament, where Robaina explained our country's true 
situation; and meetings with Uruguayan intellectuals and Cubans 
residing in Montevideo. 
  Robaina's agenda for today includes talks between foreign 
ministries, a meeting with his Uruguayan counterpart Sergio 
Abreu, and contacts with several Montevideo television networks 
and Uruguay's most important newspapers.

<F P=106> [News conference by Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar </F>
Reyes with domestic reporters and unidentified moderator at the 
Government Ministry in Managua -- live] 
  [Excerpt] We made an appointment with this Nicaraguan 
citizen, and he gave us information that we can relay to you as 
follows: 
  This Nicaraguan citizen said he was coming from Leon, where 
he had been working as a mechanic, when he met two Nicaraguans 
on a bus. The men were friends whom he had known a long time. 
These men told him there was a job in Honduras for which someone 
was willing to pay $80,000. The work consisted of setting fire 
to a paint plant without leaving any trace so the plant owners 
could collect the insurance money. On 7 March, the three men 
went to Honduras, where they contacted the person who allegedly 
had made the proposal. The person was a Honduran citizen named 
Luis Hernandez Sosa, approximately 38 years old. The men 
checked into a Tegucigalpa hotel. 
  The next day they went to a store, owned by an man of Arab 
descent, whom the two men presented as the person interested in 
having the work done. Later, they told this Nicaraguan citizen 
that another meeting would be held on Wednesday. At that 
meeting, the Honduran men told the Nicaraguan that the job was 
not exactly to burn down a paint plant but to kidnap a Honduran 
citizen who had approximately 20 million lempiras in his safe. 
Later, the Nicaraguan and Hondurans went to another place, a 
nightclub. The Hondurans reportedly used a small amount of 
cocaine. During the talks, they said that the work was not to 
kidnap this Honduran businessman but something else, a job that 
paid $400,000: It was to assassinate Honduran President Reina. 
  We contacted the Honduran Embassy on the same day we learned 
of this plan. On 14 March, Honduran authorities sent a special 
delegate to Nicaragua in accordance with a letter that Colonel 
Alvaro Antonio Romero Salgado, chief of the presidential staff, 
addressed to Government Minister Mendieta. This special 
delegate met with the Nicaraguan citizen who gave us the 
information at this ministry. The Nicaraguan citizen was asked 
whether he was willing to travel to Tegucigalpa and identify the 
places where they had been and the people he had mentioned in 
his statements. He agreed. They left on 15 March for Honduras. 
Honduran authorities thanked us for the information. We 
believe it to be our duty to reveal this sensitive information 
to a government and people with whom we have excellent 
relations. Honduran authorities today told us that, according 
to the preliminary investigation in Honduras, a group, probably 
linked to auto theft and most likely to drug trafficking, had 
been active in this connection. 
  According to Col. Romero, the investigations have been 
unable 
to establish whether there was really a plot against President 
Reina. The investigations continue. I want to reiterate that 
the investigations are being conducted by Honduran authorities 
in Honduras. We are willing to cooperate with the Honduran 
authorities in any way we can to fully resolve this case. I 
hereby reiterate our pledge to exchange this type of information 
and any other information of international or national interest 
with all countries; particularly in terms of the plot to 
assassinate the president of Honduras. 
  The Honduran authorities told us that they revealed this 
information today because it was leaked by certain news media, 
but the investigation has not concluded. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] New Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero said this 
morning that public utility rates will be converted into URV's 
[Real Value Units] by 15 April. He also said the date to put the 
new currency, the real, into circulation has not been 
established yet. 
  An agricultural harvest that may hit historical records, 
high 
foreign currency reserves, prices that are gradually being 
converted into URV's at the pace the government expected, and 
workers who received their first salaries converted into URV's 
-- these are just a few of the signals of the economy that has a 
new administrator as of today: Minister Rubens Ricupero. 
  Early today in the program Bom Dia Brasil, the minister said 
in his first interview of the day he was sworn to in his post 
that the current conditions are better than those of the former 
economic plan. 
  In an exclusive interview, the minister said that in the 
next 
few days the government will convert public utility rates into 
URV's, something that must be done before 15 April. According to 
the minister, a date has not been established yet for putting 
the new currency, the real, in circulation. Minister Ricupero 
also said he will control government expenses. As for the 
changes Congress might make in the provisional measure creating 
the URV, Ricupero said he will not accept changes to the 
economic plan such as the possible creation of a salary 
readjustment trigger: 
  [Begin Ricupero recording] We must end the idea that it is 
necessary to perpetuate inflation. We must eradicate inflation 
once and for all and give the government a minimum period of 
time to give it credit so as to allow the economic program to 
demonstrate its advantages. [end recording] 
  Minister Ricupero was sworn in to his new post late this 
morning during a simple ceremony in Planalto Palace. The 
ceremony was held in the office of President Itamar Franco with 
the presence of the ministers of the civilian and military 
households and the environment, Henrique Cavalcanti; the 
presidents of FIESP [Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries], 
the CNI [National Confederation of Industries], and the Chamber 
of Deputies; and former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange will not 
resign as a result of the first ruling on the case of the three 
slain communist leaders. Stange personally informed reporters 
of his decision at Government House after meeting with President 
Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle. 
  The following is a report by Jose Miguel Alfaro: 
  [Begin recording] [Alfaro] President Eduardo Frei and the 
Carabineros director general held a 90-minute meeting amid an 
atmosphere of unusual security measures around the La Moneda 
Palace and great expectation among journalists and the crowd 
that gathered at the door on Constitution Plaza. 
  General Stange arrived at La Moneda a little after 0930 and 
entered La Moneda through the door on Agustinas Street. After 
the 90-minute meeting with the president, Stange went to the 
Government House News Room where Government House correspondents 
were waiting for him. He made the following statement: 
  [Stange] We held an extensive meeting during which he had 
the 
courtesy to listen to me. Therefore, I am not leaving. 
  Judge Juica's ruling suggests that the military courts 
should 
investigate to establish whether or not justice was obstructed. 
  I want to make it perfectly clear that I personally was not 
involved, nor was my name ever mentioned, in the kidnapping or 
killing of the three communist leaders. I want to make this 
perfectly clear. 
  The much-discussed recording does exist. It was recorded 
secretly. I urge people to read the full transcription of this 
tape and not just parts of it. The full transcription of the 
tape clearly shows that the person who made the recording 
reasserts to me he is completely innocent of the charges of 
which he has now been formally charged. Therefore, I urge you 
to read the full transcription of the tape and not just portions 
of it, because this only distorts a perfectly clear situation. 
  Judge Juica investigated this case for many years. If he 
recommends the military courts to investigate who is 
responsible, I will comply with his decision. 
  We are living in a democracy, and anyone can request 
whatever 
he wishes under the law. But it is a completely different 
matter for me to be held responsible for other people's guilt. 
  I have kept quiet precisely to see who wants me to retire. I 
am now responding to some of these extravagant expressions. I 
am not leaving. 
  [Several journalists ask questions simultaneously] 
  [Stange] Thank you very much. [end recording]

  [Text] According to a TIME magazine article, the Clinton 
administration is concerned because a narcodemocracy could be 
forming. The article stated Cali Cartel money is available for 
use in the election campaign. According to the magazine, the 
situation has reportedly led top Clinton administration 
officials to meet with presidential candidates Ernesto Samper 
and Andres Pastrana to warn them about Cali Cartel attempts to 
infiltrate their campaigns. Pastrana has denied such a meeting 
was held. 
  [Begin Pastrana recording] That is information which is 
published in EL TIEMPO today and which was published by TIME 
magazine, but I have no knowledge of this. I am now sending a 
letter to the overseer and to the U.S. ambassador because I 
believe the situation must be clarified. [end recording] 
  Ernesto Samper, meanwhile, admits he did discuss the topic 
with White House officials. 
  [Begin Samper recording] During several meetings I have held 
with State Department officials, we discussed various topics. 
We also talked about campaign financing. [end recording]

  [Text] Montevideo, 2 Apr (EFE) -- The visit by Cuban 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to Montevideo on 4 April has 
divided the Broad Front leftist coalition--the country's 
third-largest political force--and is threatening to cause an 
internal crisis just eight months before the general elections. 
  Diplomatic spokespersons have said that Robaina begins his 
tour in Montevideo that will include Argentina, Paraguay, and 
Peru "seeking to re-insert Cuba into the Latin American 
framework." 
  Francisco Rodriguez Camusso is a veteran Uruguayan 
legislator 
with several decades in Congress who in 1989 was elected deputy 
to represent a group that includes, among others, the 
communists. He said he will not participate in the session of 
the International Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies 
which will receive Robaina on 4 April. 
  The committee comprises seven members; Rodriguez Camusso is 
the only representative of the Broad Front Coalition. He said: 
"I represent the Broad Front bloc on this committee, which fully 
supports the Leninist regime of Fidel Castro." 
  "I totally disagree with this and I would like to strongly 
discuss with Mr. Robaina the violations currently occurring in 
Cuba. This would mean contradicting the majority of my sector 
and for the sake of party discipline I will not participate in 
that session," the congressman added. 
  During the past few months he has been criticized by the 
most 
radical sectors of the Broad Front, which includes socialists, 
communists, Trotskyists, Leninists, independents, and former 
Tupamaro guerrillas, among others. 
  The decision not to participate in the session to honor the 
Cuban foreign minister and the congressman's harsh criticism of 
Castro's regime may provoke an internal crisis within the 
leftist coalition. 
  For the first time ever, the Broad Front in 1989 won the 
municipality of Montevideo where half the Uruguayan population 
live. Mayor Tabare Vazquez, a socialist and doctor, will be a 
presidential candidate in the 27 November elections. 
  The latest polls show the Broad Front currently in second 
place after the Colorado Party, which has traditionally governed 
and which is now the main opposition party ahead of the Blanco 
Party. 
  Robaina, 38, is the youngest foreign minister in Cuba's 
history. He will meet in Montevideo with Uruguayan President 
Luis Alberto Lacalle and with Tabare Vazquez. He will not meet 
with former Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti--the 
leader of the Colorado Party who, according to the polls, is 
most likely to win the elections--because he is currently abroad. 
  During Sanguinetti's presidency (1985-1990), Uruguay renewed 
diplomatic relations with Cuba in October 1985, after a 20-year 
rupture.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Marcano and Ligia Moreno; from "The News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] [Marcano] The National Congress Bicameral Committee 
has approved the report submitted by the Chamber of Deputies 
Finance Committee on the draft of the special powers bill, which 
grants special powers to the president on economic and financial 
matters; thus, the first discussion of this draft bill began in 
the lower chamber. 
  As known, the draft of the special powers bill was presented 
by the Democratic Action Party and was endorsed by the Movement 
Toward Socialism [MAS]. We have consulted both sides, given the 
draft bill will be approved within days. 
  [Begin recording] [Carmelo Lauria, president of the Chamber 
of Deputies] We maintained in the Finance Committee that it was 
necessary to give the government special powers, so it could 
quickly approve its tax reform; this was in response to what the 
government has raised, that the current economic situation had 
led it to suspend economic guarantees, something that is never 
desired. In addition, the finance minister had said if the tax 
law was not approved quickly, super-devaluation could occur. 
  [Segundo Melendez, director of the MAS parliamentary wing] 
We 
believe that in such circumstances approval of this law must be 
expedited, so the government can adopt whatever decisions are 
needed; in addition, we have pointed out that because the 
opposition has admitted the seriousness of the crisis we are 
experiencing and the urgency of it all, it is necessary to have 
these powers expanded in general to include economic matters. 
[end recording] 
  [Marcano] Regarding the special powers bill, the Social 
Christian Party, COPEI, established its position yesterday in 
the National Executive Committee. Our colleague Ligia Moreno has 
the following report: 
  [Moreno] COPEI, through the National Committee, expressed 
its 
total support to the president of the Republic. The National 
Committee of COPEI agreed to vote for the inclusion of the tax 
measures in the special powers law; this would generate more 
revenue and cover the tax on wholesale activities, the tax on 
luxury products, the law granting concessions for public 
projects, and modify when the national public income and 
expenditure budget would have to be presented, bearing in mind 
the reforms to the tax code and income tax law. 
  [Begin recording] [Jose Curiel, COPEI secretary general] 
These measures are important but require a supreme will on the 
government's part to have them carried out. COPEI is ready to 
lend its support, as it has done in the past, to join this vast 
agreement. [end recording] 
  [Moreno] Jose Curiel said bringing Venezuela out of its 
current crisis is a task for all Venezuelans, and, therefore, 
his party is supporting the existing system in our country.

<F P=106> [By Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim] </F>
  [Text] The priority that Brazilian foreign policy has 
traditionally attached to relations with Latin America is today 
a constitutional principle. A natural consequence of our 
geography, this priority is also linked with historical and 
cultural factors and the existence of sizable joint 
undertakings. Within the economic-commercial area, relations 
with Latin American countries are equally intense. Brazilian 
trade with ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] 
countries accounts for 25 percent of our foreign trade. 
  This remarkable increase in the commercial flow toward Latin 
America has occurred in the middle of a process marked by the 
consolidation of regionalization and globalization of the world 
economy and the exhaustion of the import replacement model in 
Brazil. The conclusion of the Uruguay round of GATT [General 
Agreement on Trade and Tariffs] talks has brought prospects for 
strengthening the multilateral system of commerce. At a 
regional level, the implementation of NAFTA has made it even 
more obvious that it is necessary to accelerate the 
consolidation of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and the 
implementation of the proposal for a South American Free Trade 
Area (SAFTA). 
  Few times in history have been so favorable for promoting 
cooperation with Latin American countries. The general 
predomination of democratic governments is the foundation for 
political coordination among the countries of the region and for 
the emergence of political forums like the Rio Group. This 
democratic atmosphere has to a considerable extent contributed 
to overcoming old regional distrust and rivalry. 
  Among the initiatives aimed at strengthening confidence 
among 
the countries of the region is the understanding between Brazil 
and Argentina, which concluded with the signing of the 
historical Quadripartite Agreement of Nuclear Safeguards. The 
approval of a set of amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty and the 
Declaration of Mendoza, which was signed before the Treaty for 
Proscription of Chemical Weapons, are also part of that context. 
  Brazil has developed a tradition of confidence that pervades 
our relations with all South American countries. The fact that 
Brazilian diplomacy has been traditionally based upon the 
principles of self determination, non-interference, and respect 
for international law, has helped strengthen the reliability of 
the country before its neighbors. We have also attained 
valuable diplomatic achievements, which are represented by 
agreements like the River Plate Basin Treaty, the Amazonas 
Cooperation Treaty, the Treaty of Montevideo (ALADI), and the 
Treaty of Asuncion (Mercosur). 
  Among the matters to which Itamaraty is attaching top 
priority, I would mention first the negotiations over Mercosur 
and the promotion of SAFTA. The liberalization process within 
Mercosur is moving forward as scheduled, with strong, positive 
impact on commercial exchange between the four partners, which 
has practically tripled since the signing of the Treaty of 
Asuncion. As of 1 January 1995 a free trade zone will come into 
force in the Mercosur zone. 
  The proposal for the creation of SAFTA, which President 
Franco announced at the last presidential meeting of the Rio 
Group, has been welcomed, as I could see at the 8th ALADI 
Council of Ministers' meeting and, more recently, during a 
meeting with the economy and foreign ministers of Mercosur 
countries. 
  At the bilateral level, high-level political contacts have 
substantially intensified. President Itamar Franco met abroad 
with Presidents Carlos Menem, Luis Alberto Lacalle, Rafael 
Caldera, and Cesar Gaviria. He attended the inauguration of 
Presidents Juan Carlos Wasmosy and Eduardo Frei, making valuable 
contacts with those chiefs of state. He met in Brasilia with 
the presidents of Argentina, Uruguay, and Guyana, and with the 
then presidents-elect of Bolivia and Paraguay. In my capacity 
as head of Itamaraty, I visited Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, 
and Bolivia. 
  This intensification of the meetings with top authorities of 
neighboring countries has healthily diversified the mechanisms 
for consultation and coordination, and the integration programs. 
Standing mechanisms for regular consultation have recently been 
instituted between Itamaraty and the Argentine Foreign Ministry. 
A high-level Binational Commission was also created to 
coordinate the work on various cooperation projects with 
Venezuela. At a recent meeting in Leticia, Presidents Itamar 
Franco and Cesar Gaviria installed the Brazilian-Colombian 
Neighborhood Committee. The consideration of border problems in 
those forums serves as a safeguard against the undesirable 
politicization of matters that are more directly important for 
local communities, opening prospects for cooperation whose 
potential had not been properly developed. 
  In this spirit, Itamaraty has extended decisive support for 
the initiatives aimed at promoting physical integration and the 
integration of the power generation sectors with neighboring 
countries, either at a multilateral level, like the 
Paraguay-Parana waterway, or at a bilateral level, like the 
Brazil-Bolivia gas pipeline. This set of initiatives proves 
that Latin America is not merely a diplomatic option for Brazil. 
It is an area for priority action, to which the Brazilian 
Government should devote top attention in permanent contact with 
civilian society.

  [Text] Brasilia -- At the end of his five-day visit to the 
PRC on 5 April, Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said Brazilian-PRC 
relations have reached the dimension of "strategic partnership." 
Amorim was received by President Jiang Zemin and vice premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, among several other 
high-ranking Chinese officials. He negotiated an agreement on 
principles about aerospace cooperation, which will be signed by 
President Itamar Franco in May during his official visit to 
Beijing. 
  One of Minister Amorim's most fruitful meetings was the one 
with Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the state Economic and 
Trade Commission. Zhongyu showed special interest in a joint 
venture [two preceding words in English] project at Carajas 
[Para State]. The project involves the construction of a 
deep-water port in the PRC with the capacity to receive large 
cargo (300,000 metric tons) vessels. Minister Wang also showed 
interest in Minister Amorim's request that special attention be 
given to Brazilian companies' desire to participate in PRC 
biddings in the areas of infrastructure and telephone systems. 
  Brazil and the PRC, which are celebrating the 20th 
anniversary of their diplomatic relations' resumption, are 
intensifying cooperation in the scientific and technological 
fields. Brazil proposed the reactivation of the bilateral 
agreement for cooperation in the nuclear field, which was signed 
in 1984, and reiterated the importance of the project for the 
construction of ground observation satellites (CBERS 
[China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite] Program).

  [Text] The Workers Party (PT) has decided to change its 
campaign strategy in light of Progressive Renewal Party Paulo 
Maluf's decision not to run and of the launching of Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso Brazilian Social Democracy Party as the 
anti-Lula candidate. Coordinators of Luis Inacio Lula Da 
Silva's campaign believe that Cardoso, supported by the Liberal 
Front Party and by the Brazilian Labor Party, will be the elite 
groups' candidate and that, therefore, a polarization of the 
election is inevitable. The PT will intensify its attacks on 
the economic plan and on Cardoso as the main target of its 
criticism. 
  Until former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia is confirmed 
as the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party presidential 
candidate in May, the PT will not make any attacks on him. 
Lula's campaign coordinators believe Maluf's decision not to 
run could have stemmed from a behind-the-scenes accord with 
Quercia. PT campaign official Greenhalgh believes Maluf has 
backtracked because those who always supported him have endorsed 
Cardoso's candidacy. "All the partners of Paubrasil [which 
contributed to Maluf's campaign] have been consulted," he 
ironically said. Until now, the PT has harshly criticized 
Maluf. From now on, the PT tone will change and its criticism 
against Cardoso will intensify. 
  The PT no longer considers Cardoso the third alternative, 
having moved up to second place and become Lula's main 
adversary. Greenhalgh added: "Cardoso has time and again 
disappointed the people by telling them to forget what he said 
earlier and by deciding to run without worrying about the future 
of the plan." He was thus anticipating the PT line of attacks 
against Cardoso. Within this new strategy, the PT will insist on 
securing the support of Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola, 
(Democratic Labor Party).

  [Text] Brasilia -- The five golden diplomats of Finance 
Minister-designate Rubens Ricupero are ready to leave the 
Planalto Palace annex building and occupy offices on the fifth 
floor of Block P of the Ministries Esplanade where their chief 
will be installed on 5 April. "But we will not go there with a 
tape measure to complain about the size of the offices or to 
choose secretaries," diplomat Sergio Danese, 39, warned. Danese 
will be responsible for contacts with the press. According to 
him, integration with former Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso's team is so complete that it has even been established 
that Ambassadors Julio Cesar Gomes dos Santos, adviser, and 
Synesio Sampaio Goes, chief of staff, will continue at the 
Finance Ministry for an indefinite period of transition time. 
  Sergio Amaral -- Rubens Ricupero refers to Second Echelon 
Minister Sergio Silva do Amaral, 49, as "my alter ego." A 
mountain bike addict, Amaral practices this sport near his 
summer home at Pirenopolis (Goias State), 170 km from Brasilia. 
Sao Paulo-born Amaral will be promoted to ambassador before the 
end of the year. He was a Planning Secretariat adviser while 
Deputy Delfim Netto (Progressive Renewal Party-Sao Paulo) was 
finance minister and a foreign debt negotiator during Mailson da 
Nobrega's days at the head of the Finance Ministry. He has a 
PhD in political sciences from the Sorbonne. He advised Rubens 
Ricupero while the latter was in Geneva negotiating with GATT 
and while Ricupero was ambassador in Washington. Currently, he 
is executive secretary at the Environment Ministry. He will 
implement the economic program together with the economic team. 
  Marcos Galvao -- Marcos Bezerra Abbot Galvao, 35, defines 
himself as a New York Potiguar [indigenous group from Rio Grande 
do Norte]. He is an ambassador's son, is making fast progress 
in his diplomatic career, and is appreciated by his colleagues. 
Galvao used to draft former President Fernando Collor's 
speeches, and is Ricupero's only adviser not born in Sao Paulo. 
Galvao was a student in Ricupero's first class; he was the top 
student in his course at the Rio Branco diplomatic school. He 
acted as his professor's adviser from 1980-82, but only met him 
again at the Environment Ministry. He will be in charge of 
writing Ricupero's speeches. 
  Estanislau Amaral -- Business Administrator Jose Estanislau 
do Amaral Souza Neto graduated from Getulio Vargas Foundation 
and was top student at the Rio Branco diplomatic school. He 
left Itamaraty for one year to help his father-in-law manage a 
Sao Paulo group working in the field of sugar and fuel alcohol. 
Of the five advisers he knows most about economics, after 
Sergio Amaral. While in Brasilia he also became an expert in 
human rights. He will help write Ricupero's speeches and advise 
him on political matters. 
  Sergio Danese -- Ricupero's future public relations officer 
is a writer. Sergio Franca Danese, 39, has a masters degree in 
Ibero-American literature from the University of Mexico. He is 
the author of "The True Story of the Dodo Bird," a bestseller 
among Ricupero's advisers in its second edition from the 
Brasiliense publishing firm. He was also a top student at the 
Rio Branco diplomatic school. Danese has worked with Ricupero 
for longer than any of the other advisers: from 1981-87. In 
addition to literature, Danese likes to operate airplanes, 
although he does not have a pilot's license. 
  Debora Barenboim -- Debora Vainer Barenboim, 34, lived in 
Paris between the ages of 18 to 29, and only returned to Brazil 
to study at the Rio Branco Institute. During the diplomatic 
course she met Danese, to whom she has been married for 14 
years. She is a pianist, has worked in the Foreign Ministry's 
economic area, and served at two diplomatic posts abroad with 
Danese. She will be one of Ricupero's spokespersons before 
Congress. 
  [Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese publishes on 4 April a 
200-word unattributed article on page 16 noting that Sergio 
Amaral "will be the Finance Ministry's chief of staff."]

<F P=106> [Article by Cristiano Romero] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- Following a suggestion by former Finance 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Federal Administration 
Secretary Romildo Canhim, President Itamar Franco decided to 
withdraw an article from the provisional measure restructuring 
the Budget and Finance Secretariat and the Public Spending 
Control Secretariat, which increases the salaries earned by 
officials of both secretariats who have been on strike for more 
than one month. The president also decided to change the 
provisional measure into a bill. 
  This decision has aggravated the impasse caused by the 
strike, which has particularly impaired the amendment of the 
1994 budget bill and the investigation of corruption charges in 
various public bodies. Another consequence of the impasse is 
that without the budget, newly designated Finance Minister 
Rubens Ricupero will be unable to create the new currency, the 
real. 
  During a tense meeting with representatives of the public 
servants on 30 March, Franco said he recognized the employees' 
right to strike, but he warned that if the strike continues the 
government will adopt the "appropriate measures" to design the 
budget. In retaliation, unions will not hold meetings to decide 
on the government proposal until 6 or 7 April, thus delaying an 
eventual return to work even more. 
<H5>  Squandering </H5>
  Finance and control analysts and budget technicians, all of 
them high-ranking officials, earned salaries ranging from $460 
to $827 in February. With the new increase, the largest salary 
will stand at $1,600 this year and $2,300 in 1995. In an attempt 
to convince Franco of the importance of restructuring the 
Internal Control Secretariat -- a process also known as Cisetao 
-- the civil servants delivered a dossier charging that the 
government squandered $47.4 billion over the past six years 
because of lack of controls and misuse of public funds. 
  Cardoso's position during the meeting, at which Canhim 
recalled that 13 other public servant categories are striving 
for improved salaries, showed that he, Cardoso, backed down on 
the position he had upheld so far. The provisional measure was 
drawn up by members of his team who estimated that increasing 
salaries for those civil servants will cost the Treasury 
approximately $50 million in 1994. In justifying the provisional 
measure's text, Cardoso himself admitted that Cisetao is an 
important supplemental measure for the economic plan since it 
will again give the government the possibility of controlling 
public spending and fighting corruption.

  [Text] Havana, 5 Apr (PL) -- Today, the official daily 
GRANMA warned about the magnitude and advanced technology of the 
announced U.S. military maneuvers in Atlantic waters, commenting 
that such exercises complicate the situation in the hemisphere. 
  GRANMA, mouthpiece of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC), 
said 
that once more the Atlantic and east coast of the United States 
will be the scene of the Fleetex 2/94 Combined Exercise, whose 
operational goal is the effective coordination of naval, air, 
and ground forces in fulfilling different integral missions. 
  The U.S. Government, under the guise of calming residents 
worldwide over possible deployment of its military forces, has 
announced that the maneuvers are "routine" or "innocent 
exercises," the newspaper indicated. 
  GRANMA added that it is very difficult to understand this 
idea and, even more, passively contemplate the scene when this 
supposed innocence includes approximately 13,000 soldiers (2,000 
are Marine Corps assault forces); 23 warships, including one 
nuclear aircraft carrier; and more than 100 attack and transport 
planes. 
  GRANMA explained that according to spokespersons for the 
U.S. 
State Department, the new exercise has as its main objective the 
approval for a large part of these forces to transfer to Europe. 
  The advanced technology of nearly all of the Fleetex 2/94 
Exercise forces contradicts the common saying "there is a big 
distance between what is said and what is done" because any 
change in course or increase in velocity would reduce any 
distance, particularly if it is a short distance, the newspaper 
remarked. 
  The announced participation of an Argentine destroyer and a 
submarine should be pointed out. Argentina is in fact joining a 
dangerous military buildup in regions very distant from its 
natural bases, GRANMA concluded.

  [Text] Havana, 1 Apr (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Relations 
Minister Roberto Robaina today applauded Colombian President 
Cesar Gaviria's recent election to the post of OAS secretary 
general. 
  Robaina participated in a meeting held as part of the First 
International Conference on High Performance (CIAR) that began 
in Havana on 28 March and which is scheduled to end tomorrow. 
  Upon concluding the presentation of a paper on the 
importance 
of Cuban sports delegations and other international political 
issues, Colombian delegate Alex Villa asked Robaina his opinion 
about President Gaviria's election as OAS secretary general. 
  Robaina emphasized that "Gaviria's election is quite 
stimulating because, in the past, that organization has been 
used as an instrument by some, and the Colombian president can 
help keep it from being manipulated." 
  The head of Cuban diplomacy described Gaviria as a wise and 
capable politician and very interested in Latin American 
integration, which could prompt the OAS to become an advocate 
for the continent's poorest sectors. 
  The foreign minister indicated that Cuba finds nothing 
inappropriate about returning to the OAS, but emphasized that it 
is necessary to wait for an invitation because the island was 
expelled and therefore has no reason to knock on any doors. 
  Robaina also noted the Colombian president's political 
courage in being the primary advocate of reestablishing 
diplomatic relations between Colombia and Cuba, which is a "sign 
of the winds of Latin American integration that are blowing in 
these times." 
  Referring to reports of an alleged Colombian guerrilla 
summit 
in Havana, Robaina said some ill-intentioned person had 
attempted to sabotage relations between the countries, but truth 
fortunately prevailed and time has proven us right.

<F P=106> [Article by Tomas A. Granados: "OAS: Looking for New </F>
Clothes"] 
  [Text] Just like an old lady getting ready for a love 
affair, the OAS is looking for modern clothes and attractive 
makeup as if to try and erase the unpleasant memories of its 
past coexistence with military dictatorships and U.S. invasions. 
  The only thing new up to now is its secretary general, 
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, who was elected to this post 
on 27 March following an unusually difficult race against Costa 
Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus. 
  Gaviria, who will have to wait until the end of his term in 
office on 7 August before assuming the leadership of the OAS, 
trusts that the hemispheric organization will begin a new 
chapter of relations "respecting the path chosen by each 
country...without the disagreements and controversies of the 
past." 
  The truth is that these are new words, perhaps a preview of 
what could be a readjustment of this regional mechanism to the 
new post-Cold War realities, something the United States should 
also seek with all its Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. 
  But Gaviria's statements seem to head down a path different 
from that of the theories of U.S. officials linked to this 
region, such as Michael Skol, regarding a "hemispheric 
convergence." 
  According to the assistant secretary of state for 
inter-American affairs, this convergence is understood as a way 
to identify with the fundamentals of Washington's foreign 
policy, in other words: the protection of national security, 
fomenting economic growth, and encouraging democracy in the 
world. 
  In statements during a 23 February news conference in Miami, 
Skol did not say whether the national interests of neighbor 
countries would be included in this convergence. But he did say 
that Washington is planning to establish "a relationship in 
which talks and reciprocity, rather than unilateralism, would be 
foremost." 
  After the East-West confrontation was buried under the ruins 
of the Berlin Wall and since the days of Washington's crusade 
against the advance of communism in that part of the world has 
changed, this could be the time for the OAS to try and win the 
credibility it never enjoyed. 
  Toward this end, a majority of countries of the region 
supported Gaviria, some of them dragged (Foreign Minister 
Niehaus said pressured) by U.S. influence. Michael McCurry, a 
spokesman for the U.S. State Department in Washington, explained 
that the Colombian president "has proven to be committed to 
democracy, to have solid economic policies, to be a strong 
leader, and to have the capacity to lead." 
  Now, the former Fresno, California lyceum student faces the 
not so easy task of recovering the trust the OAS lost in the 
eyes of several generations of Latin American politicians 
because of its indolence before the outbreaks of military 
dictatorships and complicity with the U.S. invasions in the 
Dominican Republic (1965), Grenada (1983), and Panama (1989), as 
well as its incapacity during the Falklands conflict (1982) 
between Argentina and Great Britain. 
  He will also have to do something to solve the OAS' lack of 
prestige, as expressed when in 1983 countries like Mexico, 
Panama, Venezuela, and Colombia chose to disregard it and form 
the Contadora Group as the forum for the discussion and solution 
of the Central American conflict. 
  This move, considered to be the first genuinely Latin 
American initiative without U.S. participation, was followed by 
the creation of other groups in which the White House is not 
represented, such as the Rio Group, and since 1991, the holding 
of the annual Ibero-American Summit conference. 
  According to the opinion of various Latin American foreign 
ministries, Gaviria will have the task of developing the image 
of "a new OAS," immersed in consolidating democracy on the 
continent, dedicated to promoting American integration, and 
willing to become the center for dialogue that will draft the 
basic guidelines for continental policy. 
  Even though methods for the crusade against communism in 
this 
part of the world are a thing of the past, today, the 
expectations are in confirming if "this new OAS" will be able to 
adjust itself to the needs of development and the struggle 
against poverty in the region being sidetracked by controversial 
theories of "limited sovereignty, humanitarian intervention," 
and "preventive democracy." 
  These theories were put into practice for the first time in 
Somalia where thousands of U.S. soldiers played a starring role 
under the protection of the United Nations. But after the 
setbacks suffered by those troops in early October 1993, 
Washington understood that regional groups like the OAS must 
play a more active role in this type of operations, whether 
these operations are intended to maintain peace or to supervise 
the reestablishment of constitutional order. 
  Military and diplomatic experts broached this subject during 
a meeting in mid-March in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The OAS 
called the meeting to discuss new measures related to 
hemispheric security and its results could lead to the creation 
of a new regional military mechanism that will replace the old 
structures of the Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty, 
TIAR, and the Inter-American Defense Board, IADB. 
  Previously, a special meeting in Washington in mid-December 
1992 approved an amendment to the OAS Charter, sponsored by 
Argentina, opposed by Mexico, and Jamaica and El Salvador 
abstained, to the OAS Charter that allows the "suspension" of 
any member state that disregards the democratically-established 
norms. 
  The OAS Charter calls for respect for the principles of 
sovereignty and self-determination of the peoples. Gaviria will 
now be responsible for proving the practical value of these 
precepts or seeing if they are just words.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 4 Apr (PL) -- Colombian Foreign 
Minister Noemi Sanin has said she is pleased with the meeting 
she held with her Cuban counterpart, Roberto Robaina, during a 
stopover he made on his way to Uruguay, where today he started 
an official visit until 6 April. 
  Robaina, who met with Sanin for 30 minutes tonight, is 
making 
an official visit to Ecuador, Peru, and Argentina. He will also 
make an unofficial visit to Paraguay, a country with which Cuba 
has yet to establish diplomatic relations. 
  In statements made to PRENSA LATINA and a Radio Rebelde 
journalist accompanying the Cuban delegation, the Colombian 
foreign minister reiterated that she will visit Havana on a date 
that will be set soon. 
  She added that both she and Robaina are satisfied with the 
Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO newspaper, which publicly 
acknowledged it published unfounded information on an alleged 
meeting between Colombian guerrillas in Havana. 
  As for the unfounded report, Sanin pointed out that she will 
meet with Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff soon because his 
office apparently provided reports that said an alleged former 
guerrilla and an aide to the late drug trafficker chief Pablo 
Escobar attended a meeting in Havana.

  [Text] Montevideo, 4 Apr (PL) -- Uruguayan President Luis 
Alberto Lacalle met today with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina, who is on an official visit to this South American 
nation as part of a regional tour. 
  Robaina met with the Uruguayan president at his private 
residence, where the two men exchanged ideas on the upcoming 
Ibero-American Summit to be held in Cartagena, Colombia, as well 
as Cuba's economic changes. 
  During the meeting, the Cuban foreign minister explained to 
Lacalle about preparations for the conference "The Nation and 
Emigration," to be held in Havana from 22 to 24 April with the 
participation of 200 representatives of the nucleus of people 
who have emigrated from the island and settled in approximately 
20 nations. 
  The foreign minister also met with Enrique Braga, director 
of 
the Central Bank of Uruguay, to discuss the possible payment of 
the Cuban foreign debt, estimated at over $30 million. 
  Robaina indicated it was possible to find a favorable 
solution for both nations after he explained that Havana could 
supply Montevideo with specific items (medicines and medical 
equipment). He announced the upcoming visit of high-level Cuban 
banking officials to initiate negotiations. 
  Robaina also met with General Liber Seregni, president of 
the 
Coalition of the Broad Left Front, and legislators, who are 
members of the Uruguayan parliament's foreign relations 
commission. 
  According to the agenda, talks between the Cuban foreign 
minister and his colleague Sergio Abreu will begin tomorrow. 
  On Thursday, Robaina will continue his tour to Ecuador, 
Peru, 
and Argentina. He will conclude his trip with an unofficial 
visit to Paraguay, a nation with which Cuba does not have 
diplomatic relations.

<F P=106> [Report by Javier Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 30 Mar (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina disclosed today that a large number of the 
invitations to the approaching meeting with representatives of 
the exiled community have already been answered favorably, which 
guarantees the meeting's success. 
  During an encounter with national and international media, 
Robaina said that even though political affiliations are not 
expected to dominate the meeting, scheduled to take place at the 
end of April, "there will be lots of color" in its composition. 
  The foreign relations minister explained that issues to be 
analyzed jointly with the emigres evolve solely around 
immigration matters, but the meeting is a door that is being 
opened and a bridge leading to future meetings. 
  He immediately rejected the possibility that the meeting 
could be negatively affected by positions adopted by those 
groups headquartered in the United States, which he described as 
hysterical. Robaina pointed out that the gathering constitutes 
a meeting between those Cubans of goodwill living overseas and 
those living on the island. 
  In another part of his statements, he referred to relations 
with the United States, explaining that Cuba is always willing 
to accept any economic arrangements provided Washington does not 
attach any preconditions. 
  Robaina explained: We maintain excellent economic ties with 
numerous countries that have political systems different from 
our own. Regarding the United States, we do not want to have 
such abysmal differences exist as a result of an obstinate 
attitude that has not changed, except for the dropping of the 
aggressive language used in the past. 
  The foreign minister also criticized the U.S. decision to 
exclude Cuba from the so-called continental summit to take place 
in Miami at the end of this year. 
  We must evaluate the real intentions behind this type of 
meeting, Robaina stated, and if it is in any way related to 
interest in isolating a country that in no way accepts 
conditions. 
  The Cuban foreign minister also expressed satisfaction with 
the results of his recent trip to several Asian nations and 
indicated that he was able to determine these nations' interest 
in Cuba's sugar, education, and public health experiences. 
  He added that the nations visited expressed interest in 
investing in areas such as crude oil, nickel, textile industry, 
and much more. 
  Robaina confirmed that on Monday he will be heading to South 
America in answer to invitations from the Governments of 
Argentina, Uruguay, Ecuador, Peru, as well as an unofficial 
visit to Paraguay.

<F P=106> [By (?Javier Rodriguez)] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 6 Apr (PL) -- Cuba reaffirmed today its 
willingness to identify and resolve the problems affecting Cuban 
emigres, within the framework of the conference that will bring 
together in this city even opponents of the political system 
that prevails on the island. 
  Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Bolanos told the local and 
foreign press that the meeting, called "The Nation and 
Emigration," to be held in Havana from 22 to 24 April, will 
begin a process that will normalize relations between nationals 
living abroad and the authorities of the Caribbean nation. 
  Bolanos confirmed, as PRENSA LATINA reported yesterday 
evening, that old politicians and members of organizations 
opposed to the country's revolutionary process were invited to 
participate in the meeting, something that will broaden its 
scope. Many have agreed to come to Havana. 
  Among those are Roberto Carballo and Luis Tornes, former 
members of the invading brigade defeated at the Bay of Pigs in 
1961; Ricardo Gonzalez and Vicente Crespo, of the so-called 
Cuban Committee for Democracy [Comite Cubana por la Democracia]; 
and Rafael Huguet, Bernardo Benes, and Manuel Castro, of the 
Cuban Change [Cambio Cubano] (CC) organization. 
  Other guests from the opposition segment living in the 
United 
States are Max Lesnik, a Miami politician and press commentator, 
and Patricia Gutierrez, a CC member and daughter of the group's 
top leader, Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo. 
  When asked about the possible participation of Gutierrez 
Menoyo, Bolanos explained the Cuban Government understands he 
has dissented from those who sponsor or defend the U.S. blockade 
against Cuba. 
  "We have our thoughts on that position, and although he has 
not been invited yet, he could be included on the list if that 
were the case," he added. 
  The list of participants drafted by the Foreign Ministry 
(Minrex) also included Angel Fernandez Varela, who years ago 
headed a radio station for anti-Cuban propaganda, and former 
military man Raul Barandella. 
  The deputy foreign minister noted that the participants must 
have, as a common denominator, a concern for resolving the 
problems related to emigration and interest in the country's 
current situation. They must not set political conditions for 
participating in the conference. 
  We seek to bring together and find formulas for dialogue 
that 
do not harm anyone and to which all can contribute, the official 
indicated. 
  He then noted that it is precisely for that reason that 
people belonging to different organizations opposed to the Cuban 
process or who come of their own accord, but who are respectful 
of the country, have been included. 
  Bolanos affirmed there will be time for comment on all 
topics 
during the conference and that two-thirds of the more than 200 
guests will come from the United States on account of the number 
of Cubans living in that country. 
  Topics discussed during the 1978 dialogue, left to be 
reflected on or unsettled, will be resolved now, as well as 
other topics, Bolanos noted. 
  In reply to another question, the official left to the 
conference the matter of Cuba's recognition of dual citizenship, 
although he admitted the country will submit proposals on this 
and other issues to the consideration of the participants. 
  He confirmed that Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; Ricardo 
Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's 
Government; Abel Prieto, president of the Union of Writers and 
Artists; and Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of 
State, will deliver major speeches that can serve to open the 
debates. 
  The Cuban delegation to the conference will comprise 60 to 
70 
Minrex, Cuban Friendship with the Peoples Insitute and Interior 
Ministry officials and experts, intellectuals, and scholars.

  [Text] Washington D.C., 4 Apr (PL) -- Today, the United 
States recognized Cuba's cooperation in the struggle against 
international drug trafficking in a U.S. State Department 
document on the issue. 
  In an annual report on worldwide drug production and 
trafficking, the U.S. Government corroborates that Cuban 
authorities continue placing top priority on their anti-drug 
policy, and it also indicates that Cuba cooperated with the 
Unites States in this area in 1993. 
  According to Washington's opinion on how the nations of the 
world are meeting the commitments made at the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention, the report contends Cuba is engaged in a struggle 
against drugs, despite the island's problems of fuel shortages 
and the lack of spare parts, all of which limit Cuba's capacity 
to combat drugs. 
  Cuba is a signatory of the UN convention on this issue and 
has signed bilateral agreements with many nations in the region 
to fight the scourge of drug trafficking. 
  Also, in 1988 it declared its willingness to sign an 
agreement of this type with the United States, an offer which up 
until now has been ignored by Washington. 
  Cuban cooperation in this struggle includes the interception 
of planes and ships in its airspace and territorial waters as 
well as supplying information to U.S. services in charge of 
confronting this problem. 
  The United States is the world's largest drug consumer, and 
the report admits that although cocaine continues to be the main 
threat to U.S. drug users, the danger of the use of heroine is 
growing at an alarming rate.

  [Text] Havana, 2 Apr (PL) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro 
has met with Hao Jianxiu, PRC deputy minister in charge of the 
State Planning Commission, who represented the PRC at the Sixth 
Session of the Mixed Inter-Government Commission in Havana. 
  According to a GRANMA report, the interview allowed the two 
sides to exchange opinions on the future development of 
bilateral economic relations and took place in a cordial and 
friendly atmosphere, which is the primary feature of relations 
between Havana and Beijing. 
  GRANMA points out that on Friday, both sides concluded 
another successful round of Mixed Commission talks, at the end 
of which the Chinese deputy minister and Cuban Foreign Trade 
Minister Ricardo Cabrisas proceeded to sign a protocol that 
encompasses commercial trade goals for 1994. 
  The PRC delegation, which is headed by the high-ranking 
official, arrived in Havana last Sunday and has signed four 
other mutual cooperation agreements. The agreements are aimed 
at increasing the amount of Chinese food and medication being 
sent to Cuba in exchange for sugar. 
  According to GRANMA, Hao Jianxiu provided Fidel Castro with 
a 
full explanation of the situation in China in light of the 
agreements arrived at during the 14th CPC Congress. At the same 
time, Fidel Castro sent warm and fraternal greetings to PRC 
President Jiang Zemin and to State Council Premier Li Peng in 
response to the best wishes sent by that Asian nation's leaders. 
  Carlos Lage, secretary of the Executive Committee of the 
Cuban Council of Ministers, and Cabrisas represented Cuba at the 
meeting. 
  The newspaper adds that each countries' respective 
ambassadors, Jose A. Guerra Menchero and Xu Yicong; other 
members of the Chinese mission; and representatives of Chinese 
enterprises involved in economic relations with Cuba were also 
present during the meeting. 
  The Caribbean island is Beijing's No. 2 trading partner in 
Latin America. In 1993, trade between the two countries 
surpassed $400 million and included the sale of Chinese rice, 
bicycles, and machinery spare parts in exchange for Cuban 
nickel, biotechnology products, citrus products, and sugar.

  [Text] Havana, 1 Apr (PL) -- Commercial relations between 
China and Cuba were boosted today with the signing of agreements 
aimed at strengthening the shipment of food and medicine from 
Beijing to the island in exchange for sugar. 
  The agreement was signed at the conclusion of the Sixth 
Session of the Mixed Intergovernmental Commission which was 
presided over by Cuban Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas. 
Hao Jianxiu of the Chinese Planning Commission served as vice 
chairman of the meeting. Hao arrived in Havana on Sunday. 
  The high-ranking officer described the agreement as positive 
and told the press that he is aware of the difficult economic 
situation Cuba is confronting, which translates into serious 
cutbacks in supplies and services for the people. 
  Without going into detail on the protocol that has just been 
signed and which encompasses commercial trade goals for 1994, 
Cabrisas said the most important thing is that these agreements 
ensure the future development of cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  During the meeting, four documents for bilateral cooperation 
were signed including the final document of the meeting. 
  The Chinese delegation was received by Carlos Lage, vice 
president of the Cuban Council of State and the person 
responsible for supervising Cuba's economic activities, as well 
as other high-ranking officials from the light, steel, food, and 
sugar industries. 
  Cuba holds second place in Latin America in terms of trade 
with China. These trade activities exceeded $400 million in 
1993. 
  The Chinese have sold rice, bicycles, and even machinery 
spare parts to Cuba in exchange for Cuban nickel, biotechnology 
products, citrus products, and sugar.

<F P=106> [By Silvio J. Mendiandua] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 31 Mar (PL) -- Relations between Cuba and 
Mexico are diverse, exhibit mutual respect, and have a very 
encouraging future in terms of joint ventures and 
technical-scientific cooperation, Mexican Ambassador Carlos 
Tello asserted here today. 
  The diplomat said he was optimistic about the future of 
bilateral ties with Cuba after having assumed responsibility for 
the Mexican mission in Havana in February. 
  Tello, who is an economist and a professor with a 
comprehensive professional vitae, revealed he had already 
attended several economic and technical-scientific cooperation 
meetings in the few weeks he has been in Cuba. 
  Regarding reciprocal assistance, he said a mission from the 
Mexican Science and Technology Council had recently visited Cuba 
and signed an agreement with the State Economic and 
Scientific-Technical Cooperation Committee to increase 
scientific ties. 
  According to this agreement, oceanographers, engineers, and 
other specialists have agreed to carry out joint studies and to 
help each other in specific projects. 
  Furthermore, the ambassador added, active exchanges between 
the universities of the two countries are continuing and a 
history seminar for specialists was held just a few days ago. 
  To give one example of developing relations in the field of 
education, Tello noted that a group from the clinic school, 
which travels to different parts of the world, recently visited 
Cuba to exchange student experiences. 
  Asked about Mexico's response to Cuba's policy on opening to 
foreign investments, Tello said this area is very promising, and 
he revealed there are agreements to set up joint ventures to 
produce cement and glass. 
  We are currently negotiating two very important agreements, 
the ambassador stressed. One is a comprehensive agreement on 
telephone systems, satellite communications, telex, fax, and 
other communications systems which could amount to more than $1 
billion. [PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 2023 GMT on 1 April 
transmits a similar report prefaced with a parenthetical note 
asking PRENSA LATINA offices to "substitute" the new article for 
the one printed here. The new report is identical to the first, 
with two changes. The first is a rewording of this paragraph so 
that it reads: "We are currently negotiating an agreement on 
telephone systems, satellite communications, telex, fax, and 
other matters related to this field, the value of which could 
exceed $1 billion, the ambassador said." In addition, the 
following paragraph has been deleted and the item continues with 
paragraph 11.] 
  The other is the signing of a letter of intent between the 
Cuban Government and Mexpetrol to refine approximately 60,000 
barrels of crude oil at the Cienfuegos refinery, located in the 
country's central region, as well as to manufacture byproducts 
that will be sold in the domestic and international markets. 
  In terms of tourism -- an industry in which the Mexicans are 
giving advice to the Cubans -- Mexico and Cuba have signed 
agreements to operate hotels such as the Tuxpan, Granma, and the 
Old Man and the Sea. 
  Likewise, Carlos Tello explained that Cuba provides medical, 
biotechnology, and social security assistance to Mexico. 
  Also, both nations continue to exchange experiences, 
expertise, and specialists in agriculture, fisheries, and sugar 
production, which has resulted in mutual benefits. 
  The diplomat expressed regret over the current level of 
trade, which totalled approximately $124 million in 1992, and he 
indicated that there are obstacles, like Cuba's debt with Mexico 
and the shortage of freely convertible currency. 
  The fall of Eastern Europe's socialist bloc was a hard blow 
to the Cuban economy because 85 percent of the island's trade 
was conducted with this region, a region from which it also 
imported 90 percent of its crude oil. 
  Tello stressed that when these difficulties are overcome, 
trade between the two countries will increase several times over.

  [Text] Havana, 4 Apr (PL) -- A delegation of Mexican 
deputies, who are visiting Cuba, is planning to exchange 
experiences with Cuban deputies and hear about the revolutionary 
government's policy on youths, it was officially reported in 
Havana today. 
  According to Ramon Pez Ferro, an official of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], the group is headed 
by Deputy Anial Pacheco Lopez, who has distinguished himself in 
the Mexican parliament, and includes Agustin Basabe, president 
of the Border Affairs Commission, Alberto Monteverde, Juan 
Adrian, and Alfonso Ribera. 
  The visitors will meet with Deputy Foreign Minister Isabel 
Allende and Lazaro Barredo, acting president of ANPP's 
International Relations Commission. The delegation's agenda 
includes meetings with leaders of the University Students 
Federation and the Union of Young Communists [UJC], meetings 
which will acquaint them with the Cuban reality and inform them 
of the activities of the younger Cuban generations, Pez Ferro 
said. 
  The Mexican deputies attended the local all-star baseball 
game at the Latin American Stadium in Havana to commemorate the 
UJC anniversary, the leading organization of young Cubans, on 4 
April. 
  The Mexican deputies' visit to Cuba is part of a program 
between the assemblies of the two countries to improve and 
expand their relations. 
  Rodolfo Becerril, president of the Mexican Chamber of 
Deputies International Relations Commission, visited Cuba in 
February to initiate a program for exchanging experiences during 
1994 between deputies of the two countries.

  [Text] Havana, 4 Apr (PL) -- Today, official sources 
reported Argentine Secretary of State Alberto Lestelle is in 
Cuba to sign an agreement on drug addiction and drug trafficking. 
  The National Information Agency reports that Lestelle said 
the Cuban and Argentine Governments agreed to sign a formal 
mutual assistance protocol in which both parties will be jointly 
responsible in combating this problem, which transcends their 
national borders. 
  The Argentine leader said that, after months of working 
together with the Cuban Justice Ministry, Argentina has 
identified points of mutual interest in which they can cooperate. 
  He added that Argentina has been implementing a mutual 
assistance program on the American continent and many 
governments have requested assistance to train specialized 
personnel. 
  He noted that this has been done in Costa Rica, Guatemala, 
and the Dominican Republic, and he announced this will soon be 
established in Honduras and Nicaragua.

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Elena Gil] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 31 Mar (PL) -- As of next week, Cuba will 
have a diplomatic mission in Barbados. From there and as part of 
the process of integrating into its geographic surroundings, 
Cuba will promote commercial, cultural, and athletic relations 
with the entire eastern Caribbean. 
  Just before leaving for Bridgetown, Cuban Ambassador Lazaro 
Cabezas told PRENSA LATINA that the Barbadian Government's 
decision to authorize the opening of a Cuban Embassy in its 
territory was further confirmation of the Caribbean countries' 
willingness to integrate the largest of the Antillean islands 
into the region where it rightfully belongs. 
  "Cuba and Barbados have had diplomatic relations since 8 
December 1972, but based on our country's rapprochement with the 
Anglo-Caribbean community (Caricom) [Caribbean Common Market], 
we now have the opportunity to establish a Cuban mission in 
Bridgetown, Cabezas said. 
  He reported that the main purpose of his activities in 
Barbados and as concurrent ambassador to the eastern Caribbean 
region will be to strengthen economic and commercial relations 
with the region and promote cultural and athletic ties, for 
which there is excellent raw material in the Caribbean and a 
considerable amount of experience in Cuba, he added. 
  Cabezas explained that one of his goals is to implement a 
sports and cultural cooperation agreement signed with Barbados 
in 1983 but never put into affect. 
  The ambassador announced he will present his credentials to 
the Grenadian Government on 5 April. Cuba reestablished 
relations with that country in March 1992. Relations between the 
two countries cooled as a result of the events surrounding the 
overthrow and murder of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and the 
subsequent 1983 U.S. military invasion. 
  Cabezas is accredited as concurrent ambassador to the 
Governments of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Bahamas, St. 
Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago. 
  The only Caricom members yet to normalize relations with 
Cuba 
are Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua, and Barbados. As of 
this past December, Cuba has maintained a joint commission 
before Caricom. 
  At the beginning of the current decade, the Cuban Foreign 
Relations Ministry launched a diplomatic offensive in the 
Caribbean that was crowned by the reestablishment of diplomatic 
relations with nearly all Caricom pact members and Cuba's 
admission into the organization's cooperation mechanisms. 
  The climax of the regional rapprochement was Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina's official seven-nation tour this past 
November. On that occasion, Robaina stated that the region has 
become one of Cuba's foreign policy priorities. 
  Cabezas said that at the end of April, Cuba will participate 
in the First Global Conference on Sustainable Development by 
Small Insular States, which is sponsored by the United Nations 
and is scheduled to take place in Barbados. 
  He added that Cuba expects to participate in the event with 
the best proposals prepared by the country's social, scientific, 
and ecological nongovernmental organizations. In addition, Cuba 
expects to share its achievements in areas of common interests 
with its sister nations.

  [Text] Havana, 31 Mar (PL) -- Mark A. Entwistle, the 
Canadian ambassador to Cuba, said today that his country's 
businessmen will increase their investments in Cuba. He also 
reexpressed his government's opposition to the U.S. blockade of 
the island. 
  During an interview given to GRANMA newspaper, Entwistle 
said 
commerce is the most active sector in the relations between the 
two nations because the Canadian private sector is showing 
growing interest in the economic opportunities offered by Cuba. 
  Canadian businessmen are beginning to observe growth 
potential in the Cuban economy in areas such as tourism, mining, 
and oil. In some of these areas, Canadian businessmen are 
already participating, and in others, the investment prospects 
are very interesting, he said. 
  The ambassador observed that Cuba occupies fifth place in 
his 
country's commercial relations with Latin America as trade with 
Cuba amounted to $370 million in 1992, and shows a tendency to 
grow. 
  Canadian businessmen foresee Cuba possibly being a bridge 
between South America and the Caribbean and estimate that 
possible associations with the Cubans will project them into the 
future, Entwistle added. 
  The ambassador also ratified his country's disapproval of 
the 
U.S. blockade against Cuba and asserted that U.S. attempts to 
have third countries implement this policy are not being 
accepted. 
  It is very simple, he said; the United States has a policy 
on 
Cuba, and Canada has its own policy on Cuba. 
  For Canada, he added, from our political perspective, Cuba's 
isolation is harmful. Our interest is to contribute to creating 
a climate that will allow for improved relations between the 
countries in the hemisphere.

  [Text] Havana, 4 Apr (PL) -- Today, Joe Jacob, vice 
president of Ireland's lower house, began the second day of his 
visit in which he is expressing his solidarity with Cuba and 
exploring the possibilities for broadening commercial and 
cooperation links. 
  Cuban parliament sources told PRENSA LATINA that Jacob is 
heading a delegation comprising five parliamentarians whose goal 
is to encourage good relations between the two countries and to 
continue broadening them. 
  The parliamentarians will meet with Jose Ramon Balaguer, 
member of the Council of State of the Communist Party of Cuba; 
Isabel Allende, vice minister of foreign relations; and Carlos 
Salsamendi, president of the Chamber of Commerce. 
  Official sources noted that the visitors expressed their 
desire to seek ways to strengthen relations between the 
legislative bodies of the two nations. 
  During their stay, which will continue until 10 April, the 
visitors are also interested in learning about the tobbaco 
industry as they explore areas in which Ireland and Cuba might 
broaden trade relations. 
  The Irish delegation will visit Pinar del Rio Province, 
Cuba's westernmost province, as well as public health, 
agricultural, and sports centers. Public health, agriculture, 
and sports are areas in which they will study prospects for 
broadening and diversifying cooperation.

  [Text] Havana, 1 Apr (PL) -- Zambian Foreign Minister Remmy 
Kaindu Gilly Mushota said here today his country and Cuba have 
reached important cooperation agreements in trade and other 
areas. 
  During a news conference, the foreign minister said the 
cooperation will include the sugarcane industry, education, 
sports, social areas, and international relations. 
  During his five-day tour, the foreign minister negotiated 
the 
terms of a technical assistance agreement, which includes Cuban 
specialists constructing a sugar mill in Zambia. 
  Gilly Mushota announced that during his next trip to Cuba, 
Zambian President Frederik Chiluba will sign sugarcane industry 
agreements and that his country will finance all the operations. 
  Concerning education, in the last 10 years approximately 73 
Zambian students completed their college education in Cuba, and 
six were graduated as midlevel technicians. 
  Forty-three Zambian youths are enrolled in different schools 
in Havana, Santiago de Cuba, the second largest city in the 
country, Camaguey, Santa Clara, and the nickel-mining town of 
Moa, in the eastern province of Holguin. 
  The visitor and Julio Teja, Cuban public health minister, 
discussed the increase of medical assistance to that country, 
where 22 Cuban doctors are already practicing. 
  The Zambian foreign minister also said the National 
Institute 
for Sports, Physical Education, and Recreation will contribute 
in training Zambian athletes for the African, Commonwealth, and 
Olympic Games, with the arrival of trainers for track and field, 
boxing, baseball, and other disciplines. Cuba will receive 
soccer coaches, a very popular sport in Zambia. 
  Concerning the peace dialogue between the Angolan Government 
and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, which 
is being held in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, he said agreements 
have been reached over the main topics, including the military 
topics. 
  Concerning the upcoming elections in South Africa, the first 
multiracial elections there, he said he expects a democratic 
process, but he said it will not totally resolve the culture of 
violence that was brought to the region by the "abominable 
system of apartheid." 
  "Another peace process will have to take place so that 
whites, mestizos, and blacks can achieve a national 
reconciliation," he said. 
  Gilly Mushota, who traveled to Cuba accompanied by his 
counterpart, Roberto Robaina, left for Jamaica today as part of 
his Caribbean tour.

  [Text] Havana, 2 Apr (PL) -- With positive results for the 
Cuban-Zambian bilateral ties and economic cooperation, Zambian 
Foreign Minister Remmy Kaindu Gilly Mushota ended his visit to 
Cuba today. 
  Mushota, who was invited by his colleague Roberto Robaina to 
visit Cuba, negotiated cooperation agreements in the sectors of 
sugar industry, agriculture, education, public health, sports, 
and international relations. 
  The building of a sugar mill in Zambia by Cuban 
professionals 
in Zambia, scheduled to start in 1995, was one of the agreements 
discussed during this visit. It was reported that the agreement 
will be ratified by Zambian President Frederick Chiluba on his 
next visit to the Caribbean nation. 
  An increase in the number of Cuban physicians sent to 
Zambia, 
the continuation of the studies of 43 Zambians in local 
education centers, and the exchange of sports trainers were 
other issues discussed by Mushota and Cuban officials. 
  Regarding possible pressure from international financial 
institutions and the United States to block Chiluba's announced 
visit, the foreign minister said in a news conference that his 
is an independent and sovereign country and its development 
programs are not established in Washington. 
  He added that negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank 
had ended, precisely the previous evening, and Zambia was to 
receive a $150-million loan to promote its economic programs. 
  "They are our partners in cooperation, not our owners. 
President Chiluba will come to Cuba with Zambian money and not 
with money from the IMF," Mushota observed. 
  The two countries started to strengthen their bilateral ties 
on 19 June 6572 [year as received], when diplomatic relations 
were established. During his two-week visit to Cuba, Mushota 
visited places of scientific, historic, and cultural interest in 
Havana and the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba, before leaving 
for Jamaica on Saturday, to continue his tour of the Caribbean. 
  The Zambian territory, which has 174,000 square km, is 
mostly 
covered by a plateau that runs from the Malawi tectonic trench 
to a swampy region bordering Angola. It is the world's third 
largest producer and number one exporter of copper and has other 
important mineral resources.

<F P=106> [Article by Brasilia "special correspondent" Elia Simeone R.] </F>
  [Excerpt] Latin American governments will alert U.S. 
President Bill Clinton to the need to enhance relations with 
that country and to work in greater concert with one another to 
solve the problems confronting the hemisphere. 
  The request will be submitted to the U.S. President during 
the summit of the Americas' heads of state, which has been 
called by Clinton himself in Miami at the end of this year. 
  This resolution by Latin American governments was adopted 
during the meeting of Rio Group foreign ministers, which ended 
here in Brasilia on 22 March. 
  The agreements reached at this meeting were publicized on 22 
March by the three foreign ministers who make up the troika of 
the Rio Group, namely, Brazil, Chile, and Ecuador. 
  Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, in his capacity as 
pro tempore secretary, highlighted that the Rio Group resolved 
to start a process of consultations and coordination in order to 
present a united front at the Miami summit. 
  Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa stated that one of 
the agreements included the aforementioned need for closer 
political relations between the United States and Latin America, 
which will be raised for Clinton's consideration. 
  He said that within this framework, subjects of common 
interest like the strengthening of democracy, governability, 
hemispheric security, drug trafficking, and terrorism could be 
tackled in a more appropriate way. 
  The foreign ministers also agreed to call Clinton's 
attention 
to the social development issue, Latin American countries' 
efforts to combat poverty, the need to introduce changes in 
Latin American countries' education systems, and to have greater 
access to technology. 
  The Brazilian foreign minister noted that some of these 
questions were briefly touched upon during U.S. Vice President 
Al Gore's visit to Brazil on 22 March, which only lasted for a 
couple of hours. 
  With regard to Latin American governments' expectations of 
the Americas' summit, Figueroa said the meeting's objectives are 
not very clear since the letter Clinton sent to his Latin 
American counterparts does not state what the United States 
expects from this summit meeting and only mentions his interest 
in drafting a common agenda. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Caracas, 6 Apr (AFP) -- Claudette Werleigh, foreign 
minister of Haiti's constitutional government, will explain her 
country's political situation to representatives of 
international organizations and ambassadors to the Latin 
American Economic System (SELA), it was reported Wednesday. 
SELA headquarters are in Caracas. 
  SELA spokesmen said that representatives of the World Bank, 
the Inter-American Development Bank, the OAS, UNESCO, the 
International Organization for Immigrants, and the UNHCR will 
attend the meeting. 
  The ambassadors from Barbados, Grenada, Guyana, Suriname, 
Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica will also attend. 
  During the last SELA Latin American Council held in Caracas 
in October 1993, representatives of the 27 member states signed 
a solidarity declaration with the Haitian people expressing 
their "deep concern for the lack of constitutional order in that 
country." 
  The Council recommended that the SELA Permanent Secretariat 
"follow up on the situation in Haiti and remain alert so upon 
restoration of constitutional rule," a cooperation program can 
be immediately implemented.

  [Text] Havana, 5 Apr (AFP-NA) -- Argentina and Cuba signed 
an agreement in Havana on 5 April that contemplates mutual 
bilateral assistance for the repression of drug trafficking, the 
prevention of drug addiction, and an exchange of information 
between security organizations. The document was signed by Cuban 
Justice Minister Carlos Amat and Argentina's Secretary of State 
Alberto Lestelle. 
  Lestelle said Cuba "has important traffic by large (drug) 
producers in the south and important traffic by large consumers 
in the north." The island "still does not have consumption 
problems but is facing incipient trafficking problem," the 
secretary added. Cuban Justice Vice Minister Zenaida Osorio, who 
was mentioned by PRENSA LATINA, said: "The development of 
tourism and the opening of the country to foreign investors 
might also attract traffickers." 
  Secretary of State Lestelle, the highest ranking Argentine 
federal authority on the repression of trafficking and addiction 
prevention, after signing the agreement said the document will 
enable the exchange of information between specialized security 
organizations from the two countries. For this work, Lestelle 
said Argentina uses the National Maritime Prefecture and the 
National Border Police. 
  Lestelle said that under the "mutual agreement," an ad-hoc 
committee has been created -- it members will be appointed later 
-- to define the way this information cooperation and exchange 
will operate. The agreement also covers social assistance and 
the legal aspects of trafficking repression and consumption 
prevention. Lestelle said that in the Central American and 
Caribbean region, Argentina has similar cooperation agreements 
with Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, and Guatemala and similar 
proposals are being negotiated with Nicaragua and Honduras.

  [Text] Montevideo, 6 Apr (AFP) -- Today, the Cuban 
Government reaffirmed its willingness to engage the United 
States in an unconditional dialogue, but in fact the only 
condition must precisely be an absence of prerequisites. At the 
conclusion of a three-day visit to Uruguay, the foreign minister 
from Havana, Roberto Robaina, pointed out that there is 
currently "no sign" that would lead us to expect a possible 
lifting of the economic and commercial blockade that has 
burdened the island for over three decades. 
  "We are not now holding talks with the United States, (but) 
are willing to engage in a dialogue on any issue. We do not 
even have to start with the blockade," the Cuban minister said. 
"What we have said is that we would hold talks under one 
condition: that there be no conditions," added Robaina, who is 
the obvious leader of a diplomatic offensive launched by the 
island to attract private investors. 
  The foreign minister, 37, said at a news conference that "if 
the idea is to hold talks based on prerequisites, there would be 
no chance of us participating in any talks." Robaina pointed 
out that "my country has nothing to give in exchange for an 
unjustly imposed blockade." He added that both OAS votes and a 
genuine willingness to invest in Cuba are needed to end it. 
  As for his government's policy of promoting investments, 
Robaina assured that even Cubans in exile will have an 
opportunity to participate in the opening up process. "Cuba 
cannot say that it is opening itself up legally to capital 
investment from all quarters without opening itself up to Cubans 
who left the country," the foreign minister said. He added that 
"when we say that investment possibilities are available to 
everyone we mean everyone." Robaina pointed out that this calls 
for a gradual process as well as the establishment of a climate 
of trust in the foreign investor within a framework of broad and 
flexible regulations that excludes no one. 
  The minister also commented on the economic problems facing 
the island in the wake of the "surprising" demise of the 
socialist bloc. He said that "although there is no variety on 
our tables," the basic nourishment of our population is ensured. 
He pointed out that in view of the dilemma caused by this 
situation, Cuba has only two options: "Renounce its achievements 
or decide to ignore their essence and adapt in order to survive 
under current conditions and with principles that are essential 
to us." 
  The foreign minister said that the collapse of socialism was 
not the only thing that affected the expectations of the regime 
that has ruled the island since 1 January 1959. He admitted 
that mistakes that led to the current situation included 
excessive reliance on foreign aid and the neglect of important 
production sectors like agriculture. In this regard, he pointed 
out that the preferential relations that Cuba enjoyed with the 
Soviet bloc had ended and voiced Cuba's willingness to 
participate in a restructuring process leading to the 
establishment of new ties. 
  Robaina also talked about exiles and noted that a meeting 
will be held on the Isle of Youth from 22 to 24 April with 
representatives of the diaspora from about 60 countries. He 
pointed out that the government plans to establish a "normal 
path" to ensure that exiles "cease to be the instrument for 
hostile policies against the island." The foreign minister said, 
"I think that certain things involve healthy interests (because) 
many Cubans of goodwill, who are all over the world, want to 
maintain normal relations with their homeland." He added that 
the important thing will not be the meeting itself but its 
results.

  [Text] For Cuba as well as for those Cuban emigres who 
maintain an open and respectful attitude toward the Revolution, 
it is no longer acceptable to continue the abnormal ties of the 
past few decades. This was a statement by Foreign Vice Minister 
Jorge Alberto Bolanos during a news conference on 6 April with 
Cuban and foreign journalists to discuss preparations for the 
forthcoming conference, The Nation and the Emigre Community, to 
be held 22-24 April. 
  Bolanos added that the meeting will be for friends only and 
will include a broad cross-section of the emigre community, 
including representatives of the right. Bolanos pointed out that 
the only ones excluded are those who maintain a hostile attitude 
toward their fatherland and who advocate a dirty war and the 
U.S. blockade. 
  Bolanos also stressed that the participants will be people 
capable of making positive contributions to the Cuban emigre 
community and to their ties with Cuba. He added that the April 
meeting is not an isolated event, but a continuation of the 
dialogue begun in 1978, which seeks to find answers to issues 
left unresolved then, as well as to new issues. Bolanos 
announced that over 200 invitations have been sent and that 
positive responses have been received. Over 170 emigres are 
expected to attend the conference. 
  The conference's four main subjects will be addressed by 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; Ricardo Alarcon, president of 
the National Assembly of the People's Government; Abel Prieto; 
and Carlos Lage.

Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] There are no problems in relations between Uruguay 
and Cuba. We are working toward strengthening those relations, 
Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu said following a meeting 
with his Cuban counterpart Roberto Robaina. 
  Abreu said relations between Havana and Montevideo center 
around trade, politics, and cooperation. In that sense, he 
confirmed his government's plans to expand trade relations with 
Cuba and to seek common political positions in international 
law, such as self-determination, nonintervention in the internal 
affairs of nations, and the peaceful solution of internal 
conflicts, principles that now exist in bilateral relations 
between Uruguay and Cuba. 
  Cuban Foreign Minister Robaina gave Abreu a broad 
explanation 
on the steps Cuba has taken to find a viable national economic 
model. Both foreign ministers agreed that Havana's debt with 
Montevideo, estimated at $33 million, should be frozen. They 
also agreed that a climate of dialogue, initiatives, and 
prospects should be promoted that will permit, for example, the 
reactivation of the Uruguay-Cuba commercial commission and the 
visit to Cuba of a group of Uruguayan businessmen interested in 
commercial activities. The invitation was formally extended a 
few hours after Robaina met with members of the Uruguayan 
Industrial Chamber of Commerce. Today's agenda for the Cuban 
delegation included meetings with organizations for solidarity 
with Cuba and leaders of the main political parties. 
  Uruguayan journalists have followed Robaina everywhere. 
Today, all the newscasts as well as the [words indistinct] 
radio stations and daily EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO ran exclusive 
interviews. The main news on Montevideo's channel four was 
Robaina strolling through the streets of the capital and being 
greeted by taxi drivers, students, or newsboys as they 
recognized him.

  [Excerpts] Good evening to all Cubans. There are absolutely 
no problems whatsoever in relations between Uruguay and Cuba. We

Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu said following a meeting with his 
Cuban counterpart Roberto Robaina. [passage omitted] 
  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez gave a broad

that there was no greater policy changes in Cuba than those 
taking place in the economic sphere. 
  The two foreign ministers noted that there should be no

  [Text] Cuba is neither the hell they make it out to be nor 
the paradise it wishes to be; it is, rather, the work of men 
with both virtues and defects, affirmed Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina on 5 April in Montevideo. 
  Either of these two affirmations is prejudicial to us 
because 
neither is believable, said Robaina, who began an official 
two-day visit to Uruguay on 4 April within the framework of a 
South American tour that also includes Argentina, Paraguay, 
Ecuador, and Peru. 
  In speaking to the International Affairs Committee of the 
Uruguayan parliament, Robaina maintained that political changes 
are associated with systems and that the conditions for such 
changes do not exist in Cuba today. Robaina cited sovereignty, 
independence, and the ability to speak with one's own voice as 
nonnegotiable principles. Unacceptable, too, are any solutions 
that would mean backsliding in the spheres of education, health, 
the sciences, and sports. 
  Touching upon the subject of human rights, Robaina stressed 
that Cuba has an extremely clean past, and he affirmed that the 
nation can display the very strong reality of not having people 
disappear, get assassinated, or be tortured.

  [Text] On 6 April, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
addressed the committee of representatives of the Latin American 
Integration Association [ALADI] headquartered in Montevideo. 
Robaina's address to the plenum committee affirmed that with the 
previous broad process of Latin American integration, it is 
possible to achieve integration of hemispheric magnitude, 
averting the danger of neocolonialism. He added: 
  [Begin Robaina recording] Let us work to join the 
subregional 
processes toward a Latin American dimension. Let us attain a 
regional consensus on social, economic, and political issues 
aimed at Latin America's integration and our fair insertion in 
terms of economic and international relations. Let us seek to go 
further by progressively integrating production and service 
sectors. Scientific and technological cooperation would also be 
an instrument vital to the integration process. [end recording] 
  Referring to Cuba's reality, Robaina told the ALADI 
committee 
that Cuba's economic problems will not be solved with foreign 
investments only, but that the main solutions are Cuba's 
programs for development and efforts to increase production and 
exports. Robaina asserted that today, everything in Cuba is open 
to discussion at every level, except Cuba's sovereignty, 
self-determination, and particularly, the accomplishments of its 
social project. 
  Robaina closed his address to the ALADI committee by 
requesting the confidence of our Latin American brothers 
because, and I quote: We have already done what is possible; we 
are now doing the impossible; for miracles, we ask only for a 
bit more time.

  [Excerpts] Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu said, 
shortly after meeting with his Cuban counterpart Roberto Robaina 
in Montevideo, that there are no difficulties in the relations 
between Cuba and Uruguay. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez 
has 
said that Robaina will make an unofficial visit to Paraguay in 
the next few days. Ramirez added that Paraguayan President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy will not be able to receive Robaina because he is 
traveling in Europe, and that he himself, Ramirez, will not be 
able to receive Robaina either, because he is leaving today for 
Morocco to participate in the signing of the agreement on the 
Uruguay Round of the GATT. 
  Diplomatic relations between Havana and Asuncion do not 
exist 
at the present time, but Robaina's presence in Paraguay is 
considered the first reflection of the intention toward 
rapprochement between Paraguay and Cuba.

<F P=106> [Report by Barbara Betancourt from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] To conduct foreign politics from within the country 
is still the goal that encourages the Cuban Foreign Ministry to 
organize tours through different territories. The latest tour 
was to the special municipality of the Isle of Youth, where 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived with 60 heads of 
missions accredited in Havana. 
  [Begin recording] [Robaina] I believe everyone in the 
country, particularly the diplomatic corps, has always been 
interested in the work performed on the island. I believe that 
to become familiar with the island, one must do it from within 
and with its people. Nothing is more important than the 
explanations the people personally give. I believe the example 
we saw today, when the diplomats were able to stop and talk with 
whomever they wanted on the streets about whatever they wanted, 
is an example of what Isle of Youth residents can do; therefore, 
the best message is, above all, about pledges, not formal 
pledges but, rather, only a real pledge that only by working can 
we solve our problems and find the option we truly need. There 
is no need to explain this to Isle of Youth residents. The 
people on the Isle of Youth are doing it. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you know.... [pauses] Did you 
know, before you came to the island, the people on the Isle of 
Youth had already decided they wanted to host the 26 July 
celebrations next year? 
  [Robaina] I learned about it because certain media are 
already talking about this issue. I believe, first of all, it 
is an important pledge that reflects the Isle of Youth people's 
decision. I believe it is a decision, desire, and hope backed by 
hard work and achievements. If we could hope for something, on 
a personal basis, it is that they successfully achieve their 
goals. 
  [Reporter] I understand that out of the five tours that have 
been made throughout the country, this tour has had a 
peculiarity: direct contact with the people. What is your 
evaluation of this point? 
  [Robaina] I believe each tour has its own appeal. This tour 
has the island's attention and includes the possibility and 
privilege of enjoying a neighborhood and family atmosphere, 
among other things. If the island is like this normally, I see 
no reason why it should be different for this tour. I believe 
this is the most important thing, to show the way you really are. 
  [Reporter] We heard you talk about your diplomatic 
offensive. What does that term mean? 
  [Robaina] I think we have talked about a diplomatic 
offensive, and we think a diplomatic offensive can involve a 
stage in which it is necessary to increase a specific activity 
in connection with the absence or role of the media. I believe 
once that phase has been completed we must talk about a 
permanent diplomatic offensive in which we tell the world what 
we want the world to know rather than answer questions. We get 
tired of going around the world, answering questions, because 
Cuba also has many questions to ask and has much to say even 
though it is not asked. [end recording] 
  Robaina gave those statements to local journalists upon 
concluding the visit to the Isle of Youth, where he and members 
of the diplomatic corps visited the main areas of economic 
interest in the territory, El Abra Farm-Museum, the 
reconstruction work carried out at Nueva Gerona's historical 
sector, the Presidio Modelo Museum, and one of the 60 rural 
schools in the municipality.

  [Excerpts] Exercise Giron-94, an exercise that has to do 
with the Unified Vigilance and Protection System [SUVP] and 
confronting crime of all kinds, is under way in the city of 
Havana. Indeed, this exercise is also under way [5 second break 
in reception]. In Guantanamo, this SUVP, crime confronting 
exercise is called Guerrillero-94. 
  Well, as part of Giron-94 in the city of Havana, NTV carried 
an illustrative report on this matter of confronting crime in 
the city of Havana. Let's listen to that report: 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] There were 40 
sacks containing a detergent the nation has earmarked for 
recovering hard currency [para la recuperacion de divisas]; hard 
currency that becomes raw materials for producing cleaning 
products very necessary for society's consumption. Thus, this 
was a theft that conspired against the citizenry's basic 
solutions, and one by means of which seven individuals would 
enrich themselves, had they managed to get the 500 kg of 
detergent into the underground market. But the police stopped 
them and returned the 40 sacks that exited through the factory 
doors without any documentation to the (Sergio Sierra Cabrera) 
Factory, formerly known as the (Sabatez) Factory. 
  The accused, Esteban Rodriguez Talaveras, Victor Manuel 
Valdez Gonzalez, Armando Luis Ploche Torres, and Angel Llane 
Mendez, took advantage of negligence in the production area to 
move the merchandise, which they left hidden in the stockroom 
until it was put into a closed vehicle, which exited the plant 
through the gate, without being searched by the guards. [passage 
omitted] 
  It was the job of Jose Dabian Ramos, Edilberto Rodriguez 
Bote, and Lazaro Ruiz Cutino to sell the product on the 
underground market. The police seized the merchandise from them 
at a private residence in Cerro Municipality. The matter does 
not appear to be over, for surely the enterprise (Suchel) [name 
as heard] has a control system that should prevent anyone from 
diverting resources. For that reason, the investigation 
continues. [end recording]

  [Text] The first and only technological promotion center 
was dedicated today in Los Tinajones in Camaguey. For those 
companies, organizations, or institutions that are interested in 
promoting changes, in transforming the management of their 
scientific activities in the quest for more efficient service, 
the first technological promotion center was dedicated in 
Camaguey. 
  This scientific and technical institution is headed by 
experts, who since 1987 have been working in the management and 
organization of the territory. They offer qualified and reliable 
services. This is a center which groups a small team of 
researchers and consultants, who must systematically work in the 
companies promoting technological development and new 
experience. It is a center that must fight to establish a style 
of work which is totally new, a dynamic and agile style to solve 
problems which are closely related to the companies' main 
activities. 
  This center is based on a continuous exchange of 
technologies 
and experience with similar organizations, both in Cuba and 
abroad. It has modern equipment for processing, storing, and 
transmitting information. It will also work as a consulting firm 
and a supplier of technological and commercial information, and 
in personnel training programs. 
  In a first test program, it has offered services to several 
companies, such as a cement factory, the Camaguey tourism 
company, and the production scientific institute. The opening of 
this technological promotion center will meet the basic demands 
for organizational changes and will strengthen the institutions.

  [Text] Guadalajara, 6 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Nicaraguan 
President Violeta Chamorro denied she had fainted in 
Guadalajara, as has been reported by some media. "I am well and 
I do not wish anyone harm," the Nicaraguan president said upon 
leaving the hotel where she is staying in this city while 
participating in the forum entitled; "Women in the Americas; 
Participation and Development." 
  Armando Morquecho, government spokesman for the western 
state 
of Jalisco, said Maria Magdalena Zeco de Posadas, wife of 
Uruguay's representative to the IDB, was taken to the emergency 
room at Del Carmen Hospital. Morquecho explained that Ignacio de 
Posadas, Uruguay's representative to the IDB, had accompanied 
his wife to the hospital, where she was transferred to the 
emergency ward for treatment for an asthmatic-bronchitis attack. 
Morquecho said the commotion at the hotel occurred at the same 
time that the Nicaraguan president was arriving, thus causing 
confusion and giving rise to reports that Chamorro had fainted. 
  Chamorro will participate this afternoon at the forum's full 
session, where the theme will be: "The road to Beijing, 
preparations for the Fourth Women's Conference."

<F P=106> [Interview with Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro by </F>
Jacobo Zabludovsky, at the Hotel Presidente on 4 April; from the 
"24 Hours" newscast --live] 
  [Text] [Zabludovsky] Mrs. Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the 
president of Nicaragua. Good evening, madam. 
  [Chamorro] Good evening, Don Jacobo, I am delighted to hear 
you again here in Mexico, after your visit to Nicaragua. 
  [Zabludovsky] Thank you for granting us this interview. 
  [Chamorro] It is a pleasure, my friend. 
  [Zabludovsky] Madam, President Salinas welcomed you today, 
and you spoke. What did you discuss? 
  [Chamorro] You know, Don Jacobo, my dear friend, that when 
colleagues meet, we must talk about our sadness, our happiness, 
and about the future. I am happy to be here in Mexico, and I 
feel that we as presidents will reap fruits beneficial to the 
two nations. 
  [Zabludovsky] When you took office as president of 
Nicaragua, 
I remember well that people said this was not a job for a woman. 
They said it was no position for a woman. 
  [Chamorro] Now you have made me laugh, Don Jacobo. 
  [Zabludovsky] [Laughs] Now that several years have passed, 
how would you evaluate the situation? 
  [Chamorro] Jacobo, you have said that being president of 
Nicaragua was no place for a woman, but the people said they 
wanted it -- do not forget that voting is secret -- so here I am. 
  I would like to say that there has been a total change in my 
country. We went from sadness to happiness. We have found 
profound reconciliation among all Nicaraguans. We have found 
forgiveness, which we needed after so many years of pain and 
distortion from past dictatorships. What can a nation do? We 
must find reconciliation among ourselves, to attain freedom and 
democracy, to reconstruct our nation, control and reduce 
militarism, and create a small Army, just as we always wanted. I 
am speaking about Nicaragua, of course, as I visit Mexico. 
General Sandino once said, as did former Costa Rican President 
Jose Figueres Ferrer, we need a small Army. You mentioned 
militarism, and I agree. We need a small Army in our country, 
which had 3 million inhabitants when I took office and has 4.5 
million inhabitants now. 
  I believe I am leaving a good legacy for all Nicaraguans. I 
prefer not to talk about other countries because I inherited my 
country. You know well enough that one should not interfere in 
any other country's affairs. We should respect and listen to 
each other. 
  [Zabludovsky] Madam President, when you took office in 
Nicaragua, you defied many lines of thought. You did not pay 
much attention to pressure for Sandinism, the system that 
preceded you, to disappear. Not only did you ignore those 
perspectives, but you accepted many other viewpoints and 
political trends. You gave Gen. Humberto Ortega, who came from 
the system before you, the Defense Ministry. Now he feels he 
should be your successor. Do you think all this has been 
positive? 
  [Chamorro] Let me say, Jacobo, that when I took office four 
years ago, I did so with the secret vote of all the people in 
Nicaragua who wanted to vote for a change in our country. It is 
true there were authoritarian people from the immediate past and 
even from before that. The Nicaraguans who have come home 
during the last four years want a change. Can you imagine? 
More than 1.5 million people have returned to Nicaragua. What 
does that mean? It means change. What has my mission been? It 
has been to change things, to find reconciliation, and to learn 
how to forgive each other. You speak of one person: Humberto 
Ortega, who used to be called Gen. Humberto Ortega. Allow me to 
say that there will come a time when things will have to change 
for Gen. Humberto Ortega, as well as anyone else with a military 
rank living in a democratic country. This is not being a 
dictator. It is freedom in democracy. 
  Now, after many years, I am here on Televisa talking about 
my country. What do I want for my country? I want to get rid 
of totalitarianism, not only the Sandinists but also the 
Somozists. I lived through many years of that, and I want my 
country to be democratic, free, and sovereign, thanks to the 
people's vote. 
  The generals must change. I have reduced the Army. They 
must continue to be Nicaraguans and stay in Nicaragua because 
they have no reason to flee the country. They do not have to 
leave Nicaragua. They have to continue being Nicaraguans. 
Everyone must learn how to lose. 
  What does learning to lose mean? It means that when I finish 
my term I will hand over the country. I am very sorry if there 
is someone out there who does not like me. I am here for my 
country, for love, and for reconciliation. 
  I told Humberto Ortega on 2 September that there must be 
changes in Nicaragua. He will step down very soon in 1994, if 
not sooner. In any case, he will step down. What does step down 
mean? It means to make changes democratically. He is a 
Nicaraguan personality who has done plenty for his country as 
well. 
  [Zabludovsky] Is there reelection in Nicaragua? 
  [Chamorro] As you well know, four years ago I was handed a 
country where there had been a dictatorship. We are now in a 
democratic country, where we are making constitutional changes. 
We will see if the National Assembly wants there to be 
reelection or not. 
  Let me move ahead here, before you ask me: Dona Violeta, are 
you going to run for reelection? No, my dear friend, enough. I 
have done enough for my country. I am 64 years old and proud of 
it. I am proud to say that I feel happy to have worked for my 
country. It is difficult to heal wounds like ours. Some like 
it, and others do not. 
  I would have preferred a politician to run the country, but 
to each his own. Praise the Lord. The people wanted Violeta to 
be here, so here I am. When they no longer want me here, I will 
gladly go home, and I will still be a Nicaraguan. I would not 
leave. 
  [Zabludovsky] What would happen if the people ask you to run 
for reelection? 
  [Chamorro] If the people want me to run again, I would have 
to think about it, Jacobo. Remember... [pauses] No, it has been 
enough. I think we should leave it to the politicians. They 
would probably do better than I. 
  [Zabludovsky] Madam President, thank you, and my respect. 
  [Chamorro] It was my pleasure, and I hope to see you in 
Nicaragua soon. 
  [Zabludovsky] Very well. Good night, Madam President. 
  [Chamorro] Good night, dear friend.

<F P=106> [Interview with Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon </F>
Fournier by Jacobo Zabludovsky; place not given; from the "24 
Hours" newscast -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Zabludovsky] We will interview Costa Rican 
President Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier. Good evening, Mr. 
President. 
  [Calderon] Good evening, Jacobo. It is a pleasure to be here 
tonight. This is a very important day for my country because 
the free trade agreement with Mexico will create extraordinary 
opportunities for development in Costa Rica. Our country will 
be able to integrate its economy with Mexico's great economy, an 
economy with 90 million participants. 
  [Zabludovsky] Could you briefly tell us how the agreements 
signed today will benefit Costa Rica and Mexico? 
  [Calderon] We must stress one very important aspect: Mexico 
has shown its solidarity with Latin America. One of Mexico's 
most outstanding foreign policy achievements was the free trade 
agreement with the United States, which made it possible to 
integrate the Mexican economy into the world's strongest 
economy. This creates jobs and will bring development to 
Mexico, well-being to the Mexican people, and more opportunities 
for all. 
  By the same token, our free trade agreement with Mexico 
means 
that Costa Rica is entering a country with a population of 90 
million citizens, a country with a growing economy, a country 
that will become part of the First World at the beginning of the 
21st century through the free trade agreement. 
  What does it mean for Mexico? As always, Mexico has shown 
its solidarity with Latin America. The free trade agreement 
with the United States and Canada has made Mexico a stronger 
country that has opened its doors to its Latin American 
neighbors to give us the same opportunities. 
  [Zabludovsky] Last night Nicaraguan President Violeta de 
Chamorro expressed her hope that Nicaragua will also join this 
agreement. Do you think the free trade agreement between Costa 
Rica and Mexico can be extended to other countries in the area? 
  [Calderon] Definitely. That has been President Salinas de 
Gortari's wish from the beginning. At a meeting in Tuxtla 
Gutierrez three years ago, Central American countries agreed to 
sign a free trade agreement with Mexico. Costa Rica had the 
opportunity to advance and persevered until the agreement was 
signed today. The rest of Central America will follow to 
acquire the same advantages that Mexico has given Costa Rica 
today. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Demetrio Sodi de la Tijera, member of the 
Legislative Assembly for the Federal District, explains that his 
departure from the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] is 
because he does not agree with the way his party's new 
presidential candidate was elected. 
  [Begin Sodi de la Tijera recording] I am leaving because of 
the way the new candidate was chosen. As far as the candidate 
is concerned, I have no rapport with nor do I believe he has the 
experience to become president of the republic. It would not be 
compatible to belong to a party and not agree with the candidate 
or the aspiring candidates. This is why I decided to resign. 
[end recording] 
  It is expected that tomorrow, Thursday [as heard], he will 
make his departure from the PRI official. Meanwhile, Rene 
Bejaranom, Democratic Revolutionary Party leader in Mexico City, 
said his party would be willing to offer a Senate candidacy for 
the Federal District to Demetrio Sodi de la Tijera.

  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has announced a 
reduction of bean and corn prices as of 1 May. Salinas headed 
the national meeting of Rural Community Supply Councils. In the 
Lopez Mateos Room at Los Pinos presidential residence, the 
president said bean prices will be reduced 15 percent and corn 
prices will be reduced from 80 to 65 centavos per kilogram at 
rural stores, a move that will benefit over 20 million Mexicans. 
The president thus addressed almost 300 community supply 
representatives. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] The implementation of Program of 
Direct Support to the Countryside means that the government's 
subsidy will go directly to the peasants, without the 
intervention of middlemen. [end recording] 
  For the first time 2 million peasants will receive direct 
support for their land parcels. The president listened to the 
problems outlined by three Community Supply Council 
representatives. He responded to each of their requests, 
assuring them that kernel corn will not be replaced and that 
flour will only be complementary. He promised that the corn 
supply will be sufficient and of good quality. The president 
presented 10 registered deeds for civilian partnerships.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 5 April. 
  Sources at the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial 
Development (Secofi) have said the Mexican Government will 
launch a "great offensive" against the importation of subsidized 
agricultural products from the United States, Canada, and 
European countries. Secofi sources explained a government 
investigation on imported wheat, milk, and garlic will be 
initiated. 
  Meanwhile, Secofi reported the official gazette has 
published 
two antidumping resolutions on importing dioctilftalate 
[dioctilftalato] and sodium carbonate from Germany and the 
United States, respectively. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in 
Spanish 29 March 94 p 20) 
  The government's 1993 anti-inflation measures slowed 
production, sales, and jobs, with ensuing effects in income 
levels. The slow progress in economic activity resulted in a 
1.2-percent reduction in the gross domestic product (GDP) for 
the first time since 1987, according to a report by the 
Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce (Concanaco). The 
report revealed the manufacturing industry decreased by 1.5 
percent last year, while the commerce, restaurant, and hotel 
sectors declined by 1.2 percent. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in 
Spanish 29 March 94 p 28) 
  The production of important raw materials by Pemex 
Petrochemical, a subsidiary of Mexican Petroleum (Pemex), shrunk 
by approximately 14 percent last year due to the closure of 
obsolete plants and the difficult situation of internal and 
external markets. Ethylene and polyethylene production declined 
12 percent while ammonium and methanol fell 20 percent and 15 
percent respectively. Pemex Petrochemical concluded that 
concerning synthetic fibers, the importation of clothes, fabric, 
and textiles has reduced internal production, thereby affecting 
the demand for raw materials produced by Pemex. (Mexico City 
UNOMASUNO in Spanish 29 March 94 p 18) 
  Foreign investments in Mexico during the first quarter of 
this year increased to over $4 billion, namely, 143 percent over 
the amount registered for the same period in 1993, Secofi 
authorities reported on 30 March. (Mexico City XEW Television 
Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 31 March 94) 
  The commercial representative of the Chilan Embassy in 
Mexico 
has reported bilateral trade between Mexico and Chile grew 38 
percent during 1993, totaling $340.5 million in transactions. 
The official said Mexico had a positive trade balance of $78.9 
million. The Chilean diplomat explained bilateral trade was 
boosted by the Economic Supplementary Agreement, which became 
effective in January 1992. The official concluded Chile 
exported $130.8-million worth of goods to Mexico during 1993, 
while it imported more than $200 million worth of goods. 
(Madrid EFE in Spanish 2349 GMT 31 March 94) 
  As of 31 March 33, products, including beans, corn, bread, 
and wheat flour, have been deregulated. Among the deregulated 
products are fuels like gasoline, diesel fuel, natural and 
liquefied gas, and 20 primary petrochemicals. According to 
Secofi, the prices of these products will be regulated by the 
law of supply and demand. Secofi sources have concluded this 
decision was made based on the fact the opening of the economy 
guarantees availability of products for internal consumption. 
  Meanwhile in Washington, the World Bank approved a 
$450-million loan to Mexico on 31 March. The loan will be used 
to improve quality and efficiency of elementary school education 
in 10 of the poorest states of Mexico. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 1 April 94) 
  On 1 April, business sector officials reported productive 
efficiency in the country rose 8.8 percent during 1993, 
following 4- and 7.2-percent increases in 1991 and 1992, 
respectively. The Confederation of Industrial Chambers has noted 
the importance of production efficiency amid high interest rates 
and a 9-percent annual inflation. A study published by the 
magazine INDUSTRIA has revealed productivity in growing sectors 
increased 18.4 percent on average. Among the sectors with 
higher growth rates are the basic metal industries, with 30 
percent; nonmetal mineral industries, with 12.7 percent; the 
manufacturing industry, with 12.3 percent; lumber production, 
with 7.2 percent; the chemical industry, with 6.5 percent; and 
the food industry, with 4.5 percent. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in 
Spanish 2141 GMT 1 April 94) 
  Secofi has reported that during the present six-year term, 
the auto industry has invested more than $10.5 billion in Mexico 
and created more than 210,000 jobs. Secofi said Chrysler, the 
Ford Motor Company, and Nissan were among the companies that 
invested the most. Investments totaling approximately $2.4 
billion are expected this year in the auto industry. Those 
investments are expected to generate 18,000 new jobs and to 
result in the manufacture of more than 1 million vehicles for 
the second consecutive year. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 
4 April 94 pp 48, 22) 
  Luis German Carcoba Garcia, president of the Business 
Coordinating Council (CEE), has said population growth exceeded 
economic growth for the first time in recent years. The 
business leader said it would be erroneous to close the gap 
between population growth and economic dynamism by using 
"populist policies." According to the Secretariat of Finance and 
Public Credit (SHCP), the economy grew 3.75 percent less than 
the population increase in 1993. Last year the GDP grew by .4 
percent, while the population grew by 1.9 percent. The National 
Institute of Geography, Statistics, and Data Processing (INEGI) 
has remarked that by the end of 1993 the total population 
numbered 85.8 million people, while the GDP totaled $324 
billion. INEGI concluded per capita income averaged $3,760 in 
1993. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 4 April 94 pp 1, 22)

LATIN AMERICAN daily report, page 7-13: 
  Page 10, column one, second full paragraph, first sentence 
make read: ...problems. How do you plan to deal with the 
security situation if you are elected president, Mr. Zedillo? 
  [Zedillo] The security situation and, generally speaking, 
injustice require fairer laws. They also require an apparatus 
for prosecution and administration of justice capable of 
enforcing those laws clearly, precisely, and justly, as the name 
of the apparatus spells out. This is easily said, but it 
entails an enormous amount of work. I spoke about fair laws a 
moment ago. We have to examine the laws we have one by one, to 
make sure they are fair laws. We must recognize our judicial 
system's faults, flaws, and evident shortcomings. This includes 
all facets of it, beginning with law enforcement and the police. 
I believe we must be honest in admitting that we ....

  [Text] Guatemala City, 6 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- According to 
local media sources, Revolutionary Party Deputy Obdulio 
Chinchilla was wounded today when unidentified persons shot him 
as he was leaving a hotel in the capital. This is the second 
attack against Chinchilla in less than a year. 
  The legislator, finance committee chairman, and chairman of 
the commission studying reforms to the electoral and political 
parties laws, was shot several times, but there is still no 
information on the seriousness of his injuries, Radio Sonora 
reported. 
  The motives of Chinchilla's attackers are still unknown. 
Chinchilla was the target of another attack months ago which 
caused him to lose one eye. This attack has occurred five days 
after Constitutionality Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez was 
assassinated in front of his house. No one has claimed 
responsibility for that attack. 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 2342 GMT transmits a report which 
states that "Chinchilla was transferred in critical condition to 
a private hospital." The report adds that "one suspect has 
apparently been arrested."]

  [Text] Mexico City, 6 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity [URNG] has requested the immediate 
establishment of the international verification mechanism agreed 
on with the government on 29 March and condemned the 
assassination of Constitutionality Court President Eduardo 
Epaminondas Gonzalez. 
  On 5 April, a URNG communique revealed that "compliance with 
the Global Agreement on Human Rights and the prompt 
establishment of the agreed verification mechanism by the United 
Nations constitute the first trial by fire" of the negotiation 
process. The human rights agreement includes UN verification of 
respect for constitutional rights in Guatemala and compliance 
with the agreement's points. 
  In addition, the URNG asked the government of Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio to clarify the incident against Constitutionality 
President Gonzalez on 1 April. According to Guatemalan 
authorities, Gonzalez died on 3 April after being shot by 
unidentified people while driving to his home in Guatemala City. 
  In the communique released in Mexico City, the URNG asked 
"that the assassination be cleared up as soon as possible," 
considering this incident "is within the jurisdiction and scope 
of the security forces, where it originated." In the guerrillas' 
opinion, the slaying of Gonzalez "constitutes flagrant 
provocation of Guatemalan society and the international 
community," following the signing of the Global Agreement on 
Human Rights in Mexico City on 29 March. 
  In the communique signed by the four URNG commanders, the 
rebels rejected the implementation of a state of exception, 
which they consider part of "a preconceived plan to limit the 
freedom of expression of civic forces." The URNG General Staff 
urged the government and the Guatemalan Army to comply with the 
human rights agreement, which it called a "fundamental step" in 
the negotiation of the peace process in Guatemala. 
  The URNG believes the presidential offer to grant the rebels 
amnesty reflects "existing contradictions (within the 
government) and contravenes the negotiation process." Shortly 
after the signing of the agreement was disclosed, President de 
Leon Carpio announced the possibility of granting the URNG 
militants amnesty, an offer rebel leaders believe "calls into 
question the government's will to conclude negotiations."

  [Text] Last night, the National Congress appointed the 
Constitutional Compliance Commission [Comision de Cumplimiento 
Constitucional] to monitor the investigation into the plot to 
assassinate President Carlos Roberto Reina and establish the 
motives behind it all. 
  Congress President Carlos Roberto Flores Facusse explained 
that he understands the concern of the opposition political 
parties. They are annoyed because Lucio Izaguirre, President 
Reina's private secretary, charged there were opposition plans 
to destabilize the government. "This democracy is costing the 
Honduran people dearly, particularly the political parties, 
without whom there would be no state of law," he said. "To 
generalize in such a way is improper and constitutes an attack 
on the country's institutional structure. This is why we are 
taking these charges seriously and instructing the 
Constitutional Compliance Commission to stay abreast of the 
trends this investigation may uncover," he said. 
  He said appropriate measures will be taken if, after 
examining the results of the investigation, he finds reason 
enough to believe that false accusations have been made that 
could violate the state of law or damage the dignity of the 
political parties. He also demanded the commission file a 
detailed report to the congressional plenum, explaining how well 
founded these charges are in order to reach the proper decisions. 
  The commission members are Jorge Roberto Maradiaga, Rodolfo 
Irias Navas, Jose Raul Pineda Alvarado, Oscar Armando Avila 
Banegas, Gautama Fonseca, Hector Ramon Trochez, and Luis German 
Lagos.

  [Text] Members of the legislative branch reacted with 
rejection, condemnation, uncertainty, and doubt upon learning of 
the plot against President Carlos Roberto Reina. Although many 
refused to comment, others expressed surprised at the report 
because they had met with the president that morning and he did 
not say anything to them. Congressmen also referred to 
criticism by several Hondurans who are accusing the government 
of using the situation as a smokescreen to cover up the economic 
measures, noting that if that were the case, it would be very 
irresponsible. 
  Rafael Pineda Ponce, National Congress first vice president, 
called the act condemnable "because no one has the right to take 
the life of any citizen, much less the president." In his 
opinion, the state security organizations should conduct the 
investigation because their constitutional mission is to 
guarantee the Hondurans' lives and property. If the idea was to 
distract people to stop them from criticizing the rising fuel 
and milk prices, that would be really irresponsible because the 
country is ready to make a social pact among all political, 
social, and economic forces. "The country does not belong to 
the Reina administration or anyone in particular. It belongs to 
everyone, from the most arrogant and haughty to the humblest 
citizens," he added. 
  Liberal Alberto Orellana said he was surprised by the report 
and deplores the incident. "Whether we like it or not, Reina is 
the democratically elected president and we must condemn such a 
situation," he said. He did not rule out the possibility that 
the thwarted attack was a result of the people's desperation 
over spiraling costs and dire poverty. "We can think of so many 
things, things that someone starving might do, but hopefully it 
is nothing like that, only a false alarm," he added. 
  Roberto Micheletti, secretary general [of the Liberal Party 
Central Executive Council], said he was surprised by the report 
and termed the situation loathsome. "If it is confirmed, I hope 
the responsible parties will be turned over to the courts and 
sentenced to the full extent of the law because this country 
elected its leaders democratically and we want to live in 
peace," he stated. 
  When asked about accusations that the incident could be a 
smokescreen, he said "if that were the case, it is wrong and 
undignified. To show such disrespect for the president's life, 
to cover up a situation that we Hondurans are experiencing, is 
wrong and reproachable," he said. 
  Liberal wing head Santiago David Amador condemned any attack 
against the life of a human being, in this case the president of 
the Republic. He said he is waiting for a report from the Armed 
Forces and asked God "to enlighten the minds and attitudes that 
bring disgrace to the people." He stated he is satisfied with 
the intelligence service reports and ruled out the possibility 
that the report was made to hide the country's real situation. 
"No way, one thing cannot be compared to another. One is an 
economic issue, and the other is a human life," he said. 
  Nationalist Jorge Zelaya termed the report dubious because 
"it is strange military intelligence did not issue it, just as 
they did not issue the report when there was an attack against 
former President Roberto Suazo Cordova. Strangely enough, the 
report comes from the Government Ministry when it happens that 
economic decisions have been made and measures taken at the same 
time," he said. 
  Cesar Castellanos, chief of the nationalist wing, said there 
is some doubt because Honduran and Nicaraguan military 
authorities have been at odds over the reports they have given. 
"I would like to wait a little longer and learn about the 
investigations because I have found a series of contradictions 
and facts that are disconcerting. It has been 15 days and 
nobody has been arrested and there is no specific 
investigation," he noted. He added that the statements being 
made clearly show the military authorities were not properly 
informed and now they are trying to say that they knew about 
something when they really did not.

<F P=106> [Report by Marta Marina Gonzalez and Arquimedes Gonzalez] </F>
  [Text] Santiago Rivas Betancourt is 27 years old and 
allegedly one of the terrorists who were supposed to kill 
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina for $400,000. He told 
BARRICADA: "I have never had anything to do with such a plan. I 
went to Honduras to buy spare parts. We are clean. We did not 
plan any murder. I am incapable of becoming involved in such a 
plan," he has said, expressing his willingness to appear before 
police authorities to clarify the entire situation, because, he 
said "I am innocent." 
  Betancourt said he did in fact travel to Honduras with Luis 
Rene Quintero Gonzalez and Jose Arguello Hernandez at the 
beginning of March. They went to buy spare automotive parts. 
When they arrived in Honduras, he added, they were robbed at the 
San Miguel market in Comayaguela and "left penniless." They 
decided to go to the Nicaraguan Consulate. The ambassador gave 
them 100 lempiras so they could return to Nicaragua. He 
recalled they had requested a 90-day multiple entry permit. 
After the robbery, he said, "I had to ask an uncle, who lives in 
Honduras, for thirty lempiras to complete the return fare and 
then travel back to Nicaragua alone." 
  He admitted meeting Luis Rene Quintero Gonzalez, the alleged 
informant, by pure chance. He met Jose Arguello Hernandez, 
another alleged plotter, when they were cell mates serving time 
at Esteli Penitentiary. Santiago Rivas Betancourt said he was 
arrested last year for insulting a law officer. Unofficially it 
is reported, however, he served time for illegal possession of 
weapons and drugs. He also said he was a former member of the 
Sandinist People's Army, where he served as a battalion chief in 
the Army's 5th Infantry Company, in the country's first region. 
Betancourt lost his left hand in a mine explosion, just before 
being discharged. This happened in 1990, when he switched to 
civilian life. 
  Unofficial reports state Luis Rene Quintero Gonzalez, the 
alleged informant of the "plot," has an automotive body shop 
near Bello Horizonte Rotonda. None of the mechanics working in 
that area was able to give any information about Quintero. They 
did say, however, the police had been there at 1830 looking for 
the body shop and its alleged owner. A reliable government 
source has confirmed to BARRICADA the police were on Quintero 
Gonzalez' trail. They had not yet arrested him when we went to 
press. Unofficial reports state Quintero lived in the 
neighborhood of Fundeci, Managua. It was impossible to contact 
him there either.

<F P=106> [From "The Morning Paper" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Honduras has asked the U.S. Government for time to 
settle all property expropriation demands involving U.S. 
citizens. According to Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar, 
Honduras has promised an adequate solution, but any solution 
must always be within the law. 
  Republican Congressmen have proposed the suspension of 
economic aid to Honduras as a means of pressuring for the 
solution of demands by U.S. citizens who have been victims of 
expropriations. They also asked that the United States oppose 
the granting of multilateral credits to governments that do not 
respect the rights of their citizens abroad. Foreign Minister 
Ernesto Paz Aguilar reacted to the Republican Congressmen's 
proposal as follows. 
  [Begin Paz Aguilar recording] The U.S. Congress is now 
debating the general issue of expropriation of property 
belonging to U.S. citizens abroad. Honduras falls in this group 
because there are a number of cases, apparently 10 or 11, in 
Honduras. We have asked the U.S. Government to give us some 
time to solve all these claims. You may recall that these claims 
are over four years old; they existed prior to our 
administration. They are very old claims. They are now pressing 
for a solution. 
  The Honduran Government's position is that this is going to 
be solved appropriately, within the law, respecting the law, 
analyzing each case. Each case is different. It is possible 
that in some cases the claimants are correct, while in others 
they may not be. 
  Another matter is that under international law, it is normal 
for foreign citizens who live in our country, when they feel 
unprotected, when justice is denied, or when there is a delay in 
the administration of justice, to appeal to their diplomatic 
missions and their corresponding governments to defend their 
interests. International law establishes this. [end recording] 
  Although Honduras recognizes that some expropriations cases 
do exist, the foreign minister said not all U.S. citizens' 
complaints in Honduras are specifically related to this issue. 
  [Begin recording] [Paz Aguilar] I would like to say that not 
all are expropriations cases. Some are disputes, some 
conflicts. These might be between Hondurans and U.S. citizens; 
these might be between the Honduran state and U.S. citizens. 
Therefore, each case must be analyzed. I believe whoever is 
right will win the case in our courts, as these are the only 
bodies that can bestow justice. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is there a time limit for Honduras 
to 
solve these cases? 
  [Paz Aguilar] What we have said is this new government has 
barely taken office. We have not been in power for even 70 
days. We said it would be unfair to sanction Honduras for events 
that occurred in the past. We are only asking for an 
opportunity; we are asking for some time to resolve these 
problems, within the law's framework. [end recording] 
  Reports presented by Republicans to the Senate's Foreign 
Relations Committee suggest that visas be denied to foreigners 
who are deemed responsible for confiscating U.S. citizens' 
properties in their respective territories. The foreign 
minister was asked if this was related to the U.S. Embassy's 
decision to deny former Immigration Director [words indistinct] 
a visa. 
  [Begin Paz Aguilar recording] These are merely [word 
indistinct] measures; they are pressure tactics. Nevertheless, 
I would like to reiterate that the right to grant a visa to 
enter a nation is that nation's option. That means the United 
States has every right to grant or deny a visa. Honduras can do 
the same, or, it does the same. It is the Honduran Government 
that decides if it grants a visa to a foreign citizens. [end 
recording] 
  Honduras, along with Nicaraguan and Costa Rica, was singled 
out. There are 1,603 cases of the expropriation of U.S. 
citizens' property between the three countries.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 5 Apr (NA) -- Radical Civic Union 
[UCR] leader Raul Alfonsin this evening stated that, together 
with economic stability, "political stability is also of 
paramount importance." He asserted that he had never before 
acted "with such overt disinterestedness," as he was not 
aspiring to any office. He made it clear that he intends 
"consolidating in 1994 what we began back in 1983." 
  During a 15-minute speech broadcast by "Cronica TV," 
Alfonsin 
pointed out that "we want to ensure for the benefit of posterity 
a Constitution that will be a guarantee of justice, security, 
appropriate institutional order -- a Constitution that will not 
only be in force during the life spans of all those of you who 
are now listening to me, but surely those of your children and 
your children's children as well." 
  Alfonsin, who is running as first UCR candidate for Buenos 
Aires in the Constituent Assembly elections, reiterated that he 
is not pursuing "any sort of personal interest." He put an end 
to any possible speculations by stating that he would in no case 
run for the presidency on the UCR ticket in 1995. 
  Underscoring the value of political stability, Alfonsin gave 
the example of "what is happening in other countries" that are 
torn by social upheavals "despite the fact that everything 
seemed to be going like clockwork," thus alluding to the 
situation in Mexico. 
  First, Alfonsin defended the idea of "pacts" in political 
life. He pointed out that this word derives from the word 
"peace," and stressed that some pacts "have been instrumental in 
solving many fundamental problems confronting countries from 
Latin American and other latitudes." 
  To that effect he recalled the Fixed Point [Punto Fijo] Pact 
in Venezuela following Perez Gimenez's dictatorship, the Pact of 
Bogota after the death of Gaitan, the Pacts of La Moncloa in 
Spain in the wake of Francisco Franco's death, and the pact made 
in El Salvador between guerrillas and the government, which led 
to the 3 April elections. 
  He also referred to Argentine history in recalling the 
"preexistent pacts" mentioned in the 1853 Constitution, which 
"were not made between people who voted for different parties at 
the polls, but rather between people who had charged one another 
with lances; between warlords commanding irregular armies of 
gauchos, who decided to organize our nation." 
  Alfonsin upheld the argument that our country had been in 
"great danger" some months ago, a danger which could have ended 
with the reinstatement of the "incompatible refusals and 
tremendous confrontations" that generated the "climate ripe for 
coups d'etat" that had disrupted the constitutional order. 
  Alfonsin asserted that the federal government "accepted the 
proposals" made by the UCR, which opened the door for the first 
constitutional amendment by consensus of the century. 
  Among the most significant achievements of the agreement 
reached through the Olivos Pact, he highlighted the attenuation 
of the presidentialist system "to preclude any hegemonic 
pretension, any authoritarian slant, any encroachment upon the 
judiciary or upon Congress." 
  Alfonsin emphasized the figure of cabinet chief, who "will 
be 
in charge of the administration, the implementation of the 
budget, the appointment of public servants, and the management 
of administrative resources, and will have to report -- as in 
any parliamentary system -- to Congress at least once a month." 
  Alfonsin added: "We have also limited the power of issuing 
urgent and necessary decrees and the possibility of issuing 
partial vetoes and carrying out an intervention in the provinces 
when Congress is in recess. We have also prevented the transfer 
of powers from the legislative to the executive branch that 
would have excessively overloaded our presidential system." 
  Alfonsin also emphasized the achievement of having changed 
the system to appoint judges through the formation of the 
Council of Magistrates and the mechanism for their removal 
through a judgment jury. 
  "There is nothing that bothers a nation more than 
corruption," Alfonsin indicated, approving a preventive role in 
this area. This will involve assigning a constitutional status 
to the Office of the Comptroller General, which will be headed 
by a man or a woman appointed by the main opposition party. 
  Alfonsin also explained the necessity of attempting to 
secure 
"a majority of UCR Constituent Assembly members" as "there are 
15 approved points of paramount importance" on which there are 
disagreements with the proposals raised by the Justicialist 
Party. 
  Among these disagreements, Alfonsin emphasized the federal 
system, municipal autonomy, environmental protection, defense of 
users and consumers, and the forms of semidirect democracy such 
as, for example, the referendum.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcelo Helfgot: "UCR Plans for `The Day </F>
After'"] 
  [Text] Half of the Radicals have begun to rehearse the role 
they will play following the 10 April elections. They see 
themselves as survivors of "The Day After," title of a film 
showing what the Earth would look like after a nuclear war. 
  Albeit less dramatically, the other half admit that the 
party 
centennial will not be able to avoid a "big bang," exploding 
into a myriad of group and personal agendas revolving in 
different orbits. 
  They must all go through a narrow pass that seems to be 
leading the UCR [Radical Civic Union] to the most serious crisis 
in its history. Raul Alfonsin and his loyal supporters are 
clinging as if to a life raft to the remote possibility of 
winning 30 percent of the Constituent Convention votes. Those 
rejecting the Olives Pact are betting on a major blunder by the 
former president so as to be able to pass the bill on to him and 
steer the party in a different direction. 
  A handful of figures hopes not to get caught in the 
crossfire. The governors of Cordoba and Rio Negro, Eduardo 
Angeloz and Horacio Massaccesi, are confident they will emerge 
from the election challenge even stronger and that their 
presence will be essential in putting the UCR back together. 
Deputy Rodolfo Terragno, who runs no risk in this confrontation, 
will come out seeking to spread his image throughout the country 
via the Future line, which he will launch in Rosario on 14 April. 
  The Radicals' election campaign navigates on troubled waters 
with Alfonsin at the helm, having endured the revolts instigated 
by Fernando de la Rua in the capital and Sergio Montiel in Entre 
Rios. Before coming into port, it ran up against the challenge 
posed by the Convergence, headed by Federico Storrani and Juan 
Manuel Casella, who announced plans for an offensive on the 
party leadership beginning the next day. 
  Underground movements led by former Alfonsinist successors 
and joined by allies from other districts (such as Victor Fayad) 
surfaced in the midst of rumors attributing a divisionist 
attitude to them. All fingers pointed to another subscriber to 
the plan, Osvaldo Alvarez Guerrero, who hastened to say he was 
not betting on any breakup of the UCR, although he did not rule 
out any such outcome as the result of the wrangling. 
  "Historic splits have been the result of pacts," the 
president of the Radical convention said, pointing to the 
Roca-Mitre accord in 1890 that split the Civic Union and gave 
birth to radicalism, and the Frondizi-Peron agreement of 1957 
from which the UCRI [Intransigent Radical Civic Union] emerged. 
  The protagonists in the Radical tragicomedy realize that a 
very complicated libretto awaits them in the months ahead. 
  They will be engulfed in internal turmoil aimed at carving 
out spheres of partisan power, while society has its sights set 
elsewhere: on changes in the constitution and how to prolong 
stability. 
  They will have to employ their best strategy in order to 
define the environmental relationship with the government and 
the much delayed formulation of an alternative proposal for the 
test of fire awaiting them in '95. 
  If they breeze through these phases, the most complex part 
of 
all lies ahead: regaining their "confidence factor," which 
seemed to be the heritage of the UCR and which was gradually 
diluted by successive failures in power and the opposition. 
  What weapons are the various groups readying to meet these 
challenges? 
  The former president plans to leap over any election 
contingency and intends to become the rallying point for a front 
of opposition to the Menemist model, although he will 
simultaneously defend the pact with the PJ as the leader of the 
bloc of Radical convention delegates. 
  Storani et al hope to create a generational bloc, viewing 
themselves as the heirs of a bankrupt Alfonsinism. 
  De la Rua has opted to lower his profile, but those closest 
to him have already begun to pave the way for an all-out return 
and want to revive the antipact alliance, combining Montiel's 
thinkers, Luis Leon, Horacio Usandizaga, and Mario Losada. Ever 
since his return from Washington, Storani has tried to free 
himself from this cast, but Caselli's supporters and other 
allies refuse to let go. 
  Massaccesi will try to cement his identity by virtue of 
special effects. By combining phrases from Yrigoyen with 
frivolous touches and offbeat alliances--no matter that General 
Roberto Requeijo's candidacy collapsed--he dreams of giving a 
Copernican twist to the starchy style of the UCR. 
  If the police incidents connected with his administration 
and 
Ramon Mestre's candidacy give him the anticipated victory, 
Angeloz can become the arbiter of Radicalism. Few would dispute 
his presidential candidacy if the governor of Cordoba were to 
decide once again to challenge Menem. 
  The Alfonists continue to whisper into his ear that this 
time 
he can beat Menem through the "ballotting" and that it is his 
historic mission to unify the party. Angeloz is not convinced, 
however. "I am not ready to announce," is his continuing refrain. 
<H5>  [Box, p 8] </H5>
<H5>  Front Opposing the "Judicialist Pact" </H5>
  Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez and Raul Zaffaroni, Constituent 
Convention candidates for the Grand Front and the Federal 
Capital, have criticized the legal reform proposed by the 
Radicals, maintaining that it contains "no obstacle preventing 
partisanship in justice." 
  The Grand Front candidates have maintained that as a result 
of Radical Deputy Leopoldo Moreau's proposal that the 
Constituent Assembly declare all the judges commissioned, "the 
party supporting reelection would end up destroying any 
possibility of ensuring independent justice." 
  "It was no accident that (the Radical proposal) was 
enthusiastically accepted by (Buenos Aires) Governor Eduardo 
Duhalde, who added the idea that the Supreme Court should be 
responsible for reorganizing the Judicial Branch," Alvarez and 
Zaffaroni said. 
  The stakes for each after 10 April: 

  -  1. Raul Alfonsin: Continuing to lead the party, 
implementing the Olives Pact, and calling for a social front to 
oppose the Menemist model. 
  -  2. Fernando de la Rua and Sergio 
Montiel: Requiring that Alfonsin be accountable and rebuilding 
the anti-Pact alliance in order to displace it. De la Rua would 
get back in the presidential race. 
  -  3. Eduardo Angeloz: He will 
go through the "he-loves-me-he-loves-me-not" routine in order to 
decide whether to accept the candidacy for '95 that will be 
offered to him by the Alfonsinists and other groups. 
  -  4. Federico 
Storani and Juan Manuel Casella: They will ask to move up the 
internal elections and will launch the Convergence as a national 
line in order to form a progressive, post-Alfonsinist line. 
  -  5. 
Horacio Massaccesi and Rodolfo Terragno: They plan to go it 
alone and project their respective images nationally, without 
help from other quarters.

<F P=106> [From the "The RPC Television News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Presidential candidate Ruben Dario Carles rejected 
accusations by some U.S. sectors linking Panama to international 
money laundering. According to Carles, Panamanians cannot 
accept everything that comes from the United States. A report 
issued by the U.S. assistant of state for inter-American affairs 
states that Panama is one of the countries that offers the least 
cooperation in controlling drug trafficking and money 
laundering. Panamanian authorities have staunchly rejected this 
position. 
  Presidential Candidate Ruben Dario Carles, who describes 
himself as a friend of the United States, also rejected the 
allegations. 
  [Begin Carles recording] I agree with the position taken by 
Foreign Affairs Minister Jose Raul Mulino. Panama is 
cooperating in the counternarcotics effort. The enormous 
quantities of drugs seized is one indication that things are 
like they used to be, when trafficking was openly protected by 
Panamanian authorities. [end recording] 
  According to Carles, there are some isolated cases, but they 
are not enough to warrant the accusations being made against 
Panama. 
  [Begin Carles recording] We can not accept everything the 
Americans ask or demand of us. There are interests here in 
Panama that must also be defended, like the banking center. Of 
course money laundering is a crime, but it originates in the 
United States, so let us both struggle against it. They signed 
the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, which Panama has already 
ratified but the United States has not. [end recording]

    [Editorial report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for 8 
May 1994. 
  A Marketing Ideas poll taken in Panama City for EL SIGLO 
puts 
Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate of the 
Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD], in the lead with the 
support of 26.1 percent of respondents. Following closely is 
Change 94 Coalition candidate Ruben Carles with 24 percent. 
Papa Egoro Movement candidate Ruben Blades has remained stable 
with 13.2 percent; the rating of Arnulfista Party candidate 
Mireya Moscoso de Gruber has increased to 11.2 percent, and 
Christian Democratic Party [PDC] candidate Eduardo Vallarino's 
rating increased to 9.2 percent. Candidates Samuel Lewis and 
Salvador Munoz' rates have not changed significantly. (Panama 
City EL SIGLO in Spanish (supplement) 17 March 94 p 8) 
  Electoral Tribunal President Eduardo Valdes has confirmed 
candidacies contested at the tribunal over the next few days 
will not delay the elections. Valdes said the tribunal has 
already hired almost all of the 42,000 people who will work as 
voting officers, voting board members, supervisors, inspectors 
and coordinators during the 8 May elections. (Panama City 
Telemetro Television Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 19 March 94) 
  Ruben Blades says his popularity is still increasing. 
Blades, who has campaigned in various sectors of Panama City, 
said his campaign is going well, and he refused to comment on 
the other candidates, saying it would be in poor taste to do so. 
Blades has said: "Now that the campaign is in full swing, the 
people are reacting positively. As I have said before, the 
other candidates began their campaigns much earlier, but I have 
taken to the streets now, and the people have greeted me 
warmly." (Panama City Telemetro Television Network in Spanish 
1730 GMT 19 March 94) 
  During a tour of Rio Abajo Corregimiento, Ruben Carles urged 
Panamanians to preserve democracy. He said the Torrijos-Carter 
Treaties legalize the presence of U.S. bases in Panama. Carles 
said: "I will make every effort to maintain certain U.S. Army 
bases, which have been legally authorized to remain in Panama by 
the neutrality treaty, particularly by the de Concini clause, 
which Omar Torrijos accepted, confirmed, and approved when he 
signed the treaty at a ceremony in Washington, saying he was 
placing Panama under the Pentagon's umbrella." (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 22 March 94) 
  Ruben Carles has campaigned in the neighborhood of La Boca 
Town, Rio Abajo, Panama City, where he suffered a slight injury 
inside an old building that caved in under the weight of the 
crowd. Carles responded to the situation by saying: "The 
accident occurred due to the building's poor condition. The 
floor caved in, and approximately 12 people fell; fortunately, 
nothing happened." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in 
Spanish 2300 GMT 22 March 94) 
  Approximately 21,000 workers from the National Central 
Organization of Panamanian Workers, CNTP, have announced their 
decision to support the presidential candidacy of Ernesto Perez 
Balladares and oppose Carles, whom they characterize as a 
supporter of the U.S. December 1989 invasion of Panama. CNTP 
Secretary General Elberto Luis Cobos stated in a communique that 
the working classes identify with Perez' ideology and 
background, adding he represents hope and an opportunity for 
thousands of Panamanians who have been deceived by the current 
government. Cobos said "a Perez Balladares victory would mean a 
return to Torrijismo and a rejection of the neoliberal policies 
promoted by the international financial institutions that will 
foster great struggles." (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 25 
March 94 p 13A) 
  The Justice and Peace Commission has released a communique 
regarding the political ads shown on television. The document 
says "political propaganda should not exploit fear, induce any 
form of violence, or contain general accusations." One of the 
ads, sponsored by an alleged "Never Again" committee, shows 
clips of military repression and suggests viewers should never 
forget the dark past. Meanwhile, Gilberto Pitti, media director 
at the Government and Justice Ministry, says anonymous 
propaganda is not illegal and that there is no law that demands 
these ads be signed. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 25 March 
94 p 3A) 
  Perez Balladares says the latest polls show Change 94 
candidate Ruben Carles has reached a plateau, the beginning of 
his decline. LA PRENSA's latest poll puts Perez Balladares in 
the lead with 39 percent of respondents' votes, followed by 
Carles with 20.5 percent. Aurelio Barria from Carles' camp 
reacted to Perez' remarks by saying the polls show a 
polarization and that Carles' popularity will increase in March. 
(Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 25 March 94 p 2A) 
  Yesterday, Legislative Assembly President Arturo Vallarino 
requested the government increase protection for presidential 
candidates. Vallarino's request was prompted by the murder of 
Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party in Mexico. Vallarino said: 
"The electoral campaign has been peaceful thus far, but times 
have changed, and it would be good for the government and its 
security bodies to provide greater protection for the 
presidential candidates." In response, Carlos Bares, 
Institutional Protection Service [SPI] director, said increased 
protection for each candidate has not yet been considered and 
that President Guillermo Endara would have to make such a 
decision. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 25 March 94 p 1A) 
  President Endara has told LA PRENSA the SPI will provide 
greater security for the seven presidential candidates to 
guarantee their physical safety. Endara will discuss this 
decision, prompted by the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
with the Electoral Tribunal. President Endara said certain 
candidates have accepted the additional protection, but others 
have turned it down. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 26 March 
94 p 3A) 
  Yesterday, Electoral Tribunal magistrates asked the 
political 
parties, candidates to public office, and news media to ensure 
political ads fill the requirements of the Santa Maria La 
Antigua electoral ethical pledge. In a "public exhortation," 
the magistrates said past events are important, but they can be 
presented in a "positive and lofty" manner to avoid upsetting 
the parties participating in the race. (Panama City EL SIGLO in 
Spanish 26 March 94 p 37) 
  President Endara says as long as political campaign ads do 
not contain personal insults or incite people to violence there 
is no reason why they should not be shown. Endara said: "We 
must remember the things that happened during certain periods of 
our history, whether it was during my administration or previous 
administrations." In response to a question on the subject, 
Endara also denied having received calls from various 
ambassadors asking him to press for a decision in favor of 
former Mayor Mayin Correa, who stood trial on charges of misuse 
of government funds. He also said he has offered the 
presidential candidates greater protection by the police. 
(Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 1730 GMT 26 
March 94) 
  National Consensus Alliance candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo 
has campaigned in Anton, Cocle Province, with his running mate. 
Residents warmly greeted him. (Panama City Circuito RPC 
Television in Spanish 1730 GMT 26 March 94) 
  Candidates Perez Balladares and Carles, both of who 
campaigned recently in Cocle Province on the same day, mutually 
accused each other of demagoguery. Perez suggested Carles 
remain in "his little rocking chair" until election day. "We 
have not forgotten your cruelty, arbitrariness, and prepotency, 
Chinchorro," Perez said. Meanwhile, Carles asked his supporters 
to compare his career as a public official to Perez', saying "no 
wealthy aristocrat is going to give me lessons in social 
sensibility." (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 27 March 94 p 
1A) 
  Arnulfista candidate Mireya Gruber has told Kuna Indians in 
Kuna Yala: "At 2000 on 8 May, I will be elected president of 
Panama." Gruber invited the Indians to walk up the steps of the 
Palace of the Herons on 1 September. She spoke of the 1968 
coup, which toppled her late husband, and promised to provide 
doctors and medicine for the Kunas, improve their education and 
farming systems, and provide scholarships for them. (Panama 
City LA PRENSA in Spanish 27 March 94 p 9A) 
  Papa Egoro candidate Ruben Blades has proposed the 
decentralization of power, which is centered in the province of 
Panama. He advocates giving the provinces the economic power 
and freedom to make their own decisions. Blades, who visited 
the Azuero region last week, reiterated he has no political 
debts and owes himself entirely to the Panamanian people. 
(Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 27 March 94 p 11A) 
  During a campaign stop in Cocle Province, Mireya Gruber has 
said the fall Carles suffered has affected him. Gruber answered 
Carles' assertions that she is tired and wants to give up and 
form an alliance with him, by saying, "I believe the fall he 
suffered from that balcony has hurt his head." She added: "If he 
needs my votes, he can join forces with me." (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 28 March 94) 
  Perez Balladares has asked his supporters to remain calm as 
he predicted the campaign of insults will become increasingly 
intense during the remaining six weeks before the elections. 
During a tour of several areas in Panama City, Perez said: 
"During the remaining six weeks, we are going to be the targets 
of all types of provocations, starting with insults and 
anonymous television ads that we wish were signed by the 
candidate who is financing them." (Panama City Circuito RPC 
Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 28 March 94) 
  Carlos Valle, assistant secretary general of the Papa Egoro 
Movement, says his party has nominated candidates to 77 percent 
of the public posts in contention nationwide. Valle, who is 
also one of Ruben Blades' campaign managers, has said his party 
is widely recognized in the provinces, even though "just a few 
months ago, Blades and the founders of the party were virtually 
unheard of in remote areas." His personal view is Blades appeals 
to the people because they want their questions answered in 
simple, not technical, terms. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE 
PANAMA in Spanish 31 March 94 p 1A)

<F P=106> [Editorial: "`Starting from Scratch' in the Eradication of </F>
Coca Farms"] 
  [Text] The president's initiative to negotiate an extension 
of the so-far strict and rigid deadlines the U.S. Embassy has 
imposed on the elimination of excess coca farms deserves full 
support from the entire country. 
  In Chapare, thousands of peasant families cultivate coca 
leaves for meager earnings because the price paid for their 
product cannot make them rich. The attractive profits remain in 
the hands of Bolivian, Colombian, and U.S. drug traffickers, 
especially U.S. traffickers, who distribute the product among 
consumers. 
  According to official announcements, there are still 1,900 
hectares of coca farms to be eradicated -- of the 4,500 the 
previous government had promised to eradicate by 31 March -- and 
it is obvious that in the week before the deadline's expiration 
it will be impossible to fulfill the promise. Unless there is an 
intention to provoke a serious confrontation much stronger and 
more tragic than the ones that already have occurred in the 
region. 
  This is the most serious and sensitive problem the nation is 
now confronting. If the Chapare boiler goes off now, the other 
conflicts underlying Bolivian society will immediately worsen, 
provoking violence and instability. To avoid this, it is 
necessary to make all efforts and to be extremely prudent and 
patriotic. 
  If violence prevails in Chapare, there will be no 
capitalization, participation, educational reform, or the other 
proposals. There will be no more democracy, economic growth, and 
inflation control. The country and all its social sectors would 
lose their course, and our homeland would become the appropriate 
stage for the situation that is desired by imperialists and by 
those who advocate military action: a low-intensity war, rapid 
deployment tactics, the use of new conventional weapons, and 
clean, smart bombs. 
  Whoever thinks we are exaggerating should review the course 
of world events to convince himself. Peaceful and prosperous 
societies have suddenly been taken over by violence and, 
obviously, by foreign troops. Peace is for society what freedom 
is for men: It is not appreciated until it is lost, but while 
we enjoy it, we do not realize that we are making use of an 
essential value. 
  President Sanchez de Lozada's timely appeal to the U.S. 
Government, before Vice President Gore, awakened a clumsy 
reaction by Mr. Richard Bowers, which Bolivians have unanimously 
repudiated. He did not use the language of an ambassador, or 
even of a junior diplomat. It is hoped that his superiors in the 
State Department will reprimand him, because our Foreign 
Ministry has never dared do it, because of our longstanding 
weakness. 
  The appropriate thing to do is to outline our position 
directly to Washington, where Vice President Victor Hugo 
Cardenas might go in search of justice. This is what Chayanta 
chief Tomas Catari did 200 years ago when he made a long 
pilgrimage on foot to Buenos Aires to complain to the viceroy 
about the abuses of Governor Joaquin Alos.

  [Text] After lengthy talks, government officials and coca 
growers leaders at 2230 last night signed a five-point agreement 
to end the wave of violence that affected the Cochabamba 
tropical region as a result of the forceful eradication of coca 
plantations. 
  Signing the agreement for the government were Foreign 
Minister Antonio Aranibar, Government Minister German Quiroga, 
Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters, and Sustainable Development 
Minister Jose Guillermo Justiniano. The other side was 
represented by leaders of peasant organizations and coca growers 
led by the Bolivian Labor Federation (COB). The agreement was 
signed after lengthy talks that were at one time almost broken 
due to the intransigence of both sides. 
  The agreement, which was described as successful by the 
peasant leaders, begins by stating that government and labor 
leaders are committed to jointly fighting the drug trade. 
  The second point focuses on the government's commitment to 
refrain from further forced eradication of coca plantations and, 
to this effect, agrees to issue within 15 days a ministerial 
resolution containing pertinent instructions to the appropriate 
organizations. 
  The next point recognizes the government's commitment to 
continue "to search for and to destroy maceration pits and/or 
laboratories, without destroying adjacent coca plantations." 
  The fourth point caused the most conflict, to the point of 
having threatened to cause an impasse in the talks. It states: 
"The government and coca grower leaders will participate in the 
implementation of the provisions of Articles 10, 14, and 24 of 
Law 1008. The government vows to implement the Alternative 
Development Program jointly with coca growers leaders." 
  The fifth and final point provides for the creation of joint 
commissions to address all problems concerning production, 
marketing, processing, alternative development, and the legal 
and institutional aspects concerning coca production. 
  Following the signing of the agreement, government officials 
and leaders of peasant organizations expressed their 
satisfaction over the outcome of their talks. Foreign Minister 
Aranibar announced that the government yielded on the 
controversial fourth point "to safeguard social peace and 
because the fight against the drug trade must be waged within a 
framework of respect for the people and for the country." 
  Evo Morales, leader of the coca growers, described the 
agreement as "a major step forward" in the defense of coca, 
which is the only source of income for the peasants of 
Cochabamba and said that the task remaining now is to implement 
alternative development as a condition for replacing the surplus 
coca production.

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] The Bolivian press has been warning that 
a Chiapas-style rebellion could erupt in the country because of 
similar socioeconomic conditons affecting a large portion of the 
population. On 20 February, La Paz PRESENCIA, a Catholic 
Church-owned center-left daily, published a special report 
entitled "The Chiapas Syndrome, Vaccine Sought Urgently," which 
reviewed the Indian uprising in Mexico and commented on the 
possibility of it occurring in Bolivia. The report included 
interviews with Bolivian Vice President Hugo Cardenas, 
sociologist Javier Hurtado, and Free Bolivia Movement (MBL) 
deputy Miguel Urioste. All three expressed sympathy for Indian 
and peasant demands and urged that they be addressed through 
democratic processes, not armed struggle. To this end they are 
promoting the government's current reform programs. 
  In the PRESENCIA interview Vice President Hugo Cardenas, 
Bolivia's first Indian official at that level, described the 
recent events in Mexico as "worrisome" for Bolivia the "lack of 
solidarity with the poor could pave the way for a Chiapas-style 
guerrilla uprising." "We Indians have shed the most blood in the 
struggle against injustice," he explained, "and we are fed up." 
He also pointed out that "the arrival of an Indian to the vice 
presidency doesn't mean that prejudice and injustice have ceased 
to exist." Cardenas argued that the problems resulting from 
"political and social exclusion"--lack of education and health 
services, low salaries, unequal land distribution, migration to 
the cities, and poverty in general--"should have been solved by 
now" and that these topics "should be the most important issues 
on the continent's political agenda." Instead, he noted, the 
first steps are just being taken, after 169 years, to 
incorporate the "approximately 42 percent of Bolivian society," 
previously excluded from the decisionmaking processes of the 
state, into the political system. Cardenas expressed confidence 
that the "mentality of commitment" now prevailing among the 
power elites in Bolivia would lead the way for the 
transformation of Bolivia from a "democracy of minorities" into 
a "multiethnic and pluricultural democracy." These steps must be 
taken, he insisted, "so that a Chiapas does not occur here." 
  Miguel Urioste, leader of Free Bolivia Movement (MBL) that 
is 
part of the government coalition, and director of TIERRA 
(Workshop for Initiatives in Rural Research and Agrarian 
Reform), agreed with Vice President Cardenas that Indians and 
peasants in Chiapas and Bolivia experienced similar conditions. 
However, Urioste told PRESENCIA that, although Bolivian Indian 
and peasant groups are now "awakening," they are not opting for 
radical or destructive measures but are increasingly proposing 
"constructive solutions" to their problems. Urioste mentioned 
that among the solutions sought by the government, the most 
essential are a redistribution of public investment and a more 
equitable reallocation of resources toward rural areas to give 
the people more say in political and administrative decison 
making. In addition, with the goal of eliminating unproductive 
large estates (latifundios), his party has also been promoting a 
second agrarian reform, more aggressive than that which was 
carried out under the first Agrarian Reform Act of 1953. These 
solutions are embodied in the draft Popular Participation Law, a 
complex and controversial law which is part of President Sanchez 
de Lozada's reform package. Urioste felt optimistic that the law 
would "substantially modify society's representational 
structures." For example, he explained, 300 rural municipalities 
would be created, comprising 12,145 peasant and Indian 
communities. "For the first time in Bolivia's history," these 
communities would have legal jurisdiction and their elected 
traditional authorities would also be legally recognized. The 
newly created municipalities "would receive 19 percent of 
Treasury tax revenues" to directly administer and manage the 
communities' education and health centers, as well as the 
irrigation systems, construction projects, and road networks. He 
stressed that an important provision of the law would require 
that resources be allocated to regions according to number of 
inhabitants, thereby eliminating previous "imbalances." Urioste 
said that "although centuries of poverty could not be eliminated 
in one or four years," he was confident that "we are still in 
time to correct the mistakes and prevent a rude awakening of 
Bolivia's Indian people." 
  Bolivian sociologist Javier Hurtado, in his comments to 
PRESENCIA, observed that in Bolivia despite the reforms brought 
about by the 1952 Revolution, things have changed little for the 
peasants. "The struggle for land remains a central theme," he 
explained, and "racial discrimination is still strongly rooted." 
He also believes that the present economic system has only 
served to "accentuate the polarization of poverty versus 
opulence" in the country, and that this could lead to a 
Chiapas-like situation. "To alleviate this tension," he said, 
Bolivians should "start thinking about repeating an April 1952 
Revolution with significant reforms," as well as "correcting the 
technical errors of the first Agrarian Reform of 1953." 
  Concern that the Chiapas uprising could be repeated in 
Bolivia, especially in the Chapare region of Cochabamba 
Department, was expressed in various issues of the Cochabamba 
daily LOS TIEMPOS. The government there had been carrying out a 
program of limited forced coca eradication in compliance with 
"Law 1008," which requires the eradication of one hectare of 
coca for every cocaine maceration pit found in the area. These 
actions, opposed by coca growers, led to violence in early March 
between the growers and special eradication forces. According to 
the 3 March issue of LOS TIEMPOS, Evo Morales, leader of the 
coca growers' confederation, issued an "official" statement on 2 
March threatening violent resistance similar to the Chiapas 
uprising if "the government does not cease its forced 
eradication of these crops." The 9 March LOS TIEMPOS reported 
that President Sanchez de Lozada admitted that the country was a 
"time bomb," and, according to the same daily, the Bishop of La 
Paz, Monsignor Luis Sainz, said that the Church sided with the 
peasants in opposing the forced destruction of coca crops, and 
that "before eradicating coca, the government should eradicate 
poverty." 
  A 20 February commentary in LOS TIEMPOS by Jose Luis Roca, 
entitled "Symptoms of Social Instability in the Chapare," 
observed that "in Bolivia, the Chapare area could become the 
epicenter of serious social conflict." The Chapare, he 
continued, "is like a boiling cauldron that hasn't yet exploded 
only because of its pressure valves, which are the relative 
freedom to grow and market coca leaf." The commentator noted 
that the situation in the Chapare is potentially more volatile 
than that in Mexico because in Chiapas, at least, "a trained 
people's army conducts negotiations on an equal basis with its 
government (which raises hope for a negotiated solution)." In 
the Chapare, he continued, "there is the risk of collective 
suicide because the peasants' reactions are totally irrational, 
motivated only by desperation and hunger." The author feared 
that drug traffickers could exploit any unrest to perpetrate 
"horrible actions in our country," like the ones which "have 
plunged Peru and Colombia into a bloodbath." 
  A 1 March editorial entitled "Violence in the Chapare" 
echoes 
previously expressed concerns and asserts that "eradication of 
coca bushes is only carried out when it is necessary to make a 
gesture to obtain economic aid from foreign governments." The 
Chapare, noted the editorial, could become a chronic area of 
conflict," as long as the government is incapable of formulating 
a "general policy on coca and drug trafficking that truly meets 
long-term national interests rather than short-term party 
interests." 
  According to La Paz Television Nacional Network on 26 March, 
an agreement was finally reached in which the government 
promised to desist from any forced eradication. The coca growers 
believe this agreement represents a victory for them, and the 
government believes the agreement "will ensure peace and the 
implementation of alternative development in the coca-producing 
regions."

  [Text] British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, 64, has said 
in Sao Paulo that British consulting firms and investment banks 
have "specific" and "practical" interest in "actively" engaging 
in the privatization of the Brazilian electricity sector. 
  Hurd yesterday began a four-day visit to Brazil to promote 
relations between the two countries. In Brasilia tomorrow, he 
will meet with President Itamar Franco, with Finance Minister 
Rubens Ricupero, and with Foreign Minister Celso Amorim. 
  At Bandeirantes Palace, in southern Sao Paulo, Hurd met with 
Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, with whom he addressed the 
plan for privatization the Sao Paulo potable water service. 
  Hurd added that Great Britain has successfully privatized 
the 
electric power and potable water sectors. 
  "As a result of this," he went on, "British enterprises have 
direct experience in privatization management, and a new class 
of entrepreneurs who specialize in denationalization." 
  Hurd said the British Government will consider reopening 
official export credits for Brazil, which were suspended four 
years ago when Brazil stopped amortizing its debt to the Paris 
Club.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- A person very close to numbers 
game kingpin Castor de Andrade has sent a lot of money to Cali, 
Colombia -- the seat of one of the largest cocaine trafficking 
cartels. Documents proving this remittance were seized at Casto 
de Andrade's fortress. Rio de Janeiro Attorney Antonio Carlos 
Biscaia said: "The numbers game is no longer just the game that 
so many people enjoy; it is a mask behind which several forms of 
organized crime hide." 
  Attorneys examining the numbers game kingpins' accounts have 
also found that in January 1993, Castor de Andrade deposited 
$500,000 in the Swiss Banks Association. Biscaia said: "The 
numbers game has been used to permeate crime throughout society, 
by bribing policemen and judges, by supporting samba groups and 
soccer teams, and even by financing politicians' electoral 
campaigns." These accounting books list sums paid to several 
candidates and contributions to political campaigns. Biscaia 
said: "It is all written down in the books, even the $100,000 
given to a major candidate."

<F P=106> [Statement by Maria Alicia Talavera Sevilla, assistant </F>
director of the Presidency's Social Communication Directorate, 
in Managua; from the "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] We want to deny all information disseminated by 
cable news agencies from Guadalajara implying that President 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro suffered a fainting spell at noon 
today shortly before giving a speech at the Regional Forum on 
Women's Participation and Development sponsored by the 
Inter-American Development Bank in that Mexican city. 
  We talked directly with President Chamorro a few minutes ago 
as she was about to leave the hospital, excuse me, the Grand 
Hyatt Hotel in Guadalajara, where she and the official 
delegation accompanying her are staying during their visit to 
Mexico. We will now present you -- through Radio Corporacion, 
which has so kindly offered us the opportunity -- a brief 
statement by President Chamorro. We recorded this a few minutes 
ago here at the Social Communications Directorate. 
  [Begin Chamorro recording] Hello, this is Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro, president of Nicaragua. I would like to deny the news 
that has reached Nicaragua -- being sent from this city or 
wherever -- that I fainted and am about to die. I have never 
fainted in my life, thank God. There has been some confusion. 
I was told about this and my blood ran cold. A lady from 
Uruguay or Paraguay.... [pauses] Where is this lady from? 
Uruguay, I think. Anyway, she was the one who fainted. I do 
not know her and I do not know what her condition is now. I 
hope she is feeling better because you feel bad when you are 
sick. 
  Personally speaking, I have not fainted. I feel very well. 
I will go and represent Nicaragua in a short while. I will 
talk about women at the bank's event so....[pauses] I repeat, I 
have never fainted in my life. Never, knock on wood. I have 
not fainted, I am not in poor health, and I have not given up -- 
nor have I (?betrayed) my homeland. Please, I want all 
Nicaraguans who love Violeta to know I am all right, thank God, 
and that I will come home tomorrow. [end recording] 
  This was a brief statement by Nicaraguan President Violeta 
Chamorro, who confirmed that she did not have a fainting spell 
as was reported from Guadalajara. She also confirmed her return 
to Managua tomorrow. Thank you and good afternoon.

  [Text] With approval of the new narcotics law being debated 
by the National Assembly, Nicaragua will establish the legal 
framework for combating drug trafficking more efficiently, but 
the law alone is not sufficient, Deputy Carlos Gallo, chairman 
of the Human Rights Committee, has said. We need resources and 
assistance even from the U.S. State Department. 
  [Begin Gallo recording] The State Department can help in 
obtaining assistance for Nicaragua's police apparatus to combat 
it. You know how precarious the National Police budget is. [end 
recording] 
  The law is also being drafted to fight money laundering, 
which has not taken hold in Nicaragua. 
  [Begin Luis Humberto Guzman, Christian Democratic Union 
deputy and National Assembly president, recording, in progress] 
...the report does not review the volume of financial 
transactions in Nicaragua's banks. We could not necessarily 
talk of money laundering; at least not for now. [end recording] 
  Nicaragua has not reached the level of drug trafficking of 
other countries. 
  [Begin Guzman recording] Perhaps Nicaragua's only 
implication 
is that its territory and air space are used as a 
drug-trafficking and transshipment point. [end recording] 
  The law may be passed in the next four weeks. Controversial 
topics will be DEA operations in our country and the extradition 
of nationals, something our Constitution bars.

<F P=106> [Report by Fidelina Suarez] </F>
  [Text] The price of the dollar on the parallel market 
dropped 1 percent in the past three months, and the current 
shortage of cash (cordobas) in circulation has led to a dollar 
surplus. For that reason, exchange houses are selling the 
dollar at 6.65 cordobas. Managers of the 14 exchange houses 
that operate in the country and the people who sell dollars on 
the streets are concerned, for they have been unable to make 
major operations due to a shortage of cordobas. 
  Exchange houses have even bought the dollar at a price 
higher 
than the official rate, which yesterday was set at 6.53 
cordobas, whereas in other cases the dollar was sold for 6.52 
cordobas. "The price has not settled since last year, when we 
closed with a selling price of 6.65 cordobas to the dollar," 
Multicambios General Manager Jose Dolores Gomez has said. 
  In addition, the U.S. State Department released a report 
criticizing the Nicaraguan Government for its lack of initiative 
in controlling "money laundering" and drug trafficking. The 
State Department report stated "money laundering" is especially 
serious in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. "There is no doubt 
Nicaragua's tremendous financial and political problems make it 
the perfect target for drug traffickers," the document has 
stated. 
  Nicaraguan Central Bank President Jose Evenor Taboada denied 
"money laundering" is done in Nicaragua through the national 
financial system. "The Superintendency of Banks and Other 
Financial Institutions and the BCN [Central Bank of Nicaragua] 
follow up every day all the transactions conducted through the 
financial system and exchange houses, and there are no 
large-scale operations indicating to us that money laundering is 
taking place," he said. 
  Taboada said that based on the stability observed in bank 
transactions, there is no possibility that "money laundering" is 
done that way. "For example, there is no evidence huge amounts 
of money have been withdrawn from the financial system 
overnight," he said. 
  Concerning the dollar surplus, the official said the 
dollarization of the economy still persists in the country, 
mainly in sectors that in some way sense instability. "Certain 
people cannot forget about the inflation and devaluation period, 
although we insist the situation has changed. We hope they will 
feel more secure with the signing of the ESAF [Enhanced 
Structural Adjustment Facility], so we can reverse this 
sentiment," Taboada said. 
  At the start of Holy Week, the price of the dollar had 
dropped to 6.60 cordobas. The exchange house Multicambios did 
not miss the opportunity of selling it at up to 6.55 cordobas 
yesterday. "We need cordobas, and that is why we often have to 
sell at that price, barely a point above the official price, 
which today (yesterday) was 6.53.77 cordobas," Gomez has said. 
  Exchange dealer Miguel Angel Mendieta said that before Holy 
Week, the market experienced a dollar surplus and a cordobas 
shortage. "We believe this is caused by the economic crisis. 
People who have dollars are selling them to survive, but only a 
few are buying to save them as they did before," Mendieta has 
said. Gomez said the surplus and shortage in demand will lead 
to a dollarization of the economy. "The balance has been broken; 
more people are selling dollars, and there are few cordobas to 
purchase them," he has said. In certain cases the profit margin 
of certain exchange houses was four cents, but that has dropped 
to one cent for the above mentioned reasons. Most of the 
exchange houses have cut back their levels of operations. 
  Alejandro Solorzano, Exchange Houses Association [Asociacion 
de Casas de Cambio, Asocambio] president, attributed the 
situation to the shortage of liquidity. "The trend is now toward 
more people with dollars and fewer with cordobas. We are almost 
working at the official price," he added. According to 
Solorzano, the chief problem is that the exchange houses lack 
the capacity to give incentives to buyers as they did before. 
"The slow circulation of dollars is hurting the market," he 
said.

<F P=106> [Report by Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>
  [Text] Although they were unfamiliar with the details, 
various official sectors of the country have rejected the U.S. 
State Department's international report on narcotrafficking 
control strategy, which states that in 1993, "Nicaragua showed 
little progress" in the antidrug-trafficking and 
money-laundering struggle in the country. Deputy Foreign 
Minister Jose Pallais said the report "does not accurately 
reflect" the Nicaraguan situation, and "the U.S. State 
Department told Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry officials that 
Nicaragua was not a country that caused concern" regarding drug 
trafficking. "Furthermore," it added that since the date of the 
report until today, "Nicaragua has shown important progress in 
cooperating to confront international narcotrafficking problems." 
  The U.S. document, to which BARRICADA gained access, states 
the National Police has delayed the antidrug-trafficking 
struggle and conducted its first operation "with the DEA" in 
early 1994. Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar recalled 
that John Maisto, U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua, sent a letter 
congratulating the police corps for its antidrug-trafficking 
struggle. 
  The annual report also states "the extension and importance 
of drug trafficking in Nicaragua is not fully known," but "there 
are hardly any doubts about Nicaragua's tremendous financial and 
political problems make the country an obvious target" of 
narcotrafficking. 
  A ranking police source has agreed that undoubtedly a large 
amount of drugs passes through our country, air space, and 
across our sea. The source added: "Concerning Nicaragua, one 
cannot speak, however, of official authorization of 
narcotrafficking flights or official protection groups for 
cocaine-unloading operations." 
  The report criticized Violeta de Chamorro's government for 
not progressing as the United States wants "in fulfilling the UN 
Convention of 1988, not passing new counternarcotics laws, not 
adopting measures against government corruption, and not 
progressing in bilateral and regional agreements signed in 
previous years. It recognizes as facts, however, that Nicaragua 
is part of the executive secretariat of the Central American 
Antinarcotics Commission, that the Banco Central demands 
documents verifying transactions exceeding $10,000, and that a 
counternarcotics police unit has been created." 
  Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar said "there is no 
evidence of money laundering in Nicaragua," as the U.S. State 
Department claims. A police source agreed with Cesar. "We 
cannot certify there is money laundering in Nicaragua." The 
source added the police cannot conduct an investigation "as long 
as there is no law authorizing us to do so." 
  Luis Humberto Guzman, National Assembly president, said that 
so far, the legislative branch has not conducted an 
investigation on money laundering due to a lack of economic 
means. He said: "If one examines the amount of financial 
activities in Nicaraguan banks, we cannot speak of money 
laundering." 
  The U.S. report adds that "although the Nicaraguan 
Government 
promised in 1992 to present a law, according to the UN 
Convention of 1988, it decided not to use any political capital 
for it." The report added Nicaraguan legislation on the topic 
is "obsolete" because it defines the problem as a "health" 
problem. The National Assembly has learned of a draft bill 
which, because of its complex nature, is taking awhile. It is 
hoped the law will be ready in eight weeks. Guzman said the 
U.S. State Department "has false information" on the 
narcotrafficking situation in Nicaragua, and the deputies are 
"doing what we must regarding this topic (of narcotrafficking)."

  [Text] The National Commission on Public Morals was 
established at La Moneda Palace today. President Eduardo Frei 
decided to set up this commission to combat signs of corruption 
in the country. 
  The issue of honesty in public office has been uppermost in 
the head of state's mind since he came to power. The idea of 
establishing the National Commission on Public Morals answers 
this concern. This commission, which is to be made up of 
leading figures from all political sectors, will have a 100-day 
deadline for submitting its proposals. 
  [Begin Frei recording] We establish this national commission 
today in order to streamline the legal mechanisms established to 
ward off and suppress occurrences such as corruption and 
trafficking of influence. The reason that prompted me to 
establish this national commission was to underscore that 
corruption and its attendant problems are things that concern 
the whole country, as the efforts of a particular government are 
not enough to prevent and overcome it. All the democratic 
forces of our country should be united in this endeavor. Every 
upright and efficient government official ought not to be 
worried. Our final goal is to turn public service into a 
dignified work environment where initiative, the spirit of work, 
and the disinterested effort to achieve the common good are 
rewarded. We are not seeking to create a paralyzing and 
stifling control system. We are interested, rather, in clearly 
distinguish illegitimate intentions from mere mistakes. We are 
pursuing the betterment of the state so as to be able to give 
citizens aboveboard and competent service rather than the 
construction of an efficient and bureaucratic state. [end

  [Text] The president of the Republic demands that all 
Chilean public employees respect the people and exhibit flawless 
professional behavior. 
  In a note distributed to mayors and governors, President 
Frei 
warns that "administrative integrity implies putting public 
interests above personal ones." It adds: "Corruption implies 
taking advantage of a situation for personal benefit." 
  The note exhorts officials to look after public property and 
resources by making good use of them, to have a social life in 
accordance with the dignity of their positions, to avoid 
intervening in a situation in which personal interests are 
involved, and not to engage in influence peddling or handle 
privileged information and to prevent others from doing it. Tax 
collectors are warned that they should not solicit, commit 
others to grant them, or accept donations, advantages, or any 
other sort of privilege. They must promptly report to the courts 
crimes they are aware of, as well as report all irregularities 
to the appropriate authorities. They are also requested to 
strictly control the use of fiscal revenues. The note also 
reminds public employees that the administration is subjected to 
multiple controls, therefore they should not hinder or delay 
this control. Another part of the note adds that no fees should 
be charged for tasks performed by government members unless 
legal provisions establish otherwise. 
  The president of the Republic also requests that public 
administration employees comply with the objectives of each 
government institution and that, on their own initiative, 
employees seek to better fulfill their obligations and place the 
public administration at the service of citizens. 
  Another provision is that civil servants meet community 
requests, charges, or complaints that are respectfully and 
appropriately presented. The public tasks must be fulfilled in 
thorough compliance with the terms of the Constitution, the 
laws, and established norms. They also are required to be 
diligent, not to create false expectations about the extent of 
government actions, to be efficient, to simplify red tape, to 
make use of the available means, and not to overwhelm society 
with excessive rules. Obsolete or useless norms must be 
expressly eliminated, and the language used in guidelines and 
norms must be simple and understandable to all. 
  They are told to exercise authority in a reasonable and not 
arbitrary manner, to do it in a respectful and diligent way, and 
to ensure that their action goes beyond the interests of 
individuals or groups. 
  The president of the Republic points out in the note: "Our 
rule of law guarantees absolute equality before the law. 
Therefore, I will not allow people, groups, interests, or 
authorities to be favored. 
  "I demand that you appoint people who have full knowledge of 
matters in his area in positions of direct service to the 
population. I want them to carry out their duties with 
dedication and courtesy. Everyone has the right to be treated 
well. I want special respect for the poor, the handicapped, and 
elderly people. I want clarity. I want the people to see what 
you are doing. Do not deny access to the information or reviews 
of administrative documents. I want people who respect our 
population's different cultures, who can make sound decisions, 
who can resolve problems by listening to those affected. I want 
people who will adopt all necessary measures to guarantee 
security, good service, and the protection of users' rights. I 
want the areas where people wait or where they are heard to be 
accessible and dignified. Users should receive all the 
information necessary concerning administrative proceedings so 
they clearly know where to go, which documents to take with 
them, and when they will be served.

<F P=106> [Article by Raul Rojas] </F>
  [Text] Following a long meeting of the Political 
Interministerial Committee, which is presided over by the 
president of the Republic, Victor Manuel Rebolledo, minister 
secretary general of the Presidency, reported that the 
government will promote concrete measures against corruption in 
the next few days. 
  Rebolledo said: "Ethics, transparency, and integrity 
constitute a very high priority for the government as a 
guideline for its public activities. The government 
acknowledges the concern expressed by politicians and 
congressmen over corruption. The government believes the 
Chilean political system is not suffering generalized 
corruption. It is very important to point this out. Our 
concern follows some signs that have turned up. It is yet not a 
generalized problem, but it is necessary to confront corruption 
promptly, to prevent this evil from installing itself in our 
political system." 
  Rebolledo said that in the next few days measures will be 
adopted to combat corruption. The government will establish 
regulations to prevent corruption from installing itself in 
Chilean public life. 
  The Political Interministerial Committee studied the 
priorities of the government's legislative agenda and concluded 
that tension over the prioritization of social and 
political-institutional subjects do not exist. 
  The meeting confirmed that social aspects will be stressed, 
without overlooking other political reforms. There has been a 
total consensus regarding some reforms, like procedures to be 
adopted by joint committees in case of disagreement on a 
constitutional amendment between the two houses of Congress. 
There was consensus on subjects linked to citizenry, 
nationality, and other issues, like the case of direct elections 
for mayor. 
  The committee also ratified other wide-reaching reforms that 
require open dialogue with the opposition: "We want to explore 
possibilities for consensus. We believe there is a spirit of 
dialogue, and it is understood that our institutional system can 
be modernized and improved."

  [Excerpt] The need to establish a commission to fight 
corruption was one of the key issues discussed during the 
meeting of the Interministerial Political Committee presided 
over by Interior Minister German Correa [as published]. 
  Senator Anselmo Sule, the Radical Party president, stated 
that the heads of political parties and government authorities 
discussed the situation in Congress. They also discussed other 
issues that will become draft bills. 
  When asked about the commission to fight corruption, Sule 
said: "It has been proposed; there is a preliminary agreement 
and I believe it will materialize in the next few days. There 
has been agreement on the need for this for some time now. The 
commission will be established by decree and will include 
representatives of all political sectors because it is a 
nationwide problem that must be tackled by all Chileans. It has 
yet to be decided what it will do specifically. What it must 
obviously do is to assess the concrete measures, the procedures, 
alternatives, methods, and attitudes to be taken to eliminate 
the possibility of this problem surfacing or worsening." 
  As for the government's draft bills, their precedence will 
be 
determined next week. 
  Deputy Gutenberg Martinez, president of the Christian 
Democratic Party, admitted that disagreements with the 
opposition in the lower house were also discussed. He 
commented: "We were all surprised by what happened in the 
Senate, by the attempt to form an opposition bloc, and by the 
comments made by senators like Hernan Larrain, in the sense that 
the Senate will become a sort of opposition trench. We regard 
the comments by Andres Allamand positive, because they at least 
suggest that not event the rightist sector is quite certain 
about the matter. We believe their decisions on constitutional 
issues and the government's social priorities will allow us to 
determine the possibilities of a relationship with the rightist 
sector." 
  Martinez added: "Our sector believes the policy of 
agreements 
and consensus regarding important national issues is the policy 
the Coalition of Parties for Democracy must uphold, but this 
does not mean we will not detect or reject any maneuver to turn 
the Senate into an opposition trench." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Measures Against Corruption"] </F>
  [Text] It is undeniable that all sectors agree it is 
necessary to fight corruption. Yet, when it comes to making a 
decision on concrete measures, there is no more unanimity. 
While some people emphasize the legal side of the matter, 
advocating the use of laws to fight this scourge, others 
emphasize the ethical side, advocating the teaching of 
principles to people. 
  The truth is that both are right. A society without 
sufficient legal instruments, both for preventing and for 
sanctioning corruption, will have little success in the fight 
against it. Yet it is also true that people without principles 
are more likely to engage in practices leading to the unethical 
and illegal obtaining of wealth. 
  Within this context, it is highly positive that the first 
"heated debate" at the Chamber of Deputies focused on the search 
for feasible mechanisms for controlling this scourge. Because 
even though Chile has traditionally observed the law and the 
standards of morality, there are indications that the corruption 
wave affecting other countries might also spread to Chile. 
  An outstanding point in the broad debate on the subject was 
the need to strengthen the structure and functions of control 
organs. Proposals were made to expedite and modernize the 
procedures of the Office of the Comptroller General of the 
Republic and to expand the supervisory duties of the Council for 
the Defense of the State and of the Chamber of Deputies. 
  A proposal was also made to install an Ombudsman [preceding 
word in English], or people's defender, and a Superintendency of 
State-Run Companies. Within the private sector it was proposed 
to impose sanctions against the illegal obtaining of wealth and 
the engagement of employees in crimes against the state [delitos 
funcionarios]. It was also proposed to reestablish the power 
that professional associations had for sanctioning ethical 
violations. 
  The government is sponsoring an interesting initiative, 
which 
considers the possibility of creating a top-level commission for 
proposing the necessary legal amendments to prevent fraud in all 
public sector organs. 
  This initiative, which would in practice call for creation 
of 
a National Commission Against Corruption similar to the 
commission that will be created for fighting poverty, has the 
advantage that all sectors of the country will be represented in 
it. In fact, all Chileans should obviously engage in the fight 
against this scourge, which is the main threat that jeopardizes 
a democracy. 
  In sum, there is pressing need for promptly designing an 
appropriate strategy for fighting this fearful phenomenon. Only 
in this way will our action reflect our words.

  [Excerpts] The National Aeronautical Enterprise, Enaer, 
will become a center for repairing the Casa-212 and 235 
transportation airplanes, which are used mostly in the Latin 
American countries. 
  The information was provided by engineer Raul Herranz, a 
specialist in nuclear energy and president of Construcciones 
Aeronauticas S.A., CASA, of Spain, which manufactures the 
airplanes used in about 10 countries on the continent. [passage 
omitted] 
  Herranz pointed out the high level of efficiency of Enaer, 
which co-produces the advanced C-101 training airplane -- known 
as the T- 36 Halcon -- in Chile, as well as the ability of its 
engineers and support personnel who work in the arsenals. 
  He added: "This is why the Chilean company was chosen to 
represent us in Latin America for the maintenance or repair of 
all CASA products. We already have that commitment, which is 
unique because no authorization of this type to an industry has 
been given in any other part of the world." 
  He said the exchange of aeronautics technology between Spain 
and Chile has been fluid, and this transfer of technology will 
be strengthened soon with the signing of a new contract. He 
added: "We are open to any type of cooperation with Enaer."

  [Text] Lieutenant General Pyotr Deinekin [name as 
published], commander of the Russian Federation Air Force, said 
his institution opposes any type of bombing of the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, by Serbs, Croats, Muslims, or "anybody." 
  Deinekin made these comments on 22 March in an interview 
with 
EL MERCURIO during which he also referred to the visit of a 
large Russian delegation to FIDAE 94 [International Aerospace 
Fair] and his country's offer to train a Chilean cosmonaut. 
  Asked about the recent NATO threat to the Serbs surrounding 
Sarajevo (former Yugoslavia) to use airplanes to bomb them if 
they do not hand over their weapons to the United Nations, 
Deinekin categorically rejected such a possibility. 
  He explained that he has been saying for a long time that an 
air attack on the area is inappropriate, because aviation is not 
the way to face the type of civil war taking place in that part 
of Europe. 
  He said: "This is why the Russian Air Force is categorically 
against any type of bombing, by Croats, Serbs, Muslims, or 
anybody. It is categorically against it." 
  He added that the soldiers would survive a bombing because 
they are trained for it, and only the common people would be 
killed. 
  He said that to start the type of attack threatened by NATO, 
certain basic and essential requirements should be fulfilled. 
  He said: "All civilians -- old people, women, and children 
-- would have to be evacuated first before the bombings. Only 
then should an attack against military targets be made." 
  Otherwise, he said, there will be too much bloodshed, and no 
one can be forgiven. He added: "There should be no more 
bloodshed. I hope peace will prevail in the world." 
  He also said: "The Russian Air Force is very concerned about 
the situation in the former Yugoslavia, and there is also no 
doubt that the Russian Air Force is at peace." 
  Deinekin is carrying out a six-day visit to Chile as part of 
FIDAE 94. Gen. Deinekin emphasized the Russian presence at 
FIDAE with the participation of the best Russian experts and 
advanced fighting weapons. 
  He said: "This place offers us excellent possibilities to 
establish contacts with different groups." 
  He added that this type of fair shows the progress of 
aviation that can really contribute to the progress of people. 
He also reiterated the Russian Government's offer to train a 
Chilean cosmonaut. 
  Deinekin indicated that the Russian presence at FIDAE was 
not 
only aimed at showing its advanced combat systems but at 
ratifying its country's intention for real technological 
exchange.

  [Text] Quito, 5 Apr (EFE) -- The Ecuadoran Government 
announced today that it has decided to end the 20-month delay in 
the payment of its foreign debt service because it believes that 
its renegotiations with private creditor banks are "in their 
final phase." At a news conference, Finance Minister Cesar 
Robalino said, "I have authorized the payment of $5 million in 
interest as a symbolic show of the good faith and seriousness of 
the governnment, which wants to close a chapter that has 
considerably limited the country's development." 
  Ecuador had not paid its foreign debt service since May 
1992, 
during the government of President Rodrigo Borja (1988-92), who 
managed to include approximately $1 billion for that purpose in 
the total renegotiation package with the credit banks' 
Administrative Committee. Ecuador's debt with the private banks 
is close to $6.5 billion, half of the country's total debt. 
  Some government officials have pointed out that Ecuador is 
trying to reduce its debt with the private banks by at least 50 
percent, but Robalino did not confirm that percentage today "to 
avoid hindering the negotiations," he said. Robalino added that 
a few hours ago, the IMF directors received the so-called 
"letter of intention" that outlines the government's economic 
policy, which is expected to be approved by the full directorate 
during its 11 May session. Along with the presentation of this 
document, the Ecuadoran authorities asked the IMF for a loan of 
$180 million. Robalino announced that the government will later 
request "additional aid for a debt reduction program," but he 
declined to disclose further details. 
  At the end of May or in June, Robalino will present the same 
economic program to the Paris Club and request a refinancing 
loan of $400 million, which is approximately the amount of the 
debt Ecuador has with that organization. In sum, the Ecuadoran 
Government expects to receive, following passage of its economic 
program, approximately $1 billion in "fresh loans" from the IMF, 
World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and other 
international organizations. 
  The program outlined in the "letter of intention" 
anticipates 
"the country's economic growth, in real terms, by three percent 
up to December," which is below the expectations recently 
announced, Robalino added. "This implies that economic 
reactivation will surpass the population's growth and that the 
Ecuadoran people's standard of living will improve," he added. 
  The other goals of the 1994 program are to reduce annual 
inflation by 20 percent after dropping it from 60.2 percent in 
1992 to 31 percent in 1993; increase the country's International 
Monetary Reserve (IMR) to $1.5 billion; and put an end to the 
fiscal deficit. The minister also reiterated the government's 
"political resolve" to modernize and reduce the state apparatus 
and to privatize all institutions hampered by deficits.

  [Text] Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen has sworn in 
banker Marcel Laniado as new president of the National Council 
of Modernization, Conam. This institution will oversee the 
privatization process. It is expected that with this 
appointment Ecuador will embark on an aggressive state 
modernization process by reactivating the sale of state-run 
companies. This process lost steam in the past few months, as 
Conam has not had a president since mid-1993. 
  Laniado said that a common effort must be made to achieve 
our 
nation's social and economic well-being. Laniado noted it is 
impossible to develop unless all the community's sectors 
participate. He thus stressed: I invite you all to cooperate. 
  The government will submit the rules of the State 
Modernization Law approved in December 1993 by the Congress 
after an eight-month study. 
  Conam was created in 1992 at the conservative government's 
initiative. But is has been in serious crisis since the 
resignation of its board of directors last year. 
  [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 2335 GMT on 4 April, in a 
Quito-datelined report on the same topic, adds: "Finance 
Minister Cesar Robalino announced that the first state-run 
company to be privatized will be the telecommunications company 
(Emetel), a public sector giant. Defense Minister Jose Gallardo 
gave the assurance that while companies operated by the Armed 
Forces are diverse, the military will agree to any required 
sales. Also in line to be privatized are important petroleum 
and energy companies considered strategic by previous 
governments."]

criticizing the Colombian judicial system and the policy of the 
Prosecutor General's Office regarding the surrender of drug 
traffickers. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Sintura, has 
the prosecutor general capitulated in favor of drug traffickers 
in Colombia? 
  [Sintura] That is not true. A communique that we released 
clearly presents the Prosecutor General's Office position, which 
is this: As long as the existing law forbids drug trafficking 
in every stage, the Office will continue to fight drug 
traffickers and charge them in courts of law. 
  [Reporter] Does the United States have the moral authority 
to 
censure us like this? 
  [Sintura] Well, these are comments that one sovereign state 
makes to another. We have said a few things that we think are 
important, particularly because we understand that the 
generalizations made about the Colombian judicial system can be 
based on either incorrect interpretations of our legal system or 
insufficient reports. [end recording]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 6 Apr (DPA) -- Colombian Senate 
President Jorge Elias today asked the U.S. Government and 
judicial authorities not to meddle in his country's internal 
affairs. Elias was referring to criticisms made in Washington 
on the methods used to reduce the sentences of drug traffickers 
who surrender. 
  Elias, from the ruling Liberal party, defended the system 
implemented by President Cesar Gaviria while noting that it was 
copied from the method that has been used in the United States 
for several years. 
  "The the United States showed us the rules for surrendering 
to justice, the informers, the sentence reductions. We are 
following them here in Colombia," the congressman said in 
statements to the press. 
  The Senate president's position came in the wake of 
criticisms from the U.S. State Department on the "short" 
sentences for drug traffickers and on the contacts between 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff and Cali Cartel attorneys. 
  According to newspaper articles from Washington, the State 
Department believes the Colombian justice system is corrupt and 
is weak before the powerful drug traffickers. It is now in the 
hands of the U.S. Congress to decide whether to suspend judicial 
aid. 
  U.S. officials and spokesmen for the Colombian Prosecutor's 
Office said that in the past weeks the U.S. legal authorities 
stopped sending evidence to Santa Fe de Bogota against drug 
traffickers as a form of protest over statements by de Greiff, 
who said that repression is failing as a means of fighting drug 
trafficking. 
  De Greiff favors legalization of the drug trade as a 
strategy 
to dismantle the drug traffickers' multi-million dollar 
business. His ideas are questioned both in Colombia as well as 
the United States. 
  According to the Senate president, Colombia is a free, 
independent country that can decide if it wants to continue 
using sentence reduction for those who surrender. Since 1990, 
approximately 20 drug traffickers have availed themselves of 
this system. 
  Elias pointed out that U.S. judicial authorities "should be 
more concerned with their own problems -- because they have a 
lot of them -- before they make outrageous, unsubstantiated 
criticisms." 
  The decrees signed by Gaviria at the beginning of his 
administration provide for a significant sentence reduction for 
criminals who surrender, confess to at least one crime, and 
cooperate with justice. 
  De Greiff has been in contact with the attorneys of Gilberto 
Rodriguez, who is accused of being a Cali Cartel leader and is 
considering turning himself in.

  [Excerpts] Today the "National Newscast" learned about the 
U.S. State Department's annual report on the struggle against 
drug trafficking. 
  The report places the country in the dock and notes that 
corruption is widespread in Colombia, particularly in the 
judicial branch. [passage omitted ] 
  The policy of surrendering to justice which the State 
Department criticizes has also been a controversial issue in 
Colombia. 
  We consulted congressmen who approved the Penal Procedure 
Code: 
  [Begin recording] [Senator Hernan Echeverri] We politely 
reject this insinuation and this sort of U.S. intervention in 
our domestic affairs. 
  [Representative Ramiro Lucio] The Colombian Congress, 
independently -- without consulting the U.S. State Department, 
the Belgian Justice Ministry, or any other authority any where 
in the world -- decided to approve the Penal Procedure Code 
basically including the antidrug policy that the national 
government presented to us. 
  [Senator Alberto Santofimio Botero] What is happening is 
that we are increasingly losing our sovereignty. We are going 
to wind up asking the gringos what we are to do in order to 
issue laws in Colombia. 
  [Representative Edmundo Guevara] It is easier to see the 
mote in your brother's eye than to see the beam in your own. It 
is in the United States where sentences are negotiated. We 
copied from them. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Antonio Suarez, president of the National 
Association of Judicial Employees, and Gabriel de Vega, director 
of the National Drug Directorate, commented on the U.S. State 
Department's harsh, controversial report. 
  [Begin recording] [Suarez] We have been criticized for not 
having a strong enough hand, but we have a list of 262 judges 
and employees assassinated in Colombia. We would not have such 
a long history of bloodshed if we weren't doing something. The 
U.S. State Department's remarks are interfering and an attempt 
to meddle in Colombia's administration of justice. That is why 
we, just this once, support the prosecutor general's policy. 
  [De Vega] As far as my office is concerned, the report is 
objective and measured. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Caracol has just obtained the text of the letter 
sent by Gabriel Silva Lujan, Colombian ambassador to the United 
States, to U.S. Senator John Kerry regarding the senator's 
repeated criticism of the surrender policy and the 
interpretation and implementation of the Penal Procedure Code by 
the Prosecutor General's Office. In a strong response to an 
article by Senator Kerry, which was published in THE WASHINGTON 
POST yesterday, Ambassador Silva Lujan has stated: As you 
acknowledge, the Colombian Government differs in opinion with 
the Prosecutor General's Office, an independent office which is 
part of the judicial branch. These differences, Ambassador 
Silva Lujan has admitted, are still significant; therefore, he 
added, de Greiff's opinions on the negotiation of sentences and 
legalization of drugs do not represent those of the Colombian 
Government. 
  As I have said in the past, Gabriel Silva added, the 
Colombian Government will oppose the surrender of drug 
traffickers under conditions that are inconsistent with their 
level of criminal guilt. Furthermore, the Colombian Government 
has not supported, does not support, nor will support the 
legalization of drugs as a strategy in the antidrug struggle. 
  We at Caracol must add that Prosecutor General Gustavo de 
Greiff's position on this topic is 180 degrees different from 
that of Colombian Ambassador Silva Lujan in that letter. 
  In his two-page letter, whose original was in English and 
whose translation was obtained by Caracol, the ambassador added 
the Cali Cartel's greatest achievement would be to provoke a 
breakdown in judicial cooperation between the two countries. In 
the letter, the ambassador also vehemently rejected the 
assertion Colombia is a narcodemocracy: Colombia, the oldest 
and most politically stable democracy in Latin America, which 
has been maintained despite the narcoterrorists' attacks. The 
Colombian people have made enormous sacrifices in defending 
their democracy. Your hasty assertions are an affront against 
courageous commitment of Colombians to their institutions. 
  In his letter to Senator Kerry, Ambassador Silva also denied 
the senator's assertion the Cali Cartel has significant economic 
interests in the banking, finance, shipping, mining, coffee, 
petroleum, and floral sectors. The ambassador has said such 
assertions are unacceptable and groundless: It is untrue the 
Cali Cartel controls the most important sectors of the Colombian 
economy. These sectors are formed by respectable businessmen and 
companies, many of which have permanent relations with the 
United States. As in other countries, including the United 
States, organized crime seeks to infiltrate certain sectors of 
the legal economy, but this does not mean it controls some of 
these sectors or that the government tolerates its presence. 
  Ambassador Silva has also said that Kerry's statement that 
the Cali Cartel controls important elements of the Colombian 
media is false: For a long time, courageous journalists have 
been at the forefront of the crusade against drug traffickers. 
Investigative journalism in Colombia has played a fundamental 
role, revealing the illegal activities of drug-trafficking 
organizations. For this reason, many journalists and media have 
been victims of the drug cartels' kidnapping, assassinations, 
and terrorist attacks. In short, you have cast an undeserved 
shadow of doubt over the integrity of the Colombian private 
sector and media. 
  The ambassador also referred to the corruption linked to 
drugs, stating this is proliferating not only in Colombia but 
also in the United States; in fact, the ambassador added, 
according to a U.S. Justice Department report, more than 5,000 
federal employees have been found guilty of corruption between 
1970 and 1990. 
  This is the vigorous official reply by the Colombian 
ambassador in Washington, Gabriel Silva Lujan, to Senator Kerry, 
who again attacked our country in an article in THE WASHINGTON 
POST yesterday.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 6 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Cuban 
Government has accepted Colombia's conditions for supplying oil 
at international market prices beginning in July, Cuban 
Ambassador Jesus Martinez Revelo reported today . 
  In statements to Colombia's Radio Network (Caracol), the 
diplomat said his country promised to get the letters of credit 
demanded by the state-owned Ecopetrol [Colombian Petroleum 
Enterprise] to formally sign an agreement for the sale of crude 
oil. 
  The Colombian oil company said the guarantees offered by the 
island's government two weeks ago to finalize the negotiations 
were unsatisfactory. 
  Guido Nule, Colombian energy and mines minister, announced 
in 
February that his country would supply Havana with between 
15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil per day at international market 
prices. 
  According to the company's president, Juan Maria Rendon, the 
proposal from Fidel Castro's government to cover the cost of the 
transaction with sugar through a third-party transaction lacks 
the backing of a letter of credit. 
  Nevertheless, the Cuban diplomat explained that he recently 
met with Rendon and promised to get the letters of credit 
demanded by the state-owned business 
  "We will do whatever is necessary to defend our country's 
interests while reaching an agreement with Colombia in this 
matter," Martinez said, while emphasizing the Colombian 
Government's "positive attitude" toward Cuba. 
  Colombia's announcement that it would sell oil to the island 
displeased exiled Cubans in Miami, who threatened to boycott 
Colombian products if the negotiations are finalized. 
  Diplomatic relations between Colombia and Cuba were restored 
in October 1993 after a 12-year suspension. 
  Relations deteriorated in March after Santa Fe de Bogota's 
EL 
TIEMPO published a report on an alleged meeting between 
guerrilla leaders and a Colombian bishop in Havana, a report 
that was later denied by the same newspaper. 
  If the negotiations are completed, the Cuban Government will 
receive the first oil shipment in July, thus allowing it to meet 
one of that Caribbean country's most critical needs.

<F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Ayala; from the "24 Hours Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Just when everyone thought the controversy between 
the Prosecutor General's Office and the Catholic Church was 
settled, today we learn about a letter in which Prosecutor 
General Gustavo de Greiff reaffirms his accusations, saying 
there are bishops in Colombia who operate as couriers for 
guerrilla groups. 
  Some of the paragraphs in the prosecutor general's letter to 
Monsignor Pedro Rubiano, president of the Colombian Episcopal 
Conference, state: Some of the bishops have become just that, 
meaning, individuals who deliver messages from guerrilla groups 
to the government and to the public in general. It is dangerous 
to describe the enormous mistake of providing criminals with 
excuses to justify their acts--as has been done by assuring them 
they can still be guerrilla members--as pastoral evangelization; 
this means in Colombia one can continue to murder, steal, 
kidnap, and torment the nation as long as poverty and economic 
and social problems prevail. 
  Finally, the prosecutor general expresses regret over the 
actions carried out by certain bishops, adding that when he 
returns from his vacation he will establish his position with 
regard to the office which will investigate the clergy in 
Colombia.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Enrique Santos Calderon: "The Echo of the </F>
Ballot Boxes"] 
  [Text] A lot of abstention, yes, but what could be 
expected, given the confusion, the lack of seriousness, the 
absence of ideas, and the down-home populism that are proving to 
be one of the most debatable legacies of the Constitution of 
1991? 
  Moreover, it did not strike me as all that dramatic. 
Historically, voter participation in Colombia has always left a 
great deal to be desired. With a few extraordinary exceptions, 
such as the plebiscite of 1957, most elections have had little 
more than a 60-percent turnout. The abstention rate reached 70 
percent in the elections for the Constituent Assembly in 1991. 
After the congressional repeal, the elections to choose a new 
one had a 65-percent abstention rate. 
  This is disturbing, no matter how you look at it. It would 
be 
better to see the voter turnouts of 80 and even 90 percent that 
democracies such as Italy, Spain, and Costa Rica have. Not 
because voting is mandatory--that is a disagreeable 
requirement--but because they have greater political maturity 
and democratic consciousness. 
  Indifference, cynicism, apathy, skepticism, ignorance, 
rejection, or complacency--all these and more explain the 
persistence of abstentionism in Colombia. And it is not 
exclusive to us; in the United States, to choose an example not 
too far away, voter turnout is hardly ever more than 50 percent. 
  It is significant, in any event, that with so much political 
openness, so many new civil rights, the proliferation of 
electoral lists, new groups, special districts for blacks and 
Indians, etc., not only do people not flock to the polls, but 
voter participation actually declines. This is something to 
think about. 
  Furthermore, if blank ballots, the citizen's most explicit 
and conscientious way of expressing his repudiation for 
everything, are not given enough attention, people will feel 
that this form of protest vote is not worth the trouble, either, 
and will be discouraged from participating. 
  A central conclusion to be drawn from these legislative 
elections is that there are no national leaders. Only 16 
senators were elected by quotas, and the impressive battle for 
the leftovers reflects an fragmented political scene in which 
there is not a single figure with national appeal. 
  There are so many things to remark upon in these elections: 
the return of longstanding but very weakened electoral barons, 
such as Guerra Serna and Name Teran; the decline of others, such 
as Gustavo Dajer, Salcedo Baldion, and Humberto Pelaez; 
surprises such as that of Jimmy Chamorro, which confirm the 
political consolidation of the Christian groups; phenomena such 
as Poncho Renteria, whose 20,000-odd votes can be considered a 
protest against the political class. 
  I was saddened by the disappearance of Galanism as a 
parliamentary force and the absence of figures such as Maria 
Cristina Ocampo, Juan Lozano, and Alfonso Valdivieso from 
Congress. No leader has been able to fill that void (Gaviria is 
another matter), and the petty bickering they got involved in 
was the final blow to that liberal faction in Congress. 
  I was also disturbed by the defeat of the M-19 Democratic 
Alliance (AD M-19). It was completely annihilated, losing all 12 
seats. Figures such as Vera Grabe, Anibal Palacios, Bernardo 
Gutierrez, and Eduardo Chaves will not be around anymore. We may 
have disagreed with them, but they were an active presence and 
represented voices of criticism and debate. The debacle of the 
"M" confirms the limits of populism. But the parliamentary 
disappearance of the left (with the exceptions of Cepeda of the 
PC [Conservative Party] and Jorge Santos of the Revolutionary 
Independent Worker Movement, MOIR) may send the wrong signal to 
armed groups about the futility of the parliamentary, legal 
struggle. 
  Some columnists, such as Francisco Santos, have expressed 
the 
opinion that the big winner in these elections was Andres 
Pastrana, while Ernesto Samper lost out. This is a dubious 
argument, apparently based on the fact that the conservatives 
doubled their seats in the Senate--from 16 to 32--and in 
particular on the fact that Samper got 1.5 million votes less 
than Gaviria did in the Liberal Consultation of 1990. 
  It should be noted, however, that at that time of 
indignation 
and grief, people voted overwhelmingly against the dictatorship 
of terror that the drug lords were trying to impose, and in 
favor of the person who had been designated the successor of the 
slain leader. When they feel that something important is at 
stake--the survival of the system, for example--they go more 
decisively to the polls. 
  The results of the legislative elections can be interpreted 
in a number of ways, and everyone talks about the party 
according to how it went for them. But now that the electoral 
scene has been cleared of the confusion of lists and the 
question of the vice presidencies has been resolved, it is time 
for the home stretch in the race between Samper and Pastrana. 
  Samper made a big hit by naming Humberto De la Calle as his 
running mate. He is the ideal vice president, given his training 
and experience, his personal abilities, and his presidential 
stature. The Samper-De la Calle ticket clears the way for the 
Liberals and significantly strengthens Samper's presidential 
chances in an election where every vote will count. 
  Pastrana's ticket, on the other hand, does not have a 
comparable attraction. Not because Luis Fernando Ramirez is not 
up to the job, but because he does not give Andres what De la 
Calle gives Ernesto. The ticket looks very "kindergartenish." 
Lacking a candidate of De la Calle's stature, one whom Pastrana 
sought desperately, or a figure like Noemi Sanin, who prefers to 
save herself for more dignified jobs, the Pastrana-Ramirez 
ticket lacks that element of complementarity, that charismatic 
attractiveness that wins votes, which the Samper-De la Calle 
ticket does have. 
  Now, let the presidential campaign begin in earnest. Let us 
see the debates and the clash of ideas between the presidential 
and vice presidential aspirants. We have two months to find out 
how they plan to govern us; to know what their specific 
proposals are for peace, for the economy, and for the social 
ills that plague Colombians; and above all, to compare them.

  [Text] Yesterday, Interior Minister Carlos Podesta said: 
"Those responsible for kidnapping IBR [Agrarian Reform 
Institute] technicians will be brought to trial to answer for 
their crime. The government will not hesitate to resort to the 
law." Thus, he referred to peasant leaders who held a group of 
IBR technicians hostage in the settlement of General Resquin on 
7 April. 
  The minister said: "Sometimes people are too intolerant, but 
no one can take the law in their own hands. No one can impose 
his own kind of justice," the minister warned. Podesta said we 
are faced with "a public offense" and the government will act 
accordingly. 
  The minister added it is the responsibility of Attorney 
General Luis Escobar Faella to bring those responsible to trial. 
Asked if the situation will interrupt the negotiations 
currently underway between the government and peasants, Podesta 
said: "The peasant leaders siting at the negotiating table with 
the government cannot be held responsible for what other 
peasants do on their own." 
  Asked about the announcement that peasants will again close 
roads, the minister said: "The police will enforce the law. If 
there is a court order, we will use force, without a doubt." 
  Returning to the issue of the General Resquin "kidnappers," 
Podesta said: "Those responsible have names and we will press 
charges against them, without doubt." 
  Supreme Court Justice Jose Alberto Correa agreed with 
Podesta. He said the incident is a public offense, adding that 
the crime of kidnapping is clearly defined in the Penal Code. 
Correa also said the attorney general may very well act on its 
own to seek justice when laws are violated.

communique stating its loyalty to the president of the Republic 
on the occasion of the second anniversary of the institutional 
change that took place on 5 April. 
  It says that the support given to the president's decision 
was appropriate because it was based on the true situation of a 
country that is now on the way to achieving the desired national 
pacification after a period of chaos. 
  The communique signed by the head of the Armed Forces Joint 
Command, the military commanders, and the National Police 
general director says they will continue to work to consolidate 
this process that is the basis and guarantee for a lasting and

  [Excerpts] Peru produces about 2,000 metric tons of basic 
cocaine paste per year, of which 90 percent is "exported" by the 
mafias to various places in the world, according to an 
evaluation in the draft of the National Prevention and Drug 
Control Plan. 
  About 900 metric tons of refined basic cocaine (valued at 
about $600 million) are produced from the aforementioned 
tonnage. This represents a potential annual production of 
between 650 and 700 metric tons of cocaine hydrochlorate. 
  The figures in this document are very revealing and make 
clear the increase of coca leaf's cultivation for illegal ends 
and the "cocalization" of the economy. [passage omitted] 
  These figures also demonstrate the very large differences 
that exist between the legal and illegal cultivation of coca 
leaf. 
  There are at least 200,000 campesino families that illegally 
cultivate the leaf, while there are only 27,000 families that 
cultivate it legally, located mainly in La Convencion and Lares 
Valleys in Cuzco Department. 
  Exact statistics do no exist, but it is estimated that 
between 15,000 and 20,000 hectares are currently dedicated to 
the legal cultivation of the leaf and a minimum of 10,000 metric 
tons of coca leaf are produced yearly. This is a very small 
quantity when it is compared to the 223,900 metric tons produced 
illegally. 
  But the functioning National Coca Enterprise (Enaco) is a 
demonstration of state organizations' lack of efficiency in the 
control of these cultivations. 
  Enaco is charged with exercising the monopoly of the 
commercialization and industrialization of coca leaf, but it 
does not control even one-half of the area and production of 
legal coca leaf production. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Sixth and final part of a judicial reform series by Victor </F>
Andres Ponce] 
  [Text] The history of the judicial branch's budget has 
always been characterized by a lack of resources to efficiently 
serve the demands of justice. 
  During the past few years the judicial branch's percentage 
of 
the country's budget has varied a lot. From 1965 to 1969, the 
average was 0.52 percent. It was 0.59 percent from 1970 to 1974. 
  Matters did not change during the 1980's (it must be 
recalled 
that the 1979 Constitution established that 2 percent of the 
budget was to be set aside for the judicial branch). From 1980 
to 1984, the judicial branch's average share of the budget was 
0.42 percent. From 1985 to 1990, the average was 0.55 percent. 
  Now, it is worthwhile to comment that in 1964 salaries 
accounted for 86.7 percent of the judicial branch's budget, 
while in 1990 it was only 20.9 percent and a mere 14 percent in 
1994. In other words, judges' salaries became a mere ancillary 
element when the budget was being drafted. 
<H5>  The Current Situation </H5>
  In 1994, the judicial branch submitted a budget for 440 
million soles. The Treasury allocated barely 116 million soles, 
0.70 percent of the national budget. 
  Of the 95 million soles asked for in the remunerations 
category, only 16.8 million soles were given. In other words, 
less than 20 percent of what was asked for. And what is even 
worse, in this item there has been a 2 million-sol reduction 
compared with last year's budget because the judicial branch 
received 18.5 million soles in 1993. 
  As mentioned in a previous report, a Supreme Court justice 
gets a salary of 3,800 soles. The judicial branch's governing 
law establishes that a superior justice must get 90 percent of a 
Supreme Court justice's salary, in other words 3,400 soles. But 
matters are very different: He gets only 1,600 soles. 
  In the case of penal, civil, and assorted judges, the law 
indicates that they must get 80 percent of a Supreme Court 
justice's salary, 3,000 soles in other words. Reality is 
dramatic: They only earn 1,100 soles. 
  Justices of the peace they should earn 2,600 soles, but they 
only get 700. A judicial branch official said: "In submitting 
this plan, our objective was to pay the salaries in accordance 
with the law." But this will not be possible now. 
  Regarding the works category, the judicial branch requested 
15 million soles and was given 7.439 million. The sum that had 
been requested was to have been used to equip the new courts 
that will operate in the former seats of the Economy and 
Education Ministries and for other minor works. 
  A sum of 28 million soles was asked for assets, but the 
Treasury only released 10.2 million. 
<H5>  Some Improvements </H5>
  But not everything is bad. Important improvements have been 
made this year. For example: There is a rule that allows the 
judicial branch Executive Council to administer its own 
resources within determined parameters: It can use 30 percent of 
its budget to improve salaries. 
  This rule in itself is revolutionary because there have been 
occasions when the judicial branch has not been able to dispose 
of its own resources, and, therefore, could not resolve problems 
within its scope. 
  For example: In 1993 it was hoped the category for its own 
resources would be 10 million soles, but 13.2 million soles were 
accrued, over 3 million soles more than estimated. 
  Since the budget was controlled by the Economy Ministry's 
Public Credit Directorate and the programming is rigid, a budget 
increase request had to be submitted to Congress. This was not 
obtained due to the complicated and bureaucratic rules. 
  A high-ranking judicial branch official has said: "Had a 
larger budget been obtained, it would have been possible to 
establish the first court of appeals in buildings that used to 
seat the Economy and Education Ministries. Progress could also 
have been made in eradicating corruption from the courts." 
  This new situation allows officials of the Executive Council 
of the judicial branch to increase its resources. The 1994 
budget has 14 million soles but based on several measures there 
are plans to collect 24 million soles. 
  How is it possible to reach this goal? For example, a 
decision was made to end the forging the paid certificates of 
the Record of Sentences. 
  Things would go better if a law -- which is being prepared 
-- 
is approved returning to the judicial branch its right to 
legalize accounting books. In this way it can collect another 
10.2 million soles. 
  Something similar will occur with the official application 
forms that must be purchased. There will be no longer any 
forging because high security paper will be used. This 
represents greater security. This measure is expected to yield 
another 30 million soles. 
  Despite the law of own resources and the ambitious projects 
of the judicial branch, some Economy Ministry officials want to 
deny this right to the judicial branch. To do that, they talk 
about the differences between the concept of "own revenues" used 
in the law favoring the judicial branch and the "other concepts 
of the Treasury" established in the Budget Law. A harsh 
campaign must be carried out on behalf of the judicial branch. 
  Another important improvement is the Basic Spending 
Concentration Program included in the 1994 National Budget. 
This program will be used in judicial matters, health, and 
education. It will serve to make disbursements from the 
Treasury without the ridigity of the budget regulations. 
  The idea is to increase the number of justices of the peace 
with law degrees and to train those who do not have any degree. 
It is estimated that $10 million will be invested in this 
project. 
<H5>  A Basic Objective </H5>
  The possibility of managing its own resources will make the 
judicial branch eligible for credit from national and 
international organizations. Sources close to the Executive 
Council of the judicial branch have said that one way to finally 
resolve the problem of the low salary of judges would be to 
request a loan from the World Bank or the Inter-American 
Development Agency. A high- ranking official said: "A request 
of $20 to $30 million payable over two to three years could be 
made." 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  An evaluation of the figures and percentages allocated to 
the 
judicial branch this year indicates that apparently no important 
changes would be made. There is a growing trend for even less 
money being allocated for salaries. 
  The law allowing the judicial branch to manage its own 
resources opens the possibility of producing its own income and 
being eligible for international credit. The reaction of some 
Economy Ministry officials who want to deny this right to the 
judicial branch cannot be understood. 
  The Basic Spending Concentration Program represents an 
important progress because it establishes priorities by the 
government. 
  But a budget to solve all the needs of justice is still far 
away.

<F P=106> [Article by staff correspondent Sergio Berrutti from Punta </F>
del Este] 
  [Text] While the 17th Inter-American Naval Conference will 
resolve to continue with the Unitas operations, the commanders 
in chief of the Navies of American countries--who are also 
meeting in Punta del Este--agreed that although "the threat of a 
war has decreased, regional conflicts will increase and these 
conflicts will mark the guidelines in defense matters." 
  This information was given to EL OBSERVADOR by James Coates, 
the commander in chief of the Uruguayan Navy, who also pointed 
out that Navies will place greater emphasis on safeguarding the 
interests of the state within its territorial waters. 
  President Luis Alberto Lacalle on 24 March lunched with the 
commanders in chief of the 16 participating countries. Prior to 
the luncheon, he said: "The naval topic has an enormous 
importance for Uruguay, because our territorial waters are 
nearly as large as our land area." 
  He maintained: "The government has enhanced the nation's 
maritime role. During our tenure we have incorporated six units 
and are carrying out patrols. We are protecting our natural 
resources. We are ready for the task of an eventual defense that 
one hopes will not occur." 
  Coates told EL OBSERVADOR: "The reason for these meetings is 
to exchange ideas, opinions, and to submit papers on the common 
links of the Continent's Navies." He added: "The naval roles 
within the framework of the new world order were the main topics 
discussed at this conference." 
  He remarked: "There was an exchange of information regarding 
the policing role by the Navies and on the fight against 
trafficking." 
  Coates indicated that a common point that was expounded by 
the participating countries was the fact that "governments have 
become more relaxed, that the threat of a war is seen as minor, 
that regional conflicts will increase, and thus they will set 
guidelines for defense matters." 
  Uruguay, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, 
Chile, 
Ecuador, the United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, 
Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Venezuela, and a delegation from the 
Inter-American Defense Board are participating in the meeting, 
which will conclude this coming weekend.

<F P=106> [Article by Daniel Rondan] </F>
  [Text] Mercedes -- General Daniel Garcia, Army commander in 
chief, held a news conference here. Asked about the Army 
position if the Broad Front won the election, he said: Uruguay 
"will have absolutely clear elections and the winner will be 
able to exercise the power granted him by the people's votes 
without any type of limitations." 
  Gen. Garcia was born and attended school in Dolores, Soriano 
Department. A son, his grandchildren, and his parents still live 
here. He is visiting Mercedes with General Staff Chief General 
Juan A. Lezama; General Juan Curuchet, 2d Army Division 
commander; and Colonel Carlos Silva, 2d Infantry Brigade 
commander. He is on a routine tour of the area. 
  During a news conference, the Army commander in chief talked 
about many issues, including military personnel salaries and 
peace missions abroad. 
  Asked about the draft bill presented by the executive branch 
in Congress that will allow the Armed Forces to eventually 
participate in public security activities, Garcia said: "It is 
an issue that will demand the attention of legislators. They 
consider it a national priority." 
  Regarding the possibility of sending Uruguayan soldiers to 
other countries, Garcia said: "In the case of Georgia, so far we 
only have a request to say whether Uruguay would be willing to 
participate with a battalion in a peace mission in that country. 
The government authorized an answer saying that if our 
participation is requested, we would acquiesce. But the United 
Nations still has not decided whether it will intervene in 
Georgia. The only UN personnel there are observers." 
  Regarding the situation of military personnel salaries, 
Garcia said there has always been a great distance between needs 
and possibilities, adding, however, that the last budget 
contemplated a substantial improvement of military salaries, 
"the most important increase since 1985." The country's economic 
situation does not permit better salaries, which would be 
desirable, Garcia said. The commander believes the increase has 
brought salary levels closer to actual needs. 
  Asked about President Luis Alberto Lacalle's remarks that he 
had to deal with the internal military crisis alone, Garcia 
said: "That is a political problem and I think the person who 
can best answer your question is the president himself. I am not 
the right person to judge the president's remarks. We have 
always tried to serve the institution and the country as best as 
we could from the Army command as well as from all our previous 
positions." 
  The Batlleist Forum [Colorado Party faction] is opposed to 
the designation of General Mario Aguerrondo as military attache 
to the United States. Gen. Garcia said: "It is a political 
expression. I do not think it is quite like that, but it is 
within the rules of the game. Gen. Aguerrondo is fulfilling a 
service mission. He was appointed by the executive branch. There 
are no legal problems. There might be objections from a 
political point of view. But they do not belong to the commander 
in chief's sphere of action. It is beyond his responsibilities." 
  Regarding the so-called "Berrios case" [Chilean security 
agent Eugenio Berrios kidnapped in Uruguay in 1993], Garcia said 
the Army finished its own investigation of the case. "The 
Berrios case is now being handled by the courts. All individuals 
involved testified. So far no one has been indicted. This is a 
good indication because it means the court has not found enough 
evidence to try anyone. I hope the case will be definitively 
closed, at this level, in the near future." 
  Asked about the possible consequences if the Broad Front won 
the elections, the Army commander in chief said: "I hope our 
country will have absolutely clean elections and the winner will 
be able to exercise the power granted him by the people's votes 
without any type of limitations. That is my hope and that is 
what I expect it will happen."
