<F P=106> [Report by Fernando Granda] </F>
  [Text] Tingo Maria, 22 Apr (EFE) -- The Peruvian Army 
continues its counterterrorist offensive that it began on 5 
April in the Northern Peruvian jungle and is closing in on three 
Shining Path [SL] columns. 
  General Alfredo Rodriguez, the counterterrorist front 
commander of the zone, disclosed that the latest clash between 
terrorists and two Army units took place near the town of San 
Isidro. 
  Sources have stated that soldiers clashed with the SL "Red 
Sea" column, which retreated to what the military call "Spring 
Valley." 
  After the terrorists withdrew, Army troops occupied a SL 
base 
and are pursuing "Red Sea" fugitives who, according to military 
sources, are headed by two SL leaders known as "Rayo" and 
"Pescadito." 
  The military forces involve 380 men, of which 200 are combat 
troops and 180 support troops. They are closing in on the 
terrorists' retreat. 
  Gen. Rodriguez explained that the Peruvian troops are using 
a 
"pincer" move against the terrorists. He added that during 17 
days of clashes, 14 terrorists have been killed and another 15 
have been captured. 
  The military commander explained that these operations, on 
the banks of the Huallaga River in Leoncio Prado Province, 
Huanuco Department in the Northern jungle, have not affected 
civilians living in the combat zones. 
  Gen. Rodriguez said the Army has seized from the SL members 
220 hand grenades, grenade-launcher rifles, 14 FAL rifles, 
bombs, shotguns, percussion caps, and a great quantity of 
ammunition. 
  The terrorist columns are believed to comprise about 250 
men. 
  Military sources have stated that during the past few days 
hundreds of children, women, and elderly people who were forced 
to support the SL in the Peruvian Northern jungle, have 
surrendered to the Army. 
  The source did not disclose the number, site, nor exact date 
when these people surrendered. These people "were slaves" of the 
SL and were divided into "grass-roots forces" and "peoples' 
committees." 
  The SL seems to have used the same system as in the central 
region, where they enslaved thousands of indigenous Ashaninkas 
who are now being gradually rescued. 
  In the next few hours members of the Congressional Human 
Rights Commission and Attorney General Blanca Nelida Colan, will 
travel to the site of operations to try to verify reports on 
alleged attacks against civilians by helicopter gunships. 
  The National Coordinating Board of Human Rights has witness 
reports of helicopter-fired rocket attacks against towns along 
the Huallaga River and a video in which bodies of the alleged 
victims are shown. 
  Legal Defense Institute Director Ernesto de la Jara has said 
that some 40 to 50 civilians died in these attacks and the 
National Coordinating Board of Human Rights has requested the 
intervention of the Red Cross, which has not been allowed to 
visit the zone. 
  Army Commander General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, travelled to 
Tingo Maria with 30 journalists. Today they will be taken to the 
combat zone. 
  Gen. Hermoza said the SL is dismantled, the Army is 
obstructing its retreat, and the military chiefs are urging the 
terrorists to surrender.

  [Text] Lima, 21 Apr (AFP-NA) -- Analysts today said the 
approval by the great majority in Congress of a draft bill 
submitted by the Lima Bar Association proposing that the 
original National Elections Board (JNE) run the general 
elections scheduled for April 1995, follows a recommendation by 
President Alberto Fujimori to avoid any suspicion of fraud. 
  After three months of unsuccessful debates, the government 
bloc suddenly on the evening of 20 April sided with the minority 
to approve the proposal for the JNE to organize the elections, 
thus freezing the implementation of a new elections system 
provided for in the new Constitution (1993). 
  One political analyst said: "This drastic change was 
prompted 
by a recommendation by President Fujimori." 
  The chief of state allegedly said: "There can be no 
suspicion 
of fraud if the adversary's rules are used." 
  The draft bill was approved by 55 votes to four, with three 
abstentions. It is divided into 11 articles. The first article 
states: The JNE, fully renewed, will organize the national 
electoral process for the election of president, vice president, 
and legislators. 
  The JNE will comprise five members: One chosen by the 
Supreme 
Court, one by the Board of Supreme Court Prosecutors, one by the 
Lima Bar Association, one by the deans of the law schools of the 
public universities, and one by the deans of the law schools of 
private universities. 
  It also states that by next July, at the latest, the JNE 
should have a comprehensive single text of the election rules to 
be used in April 1995. 
  Moreover, it must draft the regulations for the operation of 
the voters' registry and come up with a vote return system to 
expedite the vote tally. 
  Constitution Commission President Carlos Torres y Torres 
justified the "sudden change of mind," stating that it sought to 
prevent people from "talking about fraud." 
  Henry Pease of the Democratic Left Movement (MDI), among 
others, praised the decision. 
  "The opposition was being pressed by public opinion and had 
no other alternative than to back down."

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "The </F>
Fallacy of Social Dumping"] 
  [Text] The speech with which U.S. Vice President Al Gore 
closed the GATT meeting gave the wrong tone to the transition 
period that the multilateral trade organ has now begun toward 
its transformation into the World Trade Organization (WTO). The 
U.S. vice president brought to the fore the same subject that 
the U.S. and French delegations unsuccessfully tried to include 
in the ministerial declaration of Marrakech: the social dumping 
issue. Like almost all the initiatives of the Clinton 
administration, this is a clumsy, incomplete proposal that has 
provoked ambivalent perceptions and dubious feelings. It gives 
the impression of an ingredient that has been deliberately 
undercooked to be used later for whatever purpose. The 
representatives of developing countries have consequently, and 
rightly, rejected the idea. No matter how good the intentions 
of the U.S. Government -- which has declared its desire to 
preserve human rights -- the effects of a social agenda will be 
those of the most glaring protectionism, the victims of which 
will be those economies that use manpower in large volume. 
  This issue has emerged with a touch of irony. Developing 
nations have for decades tried to go from theoretical discussion 
and factual descriptions to the adoption of concrete 
compensatory mechanisms for resolving the problem of the 
deteriorated terms of exchange. While the price per volume of 
raw materials and semi-processed products exported by poor 
countries was steadily dropping, the manufactured products 
exported by industrialized countries consumed -- at a growing 
speed -- the currency reserves of poor countries. Entire 
forests were cut down for producing paper on which to print the 
speeches and studies on the deterioration of the terms of 
exchange made at multilateral forums like ECLA [Economic 
Commission for Latin America], Ecosoc [Economic and Social 
Council] [Consejo Economico y Social], GATT, and in universities. 
  This has produced no change in world trade. Over the past 30 
years the price of coffee -- which supported the economy of 
entire nations -- has dropped to the current levels, at which it 
is impossible to run a farm. Copper, which guaranteed 
prosperity of an extractive agricultural country like Chile, is 
today anachronistic, and fiber optics and other energy 
transmission techniques are expected to soon declare its final 
death as a generator of wealth. 
  All this has produced compulsory changes, always involving 
economic loss and social friction which, whenever well-managed, 
are recalled by people as a difficult transition to better 
times. In several cases, though, it has placed countries with 
an extractive, primary economy on the list of the poor. 
  Vice President Al Gore now also wants the terms of exchange 
to be regulated by the salaries and social rights of workers in 
exporting countries. The argument is terrifyingly simple. An 
underlying condition is that because human rights are the same 
everywhere and in all nations, social rights should also be the 
same. This will finally lead to the equalization of salaries, 
just as the trend toward globalization of production has 
equalized prices. A surtax should be applied to the production 
of countries in which manpower is cheaper and social rights 
narrower or less generous. This surtax will eliminate the 
comparative advantage of lower personnel costs. 
  It is not necessary to say that this funny theory will clash 
with the vast majority of developing countries, which over the 
past few years have oriented their industry toward the export 
sector. Industrialized countries will look for the solution to 
the problems that have been caused by their own high social 
costs inside developing countries, or in countries that have 
recently developed their industry. They will be transforming 
conditions that fall within the jurisdiction of national organs 
into conditions for international trade. The fact that 
countries either pay high salaries or give few social benefits 
to their workers to promote their exports would at no time be 
taken into account. Low salaries are caused by low 
productivity, and this cannot be resolved through tariff 
surcharges. 
  The proposal by Al Gore actually aims at transferring to 
developing countries the social and unemployment problems that 
industrialized countries are now confronting. At the Marrakech 
meeting Foreign Minister Celso Amorim went right to the point in 
his speech, in which he repudiated the social dumping thesis. 
It is an anti-liberal thesis driven by the siren song of 
freedom and equality. It is protectionism in its most 
detestable form, because it distorts values that must be 
preserved.

<F P=106> [Article by Livia Ferrari] </F>
  [Text] The foreign trade promotion program proposed by the 
Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MICT) does not take 
into account the international rules that were ratified in the 
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs 
(GATT). 
  In the opinion of the Association of Brazilian Exporters 
(AEB), for this reason it will not be accepted by the 
multilateral trade organ. 
  The program provides for the creation of fiscal incentive 
mechanisms, which contradict the GATT Code of Subsidies. The 
third article of the Code condemns the creation of foreign trade 
incentives based on "export performance" [preceding two words in 
English]. Despite this, the MICT project foresees that in order 
to have the fiscal incentives approved, enterprises will take 
minimum export commitments. 
  The matter was analyzed yesterday during a meeting of AEB 
entrepreneurs, for whom the project must be subject to external 
auditing for evaluation of specific conflicts with GATT 
principles. 
  AEB President Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes is concerned 
that the program proposed by the government -- despite the fact 
that it is more generalized than the previous one (described in 
Draft Bill No. 3721/93, which provided for incentives for 
automobile exports only) -- will artificially create unequal 
competition conditions for various industrial sectors. 
  Pratini de Moraes said: "The old Befiex (an export fiscal 
incentive program created by Pratini de Moraes himself, when he 
was minister of industry and commerce, during the Medici 
administration) was a good program, and fulfilled its objective 
more than 20 years ago." In his opinion, the best way to 
support Brazilian foreign trade is to eliminate the tax burden 
on exports.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "Friendly </F>
Fire"] 
  [Text] Jet fighter pilots are naturally aggressive. If they 
were not, they would fly transportation airplanes or sell 
insurance. That is why when they find two helicopters flying in 
an exclusion zone it is not surprising that they would shoot 
their missiles and down their targets. The problem comes 
afterward, when they find out that the helicopters they downed 
were American, like the F-15's they were flying in. The 26 
American, British, French, and Turkish men who died as a result 
of "friendly fire" in Iraq were truly victims of a series of 
mistakes that, considering the first reactions of the U.S. 
Government, will not be corrected very soon. 
  The helicopters were downed in full daylight. Apparently the 
Friend or Foe Identification (IFF) systems of the two 
helicopters, which were being followed by earth radars and an 
AWACS, did not work. The equipment failure or the pilots' 
forgetfulness in turning it on was a fatal element, but not the 
only one. The F-15's made visual contact with the helicopters. 
They confused American Blackhawk helicopters with Soviet Hinds, 
but what is really strange is that they did not make any attempt 
to positively identify or scare away the transgressors from the 
exclusion area. This shows that the firing rules of the pilots 
who patrol northern Iraq are extremely strict and leave crucial 
decisions to the criteria of men submitted to extremely tense 
conditions. This time, the too-quick finger on the trigger took 
the lives of 26 fellow countrymen and allies. 
  The tragedy was the result of two prior decisions. The first 
one, reflected in U.S. interventions in the past few years, lies 
in the belief in air power as a solution to political problems. 
Was it necessary to protect the Kurds in the north and the 
Shiites in the south? Two air exclusion zones were established 
and whatever flew there was to be downed. Are the Serbs not 
bombing Sarajevo and Gorazde? Down them and silence their 
artillery with air-to-ground fire. No matter how technologically 
advanced the American air arsenal may be, it cannot solve what 
should be solved by politics. The situation of the Kurds, the 
Shiites, and the Iraqis in Iraq and the Moslems in Bosnia will 
only be solved when somebody presents, at the appropriate 
moment, a peace plan attending to the needs of all parties. 
  The use of the Air Force may in some cases speed up the 
moment to which we are referring. But its use will always imply 
siding with one party, and this decision cannot be made 
independently of the conflict's context. The United States and 
NATO cannot pretend that the air exclusion and confiscation of 
heavy weapons are part of an ideal quest for peace and nothing 
else. These measures reduce the military capability of the Serbs 
without interrupting the hostilities. And when the Serbs realize 
the limitations of the use of air power -- estranged from an 
efficient policy -- they attempt to reduce or annul the threat. 
When attacked from the air, the Serbs in Bosnia began to treat 
the UN land forces as hostages and a foreign army that needs 
special permission to move. From there to the recovery of the 
confiscated weapons was nothing but a small step. 
  In Iraq the Kurds were used as a pretext to create 
conditions 
that were believed to lead to the downfall of Saddam Husayn. The 
Iraqi dictator is only one of the Kurds' enemies. The other 
enemies are the governments of Turkey, Iran, and Russia, 
countries where the Kurdish nation is disseminated. The Kurdish 
nation will only be able to build its desired national state 
through the breaking away of one or several of these countries, 
which is something practically unthinkable. Thus, the objective 
of the exclusion zone is to prevent Saddam Husayn from 
controlling the entire Iraqi territory. Ever since the exclusion 
zone was imposed, the Kurds in Iraq have been bombed by the 
Turkish Air Force, a U.S. ally through NATO. The 26 Americans, 
British, French, and Turks did not die to protect the lives of 
the Kurds. They were the victims of a confusing and inconsistent 
policy.

  [Text] The first Brazilian trade mission since the 
reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Vietnam in 1989 
departed on 15 April for Hanoi. The group, which is headed by 
Ambassador Celso Marcos, chief of the Itamaraty Trade Promotion 
Department, is made up of diplomats and representatives of 
several sectors of the economy. 
  The trip's purpose is to detect business opportunities as a 
result of the Vietnamese economic opening since the end of last 
year. The civil construction, energy and electricity, oil and 
petrochemical, agrobusiness, and car parts industries are 
represented in the mission, AGENCIA BRASIL has reported. 
  The Vietnamese Government already has informed Itamaraty of 
its interest in developing economic and trade relations with 
Brazil, especially in infrastructure projects. There are 
considerable possibilities in other fields, another Brazilian 
diplomat said. Thus, these contacts may increase bilateral 
trade, like in the fields of food and heavy machinery 
manufacturing. 
  The oil field also is interesting for Brazil, which is why 
Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation], Braspetro 
[Petrobras International, Inc.], and Furnas [Furnas Electric 
Power Plants, Inc.] have sent representatives on this mission. 
  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim believes the intensification 
of relations with Vietnam may open new markets for Brazilian 
companies as well as for Vietnamese companies. Last year, 
Brazilian exports to Vietnam were $4.2 million, while imports 
from there were $13.5 million. Brazil imported nearly $3 million 
worth of rice alone. The main goods exported by Brazil were 
chemical products and industrial equipment. 
  The rapprochement with Vietnam is part of the Brazilian 
Foreign Ministry's strategy to increase trade with the Asian 
countries that have had the greatest economic growth indexes in 
the whole world in the past few years. Nearly 16 percent of 
Brazilian international trade is carried out with this region. 
Trade with this region, according to Itamaraty, is well below 
its potential. 
  Beside the mission that went to Hanoi, Itamaraty also will 
demonstrate interest in intensifying diplomatic relations with 
Vietnam by choosing a building for a Brazilian embassy. The 
Brazilian Embassy in Singapore is currently responsible for 
Brazilian interests in Vietnam.

  [Text] President Itamar Franco today presided over the 
graduation ceremony of new diplomats from the Rio Branco 
Institute. In his speech the president mentioned the credibility 
Brazil is gaining in the international scene. He stressed the 
success obtained by Brazilian diplomacy in the UN Security 
Council and the GATT Uruguayan Round. 
  President Itamar Franco also assessed the economic situation 
and said the reorientation of the economy is a result of the 
consolidation of democracy. The president mentioned Brazil's 
more competitive situation in the international market, 
especially its presence in the regional economy: 
  [Begin recording] Mercosur [Common Market of the South] is a 
clear example of success. Exchange among its members increased 
from $3.5 billion in 1990 to $8 billion in 1993. Associations 
among enterprises and institutions in the four countries are 
increasing, and large transnational companies are making 
investments in the subregion with an eye on the free trade zone 
that will soon take total effect. We will continue prioritizing 
Mercosur, whose consolidation we are seeking. For this purpose 
we will continue to pursue the objectives of uniform customs in 
the terms and conditions agreed upon in Colonia [Uruguay]. [end 
recording] 
  The president also stressed the importance of environmental 
matters and he called the attention of the developed countries 
to their responsibility in this field: 
  [Begin recording] Brazil, with its enormous environmental 
patrimony, has a share of responsibility in the environmental 
issue as well as in the promotion of sustained development. The 
developed countries should assume their responsibilities, 
especially those related to the transfer of financial resources 
and healthy technologies to developing countries. [end recording] 
  President Itamar Franco told the newly graduated diplomats 
that the quest for peace and international cooperation for 
economic and social development must be at the top of the 
international affairs' agenda.

  [Text] The Brazilian Public Opinion and Statistics 
Institute, Ibope, has released its latest opinion poll on the 
October election. This is how Brazilians would vote if the 
presidential election were held today. 
  Ibope considered three possible candidates for the Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party, PMDB. Here are the figures: 
  If the election were held today, according to Ibope, Workers 
Party candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva would be first with 34 
percent of the votes; Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso of the 
Brazilian Social Democracy Party would be second with 17 
percent; former Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola of the 
Democratic Labor Party would be third with 9 percent; former Sao 
Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia -- if he were the PMDB candidate 
-- would be fourth with 6 percent; Senator Espiridiao Amin of 
the Progressive Renewal Party would be fifth with 3 percent; and 
Liberal Party candidate Flavio Rocha would be sixth with 2 
percent. The rate of undecided voters, blank and void ballots, 
would total 29 percent. 
  Let us now see what would be the electoral outcome if the 
PMDB candidate were Senator and former President Jose Sarney: 
  In this case, if the election were held today, Lula would be 
first with 31 percent; Cardoso would be second with 16 percent; 
Sarney would be third with 13 percent; Brizola would be fourth 
with 8 percent; Amin would be fifth with 3 percent; and Rocha 
would be sixth with 2 percent. The rate of undecided voters, 
blank and void ballots would total 27 percent. 
  If the PMDB candidate were former Parana Governor Roberto 
Requiao, the electoral outcome would be as follows: 
  Lula would remain in first place with 34 percent; Cardoso 
would be second with 17 percent; Brizola would be third with 10 
percent; Amin and Requiao would be joint fourth with 3 percent, 
and Rocha would be at the bottom of the list with 2 percent. 
The rate of undecided voters, blank and voided ballots would be 
27 percent. 
  The Ibope survey also inquired how Brazilians would vote in 
a 
runoff election among the most voted candidates during the first 
round. Four possible alternatives were considered. Here are 
the results: 
  A runoff between Lula and Cardoso: Lula would obtain 44 
percent and Cardoso 32 percent. The rate of undecided voters, 
blank and voided ballots would total 24 percent. 
  A runoff between Lula and Sarney: Lula would obtain 44 
percent and Sarney 31 percent. The rate of undecided voters, 
blank and voided ballots would total 25 percent. 
  A runoff between Lula and Quercia: Lula would obtain 51 
percent and Quercia would obtain 19 percent. The rate of 
undecided voters, blank and voided ballots would total 30 
percent. 
  A runoff between Lula and Requiao: Lula would obtain 52 
percent and Requiao would obtain 17 percent. The rate of 
undecided voters, blank and voided ballots would total 31 
percent. 
  Ibope also asked voters who would be the best candidate for 
the PMDB. Senator Sarney is first with 37 percent, Quercia is 
second with 18 percent, and Requiao is third with 11 percent. A 
total of 36 percent of those polled stated that they have no 
preference among these candidates. 
  Ibope also asked voters for whom they would not vote under 
any circumstance. Brizola appeared as the most rejected 
candidate. Here are the figures: 
  According to Ibope, 49 percent of those polled said they 
would never vote for Brizola; 34 percent said they would not 
vote for Quercia; 31 percent would not vote for Lula or Rocha; 
30 percent would not vote for Amin; 29 percent would not vote 
for Sarney; 27 percent would not vote for Requiao; and 21 
percent would not vote for Cardoso. Some 7 percent of those 
polled said they have nothing against any of these candidates 
while 9 percent declined to state their opinion. 
  Ibope polled 2,000 voters nationwide between 13 and 17 
April.

  [Text] Foreign ministers of Latin American countries are 
meeting in Sao Paulo with their European Union [EU] 
counterparts. This is the first time such a meeting has been 
held in Brazil. Issues ranging from economy to nuclear 
disarmament will be discussed. 
  Brazil was chosen to host the fourth ministerial meeting 
between European and Latin American countries because the Latin 
American Parliament, Parlatino, is headquartered here. Army 
policemen supported by military policemen are handling security 
because the Federal Police are on strike. The 25 foreign 
ministers, all of them interested in finding common solutions to 
comparable problems being faced by their countries, are meeting 
at the Parlatino building. The main topics to be discussed 
during this meeting -- which will end tomorrow -- are democracy, 
disarmament, non-proliferation of atomic weapons and, naturally, 
economic growth. 
  Minister Celso Amorim has said that the Common Market of the 
South, Mercosur -- which is as yet only partially operational -- 
has already succeeded in quadrupling trade among South American 
countries. Amorim thinks this fact proves that through 
understanding and mutual assistance, sustained and continuous 
development can be achieved in any country. 
  [Begin Amorim recording] Mercosur is an integration model 
that seeks to follow the example of the EU. We have a great 
deal to learn from them. This is an important issue that will 
be discussed here. [end recording]

  [Text] Sao Paulo 22 Apr -- The foreign ministers and 
delegates of the Rio Group and the EU who met today here believe 
the new rules established by the GATT will solve eventual trade 
disagreements between their blocs. 
  Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana today told 
journalists 
that there are "less trade barriers" following the agreements 
reached during the Uruguay Round. 
  "Just as the political walls have fallen, the economic and 
trade walls are now falling," the Spanish foreign minister said 
before the opening ceremony of the fourth annual ministerial 
meeting of the EU and the Rio Group, the principal Latin 
American forum for concerted action. 
  The meeting, which is taking place at the Latin American 
Parliament (Parlatino) headquarters, will end tomorrow with the 
signature of a 10-page declaration in which the discussion will 
be evaluated and the bases for a future inter-regional relation 
will be established. 
  The Rio Group has expressed concern and rejection over the 
possible environmental, social, and political conditioning by 
the EU of Latin American exports. 
  The Europeans and Latin Americans who agree that the 
dialogue 
between the two should be upgraded have asserted that mechanisms 
to solve future trade conflicts may be found in the recent GATT 
resolutions. 
  Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio has told EFE 
that "an alarm must be set off" in face of the possible 
establishment of new trade obstacles. She nonetheless admitted 
that arbitration and problem-resolving instruments are envisaged 
by the GATT. 
  Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said: "The GATT 
rules eliminate these fears since they create a trade order to 
counter protectionist practices." 
  Regarding the attempted inclusion of a "social clause" on 
trade flow, Spanish Foreign Minister Solana expressed his wish 
that Europeans and Latin Americans reach "a joint position" 
within the organization that will soon replace the GATT, that 
is, the World Trade Organization. 
  Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim opened the meeting 
in 
Sao Paulo today. He said that despite some disagreements, the 
Rio Group is aware of the permanent goodwill of the EU to 
intensify the general system of international trade. 
  The current circumstances, Amorim said, offer new 
opportunities to renew relations, adding: "We observe the 
temptation to adopt an hegemonic attitude, which is natural 
following the disappearance of the bipolarity" that prevailed in 
the past. 
  Theodoros Pangalos, the alternate foreign minister of Greece 
and EU acting president, and European Commission Vice President 
Manuel Marin then spoke. 
  Marin said that although Latin America has attained economic 
growth, financial balance, and the consolidation of its 
democratic institutions "it still has a pending subject: the 
accumulated social debt as a consequence of the economic 
adjustment processes." 
  Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa defended a greater 
access of Latin American exports to the EU market and rejected 
any trade conditioning. 
  He added that the increase of European exports to Latin 
America -- which amounted to 23 billion ECU's in 1993 -- 
contrast with the sharp decline of imports -- 22 billion ECU's 
-- when the trade balance was negative by 10 billion ECU's in 
1990. 
  The foreign ministers and delegates who participated in the 
first of the two work sessions today agreed on the need for a 
"quality improvement step" in the dialogue between Europe and 
Latin America.

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 Apr (EFE) -- In a final declaration 
issued at the end of the fourth meeting of foreign ministers, 
the Rio Group and the EU today agreed to call for a total ban on 
nuclear tests in the world and condemned every form of terrorism. 
  Regarding their commitment to disarmament and to 
nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the 
participants of the fourth Rio Group-EU ministerial meeting 
expressed their complete agreement in condemning every form of 
nuclear testing. 
  The Sao Paulo Declaration, which was approved by 13 foreign 
ministers of the Rio Group and representatives of the EU member 
countries, states: "The ministers (of the Rio Group and the EU) 
agree on proposing the signing of a multilateral treaty that 
would impose a total ban on nuclear tests and would be fully 
verifiable." 
  In the Sao Paulo Declaration, the Rio Group and the EU also 
expressed their total condemnation of terrorism. 
  The declaration states: "The ministers...condemn without 
reservations -- as an unjustifiable crime -- every act of 
terrorism, irrespective of who perpetrates them, where, or why, 
because acts of terrorism endanger and claim the lives of human 
beings. They also undermine human dignity and are a threat to 
democracy and to a state of law." 
  The ministerial meeting between the Rio Group and the EU is 
the fourth since bilateral talks were institutionalized by the 
Rome Declaration (1990). The meeting, which is being held at 
the Latin American Parliament (Parlatino) building in the city 
of Sao Paulo, is scheduled to close on 23 April but the final 
declaration was released today. 
  In addition to condemning nuclear tests, the Rio Group-EU 
ministers praised the "recent progress made in consolidating the 
regime for a total ban on nuclear weapons in Latin America and 
the Caribbean as established in the Tlatelolco Treaty." 
  The declaration also expressed support for the Convention 
Banning the Development, Production, Storage, and Use of 
Chemical Weapons and Their Destruction, and revealed their 
resolve to adopt specific measures to fully implement the 
Convention on Biological Weapons. 
  The Rio Group and the EU also voiced their desire to 
cooperate to give openness to international arms trade. 
  The latter point was specifically requested by Andean 
countries like Colombia, which has been affected by arms 
trafficking financed by narcotrafficking and terrorist 
organizations. 
  The two blocs' representatives agreed to promote a UN 
Registry of Conventional Weapons with a view to effectively 
controlling arms possession around the world. 
  In the Sao Paulo Declaration, which consists of 19 points 
focusing on economic and political issues, the Rio Group and the 
EU reaffirm their respect for democracy and the principles of 
free trade. 
  The Rio Group and the EU also have agreed to define a new 
model of bilateral relations in which the Latin American 
countries would have greater participation in various 
international issues such as world security and the reform of 
the UN Charter. 
  The Latin American countries also expressed their concern 
about the social, environmental, and labor conditions some 
European nations are starting to impose on their trade with 
developing countries. 
  The continuation and expansion of the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP), which expires this year and regulates trade 
between the EU and Latin American countries, was another request 
made by the Rio Group that was included in the final declaration. 
  The Sao Paulo meeting was attended by all of the foreign 
ministers of the Rio Group -- which consists of Argentina, 
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, 
Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Attending the meeting as 
observers were the ministers of Trinidad and Tobago and 
Guatemala, representing the Caribbean and Central America, 
respectively. 
  The EU was represented by the foreign ministers of Spain and 
Portugal; Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, 
who is vice president of the EU; deputy ministers; and deputy 
ministers of the other members of the "Group of 12" (Denmark, 
Germany, Italy, United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, 
the Netherlands, and France).

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 Apr (EFE) -- Andean countries 
receiving trade benefits from the EU as compensation for their 
fight against the drug trade today proposed that the European 
Commission [EC] extend similar benefits to Venezuela, which also 
is committed to fighting drugs. 
  The proposal to include Venezuela among those countries 
receiving compensation for their fight on drugs was made by the 
foreign ministers of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and 
Venezuela at a meeting they held today with Manuel Marin, a 
Spaniard who serves as EC vice president and commissioner for 
Latin America. 
  In remarks to EFE, Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin 
said they had asked Marin "that the EU study the possibility of 
extending those benefits to Venezuela, a country that also needs 
trade compensation for allocating its resources to fighting the 
drug trade." 
  Several export products from Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia are 
entitled to tariff reductions in Europe under a special 
paragraph of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), a 
mechanism whereby the EU regulates its trade with Latin American 
countries. 
  Marin, who met with the foreign ministers of Andean 
countries 
to listen to their proposals concerning the renewal and 
expansion of the GSP, will convey these proposals to the other 
EC members. 
  The GSP expires late this year, and the EU must decide 
whether to renew the foreign trade mechanism as is, amend it, or 
expand it. 
  The Andean countries, Sanin said, expressed their interest 
in 
having the GSP renewed and expanded and that the trade benefits 
the EU is granting countries involved in drug enforcement 
efforts be extended to Venezuela. 
  The meeting between Marin and the Andean foreign ministers 
was held simultaneously with the fourth meeting of Rio Group and 
EU ministers that began today at the Latin American Parliament 
building in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo. 
  Marin is scheduled to meet on 23 April with the foreign 
ministers of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member 
countries (which consists of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and 
Uruguay) to hear their proposals regarding the GSP. 
  Attending the ministerial meeting are all the foreign 
ministers of the Rio Group members countries: Argentina, 
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, 
Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Also attending the meeting as 
observers are the ministers of Trinidad and Tobago and 
Guatemala, representing the Caribbean and Central America, 
respectively. 
  The EU is represented by the foreign ministers of Spain and 
Portugal; Greek Alternate Foreign Affairs Minister Theodoros 
Pangalos; and deputy ministers and vice ministers from the other 
EU member countries (Germany, Belgium, Denmark, France, the 
Netherlands, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom). 
  Since the signing of the Rome Declaration (1990) -- which 
institutionalized talks between the EU and the Rio Group, the 
main Latin American forum for concerted political and economic 
action and for promoting integration -- the two sides have held 
three meetings: the first in Luxembourg (April 1991), the second 
in Santiago, Chile (May 1992), and the third in Copenhagen 
(April 1993).

  [Excerpt] Sao Paulo, 22 Apr, (EFE) -- The member countries 
of the Rio Group and the EU today agreed to hold a high-ranking 
trade meeting to evaluate the impact of the GATT pacts on 
international trade. 
  The decision to hold the meeting is included as a special 
point in the final declaration of the fourth ministerial meeting 
between the Rio Group and the EU that was made public this 
evening, despite the meeting lasting until 23 April. 
  The ministerial meeting, the fourth since the talks between 
the Rio Group and the EU were institutionalized through the 
Declaration of Rome in 1990, is taking place in the Latin 
American Parliament (Parlatino) headquarters in this city, with 
the participation of all the Rio Group foreign ministers. 
  The trade meeting should take place before the end of the 
year with the participation of the vice ministers of foreign 
trade of the 13 member countries of the Rio Group -- the main 
Latin American political and economic forum -- and the 12 EU 
countries. 
  When expressing their interest in holding a new meeting 
among 
economic and trade experts from the two blocs, the participants 
at the fourth ministerial meeting said this kind of "specialized 
forum of continuous dialogue has been very useful in exchanging 
ideas about current affairs and matters of common interest." 
  The trade meeting's main objective will be to determine the 
new context of international trade after the signature on 15 
April in Marrakech of the GATT pacts and the creation of the 
World Trade Organization. 
  The effects of the European market's unification process on 
Latin American exports also will be analyzed at the trade 
meeting. 
  The Rio Group asked for more trade meetings between the two 
blocs because after two meetings of foreign trade vice ministers 
in Brussels they had not defined an agenda for more similar 
meetings. 
  The Latin American countries said the meetings were useful 
to 
"study the effects of the unified European market and the future 
expansion of the EU, as well as the regional integration 
programs and free trade zones of Latin America." [passage

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 Apr -- The foreign ministers and 
delegates from the Rio Group and the EU today condemned in a 
joint declaration any attempt to disrupt democracy in Latin 
America. 
  The representatives of the 12 EU countries and the 13 
representatives of the Rio Group, the main Latin American forum 
for concerted action, promised to contribute to the 
strengthening of democracy through the subordination of all 
sectors to legally constituted civilian authorities. 
  The so-called "Sao Paulo Declaration," which is eight pages 
long, establishes the bases for future dialogue in the political 
and economic fields. 
  The European bloc wanted the document to mention the 
subordination of the armed forces to civilian power. This 
proposal, however, was softened at the recommendation of the 
Latin Americans, who preferred not to mention the military at a 
moment when threats to the institutional order were felt in some 
countries. 
  The document condemns xenophobia, racism, terrorism, and the 
illegal production, trafficking, and consumption of drugs, as 
well as money laundering. 
  The delegates agreed to concentrate their "efforts in 
combating the wave of racism and xenophobia against, for 
example, immigrant workers and their families through, among 
other measures, the application of strict laws and the 
implementation of intense education campaigns." 
  As for drug enforcement, the participants agreed to apply 
global solutions to the drug problem, prevent the misuse of 
chemical precursors used in drug manufacturing, and promote 
alternative income sources for the benefit of the affected 
peasants. 
  The ministers and delegates from the two blocs repudiated 
"without reservations and labeled as an unjustifiable crime all 
kinds of terrorist actions wherever they are committed by anyone 
and for any reason, because they endanger and eliminate human 
lives, offend the dignity of the human being, and attack 
democracy and the state of law." 
  They thus agreed to reinforce cooperation and coordinate 
practical measures to combat terrorism. 
  The declaration pointed out the EU's and the Rio Group's 
interest in eradicating poverty, defending the environment, and 
rejecting "arbitrary unilateral actions" in international trade 
and noncompliance with the GATT principles. 
  The document states that mutual cooperation must be aimed at 
the eradication of poverty and the protection of the 
less-favored classes. It must efficiently promote democracy and 
cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, industry, science, 
and technology. 
  The chiefs of European and Latin American diplomacy stated 
that the "right to development is part of basic human rights, 
the human being is the central subject of development, and the 
lack of development cannot be used as an excuse to justify 
disrespect for internationally acknowledged human rights." 
  They also recognized the importance of the Ibero-American 
Conference, whose fourth summit of chiefs of state and 
government will take place on 14 and 15 June in Cartagena de 
Indias, Colombia. 
  They also promised intensifying dialogue within the UN 
framework for the purpose of reforming its charter and to 
improve the organization's work methods. 
  The two blocs made an appeal to countries to renew their 
commitment to the nonproliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction; they suggested signing a multilateral treaty to 
totally prohibit nuclear tests, and they mentioned the progress 
in the consolidation of the system of a total prohibition of 
nuclear weapons in Latin America.

<F P=106> [Article by Norys Nata] </F>
  [Text] On 19 April, Andean Parliament [Parlandino] 
President Paciano Padron said that the goal set for 
Colombian-Venezuelan trade integration has been estimated at $3 
billion, a $1.5-billion increase over the 1993 level. Padron 
made this statement following the inauguration of the 
Parlandino, which includes representatives from Bolivia, 
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, at the La Perla Building 
-- Parlandino headquarters. 
  Following the inauguration, Padron told journalists that the 
signing of the Cartagena Agreement will commemorate its 25th 
anniversary in May. The Cartagena Agreement was an extremely 
slow process during the first 20 years, but it began to take off 
in the past five years, particularly in the financial arena -- a 
circumstance no one can deny. 
  Padron stated that in 1992 commercial exchange between 
Colombia and Venezuela surpassed $1 million; in 1993, it 
exceeded $1.5 billion; and, in 1994, it is expected to exceed $3 
billion, which is considered significant progress compared with 
other countries. Currently, Colombia and Venezuela are 
considering moving from mere economic integration to social, 
cultural, and political integration. 
  Padron explained that the Andean Social Summit, which will 
be 
inaugurated at 1100 today on the Senate floor in the presence of 
President Rafael Caldera and which ends on 22 April, seeks 
mainly to obtain the approval of the Andean Social Charter. The 
Andean Social Charter contains alternatives for improving the 
living standards of citizens of the five member countries that 
unfortunately have not moved in a parallel manner toward 
economic development. 
  Padron believes that the charter contains elements 
fundamental to solving the problem, but, in addition to that, 
these elements deal with establishing responsibilities which, 
according to him, set the charter apart from other documents 
issued by international organizations. Padron added that the 
Andean Social Charter assigns responsibilities among the 
international organizations operating in the area and, of 
course, among the governments and parliaments from the five 
countries. 
  Padron believes that events of this type lead to popular 
support for the integration process, which has lacked it. This 
is why they view lending popular support to the integration 
process as an objective essential for bringing to life the union 
of the five countries as epitomized in the dream of our 
liberator Simon Bolivar. 
<H5>  Integrationist Vocation </H5>
  During his inauguration speech, Congress President Eduardo 
Gomez Tamayo indicated that recently our countries have made 
significant progress in the area of commercial and economic 
integration. 
  Gomez said: "We could even say that we have begun to 
overcome some political differences that limited the integration 
process in the past. This is the time to surpass difficult 
circumstances and persevere on the path of integration. We must 
advance in the identification of policies as Colombia and 
Venezuela, which have experienced more than promising results in 
the commercial sector, have done." 
  He also said that the current international situation 
demands 
the most determined integrationist vocation from Venezuela. As 
it is true that the situation has changed, it is also true that 
today's world requires an innovative vision in various aspects. 
Gomez noted that the trend toward forming economic blocs is a 
most pressing circumstance, adding: "Insofar as our peoples 
consolidate intraregional trade and strengthen their political 
and cultural relations, we will be able to hope to compete in 
the world context." 
<H5>  The Andean Social Charter </H5>
  The seven subjects the Andean Social Charter is 
contemplating 
include social integration and poverty eradication; children, 
women, and the family; health and nutrition; basic needs and 
housing; education and culture; productive employment and the 
informal economy; and jobs. The discussion of these subjects 
began during the Parlandino meeting in Caracas on 19 April, and 
their approval is expected at the closing session on 22 April. 
  Regarding education, participants are proposing to their 
governments the reinforcement of literacy programs. In the area 
of housing, they are urging the relevant authorities in the 
Andean nations to implement plans designed to face the housing 
shortage typical of the region's urban and rural areas. 
  The need to implement health programs ranks among the most 
critical, especially regarding the decentralization of services. 
In the area of nutrition, food assistance plans targeting the 
poor are deemed necessary. 
  Regarding jobs, they recommend that their governments 
implement policies that lead to the creation of new businesses, 
cooperatives, and other organizations linked to the informal 
economy in order to reduce unemployment, specifically in 
depressed groups in the rural sector. 
  As for children, women, and the family, they propose the 
implementation of political, economic, and social programs. They 
recommend assigning human, technical, and economic resources to 
centers of attention, protection, and development as well as 
promoting and strengthening the [words indistinct] all children, 
women, and the family in general. 
  Regarding social integration and poverty eradication, they 
propose the adoption of policies that facilitate the 
incorporation of all social sectors in the subregional 
integration growth-and-development processes.

  [Excerpt] The conference on the Nation and the Emigre 
Community began this morning at the Convention Center with an 
opening address by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina. There are 
200 emigre community representatives in attendance from 
approximately 40 countries. In addition to Robaina, the 
conference is also being chaired by Carlos Lage, secretary of 
the Council of Ministers; Ricardo Alarcon, president of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government; Abel Prieto, 
president of the National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists; 
and Sergio Corrieri, president of the Cuban Institute of 
Friendship with Peoples. Conference spokesman Miguel Alfonso and 
secretary Jose Cabanas are present. 
  For those familiar with three decades of pressures, threats, 
and aggressions, it is easy to understand the personal effort of 
many and the merit of your decision to not sell out to those who 
exerted pressures and threats to prevent this meeting: These 
were the exact words of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina during 
a welcoming address to the conference participants on behalf of 
the Cuban Government. 
  In his address, Robaina stated that the presence in Havana 
of 
Cubans who live abroad is an indication of support and 
identification with the Cuban nation as well as a recognition of 
our government's valor in convening this conference in the midst 
of the pressing and urgent tasks Cuba faces today. 
  [Robaina] "You have arrived in Cuba in the midst of an 
exceptional period, when our people are making extraordinary 
efforts to heroically preserve the fatherland's independence and 
sovereignty, and the gigantic accomplishments of the Revolution. 
If we commit to this conference, it is because the subject 
deserves to see the beginning of a joint discussion aimed at 
making progress along the road to normalize ties between the 
nation and its emigre community." 
  The conference is taking place under the same conditions of 
abnormality, of a U.S. policy of hostility toward Cuba, which 
since the triumph of the Revolution have shaped the ties with 
the emigre community. 
  [Robaina] "The fact that we are here today in this room is 
not even remotely the result of a miracle or accident. It is 
above all the result of our maturity, strength, and 
independence, and also the result of a growing attitude of 
respect and understanding of a significant portion of the emigre 
community who identifies more each day with the vital interests 
of Cuba." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Rafael Huguet, a former member of the Alpha 66 
terrorist organization who is taking part in The Nation and the 
Emigrants Conference in Havana, said that the argument that 
violence is necessary to resolve Cuban problems has been 
irreversibly defeated. 
  Luis Tornes, who took part in the foiled Bay of Pigs 
invasion 
in 1961, admitted that the use of arms against Cuba is useless 
and said that Washington must realize that Cuba is not a U.S. 
territory. 
  Attorney Magda Montiel said the conference marks the 
beginning of a stage that shows Washington that there are Cubans 
willing to hold a dialogue, but it cannot be only one way. 
  Patricia Gutierrez told the press that regardless of 
differences, it is clear that the welfare of the fatherland is 
the objective. Patricia is the daughter of Eloy Gutierrez 
Menoyo, who was imprisoned for 22 years in Cuba for his 
counterrevolutionary activities. Gutierrez Menoyo later went to 
the United States. 
  Manolo Hidalgo, the 24-year-old son of Cuban emigres who 
left 
the country in 1961, said that many Cuban-Americans his age 
would like to help solve the Cuban crisis, regardless of any 
intimidation intended to stop them.

  [Text] The Secretariat of National Defense [Sedena] has 
determined there the Mexican Army is not responsible for the 
alleged 127 cases of human rights violations reported by the 
nongovernmental organization All Rights For All [Todos los 
Derechos para Todos], which accused soldiers of committing 
abuses in Chiapas. The following is the full text of Sedena 
Bulletin No. 35: 
  In previous communiques concerning the conflict in Chiapas, 
this secretariat has reported to the public that it received 
notification of 127 complaints of alleged human rights 
violations in the aforementioned state by the nongovernmental 
organization All Rights For All, believed to have been carried 
out by soldiers. 
  The Office of Complaints and Citizens' Attention has 
investigated and was able to resolve all of them, without 
finding any responsibility on the part of military personnel. 
During the process, which lasted three months, the cases were 
progressively clarified, as follows: 80 in the month of 
February, 17 in the month of March, 30 in the month of April, 
totalling 127. 
  Upon providing the public with this information, Sedena 
reiterates its determination to get to the bottom of every 
accusation, maintaining its conduct in accordance with the law.

  [Text] San Salvador, 24 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- The Salvadoran 
polling stations opened at 0700 local (1300 GMT) today so 2.5 
million voters can decide which, either the rightist candidate, 
Armando Calderon Sol, or the leftist candidate, Ruben Zamora, 
will be the next president of the Republic. 
  More than 1,000 foreign observers, most of them from the 
United Nations, are attending the procedures. In addition, some 
6,000 police are watching over this run-off election, which will 
close at 1700 local (2300 GMT). 
  The Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was severely 
criticized 
for irregularities in the first round held on 20 March, in the 
past few hours assured the people that the electoral machine was 
operating smoothly. The leftists, however, have warned of the 
danger of "another fraud" in favor of Calderon Sol.

<F P=106> [Report by J. Wilman Torres and unidentified announcer; from </F>
the "Newspaper of the Airwaves" program] 
  [Excerpt] [Announcer] Several popular organizations have 
seized a stretch of the highway that links the country with El 
Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico. Here is a report by J. Wilman 
Torres from Santa Rosa de Copan: 
  [Wilman] The situation is critical here in western Honduras, 
specifically in the area of La Entrada in Copan Department. 
Several labor, popular, and peasant organizations, led by the 
COCOCH [Coordinating Council of Honduran Peasant Organizations], 
decided to seize the international highway linking San Pedro 
Sula, Santa Rosa de Copan, and Ocotepeque with the route to El 
Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States. The seizure 
is at La Entrada in Copan Department. From the information we 
obtained from those participating in the seizure, they have 
taken the action because they can no longer endure the country's 
critical situation, especially because of President Carlos 
Roberto Reina's measures against the people. 
  [Announcer] When did the seizure of the highway begin? 
  [Wilman] The highway was seized at daybreak. There is 
practically no vehicular traffic between San Pedro Sula and 
Santa Rosa de Copan. They are also protesting the increase in 
fuel prices. The last communique they issued said they are 
protesting the increase in fuel prices, especially cooking gas, 
a product that is used a lot in rural areas. The situation is 
critical. They have placards criticizing Reina's measures. We 
were told the groups might be drafting a note to President Reina 
telling him it would be better if he resigns. 
  [Announcer] These organizations are led by the COCOCH. What 
other organizations are represented in the seizure? 
  [Wilman] The Sitramedhys [Trade Union of Medical, Hospital, 
and Related Workers] and mostly popular organizations. They are 
at the area of La Entrada, Copan Department. They have placed 
rocks on the highway and prevented vehicles from passing. They 
have put up placards in which they demand that the president 
reduce the prices of family basket products. 
  [Announcer] Are the police authorities in the area? 
  [Wilman] No. I got in touch with the 12th Infantry Battalion 
and the headquarters of the Public Security Forces to find out 
their position, and they have told me that soldiers will be sent 
to the area but just so there will be no violence. They said 
the appropriate authorities will be the ones to get involved in 
the matter. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "United States Owes Explanations to Bolivia"] </F>
  [Text] The United States -- its embassy, and through it the 
DEA -- owe Bolivia an explanation for the events related to "the 
narco-accusation" being discussed by the FELCN [Special 
Antinarcotics Force] and Congress, even if this is simply for 
considerations of diplomatic practice or good manners, for lack 
of a more precise and appropriate definition. 
  It is already known with certainty that the DEA has been and 
continues to be a decisive factor in these actions. This much 
is known precisely because of the apologies presented by the 
U.S. Embassy to the Costa Rican Government, and through a DEA 
communique explaining the appearance and later disappearance, in 
Costa Rica, of Bolivian citizen Edgar Fernandez Lazcano. 
Nothing of the kind has occurred in La Paz, until today, 
despite the fact that our country was directly affected by those 
U.S. actions, which have hurt our national dignity. 
  The explanations offered here by the ministers of government 
and social communication regarding the Fernandez case are not 
convincing. We do not understand why our government does 
nothing effective to bring him back to the country, particularly 
as he is considered a key element in the Chamber of Deputies 
Justice Commission hearing, and given the fact that he himself 
has stated his willingness to testify before the commission 
following a previous detention by the FELCN. His extradition 
seems to be impossible due to a lack of charges against him. 
However, it should not be impossible for Bolivian authorities 
to ask the DEA -- which currently holds him detained, or 
protects him, and which is also suspected of helping him get out 
of the country, enter Costa Rica, and later leave it, presumably 
for Miami -- to bring him back to the country. 
  But independent of what the Bolivian Government does or does 
not, it is the U.S. Government which has the obligation, or at 
least the moral duty, to explain its participation in these 
affairs.

  [Text] Upon arriving in the United States from London, 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said President Cesar 
Gaviria's administration is subservient to the United States. De 
Greiff called several U.S. officials liars and accused President 
Gaviria of unnecessarily criticizing him for his fight against 
drug traffickers. De Greiff said the president wanted to calm 
the U.S. Government's temper by attacking him. The prosecutor 
general said of the Colombian Government: They want to make 
themselves appear to be subservient to the U.S. Government by 
attacking me. 
  As for the accusations that Colombia is a narcodemocracy, De 
Greiff said it is an exaggerated perception and once again 
called Senator Kerry and Assistant Attorney General Harris liars.

<F P=106> [Swearing-in ceremony of Gustavo Roosen, new presidential </F>
commissioner for the reform of the financial system, by 
President Rafael Caldera at the Miraflores Presidential Palace; 
date not given; broadcast in progress--recorded] 
  [Text] [Caldera]...Gustavo Roosen has been designated as 
the presidential commissioner for the reform of the financial 
system. Do you solemnly swear to faithfully uphold the 
Constitution and comply with the duties assigned to you? 
  [Roosen] Yes. 
  [Caldera] If so, may God and the fatherland reward you. If 
not, may you answer to them. 
  The national government is aware of the importance of the 
delicate task assigned to Dr. Gustavo Roosen with this 
appointment and has to thank him for his willingness to serve 
the country by first taking on the presidency of the Banco 
Latino Board of Trustees and by now accepting this appointment, 
which will increase his responsibilities and duties. 
  The financial system's problem has been perhaps one of the 
most dire and serious problems encountered by the government I 
have presided over since starting my term in office. I must 
admit that Dr. Gustavo Roosen has been fundamental in giving 
Venezuelans the necessary confidence in this system, which is 
indispensable for the economic existence of any country. On this 
issue too, the affirmation of a fact--of which we are totally 
convinced and have clearly stated--has stood out: Social 
solidarity is indispensable, and in this case it has worked. 
  Although we have had difficulties appointing the General 
Bank 
superintendent and the president of FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee 
and Banking Protection Fund] due to the restrictions of the law, 
which was promulgated during the past government to select those 
officials, and, although the partial reform of the emergency law 
proposed by the Executive Branch is still pending, I have to 
admit that had we not achieved a basic understanding between the 
Executive and Legislative Branches, between the financial and 
the public sectors, and between the consumers and those 
responsible for the management of the country's life, Venezuela 
would not have been able to handle such a complicated, delicate, 
and difficult situation as the one we have confronted. However, 
we have to emphasize that the revival of confidence is a fact. 
We have recovered that confidence despite the fact that 
sometimes statements and proposals were presented, perhaps a bit 
too hastily, which jeopardized the country's trust in its 
banking institutions. 
  We must still--it is undeniable--anticipate and solve many 
serious problems before we can really say we have definitely 
recovered solidity in this sector, which is so very important to 
the country's life. Thus, I have wanted to highlight the 
decision we have now made. Dr. Gustavo Roosen will work closely 
with the national government, especially with the finance 
minister who, according to the Banking and Financial 
Institutions Law, has direct responsibilities in this field. On 
our part, we will offer Roosen all the necessary support and 
cooperation in his tasks, which are to benefit the country. I 
wish to reiterate that the country's immense fiscal and 
financial sacrifices to save the financial system have been made 
to benefit the people, the account holders. They have been made 
so that all those who participate in the complicated activities 
of the economy can have confidence in the system and have a 
trustworthy, satisfactory mechanism or institution that will 
allow things to march as they should. 
  I want to thank Dr. Roosen for accepting this mission and to 
express my confidence that the Executive Branch's decision to 
appoint him special commissioner for the reform of the financial 
system will contribute decisively to strengthening the current 
favorable opinion regarding this problem.

  [Text] Havana, 25 Apr (EFE) -- Cuban exiles who last night 
attended the reception given by Fidel Castro for the 
participants in "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference, said 
that his health seemed perfectly normal, although some indicated 
that it is not in vain that years pass. 
  At the conclusion of the conference, Castro met with all the 
guests at the Palace of the Revolution. He did not participate 
in any of the three days of meetings between the Cuban 
Government and 225 representatives of the moderate exile 
community. The conference closed last night. 
  Officials of the Batista government, former combatants of 
the 
thwarted Bay of Pigs invasion (1961), fierce anti-Castro 
activists of other eras, and people with less active backgrounds 
filed by the Cuban leader, who greeted them one by one. 
  "The rumor that he was seriously ill is a lie because it 
would have been impossible for him to be on his feet for more 
than one hour greeting everyone," Lazaro Farinas told EFE. 
Farinas was a member of an armed group that in the early years 
of the 1960's struggled against the revolution. "It is true he 
is an elderly person, he carries his age, but I found him alert 
and receptive. I do not know whether he is ill, but I saw him 
calm and relaxed, very normal," Farinas added. 
  Juan Manuel Rodriguez, a former captain of the revolutionary 
army who left Cuba in 1960 and today is a prosperous businessman 
in Costa Rica, said that "if someone says he is dead, I have 
spoken with a dead man, and in addition, he asked me about 
financial moves that might help the country." 
  Castro embraced Luis Ortega, a journalist who left Cuba 41 
years ago, and then confessed to him that he had a little flu. 
  Juan Manuel Martinez, who was spokesman of the Batista 
government and fled the island on 1 January 1959, the day of 
victory for the Revolution, was surprised by "Fidel's great 
memory." Martinez said Castro recognized him immediately, that 
he had faithfully followed the development of the conference, 
and that they both agreed that "they must jointly travel a long 
stretch until the goal is reached." 
  Max Lesnik, one of the founders of the Cuban Change [Cambio 
Cubano] organization led by former revolutionary combatant and 
former political prisoner Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, said that "for 
his years, it did not seem to me he had negative symptoms." 
Lesnik also said that with this reception all the guests -- not 
a single one was absent -- Fidel "endorsed the results of the 
conference." 
  Those results were the formal promise that these contacts 
will continue -- although there is as of yet no date for the 
next meeting -- and the possibility that most of the Cubans 
residing abroad will be able to return whenever they want. 
  They were also encouraged to invest in the country under the 
same conditions as other foreign businessmen, in other words, in 
partnership with Cuban state capital, something that, for the 
time being, rules out small businesses for them or their 
relatives. This was apparently an objective of a good number of 
the participants at the meeting. 
  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina also said that a department 
will be created in the Foreign Ministry to deal with the 
emigrants' problems and he indicated that the Cuban Government 
has communicated to the U.S. Government its desire to open a 
consulate in Miami.

  [Text] Havana, 25 Apr (AFP) -- A group of Cubans, 
comprising three or four adults and a child, entered the 
Canadian Embassy in Havana by force this morning and requested 
asylum, it was learned from a diplomatic source. 
  Defying security guards, the Cubans forced their way into 
the 
embassy, located in the residential neighborhood of Miramar 
(west of Havana) at approximately 0900 (1300 GMT). One of the 
Cubans who tried to enter, however, was barred entry, according 
to the same source. 
  A U.S. television crew from Miami, which arrived in Havana 
to 
cover The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, which for three 
days brought together representatives of the Cuban Government 
and Cubans living overseas, was in front of the embassy and 
filmed the incident, the same source reported. 
  In recent months, several Cubans have attempted on various 
occasions to enter the embassy garden, which is protected by a 
large gate and guarded around the clock by several policemen. 
  The last time something like this happened was in late 
January, when eight Cubans sought asylum at the residence of the 
Belgian ambassador in Havana. In view of the Cuban authorities' 
refusal to allow them to exit the country, they did not leave 
the residence until one month later, on 24 February, after 
obtaining the government's promise that they would not be 
prosecuted.

  [Text] Havana, 25 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Four Cuban adults and a 
three-and-one-half-year-old who entered the Canadian Embassy in 
Cuba today to request asylum, have left the building on their 
own accord after occupying it for eight hours, according to 
embassy sources. 
  "We told them there was no possibility of their being 
granted 
political asylum under Canada's international policy," David 
Morrison, secretary of the diplomatic mission, stated today. He 
said the five entered the Canadian Embassy, which is located in 
the Miramar residential neighborhood of Havana, at 1000 (1400 
GMT) in a peaceful manner and left at 1810 (2210 GMT). 
  "After thinking it over," the occupants left the building on 
their own and without incident," the diplomat said. Morrison 
said those who requested asylum said they were doing so because 
"life is very difficult" in Cuba. 
  Morrison said he personally spoke to the occupants, one of 
whom was the father of the minor, who entered the Canadian 
Embassy by taking advantage of a change of personnel. NOTIMEX 
was able to confirm that the situation in and around the embassy 
building is normal tonight. 
  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina told newsmen this 
afternoon that "these issues are connected to the extremely 
difficult period the country is enduring and that in difficult 
times some people begin to make rash decisions." 
  Cuba opposes all attempts to leave illegally, even by those 
"who resort to requesting political asylum, which is the best 
way to get some other country to receive them," the Cuban 
foreign minister noted. Robaina said this phenomenon is 
encouraged "from abroad," and he noted that "situations of this 
type will continue to occur." 
  He added, "I believe the news in this country is no longer 
that 10 people defected or 50 people defected; the news 
continues to be the millions who are resisting." 
  Seven Cubans entered the Belgian Embassy last February 
demanding permission to leave Cuba, but they left the embassy on 
their accord a month later, after receiving confirmation that 
the Cuban Government refused to grant them permission to leave.

    [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 1600 GMT on 25 April carries its "Straight Talk" program with 
host Osvaldo Rodriguez and his guest, reporter Luis Sexto of 
BOHEMIA magazine. 
  The topic of the discussion is: What country do we live in 
today? Rodriguez and Sexto point out that Cuba is overcoming the 
economic crisis. Although there are pessimists who believe that 
all is lost, Sexto points out that Cuba is poised on the runway, 
ready for takeoff. 
  Rodriguez focuses on two words used by Sexto in his 
arguments: ignorance and pessimism. Rodriguez says that those 
who cannot see the progress are more ignorant than pessimistic. 
He believes that many people will have to see progress in their 
own homes before they can believe. 
  Sexto points out that Cuba has developed its infrastructure 
during the past 30 years. He says: "Nowadays there is a trend 
toward denying all that has been accomplished in Cuba during the 
past 30 years. In other words, we are in these circumstances and 
what we did in the past is no longer good. Of course, they do 
not realize that external factors are greatly influencing the 
internal reality of Cuba." 
  Sexto goes on to say that there are many signs of recovery: 
"Every time a factory goes into operation, Cuba advances a 
millimeter down the runway for its takeoff. A few months back, 
we put the cardboard factory in Santa Cruz del Norte into 
operation. That is good news. We believe the current sugar 
harvest will be a bit better than the past harvest. If we 
produce 1,000 tons more, than we will have grown another 
millimeter in our situation. We will have produced more than 
last year." 
  Rodriguez points out that there have been other 
achievements: 
"Now that you are talking about accomplishments, I should remind 
you that in the first quarter 305,000 tons of oil were extracted 
from Cuban soil. This represents a 12-percent growth in relation 
to the goal for that quarter. It also represents an increase in 
comparison to last year." 
  Regarding this, Sexto replies: "That is a record high 
figure. 
In other words, during the month of January, oil workers worked 
very hard. There are some who say that no one works in this 
country. Nevertheless, the oil workers have rejected that 
superficial and incomplete vision that is circulating." 
  With regard to the tobacco, pharmaceuticals, and oil 
industries, Sexto points out: "In the past, the tobacco crops 
suffered some deterioration. I believe there has been a recovery 
in this area. This year we have had a good harvest. 
  "I also understand that the income from biotechnological and 
biopharmaceutical products is increasing. We also know that our 
nickel is selling well. It is even being marketed, if I am not 
mistaken, in more than 20 countries and its price has increased. 
  "As you mentioned just seconds ago, oil extraction has 
increased. The possibility of finding better oil and in greater 
quantities may not be an off-the-wall possibility. It may be a 
very serious possibility. Some people have said that those are 
real possibilities. In other words, we have foreign companies 
which have invested a large sum of money in this country and I 
believe that no one invests money blindly and foolishly. I 
believe there must be a certainty, a certain guarantee that what 
is being invested will not be lost." 
  Regarding the economy and public opinion, Sexto says: "There 
is a poll that indicates that 65 percent of the those questioned 
believe that with the gradual application of measures that will 
be adopted in the next few months, our economy will benefit." 
  Rodriguez remarks: "That same survey points out that only 
1.4 
percent of those questioned believe that there is no need for 
measures." 
  Sexto concludes by saying: "That 65 percent believes that 
the 
economic measures that will be adopted in the next few months 
will gradually help improve the country indicates that there is 
a tendency toward optimism. Workers truly trust in the strategy 
that our country has followed to overcome this difficult 
situation." "Straight Talk" ends at 1615 GMT.

  [Text] This morning, Unit No. 4 of the Carlos Manuel de 
Cespedes power plant in Cienfuegos, with a generating capacity 
of 158 megawatts, had to be taken offline due to a rupture in 
one of the unit's boiler pipes. This situation will cause 
greater outage problems than those that took place over the past 
weekend. 
  Jorge Carballo of the Electric Union pointed out that this 
unit should be repaired within the next 72 hours. He added that 
workers are now waiting for the boiler to cool down to begin 
repairs. When this unit goes back into service, units No. 1 of 
Santa Cruz del Norte and No. 6 of Diez de Octubre will be taken 
offline for maintenance.

  [Text] Cienfuegos Province sugar mills have attained, 
during the current phase [of the harvest], 83.2 percent of the 
plan for self-sufficiency in electrical energy. This is some 2.6 
percent more than in the same period in 1993. Scheduled repairs 
to the sugar installations are designed to restore the areas 
that generate steam and to relocate four turbogenerators to 
provide an emergency reserve of 3.6 megawatts.

  [Text] Electric power self-sufficiency in the sugar-growing 
sector is of vital importance to the national economy. Sancti 
Spiritus Province is among the best in the nation in 
self-sufficiency. The goal of ceasing to be a burden to the 
national electric power system is being consolidated in Sancti 
Spiritus Province, when we consider that they already generate 
90 percent of the electricity they need. The huge Uruguay [sugar 
mill] in Jatibonico is outstanding in this accomplishment, which 
produces 108 percent of its electricity. The (?FNTA) and Ramon 
Ponciano mills are also self-sufficient. However, the 
potentialities could be even greater if capabilities were used 
to greater advantage -- these potential capabilities are a 
fundamental factor -- and if exploitation of the installed 
turbogenerators was to be improved. 
  The national average is 20 kilowatt-hours per ton of cane 
ground, while Sancti Spiritus' nine mills surpass 22. Other 
elements for self-sufficiency in energy are to be found in the 
search for alternative measures, such as at the Ramon Ponciano 
Agroindustrial Complex, where the cane chaff grinder is yielding 
very good results. This chaff makes decent levels of combustion 
possible. 
  This has been a report by Rafael Daniel from Sancti 
Spiritus.

<F P=106> [Interview with Marcos Portal, minister of basic industry, </F>
by reporters Hector Rodriguez, Osvaldo Rodriguez, Maribel 
Acosta, and Susana Lee on the "This Very Day" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Hector Rodriguez] Today on our program, we have 
Basic Industry Minister Marcos Portal, who kindly agreed to join 
us on the "This Very Day" program, to whom we say: Good evening. 
  [Portal] Good evening. 
  [Rodriguez] After the first question, which I will be 
asking, 
these other reporters will ask questions: Osvaldo Rodriguez, 
from JUVENTUD REBELDE and who covers the basic industry sector; 
Maribel Acosta, from NTV; and Susana Lee, from GRANMA newspaper. 
  As everyone knows, Minister Portal's presence responds to 
the 
problem of electrical power generation. I would like to ask 
Minister Portal about the current situation with the generation 
of electricity. 
  [Portal] I believe I should start by saying that we are 
going 
to explain the situation with Cuba's electric system objectively 
and clearly. We must point out that this is the greatest, or one 
of the greatest problems that Cuba currently has. In other 
words, it is this situation that we are going to explain. 
  There are solution to our problems, but there are no 
miracles. I wanted to make that clear. The solution not only 
involves the workers and engineers of the electric industry; it 
involves general population. I believe it would be prudent to 
give our explanation to the population based on this fact. We 
appreciate the opportunity to bring this to the people directly. 
  Having said this, we can begin our discussion. I am going to 
use some graphs. The first point we wanted to explain is the 
composition and origin of electric generation in Cuba. I believe 
this is important for two reasons. Our system has 3,132 
megawatts. Of the generation of those 3,132 megawatts, 66 
percent is by equipment from the former Soviet Union and 
Czechoslovakia; 34 percent of that generation is by equipment 
obtained from capitalist countries. 
  There are two things that I would like to point out, the 
first being that 86 percent of all the machinery and plants that 
we have were built after the triumph of the Revolution. 
Approximately 80 percent of today's installed capacity was built 
in the last 25 years or less. 
  [Rodriguez] That is 80 percent. 
  [Portal] Right. In other words, only about 14 percent was 
inherited from the capitalist period. This is very important. I 
believe this gives us a sense of security. The national electric 
system is relatively young, strong, and powerful in its 
generating capacity and in the network of the national electric 
system. We believe that this gives us a sense of sureness of 
overcoming the special period. This is an area where I know 
there have been doubts and concern. The facts give us this 
practical information. 
  The second point I want to make is that 66 percent of the 
electric generation is by equipment obtained from the Soviet 
Union and Czechoslovakia. These two countries have ceased to 
exist. I want to point out that in addition to the material 
guarantees that came from those countries, favorable financial 
conditions, obtaining spare parts and machinery, etc., there is 
a certain technological dependency. It is not a true dependency 
but a technological dependency. The turbines, generators, 
boilers, pumps, etc. were obtained from those countries. This 
was interrupted in the last three years and we have had to face 
this situation boldly, supported, as can be expected, by the 
technical force that we have. 
  From the very beginning of the Revolution our industry has 
been blessed in that sense. We have always had highly qualified 
technicians, engineers, and workers. There are things that 
we....[changes thought] This is the second time that our workers 
have had to take care of our old capitalist plants and solve 
millions of problems. This is the second time we face this 
situation, but under different conditions. This time we are 
facing them with a greater infrastructure. 
  That is the reason I wanted to point this out. We can 
overcome that technological dependency. We can do this in two 
ways: There can be relations with the countries that inherited 
the companies and factories that supplied this equipment, and we 
can obtain materials and resources from other countries to keep 
them in operation. 
  Undoubtedly, three years of interrupted supplies, spare 
parts, and resources is a reality. Speaking from an objective 
point of view, this is what has been happening. This is 66 
percent of the generation, not including the networks. These are 
the two elements that I wanted to point out in this information. 
  I also want to mention another subject we would like to 
discuss, right at the beginning. It has to do with the nation's 
heavy crude oil. This does not mean it is the only crude oil the 
country has, or will have in the future. This is what we have 
today, and its production can be increased. 
  The importance of national crude oil in generating 
electricity cannot be underestimated, especially over the past 
three years: 1992, 1993, and this year, 1994. The nation's crude 
oil had to be used in an immediate or urgent manner as a source 
of generating electricity for the country. The country must be 
aware of this. In 1989, as is well known, we imported 13 million 
tons of oil. This import was reduced almost abruptly. In 1990, 
we imported 10.4 million tons, almost three million tons less. 
In 1991, we imported 8.6 million tons; and in 1992, we imported 
only 6 million tons. This has been thoroughly explained by 
several comrades several times. We must understand the country's 
situation, with that fuel cut in half in two or three years. 
  This is the first reason for using national crude oil in the 
thermoelectric plants. That is, this was not a superficial or 
easy decision. It was a daring and well-considered decision. The 
national crude oil, which has a percentage of brimstone -- 
probably 6 percent or a little more -- because of its viscosity, 
requires a tremendous effort to extract, handle, and transport 
in ships or on Transport Ministry trains, etc., especially for 
its consumption in thermoelectric plants. This implies a 
tremendous effort and decision by the Revolution, a decision 
adopted by us the technicians, the engineers. We made the 
decision to use the national crude oil at a time when we were 
practically hopeless, unable to generate electricity the country 
needed. 
  The country was able to show this last year, namely in July 
and August. The country generated practically 70 percent of its 
overall electricity at that time with the national crude oil. 
That is, two or three thermoelectric plants could face the 
deficit situation and continue generating electricity. This 
year, 30 percent of the electricity is generated with national 
crude oil. We hope to maintain this. It is an important amount 
-- 835,000 tons. We can say that if we were to import the fuel 
oil, it would take approximately $60 million, considering fuel 
oil's current prices. This decision has provided utilities 
amounting to approximately $30 million, or a gross $35 million. 
Today this money does not exist. We do not have it, considering 
the country's financial situation, et cetera. So, we feel that 
this is the main cause. 
  To further explain this phenomenon, we must add that the 
thermoelectric plants are not being destroyed by the national 
crude oil; that is, the turbines -- generators of the 
thermoelectric plants -- fuel-pumping systems, cooling and 
automatic systems, which are important parts amounting to 70 
percent of thermoelectric plants, are not being destroyed by 
this crude oil. 
  The gas pipelines of a thermoelectric plant suffer when the 
petroleum is burned. When combustion takes place, the gas goes 
through the gas piping system and the corrosion level increases. 
We know this is so, but measures are being adopted to solve this 
problem. The shop being built to enamel the surface through 
which the gas passes will be finished this month. This will 
ensure that the metal will have the same lifespan as before, or 
perhaps longer. We will probably use additives to reduce 
corrosion. There is a way of fighting corrosion and of 
assimilating a product. If the country today has this product, 
and if today we use 30 percent, perhaps we could achieve 40, 50, 
or 60 percent within 15 or 20 years, generating our own 
electricity with national fuel. This is very important. We 
cannot make any real projections because we do not know the 
country's capacity, considering the difficulties it has to 
confront, such as the blockade and current harrassment. It is 
important to generate part of our electricity by using our own 
fuel, a national fuel. And this fuel is much better than coal. 
  The national crude oil has twice the burning capacity of a 
ton of coal. That is, a ton of crude oil is equivalent to two 
tons of coal. The same thing happened in the United States and 
in Europe when they experienced a situation similar to ours -- 
for different reasons -- during the early 1970's, when they were 
forced to adapt their thermoelectric plants to consume coal in a 
relatively short period of time -- a year and a half, two years, 
three years -- after the coal supplies had been severed some 20 
years earlier. We did not need to do this. We had a guaranteed 
supply of fuel, although we think this decision was necessary 
and inevitable. 
  Not all our thermoelectric plants are burning national 
crude oil. This should be clearly explained to the people. Of 
our overall capacity, of our 3,123 megawatts, only 40 percent of 
the plants are burning national crude oil. The Rente and the 
Mariel thermoelectric plants are essentially burning crude oil, 
and a total of 1,000 megawatts are produced between the two. 
There is another plant in Santa Cruz del Norte that has one unit 
operating, while a second is being repaired. A third unit is 
sitting right on top of a petroleum deposit. This unit 
represents a tremendous savings for the country. That is, part 
of that petroleum is consumed right there. It is a tremendous 
economic factor. 
  Now, if you add up the numbers, you will say: But how is it 
possible that if national petroleum can be a savings factor for 
the country, no money, resources, or currency have yet been 
obtained to invest in this area? Besides, we are not talking 
about tens of millions of dollars -- which during another time 
might have been a small amount -- but a small amount to offset 
this situation and to keep up the maintenance work. Well, these 
resources simply do not exist. This problem was discussed last 
year at the National Assembly [of the People's Government] 
[ANPP]. It was very well outlined by one deputy who is a 
director of one of our thermoelectric plants, and who discussed 
the financial situation very thoroughly. He correctly reported 
that some $18 million was necessary to try to face the 
maintenance work. I had the responsibility of explaining to this 
comrade that this year, we do not have a cent for that purpose. 
We have difficulties with medicines and with food, and that we 
must try to resist for at least another year before talking 
about thermoelectric plants. Then, by the end of the year, we 
managed to collect some $2 million from the income the country 
is beginning to receive. You know the country is receiving some 
income in dollars from certain activities. Well, this was 
possible and allowed us to repair the thermoelectric plant unit 
in Matanzas, and one unit in Cienfuegos. We are beginning to 
reverse the situation, to increase the available installed 
capacity. We managed to reach 36 percent when the Matanzas plant 
stopped operating by the end of the year, and things have been 
recovering gradually. I will try to explain the solutions we 
found this year; that is, I will explain the measures we are 
adopting and the possible solutions. 
  Well, Hector, I only wanted to make things clear concerning 
the national crude oil. This phenomenon is imposed on national 
life, but we are satisfied, we are happy. That is, we cannot 
just take the negative side of the issue. Of course there are 
people who want to see things negatively. Well, they might do 
so, especially the people abroad who want to see our country 
completely destroyed. But we are not going to allow this. 
  We are producing electricity with a fuel we did not dream of 
some 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago. For five years, we have 
been using it to generate electricity, to generate 30 percent of 
the electricity we are consuming. So how can we Cubans be misled 
by this? This problem is going to be solved. We are going to 
assimilate it as it was assimilated in other countries by using 
coal, which is even more difficult. Imagine using coal as fuel 
for our thermoelectric plants. Imagine the dirt, the handling of 
it, the ashes, the tragedy that coal would cause. Crude oil can 
be assimilated much more easily. We have assimilated it with 
very little investment, namely for the purchase of pumps, etc., 
given the viscosity of the crude oil. When the time comes, these 
plants will require maintenance. Well, this is a subject that 
had to be discussed.... 
  [Rodriguez, interrupting] Yes, this is a subject that is 
discussed continuously. 
  [Portal] I think this talk was necessary, given the 
prevailing confusion and the people's concern over this problem. 
Some people say that we are destroying the thermoelectric 
plants, etc. As I have just explained, some of these plants are 
almost 20 years old, and we are taking good care of them. That 
is, we cannot allow something that is good for the country to be 
damaged. This is the manner in which we are working. But this 
does not include all thermoelectric plants. Part of these plants 
have nothing to do with this. 
  Now I would like to discuss the practical side of the 
national power system [SEN]. I want to refer specifically to 
1989. I think it is important to go back to that year, when we 
managed to obtain 77.7 percent of the available capacity of the 
entire electricity generation system, as well as 23.3 percent, 
which was kept for maintenance, breakdowns, and limitations. We 
must explain that electricity is generated all 365 days of the 
year, and around the clock. It is obvious that part of that 
capacity will be under repair or maintenance, and this requires 
discipline. The SEN has been conceived this way. There is an 
established discipline concerning the thermoelectric plants for 
shutdowns and maintenance. A shutdown can be short or long, 
depending on the needs. There are some units manufactured in the 
1960's, namely those manufactured by the Soviet Union and 
Czechoslovakia. These plants will require 90 or 120 days to be 
repaired. The ones we have in Cienfuegos, which were made by the 
Japanese Hitachi Company require 60 or 70 days, depending on the 
work that must be done. The unit in Matanzas, for instance, 
required only 27 days. Well, some time was saved there. In 
short, part of the plants will need time for maintenance. 
  This is what we mean by 77.7 percent of available capacity, 
and 23.3 of maintenance. This percentage was comparable to the 
most developed countries in the world in 1989. For instance, the 
Yankees have 80 percent, while we have 77.7 percent of the 
available capacity. And this has been consolidated. We have 
achieved this thanks to our workers and technicians. They have 
consolidated this percentage. 
  The breakdown percentage at this moment has reached 50 
percent. That is, breakdowns, maintenance, failures, and 
limitations amount to a total of 50 percent. The idea of 
limitation of a thermoelectric plant has to do with the ashes, 
the dregs, the dirtiness, et cetera, which reduce the potential 
capacity. That is, from 100 megawatts it drops to 95 megawatts. 
We keep it that way, because to clean a plant, it must be 
paralyzed. Moreover, a small breakdown or a leak still allows 
operation for some days, but its generating capacity necessarily 
drops. This is called limitation. 
  We must also refer to the breakdowns in the system, such as 
the breakdown of a boiler pipeline, a steam pipe, et cetera. 
This will demand a shutdown because to repair this damage, the 
plant must be cooled down. Now, why has this generation capacity 
been aggravated? This is the key issue. There are four essential 
causes: 
  The first cause is the suspension of the supply of spare 
parts by those two countries I mentioned before. This supply 
stopped three years ago. This is an important cause. And it is 
the truth. We have managed to survive with our reserves. We did 
have some extra spare parts in our stores, in the steel 
industry, and in other investments. That is, this is a problem, 
and without any drop in generation, we kept these plants 
operating until the middle of last year. That is, we managed to 
resist in 1990, 1991, 1992, and half of last year. And besides, 
in addition to these problems we were also short of fuel. But 
this year we have this fuel, and so the difficulties are being 
overcome. 
  Despite the blackouts, our people have achieved a discipline 
that is unique. It is unique because the people have fulfilled 
the family home plan. At least 90 percent of Cuban families 
managed to save electricity. A large percentage has fulfilled 
the plan, while a small percentage, perhaps 8 or 9 percent, 
failed to fulfill this plan, not saving energy. More than 90 
percent did fulfill it. This is unprecedented. Not even the 
Yankees achieved this when they ran out of fuel. During the 
Carter administration, when they ran out of fuel, a set of 
measures were adopted, such as teaching the women to boil water, 
et cetera. That is, they adopted very serious and drastic 
measures at that time. But with the electricity problem here, we 
have surpassed them with the set of measures we adopted. We are 
sorry that such measures had to be adopted, but to return to our 
point, this phenomenen was the first cause. And we have overcome 
this. And people ask: well, why has this solution been found 
only now? No, this is not a recent solution. The use of the 
national oil was not adopted overnight, and the manner in which 
the country had to face the shortage of spare parts and 
materials did not emerge overnight either. Nothing has been 
improvised. Everything has been done calmly, with intelligence 
and serenity. We had to postpone the maintenance of some plants 
in order to meet some demands. This is the second cause. 
  That is, the maintenance timetable was the second cause. A 
thermoelectric plant, such as that of Matanzas, needed to be 
repaired. And this plant had to keep operating for a year or six 
months without maintenance, while the spare parts were prepared. 
The parts were taken to the shops to be repaired. This demands 
discipline, and this discipline is broken when there are no 
spare parts or the necessary material. 
  The third cause, which to my opinion is the most important, 
has to do with the country's difficult financial situation. We 
are aware of the sugar industry situation, that is, the sugar 
deficit. We are aware of the nickel industry which is also 
experiencing a drop in prices, and a drop in the production 
capacity of our nickel industry. It has abruptly lost its 
market. The socialist countries used to buy 70 percent of our 
nickel, but in 1992 these countries did not purchase any nickel 
at all. They purchased no nickel whatsoever in 1992. 
  [Rodriguez] And was there a need to look for new markets? 
  [Portal] Yes. Today we are selling nickel to 96 countries. 
We 
must not take this as a setback because depending on a single 
country for the sale of our products was beneficial, correct, et 
cetera. But today our comrades from foreign trade have managed 
to reach other markets. Today, our nickel has a market, while 
prices are increasing. 
  Now we need to recover our plants. We are looking for 
financial support to recover these plants. When you lose a 
market and lose your client, you stop having an income. And when 
you stop having an income, if no one grants you a loan -- and 
today no one is granting loans to the country -- the 
international bank does not grant loans, the World Bank does not 
grant loans, no one is granting loans to the country -- this is 
one of the few countries in the world to which no one is 
granting loans. 
  But this does not mean that we are begging for money. We 
have 
a sugar harvest and we have nickel. But I am not going to refer 
to the nickel issue because we have already solved that. What we 
were unable to solve in the two previous years is being solved 
by those who invest in and trust the country, the Revolution, 
and our people. We are already receiving capital for the nickel 
to solve this problem. Guaranteed by what? By the nickel our 
workers are going to produce. That is not the objective of the 
[word indistinct]. 
  The third cause: the lack of hard currency and financing. 
This is solved only by producing, and by intelligently seeking 
sources for financing and markets for our product. That is the 
third cause that I wished to explain. 
  There is a fourth cause, which is the domestic crude. It is 
true that in the boilers, the increase in maintenance by 40 
percent is caused by the use of the heavy crude oil. We should 
not stop... [changes thought] As I explained at the beginning, 
my explanation would be objective and clear, not advisory. These 
are the four causes that have prevented us from keeping this 
23-percent maintenance level. 
  We have not dreamed -- nor does the country need to -- of 
achieving this 23 percent. But today, we cannot provide any 
currency to achieve another 23 percent in two years. This is not 
possible. But having only 50 percent of available capacity has 
created this situation of not being able to meet current 
demands, or an important part of the demand. We must begin 
recovering that capacity that has been lost. We are going to 
explain this further later. 
  In sum, industry has something we call the ABC factor. It 
has 
an "A," a "B," and a "C". The "A" represents the labor force, 
the man, his discipline and productivity. The "B" implies 
ensuring material provisions, its financing; and "C" represents 
the maintenance and repair work. 
  If "B" fails -- that is, the material provision insurance 
and 
the financing, et cetera, -- the repair and maintenance work 
also fails. The men, represented by "A," have faced this. I have 
to say that when a man is working in a thermoelectric plant and 
he sees a problem, a leak, some difficulty, or a need for repair 
-- which he used to do with discipline but now is unable to do 
for lack of resources -- then discipline, productivity, and the 
labor force are affected. The energy industry has failed -- that 
is, the part of it that cannot be disregarded in any industry -- 
has failed. And I am going to further explain the solutions the 
country has found to reverse this situation. 
  But as I was saying, we cannot work miracles. No solution 
will be found in 15 days, one month, two months, or three 
months. No, it cannot be, and I have to explain this clearly to 
prevent any confusion or doubts. This is very important. The 
people will rest assured when they are aware of the decisions 
made. 
  [Rodriguez] Is this a gradual recovery? 
  [Portal] Yes. It is a gradual recovery, a gradual and 
important recovery, and this will be explained in the solutions 
found. 
  Now, to conclude this first topic, because I must speak 
briefly about the issue of consumption in the introduction, I 
wanted to discuss the capacity available for this year -- in 
other words, from the 50 or 45 percent that we have available 
for April. The average for the first quarter was 50 percent. In 
April, we had to take a Japanese unit out of service, which was 
one of the most efficient units in Cienfuegos' system. I believe 
it would be good to explain this: 
  It was one of the better units in our system. A few hours 
before the youth day celebrations began, we were analyzing the 
problems. There had been vibrations in the turbines and problems 
with the boiler. The repairs would require us to shut down the 
unit for seven days. Our comrades recommended that we shut down 
the plant, so we shut it down. Everytime this happens, we are 
going to act accordingly. The population must understand that 
despite the pressure, tension, and numerous difficulties that we 
may have, we will always have to act in that manner because of 
professionalism and discipline. We will not give the order to 
keep a unit in operation so that we later end up with greater 
problems. 
  That unit I was talking about has already been restarted. As 
a matter of fact, in April or May, that plant should have 
already reached its maximum designed capacity. That unit is 
already about 15 years old and we are sure it will run well 
during April and May, until we complete the harvest and other 
activities. If there are problems and we do not shut it down, we 
could have a difficult situation. 
  That is why in April, our capacity dropped to 44 percent. By 
December, we should be at 60 percent. What are we doing and what 
do we have to do to reach 60 percent? We will have to provide 
maintenance and repairs to 1,800 megawatts of those that are 
currently installed. This is a high percentage; almost 60 
percent of all the generating plants, but it can be done. 
  I brought information with me about how the installed 
capacity in each one of the main thermoelectric plants will 
behave. I believe it is useful...it is correct. This lists the 
contribution that each thermoelectric plant must make. It is on 
the graph and can be explained, right? 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, because we are also broadcasting through 
Radio Rebelde. 
  [Portal] Oh, okay. The Mariel generating plant, which is 
currently operating at 39 percent of its capacity, will end the 
year with 58 percent of its capacity. The plant in Santa Cruz, 
which is operating at 40 percent of its capacity, will end the 
year with 80 percent of its capacity, with the two units of 100 
[not further specified] that it currently has in operation. In 
the solutions, we are going to provide more interesting 
information on that generating plant. 
  Havana City -- the link that is generated in Havana City, 
which is composed of Talla Piedra, Regla, and Frank Pais -- is 
where the oldest units are concentrated. They are the units of 
highest specific consumption -- 400 grams per kilowatt. The 
original idea was to keep those units as reserves in the 
national electric system. Today, we propose to restore their 
installed capacity. Forces from the Ministry of Construction, 
government and party leadership in Havana, as well as our 
comrades, believe it possible to restore those plants and bring 
the capital to 53 percent of its available capacity, which is 
almost 136 megawatts, by the end of the year. 
  We are being conservative in giving these figures. They have 
planned to do even more. They have even set the goal of 
recovering another plant called the Frank Pais, which is also in 
the capital and which has two generating units. Here we have two 
blocks, imported from Czechoslovakia. The rest are from the 
capitalist era. 
  The Matanzas generating plant is currently at 100 percent of 
its capacity and will close the year with 100 percent. Here I 
want to pause and say that in September we will close that plant 
to do an overhaul. 
  [Rodriguez] For how many days? 
  [Portal] They figure it will be approximately 27 or 30 days. 
We may be able to do it in less. By that time, in September or 
October, we should have repaired other units, to minimize the 
effect. In Cienfuegos, we currently have 92 percent and should 
end the year with 52 percent. Why? Because, in December, when 
the Matanzas plant is back in operation -- we must take into 
account the sugar harvest and the consumption -- the large unit 
of Cienfuegos will be taken offline until the first few days of 
January. 
  What about Nuevitas? Nuevitas does not burn domestic crude 
oil. They are Czechoslovakian units -- three of 125 megawatts, 
and three of 64 megawatts. As you can see, it is at 32 percent 
of its capacity. It is one of the places most affected. Those 
plants have different problems of a technical and material 
nature. Our goal is to bring Nuevitas to 50 percent by December. 
There is a chance we will be able to do better, but there are 
some factors we must consider. We prefer to be conservative. 
  The Rente power plant in Santiago de Cuba is currently at 33 
percent of its capacity, and they should end December with 60 
percent. The people in Santiago de Cuba are sure they will be 
able to accomplish this, reaching 300 megawatts. As you can see, 
we currently have 1,378 megawatts; and we should reach 1995 with 
1,890 megawatts. That is more than 500 megawatts more by the end 
of the year. With that capacity, we can eliminate the power 
outages during the day, for example, which affect the economy 
and the population. We should have a schedule of power outages 
that is more reasonable for the population. 
  For this purpose, I am going to explain the measures being 
adopted, and the guarantees. That is, this is not an explanation 
without a basis. This explanation has a basis that I will 
explain when I get to explaining the solutions. 
  What I have to explain concerning consumption is brief, but 
perhaps it is the most difficult and most complex aspect. We 
will need the people's participation for this. It is as folows: 
  This year, electricity consumption is increasing. It is a 
modest increase, of close to 6 percent, but an increase that 
began last year when generation began to drop. That is, this 
6-percent increase is not something... [changes thought] There 
is part of the economy being reactivated. 
  Now, Cuban families have consumed 14 percent more 
electricity 
during this quarter as compared to the previous year. 
  [Rodriguez] Is this a 14-percent increase? 
  [Portal] Yes, an increase of 14 percent, despite the 
blackouts and interruptions in the energy supply. This is 
essentially due to the use of electric stoves. This can be 
clearly seen at 1200 [local time], for instance, when generation 
increases by 300 megawatts more than last year. And at 2000 
[local time], generation increases by 350 megawatts. There is a 
percentage of families who are very much linked to the use of 
liquefied gas, processed gas, and kerosene [luz brillante] 
nationwide, but today they are cooking on electric stoves of 
many types, even homemade stoves. This has created a situation 
that aggravates the matter. 
  I was explaining that this is the most complex issue because 
we cannot say that the liquefied gas or the kerosene shortage 
will be solved immediately because we cannot say that we have 
the currency necessary to solve this problem. We cannot yet say 
that we have the necessary resources. The same thing can be said 
about the other fuels. An aggravation of the fuel shortage would 
also aggravate our situation. I must objectively say, and 
clearly explain to the people that this increase in consumption 
cannot be met, not even by improving the thermoelectric plants 
or the electrical network. And today we cannot ask the people to 
give up that way of cooking because there is no other, better 
way. But to the extent that we can manage to restore the supply 
of liquefied gas and of kerosene, this situation must be 
reversed. 
  [Rodriguez] Then we must stop using the electric stoves. 
  [Portal] Yes, we must stop using electric stoves. This is 
nothing new. That is, the country has not really foreseen this 
during this period or during this century. In the first place, 
the country does not have the necessary thermoelectric plants 
for that. That is, out of two million inhabitants, one million 
are using electricity for cooking, and there is no 
thermoelectric plant that can guarantee this. We must return to 
the past. 
  The same thing happens with the electricity network. In a 
block or a zone where you live, some 10, 15, or 20 percent of 
the families might be using electricity for cooking. Well, that 
transformer at that pole will not resist, that cable will not 
resist long enough, nor will the internal electrical 
installations in homes take this increase in consumption. This 
is a very complex problem, and I wanted to explain this 
situation, stemming from the increase in electricity 
consumption. We must try to recover the supply of liquefied gas, 
the gas that is sold on the street [passage indistinct]. 
  In the future, when we can make investments in the sugar 
mills and the situation with the special period is a bit more 
favorable, we will have to think about gas, which also requires 
a specific infrastructure. 
  But regarding electricity, it will be impossible for the 
Cuban population to use electricity to cook over the next 10 to 
15 years without nuclear reactors or anything else. We are going 
to have no alternative but to ask for the population's 
cooperation and discipline. In other words, as we.... [changes 
thought] Furthermore, there are all types of stoves. You can 
figure it out for yourselves. There are stoves with coils that 
consume 1 kilowatt of electricity. Cuba has 2.7 million 
families. Just 100,000 families using these stoves could consume 
100 megawatts. 
  And 200,000 families will consume 200 megawatts; 300,000 
families will consume 300 megawatts. That is what the Matanzas 
thermoelectric plant generates. Then 500,000 families will 
consume 500 megawatts, but there is no way to cope with this. 
Today there is no way to cope with this. You have seen that the 
peak demand... [changes thought] And not seeking to justify the 
explanation or to change the thought, I do not want to refer to 
other increases in energy consumption. But in the television 
schedule, for instance, we know that there are illegal 
installations being made, so if the use of television is 
increased, this will also increase consumption. 
  There are other things increasing the consumption of 
electricity. The most significant of all is the electric stove. 
This should not be. It can affect other activities that are 
vital to the economy. The population itself suffers because 
someone who has this type of stove causes an outage for three or 
four other families. In other words, in just three or four 
hours, the situation becomes complicated and one part of the 
population affects another. That is, the outages get off 
schedule. This is a phenomenon that I wanted to explain. 
  [Rodriguez] Mr. Minister, I believe the Cuban population 
prefers cooking with gas rather than with electricity. I believe 
they will cooperate, especially since they prefer to cook with 
other types of.... 
  [Portal, interrupting] Yes, but 70 percent of the population 
cooks with kerosene [luzbrillante]. At this point, the 
population cannot stop cooking with kerosene. When the 
Revolution triumphed, half the population was cooking with wood 
and coal -- 52 percent of the population. 
  [Hector Rodriguez] Fifty-two percent? 
  [Portal] Yes, they used wood and coal. The use of kerosene 
and gas increased, and the living standard improved. 
Nevertheless, this is not the best fuel to use. As you have 
already mentioned, gas is much better. 
  To begin discussing solutions, I wanted to explain that the 
electricity we have.... [changes thought] It has been repeatedly 
explained that electricity is not stored, but instead, is 
generated at the moment. The population can see that as the 
power plants generate electricity, the energy is immediately 
consumed. 
  In the past, we always had back-up power plants generating 
at 
lower capacity. As soon as there were problems, their capacity 
was increased. All it took was anywhere between 1 and 10 
minutes. It was very fast. We do not have this today. When a 
generating unit is taken offline, there is an immediate outage 
or interruption that cannot be announced in advance because it 
is practically instantaneous. The country and the population 
suffer very much because of this, and the situation will not be 
solved immediately because of the problem we have with 
generating capacity. 
  The other thing that is very clear is that our system is set 
up like other systems in other parts of the world: It does not 
take away electricity, but supplies electricity. In other words, 
the electrical networks are to supply. We have made several 
changes and small investments to isolate certain services from 
the normal circuits. These are hospitals; economic activities 
important for the country; the tourism industry, to a certain 
extent; and the sugar mills. 
  But here in Havana City, approximately 30 percent of the 
families practically never have power outages, such as in Habana 
Vieja, where it would be technologically impossible. There are 
other parts of Centro Habana and parts of Vedado, where it would 
also be impossible. There are also circuits associated with a 
pediatric hospital, the Hermanos Almeijeiras, and the Calixto 
Garcia, where it is very difficult to isolate the families. What 
happens is that families not on those circuits suffer longer 
outages. 
  In July and August of 1993, we agreed that during times of 
difficulty, especially here in the capital, and in the rest of 
the provinces they also do this.... [changes thought] I believe 
I should explain that there are several provinces that, despite 
last year's improvement, have had anywhere from 12 to 16 hours 
of outages a day for many days, weeks, months. In other words, 
what happened in the capital for 15 days [as heard] is similar 
to the rest of the country. The rest of the country has been 
facing a very serious situation. 
  Because of the concentration level that exists in the 
capital, where approximately 2 million people live, and because 
of the problems we have been having, we always try to prioritize 
the capital. But at this moment, at the height of the sugar 
harvest, when not producing sugar, or the plan being affected by 
power outages would be a hard blow to our country, we must 
guarantee the energy needed for all exportable activities: the 
sugar harvest, the nickel industry, the tobacco harvest, for 
which electricity is used to dry the leaves. There have even 
been outages in this area. We have had to make an extra effort 
to prevent outages for that industry. We must preserve those 
activities. I believe the population must agree with this 
because we are defending the population and the country when we 
act in this manner. 
  It is true that not everyone has a relative in the 
hospital, but we cannot become uneasy, nervous, or tense and 
take the energy away from a pediatric hospital, or another 
important hospital where there are sick people, or people having 
surgery. 
  I mention this because there have been incidents in various 
places. Some malicious people believe that the electric service 
will be restored through that type of pressure. I can assure you 
of two things: First, we act with professionalism in this and 
are convinced it is the way we must behave. When the power is 
interrupted in a place.... [changes thought] Secondly, we act 
with conviction. We are defending this like the majority of the 
population. That is one thing that cannot be changed. In other 
words, the fact that one acts with conviction in not affecting 
hospitals, water management systems, or cold storage centers 
which cannot be changed. 
  So, they can do what they want, but we.... [changes thought] 
Our people must trust that we will continue to act that way. 
  [Rodriguez] That is fair. 
  [Portal] Do not worry about that. There are comrades who 
have 
been mistaken, but with much dignity and authority, we are going 
to continue acting that way. 
  There are no privileges or anything like that in relation to 
the outages. Banish the idea. If there are things that are 
considered unjust, they must be reported and we will act on 
them. In other words, we do not accept that type of behavior 
from our comrades. I wanted to make that very clear. 
  Well, let us talk about material guarantees and their 
financing. This year, we already have financing for some $3 
million in resources, which are arriving. We are talking about 
steel, special tubing, electrodes [electrodos], and gaskets. 
Part of this is already arriving. Apart from this, there is 
another $7 million which will be progressively allocated 
throughout the year. Between the two, there is $10 million 
destined for the generation of electricity. 
  It is not something reaching 70 or 80 percent, but 
sufficient 
to meet what the country has set as an objective. I already 
explained that $2 million was provided last year, and that this 
year, there is $10 million. This is five times more than last 
year. But we must administer this money. This money is not 
administered by any bureaucratic apparatus, but by the same 
comrades who are conducting the maintenance work and who make 
the decisions on what must be purchased now and what must be 
purchased later. In this manner, the country has thus progressed 
a great deal. That is, we have improved this part of the 
administration. These people who must decide on what to buy are 
people with experience, knowledge, and training. 
  Second measure: the preparation and implementation of the 
maintenance and repair works I already explained. I want to add 
that this will affect practically 60 percent of the installed 
capacity today: that is, 1,800 megawatts. 
  This is very important because it will give more reliability 
to the system. That is, if we are today putting into operation a 
thermoelectric plant that experienced a breakdown in the 
pipeline or some kind of leak, well, when this plant is repaired 
and maintained, this plant gains more reliability, and thus 
there will be fewer blackouts [words indistinct] and for this 
reason I mention this as a second measure. This graph is 
intended to increase the reliability, not only a percentage of 
[passage indistinct] and the maintenance workers. 
  This means that our government officials have adopted an 
exceptional measure concerning the thermoelectric plants and the 
maintenance shops. The workers will also receive special 
incentives, especially those who are directly involved, 
beginning with the top engineer of a thermoelectric plant, that 
man who plays the role of a director. I am referring to the top 
engineer and all those under him. I am referring to that man who 
is there on Saturday and on Sunday; that man who has a family, 
and has the same needs in his home as any other Cuban citizen; 
that man in charge of that shift, the plant operators who work 
Saturdays and Sundays. 
  In our current situation, these comrades are continuously 
submitted to a tremendous workload and pressure. Imagine working 
Saturdays, Sunday nights, early morning. They also have to pick 
up other workers so the plant may be working at top level to 
improve the situation. This is the prevailing situation. 
  We have been talking to other workers, to other colleagues 
from other ministries, and everyone agrees with the measures 
adopted in the electricity area, because we know that the 
harvest is being carried out under very difficult conditions by 
workers in the sugar industry, which is our main industry. We 
are aware of the workers' situation in this area. I am certain 
that those workers are in agreement with measures adopted in the 
thermoelectric plants because they know that workers here are 
also working like them, 365 days a year. 
  I wish to add that those workers would agree with the 
incentives to be given to the workers of the thermoelectric 
plants because they are aware of the difficult conditions under 
which they are working. These incentives, which will be in food, 
et cetera, will be rigorously implemented. 
  We already have the first experience. It has to do with 
discipline. To achieve the incentive that will be established, 
the worker must have zero absence. 
  [Rodriguez] Zero absence? 
  [Portal] Yes, zero absence, and that includes tardiness. No 
tardiness will be allowed. This also goes for sickness, because 
if during the month a comrade gets sick and is taken to the 
hospital or is treated at home, well, it must be justified. But 
that is not enough. I say this because the sick leave rate is 
very high, and it does not justify absenteeism. To achieve the 
incentives, the worker must have zero absence. 
  The Basic Industry Ministry has special infirmaries for 
those 
workers with some kind of problem. That is, we have 
professionalism and morale, and a revolutionary health system. 
We take care of any worker who might get sick. If he needs help 
at home, we go to his house to help him. But that is as far as 
we can go. That is, this system of giving incentives will be 
very strict. 
  [Rodriguez] These incentives are not for all, just for the 
best, for those who fulfill their jobs. 
  [Portal] Yes, for the good workers. Well, I am talking about 
discipline. And the other aspect I would like to mention is the 
fulfillment of what I have just explained; that is, the 
availability factor of thermoelectric plants, the fulfillment of 
the repair and maintenance work. Listen, most of our workers are 
well-disciplined. They are not worried about this. But I have to 
say it because it must be clear to all sectors that this is an 
exceptional decision, and that the country has made this 
decision, together with the workers, and it aims at obtaining a 
result. Otherwise, it will just be a mess. And it will not be 
that way. If the country and the Revolution must trust someone, 
the workers from the electricity area are the first to be 
trusted. 
  This second measure looks more like an incentive because the 
country and society want to recognize the role played by the 
workers. I think this will yield a result. Yesterday, the 
directors of the thermoelectric plants, the union leaders, and 
our comrades have ratified the conditions under which this 
incentive will be granted. We think that within the next few 
days it will be implemented, especially during the first days of 
May. 
  The other matter I wanted to discuss is that related to the 
support given to the thermoelectric plants. The country's 
constructive capacity is strong, and the Ministry of 
Construction is supporting the repair and maintenance work both 
in Santiago de Cuba and in Mariel, as well as in Nuevitas. That 
is, to the extent that the resources arrive, the country will 
have more possibilities for facing this problem. The SIME 
[Steelworking Industry] is doing the same. 
  Concerning the consumption of electricity, both in state 
organizations and in the homes, I just wanted to say the 
following: We have to be very strict concerning production in 
the most effective companies. This is being done by all 
ministries. The electricity received must be used well. All the 
unimportant areas must be eliminated, such as air conditioners. 
These must be eliminated. That is, consumption must be minimal. 
During these difficult months, we must try to use it as little 
as possible. 
  Now, let me refer to the prioritized organizations, the 
hospitals, the hotels, some industries, [changes thought] well, 
there are industries that finance their own fuel and give away 
their dollars; these are not prioritized industries. Several of 
our comrades have traveled abroad. We have visited some 
countries and were able to see what happens in hotels at dawn or 
in the evening -- all lights and systems are extinguished. Well, 
I do not want to [words indistinct]. The organizations are 
already working in making a thorough control or inspection, or 
whatever might be necessary, to prevent the electricity from 
being misused at a given time of day. We must adopt these 
measures now more than ever. This will be indispensable over the 
next few months. 
  A new system is being prepared in the capital, which is more 
complex. It is a disconnection system that will be implemented 
when a thermoelectric plant unexpectedly stops operating. That 
is, there will be a system to regulate the level of electricity 
supply to help us regulate consumption. That is, if 30 percent 
of the overall capacity is to be released, well, that is what we 
are going to do. We are working on this. 
  Finally, I also want to mention something I consider 
important, that there are two thermoelectric plants under 
construction. One in Holguin, specifically in Felton. Both were 
made by Czechoslovakia. But the company that had supplied them 
has fulfilled its commitment. In previous years when we had a 
serious fuel shortage that also affected the nickel plant 
located in the same province, these units helped guarantee the 
supply of energy. And we expect to finish the first unit by the 
end of the year. 
  [Rodriguez] The one in Felton. 
  [Portal] Yes, in Felton. This unit can produce 250 
megawatts. 
In Santiago de Cuba the Rente plant has not been able to 
stabilize the generation of more than 200 megawatts during the 
entire year. You can thus imagine the significance of generating 
250 megawatts by the end of the year in the eastern region, 
starting in Las Tunas. More than 3.6 million Cubans live in this 
area, that is, 35 percent of our population. This means that 
electricity generation in this territory will be improved, and 
this will also improve the supply of electricity in the western 
region because there will be no more need to extend electricity 
supply toward the eastern region. This is to take place by the 
end of the year, and is not something that will take place right 
now. But I wanted to tell you that we are receiving resources 
little by little. The work has not been suspended and the 
workers are prepared to continue. I believe this is objective 
information given by the provincial government, the party, the 
Construction Ministry, and the workers' contingent. This can 
really be achieved, and perhaps 18 or 24 months later we will 
have the second unit. That means 500 megawatts. That is, if the 
overall system generates 3,000 megawatts, 500 megawatts 
represent almost 15 percent, between 12 and 15 percent. 
  There is another 100-megawatt unit, unit number 11 of the 
Soviet- made 100-megawatt plants. In the eastern part of Havana 
there are five 200-megawatt units. There are three 100-megwatt 
and five 200-megawatt units. The five 200-megawatt units are no 
longer operating and will not be repaired. They are part of 
other aspirations, of other levels of development which we will 
not reach. But that 100-megawatt unit is very important. As I 
explained before, it is sitting on an oil deposit. Thus, some 
350 new megawatts will be generated by the end of the year. This 
is almost 12 percent. This is a unit that will also improve the 
country's generation, by almost 12 percent of the overall 
production. And when the other 250-megawatt unit begins 
operating, it will increase by another percentage point. If we 
generate 500 or 600 megawatts in the east, that is almost 20 
percent of the overall system. But this is still under 
construction; this is what we wanted to explain in this 
introduction. 
  [Rodriguez] Very well, minister. Let us now give the floor 
to 
our guests, the reporters. I do not know whether to begin from 
the left or the right. I think Maribel wants to speak. Maribel 
Acosta is from Radio Rebelde. 
  [Acosta] The explanation has been very broad, and we wanted 
to get into details. According to your explanation, the energy 
crisis we are experiencing today is caused by the thermoelectric 
plants and not by the petroleum crisis. You also said that the 
use of Cuban crude oil was relatively safe, that is, that the 
maintenance problem existed with or without the use of the Cuban 
petroleum, so you did not proscribe the use of the Cuban oil. 
You also mentioned a maintenance timetable which will be 
implemented soon, and that this must lead the country to reach a 
generating capacity of 60 percent by the end of the year. My 
question is this: How long or when will the current blackouts be 
reduced? After such a long time, how will this situation, 
specifically the situation of the blackouts, be reversed? 
  [Portal] Maribel, this situation is affecting the entire 
country. The situation in the capital today is what the 
provinces have been experiencing for many months. This has been 
a lengthy period. The situation prevailing over the past 15 days 
because of the breakdown of the Cespedes thermoelectric plant, 
which I already explained, and because of other failures here in 
the capital, I cannot say is exceptional. This situation has 
been affecting the entire country, but here in the capital the 
situation is worse because of the situation of services, 
overpopulation, the tall buildings...[changes thought] that is, 
we are well aware of this situation; even the water supply was 
affected at a given moment. That is, this is a very difficult 
situation. 
  Then, the generation of electricity has not been restricted 
to 15 hours. That is, it has been improving because it was 
dropped to nine and eight hours. But I want to explain this 
because in your question you mentioned the fuel issue, and we 
cannot say that there will be no difficulties with fuel. We will 
have difficult moments throughout the year, and it is possible 
that we may have a fuel shortage. We must be prepared not only 
to include the available capacity but to face any difficulty. 
  For this reason I was explaining the measures that will be 
adopted. I explained in the beginning that this is not possible. 
I explained in the beginning that we are going to seek 
solutions, not miracles. We do not think blackouts will be 
solved in a short period of time. It is not possible, not even 
by generating more electricity or producing more fuel, because 
today we are generating a certain amount of electricity; we 
cannot generate, just overnight, the same amount of electricity 
we used to generate some three years ago. The country does not 
have enough currency to say that the blackouts will end in one, 
two, three, or five months. The timetable of repairs, Maribel, 
is being fulfilled. That is, the Matanzas [plant] was paralyzed 
in September and we are already beginning to recover our 
capacity. I said that when the Matanzas [plant] stopped 
operating, generating capacity was approximately 36 percent; now 
we have between 44 and 45 percent, and it must keep increasing 
to stabilize at 50 percent by July or August. Then it must keep 
increasing to reach 60 percent. Do you understand this? 
  [Acosta] And what would this 60 percent represent as far as 
the blackouts? 
  [Portal] Well, concerning electricity generation, we believe 
that by increasing generation to 60 percent by the end of the 
year, the blackouts during the day will be eliminated. That is 
my belief. The blackouts that take place at night...[changes 
thought] well, there must be other reasons. But I do not want to 
give you the idea that there will be no problem with fuel, that 
everything has been stabilized, etc. No. The problems I have 
mentioned concerning financing...[changes thought] the nickel 
production and not even the sugar industry will be sufficient to 
solve this problem. I want to remind you that we started the 
blackouts in late 1989 and throughout 1990. That is, we had to 
start blackouts because it was impossible to avoid them, even by 
importing 6 million tons of petroleum, and much less with the 
1.2 million tons we will have this year. We hope for a little 
more. 
  [Rodriguez] Of national crude oil? 
  [Portal] Yes, national crude oil. If we did not have the 
national crude, Maribel, I could not have told you this story. 
  [Rodriguez] That is, if we speak in sports terms, we have 
saved the game. It has saved our game. Susana Lee, your turn to 
ask. 
  [Lee] Minister, you have already answered a number of 
questions we and some listeners wanted to ask. Nevertheless, I 
want to ask you something about electricity bills. With so many 
blackouts, the bills have also been increased. This is one 
question, on electricity bills. Moreover, in the workers' 
parliaments which were held recently, many people proposed 
raising the electricity rate as a way to streamline the economy. 
What is the truth about this, or what are your ideas about it? 
  [Portal] On this issue, I am forced to say that Cuba is one 
of the countries where people pay their electricity bills with 
greater discipline. I must say this, now that you ask me this 
question about bills. This shows that our people....[changes 
thought] We have 2.5 million families who must pay for the 
electricity they use. And today the family's debt for 
electricity is less than [words indistinct]. This is only one 
example. The same thing happens with the state. This is the 
largest organization in the country and it has a billing system 
different from other state organizations, but it is a system 
that works. Now that you have asked the question, I want to 
convey my appreciation for that discipline, which has not been 
lost. 
  [Rodriguez] Does everyone pay electricity bills? 
  [Portal] Yes, everyone does. It is true that some bills are 
collected at the house, but bills can also be paid in one of our 
units, at the banks, or at the post office. There are easy ways 
to pay these bills, but the people....[changes thought] Well, in 
some provinces payments have been delayed, but have been 
recovered and the discipline has not been lost. 
  The electricity rate per family has increased 14 percent 
despite the blackouts. It is obvious, Susana, that when the 
blackouts are restored -- and I thank you for asking this 
question because it gives me the opportunity to explain this -- 
when we restore the electricity supply, it surges into the 
system, the refrigerator, the television set, the lights, etc.; 
everything is turned on, and the discipline which has been 
excellent is lost. When one gets used to cooking with 
electricity, it is impossible to consume less electricity, even 
when there are blackouts at the time for cooking, when 
electricity is in heavy demand. For this reason I think there is 
an increase in the electricity bills, and of course the people 
worry about this situation. But part of the energy is recovered 
despite the blackout. Of course, television programs are not 
recovered. But the iron and the refrigerator do recover some of 
the energy. That is, part of the energy is recovered. This has 
been demonstrated, and the electric meters record it and it must 
be paid. That must be the cause of the increase. 
  The other question is also important. Many capitalist 
countries, especially those in which the consumer society 
supposedly tends to increase expenditures, have performed 
calculations and reached the conclusion that they save more or 
obtain more benefits from increasing the utility rates, although 
this might favor savings, than from building new thermoelectric 
plants and increasing the generating capacity. This is true in 
the United States and other countries. Our rates are fixed: nine 
cents, regardless of whether consumption is higher or lower. 
Most countries have already been replacing this system 
gradually: the greater the consumption, the higher....[changes 
thought] This is just the opposite of what prevailed here after 
the Revolution, when the greater the consumption, the lower the 
payment. This has been changing. Now, what is our conclusion? 
  No decision has been made on this; neither can I talk about 
rates. But we have analyzed the following: Forty-two percent of 
the Cuban population consumes up to 100 kwh of electricity. And 
this consumption is approximately 25, or between 25 and 30 
[percent], of the overall energy in the residential sphere. That 
is almost half of the population. 
  [Rodriguez] It is 42 percent. 
  [Portal] Now, whom does that figure represent? That figure 
represents low-income families. We have this well calculated. 
There are the retired people, low-income workers, this or that, 
workers in general, etc. Well, one proposal is that the rate 
should be fixed for that part of the population. The rate that 
is valid today should be maintained. And this rate is up to nine 
pesos monthly. This is one idea. 
  Then, those families that consume between 100 and 300 kw 
must 
pay that rate up to the first 100 kw; above 100 kw, they must 
pay a different rate. 
  [Rodriguez] After 100 kw, the rate should be higher. 
  [Portal] Yes. If you double the price per kilowatt/hour to 
20 
pesos, to give an example, you are stimulating people not to 
consume over 100 kw. You know that today it is forbidden to 
consume over 300 kw. This is included in the plan, even though 
the use of electric stoves and so forth complicates it. But we 
will never authorize a consumption higher than 300 kw, even when 
this is stabilized. We will penalize consumption above 300 kw, 
and you know what the punishment will be: The electricity will 
be shut off for 10 days the first time, then for 30 days. This 
has been done several times. This has created discipline. This 
is a preliminary idea I am giving you, Susana. 
  [Rodriguez] And are you and the ministry studying this 
possibility? 
  [Portal] Yes. Well, other organizations are charged with 
studying how much is collected through this channel. But as we 
have been taught, electricity conservation is very important for 
us, not electricity sales. The problem is not to collect more 
but to prevent people from consuming more. And electricity rates 
cannot be liberated because in that case, a person who obtains 
money through several channels will be free to consume 
electricity. This will not be allowed. The plan must be 
maintained. This is the idea, Susana, and it seems to be 
accepted by most of the people. And if some of the people do not 
agree, well, we will have to raise the price above 100 kw and 
impose a very strong punishment. 
  [Rodriguez] The idea is to stimulate electricity 
conservation. 
  [Portal] That is the idea. 
  [Rodriguez] Osvaldo? 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Minister, I want to return to the 
subject 
that most irritates people: the blackouts. You answered a 
question on why some zones are affected by blackouts while 
others are not, especially those priority zones such as 
hospitals, hotels, tourist centers, water pumping systems, and 
refrigeration plants. But some people think that blackouts are 
more frequent in their zones than in others and imagine that the 
frequency is lower in other provinces. Also, we have received 
calls here in the studio and are still receiving messages from 
our viewers stating that service is often interrupted, 
especially at night. It was mentioned that Revolution Square 
tonight was affected by intermittent blackouts. The lights were 
on and off several times tonight. People also asked why the ball 
games are played at night when we are facing this situation. Why 
aren't the games shifted to the daytime? Perhaps Hector 
Rodriguez will help you answer this question. But, in general, I 
would like you to expand a little more on the outlook for 
improvement of the thermoelectric plants, on the outlook for 
blackouts and whether they save oil, because this is another 
point often asked by the people. Because, as you said, when the 
lights go back on, normally the refrigerators start working, 
everyone turns their equipment on, and consumption rises. 
  [Lee] I would like to add something to this: People have 
also 
asked about the zones not affected by blackouts in 
municipalities with underground power lines. Many television 
viewers have asked about this. Those people fear that the lines 
could develop problems because they are so old; they want to 
know what solutions there may be for the underground lines. 
  [Hector Rodriguez] That is like asking me... 
  [Portal, interrupting] Very well. There are circuits that 
are 
cut off. Not all circuits have the same load, the same number of 
houses, or the same economic objective. That is the fact. 
  The instructions given to our comrades is to try to be as 
fair as possible, that the blackouts be as equal as possible for 
all. If the blackout is for six hours, then it will be six hours 
for all. And if it is for four hours, then four hours for all. 
There may be some guidelines that are not being fulfilled during 
this period, but we are trying to fulfill them as much as 
possible. We are also trying to maintain the best discipline in 
this area. 
  But concerning the fact that we are being unfair with this 
or 
that circuit, and that anyone can reach that conclusion, I have 
my doubts. I find it very difficult. We are controlling this 
continuously, and the control is in effect. We are always trying 
to control everything, especially when there are complaints. And 
people are really zealous about this. Perhaps on some circuits 
the blackouts are a little bit longer, an hour or half-hour 
more, because of the load affecting that circuit. 
  Since consumption and generation are simultaneous, measures 
are adopted to include 50 megawatts more to this or that 
circuit. Then the capital must choose the circuits and 
distribute power gradually. If there is one circuit with a load 
of 25 megawatts, or two circuits with 25 megawatts each, or one 
circuit with 30 and another with 20 megawatts, and there is 
another circuit with 10 megawatts, the circuit with 10 megawatts 
will wait, and the others will be added to a little more, and 
the following day a little more will be given to this and to 
another circuit, until the national power system says: Now you 
can add another load. This happens everyday. That is, the 
additional charge cannot be added instantly. It must be 
established gradually. So this is not and will not be exact. It 
is not possible. 
  And there are people who have been doing this for more than 
three years. This has been approved. The people know that when 
electricity generation was rather stable -- which we hope to 
recover by the end the year -- there was discipline. The 
disconnection hours were well established. This was an 
achievement, and I am certain that this will be restored to the 
extent that the conditions improve. 
  Now, connection or disconnection is usually the consequence 
of the overload on the circuits. This is a fact which I tried to 
explain, especially concerning the most complicated problems 
such as electric stoves, the overload on circuits, etc. I tried 
to explain this because when a transformer is overloaded, there 
is no way to solve it. And the light is turned on and off, on 
and off, and transformers cannot take this for a long time like 
a switch that is just turned on and off. 
  You must have seen also that tree pruning has begun. A tree 
branch can also cause a problem to a circuit or to a 
transformer. But this is not the essential thing we are 
discussing today. The essential thing we are discussing today is 
the overload on circuits that cannot handle a further increase. 
  Ball games do not consume more than what 500 families would 
consume. Ball games are played in a stadium. You know that the 
programming has been changed, adjusted. Most games take place 
during the day, and this is a recreational activity very 
important to our people, for their virtue and [word indistinct]. 
But concerning the playoffs that are played in the stadium... 
  [Hector Rodriguez, interrupting] Yes, there is only one 
national stadium, and the games are played there during the day. 
  [Portal] Then 2.5 million families will have electricity. 
And 
perhaps some 1,500 families will be affected when this occurs. 
Well, I think, Osvaldo, that for the time being, independently 
of the critical situation we are facing, we must try to maintain 
that entertainment which is very important. 
  [Hector Rodriguez] It is the main national entertainment. 
  [Portal] Yes. What was your question, Susana? 
  [Lee] I asked about the underground cables. 
  [Portal] Oh, yes. It is true that the underground network in 
Habana Vieja and part of central Havana is rather old. Part of 
the cables have been replaced, but the problem here is not the 
cables themselves but the system. It was a very modern and 
sophisticated system for that time. It automatically regulates 
the voltage when there is an interruption and reestablishes it 
through a different channel. I think it is too costly for Habana 
Vieja, for the historical part of Havana, to have that type of 
electrical system. And we must take care of it as something 
precious in the capital. What we have to do in that zone, and in 
all priority zones, is to demand, to be very scrupulous on 
electricity conservation. Yesterday, for instance, in order to 
make the distribution, we cut off the circuit; but we turned it 
on again, especially since it creates problems for some 
refrigeration facilities. For this reason this zone is turned 
off only in difficult and unavoidable moments. The system in 
this zone is expected to last several years more, and it will 
because we are taking good care of it. It has not been 
abandoned. But what you said is true, and we must demand a 
maximum savings there, both by the state organizations and by 
the people who live there. 
  [Hector Rodriguez] Does that answer your question, Maribel? 
  [Acosta] Yes, thank you. Comrade minister, you have said 
that 
$10 million will be invested this year in maintenance and repair 
of the thermoelectric plants. What does this figure represent in 
relation to the current needs? And also, in our current 
relations with the former Socialist Bloc, to what extent is our 
country or our technology capable of guaranteeing the technology 
which you said has reached 66 percent of the thermoelectric 
plants existing in the country, and are the new investments 
linked to these plants? 
  [Portal] Yes. Well, we have $10 million. And you might ask: 
What is the minimum necessary for the electrical system as a 
whole? Considering the $35 million we used to receive for the 
electrical network, for transformers and all the rest of the 
system, the level was much higher. The needs for the 
thermoelectric plants could be estimated at approximately $20 
million, between $18 and $20 million. But with $10 million we 
will be able to fulfill what has been established, as I have 
explained. This is an important figure. 
  Negotiations are under way with Russian and Czech officials 
to explore the possibility of obtaining some resources for these 
thermoelectric plants. They have listened to our requests with 
great responsibility and gravity and they are studying the 
possibility of participation or economic cooperation. But this 
cooperation will be financed and we must pay for it. I am not 
talking about any other type of assistance. I am talking about 
economic cooperation, about business. We hope this will be 
resolved before the end of the year, and I think it will. But I 
do not want to confirm this categorically or to create false 
expectations. 
  There are many people in these countries who regret what has 
happened to relations with our country; and there is an idea, 
wish, will, to reestablish commercial relations with our country 
on new foundations. And we, of course, would never refuse to do 
this. Our people...[rephrases] I do not think that could have 
[words indistinct]. 
  That is possible (?in Mariel). There is certain 
technological 
equipment, such as a turbine, or a generator...[rephrases] There 
are things that really must be taken care of by the factory that 
planned them. There are very specific things that were done 
there. There is a part of the thermoelectric plant that is 
universal. Let us say that to do this or that [words indistinct] 
you can substitute one piece of equipment by another. That is, 
it is always possible to obtain a part of the equipment in 
another country, if that problem exists. But, well, that 
possibility does exist, and I think it only fair to say so. That 
is to say: It is not an impossibility that our national 
electricity system could receive a certain participation from, 
do business with, this company of the two...[rephrases] of the 
countries that inherited the installations, the workshops, and 
factories that used to produce these (?installations). 
  [Hector Rodriguez] Osvaldo?. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Yes. Mr. Minister, the nation ended up 
practically paralyzed last year -- its economy, its factories. 
However, at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, 
certain plants began operating, which I suppose has increased 
the demand for electricity. You explained -- I refer once again 
to the chart by which you explained the repairs to, the 
maintenance of the thermoelectric plants -- how capability is to 
be recovered. And I would ask you: Could the electricity system 
compromise the future of our economic recovery, which certain 
specialists see as being imminent? 
  [Portal] I can answer that categorically for you: With these 
measures that have been taken, the national electricity system, 
its generating capacity, is not going to constitute a brake to 
development or to exiting the special period. That is why, 
Osvaldito, it is good to reiterate: When I explained that 86 
percent of the capacity...[rephrases] It is one of the countries 
with the newest electrical installations. I do not know whether 
there is any other 25 years old whose generating capacity is at 
86 percent. It seems to me that very few countries (?can do 
this), and that has been created over these last 30 years of 
Revolution. I mean, that is a fact; understand, Osvaldo? And 
that is very reassuring. 
  The 500 megawatts [words indistinct] plus the 100 equals 600 
additional new ones. I mean: In order to pull out of the special 
period over the next few years, by the end of the century, the 
nation's installed capacity today, by maintaining and repairing 
and everything that we have explained that we have already begun 
to do and to reestablish...[rephrases] There is no doubt: The 
electricity networks are powerful. The country is crossed from 
east to west with 220-volt and 110-volt lines, which must also 
receive maintenance. But powerful substations were established 
on most of the national territory. I reaffirm what I explained a 
while ago. And the generating capacity is recoverable. 
  Later, at some point in the future, we will have to build 
new 
thermoelectric plants, of course, but....[leaves sentence 
unfinished] 
  I also want to tell you that the country 
anticipated...[rephrases] for example, there are the 
five...[rephrases] this one here in eastern Havana, a 
thermoelectric plant which is prepared to be [words indistinct]. 
The one in Matanzas is ready for another to be set up beside it. 
We would no longer have to build a canal to supply and drain sea 
water. All the workshops and all that are already there. Felton 
was planned to accommodate two more units. That is to say that 
we today have -- just as was done in Mariel, which was planned 
to accommodate eight units although it began with two or four or 
so...[rephrases] that, today, is very important: These three 
thermoelectric plants -- Felton, the one in Havana, and the one 
in Matanzas -- are prepared to expand their capacities without 
the necessity for big investments in civil engineering, etc. The 
machines do have to be purchased; that is something we will have 
to take into account in the future, if necessary. It would be 
very quick work to install, to expand capacity, as developments 
might require of us. 
  [Hector Rodriguez] Susana? 
  [Lee] Mr. Minister, you were speaking of oil extraction. You 
were talking about the importance of the almost 900,000 tons 
that are used to generate electricity. I think it would be a 
good idea for you to talk to us a little about the prospects 
that exist as regards oil extraction, about the work being done 
in the search for oil, about the new technologies that are being 
applied to increase efficiency in extraction. That is what I 
would like to ask you. 
  [Portal] I do not know whether this might not take me off 
the 
topic a little. I would not be against answering, 
but...[addresses moderator] if you authorize me to do so, 
I....[leaves sentence unfinished] 
  [Hector Rodriguez] We have time. 
  [Portal] Will anything be left on the other topic? Can we 
get 
into that? 
  [Hector Rodriguez] The matter of generating electricity has 
been exhausted. 
  [Acosta] Hector, fundamental concerns that we have heard 
from 
the population. 
  [Hector Rodriguez] I do not know whether the minister has 
anything else. 
  [Portal] I have tried to explain without exhortation, with 
the greatest possible objectivity, right? I would like perhaps 
to comment that the electricity sector workers -- the sector 
chiefs, technicians, [words indistinct] in general -- bear an 
extraordinary responsibility on their shoulders. 
  [Hector Rodriguez] Of course. 
  [Portal] They have the foundation, which is what has 
provided, I think, the authority, the respect for what we have 
had to do over these past three or four years -- an authority 
won by being one of the branches that for 25 years, 
uninterruptedly, grew from year to year, without failing to grow 
for a single year. And with diminishing fuel consumption from 
year to year. Efficiency increased from 400 grams in 1959 to 
270, through investments and so forth. That is not the work of 
the electricity sector workers alone. I mean, construction 
workers, the nation, the government, the Revolution all worked 
on it. But that foundation was exploited, and at a level 
comparable to that of the Western countries. That is important. 
The nation's 95-percent electrification is something 
spectacular. We know about other countries, in Asia, for 
example...[changes thought] Vietnam itself, with whose 
authorities we have spoken, is 35-percent electrified. In Latin 
America, there are other countries...[rephrases] (?low) 
countries. China itself is not electrified to the extent that we 
are. They may be at 75 or 80 percent. They have areas with many 
problems still, rural areas. The country is very large. It is 
very difficult. We, ourselves, have 95-percent electrification. 
  I say this now, at the end, to give confidence that we (?are 
going to solve) this problem. I mean, this is not a problem that 
will be delegated to improvised people, people who...[rephrases] 
No, we are really working, soberly, and there will be a response 
by the electricity industry, by our workers, by everyone. I 
think that the support from the Ministry of Construction, the 
comrades from the (?SIME) [Steelworking Industry], and the 
comrades from other forces that are going to join in, as the 
resources become available to us, is also important. This gives 
us great confidence, really, that the country will be able to 
recover from this situation we are in. 
  The other subject is one that is very... 
  [Hector Rodriguez, interrupting] Mr. Minister, excuse me: 
Before you go into (?that), a viewer has just called in and is 
asking -- he seems not to be fully satisfied, even with all the 
explaining -- whether the Cienfuegos CEN, the Cienfuegos Nuclear 
Power Plant, will be finished, and whether this would solve the 
country's electrical power problem. 
  [Portal] All right, then let us finish with the CEN. 
  [Hector Rodriguez] Then petroleum would be the last thing, 
right? 
  [Portal] Yes. Well, we halted the CEN. We halted it. The 
commander in chief himself, as you know, met with the workers 
there and explained the decision, one of the most painful we 
have had to make. The Russian and Cuban Governments have 
confirmed their will to do everything they possibly can to 
finish the CEN -- the first and second reactors -- their will, 
desire, and interest. Both governments need a third partner to 
participate in the Juragua CEN. The three countries would have 
to share that investment, and then, logically, sell for hard 
currency the energy generated at the Juragua CEN. And we would 
have to pay those countries for it, for our country -- for the 
portion that would correspond to it. 
  The country does not today have the financial means to 
continue building the Juragua nuclear power plant, and we would 
have to effect a business deal of that nature. 
  The work has been preserved. The civil engineering work for 
the first reactor is finished. It is fabulous. There you have 
the reactor, and part of the equipment, preserved. Over the past 
two years, the country has been inspected by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], rigorous inspections that have 
helped counter propaganda campaigns abroad regarding CEN 
technology and so forth. We have received the IAEA technicians; 
their recommendations were that the CEN is being perfectly 
preserved and that a business deal can go forward with it, that 
the nuclear power plant can be continued. 
  If that inspection had not been positive, had there been any 
doubt, I would not be talking about this. So, I mean, those are 
the conditions today. The Russians, the Cuban and Russian 
Government and the energy authorities of the two countries, are 
today analyzing things and negotiating with a number of 
international firms that have expressed an interest in the 
matter. 
  That is very interesting. It is a complex business, as you 
can well imagine. Difficult, but it would really allow us to 
finish, if it is feasible and could happen. 
  These are very complex negotiations. Those are our 
prospects, 
as regards the CEN. We do not have, right now, the financial 
means to continue the work ourselves, alone. That is clear, and 
that is why the work was halted. And, very responsibly, both the 
comrade construction workers -- who remain there -- and our 
comrades who are prepared for exploitation, are there. And the 
CEN could be two years away from being finished. 
  If it were to be set up and finished, it would mean 400 
megawatts of nuclear-generated power. That is what I can tell 
you regarding that matter. 
  [Acosta] Does the third partner already exist, Mr. Minister? 
  [Portal] No, and maybe if it did, I would not be able to 
tell 
you so, at this moment. [all chuckle] So let's go on to the oil: 
In the case of the oil... 
  [Hector Rodriguez, interrupting] You would not be able to 
tell us because they [not further identified] are so alert to 
every bit of business that Cuba does, to every single thing it 
might buy, so as to block it immediately, apply pressure 
immediately. Would that be the reason? Obviously. 
  [Portal] But as regards the technology of our nuclear power 
plant and all that, even serious U.S. authorities already 
acknowledge that the technology of our CEN is safe, that the CEN 
can be finished, that there is no problem. We have information 
from very important U.S. Government authorities that have 
acknowledged that there is no difficulty. That smooths out the 
way for other partners to be able to...[rephrases] finish the 
CEN. So, let's go on to the oil. 
  [Hector Rodriguez] Yes, that (?question) of Susana's is 
still 
floating around. 
  [Portal] The oil: Here, maybe we can share certain things 
that could be encouraging to our population. As is known, we 
divided the island up into blocs -- both land and sea, some 26 
blocs -- for exploring for oil, and we have negotiated 
investments by several companies in oil exploration. To a 
certain extent, this is related to the energy thing, the 
nation's situation and all. 
  Why do I say this? Because this kind of business deal is one 
of the most difficult, because the foreign companies have to run 
the risk -- investing, during a first stage, tens of millions of 
dollars and, in a second stage, hundreds of millions of dollars! 
That is: You have to put money into it. And in one way or 
another, over $50 million have already been invested by these 
companies in the Cuban oil business. All together, it is already 
nearing $100 million in seeking, exploring for, oil. 
  These companies invest, and if oil is found they recover 
their investment -- through a part of that oil, depending on how 
much oil there is and what quality is obtained. If it is a big 
deposit, and the oil is good quality, it can be as much as 90 
percent for the Cuban side and 10 percent for the foreign 
company. During the period of recovery of the investment, it is 
to be 50-50. Once the investment is recovered, in the first few 
years, once those are past, it depends on the volume and quality 
of oil found. 
  Well, of the seven most developed countries in the world -- 
and I can mention the United States, Japan, the FRG [as heard], 
etc. -- three are investing in petroleum exploration in Cuba. 
They are France -- several companies -- Canada, and Great 
Britain. 
  I do not think I am telling any secret in saying that Great 
Britain is the main U.S. ally, a country which in its 
parliamentary organizations has publicly studied its relations 
with Cuba. It did so in the House of Lords. And it is 
interesting to see how some British political figures and 
businessmen analyze the U.S. policy on Cuba, and how they 
realize that Americans have a double objective with us: a 
political objective, which obviously seeks to destroy the 
Revolution by all means; and an economic objective, which is to 
prevent other countries from investing in our country. When the 
United States decides to lift the blockade, let us say in 20 or 
100 years [changes thought] or perhaps, if an important oil 
deposit is found, the blockade will no longer have any effect. I 
hope this will happen. 
  But it is quite interesting to see how these political 
figures analyzed this situation and reached the conclusion that 
it is important to favor the trade of the former British 
colonies which have natural, historical, and economic relations 
with us. They have realized that our touristic development must 
be related to the touristic development of many of those islands 
that live on tourism, and that this is the moment to begin. They 
have taken the first step. One of their companies has already 
signed a petroleum research contract. That is, there are three 
[as heard] countries: France, Canada, Great Britain, and also 
Sweden. 
  I am not talking about the U.S. Government, but about its 
oil 
companies, the U.S. businessmen from the petroleum sector, and 
other organizations such as the mining, iron and steel, and 
tourism industry areas who have expressed concern about and are 
fully aware of our situation, hoping to be authorized to invest 
here. They have attended the meetings we held in Canada and in 
Great Britain -- that is, in London and in Calgary -- where our 
comrades submitted proposals. And the great U.S. companies were 
there; they obtained all the information they needed and they 
are up-to-date concerning this situation. That is, they are 
willing to come here, but they also have other interests; but we 
can see and feel that there is great interest in this area. 
  There is a search for oil today everywhere in Cuba, in 
different stages. In some parts we are using the seismic 
exploration system, which is a mandatory step. This is because 
the seismic system determines the soil structure, the age of the 
earth, the geology, and the characteristics of the place which 
are best for drilling. If these structures are not revealed, 
then no drilling takes place. That is the first step. It is a 
guiding step, but millions of dollars must be invested in that 
first step. If it takes place offshore, a special vessel will be 
necessary. But if it is carried out on land, well, equipment of 
highly developed technology is in use in the country. 
  Both on land and offshore, this highly sophisticated 
equipment will supplement the information -- and it is fair to 
say this -- the information we have developed with the former 
Soviet Union for many years. The country has been well studied. 
The country has seismic information; it has information on the 
geology of solid minerals and of petroleum and for this reason 
this study has been very useful, and for this reason we have 
made quick progress. And today we have signed contracts for 
exploration of the most promising areas in the country. 
  Then, at the conclusion of the seismic exploration step in 
some areas, it has been determined that there are seismic 
structures which are similar to the seismic structures of other 
countries and which offer good drilling prospects. Drilling has 
begun. Well, the drilling has begun offshore, and drilling by 
these companies will also begin on land within the next few days 
or next week. If the prospects were not good, we would 
not....[leaves sentence unfinished] Now, if this study shows 
that those sedimentary rocks are from the same time period as 
those in other countries where oil was found, and whether they 
contain petroleum or not, a decision will be made. But Cuba has 
oil; we hope to extract 1.2 million tons this year, and there 
are good prospects to increase this production. 
  Well, this is as much as I can tell you. We have taken the 
seismic step, and the drillings have begun in those places, and 
our hopes are not just abstract. Our hopes are real, and the 
prospects are also real. 
  I also want to add that if oil is found, or let us suppose 
that when an oil deposit is found, we must then determine how 
much petroleum is in that deposit; depending on the structure, 
three or four wells more must be drilled to determine the volume 
of the petroleum existing in that place. The exploitation comes 
later and can take two or three years, depending on the deposit 
and its characteristics. But I think it would be foolish to try 
to conceal any information from the people on this problem. I 
think it would be very encouraging for the people to receive any 
information of this type, and we are never going to conceal such 
information. I thought, therefore, that it was important to 
explain this. 
  These companies have other tasks which will also give us an 
idea of how promising the petroleum business is in Cuba. The 
fact is that using the old Soviet techniques, or the old Soviet 
wells, we have contracted foreign companies to exploit these 
wells. For instance, a foreign company chooses a well that was 
producing 30 tons, 20 tons, 15, or 10 tons, and, using more 
modern technology, increases the production of that well. Some 
have increased two, three, or four times more. Some have reached 
production of 60, 70, or 80 tons. And they started with 20 tons. 
Then this increase in oil, which Cuba was never going to have, 
was divided and shared with that company. That is, the basic 
production is not negotiated. That is ours. But if production is 
increased by using modern technology...[changes thought] and we 
have been doing this over the past few years. That is, the 
petroleum activity has this potential and we can enjoy it. 
  I did not want to discuss this from the political point of 
view; but, well, this is just a feeling I have, and I have to 
say it because this is what most Cubans are feeling. In this 
period, every time we sign a contract of this sort, whether on 
oil, nickel, mining in general, or in the quest of precious 
minerals, or in tourism, etc., with non-U.S. companies, we feel 
a satisfaction, and more than a satisfaction because we have no 
prejudice but an assurance that in the future we must not do 
this type of business with U.S. companies alone. This would 
imply compromising our economic independence for the third time 
with that powerful country. And this does not seem to be what we 
Cubans want. We could not avoid it if the blockade were lifted. 
But only in part, because we are not rejecting any offer. If the 
American people want to enjoy our beaches, etc., we are not 
going to say: Do not build hotels here; don't do this or that. 
It would be foolish on our part to refuse these things. 
  But it is good that we build our own hotels, or build them 
with the Spaniards, with the Italians or the Canadians, or with 
any country in the world. Well, the Americans are delaying this. 
But in the future, if the blockade is lifted, part of the U.S. 
tourists will have to go to those hotels. We realize -- and it 
is something I was trying to convey -- we feel as if we were 
winning a war of independence each time we do business with 
non-American capital. This is what I was trying to say. 
  But we cannot deny the fact that the United States, that 
powerful country, that market about which no one has any doubt 
because it is a high-level market with highly developed 
technology, can be attractive to us as well. This feeling is 
also shared by the other companies that come here today. 
  I want to add that we Cubans are loyal. We are loyal. The 
Cuban loyalty has been proven. We are loyal even to our African 
forefathers. And serious capitalists, representatives of the 
upstanding companies, also feel that when we do business with 
one of these companies, we are never going to betray them, not 
even when the United States decides to lift the blockade. 
Neither are we going to renegotiate the business or deals we 
have signed. 
  [Hector Rodriguez] We are serious and loyal. 
  [Portal] And this is the rationale of the electricity issue 
to which they refer so much. You have to see what is being 
published abroad, how the news is distorted and the treatment 
they give to this issue. They say: The country's electricity 
generating capacity has fallen apart; do not invest in this area 
anymore. Here is the truth about what they are saying. 
  For this reason, our reporters must try to be as objective 
as 
possible because it is obvious that they are trying to thwart, 
to discourage people. But prestigious people are arriving here 
continuously. And as soon as they arrive at the airport, they 
realize the problems we are facing, especially the blackouts, 
the transport and food problems, etc. Well, people immediately 
refer to our preparation and the possibilities of doing business 
here. They refer to our loyalty and honesty in our deals. No one 
has to offer $1 million to a minister, or $2 million to 
negotiate this or that. There is no corruption in government 
circles. Many serious people are coming here, and not just 
because they like to be here. 
  Not in vain are we in the 19th place in the world among 
countries where investments can be made with greater security. 
How many are behind us; but I do not want to mention names. I 
believe the press has already published this, but they can 
publish it again at any time; they can do it today, because this 
is something very important. 
  We are one of the most promising countries for investments. 
This also confirms our people's decision to fight and to 
overcome all our problems. They do not want to be caught in a 
situation of hunger, proceeding from here to there. No. our 
people do not want this. They are taking this calmly and with 
intelligence. 
  You can see that the situation stemming from the 
electricity problem is very difficult. But we are facing it and 
trying to overcome it. People know that this is not going to 
last forever, and that we are not going to die without having 
had a chance to fight and win. 
  We are also accused of not making changes, of not doing this 
or that, when changes were made only a few months ago. This is 
perceived by the capitalists who come here. We have made 
tremendous changes in the economy. A few years ago we would not 
even think of making these changes. We have made changes in 
agriculture, changes related to the presence of foreign capital, 
and to the decriminalization of the dollar. These changes hurt 
because they are often unfair, but we have made them 
courageously. We can also mention the self-employment jobs, 
communications with the world abroad, relations with the 
community of emigres, et cetera. These are crucial decisions, 
and we must consider that there are still millions of decisions 
to be made, decisions that are being studied. 
  But the decisions that were made are serious decisions, 
decisions that are very important for the country. These 
decisions are not reversible, and the peasants and agricultural 
workers know this. They know that over the past few months, the 
state administration has been replaced by cooperatives. They 
know that there are guarantees, that they have security, and 
that they can work the land as much as possible because the 
fruits they produce will not be taken away from them. These are 
important steps, because the most common criticisms we hear are 
that no measures have been adopted, that the country is idle, 
that no one works. This is inadmissible. For this reason I was 
saying that it is important to explain. I think it is my duty to 
explain this, to share this with the people. But we cannot often 
share this. Excuse me if I am taking too much of your time, 
Hector. 
  [Rodriguez] No, on the contrary. We thank you, minister. I 
only want, if you wish, minister, to read a question posed by a 
listener from Havana. It says: How much has the demand increased 
this year at peak-consumption hours as a result of the use of 
electric stoves? 
  [Portal] I mentioned this when I mentioned the 350 megawatts 
at peak hour, but I failed to give the percentage. The demand is 
increasing 24 percent. This is a high percentage, and we cannot 
cope with it. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Minister, now that you are returning to 
this subject of the electric stoves at the very end of your 
participation in this program, allow me to ask you something 
that also worries the people. The liquefied gas and the 
kerosene: When will their distribution be reestablished? 
  [Portal] Tremendous resources must be used to achieve this, 
and I cannot give you an exact date. This is not possible to 
predict. I could say May or June, but there is a timetable to 
repair the Nico Lopez refinery plant. In May, we are going to 
import a good amount of gas, which is produced by the [word 
indistinct]. But it is impossible to tell you that we are going 
to solve this problem in a short time. I am only ratifying what 
I said because this is one of the most difficult, complex issues 
we must solve within the next few months. 
  [Hector Rodriguez] The electric stove issue seems to be 
crucial. 
  [Portal] Yes. 
  [Acosta] Minister, concerning the petroleum prospects you 
mentioned, is there a possibility of finding light petroleum in 
the country? 
  [Portal] That is what we are looking for. [laughs] 
  [Hector Rodriguez] It must show up somewhere. 
  [Portal] But if heavy petroleum is found, it will be 
welcomed. I think I will be forced to explain that we would use 
it again. Not to talk about cement, but if it can be used in 
producing cement, it will be of help. 
  [Hector Rodriguez] Well, the minister has been with us for 
almost two hours. I think his explanations were very clear and 
broad. I want to thank the minister for his presence here. I 
think this is the first time he has participated in this 
program. I have been after him for a long time, and he has been 
saying that he would be glad to join us to talk about this 
crucial electricity generation issue in the country. 
  I want to thank him for being here with us and for all the 
information he has given to the country. I think all the 
information was correct and on the mark. I believe he was 
consistent with everything. 
  I also wish to thank the reporters who participated in this 
program, and who have made the presence of Basic Industry 
Minister Marcos Portal on this program possible. Thank you, 
Minister, and although this was your first participation, I hope 
it will not be the last. 
  [Portal] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by Eduardo Gonzalez] </F>
  [Text] How good to participate in a union meeting that 
dedicated its time to the sector's main problems! That is what 
the fourth plenum of the science workers union in the city of 
Havana did. The plenum was held recently at the Center for 
Medicines Research and Development [Centro de Investigaciones y 
Desarrollo de Medicamentos], or CIDEN [acronymn as heard]. 
  The leaders of the science workers union in the capital 
agreed to focus their efforts on the union's integrating 
influence, on strengthening the base-level organizations, and, 
fundamentally, on political-ideological work. 
  Their analysis concluded that the 146 assemblies of the 
Parliaments in the Workplace process held at scientific 
institutions, in which more than 28,400 workers participated, 
allow us to typify the political situation, the revolutionary 
atmosphere, economic management problems, and the monitoring of 
sector production and research. 
  As a first conclusion, they found that the 
political-ideological work of the union could be its biggest 
contribution to solving problems, based on the workers' high and 
militant morale and support for the Revolution. Working from 
that premise, the science workers union in the capital laid out 
for itself a series of concrete tasks. 
  The first opportunity will come at the Assemblies for 
Economic Efficiency, which are to begin in mid-May. During that 
process, each suggestion from the parliaments will be evaluated 
and the joint measures to be adopted by the various 
administrations, the Communist Party of Cuba, the union, and the 
UJC [Union of Young Communists] will start to become concrete 
reality. Among these measures are, for example, specific actions 
that will establish the obligation to bear in mind cost and 
efficiency indicators in connection with each and every task, 
decentralized down to the level of every individual researcher, 
technician, or support worker. 
  Another intent is that of taking advantage of the potential 
of mechanisms already in force, such as evaluations, to 
guarantee the suitability of science workers, in response to a 
majority demand expressed during the parliaments. 
  The union will take precise measures to restore labor 
discipline, as much to combat absenteeism as to get every worker 
to make the best possible use of the workday and to produce 
according to his position. Each center will go into greater 
depth regarding the concept and scope of self-financing, based 
on the premise that the nation needs for science to continue 
increasing its contribution to financing the nation's economy. 
  Jorge Lezcano, first secretary of the Communist Party of 
Cuba 
in Havana City Province, expressed his satisfaction at these 
vital subjects as the focal point of the attention of the 
science workers union. For his part, Alfredo Morales, CTC [Cuban 
Workers Federation] secretary general in the capital, used the 
occasion to explain that the Assemblies for Economic Efficiency 
differ radically from the old Production and Services 
Assemblies. He said that it is now the workers -- jointly with 
the administration -- who are seeking solutions to difficulties, 
and that the discussion now centers not only on production, per 
se, but also on efficiency of production. It seems the young 
science workers union, and particularly its organizations in the 
capital, are setting standards for a union management that has 
moved away from mere useless formalities and has set its sights 
on the main objectives of contributing to saving our societal 
project and attaining development. 
  The way the science workers union vanguards celebrate their 
successes constitutes proof of this. This past Sunday [24 
April], they did voluntary work at the Augusto Cesar Sandino 
agricultural-livestock cooperative in San Antonio de los Banos. 
Meanwhile, the rest of the union members worked at cleaning up 
and beautifying their work centers.

  [Text] Alfredo Jordan Morales, Agriculture Minister and 
Politburo member, has said that the achievement of full 
integration of scientific centers is a priority, especially 
concerning the tasks of making furrows. 
  At the national meeting on miscellaneous crops, the 
agriculture minister said that the accomplishments and 
experience achieved so far are rather dispersed. It was decided 
at the meeting that the next planting campaign in the province 
[not further identified] will be designed with the participation 
of experts in the area. 
  Jordan presided over the creation of the 5 de Septiembre and 
19 de Abril farms for miscellaneous crops in Jobabo Municipality 
in Las Tunas. These two farms work 50 and 40 caballerias, 
respectively.

  [Text] The progress made in carrying out socioeconomic 
programs in Guantanamo Province was acknowledged today by a 
visiting ministerial committee headed by Division General Senen 
Casas Regueiro, who is also a member of the Central Committee of 
the Communist Party of Cuba. Casas Regueiro assessed as very 
positive the efforts that have been made by the workers of 
Guantanamo Province to eliminate as quickly as possible the 
consequences of the torrential rains of 1993. He also commented 
on the progress made in implementing guidelines left by a 
Politburo committee during a visit to the province two years 
ago, as well as the progress in reestablishing electric and 
telephone lines. 
  The rebuilding of canefield roads, railway lines, fountains, 
and other socioeconomic works are the result of the intense work 
of the residents of Guantanamo Province, as the ministerial 
committee that visited this province today acknowledged.

example, the number 7-2020 will, as of Friday, become 78-2020. 
This measure is being taken by the telephone company to 
reorganize its boards [pizarras] here in the capital. 
  [Announcer] So, now you know.

  [Text] A lack of ice and refrigeration at the distillery of 
the Jesus Rabi Sugar Mill in Calimete Municipality, Matanzas 
Province, is destabilizing part of the technological process of 
production at that mill. Because of the lack of climate control, 
it is not possible to maintain the stocks necessary to the 
process. This also negatively affects the quality of the 
different kinds of alcohol. Factory technicians say the 
refrigeration problem has been public and under discussion and 
analysis since January, when the work of that (?factory) began. 
  This problem has affected industrial efficiency in 
fermentation as well as the mill's alcohol-producing work group, 
on whom guaranteeing the quality of the product does not depend. 
[sentence as heard] The product is a traditional one that has 
many uses and is also exported.

  [Excerpts] Port-au-Prince, 25 Apr (AFP) -- More than 20 
persons were reportedly shot dead last Friday during a police 
operation in the low-income neighborhood of Raboteau in Gonaives 
(152 km northwest of Port-au-Prince), according to reports 
received by AFP. Three bodies were found last Saturday, and some 
20 others were found on Sunday and Monday morning. 
  The bodies, which were in an advanced state of decomposition 
as they had been in the water and the region's usual heat, were 
buried so the their exact number is difficult to determine. 
  The first account made available on Monday morning by the 
private station Radio Metropole reported that at least four 
persons were killed but added that the number of victims could 
be greater because police were firing on fishing boats. [passage 
omitted] 
  Numerous frightened residents of Raboteau abandoned the 
neighborhood and moved to other parts of the city. So far there 
has been no official confirmation of the incident, the most 
serious to take place in the provinces recently.

  [Text] We have talked about the testimony of a former drug 
dealer who has been questioned by the U.S. Senate and who has 
implicated members of Haiti's military in drug trafficking, 
including the chief of Police. The following is Lieutenant 
Colonel Joseph Michel Francois' defense to those accusations. We 
read: 
  On 28 October 1993, I publicly challenged Father Aristide or 
any of his supporters, foreign or national, to bring just one 
piece of proof of the existence of any link between myself and 
illicit drug trafficking. The allegations of drug dealer Gabriel 
Taboada, in prison for five years now and a witness in the 
service of U.S. agencies, reveal only two things: a blatant lack 
of imagination from the silent partners to this accususation 
which is, according to Beaumarchais, the last resort of cowards. 
Second point: the unbearable thoughtlessness with which the 
Haitian case is being treated in the United States. So far as I 
am concerned, the challenge remains complete. 
  This was a note from Lt. Col. Michel Francois in reaction to 
accusations of drug trafficking.

  [Text] A source close to the Haitian Army denies the 
accusations brought against Haitian Police Chief Lieutenant 
Colonel Joseph Michel Francois. According to the charges, the 
police chief has allegedly supported a lucrative drug trade 
between Colombia and the United States, through Haiti. Gabriel 
Taboana, a former Colombian drug trafficker, asserted before the 
Drug Trafficking and Terrorism Subcommission that he met Michel 
Francois during a meeting with Pablo Escoblar in (?Colombia). 
Former Haitian President Prosper Avril also participated in that 
meeting. 
  The source, who wishes to remain anonymous, pointed out that 
Col. Francois' last trip took place in 1981 before... [pauses] 
after he was commissioned. He went to the United States for 
proficiency courses in security. Since then, he has never gone 
abroad. How can Taboana assert that he met Col. Francois in 
1984, our source wonders. Remember that upon Col. Francois' 
return, he was appointed to the Heavy Vehicles Corps of the 
presidential guard at the National Palace.

  [Text] To respect the Haitian people is to be careful not 
to impose on them what they previously rejected. This is a 
statement by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide who asks the 
Clinton government to respect the wishes of the Haitian people. 
What over 67 percent of the Haitian people are demanding today 
is a total embargo and the return of their president, stated 
Aristide who pointed out that this decision of the people is 
supported by Canada, France, and Venezuela. 
  [Begin Aristide recording] I think Canada, France, and 
Venezuela have done much to support, for instance, our call for 
the application of a total embargo. I have not seen this on the 
part of the United States. I simply wish the United States would 
exhibit a coherent policy, consisting of listening to and 
respecting the voice of the Haitian people, through respect for 
the results of those elections. Today, over 67 percent are 
demanding the return of the president; and a total embargo, but 
not the kind of embargo that is a source of suffering. To 
respect the Haitian people is to agree not to impose what they 
have rejected. We have rejected this kind of embargo by 
requesting a total embargo. May the desires of the Haitian 
people be respected. [end recording] 
  That was President Jean-Bertrand Aristide asking that the 
Haitian people's wishes, expressed through the 16 December 1990 
elections, be respected.

<F P=106> [Article by Ives Marie Chanel: "The Farmers Are Turning Into </F>
`Gas' Vendors"] 
  [Text] We are in Anse-a-Pitres, located some 90 km from the 
southernmost end of the Haitian-Dominican border. To get there, 
one has to cross Haiti's highest mountain range on trails not 
fit for motor vehicles, often less than 3 meters wide and 
occasionally at an altitude of 2,000 meters. 
  After crossing what is left of the Pine Forest and the 
Thiotte area, considered the country's leading coffee-producing 
region, one sees nothing but desolation. The spectacle that 
greets one's eyes is that of a semidesert region whose people 
are wallowing in poverty. Since the UN Security Council 
reimposed the sanctions in November, smuggling and prostitution 
have gained ground. 
  Agriculture, once the peasants' principal or even sole 
source 
of income, is quickly being replaced by oil products. On a strip 
of over 30 km, today's peasants are more concerned about buying 
and reselling "black gold" than they are with working the 
fields. Furthermore, some of them say quite openly that the dam 
on the Pedernales that serves Anse-a-Pitres and the Dominican 
region of the Pedernales is underutilized on the Haitian side. 
  With no management whatsoever, water from the irrigation 
system built over a decade ago by Presidents Duvalier and Blanco 
is unequally distributed and a bag of fertilizer selling for 200 
gourdes is out of reach of small farmers. One is forced to 
conclude that farming in the region today is a rich man's trade. 
  Robert, a 37-year-old farmer lucky enough to attend school 
for four years of his life, attributes this situation to the 
poor crop harvested this year and a tight economic situation 
that has resulted in an excessive rise in the cost of basic 
products. 
  The fuel trade has replaced coffee, for which the last 
spectacular boom in world prices was around 1975. Every day, 
peasants from Bannann, Savane Longue, and Anse-a-Pitres 
transport thousands of liters of fuel from the various supply 
points in the border area by donkey or on their own backs and 
haul it to users in the southeastern and western regions of the 
country, particularly Jacmel and Port-au-Prince. 
  Haitian merchants in Bannann, Boni, and Savane Longue are 
served by Dominican traffickers. Haitians cross the border with 
no problem and get their supply from Kiki, Carlo, or Selom, all 
Dominicans who in recent years have officially set themselves up 
as livestock breeders in this very isolated mountainous region. 
  According to the Haitian peasants, however, the truth is a 
different matter. In actual fact, these Dominican "livestock 
breeders" are nothing but traffickers who have been smuggling 
sugar over the border since about 1985. As in the case of the 
Haitians from Bannann, fuel has now taken the place of sugar for 
these Dominican "business tycoons" from the "Banano" region. 
Kiki, Selom, and Carlo require advance payment from the Hatians 
on fuel purchases, yet they have not yet delivered fuel paid for 
in January. 
  In Anse-a-Pitres, smuggling and the "fuel market" have 
expanded considerably. An average of 5,000 gallons of gasoline 
and diesel fuel cross the border daily, although this commune of 
over 13,000 inhabitants does not even have three vehicles! There 
are depots all over the place, a disaster waiting to happen. Oil 
products are stored in summary dwellings usually built of wood. 
Already in early March, two homes were ravaged by a fire caused 
by improper fuel handling. In the daytime, Haitians and 
Dominicans transport a limited number of fuel containers by 
sailboat or on foot. 
  It is said that surveillance is strict, but by nightfall 
Dominican soldiers close their eyes and allow products to get 
through in exchange for a cut of 3 pesos (3.6 gourds) a gallon. 
Deals are made "in the field" in Haitian territory. At this spot 
located less than 2 km from the border, Haitian buyers, looking 
for all the world like lovers on their way to moonlit evening 
trysts, stand by their containers waiting for Dominican vendors! 
All night long, dozens of Dominican traffickers from Pedernales 
come on foot to unload their supply. At the same time, Haitian 
sailboats transfer their fuel from Dominican boats anchored in 
the open sea. 
  In Anse-a-Pitres, business is done in pesos. In recent 
weeks, 
Dominican currency has clearly risen in value compared with the 
Haitian gourde. The rate of exchange has stabilized at 23-24 
percent, but the money changers up their rates when they see 
trucks or boats from the capital or chief regional towns. Local 
suppliers of oil products react similarly upon seeing these 
new-type visitors. 
  The Dominican traffickers have also learned to calculate, 
which they demonstrated clearly by deciding on 19 March to stage 
a strike. Saturday evening, the Haitians futilely protested the 
unilateral decision, and the pitch was raised a tone by the 
leaders of the movement and a handful of traffickers who managed 
to get through the line to market their products despite the 
strikers' ban. 
  Armed with sticks and machetes, the Dominican leaders forced 
the latter to retreat or sell their products at the price set 
for a Haitian buyer who had deserted his camp. According to one 
Dominican leader on hand this Saturday evening, the purpose of 
the movement was to raise the selling price of oil products. 
  The Dominicans claim that a gallon of gasoline going for 35 
pesos (42 gourdes) just before the protest movement should cost 
45 or 50 (54 or 60 gourdes), while diesel fuel should be sold 
for between 35 and 40 pesos. 
  Dominican smugglers justify their demands by the fact that 
their profit margin on a gallon of fuel is insignificant because 
of deductions made by truckers and Dominican soldiers who are 
among the prime middlemen and/or beneficiaries of the market. 
Because of the official ban placed on the sale of oil products 
in containers by the Balaguer Government, small-time Dominican 
traffickers are forced to pay truckers 27 pesos for a gallon of 
gasoline that costs 20 at the pump, they say. 
  The movement, initiated by the Dominicans, seemed to be 
succeeding by Sunday morning and had a significant impact on the 
prices paid for oil products in Anse-a-Pitres, considered the 
main supplier for southeastern Haiti. Boats from Jacmel and 
Marigot spent hours waiting on Sunday before giving up at noon 
without ever getting their supply. And yet, they have little 
choice since waiting is profitable. Once the pie has been split 
between border runners, soldiers (100 gourdes/drum as the fee 
between boats), haulers (100 gourdes from Pedernales to 
Anse-a-Pitres and 520/drum to the capital), the merchants still 
make a 100-percent profit! 
  "We have lost everything. The crop was bad and `gas' is our 
only sure source of income. But after the embargo is lifted, the 
people who do not own land or livestock will definitely have no 
way to make it," said the farmer who acted as our guide. When 
asked about a possible date on which the embargo would be 
lifted, Boyer, a young farmer called intelligent by travelers 
from Port-au-Prince, left it up to God: "God only knows (...); 
the people say it will be in two years," he said mischievously.

  [Text] The SCD-1 (Data-Gathering Satellite), the first 
Brazilian satellite made with national technology by experts 
from the National Institute of Space Research (INPE) in Sao Jose 
dos Campos, Sao Paulo, has caused a more-than-agreeable 
surprise. Launched in Cape Canaveral, United States, on 9 
February 1993, the satellite should have had a one-year useful 
life. But inexplicably, it continues sending meteorological data 
to the INPE, which expects the SCD-1 to have another year of 
useful life. 
  "We are agreeably surprised," said INPE acting director 
Volker Kirchhoff when he reported the accomplishment of the 
SCD-1, which opens the way for the launching of the SCD-2 in 
1995 and, in the future, the SCD-3, which is a communications 
satellite approved by the Brazilian Commission for Space 
Activities (Cobae). The SCD-1 has transmitted reliable 
environmental data on the Amazon region, allowing INPE experts 
to develop meteorological works on the region. 
  Ever since it was launched a year and two months ago, the 
SCD-1 has transmitted daily to the INPE station in Cuiaba, Mato 
Grosso, environmental data being monitored in Cachoeira 
Paulista, Sao Paulo. The first Brazilian satellite is in orbit 
700 kms above the earth and gathers information on atmospheric 
pollution by carbon monoxide and the destruction of the ozone 
layer by CFC gases, besides monitoring the direction and 
intensity of climatic phenomena and the air's relative humidity. 
  The SCD-1's importance is that it adds environmental data to 
that provided by the U.S. Landsat and Nooa-11 satellites, which 
monitor burning lands in the Amazon region, the Achilles heel of 
Brazilian environmental policy. "Our expectation is that the 
SCD-1 will last one more year," Volker Kirchhoff said, recalling 
that the success of the first completely national satellite 
opens the skies for the Brazilian Space Program.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Tomas A. Granados: "Another Wall </F>
Shows Its Cracks"] 
  [Text] Havana [dateline as received] -- After leaving Cuba 
tired of economic difficulties or moving because of ideological 
discrepancies, or even for the sheer adventure of it, thousands 
of Cubans who migrated to the United States, Spain, and other 
countries have agreed to a movement effort, to be carried out 
this month, that will attempt to reach an agreement with 
authorities in Havana. 
  Almost all of them have a common idea. "We are not people 
who want Cuba's destruction," asserted Caridad More Zulueta, who 
says she left for Miami in 1980 to ease her many problems 
prompted by the domestic difficulties she had to confront every 
day. 
  "I say that many of us who left Cuba in the past 30 years 
did 
so more for domestic than for political problems," according to 
Caridad, usually called "Cachita," who is the president of the 
Afro-Cuban Cultural Rescue Group (REWACO) [Grupo de Rescate 
Cultural Afrocubano] in Miami. 
  Not only those who attribute their decision to emigrate to 
economic reasons, however, have agreed to travel to Havana this 
month and discuss the measures that could be adopted to 
regularize their ties with the country, institutions, and 
relatives with Cuban authorities. 
  On the list of approximately 200 guests to the conference on 
the nation and emigration, scheduled to be held 22-24 April, 
there are also veterans of the mercenary brigade that the United 
States launched unsuccessfully against Cuba in 1961, 
conspirators who tried to toppled Fidel Castro's government, and 
individuals who maintain an aggressive hostility toward the 
Cuban revolution in the past. 
  They are the visible cracks in another wall that is about to 
fall. Many of those people, who show clear ideological 
differences with the Cuban Government, have decided to distance 
themselves from the extremist groups that favor the U.S. policy 
of asphyxiating Cuba with an economic blockade and other 
interventionist practices that could lead the island to a 
holocaust. 
  "Even if we do not like it, Cuba has created a totally 
different society. A sudden change in that society, as the 
ignorant people in Miami dream, would be catastrophic," says 
Luis Ortega, an old Cuban journalist who resides in the United 
States and is known for his lack of affection for the government 
in Havana. 
  According to some Cuban analysts, this conference could open 
the door to some progress in normalizing relations with a wide 
sector of the emigrants who did not renounce their links to the 
country, or conditioned it to some type of personal political 
aspirations or group interest. 
  The spectrum determining an invitation to the conference has 
been well defined. The participants invited will consist only 
of those groups interested in solving issues related to 
emigration, the country's social situation, and opposed to the 
U.S. economic blockade against Cuba. In addition, invitations 
will also be determined by these groups' decision not to attach 
any conditions which may decide their participation. 
  According to Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's explanation 
to the media, those groups at either end of this spectrum are 
excluded because they have imprinted a "service record linked 
very closely to those who permanently question our existence as 
a nation." 
  In reference to the subject of invitations to the meeting, 
Robaina dismissed the participation of Miami extremist groups 
which he described as "hysterical." Among these he mentioned the 
Cuban-American Foundation, which has been classified as an 
opposition group lacking any credibility since "deep down it is 
not genuine, but orchestrated by the United States." 
  Nevertheless, according to an early April confirmation by a 
Foreign Ministry official, invitations have been extended to 
representatives of organizations who do not sympathize with the 
Cuban Government, such as Cuban Change and the Cuban Committee 
for Democracy. 
  Maybe it has been the time element, frustration brought on 
by 
unsuccessful efforts, or simple nostalgia of being far away from 
"what belongs to one" which has prompted some of these groups to 
overcome long-lasting hatred as well as hostilities and cross 
over to the side of the moderate Cuban emigrants in the United 
States. This has been done even at the risk of being branded as 
"traitors" by their rivals in the more extremist groups. 
  At any rate, the emigrant representatives have responded 
immediately to their attacks. "Traitors are not those who go to 
Cuba to observe and to listen... traitors are those who spend 
their time demanding Washington tighten the embargo to cause the 
people of Cuba to rise up against Castro in desperation. "That 
is a crime," says Ortega. 
  According to Foreign Relations Vice Minister Jorge Bolanos, 
this conference, which is perceived as the second chapter of a 
dialogue held for the first time in 1978 between Cuban officials 
and representatives of the emigrants, will precipitate a process 
headed toward normalizing relations between those Cubans living 
overseas and the country's authorities. 
  The normalization process can be complex, however. The 
conference responds to a consensus that intertwines approval 
from a majority sector of the Cuban population, and doubts by 
some people here who, as a result of old wounds, distrust, and a 
lack of understanding, still perceive the emigrants as a symbol 
of counterrevolution. 
  In Havana, an official spokesman recently commented that 
there are some individuals still connected to radical sectors of 
the Cuban emigrants in the United States who are equally opposed 
to the dialogue and an understanding because "of their sick 
aversion to the word normalized as it relates to Cuba and the 
county's future." 
  According to some of the leaders of the groups invited to 
the 
conference, one of the issues that can attract attention to the 
debate is the one related to regulations blocking an increase in 
visits by the emigrants to their country of origin. 
  "The blockade should not extend within one's country," 
states 
Gilberto Solis, president of the Cuban-American Professionals 
and Entrepreneurs (PECA), one of the emigrant groups invited to 
the conference. 
  Solis and other moderate leaders of the emigrant community 
insist on the double nationality issue, yet Cuban officials have 
explained that the issue is related to what's established in the 
Constitution and that any modification must be proposed by the 
National Assembly of the People's Government (Parliament) and 
approved in a plebiscite. 
  At any rate, Vice Minister Bolanos recently disclosed that 
the authorities will bring up their proposals and other issues 
during the conference. "All issues will be open to discussions 
during the conference sessions," he added. 
  To the Cuban authorities, the invitation to this conference 
is an opportunity for Cuban residents overseas to present their 
"legitimate concerns and aspirations" to the country in good 
faith. 
  At the same time, the Cuban authorities point out that 
"there 
is no possibility for political manipulation or opportunities to 
intervene in affairs which, due to their very nature, only 
concern those who live, work and struggle in Cuba."

<F P=106> [By Zenaida Ferrer] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- Vilma Espin, president of the 
Cuban Women's Federation [FMC], stated, in an exclusive 
interview by PRENSA LATINA, that by meeting in Havana, the Cuban 
emigrants in [words indistinct] countries are seeking harmonious 
relations with the fatherland. 
  The ones who are coming want positive ties with Cuba. They 
have started by feeling the need to defend their land, families, 
and fellow citizens and by expressing their opposition to the 
U.S. economic, commercial, and financial blockade against Cuba, 
Espin stated. She added that interesting and constructive 
proposals could result from this meeting. 
  The head of the FMC, which comprises approximately 3.81 
million women over the age of 14, referred to the unequal 
characteristics of Cuban emigrants, not only since the 
revolutionary victory in 1959, but also during the past century, 
and even during the bloodiest phase of Fulgencio Batista's 
dictatorship. 
  She said that during the 1950's, a large number of Cuban 
emigrants in several countries in this continent and even in 
other parts of the world, received our then-young 
revolutionaries, Fidel Castro among them, and expressed their 
solidarity and support as fellow citizens. 
  Espin added, among the current emigrants, there are those 
who 
left because they felt cheated by the measures adopted at the 
initiation of the current system (nationalization of factories, 
organizations, properties); others who left the country totally 
confused; and those who left for economic reasons, the reasons 
for most of those who have left in the past decade. 
  Espina observed, however, that even if other categories can 
be included in the exodus of the past four decades, not all are 
against Cuba and some even agree with the revolution and its 
leaders. 
  According to the FMC president, the meeting also has special 
importance because it addresses issues basic to the FMC, such as 
the need to give priority attention to children and the family. 
  Cuban women currently represent 40 percent of the active 
labor force, 61 percent of mid- and upper-level technicians, 40 
percent of investigators, and more than half of family 
physicians (health program that gives personalized family 
attention in each territory).

<F P=106> [By Raimundo Lopez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- The majority of the 
Conference on the Nation and Emigration guests will arrive on 21 
April from Miami less than 24 hours before the start of the 
meeting that seeks to normalize the country's relations with 
Cubans residing abroad. 
  Organizing commission sources confirmed to PRENSA LATINA 
that 
more than 100 people will join about 50 others who are already 
in the capital and have been receiving their credentials since 
yesterday. It was reported that about 200 guests from more than 
40 countries will participate in a personal capacity in the 
meeting that will run from Friday to Sunday afternoon. 
  Official reports show that the common denominator of the 
participants is their opposition to the U.S.-imposed blockade on 
the island, although many of them do not share the ideology of 
social justice developed here since 1959. The broad acceptance 
of the conference among emigrants contrasts with an intimidation 
campaign, launched mainly in Miami where most Cuban emigrants 
live, against those who agreed to participate in the meeting. 
  Raymundo del Toro, one of the participants and chairman of 
New Jersey's Cuban-American Committee for Peace, announced here 
that he received death threats from the Alpha 66 terrorist 
organization headquartered in Miami. 
  I am not afraid of them because they are a small group of 
frustrated and old-fashioned people, del Toro told the local 
media. 
  Meanwhile, Mari-Tere Vishop, propaganda secretary of an 
organization called Cuban Committee for Democracy, headquartered 
in the United States, said that things have changed within the 
Cuban community in that nation. 
  Cuban emigrants are increasingly less afraid of the 
aggressiveness displayed by quarters that oppose the 
normalization of their relations with the island, she added 
during an interview with PRENSA LATINA. 
  Del Toro and Vishop reaffirmed their rejection of the siege 
imposed by successive U.S. administrations for over three 
decades and condemned their attempt to suffocate the country. 
  Del Toro added that all Cubans who wish to do so can unite 
to 
struggle for the country and that he thinks that this is among 
the main merits of the upcoming conference. 
  I feel optimistic because sectors that oppose this 
normalization are losing ground, Vishop added.

  [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- Cuban emigrants today 
expressed their confidence in the success of the process that 
has just began, which seeks to normalize their relations with 
the island. The group is currently in Havana to attend a 
conference organized by the Foreign Ministry. 
  Luis Mendez, an investor living in New York, told PRENSA 
LATINA that rejection of U.S. policy toward Cuba and support for 
the conference continue to grow within the Cuban community 
living abroad. This is a growing movement, even among those who 
would never have spoken of any sort of change in relations with 
the country two years ago. 
  Mendez left Cuba almost 30 years ago. He said a positive 
result from this conference could lead to more talks with Cubans 
living abroad. He added that it could also influence the 
evolution of future relations with Washington. 
  The investor contended that many U.S. firms are interested 
in 
investing in Cuba, but the current restrictions set up by the 
blockade disallow such activity. 
  He condemned the fact that after signing a letter of intent 
he was not allowed to transfer funds to the Caribbean island. 
The money was destined for family relief, but the U.S. 
Government did not give its approval. 
  Mariana Gaston, a member of the Antonio Maceo Brigade in New 
York, also believed the meeting to be a first step toward 
continued conversations. Gaston was also a participant in the 
talks held between Cuban emigrants and the government in 1978. 
  She highlighted the government's interest in seeking the 
historically significant normalization of ties with the Cuban 
community abroad that might resolve the worries or needs of that 
portion of the Cuban family. 
  She pointed out the improved facilities for travelling to 
the 
island for family reunification, the solution of communication 
problems, and the improvement of migratory regulations in 
general as examples of that intention. 
  She added that some of those living abroad try to mobilize 
the sometimes intimidated voices of those who want normal 
relations, despite the threats of terrorism. 
  Such mobilization must have an impact on the U.S. 
Government, 
she concluded, from the President to Congress to local 
authorities, demanding that the United States change its 
outdated policy toward Cuba. 
  Vicente Dopico, another emigrant and a member of the Cuban 
Change organization in the United States, said the very fact 
that Cuba has called the meeting, which begins tomorrow, proves 
the Cuban Government's intentions regarding its relations with 
the emigrant community. I believe the meeting will have positive 
results, although we all realize that some things may not be 
attained immediately, he explained. 
  Dopico affirmed that the conference in Havana and the 
presence of groups within the United States that defend this 
type of relationship between the two parties, demonstrates the 
possibility of a future. 
  This future means the normalization of a nation with more 
than 1 million of its citizens living abroad. This feeling is 
always growing among those who agree with the need to establish 
a stable bond and a relationship of mutual respect for the good 
of the country, he concluded.

  [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- Most of the emigrants invited 
to the Nation and the Emigrants Conference that begins here 
tomorrow agree on the need not only to normalize ties with their 
country of origin, but also to systematize them. 
  For journalist Nicolas Rios, director of the Miami-based 
CONTRAPUNTO magazine, this meeting attended exclusively by 
Cubans "must contribute to helping us overcome the artificial 
separation originated years ago between those who left and those 
who stayed." 
  According to Rios, at this moment there are conditions for a 
"reunion" because, among other things, there is the intention on 
both sides to institutionalize this relationship and make it 
last. 
  The historical confrontation between Cuba and the United 
States has always affected Cuba's relations with its emigrants, 
but we must overcome this factor, because by doing so, in the 
long run, we ourselves will influence those ties, Rios added in 
an interview with PRENSA LATINA. 
  Amalio Fiallo, president of the Venezuela-based Center for 
the Promotion of Man, commented the single fact of being able to 
talk and to talk without intermediaries represents a step 
forward. He added, however, that within a timeframe of just 
three days (the duration of the conference), it will be 
difficult to discuss everything as we should. 
  According to Fiallo, the meeting is also possible because 
the 
Cuban community abroad has changed. He added that today "we are 
not all alike, nor do we think the same, although there is a 
minority who controls the media and continues to work for the 
government in Washington." 
  Fiallo contended that the meeting is only the beginning of a 
process to normalize ties, and it must not be left incomplete 
because "as part of a single people" we must think about what 
all Cubans are doing today to strengthen the nation. 
  Fiallo, who said he is attending the meeting on his own 
behalf and not representing any group, stressed that any topic 
is open to discussion because, despite differences of opinions, 
there is on both sides an atmosphere of respect and a lack of 
hostility. 
  Fiallo, who has recently come to Cuba to explain his plan 
for 
participative democracy, stated the government knows what he 
thinks and has never asked or suggested that he "burn what you 
have written, renounce your past, or kneel down at the Plaza de 
la Revolucion and proclaim that you were wrong." 
  Meanwhile, Francisco Aruca, director of Miami-based Progreso 
Alternativa radio station, also told PRENSA LATINA that the 
conference is the first step toward preparing a coherent policy 
with regard to Cubans living abroad, and particularly those 
living in the United States. Aruca said an important achievement 
of this meeting could be the creation of a department 
responsible for dealing with the affairs of the community. 
  According to Aruca, Cuban residents in other countries have 
a 
wide variety of aspirations, including the possibility of 
investing on equal footing as foreigners. Nevertheless, such 
goals, as well as others, cannot be achieved because of 
restrictions of the North American blockade. 
  Juan Manuel Rodriguez, a participant in the 1978 dialogue 
and 
a former member of the Revolutionary Army, said he will attend 
the meeting to address the needs of emigrants in the areas of 
economics and culture, but not to discuss Cuba's domestic 
problems because "these must be resolved by those who are here." 
  More than 200 Cubans personally invited by the government of 
the island will participate in the Nation and the Emigrants 
Conference that begins tomorrow and runs until Sunday. 
  The participants have expressed their differences with the 
social system that exists in the Caribbean nation, but at the 
same time they agree in their opposition to the blockade that 
has been imposed for more than 30 years against Cuba.

<F P=106> [Report by Javier Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- An impressive contingent of 
Cuban emigrants, who defend the normalization of their relations 
with the island, arrived in Havana today. They voiced 
expressions of enthusiasm and expectation for the congress, 
which begins tomorrow. 
  The newly arrived travelers made the trip despite threats 
and 
insults from the most conservative sectors entrenched in this 
U.S. city [city not specified], who failed in their attempts to 
prevent the emigrants from attending the meeting. 
  "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference, convened by the 
Cuban Foreign Ministry, seeks to begin the process of addressing 
the concerns and requests of Cubans who live overseas and to 
consolidate the ties that unite them to their country of origin. 
  To this end, approximately 200 emigrants were invited to 
participate in the event. Reality seems to indicate that this 
number will be surpassed, as dozens of them arrived from other 
countries, ahead of the large group that was welcomed today and 
those who are expected tomorrow. 
  The hotel lobby became the setting for the first meetings, 
conversations, and greetings. All this occurred amid the 
urgency of the many reporters and the lights of several foreign 
television cameras, as they all tried to capture the first 
statements of the newly arrived home comers. 
  Those who accepted the invitation represent a broad spectrum 
of opinions and ideologies that characterize the Cuban emigrant 
community. In general, their impressions about the conference, 
scheduled to conclude Sunday, were marked by expressions of 
certainty about the positive results the meeting will have. 
  Another point of concurrence, with which even those who do 
not accept the island's political process agree, is the 
condemnation of the U.S. trade embargo against the Caribbean 
nation and the call for changes in U.S. policy toward the island. 
  Journalists Luis Ortega and Marcos Castellon; Luis Torres, a 
participant in the failed invasion at Playa Giron [Bay of Pigs] 
in 1961; Maritere Vishop of the Cuban Change organization; 
Andres Gomez, the director of the AREITO magazine; and Xiomara 
Almaguer-Levy, of the Jewish Solidarity [previous two words in 
English] group, arrived with the first contingent. 
  Castellon told PRENSA LATINA how radio stations controlled 
by 
the most radical enemies of the Cuban Government broadcast false 
information about the situation on the island, just hours before 
they took off. 
  Torres gave a similar report, adding that the leaders of the 
groups that oppose the conference made numerous threats against 
those who accepted the invitation from Havana. They united in 
spreading false rumors, which were swiftly denied by the truth. 
  Both individuals concurred in stating that events such as 
those only demonstrate desperation, before the support for the 
idea of defending the rights of the emigrants to normalize their 
relations with the Cuban State has rallied. 
  The conference begins tomorrow with the special 
participation 
of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, who will discuss official 
migration policy.

  [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- Today, Cubans living on and 
off the island agreed here in saying that their country's main 
problem does not reside in differences among the Cubans but in 
the hostility the United States has continually demonstrated 
toward Cuba. 
  This coinciding opinion was reported by Havana City 
historian 
Eusebio Leal when he spoke at a public ceremony in Havana's Cayo 
Hueso neighborhood where a plaque honoring Cuban emigrants who 
promoted the reencounter with the fatherland was unveiled. 
  This activity, a preamble to "The Nation and the Emigrants" 
conference convoked by the Cuban Foreign Ministry for 22-24 
April, was presided over by Jose Ramon Balaguer, member of the 
Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba, Havana City Mayor 
Pedro Chavez, and other prominent government officials. 
  Scores of Cubans who live in several countries and who were 
invited to the forum that will begin tomorrow in Havana's 
Conventions Palace attended the ceremony alongside local 
residents. 
  Leal, who is also a parliamentary deputy, said: "Let us not 
be confused or forget what is essential: The main issue is not 
among Cubans. The main issue, and we must realize this, is the 
ongoing, stubborn, and tenacious position the great North 
American nation maintains toward Cuba's right to exist and to 
prevail." 
  The Cuban emigrants on several occasions shouted slogans 
condemning the ongoing economic blockade imposed by Washington 
on the island more than three decades ago. 
  The plaque, placed in the popular Trillo Park, is in 
remembrance of emigrants Carlos Muniz Varela (1953-79), Eulalio 
Jose Negrin (1941-79), Lourdes Casals Valdes (1938-81), 
Margarita Lejarza Vazquez (1950-85), Mauricio Miguel Gaston 
Roche (1947-86), Manuel Antonio de Dios Unanue (1943-92), and 
Eusebio Valdes Muno (1916-94). 
  The memorial, Leal said, focuses on various outstanding 
efforts and events that are part of a yet-to-be-written Cuban 
history, a history in which the Cubans in and out of Cuba, the 
ones who live and those who are absent, are participants. 
  He recalled the talks that began between the emigrants and 
the government in 1978 and noted that if the conference 
signifies "the right of Cubans to understand one another, to 
correspond with one another, to visit the tombs of their dead, 
to go anywhere in the world, and to exchange the common treasure 
of the same culture and the same language, it is welcome." 
  "It is very important that," he noted, "when time 
accumulates so many differences, so many different viewpoints, 
we have started with something very important, such as seeking a 
term that will reflect the truth of the Cuban situation, so that 
it will be more human, so that it will correspond more to our 
history and that adequate term is emigration. 
  The Cayo Hueso neighborhood was founded by emigrants of the 
keys, similarly named in the United States, who as a result of a 
terrible fire (an epilogue to the war to which they contributed 
their greatest sacrifice) which devoured their riches, were 
obliged to return, the city historian recalled. That is why this 
memorial has been unveiled here because it is not an uninhabited 
place of Havana and is very meaningful, he said.

  [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- Approximately 160 members of 
the Cuban community living in the United States arrived today in 
Havana for the Nation and the Emigrants Conference to which they 
were invited. The conference will begin tomorrow and last until 
Sunday in the Convention Palace in Havana. 
  The group traveled by charter flight directly from Miami and 
immediately went to the Comodoro Hotel, on Havana's west coast, 
where they will be lodged and where the accreditation offices 
are. 
  Organizing commission sources told PRENSA LATINA that the 
recent arrivals will join the approximately 100 people already 
registered to take part in the meeting. 
  Even though the official list of participants has not yet 
been published, the sources said it includes former politicians, 
businessmen, journalists, intellectuals, and leaders of Cuban 
organizations who live in more than 40 countries. 
  The invitations were individually addressed and were 
distributed by local authorities, who took into account the 
views of the country's social and mass organizations, according 
to official reports. 
  The conference was summoned by Foreign Relations Minister 
Roberto Robaina on 14 February. One of its purposes is to 
"examine measures for normalization of emigrant links with the 
Cuban nation, Cuban institutions, and Cuban families." 
  The conference is an opportunity for Cubans living abroad to 
present, in good faith, their legitimate wishes and concerns, 
Robaina said. Nevertheless, he said there would be no 
"possibility for political manipulations or opportunities for 
those who wish to intervene in affairs that are the sole concern 
of those who live, work, and struggle in the fatherland." 
  Unofficial reports state the meeting will be inaugurated 
tomorrow with a special intervention by Robaina himself. Other 
important officials, including Ricardo Alarcon, parliament 
president; Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of State; 
and Abel Prieto, president of the Union of Writers and Artists, 
will brief participants on topics crucial to life in Cuba. The 
closing ceremony is expected on Sunday afternoon, when the 
conference results will be made public.

  [Text] Havana, 22 Apr (PL) -- Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina said today the first fruit of The Nation and the 
Emigrants conference is that it is taking place and that there 
is the possibility of continued efforts for the normalization of 
ties between Cuba and residents abroad. 
  Robaina dedicated the event at Havana Convention Palace with 
a 10-minute speech to 204 Cuban citizens who live in 27 
countries and who were invited on a personal basis to 
participate in the meeting, which will last until Sunday. 
  He said: We must collectively establish the areas in which 
we, with everyone's participation, may make progress toward the 
establishing of the normal relations to which we are entitled. 
  Robaina said one of the objectives of the meeting is "to 
examine what measures can be adopted to normalize ties between 
the emigrants and the country, institutions, and families." 
Another goal, he said, is to encourage stable relations and 
exchanges in the family, cultural, and social realms. 
  He noted that efforts are being made "to encourage 
constructive actions by residents abroad considering that in the 
current historic situation, the future of the nation and the 
safeguarding of its sovereignty, independence, and achievements 
represent a common motive for all Cubans of goodwill." 
  Robaina said the meeting is being attended by the most 
diverse political and ideological currents, "something that does 
not block the willingness to work for the objective that brought 
us together." 
  The minister explained that the participants include 
professionals, artists, housewives, retired persons, workers, 
businessmen, religious persons, and social and student leaders 
who love and are identified with the fatherland. 
  He said their participation in the conference "represents 
acknowledgment for our government's courageous decision to 
convoke this meeting in the midst of the unpostponable tasks the 
nation is tackling." 
  The foreign minister said the meeting is not the result of 
either a miracle or an accident, but, especially, of the 
maturity, strength, and independence of Cuba and of "a growing 
attitude of respect and understanding in a considerable number 
of emigrants who increasingly identify themselves with the 
fundamental interests of the nation." 
  In his brief speech, which was greatly applauded by the 
participants, Robaina recalled that the meeting is taking place 
in spite of the hostile U.S. policy toward Cuba that so far has 
served as a framework for the development of relations between 
the island and its emigrants. 
  The conference was called on 14 February by Robaina. This is 
the second effort made in this direction after the dialogue held 
in this capital in 1978. Robaina said the first fruit of this 
new meeting is precisely the fact that it has taken place and 
the possibilities it has opened for a continuation on the road 
to the normalization of ties between the nation and its 
residents abroad. 
  He said: Respect and intelligence in discussing each of the 
issues that concern us in the relations between the nation and 
its emigrants is what must characterize our current dialogue and 
serve as the premise for the future. 
  Following the dedication, the first working session began at 
noon behind closed doors. Robaina will speak about Cuba's 
emigration policy, sources close to the meeting have reported. 
  The meeting will last until Sunday. The president of the 
Cuban Parliament, Ricardo Alarcon; Council of State Vice 
President Carlos Lage; and Abel Prieto, president of the 
National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists will also 
participate in the meeting. They will discuss issues concerning 
the country's life.

  [Text] Havana, 22 Apr (PL) -- Cuban parliament President 
Ricardo Alarcon has described changes in the country's state 
organizations that were announced today as "measures to revive 
the economy without adopting neoliberal models that would hurt 
countless workers." 
  In statements to the media during a recess at the Nation and 
the Emigrants Conference, which started this morning, Alarcon 
noted that such changes had been discussed for some time, and he 
added that they are designed to adjust the structure of the 
island's central government to the current situation. 
  He stressed that the idea is to do at the government level 
what the people have already been doing to reduce expenses, to 
rationalize by way of austerity, and to make the best use of 
resources. "We cannot, however, throw anyone into the streets," 
he stressed. 
  "The idea is to simplify structures and, in turn, reduce 
excess payrolls without affecting workers," Alarcon said. He 
added that this is precisely what makes Cuba's situation 
complex. There is a need to overcome this difficult phase, to 
clean up the nation's finances, and to revive the economy 
without adopting capitalist models. 
  In the United States, for example, there are a lot of 
unemployed people in the streets looking for jobs, medical 
attention, and something to eat, although that country is not 
facing a blockade and a special period (the name given here to 
the years of economic crisis), "but this is not and will never 
be the case in Cuba," Alarcon added. 
  Today, the Cuban Government announced the creation of a new 
structure that eliminates several ministries and central 
government organizations and creates new ones, such as the 
Ministries of the Economy, Foreign Investment, and Tourism. 
  Decree-Law No. 147, which was issued by the Cuban State 
Council and was published in GRANMA, explains that the goal is 
to reduce the size and adjust the duties of the government 
apparatus through measures already under way to confront the 
crisis prompted by the disappearance of the socialist bloc. 
  Alarcon added that the decree is designed to better adjust 
the government structure in accordance with the trade relations 
and cooperation the island is developing within today's 
international situation.

  [Text] Havana, 22 Apr (PL) -- Today, National Assembly 
President Ricardo Alarcon rejected the implementation of a 
multiparty system in Cuba by saying he considered it detrimental 
to national unity in the face of the historical U.S. hostility 
toward the island. 
  The legislative leader explained the Cuban Government's 
position during the first session of the The Nation and the 
Emigrants Conference, which began this morning with the 
participation of 210 Cubans living in 27 countries. 
  Miguel Alfonso, spokesperson for the three-day event, the 
proceedings of which will be private, noted that Alarcon 
described the idea that a society must have a multiparty system 
to be democratic as a myth. He said the multiparty system 
divides people into groups separated by interests that are not 
necessarily those of the nation. 
  Regarding Cuba, the single party is not a creation of the 
revolution (begun in 1959) but has its roots in the turn of the 
last century, when Jose Marti began our struggle for 
independence, Alfonso stated. 
  He explained that in Cuba's special case, when we have a 
powerful nation so close to our coasts that has never renounced 
its intent to take over the island, anything that could 
undermine national unity must be carefully studied. 
  The president of the National Assembly of the People's Power 
[ANPP] was the first important Cuban leader to speak at the 
event, the fundamental objective of which is to promote the 
normalization of ties between emigrants and their country. 
  In his speech, the text of which was distributed by 
organizers of the event, Alarcon explained the real 
participatory nature of the county's existing democratic system. 
  This is the essence of our system of the people's power: the 
real connection between the persons chosen by the electors and 
the real, effective, and systematic participation of the people 
in all the activities of their government system, he noted. 
  He noted that such principles were demonstrated again in the 
past few months while the people were discussing measures to 
improve the country's internal financial situation, basically 
imbalanced by an excess of money in circulation equivalent to 14 
paychecks [salarios], over 11 billion pesos (equal to U.S. 
dollars at the official exchange rate). He stated that millions 
of people participated in the process, exercising the authority 
of the people and direct democracy. 
  Alarcon said the dreams of social equality that have existed 
since the age of the forefathers of independence of the last 
century still exist today. The ideals of equality and solidarity 
are based on humanism, on the humanist tradition of our culture. 
Such ideals were born with Cubans as part of their nationality, 
he stated. 
  For Cubans to renounce them, he said, would be more than 
renouncing a just, noble society worth any sacrifice. It would 
be renouncing their own identity; it would be renouncing being 
Cuban. 
  The National Assembly president said that despite the 
adverse 
economic situation in Cuba, no school or hospital has been 
closed and no citizen has been evicted. 
  He said that during one of the assemblies held to analyze 
solutions to national problems, one of the peasants asked him to 
tell the conference participants that they would never agree to 
returning to the past of poverty and sickness that existed 
before 1959. 
  I know that I express the feelings of millions of Cubans 
when 
I say that we will be able to resist and that we will know how 
to resist, that we will defend the right to dream and will 
defend the dreams that we have made a reality with so much love 
and sacrifice.

  [Text] Havana, 22 Apr (PL) -- During the meeting that began 
today in this capital, Cuban emigrants discussed the possibility 
of maintaining their national identity despite living abroad and 
their interest in participating in the country's future. 
  Miguel Alfonso, official spokesman of the "The Nation and 
the 
Emigrants" Conference convened by the Foreign Ministry, said the 
first working session of that meeting resulted in a rich 
exchange of opinions following the special speech by National 
Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon. 
  The basic proposals of over 200 emigrants attending the 
meeting included the need to definitively end the U.S. blockade 
against the island, as well as what they called the "legal 
limbo" in which some emigrants find themselves regarding 
citizenship. 
  The visitors voiced their concern that the community 
residing 
abroad could become some sort of hostage in the existing dispute 
between Cuba and the United States. They also expressed 
interest in the details of measures that may be adopted by the 
National Assembly in the next special session. 
  The legislative body was convened for 1 May, culminating an 
analysis of the country's financial situation that extended down 
to the rank and file with the holding of the so-called worker's 
parliaments held in over 80,000 work centers. 
  According to Alfonso, another issue about which participants 
requested information was the potential for the emergence in 
Cuban society of corruption following certain changes made in 
light of the country's complex economic situation. 
  The emigrants expressed their desire to contribute as much 
as 
possible toward solving transitory economic situations in the 
country as well as in developing the democratic system.. 
  Responding to questions from the plenum, Alarcon highlighted 
the risks of introducing an element of division in the nation 
with the possible introduction of a multiparty system and 
stressed his support for the single party system in accordance 
with the current situation. 
  Regarding the issue of citizenship, the conference spokesman 
explained that Alarcon briefed participants about the 
Complementary Law, currently under review, and its possible 
discussion at the Assembly in a relatively short time. 
  The National Assembly president also offered a broad 
explanation about the existing legislation to participate in the 
Cuban electoral process, which requires one to live in the 
country for the last two years in order to vote, run for office, 
or be elected representative. 
  Alfonso noted the atmosphere of mutual respect at the 
meeting 
and the interest of emigrants in the future of their country, 
which was demonstrated by the participants' words of patriotism. 
  With the arrival of new guests, the number of participants 
rose to 210, 156 of which came from the United States and the 
other 54 from other countries. 
  After the debate, Abel Preto, president of the Union of 
Writers and Artists, gave a speech entitled "Culture, Cubanhood, 
and Cubanism," which was followed by a question period and an 
exchange of opinions. 
  Tomorrow morning, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina will 
speak 
about immigration issues, another interesting topic for Cubans 
who live in several nations on different continents.

  [Text] Havana, 23 Apr (PL) -- Today, the local government 
and the Cuban emigrants agreed to form mixed commissions to find 
more flexible mechanisms for immigration paperwork and cultural 
exchanges. 
  During debates at The Nation and the Emigrants Conference in 
this capital, the two parties also agreed that the U.S. blockade 
on Cuba is a obstacle on the path toward the adoption of 
practical measures to normalize ties between Cuba and its 
nationals abroad. 
  Miguel Alfonso, spokesman for the meeting, said the 
emigrants 
presented various proposals during the second day of sessions, 
among them a proposal to define the rights and duties of 
permanent residents in other countries. 
  Other proposals include the creation of an emigrant visa, 
the 
possibility that those living abroad may study on the island if 
they pay tuition, and quick processing of paperwork for short 
trips to Cuba for humanitarian purposes. Another proposal made 
by the visitors was to establish Cuban consulates in various 
U.S. cities to better meet the needs of the Cuban community 
there. Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said Washington already 
knows of Havana's desire to establish consulates in cities where 
most of the emigrants live. 
  Robaina previously spoke about the official immigration 
policy and pointed out that it is impossible to resolve in a 
three-day meeting problems that have accumulated for three 
decades. He added that the conference is intended to hold 
discussions, to better understand each other's positions, and to 
initiate a process. 
  According to Alfonso, the foreign minister noted that it is 
the Cuban Government's practice to keep people's feelings in 
mind before taking important measures, especially after 35 years 
of aggression and scars that have not completely healed. 
  He added that any measures would initially include the 
identification of areas requiring atention, followed by the 
measures to be taken, and finally, a process to explain 
everything to the entire country. 
  Another explanation was that it is impossible to attain the 
same rights and responsibilities for people living in Cuba as 
for those living abroad for different reasons, as it happens 
with almost all existing laws in the world. 
  A total of 19 speakers, including 16 guests, spoke following 
Robaina's special appearance. Alfonso described it as a 
high-level dialogue. 
  In the course of the dialogue, Robaina said the Foreign 
Ministry will now coordinate the work of all Cuban institutions 
responsible for handling immigration matters. The objective is 
to give systematic, efficient, and harmonious treatment to these 
problems, he said. 
  According to the latest official report by the commission 
that organized the conference, the arrival of a new group of 
emigrants today brought the number of guests to 215 people from 
29 countries.

  [Text] Havana, 23 Apr (PL) -- Today, Patricia Gutierrez, a 
guest at The Nation and the Emigrants conference being held in 
this capital, said the groups of ultraconservative Cubans living 
in the United States are increasingly losing their influence 
over the rest of the community. 
  In an interview granted to PRENSA LATINA, the daughter of 
Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, who was imprisoned in Cuba for 22 years 
for conducting activities against the revolution and who later 
traveled to the United States, talked about the failure of the 
last-minute attempts by the aforementioned groups to recover 
their lost political ground. 
  In this context, she even mentioned the recent spreading of 
false rumors in Miami regarding the health of Cuban President 
Fidel Castro and the attacks against the emigrants who are 
participating in the current talks in Cuba. 
  Gutierrez said she was pleased to be able to personally 
prove 
the falsehood of these reports. She said she believes in Fidel 
and in Cuba and was pleased to be on the island for the first 
time because she was born and raised abroad but recognizes Cuba 
as her fatherland. She noted the hospitality received since her 
arrival and the positive experiences at the conference. I 
believe the meeting is the first big step, she said and added 
that she is willing to contribute to the fulfillment of the 
nation's dreams. 
  In another part of the interview, she criticized U.S. 
intervention in Cuban affairs and said she is opposed to the 
U.S. blockade of the Caribbean island. Gutierrez said she 
opposes any return to the past in Cuba, which she described as 
useless. She said the group that supports that position among 
the Cubans living in the United States is a majority, although 
very silent at times, for fear of attacks from the recalcitrant 
minority. 
  Proof of this -- and this is important in Miami -- is that 
there were no unfavorable farewells to all those who came to the 
conference in response to an invitation from the Cuban 
Government, she said. I believe it is a message from those who 
live there because love is always stronger than hate, she said. 
  Patricia Gutierrez said she supports the search for 
solutions 
to matters such as the simplification of immigration paperwork, 
which interests those living outside of Cuba. She said she is 
optimistic about the meeting's success which has gathered over 
200 emigrants in the capital of her homeland.

  [Text] Havana, 23 Apr (PL) -- Today, emigrants, who in the 
past carried out acts of violence against Cuba, stressed the 
importance of the meeting they are attending here on the island 
in search of normalizing ties between the country and its 
citizens who live abroad. 
  In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Rafael Huguet, former member 
of the Alpha 66 group, stressed that the theory of violence as 
the way to solve Cuban problems has been irreversibly defeated, 
thus confirming the opinion of a majority of the Cuban community 
living in the United States expressed during a recent poll. 
  Those who defend the idea of war are desperate despite the 
control exerted on the Miami media and the hopes of those with 
extreme positions who want to protect their economic profits, 
Huguet said. 
  Huguet also stressed the increase in support by U.S. 
congressmen who are demanding an end to the U.S. blockade of 
Cuba as the initial step toward improving bilateral relations. 
  The former Alpha 66 member also believes the future of his 
country of origin is very positive and described that the 
current "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference as historical. 
The conference was convoked by the Cuban Foreign Ministry and 
more than 200 emigrants, from various countries throughout the 
continent [as received], are attending. 
  Meanwhile, Luis Tornes, a man who participated in the foiled 
Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, admitted the failure of the use of 
weapons, which he himself used on occasion, and stressed the 
progress being made by those who support the normalization of 
ties between the emigrants and the homeland. 
  Regarding the differences between Cuba and the United 
States, 
Tornes said Washington must realize that the island is not part 
of its territory. "We are a free, independent, and sovereign 
country," he added. 
  Tornes strongly criticized the spokespersons for the most 
recalcitrant counterrevolutionary organizations in Miami, adding 
that they are trying to use a sort of "radio violence" against 
those who defend a just position regarding Cuba. 
  With regard to the conference, Tornes concluded by saying: I 
have been working toward this for some time and now that it is 
being held, I am very optimistic and sure that everyone will be 
pleased with the results.

<F P=106> [Report by Aissa G. Garcia] </F>
  [Text] Havana 23 Apr (PL) -- Miami resident Magda Montiel 
is happy to know that many of the emigrants attending a meeting 
with the Cuban authorities have put aside their arrogance, which 
is a result of defeats, and are thinking of the welfare of their 
country. 
  Montiel, a former congressional candidate for the State of 
Florida, and 209 other emigrants are attending "The Nation and 
the Emigrants" conference under way in Havana. 
  According to Montiel, this conference, which she describes 
as 
a "reencounter with the homeland," is a very important step that 
has been very well accepted by the Cuban community living 
abroad, including those who once decided to invade the island or 
were members of terrorist groups. 
  Montiel believes the fact that mercenaries, who were part of 
the foiled Bay of Pigs invasions in 1961, are now willing to 
talk with the same government they tried to overthrow 30 years 
ago is very important and will be remembered and written about 
in the pages of history. 
  In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Montiel said that for 
days prior to the conference the television stations as well as 
the newspapers talked about the conference and tried to play 
down its importance. Montiel added that there were even people 
who invented and spread rumors that Fidel Castro was sick. 
  Montiel recalled that self-appointed Cuban President Jorge 
Mas Canosa, head of the ultrarightist Cuban-American National 
Foundation (FNCA), has appointed a cabinet and announced the 
creation of an emergency junta "to be prepared for any action." 
  The Cuban emigrant added that in the past few days she has 
seen Mas Canosa more scared and angry than usual, especially 
when his distorted features are picked up by the television 
cameras saying: "Let Castro's friends go to Cuba to eat 
lobsters." 
  According to Montiel, defeated in the elections by Liliana 
Ross Lethinen, an ultrarightist and a FNCA protegee, "the United 
States and the Cubans living abroad do not have the right to 
dictate what should happen in Cuba; that is up to those who live 
on the island." 
  I believe changes must be made on the island because of the 
severe economic crisis the country is confronting. Even the 
government admits this. But these changes must be made in 
accordance to the needs of the people and those who lead them, 
Montiel added. 
  Regarding another kind of change, Montiel said that if the 
Cubans did not want their president, he would not be in power 
because "our people's spirit of rebellion does not accept 
impositions." On the need to respect the sovereignty of the 
nation, Montiel said that "we must let the Cubans in Cuba solve 
their problems, and, if necessary, we who are outside should 
support them as neighbors should." 
  Montiel opposes a return to the Cuba of the past. The Cuban 
emigrant recalled her happy and fortunate childhood in the Nuevo 
Vedado neighborhood in Havana where Santa Claus visited her and 
brought her lots of toys while other children were shoeless and 
did not even have milk to drink. 
  I did not see the Mafia or the corruption prior to 1959, but 
my parents did, and I know it existed even though there are some 
who refuse to admit it, Montiel added. According to Montiel, 
the ultra rightists think of yesterday's Cuba (before the 
Revolution) as a paradise where everything was rose-colored; but 
today, she added, it is a sin to admit the achievements of the 
Revolution. 
  Montiel added that she left the country when she was eight 
years old and that it was very difficult to leave her home, her 
grandmother, her friends, and the way she lived in Cuba to go to 
Miami where everything was different, where one lives in 
constant fear of having one's children stolen, even at the 
airport or at a shopping center. 
  Montiel, a well-known lawyer, has her law practice in Miami 
and is currently a member of the Cuban Committee for Democracy 
(CCD), even though she does not share many of the ideas of the 
organization. When asked about the elections in which she ran 
against Ross Lethinen for a seat in the U.S. Congress, Montiel 
said that had she won she would have shown the rest of the U.S. 
Congressmen that not all Cuban emigrants think like those who 
support a U.S. blockade.

  [Text] Havana, 23 Apr (PL) -- Today, Abel Prieto, president 
of the Union of Writers and Artists (UNEAC), said it is 
necessary to move toward recognizing the country's cultural 
unity which includes the contributions of Cuban emigres. 
  Speaking to the media shortly before the start of the second 
session of The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, Prieto said 
such recognition is necessary regardless of where the artistic 
event takes place and added that the country has been working 
toward that goal for some time. 
  It is a task that has been carried out with some omissions 
due to the tension, but thanks to the country's interest, there 
are already some publications in existence. They are the result 
of ongoing rather than last-minute efforts, Prieto added. 
  He announced that on 25 April, UNEAC will host a panel 
discussion with the participation of emigrants to analyze 
possibilities for cultural exchanges and to discuss topics of 
mutual interest. 
  Prieto spoke of ending the stereotypes and schemes 
established over the past 30 years and moving on toward the 
attainment of serious cultural recognition. To conclude, Prieto 
described the attacks by ultraconservative groups on the 
conference as ridiculous and stressed the broad ideological 
spectrum of the numerous guests.

<F P=106> [Report by Raimundo Lopez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 23 Apr (PL) -- In an explicit 
acknowledgement of the cultural excellence of those who live 
outside the island, the Cuban Government expressed its support 
for the reestablishment of stable cultural bridges between the 
nation and the emigrant communities. 
  The official position with respect to this issue was 
expressed by Abel Prieto, president of the National Cuban 
Writers and Artists Union [UNEAC], in a special address during 
The Nation and the Emigrants Conference that began yesterday 
with the participation of more than 200 Cuban guests living 
overseas, mainly in the United States. 
  He indicated that only the establishment of fluid links in 
the cultural arena will allow us to overcome schematic 
perceptions, biases, and stereotypes that have risen on both 
sides during the past 30 years. 
  Prieto, together with Vice President Carlos Lage and Foreign 
Minister Robert Robaina, is one the youngest members of the 
Cuban Communist Party [PPC] Political Bureau elected during the 
Fourth PCC Congress that took place in October 1991. 
  He emphasized that only serious and strong cultural 
association based on exchange and mutual respect, as well as the 
conscious adoption of Cuban awareness, will open the doors 
allowing the substitution of stereotypes for higher qualitative 
communication. 
  The Cuban official only excluded contacts with those 
emigrants who advocate the island's annexation to the United 
States and present the country's national culture as something 
inferior and geopolitically dependent on the U.S. empire. 
  Prieto included in this group writer Guillermo Cabrera 
Infante who, in his quest to subordinate the Cuban nation and 
culture to Washington, has even attempted to drown the patriotic 
thoughts of national apostle Jose Marti. 
  The UNEAC president stated that while Cabrera Infante places 
the island in a subordinate and colonial situation because of 
its proximity to the U.S. coast, Marti described it as "faithful 
to the Americas," reason for which it must continue as a free 
nation, as well as a bastion of independence and sovereignty. 
  Prieto stressed that, despite efforts by the United States 
and advocates of annexation to wipe out the values of Cuban 
culture, "a genuine innovation continues to grow among Cuban 
emigrants, completely divorced from any score-settling and 
anticommunist obsession, an innovation that continues the debate 
on the conflicts of its divided identity and seeks to draw 
closer to its nation and its roots." 
  In the arts, literature, social sciences, and thought, we 
find valuable contributions to an understanding of the Cuban 
national being and its everyday happenings, he added. 
  He indicated that there is an effort in some artists, who 
are 
considered "Cuban Americans," to draw closer to the mythical 
island, to reconstruct this hazy world, seen in dreams, that 
their parents abandoned, where they find something clean and 
genuine. 
  In another part of his address, Prieto indicated that the 
Cuban Revolution came about to interrupt the growing process of 
denationalization the island was being subject to and replace it 
with Marti's unfinished ideals and those of the founding fathers 
of the Revolution. January 1959 represented the opportunity to 
complete the national project and even safeguard Cuban identity 
and culture, Prieto stressed. 
  The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, which is scheduled 
to conclude tomorrow, is aimed at normalizing ties between Cuba 
and the emigrants, whose relations have been marked by 
historical U.S. hostilities toward this small island.

  [Text] Havana, 23 Apr (PL) -- Today, Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina announced the Cuban Government will take several 
steps to facilitate visits to the island by Cubans living 
abroad. Robaina announced the decision during deliberations of 
The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, which began in Havana 
on 22 April. 
  A conference spokesman told PRENSA LATINA that one such 
measure will be to lift the five-year waiting period normally 
required of people who legally left the island before they can 
return to Cuba for a visit. Up to this time, anyone who left 
Cuba for good had to wait five years before visiting the country 
unless the purpose of their visit was humanitarian. 
  The requirement for emigrants traveling to Cuba to reserve 
hotels during their stay, which they usually spend at relatives' 
homes anyway, will also be removed. The spokesman indicated that 
Cubans living abroad will also be allowed to study in Cuba but 
will have to pay a tuition established for this purpose. 
According to the source, the issue of a Cuban publication for 
emigrants will also be considered.

  [Text] Havana, 24 Apr (PL) -- Carlos Lage, vice president 
of the Council of State, described today as useful and 
beneficial the authorities' three-day meeting with more than 200 
members of Cuban communities from 29 countries. 
  In brief statements to reporters, Lage commented on the 
current state of the economy and its outlook and then added that 
the meetings with the emigrants were held in an atmosphere of 
mutual respect. 
  The meeting began last Friday with the primary objective of 
normalizing ties between the country and Cuban nationals living 
abroad. 
  Lage pointed out that the main obstacle to achieving that 
objective is the hostile policy that the United States has had 
toward the island for the past 35 years. 
  He added that the blockade imposed by Washington is also an 
obstacle to the emigrants' aspirations to participate in the 
official plan to increase foreign investment on the island. 
  He pointed out that the blockade, which has lasted for more 
than three decades, is a serious violation of the human rights 
of 11 million Cubans. That is why anything done to eliminate it 
is the fairest and most just course of action. 
  Lage said the emigrants could help the country by increasing 
their awareness of the damage inflicted on their nation of 
origin by U.S. policy and of the need to fight against the 
blockade.

  [Text] Havana, 24 Apr (PL) -- Cuba confirmed today that 
Cuban emigrants will be able to make investments in Cuba, 
although it noted that the pertinent regulations will be decided 
in the future. 
  Speaking to the plenum of "The Nation and the Emigrants 
Conference," Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of 
State, explained that, in general, the regulations established 
by the current legislation regarding foreign investment will 
apply to these cases. 
  Thus, investment in export-generating areas will have 
priority, and will not be authorized -- for the time being -- in 
the small-business, sugar industry, and oil-extraction areas, 
among others. 
  Miguel Alfonso, a conference spokesman, told the media that 
Lage gave a briefing on Cuba's financial situation, which has 
worsened as a result of the collapse of the European socialist 
bloc and the tightening of the U.S. blockade. 
  Lage stressed that, in light of the current situation, the 
Cuban Government adopted several strategic decisions, including 
the promotion of the tourist, pharmaceutical, and 
biotechnological industries as well as the completion of 
investment projects under way, those of which only generate 
revenues via exports. 
  Other decisions consisted of revamping the state apparatus 
to 
make it smaller and more efficient, and guaranteeing that no one 
is abandoned in case the structural changes generate some sort 
of unemployment. 
  Lage mentioned that the opening to foreign investment, the 
creation of the basic cooperative production units -- which 
already comprise 2.5 million hectares -- and the removal of the 
ban on Cuban's possession of foreign currency constitute 
additional strategic measures. 
  Further decisions include increasing the authorization of 
self-employment and reorganizing finances to return the Cuban 
peso its purchasing power. 
  A total of 24 speakers participated in the debate that 
followed Lage's remarks. Emigrants discussed the possible 
purchase of state-issued bonds to participate in local the 
economy as well as the necessary increase in family remittances. 
  Emigrants expressed their interest in the possibility of 
assigning small capital to their relatives to open private 
businesses and the creation of mechanisms to channel those funds. 
  Alfonso pointed out that all participants agreed that it is 
necessary to lift the U.S. economic embargo against Cuba in 
order to promote any type of investment on the island.

  [Text] Havana, 24 Apr (PL) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro 
will hold a reception for the Cubans living abroad who are 
participating here in The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, 
Miguel Alfonso, spokesman for the meeting, confirmed today. 
  The Cuban president invited the 215 emigrants from 29 
countries to a reception following the closing session of the 
meeting that began on 22 April on an initiative by the Cuban 
Foreign Ministry. 
  Alfonso confirmed the invitation during a meeting with the 
press, during which he reported on the participation of Vice 
President Carlos Lage, who spoke about the current economic 
situation and the country's outlook, which has worsened with the 
disappearance of the European socialist bloc and the tightening 
of the U.S. economic blockade. 
  According to Alfonso, Lage said the Cuban emigrants will not 
be kept from investing in the island, but said that future 
meetings will determine the mechanisms that will be applied in 
that regard.

<F P=106> [Report by Aissa G. Garcia] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 29 Apr (PL) -- After two days of 
discussions and announcements that were more or less unexpected, 
a group of emigrants meeting with government representatives 
expressed their optimism and satisfaction with the first steps 
in the process to normalize relations. 
  Max Lesnick, a member of the Cuban Change [Cambio Cubano] 
group and one of 215 participants in The Nation and Emigrants 
Conference, which is scheduled to conclude here today, views the 
measures to ease migration policies as positive and beneficial 
for the entire overseas community. 
  "My presence at the meeting," Lesnick told PRENSA LATINA, 
"is 
indicative of my belief that we Cubans must solve our problems 
without foreign interference. I hope that every step we take 
will be with mutual respect and with a view toward what is best 
for Cuba." 
  Foreign Minister Robert Robaina announced yesterday the 
adoption of several measures to facilitate communication between 
the emigrants and the country. These measures include 
eliminating the five-year waiting period required of those who 
left the island legally before they can visit the country. 
  It was also decided to create an office for emigrant issues, 
to publish a magazine specializing in migration issues, and to 
allow emigrants to stay with relatives (instead of having to 
reserve hotels), and to allow them to study in their country of 
origin. 
  Businessman Roberto Solis told this news agency of his 
satisfaction with the decision to allow "our children to study 
at Cuban universities" and to create an office responsible for 
looking after and understanding the community. 
  That specific measure, he added, gives us legal support as 
immigrants in the United States and represents a significant 
accomplishment to those of us who came to have these discussions. 
  In his opinion, the process of to normalize relations 
between 
Cuba and the overseas community got off to a good start because 
a door was opened that will lead to further communication 
between both sides. 
  To commentator Marcos Castellon, expectations are high for 
this meeting because even before the debates ended, concrete and 
significant results had already been announced. 
  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said on Saturday that 
the "process must proceed without haste or pressure and in the 
most clear-cut manner possible." 
  According to Roberto Carballo, former mercenary of the 
failed 
1961 invasion of Playa Giron and member of the Cuban Committee 
for Democracy, so far they have made some very significant 
achievements, but "there is still room for more." 
  Carballo supports a continuation of the process but believes 
that whatever happens "will depend on solving problems as well 
as on the United States' lifting of the blockade, which greatly 
harms the Cuban people." 
  According to Carballo, despite the public rejection of the 
conference in Miami, "many (he did not mention names) called me 
to say that they supported my decision to participate because 
they realize that dialogue with the government is the only thing 
that can be done." 
  There is a silent majority over there. When they see moments 
of genuine sincerity to seek solutions, they express their 
willingness to accept and even to participate in them, he added. 
  One common denominator of this meeting has been the support 
for statements by the Cuban foreign minister regarding the 
willingness of authorities "to examine all legal provisions that 
will ease the way to a normal relationship between the emigrants 
and the nation." 
  The conference, described by the participants as the first 
link in a chain, concludes today at the Havana Convention 
Palace, where the emigrants, government officials, and reporters 
stand in the corridors and reflect on how the debates are 
progressing.

  [Text] Havana, 24 Apr (PL) -- "The Nation and the 
Emigrants" conference ended here today with a determination to 
maintain close ties between the government and those living 
abroad, regardless of the differences between the United States 
and Cuba. 
  Jose Ramon Balaguer, a member of the Politburo of the 
Communist Party of Cuba, reaffirmed the local government's 
willingness to continue working toward the normalization of its 
relations with the emigrant community, despite, he stressed, the 
rivalry that has existed between Havana and Washington for the 
last 35 years. 
  Balaguer led the closing session of the conference, which 
began on 22 April in the capital city's convention center. The 
conference was attended by 215 Cubans currently living in 29 
countries around the world who responded to an invitation from 
the Cuban Foreign Ministry. 
  The meeting was private. Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina announced yesterday several agreements as the 
preliminary results of the conference. Vice President Carlos 
Lage today announced that there is now a better understanding, 
between Cubans living both on and off the island. 
  According to Miguel Alfonso, spokesperson for the 
conference, 
the five-year waiting perod required of Cubans who left the 
island legally in order to be allowed to visit the country was 
eliminated. It will no longer be mandatory for emigres visiting 
their relatives in Cuba to make reservations at a hotel, either. 
Other changes will allow Cubans and their children living 
abroad to study on the island if they pay the established 
tuition and fees. The study will look into the possibility of 
publishing a magazine directed at Cuban emigres. 
  The emigrants also proposed the creation of an emigrant visa 
and a more expeditious procedure for traveling to their country 
of origin for humanitarian reasons. 
  From now on the Foreign Relations Ministry will have the new 
task of coordinating the work of all Cuban institutions 
regarding emigration in order to ensure a systematic, efficient, 
and harmonious process. 
  In addition, Lage confirmed that the emigrants will not be 
excluded from investing in the island, although he said the 
specific details and types of investment will be discussed at 
future meetings. 
  In addressing the plenum, the vice president of the Cuban 
Council of State said that, in general, foreign investment 
regulations will be applied in such cases as established by 
current legislation.

  [Text] Havana, 24 Apr (PL) -- Cuban authorities confirmed 
today their interest in continuing the efforts to normalize 
relations with Cuban emigrants despite the difficulties prompted 
by the hostile U.S. policies toward the country. 
  Jose Ramon Balaguer, member of the Communist Party 
Politburo, 
confirmed this decision during his speech to close The Nation 
and the Emigrants conference, which lasted three days and was 
attended by the over 200 guests living in 29 countries. 
  I want to emphasize our determination not to turn back on 
the 
path we have taken and to continue working in the future with a 
common and constant effort to build this two-way road in 
relations between Cuba and its emigrants, despite the Cuban-U.S. 
disagreement, Balaguer stressed. 
  During a nine-minute speech, Balaguer stressed that despite 
political, ideological, or any other sort of differences among 
participants in the conference, Cuba's independence and 
sovereignty constituted the most important points of agreement. 
  Balaguer added that this attitude conveys the patriotism 
felt 
by a large number of Cuban emigrants, many of whom also demanded 
that the 30-year U.S. embargo against Cuba be lifted. 
  Balaguer pointed out that discussion topics such as the 
elimination of the U.S. blockade, the preservation of our 
undeniable social conquests, and not returning to the horrors of 
a past of exploitation and submission for Cuba have been widely 
agreed by participants, which demonstrates the sincere 
patriotism that prevails among emigrants. 
  In addition, Balaguer indicated that the maturity and 
culture 
of Cubans on the island is the fundamental starting point that 
today enables us to advance our goal of normalizing relations 
between Cuba and the emigrants. 
  Balaguer asserted that "we must not forget the wound that 
has 
not yet completely healed or the abnormal circumstances that 
still threaten the security of the fatherland." 
  Balaguer only excluded from the rapprochement process 
supporters of the island's annexation to the United States, 
terrorists, political demagogues, and those referred to as false 
patriots. 
  He maintained that they -- those who insist on the goal of 
destroying the revolution and thus endangering the existence 
itself of the nation, its sovereignty, and that Cuban nature we 
have mentioned so often -- do not have any room in these noble 
intentions, which do not target anyone in particular. 
  At the end of Balaguer's speech, several participants 
chanted 
in the plenary hall of the Conventions Palace. Down the halls 
they shouted the slogan, Cuba yes, blockade no. 
  Today's session was marked by the special participation of 
Vice President Carlos Lage, who talked about the state of the 
economy and its outlook. 
  Conference spokesman Miguel Alfonso said Lage told Cubans 
living abroad about the possibility of participating in the 
opening to foreign capital initiated in Cuba last year but said 
the application of this policy would be discussed in future 
meetings. 
  In yesterday's session, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
announced six government measures, many of them old aspirations 
of the participants in the meeting with the purpose of 
facilitating the emigrants' links to their nation and cultural 
exchanges.

  [Text] Havana, 25 Apr (PL) -- President Fidel Castro

Emigrants" conference, greeting them personally one by one. 
  The weekly TRABAJADORES magazine reports today that the 
Cuban 
leader thanked the emigres during the meeting last night for 
their "solidarity and presence in the fatherland, for their 
expressions of support for Cuba, for preserving the achievements 
of the revolution, and for our people and their continuous, 
tremendous struggle against the U.S. Government's blockade." 
  The weekly notes in a short article that Carlos Lage, 
secretary of the executive committee and vice president of the 
Council of State; Foreign Affairs Minister Roberto Robaina;

  [Text] Havana, 25 Apr (PL) -- When many countries of the 
world are coming apart like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, the 
language spoken in Cuba is one of family reunification and 
normalization of ties between this country and its emigrants. 
  "The Nation and the Emigrants Conference" concluded Sunday 
afternoon with the participation of 215 emigrants from 30 
countries. Most of the participants described the conference as 
a first step toward the opening of channels of communication 
between the two sides. 
  Although measures were announced to expedite those 
relations, 
some participants, like businessman and newsman Lazaro Farinas, 
felt that the main achievement of this meeting was that it was 
held. 
  Farinas, who always expressed his ideological differences 
with the Cuban Government, told PRENSA LATINA he felt very 
satisfied with the results of the meeting, "because it allowed 
former adversaries to come to talk with the government of their 
fatherland without foreign interference." 
  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina announced yesterday the 
adoption of several measures to expedite the communication of 
the emigrants with their country, including the removal of the 
requirement for those who leave the country legally to wait five 
years before being able to return. It was also decided to 
create a department to handle emigrants, edit a magazine related 
to the topic of immigration, and allow residents [as received] 
to stay at the home of relatives instead of being forced to book 
hotel rooms to study in their country of origin. 
  In Farinas' opinion, the normalization of ties will permit 
the "thwarting of Miami's belligerent and violent emigrants, who 
are just one part of the community, as well as contributing to 
the health of the nation. [no closing quotation marks as 
received] 
  For years, we walked on a path that divided us and we got 
nowhere; now we want to explore how to be united in favor of the 
Cuban nation, Farinas noted in judging that the conference shows 
the viability of normalizing relations despite ideological 
differences. 
  Raul Varandela, a former member of the rebel army's ninth 
column who later adopted a counterrevolutionary stance, told 
PRENSA LATINA that "Jorge Mas Canosa (head of the ultrarightist 
Cuban American Foundation) is now suffering, but we are not, 
because this meeting opened up the path we were seeking." 
  In the opinion of John Cabanas, a businessman who runs a 
charter airline, the meeting constitutes a starting point that 
will make room for communication and dialogue among relatives 
and will identify the problems of the community and their 
solutions. Like other participants and observers, Cabanas 
termed as very democratic the fact that the authorities allowed 
all views and concerns of the overseas community to be expressed. 
  The fact that those from over there and those here -- 
government officials included -- talked amiably, even those who 
had never been friends, also caught the attention of the 
participants, newsmen, and guests. 
  Orlando Lastre, of the Promankind [Prohombre] organization, 
stated, in turn, that those who allowed themselves to be 
intimidated by the fear campaign launched by Miami's right-wing 
and failed to attend will regret not having participated in this 
event in which the groundwork was laid for greater communication 
between the two parts of the same nation. 
  The first decisions adopted at the conference will begin to 
take shape tomorrow, as joint commissions will be set up to 
discuss topics of common interest, such as immigration and other 
concerns of young people, women, artists, and professionals, 
without needing to wait for the next conference.

<F P=106> [Article by Nicanor Leon Cotayo: "The Nation and the </F>
Emigrants: Common Sense Has the Floor"] 
  [Text] Havana, 22 Apr (PL) -- The first requirement to 
understand the deeper meaning of the meeting, which begins on 
Friday between Cuban authorities and emigrants, is not to assess 
the meeting apart from the circumstances, both within and 
outside the country in which it will take place. One of these 
circumstances, aspects of the Cuban question in the United 
States, deserves to be considered briefly as an illustration. 
  Although it is difficult for some people in the world to 
understand, the Cuban issue in the United States basically is 
not a matter of foreign but domestic policy because of interests 
involving winning the Florida elections. 
  The fact that there are in this American state some 260,000 
people of Cuban ancestry with voting rights has created the 
fiction that this number, which constitutes a minority in 
relation to the rest of the people with voting rights, is 
"essential" for victory in this state, the fourth most important 
in U.S. elections. 
  This makes it clear that influence, big or small, in this 
context is determined by the correlation of forces among people 
of Cuban ancestry residing in the United States, particularly in 
Florida. 
  What organization still exerts the greatest influence in 
this 
scenario? The Cuban-American National Foundation [FNCA], 
created in the early 1980's under then President Ronald Reagan's 
warm sponsorship, is an ultraconservative organization with 
ample financial resources and a well-oiled mechanism of 
influence in the Congress. 
  The FNCA holds a very intransigent position regarding Cuba, 
rules out all possibilities of dealing with Fidel Castro's 
government, defends to the utmost the so-called Torricelli Law, 
and accepts only the surrender of the Cuban revolutionaries. 
  Although the foundation's greatest influence was observed 
during the Republican governments of Ronald Reagan and George 
Bush, the FNCA's ties with Washington have not been severed, and 
there is official interest in not taking any steps that could 
cause significant clashes with the organization. 
  On several occasions, the U.S. press, THE WALL STREET 
JOURNAL 
on 3 August 1992 for instance, have reported that the FNCA and 
its head, Jorge Mas Canosa, have turned the Cuban issue into a 
profitable political affair, not without certain irregularities. 
  Another peculiarity of Mas Canosa's organization is the use 
of subversive methods against everyone in Miami who dares voice 
an opinion even slightly different from the FNCA's far-rightist 
ideas regarding Havana. 
  Some people still remember what happened to THE MIAMI 
HERALD, 
which Mas Canosa accused of serving Castro's government only 
because the paper expressed an opinion that contradicted the 
Torricelli Law to some extent. Later, paper officials received 
death threats, and some of the paper's distribution centers were 
seriously damaged by terrorist actions. This explains the harsh 
attacks that the far-rightist sector of the Cuban community 
living in the United States has unleashed against the "The 
Nation and the Emigrants" conference, which opened today. The 
meeting's central goal, to advance on the road to normalizing 
relations between Cuba and Cubans living abroad, is unacceptable 
to the intolerant who alienate themselves from the true feelings 
prevailing in a community that is gradually abandoning them. 
  Maybe this is why the initial shouting of those who act like 
this is an accurate indication of how right this conference is. 
And perhaps this shouting is also a noisy introduction to the 
emergence of new approaches which, though not ideologically 
coincidental with those of Cuba, could form a commonsense bridge 
in the civilized dealings between the nation and its emigrants.

<F P=106> [Report by Aissa G. Garcia] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- The U.S. immigration policy, 
which has given Cubans favored [diferenciado] treatment since 
1960, is held hostage by ultraright-wing U.S. immigration 
sectors and is the center of criticism by other, less favored 
nations, experts have asserted. 
  Milagros Martinez, director of the Policy Alternatives 
Studies Center (CEAP), told PRENSA LATINA that the emigrants 
conservative sector utilizes its financial power to degrade any 
congressional program that attempts to modify the current 
policy, which does not benefit most of those groups. 
  Issues, such as family reunification and the immigration 
process, were widely discussed at a meeting between Cuban 
authorities and the Cuban community abroad which was held in 
1978. Such issues could return to the agenda in the second 
meeting of this type, which will be held here this weekend. 
  Referring to this possibility, Martinez stressed that Cuba 
had made its emigration policy more flexible and that "more 
people do not go to Miami because the United States does not 
want them." 
  In recent years, there has been a decrease in legal 
emigrations and an increase in illegal ones, CEAP specialist 
Antonio Aja told PRENSA LATINA. The specialist considered the 
U.S. immigration policy to be contradictory. 
  In reality, he stated, investigators have indicated that 
they 
do not know if the immigration treatment given to Cubans is part 
of the established policy or if it is a package of 
circumstantial measures that originated in the general framework 
of the Cold War. 
  Aja opines that those contradictory elements, which have 
repercussions on civilian society and even at government levels, 
such as the Immigration and Naturalization Services (SIN), 
contribute to making many Cubans decide to emigrate. 
  As an example, he mentioned the 1966 adjustment law for 
Cubans that ensures automatic asylum and the right to residence 
(a year and a day after arrival) to Cubans who emigrate 
illegally and who consider themselves to be political refugees 
regardless of whether they are such or not. 
  In his opinion, this explains the great immigration 
advantages Cubans have in relation to other minorities, against 
whom the United States has currently imposed stronger measures 
to reduce the flow of foreigners to their country. 
  Another point of contradiction, Aja says, is marked in the 
exodus program that gives Cubans the possibility of using the 
embassies of third countries as a springboard to request asylum 
and later travel to the United States. 
  He cautioned, however, that since the beginning of the 
current year, this program has been stopped because of the 
negative repercussion it had in Mexico and the Dominican 
Republic, among other countries. These countries do not want to 
confront this type of problem because it does not relate to them 
and stems from migration confrontations between Cuba and the 
United States. 
  That is not the only channel, however, used to motivate the 
illegal exodus, the specialist commented. He added that another 
channel is accepting that temporary visitors decide to settle in 
the country, a request generally rejected if it is processed on 
the island. 
  Why is a Cuban not classified when he presents his request 
to 
travel to or permanently reside in the United States at the 
Washington Interests Office in Havana. Why is he well received 
if he risks his life at sea to enter the United States through 
the Florida coast, Aja asked. 
  In his opinion, the U.S. immigration policy, due to its own 
inconsistencies, requires reform that should include the 
depoliticization of the issue and an attempt to regularize the 
migration ties between Havana and Washington. He said Cuba must 
also redesign its emigration policy, despite the fact that it 
was made more flexible in 1978. 
  Asked about the 1984 migration agreements, Aja asserted that 
Cuba had allowed the departure of citizens who had been 
convicted for going against state security, accompanied by their 
families. 
  With regard to the return to the island of the so-called 
excludables (2,700 Cubans with criminal records who left the 
country through Mariel port in 1980), he said this has not been 
possible, among other things, because those citizens have 
worsened their legal situation in U.S. jails to impede their 
extradition. He asserted that Havana has always been willing to 
receive those people and has made its position known, so now 
Washington has to take a stand and offer a solution to this 
issue. 
  On the concession of granting up to 20,000 visas a year to 
Cubans who want to visit or live in the United States, the 
specialist observed that the U.S. Administration has not kept 
this agreement, which also forms part of the U.S. immigration 
law. 
  As in the past 30 years and different to the treatment given 
to other communities, Cubans continue to have open doors to the 
United States, especially if they come through the route that is 
more hazardous, the illegal one, he said.

  [Text] Havana, 25 Apr (PL) -- Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina today hoped that Mexico will find an adequate solution 
to the violent developments in recent months, and he indicted 
that Mexico's relations with his country "are above any program." 
  Talking to the local and foreign press covering "The Nation 
and the Emigrants Conference" that concluded here yesterday, the 
foreign minister insisted "there are things that fall solely 
within the purview of Mexicans to assess, and I respect the way 
they have been handled." 
  He added that many things have happened after Chiapas that 
have shaken Mexican society, as well as Cuban society, referring 
to the murder last March of the ruling party's presidential 
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and the political uncertainty in 
some sectors of that nation. 
  In Robaina's opinion, what pains Cuba the most is that there 
is no solution yet. However, he hopes the best possible path 
will be found. Robaina added that he respects what is happening 
in that neighboring country too much to give an opinion from the 
outside. 
  When asked if the results of the August election will give 
continuity to bilateral trade, he replied that existing 
relations are "sufficiently stable, not to be altered or 
diminished by any electoral process." 
  "I am highly confident, because relations with Mexico are 
above any program and are based on a cultural, historical, and 
geographical identity," and therefore -- he stressed -- they 
prevail even above the interests of the United States and NAFTA. 
  In another respect, the foreign minister noted that the 
recent landing in Mexico's southeastern coast of Cuban rafters 
has not prompted any contact or proposal outside normal channels 
for these cases between the governments of the two countries. 
  "We have maintained normal and fluid communications, and 
there is no pressure from any side," he stressed. 
  Robaina also commented on the reception President Fidel 
Castro hosted yesterday afternoon in honor of the delegates to 
"The Nation and the Emigrants Conference," which he described as 
a discussion with a great deal of respect, understanding, and 
emotion, something more important than a question and answer 
discussion. 
  He also warned that the policy the Foreign Ministry has 
followed regarding the community of Cubans living abroad will be 
continued without necessarily hosting new meetings as the one 
recently concluded. 
  "I am certain we started on a path from which we cannot turn 
back, but it does not only depend on successive conferences," he 
stated, going on to explain that none of the measures adopted 
intend to promote a change in U.S. policy toward Cuba. 
  "Whether or not it has an influence, that is not the 
purpose. 
The purpose was much deeper and is related to restoring a 
relation, restoring those ties, and not allowing this community 
to continue to be manipulated against the country," he noted. 
  He also indicated the government has been extremely cautious 
in deciding to work in favor of normalizing relations with 
emigrants, although this -- he added -- was not a process 
brought about by the work of those who wanted to organize it, 
but rather the product of a process of informing the people to 
enable them to understand it. 
  He explained that if the result of the meeting contributes 
in 
some measure to stop the manipulation of the Cuban community 
abroad -- not just in the United States -- then it was in fact a 
success, although Washington's reaction depends fundamentally on 
the repercussion it has and on what is happening today in Miami 
and elsewhere, he stated. 
  The foreign minister affirmed that the measures agreed on 
during the meeting will be implemented in the future, and he 
reiterated his country's willingness to negotiate "anything" 
with the U.S. Government, on the basis of equality, absolute 
understanding, and respect.

  [Text] Caracas, 19 Apr (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Relations 
Minister Roberto Robaina today focused on the result of his 
regional tour: the opening of greater communications channels 
and economic opportunities in Latin America. 
  The Cuban foreign minister, who was stopping over in this 
city on his way back to Havana, has just visited Uruguay, Peru, 
Argentina, and Paraguay. He said: "It was an opportunity to 
better explain our situation and to learn more about the reality 
of the American continent, which now more than ever needs to be 
united." 
  The foreign minister told PRELA that the objective of this 
visit was to explain what Cuba can contribute to the continent 
and what Cuba can receive from the region. He announced that 
businessmen from these four nations will begin visiting the 
island in the next few days. 
  Robaina pointed out how convenient it is for Cuban diplomacy 
to reflect the needs of national reality. He also pointed out 
that the most important need nowadays is to find economic 
opportunity. 
  To this end, he said that the natural stage for Cuba is 
Latin 
America, which Havana has always wanted to rescue and from which 
it was almost artificially cut. 
  He underscored that it is very important for the Caribbean 
nation to explain that our plan has not only shortcomings and 
weaknesses but has also made many contributions. 
  As an example, he cited the influx of foreign capital, 
because the country has raw materials, infrastructure, and a 
work force with great cultural, technical, and scientific 
qualifications. 
  He believes that the basic priority for the subcontinent is 
economic integration, which will be discussed at the next 
Ibero-American Summit in June in Cartagena, Colombia. 
  We can no longer continue to see how some countries are 
meeting and solving their problems due to their resources and 
geographic locations, while we, the poor ones, are more divided 
than ever and are being ignored during the distribution process, 
Robaina added. 
  As he delved deeply into the issue during his visit to these 
countries, Robaina said that beyond the differing opinions made 
public in the last few months, there was some progress made in 
Argentina on the projects that the two nations can embark on 
together. 
  As for Paraguay, the foreign minister stressed that Havana 
is 
not on the road to establishing diplomatic ties. He added, 
however, that his visit opened a door and that the island now 
has more friends in the Paraguayan political and socioeconomic 
arenas. 
  As for the upcoming "Nation and Emigration" talks that will 
be held this weekend in Havana with members of the Cuban 
community living abroad, Robaina said that it is a natural step 
and recalled that most countries maintain relations with their 
citizens who live beyond their borders. 
  He said the objective of the meeting is not to rescue the 
nation, as some have speculated, because Cuba has much more 
important priorities. He underscored: "We are not willing to 
let that community be used as an instrument against the island." 
  To this effect, Robaina explained that dialogue opens the 
path to ensuring that "the communication that must exist comes 
from us and that others can no longer manipulate it."

  [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- Today, the Cuban-Mexican 
Business Committee concluded four working days of advanced 
negotiations in many areas, particularly textiles, perfumes, 
cosmetics, and the food and marble industries. 
  This afternoon, Emilio Carrero and Marcos Dorantes, heads of 
the Cuban and Mexican delegations respectively, signed a joint 
communique on the understandings reached during the talks. 
  The delegation of businessmen was made up of representatives 
from 40 Mexican companies, of which the most important include 
the Mac'ma Group, a leading manufacturer of cookies and pastas; 
Del Valle fruit juices, a major company in this sector of the 
food industry; Bancomer; Xacur Group; Mexicana de Aviacion 
Airlines; Doal Paints; and International Business de Mexico. 
  Carlos Tello Macias, Mexican ambassador to Cuba, and 
Porfirio 
Mederos, vice president of the Cuban Chamber of Commerce, 
expressed their satisfaction with the progress made during the 
meetings, and stressed their mutual interest in increasing trade 
between the two nations. 
  PRENSA LATINA interviewed some participants who expressed 
their interest in being represented not only as suppliers to the 
Cuban tourist sector, but also as prospective partners in joint 
production projects in areas like textiles and the production of 
juices, cookies, and pastas for local and foreign consumers. 
  According to a joint communique signed today, the meeting 
focused on topics such as NAFTA (Mexico-United States-Canada) 
and its effects on bilateral relations and new business 
opportunities in Cuba and its legislation. 
  The document mentions industries dealing with metal working, 
food, livestock, health, construction materials, and light and 
basic industry as good business opportunities. Topics such as 
maritime transportation, Cuban customs regulations, tariffs, and 
transactions delays were also discussed. A total of 100 
bilateral meetings were held. 
  According to the communique, progress was made regarding 
Cuban export operations of marble, medicines, cellulose and 
resins, steel, and papaya seeds. Meanwhile, the Mexican 
delegation expressed their interest in working in areas such as 
tourism, perfumes and cosmetics, and textiles. According to 
Mexican sources, Mexican-Cuban trade amounts to $131 million 
annually, of which, however, Cuba is at a disadvantage by $117 
million.

  [Text] Mexico City, 24 Apr (PL) -- It was learned here that 
a group of illegal Cuban emigrants, whose boat was rescued two 
weeks ago in Mexican waters, tried to escape the Mexican Navy's 
custody but were intercepted and returned to port in Isla 
Mujeres. 
  A note issued by the Mexican Navy Secretariat states that 
despite the authorities request and all the facilities given 
them to continue their trip safely, 62 of the 85 Cubans on the 
rescued boat, sailed off toward Miami. 
  The boat, which sailed "without authorization and in 
violation of all dispositions and recommendations that banned 
them from departing the port in Isla Mujeres," was intercepted 
by the Mexican authorities. During the operation the Cuban boat 
collided with a Mexican Navy vessel participating in the 
operation. 
  According to a report by an EL DIA correspondent, as a 
result 
of the crash, three persons were injured on the Cuban boat, 
including a pregnant woman and a child. 
  Meanwhile, the Navy Secretariat explains that following the 
incident, the Cuban boat was returned to Isla Mujeres but that 
the occupants chose to remain on board. 
  "The Mexican authorities reiterated, once again, their 
determination to handle the situation in strict compliance with 
the law and protecting the human rights of the illegal Cubans," 
the note adds. 
  The communique stresses that Mexico "cannot allow the boat, 
Ferrocemento 25, to sail from Isla Mujeres" and adds that this 
decision was made to avoid endangering the lives of the 
occupants of the boat, which is not seaworthy. 
  Before the attempted escape the Mexican authorities had 
given 
the 85 Cubans permission to remain in Mexico legally for 180 
days and to take them to a place where they would be safe and 
where they could complete the procedures aimed at definitely 
resolving their situation. 
  However, according to the press, this official offering was 
rejected by the group of Cubans who are determined to reach the 
United States by boat.

  [Text] Mexico City, 23 Apr (PL) -- Authorities of the 
Mexican State of Quintana Roo today reported the arrival of a 
boat with 94 Cubans aboard, in the second such incident in less 
than 15 days. 
  According to press reports, 47 men, 27 women, and 20 
children 
had been aboard the boat "Casilda 127," which sailed furtively 
from the island on 15 April bound for Miami, Florida. The boat, 
however, was forced to change course for Mexico because of an 
engine malfunction. 
  Mario Villanueva, governor of Quintana Roo, has told EL 
FINANCIERO that Cubans apparently use this state as a 
"springboard" to the United States. 
  As for another group of 85 Cubans who arrived at Chetumal on 
11 April, the Government Secretariat has reported that they were 
given legal authorization to stay on Mexican territory for 180 
days under a non-immigrant visitor status. The Secretariat 
announced that the boat, "Ferrocemento 25," will be put at the 
disposal of its legal owner, the Cuban Government, as soon as 
its legal ownership is determined. [sentence as received] 
  The U.S. Department of State recently announced that it will 
continue to refuse entry into the United States of Cubans who 
use third countries. In turn, the Havana Government has 
systematically denounced the political manipulation by the 
United States of the flow of Cuban emigrants. It has been said 
that, while the U.S. Interests Section in Havana grants visas to 
30 percent of those who request them, the U.S. Government 
accepts and gives special treatment to those who arrive 
illegally. 
  U.S. legislators have pointed out the discriminating 
treatment given to other illegal immigrants, including Haitians 
and Mexicans, who are returned to their countries.

<F P=106> [Report by Ulises Canales] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 23 Apr (PL) -- American members of the 
Venceremos Brigade today accused the U.S. media of manipulation 
and lack of objectivity in reporting issues related to Cuba's 
current status. 
  In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Ayda Lucero, an activist of 
the Venceremos Brigade National Committee, pointed out that U.S 
newspapers and radio and television stations normally report the 
difficulties the island is going through, yet fail to provide 
in-depth reports on issues such as the economic blockade and 
Washington's hostility toward Havana. 
  Lucero, a member of the Brigade's 25th contingent who 
arrived 
yesterday in Havana from Mexico, described the lack of 
objectivity and misleading information on Cuba's status. 
According to Lucero, the reports ignore satisfactory conditions 
in areas such as health, education, social security, and 
employment. 
  The group, which includes 142 persons, stated that its 
objective is to challenge regulations restricting U.S. citizens 
from freely traveling to Cuba. In addition, it plans to urge an 
end to the economic restrictions affecting Cuba for the past 
three decades. 
  In this respect, Lucero pointed to the growing movement 
within the United States favoring normalized relations between 
both countries, which, she said, includes the Solidarity with 
Cuba National Network organizations. In addition, she also 
mentioned some Cuban-Americans who help to let the truth be 
known about Cuba. 
  In her opinion, U.S. citizens and the Cuban community in the 
United States are also suffering the consequences of the 
blockade. Members of the latter group are prevented from 
traveling, seeing their relatives, or having close ties with the 
land in which they were born. 
  That is why, she added, I, as well as the other brigade 
members, agree with having The Nation and the Emigrants 
Conference, which the Foreign Ministry organized to find 
mechanisms of understanding between the government and 
expatriate Cubans, take place in Havana. 
  Ayda Lucero was also in Cuba this past October as part of a 
group of U.S. pacifists who support the "freedom to travel" 
project. In a gesture of solidarity, she then decided to spend 
her honeymoon in this country despite pressures and penalties 
she may encounter, which according to current U.S. legal 
provisions could range from fines of up to $250,000 and prison 
sentences of up to 10 years.

<F P=106> [By Walfredo Angulo] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 15 Apr (PL) -- The educational achievements 
of Cuba will permit it to move forward, Colombian Deputy 
Education Minister Antonio Jose Lizarazo said today after 
stating that the Colombian people and government want greater 
cooperation with the island. 
  Lizarazo is a member of a Colombian delegation visiting Cuba 
to reach agreements for increased cooperation in the 
educational, cultural, sports, technical-scientific, and tourist 
fields. 
  Cubans have achieved a level of coordination in the 
educational sector that allows them to speak of a wholly 
organized, coordinated, and balanced system that has achieved 
great success, Lizarazo said in an interview with PRENSA LATINA. 
  This was all conceived in keeping with the country's need 
for 
professionals and skilled labor, as well as to form citizens 
actively committed to a cause, he added. 
  Asked about possible repercussions in his country due to the 
signing of protocols for educational, sports, and cultural 
collaboration and the agreements signed by the mixed commission 
last night, Lizarazo sustained that the majority of the 
Colombian people and government want to strengthen ties of 
friendship with Cuba. 
  These unprecedented multiple cooperation agreements include 
approximately 80 projects submitted by Cuba, such as options for 
investments in tourism, mining, communications, aeronautics, 
textiles, and fishing, among other fields. 
  To Lizarazo, these agreements form part of his country's 
policy to promote integration with neighboring countries, with 
the Caribbean countries and with Latin American countries. He 
pointed out that the new Colombian constitution approved in 1991 
establishes these foreign affairs priorities. 
  There will always be those who oppose and misinterpret the 
incumbent government's actions in this direction, he said, 
commenting on reaction that surfaced a few weeks ago following 
negotiations on the possible sale of Colombian oil to Cuba. 
  Lizarazo recalled that relations have always been maintained 
in the sports and cultural fields by contracting with Cuban 
trainers and athletes and by exchanges and visits by artists and 
said that this will be more frequent from now on. 
  He regarded the signing of a protocol with the Cuban 
Education Ministry and other agreements signed in this capital 
as "a more precise evaluation of the general subjects which make 
up bilateral collaboration." 
  With them we intend to improve the quality of Colombia's 
educational services as part of reforms being developed in this 
area by the ruling government, he added. 
  Referring to conversations with Cuban authorities, Lizarazo 
said he appreciated the honesty shown in admitting and 
correcting past errors and, he added, the will to push forward 
and continue along paths Cuba believes are correct. 
  He expressed admiration for the way they the Cuban 
authorities were facing current challenges and said they will 
succeed because there is optimism and confidence and because it 
is the will of all Cubans to succeed. 
  Only 37 years old, the Colombian deputy minister has been in 
this office -- which also attends to sports and culture -- for 
one year. Previously he was a presidential aide in charge of a 
social investment program and before that he was the governor of 
the Norte de Santander Department, on the border with Venezuela. 
  The Colombian delegation to the mixed commission is led by 
Andelfo Garcia, deputy foreign minister for Latin America, and 
includes the communications and the environment deputy 
ministers, Jaime Uribe and Eduardo Uribe, respectively, along 
with a dozen other officials.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Maria Elena Gil: "To Consolidate a </F>
Space in the Caribbean"] 
  [Text] [No dateline as received] April signaled a high 
point in Cuba's foreign policy in the Caribbean. The 
establishment of an embassy for the Eastern Caribbean in 
Barbados, the normalization of diplomatic relations with 
Grenada, and the establishment of ties with Antigua and Barbuda 
helped to close Cuba's diplomatic circle with its closest 
neighbors. 
  After years of mutual indifference, Cuba and the Lesser 
Antilles began to pay more attention to each other this decade 
as a result of the debacle in the socialist camp and the former 
Soviet Union and the formation of large trade blocs, two events 
that severely affected the foreign trade of many countries. 
  Deprived of 85 percent of its trade, which consisted of 
barter agreements and other beneficial agreements with the USSR 
and the rest of the socialist countries of Eastern Europe, 
Havana saw the need to promote trade on a lesser scale but with 
a greater variety of Latin American and Caribbean countries. 
  In fact, relations with the Caribbean Common Market 
(Caricom) 
date back to the late seventies. Through agreements with this 
regional integration organization, hundreds of students from the 
English-speaking islands studied at Cuban universities. 
  A particular thread of persuasions make up the web of 
relationships between Cuba and the Anglo-Caribbean, a region 
that gave ample proof of its independent spirit when four of its 
most important members -- Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, 
and Barbados -- established ties with the island in the 1960's 
and 1970's, during the full enforcement of the OAS prohibition 
-- instigated by the United States -- that mandated the 
diplomatic isolation of Cuba in the hemisphere. 
  In bilateral issues, the Caribbean nations were usually 
cautious and exhibited their well-known British phlegmatic 
nature -- a product of their colonial heritage -- before 
establishing ties beyond formalities, at international forums 
the Antillean group always voted with Cuba. 
  Subjects such as the defense of the Caribbean as a peace 
zone, condemnation of the use of force anywhere in the world, 
apartheid in South Africa, and [support for] independence 
movements, united the Spanish and English-speaking Antilles into 
a single bloc. 
  On a strictly economic plane, it became obvious Cuba needed 
to join Caricom, which procrastinated implementing its own 
decisions for full integration, something that even today lacks 
a solid basis: free trade, a common currency, and the freedom to 
travel and to contract labor from among the member states. 
  Some of the smaller states' prevalent fear of a presumed 
overwhelming predominance of Cuba over the members of the 
Anglo-Caribbean community gave way to a spirit of cooperation, 
once it was proven that one side needed regional integration as 
much as the other. 
  Although Cuba has twice as much territory and people as all 
of the Caricom countries combined, it is struggling through an 
economic and financial crisis that forces it to expand as soon 
as possible into markets by offering its products and services 
for which, especially in biotechnology and medicine, there is 
still room in the Caribbean. 
  In addition, an initial obstacle -- how countries which 
traditionally depend on tourism as a source of income could deal 
with the take-off of the Cuban tourist trade -- was solved by 
the admission of Cuba into the Caribbean Tourism Organization 
(CTO). 
  Wisely, the smaller tourist island paradises in the region 
-- 
Jamaica and the Bahamas taking the lead -- decided to share 
instead of compete against Cuba, when faced with the 
irreversible reality of the future rebirth of the Pearl of the 
Caribbean as the area's preferred vacation spot. 
  Branwell Shepherd, a Jamaican businessman whose 
Salasaventura 
travel agency has a multi-destination tourism program with the 
island, told PRENSA LATINA that "once the U.S. blockade against 
the Cuban Government is lifted, the influx of U.S. tourists will 
be unstoppable." 
  Under these circumstances, said Shepherd, the rest of the 
Caribbean nations must be willing to reach mutually beneficial 
agreements with Cuba, instead of lamenting over something that 
is inevitable. 
  Sources at the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples 
(ICAP), which handles most of the donations received by Cuba, 
revealed that 50 percent of the donations received in 1993 came 
from the Caribbean countries. 
  "We have raised our voice many times in defense of the 
smaller countries' right to exist, and have expressed our 
opinion at international forums. However, we have sometimes 
neglected our relationship with the Lesser Antilles, our closest 
neighbors, and this is now one of our most important political 
priorities," Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina told PRENSA LATINA 
last November during his tour of seven nations in the area.

  [Text] Havana, 19 Apr (PL) -- According to a GRANMA article 
titled "The Best Recommendation: ...Click," the anti-Cuban TV 
station known as Marti will continue to be unable to broadcast 
its signal to Cuba even if it changes its frequency and channels. 
  GRANMA has denied the success of a recommendation made to 
the 
station by a U.S. congressional panel to switch its VHF 
frequency to UHF in its fruitless attempts to reach the Cuban 
audience thanks to a Cuban Government-sponsored interference 
system that blocks out illegal broadcasting. 
  The newspaper indicates that U.S. technicians and 
specialists 
are aware of this, but are fraudulently not admitting to the 
public that the TV station has failed to achieve its objectives. 
This is a hostile action at a time when the possibility of 
reaching a bilateral agreement on communications is being 
debated. 
  The text specifies that this also coincides with the 
commemoration in this capital of a meeting between Havana's 
government and sectors representing Cuban emigres overseas, 
[words indistinct] to which switching frequency does not make 
that TV station less illegal. Marti also uses the deceitful 
argument of offering Cubans "uncensored information," which 
really means information that suits U.S. interests. GRANMA adds 
that an average of 1,043 radio hours per week originating in the 
United States are part of a war that is overloading the Cuban 
dial. 
  GRANMA says that this argument does not stand up to 
analysis. 
And if this wasn't enough, they would have to admit that a high 
percentage of entertainment programming on Cuban TV is produced 
in the United States, as are some TV news services. 
  The idea is to smuggle anti-Cuban "propaganda," not 
"information without censorship," with which they seek to 
demoralize, discourage, and divide Cubans and to criticize the 
Cuban economy which they are sabotaging daily with their 
blockade legislation and other harassment measures, the 
newspaper argues. 
  The commentary warns also that if the anti-Cuban television 
does not want to trip on the same stone (failure) twice, 
something that could happen to the adminsitration of President 
William Clinton, it would be worth its while to listen to the 
(onomatopoeic, succinct, and direct) advice of millions of 
Cubans: "Click" (meaning, turning off their television sets).

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Carlos Fazio, PRENSA LATINA </F>
contributor and Uruguayan journalist residing in Mexico, 
entitled: "What Should Be Done With the CIA?"] 
  [Text] Mexico City [no date as received] -- The case of 
Aldrich Ames, a mole or double agent, who gave sensitive CIA 
information to Moscow for the last 10 years, is the spark that 
has set off a great espionage scandal between the United States 
and Russia that has momentarily put an end to Bill Clinton and 
Boris Yeltsin's honeymoon. 
  But beyond the game of geopolitics and its strategic 
consequences, the Ames affair has had a destabilizing effect 
within the agency that had been his sponsor, the CIA, which was 
already undergoing a life-and-death struggle. 
  From its headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the Company 
still 
maintains an impressive bureaucracy of 22,000 people and handles 
an ultrasecret budget of approximately $30 billion a year. 
  However, since former President George Bush declared his 
final victory over the "Evil Empire" -- the former Soviet Union 
-- and the end of the Cold War, the mecca for U.S. espionage has 
lost its way, and even today it wanders blindly in pursuit of 
confusing objectives and goals. 
  So much so, that for the past couple of years a number of 
U.S. congressmen have been insisting on the need to redesign the 
role of the CIA in today's world. 
  But the search for the identified enemy in today's world is 
more complex than it was when the East-West confrontation 
existed; that is to say, capitalism vs. communism. 
  Obviously, there still are focal points of tension in 
different parts of the world, providing the raw material for 
this "watchdog of democracy" -- which has a great deal of 
expertise in the assassination of leaders and foreign 
dignitaries, as well as in destabilizing campaigns -- raw 
material that encourages it to run amok and provide work for a 
large number of its boys. 
  Today, apparently state-of-the-art spying is not moving in 
that direction. The chiefs of the Company sensed this toward 
the end of 1991, when they drafted an internal document, 
"Changemasters," and hand-in-hand with the so-called 
globalization and bloc policy, they determined that geopolitical 
confrontation between the old superpowers (the U.S. and USSR) 
was giving way to eventual economic and trade wars. 
  Therefore, the "war for markets" became a tangible glut of 
hypothetical short-term scenarios, of greater importance than 
ideological confrontation, which was the leitmotif of the Cold 
War. 
  Robert Gates, who preceded current CIA Director James 
Woolsey, gave priority to economic espionage during his stay at 
the Langley bunker. Revelations that spies from France and 
Great Britain, the principal U.S. allies in the free world, had 
infiltrated U.S. high-technology firms, led Gates to a reversal 
of objectives. He sent Company men to spy on friendly 
countries, emphasizing the collection of secret documents in the 
fields of advanced technology, industry, and economics. The 
only problem was that, as in other areas of the agency's work, 
Company spies arrived late and ill-prepared to battle for 
information. 
  In today's world, as well as in the world of spying, the 
CIA, 
as never before, is facing strong competition. Not only abroad, 
but also within the United States, the CIA faces fierce 
competition in the fight for privileged information from 
agencies such as the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency), the FBI, 
the National Security Council (which reports to the Presidency), 
and the State Department's External Operations Agency [as 
received]. 
  Of course, on the subject of redesigning the role of the 
CIA, 
President Clinton himself has pointed out other objectives to be 
pursued, such as drug interdiction, monitoring the spread of 
nuclear weapons, and tracking the sale of rocket technology. 
  But while it continues to search for enemies, the lack of 
clear objectives and internal rivalries has lowered the morale 
of the largest U.S. espionage agency. 
  Even worse, the "Ames case" has increased this uncertainty 
and pessimism: Langley shivered and longed for the good old 
days and the bygone Rambos of liberty. 
  Wolf Blitzer, a CNN White House correspondent and defense 
issues expert, came to a hard-hitting conclusion: These are the 
worst of times for the CIA. According to Blitzer, who 
interviewed James Woolsey, the CIA "seems to have lost its soul" 
and is trying to find a "reason for its existence." Woolsey was 
vague and elusive; he has yet to recover from the blow he 
received from Aldrich Ames, the mole in Moscow's service. 
  It was said in February, when Ames was arrested at his home 
in Virginia, that in the wake of the initial damage control 
measures a witch hunt would be launched. That has not yet 
happened, except for a few dirty, public, and yet minor scuffles 
with Moscow. But it is still early. Moreover, as we have seen, 
Woolsey has many problems -- among them, taking care of his 
"former friends" as well as his "new friends."

  [Text] Havana, 22 Apr (PL) -- The Cuban Government has a 
new structure by virtue of a decree-law published today that 
calls for the elimination of several organizations of the 
central government and their incorporation into various 
ministries, including a few new ones such as the Ministries of 
Economy, Foreign Investment, and Tourism. 
  Decree No. 147 of the Cuban Council of State approved the 
creation of the Ministry of Economy and Planning, which will 
takeover the duties of the Central Planning Board and 
institutions such as the State Committee for Standardization, 
State Committee for Material and Technical Supply, and the 
Office of Industrial Design, among others. 
  It also created the Ministry for Foreign Investment and 
Economic Cooperation to replace the state committee dedicated to 
this sector. There is also the brand new Ministry of Tourism to 
replace the institution that oversaw this area. 
  This reorganization also brought the Ministry of Finance and 
Prices that is tasked with fulfilling the duties carried out up 
till now by the State Committee for Statistics and the duties of 
other institutions linked to the economic field. 
  According to the legislation, which was textually published 
by GRANMA, the goal is to reduce the number of institutions and 
adjust the duties of the government apparatus to the special 
period during peace time (which is the name given here to the 
program of special measures being implemented to face the crisis 
created by the blockade and the disappearance of the former 
socialist bloc). 
  The legislation also states that the purpose is to better 
adapt the institutions to the exchanges and cooperation 
activities carried out by the country under the current 
international conditions. 
  The State Committee for Labor and Social Security is now a 
ministry and the Science Academy was made the super Ministry of 
Science, Technology, and the Environment. 
  The Ministry of Metallurgy and Electronics Industry replaced 
the National Institute of Automated Systems and Computer 
Technology (Insac) and the Combined Producer and Exporter of 
Electronics Technology [Combinado Productor y Exportador de 
Tecnica Electronica - Copextel]. 
  The other ministries (16) and the Institutes of Civil 
Aeronautics, Radio and Television, Sports, Physical Education 
and Recreation, and Hydraulic Resources and State Reserves 
remain intact, the decree stated. The implementation of this 
decree should produce adjustments to rationalize the attribution 
authority and duties of the organs and organizations that were 
eliminated. 
  The Council of Ministers Executive Committee will create a 
commission responsibility with the evaluation of adjustment 
proposals within 90 days. [sentence as received] 
  In keeping with Decree-Law No. 147, the Cuban Council of 
State appointed Rosa Elena Simeon Negrin as the minister of 
science, technology, and the environment, and Osmany Cienfuegos 
Gorriaran as minister of tourism. 
  Antonio Rodriguez Maurell is the new minister of economy and 
planning; Jose Luis Rodriguez of finance and prices; Ignacio 
Gonzalez Planas as minister of metallurgy and electronics 
industry; Ernesto Melendez Bachs as minister of foreign 
investment; and Francisco Linares Calvo as minister of labor and 
social security. 
  The high-ranking state organ relieved Ramiro Valdes Menendez 
and Joel Domenech Benitez from their duties and posts of vice 
presidents of the Council of Ministers. It adds that the other 
deputy ministers, who are not also serving as ministers, will 
head programs and activities of various organizations or head 
specific tasks that will be commissioned for their importance.

  [Text] Havana, 23 Apr (PL) -- During its extraordinary 
meeting to be held on 1 May, the Cuban parliament will study 
recommendations made by workers to solve the problems affecting 
the island's economy and people. 
  Ernesto Suarez, secretary of the National Assembly of the 
People's Government, ANPP, today told GRANMA that the ANPP will 
study the main topics discussed by the workers during the 
so-called workers parliaments (approximately 800,000 meetings 
attended by more than 3 million workers and which were held in 
February and March). 
  Suarez said everyone understands that the ANPP will not 
approve a capitalist-type "package of measures" aimed at solving 
the country's problems. The ANPP secretary said the measures 
adopted will be implemented gradually, as the government has 
been doing since last year. 
  Ernesto Suarez said that even though the measures will be 
implemented gradually, they will most probably represent some 
sacrifice for everyone, but, Suarez stressed, no citizen will be 
abandoned. 
  The ANPP will hold an extraordinary meeting to study and 
approve work policies, ideas, guidelines, and plans to confront 
the serious economic and financial problems Cuba is confronting. 
These measures will be added to those already implemented.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Dos Santos: "Cuban Parliament: An Unusual </F>
Session on Labor Day"] 
  [Text] Havana -- The Cuban parliament will hold a special 
session, which will be historic in more than one sense, to 
carefully examine Cuba's domestic finances. The session will be 
unique not only because of the decisions that will derive from 
analyses made by the country's labor sector but also because the 
legislative session will take place, for the first time ever, on 
a Sunday, which also happens to be Labor Day. 
  Cuba's most prominent labor leader, Pedro Ross, told me that 
the best homage the National Assembly could pay the Cuban 
workers is to further discuss the country's toughest problems 
and adopt measures aimed at resolving them. 
  This will be the first time in the past three decades that 
there will be no rally followed by a march to Plaza de la 
Revolucion on 1 May. The day will be commemorated on 30 April 
with events and marches in provincial and municipal capitals 
throughout the country. 
  The labor leader said there will be massive celebrations in 
five municipalities in the city of Havana, something that will 
permit a better and more rational utilization of the material 
resources this kind of event requires. 
  It has been estimated that, for the usual mobilizations, it 
will be necessary to defray the cost, in the capital alone, of 
approximately 50 tons of fuel to transport hundreds of thousands 
of sympathizers who gather at the central Plaza Municipality, an 
expenditure that is ill-advised in the current economic 
situation. 
  Another factor that apparently was considered in changing 
the 
traditional celebration is that it is necessary not to lessen 
the attention being given to the harvest of products that are 
essential to the national economy and the people, such as sugar, 
tobacco, potatoes, etc. 
  President Fidel Castro himself has talked to the National 
Committee of the Central Organization of Cuban Workers 
Federation [CTC] about the difficult material status the 
sugarcane harvest is experiencing and the importance of planting 
efforts capable of permitting higher productivity in the years 
ahead. 
  The Cuban leader asked the labor movement not "to lower its 
guard in any of the agricultural and industrial activities in 
which we are engaged." Ross reiterated this a few days later in 
noting that April and May are decisive months for securing 
targeted production results. 
  Commenting to journalists about current efforts and results, 
the labor leader said sugar production involves more than 
600,000 workers, many of whom have to work with torn shoes and 
shirts. He noted, though, that this year, like last year, the 
labor force has not deserted. 
  He said: There is a high spirit of sacrifice, a desire to 
overcome adversity and limitations. It is significant that early 
in April there are already 15 brigades of sugarcane cutters that 
can cut more than 1 million arrobas. 
  While steps are being taken at all levels to raise economic 
efficiency -- the key for pulling out the evil from the root -- 
it has become evident that measures of a restrictive nature, 
which will affect everyone to various degrees, must be adopted, 
although an effort will be made to protect the lower-income 
groups as much as possible. 
  The importance of massive participation in the discussion of 
and search for solutions has been established. This was done 
through a process called the Workers Parliament, which has 
prevailed as a mechanism for evaluating very special situations. 
Discussions of a vast network of ideas and opinions on how to 
resolve problems and debates on opposite points of view have 
produced optimistic results. In the midst of the complicated 
situation the country is enduring, the economically active 
population, which decides the future with its work, has again 
demonstrated its position in favor of a more just society. 
  The general measures that will be adopted to face this 
situation will enhance the awareness of efficient producers, an 
awareness which is already practical and is evidently winning 
ground in the framework of a colossal and unique effort to keep 
the Cuban Revolution alive and faithful to its social project, 
while making adjustments to the real situation without 
abandoning its ideal of transforming the situation.

<F P=106> [Report by Teresa Ochoa] </F>
  [Text] Merida -- Yesterday, members of the 32d Military 
Zone seized nearly 40 tons of weapons and ammunition. 
Authorities are investigating to determine whether the weapons 
are linked to the Chiapas conflict. The soldiers arrived in five 
vehicles at "The French Courier" gun shop and seized the weapons 
just before midnight. The store is located on the corner of 60th 
and 65th streets, just two blocks from the local Government 
Palace. Although military authorities are keeping a tight lid on 
the matter, it was learned from unofficial sources that there 
are several tons and that the load may weigh as much as 40 tons. 
  Answering questions about the reports, General Antonio Lopez 
Portillo said the seizure "probably did occur." Major Alberto 
Larios did not deny that there could be 40 tons of war materiel, 
and he confirmed there is an ongoing investigation into possible 
connections between local armories and the Chiapas conflict. 
"Who said there were 40 tons?" he asked, after denying the 
general was in, when in fact he was in his office. "That does 
not concern me. I know nothing of the matter," he said. 
  Two individuals from Chiapas were arrested two weeks ago 
while trying to move 3,000 .22 caliber bullets reportedly 
obtained at the Merida armory. Larios said authorities are 
investigating possible ties between these men, the armories, and 
the Zapatist National Liberation Army. The men were trying to 
load the ammunition at the Merida bus terminal to transport it 
to their home state. The two men from Chiapas were intoxicated 
and acting suspiciously, and because of this, Federal Judicial 
Police were called in.

<F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] In Tijuana, Baja California, Dr. Ernesto G. Mesina, 
president of the so-called American Union Party, has been 
released from prison. Mesina is allegedly linked to Mario 
Aburto Martinez, perpetrator of the Luis Donaldo Colosio 
Murrieta murder, which took place one month ago in this border 
town. 
  Shortly before his release, members of the Special 
Prosecutor's Office conducted raids at the residence and office 
of Dr. Ernesto G, Mesina, who has expressed to local media his 
pleasure over Colosio's killing. Mesina also considers Mario 
Aburto Martinez as a true hero and patriot for the murder. 
Regarding this topic, Gerardo Segura has filed this report: 
  [Begin recording] [Segura] Was Mario Aburto a member of this 
party? 
  [Mesina] Of course not, but I would be honored if he would 
have said: Dr. Mesina, I have read your book and the title of 
one of your articles, and they were the inspiration for my 
action. It is good this happened because this will allow us to 
have a fair government. I know people may criticize him a great 
deal now, but history will acquit him sooner or later. 
  [Segura] There is talk he maintained contacts with militants 
of this party and this somehow inspired him to commit the crime. 
There is talk he held certain meetings here. It is even said 
he was at this building planning everything before the crime. 
  [Mesina] Of course not. I did not have the pleasure of 
knowing Mario Aburto Martinez, but we would have had other 
meetings in any case. [sentence as heard] I have never met him, 
but this does not mean I do not admire him for what he did, for 
his courage. The assertions that this crime was an act of 
cowardice are not true. [end recording]

  [Text] Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate, has formally 
invited two of his colleagues, PAN [National Action Party] and 
PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] presidential candidates 
Diego Fernandez de Zevallos and Cuahutemoc Cardenas, 
respectively, to a public debate. 
  [Begin Zedillo recording, in progress] ...agree that the 
upcoming elections are of special importance for the future of 
the country. Mexican society demands a strengthened democracy 
for peace, unity, and justice. Democracy requires legality, 
impartiality, and transparency in the elections. Democracy also 
requires the promotion of dialogue and respectful debate among 
those who aspire to the presidency of the republic. 
  All the presidential candidates have expressed their 
willingness to publicly debate ideas and programs. Luis Donaldo 
Colosio was the first to call for a debate. I have personally 
reiterated at different campaign rallies my desire to hold a 
debate. 
  I trust that throughout the campaign there will be an 
opportunity to discuss our positions with all candidates from 
all parties. Therefore, I now respectfully invite Diego 
Fernandez de Zevallos and Engineer Cuahutemoc Cardenas to 
discuss as soon as possible and in public our ideas and 
political programs. 
  The citizens' demand and the expressed willingness of the 
contenders make it possible that the debate be held as soon as 
possible. Therefore, I expect a prompt response from Fernandez 
de Zevallos and Engineer Cardenas. I propose the debate be 
carried live by radio and television in a format of 
unquestionable impartiality, transparency, and fairness. I 
propose one single broadcast that can be received and 
transmitted by all radio and television stations that wish to 
join be used, without favoring any specific enterprise. 
  In addition, conditions must be established so that 
representatives of the print media can cover the debate to their 
full satisfaction. I believe that to make the debate a fair 
political exercise and fruitful for citizens, the candidates 
must have equal time to explain their ideas. Additionally, we 
must have the opportunity to comment on the responses from the 
other candidates and issue an opening and final statement. A 
moderator of absolute integrity and recognized impartiality 
would help candidates adjust to the time allotted. 
  This would be the first debate among presidential candidates 
in Mexico's modern history. Holding the debate would give all 
citizens the opportunity to learn directly about our ideas and 
programs as well as allow the public a respectful exchange of 
ideas. Above all else, holding this debate would strengthen our 
democracy because it would permit voters to compare the 
different political programs in order to select freely among 
them. 
  I am fully confident the debate will make it clear that my 
party has the best program to secure Mexicans a future of 
well-being, democracy, and justice. I am fully confident public 
opinion will be able to confirm that the PRI's candidacy to the 
presidency of the republic offers the leadership, service 
experience, and social sensibility required to achieve the 
progress of Mexico. Many thanks. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by J. Jesus Rangel M.] </F>
  [Text] The Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) 
has published in the official gazette the rules, 29 reforms 
outlining method, seven on concept, by which foreign financial 
institutions may establish branches in the country. These 
reforms will provide more flexibility, according to interested 
parties. 
  Among the benefits, a list of shareholders will no longer be 
required by those who own at least 1 percent of the shares of a 
foreign financial institution; instead, it will be demanded of 
those who own at least 5 percent. An application to open a 
branch will be considered complete even if it lacks the 
authorization issued by authorities at the location where the 
institution was founded, and its consolidated financial 
statements will be reduced from five to three years. 
  Beginning today, requests can be made to establish bank 
branches, financial corporations with limited objectives, 
general warehouses, mortgage companies, financial agent 
companies, exchange houses, stock-trading companies, stock 
exchange experts, investment corporations, corporations that 
operate investment corporations, insurance companies, or 
guarantor institutions in the country. 
  The SHCP has stated the goal of these measures is to locally 
increase competition within the Mexican financial system. It 
has also said a first package for approving the branches will be 
passed during the second half of the year. The deadline for 
requests is 31 July. 
  The rules will apply not only to U.S. and Canadian 
institutions but to all those anywhere in the world that have 
branches in any of those two nations. 
  Among the requirements that must be met is the delivery of a 
list of the financial institutions and trade and industrial 
companies in or outside the country in which the company owns 
more than 10 percent of shares with a right to vote. 
  The following stand out as some of the most flexible 
rules: 

  -  The SHCP will ask for a list of shareholders who 
constitute a controlling group as well as a list of shareholders 
who hold more than 5 percent of the shares of the foreign 
institution. In the original draft bill, a list of shareholders 
who held more than 1 percent of the shares was requested. 
  -  The 
obligation to deliver forecasts on the amount of capital and 
assets will be for three years instead of six [number as 
published], as proposed in the draft bill. 
  -  A copy of the foreign 
financial institution's latest prospectus on the issuance of its 
shares and, if applicable, the related corporation will be 
needed. 
  -  Limits applicable to the branches, in accordance with 
the corresponding international treaty or agreement, will be 
based on information provided by the local supervisory 
commission of the type of branch being dealt with. 
  -  Concerning 
the sole results of the presentation to which this rule (second 
transitory) refers, a request will be considered complete 
whether it has the authorization referred to in various clauses. 
Concerning the results stemming from a calculation of the time 
limits referred to in NAFTA Article 1411, when applicable, an 
authorization and legal opinion must be presented; these are 
essential for authorizing the corresponding request.

  [Excerpt] The privatization of 86,000 state-run companies 
and the opening of foreign trade will make Russia a nation of 
major trade possibilities for Mexico. Nikolai Zaitzev, a Russian 
trade official in Mexico, has invited the Monterrey businessmen 
who attended the 33d Regular Assembly of the National Council of 
Foreign Trade of the Northeast to invest or trade with his 
country. 
  The Russian diplomat said Mexico had exported to Russia 
during 1993 between $45 million to $50 million, an amount he 
considered as low. "Besides, the majority of these exports 
reached Russia via third nations, such as Belgium," he said. 
  Among the Mexican exports to Russia are steel pipes and 
cigars, a product which the Monterrey company Cigarrera La 
Moderna exported last year for $5 million. "Mexico only exports 
between $5 million and $7 million, a figure which is very low," 
Zaitzev said. [passage omitted].

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Carlos Sosa Coello, member of the </F>
Congressional Commission on Drug Trafficking, by Raul Valladares 
in Tegucigalpa; from "The Morning Paper" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Valladares] Good morning. We are talking with 
Deputy Carlos Sosa Coello, a member of the Congressional 
Commission on Drug Trafficking. What can you tell the Honduran 
people when once again the country is mentioned in international 
news dispatches? This time, a former Colombian drug trafficker 
is saying that drug traffickers are protected in Honduras as 
well as in other countries. He also mentioned Mexico, Brazil, 
and the Dominican Republic. 
  [Sosa] [Words indistinct] at some time some drug trafficker 
received some type of protection from some authority in 
Honduras. These types of people frequently appear at the Senate 
subcommittee headed by Senator John Kerry. Obviously, the more 
charges they make, the better it will go for them in the future. 
In 1989, we had a similar experience. We investigated the 
statement by a witness of Senator Kerry's subcommittee. He was 
a former Panamanian consul named Jose Blandon. On that 
occasion, the accusation dealt with the links of some Honduran 
military chiefs with former Panamanian dictator Noriega and drug 
trafficking. The accusation was investigated [words indistinct] 
I was able to testify and confirm to a congressional commission 
chaired by Carlos Montoya that the trip of a Honduran military 
intelligence chief to Panama, during which he had some kind of 
verbal contact with General Noriega, was for the purpose of 
meeting with some leaders of the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front, who at that time were in Panama because they 
did not have the legal status in their country that they now 
fortunately have. 
  [Valladares] Who was accused? 
  [Sosa] No [words indistinct] Honduran military intelligence, 
whose participation in these types of dealings was not 
confirmed. Therefore, I do not see why I should mention his 
name. I personally confirmed that the information was false 
because by chance I was the one who established contact with the 
late Guillermo Ungo so that this military intelligence chief 
would meet with him. Therefore, the trip to Panama and the link 
with Noriega had nothing to do with drug trafficking. It was a 
meeting with a Salvadoran guerrilla leader, which is what 
Guillermo Ungo was at that time. The U.S. Senate subcommittee 
and Attorney General's Office have the habit of making deals 
with drug traffickers, who know that the more statements they 
make, the more benefits they will obtain from the Attorney 
General's Office and the subcommittee. I am talking about this 
subcommittee. We experienced this situation with consul 
Blandon, who made these types of accusations. 
  The current accusation will have to be verified. I think 
[words indistinct], will have an opportunity to begin or 
continue investigations. The first thing will be to confirm 
whether [Colombian drug trafficker] Taboada, under his real name 
or alias, legally visited Honduras. Immigration documents will 
have to be checked for this. Contacts will also have to be made 
with the Senate subcommittee. I will consult with some of our 
U.S. friends to see to what extent these accusations involve 
Honduran authorities and at what level. 
  What we now have is the fact that our country was mentioned 
among others, such as Mexico, which in the latest State 
Department report have been recognized by the U.S. Government 
for their great efforts against drug trafficking. Now, in this 
testimony, it said that drug cartels are protected in Mexico. 
There have always been judges, police chiefs, and officials of 
attorney general's offices who at some time have been negligent 
or not done their duty and [words indistinct]. But I think the 
accusation must be investigated [words indistinct] is not the 
policy of the Honduran State, and no state organization protects 
drug cartels. This is an assertion by a witness at a U.S. 
Senate subcommittee. One does not know whether they are 
serious. I repeat that in the past we investigated these types 
of statements by witnesses at Senator Kerry's subcommittee, and 
we found them groundless. It was much ado about nothing.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 22 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Fuel prices in 
Honduras changed twice in less than 12 hours, official sources 
have reported. 
  Texaco changed its prices on the morning of 22 April, but in 
the afternoon it incorporated the changes that had been decided 
by the three other fuel distributors. 
  Texaco had set the price of premium gasoline at 10.19 
lempiras ($1.40), regular gasoline at 9.57 lempiras ($1.31), and 
diesel fuel at 7.27 lempiras ($1) a gallon. 
  Nevertheless, the local enterprise DIPPSA [Petroleum 
Products 
Distributor Corporation] and the multinational companies Esso 
and Shell decided to change their prices effective Saturday. 
  The new price structure per gallon (3.785 liters) is as 
follows: 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  [Text] Managua, Apr 25 (AFP) -- The controversial 
Nicaraguan Army Commander General Humberto Ortega, who has held 
on to military power for more than 14 years, announced this 
Monday that he has reached an agreement with President Violeta 
de Chamorro for his separation from his post. 
  Although he did not give any date for his departure, Ortega 
made it clear that there is an agreement with the government for 
his separation, which will be defined in a Military Organization 
law to be sent to Congress for approval in the coming days. 
  Ortega, whose separation is demanded by Nicaraguan sectors 
and the U.S. Government, had up to now been opposed to this 
"unilateral" decision by President Chamorro, who announced last 
year that Gen. Ortega would be removed in 1994.

  [Text] Managua, 25 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- In Managua today, 
General Humberto Ortega, the chief of the Nicaraguan Armed 
Forces, warned that "if the Army should disappear (in this 
country), there will be war." 
  The Sandinist People's Army (EPS), founded in 1979, has been 
reduced from 84,000 to 14,000 men over the past four years. 
There are sectors in the country, however, that argue in favor 
of the complete abolishment of the Armed Forces. 
  Ortega's warning, according to what political analysts 
believe, was directed at the Nicaraguan Civic Movement. This 
group wants Nicaragua to have no army, as in Costa Rica. 
  Ortega was one of the speakers at a two-day seminar on the 
relationship between the military and civilians, which was 
hosted by the National Assembly. 
  During his speech, Ortega stressed, "There would be total 
anarchy without an army in Nicaragua." The forum was funded by 
the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs 
(INDI). 
  "Allow me to tell those who argue the Army should not exist 
that, if we should disappear, then 10 or 15 armies of the 
various antagonistic political and economic forces that still 
have some degree of clout would appear on the scene tomorrow," 
Ortega said. 
  The four-star Sandinist general underscored that "with no 
army, there will be more armies and war in Nicaragua." 
  "There are sectors in Nicaragua that argue that democracy 
should mean the complete undoing of the historic changes that 
occurred in 1979 (when the Sandinists defeated Somoza in an 
armed conflict). 
  "Others, namely the ultra-leftists, think democracy should 
be 
founded on the revolutionary past, which was necessary at the 
time, but is long gone," the military leader pointed out. 
  "We are the ideal of those who believe that some day there 
will be no Army," Ortega said, "but when the United States has 
no Army then Nicaragua will have no Army. That is something we 
would really like to happen." 
  Ortega, who has commanded the EPS since its founding, told 
those present that the Armed Forces collaborated in the seizure 
of 180,296 weapons of all types during 1992 and 1993. The 
weapons were in the hands of civilians who contributed to the 
country's lack of security. 
  The military leader called for a consensus regarding the 
"consolidation" and "legalization" of the Army against those who 
still believe that it is possible to change Nicaragua's history 
and throw the country into another war. 
  "The Army is no longer the armed branch of the party, as it 
was in the past for the Sandinist Front. Nevertheless, it is 
not going to be an instrument of the other party, and much less 
the armed branch of the wealthy classes," Ortega warned. 
  According to the Sandinist general, Nicaragua's main problem 
is not the relationship between civilians and the military. 
Instead, it is the backwardness "of a nation that has no 
democratic experience whatsoever and the conflict between those 
who want democracy and those who do not." 
  Ortega insisted that the Army has respected all economic, 
diplomatic, social, and financial policies that the Violeta 
Chamorro government has instituted, although some have 
criticized these policies as "good" and others as "bad." 
  Other speakers at the first part of the seminar were 
Nicaraguan Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo, National Assembly 
President Luis Humberto Guzman, and INDI President Kenneth 
Whollack. 
  The forum also features experts from the United States, 
Spain, Portugal, Chile, and Argentina.

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Garcia Castillo] </F>
  [Text] President Violeta Chamorro returned yesterday after 
a tour through the old continent. The Governments of 
Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg promised to 
continue their aid to Nicaragua "at least until I leave office," 
the leader affirmed. 
  The president signed a letter of intent as an incentive to 
foreign investment for the Swiss Government. She noted that 
Nicaragua has become the "focal point" of Swiss foreign aid, 
which will contribute $3.5 million to the payment balance and 
technical assistance. 
  The Nicaraguan leader said that Non-Governmental 
Organizations will contribute funds for local private banks to 
finance small business projects, although she did not specify 
the amount. 
  Chamorro said that the Netherlands forgave $3 million of the 
Nicaraguan debt. According to sources within the delegation, 
there are $15 million still pending. The Netherlands will also 
support Nicaragua's efforts at the Paris Club next June to 
renegotiate the rest of its foreign debt, estimated at $10 
billion. The president said that the Netherlanders will also 
contribute $20 million to the San Jacinto geothermal project. 
They will also assist Nicaragua in marking its border with 
Costa Rica. 
  Luxembourg, the last stop on her trip, offered to duplicate 
its current aid to Nicaragua, which was not specified. 
  Dona Violeta's trip to the old continent was checkered with 
"incidents" that did manage to cause certain alarm and delays in 
the itinerary. When she left the country for Europe aboard the 
Aeronica plane, she was delayed for two and one-half hours when 
the flight crew found a strange-looking bag on board. Fearing a 
bomb, the crew ordered the plane evacuated immediately. 
  Reports from Miami indicated that Mrs. Chamorro's American 
Airlines plane was evacuated just before departing, after a 
small baggage vehicle hit them as they taxied to the runway. 
Maria Alicia Talavera, assistant director of the president's 
public relations office, answering a question from BARRICADA, 
said the collision between the plane and the baggage car caused 
a scratch under right-side windows four and five.

  [Text] Managua, Apr 22 (AFP) -- Nicaraguan Foreign Minister 
Ernesto Leal today outlined the dangers posed to the Central 
American economy by NAFTA, which was recently signed by the 
United States, Mexico, and Canada. 
  Speaking before the U.S.-Nicaraguan Chamber of Commerce, 
Leal 
said the privileged access of Mexican products to the United 
States places Central America at a disadvantage. In turn, he 
urged that "a transition period" of about three years be adopted 
to allow the region to concentrate on improving competitiveness 
while it adheres to NAFTA. 
  The minister recalled that the presidents of the region had 
met with President Bill Clinton in November 1993 and that they 
proposed that the region enter the treaty under the same terms 
received by Mexico. However, he noted that unfavorable 
conditions in Central America -- a postwar economy and a 
technological lag -- prevented the region from advancing at the 
same pace maintained by more developed countries. 
  Today, about 50 percent of Central America's exports, which 
amount to some $4.5 billion, are shipped to U.S. markets.

1994 on page 8 reports that Edmundo Castillo has been expelled 
from the National Conservative Party, PNC, for one year because 
he does not follow the party line. The article explains that 
Castillo, who is renowned for his oratory skills in the National 
Assembly, has a reputation for being "very independent." 
Castillo explained that he was expelled because he supported 
constitutional reforms and because he criticized the party for 
practicing nepotism and for only representing a single class of 
society.

    [Editorial Report] Managua LA TRIBUNA in Spanish of 10 
April 1994 on page 3A reports that Roberto Urroz, president of 
the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement, MDN, and Miriam Arguello, 
coordinator of the committee on partial reforms, view positively 
the prospects for passing constitutional reform. Urroz said that 
all assembly factions, except for the center group, favor 
prohibiting relatives of the president from running for office. 
However, the center group would not be able to prevent passage 
of this reform, he said. Urroz explained there is "total 
agreement" to approve a reform that would prohibit a president 
from serving two consecutive terms. A former president could, 
however, run for reelection in alternate terms. Discussion is 
still under way whether to establish a system of primaries and 
run-off elections. Urroz said that, once passed, reforms would 
take place immediately. This means that Presidency Minister 
Antonio Lacayo cannot become a presidential candidate in 1996. 
  Miriam Arguello agreed that the center group and the 
National 
Unity and Reconciliation Bench are the only assembly members 
opposed to passing the reforms on reelection of the president 
and electing relatives of the president. The Sandinist Front, in 
her opinion, is against establishing primaries. Arguello 
suggested that the Executive Branch would harm the legislative 
system if reforms passed by the legislature were vetoed.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Julio Lopez Campos] </F>
<H5>  [24 March] </H5>
  [Text] Above and beyond the political stance we take or the 
economic situation we are in, we Sandinists ought to develop a 
consensus about the key items on our agenda. As an activist, I 
therefore suggest: 
  1. The first major point that we all ought to agree on and 
the first major political accord that all groups ought to adopt 
is: the decisions of the Congress must be honored by all. 
Whether we like them or not. We know that the current makeup of 
the Congress does completely satisfy anyone. Yet, this is our 
Congress, and no one ought to leave the party because the 
results do not satisfy them. We should all stay in the Front so 
that we can continue to push the positions we hold inside it. 
  2. Without unity the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation 
Front] has no chance of success in the 1996 elections. True, the 
revolutionary struggle does not end with the next elections. 
However, winning them, on our own or in an alliance, is 
decisive, vital, and strategic. Without FSLN unity, any chance 
of having a policy for victory becomes illusory and nonexistent. 
<H5>  United Amid Diversity </H5>
  3. At this Congress we must reaffirm the pluralistic nature 
of Sandinism. United amid diversity must be our conviction. 
Accepting internal pluralism means that it is not enough to 
continue being revolutionaries; we will also have to become more 
democratic. The culture of political tolerance must be developed 
first in the party and then made compatible with the entire 
society. 
  Each force has a legitimate right to seek predominance in 
the 
party, but this should not give rise to moves to exclude anyone. 
Those who wish to leave of their own free will should do so. But 
exclusion, ostracism, and expulsion cannot be political methods 
of settling differences. 
  4. We must all pledge to respect our code of political 
ethics 
for debate. A steadfast defense of positions cannot turn into a 
pretext for political attacks on individuals, factions, or 
forums. Frank debates yes, personal attacks no. We must give 
society an example of what we mean by discussion and ideological 
political debate. 
  5. The FSLN needs a new identity. There have been many 
changes in Nicaragua and the world. The FSLN has to define its 
new revolutionary look in this new stage. The definition of this 
new content cannot be targeted solely at internal party life. 
  In defining our new identity, we will also be defining 
ourselves vis-a-vis society. The new face of Sandinism has to be 
the appealing face of the nation's leading political force, 
which can offer and insure peace, stability, the rule of law, 
social justice, and economic well-being. 
<H5>  Ruling Out the Armed Struggle </H5>
  6. The FSLN does not give priority, a priori, to any one 
method of struggle over another. Its policy in this regard ought 
to be: the efficient combined use of all methods of struggle, 
excluding only the armed struggle. The priority of one method 
over another will be determined by the circumstances and 
peculiarities of the struggle in question. The important thing 
is to acknowledge the principle of efficiently combining all 
methods. 
  7. The FSLN has a preferential social option for the poor, 
who represent the majority in our nation. An approach that 
excludes the other social sectors and classes does not follow 
from this substantive principle, however. A priority means a 
priority, not exclusivity. The FSLN attaches great importance to 
all production sectors that are willing to work and invest to 
rebuild and revive the national economy. 
  8. We acknowledge the existence of the struggle among 
interests and classes in society, but we do not conclude, a 
priori, from this that the national bourgeoisie will be our 
mortal enemy. Those who are prepared to work for the rule of law 
with political and economic democracy and social justice will 
find in Sandinism a serious, responsible interlocutor and a 
strong ally in opposing the capricious economic policies of the 
current government, which are crushing producers, merchants, and 
production in general. 
<H5>  [25 March] </H5>
  9. The governments of the United States have sponsored 
interventions against and authoritarian, aggressive regimes in 
our country. We cannot forget this. Nevertheless, the United 
States is the most profitable market for the products that a 
developing Nicaraguan economy would put out. The American people 
are not and never have been our enemy. We are willing to work 
consistently to hammer out lasting agreements with the U.S. 
Government for a new type of relationship based on international 
law and respect for the sovereignty of the Nicaraguan nation. 
  10. No sector of Sandinism is calling for the 
nationalization 
of the economy or the doctrine of the single party or communism 
as Sandinism's ideology. What Sandinism opposes uncompromisingly 
is neoliberalism, as we try to push an alternative economic 
agenda based on actual conditions in Nicaragua. Accordingly, we 
Sandinists propose the agenda of the new economic players as a 
challenge to society. 
  Just as we respect private property, we demand the 
progressive right to promote and encourage the democratization 
of ownership. We promote and encourage all forms of associative, 
communal, and cooperative ownership, the APT [Workers Ownership 
Sector], and joint ventures as new elements in an economic 
democratization that offers an alternative to the voracity of 
brutal capitalism. 
  11. We Sandinists acknowledge the existence and legitimacy 
of 
individual leaders in our party at all levels. Above and beyond 
personal merits, these leaderships, which have different degrees 
and looks, are the fruit of the collective revolutionary 
struggle of the FSLN. In this regard, our main leader is the 
people and our party. 
<H5>  Turnover of Leadership </H5>
  We advocate the efficient turnover of leaders at all levels 
and the right to recall leaders in accordance with the FSLN's 
bylaws. However, a true turnover that goes beyond the necessary 
replacement of individuals means an updating of our program and 
forms of organization, innovative work methods, and above all, 
creative methods of struggle. 
  12. The involvement of women in the struggle of the FSLN has 
been unquestionable, but their presence in leadership bodies has 
been stemmed. This situation must be resolved positively at the 
Congress; in so doing, we will not only be serving justice but 
also strengthening the Sandinist Front. In regard to this latter 
point, young people are legitimately demanding their priority 
place in the Sandinist agenda. 
  13. We Sandinists cannot remain indifferent to the obvious 
signs of the renewed outbreak of Somozism. We cannot tolerate 
any attempt to return to a revanchist, authoritarian, 
neo-Somozist government. This would represent a return to 
political instability, and we must call for the broadest 
alliance to confront this number one enemy of the nation's peace 
and stability. 
  14. The Sandinists Front's most important material asset is 
the property in the hands of individual peasants, cooperative 
members, retirees, and worker enterprises. The defense of this 
asset is our main task. Nevertheless, this Congress will have to 
clarify the status of the party's assets proper once and for all. 
  15. The FSLN must come out decisively and definitively for 
the autonomy of the Atlantic Coast and the regulation thereof. 
The wealth and resources of the coast must benefit those 
communities first and foremost and must support a regional 
government that acts to serve this purpose. 
  16. All of the above will not guarantee renewal unless the 
FSLN truly begins to play its role as the main opposition party. 
Consequently, anything that smacks of joint government must 
disappear quickly and definitively from our political conduct.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with President-elect Armando Calderon </F>
Sol in San Salvador by Guillermo Rodriguez in Santa Fe de Bogota 
on 25 April; from the "Caracol's 0600-0900" newscast -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Rodriguez] Good morning, Dr. Calderon. 
Congratulations on your victory. 
  [Calderon] Thank you very much. Thank you also for Radio 
Caracol's coverage of these elections and for being present in 
our country, your efforts to unite the America's, and our 
brother nations of Colombia and El Salvador. I would like to 
say that I have become and will continue to be a servant of the 
Salvadoran people. In addition, I am at the disposal of the 
Colombian people. 
  [Rodriguez] Dr. Calderon, are you now extending an olive 
branch to those who not so long ago were your political rivals? 
  [Calderon] Yes, I am extending my hand to all the Salvadoran 
people. I am no longer the presidential candidate but the 
president of all Salvadorans; those who voted and those who did 
not vote for me. I have become the president and head of state 
of El Salvador who is going to work for all Salvadorans, 
regardless of their political affiliation or ideology. I plan 
to work for all Salvadorans. In this respect, I also extend my 
hand and call on all the political sectors that in spite of 
their positions of genuine and conscientious opposition, to 
grant me the opportunity to govern El Salvador. 
  [Rodriguez] Dr. Calderon, since we Colombians are not 
fortunate enough to know you that well, and we expect to see you 
shortly in Colombia, briefly tell us something about Armando 
Calderon Sol. 
  [Calderon] Armando Calderon Sol is a fighter. A fighter for 
peace, progress, and liberty in El Salvador. Armando Calderon 
Sol is a relatively young politician who entered the political 
scene at an early age as a result of the chaos and anarchy that 
prevailed in El Salvador. I have been the mayor of San Salvador 
for two consecutive terms. I was deputy to the National 
Assembly. I have been a fighter for the defense of liberty in 
our country. I am a conservative, and I believe that populism 
and demagoguery have done too much harm to our country as well 
as to Latin America. Those past populist and demagogue leaders 
who interfered on so many occasions and believed in socialist 
solutions only encouraged corruption and discredit to the 
countries. I believe there is a new ideological rebirth taking 
place. It is a rebirth of conservative ideas, and it is a 
rebirth for everyone where liberty prevails. Pragmatism and 
ideologies have been discarded. 
  [Rodriguez] There is no doubt Dr. Armando Calderon, that 
that 
is how it is. Now we will speak to Armando Calderon Sol, the 
statesman. What will your first government task be? What does 
El Salvador most urgently need? 
  [Calderon] I believe my first task should be to consolidate 
the state of law, peace, and social harmony. We must ensure 
social peace. We have been able to silence the weapons; we have 
accomplished peace in the country, now we need a genuine social 
peace. To ensure this, we have to assert the state of law in 
this country and we have to consolidate it. Actions should be 
directed to this purpose. We must validate our goodwill. We 
must also improve police performance, and create the conditions 
of citizens safety all Salvadorans are demanding. We must 
provide all Salvadorans safety for their lives and property. It 
is unacceptable for us to come out of political violence and 
then fall prey to common violence. 
  [Rodriguez] What is pending in the peace process that your 
government must meet so the process can have credibility in the 
eyes of your nation and the international community. 
  [Calderon Sol] I believe, on our part, there is a great deal 
of willingness to fulfill the peace agreements. I believe these 
agreements are [word indistinct]; they are agreements belonging 
to the whole nation and they must be faithfully kept. The only 
issue left unresolved is the total and absolute dissolution of 
the National Police and for the National Civilian Police to be 
deployed throughout the territory. This is our recently 
organized constitutional institution that will give security to 
the citizens nationwide. 
  We, in our future government, have made a commitment to 
totally support the National Civilian Police, support its new 
Police Academy, and as soon as possible dissolve the National 
Police and have the National Civilian Police operating at full 
strength. 
  The other pending issues are some recommendations by the 
Truth Commission, such as the improvement in Salvadoran justice 
and the improvement in the administration of justice. We all 
agree on this, there is national consensus that for Salvador's 
social peace, for the consolidation of the process, it needs 
speedy and efficient justice; Salvadoran justice must be 
improved. In terms of this we have the political willingness to 
implement constitutional reforms that will bring better and more 
efficient justice to the Salvadoran people. 
  [Rodriguez] What type of economic, political, diplomatic, 
and 
integration relations are you going to maintain with nations 
such as the Andean Group? 
  [Calderon Sol] We want to have very close trade relations 
with Colombia and the Andean Group. What is more, we would like 
a true integration of America as a whole. We have this very 
clear idea in our mind, this very clear idea that you have 
upheld; that is the Bolivarian idea. We believe that NAFTA has 
to spread to all the Americas, and we should struggle for a true 
economic integration to enter the world's largest world market 
which is and will be the United States with Canada and Mexico. 
All the Americas should form a true integration. In this way, 
all the nations of the Americas, this immortal America, will 
have true integration, the overcoming of difficulties, and 
sustained development. 
  [Rodriguez] The opposition points to you as a right-wing man 
linked to processes already overcome in El Salvador. What can 
be done for El Salvador to recover that lost unity so that 
yesterday's opposition can work, if not in the government, at 
least to the benefit of El Salvador as a whole. 
  [Calderon Sol] I believe we have made a great deal of 
progress. Peace is gaining more ground each day. It is being 
consolidated; it is being strengthened. Currently, with the 
political participation in this 20 March historical event, the 
radical left wing, the left wing that destroyed infrastructure, 
that caused destruction during the war, finally participated in 
this political event. It has been able to open the road for its 
political participation. They won 21 deputy seats in a 
parliament of 84 deputies. Former commanders, the majority, 
former commanders of the Salvadoran guerrillas are in our 
Legislative Assembly.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Zelada at the Presidente Hotel in San </F>
Salvador; from the "YSU Radio News" newscast -- live relay] 
  [Text] We are at the Presidente Hotel where the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal [TSE] vote counting center is located. There 
was apparently little activity this morning. Nevertheless, 
President-elect Armando Calderon Sol and Ruben Zamora, the 
leftist coalition candidate, held a meeting which was attended 
by TSE magistrates. They also received a delegation led by U.S. 
Ambassador Alan Flanigan, Mrs. Ann Patterson of the Latin 
American division of the State Department, and AID officials in 
the country, with whom they exchanged viewpoints on El 
Salvador's future, the continuation of economic aid, and other 
aspects of our country's economic and political situation. At 
the end of this morning's meeting, Dr. Ruben Zamora spoke to the 
media about some of the points discussed during the more than 
two-hour-long meeting here at the Presidente Hotel. Here is an 
excerpt of his remarks: 
  [Begin recording] [Zamora] The first step was this 
conversation we just had. It was a general exploration in which 
we perhaps insisted more about the issue of electoral reform. 
This is one of the immediate issues that must be addressed in 
the next few months. We also discussed other points such as the 
decentralization of the government, the single registry of 
citizens, and so forth. I would say that in the next few days 
we will be announcing the agenda and how this will be done. 
  [Unidentified reporter] How much is Calderon Sol willing to 
work on this? 
  [Zamora] He expressed willingness to work and he agreed with 
me that in order for the country to move forward, the government 
and the opposition must agree on such points and work together. 
  [Reporter] Do you think [words indistinct] and that the 
opposition, which you make up, is being taken into account? 
  [Zamora] I think that both for the government and the 
opposition, these are two elements that are absolutely 
essential. Today's meeting was due to an initiative taken 
yesterday. When we talked with Dr. Calderon Sol yesterday he 
said: Why don't we meet a while? I said fine. That is what we 
did this morning. We agreed that we will remain in touch to 
deal with this problem. I think this is part of democracy. 
There will be a government; there must always be a government, 
but there must also be an opposition. When there is a 
government without opposition, there tends to be a dictatorship. 
A characteristic of democracy is the existence of a government 
and opposition. 
  [Reporter] Any commitments [words indistinct]? 
  [Zamora] This was an initial conversation. The commitment 
was that we have to structure this agenda of concerted efforts. 
Some ideas were expressed about how we can do this. But since 
we have not agreed on this yet, we are going to see how things 
develop. [end recording] 
  Jorge Shafik Handal, general coordinator of the Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN], and other members of the 
leftist coalition formed by the MNR [National Revolutionary 
Movement], the Democratic Convergence, and the FMLN, were also 
present at the meeting. Dr. Armando Calderon Sol remains on the 
second floor of the hotel, where he is meeting with TSE members 
to complete some minor details about the documents for his 
inauguration.

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Teresa Fajardo from the "YSU Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Today, President Alfredo Cristiani said one of the 
priorities of the government of the president elected on 24 
April will be to promote the country's social and economic 
development and to constantly struggle against corruption; this 
will ensure the continuity of a government under the 
responsibility of ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance], 
Cristiani said when expressing his willingness to support and 
advise Armando Calderon Sol throughout the next five years. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] Making a good government is 
obviously necessary, and a good government must attend to the 
people's needs. We have made a lot of progress in the political 
field. The process is practically running itself. In the 
economic area, the new government must continue to promote 
development and trust. The macroeconomy has reached a level 
where this is possible. I believe the most important thing is to 
continue to stress the importance of helping the people, the 
social area. Mainly, we must continue to support education, 
health, housing, and all those programs aimed at solving the 
people's problems. 
  The other day, when we were distributing checks at the 
Reconstruction Secretariat, we said that at the government level 
plans, very big plans, are made in general terms; because of 
this, many times the people's needs are overlooked. For the 
government, these needs may seem very small, but for the people 
they are very important. Therefore, it is very important for the 
government to continue supporting institutions, such as the 
Reconstruction Secretariat, the Social Investment Fund, and the 
Family Secretariat. Fortunately, the Social Investment Fund is 
negotiating more loans, and the Inter-American Development Bank 
seems willing to give this organization a third loan that will 
help the Social Investment Fund until it can begin making its 
own money. 
  I also believe we must constantly work to eradicate 
corruption. Corruption may not be as common in the United 
States, but we are constantly hearing of scandals of corruption 
in developed countries. Japan has had serious problems with 
corruption. What can we say of Brazil? Therefore, this is 
something against which we must constantly struggle to ensure 
its disappearance, but we must not only struggle for corruption 
to disappear but also so that it will not reappear. Making the 
same mistake is very easy. [end recording] 
  President Cristiani explained his earlier statements on the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberal Front's [FMLN] imminent 
division in the assembly: 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] They have kept the FMLN united 
due to the need to present themselves as a sole political force 
in the elections, not as a divided force. I do believe, 
however, everyone here knows there are big differences among the 
various factions. We do believe division will eventually occur, 
and each group will adopt a more individual position as was 
foreseen from the very moment the FMLN registered its charter. 
They have described themselves as a party of several 
persuasions. There are five different persuasions within the 
party, and that is where the problem lies. They will now have 
to adopt specific positions, and we will now begin to see those 
differences. I believe five factions will be making separate 
decisions; this does not mean they will vote together at certain 
times, but we will see a difference in the way they make their 
decisions. 
  I believe the parties that form the coalition will have to 
make a political analysis for the future. Had the Democratic 
Convergence run alone in these elections, it would not have done 
very well. They only won one seat in the assembly. If the 
coalition breaks up, the Democratic Convergence runs the risk of 
losing its status of political party because the votes it would 
receive in an election would not be enough. A similar situation 
is confronted by the National Revolutionary Movement. If there 
is a division within the FMLN where the various tendencies 
separate, we would even see a reorganization within the party. 
[end recording] 
  Regarding the abstentions reported during the 24 April 
elections, President Cristiani expressed regret this is being 
used to hinder the electoral process, adding this is not 
something unusual when a runoff is convoked.

<F P=106> [Report by Ernesto Lopez from the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA] crowned 
its successes in El Salvador by winning 24 April's presidential 
elections. During the first round of elections, the party had 
already ensured control of the assembly as well as a majority in 
the country's local governments. The party will now be 
responsible for leading the country through a key phase of 
economic recovery and consolidation of peace. 
  With Armando Calderon Sol as president, ARENA has agreed to 
encourage a government of national accord in order to continue 
advancing in the process of pacification, democratization, and 
implementation of an economic adjustment program. It is 
expected that in addition to macroeconomic stability, the 
economic program will also ensure an improvement in the 
standards of living of the 5.6 million Salvadorans. 
  Calderon Sol was elected 24 April with 68 percent of the 
votes, as opposed to the 32 percent received by his closest 
adversary, Democratic Convergence candidate Ruben Zamora. The 
new president promised to ensure the participation of all forces 
which support the governability and political stability of the 
country, which ended a bloody war in 1992 that lasted more than 
a decade. 
  With 39 of 84 seats, ARENA will control the Legislative 
Assembly through a simply majority of 44 seats, as a result of 
obtaining the support of the right-wing National Conciliation 
Party, which obtained four seats in the elections. 
  The former guerrilla group Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front [FMLN], which won 21 seats during the 20 March 
parliamentary elections, has stated it believes ARENA will 
control the legislative branch with intolerance, despite 
assurances it is planning to seek an accommodation with all the 
political parties. 
  ARENA also secured clear-cut control over the local 
governments by winning 206 of the 262 municipal offices open to 
elections. The Christian Democratic Party was able to secure 29 
municipal offices; the FMLN won 16, and the Authentic Christian 
Movement was only able to win one mayoral office. 
  Monday, Calderon Sol said that with these results, ARENA has 
further consolidated itself as the country's leading political 
force. He added its main opposition will now be the FMLN, which 
has become the second leading political option as a result of 
its strong showing in the elections. 
  ARENA was founded in September 1981 by deceased Major 
Roberto 
d'aubuisson, who was cited by the Truth Commission as the 
organizer of the death squads, which assassinated an unspecified 
number of individuals during the past decade for political 
reasons.

<F P=106> [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Today, Salvadoran Foreign Minister Miguel Angel 
Salaverria said future president Armando Calderon Sol, the 
winner of the 25 April elections, will comply fully with 
commitments that remain pending from the peace agreements. The 
peace agreements, signed two years ago, put an end to the bloody 
civil war in this Central American nation. In an interview with 
the media, Salaverria noted that no one can ignore an 
international agreement involving the international community, 
represented by the United Nations, because to lie to or ignore 
the United Nations is a very serious offense. Salaverria added 
that Calderon Sol has already committed himself to fully comply 
with any issues pending from the peace agreements signed with 
the guerrillas. 
  After declaring himself the winner of the elections on 
Sunday 
night, Calderon indicated that his first mission will be to 
consolidate peace, and in doing so, he will begin a dialogue 
with the opposition represented by the former guerrilla movement 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, among other political 
forces. 
  Calderon Sol also announced that he will travel to New York 
in May, when he will meet with UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali to discuss the peace process and convey his 
intention of fulfilling the commitments of the peace agreements.

  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani has acknowledged 
organized crime is operating to some extent in the country, 
adding his government is making efforts to combat that social 
scourge. Cristiani has promised to get to the bottom of this 
problem by disbanding the gangs, which, according to certain 
sectors of the nation, operate a vast network in Central 
America. It appears the administration that will assume power 
in May will inherit one of the country's most violent social 
problems: organized criminal gangs. 
  On 20 April, Cristiani acknowledged the existence of those 
groups, and he said efforts are being made to eliminate them; no 
mention was made, however, of what had been achieved so far. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] Besides these armed groups, we 
have the problem of car thefts, which is highly organized. We 
have been painstakingly following up on the car theft problem. 
Drug trafficking is another organized crime that has not 
reached the levels observed in other places. [end recording] 
  During the news conference, the president also mentioned the 
status of compliance with the peace agreements, which, according 
to Cristiani, has made progress. According to the president, 
his government is making the effort to clear his desk and 
resolve any pending issues. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] As of now, some pending issues 
concern certain decisions on the deployment of the National 
Civilian Police and the demobilization of the National Police. 
We hope that before 31 May, this issue will also be resolved, 
so that only the specifics, the concept of operations, will be 
left. [end recording] 
  Cristiani will leave the Presidency in the coming months, 
perhaps leaving behind the halfway completed issue of land 
transfers, an agreement which will be passed to the future 
president.

<F P=106> [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] On Thursday, the Legislative Assembly approved 48 
reforms to the Labor Code. The reforms were agreed upon during 
the recent Forum for Economic and Social Consensus. It also 
approved the creation of a Higher Council of Labor and the 
prompt resumption of work at the Forum for Economic and Social 
Consensus to deal with several pending issues. 
  Deputies of the Political and Labor and Social Welfare 
Commissions issued the surprise approvals, which were in turn 
approved by all political sectors represented at the Assembly. 
The reforms recognize the existence of trade, business, 
industrial, and independent contractor unions. The Ministry of 
Labor will aid in forming these organizations. The unions will 
be prohibited from denying nonunion workers the right to 
employment, [forcibly] enrolling such workers in unions, or 
refusing them the right to resign from unions. There will be 
penalties for those who violate the code's provisions. 
  [San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish at 1800 GMT on 22 
April reports that the National Peasant-Worker Union, UNOC, 
expressed its disagreement with some of the reforms. UNOC 
leaders believe "the Legislative Assembly has taken a step that 
may not prove very positive for the working class in general." 
They added that some of the reforms "are detrimental to worker 
interests." The reforms, they say, were hastily approved to 
meet "a requirement of the foreign trade authorities of the 
United States."]

  [Text] San Salvador, 24 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- A MNR [National 
Revolutionary Movement] spokesperson announced here today that 
MNR Secretary General Victor Valle has resigned. The 
spokesperson added that Jorge Pinto, a former member of the 
party's political commission, assumed Valle's post three days 
ago. 
  The MNR, the Democratic Convergence, and the former 
guerrilla 
movement Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front make up the 
leftist coalition participating in the run-off presidential 
elections that began this morning. The MNR ran by itself in the 
20 March elections for deputies and mayors and lost. 
  Valle said that many obligations, which he did not specify, 
prompted his resignation. 
  Today, Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate for the leftist 
coalition, called Valle's resignation an act of treason and 
blamed it on the defeat the MNR suffered in the March elections. 
  None of the candidates of the parties participating in the 
run-off elections received the required majority in March -- 
half of the total votes cast plus one -- to win the presidency. 
The Supreme Electoral Tribunal convened a second election 
between the two leading presidential candidates. Thus, Zamora 
and Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate for the ruling 
Nationalist Republican Alliance, are today competing for the 
presidency for the 1994-99 period.

  [Text] San Salvador, 22 Apr (AFP) -- Spokesmen for the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN] have reported 
that early this morning unidentified persons dynamited two 
antennas the organization was going to use for internal 
communication purposes during the presidential elections 
scheduled to take place Sunday. 
  FMLN coordinator Shafik Handal and his aid Marcos Jimenez 
said during a news conference that "the destruction of the 
antennas" in the central department of San Vicente, 60 km east 
of San Salvador, "has put us in a difficult position" for 
Sunday's elections. The two FMLN leaders also charged that 
militants of the governing Nationalist Republican Alliance 
[ARENA] (rightist) have been waging a "dirty war" since 
Thursday, the day unidentified persons destroyed opposition 
propaganda posters and distributed "counterfeit propaganda." 
  This Friday, unidentified persons issued death threats 
against Francisco Lima, a rich businessman and attorney, who is 
the vice presidential candidate of the leftist coalition to 
which the FMLN belongs. 
  Handal reiterated that the FMLN will participate in Sunday's 
elections despite these difficulties, because "it has medium- 
and long-term objectives, and we do not want to give up the 
contest." The leader urged all Salvadorans to go to the polls. 
He noted that "it is very important to counterbalance ARENA and 
defend the rights of the poor." 
  The FMLN forms part of the alliance that also includes the 
Democratic Convergence and the National Revolutionary Movement 
and supports the presidential ticket of Ruben Zamora and 
Francisco Lima.

  [Text] San Salvador, 23 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, the 
Salvadoran left-wing coalition described the death threats 
against Vice Presidential Candidate Franciso Lima as a "dirty" 
trick by the ruling ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] 
party. Lima, who is 76 years old, said telephone calls had been 
received over the last few hours warning him of an attack on his 
home. 
  Lima and coalition presidential candidate Ruben Zamora said 
during a news conference that the calls were made to an office 
of the former Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) 
guerrillas and to the home of party coordinator Shafik Handal. 
The vice presidential hopeful recalled that Jose Maria Mendez, a 
lawyer friend, was threatened a few months ago with an attack 
against his wife if he did not help convince Lima to give up his 
FMLN candidacy. 
  Lima, an attorney and successful businessman, expressed 
concern over these events, especially after the police increased 
his security because "if they are worried, it is only natural 
that I should be worried; it is me they want to see buried." 
  Ruben Zamora said that in addition to the threats against 
Lima, FMLN radio repeaters in San Salvador and the Chinchontepec 
Volcanoes were sabotaged over the last few days, which "does not 
contribute to the atmosphere of peace" that should prevail 
during the elections. Zamora, who is 52 years old, will compete 
for the presidency for the second time against the ruling ARENA 
party candidate.

<F P=106> [Article by Juan Luis Batista] </F>
  [Text] After the "presidential secret" was disclosed, polls 
are showing a trend that favors Ruben Blades, while Ernesto 
Perez Balladares continues to lose ground. A special election 
poll contracted by LA PRENSA with the Dichter and Neira/Lou 
Harris consulting firm shows Ernesto Perez Balladares of the 
Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) has lost 6 percent, while 
Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro Movement has gained 7.5 percent. 
  The previous poll conducted by the same firm, which was 
published on 15 April, showed Perez Balladres with 34.5 percent 
and Blades with 17.3 percent. Now, Perez Balladares has 28.4 
percent and Blades has 24.8 percent. Blades is 3.6 percent short 
of catching up with Perez Balladares. 
  At the end of March, Perez Balladares had 39.5 percent of 
the 
vote, while Blades had 14.4 percent, much less than Ruben Dario 
Carles, who at that time registered 20.5 percent. 
  The new poll was conducted between Friday, 22 April and 
Saturday, 23 April. The poll, which was conducted on an random 
social cross-section with the participation of 1,209 people who 
displayed a willingness to vote, surveyed residents living in 
national territory by way of face-to-face interviews. Of the 
1,209 people polled, 696 live in urban areas while 513 live in 
rural areas. 
  The specific question asked was: "If the presidential 
elections were held today, who would you vote for?" The total 
results in order of preference are as follows: Perez Balladares, 
28.4 percent; Blades, 24.8 percent; Carles, 16.2 percent; Mireya 
Moscoso de Gruber, 14.3 percent; Eduardo Vallarino, 2.3 percent; 
Samuel Lewis Galindo, 1.4 percent; and Jose Salvador Munoz, 0.2 
percent. Meanwhile, the answers of "do not know," "no one," and 
"no answer" total 12.2 percent. 
  Another trend observed in the last Dichter &amp; Neira poll 
is 
Carles' decline. At the end of March he registered 20.5 
percent; in the middle of April, 18.6 percent; and now 16.2 
percent. Meanwhile, Moscoso de Gruber, like Blades, is gaining 
in the polls, albeit at a lower level. At the end of March, she 
had 10.5 percent, in the middle of April 11.3 percent, and now 
14.3 percent. 
  It can be noted that in Panama Province, Blades has greater 
acceptance (28.8 percent) than in the rest of the nation (20.1 
percent). Meanwhile, Perez Balladares in Panama Province 
registers 30.5 percent, while in the countryside he registers 26 
percent. 
  Another difference can be seen among the various age groups. 
Among the younger generation between the ages of 18 and 29, 
Blades registers 36 percent while Perez Balladares registers 
30.2 percent. 
<H5>  After the Video </H5>
  It should be noted that this is the first LA PRENSA poll 
after the release of the "presidential secret," a videotape in 
which the previous regime's "confessions" of corruption appear. 
In the video, Tomas Altamirano Duque, first vice presidential 
candidate on the PRD ticket, is shown saying that because there 
was no money, nationalism had to be touted. Nationalism was the 
core of the PRD and the military's propaganda machine in the 
1989 elections. 
  In recent days, Altamirano Duque has publicly declared that 
all governments rob and that he had not participated in business 
deals with former dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega, not because 
he did not want to but, rather, because Noriega had not asked 
him to. 
  Carles' and Moscoso de Gruber's campaigns have concentrated 
on attacking the PRD. Meanwhile, Blades has been calling on the 
people to vote for Papa Egoro in an effort not to continue "this 
war of insults and accusations over the next five years." 
  In another turn of events, although the PRD has not changed 
the substance of its campaign, it has devoted a good portion of 
its television adds to attacking the president's position. 
Meanwhile, nearly all of the PRD members who appears in the 
video have felt compelled to "explain," in one way or another, 
their participation in the previous regime. 
  President Guillermo Endara was questioned by various sectors 
that felt the release of the video comprised direct meddling in 
partisan politics. Other sectors, however, contend the 
president acted correctly because, otherwise, he would have 
become "an accessory after the fact." 
  After the video was aired, some sectors who opposed the 
previous military regime called for civic unity aimed at 
defeating the PRD in the 8 May elections. Nevertheless, up 
until yesterday, Sunday, nothing specific had been achieved. 
Meanwhile, the PRD has said the 1994 elections cannot be won 
with the same arguments used in the 1989 elections. 
  Taking into account the possibility of an alliance among the 
civic groups, the last poll posed the following question: "If 
there were an alliance, and if the only candidates were Blades, 
Vallarino, Lewis Galindo, and Munoz, who would you vote for?" 
[sentence as published] 
  The following is the result: Blades, 38.5 percent; Perez 
Balladares, 29.8 percent; Vallarino, 7.3 percent; Lewis Galindo, 
4.2 percent; Munoz 0.05 percent; do not know, 6.6 percent; no 
reply, 1.9 percent; and none of them, 11.1 percent. 
  Now, assuming Ruben Carles and Eduardo Vallarino were not 
included, when asked the same question, the following results 
were achieved: Blades, 31.8 percent; Perez Balladares, 29.2 
percent; Moscoso de Gruber, 21.4 percent; Lewis Galindo, 3.2 
percent; Munoz, 0.3 percent; do not know, 6.2 percent; no reply, 
2 percent; and none of them, 5.9 percent. 
<H5>  Struggle Among the Minorities </H5>
  What all of the polls conducted in the past few days show is 
that there is a struggle among the four minorities: those who 
support Ernesto Perez Balladares (United People alliance), those 
who support Ruben Blades (Papa Egoro), those who support Ruben 
Dario Carles (Change '94), and those who support Mireya Moscoso 
de Gruber (Democratic Alliance). The other large group of 
respondents comprises those who are undecided ("do not know," 
"no reply," and "none of them"), which totals 12.2 percent. 
  Over the past weekend, all of the candidates' campaigns 
staged caravans, rallies, and street celebrations. 
  In light of the statistics, the 8 May 1994 elections will 
have two candidates with real chances: Ruben Blades, the 
composer-singer, and Ernesto Perez Balladares, the businessman.

  [Excerpts] The popularity of Ernesto Perez Balladares, 
presidential candidate for the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary 
Party], has declined, while that of Ruben Blades of Papa Egoro 
Movement [MPE] increased abruptly, according to a special poll 
conducted by the Dichter and Neira firm. 
  When asked who they would vote for if the presidential 
elections were held today, 28.4 percent of those polled said 
they would vote for the PRD candidate, 24.8 percent for Blades, 
16.2 percent for Carles, 14.3 percent for De Gruber, 2.3 percent 
for Vallarino, 1.4 percent for Lewis Galindo, and 0.2 percent 
for Munoz. 
  According to the latest three polls, support for the PRD 
candidate among voters has been continually declining. Although 
Perez Balladares remains in the lead with only 3.6 percentage 
points over Blades, his popularity level continues to decline. 
According to the latest poll conducted at the national level 
between 8 and 10 April, Perez Balladares' popularity level was 
set at 34.5 percent. In this same poll, Blades (third place) 
registered 17.3 percent of voters' support, Carles (second 
place) 18.6 percent, and De Gruber (fourth place) 11.3 percent. 
  This survey is based on a aleatory sample of 1,209 
individual 
interviews administered on a face-to-face basis by the 
interviewer among residents of the Republic of Panama, age 18 or 
older. LA PRENSA ordered the survey to be conducted after 
President Guillermo Endara aired some videos of the previous 
military regime over a national television network in which the 
acts of corruption of the military government that remained in 
power for over two decades were unveiled. 
  Meanwhile, singer Blades ranked first among voters' 
preferences in the special poll, when asked who they would vote 
for in case a civic alliance led by Ruben Carles was formed, 
while Perez Balladares's popularity for the 8 May election 
continued to slide. Blades got 30.5 percent of voter support, 
Perez Balladares obtained 29.5 percent, Carles 23.2 percent, 
Samuel Lewis Galindo 2.8 percent, and Jose Salvador Munoz 0.5 
percent of the preferences. The aforementioned voters were 
asked: In case there is an alliance and the candidates were 
only Blades, Perez Balladares, Carles, Lewis Galindo, and Jose 
Salvador Munoz, who would you vote for? 
  According to the poll, in case Mireya Moscoso de Gruber led 
the civic alliance, Blades would remain in the lead with 31.8 
percent, Perez Balladares would get 29.2 percent, the Arnulfist 
Party candidate 21.4 percent, Lewis Galindo 3.2 percent, and 
Munoz 0.3 percent. 
  If Eduardo Vallarino presided over said civic alliance, 
however, the singer would garner 38.5 percent of the vote, Perez 
Balladares 29.8 percent, the Christian Democratic Party 
candidate only 7.3 percent, Lewis Galindo 4.2 percent, and Munoz 
0.5 percent. 
  When asked who they would vote for if the elections were 
held 
today, 28.4 percent of those polled said they would vote for the 
PRD candidate, 24.8 percent for Blades, 16.2 percent for Carles, 
14.3 percent for De Gruber, 2.3 percent for Vallarino, 1.4 
percent for Lewis Galindo, and 0.2 percent for Munoz. [passage 
omitted] 
  The margin of error of this survey is 3 percent. The poll 
was it was conducted 22 and 23 April.

<F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Alvarado; from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The Papa Egoro Movement today reiterated its 
decision not to support any political group linked with the 
country's past or present. The Papa Egoro Movement bases its 
political independence on what it considers the crisis in which 
the country finds itself and which has been generated, in its 
opinion, by the attitude of the traditional parties that have 
governed Panama. Raul Leis, secretary general of the movement, 
maintains that they respect the initiative of some political 
parties to seek unity. 
  [Begin Leis recording] We must greet that type of 
initiative, 
rather than attack it. We must greet it with respect. It is a 
democratic, free initiative of the parties. Sincerely, however, 
we see it as having a very fragile basis, because it is not 
based on a specific government platform or on a genuine effort 
at rapprochement, but is rather an anti-effort, a position 
against another party. The Papa Egoro Movement has always had a 
position that is not anti anything, but rather a pro-Panama 
position. [end recording] 
  Leis ruled out the possibility that the Papa Egoro 
Movement's 
position is directed at favoring the PRD, because there is no 
connection between the two parties. During the news conference, 
Mariela Arce announced the holding of an event as homage to 
mother earth, which has been organized by the Papa Egoro 
Movement for this coming Saturday, 23 April, in Parque Urraca 
beginning at 1400. This event anticipates the participation of 
a large number of national groups that will participate with 
presidential candidate Ruben Blades and his orchestra as well as 
his government team.

  [Text] A recent investigation carried out by LA ESTRELLA DE 
PANAMA disclosed that the Electoral Tribunal has determined that 
the sale of all alcoholic beverages and the use of firearms will 
be prohibited beginning 7 May. By mean of two decrees, the 
Electoral Tribunal established that all bars, nightclubs, and 
dance halls are to remain closed as of 1200 on Saturday, 7 May, 
until 1200 on 9 May. The sale of wine, beer, and other fermented 
beverages have also been banned during this 72-hour [as 
published] period. 
  With respect to the use of firearms, the Electoral Tribunal 
determined that private citizens are barred from carrying 
firearms from 8 May until after 9 May, with the exception of the 
police authorities who by virtue of their responsibilities are 
required to carry arms. The decree warns that any person caught 
violating these firearms restrictions will be penalized by 
having the weapons confiscated and being given fines ranging 
from 10 to 250 balboas. On the other hand, the Government and 
Justice Ministry decided to prohibit the importation of all 
hunting weapons between during the period 31 March and 31 May of 
the current year. 
  Individuals violating these decrees will remain in the 
custody of the National Police until 31 May 1994. These decrees 
are aimed at ensuring citizen's harmony as well as respect and 
order for the individual's constitutional rights during the 8 
May election process.

<F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino left 
this afternoon on an official mission to Moscow, Russia. Mulino 
is accompanied by Fernando Eleta Almaran, an industrialist and 
important member of the National Foreign Affairs Council. It is 
the first time in history that a Panamanian foreign minister is 
visiting Russia and is an attempt to increase the diplomatic 
rank between the two nations. Also accompanying Foreign 
Minister Mulino are Graciela de Eleta, Eloy Alfaro, and Juan 
Pablo Fabrega. While in the diplomatic lounge at Tocumen 
International Airport in Panama City, Russian Consul General 
(Anatoliy Kaskov) said that strengthening ties translates into 
many benefits for the two countries. 
  [Begin (Kaskov) recording] Our foreign minister and your 
foreign minister will sign very important documents that will 
facilitate our relations. This is why I can say this is a 
historic visit in relations between our two countries. I can 
also say they are going to study every aspect of our relations, 
including political, economic, and, above all, diplomatic 
relations. [end recording] 
  According to Panamanian Foreign Minister Mulino, this 
working 
trip to Moscow represents establishing diplomatic relations at 
the embassy level. Mulino said Flavio Mendez is the Panamanian 
ambassador to Moscow and now Russia must appoint its ambassador 
to Panama. 
  [Begin Mulino recording] We will also discuss immigration 
issues, the possibilities of establishing cooperation agreements 
in the struggle against drug trafficking, and trade matters, 
which I will discuss with the Russian trade minister. There is 
an essential matter to discuss with the transportation minister, 
and I have said this in a document I have presented to the 
consul general in Panama, and that is to get preferential 
treatment for Panamanian ships arriving in Russian ports. At 
this time they are being charged a surcharge that makes it 
difficult for our ships to take advantage of the markets 
existing in those ports. [end recording] 
  The visit of the high-ranking delegation to Moscow opens new 
diplomatic and trade horizons for Panama. Their work in Moscow 
will be intense and they will be returning to the country in 
early May.

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 22 April (NA) -- Defense Minister 
Oscar Camilion asserted on 22 April that the theft of 
information on the costs involved in manufacturing the Pampa 
plane from the Cordoba Materiel Area is not "important." He 
stated that this "does not affect in the least" Argentina's 
chances of selling the aircraft to the United States. 
  In remarks made at the Defense Ministry when asked about the 
theft that took place at the Cordoba Materiel Area, Camilion 
noted: "No confidential material, designs, or manufacturing 
processes have been stolen." 
  The minister stated moreover that the hard disks stolen from 
four computers in a Material Area office "have nothing to do 
with the designs for the plane." 
  "A truck would be needed to steal them," said Camilion 
ironically in referring to the designs for the Pampa, a modern 
trainer. 
  The minister further stated that the theft -- which occurred 
between 21 and 31 January while personnel from the Materiel Area 
were on holiday -- "does not affect in the least" the Pampa's 
chances of being the successful bidder at the international bid 
to take place in the United States on 12 May. 
  On that date, the U.S. Armed Forces will decide on the 
purchase of 700 trainer aircraft, the cost of which will range 
between $5 million and $7 million [figures as received]. 
Companies from Italy, Brazil, the United States, Germany, and 
Switzerland will participate in this international bid in 
addition to Argentina. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Communist Party [PC] Secretary General Alejandro 
Mosquera denied yesterday that the party would be dissolved. 
Mosquera said the reports were "journalistic interpretations," 
stressing that "the PC will help the Grand Front to develop, 
working with others as a group." 
  The press report saying that the PC would be dissolved and 
later reappear as a new force within the Grand Front provoked 
"surprise and indignation" among the party ranks. Mosquera 
admitted, however, that "an internal proposal was made before 10 
April" which sought "to give new life to the party." The bitter 
infighting within the PC increased following the Grand Front's 
spectacular growth. The old guard that makes up the current PC 
leadership has suggested few, very few, figures for the 
alliance: One example is Attorney Eduardo Barcesat. The 
candidacy of Patricio Echegaray for the position of secretary 
general, for instance, was rejected by the other front members. 
  "The key to the success of the front was to appeal to 
different political groups. The Grand Front ticket included 
Communist as well as other party leaders. This plurality was 
the key to the 10 April election success," Mosquera said. PC 
leader Horacio Lopez denied they ever considered dissolving the 
historic PC. He said: "We are witnessing a new maneuver to 
derail the left at a time the party is consolidating its 
position as a valid alternative to the social and economic 
model. The intention is to create uncertainty and confusion 
among authentic progressive forces, seeking to reduce their real 
electoral possibilities in 1995." Communist leaders Eduardo 
Barcesat and Maria Ines Brasesco were elected as constituent 
members in the recent election. Their importance within the 
alliance, however, is minimum.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 Apr (NA) -- The organization that 
groups small- and medium-sized laboratories today maintained 
that the draft Patents Law relating to medicines that has been 
submitted by the executive branch "will inexorably lead to 
uncontrolled price increases of medicines and to a serious 
deterioration of the sector's industrial activity." 
  Cooperala, Cooperative of Argentine Laboratories of 
Medicinal 
Specialities, says in a communique that the executive branch's 
draft "reflects the highest aspiration of U.S. multinational 
laboratories." 
  It adds: "This is in disagreement with the guidelines agreed 
upon in this respect by the executive branch in the recently 
concluded GATT Uruguay Round." 
  "In the chapter that refers to medicinal patents, the 
Uruguay 
Round considerably attenuates the U.S. demands and makes more 
equitable the rights and obligations of the 119 countries that 
signed the document," the communique states. 
  Cooperala admits that "although intellectual property rights 
are a basic factor for guaranteeing the continuity of individual 
creativity and industrial progress, our organization understands 
that the creation of a monopoly to implement this factor is 
inconceivable." 
  "We understand that with an adequate percentage of 
acknowledgement for the inventor, society can benefit from the 
serious competition of all those industrialists who have 
adequate capability to develop medicines," the communique 
concludes.

  [Text] President Sanchez de Lozada last night confirmed the 
police action against the main group of hunger strikers, and 
warned that the government will no longer negotiate with the COB 
[Bolivian Labor Federation] if pressure measures continue. 
  During a phone conversation with the HATA news agency, 
Sanchez de Lozada said the government is determined not to 
negotiate under any form of pressure. We can immediately hold 
negotiations as proposed by COB leaders but without pressure. He 
said this shortly after police forces entered COB's La Paz 
headquarters and took to the police clinic -- other report 
mentions the (Dengel) clinic, which we will confirm in the next 
few minutes -- the six hunger strikers, including the three La 
Paz teachers led by Wilma Plata. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said: We adopted this decision because we 
cannot let them die. This is an intolerable situation and we 
have the mission to preserve the life and health of the 
citizens, in keeping with the Constitution. 
  He said the police action was carried out against the hunger 
strikers at COB headquarters because they were facing the most 
critical situation. He added that the government will take a 
firm stand tonight and will not allow the COB and peasant 
federation to carry out the roadblocks scheduled to begin on 28 
April. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said: We will not tolerate any roadblocks. 
We will take firm and responsible actions. He urged workers 
leaders to give up their intransigent attitude and hold 
negotiations. 
  During a news conference in La Paz at 2330 last night, the 
government confirmed the police operation and issued a 
communique, the main topics of which are: 
  1) The six hunger strikers were taken to a local clinic 
following a judge's order. This measure was adopted to protect 
their lives. 
  2) The government as always is willing to continue holding 
negotiations with the COB in an atmosphere of mutual 
understanding. To this end all forms of pressure must be lifted. 
  During the news conference, Social Communications Minister 
Ernesto Machicado, Justice Minister Rene Blattman, and Labor 
Minister Reynaldo Peters pointed out that government officials 
only seek to preserve the citizens' lives and [words indistinct] 
in Bolivian territory. 
  Blattman said: The government has termed it absolutely 
necessary to protect the human being, the health and security of 
people. We took action in the face of a true emergency situation. 
  Peters stressed the need to lift all forms of pressure to 
allow negotiations between the COB and the government. We think 
COB leaders must reflect and bear in mind higher interests. We 
can create true conditions for peace in Bolivia only under 
democracy and with lives placed at the interest of the Republic. 
  He said the government has no official information on a 
Catholic Church initiative in the situation. 
  As for the 27 people arrested during the violent 
demonstration staged on 22 April, the ministers said they will 
be placed at the disposal of the court on charges of aggression 
and robbery. 
  The ministers stated that this is not a form of pressure. It 
was adopted to preserve people's security and prevent attacks 
against their property. 
  They regretted the COB's demand to release them because a 
crime must be punished in compliance with the law. They 
concluded by saying the government is firmly determined to 
guarantee social peace.

<F P=106> [Report by Flavio Figueiredo in Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] The Brazilian and Czech Governments today signed 
economic cooperation agreements to expand bilateral relations 
and promote trade between the two countries. 
  Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said that in 1993 
Brazilian 
exports to the Czech Republic totaled $7 million while its 
imports totaled $5 million. Klaus said these amounts were small 
following the separation of the Czech and Slovak Republics and 
the economic reform the Czech Republic has been undergoing. 
  Under the agreements, the governments of Brazil and the 
Czech 
Republic commit themselves to increase trade and to diversify 
their export and import items. They also agreed to undertake a 
joint cooperation effort in the areas of machinery production 
and professional training. 
  During his visit to Brazil, Klaus is also conveying to 
Brazilian officials the experience earned by the Czech Republic 
in the area of privatization. The Czech Republic has had the 
most expeditious privatization process in history. As late as 
1989 nothing had been privatized in the Czech Republic, but 
today the private sector already accounts for two-thirds of the 
country's GDP.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- Foreign Minister Celso Amorim on 22 
April reacted to the Argentine Government's proposal of putting 
a levy on Brazilian exports to compensate for so-called "social 
dumping," that is, the practice of competitive prices thanks to 
cheap labor. The foreign minister said the connection between 
labor standards and trade is a "spurious" matter, in response to 
Argentine Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo, who a few months ago 
accused Brazil of taking advantage of the low salaries paid here 
to increase its exports and trade surplus with Argentina. 
  "We cannot allow other countries to impose restrictions on 
our exports," Amorim said as he attended the fourth ministerial 
meeting of the Rio Group and EU with the presence of 25 Latin 
American and European foreign ministers. In defense, Argentine 
Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella denied that his government 
intends to put a levy on Brazilian products, but he said the 
wage difference between the two countries must be reduced. 
  "The Brazilian economy is undergoing a transformation we 
consider excellent," he said. 
  The Argentine proposal is similar to that presented by the 
United States and France in the last meeting of the GATT Uruguay 
Round: to link the increase of international trade with the 
exporting countries' labor and environmental conditions. During 
the meeting, the rest of the countries managed to avoid 
mentioning this specific proposal. 
  "Since the developed countries are living in a recession, 
there is a proclivity to include clauses that would imply 
transferring the burden of unemployment to the developing 
countries," Celso Amorim complained.

<F P=106> [Article by Livia Ferrari: "Sales to Mercosur up 37.56 </F>
Percent"] 
  [Text] Rio de Janeiro--Brazil's trade with the Mercosur 
(Common Market of the South) countries totaled $8.73 billion in 
1993, an increase of 37.56 percent over the $6.35 billion 
recorded the year before. Those figures represent the total of 
imports and exports combined. 
  Putting it another way, Brazil exported goods and services 
worth a total of $5.4 billion to Argentina, Paraguay, and 
Uruguay and imported the equivalent of $3.3 billion from those 
countries. This means that Mercosur accounted for 14 percent of 
Brazil's total exports and 13 percent of its total imports last 
year. 
  Brazil's trade surplus with Mercosur also rose: to $2.062 
billion, or 11.64 percent more than the $1.85 billion recorded 
in 1992. The increase was due mainly to the flow of trade with 
Paraguay and Uruguay, since Brazil's surplus with Argentina was 
down by nearly $300 million to $1.02 billion in 1993. But 
Brazil's trade surpluses with Paraguay and Uruguay practically 
doubled from one year to the next, as is shown in the statistics 
from the Foreign Trade Secretariat (Secex).

  At $910 million, transportation equipment headed the list of 
Brazilian sales to Argentina last year. Total exports to 
Argentina were $3.5 billion. Mechanical and electrical machinery 
and equipment--so-called capital goods--were in second place 
among Brazilian sales to Argentina at $738 million, an increase 
of 41 percent over the year before. According to the experts, 
that result shows how competitive Brazilian industry is in that 
it increased market shares despite Argentina's elimination of 
its import duty on capital goods for third countries [sentence 
as published]. 
  The main item exported to Brazil by Argentina in 1993 was 
products of plant origin at $828 million. Half of that value 
represented products of the milling industry, including wheat. 
The second item on the list of Brazilian imports from Argentina 
was mineral fuels (petroleum and petroleum products) at a value 
of $520 million--a fantastic increase of 374 percent over the 
$110 million worth imported in 1992. 
  The same statistics also reveal that Brazilian sales to 
Paraguay rose 76.8 percent in 1993 to a total of $960.6 million. 
At the same time, Brazilian imports of Paraguayan products 
increased 45.5 percent to $273 million, the biggest item being 
textile products (up 41 percent to a total of $161 million). 
Brazil's biggest exports to Paraguay are electromechanical 
machinery and equipment at $174 million and food, beverage, and 
tobacco products at $172.5 million. 
  Brazilian sales to the Uruguayan market totaled $775 million 
(an increase of 50.7 percent), the main item being 
transportation equipment ($198 million). Brazil purchased $428.6 
million worth of Uruguayan products in 1993 (up 26 percent), 
mainly products of plant origin at $152 million.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Admiral Mario Cesar Flores, head of the 
Strategic Affairs Secretariat [SAE], yesterday characterized as 
"foolishly absurd" allegations that the sale of Brazilian 
enriched uranium to the U.S. company Nuexco would endanger the 
reloading of the Angra-1 nuclear plant. In its latest edition, 
the magazine ISTOE reports that Nuclear Industries of Brazil 
(INB) has sold the enriched uranium at a cost of $1.7 million. 
  Flores said: The transaction will not bring any problems to 
the Brazilian nuclear program. He added that he would release 
today all the figures concerning Brazilian uranium reserves. 
  Flores said he learned about the transaction after the 
contract had been signed, as INB is empowered to make these 
sales on its own. He said this was a good deal for INB, as the 
money it has obtained through this sale will make it possible to 
reactivate already this year the uranium mine of Pocos de 
Caldas, in Minas Gerais State. 
  Regarding the possibility that the Brazilian uranium could 
be 
diverted to countries like Iraq, Iran, or India -- to make bombs 
-- Flores was even more emphatic. 
  He said: It would be paranoid to believe that Canada, one of 
the most active verifiers of the use of nuclear energy, could 
divert the material. Canada, Flores said, is the ultimate 
destination of the Brazilian uranium sold to Nuexco.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- The Sao Paulo State Attorney's Office 
will investigate charges that 11 members of the Institute for 
Nuclear and Energy Research (Ipen) in Sao Paulo have been 
contaminated by radioactive material while working at one of the 
Ipen laboratories, which is controlled by the National Nuclear 
Energy Commission (CNEN). The Association of Ipen Employees 
(Assipen) and the Federal Employees Union in Sao Paulo 
(Sindisef) have stated that the Ipen employees -- five women and 
six men who operated machinery at the pharmaceuticals laboratory 
-- were contaminated by breathing Iodine- 131. 
  Ipen employees' representatives have reported that the 
contamination was detected through tests last month. Assipen 
Director Claudio Manoel Constancio said that the employees had a 
hormonal dysfunction in their thyroid glands, and that some of 
them had nodules and cysts in their glands. According to 
Constancio, Iodine-131 causes thyroid hyperactivity. 
  CNEN Radioprotection Director Laercio Vinhas yesterday 
reported by fax that the thyroid dysfunctions detected in the 
employees have no relation whatsoever with their work at the 
laboratory and that this problem is detected in 3 percent of the 
overall population. Vinhas added that only seven workers, and 
not 11, have been given sick leave because medical literature 
does not prohibit people with thyroid dysfunctions from working 
with iodine mixtures. 
  The affected employees refused to comment on the issue and, 
according to the Assipen director, fear retaliation by the 
company. Constancio said that the CNEN and Ipen have maintained 
absolute secrecy about the subject. Prosecutors who work for 
the Job Accidents Division of the Attorney General's Office have 
already summoned the company's superintendent, Spero Penha 
Morato, to clarify the situation during a meeting to be held on 
2 May. 
  The employees' representatives want doctors and experts of 
the Fundacentro, an organization linked to the Labor Ministry 
that is responsible for controlling workers' health, to examine 
the Ipen facilities at the Sao Paulo University campus.

  [Text] Based on the latest data collected by the research 
institutes, the Finance Ministry has concluded that prices 
converted into Real Value Units (URV's) rose by 5 percent 
between March and April. This has prompted the government to 
implement the real on 1 July. 
  Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero's team believes the 
decision 
to introduce the real in July and to announce its implementation 
35 days in advance will give the economic agents more security 
and reduce price readjustments. 
  The Finance Ministry attributes the increase in prices after 
they were converted into URV to entrepreneurs' fear of an 
eventual price control and of a freeze on the basic foodstuff 
basket produce. 
  The inflation in URV has made Ricupero give up the idea of 
implementing the real on 1 June.

<F P=106> [Article: "Armed Forces General Staff Issues Warning, </F>
Demands Compliance With Law"] 
  [Text] Brasilia--The minister-chief of the Armed Forces 
General Staff [EMFA], Admiral Arnaldo Leite, warned yesterday 
that "the Armed Forces are prepared to enforce law and order 
against any person at all who disobeys the law, even if that 
person is a judge on the Federal Supreme Court." Leite denied, 
however, that the military are poised for an institutional 
confrontation. 
  "It is not a matter of confrontation; it is a matter of 
enforcing the law," he said. In his opinion, the fact that the 
Federal Supreme Court [STF] unanimously voted itself an 
11-percent pay increase by moving up the date for converting 
wages to URV's [real units of value] from the 30th to to 20th 
means nothing "because there is no sovereign decision which can 
violate the law." 
<H5>  Anarchy </H5>
  The suggestion by the minister-chief of the EMFA--and it is 
supported by other military ministers--is that President Itamar 
Franco should not release any funds beyond those already 
provided to anyone who is disobeying the law. "The amount in 
excess, which in the STF's case is that 11-percent increase, 
cannot be paid because the executive branch is bound to obey the 
law, and anyone who does not is subject to arrest," the minister 
said. "No one can disobey the law, be he a Supreme Court judge, 
a deputy, a senator, the minister of Army, the chief of the 
EMFA, or an ordinary government employee," he emphasized. 
  In the minister's opinion, that kind of attitude on the part 
of the Supreme Court and of Congress, which overrode the 
presidential veto limiting the pay of a portion of the civil 
service, is aimed at destabilizing the plan. "If they do not 
obey the law, the result will be anarchy, and that is not 
acceptable," he noted. Arnaldo Leite said that the note released 
by Planalto Palace on Friday night had the support of the entire 
cabinet. Although only 13 ministers were present, President 
Itamar Franco instructed Henrique Hargreaves, chief of the 
Civilian Household, to notify them all of the note's contents. 
There was general agreement. 
<H5>  Military Intervention Ruled out </H5>
  Brasilia--President Itamar Franco will meet with all the 
military ministers again next Tuesday at a luncheon on board the 
training ship Brasil, which is beginning its year-long training 
cruise. In the opinion of Adm. Arnaldo Leite, minister-chief of 
the EMFA, the president will be applauded by the servicemen 
because he has shown that the administration is not indifferent 
to the pay disparity among the three branches of government. 
  Despite the tone of his statements, the minister maintains 
that there is no possibility of military intervention in 
politics. "The country is living in a democracy," he pointed 
out. "Our action shows only that the Armed Forces are prepared 
to enforce the law in the manner determined by the president," 
he added. "Judges interpret the law; they cannot disobey the 
law," the admiral said heatedly. In his opinion, the branches of 
government are "distinct, harmonious, and independent," but they 
must obey a provisional measure. He concluded by saying: "The 
only people who don't see that are the people who don't want to."

<F P=106> [Article by Helio Contreras: "PT Promises To Modernize Armed </F>
Forces"; introductory paragraphs in italics as published] 
  [Text] The PT [Workers Party] has a plan for the 
Armed Forces that provides a budget capable of preventing 
obsolescence in the military institutions and advocates the 
establishment of a Ministry of Defense following studies 
involving the participation of admirals and Army and Air Force 
generals. The plan's author, Colonel Geraldo Cavagnari, told 
CORREIO BRAZILIENSE yesterday that the Calha Norte program for 
occupying the Amazon border region and strengthening activities 
in that area by the government's civilian authorities would 
continue if the PT's candidate, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, was 
elected president of the republic in the elections on 3 October. 
  The plan for the defense sector was requested of 
Cavagnari by the PT's Office for Coordination of the Program. It 
has already been submitted to Lula and will be approved at the 
party's next national meeting, which will be held in Brasilia in 
April. The director of the Strategic Studies Group at Unicamp 
[Campinas State University] says that the portion of the 
military budget earmarked for modernizing the military 
institutions will have to total at least 2 percent of GDP [gross 
domestic product]. Currently, it is 0.6 percent. But he admitted 
that "everything will depend on the needs of other sectors." 
<H5>  Navy To Defend Entire Coast </H5>
  The author of the PT's plan for the Armed Forces, Col. 
Geraldo Cavagnari, calls for modernizing the Navy "to ensure 
that the Navy has what it needs to operate in defense of the 
coast." According to Cavagnari, "that modernization process 
may--eventually--make the Navy really capable of operating in 
blue water to defend a number of national interests in the South 
Atlantic." 
  In Cavagnari's view, "there must be continuity in the Navy's 
nuclear program so that in the 21st century, it will have 
nuclear-powered submarines giving it a greater range along the 
Brazilian coast." The colonel said that "nuclear-powered 
submarines will be vital if the Navy is to make it difficult for 
the sea to be used by any country acting contrary to national 
interests in the vicinity of the Brazilian coast." 
  In Cavagnari's estimation, nuclear-powered submarines "must 
be seen as a defense weapon, which is how the Brazilian Navy 
itself views them, and not as an attack weapon." 
  The author of the PT's defense proposal also emphasized 
another submarine-related matter: the submarines must not be 
armed with ballistic missiles (strategic missiles with a range 
exceeding 500 kilometers) carrying either conventional or 
nuclear warheads (payloads), another point on which the Navy 
agrees. 
<H5>  Army Must Improve Strategy </H5>
  The essential thing for the Army, according to Col. 
Cavagnari's evaluation, is "to increase its tactical and 
strategic mobility." He explained that tactics "involve the 
speed of movement in a theater of operations and require 
equipping the Army with armor and helicopters so that it can 
move faster." 
  Strategy will enable the Army to reach the area where a 
defense problem exists in the shortest time possible. To do 
that, it will have to have the means required for that mobility. 
Those means can be aircraft as well as transport ships. 
  Since the financial limitations will probably persist for 
the 
next four years, the director of the Strategic Studies Group at 
Unicamp said that "the ground forces will therefore have to be 
organized in such a way that they will be located near strategic 
areas." 
  Col. Cavagnari said that "although there are no external 
threats to Brazilian sovereignty in the Amazon Region, military 
presence in the area is necessary because it constitutes 60 
percent of the national territory and is practically unexplored, 
besides which it has several problems requiring a solution." 
  The former instructor at the Army Command and Staff School 
(ECEME), who was also an officer in the Army General Staff's 
Department of Strategy, said that there must be continuity in 
reequipping Army units. 
<H5>  Air Force To Get More Aircraft </H5>
  In Col. Cavagnari's opinion, the Air Force "will have to be 
in a position to monitor and defend the airspace." Interception 
capability will continue to be located in the most sensitive 
areas of the national territory: population centers, industrial 
centers, and so on. The FAB [Brazilian Air Force] is to receive 
the entire quota of AMX aircraft called for in the 
Italian-Brazilian agreement. That number is 54, but the FAB has 
received only 20 aircraft. 
  During the four years of the next administration, new 
aircraft may be acquired to improve the FAB's ability to defend 
the airspace, a mission it currently performs with Mirages and 
F-5's acquired in the 1970's. Those two aircraft are no longer 
produced by France and the United States. 
  Cavagnari supports continuity in the Brazilian Space 
Program, 
which will guarantee "mastery of the technology for strategic 
medium-range ballistic missiles, among other technological 
advances." According to the Unicamp strategist, that missile 
will probably not have a range of more than 1,500 km. 
  He mentioned the Complete Space Mission, which has already 
made it possible to launch a satellite, designed by the National 
Space Research Institute (INPE), for collecting earth data (of 
ecological interest). Brazil may soon be able to launch 
satellites using its own Satellite Launch Vehicle (VLS). The 
INPE satellite was placed in orbit using an American rocket.

  [Text] Santiago, 22 Apr (EFE) -- Czech Prime Minister 
Vaclav Klaus said today that the Czech Republic, which is 
following the path of economic liberalism, was able to 
completely change the political and social system because 
communism and the so-called socialism with a human face "lead 
nowhere." 
  A complement to the market economy is an "effective" social 
policy, said Klaus, who pointed out that regional blocs should 
not become fortresses that exclude third countries. 
  Klaus, who arrived for an official visit on 20 April, 
underlined during a news conference "the enormous results shown 
by the Chilean economic transformation" and the efforts made 
toward democracy. 
  He also expressed the Czech Republic's interest in trade and 
joint investments in Chile. He noted, however, that some work 
still remains to be done to eliminate all the obstacles to 
increasing bilateral trade. 
  In this regard, he pointed out the need to expedite 
negotiations for signing an agreement on investment protection, 
and another for eliminating double taxation. 
  He said he explained this and other proposals to Chilean 
President Eduardo Frei and to the economic area ministers with 
whom he met. 
  He indicated that he had proposed to Chilean officials "the 
use of all means" to reach a liberalization of trade relations 
with the signing of a free trade agreement. 
  He also proposed the creation of joint commissions, both 
government and business, to study other bilateral relations 
possibilities. 
  Prime Minister Klaus came with a delegation of 70 
businessmen, who met with Chilean economic officials in the 
public and private sectors. 
  Klaus and Chilean acting Foreign Minister Jose Miguel 
Insulza 
signed today a cooperation agreement in the areas of culture, 
education, and science. 
  During his stay in Chile, Klaus met with President Frei, the 
ministers of the economic area, businessmen, Chamber of Deputies 
President Jorge Schaulsohn, and Supreme Court President Marcos 
Aburto. 
  Prime Minister Klaus also gave a lecture in the Diplomatic 
Academy, and was declared guest of honor in Santiago. He will 
leave for Brazil today.

<F P=106> [From the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff arrived in 
Santa Fe de Bogota and immediately the hornets nest went wild. 
His strong statements against President Cesar Gaviria and other 
government officials forced the president to reply to the 
controversial judicial official's criticism. Gaviria spoke in 
terms stronger than the ones Colombians are used to hearing from 
him. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] What is happening with 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff? 
  [Gaviria] In terms of our relationship, we have differences 
of a juridical nature, and we believe some of his decisions have 
been inappropriate. That is all. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, is your government servile? 
  [Gaviria] Yes, the prosecutor's portrayal of the president 
was a bit offensive. I regret his use of such brazen language. 
I will not answer him in similar terms at any time. Colombia 
is starting to experience difficulties in the United States for 
statements that, as the prosecutor himself has noted, the 
president had warned him about. 
  [Reporter] Skeptically, it has been said that you did not 
give the prosecutor your full support because you were 
safeguarding your election to the OAS post. 
  [Gaviria] I believe the prosecutor has secretly managed to 
spread this rumor. I believe it is extremely unfair. Ours is a 
balanced, reasonable position. Our doubts are based on the law, 
or simply based on what is appropriate. We are not going to 
abandon our position simply because this type of argument is 
being raised. In this specific case, I believe we are doing 
great harm to the country by exploiting these sentiments instead 
of explaining our decisions. 
  [Reporter] Has the prosecutor's statement upset you? 
  [Gaviria] I believe it is in Colombia's best interests that 
we present a clear and consistent policy on drug trafficking to 
the international community. This would be good for the country. 
We want to incorporate the country into the world economy and 
into world markets. It is highly desirable that this country 
have a good image abroad. It is very desirable for Colombians 
that Colombia have a good image abroad. You can be sure that, 
despite all the ruckus and confrontation, the country's 
interests, in the long run, are rooted in this. [end recording] 
  Prosecutor Gustavo de Greiff stated in a communique issued 
today, that, during his stay in the United States he denied to 
the media that he had offered pardons to drug traffickers. 
Prosecutor General de Greiff also said judicial cooperation 
could not be accepted if it was conditioned on having to hold 
prior consultations on the decision to use certain evidence with 
a country that supplied such evidence -- in this case, the 
United States. The prosecutor also urged U.S. authorities to 
stop their unjustified attacks on Colombian officials, 
especially him. He called on the U.S. Government to continue 
cooperating by exchanging evidence to further the struggle to 
end the worldwide scourge of drug trafficking.

<F P=106> ["Text" of President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's speech to the </F>
nation broadcast on 24 April] 
  [Text] "Fellow-countrymen: When I acceded to the 
presidency, I set out to improve the economic situation of the 
country, to increase levels of employment and wages, and to 
implement a more equitable distribution of wealth. These were, 
and continue to be, my objectives and I will continue to battle 
for them throughout my tenure. 
  ``I was aware that I was the first civilian president in 
many 
decades. I therefore sought to govern with the deepest respect 
for all individual and political liberties and to enhance the 
freedom of the press as an essential channel for democracy. 
Likewise, I was conscious of the great responsibility I assumed 
before my fellow-countrymen, especially those who did not vote 
for me but who also contributed toward the democracy that we at 
present enjoy. We must consolidate our democratic system if we 
are to derive the benefits we admire in countries that embarked 
on this path before us. 
  ``In compliance with this line of action, I have favored 
dialogue and negotiation as a way to definitely overcome 
conflicts and problems. This is why I hold daily talks with all 
social, economic, and political sectors in our country. This is 
why I frequently travel the length and breath of our country -- 
to be in direct contact with my fellow-countrymen, to understand 
their needs, and to explain the restrictions imposed by our 
reality. 
  ``I believe the great majority of our government officials 
and the people at large share this spirit with us. Sometimes 
our temperament, our grievances, our culture, and our anxiety 
play nasty tricks on us and we go against those purposes. It is 
then that we lose our patience and engage in verbal battles in 
which we try to discredit each other. This contributes to bring 
things to a head. It encourages drastic solutions, unilateral 
positions, and a pessimistic outlook on the future which is not 
in keeping with our reality and which, to a certain extent, 
takes us back to the past; a past that we want to overcome but 
which binds us to an authoritarian culture in which we believe 
-- either individually or as a group -- that we are absolutely 
right and are entitled to every single right. Therefore, we need 
not heed those who think differently. 
  ``Under a dictatorial regime, disagreements like this do not 
prosper for the simple reason that nobody can voice his/her 
opinion. Everyone can speak in democracy, but if we do so in an 
authoritarian way we cause unending disputes and irreconcilable 
stances which lead to impasse and frustration. Handled 
incorrectly we could end up in a state of anarchy, against which 
we must fight with the same vigor we exhibited when we overthrew 
the dictatorship. 
  ``Within this framework of learning how to move from tyranny 
to republican participation, I would like to make some 
reflections on the planned 2 May strike. The right to strike is 
enshrined in our Constitution and will be scrupulously respected 
and zealously protected. The right to strike is one thing but 
it is quite another thing to analyze whether or not it is timely. 
  ``To obtain higher wages and create more jobs in our country 
-- which was isolated from the rest of the world and whose 
best-known industry was, sad to say, corruption -- we must build 
a level of credibility that will help us obtain the investments 
required to support the better pay and employment levels I have 
just mentioned. We must reduce inflation and thus avoid the 
painful learning process experienced by our neighbors, who were 
forced to coexist for decades with rampant inflation, which like 
any addiction, undermines social efforts and generates the worst 
injustices to the humblest strata of society, eating into their 
salaries every month as it reduces their purchasing power. 
  ``Inflation leaves no room to build a truly better future. I 
want to be very clear on this point, as long as I am president 
of all Paraguayans, I will never propound demagogic measures 
that will compromise and mortgage the future of our country. 
For these reasons I believe the announced strike will not help 
us, Paraguayans, to better our situation. We also believe the 
direct action methodology of this struggle is incorrect, seeking 
to oil the wheels of a sometimes difficult social coexistence 
because direct action damages bonds that exist between those who 
will have to negotiate at a future date. This happens simply 
because there is no other way of reaching agreement. 
  ``In my capacity as president and as a Paraguayan, I want to 
sit at the negotiating table to discuss things, to rationally 
meet our priority needs, and to reach consensus on some of our 
expectations and on our outlook on reality. If we do not do 
this, we will continue with this tug of war from our respective 
positions and will not attain our objectives, less still in the 
short term. Errors bring about damage, but they usually are a 
most precious source of learning. 
  ``I am convinced this strike is a mistake. I am sure it is a 
grave mistake. Yet if it helps Paraguay to learn, it is worth a 
try. I am sure it will be more beneficial for all concerned if 
we continue our talks before the strike. 
  ``If we cannot do that, as far as I am concerned, the 
negotiating table and the offer to talk continue open after the 
strike. I will do my best and I promise the best effort by the 
government to continue to build, with anyone who wants to 
participate, the best Paraguay possible. I wish you the best.''

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Noelia Villalba in Yataity del </F>
Norte, San Pedro Department] 
  [Text] Yesterday during a meeting in Yataity del Norte, 
peasant leaders from the entire country decided to join a 
nationwide strike scheduled for 2 May. The peasants will 
reportedly stage marches and block roads throughout the interior 
of the country. 
  During their six-hour meeting, about 20 peasant leaders from 
all the national peasant organizations decided to join a general 
strike called by the United Workers Trade Union, the Paraguayan 
Confederation of Workers, and the National Workers Federation 
for 2 May. 
  Peasants from the interior of the country will join the 
general strike to express their rejection of the government's 
neoliberal policy, their repudiation of corruption and social 
injustices, and their support for peasant demands. 
  The peasants will express their solidarity with a great 
rally 
sponsored by the National Peasant Organization (ONAC). The 
rally will be staged at the Heroes Square in the town of Coronel 
Oviedo. The peasants will march from Heroes Square to the 
international highway intersection at Coronel Oviedo where they 
will decide whether to block the crossroads there. 
  Other roads in various parts of the country will also be 
blocked. The Coordinating Board of Landless People [Coordinacion 
de Sin Tierras] will block roads in the towns of Union, Maria 
Auxiliadora, and Sanguina Cue. The peasants organizations in 
San Pedro will block traffic in Tacuara. The Paraguayan Peasant 
Movement branch in Limoy will block the "superhighway" at 10 
points. The Chaco Communities Coordinating Board [Coordinacion 
Intercomunitaria del Chaco] will block traffic on the Transchaco 
Highway. Local peasant organizations will stage another rally 
at the 234 Square in Curuguaty. 
  After long discussions, the peasant commission that is 
participating in negotiations with the Social Development 
Council decided to walk out because problems are not being 
solved. Estanislao Martinez, a peasants coordinator, explained: 
"We walked out of the negotiations with the government because 
the government officials asked us not to implement any pressure 
measures and because the government refused to respond to our 
petition for compensation for the bad quality seeds distributed 
among peasants." Another point raised by the peasants to support 
their walk out from the negotiations involved the incorrect 
management of 3.8 billion guaranies that Paraguayan Cotton 
Chamber made available to the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Livestock to resolve peasants problems. 
  Finally, it was decided to ask the appropriate government 
officials to clearly determine how Esteban Balbuena, the 
National Peasant Federation (FNC) Environment and Ecology 
secretary, died. Balbuena was found dead on 19 April in Itapua 
Department. He was in a pickup truck with a bullet lodged in 
his body.

  [Text] Paraguayan Central Bank [BCP] President Jacinto 
Estigarribia and members of the BCP board of directors have met 
with members of the Senate's Constitutional Affairs and Foreign 
Relations Committees to examine the text of the agreement on the 
laundering of drug trafficking money which was signed by our 
government and the U.S. Government. 
  The agreement reflects the BCP's position establishing that 
the parties directly involved are the U.S. Treasury Department, 
the BCP, and the Paraguayan Finance Ministry. The agreement also 
establishes that the BCP will be responsible for providing 
information whenever required on foreign exchange operations, 
either because there is suspicion something irregular has 
occurred or because the case is under investigation in both 
countries. 
  The president of the BCP said the bank is already 
implementing controls on foreign exchange operations. 
"Commercial banks and foreign exchange companies regularly 
provide information on all operations over $10,000 to the Banks 
Superintendency. The list includes the name of the person 
purchasing or selling those dollars, his address, and his 
identity card number. That information is currently available 
at the Banks Superintendency," Estigarribia explained. The 
agreement says this is precisely the type of information the 
parties are committed to provide if there is a concrete request 
or if there are doubts on certain operations.

  [Excerpt] Lima, 25 Apr (EFE) -- Colombian Foreign Minister 
Noemi Sanin de Rubio announced in Lima today that Colombia and 
Peru will step up the joint struggle against drug trafficking. 
  The Colombian minister, who is paying an official visit to 
Peru, said cooperation between the two countries in this field 
will be increased through the signing of new agreements. 
  In comments to the media, she said there is "great 
cooperation" between Colombia and Peru in the anti-drug field. 
  Sanin de Rubio commented that cooperation in the struggle 
against drug trafficking also includes the legal aspects, and 
disclosed that she had made a proposal in this regard to her 
Peruvian counterpart that will be assessed. 
  The visiting minister said Peru and Colombia are engaged in 
the struggle against drug trafficking and that they need each 
other, as well as the international community's cooperation 
because this problem cannot be fought alone. 
  Sanin arrived in Lima on 23 April. On 24 April, she visited 
Cusco, where an indigenous Inca empire's capital is located, and 
the Inca citadel of Machupicchu. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lima, 24 Apr (EFE) -- Today General Alfredo 
Rodriguez labeled as "impertinent" the attitude of the 
International Red Cross in areas of conflict, adding that Red 
Cross meddling in the region where the military have launched a 
counterterrorist offensive is jeopardizing operations. 
  Gen. Rodriguez, who is leading the counterterrorist 
offensive 
launched against the Shining Path on 5 April in the jungle area 
of Leoncio Prado Province, explained that the Army has been 
supplying local information to the Red Cross, but "we have 
detected certain things that don't seem to be quite all right." 
  As an example of such things, the general wondered how the 
International Red Cross knew where the troops would go in. 
  "I am not making any charges, because I have no hard 
evidence, but they do go in, they talk to subversive leaders, 
and come back with information," Gen. Rodriguez said, according 
to local Sunday newspapers. 
  The general made this statement to the Congressional Human 
Rights Committee and to Attorney General Blanca Nelida Colan in 
Tingo Maria, capital of Leoncio Prado Province, where the 
offensive is taking place. 
  Rodriguez added that according to his sources, International 
Red Cross personnel ask Shining Path militants whether their 
leaders have talked to them about the Red Cross, and whether 
they have told them that "we can help you." 
  Rodriguez indicated that information was being "distorted" 
with a view to make the Army appear to be the "bad guys," adding 
that the International Red Cross should "redesign its policy." 
  He also objected to the International Red Cross attitude 
toward arrested Shining Path members who are brought in for 
questioning. According to the general, Red Cross personnel 
insist on being allowed to talk to them as soon as they are 
arrested, without waiting for the 15-day period legally allotted 
for the investigation. 
  The general explained that although the invitation to the 
Red 
Cross to visit the area of conflict in Leoncio Prado is still 
open, Army patrols will have to accompany Red Cross personnel 
because the place is dangerous.

  [Text] Lima, 23 Apr (EFE) -- Attorney General Nelida Blanca 
Colan stated on 23 April that there is no evidence that the 
Peruvian Army "commited outrages" during the antisubversive 
operation that has been under way in Peru's northern jungle 
since 5 April. 
  The attorney general, the Congressional Human Rights 
Committee, and representatives of the Council for Peace and the 
National Coordinating Board for Human Rights arrived at the 
theater of operations today. 
  The Army is trying to eliminate Shining Path columns in 
Leoncio Prado Province, on the left bank of the Huallaga River 
in the northern Peruvian department of Huanuco. 
  The visitors boarded helicopters and overflew Venenillo, 
Moyuna, and Mohena, villages where the National Coordinating 
Board for Human Rights and certain news media claimed that Army 
helicopters had fired rockets at civilians, leaving an 
unspecified number of casualties. 
  Carlos Blanco, chairman of the Congressional Human Rights 
Committee, reported that the theater of military operations has 
been reconnoitered, and testimonies of the reported outrages 
will now be gathered. 
  Blanco belongs to the ruling party majority in Congress. He 
said: "We will stay here as long as necessary to gather all the 
necessary testimonies."

  [Text] Lima, 23 Apr (EFE) -- It appears that "Ricardo Z" 
has become the new leader of Peru's Maoist gang Shining Path 
[SL] after ousting Oscar Alberto Ramirez, known as "Feliciano." 
So far, Peruvian intelligence services have been unable to 
establish the real identity of "Ricardo Z." 
  According to sources in the intelligence services, it seems 
that after Abimael Guzman was arrested, almost a year and a half 
ago, "Ricardo Z" stepped into the shoes of SL's imprisoned 
founder and main ideologist. 
  Many analysts have reported that "Ricardo Z" could be one of 
the four SL leaders still at large, including Julio Cesar 
Mezzich, known as "El Doctorcito" ["the little doctor"], and 
Teresa Durand. 
  They do not rule out the possibility that second-level SL 
leaders may have ousted their superiors, or that "Feliciano" -- 
who took over after Guzman was arrested on 12 September 1992 -- 
is now calling himself "Ricardo Z." 
  The Lima daily EXPRESO quoted the National Counterterrorism 
Directorate (Dincote) as stating that Ramirez could have changed 
his alias to evade security forces, which according to military 
sources are on his tracks in the mountains of Ayacucho 
Department. 
  Dincote claims that "Ramirez has changed his alias to avoid 
an impending arrest." The same source indicated that another SL 
leader could have taken the alias "Feliciano." 
  The news media also speculate that "Ricardo Z" could well be 
a leader of Colombian drug traffickers who are afraid of losing 
coca plantations in the Peruvian jungle, which they control with 
SL's help. 
  "Ricardo Z" could also be a SL military leader who has 
staged 
a "coup d'etat" against the organization's high command. 
  Former Deputy Alberto Valencia, an expert in subversion, 
told 
EXPRESO that he is under the impression that Teresa Durand, 
known as "the strongest military commander," could be calling 
herself "Ricardo Z." 
  Valencia does not believe that Ramirez could be "Ricardo Z," 
although he did say that Ramirez had been entrusted with 
organizing the SL "people's guerrilla army." According to 
Valencia "neither could Mezzich be 'Ricardo Z,' as he has lost 
power and is looked upon as an upstart." 
  All the experts agree that security forces are bound to 
defeat the SL, which has been going downhill since Guzman and 90 
percent of the SL high command were arrested in September 1992. 
  A military offensive is currently under way in Leoncio 
Prado, 
a jungle province of Huanuco Department, Peru's central mountain 
region. The objective of this offensive is to eliminate SL 
columns which are operating in the area, because these columns 
appear to be the strongest force SL has left. 
  Various circles have criticized "Operation Aries," and there 
are witnesses who claim that the military have used helicopters 
to bomb civilians who are fleeing from the area.

  [Excerpts] Lima, 23 Apr (EFE) -- Peruvian President 
Alberto Fujimori asserted that now that Congress has approved 
the proposal that the National Elections Board (JNE) organize 
the elections, nobody can suspect any fraud. [passage omitted] 
  Fujimori on 22 April told journalists in Arequipa, 1,000 km 
south of Lima, that with this decision "now absolutely nobody 
can question the clear and transparent development of the 
electoral process." 
  He added that reports stating that "the government upheld 
electoral fraud" have thus been dismissed, and said the 
executive branch will not have any problem promulgating the law 
approved by Congress. 
  Fujimori indirectly referred to the possible presidential 
candidacy of former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar 
by stating: "The road is clear and nobody can condition his 
candidacy to the establishment of clear and clean rules."

tension pylons in Los Olivos and Santa Anita Districts, two 
Credit Bank branches in La Victoria and Caqueta Districts, and a 
Latino Bank branch in San Martin de Porres District in Lima. The 
most serious attacks were against the buildings of the recently 
auctioned National Telecommunications Enterprise of Peru, Entel 
Peru, and the Peruvian Telephone Company, CPT. On 29 March, a 
bomb explosion in an Entel Peru building in downtown Lima 
injured four people. (Lima CARETAS in Spanish 31 Mar 94 p 20) 
  Counterterrorism Directorate, Dincote, personnel arrested 
four other members of the gang that killed General Julio Nino 
Rios, former director of the defunct Peruvian Republican Guard.

  Seven Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, MRTA, "terrorists" 
were presented to the press at the Fifth Infantry Division unit

years. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 7 Apr 94 p A15) 
  On 30 March, four SL "terrorists" dynamited the Yompian mall 
in Lima. The explosion caused damage but no injuries. (Lima 
EXPRESO in Spanish 31 Mar 94 p A14) 
  MRTA regional leader Juan Antonio Leon Montero, aka Perseo, 
told Dincote that the Chilean "terrorist" known as Comrade 
Rodrigo, along with other Peruvian and Chilean "terrorists," 
lead the so-called MRTA Guerrilla Center Front that operates in 
Junin, Pasco, and Huancavelica Departments. Rodrigo was involved 
in the attacks against the Government Palace in 1993 and the 
Army general headquarters in 1992. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 31 
Mar 94 p A15) 
  The Apurimac Political-Military Command presented three 
repentant SL members at the Army base in Bolognesi, Apurimac

ammunition. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 1 Apr 94 p A14) 
  Dincote agents arrested 10 members of a SL faction lead by 
Oscar Ramirez Durand, aka Feliciano, during a raid of a house in 
Lima. A repentant SL member provided the information that led to 
their capture. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 1 Apr 94 p A14) 
  The Police and Armed Forces Joint Command reported that they 
captured 7,667 MRTA and SL "subversives" from June 1992 to 
February 1994, compared with the previous 12 years when only 
5,403 "terrorists" were arrested. More than 4,000 "subversives" 
have surrendered and 1,104 have been indicted since the 
Repentance Law was enforced in May 1992. (Lima EL PERUANO in 
Spanish 6 Apr 94 p 10) 
  The Army and National Police captured 13 SL and MRTA 
"terrorists" during operations in Ancash and Amazonas Provinces. 
(Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 8 Apr 94 p A17) 
  A large quantity of weapons and 19 "terrorists" were 
presented to General Hermoza Rios, chairman of Armed Forces 
Joint Command in Tingo Maria. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 9 Apr 
94 p A12) 
  On 11 April, Dincote agents raided a house in El Callao, 
where they arrested five SL "terrorists," and seized weapons, 
fliers, and other documents on recent actions. National Police 
sources reported that members of the so-called SL National 
Directorate headed by Oscar Ramirez Durand, aka Feliciano, met 
in this house. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 13 Apr 94 p 12) 
  At least 10 SL "terrorists" died and six were arrested

two clashes with Army forces in Upper Huallaga townships on 8 
March and 12 April. An undetermined number of SL "terrorists" 
died during a clash with police in Palca, 120 km from Huancayo. 
On 9 April, police personnel raided a clandestine mine that 
provided dynamite to MRTA. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 13 Apr 94 p 
A12) 
  SL "terrorists" shot dead three people in the township of 
Sonomoro, in the jungle zone of Junin Department, on charges of 
being informants for security forces. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 
2237 GMT 17 Apr 94) 
  On 16 April, Red Path members killed at least 18 people in 
Monterrico and Chiriari villages, in the jungle district of 
Mazamrai. Most of the victims were Ashaninka Indians. (Madrid 
EFE in Spanish 1619 GMT 18 Apr 94) 
  MRTA "terrorists" on 21 April killed 12 people, including 
two 
Army soldiers and nine civilians, and wounded two soldiers and 
14 peasants during an ambush of a civilian vehicle in a jungle 
area of Oxapampa District, Pasco Department. (Madrid EFE in 
Spanish 0039 GMT 23 Apr 94)

Bajares made the announcement at the conclusion of the Council 
meeting, saying that reforms to the law on bids for public 
projects and services, the budget law, and the law on taxes on 
bank debits had been approved. 
  Regarding the law on taxes on bank debits, Alvarez Bajares 
said the tax will be charged only to those who issue checks or 
other documents against their assets held at any of the 
country's financial institutions; in other words, the person who 
receives the check will not have to pay a tax. 
  The OCI director added that the tax collection system will 
be 
quite simple since all financial institutions already have their 
own control procedures in place to allow rapid supervision of 
the taxes collected. 
  The tax on bank debits will be implemented on 2 May through 
31 December. The government estimates that it will collect 
approximately 100 million bolivares during that time. Likewise, 
the 0.75 percent tax will be levied on all Caracas Stock 
Exchange operations with the understanding that only the first 
check of each operation will be taxed. 
  The other two laws approved by the Council of Ministers 
include reforms to the budget law and the law regulating bids 
for public projects and services, which will go into effect once 
published in the official gazette. 
  Following is the full text of the decree-law establishing 
the 
bank debit tax on accounts at the country's financial 
institutions. 
  Rafael Caldera, president of the Republic 
  In full use of the powers conferred by Paragraph 8, Article 
190 of the Constitution, and in accordance with what is 
established in No. 4, Article 1 of the Basic Law authorizing 
the president of the Republic to adopt extraordinary measures 
related to economic and financial issues during the Council of 
Ministers; 
  Mandates with rank and force of law: 
<H5>  Decree Establishing a Tax on Debits to Accounts Held With </H5>
Financial Institutions 
  Article 1. A tax is hereby levied on all individuals, legal 
entities, communities, societies, or corporations which, as a 
result of being account holders, authorize fund withdrawals or 
other debits from their respective checking or savings accounts, 
deposits in custody as liquid assets, or any other type of 
demand deposits, fiduciary funds, or other financial market 
assets. The tax will apply to the issuance of cashiers checks or 
any other type of operation by any financial institution 
regulated by the General Banking and Financial Law, by the 
National System of Savings and Loan Law, by the Central Bank 
Law, and by the other special laws regulating banks and credit 
institutions. 
  The general rate of this tax shall be zero point 
seventy-five 
percent (0.75 percent). 
  Article 2. The tax base is configured and therefore stems 
from the obligation to pay the tax when a debit or withdrawal 
from any of the accounts, deposits, or funds referred to in the 
preceding article is made or when a cashier's check is issued. 
  Article 3. The payment or liquidation made by financial 
institutions on behalf of third parties regarding credit, 
rights, or assets represents the tax base, provided such 
payments have not been made to the beneficiary in checking or 
savings accounts or in cash deposits. 
  Article 4. The obligation to pay the tax will prevail even 
if 
the recording of the debit entails the cancellation of the 
corresponding account, in which case such cancellation can be 
made only after the corresponding tax is paid. 
  Article 5. Financial investments of any kind can be made 
only by way of debits from the accounts or deposits of the 
investment holder. 
  Proceeds from the sale, transfer, or renewal of financial 
investments referred to in this article, as well as of assets 
involving loans granted by financial institutions, must be paid 
exclusively to the beneficiary with a nonendorsable check or 
credited to his account. 
  Article 6. The taxable income will consist of the gross 
debit 
or taxable transaction prior to the deduction of commissions or 
expenses, regardless of their nature. 
  The taxable income of transactions carried out by the stock 
exchange will be made up exclusively of security shares [titulos 
valores] offered to the public and issued in accordance with the 
Law on Market Capitals, Basic Law on Public Credit, and Basic 
Law of the Central Bank of Venezuela, as the case may be. 
  Article 7. Stock markets and stockbrokers, in keeping with 
controls imposed by this decree, must keep special files on all 
transactions made by investors. 
  Article 8. The responsible institutions must register as a 
debit the tax produced [impuesto causado] by virtue of this 
decree. They will transfer it to a National Treasury account 
that will be opened at the Central Bank of Venezuela on the 
first banking day following the day when a debit is made to the 
taxpayer's account through forms that tax authorities will edit 
or authorize for this purpose. 
  Article 9. Financial institutions are responsible for the 
obligations imposed by this decree. Thus, such institutions must 
pay the taxes that taxpayers fail to pay in any taxable 
transaction for which they serve as intermediary. 
  Article 10. For the purpose of this decree only, the holders 
of accounts, deposits, funds, and other assets specified in 
Article 1 must pay the taxes established by it for the 
endorsement or transfer of checks or securities that are 
representative of taxable operations starting with the second 
endorsement or transfer, inclusive. Taxpayers may indicate 
"nonendorsable" or "endorsable only once" on the reverse of 
securities. 
  In the case of transactions made through the stock market, 
the tax will be applied only to the first purchase for the 
corresponding title. 
  Article 11. The following will be exempt from payment of 
this 
tax: 
  a) The Republic, states, municipalities, Central Bank of 
Venezuela, Venezuelan Investment Fund, National Savings and 
Loans Bank, autonomous institutions, education institutions duly 
registered and authorized by the Education Ministry, and public 
and private universities. 
  b) Debits that result from cash reserve accounts held in 
the Central Bank of Venezuela. 
  c) Transactions between the National Savings and Loans 
Bank and savings and loans organizations. 
  d) Transactions between the Central Bank of Venezuela and 
Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation and its affiliates. 
  e) Debits to accounts caused by the payment of the tax 
established in this decree. 
  f) Debits on checking or savings accounts, ready cash 
funds, and other cash deposit accounts that are accredited 
indistinctly to an account of the same nature, to the same 
account holders, and at the same financial institutions. 
  This exemption does not apply to accounts that are 
transferable, either jointly or separately, by individuals and 
established by more than two account holders. It is also not 
applicable to any account transferable by more than one legal 
entity. 
  i) The issuance of cashiers checks to be applied to an 
operation that has generated and paid the tax established in 
this decree. 
  i) Transactions carried out on the interbanking market 
that have terms of less than five consecutive days. 
  Article 12. The tax administration will dictate the required 
norms and procedures and impart the administrative instructions 
necessary to implement, collect, control, inspect, and prompt 
compliance with the tax established in this decree. 
  This exemption is not applicable to consulates and honorary 
consuls. 
  h) Debits corresponding to entries and corrections 
[asientos y reversos] due to material errors or annulment of 
operations previously accredited to the account. 
  g) Debits on checking accounts of diplomatic or consular 
missions, international organization representations, and their 
foreign officials accredited in Venezuela. 
  Article 13. This decree will go into effect on 2 May 1994 
and will remain in effect until 31 December 1994. 
  Issued in Caracas on 20 April 1994 
  184th Year of Independence and 135th Year of the 
Federation. 
  Rafael Caldera

<F P=106> [Interview with Miami news correspondent Marcos Castellon by </F>
journalist Roberto Cavada and unidentified announcer at the 
Radio Rebelde studio in Havana on the "Doing Radio" program -- 
live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Announcer]: You have been 
listening to that voice, one you are accustomed to hearing on 
the "Doing Radio" program. For a month or so now, we have been 
chatting with Marcos Castellon in Florida; but now we have him 
here, live, in person, a guest at the [emigre] conference and a 
guest on our program today. Good morning. [passage omitted] 
  [Cavada] Marcos, I think we could begin -- and later go into 
other things -- with last night's big news, which is that Cuban 
President Fidel Castro received all the participants at a 
reception. Very briefly, what did you think of the meeting? How 
was it? 
  [Castellon] The first thing I have to tell you is that we 
all 
attended. I think everyone who was invited to the conference was 
there last night at the Convention Center [place as heard]. And 
everything unfolded within the atmosphere that prevailed 
throughout the conference: a climate of complete normalcy. 
  We all had the opportunity to say hello to President Fidel 
Castro. In many cases he recalled details -- because there were 
many people with whom he had had contact in the past, at some 
other stage in his life. Then he moved into the hall where we 
were all talking. But a climate of complete normalcy. I mean, in 
the same tone in which all this has been unfolding. It was very 
interesting. [passage omitted] 
  [Cavada] In this connection, Marcos, what do you think -- 
apart from the point that you noted -- were other important 
things about the conference? 
  [Castellon] I would like to highlight a conclusion that I 
have drawn, and I hope that many of us who participated in the 
conference also understood it this way. One thing became clear: 
First, the very fact of convening the conference, as was pointed 
out several times, is a demonstration of firmness but is, above 
all, a demonstration of respect and, I could also say, of 
humility. The only thing the Cuban authorities have asked of 
this group of us who have come to Havana, the only thing that 
has been asked of us is understanding. Nothing more. 
  [Cavada] People were saying, before the conference took 
place, that it was going to be a failure. Or rather, not a 
failure but what the Cuban Government wanted it to be, because 
it was a meeting among friends -- that there would be no 
divergent opinions. After spending three days yourself, sitting 
there, listening, and participating, is that the way it was? 
  [Castellon] Look, aside from the testimony you people, and 
all the Cuban and international press, have been able to gather 
through all those interviews, about the diversity of opinion 
there was among us, I can guarantee that I know personally, and 
live with, in Miami, many of the people who were there; I know 
how they think. I know what their ideological and political 
backgrounds are. Basically, if there is one thing we have in 
common, it is that there are no fanatics among us... 
  [Cavada] Yes. 
  [Castellon] But within that lack of fanaticism, there is 
extraordinary diversity, an extraordinarily broad gamut of 
differences in ways of thinking. This has not been a meeting of 
friends. It cannot be denied that there are friends among the 
participants; but there are also others who are not such great 
friends. And others who are frankly not friends at all. 
  [Announcer] But, as Eusebio Leal was saying, decent people. 
  [Castellon] Yes, indeed. And everything unfolded in a 
climate 
of absolute respect for the differences, on both sides. Because 
the point is not to accentuate differences but rather to seek 
out that which unites us, and build on that. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] All right, so you are leaving tomorrow morning. 
And day after tomorrow, you will be informing us. 
  [Castellon] Indeed I will. We will continue "Doing Radio" 
from Miami, and now with even greater reason, for you people 
here in Havana. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Passage within quotation marks in Creole] </F>
  [Text] A police raid took place in Raboteau, Gonaives on 15 
April. Four or five people were shot during this raid in the 
slum area of Raboteau. According to a police source, the 
operation was held to find some unidentified armed people. A 
witness reports the facts to Clarence Renois: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified witness ] "The situation is 
not at all good for the people in Raboteau. Since last weekend, 
the people have been dealing with a massacre. For instance, on 
the night of 17 April to 18 April, the military came into the 
area because they were looking for a man called Arnault Mtayer, 
also known as "El Cubano." According to the police, he is armed 
and leads a small, heavily armed group. They have been searching 
for these men for a long time in order to arrest them. 
  ``The police want to know from where they get their weapons? 
Police never got to arrest these men, and innocent people paid 
for it. Many people were beaten by FRAPH [Revolutionary Front 
for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti] members who came with 
the military. Many people were arrested, and on 19 April, the 
police released some of them after interrogating them. They did 
not go to court. The people were asked questions, then released 
between 19 and 20 April. 
  ``On 22 April, while the population was carrying on its 
daily 
activities, police arrived in the area. People who lived near 
the abattoir [as heard] took to the sea to escape, but even the 
sea was full of military and heavy weapons." 
  [Renois] "All of that took place in Raboteau?" 
  [Witness] "It took place in Raboteau over the past weekend. 
Some people died. On Saturday, another body was found, making 
it four people dead. Other corpses might be soon found because 
many fishermen, who were just returning from fishing, were 
reportedly shot down by the military, according to people from 
the area. 
  ``The people have abandoned Raboteau for some other towns 
near Gonaives. It is a total massacre that the people in 
Raboteau are facing, with the police searching for Mtayer, also 
known as `El Cubano.'" 
  [Renois] "What do the police accuse those wanted people of 
doing?" 
  [Witness] "The police say those people carry weapons. So the 
police want to arrest them in order to find out where those 
weapons come from." 
  [Renois] "What kind of actions did the unidentified armed 
men 
take? Are they criminal actions or political acts that they 
would be involved in?" 
  [Witness] "I believe that if they were criminal actions, 
people from the area would have stopped them instead of letting 
the police search for them. I believe if the people in the area 
did not stop those armed people, it is because they do not have 
any problem with the people living in this area." [end recording]

Klaus today informed Argentina's President Carlos Menem about 
his proposal to create a free-trade zone between the two 
countries which is embedded in the governmental memorandum of 
understanding signed on Tuesday night. 
  The two statesmen also discussed Menem's initiative to 
create 
"white helmets" within the United Nations to fight hunger in the 
world, similar to the peace-keeping blue helmets. 
  Later Klaus ended his three-day official visit to Argentina 
and left for Chile, a second stop on his ten-day tour of South

<F P=106> [Article by Atilio Bleta; Copyrighted by CLARIN] </F>
  [Text] There is a strange mixture within the Grand Front of 
happiness over the 10 April elections and a fear of being unable 
to respond to the favorable expectations that emerged from part 
of society. 
  The happiness results from more than 2 million votes (nearly 
four times as many as in the previous election) for this 
alliance nationwide, victory with a 13 point lead in the Federal 
Capital, nearly 1 million votes in Buenos Aires Province, 29.2 
percent in Neuquen Province (in October 1993 it only obtained 
1.9 percent), and progress in Entre Rios Province (up from 2.4 
to 12.4 percent), Chaco Province (up from 0.4 to 5.4 percent), 
Tierra del Fuego Province (up from 1.6 to 5.1 percent), Santa Fe 
Province (up from 1.3 to 10.2 percent), and Cordoba Province (up 
from 0.3 to 5.7 percent). 
  There are also reasons for concern because within the next 
few months the center-left alliance must become 
institutionalized, make itself felt throughout the country, 
resolve its policy regarding alliances, and devise an 
alternative to the government's program. 
  The Grand Front was born a year ago from the Union of the 
South, headed by Fernando "Pino" Solanas, (which obtained 8 
percent of the vote in the election for senator for the Federal 
Capital in 1992), and the Fredejuso [Front for Democracy and 
Social Justice], headed by Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez. 
  Following the good results obtained on 3 October, the Front 
began a regrouping process, seeking to become something more 
than a group of "parties in disuse," according to Alvarez' 
definition. 
  [Christian Democrat Deputy] Carlos Auyero's preaching 
convinced several parties (Democratic and Popular Left, Popular 
Intransigence, and 29 May Movement) to create a new party called 
The New Progressive Opening [Nuevo Espacio Progresista]. 
  Alvarez' influence convinced the Fredejuso (where dissident 
Peronists, two factions of the Intransigent Party, Popular 
Protagonism, and a communist splinter group coexist) to function 
as a political party. 
  The Front also includes another Peronist splinter group, the 
Southern Proposal that is headed by Pino Solanas, the Popular 
Encounter (principally made up of Peronist dissidents headed by 
Luis Brunatti), the Communist Party, and the so-called "social 
opening" which operates through unions and other intermediate 
organizations. 
  For the 10 April elections, this alliance was able to speak 
about the Front and not the parties that make it up. The 
national board on 14 April decided to expedite the 
institutionalization process and support "a new and prevailing 
identity" because they know "they cannot continue the way they 
are." 
  The leaders want the Front to become a political party with 
legal status, a program, and a system for electing candidates, 
which could well be through open internal elections. 
  Different aspects must be considered when implementing the 
reorganization: 
  Chaco Alvarez and those who support him believe the new 
identity must be obtained when the program and the tactics for 
1995 are discussed. They do not like the thought of 
institutionalizing factions because they say it would be like 
"fencing in dissidence." 
  Auyero and Graciela Fernandez Meijide prefer to function as 
a 
single party with the people of Alvarez and Solanas in order to 
form the leadership of the alliance. 
  Brunatti is also betting on consolidating the Front as a 
party, but he views the strong internal currents coexisting 
within it. 
  The Communist Party is projecting its transformation into a 
"new political force" in order to use "everything" to favor the 
Front. 
  The institutional space required by social organizations 
must 
also be resolved. Unionists Mary Sanchez (CTERA [Confederation 
of Education Workers of the Argentine Republic]-Buenos Aires) 
and Alberto Piccinini (UOM [Metalworkers Union]-Santa Fe 
Province) were elected on 10 April as members of the Constituent 
Assembly. 
  The Front's national board resolved to postpone the debate 
regarding candidacies until the institutionalization facet is 
over, although Chacho Alvarez and Pino Solanas are tipped to 
head the presidential slate.

  [Text] The arrival of foreign capital in the country and 
the high interest rate policy are increasing the government 
domestic public debt. The exchange balance in March stood at 
$1.735 billion. Although this balance was 32 percent lower than 
February's when it totalled $2.528 billion, the government was 
forced to issue 289.8 million real cruzeiros in certificates to 
prevent the monetary base from increasing. Particularly because 
the demand for foreign exchange in March was also less than the 
February one. 
  The high interest rate policy, which was adopted at the end 
of last year, has increased the federal domestic public debt 
balance from 7.7 percent of the GDP to 8.8 percent in March. In 
nominal terms, the domestic public debt balance in March was 
49.75 percent higher than February's. In real terms, however, 
after deducting the March inflation rate, the increase totalled 
only 3.99 percent. From January to March, the federal domestic 
public debt increased 14.36 percent above the inflation rate. 
The international reserves increased $1.4 billion in February, 
increasing the balance to $30.5 billion.

convened by the Cuban Foreign Ministry. The conference opened 
today at the Conventions Palace. 
  Cubans residing in several dozen countries accepted official 
invitations. This morning, they opened a meeting that favors 
the normalization of relations between Cuba and Cuban nationals 
living abroad.

a 
special speech on the nation's official migration policy.

Revolutionary Committee-General Command of the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army in the Chiapas State mountains of southeastern 
Mexico on 20 April] 
  [Text] Communique by the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary 
Committee-General Command (CCRI-GC) of the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army [EZLN], Mexico. 
  20 April 1994. 
  To the people of Mexico: 
  To all the peoples and governments of the world: 
  To the national and international media: 
  Brothers: 
  The CCRI-GC of the EZLN addresses you to point out the 
following: 
  First -- The EZLN acknowledges the honest and serious 
efforts by Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for Peace and 
Reconciliation in Chiapas, and mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz to 
create favorable conditions that may lead to the continuation of 
the dialogue, the objective of which is to ensure a just and 
dignified peace. During the past days, the commissioner as well 
as the mediator have sought to solve several obstacles that 
block the peace process. The EZLN applauds the genuine 
disposition of these two Mexicans. 
  Second -- The EZLN applauds the release of several 
civilians, 
unfairly charged with being members of our troops, and sees this 
as a good sign leading to the continuation of the dialogue for a 
just and dignified peace. 
  Third -- In return, the CCRI-GC of the EZLN hereby orders 
the 
partial deactivation of the red alert in effect throughout its 
territory, and the return of part of its troops to their 
respective communities and ejidos as of 23 April 1994. 
  Fourth -- If this favorable climate to a dialogue continues, 
the EZLN will renew the consultation process with its grass 
roots as soon as possible, at regular intervals and beginning 
with those less vulnerable territories. 
  Fifth -- The EZLN reiterates its disposition to a true 
political solution to those just demands that motivates its 
struggle, and applauds the sincere efforts by the Mexican 
civilian society as well as all personalities to search for 
dignified solutions to crucial national problems through reason 
and not through force. 
  Continuing with our popular demands for liberty, justice 
democracy for all Mexicans. Liberty! Justice! Democracy! 
Respectfully: 
  [Signed] Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee -- EZLN 
General Command. General Headquarters. 
  [Issued] Southeastern Mexican mountains, Chiapas State, 
Mexico, [no date as published] April 1994.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Guatemalan National Revolutionary </F>
Unity, URNG, General Command on 19 April; place not given] 
  [Text] The serious damage from Guatemala's political and 
social situation in the past few weeks calls for prompt and 
specific measures. We cannot continue on this level of 
uncertainty and confusion. 
  Deeply concerned by the current situation, which endangers 
the legitimate hopes of the Guatemalan people, hopes that will 
be dashed by a situation imposed by groups opposed to a 
political solution and just and democratic peace, and in light 
of the government's delay in directing and defining its 
policies, the URNG General Command states to the people of 
Guatemala and the international community: 
  Today marks the third week since the solemn signing of the 
Global Agreement on Human Rights, a historic document intended 
to have an immediate impact on the country's social and 
political life if it is seriously implemented. 
  It is disquieting that, to date, there has been no specific 
proof of the government's political willingness to implement the 
agreement. Twenty-one days have passed and the government has 
not complied with the simplest point in the agreement; that is, 
to advise the people, through massive multilingual campaigns and 
the media, of the contents of such an important document. 
  Quite the contrary has occurred. Instead of carrying out 
this indispensable, instructional task, the government has 
undertaken a strong campaign to confuse and misinform the people 
of the contents of the agreements. The government is spreading 
misleading facts to try to promote the image that the URNG is 
disintegrating as a fighting force, something that we have 
described on several occasions as a dirty trick by the Armed 
Forces. 
  Most serious of all is the fact that since the signing of 
the 
Global Agreement on Human Rights, there has been a wave of 
attacks on prominent people that is being condemned by everyone. 
In addition, intimidation based on threats and charges against 
people and religious organizations called to play an important 
role of the Civilian Society Assembly [Asamblea de la Sociedad 
Civil] in the negotiation process has continued. 
  All this represents not only a violation of human rights but 
also a clear disregard for the agreements and an intention to 
hinder their implementation. It would be very bad to keep 
silent and not warn of the serious implications this has for the 
present and future of the country. 
  Everyone is aware of the destabilization plan to block the 
negotiation process. It is indispensable to point out that the 
government's policy to confront this situation is incoherent. 
  The government's security forces are obligated to clarify 
these criminal actions. They can do it because they know the 
origin of the plan and how it operates. The government of the 
Republic must act firmly, openly, and efficiently toward that 
end. 
  It is unacceptable and censurable for the answer to be a 
display of military force, the presence of which is directed at 
intimidating the people. Establishing an illegal state of siege 
will not solve the problems of crime or public insecurity; on 
the contrary, it will inhibit and hamper the people's ability to 
express themselves, to protest, and to denounce what is wrong. 
  For all of the above, the URNG General Command hereby 
demands: 
  That the government strictly abide by the General Agreement 
on Human Rights, without delay in all of its points; 
  That there be strong action taken against the destabilizing 
forces to denounce and identify them and to bring them to 
justice; 
  That work begin immediately to divulge the complete text of 
the General Agreement on Human Rights and the commitment 
agreement to discuss and reach a consensus on the composition, 
operation, and authority of the Investigation Commission to 
clarify all human rights violations committed during the 
country's armed conflict; 
  That the deployed military forces be withdrawn; 
  That urgent action be taken to end the intimidation and 
terror certain sectors of public security organizations are 
inflicting upon civilian organizations and their leaders, under 
the cover of anonymity; 
  That Army organizations cease their campaigns of 
misinformation and manipulation and that other government 
officials who are part of the peace process be prohibited from 
repeating such information. 
  The URNG calls upon all sectors of society not to be 
intimidated or inhibited, to speak out loudly against any form 
of threat or cohesion, and to strongly demand complete 
fulfillment of the General Agreement on Human Rights. 
  The URNG calls on the international community to be 
vigilant, 
now more than ever, on the fulfillment of the General Agreement 
on Human Rights at this particularly critical and dangerous 
moment and to offer the Guatemalan people and their 
organizations its full support, as they fight their decisive 
battles at this time. 
  [Signed] URNG General Command 
  [Dated] 19 April 1994

  [Text] If Panama does not take a tough stand against drug 
traffickers operating along the Colombian border, in the future 
they will not only grow coca, but also poppy, Government 
Minister Jacobo Salas told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA. 
  "Panama is not only a place where drug trafficking occurs, 
but also a place where coca plants are grown, and, in the 
future, if not given the proper attention, poppy fields will 
also be planted," Minister Salas said after reporting that, in 
the Darien region, 200 hectares of coca plants were destroyed 
with herbicides in the latest police operation in March. The 
official added that every citizen must become aware of the 
necessity of taking financial steps to equip police with new 
helicopters to patrol Darien to detect coca plantations. 
  "The number of police units in Darien must be increased. At 
the same time, they must be adequately equipped to combat the 
drug traffickers who use the Darien jungle to grow and process 
the drug," Salas added. 
  The government and justice minister believes the 
Colombian-Panamanian Treaty that is being advanced by both 
countries not only will define the borders and outline special 
services for immigration, customs, and drug trafficking, but 
that it also will help keep Colombian rebels from using Darien 
as a base. 
  "I think the danger is alarming, and I hope that with the 
conclusion of this treaty, which should reach the Legislative 
Assembly soon, agreements will be formalized that will allow the 
two countries to join forces to prevent these crimes," Salas 
added. 
  He also asked the deputies of the National Assembly's Drug 
Commission to approve the anti-drug bill as soon as possible. 
"This bill should be approved because there is not one family in 
Panama that is exempt from the possibility that one of its 
members, especially a son or daughter, could have a drug 
problem," Salas said.

  [Text] Santiago, Chile, 24 Apr (EFE) -- The Santiago 
newspaper EL MERCURIO on 24 April carries remarks by Argentine 
Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella in which he totally 
rules out the use of force to obtain sovereignty over the 
Malvinas Islands. 
  Petrella contends that "every solution based on the use of 
force sooner or later causes problems and grievances." This is 
why "the war was so bad for Argentina." 
  Petrella said the war "destroyed the domestic consensus in 
Argentina and its consequences are there for everyone to see. 
It also prompted British diplomacy to be much more cautious." 
Moreover, it caused the British and the Kelpers to mistrust 
Argentina. 
  Ruling out the use of force, Petrella notes that it is 
unethical, it does not offer any solutions, and besides "we 
value and need relations with the United Kingdom and with 
Europe, which is practically one and the same thing." 
  The deputy foreign minister hailed the lifting by United 
States and Europe of the embargo on the sale of weapons to 
Argentina. He especially regretted that Great Britain has not 
yet lifted its embargo, "because a considerable part of 
Argentine military hardware was traditionally British." 
  Petrella said Argentina does not need the oil that 
reportedly 
exists in the South Atlantic, as "it has huge reserves, while 
more and more oil fields are being discovered." Argentina 
intends, however, "to prevent the Malvinas Islands' 
administration and the United Kingdom from acting unilaterally," 
as "the legitimacy of any investment would prompt legal problems 
because it is an area under dispute."

<F P=106> [Interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus with </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [O GLOBO] Your privatization program is considered a 
success. Some analysts nonetheless consider that the situation 
could change, with the cutting of subsidies to companies. What 
do you think of this? 
  [Klaus] The foreign media always state that we have a low 
unemployment rate because companies continue to receive 
subsidies. A bankruptcy law, as the West understands it, has 
existed in our country for more than a year, and the government 
does not interfere in bankruptcy processes. The low 
unemployment rate is due to the effort made by companies to 
reorganize themselves and seek new markets and products. 
  [O GLOBO] Why didn't the GDP of your country increase last 
year? 
  [Klaus] The Czech Republic is completing its radical 
transformation to create a market economy. One of the 
inevitable phenomena is the elimination of several activities 
linked with central planning, which in a market economy cannot 
survive. 
  [O GLOBO] What will be the benefits to joining the European 
Union? 
  [Klaus] Given that our most important partners are or will 
be 
members of the EU, and given our links with a more integrated 
Europe, our association is essential.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments through 19 April. 
  Finance Minister Cesar Robalino announced on 5 April that 
the 
government signed a letter of intent with the IMF according to 
which Ecuador agreed to reduce inflation to 20 percent by the 
end of 1994 and cut the fiscal deficit to 0.5 percent of GNP. 
The agreements are directed at renegotiating the county's 
$12.6-billion foreign debt and seeking new loans. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 1844 GMT 5 Apr 94) 
  The Defense Ministry announced that routes and frequencies 
currently belonging to Ecuatoriana de Aviacion were ceded to 
several other companies on a temporary basis. Defense Minister 
Jose Gallardo said that "once the inactive airline resumes 
operations, the beneficiaries will relinquish the routes." 
(Quito Voz de los Andes in Spanish 2300 GMT 5 Apr 94) 
  A recent government report states that foreign reserves 
increased 4.39 percent in March over the previous month. 
Reserves now total $1.331 billion. According to a Central Bank 
official, this represents an influx of $56 million. The 
official said that there is increased confidence in Ecuador's 
economic future following the recent implementation of 
government measures. (Quito Voz de los Andes in Spanish 2300 
GMT 11 Apr 94) 
  Ecuador's international monetary reserves set a new internal 
record in March by totaling $1.3 billion, the 15th best 
registration since 13 years ago when the economic indicator 
totaled $563 million. (Quito Voz de los Andes in Spanish 2300 
GMT 12 Apr 94)

<F P=106> [Editorial:"The Constitutional Reform Rests in Peace] </F>
  [Text] Having failed to muster 21 votes in the Senate--as 
required under Paragraph D, Article 331 of the Constitution--the 
Constitutional Reform Bill submitted by the so-called Group of 
Five (Radical Batlleism, the MNR [National Rocha Movement], the 
PGP [Party of the Government by the People], the MRV [Renewal 
and Victory Movement], and the Herreraist Sector) will rest in 
peace unless the signatures of 10 percent of the electorate are 
collected or a proposal by two-fifths of the full membership of 
the General Assembly is approved, in which case said proposal 
will be submitted to a plebiscite at the forthcoming elections. 
  This seems to be the end (unless there is an unexpected turn 
of events) of an attempt to reform the Constitution, which, at 
the end of last year and after many changes, had received the 
support of all the political spectrum. At that time a poorly 
supported proposal seemed to be struggling toward a reform of 
the electoral system and relations between the three branches of 
government. When electoral interests later began to take 
precedence over everything else--the reform should have been 
ready for the forthcoming November elections--a stalemate was 
reached. This logical and predictable state of affairs 
culminated in the aforementioned vote on 14 April. 
  In all likelihood we will have no constitutional reform 
unless either of the mechanisms mentioned above are implemented, 
or some sectorial interest obtains constitutional protection (as 
was the case with old-age pensioners in 1989). We are not very 
concerned about this since we have already voiced our skepticism 
in previous editorials about the timeliness of such reform (it 
was obvious that citizens were a little carried away by this 
initiative, moreover it was too close to the elections for it to 
materialize) and its purpose (to modifying the electoral system) 
lost importance as new sectors became involved. What seemed to 
be an important reform of the system of proportional 
representation and greater freedom for voters became merely a 
set of limited proposals that sought to reform practically 
nothing of substance within the Constitution. 
  It is obvious that we need a true constitutional reform to 
eliminate many of the superfluous or harmful articles and 
chapters of our Magna Carta. For the time being, we should trim 
the excess fat off the Constitution, reducing it to no more than 
150 articles. A concise part describing the principles of our 
system of government and the inalienable rights of individuals, 
with another part establishing the organization of the branches 
of government and their interrelation would suffice for our 
Constitution. There are too many provisions granting rights 
which nobody can claim in court (right to health, to a decent 
home, etc.), which results from a way of thinking that deemed 
that the law could allegedly confer happiness and prosperity on 
all the inhabitants of the Republic. 
  All provisions pertaining to autonomous bodies and 
government-owned enterprises are also unnecessary in the 
Constitution, as they should be regulated by law. The same holds 
true for the provisions that deal with elections, which are 
totally out of place in a constitutional text. A concise, 
concrete, and terse Constitution is the best guarantee of 
citizens' rights and of the proper functioning of our 
institutions. 
  And yet, we must not become obsessed with the idea that 
amending the Constitution and the electoral system is of 
paramount importance because it would be of no avail unless a 
matching change occurs in the behavior of political leaders. We 
need only look at the recent elections in Italy--following the 
change in the electoral system, when a total reorganization of 
political parties ensued. The vices that this change sought to 
weed out continue unabated and the task of forming a government 
is today as elusive as it was in the past, if not more so. 
Constitutions are not valid substitutes for leaders who serve 
their country rather than their party interests. 
  This constitutional reform rests in peace. Our country 
continues to await a true reform. A change in its rulers and 
citizens' mentality and behavior is even more necessary. Or, as 
Walt Whitman [1819-1892] said, we need people like those who 
wrote the U.S. Constitution, as they could make any constitution 
work. In other words, texts are less important than the people 
who translate them into reality.

  [Text] This afternoon, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba 
visited centers of the western scientific hub and made 
statements to this newscast. 
  [Begin recording in English with simultaneous translation 
into Spanish] [unidentified reporter] This afternoon, the 
official conversations between Cuba and Zambia began. What is 
the result of this first session, and what types of cooperation 
will be established between Cuba and Zambia? 
  [Chiluba] The discussions were held in a very cordial 
atmosphere. We learned a great deal from President Fidel Castro 
in all areas. We discussed cooperation in the fields of health 
care; agriculture; the biotechnology and pharmaceutical 
industry, of course; as well as the field of tourism. We believe 
there is much that we can do to develop these areas. 
  We also looked at matters of common interest in the global 
politics of today; the problems of Angola, which are about to be 
resolved now; and the problems of Mozambique. [words indistinct] 
that today they have begun voting in South Africa in the first 
democratic elections. We believe there will be more peace in 
that area. 
  We also looked at the development of Third World countries. 
We should begin to rely on our own efforts, and with a bit of 
sweat and toil and commitment, as well as perhaps a little help 
from outside, we may manage to build strong foundations for the 
development of all countries. [end recording] 
  At the center for genetic engineering and biotechnology, 
Frederick Chiluba received a detailed explanation from Manuel 
Limonta, the director of this scientific institution, and 
expressed interest in the diverse areas of research conducted at 
the center. 
  At the Finlay Institute, he visited one of the plants for 
the 
production of vaccine and was accompanied by [Politburo member] 
Dr. Concepcion Campa, director of the Finlay Institute; and 
Gustavo Sierra, deputy director of that center. 
  For tomorrow, Zambian President Chiluba is scheduled to 
visit 
health care centers, and in the evening is scheduled to meet 
with the African ambassadors accredited in our country.

  [Text] Today, on the third day of his visit to Cuba, 
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba continues a series of visits 
aimed at assessing the prospects for bilateral cooperation in 
the economic, and other, spheres. Chiluba and the delegation 
accompanying him will today tour an agricultural cooperative and 
the Hermanos Ameijeiras Clinical-Surgical Hospital. 
  Chiluba's tight agenda is evidence of his government's 
interest in exploring the possibilities for expanding bilateral 
exchanges in spheres such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, 
public health, and sports. Cuban Foreign Ministry sources say 
that there are plans for Cuban technicians to build a sugar mill 
in Zambia, with Lusaka financing the operations. 
  During its stay in Cuba, the Zambian delegation will also 
meet with Zambian youths studying in Santiago de Cuba, and will 
hold a meeting with African diplomats accredited here. 
Yesterday, Chiluba had official talks with President Fidel 
Castro and visited science centers in Havana.

  [Text] In Colombia, a Latin American meeting on science and 
technology has approved five Cuban projects on development, with 
innovations applied to the economy. These projects will be 
carried out with Spanish collaboration. 
  The approval was announced by Raul Taladrid, Cuban 
representative to the 10th meeting of the technical management 
council of the Latin American program of science and technology 
for development. Taladrid said the projects have to do with 
applying data processing to the sphere of medicine and with 
association by Cuban and Spanish businesses for mutual benefit 
through exports. The Cuban vice minister also pointed out that 
these development projects will make possible greater 
collaboration between scientific institutions of Spain and Cuba.

  [Text] His Excellency Carlos Alejandro Tello Macias, 
Mexican ambassador to Cuba, has praised the workers from the 
Miguel Fernandez Roig tobacco factory -- which is the former La 
Corona factory -- in Havana for the economic efficiency meeting 
held today in this plant, which he termed magnificent. 
  Carlos Tello highlighted the solidarity, commitment, and 
enthusiasm of the men and women of this plant, determined to 
solve current problems and to produce more, as was made evident 
at the meeting. The Mexican ambassador added that this kind of 
assembly is the best, to achieve established objectives. 
  At this base-level meeting for economic efficiency of the 
tobacco sector union at La Corona -- the first in the country -- 
the workers outlined the serious difficulties that exist in this 
area, such as the poor quality of raw materials, which affects 
productivity. They also stressed the improvements in the workers 
conditions made by the plant's administration. 
  Pedro Ross Leal, Secretary General of the Cuban Workers 
Federation and a Politburo member, has urged the Miguel 
Fernandez Roig Tobacco factory's workers to keep up the 
accomplishments achieved following the Parliaments in the 
Workplace. Ross also referred to the profits obtained by this 
group during the first quarter of this year, something that had 
not happened before. He also stressed the fact that the 
production plan was fulfilled 126 percent during this period. 
  Ross also urged the workers not to feel satisfied with these 
achievements but, instead, to strive further to perfect these 
accomplishments with more determination and efficiency.

<F P=106> [Report by Granma Province correspondent Jorge Luis Batista] </F>
  [Text] A meeting was held yesterday in Bayamo at the 
headquarters of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party 
of Cuba [PCC] to analyze the progress of the sugar harvest 
during the second 10 days of April. Alfredo Enriquez Pina, the 
PCC's top leader in Granma Province, called for increasing 
efforts during the final phase of the harvest so that the 
province will be able to fulfill its production plan at the end 
of May. 
  Enriquez Pina confirmed that even after grinding is finished 
at a given mill, the forces will be maintained, (?working) in 
cane recovery and supporting the end of the sugar harvest at any 
mills that may require support. Enriquez also stressed the need 
to pay careful attention to self-sufficiency at Basic 
Cooperative Production Units and small farmers cooperatives, and 
he suggested studying the possibility of the mills' generating 
electricity once the grinding is finished. 
  Enriquez, who is PCC first secretary in Granma Province and 
a 
member of the Central Committee, said, moreover, that we must 
increase the use of animal-powered equipment, and he called for 
giving top priority to planting and weeding cane and to 
miscellaneous food crops. 
  During this check on the progress of the harvest, the 
managers of Granma Province agroindustrial complexes explained 
that the power outages and the rains continue to conspire 
against the sugar harvest but that the workers are continuing 
their work at all posts in a dedicated manner with a view to 
enabling the province to fulfill its technical-economic plan. 
  I also report that Granma will be the site of the 
(?national) 
miscellaneous crops management council today and tomorrow [23-24 
April]. The participants in this meeting will tour miscellaneous 
crops areas of Manzanillo and Bayamo Municipalities today. 
Tomorrow, the miscellanous crops management council will meet at 
the headquarters of the PCC Provincial Committee in Bayamo.

  [Text] Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan assessed as 
generally positive the way the Basic Cooperative Production 
Units [UBPC's] are operating, stressing that a greater 
dedication to work, a more sensible use of resources, and 
increased intiative in seeking solutions to problems can be 
seen. Jordan, who is also a member of the Politburo of the 
Communist Party of Cuba, explained that because the UBPC's were 
formed very recently, it is of crucial importance to develop and 
consolidate administrative competence within them and, in short, 
learn to be better owners. 
  With reference to UBPC autonomy, Jordan warned that people 
should not confuse autonomy with anarchy, but affirmed that the 
UBPC's really are independent, and that the existence of a 
program to ensure the availability of products required by the 
population does not constitute a contradiction. 
  Jordan highlighted the role of the enterprises regarding 
their relations with the UBPC's, which includes technical and 
material support and consultation. 
  The minister highlighted the fact that some 1,400 housing 
units have been built in the first quarter [of 1994] -- the 
largest figure in history for such a period.

  [Text] Alfredo Jordan Morales, minister of agriculture and 
a Politburo member, has said in Bayamo that Basic Cooperative 
Production Unit [UBPC] workers are capable of developing many 
more initiatives to solve problems. Jordan, who participated in 
the initial phase of the Miscellaneous Crops National Council 
held in Granma, pointed out that the UBPCs have to be helped and 
supported; in this connection, he stressed the importance of 
housing construction. Jordan announced that the agriculture 
sector built 7,000 materials-efficient homes in 1993, and 1,400 
in the first quarter of 1994. Granma Province is the leader in 
this effort. 
  Jordan pointed out the need to turn performances in 
miscellaneous crops production around, nationwide, by using good 
seeds, preparing the soil properly, planting on schedule, and 
weeding consistently.

<F P=106> [Article by Fernando Davalos] </F>
  [Excerpt] There are no paradoxes or dizzying figures 
involved. The surprise potential is zero. We are speaking of a 
ready, available, and burning fuel that has enabled the country 
to produce electricity, cement, and other goods to an extent 
unprecedented in the history of Cuba--1.1 million tons of oil 
extracted in the critical year of 1993. 
  This is an undeniable record that can be attributed only to 
the integrity of the workers in the sector, who are laboring 
with materials in short supply and with badly worn technical 
facilities. These workers began production in January of this 
year at a steady rate of 25,000 barrels per day, an absolute 
record that is also unprecedented. 
  The domestic recovery of oil, spurred by the shortage of 
imported fuel, was thus pushed beyond the high-water mark of 
936,000 tons achieved in 1986 under better technical conditions. 
By way of reference, the UNO-UNO [expansion not given] campaign 
in 1992 set the previous record. In that year the total reached 
was 882,000 tons, although by then we were already short of 
replacement parts and without foreign technical aid. 
  In 1993, modern techniques for stimulating wells were 
effectively introduced by the foreign oil companies operating in 
Cuba. But only 16 percent of the total extracted in the country 
(about 170,000 tons) can be ascribed to "enhanced production," 
as these methods are called. 
  Nor can there be talk of new wells (which could almost be 
counted on one's fingers) or of spontaneous "miracle" gushers, 
nor of any sensational discoveries by these foreign firms 
either. Since this is the case, and given such difficult 
conditions, what explanation can there be for the 26-percent 
increase in oil extraction in 1993, as compared with that in the 
preceding year? 
  The skill and experience of these workers, apart from their 
honor, played a role in these results. Also, the effects of a 
series of measures set forth in the oil program previously 
approved by the highest Cuban Government bodies began to make 
themselves felt. These measures included substantially 
increasing wage rates and linking wages with labor-productive 
yields; improving working and living conditions (nutrition, 
camps, protective gear, clothing, transportation, housing, 
etc.); and careful rationalization of personnel strength, which 
was reduced to the indispensable minimum, among other things. 
  Efficiency increased, and only in this way would it have 
been 
possible to cope with the difficulties. The oil workers are 
aware, however, of the inadequacies--their own and those of 
others, which were seen in 1993, despite the achievement of the 
UNO-UNO goals. The workers say that there were also 
technical-organizational problems unrelated to the geology of 
the deposits, which have a greater extraction potential than the 
level reached (the production program for this last year had 
even been set at 1.3 million tons). 
  Thus the shortage of vessels for shipping crude oil through 
Cardenas was again a factor in 1993, although it was less 
important in that year, and some notable records were even set 
in the transportation process. Nowadays almost all of the fuel 
extracted from the so-called Varadero deposit (which is not in 
Varadero, but south of the beach that bears the same name) and 
in the fields surrounding it converges on this port in Matanzas. 
All of these fields belong to the Central Petroleum Drilling and 
Extracting Enterprise (EPEP), which achieved the highest 
production level in its history--825,000 tons--in 1993. 
  If a vessel reaches port late, this contributes to keeping 
the storage tanks on land full, which in turn makes it necessary 
to shut down wells. Once a well has been shut down, it sometimes 
takes 15 days to regain the previous extraction level. It is 
true that the use of an old oil pipeline, which has inadequate 
capacity and is in poor condition, was also a factor in this 
situation. 
  The operation of the "ship-pipeline" process of taking oil 
out of Matanzas was also affected by the unavailability of the 
steam needed to liquefy the oil to some extent for easier 
handling. In the past, this steam came from the boilers of the 
nearby Jose A. Echeverria Distillery. In 1993, there was also a 
shortage of solvents, such as the cutter stock used for the same 
purpose of reducing the viscosity of this crude oil, which is 
very dense. 
  There were technical problems of all kinds, most of which 
were overcome, one after the other. It can be said that the lack 
of supplies, in particular replacement parts for the old Soviet 
technological apparatus still in use, was a constant factor. 
Replacement equipment and other imported materials were in short 
supply, as were masks, gloves, boots, and other protective gear. 
It was necessary to employ inventiveness to find substitutes and 
to impose stricter disciplinary and organizational measures. 
  The exploitation of the wells and oilfields became 
increasingly efficient. The least productive wells were shut 
down in the course of the process, and the operation of the 
others was guaranteed. They were even protected against power 
failures. 
  The battle to increase production was very dramatic. A 
decisive role was played by geotechnical measures. At many 
sites, the method used was the recirculation underground of 
injected light oil beneath the productive zone, so as to clean 
it, leaving more space for the influx of the crude oil (this 
technique is called "PPG," [expansion not given] an analogical 
reference to the famous Cuban medicine). In 1993, pumps were 
installed at wells that had initially operated on the basis of 
spontaneous gushers and had later ceased to produce. Extraction 
pumps were also installed at other previously inactive wells 
that promised good yields. Also, the Cuban oil workers, on their 
own account, made successful use of the "enhanced production" 
technique, which they assimilated rapidly. 
  But the principal guarantee was provided by the workers. 
Lazaro Campoalegre emphasized what many people in the Central 
and Western EPEP zones had told me. "The effort made by the 
workers has been decisive. The nation's limitations have made it 
necessary to be inventive in order to keep the old equipment 
operating and to extract from each well all it can produce, so 
as not to lose a single gram." 
  Campoalegre, who is the deputy director of human resources 
in 
the Western Zone, is contemplating the rehabilitation of the 
Soviet A-50 trucks for use in well repair, aeration, and 
circulation. "This struggle depends on man, and even technology 
will not work if the human effort is lacking. Perseverance and 
the systematic checking of each well are basic. Thus more than 
ever, man provides the primary guarantee," Campoalegre says. 
  The people anticipated the difficulties. In the Central EPEP 
zone, problems developed with the seals and gears on the pump 
used for our heavy oil (the seals alone cost between $10,000 and 
$15,000). A solution was sought and found, working jointly 
within the Cupet [Cuban Petroleum Enterprise]. Now there is 
production here and there, ranging from nuts and washers to 
small-capacity extraction pumps. 
  There was a positive reaction to the difficulties, apart 
from 
the encouraging effects of the wage-scale reform implemented. 
The workers began to receive basic wage increases, as well as 
premiums based on the fulfillment of the production plan (the 
average monthly wage of 238-240 pesos increased to more than 
300). The technicians and administrative directors also 
benefitted from income adjustments based on the progress made in 
the programs. The existing jobs and the duties involved were 
studied, interchangeable tasks were introduced, and the 
organizational structure was simplified. 
  The work force was reduced and the oil enterprises began 
preparations for the introduction of the system of 
self-financing in foreign exchange. Beginning in 1993, all of 
this led to a substantial increase in efficiency, and first and 
foremost, in the production rates. 
  The oil workers adopted a labor regime wherein attention to 
the human element began to make itself felt. They began to build 
housing for themselves. Hundreds of bicycles were given to them. 
Farm plots for food self-sufficiency were established in order 
to improve the dining-room menus and to provide additional 
nutrition, from which the workers directly involved in 
production have benefitted. Transportation points inside and 
outside the oil-producing zones were organized. The Black Gold 
contest helped to mobilize this great effort. 
<H5>  The Central EPEP </H5>
  The Central Petroleum Drilling and Extracting Enterprise 
(EPEP), which covers the provinces of Matanzas and Villa Clara, 
is credited with 75 percent of domestic hydrocarbon production, 
obtained essentially from its approximately 170 active wells. 
They constitute a part of the Varadero deposit, the largest 
source of heavy crude oil in the country, located south of the 
beach that bears the same name, and the peripheral 
areas--Cantel, Serpentina, Caliza, Camarioca, Varadero South, 
and Guasimas, as well as other smaller ones. 
  Today it is within the area of this MINBAS [Ministry of 
Basic 
Industry] enterprise, which is also a part of Cuba Oil, that 
there is the most collaboration with foreign oil firms. This has 
helped somewhat to alleviate the material shortages. 
  In the year that has just begun, the employees of this 
enterprise, who are in the main the protagonists in the efforts 
made in the sector in 1993, are faced with new challenges. They 
will now continue their decisive investments and extend their 
efforts to increase the yields of more wells. In this way, they 
will be able to come close to 1 million tons. This is an 
attainable, and not a distant, goal. The challenge in 1994 will 
in addition include assimilation of new technologies, and the 
continuation and development of exchanges of mutual aid with the 
oil companies operating in the various areas. 
<H5>  The Western EPEP </H5>
  The second EPEP in Cuba is that in the western region. Its 
interests extend to Pinar del Rio and Havana, although the 
deposits are located in Boca de Jaruco (the largest one), 
Yumuri, Puerto Escondido, and Martin Mesa. 
  This EPEP has about 180 operating wells from which it 
extracted 25 percent of the total 1993 domestic hydrocarbon 
production (almost 300,000 tons). The oil produced here is of 
medium density. It is sent to the East Havana Thermoelectric 
Power Station (in Santa Cruz del Norte) and to other nearby 
points. 
  The technical base of this EPEP lies in the Caribbean--Boca 
de Jaruco--zone, from which 90 percent of this oil is extracted. 
  The gas and oil pipelines soon to be linked up with the 
electric power station mentioned above originate at these 
oilfields. This will make the current transfer of the fuel in 
drums unnecessary (at present, for example, there is one well 
there producing more than 100 tons per day thanks to a 
spontaneous gusher, so that constant rotation of the tank trucks 
is required). Foreign companies also operate within the 
territory of this advanced western oil enterprise. They are 
mainly engaged in "enhanced production," and excellent 
cooperation has developed in this connection. These 
relationships will be continued and extended in 1994 to keep 
pace with the productive goals. According to realistic 
predictions, new historic records will again be set. 
  It is not only the magnificent brigade responsible for 
capital and subterranean well repairs, entrusted with the task 
of keeping the wells operating and stimulating production, that 
merits special mention in connection with the 1993 results. It 
is reported that almost every one of the men participated in 
this extraordinary effort, despite the shortage of resources, 
suitable clothing, and footgear, and the extensive technical 
difficulties. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Juan Carlos Rivera] </F>
  [Text] The drill bit, or auger, chews into the rock and 
plunges, again and again, into the entrails of the earth. Its 
repetitious mechanical movement and the dull, muffled noise of 
the drilling tires the eyes and wearies the ears. The metal 
tower that rises 70 meters into the air, the height of an 
18-story building, stands solemn and stable despite the 
accompanying internal movement. The nearby cane fields waiting 
to be cut give the Pina oil deposit, which is located in the 
neighborhood of the Ciro Redondo Sugar Mill in Ciego de Avila, a 
distinctive appearance. 
  This deposit is not among the largest, but it is regarded by 
the experts as the most productive, and that which yields the 
product of the best quality. It belongs to the Majagua Petroleum 
Drilling and Extracting Unit (Central Basin) and was discovered 
in 1990. As of that year, the national strategy called for 
giving priority to exploratory studies at this site. There are 
now 42 drilled wells in Pina, and 32 of them are being exploited. 
  Hope can also be dressed in black. 
  Three drilling teams and a testing brigade work eight-hour 
shifts. They do rotary drilling for 10 days and testing and 
extraction for another 12 days, and then they have 240 hours 
free. Each crew is equipped with a complete trailer complex 
providing a dining room, kitchen, bathroom, three dormitories, 
recreation hall, and a family physician's consulting room. In 
this way, proper material conditions at the site are guaranteed. 
  I talked with Pedro Leal Cruz, the official in charge at the 
deposit, about why Pina is so important in terms of the nation's 
oil expectations. He told me that the quality of the so-called 
"black gold" depends basically on the API [American Petroleum 
Institute] ratings (the international index of density) 
determined and the sulfur content. The hydrocarbon produced in 
this locality is very light, with an API rating of 32. It 
contains very little sulfur. Thus, this is petroleum that is 
rich in special oils and of optimal value, comparable to the 
best produced elsewhere in the world. 
  The accompanying gas (70 to 100 cubic meters per cubic meter 
of oil) is compressed and sent to various customers for use as 
fuel or in the cutting of metals. This kind of petroleum is the 
easiest to extract and transport. 
  "Now we are using it in basic oils. We have light petroleum 
products here that can be used directly even in the engines of 
drilling equipment and automotive vehicles (in a mixture of 50 
percent crude oil and 50 percent diesel oil)," Leal says. He has 
been in this business for 33 years, working in jobs including 
assistant, drilling tower worker, and well chief. 
  Where the productivity of the deposit is concerned, I was 
told that the extraction plan for last year called for 40,300 
tons. The total actually extracted was 47,962 tons, representing 
plan fulfillment of 119 percent. The plan for the number of 
zones to be tested, or oil-bearing sites to be explored, was 
also overfulfilled by 100 percent. This year's plans call for 
the extraction of 52,750 tons. 
  Estimates of the Pina reserves for the next five years have 
already been completed, and the production forecasts are 
excellent. Other work planned includes the construction of a 
collection center and a loading facility. Both of these tasks 
are now being completed. The collection center will have a tank 
with a capacity of 1,000 cubic meters and an oil pipeline 
leading to the railroad loading facility. This will make more 
efficient and speedy transportation possible. Work is currently 
being done in collaboration with foreign firms at some wells in 
this deposit. 
<H5>  The Smell of Sulfur </H5>
  Regisfredo Aguilera Remodid has traveled almost everywhere 
in 
the country in search of vocational advancement. A native of 
Santiago de Cuba, he studied extraction technology in Havana. He 
is living now in Guanito because of a love story he did not want 
to recount, but which from every indication has the smell of 
sulfur. 
  When we met him, he was working as the head of an extraction 
crew--the principal operator--aided by three assistants. While 
we were there he told us about the fulfillment of safety norms, 
the zero accident record, and the new wage adjustments that 
include compensation for the abnormal and hazardous working 
conditions. He talked about the housing arrangements, the 
remoteness of the site, and the nocturnal nature of the work. He 
also indicated his readiness to continue in the oil extraction 
business, despite the oil and grime on his overalls and the 
shortage of available soap. 
  "We need this oil to survive," he confessed with the 
sincerest of smiles. He introduced me to the other members of 
his crew, who, like the rest of the 180 technicians, assistants, 
chemists, and engineers at the deposit, are committed to 
retaining first place in 1994 in the Black Gold Competition. 
  Next we talked with Jesus Aguila, the secretary of the 
Chemical-Mining-Energy Workers' Union in Ciego de Avila, about 
the stability of the work force employed by the Majagua Basic 
Unit of the oil enterprise (covering Pina, Cristales, 
Jatibonico, and Jarahueca, in order of extractive capacity). He 
said that during certain periods, many workers left, but that 
situation is now in the past. The work is rather well-paid, and 
the majority of the workers feel much more needed in this era of 
shortages. 
  The new structure of the self-financed unit has led to a 
certain surplus in the labor force. Because of this, many 
workers are being retrained or are going to an employment firm 
that relocates them in various tasks in the cycle. This is 
possible because our country has several hundred wells under 
exploitation, as well as collection centers, batteries of 
storage tanks, small processing plants, and other infrastructure 
facilities. There are also many kilometers of oil pipeline 
dedicated to the task of guaranteeing the extraction and 
distribution of the "miracle" hydrocarbon. The workers in Avila 
plan to extract 67,000 tons of oil this year.

<F P=106> ["First Thing" program health segment by Dr. Miguel Barroso </F>
Molina -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Barroso] Good morning, listeners. Today we are 
going to talk about the very important, overall environmental 
cleanup plan. My guest today is Dr. (Adelaida Ibaz Monet), a 
specialist in hygiene and epidemiology from Havana Province, 
whom I welcome to this program. 
  [(Ibaz)] Thank you very much, Dr. Barroso. 
  [Barroso] Adelaida, what was the origin of this Overall 
Environmental Cleanup Plan [Plan Integral de Higienizacion 
Ambiental]? And let's call it PIHA, to give it an acronym. 
  [(Ibaz)] Since 1990, because of the restrictions of the 
special period, there has been a gradual deterioration of the 
hygiene and health conditions in Havana, and of course in the 
province as well. This situation has brought with it a whole 
series of difficulties in supplying water and in chlorinating 
the water supply. There are also difficulties in treating and 
disposing of liquid wastes, as well as in collecting, 
transporting, and disposing of solid wastes. 
  Along with this has come an increase in the incidence of 
infestations of different kinds, such as mosquitoes, flies, 
cockroaches, and rodents. All this brings with it a 
deterioration in hygiene and health habits, which in turn brings 
significant changes in the incidence and mortality rates of 
contagious diseases. 
  [Barroso] Doctor, what are the contagious diseases that most 
increase in such a situation? 
  [(Ibaz)] Among them are acute diarrheas, different types of 
hepatitis, leptospirosis, etc. 
  [Barroso] And tell me: Is not cholera among these contagious 
diseases? What measures are being taken against cholera here in 
Cuba? Because we know that there is a cholera epidemic, that 
cholera is practically pandemic, in Latin America right now. 
  [(Ibaz)] As you have rightly said, the moment this cholera 
pandemic hit America, our country took pertinent measures, and 
there is an overall plan, in this connection. Our country is not 
exempt from risk, of course, and such a thing would do us 
serious damage, not just to health but also from the economic 
point of view. [passage omitted] 
  [Barroso] There is a disease you mentioned that is on the 
rise right now: leptospirosis. We know that leptospirosis is a 
disease whose symptoms resemble many other illnesses, because it 
can cause fevers. Sometimes people even have renal problems; we 
know of patients who have displayed hematuria and turned out to 
have leptospirosis. The disease can be benign but it can also be 
fatal. What strategy are you using to prevent this increase in 
leptospirosis? [sentence as heard] Which we also know to be a 
disease caused by animals, right? I mean, it is a zoonosis. 
  [(Ibaz)] That is correct. Leptospirosis is a zoonosis that 
is 
transmitted not just by dogs, as is commonly believed. There are 
other animals that can transmit the leptospira. The population 
very frequently raises pigs and other domestic animals that can 
also transmit the leptospira. 
  In Havana Province, in particular, as one of the first steps 
prior to discussing this plan for cleaning up the environment 
and after the surveying that has been done in the different 
municipalities, we have begun implementing a plan to eliminate 
rats. This plan basically entails diminishing the number of 
rodents in the province and targets certain priority centers 
such as cane camps, vacation time agricultural labor sites, food 
program camps, schools and health establishments, and centers 
where food is processed and sold. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on criminal activity and related judicial 
actions carried on Havana television in Spanish between 16 and 
22 April. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 16 
April 
report that Alexis Duque Velazquez, the manager of a consignment 
store in Havana, was arrested for embezzling the profits from 
three months' work. The crime was detected when an unscheduled 
audit was performed after employees of the store reported the 
manager to the local council. Although previous audits had not 
detected fraudulent activities, on this occasion auditors found 
that Duque Velazquez had forged contracts to cover up for the 
33,000 pesos that he had pocketed. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 22 
April 
report that three employees of a post office in San Miguel del 
Padron Municipality, Havana City Province, stole over 126,000 
pesos from the state by falsifying money orders, until caught by 
the Ministry of Communications and the Police, working together. 
In 1993, they cashed 364 false money orders, each for 
approximately 300 pesos. They got away with this for a while 
because of inefficiencies in the postal system. They were also 
able to operate because other people failed to comply fully and 
properly with the procedures for paying out and monitoring money 
orders. "To reconcile 2.5 million in money orders in one year is 
not an easy task, even if those which are false will be 
discovered in the end. However, the delay in this reconciliation 
was causing the state to lose money." "Communications now has a 
modern system that allows them to detect false money orders 
quickly."

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 27 Apr (EFE) -- The 101 Haitians who 
occupied UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) headquarters 
in Santo Domingo on 22 April withdrew from those offices today. 
Lamarre Germain, spokesman for the Haitian group, said they 
voluntarily left after reaching a number of agreements, which he 
did not describe, with UNHCR representative Juan Manuel Castro 
Magluff. 
  The agreements, according to Germain, include the 
acknowledgement that some of his fellow Haitians are political 
refugees, but he did not disclose how many of them would receive 
that status. Germain also said Castro Magluff arranged for all 
of the Haitians to be lodged at a hotel in the high altitude 
area of the Dominican capital and that, in addition, each of 
them were given 500 pesos, the equivalent of $40. Germain said 
the group will remain at the hotel under UN care until each 
person's situation is individually examined. 
  Eleven of the 101 Haitians who occupied the UNHCR 
headquarters were hospitalized and treated for tuberculosis and 
diabetes, among other diseases. The Haitians, 40 men, 20 women, 
and 32 children, occupied the UNHCR headquarters to gain 
political refugee status in the Dominican Republic.

  [Excerpts] On 22 April, between 23 and 26 persons were 
allegedly killed in the coastal city of Gonaives, northwest of 
Port-au-Prince, by soldiers during a police operation staged at 
dawn in a working-class neighborhood, according to corroborating 
sources. It is the most serious act of collective repression 
committed in a provincial city since the 30 September 1991 coup 
d'etat. The neighborhood [Raboteau], which is the main slum area 
in Gonaives and is famous for its resistance to the Duvalier 
dictatorship in 1983, is reputedly home to numerous partisans of 
President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide. [passage omitted] 
  The [Justice and Peace] Commission, which considers an 
additional investigation necessary for a final assessment of the 
event, does not rule out the possibility that even more people 
were killed or injured because the attackers fired on homes at a 
level that would compel occupants to exit. The Justice and Peace 
Commission describes the situation in Raboteau as very tragic. 
The populace, men and women of all ages as well as children, had 
to flee the area where gunfire was heard throughout throughout 
the day on 22 April. 
  The Justice and Peace Commission points out that the 22 
April 
raid, carried out by military troops and well-known members of 
the Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, 
followed a first wave of terror in Raboteau after the suspicious 
burning of tires in the streets. In fact, says the Justice and 
Peace Commission, the forces of order were looking for a man 
named Arnault Mtayer, also known as The Cuban, which gave rise 
to searches without warrants and the sacking of several houses 
in Raboteau.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 27 Apr (EFE) -- Today, the Haitian 
Army Staff justified the killing of more than 20 people on the 
evening of 22 April by soldiers and members of the Revolutionary 
Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti (FRAPH) in 
Raboteau neighborhood, Gonaives. 
  In a news release, the Armed Forces High Command said the 
killings in Raboteau resulted from an alleged act of 
destabilization plotted by supporters of President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, who was toppled by the military on 30 September 1991. 
According to the Army, this destabilization plot was part of an 
alleged scheme concocted by Washington on 21 November 1993 at a 
meeting attended by members of the government of Prime Minister 
Robert Malval and President Aristide.

  [Text] The resigning Robert Malval government says it is 
alarmed by the surge of repression affecting the deprived 
classes. It says it is alarmed by the extent of the recent surge 
of repression hitting the most vulnerable classes of the Haitian 
population and is warning all the authorities responsible for 
maintaining order that they are acting against national 
sovereignty by leaving unpunished those military and 
paramilitary groups that are devoting themselves to open 
violence, in defiance of the Constitution, the laws of the 
Republic, and morality. According to the resigning government, 
the insane acts reported by the international audio-visual media 
cast discredit on the Haitian Armed Forces and risk opening the 
way to interventionist attempts, as much as those brutalities 
worry the national conscience. 
  The government asks the commander in chief of the Armed 
Forces to advise the constitutional authorities on the measures 
taken to protect the population, and to punish the guilty who 
act with uncovered faces. Meanwhile, the government, which does 
not enjoy the cooperation of the forces of order, expresses 
solidarity with the families who are mourning their dead, their 
injured, and their missing loved ones in all regions of the 
country.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 27 Apr (AFP) -- An undetermined 
number of armed followers of President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide were killed over the weekend in the northern region of 
Borgne during a Haitian Army operation, the local correspondent 
for Radio Metropole, a private Port-au-Prince station, citing 
military sources, reported on 27 April from Cap-Haitien (260 km 
north of the capital). 
  According to the correspondent who quotes Colonel Claudel 
Josaphat, military commander of the northern department, the 
soldiers seized weapons, including a 40 MM grenade launcher, an 
AR-15 rifle, a Parabellum 9 MM pistol, explosives, and 
ammunition. The military sustained no dead. A soldier was shot 
in the foot under circumstances not yet clarified. 
  The armed followers were led by Marc Lamour, who served as 
Constituent Assembly member in 1987. He was also deputy 
delegate for the region during the mandate of Father Aristide in 
Haiti. The same source added that this operation was prompted by 
an attack by two Marc Lamour followers on a military post at 
Petit Bourg du Borgne (50 km west of Cap-Haitien) on the evening 
of 7 April. 
  Several people were arrested in Borgne and in the 
neighboring 
towns of Port Margot and Limbe. Among them was Borgne Mayor 
Belizaire Fils-Aime, who was arrested on 8 April for crimes 
against state security. The OAS-UN international civilian 
mission and the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince expressed concern 
for Fils-Aime and his family. 
  On 27 April, a reliable source from Cap-Haitien confirmed to 
AFP over the telephone that three trucks loaded with soldiers 
returned on 26 April after carrying out operations over the 
weekend in the rural area of Bassin Caiman, a cavernous region 
north of Petit Bourg du Borgne. The soldiers combed the area 
after firing mortars at a cavernous area of about two square km 
where the presence of armed men had been reported. The source 
was unable to determine the death toll. 
  The Haitian Army accused Aristide of initiating an armed 
operation known as "Operation Cut Iron" to "destabilize the 
state" since he delivered a speech in Creole in early 1994 from 
the United States. In the speech, Aristide extolled 
Jean-Jacques Dessalines, author of the 1804 Haitian independence 
and the slogan "Coupe tetes, brule cayes" (cut off heads, burn 
houses) that was used against French expeditioneers of that time. 
  Aristide spokesman Jean-Claude Martineau denied this charge. 
Speaking from Washington to Haitian stations over the telephone, 
Martineau pointed out that the military is trying to blame 
others for its own "crimes." Members of the OAS-UN civilian 
mission had planned to travel to Borgne and Gonaives on 27 
April, where 28 people, according to the most recent estimates, 
died on 22 April during a police operation in the low-income 
neighborhood of Raboteau.

  [Text] The president of the Chamber of Deputies announced 
that the executive power vacuum will probably be filled this 
week. Frantz Robert Monde, reporting on the consultations begun 
last week, indicated that the majority of sectors he met with 
expressed concern about this vacuum. The Chamber of Deputies is 
scheduled to meet soon to choose the constitutional formula 
required within the current context, according to President 
Monde who expressed himself during a news conference today: 
  [Begin Monde recording] At least if the Haitian Armed Forces 
had said no, but President Aristide said yes, we could make them 
meet and see what is negative in this plan. From there, we could 
then manage to find a consensus between the two protagonists of 
the crisis. But, one said no, and because he said no, the 
sanctions must be reinforced. This is an aberration. I therefore 
say that if the sanctions are reinforced, "greeting or not 
greeting your enemy is the same thing; he will eat you up anyway 
for something you did." Close the door on all negotiations, 
install a government, and agree to die together. [end recording]

  [Text] Almost 100 Haitian boat people were repatriated on 
25 April to Port-au-Prince by a U.S. Coast Guard patrol ship 
that intercepted them. The 98 refugees, who were trying to reach 
Florida on board a makeshift boat, were intercepted on 22 April 
in the Windward Passage between Haiti and Cuba. The boat people, 
including three children without parents, sailed from the island 
of La Tortue. 
  It should be recalled that on Saturday, 95 Haitians, 
survivors of a shipwreck on an island of the Bahamas, were 
repatriated by plane from the Bahamas to Port-au-Prince.

<F P=106> [Report by Luckenson Jean -- recorded] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] At the initiative of the 
unofficial office of the Senate of the Republic, presided over 
by Senator Bernard Sansaricq and that large group of senators 
elected on 18 January who are contested, a meeting took place at 
the Senate at approximately 1100 on Saturday, 23 April between a 
delegation of Republican congressmen from the Black Caucus and 
several Haitian opposition political parties and groups. The 
delegation of Black Caucus Republican congressmen was headed by 
Dr. (Thomas Ferguson), its chairman. [name and title as heard] 
(Ferguson) was accompanied by his wife (Siegrid Furguson) and by 
(Lerone Toltson), executive chief, assisted by Mr. (Herb 
Barsman). 
  The chairman of the Republican Black Caucus, Dr. (Furguson), 
stated he came to Haiti so as to inform the [U.S.] Congress all 
about what the delegation sees during its stay in Haiti. The 
delegation did not come to interfere in the nation's political 
affairs because Haitians have enough experience and education to 
solve their problems by themselves. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. (Furguson) went on to say that Haitians are determined 
people, and they can manage to establish democracy in Haiti. If 
foreigners do not want this, those who do not agree should leave 
Haiti and go home. Dr. (Furguson) said he talked with the Army 
commander in chief for two hours. He talked to them [not further 
identified] so they can help the Haitian people establish law 
and democracy. (Ferguson) forcefully condemned those who are 
asking that the embargo against Haiti be strengthened. [passage 
omitted] 
  After Dr. (Ferguson's) speech, more than 12 political 
leaders 
or heads of people's organizations presented their grievances to 
the black Caucus senator [position as heard], hoping he would 
pass their messages on to President Bill Clinton. 
  The secretary general of the Revolutionary Front for the 
Promotion and Progress of Haiti, which is the neo-Duvalierist 
party headed by Toto Constant, presented a somber report on 
Haiti for the period from 29 November [1987] to the present. 
Secretary General Constant seized the opportunity to ask the 
people of the United States, as a people, that is, in his 
opinion a moral people, to help the young Haitians who are the 
future of Haiti so they can rebuild the country and set it on 
the democratic track. [passage omitted] 
  For his part Hubert de Ronceray, leader of the Mobilization 
for National Development, one of the biggest opponents to 
President Aristide's return to power in Haiti, said, in a speech 
approximately 15 minutes long, Dr. (Ferguson's) presence in 
Haiti constitutes a guarantee for the progress of the democratic 
struggle. De Ronceray considers (Furguson) the ambassador for 
the Haitian cause. [passage omitted] 
  Unionist Jean-Auguste Mesyeux; Dr. Sylvan Jolibois, leader 
of 
the Patriotic Urban and Rural Union; and Richard Vladimir 
Jeanty, leader of the Haitian Party of God joined the president 
of the Senate of the Republic and Hubert de Ronceray in 
forcefully condemning the embargo. 
  In conclusion, Senator Bernard Sansaricq, president of the 
unofficial [Senate] office, who spoke like a prophet, asked Dr. 
(Furguson) to ask President Clinton to change his policy toward 
Haiti and to ask Ellen Cosgrove, a political officer of the U.S. 
Embassy in Haiti; Stanley Schrager, U.S. spokesman in Haiti; and 
Ambassador William Lacy Swing to stop interfering in Haitian 
political affairs because they, in the Senate of the Republic, 
are working very hard to find a solution to the Haitian crisis.

  [Text] Havana, 21 Apr -- More than 40 Mexican companies 
will begin trading with Cuba because of all that country has to 
offer, declared Diego Fernandez Roos, head of the CEMAI [Mexican 
Businessmen's Council for International Affairs] Latin America 
Coordination Committee. 
  During the 11th full session of the Mexican-Cuban 
Businessmen's Commission, the CEMAI established closer ties 
between Mexican businessmen and Cuban authorities to make the 
initial contacts that will allow more trade between the 
countries. 
  In an interview with EL FINANCIERO near the end of the 
businessmen's visit to Cuba, Fernandez Roos declared that there 
is a lot of disinformation about Cuba's economic situation and 
its capacity to become a real trading partner with Mexico. 
  Trade between Mexico and Cuba currently amounts to only $150 
million with a positive balance in favor of Mexican businesses. 
The chemical, agricultural and livestock, health, and 
construction sectors are among the most attractive areas for 
investment. The CEMAI representative believes political issues 
should not affect the choice of an export destination, as is the 
case with Cuba. 
  One of the most important companies participating in this 
business meeting is Jugos de Valle, a corporation that considers 
Cuba to be among its most attractive export markets. Manuel 
Albarran, director of the company's international development 
department, asserted that any company that is planning to go to 
international operations should consider Cuba because it is 
practically a "virgin" market. He said the prospects for 
introducing bottled drinks to the island are particularly 
interesting because they imply introducing new products into the 
consumption patterns of the Cuban people, a market of more than 
12 million people. 
  Albarran, who described the 11th meeting of the 
Mexican-Cuban 
Businessmen's Committee as a complete "success," declared that 
Jugos del Valle has not ruled out the possibility of making 
direct investments in Cuba. 
  Diego Fernandez explained that Cuba is ripe for foreign 
investment and asserted that Fidel Castro's government is 
seeking to widen the island's economic opening. He added that 
although the CEMAI has held 10 meetings between Mexican 
businessmen and Cuban authorities, there has never been so much 
interest shown by the two parties to increase commercial 
relations. 
  Aside from the Cuban Government's large investments in 
Mexican corporations such as Cemex, Television Azteca, and 
Mexipetrol, there are midsize companies that view Cuba as an 
interesting trading partner able to fulfill its payment 
commitments. 
  The National Foreign Trade Bank (Bancomext), in 
collaboration 
with the CEMAI, sent invitations to Mexican companies interested 
in negotiating with Cuba, which has faced a U.S. Government 
economic embargo for more than two decades. 
  Francisco Callarisa Salcedo, sales director of the Mac'Ma 
group -- cookies and pasta makers -- declared the Cuban market 
could become an important consumer of Mexican products. He 
added that it seemed illogical that although Mexico is only a 
two-hour flight from the island and only a day and a half by 
boat, countries like Spain -- Cuba's second largest commercial 
partner -- and France are conducting such a large amount of 
business with the Caribbean nation. 
  Optimistic about statements Cuban authorities will make at 
the "The Nation and the Emigrants" meeting, the first held since 
the Cuban Revolution, Mexican businessmen are convinced that 
Cuba is going through a period of change in which Mexico must 
participate. 
  "The Nation and the Emigrants" meeting begins today with the 
attendance of Cuban emigrant organizations such as Cuba Libre 
and with the certainty that Fidel Castro, the island's leader, 
has not suffered any attack, according to reports from Cuban 
Government sources. Cuban Minister Roberto Robaina will for the 
first time address Cuban emigrants, most of whom live in the 
United States, on the topic: "The Relationship between the 
Nation and the Emigrants: Current Status and Prospects."

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Gaona, Georgina Tristan, and Lucia </F>
Domville] 
  [Text] In the government's program for the six-year period 
between 1994 and 2000, foreign trade will be one of the pillars 
of the Mexican economy. Thus, private sector organizations have 
presented a package of measures, the most important of which 
are: 

  -  Total deregulation of trade and the creation of a 
one-step procedure for national exports. 
  -  Refinement of the 
country's economic opening with the strict implementation of 
mechanisms to curb unfair trade practices, because the 
government has only used dumping [previous word in English] to 
combat the entry of products from other nations. 
  -  The government 
must grant to national exporters the same support (covert 
subsidies) other governments extend to their businessmen, as is 
particularly true of the United States and Canada. 
  -  The next 
administration must finally break off its connections with 
mafias and end corruption in the country's customs offices. It 
is the only way to ensure the honest entry and departure of 
merchandise and to eliminate contraband to Mexico. 

    The private sector believes over the next six years 
international trade policy should attempt to encourage 
development banks to make loans at competitive international 
rates, eliminate bureaucracy and excessive guarantees, and allow 
loans to indirect exporters. 
  Representatives of Mexican Employers Confederation, National 
Association of the Processing Industry, Confederation of 
National Chambers of Commerce, National Association of Mexican 
Importers and Exporters, and Conacex [expansion unknown] have 
proposed certain foreign trade policies such as flexibility in 
commercial openness, which has been exercised in our 
negotiations with South American countries (Chile and the Group 
of Three), in order to evaluate trade agreements with other 
countries. 
  These organizations have proposed broad-based negotiations 
by 
goods and services groups. They have called for honesty in the 
negotiations process, whereby the community will be informed 
beforehand of the scope of negotiations, and for the 
institutionalization of the work plan jointly prepared by the 
government and the private sector for the North American Free 
Trade Agreement. 
  The business organizations are advocating gradual 
negotiations because it is fundamentally important to establish 
deadlines for the opening of the various sectors. Openings that 
are too broad or too rapid might undermine the sector's ability 
to adjust to change, and they may negatively affect its 
productive structure. 
  It is necessary to have a propensity toward exports, to 
which 
the organizations have recommended the creation of a culture of 
exportation. Presently, there is considerable assembly plant 
and export activity by foreign companies. Certain Mexican 
consortiums have been successfully exporting; it is possible to 
capitalize on this through a plan to integrate firms of various 
sizes that conduct indirect exports. Added to the problem of 
exports are the promotion policies and mechanisms that have been 
used thus far, which require the import sector's increased 
involvement in organizations that promote exports. 
  One aspect of regional development is the need to develop 
the 
private productive nature of organizations and regions 
concurrently with regional export activities. Unfair trade 
practices such as dumping [previous word in English] and 
contraband have harmed the productive infrastructure, making it 
necessary to divulge, implement, and place within the reach of 
medium- and small-sized businesses the legal mechanisms with 
which to avoid them. Furthermore, considering these mechanisms 
can be refined, the process should be accelerated. 
  Customs must face the challenge of assimilating and carrying 
out all changes; it is a key operational factor to be able to 
rely on a customs system that is trained and efficient. 
  The business groups addressed the need for a single 
organization responsible for promoting agricultural foreign 
trade; this organization would have three duties: To examine 
competitive national products. 
  To identify foreign markets, and 
  To establish an information system. 
  The business organizations say the development of the border 
area requires administrative deregulation and incentives to 
increase the competitiveness of border trade. Also required are 
consistent foreign trade policies that will allow nationals as 
well as foreigners to conduct long-term investments or 
coinvestments that will foster employment, the demand for raw 
materials and exports.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] On 25 April, Mexican President Carlos Salinas 
created the Coordinating Board for the Nation's Public Security 
[Coordinacion de Seguridad Publica de la Nacion] to improve 
efficiency in the operations of institutions involved in 
national public security, to carry out preventive actions, and 
to pursue crimes. 
  Its coordinator will be Arsenio Farell Cubillas, who until 
today was the secretary of labor and social welfare. The 
coordinating board will be under the Presidency of the republic. 
The board will coordinate national public security matters 
determined by the executive, and it will establish coordination 
mechanisms with the Attorney General's Office of the republic 
and the Attorney General's Office of the Federal District to 
increase their efficiency. 
  This coordinating board will propose the establishment of 
efficient and timely channels of communication among the 
Secretariats of Government, National Defense, and the Navy, as 
well as the Federal District Department to safeguard public 
security. This board will propose and reach coordination 
agreements with the states' attorney general's offices for the 
same purpose. 
  This decision by the chief executive, which was revealed 
hours ago, states that the situation facing Mexico underscores 
the need to coordinate the actions of the national public 
security corps and the need to improve their prevention and 
pursuance of crimes. It adds that society in general demands 
that the government redouble actions against impunity and the 
violation of public order, while respecting human rights. This 
board will start operating tomorrow. 
  The National Security Cabinet met at the Los Pinos 
Presidential Residence. The meeting was attended by the 
secretaries of government and national defense, chief of the 
Federal District Department, the republic's attorney general, 
the district's attorney general, director general of the Center 
for National Research and Security, and the chief of the 
presidential office. 
  This information is contained in a bulletin issued on the 
evening of 25 April. We think it is evident that the work done 
by existing institutions is insufficient in view of the 
magnitude of the challenge posed by the criminals. The 
institution that was born today is a sort of super-attorney 
general's office with the size demanded by society as a result 
of the growing problems posed by crime and violence. 
  President Salinas thus reacted to a public demand, a demand 
from society to fight vigorously against impunity, organized 
crime, and the proliferation of weapons because everyone bears 
pistols here. The presence of Arsenio Farell as coordinator is a 
guarantee. He was born in Mexico City in 1921. He earned a 
Bachelor and Doctorates Degree at the National University's Law 
School. He is a litigant lawyer, professor, public official, 
and author. Farell is qualified for this new post. He has what 
one expects of a coordinator: firmness and vigor, respect for 
the law, and respect for its enforcement. We expect him to 
comply with and to ensure compliance with the law.

<F P=106> [Report by Georgina Solis] </F>
  [Text] Mexico City -- Yesterday, the PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] National Political Council decided that the 
selection of its candidates for senator, federal deputy, and 
assembly member will be made through open conventions with 
democratically elected delegates. The procedure will also be 
employed to select candidates for governor in the states of 
Chiapas and Tabasco, based on the agreement that was unanimously 
approved by the 201 council members who attended the 15th 
plenary session. 
  PRI sources indicated the statutory procedure of direct 
consultation with rank-and-file members was ruled out, because 
the party could be splintered when it reaches the 21 August 
elections. They added that requesting the nominations of 
candidates, a statutory procedure, will be announced some time 
between today (Monday) and tomorrow, and that conventions will 
be held statewide next week. 
  In internal meetings, the PRI's regional and territorial 
structure will elect the delegates to the conventions. The 
council also agreed that if a convention cannot be held, the 
State Political Council or the Federal District Political 
Council will choose the candidates. It also agreed that the 
state board or Federal District board will seek consensus and 
conciliation regarding those people who may be the most faithful 
representative of the PRI's ideology and run with the greatest 
possibility of winning. 
  During the 15th plenary session of the PRI's top body, the 
delegates approved a report read by PRI National President 
Fernando Ortiz Arana in which he said the party will never stop 
demanding justice and the clarification of the murder of its 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. "In view of the 
outrage inflicted upon us, today, we are reiterating our demand 
that the investigations into the incident that brought mourning 
to Mexico fully explain motives and establish responsibilities," 
Ortiz said. 
  Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza attended this meeting as PRI 
secretary general and announced the procedures and conditions 
for choosing the candidates for governor, senator, and deputy.

  [Text] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential candidate 
for the National Action Party [PAN], is in Chiapas, where he 
commented on the debate. 
  [Begin Fernandez de Cevallos recording] I believe Dr. 
Zedillo 
suggested the three main parties hold the first debate. I, 
however, am willing to attend debates with the other candidates. 
We all have the right to participate. It would be practically 
impossible to have all the candidates in the same place at the 
same time, but I am open to the idea, and the other candidates 
will find that I am very willing to participate with them in 
many debates. Perhaps we can soon set dates to debate national 
issues and our political proposals with other candidates. [end 
recording] 
  [Further on in the same newscast, there is a recording of 
Institutional Revolutionary Candidate Ernesto Zedillo responding 
to Fernandez de Cevallos' acceptance of the debate invitation: 
"I am very pleased to know that a least one of the candidates I 
invited to this debate has responded in the most constructive 
manner possible. He has even suggested a date, 3 May, and a 
debate format. This encourages me, and I would like to tell the 
candidate who answered my invitation that I accept the date he 
suggested."]

  [Text] Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate for the 
Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD], has responded to 
Ernesto Zedillo's, presidential candidate for the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party [PRI], invitation to debate. Cardenas 
suggested 16 May for the debate. 
  [Begin Cardenas recording] I have accepted the debate 
invitation made by the ruling party's presidential candidate. 
Furthermore, I had asked for this debate and had expressed my 
wishes to the PRI and PAN [National Action Party] candidates. 
We are in contact now to establish the format for this first 
debate. I think it should be held on 16 May. This may be a 
debate between three candidates, but it is important that all 
presidential candidates have a similar opportunity before 21 
August. I hope Dr. Zedillo and I will have several 
opportunities to present our ideas and proposals to the voters. 
  We want to overcome the political, financial, and social 
crisis we are experiencing. The only solution is a democratic 
transition. We demand a clean and democratic campaign. 
Likewise, we demand clean and democratic elections so a truly 
legitimate, clean, and democratic government will be elected. 
  I wish to reiterate my invitation to Dr. Zedillo so we can 
meet several times before 21 August. I think these debates will 
be the best way for voters to see what each candidate 
represents, the interests the candidate represents, and what the 
candidate can do for the voters and the country. I hope these 
debates will contribute to your knowledge of the candidates and 
that your vote will further our country's progress and 
democracy. [end recording] 
  After hearing Cardenas' response, Ernesto Zedillo sent a 
letter to the PRD candidate stating the following: 
  The people will decide objectively if our proposals are 
contradictory in this campaign. I do not agree with your 
attempts to disqualify other candidates registered by law, nor 
can I agree with your attempt to underestimate other parties 
that represent the ideological plurality and diversity of the 
country's political life. I wish to reiterate that my invitation 
said I trust that throughout the campaign there will be 
opportunities to compare positions with all candidates from all 
parties.

  [Text] Presidential candidates of small opposition parties 
have termed the debate positive, but demanded that it be more 
open and that all candidates be allowed to participate. 
  [Begin recording] [Alvaro Perez Trevino, presidential 
candidate for the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution] 
Honestly, no debate has been agreed upon because, in reality, no 
candidate has grabbed the bull by the horns. Now Dr. Zedillo 
has dared to launch this initiative. It is alright because if 
this initiative would not have been presented, no debate would 
occur. 
  [Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, presidential candidate for the 
Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party] I will always 
maintain that a debate must be pluralistic and democratic, 
without exclusions. If there are no guarantees that all 
candidates are treated with respect and equality, I would not 
participate in debates of this nature. 
  [Marcela Lombardo Otero, presidential candidate for the 
Popular Socialist Party] If we want to strengthen and expand the 
political-democratic system in the country, it must be done by 
expanding and strengthening the multiparty system, which 
enriches proposals and projects anywhere in the world. 
  [Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate for the 
Mexican Green Ecologist Party] We are happy to be part of the 
group of political parties that have been set aside. These 
parties have not been considered for the possibility of debating 
at this level, and the possibility of gaining access to the 
presidency. Well, at least that is what they believe, but the 
reaction of neglected parties will be very powerful. 
  [Pablo Emilio Madero, presidential candidate for the Mexican 
Democratic Party] We are all presidential candidates, there are 
not only three candidates. Therefore, it would be inappropriate 
to hold the debate only amongst three people. 
  [Unidentified reporter] How would you propose that the 
debate 
be held? 
  [Madero] All candidates should be allowed to participate at 
the same time, with the same lighting, the same cameras, the 
same journalists, the same audience, and on conditions of 
equality. This will permit citizens to appreciate what each 
candidate is proposing. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 26 April. 
  Jacques Rogozinski, director of Banco de Obras Publicas and 
formerly in charge of privatization, has reported the 
privatization of the parastate and banking sectors has netted 
$24 billion in revenues for the country's treasury. He 
explained the resources allowed the Mexican Government to reduce 
internal and external debts and devote more budget funds to the 
country's social sectors. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1550 
GMT 19 Apr 94) 
  Federal Electricity Commission officials have reported the 
federal government has decided to maintain subsidies for energy 
rates "for several years." This decision applies to energy for 
domestic use and irrigation purposes at farms. (Mexico City EL 
FINANCIERO in Spanish 19 Apr 94 p 15) 
  According to reports by the Mexican Stock Exchange and 
analyses by stock brokerage firms, the capital withdrawn from 
the stock market rose to $11.39 billion between 24 February and 
15 April. Stock market reports view "the exit of foreign 
resources" together with political uncertainty and the increase 
in interest rates in the United States as factors that determine 
investors' decisions. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 19 Apr 
94 p39) 
  In just seven weeks, the Bank of Mexico increased its 
holdings of government bonds by 168.8 percent, which went from 
33.2 billion new pesos on 15 February to 89.26 billion pesos on 
15 April, due to a drop in foreign and domestic investments. 
Domestic investors dropped their holdings by 15.1 billion 
pesos, while foreign investors dropped theirs by 3.23 billion 
pesos. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 19 Apr 94 p 7) 
  Credit Suisse and Bancomer have signed an agreement worth 20 
million francs to help Mexican firms that need to import 
machinery and industrial equipment from Switzerland. Meanwhile, 
private bankers, speaking at the monthly meeting of the Mexican 
Banking Association, AMB, said "there is no danger of a 
devaluation," and financial market nervousness is due to a 
"speculative bubble that is basically political." President 
Salinas and the economic cabinet met with AMB President Roberto 
Hernandez, and Salinas said "there will be no changes in the 
country's political, economic, and social course." (Mexico City 
EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 21 Apr 94 pp 7, 4) 
  There has been an "explosive" growth in Mexican air 
transport. In 1993 alone, there were 76,000 contracts to move 
merchandise, which earned $45.5 million for nine domestic 
airlines and approximately $34 million for international 
carriers. According to the National Institute of Geography, 
Statistics, and Data Processing, INEGI, the January trade 
deficit reached $1.4 billion, despite the fact all nonoil sales 
increased compared to the 1993 figures. Mexican exports during 
January totaled $4.91 billion, a 17.2-percent increase. Imports 
totaled $5.5 billion. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 22 
Apr 94 pp 15, 20) 
  The Cemex Group will invest $400 million during 1994 to 
"increase its productive capacity in Mexico." Cemex believes 
this rate of investment will continue over the next three years 
at least. Cement production is estimated at 600,000 tons by 
1996. (Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in Spanish 22 Apr 
94 p 23a) 
  Eugenio Carrion, under secretary of the Commerce and 
Industrial Development Secretariat, Secofi, says deregulation 
for 30 staples has not driven prices up but, rather, down. 
Carrion repeated "there have been no price increases," and 
"there is no need to fear the end to price controls." (Mexico 
City LA JORNADA in Spanish 21 Apr 94 p 47) 
  Mexico earmarked $10.5 billion in 1993 exclusively to pay 
interest on its foreign debt. A Bank of Mexico report says this 
is the highest amount in six years. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in 
Spanish 25 Apr 94 pp 1, 42, 250) 
  The Bank of Mexico has reported that for the first time in 
two decades there was single digit inflation with an 8-percent 
annual inflation rate for 1993. Social expenditures, in 
relation to the Gross National Product, went from 2.6 percent in 
1988 to 4 percent in 1993 "to help raise the people's standard 
of living and encourage a more fair distribution of income," 
according to the Bank of Mexico. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1635 GMT 
26 Apr 94)

<F P=106> [News conference by President-elect Jose Maria Figueres at </F>
the Universidad Estatal a Distancia auditorium on 25 April; from 
the "Radio Reloj Newscast"; broadcast in progress -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Figueres] ...the political leaders of these 
three friendly countries, and our interest in reviewing our 
bilateral relations with them and in knowing how they view 
matters of interest to us such as NAFTA. 
  In Mexico we had the opportunity to talk with President 
Carlos Salinas about the bilateral treaty signed between Costa 
Rica and Mexico. We discussed how to implement it better and 
how to make it function effectively. We also discussed the 
situation in Central America from Costa Rica's point of view. 
We discussed issues that we should discuss at the 
Ibero-American Summit to be held in mid- June in Cartagena, 
Colombia. 
  We discussed with Mexican business leaders their 
expectations 
and aspirations for the bilateral treaty. We were accompanied 
by the presidents of the chambers of commerce of Costa Rica. 
  We discussed Mexico's political situation with Mexican 
presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo and matters of interest 
such as NAFTA. 
  In Mexico we were accompanied by Farid Ayales, who will be 
the labor minister during my administration, so he could talk 
with his Mexican counterpart and gain firsthand information 
about the great effort Mexico has been making based on the 
national agreement proposed by President Salinas. Based on this 
agreement, the various sectors -- business, labor, and 
government -- meet weekly to examine potential areas of conflict 
in the Mexican adjustment process. 
  We were also accompanied by Marco Vargas, who will be the 
economy minister in my cabinet, so he could learn about Mexico's 
special program to make small and midsize enterprises more 
productive. [passage omitted] 
  From Mexico we went to the United States and held several 
meetings with Vice President Al Gore; Alexander Watson, 
assistant secretary of state for inter-American Affairs; 
Assistant Secretary (Talbot); and Mr. Hamilton, a State 
Department expert on U.S. policy for Central America. 
  We spoke with them about the importance of strengthening our 
bilateral relations. Costa Rica and the United States 
historically have had excellent relations, but we think they can 
be improved in many fields [10-second break in reception]. 
  We are very interested in achieving an equal footing with 
Mexico so we can compete to attract foreign investment and so 
our products can compete on the U.S. market. We discussed this 
with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, the counterpart of 
our foreign trade minister. We can say that the United States 
views this as a possibility. We proposed this in September of 
last year during our first visit to the United States. We 
expect to see some specific action as early as July or August of 
this year, when the legislature will meet to ratify the Uruguay 
Round of GATT and may then incorporate annexes that will allow 
the Caribbean Basin Initiative countries to secure more 
benefits. Jose Rossi [foreign trade minister-designate] can 
give you more details on this. 
  We also met with officials from multilateral and bilateral 
organizations, with [words indistinct] and the vice president of 
the World Bank, Mr. (Gourky) and Mr. (Beza), who holds a post 
that is equivalent to the IMF vice presidency. We discussed 
with them what we have been saying since 1991, when we presented 
at (Corec) a proposal on the PAE [Economic Adjustment Program]. 
We talked with them about what we want: more investment in the 
social sector, especially in health and education, to supplement 
loans recently approved for health and education by the IDB. We 
also discussed the need to improve production in the country. 
  We have done much without reducing tariffs or eliminating 
tariff barriers as part of our world integration strategy, but 
we have not done all that could be done to promote production or 
to pave the way so that medium- and small-sized businessmen may 
compete in the world economy. 
  We reached the very satisfactory conclusion they fully agree 
to reanalyze and restructure the loan they had been negotiating 
with the government. [passage omitted] 
  We feel strongly about the great responsibility we have on 
the domestic side of public administration and the specific 
things we need to do in the country. We also feel Costa Rica 
should look abroad to forge strong alliances with at least three 
groups. One group, of course, is our nation's friends and those 
who lead their governments. We met with some of these people in 
each of the three countries. A second group would be the 
business sector in these countries. We met with members of the 
U.S. and Mexican business communities. 
  Costa Rica is still interested in attracting large amounts 
of 
foreign investment to our country, but it must be foreign 
investment that offers a high degree of added value, meaning we 
want investment with a significant amount of technical transfer 
attached to it, something which can make us the leaders in many 
areas of worldwide competition. We want investment that can 
allow us to have better salaries than what we have now. 
  A third alliance on the international scene, in addition to 
the political alliance with friendly governments and the 
economic alliance with the business community, should be with 
the academic world. The truth is many of these universities and 
learning centers have closely followed the process of 
development in many other countries. They have had the 
opportunity to study and propose alternatives and solutions to 
the many problems of development; they have seen what has worked 
and what has not. We believe, along these lines, it is 
important to have their experience, advice, and interest in 
Costa Rica. 
  We expressed to the three countries and the groups with whom 
we met our desire for Costa Rica to become a prototype of 
sustainable development. We explained such sustainable 
development should be founded on the following: The enormous 
lesson this country learned during the 1950's, 1960's, and 
1970's, a lesson which showed us how productive social 
investment can really be. What we invested in health and 
education then is what has allowed us to enjoy the country we 
have now. We want to continue with that investment. We need to 
be more efficient and decentralize public services, as we 
announced in our government plan. We must continue, however, 
with social spending as one of the main pillars that will 
buttress sustainable development. The second pillar should be 
the lesson we learned during the 1980's, when this country 
earned its place as a leader as of 1982.

  [Text] San Jose, 25 Apr (AFP) -- Fernando Naranjo, the 
Costa Rican foreign minister-designate, said this Monday he 
looks forward to the appointment of a U.S. ambassador to Costa 
Rica as a sign of improvement in both countries' relations, 
which have been marred by frequent diplomatic incidents during 
the past years. 
  "The absence of an ambassador (from Washington in San Jose) 
troubles us," but "we are going to work very closely (with the 
Clinton administration)" to solve the problems that have 
developed in the relations between both countries, Naranjo said 
during a news conference, which President-elect Jose Maria 
Figueres also attended. 
  Naranjo, who will take charge of the Foreign Ministry on 8 
May when the new government assumes control, admitted a number 
of conflicts "unnecessarily" cooled relations between both 
countries during the administration of Social Christian 
President Rafael Angel Calderon, which is about to conclude. 
  Washington recently threatened to block several loans to 
Costa Rica, because the Costa Rican Government has not 
compensated a group of U.S. citizens whose lands were 
expropriated, and this triggered a harsh confrontation between 
U.S. and Costa Rican authorities. 
  The United States had also previously threatened to suspend 
Costa Rica's preferential custom tariffs, because the 
influential U.S. union AFL-CIO presented charges of union 
persecution against the Costa Rican Government. 
  Naranjo said the next administration will frankly broach the 
issues that have tarnished relations with the United States and 
expect the vacant position at Washington's embassy in San Jose, 
vacant for more than a year, to be filled in the coming months. 
  The designated foreign minister accompanied Figueres on a 
tour to Mexico, the United States, and Canada last week. During 
their trip, the Costa Rican officials met with top officials of 
those governments and with the hierarchy of international 
financial organizations.

<F P=106> [Announcement by Salvadoran Supreme Electoral Tribunal, TSE, </F>
President Luis Arturo Zaldivar Romero and TSE Secretary General 
Miguel Angel Cardoza Ayala at the Hotel Presidente in San 
Salvador -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Zaldivar] The Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] 
hereby announces the results of the final vote count of the 
election for president and vice president of the Republic held 
on Sunday, 24 April. 
  We started this vote count on 26 April at 1200. Having 
worked throughout the day, and thanks to arduous work done by 
the 12 departmental tables installed and headed by this 
tribunal, through the magistrates and the executives appointed 
for this purpose -- and in the presence of departmental 
electoral boards, delegates of the contending political parties, 
the representative of the Prosecutor General's Office, and 
observers from Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] -- with 
great satisfaction we report to you that we completed this vote 
count by about midnight. 
  On 27 April, we completed administrative work to reach this 
moment when we will sign the document that the TSE secretary 
general will now read: 
  [Cardoza Ayala] Document No. 19. At the Central American 
Room of the Hotel Presidente, San Salvador, at 1700 on 27 April 
1994. 
  At a meeting to conclude the final vote count of the runoff 
election for president and vice president of the Republic held 
on 24 April, the undersigned Messrs. Magistrate-President Luis 
Arturo Zaldivar Romero; Principal Magistrates Jaime Francisco 
Romero Ventura, Eduardo Benjamin Colindres, Jose Rutilio 
Aguilera Carrera, and Pedro Ricardo Solorzano Burgos; and 
Secretary General Miguel Angel Cardoza Ayala proceeded to 
conclude the vote count after notifying the representatives of 
the Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA] and the National 
Revolutionary Movement-Democratic Convergence-Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front Alliance, who faced one another in the 
runoff election. They also notified Prosecutor General Dr. 
Arturo Romeo Melara Granillo. We started this work publicly at 
1000 on 26 April, at which time the work tables of the 14 
departmental electoral boards were installed. 
  This vote count was based on vote count certificates from 
each Voting Table Board, as well as the general municipal 
certificates. We obtained the results detailed in the following

Code. This document should be published in the official 
newspaper only once, and in the newspapers with the greatest 
nationwide circulation, in keeping with Article 266 of the 
Electoral Code.

  [Excerpt] The Armed Forces have said they will remain 
subordinate to civilian power when the new government that was 
elected on 24 April takes office. 
  Defense Minister General Humberto Corado stressed the role 
that the military has played in the country's institutional 
life, especially in the 1980's. He said the military has always 
supported past governments and now is no exception, because the 
military has always believed the country needs stability and 
calm to progress. 
  The armed institution is "subordinate, obedient, and 
nondeliberative," stressed Corado. The defense minister stated 
this yesterday morning shortly before casting his vote at the 
Central American pavilion at the International Fairground. 
  He indicated that the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation] must give up the conspiratorial, clandestine, and 
subversive methods it used in the past. "The FMLN must accept 
the democratic rules of the game and act like any other 
political party." 
  According to Gen. Corado, "The FMLN has to act according to 
the times in which it is living, make proper use of the mandate 
the people gave to its deputies in the Legislative Assembly, and 
forget the negative methods of the past." 
  He also urged the FMLN deputies to act "like real fathers of 
the fatherland and representatives of the society which placed 
its trust in them, so the balance in the Legislative Assembly 
will be beneficial." 
  Making his appeal to the losing party, he said any political 
organization that participates in elections must be ready to win 
or lose: "If it wins, it must govern and legislate, and if it 
loses, it must accept the people's will and prepare for the next 
elections." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Message to the nation by President Ramiro de Leon Carpio in </F>
Guatemala City -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] A series of events in the political arena, 
especially in matters of public security worsened by an increase 
in the violence that has adversely affected institutions and 
persons, has obstructed the development and implementation of 
the government's agenda. 
  The topic of violence is being handled with the highest of 
priorities, the first results of which are now being observed. 
We are going to continue making progress with the necessary 
strength until we are able to neutralize its effects. As for 
the institutionality of the country, it is completely 
strengthened, and, despite ill-intentioned rumors, the 
Guatemalan Army supports the democratic process and the current 
government that I head. It has given irrefutable proof of that 
support. 
  There are important topics in the socioeconomic field, 
however, that cannot be postponed. The government's agenda for 
1994-1995 clearly establishes our political strategy and our 
actions. Such policies have been determined, and it is 
advisable for us to repeat that. There will be no turns or 
deviations in its drafting and implementation. In accordance 
with these policies I am presenting to you the overall picture 
of the government's finances, which has been dramatic since I 
assumed the presidency of the Republic with a fiscal deficit of 
960 million quetzals and a debt to suppliers of 1.2 billion 
quetzals. Debts were owed to suppliers for school and hospital 
products, among other things. 
  We had planned to reduce the fiscal deficit to 360 million 
quetzals in 1994. Due to the Constitutional Court's ruling and 
the decrease in tax revenue by 160 million quetzals during the 
first quarter of the year, the deficit could increase to 1.72 
billion quetzals if administrative and legal measures are not 
adopted now. 
  Since 1993 we have been observing a weakening of the tax 
structure, which we believe will continue to weaken in 1994. We 
attribute such a situation to the weakness of the tax laws and 
to the difficulties involved in achieving its implementation. 
  In view of the budget situation, we must adopt measures, 
otherwise the fundamental duties of the state could experience 
serious adverse effects. The government could fail to comply 
with demands for investment projects in the poorest sectors of 
the country, which would worsen even more the already poor 
services provided to the majority of the population. If the 
fiscal problem is not corrected, we could lose ground in the 
stability achieved up to now because the inflation goal for 1994 
may go unfulfilled. 
  We must not forget that the most harmful tax for the people 
is inflation. Despite the improvement in the government's 
revenues in 1991 and 1992, by mid-1993 when I assumed the 
presidency of the Republic, we already saw a critical situation 
that has been worsening mainly because the reforms that were 
introduced to allow the government to effectively fight tax 
evasion were not reinforced. As a result of this lack of 
instruments for the application of the law, value-added-tax 
[VAT] evasion was nearly 40 percent. 
  That means, people of Guatemala, that, for every 100 
persons who consume something and pay the VAT, 40 stores collect 
the tax, but illegally and improperly do not report it to the 
government. Regarding income tax, evasion is close to 50 
percent. As for import taxes, they do not reflect the movement 
of merchandise owing to dishonest import practices. This is a 
problem that demands an urgent solution, and we have started 
taking the first actions. 
  We must keep in mind that the objective of lowering the 
inflation rate and strengthening public finances is not and 
should not be an end in and of itself. It is merely a necessary 
condition to reinforcing democracy and achieving social equality 
and sustained economic growth. Handling a coherent and 
consistent social policy, within which fiscal policy plays a key 
role, would foster a climate favorable to raising public 
savings, lowering the inflation rate, decreasing uncertainty, 
and making investment possible. It also fosters fewer changes 
in prices, generates jobs, and maintains the real value of wages. 
  The adoption of fiscal measures will enable the government 
to 
avoid the inflation rate's negative distributive effect. It 
will also allow it to fulfill the unpostponable task of fighting 
poverty and merging economic progress with social equality. 
There are contradictory situations, since we are simultaneously 
seeing a drop in tax revenues and predicting a significant 
growth of 5 percent in economic activity compared to the 2 
percent figure of many countries. 
  Within the framework of fiscal and monetary policy, the 
fiscal initiatives seek to achieve the following objectives: 
  1. (?Stabilize) prices, avoid an inflationary process with 
the subsequent economic and social consequences, and eliminate 
excessive indebtedness that limits the expectations of progress. 
  2. Allow greater availability of resources to spend them 
on social development and fighting poverty, considering the life 
expectancy in Guatemala is the lowest in Central America and the 
illiteracy rate is the highest. In addition, the infant 
mortality rate is one of the highest in Latin America, partly 
because the Guatemalan tax burden is the smallest in Central 
America and Latin America. Only Haiti's tax burden is smaller. 
  3. Correct some inconsistencies in the current fiscal laws 
to achieve a sustained increase in revenues that is in step with 
economic growth, allowing the strengthening of public finances. 
In that respect, we have submitted law initiatives that while 
not creating new taxes seek to improve a tax system that, 
together with measures of administrative control, avoid frequent 
changes in the tax laws and allow us to meet priority investment 
expenditures. These initiatives are complemented by specific 
actions that seek a restructuring of the administration to make 
tax-paying easier and to modernize the tax system. 
  The changes apply to income tax laws, the VAT, which 
remains at 7 percent, and the airport tax on passengers 
traveling abroad, as well as changes to the tax code. 
  The changes made to the income tax code in 1992 led to a 
reduction of personal income and corporate taxes. Its reduction 
was clearly noticeable during the first quarter of 1994 because 
a total of 41 million quetzals less than what was estimated were 
collected. These changes are aimed at partially restoring the 
revenues that were lost due to the impact of the Constitutional 
Court ruling on account payments and retentions. The changes 
are also aimed at strengthening the taxation system by avoiding 
tax evasion. 
  The collection of the VAT dropped by 85 million quetzals 
during the first quarter of 1994. Evasion takes place when 
store owners do not issue receipts or proofs of purchase. It 
is, therefore, important to adopt measures to prevent this type 
of tax evasion. Moreover, with the purpose of solving the 
problems with the VAT that have accumulated to date the treasury 
intends to increase the airport exit tax to 100 quetzals, much 
closer to Central American levels. The tax on those leaving the 
country by land remains unchanged. 
  Finally, as for the tax code, it will be strengthened with 
the purpose of getting an effective regimen for stronger 
punishments. The application of punishments will be proposed, 
and, for repeated offenders, the proper criminal court judge may 
temporarily shut down the business. The treasury must 
contribute all the elements needed by the courts to issue the 
proper punishment. In addition, the deadlines for filing 
documents are reduced. 
  All changes are difficult, but not making them would lead to 
stagnation, inflation, and state inefficiency. History has 
proven that macroeconomic disorders and instability provide no 
solutions for social problems. In the 1980's the failure to 
adopt timely measures brought about a reduction of real wages. 
By the end of the decade 75 percent of the population was poor, 
and 50 percent was extremely poor. 
  All changes are difficult, I said before, but not making 
them 
would lead us to stagnation. It is important to build an 
authentic and solid social reform on the foundations of the 
economic reforms. The fight against poverty is another face of 
economic reform. It is necessary to include social sectors that 
were never included before. It is necessary to include modern 
economic sectors to allow them to participate in productive 
activities. We must strengthen the activities of small 
enterprises that can generate jobs for thousands of citizens. 
These changes are not automatic, and they cannot appear 
spontaneously. Effort and participation by the state and 
society as a whole are necessary. A great effort to achieve 
economic stability in the country is necessary so we can lay the 
groundwork for a sustained growth that can guarantee greater 
opportunities through the allocation of more resources for 
investment in the social arena. For this to continue, it must 
not be done by incurring greater debts. We are aware of the 
challenges we are facing and the many things that remain to be 
done. The principal challenge is to strengthen the social 
aspects of development, and the spirit of the fiscal changes is 
precisely to achieve this objective. 
  The price of the imbalance is too high -- hence the urgent 
need to take measures. We are sure that we are on the right 
track. There will be no changes in the policy we have outlined. 
The situation forces us to take speedy action. The progress of 
the peace process commands our attention beyond a cessation of 
armed confrontation. It means attention to social development 
demands. We must understand clearly that there is no true 
economic prosperity without greater social justice. It is also 
true that economic growth is possible in freedom. Our 
government has pledged to the Guatemalan people to govern in a 
different style, where national interests prevails above all 
others with honesty and prioritization of expenses for social 
benefits. We trust we will be able to forge ahead despite 
problems. We have confidence in our principles and are sure of 
our policies. We do need, however, the support and positive 
spirit of all Guatemalans, because we can overcome any 
difficulties if we are united. The biggest challenge is to 
construct the country we desire for our children, a Guatemala 
that lives in peace, prosperity, and solidarity. 
  People of Guatemala: In view of the government's financial 
crisis, I have made decisions that help resolve it from an 
administrative, institutional, and fiscal viewpoint. I fully 
trust that the Congress will study and eventually approve the 
proposals that have been presented. I trust all taxpayers will 
conscientiously perform their legal duties. The government has 
pledged to invest taxes in security, health, education, etc. 
That is our duty. If taxpayers fail to pay their taxes, the 
law will be strictly enforced. 
  If, for any reason, the proposals are not passed, I would be 
forced to take other measures that would temporarily solve the 
problem but could harm all Guatemalans through inflation and the 
subsequent economic cost that the population would have to bear. 
The Congress and the people will have to say the final word. So 
will the government, regarding the part that concerns it; the 
Congress, by supporting the proposals; the taxpayers, by paying 
their taxes; and the government, by spending honestly the 
Guatemalan people's resources. Thank you for your attention. 
Good night.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 26 
April. 
  The National Statistics Institute has reported inflation 
reached 3.7 percent during the first three months of the year. 
The institute has stated goods and services in the education 
sector registered the highest increase in prices. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 1618 GMT 21 Apr 94) 
  Tourism sector representatives have reported 40 percent of 
tourism reservations have been canceled due to the U.S. State 
Department's travel advisory following violent actions against 
U.S. citizens. The losses might reach $100 million. During 
1993 560,000 tourists entered the country, and the goal for 1994 
had been 600,000, a figure that is now unlikely to be achieved. 
Tourism was the second leading source of foreign exchange for 
Guatemala during 1993. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1133 GMT 26 Apr 94)

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Carlos Roberto Reina in </F>
Tegucigalpa -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] I am appearing before you today to tell you I have 
instructed the national defense and public security minister to 
go early tomorrow morning to the National Congress and submit a 
bill amending Article 276 of Constitution, whereby a voluntary, 
educational, social, humanistic, and democratic military service 
will be established in Honduras. The aforementioned 
constitutional article reads as follows: Military service is 
obligatory for citizens 18-30 years old. A special law will 
regulate this. 
  I am certain the legislators of my fatherland will approve 
this constitutional amendment, allowing my government to begin a 
new historic phase in the fulfillment of the fundamental civic 
duty of serving and defending the fatherland. Congressional 
approval of the constitutional amendment I am introducing will 
also constitute an important landmark in relations between 
civilian society and the military institution. 
  The young men of Honduras and their parents can rest assured 
that with this amendment there will be no more forced 
recruitments, as has been done traditionally. We must all be 
aware that the elimination of obligatory military service in no 
way means the termination of an inescapable duty for all 
Hondurans -- the duty to serve and defend the fatherland. 
Honduras needs a quantitatively and qualitatively capable and 
competent Armed Forces. Our young men must regard the Armed 
Forces as an institution offering a great many opportunities for 
their overall development. 
  A voluntary, educational, social, humanistic, and democratic 
military service reconciles the fulfillment of duty with 
legitimate aspirations that encourage every young man to do his 
part for his fatherland based on his aptitude, merits, and 
capabilities. By way of this constitutional amendment we are 
requesting, our Armed Forces will represent an affirmative 
manifestation of the immortal maxim of our greatest hero: Yes, 
battles are won with volunteer soldiers. 
  My fellow countrymen: Implementing the constitutional bill 
on 
voluntary, educational, social, humanistic, and democratic 
military service is a true manifestation of the faith the 
Honduran people have in dialogue as an effective instrument to 
renew our republican institutions, strengthen the rights of 
human beings, and consolidate democracy. The constitutional 
amendment has the patriotic support of all sectors 
representative of society. I would like to present all of them 
with a testament of my recognition for their valuable 
contribution. 
  It is proper to acknowledge the cooperation provided by the 
National Congress president and first vice president, the 
commander in chief and top officers of the Honduran Armed 
Forces, the members of the cabinet, and the presidential 
advisers who joined the commission that drafted this bill, which 
basically reads: Article 276 -- Citizens 18-30 years old will 
fulfill their military service in a voluntary manner during 
peacetime, under an educational, social, humanistic, and 
democratic system. The state has the power to call citizens 
into the military ranks in accordance with the law. In the case 
of a war between nations, all Hondurans capable of defending and 
serving the fatherland are soldiers. 
  My fellow countrymen: By submitting the constitutional 
amendment bill which establishes a voluntary, educational, 
social, humanistic, and democratic military service, I am 
keeping one of the key promises of my presidential campaign. I 
said it as a candidate, and I am reiterating now as the 
constitutional president of the Republic. I am going to keep my 
promise. I am committed to doing so. I have the support of the 
government team, and, most of all, I have the support of the 
people and the protection of God. The president will not fail 
you. Thank you very much.

  [Text] Defense Minister General Reynaldo Andino Flores has 
clearly stated tonight that the Armed Forces accept President 
Carlos Roberto Reina's proposal to change the compulsory 
military service to one that is voluntary, educational, social, 
humanistic, and democratic only because the Armed Forces remain 
subordinate to the president. Nevertheless, the defense 
minister added, the Armed Forces do not agree with this change. 
  Andino Flores said that if this is being done only to 
satisfy 
the whims of specific individuals, it will be dangerous and 
problematic, and he added that people within the military pray 
to God that all will go according to plan. The defense minister 
emphatically stated his position: We are only accepting this 
because we are subordinate, but not because we agree with a 
constitutional reform geared to turn the compulsory military 
service into a military service that is temporary, educational, 
social, and all the other alterations made in this 
constitutional reform bill. 
  In last-minute, exclusive information made available to Voz 
de Honduras, we are providing you with the following statements 
by Defense Minister Reynaldo Andino Flores: 
  [Begin Andino Flores recording] Well [words indistinct] we 
have faith, hope, and trust that everything will turn out well. 
The president is a man of experience. He is a national leader. 
He is our president and the top authority in the country. He 
knows what he is doing. We hope God will enlighten him in 
everything he does and decides. We, I repeat, are an 
institution that is at the service of the nation. The president 
has been elected by a system established by our laws, and we can 
do nothing but obey him. 
  I only want to reiterate, once again, that we, the Armed 
Forces, do not believe voluntary military service is a good 
idea. We do not agree, not because we are conservative or 
reactionaries, but because we, as professional military men, 
know a bit more about military issues and believe there are more 
disadvantages than advantages in this idea. If this measure is 
going to be implemented only to satisfy personal interests and 
not national interests, we are doing the wrong thing. It is, of 
course, easier to do what we want and what interests us than to 
do what the country needs. If we are truly going to take this 
path, I cannot say how appropriate it will be to have a 
voluntary military service. 
  I repeat, I hope we are wrong and that God has enlightened 
the [words indistinct] of the president and is enlightening all 
of the Honduran people. We hope this new measure will help 
Honduras to increasingly become a better and more prosperous 
country with better chances for an auspicious future. [end

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 27 Apr (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
today downplayed possible U.S. sanctions against Argentina if 
the draft law on medicine patents is not approved. 
  Menem said that if the Bill Clinton government adopts this 
measure "then it will be just bad luck; we have done what we 
should have done. We have submitted the appropriate draft law 
to Congress and it is now there." 
  He said that "this, of course, could cause some problems for 
Argentina," although he said: "We have excellent relations with 
the United States, and the world is not only NAFTA; the world is 
also the EC and the other blocs that have been created in other 
continents." 
  He then stressed that "Argentina and Mercosur [Common Market 
of the South] are in a position to establish situations similar 
to NAFTA with those blocs that have been created elsewhere." 
  "We will continue to try and get that draft approved and, of 
course, we will lament it if they apply sanctions against 
Argentina, but the country will in no way stop functioning," he 
added.

  [Text] Washington, 26 April (AFP-NA) -- Economy Minister 
Domingo Cavallo today revealed that Washington is getting ready 
to put Argentina on the list of nations that could be subject to 
commercial sanctions. Cavallo said, however, that if the United 
States goes ahead with the threat the country will appeal at 
GATT and defeat the measure. 
  "The matter of threats with sanctions is irrelevant to us," 
Cavallo said in a news conference at the end of his meeting with 
U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor and other economic 
cabinet officials. 
  Kantor "told me that it is practically decided to 
incorporate 
Argentina on the list of countries" on a list of priorities for 
sanctions in a maximum period of 18 months. The sanctions would 
be due to commercial practices unacceptable to the United 
States, Cavallo said. 
  The minister stressed, however, that once the U.S. and 
Argentine Congresses ratify the Uruguay Round of GATT agreements 
signed in Morocco on 15 April, "no single party will be able to 
impose sanctions against another party as long as the other 
party fulfills its obligations under the chapter on TRIPS 
(intellectual rights' protection)." 
  If the United States applies sanctions, "we will ask (GATT) 
to appoint an investigation commission and we will win the 
case," the minister insisted. 
  The conflict revolves around Argentina's lack of respect for 
U.S. pharmaceutical rights. 
  Cavallo said a draft bill on patents protection similar to 
the bill approved by Mexico in 1991, which was widely approved 
by the international community, currently is being discussed by 
the Argentine Congress. 
  He stressed, however, that "Argentina's decision to grant 
patent protection to pharmaceutical products will not be adopted 
under pressure or according to the list on which we are 
included," but "to make sure that Argentina will be a country 
where research for new pharmaceutical products and strong 
investments are possible." 
  Cavallo told Kantor that the threats, "instead of helping 
the 
approval of a patents law in Argentina, will create more 
resistance." 
  The minister also met President Bill Clinton's assistant for 
economic policy, Robert Rubin; Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown; 
and Laura Tyson, Council of Economic Advisers chairman. 
  The minister said he "found a very good climate for 
everything" in the four meetings he held with these officials 
today. Earlier he had participated in IMF and World Bank 
meetings. 
  "I am very satisfied," Cavallo stressed. 
  The minister said that during his meetings with the U.S. 
officials he proposed that the December hemispheric summit in 
Miami "issue a communique declaring the American continent a 
zone free of agriculture subsidies." 
  Argentina would consider it "very encouraging if the 
presidents of the hemisphere agree not to permit the entry of 
subsidized agricultural products into the continent (...) and 
that our countries will not subsidize the sale of their 
agricultural products to other countries in the continent." 
  The four U.S. officials told him that the initiative was 
"worth analyzing and studying." 
  The Argentine minister said his country was not taking any 
steps to be placed on the list of countries eligible to join 
NAFTA that is being prepared by the United States. Cavallo 
added, however, that he would be "surprised" if Argentina and 
Chile were not the first two nations in the list. 
  The list of countries liable to suffering sanctions as well 
as the list of countries eligible to join NAFTA are "too 
unilateral for our liking," Cavallo said. "This thing about 
lists is a U.S. problem," Cavallo added.

  [Text] Geneva, 26 Apr (EFE) -- Argentine Ambassador to 
Geneva Juan Sanchez Arnaud has said that the Uruguay Round of 
GATT talks is the most important trade agreement ever signed. 
Sanchez said the agreement opens a new stage in the history of 
international economic relations and consolidates 
multilateralism. 
  The ambassador talked at the UN Conference on Trade and 
Development, UNCTAD. He said the agreement "permitted us to 
progress in the process of reducing tariff obstacles in the 
industrial field, allowed us to improve the situation of 
agriculture and services, and facilitated the introduction of 
trade measures on investments at the multilateral level." 
  The ambassador stressed the importance of adopting and 
improving the codes approved during the Tokyo Round of talks, 
which has consolidated a broad variety of norms directed at 
regulating aspects of international trade, providing clarity, 
and eliminating discretionary powers and unilateral decisions in 
imposing trade obstacles or applying sanctions. 
  Another important decision was the creation of the World 
Trade Organization (WTO), which will work on the liberalization 
process and will broaden the multilateral discipline. At the 
same time, the new mechanism to resolve conflicts will 
consolidate the legal bases of the complex system of norms, and 
will address problems and conflicts between trade and the 
environment. 
  Sanchez Arnaud said that not all of the results of the 
Uruguay Round were up to expectations. The ambassador added 
that perhaps the greatest shortcoming was the lack of 
correlation between the contribution of developing countries to 
the process of trade liberalization and the new opportunities 
they will have through the proposals of the industrialized 
countries. 
  The ambassador said that the second shortcoming was the 
limited scope of the agreement on agriculture. "My country and 
all other members of the `Cairns Group' of agricultural 
producers, which do not subsidize their production, wanted to 
have an agriculture agreement worked out to raise the area to 
the same level of conditions approved for the industrial area, 
particularly through internal and export subsidies and the 
reduction of import obstacles," the ambassador said. 
  "The results are far from our aspirations, although we must 
stress that what has been achieved is the first step toward 
changing protectionist agricultural policies which, in the first 
place, affect developing countries, and secondly affect the 
consumers in countries encouraging such protectionist policies," 
Sanchez said. 
  The lack of concrete results favoring less developed 
countries "is a shortcoming that concerns us all, because the 
solution to the grave problems affecting developing countries 
lies in an improvement in trade and the introduction of 
structural changes to increase production and improve 
infrastructure conditions."

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 25 Apr (NA) -- Defense Minister 
Oscar Camilion tonight denied rumors regarding his resignation. 
He also denied that he would comment on the murder of conscript 
Omar Carrasco, arguing that "clairvoyance is not my business, I 
manage a ministry." 
  During the Adad &amp; Longobardi television program, the 
minister 
compared today's rumors regarding his resignation with "last 
week's reports which assured that President (Carlos) Menem had 
undergone an operation." 
  Camilion stressed that the rumors regarding his resignation 
"are far from true," adding that "maybe they are being floated 
by some internal faction" unknown to him. [passage omitted] 
  Answering a question on a possible deterioration of the 
image 
of the Armed Forces and civilian disobedience against compulsory 
military service, Camilion said: "If something like that 
happens, it would be due to a compounding of many involved 
factors." 
  "If a deterioration of the Armed Forces image is encouraged, 
then those who encourage it are active participants or, of 
course, it would not be spontaneous," he emphasized. 
  The minister compared this topic "to political factors and 
campaigns," like what happened "during the recent march in 
Neuquen Province, when the slogans were clearly political."

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 26 Apr (NA) -- It was officially 
reported today that an "extremely dangerous ultra-right 
extremist," who had been working in the Army until last year as 
a civilian intelligence official, has been detained by Buenos 
Aires police agents on an island in Tigre District. About 30 kg 
of explosives, antitank rockets, 24 grenades, and arms of 
various calibers and ammunition were also seized. 
  Police and court sources have indicated that the detainee, 
officially identified as Alejandro Jorge Socksdorf, 35, is a 
member of a "Painted Faces" group whose members had allegedly 
been training "to rescue" former Colonel Mohamed Ali Seineldin, 
sentenced to life imprisonment for heading a military uprising 
on 3 December 1990. 
  The operation in which Socksdorf was detained was ordered by 
San Isidro Federal Judge Roberto Marquevich. Buenos Aires 
Islands Security Corps police participated in the raids on an 
island near the Antequeda Creek, 400 meters from the Parana de 
Las Palmas river confluence. 
  Inspector Juan Carlos Rebollo, the Buenos Aires Islands 
Security Corps chief, said the detainee "is an extremely 
dangerous person." Rebollo emphasized that the area where the 
raids were carried out is reportedly "a training camp for 
ultra-right extremists" because "a large number of spent 
cartridges" were found in the area. 
  Rebollo explained: "In addition to the arms seized, we also 
found targets and other items that lead us to believe that 
people were trained there. A heliport was found at the far end 
of the island." 
  Based on this, Rebollo emphasized that the 15-hectare island 
might be "a training center," specially for former "Painted 
Faces" military officers. 
  He indicated that extreme-right literature was also seized, 
reinforcing the possibility that the detainee is part of an 
extreme right group. [passage omitted] 
  The police seized 24 MK2 grenades, an unspecified quantity 
of 
9-mm pistols, at least 10 "Energan" antitank rockets which are 
launched by FAL rifles, a large quantity of 7.62 and 12.70 
caliber ammunition, and a "homemade firing stand" [preceding 
word in English] for mobile targets. 
  Inspector Rebollo added that 10 rifle-launched rockets, one 
FMK 2 grenade, three electric detonators, and 100 grams of 
dynamite were also seized. 
  Buenos Aires Security Secretary Alberto Piotti noted that 46 
pounds of TNT -- in 1-pound pieces -- rapid and safety fuses, 
detonators, a 12.70 caliber shotgun [as received], an 
unspecified quantity of dynamite, and a Browning pistol with 
erased license numbers were also seized. [passage omitted] 
  In a brief communique signed by Colonel Eduardo Alfonso, the 
Army Press Office chief, the Army General Staff indicated that 
Socksdorf was a "civilian employee" in the Army until 1993 when 
he was "fired" for undisclosed reasons. 
  Army sources reported that Socksdorf, who was a PCI 
[Civilian 
Intelligence Personnel] grade employee, participated in the 
operations to recover the 3d Infantry Regiment of La Tablada 
that was surrounded on 23 January 1989 by a group of For the 
Fatherland Movement (MTP) militants. 
  Inspector Rebollo noted that when the raid began, Socksdorf 
introduced himself as "an IN-11 grade Army member and many other 
things which the judge (Marquevich) will have to determine if 
they are true." 
  Police sources contacted by NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS stated that 
the detainee "has significant military training" and so the 
possibility that "he is a trainer of other members of the cell" 
has not been ruled out. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- Science and Technology Minister 
Israel Vargas announced yesterday in Rio de Janeiro that he will 
travel to China with President Itamar Franco on 17 or 18 May to 
make the last arrangements for a joint project by the two 
countries to build a remote control satellite for monitoring the 
earth's geological and weather conditions and soil, and for 
mapping purposes. The satellite, that will cost $150 million, 
should be finished in 1996. Brazil will finance one-third of the 
project. Vargas asserted: "If this project materializes, 
France will be our only competitor in this field." 
  Israel Vargas also said that this project is to be added to 
another for the construction of the first satellite made 
entirely in Brazil, which is being developed at the National 
Space Research Institute (Inpe) in Sao Paulo. According to 
Vargas, the Brazilian-made telecommunications satellite will 
cost between $30 and $40 million, and will be finished within 
the next four years. 
  The science minister also announced that in two months' time 
the largest factory for integrated circuits in the southern 
hemisphere will be dedicated in Campinas, Sao Paulo. He 
explained that a pilot plant is being set up at the Informatics 
Technology Center [Centro de Tecnologia de Informatica, CTI] and 
will cost $18 million. Vargas said: "This is a revolutionary 
project that will allow many scientists to participate in 
computer, electronics, and other projects."

  [Text] Brasilia -- Brazil will participate in the 
reconstruction of Vietnam, especially in connection with 
infrastructure projects and the exploitation of oil in the Sea 
of China. The IMF and the World Bank will lend the Vietnamese 
Government more than $10 billion to rebuild the country, and 
Brazil wants a share of the market that will be created with 
these funds. A Brazilian business mission -- the first in the 
history of relations between the two nations -- already has 
spent two days in Vietnam. On 23 April, the mission will travel 
to Malaysia, one of the most developed Southeast Asian nations. 
  Vietnamese Vice Foreign Minister Le Mai visited Brazil in 
October 1993 and conveyed Vietnam's interest in improving 
commercial relations with Brazil. In 1993 Brazil had a trade 
deficit with Vietnam: It exported goods worth $4.2 million and 
imported Vietnamese products worth $30.3 million (mostly rice 
and chemical products).

  The Brazilian Foreign Ministry Promotion Department has 
pinpointed several business opportunities for Brazilian firms in 
Vietnam. Oil looks like the most promising field. Vietnam has 
large unexploited oil and natural gas deposits in the Sea of 
China. Brazil also is interested in infrastructure projects such 
as highways, hydroelectric power plants, basic sanitation 
projects, civil construction, and low-income housing. 
  Even before the U.S. commercial embargo on Vietnam collapsed 
two months ago, several U.S. companies had set up shop in 
Vietnam. "Vietnam is a cat that will become a tiger," according 
to a Brazilian Foreign Ministry official. Vietnam, which has a 
population of 60 million and a per-capita income of barely $200 
per year, has established an economic system along the lines of 
the "Asian Tigers," and has been receiving investments from 
Japan, the United States, and European countries, mainly Germany.

  [Text] Manaus -- As of 23 April, the Colombian Army has 
been deporting Brazilian gold miners who are mining illegally in 
Colombia. According to the Amazonia Military Command (CMA), 
during the past few days 300 Brazilian gold miners have been 
repatriated through the town of Tabatinga (AM) [Amazonas State], 
some 1,500 km from Manaus, on the border with Leticia, Colombia. 
  The CMA reported that it is supporting the Brazilians, 
lodging them at the 8th Jungle Infantry battalion in Tabatinga. 
A FAB [Brazilian Air Force] plane was sent there to bring the 
gold miners to Manaus. Federal Police also are participating in 
the operation. 
  According to the CMA, 84 gold miners already have been 
transported to Manaus in a FAP Buffalo plane. A Colombian Air 
Force plane today will transport another group of 90 Brazilians 
to Leticia. There have been no reports of any discord between 
the Colombian military and the gold miners. 
  The Brazilian Army also has carried out operations with the 
Venezuelan National Guard to repatriate Brazilian gold miners. 
According to Itamaraty, within the next few days the two armies 
will repatriate 136 gold miners from the Roriama 
State-Venezuelan border.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Debt Concerns"] </F>
  [Text] The soaring growth of Brazil's public debt is a 
source of concern. This time, however, the long-standing 
distortions and shortcomings of public administration are not 
the main cause of this growth. FOLHA DE SAO PAULO established 
on 21 April that skyrocketing interest rates have pushed the 
federal debt contracted outside the Central Bank from $43.7 
billion in December 1993 to $50.6 billion in March 1994. 
  High interest rates hold demand in check, but are a heavy 
burden for the government. The high profit margin of federal 
bonds encourages the inflow of foreign capital, but converting 
dollars to cruzeiros for investments in the financial market 
also makes the domestic debt grow. 
  Ever since the Collor Plan failed and the Collor 
administration started using high interest rates as the main 
tool to counter inflation, there has been an underlying risk 
that the growth of public debt could cause instability. 
  Brazil's monetary policy is once again tied to a delicate 
balance. While on one hand soaring inflation is pushing 
interest rates up to sustain consumption and prevent hoarding, 
the payment of interest rates is increasing the debt and is 
fueling inflationary expectations. 
  After staying high in 1991 and 1992, interest rates fell 
significantly in 1993: Real interest rates stood at only 7 
percent per year. This decline curbed the rate of expansion of 
the debt and allowed the country to start growing again. 
Meanwhile, inflation surpassed 35 percent in December 1993. 
  Interest rates again started going up in recent months, 
rekindling the concern over the size of public debt. A very 
short-term debt -- mostly in bonds that mature in one month -- 
growing at an excessively high speed could seriously complicate 
the medium-term stabilization process.

  [Excerpt] Sao Paulo -- The rule to convert prices into 
URV's [Real Value Unit] is not being taken into account in 
negotiations between industrialists and supermarkets. According 
to Firmino Rodrigues Alves, vice president of the Association of 
Sao Paulo Supermarket (Apas), since 18 April, 80 percent of the 
products already are being billed in URV's with prices between 8 
and 12 percent higher than the last quarter of 1993. 
Provisional Measure No. 457, however, is quite clear: The 
conversion must be based on the average price of that period. 
  In March the supermarkets suspended purchases from the 
industrial sector in URV's. Since then they have been getting 
their supplies from the wholesale market or from the industries 
that continue to sell in real cruzeiros. The supermarkets 
started running out of this alternative two weeks ago when the 
wholesale market's stocks started running low. 
  Alves stated: "Now they [wholesale dealers] also will have 
to negotiate with the industrial sector." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The government will probably re-edit the provisional 
measure on the URV [Real Value Unit]. The Congress plenary 
gathered this morning to vote on the measure. The session, 
however, was suspended after an agreement with government 
leaders in Congress. 
  The congressional session began with the presence of 113 
members of Congress, which is enough of a quorum to initiate the 
session but not enough to vote on the provisional measure that 
creates the URV. The congressional rural bloc, which has 200 
members, was obstructing the session [through their absence]. 
They will only approve the provisional measure if the government 
accepts an amendment guaranteeing the correction of the minimum 
prices for agricultural products through the URV. 
  Since not enough members of Congress turned up for the 
session, the Congress director board and government leader in 
the Chamber of Deputies, Deputy Luiz Carlos Santos, decided to 
suspend the session. It is now thought that the government will 
tomorrow re-edit the provisional measure that creates the URV. 
  [Begin Santos recording] It would be irresponsible to 
attempt 
to have the provisional measure voted on without the certainty 
of holding a majority of votes in favor of its approval. 
Therefore, lacking the certainty of having the provisional 
measure approved, the government now must probably re-edit the 
measure. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Jayme Brener and Helio Contreiras] </F>
  [Text] Under the rules of an old sea dog, a captain goes 
down with his ship. What the rules do not state, but which is 
taken for granted, is that before sacrificing himself he should 
do everything possible to save the ship. By the same logic, 
generals should try to prevent their tanks and troops from 
getting stuck in the mud. This was the reason behind the attempt 
by Imbel, the Army War Material Industry, to use whatever means 
were necessary to save Engesa [Specialized Engineers, Inc.] -- 
which has built 90 percent of the Army tanks and armored 
vehicles -- after it requested a meeting with its creditors in 
1990 and went broke in October 1993. Imbel played the role of 
government trustee in Engesa until the latter went broke. A 
memorable moment in this episode was when entrepreneur Daniel 
Birman, of the Arbi group, was asked to invest no less than $7.2 
million, without any guarantee, in Engequimica [expansion 
unknown], a subsidiary of Engesa. The money was transferred on 
20 March 1992. Part of it -- some $2.6 million -- was used to 
soften up Elizier Trindade, the supervisor of Engesa's call for 
a meeting with its creditors. Everything seems to indicate that 
the operation sought to delay the bankruptcy, thus facilitating 
the enterprise's survival and possible sale. Trindade's 
preventive detention was ordered on charges of passive 
corruption, but he fled. 
  But why did a big entrepreneur like Birman cough up so much 
money without guarantees and without knowing what it was to be 
used for? "We want to buy Engequimica someday, and the $7.2. 
million was an advance on the increase of capital, which will be 
accounted for during the first shareholders' meeting," Arbi 
group director Haroldo Zago said. One of the enterprises of the 
group, the Brazilian Ammunition Company (CBC), produces 
gunpowder. Control over Engequimica would have given Birman an 
outstanding position on the market, at a good price. ISTOE 
learned that Birman also expected to conclude an agreement for 
buying part of Imbel's ammunition factory in Piquete. The Arbi 
group would thus have almost a monopoly on the gunpowder and 
ammunition production in Brazil. How could one deny a request 
from Imbel, which is Birman's partner in CBC and in the DF 
Vasconcellos enterprise, and a privileged consumer of its 
products? With this idea in mind, Birman provided the money 
through Spem, which is one of his enterprises. A few days 
later, the $7.2 million left Engequimica, which had not asked 
for a creditors meeting, and went to Engesa, which was its 
creditor. One third of that money went to Elizier Trindade on 
the day he arranged a new postponement of the bankruptcy. 
Trindade divided the money: some for his brother-in-law Jose 
Carlos da Silva, and some for increasing his Bradesco [Brazilian 
Discount Bank] account. The largest part of the money went to 
an account in Codelsur [expansion unknown] -- a Uruguayan 
financial agency -- through the Rio de Janeiro Cash Bank, 
apparently without telling Brazilian fiscal authorities. The 
courts suspect the money that Imbel sought from Birman is 
comfortably lodged in an account of Trindade in the Uruguayan 
fiscal paradise. Anything was considered justifiable to save 
Engesa. Daniel Birman refrained from making any claim, even 
though no shareholders meeting was held after the money was 
deposited. Birman, who lost both the money and Engequimica, 
spoke after the enterprise went bankrupt last year and is now 
trying to be recognized as one of its creditors. 
  If Imbel asked Birman for multi-million dollar help, who was 
responsible for softening up the supervisor of Engesa's call for 
a meeting with its creditors? Engesa's owners Jose Luiz and 
Jose Guilherme Whitaker, who have exported weapons worth $2.6 
billion to 28 countries, swear that Imbel's intervention in 
their enterprise has put them out of the competitive market. 
The checks that went to Trindade bear the signature of Engesa 
attorney Marco Aurelio Montenegro and Imbel attorney Jose Carlos 
da Silva, who have already been charged with having received 
stolen goods and their properties have been embargoed. The 
checks were also "agreed to" by Colonel Lucio Pereira, the then 
vice president of Imbel, who is responsible for Engesa's 
intervention. Questioned by ISTOE reporters, Pereira declined 
to comment "to avoid hindering the investigations." Attorney 
Heloisa Maluff, of the first chamber of Barueri (Sao Paulo), 
said: "We have already asked for the lifting of the bank secrecy 
on the accounts of more than 30 people, among them several 
military men, to help conclude the investigation." This chamber 
is adjudicating Engesa's bankruptcy. 
  The Imbel-Birman-Engequimica-Elizier Trindade case is just 
another affair in the nebulous relationship between Engesa and 
the Brazilian Army. This relationship was so close that in 1982 
it led President Joao Baptista Figueiredo to nominate Jose Luiz 
Whitaker -- the head of Engesa -- for president of the state-run 
company Imbel. "Engesa benefited from that," retired General 
Arnaldo Calderari has said. Calderari, a former Imbel 
president, resigned in protest over Whitaker's nomination. "Yet 
instead of growing -- because it used Imbel's market -- Engesa 
plunged into a crisis," Calderari concluded. The crisis was the 
factor that made the relationship between the Army and Engesa 
even more unusual. 
  Imbel was willing to nationalize Engesa in 1989 to 
guarantee its armored vehicle supplies and to avoid losing the 
important know-how that had been developed. Carlos Tinoco, the 
then Army Minister, vetoed the operation during [former 
President] Fernando Collor's administration. Pedro Paulo Leoni 
Ramos, known as PP, who at that time was strategic affairs 
secretary, made a new proposal with the support of the Army War 
Materiel Department (DMB). Imbel would intervene Engesa and 
would pay its debts -- which totaled hundreds of millions of 
dollars -- paving the way for privatization. [as published]. 
  The intervention occurred in 1990. Considering it was not 
even a state enterprise, the team that was created around PP and 
General Armando Paiva Chaves, the then DMB chief, sought to 
arrange the sale without an auction. The first step was to 
reschedule the debts. Thanks to Colonel Lucio Pereira's efforts, 
almost all the creditors -- the biggest creditors were the Banco 
do Brasil and the BNDES [National Bank for Economic and Social 
Development] -- agreed to modify the established payment 
deadlines. Other creditors, like Jose Bizerra Lins, the owner 
of the Pecunia travel agency in Sao Paulo, agreed to collect 
only 10 percent of the debt and to negotiate the rest later. 
Engesa owed $60,000 to Bezerra Lins for the purchase -- a few 
days before the creditors were called to their meeting -- of 
several first-class tickets from Malaysia to Brazil. The tickets 
were a present to a group of Malaysian generals interested in 
Engesa's armored vehicles. 
  The Baureri court believes the creditors who agreed to this 
"arrangement" within the creditors' meeting will not receive a 
single extra cent because the Bankruptcy Law states that 
creditors cannot partially relinquish their rights over amounts 
that are owed to them. This means a loss for the Banco do 
Brasil and for the BNDES, which in turn means a loss for 
consumers. It is a big loss because the two banks accounted for 
almost 80 percent of Engesa's debt, which is today estimated at 
more than $500 million. To keep Engesa afloat, the state 
advanced $100 million as an advance payment on the purchase of 
more than 1,000 armored vehicles, which have not yet left the 
drawing board: Yet another loss. 
  After rescheduling the debt it was decided to orient the 
privatization toward creating a joint venture [preceding two 
words in English] with a big multinational company of the 
military sector, a powerful Brazilian private group, and Imbel, 
which would thus preserve its interests and the technology of 
the Urutu, Cascavel, and Jararaca vehicles. The path chosen was 
via the recently created SAO -- South American Ordnance -- which 
comprises Imbel, the Royal Ordnance (a subsidiary of British 
Aerospace, one of the world's military giants), and, with 2 
percent of the shares, Daniel Birman's Arbi group. The initial 
objective of SAO was to produce ammunition but the Engesa deal 
seemed excellent because there would be no competition for the 
purchase, and the British enterprise might manufacture in Latin 
America, among other things, its famous Rover jeeps. 
  Gen. Paiva Chaves, retired, has said: "Our only objective 
was 
to save a strategic enterprise, of major significance for the 
Armed Forces, and to recuperate the Brazilian image abroad." 
Imbel president Paiva Chaves has always enthusiastically 
advocated cooperation with Royal Ordnance. He added: "We were 
not interested in private groups, no matter whom." A High 
Command officer has said: "For the British, it will be a fine 
deal. They can use Imbel for minor work, while opening new 
doors through Imbel contacts with the Army." Considering that 
business does not feed on good intentions, the transfer of 
Engesa collided with a large green barrier; not of military men 
but of dollar bills. The British enterprise demands sound 
Brazilian entrepreneurial engagement and a guarantee that the 
government will support the new weapons manufacturer. This is 
difficult at a time of tight budgets. 
  The SAO alternative became permanently stuck following 
President Collor's resignation and the change in command at 
Planalto Palace. Daniel Birman left the South America Company 
and was replaced by the Schahyn Cury group, now with 33 percent 
of the shares. Gen. Paiva Chaves dreamily said: "The 
participation of such a large national company would have awoken 
Royal Ordnance's interest and ensure its participation in 
Engesa. This is still possible." But reality shows that 
business became almost impossible. There are still executives 
in London who dream of setting foot -- or a tank track -- on a 
tropical shore. In view of its financial problems, however, 
Royal Ordnance had to sell the Rover Company to the German BMW 
group. This group was involved in a mega-corruption scandal 
when it sold materiel to the Malaysian Government. 
  What can be done to save Engesa and the Brazilian Army 
armored vehicle industry? When the SAO option began to fail, 
Imbel also began to tumble. The first maneuver, which was 
reported by ISTOE in 1993, involved the curious expropriation of 
project facilities and the Sao Jose dos Campos plant, Engesa's 
most valuable asset. This expropriation has yet to be signed by 
President Itamar Franco. It also called for the auctioning of 
the remaining facilities in Barueri and Salvador to pay the 
labor debt that currently totals $50 million (Engesa failed to 
deposit its employees' Severance Payment in 1987). The maneuver 
got stuck because the courts informed Imbel that, if the 
expropriation really occurred, an audit would be ordered and the 
corresponding indemnification would be demanded. The Army, 
however, does not have money to pay an indemnification. 
  The second "all ends are justifiable" maneuver involved the 
alleged sale of Engesa to entrepreneur Wilson "Cito" Mendes 
Caldeira, which was also to have taken place last year. Mendes 
Caldeira agreed to assume the debts as long as they did not 
surpass $350 million. He contracted auditing services, spent 
$500,000, and then realized he was about to do something 
foolish. At the time, it was rumored there never had been a 
Mendes Caldeira option: it had only been a trick to delay 
bankruptcy. The company went broke in October 1993. Engesa, 
the most important symbol of the national materiel industry, 
went bankrupt because no one, not even Mendes Caldeira, 
deposited the paltry $250,000 the company owed the National 
Credit Bank. 
  All possible Imbel maneuvers to save Engesa seem to be have 
been exhausted. A study by the Armed Forces High Command 
concluded that the best alternative is to privatize the materiel 
industry. What large group, however, is interested in Engesa? 
The armored vehicles project -- except that of the Ogum and 
Osorio, which are the company's main hope -- belong to the 
government. The courts are thoroughly checking on assets in 
store and two years may pass before a definitive auction can be 
held. Meanwhile, the Urutu and Cascavel tanks of the Brazilian 
Army and of two other dozen countries are rusting away. A 
colonel stationed at the central Army barracks in Brasilia said: 
"Unless a solution to the Engesa problem can be immediately 
found, Gen. Paiva Chaves will be in a very uncomfortable 
situation." The irony of the problem, however, is that if the 
courts establish that the creditors who have signed agreements 
with Imbel will not receive a single penny, not even a single 
screw, Engesa will reach auction day without debts. It is also 
true, however, that it will reach auction day without its vital 
sap, which has been consumed by years of looting and rusting. 
And that is the dismal end of the "all ends are justifiable" 
operation.

  [Text] The Uralaz-Chile enterprise -- 70 percent of its 
capital is Russian and 30 percent Chilean -- has become the only 
company in the continent authorized to sell MI-17 helicopters, 
made in Russia by the Kazan company. 
  The famous model, which has been produced in various 
versions 
since 1962 and is used by the thousands throughout the world, 
will carry out a series of demonstrations throughout the country 
before touring other Latin American countries, according to 
Uralaz general manager Anatole Guben Uliantzeff. 
  Uralaz-Chile has purchased an MI-17, the largest helicopter 
operating in Chile, with which it hopes to make many deals. 
  Guben said: "We set up our enterprise one year ago with 30 
percent Chilean capital. Despite the fact that we specialize in 
Russian military technology, we started off importing bulldozers 
and trucks such as the `Ural' truck, which due to its size can 
be used, among other purposes, to carry surveillance radars." 
  The businessman commented that so far they have been very 
successful and hope to be even more so with the MI-17 because it 
will meet needs that no other helicopter now used in Chile does. 
  He noted that one of the MI-17's advantages is its price, 
which is no more than $3 million, while a similar helicopter in 
the Western Hemisphere costs more than $12 million. 
  Regarding its safety measures, Gubin said it fulfills all 
international safety measures and the company currently is 
applying for a permit to fly it in Chile. "For the time being 
we have a temporary permit."

  [Text] Chile has established its position on the UN 
Population and Development Conference to be held in September. 
Pope John Paul II has already criticized this conference. 
  Sernam [National Women's Secretariat] Director Josefina 
Bilbao explained Chile's position on this conference which will 
be held in Cairo. 
  She explained that, during the conference, Chile will 
express 
its opposition to abortion, an issue that will be discussed and 
which has been harshly criticized by Pope John Paul II. But the 
Chilean position differs from that of the Vatican in that it 
upholds that there is more than one type of family. 
  Bilbao said that the National Family Council believes this 
concept also encompasses common-law marriages and single-parent 
families. She added that Chile supports birth control, which 
has been practiced in our country for the past 30 years.

  [Text] Santiago, 26 Apr (EFE) -- Brigadier Major Jorge 
Hernan Gimenez, coordinator of the Argentine Air Force chief of 
staff, today asserted that the fact that Chile has acquired 
Mirage aircraft and Argentina Skyhawk aircraft will not cause a 
military imbalance between the two countries. 
  The high-ranking Argentine Air Force representative said 
these purchases "do not represent an imbalance between the two 
countries' air forces." 
  Brigadier Gimenez arrived in Santiago on 25 April to attend 
a 
series of meeting with the Chilean Air Force general staff and 
to visit the National Aeronautical Enterprise (Enaer). 
  Gimenez told journalists that "we want to tighten our 
friendship ties," and explained that the two nations' air forces 
are carrying out joint projects and assessing several 
cooperation projects for the future. 
  He also said the individuals responsible for the theft of 
plans for the advanced training aircraft IA-63 "Pampa" from the 
Argentine Aerospace Equipment Manufacturing Company (FAMA) have 
not been identified yet. 
  He denied that this theft might harm the plan to market this 
aircraft, which Argentina hopes to sell to the United States. 
  The high-ranking Argentine official explained that the U.S. 
A-4 Skyhawk fighter bombers will arrive in Argentina in the next 
few months. 
  Gimenez reiterated that both Argentina and Chile maintain a 
cordial relationship and are constantly exchanging information, 
and dismissed any type of unrest over the acquisition of combat 
aircraft by both countries.

  [Excerpt] Minister Secretary General of the Presidency 
Genaro Arriagada on 16 April said it would be unfortunate for 
the country if a climate of inflexibility and confrontation was 
to prevail, and admitted that the government is facing its 
greatest difficulties in the political field. 
  In assessing the executive branch's performance a little 
more 
than a month after President Eduardo Frei assumed the 
presidency, Arriagada said: "Either there is a spirit of 
constructive and loyal relationship between the government and 
opposition or a climate of inflexibility and confrontation will 
prevail in the country." 
  The government has thus intervened for the first time in the 
controversy between the Coalition of Parties for Democracy and 
the opposition regarding the right's role. The government 
parties accuse the right of abandoning the policy of agreement 
due to the imposition of the UDI's [Independent Democratic 
Union] rigid viewpoints within this sector, which are not in 
harmony with the National Renewal Party members who uphold a 
more moderate stance. 
  On 16 April, as he assessed the first 35 days of Frei's 
government, Arriagada said the government has shown great 
initiative and is leading the country toward a constructive 
debate that takes the country's true problems into account. He 
said: "We might have some style problems but that is only 
natural for such a complex task and for a team that has just 
been sworn in." 
  He commented that three days ago the government quietly 
defined "an interesting privatization proposal that is pragmatic 
and not ideological. The upcoming sale of 12 percent of Edelnor 
[Northern Electricity Company] strictly complies with our 
electric power policy that believes that competition and 
separating generating activities from the transmission 
activities is the best policy. The state's participation in LAN 
[Chilean Airline] has become unnecessary, as well as limiting 
the private sector's participation to 35 percent of the capital 
of Empremar [State Maritime Enterprise], which was justified in 
the past. The same goes for Transcontainer." 
  Arriagada also stated that the measures announced on 15 
April 
by the finance minister are also in keeping with a state that 
promotes a greater opening of the exchange markets, the 
strengthening of the export sectors, and the opening of capital 
accounts. 
  Arriagada also upheld the executive branch's attitude 
regarding [Carabinero Director General Rodolfo] Stange's case, 
asserting that it was the only solution compatible with the 
principle of probity and justice the government firmly upholds. 
  In this regard he said that the "right focuses its 
criticisms 
on irrelevant matters, but every day fewer Chileans believe that 
the chief of police of a responsible state can be both guarantor 
of the citizenry's safety and involved in a court case. The 
issue was handled with respect for Stange and the Carabineros, 
and the government exercised restraining leadership on its 
political supporters, thus preventing the conflict from turning 
into an escalation of scandalous accusations and even the 
untimely discussion of constitutional matters that, although 
related -- such as the fact that the government does not have 
the authority to remove the [Carabineros] director general, 
could have caused uncertainty." 
  In Arriagada's opinion, "the fact that the so-called `Stange 
crisis' by no means affected the unprecedented working and 
cooperative climate with the Armed Forces speaks well of the 
government." 
  As for the constitutional reforms, "a matter that has 
existed 
since the first day of the transition," Arriagada asserted: 
"The government has made a positive proposal, rejecting the 
idea of sponsoring reforms that involve a partial viewpoint, and 
has chosen to invite the political parties to discuss them from 
a nationwide viewpoint such as deciding what sort of municipal 
system modernization is the best, what sort of modernization of 
Congress do Chileans aspire to." 
  In this regard, Arriagada said, the government has asked the 
political parties to untangle a debate that was gradually 
reduced to "inflexible" and "weak" attitudes and mentioned that 
discussions regarding the electoral system's reform started on 
15 April. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Santiago, 26 Apr (EFE) -- The affiliation of the 
United Labor Federation (CUT) to the International Conference of 
Free Trade Union Organizations (ICFTUO), which was decided on 23 
April by a CUT special congress and rejected by the Communists, 
has created a serious internal conflict. 
  The crisis has emerged at a time when the CUT is negotiating 
with the government a 15 percent basic salary readjustment that 
would raise that salary to 52,000 pesos ($103 approximately), 
and could lead to a union division. 
  CUT Vice President Antonio Martinez, a Socialist, reiterated 
today his accusations against the Communist union leaders, whom 
he accused of promoting an internal crisis. 
  Martinez said that the Communists can leave the CUT if they 
don't feel loyalty and respect for the organization, which is 
the only central federation in the country with a membership of 
500,000 workers -- that is, 10 percent of the work force. 
  The Communist leaders, who represent about 90,000 militants, 
rejected in the special congress the incorporation of the CUT 
into the ICFTUO, which is of social democratic trend. 
  Meanwhile, the environment for celebrating labor day on 1 
May 
appears cloudy, and union leaders are not discarding the 
possibility of disturbances occurring during the main ceremony, 
which is held every year but this time will not be attended by 
President Eduardo Frei.

  [Text] The Socialist Party (PS) and the Independent 
Democratic Union (UDI) yesterday announced their proposals on 
the subject of corruption in public service and on the 
maintenance of administrative probity. 
  The PS presented its criteria on the subject and described 
the proposed Code of Conduct that the party intends to apply to 
all of its members who are employed in public service during the 
current administration. 
  The document states that the PS will apply maximum sanctions 
to all public officials who are PS members and who become 
involved in any kind of corruption. 
  The UDI, meanwhile, through Deputy Juan Antonio Coloma, 
proposed several specific measures to deal with the problem, 
among which he mentioned exhaustive background investigations of 
persons who are appointed to public service, and a change in the 
regulations on the creation of investigative commissions in the 
Chamber. 
  The proposed Code of Conduct for Social officials was 
described by the secretary general of the PS, Gonzalo Martner, 
who said that the party would make its observance obligatory for 
all public servants who are party members, after the document is 
submitted for the approval of the next General Council on 16 and 
17 April. 
  The document states that in the event of any evidence of 
corruption on the part of any member of the PS in the 
performance of his public duties, the PS Directorate will send 
all the evidence to the Supreme Tribunal of the party, with the 
express request to apply the maximum sanctions provided by the 
statutes. 
  In addition, the proposal establishes the obligation on the 
part of all PS members in public office to respect rigorously 
the Basic Law of Administration of the State, which requires 
them to execute their orders faithfully and to observe the 
principle of administrative probity, with preeminence of the 
public interest over private. 
  It also states that the Socialists must orient their 
activities toward the satisfaction of civic demands and respect 
for the user as the foundation of public service. 
  Gonzalo Martner said that it was the aim of the PS to 
conclude a series of legislative debates in the ordinary session 
of Congress next 18 September, that had already been presented 
on that subject by ex-Senator Laura Soto (PPD [Party for 
Democracy]) and Congresswoman Olga Feliu, in addition to the 
initiative for a model law on official probity presented last 
week by the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Jorge 
Schaulsohn. 
  PS Vice President Ricardo Solari said that honesty and the 
fight against corruption are indispensable components in 
modernizing the state. 
  The PS leader said that his party will promote a series of 
initiatives aimed at preventing corruption. He mentioned among 
them legislation that would punish influence peddling, as this 
is not considered punishable under current legislation. 
  He added that his party wants to begin a discussion on the 
subject of granting the opposition the faculty to constitute 
investigative commissions because, at present, the decision to 
create a body of that type can only be taken by a majority of 
deputies. 
  Nevertheless, the Socialist leader said that at the same 
time 
ways must be sought to prevent that function from being used for 
calumny or for gratuitous attacks on individuals or officials. 
  Ricardo Solari also spoke of the need for legislation to 
make 
a clear distinction between the exercise of public functions and 
the administration of private business. 
  The PS vice president said that, in his opinion, the 
financing of political and electoral activities should have an 
important public contribution component. 
  He said that donations to political campaigns should be 
characterized by transparency, assigning them a spending ceiling 
and providing equal access to political financing for all 
participants. 
  He believed that a public component in financing political 
activities would be a way of preventing corruption. 
  Solari said that the salaries of senior and middle grade 
government officials should be compatible with current 
conditions in a modern Chile. 
  He stressed the importance of improving salary levels, 
because otherwise the state administration could be faced with a 
flight of talent to the private sector. 
  UDI Deputy Juan Antonio Coloma called for a change in the 
regulations that establish that a Special Investigative 
Commission of the Chamber can be formed only by agreement of a 
majority of deputies. 
  He called for the requirement to be lowered to a third of 
the 
votes, and that members of the commission be designated by 
lottery and not by the political parties. 
  He said that it would be appropriate for the presidency of 
each such commission to go to the congressman making the 
accusation. 
  With regard to administrative probity and corruption, the 
congressman advanced a series of proposals on behalf of his 
party designed to deal with the problem. 
  Coloma appealed to the country's leaders to make government 
appointments based on candidates' qualifications and abilities, 
and not on their political affiliations. 
  In the opposition congressman's opinion, many recent 
appointments have been made according to political quotas, 
although the new government had said publicly that it would do 
the opposite. 
  The congressman spoke of the importance of fighting against 
the state bureaucracy, as he believes it represents a source of 
corruption. 
  Coloma called for greater transparency on the part of 
members 
of Congress, so that all votes on legislation be public and by 
roll call vote, thus preventing congressmen from promising one 
thing and doing another when it comes to voting. 
  In addition to calling for specific solutions to the 
problem, 
Coloma said that a year ago the government was denying that 
corruption existed and was accusing the opposition of using the 
issue for electoral purposes. He said that President Frei 
recognizes that there is a real danger of corruption. 
  Coloma also dismissed statements by DC [Christian Democratic 
Party] Senator Jose Ruiz de Giorgio, who said on Friday that the 
opposition had refused last year to create an ethics commission 
in the Senate. 
  Coloma said that the senator's words were a serious blunder 
that confused public opinion and were an attempt to hide serious 
weaknesses inside Concertation. 
  The principal leaders of the Democratic Party of the Left 
(PDI) emphasized the need yesterday, at the Ministry of 
Interior, to coordinate initiatives to prevent and combat 
corruption. 
  The President of the PDI, Deputy Fanny Pollarolo, together 
with party leaders Antonio Leal and Pablo Mecklenburg, met at La 
Moneda with Minister German Correa to offer their support for 
the new responsibilities that he has just assumed. 
  The PDI representatives took advantage of the occasion to 
exchange views with the secretary of state on corruption, a 
subject of great concern to the political community. 
  "We reaffirm our decision to work very hard on this matter, 
to put an end to a problem that exists in our country, and to 
which we cannot close our eyes," declared Congresswoman 
Pollarolo. 
  The political leaders discussed with the minister the 
advisability of coordinating the various anticorruption measures 
proposed by all sectors of the country. 
  Included among the proposals are the appointment of an 
"ombudsman," who would gather accusations of corruption and the 
strengthening of the investigative powers of the Comptroller's 
Office. 
  Fanny Pollarolo called for the creation of a governmental 
body that would collect and systematize all of the initiatives 
in this area. 
  In any case, she announced, she has been considering this 
matter and is preparing to form a ministerial coordination 
working group on the problem of corruption.

  [Text] The president and the vice president of the Chamber 
of Deputies, Jorge Schausohn (PPD [Party for Democracy]) and 
Alberto Ospina (RN [expansion not available]), respectively, 
were in agreement in stating that the new government, in its 
first phase, should give priority to social issues in order to 
reduce poverty in the country. 
  The deputies expressed the conviction, separately, that the 
time has come to begin to resolve social problems, leaving 
political issues for a later phase. 
  Schaulsohn said that it is time to launch important programs 
in the social area and to insist on a substantial reform of the 
Isapres [Institute of Public Health and Preventive Medicine] 
Law. He also supported the need for a basic study of the social 
security system. 
  However, he said that while the Pension Fund Administration 
system has many advantages, it has the great defect that it will 
not provide decent pensions to persons of low and medium 
incomes, who represent the majority of the population. 
  He advocated correcting the system, and proposed that the 
Chamber of Deputies designate a special commission to make 
proposals to restructure, correct, and improve Chile's social 
security system, which should be among the top priorities of the 
government that, since last Saturday, is headed by President 
Frei. 
  Meanwhile, referring to reforms of existing institutions, 
Deputy Alberto Espina said that the opposition is prepared to 
approve those constitutional reforms that restore Congress's 
investigative powers and facilitate the passage of proposed laws 
through Congress. 
  But the opposition is not disposed to approve those 
constitutional reforms, supported by Concertation, aimed at 
ending the permanency of the commanders in chief, and other 
reforms proposed by the outgoing government, which were included 
in the program of Eduardo Frei's administration. 
  Espina thought it would be advisable, with the presidential 
and congressional elections over, to study the binomial 
electoral system in order to perfect it, but not to do away with 
it. 
  Asked about the position expressed by Interior Minister 
German Correa in favor of preparing a draft bill which would 
permit the direct election of mayors, he said that it showed 
there was absolute agreement between opposition and government. 
  He said that the right is in favor of ending the system of 
indirect election of mayors, as long as there is no repetition 
of the phenomenon that councilmen with 6 percent of the votes 
end up running the municipalities, without any kind of 
representativity. He repeated that the opposition supports the 
passage of that kind of law, emphasizing that "the government 
will be able to count on our strongest support for a law of that 
kind." 
  In supporting this initiative, his colleague Schaulsohn said 
that it is important that all officeholders be elected by direct 
vote, especially mayors, because they have a great 
responsibility and because it would prevent maneuvers by 
political parties, such as what occurred "with the famous 
mayors' protocol," that allowed the placement of persons as 
mayors who had not the slightest popular support. 
  Alberto Espina said that the right is prepared to maintain 
close and strict checks on the government, as is appropriate to 
a good opposition. But he was also certain, he remarked, that 
President Frei would be very rigorous, as he had promised, in 
assuring that officials did not abuse their power and that there 
would be no symptoms of corruption. 
  The opposition leader said that, in the social sphere, he is 
convinced that if there is good will on the part of the 
government and the opposition, decisive steps can be taken to 
achieve the social goals that have been laid down. 
  In Espina's opinion, the government of Eduardo Frei has a 
great opportunity to take advantage of the country's current 
situation to carry out social programs, especially as there are 
no elections on the horizon. Therefore, he believed it crucial 
that an immediate start be made to resolve problems in health 
and education, and in confronting the problem of poverty. 
  Otherwise, he said, the recently begun administration will 
waste a great opportunity for the country. "I am convinced--he 
repeated--that if there is good will on the part of the 
government and the opposition, decisive steps can be taken to 
achieve the social goals that have been set." 
  Asked whether that meant the opposition is prepared to 
approve more financing to fight poverty, he replied that the 
opposition has always been prepared to give the government all 
of the facilities really needed to fight poverty, not with words 
or demagoguery, recalling that the leadership of the RN said 
that it desired the greatest success for the government "because 
the government's success is Chile's success." 
  The vice president of the Chamber of Deputies said yesterday 
that the binomial electoral system must be carefully studied, in 
order to reveal its strengths and its defects, for the purpose 
of correcting and perfecting it, but not of changing it for the 
corrected proportional system.

<F P=106> [Interview with Joaquin Jose Vallarino, president of the </F>
Presidential Commission for Panama Canal Affairs, by reporter 
Lucy Molinar from the Palace of the Herons in Panama City; from 
the "Telemetro Reports" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Molinar] Mr. Vallarino, we would like to ask you 
how this commission will guarantee the country that this work, 
which has taken you two years to complete, can be implemented 
and that we will be ready when the time comes for us to take 
over the Panama Canal? 
  [Vallarino] I think the best guarantee is what has been done 
and what is written. It has been written in very clear and 
specific words. Each recommended step is defined and explained. 
  [Molinar] Let us talk about specifics so that we can better 
inform the people. Will a ministry or an autonomous institution 
be responsible for implementing the plan? 
  [Vallarino] The plan is to be implemented in three stages. A 
transition commission will handle the first stage. We are 
recommending to the president that this commission be appointed 
by decree and that it be formed by the most capable Panamanians 
he can find, despite the individual's persuasion. We are 
recommending the members be professionals from various fields so 
that all the areas, engineering, legal, environment, will be 
overseen. 
  [Molinar] Does this plan ensure the stability of Panama 
Canal 
workers? 
  [Vallarino] I believe this is one of the most important 
things of which we must assure the Panamanian people. Those who 
work for the canal will continue to enjoy the same working 
conditions and benefits and will abide by the same rules and 
regulations they follow today. 
  [Molinar] Let us talk about rules and regulations. Will they 
be allowed to stop canal operations at any time? 
  [Vallarino] One of the nicest things that happened while we 
were discussing that aspect was that union representatives went 
to the Legislative Assembly and told us they agree canal 
operations should never stop; therefore, we are willing to give 
them the right to strike, and we can also tell the world we know 
Panama Canal operations will never be stopped due to a strike. 
  [Molinar] Who will handle canal revenues and where will this 
money go? 
  [Vallarino] That is also properly explained. Even though 
canal administration authorities will have all the autonomy they 
need, they are also asked to have direct ties with the 
government and the legislative branch, via special 
representatives. Financially, they will be totally independent. 
  [Molinar] Where will the profits go? 
  [Vallarino] These will first be set aside for improvements. 
What is left over will go to the treasury. We are looking for a 
way for the canal to produce, for the nation, at least the same 
economic benefits we receive today. 
  [Molinar] Will it be possible to implement this plan despite 
the political ups and downs? Can we overcome our political 
differences and not appoint another commission, and so forth? 
  [Vallarino] If we all believe in democracy, the way I 
believe 
in democracy, the people's voice will give the orders. If the 
people remain united in defense of democracy and remain united 
in the message we received -- that they do not want politics to 
meddle in canal administration -- then all the presidents will 
have to respect those principles.

    [Editorial Report] Panama City Television Networks in 
Spanish at 0100 GMT on 26 April broadcast a live debate by four 
Panamanian presidential candidates -- Ernesto Perez Balladares 
of the Revolutionary Democratic party (PRD); Ruben Blades of the 
Papa Egoro Movement; Ruben Dario Carles of the Change '94 
coalition; and Eduardo Vallarino of the Christian Democratic 
Party (PDC) -- from the TVN television studios in Panama City. 
The debate, which is moderated by Rodrigo Eisenmann, president 
of the Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies (ILDEA), 
includes panelists Rosa Maria Britton, Octavio del Moral, and 
Roberto Reichard, who pose questions to the four candidates. 
The debate is sponsored by ILDEA and the Media Presidential 
Debate Committee. 
  The debate gets under way with Britton asking Perez 
Balladares if the development of science and technology is 
necessary for the nation's modernization, indicating that Panama 
and Haiti are the only Latin American nations that do not have a 
state council devoted to science and technology. Britton asks: 
"What policy would your government adopt for the development of 
science and technology in our country?" 
  Perez Balladares replies: "We have proposed increased 
integration between the private sector and the national 
education system." 
  Britton then asks whether Perez Balladares has taken into 
consideration the creation of a technology ministry, such as in 
Costa Rica. To this Perez Balladares replies that this would be 
a bit overly ambitious, and, instead, he would opt for a science 
and technological institute closely linked to the private 
sector, because a ministry would tend to get bogged down in 
bureaucracy. 
  Commenting on this same topic, Vallarino says he does not 
agree with the formation of a science and technology institute; 
rather scientific and technological development should be 
centered within the universities. 
  Carles comments that there are already too many 
institutions, 
and therefore this issue must be analyzed and reviewed. 
  Blades says, "Until the nation defines where it is headed, 
it 
will not be possible to integrate any technological knowledge." 
He adds: "The nation must first define its course, its 
development, and those areas that will require technicians." 
  Next, Reichard poses a question to Vallarino. Taking into 
account Panama's limitations, Reichard asks what areas should be 
stressed to improve the nation's living conditions in the next 
five years. Vallarino replies, "Considerable improvement can 
only be achieved by raising Panamanians' income, and, in order 
to do this, job opportunities must be increased." He continues 
by pointing out that official statistics indicate that 
Panamanians' real income has not risen within the past 20 years. 
  Commenting on the same subject, Carles says that if the 
resources used for education, health, transportation, electrical 
power, water, communications, public security, and social 
security were managed more efficiently, they would improve the 
standard of living. 
  Blades, meanwhile, says: "We must create an opportunity for 
investments to come and remain in Panama, and these investments 
should not be concentrated in the Province of Panama." 
  Vallarino also comments on this issue: "Social services are 
very important for Panamanians with low income." To raise the 
standard of living, we must provide much better public services. 
  Perez Balladares makes a final comment on this issue: "I 
share the view that in order to enjoy a good standard of living, 
one must have a good job." Therefore, he adds, we have taken 
into account means of generating more jobs. He also says income 
must be redistributed through state-run investments. However, 
he notes, none of this is can happen if the nation fails to 
raise its cultural level. 
  Octavio del Moral asks Carles to outline specific solutions 
in his program to ease the dreadful conditions of the prison 
system. Carles responds that the citizens who have been 
sentenced to jail must pay for their crimes; however, the state 
should provide the means for inmates to serve their sentences in 
a decent manner. Historically, Carles says, the Panamanian state 
has been negligent in creating institutions that serve as 
rehabilitation and education centers. 
  In further commenting on the poor state of the country's 
prisons, Carles says the state has failed to provide adequate 
conditions and training for inmates, despite having built a new 
prison. He says his administration intends to review the prison 
system and to relocate prison installations to more adequate 
places, as well as to try to improve the conditions under which 
the inmates are currently living. 
  In responding on the same issue, Blades says that in 1973 he 
visited the Coiba penal colony and was able to ascertain 
conditions on the island. According to Blades, one of the 
things that has never existed in Panama is the inclination to 
confront the problem once and for all. He also notes there has 
never been any interest in clarifying whether the system is 
designed to punish or to rehabilitate. Blades adds, "Not only 
has the situation not changed, but it has deteriorated." 
According to Blades, the problem not only lies in the prisons, 
but also in a judicial system that has proved to be ineffective. 
  Perez Balladares says there are three problems with the 
prison system which must be attacked: 1) insufficient 
facilities, 2) preventing crimes through programs aimed at 
educating, and 3) training programs aimed at rehabilitating 
criminals for the day they will reenter society. He adds that 
prisons currently serve "more to train inmates for further 
criminal activities than as deterrent." According to Perez 
Balladares, one solution to this could be the creation of 
halfway houses to train inmates on how to reenter society. 
  Vallarino says he believes conditions in Panama's prisons 
are 
beyond words, adding that there have been instances when 
society's attitude against inmates are sometimes more heinous 
that those of the inmates against society. 
  In response to a question on efforts to encourage education 
in Panama, Blades says one of the first things that must be done 
is to increase funds earmarked for education -- funds which 
today are "outrageously inadequate." 
  Perez Balladares, meanwhile, says that if the nation invests 
in cultural issues, it will be able to garner more productivity 
from its human investment. 
  According to Vallarino, if the nation expects to promote 
education, it must focus on the problem from within the family, 
because this is where any individual's first experiences 
originate. 
  One of the main problems that currently prevents promoting 
education, according to Carles, lies in the numerous state 
institutions that interfere with one another. There is no 
coordination between these institutions, which, in turn, has 
merely created an unwanted bureaucracy. 
  Panelist Roberto Reichard asks how each candidate would 
confront the problem of limited resources and how to distribute 
these resources equitably among an ever-increasing population. 
  Perez Balladares says his administration plans to create an 
urban planning agency to provide basic services to each 
community in an ordered manner to prevent the demographic chaos 
that could take place at the end of the century. With respect 
to disorderly population growth, Perez Balladares says he does 
not advocate population control campaigns, but instead he 
supports programs by institutions such as the Family Planning 
Association. 
  In discussing the population issue, the other three 
candidates agree that the fundamental problem lies in inadequate 
information at all levels of society. On the other hand, Blades 
believes the situation is further complicated by irresponsible 
fatherhood plus the lack of respect toward women, both of which 
are cultural problems. 
  Candidate Vallarino is asked whether he plans to amend the 
Labor Code, and, if so, how. Vallarino replies that the Labor 
Code is "certainly one of the factors inhibiting investment in 
Panama." Noting that the Labor Code is obsolete, he adds: 
"Panama's labor leaders know this perfectly well. I would not 
amend the Labor Code. I would make the unions, in a joint 
effort with the private sector, amend the Labor Code." Based on 
his experience as president of the Labor Foundation, he says it 
is possible to "reach an understanding without any side having 
to renounce its interests." He adds: "Negotiation and a 
consensus are possible, even easy, if goodwill and understanding 
between the sides exist." Commenting on Vallarino's answer, 
Carles notes that, while promoting assembly plant activity in 
the country, he has learned "it is easy to find a consensus 
between workers and businessmen, and the state should not 
meddle, play politics, or discriminate in favor of one party or 
the other." He adds that some laws are hampering the 
development of new business activities. 
  On the same subject, Blades points to the Stability, 
Competitiveness, and Employment Pact established in Mexico, 
which seeks to generate more jobs "without worsening working 
conditions." He adds: "I believe we can reach such a point 
through a concerted effort. I believe we must not worsen 
Panamanian working conditions." Blades says new formulas must 
be presented in order that both business and labor understand 
"they are a part of Panamanian society, and that a consensus 
must be reached without allowing class-related, ideological, or 
economic interests to prevail." 
  In the opinion of Perez Balladares, the key word on this 
topic is "competitiveness," and to achieve this, "we must have a 
Labor Code that allows us to compete with other countries vying 
with us for investments." He adds, "We must also have efficient 
private enterprise, because we cannot pin the blame on the 
workers." He also says, "We must have a state that promotes a 
consensus and which is, in turn, efficient in providing 
necessary services." 
  Panelist Britton broaches the topic of the country's health 
care system, and he asks Carles how he would improve the 
country's health services. Carles answers that the state 
earmarks a significant amount of money to this sector, "but we 
must improve its level of efficiency by having more doctors 
placed in charge of administration." He adds that public 
services are not just inefficient because of a lack of funds, 
but also because of mismanagement. 
  Blades notes that health care is of utmost concern. He feels 
the system must not be politicized and resources should be 
better allocated. Perez Balladares, in turn, notes that all 
major health indicators have dropped in the country, and he says 
the lack of adequate drinking water is one of the reasons for 
this. Vallarino says that in this campaign he has had the 
opportunity to visit many hospitals. He believes that 
decentralizing health services would enable each community to 
have a greater say in improving services. 
  Reichard asks Blades what specific actions he would take to 
stop illegal mass immigration. The Papa Egoro candidate begins 
by saying a law has to be enacted to define the functions of the 
police, including the border police. He adds that the 
government is one of the "chief culprits" in allowing the 
smuggling of illegal aliens into the country. 
  Reichard then asks Blades to specify what measures can be 
taken to prevent this. In Blades' opinion, "the corruption 
generated by this sort of activity" has to be combated. He 
argues that for many poorly paid public employees, this activity 
constitutes "almost a survival mechanism." In addition, the 
opportunity for smuggling illegal aliens exists because "crime 
generally goes unpunished in the country." He adds, "We have to 
punish those who break the law," and this will immediately send 
a signal from the highest level of government to the lowest. 
  Speaking on this same topic, Perez Balladares say some 
ethnic 
groups are exploited by being asked to pay huge sums for visas 
in order to emigrate from their native countries. He says he 
would take steps to keep these people from being exploited by 
their own compatriots who are in Panama or by immigration 
officials. He agrees that police working in border areas need 
to be professionalized. 
  Vallarino says the Immigration Law needs a complete 
overhaul, 
"because Panamanians have not yet decided who we want to come to 
Panama." Carles agrees on the need to revise the Immigration 
Law, because this is a problem of corruption "that begins in the 
consulates, the Public Registry Office, and the Immigration 
Office." 
  Perez Balladares stresses the need to introduce legislative 
reforms that will permit expediting judicial cases. He says 
such cases can be accelerated with the support of the lawyers. 
  Panelist Octavio del Moral notes that Perez Balladares has 
suggested the next attorney general be selected from a list to 
be supplied by the Bar Association and the Law School, but notes 
adds that in the last bar election, 91 percent of its members 
abstained from voting. This, therefore, would be undemocratic. 
Perez Balladares says he does not agree with this argument, 
because the lawyers are being consulted, and if they do not want 
to participate, then that is their prerogative. 
  Vallarino claims that the fundamental problem in the 
administration of justice has been the selection of those 
individuals who impart justice, recalling the cases of the last 
two attorney generals. 
  Carles notes that the quality of personnel both in the 
Attorney General's Office and in the judicial system "must be 
improved." He says he would not rely on the Bar Association and 
unions, because that is where the worst manipulators have 
existed for years. He suggests seeking a variety of options to 
end impunity, deficiencies, and the slow administration of 
justice. 
  Blades notes that the main problem in this area has been the 
nonexistence of budgets needed for an expeditious handling of 
justice. 
  At this point, Britton asks about the Panama Canal, which 
requires constant maintenance. She says this cannot be achieved 
if it is administered with the bureaucracy that has prevailed in 
the government. 
  Vallarino responds: "The Canal needs autonomy, but real 
autonomy. The National Assembly is already studying 
constitutional reforms that are directed toward that goal. I 
and 100 other Panamanians helped prepare those regulations. Our 
primary concern was to keep the Canal administration from 
suffering from the vices that occur regularly in the Panamanian 
Government and -- I do not want to exclude it -- in the U.S. 
Government. We are not unique in this. So autonomy is 
definitely a part of the constitutional reform." 
  To the same question, Carles states: "The Canal will 
efficiently perform its task; that is, transiting ships. Our 
problems lie in the decisionmaking process. Important decisions 
have to be made at the administrative level. The Americans have 
trained thousands of Panamanians for many years. In that 
respect, the Canal will operate correctly. Let's not have any 
doubt about that. We need to prepare ourselves for the 
decisionmaking process. We need to have the appropriate means 
to make policy decisions on wages, purchases, investments, 
tolls, and employment." 
  Blades responds: "I would like to say two things. First, 
the Canal situation should be viewed in terms of the law and the 
personnel. What worked for 79 years should continue to work the 
same way with the same efficiency. In other words, things must 
be done intelligently with the same efficiency and by remaining 
consistent with our laws, the laws that allowed the Canal to 
operate efficiently for 79 years, even if they are U.S. laws. 
We must make them consistent with our laws. 
  "Second, the labor situation in the Canal Zone should not 
deteriorate. The same circumstances that have made employees 
happy and led to uninterrupted success -- that is, the 
successful operation of the Panama Canal for 79 years -- should 
be maintained." 
  Regarding the Canal, Perez Balladares responds: "There is a 
Panamanian saying that sums it up quite well. If it isn't 
broken, don't fix it. I think the Panama Canal has been working 
perfectly well for many years. We have to make our laws, 
Panamanian laws, consistent with the system and assimilate the 
practices, personnel policies, wage administration policies, the 
merit system, everything that has made the Canal function well. 
Then there must be a total decentralization." 
  Perez Balladares adds: "We hope that on 31 December 1999, 
the only ones who will know that there has been a change of 
administration will be the Panamanians. The rest of the world 
will see the Canal functioning normally." 
  Vallarino adds, "We have the talent to administer the Canal, 
perhaps better than it is being administered now." 
  Reichard asks Carles that, if he is elected president, when 
he ends his term in August 1999, what kind of nation will he 
bequeath to future generations in the year 2000. 
  Carles responds: "The 8 May elections will be the most 
important in the country's history, because we must create the 
institutions that will permit the smooth transition from the 
present to the future. For instance, if elected, one of the 
first things I must do is consolidate the monetary system to 
ensure financial and economic stability." 
  Noting that Panamanians have greater capabilities than many 
people give them credit for, Carles begins answering a question 
on whether or not he can, within five years, instill a feeling 
of hope among the Panamanians. He explains: "This is not a poor 
country. We just have to manage our resources better. As 
comptroller I learned how to manage things. As comptroller, I 
corrected the pattern of waste in public funds evidenced in the 
videotape" released on national television by President 
Guillermo Endara. Carles notes that what is required is "a 
balanced budget, fiscal stability, and disciplined public 
finances." 
  Ruben Blades, responding to the same question, says it is 
indeed possible to instill hope in the people within five years. 
Perez Balladares says his commitment is to the future and to a 
united Panama. Vallarino says unity is necessary for the sake 
of the country's future. 
  Carles takes the floor again and notes that it is fine to 
think about the future, but he warns the past cannot be 
forgotten. "I wish," he states, "we could engage in a real 
debate and speak about what the PRD represents for the country's 
future, especially considering that notions and practices 
involving statism and interventionism continue to prevail." 
  Panelist Octavio del Moral then asks the candidates whether 
the Panamanian Constitution has become a shackle inhibiting the 
establishment of true democracy in the country. 
  Ruben Blades says he favors a Constituent Assembly, but he 
does not favor simply putting "patches" on the Constitution. 
  Perez Balladares responds to the same question in this way: 
"Of course the Constitution has to be changed, modified, and 
made adequate for reaching national objectives. Perhaps this 
will contribute to securing the reconciliation we so much 
desire." 
  Vallarino says he favorably views a Constituent Assembly, 
but 
he warns this process could impose a six-month delay on Panama's 
economic and social development. "Such a delay is critical for 
those who do not have a job and have to resolve basic needs." 
He adds, "In my opinion, this project is of secondary 
importance, considering the many social needs of the Panamanian 
people today." 
  Carles affirms that the current Constitution "is the result 
of the aberrant and arrogant presence of a military caste and 
its political expression -- namely, the PRD. This must come to 
an end." Carles adds that, if elected, on 9 May he will create 
"a commission that will present proposals on how to reform the 
Constitution or how to prepare the way for a Constituent 
Assembly." 
  Ruben Blades then makes his final statement in which he says 
that he would not hold a Constituent Assembly right away because 
there are other priorities, but he adds that it is important to 
hold one. 
  Moderator Rodrigo Eisenmann closes the debate by thanking 
the 
candidates, the panelists, and the television viewers.

<F P=106> [From the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The case of Dandenys Munoz Mosquera, a.k.a. La 
Quica, could take an abrupt turn in the United States. Only a 
few days before the trial against him begins in New York, 
Colombia obtained an important statement directly implicating La 
Quica in the case of the Avianca aircraft, contrary to what El 
Arete [Carlos Alzate Urquijo] had stated in a report that caused 
a scandal a few days ago. The Prosecutor General's office has 
the statement and is expected to turn it over to the United 
States within the next few hours. This is an exclusive report. 
  By a strange boomerang effect, the letter from Prosecutor de 
Greiff to the U.S. judge who is examining La Quica's 
participation in the attack on the Avianca aircraft prompted a 
very credible informant to confess all he knew about the 
sinister attack. According to the confession, given to an 
appointed prosecutor, the informant, whose identity is being 
maintained in strict secrecy, confessed that the Avianca 
aircraft explosion was carried out directly by Dandenys Munoz 
a.k.a. La Quica, with the participation of other accomplices. In 
other words, La Quica was the one who staged the attack. 
  Even more surprising, the informant confirmed that La Quica 
had staged the attack as ordered by Carlos Mario Alzate Urquijo, 
a.k.a. El Arete, who was the one that stated before Prosecutor 
de Greiff that La Quica had nothing to do with the sinister 
incident. In other words, El Arete blatently lied to Prosecutor 
de Greiff regarding La Quica. The informant, who contradicted 
the statement by El Arete, and who has puzzled the 
investigators, has a great deal of credibility with the judicial 
and security organizations because he alerted the authorities 
about an attack on the U.S. Embassy and about other planned 
attacks, even against Prosecutor de Greiff.

  [Text] Chilean Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia and 
Colombian Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos stated that 
the agreements reached during the GATT Uruguay Round represent a 
significant step toward the consolidation of the multilateral 
open trade system. 
  In a joint declaration issued in Cartagena de Indias, 
Colombia, they asserted that the implementation of the free 
trade agreement between Canada, the United States, and Mexico 
opens the possibility of a tighter relationship between the 
North, Central, and South American and Caribbean countries. 
  They also noted that the regional integration programs' 
achievements of the past four years give a new dynamic to the 
processes that link the economies of our region. A similar 
dynamic has generated a series of bilateral agreements between 
the Latin American countries, among which is that signed by the 
governments of Chile and Colombia in late 1993. 
  The declaration later states that the Chilean and Colombian 
Governments have expressed their resolute political will to make 
every possible effort to use this opportunity to materialize the 
desire for Latin American integration and that it spread to the 
rest of the hemisphere. 
  In the Chilean and Colombian economy ministers' opinion, 
free 
access to the markets will promote competition and, hence, the 
efficient development of their respective economies. 
  Finally, the two ministers urged the ECLA [Economic 
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean] to decidedly 
support the integration efforts with its technical and 
analytical expertise.

  [Text] The controversy between the government and 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff continues. Justice 
Minister Andres Gonzalez also rejected the prosecutor general's 
actions today. The government's discontent over statements by 
Gustavo de Greiff, who has accused several state officials of 
being subservient, continues. After President Cesar Gaviria's 
statement demanding respect from the prosecutor general, de 
Greiff seemed to have turned his back on the controversy today. 
Meanwhile, his position still generates controversy. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] No Colombian is subservient. We 
are independent and honorable people, and the first to be so is 
our president. [end recording] 
  The issue of the study of drugs legalization, which the 
prosecutor general has defended on several occasions, is not 
viewed favorably by the government. The gap between the 
government and the prosecutor seems to widen. 
  [Begin Gabriel de Vega, National Drug Directorate director, 
recording] Legalization would increase consumption due to the 
availability. It is definitely an option the Colombian 
Government is not considering. [end recording] 
  It has been learned a meeting of rapprochement between the 
president and the prosecutor general, with government officials 
and judicial branch representatives present, might be held 
within the next few hours to iron out any differences.

<F P=106> [Report by Jairo Gomez from the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] There was an unexpected meeting between President 
Cesar Gaviria and Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff at Narino 
Palace this afternoon. This newscast has learned they shared a 
peace pipe and the president and prosecutor resolved their 
differences, which have been aired by the national media. 
Despite their differences, they sat down to discuss the 
possibility that 2,000- 7,000 prisoners might go free because 
their legal situation has yet to be resolved. The president and 
the prosecutor will meet again next week when there will be a 
meeting among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.

  [Text] Attention: Radioactive material apparently was 
stolen from a Buenaventura warehouse, and it could have 
endangered the lives of many Valle Department inhabitants. 
Touching the material or simply being close to it entails a 
serious risk. Doctors at Valle University Hospital warn that 
those who have handled this radioactive material known as 
strontium 90 are in danger of contracting skin cancer, gangrene, 
or nerve cells damage. 
  Cali Police have arrested several people who attempted to 
sell the material to the hospital, but it is believed that more 
people could have been exposed to the strontium 90.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 26 April. 
  The latest 600 billion peso cut in government spending 
proves 
the inflation issue has pushed Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes to 
a point of desperation. A few days ago, he made a most shocking 
announcement: loans will be restricted. Moreover, Hommes plans 
to ask the agriculture minister to halt food imports, and he 
insists that inflation this year will be 19 percent -- despite 
evidence to the contrary -- because it is currently nearly 10 
percent and unemployment is up to 10.3 percent. Furthermore, 
the planning sector, which had estimated economic growth at 5 
percent this year, now estimates that it will be no more than 3 
percent. Meanwhile, despite the implementation of preventive 
measures, dollars continue to flow freely into the country. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 
1730 GMT 20 Apr 94) 
  The Colombian Government's restriction on loans has the 
country's financial institutions calling for help. They say the 
restrictions primarily hurt the construction sector and savings 
and housing corporations. National Association of Financial 
Institutions says many approved loans cannot be paid out because 
of the measure, adding that if it is maintained the financial 
institutions will be virtually paralyzed by June. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota Inravision Television Canal A Network in Spanish 0000 on 
22 Apr 94) 
  The National Administrative Department of Statistics 
recently 
published its report on unemployment for March 1994. In the 
country's seven largest cities, unemployment increased from 9.6 
percent in March 1993 to 10.3 percent in March 1994. During 
that same period, jobs increased by only 1.2 percent, down from 
3.6 percent from the previous year. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL 
TIEMPO in Spanish 17 Apr 94 p 9C) 
  The Colombian Government and the Federation of Coffee 
Growers 
have approved the total refinancing of coffee growers' debts 
that expire in 1994 and 1995. The beneficiaries of this 
decision must make a 25 percent downpayment and will have 10 
years and a three-year grace period to pay off their debt. The 
refinancing, which eases tension between the coffee growers and 
government, will be covered by 180 billion pesos set aside for 
this purpose. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Canal A 
Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 22 Apr 94)

  [Text] If Colombia continues to base its exports on the 
advantages afforded it by inexpensive labor and a strategic 
geographic location and on the tariff breaks that other 
countries are giving it, then soon our products will no longer 
be sold on major world markets. 
  The fact is that the natural competitive advantages that 
sustained the country's basic exports for years no longer 
suffice. Therefore, Colombia needs to create a competitive 
environment that will keep its external sector alive into the 
next century. 
  In view of the above, the government must urgently establish 
a series of tax breaks for export firms, promote investment in 
companies that sell on foreign markets, boost domestic savings, 
and invest seven-figure amounts in training national human 
resources. Sizable amounts must be appropriated on a priority 
basis to improve domestic infrastructure (ports, air terminals, 
roadways, and communications). 
  This is a summary of the conclusions reached by the study 
that the Monitor company conducted on competitiveness in 
Colombia. 
  The research project, which went on for more than a year, 
was 
directed by Michael Porter, one of the most prestigious 
economists in the United States. The final document, entitled 
"Creating Colombia's Comparative Advantage: Patterns of 
Competitiveness and Sectorial Analysis," focused on specific 
sectors of the economy such as capital goods, fruit juices, 
flowers, graphic arts, leather goods, and textiles. The 
conclusions were presented yesterday at the forum entitled 
"competitiveness: the new name of the game." 
  The study offered the following general recommendations for 
the aforementioned sectors: 

  -  Give tax breaks in the form of accelerated depreciation to 
companies that export more than the average in their respective 
industry as a percent of total earnings. 
  -  Give permanent 
investment tax breaks to companies whose overseas sales are 
outstanding in their sector. 
  -  Allow all Colombians to have 
tax-free savings accounts and individual retirement 
accounts. 
  -  Encourage banks to boost the amount they lend to the 
industrial sector as a percentage of their total portfolio. 
  -  Give 
special tax credits for investment in computers and other 
information-technology assets. Such incentives must exceed the 
current 14 percent deduction from the sales tax. 
  -  The president 
of the republic should call a regular monthly or at least 
quarterly meeting so that he and his economic advisers and the 
representatives of Colombia's leading companies and trade 
associations can analyze export trends. 
  -  Unions and marketing 
firms should gather and disseminate information on the available 
technology licenses that are pertinent to their industry. 
  -  The 
authorities should offer permanent tax credits to promote 
research and development. 
  -  Develop enforceable 
intellectual-property laws to protect patents, copyrights, and 
other innovations. 
  -  Create a research and development 
institution, together with other Latin American countries, 
similar to Europe's Eureka. 
  -  Found a university that specializes 
in science, technology, engineering, and research. 
  -  Industries 
and unions ought to set up institutes that focus in particular 
on technology for developing skills and innovations in each 
sector. 
  -  The government should establish a prize for the company 
that invests the most in people, promotes the training of human 
resources, and encourages the development of its employees' 
abilities. 
  -  Tax breaks must urgently be created for investment in 
specialized training. 
  -  The Executive Branch must provide 
scholarship funding for companies interested in sending their 
employees overseas for commercial or technical 
programs. 
  -  Establish more advanced degrees in the Colombian 
universities that focus on science and technology in their 
curricula. 
  -  Unions should set benchmark prices for their 
companies that can be compared with those of their foreign 
competition, using factors such as customer satisfaction, 
relative costs, capital structure, and investment in 
innovations. 
  -  The government should award annual prizes to the 
trade associations that further the success of exports. 
  -  The 
authorities should finance the development of private cargo 
airports and all of the infrastructure needed to achieve greater 
competitiveness. 
  -  Multimodal transport should also be started, 
and roads ought to be made safer and improved substantially.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Concerns and Questions"] </F>
  [Text] The February consumer price index (or the inflation 
rate, as Colombians see it) has given rise to legitimate concern 
among our economic authorities and, in general, among all 
players in the economy. The February inflation rate does more 
than just affect the pocketbooks of the Colombian people. It 
also shows that something about economic policy or the country's 
structure of production is preventing us from reaching the not 
very ambitious goal (as we have remarked before) of cutting the 
inflation rate to 19 percent in 1994 and below that in future 
years. 
  Perhaps because of concern over the failure to achieve quick 
success in the battle against inflation, we are starting to 
perceive some degree of despair among our authorities, 
especially the Board of Directors of the Bank of the Republic, 
and private businessmen. The latest news is that a new package 
of measures is being cooked up "to stem overseas borrowing and 
slow the growth of the money supply." 
  According to the information that this paper published last 
weekend, the idea is to tighten controls over the inflow of 
foreign exchange into the country through overseas borrowing and 
thus to ease the pressure on the amount of money in circulation, 
which is expanding at a rate of 40 percent a year, when the Bank 
of the Republic's Board set a target of 21 to 27 percent for 
1994. 
  Concern among the authorities is compounded by concern among 
businessmen and production unions over the fast pace at which 
the peso is strengthening vis-a-vis the dollar and the 
currencies of the countries with which Colombia trades actively. 
The fact is that while inflation remains stubbornly at around 23 
percent, the exchange rate is declining at 8 to 10 percent a 
year. As a result, it is impossible to sustain the real exchange 
rate (another of the Bank of the Republic's goals) and to 
prevent a greater revaluation of the peso, to the detriment of 
the production sector and, in particular, exporters. This is why 
various circles, including former presidents, are pressing for 
an accelerated devaluation (something that politicians are 
welcoming), even if it means faster money supply growth and, 
ultimately, an inflation rate that exceeds the Bank of the 
Republic's target. 
  Given this state of affairs, even the casual observer would 
notice the conflict between the Bank of the Republic (which is 
primarily interested in reducing inflation) and the private 
sector, which fears that economic policy will lead to a sharper 
revaluation of the peso that will irreversibly harm the domestic 
and foreign competitiveness of our companies. 
  This apparent conflict between the monetary and 
exchange-rate 
authority (the Board of the Bank of the Republic) and the 
private sector ought not to continue and widen, because the risk 
is that the process of trade and financial liberalization will 
lose "credibility," thus increasing the pressure to reverse the 
series of reforms that the Gaviria administration has undertaken 
to internationalize the Colombian economy. Even more seriously, 
this would be happening in the midst of an election campaign to 
choose President Gaviria's successor. 
  In a way, then, what is required is that the Board of the 
Bank of the Republic, the government, and the private sector 
alike coldly analyze what is going on. Is there simply an 
excessive flow of capital into the country that demands a 
tightening of controls, or is an even larger budget deficit 
required in these new times? Does the production of foodstuffs 
require new and greater incentives after all? Or does the 
inflation rate have to be under 10 or 15 percent a year in order 
for the liberalization to be successful? 
  We do not have answers to these questions, but we want to 
pose them to shed light on an issue that is all too important to 
the country's future development. The credibility of economic 
policy and the prestige of the Board of the Bank of the Republic 
are not the only things at stake; so is the fate of the various 
production sectors and of many Colombian companies.

  [Text] Quito, 26 Apr (EFE) -- The first day of a two-day 
strike against the privatization plans of the Ecuadoran 
Government headed by conservative Sixto Duran-Ballen resulted in 
blocked roads and minor incidents in the countryside and cities 
that left several people injured, four of them by gunfire. 
  Government spokesmen admitted that the unions and Indian and 
peasant organizations which supported the strikes caused the 
intermittent closure of some roads but stressed that public 
forces rapidly reopened them. The spokesmen did not say if 
there were any clashes. 
  According to reports from radio and television stations and 
human rights organizations, four peasants are in serious 
condition after being shot by soldiers who were trying to 
unblock a road near the port of Guayaquil, Ecuador's most 
congested city. Another person was injured when he was struck by 
a tear gas canister, according to information from the 
Ecumenical Human Rights Commission (CEDHU). 
  Teachers and students also participated in the national 
strike even though the government had suspended classes at 
schools and colleges throughout the country to prevent 
disturbances. 
  Government reports of strike observance in the electricity, 
telephone, fuel, and social and medical security sectors 
differed from more radical reports by the "Defense of 
Sovereignty and Anti-Privatization Front," [Frente de Defensa de 
la Soberania y Contra las Privatizaciones], the organization 
that organized the strikes. 
  A Public Communication Secretariat communique containing a 
city by city strike report said there were only a few protests. 
As of 1800 (2300 GMT), the protests had not included power or 
telephone service cuts, a possibility voiced by some strike 
leaders. 
  Evening newspaper headlines read: "War on Privatization," 
"Roads Militarized," "Roads Blocked," "Bureaucrats, Indians, and 
Teachers Paralyze Country," and "Protests." Radio and television 
stations reported that many public institutions that could be 
affected by privatization are on strike. Platoons of soldiers 
and police are patrolling the principal cities and national 
roads and are guarding gas stations and public offices. 
  Ecuadoran Government Minister Marcelo Santos said the strike 
is being encouraged by "a tired union leadership that confuses 
state modernization with massive dismissals." He added that 
"the modernization process cannot be postponed or renounced." 
Santos said public security forces "have coordinated to ensure 
security, peace, and normalcy for those who wish to work." 
  Carlos Larreategui, secretary general of public 
administration, said the government will not allow the country 
to be paralyzed by these two days of protests, which are 
occurring only five days before the legislative, municipal, and 
provincial elections on 1 May. Larreategui said the government 
could impose "administrative and even criminal sanctions" on the 
strike leaders, but he ruled out the possibility of decreeing a 
state of emergency.

  [Text] The government has not proposed a general program of 
privatization, but a modernization program, Government Minister 
Marcelo Santos stated. The privatizations are an aspect of 
modernization; they will occur where they are required so that 
this process can have positive results, the minister added. The 
modernization process is a fact and it will be developed and 
implemented, the minister continued. 
  Meanwhile, (Jose Maria Cabascango), leader of the National 
Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador, said the 
Indian movement is not opposed to the modernization of the 
country, but it is opposed to the indiscriminate privatization 
of state-owned companies. That is why, he remarked, we will 
continue to support the struggle throughout the country with 
mobilizations and assemblies. 
  Minister Marcelo Santos asserted that the first day of the 
48-hour strike occurred without major incidents, although there 
were some sporadic incidents in various areas in the country. 
Santos said the strike is progressing normally and the rights 
of workers and other sectors have been respected, particularly 
those of Indians who have blocked traffic between provinces. 
The minister stated the government is not expecting acts of 
violence, but the police and Armed Forces are ready to guarantee 
the peace and security of Ecuadorans.

  [Text] This morning, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy and 
Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia emphatically denied that 
Armed Forces generals had requested the president's resignation. 
A rumor was begun in local circles that generals not linked with 
Army Commander General Lino Oviedo had requested Wasmosy's 
resignation to protest Oviedo's excessive influence over the 
military institution. Foreign media sources, particularly in 
Argentina, repeated the rumor. 
  A rumor circulated during the meeting of the Argentine, 
Bolivian, and Paraguayan presidents in Formosa yesterday, 
indicating that there was strong dissatisfaction among young 
Paraguayan officers for the excessive power that the Army 
commander in fact holds. 
  Wasmosy was asked about the matter after a meeting at the 
commander in chief's offices this morning. The president said 
the rumor was not true. "It is absolutely false. It seems the 
papers are short of real news," Wasmosy said in referring to the 
foreign press. 
  Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia characterized the foreign 
press publications as real nonsense. "It is real stupidity. I 
do not know where this disinformation might be coming from. It 
is absurd to even think that generals could ask for the 
resignation of the president of the Republic," Estigarribia said. 
  The minister said if the information originated locally, it 
was just "nonsense," invented by the press interested in 
destabilizing the democratic process. If it originated abroad, 
it was pure disinformation, Estigarribia added. 
  Today, Wasmosy travelled to Salvador (Bahia). Not all the 
generals -- and not even Oviedo, who usually comes to see the 
president off -- were present at the airport. The defense 
minister explained that the absence of some generals was due to 
the fact that they were carrying out tasks in the interior of 
the country.

  [Excerpts] Huancayo, Peru, 26 Apr (EFE) -- Official sources 
have reported that the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement 
(MRTA), which has been oficially described as dismantled, has 
called for a two-day "armed strike" in three Peruvian central 
jungle region provinces. A police report released today in 
Huancayo, 415 km southeast of Lima, states that the MRTA, which 
is inspired by Ernesto "Che" Guevara, has called an "armed 
strike" for 28 and 29 April according to announcements painted 
on walls, circulated in bulletins, and written on flags. 
  The three Peruvian central jungle provinces where the "armed 
strike," which is a strike under threat of death, is being 
promoted are Chanchamayo and Satipo in Junin Department, the 
capital of which is Huancayo, and Oxapampa in Pasco Department. 
  An official Defense Ministry communique issued on 21 April 
states that the MRTA attacked a truck carrying soldiers and 
civilians on the Villarrica highway to Oxapampa. They murdered 
three soldiers and 12 civilians and wounded 30 people. Another 
13 people are missing. The communique adds that the Army is 
intensifying operations "to capture the members of the 
narcoterrorist gangs" that operate in the region. [passage 
omitted] 
  Until now the Shining Path was the only organization to have 
called "armed strikes" in different parts of Peru, especially in 
Ayacucho in the South Andean region where this organization was 
born in 1980 and in Lima where the measure always failed despite 
the fact that the transportation sector almost always obeyed the 
strike call. 
  Some analysts believe this action may indicate the union of 
the two subversives organizations, at least in the central 
jungle region. [passage omitted]

  [Text] During yesterday morning's session, the plenum of 
the Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD), by a vote of 50 to 
one, approved the Citizens' Participation and Control bill 
recommended by the CCD Constitution Commission. 
  The draft bill, divided into 47 articles, was proposed by 
legislator Carlos Torres y Torres Lara (NM-C90) [New Majority -- 
Change 90), who said this bill makes important contributions to 
Peruvian law as compared with the laws of other countries in 
Latin America and the world. He pointed out that this is the 
first authentically democratic step in the country's political 
decisionmaking, as it combines direct and indirect democracy. 
  Torres y Torres Lara said this bill gives the people the 
opportunity to participate in the reform of the Constitution and 
the laws, as well as to revoke the appointment of authorities 
and to be informed as to how the budget is implemented, among 
other things. The legislator stated: "No more laws that do not 
allow the participation of the people. This bill, moreover, 
will allow the public to be integrated into the process and 
their opinions taken into account." 
  Legislator Roger Caceres Velasquez said this initiative 
fills 
a gap that has existed in Peruvian laws since the Republic was 
founded. Henry Pease Garcia (MDI) [Democratic Left Movement]) 
said the bill allows for a referendum without restricting it, as 
the new Constitution does. Carlos Ferrero Costa (NM-C90) said 
the public's right to begin an initiative should be broader than 
legislators' rights. He said he was against the executive 
branch not being able to subject the draft bill to a referendum. 
  Among the public's rights to initiative included in the 
Citizens' Participation and Control bill are their participation 
in the constitutional reform, in the drafting of laws, in 
referendums, and in the drafting of municipal and regional 
regulations, among others. 
  Among the public's rights to control are over decisions to 
revoke the appointment of an authority or to remove an 
authority, and in demanding information on the implementation of 
the budget and other control mechanisms in the municipal and 
regional administrations. 
  As for a referendum, the bill states that one can be 
requested by no less than 10 percent of the electors, while the 
support of 25 percent of the electors, with a maximum [as 
published] of 400,000 signatures, is necessary to revoke the 
appointment of an authority. 
  To request information on the implementation of the budget, 
at least 20 percent of the electors, with a maximum [as 
published] of 50,000 signatures, is necessary. An authority 
will be removed if the National Elections Board determines that 
more than 50 percent of the citizens of an electoral district 
request it. 
  The CCD plenum yesterday also paid homage to the late 
attorney, ambassador, and journalist Andres Avelino Aramburu 
Menchaca, who was represented by his widow Lala Irigoyen de 
Aramburu and relatives, who arrived in Congress at 1308.

<F P=106> [Article by Gladys Bernal Barzola; all quotation marks as </F>
published] 
  [Text] Puno, 15 Apr -- President Fujimori expressed here 
his firm opposition to criticism of the human rights situation 
in Peru. He asserted that the government will not tolerate any 
interference "under the facade of the defense of human rights" 
in the measures that have led to the achievement of peace in 
Peru. 
  Speaking about his administration, Fujimori stressed that he 
will not revise any of the trials of terrorists who killed 
dozens of innocent Peruvians. He said: "Those who perpetrated 
these killings were tried in compliance with the emergency laws 
promulgated after 5 April 1992." 
  Fujimori on 15 April dedicated the second stage of the 
Yanamayo penitentiary, a maximum-security prison. In his speech, 
the president stated that in honor of the thousands who were 
killed and the hundreds of thousands of orphans, Peruvians have 
the moral duty of never forgetting this horrible tragedy. In 
view of this, he asserted that although the laws will be 
readjusted as peace is achieved, he will not yield an inch 
regarding antiterrorist issues. Fujimori said we will not allow 
Peruvians to again experience the violence of the 1980's. 
  Also present at the ceremony were Justice Minister Fernando 
Vega Santa Gadea, Interior Minister Juan Briones Davila, Energy 
Minister Daniel Hokama, and Chief Justice Luis Serpa Segura and 
other Supreme Court members. 
  President Fujimori insisted Peru enjoys a promising future 
today in view of the peace that has been achieved. Speaking to 
journalists from Argentina, France, and Spain and 
representatives from some international news agencies, Fujimori 
warned he is not being patronizing when he said Peru has 
achieved an unprecedented deed. He stated: "International 
experiences on terrorism have shown that Peruvians have defeated 
this scourge in a short period and at a minimal social cost." 
  Also present at the ceremony were 10 inmates facing 
terrorist 
charges, two of whom were serving 20-year prison sentences. 
  President Fujimori stated: Before, certain countries 
recommended not travelling to Peru but that today an 
ever-increasing number of delegations are arriving to assess 
which antiterrorist measures have been adopted by the sovereign 
government of Peru. He said: "People compare the French, German, 
and Italian legislation to our own and they say that some 
principles are violated in Peru, but they forget to mention that 
the situation in those countries is completely different from 
ours." 
  He said it was incoherent for some to try to make 
suggestions 
when "they left us to our fate" during 12 years of subversive 
violence. Fujimori said: "No government-run or private human 
rights organization or international organizations ever reported 
at the proper time the human rights violations committed by 
Shining Path [SL] or Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement 
terrorists. 
  He harshly criticized the fact that the SL was allowed to 
make propaganda in Europe and America during those past 12 
years, when in truth what they were doing was collecting funds 
to finance guerrilla activities in Peru. Without mentioning any 
organizations, Fujimori commented that some people have even 
drafted reports assessing and then disqualifying his 
administration's judicial and prison system. Fujimori said: 
"They have no right because a reform of the Civil and Penal Code 
that took experts on the Peruvian situation years to draft 
cannot be assessed in three or 10 days." 
  The chief of state admitted the existence of isolated cases 
of human rights violations and corrupt government officials. 
"But this is the case in every country of the world, including 
the most developed ones, but the institutions, as such, have 
revealed a high degree of professionalism, high moral standards, 
and respect for the law. He then added that the soldiers and 
policemen in charge of guarding the Yanamayo prison will 
safeguard the inmates' safety in an honest manner. He 
emphasized: "The change that has taken place is that they will 
not allow anyone to corrupt them." 
  The prison's second phase -- considered the most secure in 
the country -- was built in nine months and is divided into five 
wings with almost 300 inmates. The building, which has 80 
individual cells and 108 cells for two inmates, cost 4.7 billion 
Peruvian soles. A total of 260 terrorists are lodged in the 
area built first. 
  The chief of state visited this part of the prison 
accompanied by foreign journalists. SL leaders Maritza Garrido 
Lecca, Osman Morote, Martha Huatay, and other high-ranking 
terrorist leaders are in this part of the prison. It was 
learned that the aforementioned made some requests to Fujimori. 
During his visit, the chief of state also went to a children's 
home where he made some donations.

  [Text] Lima, 26 Apr (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori has personally forced a cameraman from a foreign 
television station to erase part of the film he took of women 
inmates during a visit made by Fujimori to a Peruvian prison. 
  The Association of Foreign Journalists in Peru (APEP) said 
in 
a communique released today that this event "is an isolated act 
of censorship against freedom of the press, which should not be 
allowed to be repeated." The communique adds that the cameraman 
"was forced by the president himself to erase part of the film 
taken during his visit" to the prison for terrorists in 
Yanamayo, Puno Department, at the Bolivian border. 
  According to the communique, the film that was erased 
includes footage of a group of women inmates, who read a 
document related to their situation in the presence of the 
visitors. The communique says "the correspondents and the world 
were thus deprived of information of public interest, when there 
was not even a warning of any restrictions" on the 
correspondents who visited the prison.

  [Text] Yesterday, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister 
Efrain Goldenberg Schreiber said the signing of the agreements 
on the Uruguay Round and the World Trade Organization (WTO), 
which will mark the closing of the GATT conference of ministers 
being held in Marrakech (Morocco), coincides with the 
implementation of an exhaustive modernization process in Peru. 
  Goldenberg, who is attending the GATT conference of 
ministers, which closes today in Marrakech, one of the main 
Moroccan cities, said the WTO "is the corollary to the 
liberalization policy advocated by Peru." He said the Peruvian 
modernization process seeks to achieve social development 
through the enforcement of an economic liberalization and 
stability program. Goldenberg also stressed the policies for the 
promotion of private investments, the changing role of the 
state, the privatization of state companies, and the elimination 
of all types of subsidies in Peru. 
  As for tariff commitments established within the framework 
of 
GATT, Goldenberg emphasized the Peruvian Government's decision 
to offer a 30 percent tariff ceiling, one of the most attractive 
in Latin America. The prime minister said Peru has opened its 
doors to the world market by simplifying its tariff system and 
by reducing its tariff levels to only two rates, 15 and 25 
percent, and that the first of these rates is applied to 97 
percent of Peruvian imports. 
  Regarding the relation between trade and the environment, 
Goldenberg said Peru "is very concerned about safeguarding the 
environment, but we do not want protectionist measures to be 
concealed behind the enforcement of environmental measures." 
  As for the "social clause" that several European countries 
have proposed to be included in the Uruguay Round agreements, 
Goldenberg reasserted that although Peru is a member of the 
International Labor Organization and a signatory of the majority 
of agreements that safeguard labor rights, it views with concern 
trends that in allegedly defending these principles seek to 
promote new forms of protectionism that will distort 
international trade. He said safeguarding both the environment 
and labor rights were proposed for inclusion in the final text 
of the Uruguay Round agreements, which will be signed today and 
will establish the WTO, after four days of negotiations of 
representatives from 120 countries.

  [Excerpts] The Congressional Human Rights Committee, the 
president of the Council for Peace, and the National 
Coordinating Board for Human Rights arrived today from Tingo 
Maria. They all agree that human rights violations were 
committed against civilians but they could not agree whether 
they were committed by the military or by the Shining Path [SL]. 
  The investigation they conducted in the combat area 
established that the reported bombardments did not take place. 
Moreover, Huallaga Front official sources have reported that 
antisubversive operations, which were suspended on 22 April, 
will be resumed in the next few days. 
  [Begin unidentified reporter recording] The Congressional 
Human Rights Committee, which traveled to Tingo Maria to verify 
human rights violations charges, returned to Lima today. 
Although they did not enter the theater of operations [as 
heard], where it is believed there are more victims, the 
legislators agreed that human rights violations were committed. 
They disagreed, however, on who was responsible. 
  The six legislators and the journalists who traveled to the 
site were shocked yesterday at finding seven bodies in the 
village of Moyuna, on the left bank of the Huallaga River. The 
identity of these bodies has yet to be established. Only two of 
the bodies were taken to Tingo Maria. 
  Peasants who escaped from the conflict area have reported 
that several clashes between the SL and the Army have taken 
place in the area in the last few days. [passage omitted] 
  In view of these reports, this morning, the Congressional 
Commission visited Mohena, which was believed to have been 
bombarded and where allegedly more bodies were to be found. 
This was later denied. In Mohena, the legislators met a 
soldier who was wounded when he stepped on a booby trap a few 
days ago. After staying in Mohena for 10 minutes, the 
legislators headed for Aucayacu where they interviewed more 
settlers who escaped from the conflict area in [words 
indistinct]. 
  Journalists toured sites inhabited by peasants who were 
forced to support the SL. They found destroyed huts, remains of 
lamps, scales, coca leaves, and [word indistinct] used to 
manufacture cocaine hydrochloride. As it is well-known, 
antisubversive operations were suspended as of 22 April but they 
will be resumed within the next few days. 
  It has been learned that of the 180 subversives who were 
found in the area, 35 have regrouped and are now in [name 
indistinct]. For the time being, SL activity in the Huallaga 
area has been curtailed. It is expected the SL will be defeated 
in the next few weeks. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Agustin Mantilla Campos, former interior minister 
under the APRA [American Popular Revolutionary Alliance] 
administration, will reportedly be the new APRA secretary 
general. This was supposedly the order given by ex-President 
Alan Garcia Perez to a group of APRA leaders who held a meeting 
in Cartagena, Colombia, last week. 
  This information was disclosed by a source in that political 
organization. The leaders who attended the meeting include 
Jorge del Castillo and former Ministers Gustavo Seberbein and 
Mercedes Cabanillas, among others. The source said that Garcia 
is trying to maintain the party's leadership in the hands of 
people in his complete confidence, and that he will channel the 
necessary resources to them to keep the organization "afloat" 
until "his return." Garcia reportedly told them: "I want you to 
keep the party, like a boat, afloat. When I return I will make 
it into a frigate." 
  The idea that Mantilla would take over the party leadership 
has been talked about for the last few months, especially after 
he was released. But this possibility ended when the Supreme 
Court annulled that decision and sentenced him to eight years in 
prison, which he is now serving. 
  But according to legislation, Mantilla could be released on 
parole after serving 24 months of his sentence. He may 
therefore be released in May, which is the month when the APRA 
will elect its new leadership. 
  It has also been reported that the Garcia supporters are 
paving the way within the party for getting Mantilla elected. 
The source noted that this is reflected in the elections of the 
district executive committees and the systematic separation of 
leaders or militants who disagree with this strategy. 
  The source added: "Everything is handled in such a way as to 
obey the guidelines given by Alan Garcia. Therefore, there is 
no doubt that Mantilla, unless something unexpected happens, 
will be the APRA leader in the next few months."

  [Text] Peruvian Foreign Minister Efrain Goldenberg and his 
Colombian counterpart Noemi Sanin de Rubio installed this 
afternoon the Peruvian-Colombian Good Neighbor and Integration 
Commission [Comision de Vecindad e Integration 
Peruano-Colombiana]. This commission comprises technical 
binational committees. It seeks to develop production, trade, 
tourism, transportation, communications, and to promote 
investments, culture, education, and sports between Peru and 
Colombia. 
  Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio labeled the 
agreement as historic for relations between the two countries. 
The two ministers signed two agreements, one of reciprocal 
protection for investments and another for the reciprocal 
recognition of professional titles. The two ministers also 
announced that next June, they will sign two more agreements, 
one on judicial cooperation and another on tourism promotion. 
  [Begin Sanin recording] We abide by juridical regulations in 
respect of the law and [words indistinct]. I would like to talk 
about a historic moment because [words indistinct] of the points 
that unite us [words indistinct]. I believe this is a historic 
day for relations between Peru and Colombia because we decided 
[words indistinct] to make it more dynamic, more pragmatic, more 
efficient. We are joining all our efforts, [words indistinct], 
all our forces, all agents of our society to work united. Today 
we signed two agreements [words indistinct] and in the second 
half of June we will meet again to sign more important 
agreements. Let us hold a meeting of businessmen just as we did 
with Ecuador when, as a result of the meetings of the good 
neighbor and integration commission and the free trade and 
Andean agreements, 368 Colombian companies did business with 
Ecuador last year. We want the same thing to happen with Peru. 
The doors of Colombia are open to Peruvian investments and all 
Colombians are very pleased with the normalization of the 
Peruvian situation in the Andean Pact. [end recording] 
  Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio made these 
comments after signing the two agreements with her Peruvian 
counterpart Efrain Goldenberg. The Good Neighbor and Integration 
Commission is headed, on the Peruvian side, by Arturo Woodman, 
president of the National Confederation of Private Business, and 
on the Colombian side by Hernan Beltz, former Colombian Public 
Works minister. Thus the Colombian foreign minister concluded 
her visit to our country.

  [Text] Senator Danilo Astori has placed his position as 
provisional head of the Broad Front (FA) at the disposal of his 
FA executive board colleagues because it is his understanding 
that this post must be occupied by a consensus FA candidate. 
Mariano Arana, Montevideo mayoral candidate, will occupy 
Astori's post. 
  Astori himself told EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO that on 19 May 
he 
would launch an "independent" movement that would not involve a 
restoration of Communist Party factions. 
  The senator explained that his decision was based on "two 
reasons" closely linked to his decision to head an independent 
politico-electoral alternative within the FA. 
  Astori emphasized: "I am no longer a consensus candidate." 
He 
added that in his opinion "consensus candidates must be included 
in the coalition's executive board during the current 
(electoral) stage." 
  Participants in yesterday's FA provisional executive board 
meeting told EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO that Astori expressed his 
willingness to continue working on common FA tasks for the 
November elections. 
  The other 11 FA executive board members "lauded the 
political 
tactfulness" of the former FA vice presidential candidate, and 
pointed out that they would contact their sectors to formally 
come to a decision on Astori's proposal. 
  Astori announced that he would launch on 19 May at the El 
Galpon theater an "independent FA" group, which he will head. 
During the launching ceremony he will present an initial 
"proposals document" that "will explain the characteristics of 
this political project." 
  The legislator explained: "It is not a restoration of 
Communist Party factions. It is not a coming together of groups, 
nor is it meant as a way to exclude people. It is much more than 
that. It is a long-term and absolutely pluralistic and open 
project for the FA independents, regardless of their origin."

<F P=106> [Report by Ligia Moreno and Aneris Gonzalez from "The News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] [Moreno] The economic cabinet of President Rafael 
Caldera today announced the general strategy or guidelines of 
the economic plan to be implemented over the next five years. 
One of the highlights is that Venezuelan Petroleum will give 10 
percent of its shares to its employees. Other major points 
include an emphasis on decentralization and private investments. 
Various sectors support the plan and think President Caldera is 
on the right track. Time will tell, however, and we have to wait 
and see how the economic plan proposed by the Caldera cabinet 
works. 
  [Gonzalez] It is worth mentioning that a large number of 
people from all sectors--namely, CTV [Confederation of 
Venezuelan Workers], Consecomercio [National Council of Commerce 
and Services], and Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of 
Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry]--have 
gathered here at the Eurobuilding Hotel, as you can see your 
screen, to discuss and review the entire economic program. As 
you rightly pointed out, Ligia, the opening to private 
investment is one of the highlights of this strategy, and, in 
some way, it has grabbed the attention of all sectors of society.

newscast] 
  [Text] President Rafael Caldera has sworn in new directors 
for FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] and 
the General Bank Superintendency--Norys Aguirre and Tesalio 
Cadenas, respectively. After they were sworn in, both officers 
ruled out controls on foreign exchange. They also said they 
intend to evaluate the assistance given to banks as well as the 
proposals made by Gustavo Roosen, special commissioner for 
financial reforms. 
  FOGADE Director Norys Aguirre stressed her institution's 
duty 
to restore confidence in the financial system, and she said that 
currently the state is the greatest FOGADE contributor. She 
referred to strategies by the leadership of FOGADE by announcing 
reforms to the law that created this fund. 
  [Begin Aguirre recording] Basically there are two 
strategies. 
One is the short-term strategy, and this is the immediate 
solution to the current banking crisis. The long-term strategy 
deals with reforms, and if these are needed I will be the first 
person to propose them, as I have done up to now, through 
Congress to the government, in due course. I am not afraid to 
make changes. If a complete FOGADE reorganization is needed, 
this will be done. [end recording] 
  For his part, Tesalio Cadenas admitted that the General Bank 
Superintendency had faults that failed to prevent greater 
control--in other words, stricter control--of the Venezuelan 
financial system.

  [Text] Foreign Trade Institute (ICE) President Alberto 
Poletto said that Venezuela gained important advantages within 
the framework of the GATT, the final agreement of which was 
signed last week in Morocco. 
  During a news conference upon his return from this important 
meeting, Poletto detailed some of the benefits obtained in the 
Uruguay Round, among which he stressed the tariff reductions 
Venezuelan products will receive in Japan (90 percent), the 
European Union [EU] (43 percent), and the United States (36 
percent). 
  According to the ICE president, the creation of the World 
Trade Organization [WTO], which will replace GATT in 1995, will 
offer our country guarantees. "We will be very much in the WTO, 
because if we are not in it, we will be left out of the world," 
he commented. 
  Likewise, he stressed that Venezuela's entry into the WTO 
gives it the right to demand proof of direct damage to verify 
dumping claims before sanctions are imposed, including the 
verification of direct damage to local producers caused by 
dumping. 
  On this issue, Poletto referred to the controversy that 
arose 
over Venezuelan steel exports, which he described as an 
"unjustifiable problem." 
  To regain this right, Venezuela--together with the Andean 
Pact member nations--has promised to reduce tariffs on 
industrial products to 35 percent within five years. 
  On the same subject, he pointed out that the WTO will 
eliminate the discrimination that has existed concerning dumping 
regulations, establishing safeguards, and resolving disputes. 
  Until now the GATT decisions on these issues were not 
binding 
on member nations, as was proven by the ruling on the quota 
system imposed by the EU on Latin American banana exporters. 
  Likewise, Poletto referred to the achievements obtained in 
the agricultural sector "in which tariffs became clear-cut." 
According to the agreements, approximately 30 products will 
receive a 40-percent tariff reduction based on the amounts 
imported between 1986 and 1988. 
  In his judgment, this will allow the Venezuelan Government 
"room to make changes in agricultural tariffs to meet the 
country's needs." 
  The ICE president will soon present the agreements signed in 
Morocco to Congress for its review and approval. According to 
his expectations, this procedure should be completed before 
January 1995, when the WTO will be created. Venezuela hopes to 
become a charter member of the WTO.

  [Text] Caracas, 27 Apr (AFP) -- In a communique issued 
today in Caracas by the Foreign Ministry, the Venezuelan 
Government condemns for the Haitian Armed Forces for "the 
massacre of 23 Haitians" in that country on Saturday. In the 
communique, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry "deplores the 
worsening of the Haitian crisis and deeply regrets this wave of 
violence, intimidation, torture, disappearances, assassinations, 
and illegal imprisonment of people linked to democratic 
political and labor movements." After indicating the death of 
the 23 Haitians "should be added to the list of other equally 
condemnable events in recent months," the Venezuelan Foreign 
Ministry states that there is "a systematic campaign by the 
Haitian military sector to exterminate the Haitian Democratic 
Movement and prevent a return to peace and institutional 
normality." 
  The Venezuelan Government calls on Latin American and 
Caribbean countries "to join efforts to end the situation of 
violence and terror." It reiterates its support for OAS and UN 
efforts to restore institutional norms to Haiti. 
  In conjunction with the United States, Canada, and France, 
Venezuela forms part of the so-called "Friends of Haiti Group," 
which has tried to mediate the return of ousted President Jean- 
Bertrand Aristide. Aristide took asylum in Venezuela for some 
months after the military coup against him in September 1991.

  [Text] The Comptroller General's report describes a series 
of irregularities and deficiencies discovered by that agency 
during 1993. They were found in the central and the 
decentralized administration, in governors' offices, legislative 
assemblies, city halls, and municipal councils. 
  Cases of misapplication of funds (used for purposes other 
than those intended) have been observed in the central 
administration for more than 664 million bolivares; the 
fractionalization of construction contracts to avoid prior 
review, for 450 million bolivares; irregularities in the Daily 
Care Homes program for 4.7 million bolivares; and a number of 
irregularities in the rental of equipment for the 1992 elections 
for 164 million bolivares plus $136,000. There was a diversion 
to other purposes of funds allocated for the modernization of 
the Treasury; a quantity of merchandise abandoned and with 
evidence of pilferage, amounting to more than $9 million and 
located in customs and warehouses; lack of accountability of 
vehicles belonging to the state and the assignment of some of 
them to retired military officers; and the blockage in 
commercial banks of 287 million bolivares allotted to the Milk 
Fund and Food Fund programs. 
  According to the report, 91 warnings were given during the 
period for lack of documentation and wrongful payment for 37 
million bolivares. Employees were fined 606,500 bolivares for 
violating the regulations. Thirteen investigations were begun of 
presumably irregular acts, and five accusations were sent to the 
state prosecutor for civil and criminal charges. 
  With regard to tax receipts, the comptroller's report 
describes delays and frequent requests for postponements, to the 
extent that information on 1992's accounts is available. In 
addition, the organization reports shortcomings in accounting 
operations and defects in conducting collections. In the area of 
customs, the report says that airport customs at Maiquetia has 
not turned in its accounts for 1990, 1991, and 1992, while 
customs' accounts at La Guaira and Puerto Cabello for 1992 are 
still pending. 
  The Comptroller's Office says that, with regard to Tax Stamp 
fees, none of the Finance Ministry's regional offices has turned 
in its accounts. 
  As for the Value Added Tax, the office inspected the 
customs' 
posts to oversee compliance with requirements, the truthfulness 
of declarations, the determination of the tax base, and billing 
and payment of taxes, following which it concluded that existing 
deficiencies have created the conditions for the commission of 
irregularities and impede the proper oversight of billing and 
collecting taxes. 
  With regard to liquor taxes, it was noted that 1.184 billion 
bolivares that were declared were not paid within the legal time 
limit and late fees were not collected. 
<H5>  States and Municipalities </H5>
  The report says that the Comptroller's Office conducted 19 
inspections, of which the field work was concluded for nine, and 
another three were still being conducted at the end of 1993. It 
is noted that the inspection plan was suspended for a time due 
to activities providing advice to new governors and mayors on 
such matters as the changes in budget laws and ordinances, and 
the role of municipal comptrollers. 
  The organization began 18 administrative investigations and 
declared 66 regional and local officials to be responsible. In 
addition, 32 charges were substantiated and forwarded to the 
prosecutor, with evidence of civil and criminal responsibility. 
<H5>  Decentralized Administration </H5>
  The Comptroller's Office carried out its responsibilities 
with the decentralized agencies by means of inspections, 
financial and administrative audits, and supervision, for a 
total of 512 actions. The majority of these dealt with oversight 
of the Program Law for Financing the Investment Plan; 
surveillance of the privatization process and use of funds from 
the so-called social megaproject; and inspection of the 
austerity program ordered by the government in 1992. 
  The organization confirmed the existence of attitudes 
contrary to fiscal discipline and to the efficient management of 
public services, and of disrespect for legal procedures "with no 
sign of a desire to remedy the situation and to apply suitable 
sanctions against the officials responsible, with the 
aggravating circumstance of the high social and financial cost 
which, in the country's current condition, the erratic and 
inefficient performance of public institutions entails." The 
report states that these situations were promptly brought to the 
attention of the pertinent authorities so that they could take 
the required corrective measures. 
  Decentralized organizations and activities investigated by 
the comptroller included the indebtedness of the PDVSA 
[Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.], the situation in Pequiven 
[Petrochemical Company of Venezuela, Inc.], construction 
contracts of CVG [Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana], public 
credit obligations of Bauxiven [Venezuelan Bauxite, Inc.], 
payment of interest at Edelca [Caroni River Electrification 
Project], the sale of products at less than international prices 
at Fesilven [expansion not given], verification of the terms of 
sale of Bandagro [Agricultural-Livestock Development Bank], 
oversight of the austerity programs at the national 
universities, evaluation of zero-coupon bond operations at the 
Central Bank, review of obligations undertaken and use made of 
funds received by the Workers Bank of Venezuela, analysis of the 
financial situation of the Industrial Bank, evaluation of the 
privatization program of the Investment Fund of Venezuela, study 
of the restructuring process at Corpoindustria, inspections at 
Cadafe [Electrical Administration and Development Corporation], 
evaluation of the John Paul II program, of the Simon Bolivar 
Center, analysis of losses at the National Institute of Race 
Tracks, the financial situation of the Venezuelan Institute of 
Social Security, and analysis of investments by INCE [National 
Institute of Cooperative Education].

<F P=106> [Article by Alfredo Carquez Saavedra] </F>
  [Text] The policy of issuing zero-coupon bonds is 
conditioned by the financial crisis, and the Central Bank of 
Venezuela (BCV) finds itself obliged to absorb part of the 
liquidity that is injected into the banks being aided. 
  Chief of Cordiplan [Office of Coordination and Planning] 
Enzo 
del Bufalo made this statement yesterday, when he was asked if 
the increase in yield that this financial paper had experienced 
during the last auction conducted at the BCV did not contradict 
the administration's strategy for stabilizing the economy. 
  One of the results produced by the most recent sale of 
zero-coupon bonds was an increase in their yield by slightly 
more than 2 percent, which caused an increase in the ceiling of 
the cost of money to 72.13 percent. 
  Del Bufalo said that it would not be possible to correct 
this 
problem until the financial crisis is resolved. When asked 
whether the BCV's actions are aimed at preventing capital 
flight, he recalled that an increase in interest rates also 
serves to "direct savings toward the domestic market." 
  Referring to the controversial Tax on Bank Debts (IDB), he 
said that, with or without the Value Added Tax (IVA), the IDB 
would go forward, even though it had been proposed only "to deal 
with the emergency." 
  He also stated that the tax reform presented by the 
administration to the National Congress could generate more 
revenue than it was estimated IVA would produce. Nevertheless, 
he made clear that "even so, a gap would remain" in the budget, 
and because of this the IDB had been proposed. It is "an 
instrument that is essential in order to reduce the deficit to 
less than 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP)." 
  The head of national planning also said that within a couple 
of months, he will present what will be the long-term strategy 
of President Caldera's government. He stressed that growth 
without inflation would be among the basic principles of the 
plan, the Ninth National Plan, as it was in the eighth plan, The 
Great Turning. "But this growth must be maintained by productive 
investment and not by spending by the state." 
  Del Bufalo's statements came after his participation in the 
forum, State Intervention vs. Free Economy, organized by the 
Venezuelan Institute of Finances. 
  In his presentation, the chief of Cordiplan said that in 
Venezuela, tax payments represent less than two percent of GNP 
[gross national product], in sharp contrast to the fact that in 
a "normal country" taxes generally exceed 10 percent of GNP. 
  He said that an economic policy "of doubtful efficacy" had 
been tried in the country, and that it had been politically 
nonviable. The previous government, he said, thought that an 
open economy and market mechanisms would be sufficient to 
overcome this model. "It was a conceptual and empirical error to 
leave the functioning of the economy to market dynamics, and 
that has been our basic discrepancy with that administration." 
  There had been no long-term planning, and it is the state 
that must produce the appropriate economic policy to create a 
market that does not yet exist. He said that the alternative to 
be followed must become a reality with the cooperation of the 
private sector, "which is responsible for financing part of the 
increase in costs with its earnings." 
  "The state must resolve the structural problem that is 
causing inflation, but while the fiscal deficit is a problem of 
the state, it is also true that it is a responsibility of 
business, because business does not pay taxes." 
  In addition, he maintained that although he does not believe 
the maxi-devaluation is feasible, "this dark horizon will become 
more probable, if the Congress does not do its duty."

  [Text] Caracas, 24 Apr (EFE)--Nine Venezuelan Air Forces 
officers who participated in the attempted coup on 27 November 
1992 were released Saturday and will return to their duties. 
Charges against the nine officers, who took asylum in Peru after 
the second military coup attempt, were dismissed by a decree 
issued by President Rafael Caldera. 
  The officers are Captains Senibaldo Palacios, Wilfredo 
Santiago Sanchez Trujillo, Wilson Marin Leal, Luis Antonio 
Romero, Daniel Pereira, Jean Luis Duran Siso, and Sanchez 
Trujillo. Charges were also dismissed against Lieutenants Fidias 
Garrido and Alexis Montilla. 
  Only three of the officers who returned to Venezuela to 
surrender to justice continue to be detained at the San Carlos 
prison in northern Caracas. There are still 13 coupist officers 
in Peru, including General Visconti Osorio, one of the leaders 
of the 27 November 1992 military insurrection. 
  In Venezuela, 21 soldiers are still being held for 
rebellion. 
The soldiers are headed by Admiral Luis Cabrera Aguirre, who is 
held at the San Carlos prison together with 13 officers and a 
soldier. 
  Virginia Contreras, the defense lawyer of the coupist 
soldiers, said to reporters that the cases against the officers 
who are still under arrest should also be dismissed and that 
they should be allowed to return to the National Armed Forces.

<F P=106> [Article by "special correspondents" Roque Gonzalez Vera, </F>
Hilarion Acosta, and Jorge Caceres] 
  [Text] Formosa, Argentina -- Argentina, Paraguay, and 
Bolivia have decided "at the highest level" to give the highest 
priority to the handling and solution of all matters pertaining 
to the Pilcomayo River, and they also decided to establish that 
the carrying out of any tasks, both at the technical and 
environmental levels, will be carried out in coordination with 
the three countries' proper organizations. 
  The tripartite decision to act "as one body" in the solution 
to the technical, political, and environmental problems 
curiously does not contain the manner in which the financial 
resources will be obtained to carry out the scheduled tasks in 
the lower basin, which is shared by Argentina and Paraguay, and 
the middle and upper basins, which are in Bolivian territory. 
  [Argentine President Carlos] Menem, [Paraguayan President 
Juan Carlos] Wasmosy, and [Bolivian President Gonzalo] Sanchez 
de Lozada, together with their foreign ministers and chief 
technicians, met for six hours in this provincial capital to 
discuss a common action policy for the Pilcomayo River. 
  The governors of Formosa, Salta, and Jujuy Provinces 
(Vicente 
Joga, Roberto Ulloa, and Oscar Perassi) also participated in the 
meeting. 
  The Declaration of Formosa signed by the presidents 
indicates 
the need to ensure an equitable distribution of the river's 
waters in its lower reaches in Argentina and Paraguay, and in 
this respect it urges that "the immediate action that already 
has been decided on has the objective of re-establishing the 
equal flow of the water that enters the territories of the two 
countries, mainly to attenuate the process of damage and 
clogging and to prevent an abrupt change in the river's course 
at the points listed as critical." 
  The presidents also decided to include the middle and upper 
basins in the work plans that are to be carried out; therefore, 
they decided to "hasten the studies regarding the third phase of 
the project for the multiple development of the Pilcomayo's 
basin with the intention of implementing a program for the 
overall management of said basin taking into account the 
intensive erosion of the upper basin, the control of the flow, 
and the rational use of the waters." 
  The Argentine, Paraguayan, and Bolivian Governments decided 
to promote the development of the Pilcomayo's basin and its area 
of influence in order to optimize the exploitation of its 
natural resources, create jobs with the attraction of 
investment, and allow the rational use of its hydraulic 
resources. 
  In order to help this development, the chiefs of state 
agreed 
to the creation of a "tripartite commission for the development 
of the Pilcomayo's basin," and instructed their foreign 
ministers to sign the respective agreement as soon as possible. 
  During the news conference they gave, Wasmosy revealed that 
this commission will be made up of six members (two from each 
country) and will have an executive secretary, who will be 
contracted in another country, possibly a European country. 
  Finally, the presidents expressed the concern of their 
governments regarding the protection of the environment, and 
said they will support action "directed at sustained development 
that will necessarily include the implementation of 
environmental protection policies with an eye to preventing the 
region's environmental deterioration." 
  During the news conference in the Turismo Hotel's Blue Room 
after the signing of the joint declaration, Menem said: "If 
anyone is demanding indemnification for damages, then the first 
thing he has to do is demonstrate that the accused party is 
responsible. This is a basic fact in law." With these words, 
the Argentine president rejected Argentine responsibility for 
the damage that is being suffered by our country due to the 
opening of the channel [from the Pilcomayo into Argentine 
territory]. 
  Menem, who remained fairly calm until he was asked if the 
Pozo Hondo-Mision La Paz bridge is to be considered 
indemnification for Paraguay, added: "If they are accusing 
Argentina of causing damage then they have to demonstrate that 
we are responsible for the waters not entering the neighboring 
country and that we are to blame. It is true that I do not know 
who is to blame in this matter because the two countries agreed 
to the opening of channels. We opened a channel, but it seems 
that the Paraguayans did not open theirs correctly." 
  The Argentine president emphasized that they are willing to 
cooperate. But "we will not accept a responsibility that is not 
ours," he said. To prove these remarks about cooperation, Menem 
confirmed that the construction of the Pozo Hondo-Mision La Paz 
bridge over the Pilcomayo will begin immediately. This bridge 
will allow a road connection with Salta Province and will mean 
the physical linking of the Atlantic with the Pacific through 
the Paraguayan Chaco. 
  He indicated that the Formosa Province Government headed by 
Vicente Joga has received instructions to begin the work as soon 
as possible. "The bridge has to be finished by the end of the 
year, which is when the rains start and the river begins to 
rise," he said. 
  When Menem finished speaking, Wasmosy took over, saying: "I 
do not want to go into details and predict who is to blame and 
who is not. My intention is to look at the positive and 
constructive factors, and the positive aspect is that there 
exists the political desire of the three countries, interpreting 
the feelings of their peoples, to apply a rational and equitable 
solution to this problem." 
  With these words the Paraguayan president is practically 
rejecting the possibility of requesting that Argentina pay 
indemnification for the damage that has been caused, as though 
two years without receiving a drop of water and another year of 
receiving it in drops are not a sufficient argument to face this 
problem in a responsible way. 
  Regarding this point, it must be recalled that in 1991 
Paraguay and Argentina did agree to the opening of experimental 
channels. On schedule and on the agreed date the Argentines 
opened their channel, but the Paraguayan technicians arrived 15 
days later and, to top everything else, opened a channel against 
the river's current as though the river could reverse its 
current. Colorado Party politician Juan Roque Galeano was then 
director of the National Pilcomayo Commission, and he should be 
put on trial to determine his responsibility in the loss of our 
sovereignty. 
  But this negligence does not exonerate our neighbor from his 
responsibility. The agreement called for the opening of a pilot 
channel, but their technicians brought in bulldozers and opened 
a channel with a depth not contemplated in the agreement. And 
this flatly points to bad faith. They also promised to close 
the channel, and in September 1993 Menem stressed that Paraguay 
would receive the same amount of water as Argentina by the end 
of 1993, but that is still in his dreams so far. 
  And this is not all. Argentine technicians and geologists 
had perfect knowledge of a subterranean geological structure 
that cuts the Pilcomayo perpendicularly, thus causing a tilt 
toward Argentine territory. Formosa Province waited for the 
sediment to reach that point and it was there that it opened 
"the tap" that is very difficult to close today. If there had 
been good will, concern to prevent the closure of the river's 
bed would have been expressed much sooner and not when Paraguay 
is facing a de facto situation that will be very difficult to 
reverse. 
  During the news conference and regarding the channel's 
closure, Menem again promised that the work will have top 
priority "as scheduled by Paraguayan technicians. I again 
repeat that Argentina will not receive one drop more than 
Paraguay. We are going to achieve an equitable distribution of 
the Pilcomayo, as it should be between brother countries." 
  Referring to costs, Menem explained that constructing the 
dam 
on the Pilcomayo at the site of the two countries' channels will 
cost $18 million and these funds already have been obtained in 
Europe. The dam that has been planned in the area of Villa 
Montes, Bolivia, will cost $300 million. The Argentine 
president reaffirmed that the bridge's construction and the 
channel's closing will be finished before the end of the year, 
and only then will the other scheduled works be carried out. 
  Asked by ABC COLOR's special correspondents on his country's 
participation in the financing of the works on the upper reaches 
of the Pilcomayo, Sanchez de Lozada said: "If Bolivia does not 
participate in the seeking of solutions, the Pilcomayo will die. 
We have a large responsibility in this matter because the river 
starts in our territory." 
  The Bolivian president flatly denied press agency reports 
datelined La Paz that reported an alleged negative response to 
committing his country to international financing for the work 
to be carried out on the Pilcomayo. "It is absolutely not true 
that Bolivia refuses to contract debts. We form a team together 
with Paraguay and Argentina in which each party has a determined 
quota of sacrifice. We have given top priority to the river, 
and we look at it as a system that must be protected," he said. 
  It is important to point out that the Bolivian president 
acknowledged that his country has always traditionally 
considered the Pilcomayo to be a Paraguayan-Argentine concern 
and that it has not implemented any direct action because it is 
not directly affected by the silting up of the river. 
  "Bolivia stopped looking at the Pilcomayo as something 
foreign because its fate also affects us. The river poses a 
tremendous environmental challenge because the consequences can 
be extraordinary. And it must be taken into account that the 
environmental damage can cost much more than the investment 
being projected." 
  The presidential news conference was delayed due to changes 
made in the joint declaration. The meeting with some 100 
journalists from the three countries and international agencies 
was held in the Turismo Hotel's Blue Room. 
  During the conference, Wasmosy highlighted the political 
will 
of the three countries to implement measures to save the river 
from its imminent disappearance. He also emphasized the 
region's environmental importance and the need to preserve it. 
He also confirmed the creation of a technical commission to be 
made up of technicians from the three countries. 
  A neutral expert will be contracted for the post of 
executive 
secretary, preferably someone who is an expert in hydraulic and 
environmental matters. "It will be someone who has nothing to 
do with the interests of each country, in order to obtain the 
most just solutions and alternatives," Wasmosy said.

  [Text] On 26 April, Ernesto Melendez, Cuban minister of 
Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation, condemned the U.S. 
blockade at the 25th meeting of the Economic Commission for 
Latin America and the Caribbean being held in Cartagena, 
Colombia. 
  Melendez also condemned U.S. pressure on countries in the 
region to prevent Cuba from joining regional integration 
organizations in specific sectors such as tourism. In his 
address, Melendez stressed the deplorable health indexes of the 
continent, which have been aggravated by the imposed economic 
models. Regarding these models of commercial opening, complete 
privatization, and unregulated foreign investment, Melendez 
pointed out that 270 million people living in poverty is too 
high a figure for a population of 450 million people, in 
addition to distressing indexes of unemployment, infant 
mortality, and education, which brings to mind an endemic 
adjustment rather than a true recovery.

  [Text] A second British company will probably undertake oil 
exploration projects in Cuba. This news was released today 
during a news conference given by Michael Adda, head of the 
delegation from Caritad, a group which promotes trade with the 
Caribbean. 
  Talks will be held throughout the week among members of the 
Caritad delegation and Cuban representatives, who will discuss 
projects on ways to establish agreements in tourism, 
agriculture, oil exploration, and maritime services. 
  During the news conference it was also reported that the 
British secretary of state for trade and industry and a new 
group of British businessmen will visit Cuba in September. 
  Adda said that some of the proposals submitted by investors 
of this group will be confirmed by the end of this year. He 
added that Great Britain must also contribute to the economic 
recovery of Cuba; we are awaiting with great expectations the 
measures that will probably be adopted by the special Cuban 
legislative session that will be held this week, he said. 
  More than 100 contacts were held over the past few days 
between British and Cuban businessmen.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Let Us Be Consistent With the Language of These </F>
Parliaments"] 
  [Text] Some 80,000 meetings were held, each averaging four 
hours of debate. Speeches numbered in the hundreds of thousands. 
They were a veritable hurricane of ideas, these parliaments held 
at our work centers. 
  The major result of these exemplary discussions, at which 
each and every individual could and did express his opinions on 
crucial issues ranges far beyond any exercise in participatory 
democracy in the fullest sense of the term and far beyond any 
economic measures that might result from them. It is, first and 
foremost, the expression of an ideology vital to Cuban workers, 
the demonstration of a political culture and lifestyle that 
withstands the test of difficult times. 
  Every assembly was a frank diagnosis of an extremely complex 
economic situation. Workers engaged in an unblinking dissection 
of their working and social life at the present time, finding 
scant reason for rejoicing or celebration. 
  Transcending the most obvious causes associated with the 
collapse of the European socialist model and the intensification 
of the Yankee blockade, the most striking fact to emerge was 
that our work centers are frequently hampered by a lack of 
discipline and organization. Little use is made of the 
communities' power to control and manage. What one sees instead 
is a laid-back, accommodating, conservative, bureaucratic style, 
rather than a much-needed initiative and fighting spirit that 
seem to be caught up in a web of obsolete procedures, styles, 
methods, and mechanisms. 
  There is among the workers a great expectation of 
transformation, a visible perception that we must update and 
reform our model of productive and economic organization in 
order to remedy old errors and adapt the country to a situation 
far different from the one we enjoyed until only recently. It 
must be noted, however, that Cuban workers were speaking about 
transformations without ever waving the white flag of surrender. 
When the word "transformation" is used, the question is how to 
perfect socialism, how to make it strong enough to protect it 
from defeat. 
  There was no talk of capitalism, private property, or the 
market economy at the assemblies. Criticisms of errors and 
complaints about shortcomings were never made for the purpose of 
identifying ineffectiveness with socialism because the workers 
understand that shoddiness, bureaucracy, idleness, lack of 
economic control and discipline, administrative incompetence, 
and inadequate work incentives are unrelated to socialism unless 
an attempt is being made to deny, immobilize, and destroy it. 
  The essential humanism and equality characterizing the 
Revolution were nobly defended. No one objected to the universal 
right to education and health. The vice of excessive 
egalitarianism was condemned, however, i.e., distributing all 
that is produced and even that which is not produced, failing to 
note that some contribute more than others and that some 
contribute nothing at all! In just a few weeks of national 
debate and with the wind at our backs (provided by the clear and 
sincere language used to analyze the situation), the 
"parliaments" at the work centers greatly reinforced our 
awareness that we must become, once and for all, a nation of 
tenacious producers, leaving behind the shadow of dissatisfied 
consumers that we cast, even during the years preceding the 
special period. 
  Indeed, in order not to espouse mendacity, we must admit 
that 
Cuban society has throughout its history gradually created in 
many population groups a mentality of dissatisfied "takers," 
ever willing to demand things of society, paying little heed to 
what was given in exchange, serving it far less than we should 
have, and abusing the right to make demands upon it. 
  Without becoming discouraged, ever generous and firm, marked 
by a serenity that rules out hasty solutions just as it does 
inert, passive resistance, the Cuban workers used the 
parliaments to strengthen their will for victory. 
  Furthermore, backed by the might of many, the birth of a new 
language and a new economic mentality struggling to be expressed 
and demanding consistent action were evident. 
  For the workers' movement, the first requirement is the 
practical promotion of solutions suggested everywhere. We must 
cultivate and promote the trust which the workers have placed in 
the belief that it is they who own the economy and rule the 
country. 
  It is obvious that from here on in, this battle for the 
economy is destined to become a struggle against old ways of 
thinking and habits--held by the workers and management--that 
tend to hinder efficiency and stand in the way of using 
resources properly, something our workers can and want to do and 
of which they are capable. 
  We therefore understand that it is the prime duty of trade 
union leaders to go back over and over to the centers where they 
held the parliaments, to return there continually so that, 
joining with rank-and-file organizations, they can confront 
problems, help search for solutions, and boldly and courageously 
see what was done wrong. This is the wish of all blue-and 
white-collar workers and intellectuals, whether they toil in 
services or productive tasks, the wish of an entire nation 
saying once again that it seeks no other alternative than the 
Revolution and that, in this time of danger and sacrifice, 
transcending all difficulties, it continues to cast its vote for 
socialism.

granted to them. So far, no statement regarding the HCR 
officials' position has been made. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording, in Creole] 
Since 
last week, over 100 Haitian citizens have occupied the HCR 
premises in the Dominican Republic and have been on a hunger 
strike for three days. They ask the United Nations to respect 
their rights as political refugees. According to statements by 
their spokesman, (Aurore Walter), the group of Haitians will not 
leave the office until they have been recognized as political 
refugees. They also ask that the [word indistinct] authorities 
respect the agreement the UN Committee for Refugees signed on 
25, 26, and 27 September 1992 to protect the rights of refugees. 
The group of Haitians says the Dominicans must continue to give 
them legal and moral assistance until Haiti's situation is back 
to normal. 
  Several dozen armed policemen [word indistinct] in the yard 
of the HCR to protect the premises the refugees are inhabiting. 
So far, the HCR official in the Dominican Republic, [name

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Pedro Aspe, finance and public </F>
credit secretary, in Washington, by Jacobo Zabludovsky, in the 
Mexico City studio; from the "24 Hours" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Zabludovsky] The finance secretaries of Canada, the 
United States, and Mexico, as well as the directors of the three 
respective central banks, signed an agreement in Washington this 
morning. Could you tell us what was signed? 
  [Aspe] Today at the U.S. Treasury Department, we signed an 
agreement that has, basically, three components. In the first, 
the reciprocal $6-billion line of support [linea de apoyo] 
between the United States and Mexico was ratified. In the 
second, Canada, forming part of a trilateral effort involving 
the United States, Canada, and Mexico, joins the U.S. and 
Mexican effort with an additional financial line of support for 
1 billion Canadian dollars. The third component creates a 
consultation group called the Financial Group of North America 
[Grupo Financiero de America del Norte]. 
  [Zabludovsky] Could you please explain the importance of 
these agreements? 
  [Aspe] Regarding the reciprocal line of support, I have two 
comments. The first one is that the reciprocal line of support 
with the United States was ratified, and now it has been made 
permanent; this is what is important. These lines of support 
existed before, but they were temporary and had fixed deadlines. 
Now, fortunately, within the framework of an atmosphere of 
cooperation as equals, we have been able to make this $6-billion 
line of support permanent. 
  Second, Canada's participation, also on a permanent basis, 
represents big support. Previously, we had a 200-million 
Canadian dollar line of support with Canada; this has been 
multiplied by five and now amounts to more than 1 billion 
Canadian dollars. 
  The third component, and perhaps the most important, is that 
this financial group, called the Financial Group of North 
America, has been created. The three finance secretaries and 
the three directors of the central banks of these three 
countries will meet periodically to coordinate macroeconomic 
policies and to make economic and financial consultations. This 
is a most important step in this era of global and interrelated 
markets. 
  [Zabludovsky] Has Mexico used the U.S. $6-billion line of 
support? 
  [Aspe] No. Fortunately, we have not had to use it. We 
could have been using it since 25 March, but we have an adequate 
level of reserves, and for this reason we have not drawn from 
this line. 
  [Zabludovsky] The creation of this group, which goes into 
effect today, reminds me of what was done in Europe with the 
creation of a credit and monetary unit. Is there any similarity? 
  [Aspe] Yes. A financial group similar to the one the United 
States, Canada, and our country created today was created by the 
European countries some time ago. During the first phase, which 
is the only one to which we have committed ourselves so far, we 
will exchange information and make consultations on 
macroeconomic matters. 
  In Europe, this eventually resulted, as we all know, in the 
European central banks' offering each other total support. We 
are in the first phase that involves more interrelation and 
periodic meetings. The deputy directors of the central banks 
and the under secretaries of the three treasury departments will 
meet four or five times a year. The heads of the central banks 
and the finance secretariats, or treasury departments, will meet 
at least once a year to coordinate our policies. 
  This is very important for Mexico because in this way we 
will 
have access to key information, considering that both the United 
States and Canada are members of the Group of Seven, and, 
therefore, we can secure a lot of information within the 
framework of this new relation between the two countries. 
  [Zabludovsky] I want to take advantage of my conversation 
with you to broach a Mexican domestic problem. As a result of 
the tragic and cruel death of Luis Donaldo Colosio, financial 
markets have been upset; how has this affected Mexico? 
  [Aspe] Domestic markets were obviously negatively affected 
as a result of the brutal and unfair assassination of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio. 
  Furthermore, two virtually concurrent events took place 
abroad, which I would like to comment on later to explain how 
the Salinas administration handled the situation. The two 
negative events that took place abroad are that during the first 
few months of 1994, interest rates in the United States 
increased considerably. You may recall that long-term interest 
rates in the United States were approximately 5 to 5.5 percent 
only three months ago, and at present they are well above 7 
percent, meaning interest rates have increased in the United 
States, and this has had negative repercussions throughout the 
world and, of course, in Mexico. 
  The second negative international occurrence we have 
encountered is that the stock markets of all the emergent 
economies -- the word emergent has been used to describe 
countries such as Chile, Thailand, Malaysia, Argentina and, of 
course, Mexico -- suffered considerable reductions during the 
first few months of the year. This was due in part to the fact 
that many of the investment funds that purchase shares on the 
emergent international markets did so -- to use the jargon of 
economists -- through connections [apalancados]; in other words, 
they did so with loans to purchase shares. When shares increase 
in value there is no problem, but when they lose value these 
international funds have to sell shares to maintain their 
collateral and guarantees, intensifying the downward trend. 
This is why markets in Thailand dropped 30 percent, 25 percent 
in Malaysia, and the same happened in Argentina, Chile, and 
Mexico. There can be no question, however, the hardest blow to 
the economy was the tragic death of Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
  [Zabludovsky] What has the government done to deal with 
these three events: the increased interest rates, the problems 
on the emergent markets in general, and the dramatic domestic 
situation. 
  [Aspe] The Salinas administration has done the following: 
First, it allowed markets to adjust themselves; by this I mean 
the stock market first made a downward adjustment in an orderly 
manner. Suffice it to say there were no irregularities in this 
considerable adjustment of the first few months of the year; 
instead, it was a mature and orderly adjustment. 
  Second, interest rates were allowed to increase on money 
markets, thus raising the interest rates, which had gradually 
dropped over the past few months until they were below 9 
percent, and then they increased and doubled until they reached 
18 percent. 
  Third, the exchange rate within the range of the agreement 
depreciated to the very lowest point of that range, to 
approximately 8.5 percent. 
  Fourth, we activated the so-called lines of reciprocal 
support between the central banks of the United States and 
Mexico and between the two countries' treasuries for the amount 
of $6 billion. 
  Fifth and sixth, and quite importantly, firm fiscal policies 
were maintained. We have a nonfiscal deficit mandate from 
Congress and we have held firm to guarantee that in 1994 we will 
not have any fiscal deficit whatsoever. 
  To conclude, the central bank, the now autonomous Bank of 
Mexico, has observed a cautious monetary policy; in other words, 
it has not resorted to the easy way out. We know how easy and 
painful it was in the past to mint bills and to attempt to say 
there was no problem. We have handled the situation with a 
cautious monetary policy. 
  It is obvious markets can be adjusted, and that has been our 
economic policy. The initial effect is that we have been able 
to absorb most of the uncertainty with measures such as these. 
As the days go by, we obtain more information and because the 
instruments of economic policy are already at work, we can begin 
to reverse these phenomena. Thus, the Mexican stock market hit 
bottom and then gradually began to rise, with market decisions 
and without state intervention. Interest rates, which had 
doubled, as I said earlier, are decreasing gradually yet 
consistently. We have thus dealt with such negative effects 
with an economic policy which exhibits vision, direction, 
control and which expresses President Salinas' economic policy. 
  [Zabludovsky] Will the dollar exchange rate remain within 
range, or might there be some trauma? 
  [Aspe] What we have observed over the past few days is that 
the exchange rate went from the lower levels of the range to the 
higher levels with a depreciation of approximately 8.5 percent 
and remained there for several days. What I have observed over 
the past few days is that there has been a slight 
(?reevaluation) of the exchange rate. Why? Because we are 
distributing the adjustment so that it will not focus solely on 
the exchange rate. Partial adjustments must be conducted on 
interest rates, fiscal policy, monetary policy, and the exchange 
rate; this is why, over the past few days, we have seen an 
initial reversal of the trends we observed a week ago. 
  [Zabludovsky] Do you believe the goals of the agreement 
pertaining to inflation and the recovery of Mexico's development 
and progress can be maintained? There was talk of 5-percent 
inflation. Do you believe that is still a feasible goal? 
  [Aspe] Of course. Last year, between December 1992 and 
December 1993, we had 8-percent inflation. In the agreement, in 
fact, we set a goal of 5-percent inflation for this year. I 
have already been informed that during the first three months of 
1994 -- you, in fact, have disclosed the figures for March -- we 
have had an annual inflation rate between March 1993 and March 
1994 of 7 percent. This means that we have gone from 8 percent 
to 7 percent and that it is obvious that to the extent to which 
we adhere to our economic policy, inflation will continue to 
decrease, and we will virtually achieve the goal we set for 
ourselves in the agreement. 
  Meanwhile, from the economic recovery standpoint, recovery 
began once NAFTA was signed last November. We have seen a 
gradual increase in industrial production; it has been gradual, 
nothing spectacular, but it has been consistent in December, 
January, and February. We must acknowledge these things. When 
all the events I described earlier took place and interest rates 
jumped, our recovery could have been affected, but to the extent 
fiscal and monetary policies are maintained, to the extent we 
are able to distribute these negative effects among various 
instruments as we have done, to that extent the increase in 
interest rates will be temporary, and, therefore, its effects on 
our recovery will be passing. Once interest rates return to 
their normal level, recovery will continue. I believe we have 
seen negative effects, an active economic policy, firmness, 
direction and temporary effects, but I believe we will be able 
to prevent this from having a permanent effect on recovery. 
  [Zabludovsky] Can you speak with full confidence in Mexico's 
financial and economic future? 
  [Aspe] The word confidence is something that is obtained 
gradually over a span of years. It is obtained by persistence 
and consistency. I especially believe confidence is earned not 
only during easy times when everything is going well. I believe 
President Salinas' economic policy has succeeded at times when 
things were not going our way, when there were such negative, 
sad, and painful events, such as those at the end of the first 
quarter. Nevertheless, the fact we have not made violent 
changes, that we have stayed on our course and displayed 
consistency and perseverance will earn us the people's 
confidence, and in the end will allow the markets to play their 
roles and prevent these incidents from doing permanent damage to 
the country.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Gaona and Lucia Domville] </F>
  [Text] Herminio Blanco, under secretary for international 
commercial negotiations of the Commerce and Industrial 
Development Secretariat (Secofi), has said Mexico will not yield 
to U.S. Government pressures to expedite tariff elimination of 
600 items because currently "it is too early to renegotiate the 
chapter on market access" and because conditions for the three 
countries to modify the treaty have not changed. 
  Secofi believes that greater tariff elimination can take 
place in one or two years when the dynamics of NAFTA integration 
have changed market conditions or when the sectors have made 
strategic alliances, joint-ventures [preceding word in English], 
or mergers, but not just four months into the trilateral pact. 
  The topic of tariff elimination has become a "thorny" issue 
between the Mexican and U.S. Governments, to such a degree that 
Canada's Minister of International Trade Roy MacLaren told EL 
FINANCIERO that it is "a bilateral affair." 
  The United States, in press statements, has said that "it 
will exert pressure until it gets the greatest possible number 
of tariff reductions" from the list of 600 items published in 
the March issue of the Federal Register. Meanwhile, Secofi 
Secretary Jaime Serra Puche and Under Secretary Herminio Blanco 
agree that "if there is no agreement with private enterprise and 
no consensus between the government and businessmen in Mexico, 
no tariff elimination will be negotiated." 
  NOTIMEX reported that the telephone conversation planned 
yesterday between U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and 
Jaime Serra Puche was postponed until Wednesday. A reliable 
Mexican source said decisions are still at a "preliminary" 
level, despite the closeness of the established deadline (120 
days from 1 January). 
  Private sector sources say that while the United States is 
in 
a hurry to gain concessions as soon as possible (before Congress 
goes on summer holidays), Mexico does not want to grant any more 
concessions until it sees the results of what it has already 
negotiated. In fact, they said that U.S. demands -- included in 
two lists, the first with 600 tariff items and the second with 
more than 1,000 -- are so pretentious that they seek to 
eliminate tariffs as if the two countries were operating under 
the same conditions. They added that even though the United 
States claims that the Mexican tariffs are "too high," they 
should not forget that the difference in tariffs represents the 
negotiation between an industrialized country and a developing 
country. 
  Jaime Serra Puche warned that Mexico is only interested in 
taking to the negotiating table four groups of products: shoes, 
fruits, vegetables, and preserves. The United States, however, 
wants to negotiate under Article 302, Part 3, their lack of 
participation throughout negotiations. 
  Herminio Blanco explained that they decided to include the 
NAFTA clause to give the text flexibility in case there were 
future changes in the economic situation, or in the event of 
joint-ventures or mergers between the country's industries. U.S. 
sources said Herminio Blanco warned businessmen that Mexico "has 
no commitment to reduce tariffs" and will only do so if they are 
accepted by Mexican production plants. Blanco admitted that "it 
is too early to renegotiate the market access chapter," because 
in four months of NAFTA operations, conditions have not changed. 
Blanco contends that within a year or two the tariff 
renegotiating process could become an issue. 
  U.S. sources commented that within the next few weeks, the 
Federal Registry will publish what products are in the first 
round of negotiations. They believe that these will be goods 
that both countries agree require tariff reductions. This 
includes frozen white potatoes, rice, crude sunflower oil, 
prepared peaches, wines, tobacco products, chemical and 
pharmaceutical products, wood and paper products, shoes, 
ceramics, glass, and home appliances.

  [Text] San Pedro Sula -- Several unions have held 
simultaneous protest marches in major cities throughout the 
country to pressure the Reina administration into honoring 
promises made during the election campaign. 
  The protest march that has taken place in this city began 
one 
hour late, and participants included the National Trade Union 
Federation of Honduran Workers (FESITRANH), Independent 
Federation of Honduran Workers (FITH), and the United Federation 
of Honduran Workers (FUTH). 
  In addition, San Pedro Municipality representatives such as 
SITRAUNAH [Trade Union of National Autonomous University Workers 
of Honduras], SITRAMEDYSH [Trade Union of Medical, Hospital and 
Related, Workers], and SITRAIHSS [Workers Union of the Honduran 
Social Security Institute] also participated in the event. 
  Peasant and teachers organizations such as the Peasant Women 
Joint Development Committee (CODINCA) and COLSUMAH [Professional 
Association for the Improvement of Teaching in Honduras], among 
others, also participated in the demonstration. 
  During the march, the workers complained about the high cost 
of living and demanded a general increase in salaries. They 
also demanded the so-called moral revolution heralded by the 
government result in in-depth agrarian reforms to the benefit of 
the peasant sector, not only a minority as occurred during prior 
administrations. 
  FESINTRAH President Mario Quintanilla has said this march 
was 
just the beginning of further actions the working class will 
take to demand solutions to their grievances. 
  "President Reina has made specific promises on fundamental 
issues such as voluntary military service and the education 
system, and we are demanding the fulfillment of these promises," 
the union leader has said. 
  He has said workers feel ignored, because there are 
inequalities between earned wages and the cost of the basic food 
basket. 
  "We need positive answers from the government of the 
Republic. We want a general salary increase," Quintanilla has 
said. 
  He added the Liberal administration is obligated to provide 
answers to this popular movement. 
  In this respect, he has urged all his fellow union members 
to 
strive for real price controls, "because this country's business 
sector does whatever it wants with the prices of goods, and the 
government says nothing." 
  In addition, Quintanilla mentioned the problems confronted 
by 
residents of the community of Lopez Arellano as the result of 
the irregular manner in which the Social Housing Fund (Fosovi) 
intends to collect delayed housing payments.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 25 Apr (NA) -- Senators from the 
Justicialist [PJ] and Radical Civic Union Parties [UCR] were of 
one mind in pointing out to U.S. Government officials today that 
Argentina might only join NAFTA through Mercosur [Common Market 
of the South] or with the consent of its member countries. 
  The senators, moreover, asserted that the upper chamber will 
pass a new law on patents for pharmaceutical products, although 
they anticipated that it will not totally match up to U.S. 
demands. 
  These remarks by PJ and UCR senators were made during a 
meeting with John Heuneman, deputy assistant secretary for the 
Western Hemisphere at the U.S. Commerce Department; Sean Murphy, 
director of Southern Cone affairs at the U.S. State Department; 
and Peter Whitney, commercial attache at the U.S. Embassy in 
Buenos Aires, in the Senate's Gray Hall this afternoon. 
  PJ Senators Augusto Alasino, Mario Fadel, and Ricardo 
Branda; 
UCR Senators Jose Genoud, Ricardo Lafferriere, Jorge Cendoya, 
and Conrado Storani; and Corrientes Autonomist Party Senator 
Antonio Romero Feris also were at the meeting. 
  Among the U.S. delegation members, Heuneman did most of the 
talking; he stressed that it would be most advisable for 
Argentina to pass a new patents bill, even though he neither 
mentioned deadlines nor made it a condition for Argentina to be 
able to join NAFTA. 
  Heuneman stated the acknowledgement of inventors' rights 
will 
foster research development in our country. He added that 
international experience shows that patented medicines are not 
more expensive, as Argentine laboratories contend. 
  Sen. Genoud, chairman of the Industry Committee, said his 
party will not approve a new patents law until Congress ratifies 
the recent GATT agreement establishing the World Trade 
Organization. 
  Genoud pointed out to the Americans that the chapter on 
patents in the GATT agreement "establishes more flexible 
guidelines" than U.S. requirements in this area. He added that 
it would be a contradiction for Washington to have signed the 
Marrakech pact and yet claim conditions that go beyond what was 
established under that international agreement. 
  Genoud explained that the Patents Bill is currently under 
discussion in Congress and that public hearings are being 
conducted to learn the parties' stance on this matter. He noted 
that this round of hearings will end on 19 or 26 May with a 
deposition by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. 
  Alasino told the U.S. Government officials the Senate will 
pass a new patents law, although he made it clear that the upper 
chamber is analyzing the way of maintaining a balanced market 
and is trying to establish a deadline for the implementation of 
the patents law that will enable domestic laboratories to 
accommodate the new regulations. 
  With regard to this, he conceded that the Senate is talking 
about a 10-year deadline to acknowledge intellectual property 
rights either by the payment of royalties [preceding word in 
English] or by the granting of a monopoly to the medicines' 
inventors.

<F P=106> [Article by Aldo Renato Soares] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- Some of the main Brazilian construction 
companies like Mendes Junior, Andrade Gutierrez, and CBPO 
[expansion unknown] will form a consortium with Chinese 
companies to build the largest hydroelectric dam in the world: 
the Three Gorges project, which will be twice as large as the 
Itaipu hydroelectric dam [in Foz do Iguazu, Brazil] when 
finished. The estimated $20 billion project will be completed in 
15 years. Guo Xuyan, president of the Three Gorges project, will 
arrive in Brazil next month to visit Itaipu and hold talks with 
construction companies and capital goods suppliers (turbines and 
electricity generators). 
  The Brazilian trade offensive is being prepared by the 
Itamaraty Trade Promotion Department in reply to the Asian 
countries' interest in increasing trade with Brazil. At least 
two official Chinese trade missions have visited Brazil in the 
past six months, contacting government officials and business 
leaders. Currently a mission of 30 Brazilian businessmen is 
touring Singapore, Vietnam, and Malaysia looking for business 
deals and partnerships. In May, a business delegation will 
accompany President Itamar Franco to the PRC, and in September 
another business mission will travel to China, South Korea, and 
Indonesia. 
<H5>  Priority </H5>
  Southeast Asia is one of Itamaraty's priorities. "It is the 
fastest growing region in the world, and China is the largest 
country in the region," a diplomat said. In the past few years, 
trade with China has been increasing at 20 percent annually, and 
trade between the two countries surpassed $1 billion in 1993. 
  Brazil's main interest is to participate in hydroelectric, 
mining, and telecommunication projects, as well as in 
pharmaceutical industry, software [preceding word in English], 
and satellite launching and manufacturing technology deals. Some 
deals already are well under way. A Brazilian company will 
supply the Chinese Government with digital centrals for rural 
telephone systems -- a contract whose negotiations started in 
November 1993. 
  A Sao Paulo enterprise will sell banking automation 
equipment 
to the PRC. The CBPO, Mendes Junior, Andrade Gutierrez, and Vale 
do Rio Doce construction and mining companies already have set 
up offices in Beijing. This year Brazil and the PRC will 
commemorate 20 years since the reestablishment of diplomatic 
relations between the two countries. "Businesses tend to 
increase given the large size of the two countries in the 
international context," an Itamaraty source said. 
<H5>  South Africa </H5>
  Another market in which Brazil is interested is South 
Africa, 
which intends to invest nearly $5 billion in a reconstruction 
and development project. A Brazilian business delegation visited 
South Africa and returned very optimistic about future business 
opportunities. South Africa is a rich country with considerably 
developed technology, which is concentrated mainly on the white 
minority. 
  Elections will be held there on 27 April, and African 
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela is expected to win and 
introduce a deep transformation in the country. 
  A Brazilian company closed a deal to export tow trucks, and 
other Brazilian companies will participate in the duplication of 
telephone circuits, thus expanding telecommunications routes 
between the two countries. 
  According to a diplomatic source, the South African 
Government is particularly interested in obtaining intermediary 
technology in the fields of steel mills, mining, electricity, 
petrochemical, and agribusiness. 
  Some Brazilian construction companies will be able to 
participate in a project to build 1 million low-income houses. 
"In the mid-term, 20 million people, mainly blacks, must become 
consumers," a diplomat said. In 1993, trade between Brazil and 
South Africa was $280 million.

  [Text] Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat said today that the 
Chilean Government has not made a decision on which path to take 
in trade relations with the United States, whether this be a 
bilateral trade agreement or treaty, or NAFTA. 
  Aninat said Chile would have to wait to see how events 
develop before a proper decision is made on this issue. Aninat 
also said that while according to several studies neither of the 
two possibilities have trade advantages of any great 
significance, an agreement would in any case eliminate the 
different levels of tariffs, which would produce relatively 
larger profits for our exports of nontraditional products which 
have a large added value. 
  Aninat also said that joining NAFTA or signing a free trade 
agreement with the United States would give prestige to the 
country, and could be very important in terms of attracting 
investments, giving more stability to national economic policy 
and boosting the Chilean reputation abroad. Aninat added that 
many people believe that simply signing a free trade agreement 
with the United States is almost enough in itself, as that 
country is very strict and demanding in its standards and this 
would benefit the Chilean economy. 
  Aninat, who today attended a meeting of the Chilean-U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, said it is important to place a free trade 
agreement with the United States within its real setting and 
dimensions. He added that future negotiations should be put 
into their proper context, as neither a bilateral trade 
agreement nor joining NAFTA should be considered the more 
successful measure, nor should one or the other be considered a 
total failure or put at the highest levels, which might wear 
down the issue of our relations with the United States. He 
concluded by saying that our bilateral relations with the United 
States are very complex, have profound historical roots, and 
involve many aspects that go way beyond economic issues.

<F P=106> [Report by Fernando Fernandez and Alvaro Alvarado from the </F>
"RPC Television News" newscast; passages within quotation marks 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Eduardo Vallarino, presidential 
candidate for the Christian Democratic Party [PDC], has said his 
party is willing to hold talks with all sectors to preserve 
democracy in our country. Fernando Fernandez filed this report: 
  [Fernandez] The ticket headed by Eduardo Vallarino and Rene 
Orillac has revealed the PDC position on the country's political 
situation in light of possible alliances for the 8 May 
elections. The announcement was made before a large number of 
journalists who attended the news conference the PDC regularly 
grants on Wednesdays. Presidential candidate Vallarino said the 
PDC would support the best options for the country in any 
negotiations: 
  [Vallarino] "We are actually holding talks with all parties, 
including our staunchest opponents. It is a responsibility of 
the political parties to keep communication channels open with 
even their worst enemies to ensure that this election is honest 
and void of violence." 
  [Fernandez] The PDC candidate also condemned and criticized 
those who advocate violence as a means to impose their ideas. 
  [Vallarino] "We do not believe in violence, and we will 
prevent violence. We think it is irresponsible to even talk 
about violence. The country now has an excellent chance to show 
the world something good, something magnificent -- namely, free 
and honest elections." 
  [Fernandez] The PDC Central Campaign Committee also 
announced 
that the party will conclude its campaign on 5 May. 
  [Announcer] Meanwhile, today, Ruben Dario Carles, 
presidential candidate for the Change '94 alliance, said talks 
among the country's various civilist groups are continuing, and, 
therefore, an alliance to confront the PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party] cannot be ruled out. Carles reaffirmed 
that his ticket is the best one to head such an alliance. 
Alvaro Alvarado filed this report: 
  [Carles] "Several political groups are currently holding 
discussions. The possibility exists. They are currently 
discussing that." 
  [Alvarado] Professor Carles does not support the proposal of 
seeking a presidential candidate from among the vice 
presidential candidates from the various civilist tickets after 
getting all of the civilist presidential candidates to agree to 
quit the race. 
  [Carles] "I do not foresee such a thing happening. We have 
the best ticket, whether you look at it on a person-to-person 
basis or collectively. We have the best government program. We 
are the most capable of executing our program and fulfilling it 
without poems, soap operas, and songs." 
  [Alvarado] Meanwhile, mayoral candidate Mayin Correa pointed 
out that should an alliance not be established among the 
political leaders, the people will rally behind Carles: 
  [Correa] "Seventy percent of Panamanians are civilist. We 
know Ruben Dario Carles. We know of his background, 
capabilities, and honesty. I guarantee that a majority of 
Panamanians, being aware of what they know about Carles, will 
vote for the best option -- Carles -- on Election Day." 
  [Alvarado] Carles made his statements during a march with 
Mayin Correa and supporters in the Bella Vista area. Carles and 
Correa talked to many Panamanians along the way. The march 
toured part of Via Espana and ended on Via Argentina, where a 
small rally was held.

<F P=106> ["Text" of communique issued by the Colombian Embassy in </F>
Washington on 21 April] 
  [Text] In response to a deposition made today to the 
Subcommittee for Terrorism, Narcotics, and International 
Operations of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Colombian 
Ambassador to Washington Gabriel Silva Lujan expressed his deep 
concern that these hearings have undermined the war against 
drugs. Gabriel Taboada, a drug trafficker sentenced to 12 years 
in prison in the United States, testified that drug cartels in 
Colombia have "infiltrated all levels of the government, from 
the Presidency on down." Taboada said only one of the 
candidates participating in the current electoral campaign is 
not corrupt. 
  Ambassador Silva said: "This convict's accusations are 
inadmissible and an insult to the families of thousands of brave 
Colombians who have lost their lives in this war against drugs. 
The mere use of this so-called witness, a man who has been in a 
U.S. prison for the past five years, is a clear shift from the 
Congress' process of surveillance and one that will hinder our 
capacity to understand the truth of the war against drugs. 
  "Apparently, the only first-hand knowledge this drug 
trafficker has dates back to the mid-eighties, and yet he is 
allowed to contest the integrity of a country that is recognized 
the world over as a leader in the struggle against drugs. 
Today, as on any other day, thousands of Colombian Government 
officials, judges, journalists, candidates, policemen, and 
soldiers are risking their lives. But this witness was 
encouraged to make false statements that question the integrity 
of our people and our political system," Ambassador Silva said. 
  "Colombia, the oldest democracy in Latin America, will 
neither remain indifferent nor allow these absurd accusations to 
go unanswered. Senator Kerry knew very well that these hearings 
were being held during our presidential campaign. During 
previous elections, three presidential candidates were 
assassinated. One of them, Luis Carlos Galan, was assassinated 
by hired assassins of Pablo Escobar's Medellin Cartel, precisely 
because Galan had the courage to publicly confront 
narcoterrorism. Authorizing a groundless deposition such as 
this during a critical election is not only irresponsible 
interference in the Colombian electoral process; it will also 
serve to erode the strong cooperation between the United States 
and Colombia essential to dismantling the drug cartels." 
  "There is undoubtedly corruption in Colombia, just as there 
is in the United States. We are struggling against the most 
powerful and merciless criminal organization in history. The 
achievements of President Cesar Gaviria's government in the 
struggle against corruption have no parallel. The forces of 
order and the judicial system have been completely reorganized 
in an attempt to fight corruption. The investigations of 
officials charged with corruption have been firm and yielded 
good results." 
  "One asks how Senator Kerry would react if the Colombian 
Congress were to conduct hearings on the big scandal this week 
in Massachusetts, where the mayor of Middlesex County has been 
charged with doing favors for and giving special treatment to 
important Mafia personalities in the area? Can you imagine the 
indignation of the people of Massachusetts if this scandal led 
to charges that the state government, from the governor on down, 
is corrupt? [no closing quotation mark as published] 
  The ambassador added: "Senator Kerry can be satisfied after 
these hearings because his so-called witness repeated some of 
the groundless accusations the senator made against Colombia in 
his recent article in THE WASHINGTON POST. This is a small 
personal victory compared to the huge damage this mistaken use 
of surveillance will do to the real war being waged in my 
country." 
  "A week ago Senator Kerry told Colombian reporters: `I 
believe the Colombian people have fought with extraordinary 
courage. There is no doubt in my mind about President Gaviria's 
and his government's courage and efforts. Many people are 
fighting without respite.' If we are to believe the senator, 
how could he allow Colombia's image to be so wronged through 
this distorted process? [no closing quotation mark as published]
