  [Text] Quito, 26 Apr (DPA) -- At least 40 public sector 
union organizations decided to go on a 48-hour strike on Tuesday 
to protest the privatization program of the Liberal 
administration headed by Sixto Duran-Ballen. The strike 
coincides with the closing stages of the campaign by provincial 
deputies, advisers, and councilmen seeking reelection in the 1 
May elections. 
  The unions expressed their opposition to the privatization 
program in general and in particular as it relates to so-called 
strategic sectors such as petroleum, electricity, and 
telecommunications. 
  Recent announcements related to electricity cuts and fuel 
interruptions have not yet materialized, but the government has 
announced through Carlos Larreategui, secretary general of the 
administration, that it could take a tough stance against the 
union leaders, warning that it could even put them on trial. 
  In the meantime, the Education Ministry suspended classes at 
all schools and universities throughout when teacher joined the 
48-hour strike. Indian groups also decided to support the unions 
and threatened to block all highways to keep "Ecuador from being 
auctioned off to foreign interests."

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by Cuban Ambassador to Uruguay Manuel Aguilera </F>
de la Paz] 
  [Text] The editorial published by this newspaper on 6 April 
entitled "The Cuban Foreign Minister's Surprising Remarks" 
includes the following: 
  "Havana has cunningly devised a well-orchestrated attempt to 
present the U.S. boycott as a `blockade,' an `embargo,' or a 
sort of `sanitary cordon' that is virtually driving Cuba to 
famine. It should be clearly asserted that this is not the case. 
The United States has placed Cuba under a trade boycott, thus 
severing all U.S. trade relations with this island. In the eyes 
of any stalwart supporter of Castro's regime, this ought to be 
simply a welcome gesture of consistency on the part of the 
United States." 
  This remark is really surprising, particularly considering 
that in 1992 and again in 1993 the UN General Assembly approved 
important resolutions on the "need to end the economic, 
commercial, and financial blockade imposed by the United States 
against Cuba," by an overwhelming majority that included 
Uruguay's vote. 
  The blockade also has been condemned by the Nonaligned 
Countries Movement, the Ibero-American summit meeting in Bahia, 
UNESCO, and many other international organizations and events. 
  Cuba has submitted numerous proofs of the extraterritorial 
nature of the blockade, that is, on the obstinate manner in 
which the United States violates international law and the 
freedom of trade it pretends to impose worldwide. 
  This evidence shows how successive U.S. administrations 
placed obstacles and tried to prevent other countries from 
trading or carrying out financial operations with the island. 
The United States used pressure and threats--such as the 
exclusion of those countries from U.S. trade and financing 
programs, the suspension of U.S. credits, the blockade of 
assistance by international financial organizations, and the 
prohibition to export and import products to and from the United 
States, etc.--to hinder trade with Cuba. 
  Today Cuba is introducing important economic changes and is 
opening its doors to foreign investors, but eight of every 10 
individuals interested in doing mutually profitable business 
with Cuban companies withdraw due to threats and pressures 
against them. 
  There are many other aberrant elements in the blockade, such 
as the U.S. prohibition to import goods containing even the most 
minimal quantity of Cuban components or raw materials, or the 
prohibition affecting companies of any country from exporting 
goods to Cuba containing U.S. components or raw materials. This 
is a particularly sensitive point because it includes medicine 
and food. 
  The United States also prevents the main international 
financial institutions--such as the IMF, the World Bank, and the 
Inter-American Development Bank--from granting loans and 
assistance to Cuba. 
  If this were not enough, when socialism collapsed in East 
Europe Cuba suddenly lost 85 percent of its economic and trade 
partners, but the United States strengthened its blockade and 
broadened the blockade's international application with the 
sadly known Torricelli Law forbidding U.S. subsidiaries around 
the world from trading with Cuba. The law also gives powers to 
the president to impose sanctions on any country giving 
assistance to Cuba and forbidding ships that trade with the 
island from entering U.S. ports. 
  These extraterritorial demands are so grotesque that the EC 
and Canada, among other countries, rejected them vigorously. 
  I did not want to refer to the blockade's effect on my 
people. It has caused us damage estimated at more than $40 
billion and provoked great scarcities and suffering, thus 
revealing its criminal, cruel, and inhuman nature. But what 
offends Cubans most is that it is unfair, illegal, immoral, and 
unjustifiable because it pursues the objective of isolating 
Cuba, obtaining its surrender by hunger, and imposing on her the 
political, social, and economic order that U.S. authorities 
consider most adequate and convenient to their interests.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Rafael Caldera from the Ayacucho Room </F>
at Miraflores Presidential Palace in Caracas; broadcast in 
progress--live relay] 
  [Text] ...the promulgation of this law [not further 
specified] fills the national government with great optimism. We 
hope it will be the same for the whole country. The country is 
aware of the difficult economic situation we are confronting. 
This economic situation demands immediate action to reduce the 
fiscal deficit. We are well aware of the fact a reasonable 
reduction of the fiscal deficit to manageable levels is 
unpostponable, even though this will entail a policy of 
austerity that will necessarily produce scarcity in many aspects 
and difficulties and differences for practically every sector of 
the country. All anti-inflation policies are unpopular. We know 
this, but we have no other choice but to confront this situation. 
  We have made an effort to reduce public spending. We had to 
make quick changes to a big and complex budget we did not draft. 
The reductions in public spending have resulted in the 
impossibility of immediately carrying out big works that are 
necessary and indispensable for the country's development. This 
law opens doors; it offers national and foreign investors the 
possibility of carrying out works the country needs. The 
experiences sister countries have had in this regard are very 
encouraging. Even though users must pay the costs of these 
works, it has been proven they do this willingly if they are 
given the facilities to attain their goals satisfactorily, 
saving them time, fuel, worry, and wear and tear of the 
instruments and vehicles that must be used. 
  Some of these works can be undertaken immediately in 
Venezuela. These works could be profitably attractive for 
investors. For example, completing the initial stretch of the 
Romulo Bethancourt Highway to Caucagua; the new bridge over the 
Orinoco River, plans for which were drafted a long time ago; the 
possibility of a freeway from Caracas to Los Teques, which is 
very necessary because of the heavy growth of the population; 
and other very necessary works that could be resolved through 
concession contracts. This could also be the case for the 
Caracas water supply, which is a priority and urgent need for 
the metropolitan area. 
  We believe the promulgation of this law is a message we are 
sending to national and foreign investors. We need them, and we 
are offering them the opportunity to carry out works that can be 
profitable for them and benefit our country. We plan to 
immediately appoint a very honest, very responsible, and very 
serious technical commission that will serve as an adviser and 
overseer of the terms of the offers that will be made to future 
concessionaires to carry out these works and to establish the 
order of priorities for the works that are going to be offered 
to the public. 
  We know, and the country knows, that fiscal readjustment 
policies, the new tax law, does not exclude the government's 
direction toward a medium and long-term policy. We aspire to a 
free and progressive economy capable of great efforts and great 
works for the good of the people. We are sure the private sector 
will respond to our call with the knowledge they will have 
protection, legal protection, and every protection necessary. 
The state knows its duty is to moderate and assist in those 
cases where its presence is necessary. The state must do this in 
a harmonious manner, without exaggerated orthodox positions in 
one way or another. The state must confront the country's 
situation, and according to the country's situation it must 
encourage the great potential that Venezuela has to advance. 
  The Council of Ministers today approved the creation of the 
National Mining Commission, because we are aware mines 
constitute an immediate and encouraging opportunity for the 
country. 
  We are decisively promoting tourism initiatives, and to this 
end we will continue to carry out necessary privatizations in 
the hotel industry and in all the areas to which investors can 
make considerable contributions so that tourism will, in effect, 
become an important national industry. 
  We are willing to provide every means of support and 
encouragement to those whose legitimate right it is to undertake 
those activities that are essential for the fulfillment of 
Venezuela's potential. 
  We are offering the country the law we enacted today as a 
sign of hope, as a reason for economic reactivation, and as an 
opportunity to unite the efforts of enterprising and trained 
individuals who are entirely capable of working under state 
guidance, guarantees and security. 
  We have been in need of this law for many years. A law was 
passed, but it could not be applied, because established [word 
indistinct] difficulties rendered its fulfillment impossible. In 
this case, as I said at the beginning, we are very optimistic. 
This law is a message we hope will receive an affirmative 
answer. We have presented it to the country as an opening of new 
opportunities and as an offer of new paths, which, we are 
certain, will lead us forward in the fulfillment of the goals of 
growth and prosperity for Venezuela.

<F P=106> [From the "National Newscast;" passages within quotation </F>
marks recorded] 
  [Text] During a seminar on civilian-military relations, 
Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo has said the government and 
the Army reached an agreement on the Code of Military 
Organization. Lacayo praised the agreement, describing it as 
another government achievement in its fourth year in office. 
  [Lacayo] "We are celebrating this fourth year of Violeta 
Chamorro's democratic government with this agreement, an 
agreement that opens the door to a Nicaragua with a national 
Army for the first time in its history, and closes the door on 
any attempt to seize power via weapons. Thus, we are 
celebrating the existence of a new Nicaragua." 
  Lacayo said the Military Code, which consists of 93 
articles, 
is the result of a consensus between President Chamorro and the 
top military command on how and on which date the new Army 
commander in chief will be appointed. 
  Lacayo mentioned the government's achievements: 
  [Lacayo] "Nicaragua is a territory free of armed political 
groups today." 
  He added the government has kept its promises as no other 
government has ever done in the country's history: 
  [Lacayo] "No one can doubt we have forever left behind the 
death of Nicaraguan brothers in the battlefields, the harsh 
press censorship, the jail terms for dissension, and the 
subsequent crooked deals that prompted the collapse of an 
economy that was in a regressive and mortal state." 
  Army Chief Humberto Ortega also spoke at the event. He 
insisted on referring to the past until he finally expressed his 
opinion about the Military Code: 
  [Ortega] "The law must serve to strengthen the process to 
professionalize the Army. It must not be the kind of law some 
people want: a law to dismantle the Army." 
  Ortega reiterated the Army does respect the state branches: 
  [Ortega] "The Army has never interfered in politics or in a 
single decision made by this government, a decisionmaking power 
it won in the elections."

  [Text] Managua, 26 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- General Humberto 
Ortega, chief of the Sandinist People's Army, EPS, will retire 
by 10 January 1995 at the latest, a source close to the 
Nicaraguan Presidency reported today. 
  The source stated that Ortega, who has held that position 
for 
the past 14 years, will undergo a "transition" period in the 
Armed Forces before his retirement. 
  Deputy Presidency Minister Tomas Delaney confirmed that 
Ortega's departure will be included in a provisional article of 
the Military Code agreed upon by the EPS and the Violeta 
Chamorro administration, a regulation that will replace the 
announced Military Organization Law. 
  A source close to the executive branch who asked to remain 
anonymous confirmed to NOTIMEX that Ortega will abandon his post 
"on 10 January 1995 at the latest," the date agreed upon by the 
military leadership and President Chamorro after nearly eight 
months of discussion. 
  By changing the draft bill into a Military Code, however, 
Ortega managed to "tie" the government's hands and give the 
legislative branch a "vote of confidence" as the legislature 
will be the only body empowered to introduce reforms, the source 
explained. 
  Joaquin Cuadra, EPS chief of staff of the Commander's 
Office, 
said the Code "will give stability and security to the Armed 
Forces because it cannot be reformed by the executive during the 
recess period of the National Assembly." 
  Under the Code, which will have constitutional status, "the 
military will not be subject to the political instability of the 
current or future administrations," according to political 
sources. 
  National Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman stated on 
Tuesday that he hopes the draft Code of Military Organization, 
Jurisdiction, and Military Social Security is sent this week to 
the deputies for discussion and approval. 
  The "final" version of the new military legislation "is 
complete but it is the president's prerogative to forward it to 
the legislature," Delaney remarked. 
  Ortega told the press this Monday that "there was a total 
consensus" on the Military Code initiative. "It will include 
everything, including the permanence of the Army chief," Gen. 
Ortega expressed. 
  The EPS chief admitted that "the art of negotiating is 
knowing when to yield," after saying days before that he would 
not abandon the Armed Forces under "pressure or at anybody's 
whim." 
  The new military legislation would end a prolonged conflict 
that began on 2 September of last year, when Chamorro took the 
military leadership by surprise by announcing that Ortega would 
retire in 1994. 
  After the announcement, Gen. Ortega and his brother, former 
President Daniel Ortega (1985-1990), had a verbal confrontation 
with Chamorro.

<F P=106> [From the "Trench" newscast] </F>
  [Text] At a seminar hosted by the Institute for Democracy 
and the Development of Latin America, General Humberto Ortega 
said the Army is a stabilizing factor in Nicaragua. He added 
that those who favor a reduction in the military budget, as well 
as those who favor the elimination of the Army, are seeking 
chaos and war in the country. 
  During a seminar at the Olof Palme Convention Center to 
review civilian-military relations, an event that is continuing 
today, Gen. Ortega, in one of his usual abrupt remarks, said the 
EPS [Sandinist People's Army] is a stabilizing factor in 
Nicaragua. Without the EPS, he added, there would be chaos and 
war in the country. He was criticizing those who favor a 
reduction in the Army's budget. 
  In his statements, one can see Ortega's zeal to control 
power 
in a more complete and hegemonic way. Meanwhile, Dr. Lino 
Hernandez of the Permanent Commission for the Defense of Human 
Rights said what is happening in Haiti could happen here. 
  [Begin recording] [Hernandez] Ortega noted that those 
seeking 
to alter the current state of the Army or the way the it is 
organized right now are attacking the country. In other words, 
he is saying, there can be no changes here unless he or the 
military leaders accept them. I expected a different position 
from him at this seminar, because there are many international 
personalities taking part in it. These people expect the 
military to be remain subordinate to civilian authorities. In 
turn, we expected Gen. Ortega to express a different position, 
but he took the opportunity to be very blunt. He expressed the 
Army's view, saying that the Army here cannot be altered. In 
fact, he even threatened an economist clearly referring to him. 
He said: There is an economist who is saying that the Army's 
budget must be reduced. Well, this is a direct threat. Ortega 
is telling him that he must be quiet. 
  Ortega's position shows there is a long way to go in this 
country to attain what the Nicaraguan people want, which is a de 
jure state -- a system that will include the subordination of 
the military to civilian authorities. 
  [Reporter] It seems that he wants to remain in the Army 
forever, giving up the possibility of becoming a presidential 
candidate. 
  [Hernandez] When these politicians try to wrap themselves in 
power -- and here, Ortega speaks like a true politician -- they 
become very dangerous. We cannot stop thinking or predicting 
that one day Gen. Ortega might decide to seize control, and who 
is going to tell him no at a time when foreign intervention is 
practically nonexistent? 
  Aristide was ousted in Haiti. The U.S. Government says it is 
against it, and yet the situation continues. It has been more 
than two years since the Haitian coup. 
  Unfortunately, we feel there is an attempt to control power 
in an increasingly hegemonic and complete way, and we must be 
alert to this. We must prevent men like Generals Ortega and 
Somoza from trying to control all power in the country. [end

<F P=106> ["Note" from President Violeta Chamorro to National Assembly </F>
President Luis Humberto Guzman in Managua on 18 April] 
  [Text] No. P-2731-79-4-94 
  Managua, 18 April 1994 
  Dr. Luis Humberto Guzman, president of the National Assembly 
  Honorable Mr. President: 
  This note is in reference to Draft Law No. 174 entitled 
"Judicial Action and Sentence Execution Suspension Law for 
Trials Stemming From Property Restitution, Possession, 
Questionable Bail, and Annulment." The National Assembly 
approved the draft on 28 March 1994 and forwarded it to me on 
that date for sanctioning, promulgation, and publication. 
  Allow me to state that I have carefully studied the 
aforementioned Draft Law No. 174 and cannot help but express my 
concern over the consequences the bill could have if put into 
effect, and the problems that enforcing its provisions may 
entail. It is my opinion that in drafting this law, the National 
Assembly is overstepping the bounds of the judicial branch's 
jurisdiction. 
  I do not agree with any form of abuse. I do not agree with 
those who seek to evict legitimate owners and occupants from 
their homes and lands. I do not agree with those who have 
illegally occupied the property of others. 
  I have respected and enforced Laws 85 and 86, because they 
are laws that were already in effect when I assumed my place as 
president of the Republic. The Office for Territorial 
Organization was create specifically to detect abuses that could 
have been committed under the aforementioned laws, while 
respecting the rights of legitimate beneficiaries. 
  I cannot sanction or promulgate Law No. 174 at this time, 
however. While seeking to correct such abuses, it is committing 
other more serious abuses, such as denying the people the right 
to appeal to the courts to demand justice whenever they feel 
their rights have been violated. 
  In addition to these general considerations, I believe it is 
important to underscore the following specific issues: 
  1. Draft Law No. 174, in interfering with the judicial 
branch's sphere of jurisdiction, would violate the 
constitutional principle stated in Article [numeral indistinct] 
of the Constitution, which sets forth the independence and 
concerted coordination among the branches of state. 
2. The law creates a conflict with the Constitution when 
it suspends the execution of court sentences. According to 
Article 167 of the Constitution, execution of court rulings and 
resolutions is mandatory for the nation's authorities. 
3. Sentences that have been carried out, whether handed 
down by the Supreme Court of Justice, appeals courts, or lower 
courts, are binding for all parties. This draft law would 
entail retroactive effects on individual or collective rights, 
because the nation's courts had previously recognized such 
rights in favor of a specific party or parties. In so doing, 
the law would violate Article 98 of the Constitution, which 
states that the law shall not have retroactive effects, except 
in criminal cases when such effects would favor a convicted 
individual. 
4. According to Article 52 of the Constitution, citizens 
have the right to petition the branches of state, which are 
obliged to promptly resolve such petitions in accordance with 
the timeframes established by law. This draft law would impede 
the judicial branch from complying with its constitutional duty 
of resolving the demands and petitions brought before it. It is 
also an affront to the basic right to demand justice and to 
appear before the nation's courts to demand recognition and 
protection of the rights the Constitution itself provides. 
5. By threatening the judges and courts (including the 
Supreme Court of Justice) by saying they may be committing a 
crime in handing down their decisions in this regard, the draft 
law violates Article 165 of the Constitution, which guarantees 
the independence of judges and magistrates in the administration 
of justice. 
6. The right to private property is established in the 
Constitution. One of the forms of exercising this right is 
turning to the courts for protection whenever this right is 
threatened or violated. To deny a legitimate proprietor this 
possibility violates his right to private property. In 
addition, this action breaches the principle of equality under 
the law, as stated in Article 27 of the Constitution. 
  7. The fact that some judges commit abuses in their 
positions is no justification for the legislative branch to 
attempt to paralyze an important part of judicial activity. The 
judicial system itself has its own internal resources and 
mechanisms to correct such abuses. For this reason, this bill 
goes against Article 129 of the Constitution that establishes 
the independence of government branches. 
8. Furthermore, this bill has incongruities. It 
establishes that the judges will not process suits or continue 
trials when the person being sued shows the purchase of property 
or the assignment of his right to possession. How can the 
person being sued show his right if the suit is not processed? 
9. It also presents technical problems by establishing 
new specific criminal conduct and penalties without reforming 
the Criminal Code. 
You will understand, Mr. President, that the 
specifications of this law would cause serious problems in the 
administration of justice. As I have stated on previous 
occasions, the issuance of laws, which must not only be just but 
also feasible, and which must conform to the Constitution, is a 
responsibility shared by the honorable assembly that discusses 
and approves a bill and by the president of the Republic who 
sanctions it. 
  For the reasons I have expounded, I feel it is my duty to 
refrain from sanctioning Draft Law No. 174, and for the sake of 
the understanding that must exist and that we are promoting 
between the government branches, I have decided not to make use 
of the power afforded to me in Article 142 of the Constitution 
to veto the bill, which I am sending you together with this note. 
  I ask you, Mr. President of the National Assembly, to 
communicate these reasons to the representatives and to take the 
liberty of suggesting a reconsideration of this law, inviting 
you to consult with the Supreme Court before deciding to send it 
to be published. 
  With cordial regards to you and the honorable 
representatives, I remain very truly yours, 
  [signed] Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, president of the 
Republic of Nicaragua

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech by President Violeta Chamorro on the </F>
fourth anniversary of her inauguration in Managua on 25 April -- 
read by announcer] 
  [Text] Despite our limited resources, we have implemented 
many projects that have allowed us to consolidate peace and set 
the foundations for the economic and social reactivation we are 
truly and firmly promoting. Within this reactivation program 
and at a cost of 70 million cordobas, this morning I inaugurated 
an important public works project, which is being conducted with 
assistance from the Central American Economic Integration Bank 
and with funds from my government, and which is allowing us to 
restore 57 km of roadway from Nejapa to Istapa and to build 13 
bridges. 
  Today, a loan for 145 million cordobas to be used in the 
cattle sector was signed with the Central American Economic 
Integration Bank in my presence. It will be used to help our 
cattle breeders rejuvenate their farms and improve cattle 
production. We also signed, with the same bank, another loan 
for 24 million cordobas to be assigned to the program that is to 
revitalize small- and medium-sized industries. This is a very 
important project for me because I want to give my support to 
the women who run those small firms and are very good 
administrators. 
  Today, in celebrating the fourth anniversary of my 
inauguration as president of all Nicaraguans, I have come to 
this palace, which is located in front of our dear Republic 
Plaza, the ruins of our old cathedral, and in front of Managua 
Lake, to confirm that progress and production financing must go 
hand-in-hand with culture, which is one of the main objectives 
of my government program. 
  Four years ago, I made a commitment to further peace, 
freedom, and economic and social progress. I also made a 
commitment to improve the Nicaraguan people's cultural 
development. In keeping with the goals of our cultural policy, 
we are celebrating this special day by announcing the initiation 
of the repair of the National Palace, which from now on will be 
called the National Palace of Culture. It is a genuine example 
of our arts and handicrafts, of our history and our struggles, 
and it is a place where our musicians, poets, painters, and 
sculptors can express themselves with entire freedom. I am 
convinced that actions that support culture will make our 
progress and development comprehensive. The repair of this 
palace is part of the program to reconstruct the center of 
Managua. We have managed to restore the ruins of the Grand 
Hotel and have converted it into the Managua Cultural Center. 
We are also going to rescue the old cathedral as part of this 
program. 
  I want to take advantage of this opportunity to show my 
appreciation for the great help we have received from the 
government and people of Japan, as well as from the United 
National Development Program. They have helped us carry out 
this important program. 
  All of you, my dear Nicaraguans, should help my government 
in 
its endeavors to continue to build, strengthen, and work in 
order that together we can make Nicaragua an example of 
democracy, peace, and progress for all its children. With the 
help of God and the efforts of all, we will make this a reality. 
Thank you.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Casado: "A Distorted Reality"] </F>
  [Text] Latin American governments have failed in a new 
joint attempt to have the EU make a commitment to expand trade 
between Latin America and Europe and to guarantee a growing 
inflow of European investments in Latin America. 
  This failure became clear at the conclusion of the fourth 
meeting of European and Latin American foreign ministers held 
this week in Sao Paulo. 
  This may have been a test for the new world economic order 
outlined two weeks ago in Marrakech, Morocco -- after eight 
years of negotiations -- through a new global agreement on 
tariffs and the creation of a powerful institution called the 
World Trade Organization. 
  Latin American diplomats came out of the Sao Paulo meeting 
less optimistic than before. 
  It became clear to them, for instance, that trade between 
the 
EU and Latin America is bound to become increasingly dependent 
on each government's interpretation of the GATT agreements. 
  It has resulted in greater uncertainty about the future of 
Latin American trade with Europe, which is its main trading 
partner after the United States. European imports of Latin 
American products have dropped nearly 40 percent since 1965 as 
protectionism continues to progress. 
  Under Brazil's guidance, Latin American governments found 
out 
at the Sao Paulo meeting that the only thing they could do was 
lodge another protest against the growing social, environmental, 
and labor conditions some European countries are beginning to 
impose on purchases of Latin American products. 
  The rich countries are in fact reaffirming their 
protectionist pressures, which are decisively contributing to 
undoing the optimistic scenario (for the poor) that was built 
around the new GATT agreement. 
  In theory, the new GATT agreement is supposed to increase 
world trade by $270 billion annually from 1995 to 2005 and bring 
substantial benefits to Latin American countries, especially to 
Brazil. Reality is, however, distorting these expectations. 
  Another hope was lost this week in Sao Paulo; that is, it 
would not be feasible in the short term for Latin American 
governments to exact commitments and broad guarantees from 
Europe that the inflow of investments in the region will 
increase. 
  The idea of making Latin America gradually become a priority 
on the agenda of EU public investment policies was stimulated by 
the inflow of capital registered last year, when one-third of 
Europe's overall investments was made in the region. 
  The Latin American diplomatic offensive in Sao Paulo was 
designed to obtain "major commitments" from the Europeans that 
they would increase their investments in the region in the short 
term and thus prevent the growing interest of investors in and 
the inflow of capital toward Africa, Asia, and East Europe. The 
Latin Americans have lost once again. They have made no major 
achievements. 
  It is a crucial question to determine which direction the 
expansion of capitalism will take in the next few decades within 
the framework of a globalized economy. 
  Asia remains a priority. Despite its tribal conflicts, 
Africa continues to be attractive because it remains highly 
profitable. It is not by mere coincidence that 90 South African 
companies are trading their stocks in London's stock exchange, 
23 of them are trading in Paris, 16 of them are trading in 
Brussels, 12 in Frankfurt, and nine in Switzerland. 
  East Europe is the area where the second stage of the EU's 
integration will take place. 
  This does not mean that things will continue to be as they 
are now. 
  It will be incumbent upon the skill of the Latin American 
governments to bring about changes in their relations with the 
EU. They have a promising market and can count on Europe's 
competitor -- the United States -- which is a potential ally in 
trade disputes with the European bloc. 
  This poses a challenge to the political ability of foreign 
ministries such as that of Brazil.

<F P=106> ["Text" of the Sao Paulo Declaration issued at the end of </F>
the Rio Group-EU meeting in Sao Paulo on 22 April and released 
by the Brazilian Foreign Ministry on the same day] 
  [Text] The Fourth Institutional Meeting of Rio Group and EU 
Ministers took place in Sao Paulo on 22 and 23 April 1994, in 
compliance with the Declaration of Rome dated 20 December 1990. 
  The foreign relations ministers of the Rio Group and the EU 
constructively and openly reviewed the issues that interest them 
most. 
  The ministers confirmed that the two regions share common 
cultural traits and political and socioeconomic values and 
principles, and agreed on the steps they will take to attain 
joint objectives and strengthen mutual relations. 
  The ministers underscored the scope and depth that the 
dialogue between the two regions attained during the past year, 
especially at the Copenhagen meeting and at the 48th UN General 
Assembly meeting. 
  Within this framework the ministers approved the following 
Declaration of Sao Paulo: 
<H5>  Common Principles and Values </H5>
  A. The ministers reasserted their governments' commitment to 
representative democracy and to the state of law, and their firm 
decision to secure full respect for universal human rights and 
basic liberties, in keeping with the provisions of international 
agreements on human rights. They thus rejected any attempts to 
disrupt the democratic and constitutional order and proposed to 
coordinate efforts aimed at the strengthening of democracy, 
which implies especially the subordination of all sectors to 
legally established civilian authority. 
  B. In keeping with the principles set forth in the 
Declaration and Program for Action of the World Conference on 
Human Rights held in Vienna in 1993, the minister agreed that 
the right to development is part of basic human rights, the 
human being is the central subject of development, and the lack 
of development cannot be used as an excuse to justify disrespect 
for internationally acknowledged human rights. 
  The ministers also recognized that democracy, respect for 
human rights, and development are closely intertwined, and that 
they all play an equally important role in the strengthening of 
international cooperation and trust. 
  C. The ministers agreed that sustainable development, 
protection of the environment and sustainable exploitation of 
natural resources, economic growth, creation of productive jobs, 
and a fairer income distribution will encourage full respect for 
the principles set forth in this declaration and its effective 
implementation. 
  D. The ministers pledged to help overcome the differences in 
the level of social and economic development among the nations, 
and agreed to protect social and labor rights in line with the 
principles and provisions of the various International Labor 
Organization conventions. 
  E. The ministers state that the strengthening of the norms, 
regulations, and institutions governing the Multilateral Trade 
System, as well as the removal of stumbling blocks to trade and 
the rejection of arbitrary unilateral actions, are at the center 
of international trade in accordance with the GATT principles. 
  F. The ministers condemn without reservation every form of 
racism and xenophobia. 
  G. The ministers reaffirm the key role played by regional 
integration in terms of the objective to promote political and 
socioeconomic cohesion. This objective also entails the 
involvement of all sectors of society in the development process 
of each country, with a view to making it more competitive on 
the international economic market. 
  H. The ministers condemn without reservations and labeled as 
an unjustifiable crime all kinds of terrorist actions wherever 
they are committed by anyone and for whatever reason, because 
they endanger and eliminate human lives, offend the dignity of 
the human being, and attack democracy and the state of law. 
  I. The ministers condemn the production of, trafficking in, 
and unlawful consumption of drugs, as well as the laundering of 
the profits generated by these activities. 
  J. The ministers agree in stating that cooperation between 
the two regions is based on principles of solidarity that are 
translated into support for social and regional development, 
including objectives such as fighting poverty and protecting 
less favored segments of the population, the promotion of 
effective democratic systems, and complementary actions in 
economic, trade, industrial, scientific, and technological areas 
that would be mutually beneficial. 
  In accordance with these common principles and values, the 
ministers agree in stating that the two regions should 
strengthen their relations in the future, identifying the 
appropriate structures for dialogue and for cooperation as well 
as new instruments that would enrich the current framework of 
their relations and mutual interest. 
  To ensure a greater impact and coherence, the ministers 
agree 
on the need to develop future actions within the framework of a 
medium- and long-term strategy. To this end, they commit 
themselves to promoting a broad analysis to define the 
objectives and guidelines of this strategy. 
<H5>  Joint Measures </H5>
  Based on the above reasons, the ministers reached the 
following agreements: 
  I. Political Aspects of the United Nations 
  1. The ministers agree on furthering the dialogue 
undertaken within the framework of the United Nations. The 
following may be included among the topics of this dialogue: 
  A. The initiative concerning the "Agenda for Development" 
and 
the "Agenda for Peace"; 
  B. The issue of the UN reform and of improving its method of 
work; 
  C. The implementation of accords reached during the UN 
Conference on Environment and Development and answers to 
questions currently under discussion at the appropriate 
international forums, particularly regarding sustainable 
development, technology transfer, and financial resources; 
  D. The Third International Conference on People and 
Development (Cairo 1994) on population policies, sustainable 
development, and strengthening of international cooperation; 
  E. The "Beijing International Conference (1005) on Women. 
Action for Equality, Development, and Peace" to emphasize at 
multilateral forums, and throughout the entire preparatory 
process, the importance of international cooperation for a 
swifter implementation of the Nairobi strategies before the end 
of this decade; 
  F. The decision to give priority to the implementation of 
national programs seeking to protect children, particularly 
homeless and abandoned children, under all circumstances and in 
all regions of the world, as established in the UN Convention on 
Children's Rights; 
  G. Ways to strengthen the UN role as protector and promoter 
of all human rights by ensuring overall support for the high 
commissioner for human rights, and fighting prejudice and 
discrimination based on race, sex, language, religion, or any 
other issue. This must be done in accordance with the 
international instruments currently in force, including by 
supporting national projects that strengthen the institutions of 
the state of law; 
  H. The terms of the UN proposal, International Decade of the 
Indigenous Peoples, which protect the rights of the indigenous 
communities and their cultural inheritance. 
<H5>  Social Development </H5>
  2. The ministers commit themselves to promoting the 
objectives proposed for the International Summit on Social 
Development (Copenhagen, 1995), particularly regarding the 
reduction of poverty, social integration, and an increase in 
productive jobs. 
<H5>  Ibero-American Cooperation </H5>
  3. The ministers acknowledge the importance of the 
Ibero-American Conference, which will hold its fourth summit of 
chiefs of state and government in Cartagenas de Indias, 
Colombia, on 14 and 15 June. 
<H5>  Fight Against Racism and Xenophobia </H5>
  4. The ministers agree to do their utmost to fight the signs 
of racism and xenophobia -- such as, for example, against 
migrant workers and their families -- particularly through 
implementation of severe laws and the promotion of intensive 
educational campaigns. 
<H5>  Terrorism </H5>
  5. The ministers agree to intensify cooperation and reach 
closer coordination to adopt concrete measures aimed at 
eliminating terrorism. 
<H5>  Drugs </H5>
  6. The ministers commit themselves to implementing overall 
solutions to the drug problem, including fighting drug 
production, distribution, and illegal consumption, as well as 
money laundering. They also commit themselves to adopting 
measures preventing smuggling of chemicals and precursors that 
can be used in drug production, and to creating alternative 
sources of income for the rural producers affected by these 
measures. The ministers also admit the need to promote 
additional measures to reinforce national programs preventing 
drug abuse and promoting rehabilitation. 
<H5>  Disarmament and Nonproliferation </H5>
  In the field of disarmament and nonproliferation of weapons, 
the ministers agree: 
  A. To immediately urge all countries to renew their 
commitment to the nonproliferation of weapons of massive 
destruction and their launching means in all their aspects. 
Within this context the EU ministers welcomed the intention 
recently expressed in Latin America to join the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT; 
  B. To defend the preparation of a Nuclear Tests Prohibition 
Treaty that will be broad, multilateral, and allow effective 
controls; 
  C. To stress the recent progress attained in the 
consolidation of provisions tending to totally prohibit nuclear 
weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, as established by 
the Tlatelolco Treaty; 
  D. To recommend the signature and ratification of the 
Convention on Prohibition of Development, Production, 
Accumulation, and Use of Chemical Weapons and their Destruction; 
  E. To jointly work to strengthen the Convention on 
Biological 
Weapons through the adoption of appropriate measures; 
  F. To cooperate in favor of openness in the international 
transfer of weapons and to participate in the UN Conventional 
Weapons Registry; 
  G. To express their interest in initiating a dialogue on 
matters related to trust-promoting measures. 
  II. Economy and Cooperation Aspects 
  8. The ministers agree on the advisability of carrying out 
an 
additional high-level meeting between the Rio Group and the EU 
on economic and trade matters before the Fifth Institutionalized 
Ministerial Meeting is held. The ministers stress that this 
specialized forum for permanent talks has proven to be very 
useful in exchanging points of views on current events and 
subjects of common interest, such as: 
  A. To study the effects of the Single European Market 
[Mercado Unico Europeu], the eventual extension of the EU and 
other contractual developments of the EU, as well as the Latin 
American regional integration programs and free trade zones. 
  B. To analyze the effects of the trade measures adopted by 
the two regions with the purpose of making joint efforts to 
promote trade. 
  9. The Rio Group ministers reject the unilateral imposition 
of political, economic, social, or environmental conditions on 
access to markets within the framework of international trade 
relations. 
  10. The ministers stress the importance of the trade 
preferences granted by the EU to the Rio Group countries. 
  The ministers of the Rio Group express their conviction that 
the reform of the Generalized System of Preferences [GSP] should 
maintain and increase its benefits for the Latin American 
countries without any kind of conditions or discriminations 
based on their social economic development, and it must also 
extend its coverage, further deregulate trade, establish rules 
of origin with the purpose of promoting trade, and adopt region 
cumulative laws for all the Latin American countries. 
  The EU ministers hereby take into consideration the terms 
expressed in this declaration, and express their willingness to 
examine them. They recall that the real purpose of the GSP has 
been and continues to be the promotion and diversification of 
the economies of the developing countries with the purpose of a 
more effective integration of the international economy. At the 
same time the GSP constitutes on its own an autonomous 
instrument subject to adjustment. 
  11. The ministers promise to adopt the necessary measures 
to quickly implement the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round 
of GATT talks. 
  The ministers agree to ensure that the World Trade 
Organization will bring more openness and legal efficiency to 
trade norms, including the controversy-solving procedures. 
  The ministers agree on the usefulness of carrying out a 
joint 
study of the opportunities that will be created following the 
agreements reached in the Uruguay Round for the benefit of all 
economic agents. 
  12. The ministers also agree on the significance of the UN 
Conference on Multizone Fish Species and Highly Migratory Fish 
Species located both inside and outside the exclusive economic 
zones. 
  13. The ministers promise to continue to support the 
different efforts to attain regional integration and 
cooperation, aimed at the gradual and progressive formation of a 
common Latin American market within a context of openness and 
dynamic interaction in the international economy. 
  14. The ministers promise to encourage initiatives that will 
increase investments between the two regions. Taking into 
account the current dynamics of the flow of investments of the 
private sectors of the two regions, the ministers agree to 
encourage the signature of additional bilateral agreements 
between countries of the Rio Group and the EU to promote and 
protect investments and to avoid double taxation, and to adopt 
measures to reinforce the protection of intellectual property 
rights. 
  15. With the same purpose, the ministers recognize the 
importance for the European Investment Bank to play a more 
active role in Latin America. The ministers favor greater 
cooperation between the European Investment Bank and other 
financial institutions, especially with the Inter-American 
Development Bank [IDB] with the purpose of possibly cofinancing 
regional projects. 
  16. The ministers point out the importance of the recent 
decision of global recapitalization of the IDB and of increasing 
the stock participation of the EU members, as well as 
reinforcing the Special Operations Fund. 
  17. The ministers acknowledge the importance and the great 
level of cooperation there is between the two regions, and agree 
to make an effort to attain a genuine partnership in the 
economic, trade, industrial, scientific, and technological 
fields for the benefit of the two regions. 
  With this purpose, the ministers mainly stress: 
  A. The intensification of cooperation activities at 
regional, 
subregional, and bilateral levels; 
  B. The consolidation of the current activities of the 
training programs, the fast implementation of the "FORCE-RIO" 
program and the possibility of broadening this kind of 
cooperation; 
  C. The future cooperation in the scientific and 
technological 
fields to allow the participation of the member countries of the 
Rio Group in the Fourth Program-Chart [Programa-Quadro] of 
Science and Technology; 
  D. The fast implementation of the AL-INVEST [expansion 
unknown] program and the expeditious implementation of measures 
under the ECIP [expansion unknown] program; 
  E) The importance of the quick implementation of the 
Inter-University Cooperation Program (ALFA) so as to intensify, 
develop, and expand ties between the academic and scientific 
communities of the two regions. 
  18. The ministers have decided to meet next year in France, 
in accordance with the rotation rules. 
  19. The participants in the Sao Paulo Conference express 
their deep thanks to the government of Brazil for its 
hospitality and for the excellent organization that has made 
possible the success of this conference. They likewise thank 
the Brazilian people for the warm welcome they have given to the 
delegations.

<F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras] </F>
  [Text] Cuban emigres who have just returned to Miami from 
Havana after attending the Nation and the Emigre Community 
conference are now victims of death threats and all types of 
pressures by the exile industry, who have made the anti-Cuban 
policy a lucrative business with a quasi-Mafioso structure. In 
one Florida county, the police had to search the home of one of 
those people who had received repeated death threats, because of 
the possibility of criminal activity. 
  Why have these criminal group leaders assumed such an 
aggressive attitude? Why do they violate U.S. laws and try to 
revamp them in Miami and use forms of extortion like those used 
by the Chicago Mafia during the 1930's? The answer is very 
simple: Repeated myths and lies are being weakened in a large 
sector of the emigre community, which is not beneficial to the 
Mafia heads, from the financial standpoint, or to the political 
tyranny exercised by personalities from the U.S. business and 
political sector. 
  This cannot be interpreted to mean that the Cuban emigre 
community in Miami is undergoing a radical change in its 
political and ideological views. That was clear at the meeting 
here in Havana. To put it plainly, the sector of Cuban 
emigration to which I am referring is that group of persons who 
are the victims of the aggression. It is they who are making 
another evaluation of the Cuban reality -- their own evaluation, 
within their own political and ideological views -- and that 
does not fit well with the totalitarian and strong-arm 
[matonezca] version of the traffickers in hatred and anti-Cuban 
sentiments. 
  It is curious, but not coincidental, how in this crusade of 
deeply rooted antagonism the most vile figures gang up with 
those who pose as intellectuals in an attempt to dominate other 
sectors of the emigre community. I mention no names, but 
everyone knows whom I refer to. I am talking about those who 
organize anti-Cuban congresses throughout the world, visit 
governments, travel nonstop, all without revealing who is 
financing their incessant movement.

  [Text] On 28 April, Zambian President Federick Chiluba 
visited the Mario Munoz Sugar Mill Complex in Los Arabos 
Municipality, Matanzas, where he was greeted by workers and 
officials. President Chiluba was accompanied by Yadira Garcia, 
Politburo member and first secretary of the Communist Party of 
Cuba in Matanzas. President Chiluba was greeted by Osvaldo 
Gutierrez, president of the provincial People's Government. 
Gutierrez pointed out in his welcoming address that the sugar 
industry is experiencing slight growth in Matanzas, adding that 
the 1994 citrus harvest is estimated at 250,000 tons. 
  President Chiluba, who showed interest in diverse aspects of 
production at the mill, concluded his trip with a visit to the 
mill's museum where he was given a little sack of sugar produced 
at the mill.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Moments before he concluded his 
visit to the Mario Munoz complex, Zambian President Chiluba made 
statements for this newscast: 
  [Begin Chiluba recording, in English with passage-by-passage 
translation into Spanish] I am extremely impressed, and there is 
a lot we can learn from the great people of Cuba, the spirit of 
self-reliance that ensures the country's development and 
readiness on the basis of the commitment and willingness of its 
people. 
  The world economy is not always favorable. [passage 
indistinct] at times is hard to obtain. Therefore, the spirit of 
depending on ourselves, our own efforts, our own materials, our 
own resources -- human, material, and financial -- is the real 
background and foundation to any successful development activity. 
  So this is the spirit from which we have to borrow here. We 
would also like to strengthen and encourage existing relations 
and areas of cooperation. We came here to borrow quite a lot of 
ideas. You have been successful in many fields, notwithstanding, 
of course, the fact that you are going through a very special 
period. This, however, further strengthens the spirit of the 
Revolution. 
  Thus, forward we shall go. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Juan Buria] </F>
  [Text] Many economists have pointed out that before 1959 
Cuba had a strong economic dependency on the United States. 
Recently Cuba also had strong ties with countries of the 
socialist bloc, ties which were abruptly broken. That, together 
with the U.S. blockade, brought our country to the situation of 
the special period. 
  Nevertheless, today, in the midst of these difficulties, 
Cuba 
is making great efforts to diversify its commercial ties with 
the world. In this connection, just yesterday, British 
Ambassador Leycester Coltman announced the possibility that 
another British firm may come to Cuba to work in oil 
exploration. At this moment, important firms from France, Great 
Britain, Canada, and Sweden are working in the oil exploration 
sphere in Cuba. It is a process whereby we are redirecting and 
diversifying our trade with the whole world. 
  In Great Britain's case, Ambassador Coltman pointed out 
that, 
years ago, Cuba's exports were up to $50 million. In 1992, that 
figure dwindled to $43 million and in 1993 to $21 million. 
However, Ambassador Coltman noted that the first quarter of 1994 
marked a certain recovery. In other words, it is not only in the 
[word indistinct], but other activities as well. 
  Another thing I wanted to point out was about trade with 
Latin America. Economist Osvaldo Martinez, president of the 
Commission on Economic Affairs of the National Assembly of the 
People's Government, recently said that in 1990, 83 percent of 
our exports and 87 percent of our imports were concentrated in 
Europe. Back then, Latin America represented only 7 percent of 
exports and 7 percent of imports. In 1993, our exports to Latin 
America grew from 7 to 14 percent, and our imports from 7 to 47 
percent. 
  This is additional proof, along with Ambassador Coltman's 
statements and other elements mentioned by the press and our 
leaders, that Cuba is making efforts, in midst of its economic 
difficulties, to diversify its ties with the entire world.

  [Text] The possibilities in Cuba for expanding production 
of high-quality lubricants under the Castrol name are on their 
way to becoming a reality, according to Castrol executives 
visiting Cuba. The company, Castrol-Cuba, today introduced two 
guests of honor: Jim Alexander, director of the main office in 
London; and Michael Viejo, financial manager of (Abeille-Life), 
a branch of Castrol- Burmah. Both executives expounded on 
prospects for producing greater amounts of lubricants under the 
Castrol name. 
  Mr. Alexander has met, these past few days, with various 
representatives of Cuban industry and government, and although 
there were no specific contracts, there is agreement regarding 
expansion of the relations that Castrol has maintained with Cuba 
for over 30 years and that reached a zenith two years ago when 
Cuba and Castrol polled their capital and formed the joint 
enterprise [empresa mixta] Castrol-Cuba S.A. 
  [Begin Jim Alexander recording, in English, with 
superimposed 
translation into Spanish] I think that through further joint 
efforts, we will be able to ensure that there will be many more 
advances, greater development, in Cuban industry. [end recording] 
  Jim Alexander's visit shows the commitment of the firm 
toward 
its company in Havana, which means that the power of the world's 
most important lubricant company is at Cuba's service. 
  Mr. Viejo, who is visiting to participate in the Isla chess 
tournament, sponsored by Castrol-Cuba, which is under way here, 
is taking advantage of the visit to learn about the banking 
world, oil, industry, and insurance. This executive is confident 
that he will be able to support projects and, in short, expand 
Castrol-Cuba's relations.

  [Text] The Territorial Station for Agricultural Research 
[estacion territorial de investigaciones agropecuarias] in 
Holguin has been chosen to develop an intergovernmental 
cooperation project between Cuba and France which will help 
implement the results of science and technology in our current 
agricultural production conditions. 
  Technology has been used in other Latin American countries, 
but only with peasant owners of small farms. In Cuba, with an 
integral production system, it will be easier to evaluate 
production and to make it more efficient from the economic point 
of the companies, of the Basic Cooperative Production Units, and 
of credits and services. 
  The French Government will finance the project and already 
has assigned more than $250,000, which will be invested in 
equipment, fuel, transport, and other material resources.

<F P=106> [Report by Matanzas Province correspondent Candido Dominguez </F>
-- live or recorded] 
  [Text] Approximately 70,000 people here will participate in 
the parade commemorating international workers day, which will 
take place next Saturday [30 April] at 0900 on the Matanzas Bay 
viaduct. The spaciousness of this new avenue that skirts the 
bay, along with the care with which the preparations are being 
made, portend a special splendor to this massive gesture, 
despite the fact that the inevitable austerity of the current 
moment prevents our using certain equipment and other material 
resources. 
  Yadira Garcia, a member of the Politburo and first secretary 
of the Communist Party of Cuba in Matanzas, said that the people 
of Matanzas have the special responsibility this year of 
expressing the joy, militancy, and steadfastness not only of the 
people of the province, but of all the people throughout the 
nation. Making the closing speech today [date not specified] at 
a meeting to review preparations for the 1 May activity, Garcia 
recalled that this year there will be parades only in Matanzas 
and Pinar del Rio. She expressed her confidence that the parade 
to be held in the City of Matanzas will be a success, and 
announced that over 100 foreign guests will attend. 
  This meeting, held at the Atenas movie theater, was attended 
by administrative and union representatives from all sectors, 
the UJC [Union of Young Communists], and the mass organizations, 
and was characterized by great enthusiasm, expressed in 
exchanges of emulative challenges between unions.

<F P=106> [Report by Pedro Garcia] </F>
  [Text] In the current situation of power generation, 
efficiency in maintaining thermoelectric plants is essential. 
Therefore, it is appropriate to stress the efforts of workers at 
the Santa Cruz del Norte power plant. Victor Veiga, head 
mechanic, will explain the work they are doing and will refer 
also to past experience and future prospects. 
  [Begin recording] [Veiga] Before beginning the maintenance 
work, we held a meeting of all the workers -- 72 in all, 
counting mechanics, operators, electricians, and other support 
workers -- and we agreed to work longer shifts in order to have 
the engine ready by Sunday and not by Monday, so as to guarantee 
the peak consumption time on 1 May. We hope to complete our work 
by then. This is the main objective of our repairs. 
  So far, the maintenance work has not been fully successful 
because we have had problems with the water supply from the 
Santa Cruz del Norte aqueduct. Nevertheless, we have overcome 
other difficult situations and we are trying to overcome these 
problems. We were to do the cracking [craqueo] in boiler No. 1 
to eliminate dirt and smut from the boiler. We must first remove 
the dirt to make the cleaning job easier. We were unable to do 
so because we did not have enough water. The pipes had 
experienced some damage and we needed more water. 
  [Garcia] Veiga also explained that they are already 
beginning 
to clean the water pipe system. 
  [Veiga] We have located all the problems and are now in the 
process of washing the [words indistinct] and superheaters so as 
to begin the repair work and to finish it by Saturday night, at 
the latest, so the engine will be ready for Sunday. 
  We believe that if the water supply is normalized; we should 
have no problem in resuming full operation on Sunday to meet 
peak consumption hours. But if we have the same problem, if the 
water pressure is not increased and we are short of water, we 
cannot guarantee operation either on Sunday or on Monday. 
  This plant has three units: No. 1, which is now under light 
maintenance but is operational; No. 2, under full maintenance 
that is expected to conclude in approximately 110 or 115 days; 
and No. 3, which is in a stage of investment. We hope to begin 
the first stages of operation by the end of the year. 
  We also have boiler No. 4 in the back yard; but after the 
suspension of trade and commercial relations with the Soviet 
Union, we decided that we could fix up only to unit No. 3. As 
the minister [not further specified] has explained, this year we 
intend to put at least up to unit No. 3 into operation. 
  [Garcia] Some of the workers who are really busy with these 
repair activities will also give their impressions. 
  [First worker] I am Gilberto Azardena and I am in charge of 
maintenance here. I am the head of the maintenance team, in 
charge of repairing turbogenerator No. 1. Right now we are in 
the process of repairing a number of failures in the engine. 
  [Second worker] My name is Jose Luis Vargas Ramirez and I am 
trying to recover a valve that was in poor condition. So far, we 
are facing the problems on a rather average level -- not too 
well, I would say. 
  [Garcia] But are you resolving them? 
  [Second worker] Yes, of course. We are making progress. 
  [Garcia] Maintenance on unit No. 1 of the Santa Cruz plant 
is 
one of many being carried out in the country, and the efficiency 
and expeditiousness with which this work is done depends to a 
great extent on the possibilities for improving the current 
capacity of the national energy system. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 1600 GMT on 26 April carries its "Straight Talk" program with 
host Osvaldo Rodriguez from JUVENTUD REBELDE, and guest Luis 
Sexto from BOHEMIA magazine, on part two of: What Country Do We 
Live In Today? 
  Rodriguez begins the discussion by saying that politically 
and socially, Cuba is one of a kind: "We have a steep economic 
crisis, yet we maintain political stability; and why not say it 
-- social stability as well. Cuba is the only such case." 
  Sexto points out that Cuba's political present cannot be 
judged without considering its past. He says: "Never have I seen 
in any other country such a solid bond between past and present; 
between history and history-in-the-making." He goes on to say 
that: "Despite shortages that are in some aspects acute, but not 
tragic; despite deficits; despite sacrifices; and despite the 
postponement of legitimate individual and social dreams, the 
Cuban people are aware that there is no other political system 
or political idea that would guarantee what they themselves have 
lived during the past 35 years. 
  "This is part of the reasoning, even unconsciously, of any 
Cuban today. What alternative does Cuba have today if not to 
remain bonded to the political idea of the Revolution? What 
other options do we have? The option proposed by the people in 
Miami who support annexation? The most progressive of the Miami 
annexation supporters are proposing private property and a 
market economy." Rodriguez replies: "I recently read in the 
Miami NUEVO HERALD an article going beyond that, proposing for 
1994, U.S. annexation as a solution to our problems." Sexto 
notes that some say that socialism has failed in Cuba, adding: 
"That is something that remains to be seen. What completely 
failed 35 years ago in Cuba was capitalism." 
  Rodriguez stresses that history is a factor in analyzing 
attitudes Cubans assume today in contending with the situation. 
He points out that despite the shortages, the situation in Cuba 
is far removed from that of many Latin American countries 
because Cuba is trying to maintain an equilibrium in terms of 
social services. 
  Rodriguez and Sexto discuss the importance of the ration 
booklet in Cuba's present situation. Rodriguez points out: "I 
believe the ration booklet is an element of that equilibrium you 
mentioned." Sexto responds: "The ration book is precisely an 
element that favors distribution equilibrium. I am not an enemy 
of the ration book, but I believe that getting rid of it someday 
will benefit us all. I have had that opinion for years. But 
right now, the ration booklet guarantees minimal distribution 
and equilibrium in distribution." Rodriguez disagrees with 
Sexto's point of view: "I do not agree with you. I believe the 
ration booklet must be maintained because it is what guarantees 
goods for people with lower incomes." 
  Sexto says that in Cuba they are working hard to cover basic 
needs. He adds: "We are trying to avoid anyone's being abandoned 
or anyone's literal starving to death. I do not believe that 
anyone in this country is literally starving to death because in 
one way or another, they get what they need. It has a lot to do 
with our policies. We have a policy that favors the services and 
views of social justice and protection." 
  In discussing these policies of social justice, Rodriguez 
says: "We have only one option: To stay with the Revolution and 
sacrifice ourselves to maintain our independence and dignity. 
Many of our leaders, including Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina during his trips abroad, have said that anything can be 
discussed here but our independence or the dignity of the Cuban 
people." 
  Sexto adds: "If we look at the trend and the fact that the 
country continues to survive after a three-year crisis, that it 
remains standing with determination to overcome the crisis, this 
means that this country, the Revolution, the government, and the 
social regime that supports this country have the support of the 
majority of the people. That is irrefutable proof. The fact that 
we remain standing is irrefutable proof that the majority of 
Cubans support the Cuban Revolution. The fact that the majority 
of people support the Cuban Revolution does not mean that there 
is no irritation. I believe there is a certain level of 
irritation in the streets. 
  I believe that everyone can take the shortages, the deficit, 
but not everyone can take these challenges with a rational, 
serene, and stable attitude. I believe there are times when the 
irritation is produced because -- and I believe you said this 
during a recent program -- I get home, for example, and there is 
no power. I might get upset because maybe I wanted to read a 
good book or write an article for the magazine. I am not just 
talking about myself; I am referring to any citizen. This does 
not mean that deep down I do not understand the causes for the 
outages. I say to myself that this is what I must go through so 
we can overcome this situation, because the other option is not 
in my best interest. The other option is capitalism, which is 
offered to us by some in Miami, and by some who leave us, to 
back them up." 
  Rodriguez remarks: "With capitalism, everyone knows that 
some 
will benefit while the majority will drown." 
  Sexto says he was once asked what capitalism is. He 
answered: 
"The underground economy is the capitalist economy." Rodriguez 
adds that capitalism's equilibrium is established by the law of 
the market: "A market economy is the underground economy, where 
the price is determined by the supply and demand, regardless of 
who can or cannot buy those goods." 
  Rodriguez says: "We are living in a country facing a 
difficult economic crisis, a country that despite its economic 
crisis, lives in social equilibrium and political stability." He 
concludes: "I will define the country we live in. We live in a 
country that struggles to be better, to overcome, and to defend 
itself." Straight Talk ends at 1615 GMT.

  [Text] Since it was his wish to be buried in Cuba, 
outstanding revolutionary Alfonso Guillen Zelaya was buried at 
the Colon Cemetery today. Commander of the Revolution Juan 
Almeida Bosque, along with relatives, friends and 
comrades-in-arms, headed the procession, and funeral. 
  Alfonso Guillen Zelaya's rich past was recalled today by his 
comrade, Gabriel Gil Alfonso. Guillen Zelaya was the youngest 
member of the Granma expedition. He was arrested after his 
active participation in the Alegria de Pio affair. To the 
prosecutor who tried him, Guillen said: One need not be Cuban to 
fight for liberty, for all men of justice fight for liberty 
wherever it may be offended. 
  Because of his firmness, in 1957 he was deported to Mexico 
where, directed by the 26 July movement, which was in exile, he 
carried out important missions. With the triumph of the 
Revolution, Guillen returned to Cuba, where he held different 
administrative positions. He was vice president of the Cuban 
Institute of Friendship with Peoples for 10 years. 
  As an education ministry official, he attended the Latin 
American and Caribbean Congress of Teachers in Mexico, where he 
was surprised by death at the age of 57. Guillen received 
numerous decorations and distinctions, among them the award for 
being one of the founders of the Communist Party of Cuba.

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] Havana TRABAJADORES in Spanish of 11 
April 1994 on pages 4 and 5 reports that approximately 4.8 
million medical certificates were issued in 1993. This 
represents an estimated 60.2 million missed workdays. The 
article reports that while this represents a reduction in 
comparison to 1992 figures, the economic costs rose from 181.8 
million pesos to 192 million pesos. The State Committee for 
Labor and Social Security (CETSS) explains the discrepancy by 
noting that more days off were prescribed per certificate due to 
the optical neuritis epidemic, which affected 58,000 people, a 
conjunctivitis epidemic, and "other ailments." However, the 
article says, the neuritis epidemic accounts for only 3.31 
percent of the more than 60 million workdays lost. The tourism 
industry has a lower rate of absenteeism and issues fewer 
medical certificates even though the workers "are exposed to the 
same viruses, the same epidemics, and work hard, although not as 
hard as construction workers or cane cutters," the article 
explains. 
  Dr. Ramon Crespo Almeira, secretary general of the health 
workers union, said that, while most doctors are conscientious 
in issuing certificates, measures have been taken against those 
who have not followed the rules. Crespo also explained that it 
is up to administrators in the work places to verify 
certificates and to investigate other causes of absenteeism 
instead of "blaming the doctors."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 21 Apr (EFE) -- The Argentine 
Telecommunications Commission (CNT) reported today that 
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, the four member 
countries of the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) are 
seeking to coordinate the transmission power and frequencies of 
television stations in border areas. 
  The CNT communique states that the rules and regulations 
under study will be used to control the activities of 100 open 
television channels that transmit on the borders of the four 
countries. 
  During a technical meeting that was held at the beginning of 
this week in Buenos Aires, delegates of the Mercosur member 
countries evaluated the creation of procedures to "coordinate 
the transmission of power and the high and medium frequencies." 
  The CNT reported that, according to Mercosur, the rules and 
regulations must be drafted by 30 June 1994 although "the 
technical details for the drafting of the final document that 
will be signed by the four presidents in December 1994 have yet 
to be approved." 
  The 18 April meeting was the fifth conference of Mercosur 
members to implement a mechanism "so that each country will have 
guidelines to establish, together with their neighbors, open and 
coded television channels."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 Apr (EFE) -- It was reported today 
that the businesses and investments of Argentina, Brazil, 
Paraguay, and Uruguay -- which make up Mercosur [Common Market 
of the South] -- are concentrated in one fourth of the regional 
integration project's vast territory. 
  According to a survey conducted by the Deloitte, Touch, and 
Simonsen Associates company of Buenos Aires, 250 enterprises and 
financial companies with important businesses within Mercosur 
are concentrating their main activities in Brazil and Argentina. 
  The analysts confirmed that the "real Mercosur," the most 
interesting entrepreneurial area due to its economic potential, 
involves 110 million inhabitants with an average income of 
$5,000 per year. 
  The "real Mercosur" has a GDP of some $550 billion, compared 
with the $726 billion of the complete territory of the four 
member countries which have a total population of 198 million 
persons. 
  The area where there is the greatest business interest has 
the form of a stylized S with the apex in Belo Horizonte 
(Brazil), while its other point is in the Argentine province of 
Mendoza on the border with Chile. 
  This includes all of Uruguay, two thirds of Paraguay -- on 
its borders with Argentina and Brazil -- and the wealthier 
regions of Brazil and Argentina. 
  The centers that have a very large economic potential 
include 
Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Curitiba in Brazil; Buenos Aires, 
Cordoba, and Rosario in Argentina; Montevideo in Uruguay; and 
Asuncion and Ciudad del Este in Paraguay. 
  The trade exchange (exports plus imports) among Mercosur 
partners has increased by 34.7 percent per year since 1991, when 
the agreement went into effect. 
  According to the study, the increase in regional trade 
between 1987 and 1990 amounted to 16.5 percent. 
  Regional trade increased from $5.403 billion in 1991 to 
$10.257 in 1993, a period when Argentina overcame an economic 
crisis and when market ups and downs, which continue, began in 
Brazil. 
  Of the 250 companies that do most of the business deals 
within Mercosur, 44 percent are small and medium sized 
companies; 33 percent are large companies -- mostly Brazilian 
and Argentine; and the other 23 percent are multinationals. 
  According to a poll of the businessmen involved, 
manufactured 
products and services represent 55 percent of the business deals 
within Mercosur. 
  Some 17 percent of businessmen installed new industrial 
plants in another country in the heat of the integration wave. 
  Some 10 percent opted for the opening of commercial offices 
in another country, and 7 percent decided to purchase or form a 
partnership with a neighbor. 
  The manufacture of vehicles and the financial and insurance 
services -- with 23 and 21 percent of the market respectively -- 
account for the majority of the investment. 
  The manufacture of capital assets (machinery and tools), 
with 
13 percent of the market, and the production of food and 
beverages, with 12 percent, must also be highlighted. 
  Mercosur will become a free trade zone as of 1995 when all 
customs barriers will be lifted. There will be a 1-year grace 
period for the products that are protected by Uruguay and 
Paraguay.

  [Text] The Haitian Army high command blamed the 22 April 
incident in Gonaives on armed individuals wanting to destabilize 
the state. The Army has not issued a final toll, but allegedly 
28 deaths occurred, according to the latest count. 
  The communique signed by the Secretariat of the General 
Staff 
also points out that the military operation took place on the 
night of 24-25 April, not at dawn on 22 April as reported in the 
accounts of area residents. They explain that the police 
operations took place in Raboteau, a Gonaives suburb, to thwart 
the action of armed individuals who, according to bits of 
intelligence, were preparing to sabotage public institutions and 
attack the Artibonite Military Department Headquarters, the 
premises of the departmental military command. 
  According to the Haitian high command, the Gonaives incident 
and other recent incidents are the results of the steps of the 
plan conceived during the meeting in Washington on 21 November 
1993 in which some ministers of the resigning government 
participated. 
  The military institution has renewed its determination to 
guarantee order and public peace and its firm intent to stop the 
actions of those who are devoid of the sense of state, 
institutions, and harmony that must exist within the Haitian 
family, the text adds. 
  The incident allegedly caused 28 deaths, according to the 
latest testimony collected by AFP. Most of the victims, over 15, 
were reached as they were trying to escape by sea. All but two 
were buried on the spot. As of now, their identities are 
unknown, they explain. 
  An important exodus occurred after the tragedy. Most of the 
frightened inhabitants fled the neighborhood, still under high 
military surveillance, to take refuge in other regions of the 
city or country. According to the local Justice and Peace 
Commission of the [Catholic] Church, soldiers shot at residents 
of the area without warning. The correspondent of a private 
radio station reported that shots were fired before the arrival 
of the military.

  [Text] Today, we are able to give you information offered 
by the head of the North Military Department, notably for the 
city of Cap-Haitian, to our correspondent on the spot. The 
latest news regarding the situation in Le Borgne is that the 
Army is allegedly in control of the situation, according to the 
report given to our correspondent in Cap-Haitian by the military 
head of the city. 
  Military units sent to the spot are allegedly in control of 
the situation after chasing away a group of armed rebels, 
supporters of President Aristide, according to statements by the 
military commander of the North Department. No official report 
has been provided, however, since the confrontations between the 
military and the group of armed civilians led by the North 
Department delegate, according to information provided by the 
North Military Command. Our correspondent, Jean-Claude Larousse, 
has details: 
  [Begin Larousse recording, in Creole] In Le Borgne, Boucan 
Michel, the Haitian Army is in control of the situation after 
several days of lavalas insurrection led by Marc Lamour, former 
member of the Constituent Assembly in 1987, vice delegate under 
the overthrown Aristide government. We learned from military 
sources that the Army seized stocks of weapons, explosives, and 
ammunition which were at the disposal of the terrorists, 
according to the commander of the North Military Department, 
Lieutenant Colonel Claudel Josaphat. The same sources also say 
that many of the rebels were killed; they do not specify the 
number nor mention whether the leader of the group, Marc Lamour, 
was alive, under arrest, or in hiding during an Army raid early 
last week. 
  Another source, however, said the only casualty on the 
military side was a soldier who was shot in the foot. According 
to the same source from the North Military Department, the 
weapons that the terrorists had were guns, 40-mm grenade 
launchers, AR-15 antitank rifles [as heard], and 9-mm pistols. 
According to information circulating in Le Borgne, a lot of 
damage was done after the raid. 
  Meanwhile, we learned that there were many arrests in Le 
Borgne, Port Magot, and even in Limbe, including the Le Borgne 
mayor elected 16 December. According to military sources, he was 
charged with plotting against state security. It is very 
difficult for a journalist, however, to find and verify 
information on the development of the situation in Le Borgne. 
Meanwhile, according to Lt. Col. Claudel Josaphat, the military 
raid continues. 
  Let us point out that the incident began, according to 
military authorities, on the evening of 7-8 April when two of 
Marc Lamour's men attacked the outpost of Petit-Bourg in Le 
Borgne, a region about 50 km west of Cap-Haitian. [end recording]

  [Text] Concerning the accusation brought by the military 
command, the reaction of President Aristide's spokesman was not 
long in coming. Let us listen to Jean-Claude Martineau. 
  [Begin Martineau recording, in Creole] They have spoken of a 
certain meeting held in a Washington hotel. It was a public 
meeting during which the president discussed how to get out of 
the crisis with a great number of Haitians. Contrary to 
statements by the men who pretend otherwise, I do not believe 
any plans stemming from this meeting are being carried out. 
  First, I would like to say that these men have been killing 
people for years. So, such a slight pretext will not relieve the 
military -- who are slaughtering people left and right, then 
laying their bodies in state [as heard] until pigs eat them in 
the streets -- of their responsibilities. [words indistinct] as 
if they are defending themselves against the wishes of an entire 
nation and the entire world. This is something. It is drug 
dealers' rhetoric. [end recording] 
  That was President Aristide's spokesman Jean-Claude 
Martineau.

  [Excerpt] Frantz Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of 
Deputies, and Senator Sansaricq, the president of the unofficial 
Senate office, met on 27 April to coordinate viewpoints on a 
means of resolving the crisis, particularly of filling the power 
vacuum. For Sen. Sansaricq, this constitutes official 
recognition of the office over which he presides in the Senate. 
Edner Jean filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Jean] This meeting occurred fewer than 24 
hours after President Monde's shattering statements, which began 
his turn to the right. This spectacular reversal is about to 
take place because of extended consultations with the office 
Sen. Bernard Sansaricq leads. 
  A significant fact: The talk took place in the office of 
President Monde, the same place where, 15 days earlier, he had 
assured Firmin Jean-Louis, the president of the National 
Assembly, of his firm support, which he stated on this occasion 
in the presence of journalists. With this gesture, Frantz Robert 
Monde wished to prompt the Senate president to examine the 
parliamentary plan submitted to him as a resolution by the 
deputies. The latest statements and initiatives by Firmin 
Jean-Louis had made Monde think he had other political motives. 
The president of the Chamber of Deputies therefore decided to 
switch to the other camp, with a wink at Sen. Bernard Sansaricq. 
  [Sansaricq, in Creole] President Monde has decided to work 
with the Senate over which I am presiding. He finally recognizes 
that this Senate is functional and has been constitutionally 
elected. It is neither an acclaimed office nor an enigma, as 
with what happened on 10 August in the presence of the 
international community when they applauded and acclaimed a 
president without going through constitutional norms, without 
the president being elected according to the Senate's internal 
rules. That was a mystery. The page is now turned and must be 
turned completely. I have been awaiting this moment. It has 
arrived and I think we must now work quickly to endow the 
country with an executive because we must really begin 
considering the country's suffering and pain. 
  [Jean] Bernard Sansaricq paid tribute to President Monde for 
his flexibility and determination in seeking a solution to the 
crisis, even though, he said, we have not always approved of his 
approach. Despite some differences in their positions, the two 
men have many points in common: Frantz Robert Monde and Bernard 
Sansaricq are both legislators from the southern region who have 
always been critical of President Aristide's seven months in 
office. In the face of what they call interference by the 
international community, they have always been uncompromising in 
their opposition and nationalism. Very often in the past, both 
the senator and the deputy have made the same speech using more 
or less the same words. 
  [Sansaricq] The international community has its work and we 
have our work. The best answer we can give the international 
community is that we will install a serious and honest 
government with capable men. That is the answer they need. Once 
they have that answer and realize that we are determined to do 
something serious for the country, that the prime minister and 
the ministers who will be chosen will be competent, honest, and 
capable of running this nation, they will know it is the best 
answer. Dealing with them right now: Whether we greet Bouki 
[Haitian folk character] or not, he will eat us up anyway. I 
would therefore rather die standing up than crouched on my knees. 
  [Jean] According to Turneb Delpe, there is nothing new in 
President Monde's position. The senator from the 
constitutionalist bloc explains that the president of the 
Chamber of Deputies has always expressed his preference for 
Article 149 of the Constitution. Sen. Delpe would have been 
surprised if he had said the opposite. [passage omitted] [end

<F P=106> ["Text" of communique issued by the Institutional </F>
Revolutionary Party Central Executive Committee; place and date 
not given -- first two paragraphs are LA JORNADA introduction] 
  [Text] The Central Executive Committee [CEN] of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] has announced that 
Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon "has decided to postpone campaign 
events and activities planned for the first days of the week, 
due to the importance that he gives the idea of debating his 
ideas and political program." 
  In a communique, the PRI leadership reiterates that Zedillo 
is willing to debate over radio and television with Diego 
Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential candidate of the National 
Action Party [PAN] on Tuesday 3 May and rules out the proposal 
by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential candidate of the Party 
of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] to hold the debates at a 
later date. Herewith follows the complete text: 
  "The PRI CEN reports the following regarding the invitation 
made by presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo to the PAN and 
PRD candidates to debate as soon as possible: 
  ``1. In a message published on 24 April, Ernesto Zedillo 
expressed his confidence that `throughout the campaign there 
will be opportunities to compare our positions with the 
candidates of all parties.' 
  ``2. On 25 April, Engineer Cardenas, in a letter 
addressed to our candidate Ernesto Zedillo, without clearly 
agreeing to take part in the debate, said: `We plan to hold 
several debates, among which you and I could hold one more on 
our own, in view of the objective fact that this campaign's 
confrontation really represents what both of us believe in and 
is what voters will have to decide upon.' 
  ``That same day, our candidate clearly replied: `I do not 
agree with your plan to disqualify other candidacies registered 
within the law, nor can I agree with your attempt to rule out 
other parties that represent ideological pluralism and diversity 
in the country's political life. I reiterate to you that in my 
invitation I pointed out my confidence that there will be 
opportunities to compare positions with the candidates of all 
the parties throughout the campaign. 
  ``3. In his invitation, Ernesto Zedillo proposed clear 
conditions: That the debate be broadcast live on television and 
over the radio and managed in an unquestionably impartial, 
honest, and equal format. 
  ``4. PAN Presidential Candidate Diego Fernandez de 
Cevallos has accepted the invitation. He suggested the event 
take place on 3 May. 
  ``5. Candidate Ernesto Zedillo has accepted this proposal 
for 3 May. 
  ``6. In light of the above, our candidate has decided to 
postpone his activities and campaign events for the first few 
days of the week. He did so because of the significance he has 
attached to debating his ideas and political program before the 
nation. 
  ``7. He also accepted Diego Fernandez de Cevallos's 
suggestion that the event take place at the National Chamber of 
Television and Radio Industries. This means that the Chamber 
will provide the necessary technical support to guarantee that 
all stations who want to pick up the signal can do so and 
provide whatever the press may need to cover the event. 
  ``8. Cardenas has already advised the media that he 
accepts the debate, but at a much later date. 
  ``9. In an effort to ensure unquestionable integrity and 
equality, our party will present a format proposal for the 
debate tomorrow. This format will provide time for opening and 
closing remarks by each candidate and the same amount of time 
for each contender to present his ideas. The proposal will also 
include a moderator whose absolute integrity and renowned 
impartiality qualify him or her to direct the debate and ensure 
that all candidates stick to the agreed times and scope. 
  ``10. The three parties will discuss their points of view 
and agree upon all these issues, pursuant to the organization 
and completion of the debate, in the shortest possible time. 
  ``11. The PRI and its presidential candidate are aware 
that the direct exchange of ideas is an enriching element within 
our country's democratic process. It will be an opportunity for 
the Mexicans to see where they really and truly agree and 
disagree with each candidate to the Presidency of the republic.''

<F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] 
presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon said 3 May 
"appears to me to be a very good date" to hold a debate with PAN 
[National Action Party] presidential candidate Diego Fernandez 
de Cevallos. 
  Meanwhile, PRI leader Fernando Ortiz Arana reported the date 
had been accepted. Zedillo also said "it is a very astute 
proposal" for the debate to take place at the National Chamber 
of Radio and Television Industry (CNIRT), indicating he was 
"waiting for additional details." Former PRI candidate Luis 
Donaldo Colosio had said the appropriate location for this type 
of event should be the Federal Electoral Institute to distance 
the event from special interests. 
  In the evening, the PRI candidate sent a letter to 
Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas [presidential candidate for the Party of the Democratic 
Revolution, PRD], in which he requests "a prompt reply" on the 
date and conditions for the debate, while he indicated that 
other candidates should not be disqualified from the debate. 
Zedillo said he does not agree "with efforts to discount other 
parties that represent ideological plurality and diversity in 
the nation's political life." 
  In his first reference to the issue, the PRI candidate 
replied as follows from his party's headquarters: I am waiting 
for the candidates' reply. I will respectfully and attentively 
consider everything they have to say. Today, I read in the 
press that Fernandez de Cevallos had made two specific proposals 
to establish the date (3 May). In my opinion, this is very good. 
  He added: "Another proposal is for the CNIRT to coordinate 
and organize the debate. This also is a very astute proposal. 
I will be waiting for additional details." 
  Zedillo did not refer to any contact with Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas, but Fernando Ortiz Arana said he had accepted. Ortiz 
Arana said: "There was a reply from the PAN and PRD candidates 
accepting our candidate Erneswto Zedillo's invitation to hold a 
debate. The important issue is that soon we will be presenting 
our proposals, program, and actions in a public debate, thereby 
keeping our commitment to the community." 
  He added: "The two parties have accepted the proposals, and 
PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos has proposed the date 
of 3 May for the debate. Our candidate and the party have 
accepted this, and all PRI members will be with Ernesto Zedillo 
at the debate he has convened." 
  Ortiz Arana insisted that Zedillo "acknowledges the 
principle 
of equality among all candidates and hopes there will be an 
opportunity to debate our positions with the other candidates 
from all of the political parties throughout the campaign." 
  The following is the text of a letter sent to the PRD 
candidate: 
  "Engineer Cardenas: 
  "I appreciate your reply to the invitation sent to you 
yesterday by Diego Fernandez de Ceballos, PAN presidential 
candidate, to hold as soon as possible a debate to be broadcast 
by radio and television. 
  ``I am pleased to read that you have been willing to debate 
since November. Nevertheless, it is good to remember that it 
was Luis Donaldo Colosio, PRI presidential candidate, who for 
the first time openly and directly proposed a debate. 
  ``Allow me to stress that the terms of my invitation are 
perfectly clear. I have proposed a debate between Fernandez de 
Ceballos, you, and me on our ideas and our political platforms. 
I have proposed a live and uninterrupted debate to be broadcast 
on radio and television within a framework of unquestionable 
impartiality, transparency, and equality. 
  ``I propose we use only one single broadcast that can be 
received and transmitted by all television and radio stations 
that want to carry the debate, without favoring any specific 
company. In addition, conditions should be provided to allow 
representatives of the print media to cover the debate to their 
complete satisfaction. 
  ``I believe that for the debate to be a fair political 
exercise that will benefit the people, the participants should 
be given equal time to express their ideas. Likewise, we should 
be given the opportunity to comment on the other candidates' 
responses and to issue opening and final statements. A 
moderator of the utmost integrity and impartiality would also 
help the candidates adjust to the time allotted. 
  ``The specific terms of my invitation should correspond to a 
definite response. Instead, I read in your letter the following: 
  ``It would be important, because of this type of event's 
widespread dissemination and because of the public's undeniable 
interest in such things, to consider holding several other 
debates. One or two of these debates could even be between just 
you and me because, objectively speaking, it is our proposals 
and what we represent that comprise the major points of 
contention in this campaign, and the citizens will have to 
decide between these two sides when casting their votes. 
  ``In this regard, I believe it will be the citizens, by way 
of the free exercise of their rights, who will decide whether 
"objectively speaking, our proposals and what we represent is 
what truly is being contested in this campaign and from which 
the citizens will have to decide when casting their votes. 
  ``I do not agree with your attempts to disqualify other 
legally registered candidates and I cannot agree with your 
attempts to discount other political parties that represent the 
ideological plurality and diversity of the nation's political 
life. Therefore, I reiterate that in my invitation I indicated 
my trust that there will opportunities to debate issues with all 
candidates from all parties throughout the campaign. 
  ``In another turn of events, the above-mentioned paragraph 
of 
your letter does not indicate whether you have accepted my 
invitation, as, by the way, Fernandez Cevallos already has. 
Moreover, he proposed that the debate take place on 3 May and 
that it be organized by the CNIRT. In turn, I have accepted 
both proposals." 
  ``Hoping to receive a prompt reply from you to my invitation 
made yesterday, I remain, very truly yours,'' 
  [Signed] Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon

<F P=106> [Report by Victor Cardoso] </F>
  [Text] The xenophobia unleashed in the United States 
against migrant workers must not taint all bilateral relations 
with Mexico because undocumented aliens are not responsible for 
all of that country's ills, Teodoro Maus, general director for 
Mexican communities abroad at the Foreign Secretariat [SRE], has 
said. 
  The official noted the conditions of Mexicans living in the 
United States are a matter of permanent concern for the SRE. 
For that reason, the Mexican Government promotes, through its 
embassy and consulates in the United States, rapprochement and 
greater involvement with legal aliens, the Hispanic and Black 
communities, and even nongovernment organisms "to counter the 
xenophobia that has been unleashed in the United States against 
undocumented aliens." 
  Mexican authorities are seeking a qualitative and serious 
change in the attitude toward undocumented persons in 
particular, and Mexican residents in general, without letting 
that problem cool relations, he said. 
  Maus indicated that undocumented aliens are being blamed for 
all the woes of the United States, although they contribute more 
than they receive, since they fulfill their obligations, on 
fiscal matters for instance, but do not receive the benefits 
that that earns. Most of them, he said, pay their taxes with 
the hope of establishing a record of residency. In addition, 
they do not report abuses by their employers for fear of 
deportation. 
  By way of example, he mentioned that in the State of 
California, restrictions were increased on federal aid for 
undocumented aliens who were hurt the most in the recent Los 
Angeles earthquake. The argument for this was that they are 
responsible for the rise in unemployment and crime, when the 
fact is those things happen as a result of that country's 
economic problems and the closure of military bases. He 
recalled that at first, federal aid for housing reconstruction 
was earmarked without discrimination, but later it was cut under 
the pretext that the undocumented aliens were to blame for 
unemployment, the deterioration of the economy, and crime.

  [Excerpt] Cancun, QR [Quintana Roo], 24 Apr -- The Mexican 
Government has decided to grant temporary, 180-day visas to the 
Cuban boat people who arrived in national territory, as a 
"general measure" to halt problems that may stem from the wave 
of Cubans trying to seek asylum in the United States. 
  Jorge Mendoza Garza, coordinator of supervision and 
operations control of the National Migration Institute [INM], 
said here the 85 boat people who arrived at Isla Mujeres at dawn 
on 11 April are the first Cubans to benefit from this measure. 
Mendoza was in charge of transporting the boat people via 
chartered plane to Mexico City today. 
  The official said that after verifying that the boat the 
boat 
people were planning to use to reach Miami "failed to meet 
specified international security standards," these Cubans were 
convinced to go to Mexico City "where they can probably expedite 
procedures to enter the United States legally." 
  The Cubans voiced their doubts, however, that Mexican 
authorities are trying to repatriate them in light of the 23 
April incident, which occurred 13 km off the coast of Isla 
Mujeres whereby 62 boat people evaded the Mexican Army, trying 
to reach international waters on board the boat that brought 
them from the Cayman Islands, the Ferro 25. 
  The Mexican Army deployed two frigates to intercept the 
deserters of the Fidel Castro government. One of the frigates, 
the "Chontal," rammed the middle of the Cuban boat. Carlos 
Avila, one of the boat people who, as he said, "unintentionally" 
became the group's spokesman, said "the boat was damaged after 
we were hosed with water cannons." 
  During the operation, three Cubans were injured, one of them 
in the ribs, but Jaime Machorro Musalem, Yucatan Peninsula 
Migration representative, has insisted that the boat people had 
minor bruises and that no seriously injured Cuban traveled to 
Mexico City. 
  The Cubans left for Mexico City from the local airport at 
1720 sharp on a chartered Boeing 727-200, plate registration 
XA-TCX, owned by the Allegro Charter Company. Meanwhile, 
another boat with 96 Cubans on board was on its way to Cozumel, 
presumably to be transported to Mexico City in the same plane on 
25 April. 
  Meanwhile, many relatives of the boat people in Miami have 
contacted news correspondents and the local media to inform them 
they would protest abuses to which the Mexican Army allegedly 
subjected the boat people. 
  Machorro refused to confirm these allegations, but he 
underscored immigration authorities had nothing to do with the 
operation "because there are no formal relations between the 
Navy [as published] and the INM." He added that for the time 
being, these institutions are addressing the problem "only as 
far as they are concerned." [passage omitted]

economic support will be reinforced. 
  The recent events that occurred in our country will not

economic support for Mexico. 
  [Begin Winfield recording] Canada is very interested in

  Participating in the Canada-Mexico 50 Years of Diplomatic

of the recent kidnappings that took place recently in Mexico 
City. 
  [Begin Winfield recording] It is a terrible, unacceptable 
crime; it is a method that is unacceptable for solving problems. 
We reject this type of action, but such actions will not change 
our trust in the country. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Amalia Frias Santillan and Guadalupe Mendoza] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, the Business Coordinating Council (CCE) 
and the Private Sector Economic Studies Center (CEESP) said that 
during the first trimester of the year, the Mexican economy 
confronted "a very difficult situation that has created an 
atmosphere of uncertainty and has had a negative impact on the 
expectations of many national and foreign economic agents." They 
clarified, however, that the economy is "strong, and thus the 
country's economic development model is viable." 
  Meanwhile, Victor Manuel Terrones Lopez, president of 
Canacintra [National Association of the Processing Industry], 
has predicted "stronger pressure is on the way from small groups 
seeking to break social peace," and he urged sectors to act 
"coldly and prudently to prevent violence at any cost in the 
upcoming elections." 
  In an interview with UNOMASUNO, Cesar Hernandez Espejo, 
president of the National Association of Executives of Business 
Chambers and Associations [Asociacion Nacional de Ejecutivos de 
Camaras y Asociaciones Empresariales], has said there is no 
threat of economic instability because of the closeness of the 
elections. He added "given that we Mexican businessmen are not 
a political party, we will continue to invest and create jobs 
even if the Presidency is not won by the ruling party because we 
are part of a country that has a great chance of overcoming its 
problems and modernizing its economy, and, in turn, of achieving 
a definite economic consolidation." 
  The country's top organization, which is affiliated with the 
CCE and CEESP, in a joint analysis of "the viability of Mexico's 
economic development model," believes "the pressure applied by 
the exchange rate and financial markets in November 1993 and 
March 1994 demonstrated the effectiveness and strength of the 
economic policy and the progress achieved so far because 
otherwise unfortunate events would have brought about economic 
crises of incalculable magnitude to the country." 
  It is said this economic strength creates maneuvering space, 
which is "significant for economic development as well as a 
means to face difficult periods." 
  The two organizations have explained that adverse 
developments, such as the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
"have not been caused by problems of economic or economic policy 
problems, and it is wrong to associate their impact on economic 
development with problems that are not inherent to it." 
  In debating the strength of the Mexican economy, the CCE and 
CEESP have pointed out Mexico has managed to maintain a moderate 
growth of 16.9 percent from 1988 to 1993. Real remuneration 
(salaries, wages, benefits) grew by 31.9 percent in the 
manufacturing sector. "Few countries have managed to 
continuously reduce inflation while preserving economic growth 
and increasing competitiveness," the business leader added. 
  According to the analysis of these two business 
organizations, the following will give the Mexican economy space 
to maneuver and even face other difficult situations: 

  -  The 
perseverance and congruity of economic policy during regular and 
critical periods, as was the case recently. 
  -  The strengthening of 
the national productive apparatus based on efforts to modernize 
and improve international productivity and competitiveness. 
  -  The 
tidying up of public finances and budget discipline. 
  -  The trust 
of investors, government authorities, and international 
organizations on the Mexican economy. 
  It is also claimed that the process to modernize the Mexican 
economy shows significant progress and favorable results in 
various areas, "but this does not mean this did not entail costs 
for various sectors or that the process is over." 
  On the contrary, the CCE and CEESP have added, "it is 
necessary to hasten the pace and increase efforts in all areas 
that for various reasons have fallen behind or have become out 
of step with the process of modernization." 
  Likewise, it was said current headway in the development 
scheme and results make the Mexican economic process of 
modernization irreversible, because to "abandon or modify that 
scheme will cause serious consequences for the country's future 
and economic viability." 
  The two business organizations have stated efforts that have 
already been made cannot be wasted because most of the economic 
adjustments have already been completed, and "their costs have 
already been covered, and the benefits are only now beginning to 
be reaped." 
  Nor did they recommend the Mexican economic development 
model 
be changed because Mexico's challenge "is to ensure the full 
completion of the process of modernization, making it essential 
to advance and broaden all those areas in which the process has 
made the least headway." 
  The CCE and the CEESP have concluded it is essential to 
complete the process of modernization "because it is the only 
way to guarantee a sustained, expeditious, fair, and balanced 
economic development." 
  Canacintra President Terrones Lopez, interviewed shortly 
after a news conference in which he said the gross national 
product will grow between 1.5 to 2 percent in 1994 and that 
there will be 7-percent inflation, has expressed the private 
sector's commitment "to redouble investment and efforts to 
counter actions of destabilization by small groups, because we 
still have confidence in the country and its institutions." 
  Lopez believes that as election time draws nearer, "pressure 
from destabilizing groups will be greater, but one must consider 
that Mexicans can rise above adversity, as we have seen for a 
long time, and in the face of this threat businessmen will 
strengthen efforts and work." 
  He clarified that in addition to the education and cultural 
process in which Mexican society is involved, there is also a 
political process that permits greater awareness to analyze 
events with a cool head, "but it is essential that rumors which 
affect us so much be ignored because all sectors must seek 
social peace." 
  Lopez said that regardless of the unfortunate events that 
have transpired, and those that may transpire, the government is 
continuing its economic program of support to the micro, small, 
medium, and big businesses; therefore, it will also continue to 
restructure their commercial bank debts. The Canacintra 
president said foreign capital continues to flow into Mexico, to 
the amount of $5 billion between January and March, and "that is 
why we need to act calmly and always place national interest 
first." 
  In conclusion, he reported he has met with Secretariat of 
Finance and Public Credit authorities to look into the 
possibility of reducing the 2-percent tax on fixed assets and 
the value added tax, adjusting it to international levels of 
between 7 to 8 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Alejandro Benitez] </F>
  [Text] Enrique Dajer Nahum, president of the Confederation 
of National Chambers of Commerce (Concanaco), has said the 
country's economic structure is well established because there 
are steady and solid foundations to continue to develop, 
however, "political excuses" have generated too much "agitation." 
  As the Concanaco president attended the meeting in which 
Jose 
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, Institute of the National Housing Fund 
for Workers director general, submitted a report on its 
activities, he added we will be able to remain calm insofar as 
we know how to preserve the balance and analyze significant 
issues. Dajer pointed out: The political aspect undoubtedly 
takes a toll of the investors' minds, but we also know that 
economic reasons will eventually prevail, as we saw on 22 and 23 
April when the respite returned. We are positive this trend 
will prevail, he added. 
  To that effect, the Concanaco leader emphasized his proposal 
to restructure interest rate effects with a new plan to ensure 
that they will not have a major impact on productive 
enterprises. He also said it is necessary to solve, once and 
for all, expired portfolios to ensure that both enterprises and 
banks will no longer have constant friction between them and 
that economic development will reemerge. Dajer stressed that 
relations between Concanaco and the bankers are good and 
believes in solving the country's economic ups and downs. 
  As he was interviewed at the Concanaco headquarters, the 
processing industrialists' leader said the political debate, to 
which Ernesto Zedillo Ponce De Leon, presidential candidate for 
the Institutional Revolutionary Party and his opponents from the 
National Action Party and the Party of the Democratic Revolution 
were invited, "will not eliminate anguish, uncertainty, or 
fears, which we must not link to the economic arena because they 
spark negative effects. The political debate is simply the 
analysis of political platforms to ensure that we, the citizens, 
will be able to analyze them more objectively." 
  Victor Manuel Terrones Lopez, president of Canacintra 
[National Association of the Processing Industry], said 
businessmen, as citizens, "favor this political change because 
thanks to the debate, we will establish which presidential 
candidate offers a better alternative to solve our country's 
political and socioeconomic issues." 
  As he talked about the meetings the business leadership held 
with President Carlos Salinas at the Los Pinos presidential 
residence on several occasions, Terrones said the following: The 
objective of the meetings was to analyze socioeconomic and 
political development. The president expressed the need that we 
offer him special support, but we have already supported him and 
his economic policies. Salinas also wants some adjustments to 
adapt the economic policies to the current times and 
circumstances. 
  As for last week's recovery of the Mexican Stock Exchange 
[BMV], Terrones said the recovery was only logical because "we 
must take into account that the BMV is a volatile stock 
exchange. Mexico does not face this problem alone, however; it 
occurs in all of the world's stock exchanges. This is why the 
ups and downs are normal, but they fail to indicate whether 
there will be a resounding bear market." 
  He said that due to the maturity already reached by the 
Mexican private sector, "financial agitation is already leaving 
us because the changes are not as radical as those we previously 
experienced. For instance, the case of the BMV is currently 
handled more professionally because virtually all of the stock 
exchanges thank the funds from which they receive greater 
financial backing than if it were done by individuals." 
  As Terrones talked about economic recovery, he maintained 
that it will take place in May, but "it will not be a widespread 
recovery" because some sectors are indeed producing more, but 
others will not recover until late 1994. He acknowledged that 
recession or stagnation prevail in two-thirds of the production 
sector because even though recovery indexes were encouraging in 
January and February, the recovery "fell in March." Industries 
and demand, however, will begin to recover slowly at the 
beginning of the second half of this year. 
  Finally, the Canacintra president added that the sectors 
with 
greater growth capacity are those sectors that have greater 
export capacity because production recovery will not be 
widespread. "Achieving growth will take us several months, but 
it will be more consistent by late 1994," Terrones concluded.

  [Text] San Jose, 27 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Jose Maria Figueres, 
the Costa Rican president-elect, rejected the possibility the 
country may enter the Central American Parliament (Parlacen) as 
long as differences on the issue still exist in his country. He 
also questioned Parlacen's "concrete results" in the almost 
three years it has been operating. 
  In an interview published today in the newspaper LA 
REPUBLICA, Figueres, who is 37 years old and will assume control 
of the government on 8 May, said Parlacen is "an issue that has 
divided the country," and as long as this situation continues "I 
do not think it is prudent to continue the controversy." 
  "We can do many things to become closer to the rest of the 
Central American countries without thinking about this 
parliament," said the next Costa Rican chief of state. He also 
said regional unity can be achieved "by fighting for just 
causes." 
  According to Figueres, Central American unity does not 
depend 
on Parlacen but, rather, on a "frank, open, friendly, and 
unitarian" position of the countries in the isthmus, because "it 
is easier to be heard as a region than as a sole country." 
  Figueres added, however, "the negative opinion many Costa 
Ricans have about Parlacen could change when we see concrete 
results," and he asked "what are the concrete results" of this 
parliament since it started operations? 
  Parlacen, headquartered in Guatemala, was installed in 
October 1991 with deputies from Guatemala, Honduras, and El 
Salvador. Nicaragua, which has already approved its entry into 
the forum, has still not elected its deputies. Costa Rica and 
Panama have not even ratified the proposal to enter this 
organization.

  [Text] San Jose, 26 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Hundreds of kilograms 
of cocaine reach the United States every month in which Central 
America is used as a "bridge." Most of the drug is hidden in 
trailer trucks or in ships, as certain police operations in the 
last few years have shown. 
  Costa Rican Security Minister Luis Fishman told ACAN-EFE 
that, contrary to what everyone thinks, the maritime route is 
not the primary transportation means for the drug going from 
South America to North America, but rather the land route is. 
According to the minister, the drug generally reaches Panama 
from Colombia by sea. There it is loaded on to trailer trucks 
with different types of merchandise on its way north until it 
reaches the United States, the largest market in the world. 
  The strongest blows against drug trafficking activities, 
however, have been dealt when the drug is being transported on 
ships, in high speed boats, on its way to the United States. 
The most recent blow took place last week in a joint operation 
between Nicaragua and Costa Rica. 
  In this operation, the authorities arrested five Colombians 
and a Guatemalan citizen after being alerted by the DEA. The 
drug traffickers were caught by Nicaraguan authorities in Costa 
Rican waters. According to media reports, the group belongs to 
the Pereira Cartel in Colombia and will be returned to Costa 
Rica, where they will be prosecuted for drug trafficking. In a 
high speed boat, which left the Colombian port of Buenaventura, 
this group was carrying 650 kg of drugs, which would supposedly 
be unloaded somewhere in Guatemala from where it was to be 
transported to the United States by land, according to police 
sources. 
  In the last four years, more than 3,000 kg of cocaine have 
been confiscated in Costa Rica alone, according to official 
reports. Most of the drug was transported in ships on the 
Pacific Ocean and were detected by radars operated by the DEA in 
northern Costa Rica and Panama. Fishman noted his government's 
firm commitment to fight drug trafficking activities with all 
its resources, but said the police lack the means for more 
effective action. 
  In a report released earlier this month, the U.S. State 
Department praised the efforts made by the Central American 
Governments, with the exception of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, in 
their fight against drug trafficking and money laundering 
activities. 
  Nicaraguan Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta said in 
Costa 
Rica on Monday that this joint operation, which resulted in the 
arrest of six drug traffickers on Friday and the confiscation of 
the drug is a demonstration of his country's willingness to 
fight drug trafficking activities. "It has been proven that the 
fight against drug trafficking activities is not the 
responsibility of a country, but of the international community. 
The success of the operation conducted by Nicaragua and Costa 
Rica is proof of that," he pointed out. 
  According to the State Department, the scarce resources of 
the Costa Rican authorities and the lack of professionalism of 
the security services preclude greater progress in the fight 
against drug trafficking activities in Costa Rica. It pointed 
out that the port of Limon, the largest Costa Rican port, has 
become the primary drug trafficking point between the Colombian 
island of San Andres and the Nicaraguan Caribbean coast with the 
United States. 
  Fishman has repeatedly talked about the need for greater 
cooperation by the consumer nations for a more effective action 
against drug trafficking in Central America.

    [Editorial Report] Paris AFP in Spanish at 1722 GMT on 19 
April reports that the Exports and Investments Promotion Center, 
Cenpro, has reported Costa Rica's exports yielded $522 million 
during the first three months of 1994, 6 percent higher than in 
1993. The Cenpro report adds the tourist sector, Costa Rica's 
main source of revenue, indicated a 10-percent increase compared 
to 1993 figures. The tourist sector yielded $648 million during 
the first three months of 1994. Despite the restrictions on the 
European market, banana exports are still the second leading 
source of revenue, with $109 million in sales, 13 percent less 
than in 1993.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Kirio Waldo Salgado M.] </F>
  [Text] Because of the recent discontent within the FMLN 
[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] ranks and the 
serious contradictions that are destroying what little is left 
of "the revolution," the "front" has been forced to discreetly 
abandon Ruben Zamora. 
  Soon after the "analysis of the situation" of the social 
movement became known, everything seemed to indicate that the 
prevailing argument is that it is useless to continue wasting 
time and money on a losing ticket which does not have the 
consensus of the people to represent the interests of the 
workers. Perhaps this is why in the 20 March elections the 
social movement's support was so weak. But the story goes back 
much further. It stems from the "General Command's" alienation 
of labor leaders and peasants, who supported the FMLN 
organization for 12 years, hiding many clandestine "commanders" 
who -- like Zamora -- were engaged in political undercover 
actions. 
  The madness of the leadership of the former guerrilla 
movement and the vertical command structure that imposes its 
decision from within the FMLN have been the main cause of the 
break between union members and the political committee of what 
is now a political party. This has reached such a point that 
the "coalition" cannot find persons to observe the polls or 
individuals to serve on the Voting Table Boards on 24 April. 
  This has further demoralized Zamora's team. The union 
movement, intelligent and in step with democracy, does not want 
to become involved in the leadership problems of an FMLN that is 
deeply divided, that has made use of confrontation and the 
Marxist practice of slandering its opposition. The social 
movement has suggested, if not a change in leadership, at least 
a renewal of its strategies, more in keeping with the 
aspirations of the majority. The workers and peasants demand 
from their leaders a serious dialogue, without demagoguery, in 
order to better define their positions. They question the 
arrogance of those "commanders" who passed to "a better life" 
after the peace accords. They want an explanation for the new 
ideological posture adopted in favor of imperialism by those who 
betrayed the revolution in Santa Marta. The want a new 
leadership born of the rank and file, with a different vision, 
that will allow freedom and democracy within the organization, 
and that will eliminate fundamentalist and "bourgeois" vertical 
command structures that are destroying what little is left of 
the revolutionary mythology. 
  But there are those who not want to give up their positions 
because if they did they would have to return their armored cars 
and sumptuous homes to the revolution. They would be inhibited 
from rubbing elbows with the capitalist "bourgeoisie" that they 
are serving and would lose their "class" privileges, which has 
alienated them from the rank and file and the labor-peasant 
movement. 
  The unions no longer want reprimands from the FMLN leaders. 
Perhaps they are a long way from fulfilling their dreams, but 
they have reached the conclusion that it is easier to achieve 
them by talking directly with the democratic right wing. 
  They are renouncing, prematurely, any manipulation by the 
FMLN, because they proved the "front" was never a reliable link 
between the impoverished population and businessmen, between the 
middle class and the power of the state. 
  Doubtlessly, the rectification of the social movement may 
once again attract the sympathy of the new government. They 
understand that if they are sincere and know how to ask for 
things, they may reintegrate into the democratic mainstream and 
contribute to strengthening important national objectives. 
  The breach they opened to undermine the foundation of the 
Republic during their 12-year alliance with Marxist terrorism 
did not improve the rank and file's living conditions. Now, in 
peace and harmony, they can procure a better future for their 
fellow union members within the system. 
  We are sure that good judgment will be the norm for the 
social movement to follow. Let's hope this is not merely 
rhetoric born of the contradictions of the left wing. 
  El Salvador will be a great and sovereign nation when the 
strategy of brutality, blackmail, and Marxist dogmatism gives 
way to sincerity and good judgment. We hope this will happen on 
24 April.

<F P=106> [Article by Clara Elvira Ospina: "The Malvinas Are </F>
Argentine"] 
  [Text] He came to Colombia with the firm intention of 
strengthening the ties between the Argentine Army, which he 
commands, and the Colombian Army. But he also arrived with a 
score of 5-0 hanging over his head. He knew that it was his duty 
and that he wanted to congratulate the Colombians on the fact 
that their soccer team had managed to kick the ball into his 
compatriots' goal five times. 
  What he did not think about was that everyone would ask him 
about the Falklands war. Wherever he appears in Colombia, 
Lieutenant General (the top rank in the Argentine military) 
Martin Antonio Balza, Army chief of staff, spends much of his 
time recalling the conflict his country waged with the United 
Kingdom in 1982. 
  Now, 12 years after the lost war, Balza insists that the 
Falkland Islands belong to Argentina. "That is unquestionable," 
he asserts. 
  "But," he points out, "that is a political problem. Our 
president has made that very clear at numerous international 
forums. The matter lies in diplomatic hands, and it is through 
those channels that we hope to recover that piece of Argentine 
territory." 
  Although he did not say whether it could be obtained 
militarily, he knows that he is a soldier, that he is obedient, 
and that if it were necessary, he would obey orders to fight a 
war on those grounds. 
  The harsh experience of the conflict keeps haunting his 
conversation. "I am not a Falklands war hero," he says. The real 
war heroes are the men, the officers, petty officers, and 
enlisted men in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and our 
Gendarmerie who remained behind as a monument to our 
sovereignty. The real heroes of the Falklands are those who were 
mutilated. I was just one more soldier who went and came back, 
after fighting for something very dear to the hearts of all 
Argentines." 
  He could not say whether there were violations of the Geneva 
Convention during the war. Although he was held prisoner for a 
month, he claims not to have been mistreated or to have had his 
rights trampled. 
  Looking back, he knows that the war was lost because the 
Argentine Armed Forces were very weak compared to those of the 
United Kingdom. "We went into the Falklands war on the basis of 
two assumptions of national or military strategy. 
  "One assumption was that the United Kingdom would not 
respond, and the other assumption or hypothesis was that the 
United States would support us or remain neutral. Neither was 
true. 
  "We went to war on an island territory without controlling 
the air or the sea. The British dominated the skies. It was a 
war in which there were acts of heroism, acts of operational 
efficiency on the tactical level, but that was not enough to win 
a conflict with those weaknesses and limitations." 
<H5>  The Experience </H5>
  It is now 12 years since that war, he says, and it is more 
prudent to live in the present. Relations with the British are 
"excellent," Balza declares. "The war is a thing of the past. We 
will never forget our dead, nor will the English; but the best 
thing we can do is to pray for our dead, and it does not matter 
if our prayers cover the English as well. That is the Christian 
spirit," he states. 
  He has not forgotten the experience the Armed Forces gained 
in that war, however. "One of the most important lessons the 
Falklands war taught the Army was never again to be forced to 
participate in activities beyond the scope of the role defined 
for us by the Constitution; never again to participate in 
politics," he says. 
  Undaunted, he claims that this experience simply brought the 
military back to its original role: obeying the Constitution and 
the law, but not intervening in politics. 
  Moments after the first question on the Falklands, however, 
he makes it clear he is interested in leaving the past behind 
and thinking of the future. Therefore, it is not a bad idea to 
ponder the possibility of a future coup d'etat. 
  Then his face hardens, and although he says that no one can 
guarantee the future, he rejects the notion that the Armed 
Forces would try to go against the constitutional order: "I will 
tell you right now: Disrupting the constitutional order in the 
Argentine Republic is definitely a thing of the past. We cannot 
reconstruct the past, but we can learn lessons from it and 
prevent the mistakes of the past from being repeated in the 
future. Argentina will never again see disruptions of the 
constitutional order. Not because of General Balza, but because 
the Armed Forces, the Security Forces, and Argentine society 
have incorporated that idea into their culture." 
  Now, he says, the Armed Forces' relations with the president 
are characterized by absolute cordiality and mutual respect. 
  General Balza could not fail to mention public order and the 
Argentine experience with violent urban guerrillas, the 
Montoneros of the 1970's. 
  "In the past, the country was the victim of a notorious 
aggression, and those were very painful years. This problem 
overwhelmed Argentine society, which did not support those who 
were threatening national values." 
  In view of his country's experience, the commander of the 
Army believes that it is possible to defeat unprincipled 
guerrillas. "It is my hope that fellow nations, in this case 
Colombia, can overcome this phenomenon."

  [Text] Cordoba, 28 Apr (NA) -- Local Federal Police 
detachment personnel have closed down two FM radio stations and 
two unlicensed television stations, and arrested Justicialist 
Party militant Luis Vanni for "resisting law-enforcement 
officers." 
  The Federal Police acted in compliance with a Federal Court 
warrant issued in light of a complaint filed by national 
telecommunications officials because the pirate stations were 
interfering with legal radio and television stations. 
  Luis Vanni is a controversial individual and the leader of 
the so-called "Vanni brigades" which have been involved in 
strange political events during elections. 
  As the federal agents closed down the illegal stations, they 
found Vanni at his private residence in Arguello district from 
where he operated these neighborhood media. Vanni tried to stop 
the officers from closing down the stations and had to be 
subdued. 
  He was arrested and taken to the local Federal Police 
station, charged with resisting law-enforcement officers. He 
was turned over to Federal Judge Raul Bustos Fierro.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 27 Apr (NA) -- Colonel Mohamed Ali 
Seineldin [the rebel leader of the 3 December 1990 military 
uprising] has "categorically" denied that the arsenal found on 
an island in the Tigre District belongs to the "Painted Faces" 
former rebel Army group. He flatly denied that an "operation" 
was being prepared on the island to liberate him from the 
Magdalena prison. 
  Seineldin's spokesman Santiago Cahil conveyed the former 
rebel leader's position to NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS, explaining that 
Seineldin characterized the report as "absurd and outrageous, 
totally lacking substance." 
  Cahil was the Justicialist Party mayor of the town of Moron 
between 1993 and 1994. He said that Seineldin considers the 
theory that the arsenal discovered by the Buenos Aires police 
belongs to the "Painted Faces" to be "an aberration" that merely 
illustrates the existence of "an evil service that seeks to 
besmirch the Army." 
  "To say that the `Painted Faces' have anything to do with 
this arsenal is a totally absurd and outrageous aberration. 
Seineldin told me that when he learned what was being said he 
did not whether to laugh or cry," the former Moron mayor said. 
  The spokesman for the rebel leader of the 3 December 1990 
uprising said: "All of them -- Colonel Seineldin and his 
comrades who are serving sentences with him -- have accepted 
their situation and decided not to leave (prison) through force. 
They never planned or even conceived anything like this." 
  According to Cahil, Seineldin said: "Some groups are 
determined to besmirch" his "name" and "the Army." Seineldin 
added that "without doubt an evil service is involved in this." 
  "No one in his right mind would ever believe (the painted 
faced rebels) built a training camp with a heliport in the 
delta, which is open to everyone," Cahil said. 
  The former mayor added that Seineldin categorically rejected 
the idea that an operation was being prepared in the island to 
liberate him, adding that all remarks on those lines are 
"groundless."

  [Excerpts] "The Socialist Left Front [FIS] electoral 
alliance was disbanded on 10 April. We will continue to work 
together on the agreed tasks, but as a front, it is disbanded." 
With these words, a spokeswoman of the Movement Toward 
Socialism (MAS) signed the death certificate for the front that 
groups Trotskyist leaning parties. The other two groups that 
made up the front -- the Socialist Movement of the Workers 
(MST), headed by Luis Zamora, and the Workers Party (PO), headed 
by Jorge Altamirano -- have decided to act jointly. As a first 
measure, on 1 May at 1500 there will be a commemoration of Labor 
Day at the Plaza de Mayo. The MAS will hold its own 
commemoration at the Boxing Federation. [passage omitted] 
  Thus, the Trotskyist alliance ends following its poor 
performance in the 10 April elections. It had been born in 
February. At the national level, the Trotskyists lost 31,000 
votes compared with the results they obtained in October 1993, 
with a large loss in the Federal Capital and especially in 
Greater Buenos Aires. In these two districts "the wave rolled 
toward the Grand Front and we could do nothing," a spokesperson 
acknowledged on 26 April, "but in the provinces of Jujuy, 
Neuquen, Salta, Santiago del Estero, and especially in Santa 
Cruz we increased our vote. There were workers' struggles in 
those provinces and it is no coincidence that we had better 
results there." In Santa Cruz Province the FIS obtained two 
seats in the Constituent Assembly, the only seats that it was 
able to gain in the whole country.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 26 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- The National 
Police announced today the arrest of two alleged assassins of 
Epaminondas Gonzalez, the Constitutional Court president, who 
was killed on 1 April. 
  Deputy Police Director Armando Orellana explained in a news 
conference that the detainees are brothers Marlon Oliver and 
Mario Rene Salazar Lopez. The arrest of the two alleged 
assassins of Gonzalez belong to a "well-organized band" of car 
thieves, and there is "enough evidence" of their alleged 
implication in the magistrate's murder, according to Orellana. 
The police added that Marlon was arrested on 11 April and Mario 
was arrested two days later in Monserrata neighborhood, southern 
Guatemala City. 
  According to Orellana, the masterminds of Gonzalez' 
assassination used a red Japanese-made car, which hours before 
the crime was stolen from Rolando San Ramon and was later 
intentionally set on fire. 
  In the vehicle [words indistinct] -- three remain to be 
seized -- and according to the investigations, Mario Oliver 
Salazar was the one who fired the .38-caliber automatic at 
Gonzalez for resisting the theft of his vehicle, according to 
the deputy police director. He explained, however, that it will 
be up to the courts to determine the responsibility of the 
Salazar Lopez brothers. 
  Gonzalez, the man who returned the country to a 
constitutional regime following the unsuccessful coup attempt 
perpetrated by ousted President Jorge Serrano on 25 May 1993, 
was assassinated at his home located in Zone 2 of the Guatemalan 
capital. 
  The vehicle used in the attack appeared two days later in 
the 
San Cristobal neighborhood in southern Guatemala City. On 15 
April the authorities announced the arrest of Geovanni Reyes, 
Abimael Samayoa, and Alfredo Santos Lopez, but Orellana said 
they have been unable to determine if they have any connection 
with the Salazar brothers.

  [Text] The Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) magistrates on 
24 April filed an appeal on the Supreme Court of Justice (CSJ) 
resolution temporarily suspending the legislative elections 
slated for 14 August. It has been reported that the appeal was 
filed at the CSJ Secretariat at 1845 local and that the file 
will be sent to the Constitutionality Court (CC) today. 
  Thus, the decision to continue the electoral process is in 
the hands of the CC magistrates, who should either confirm the 
provisional amparo ordered by the CSJ or amend it. The latter 
looks more likely, according to legal and political analysts. 
  On 22 April, the CSJ magistrates, acting as an amparo 
chamber, accepted the provisional amparo which Social Action 
Movement (MAS) Deputy Carlos Arroyave Cerna had requested saying 
he had been harmed by the TSE's call for the elections to be 
held on 14 August. This action interrupted the election 
process. The CC magistrates are expected to overrule the CSJ 
and rescind the resolution in a few hours, however. 
Consequently, the election process would continue while the 
provisional amparo filed by Deputy Arroyave follows its normal 
course. 
  The fact that the TSE magistrates have filed an appeal on 
the 
CSJ resolution means that they acted according to the 
Constitution and the law by calling the Guatemalan people to 
hold legislative elections to elect a congress of 80 deputies. 
  Democratic Union (UD) Party Deputy Luis Chea last night said 
he hopes the CC magistrates "will abide by the law and confirm 
the TSE's call for elections, which is according to the law." 
  Roberto Arana Espana of the Central Authentic Nationalist 
Party said: "The CC must rule favorably on the appeal filed by 
the TSE magistrates because the CC is the only institution 
backed by the people. It is the only body whose decisions are 
accepted by the people because the CC has always abided by the 
Constitution." Arana Espana added that the people are ready to 
participate in the elections on 14 August, "a historic date 
which will change the country's politics."

<F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Constitutionality Court will have to decide 
whether it will process the appeal filed by the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal against the temporary suspension of the 
election for new deputies. This issue aroused various reactions 
on Monday in judicial and political circles. National Congress 
President Vinicio Villar Anleu commented on the implications of 
the case: 
  [Begin recording] [Villar Anleu] It seems to us -- and we 
uphold Congress' institutional policy -- that the nation's laws 
must be respected and that the Constitution must be respected. 
In this case, we will obey any legal decision issued. What is 
interesting is that we are not only operating under a democratic 
process with a government that is respecting the Constitution, 
but we are also operating under a de jure state in which the 
decisions of various judicial institutions should prevail -- in 
other words, the decisions of the relevant courts. 
  In this case, a court issued a temporary amparo, and, 
because 
we live in a de jure state, we must obey it. This is a 
temporary amparo. A deeper analysis of the case must be made 
before a definite decision is handed down. The Congress, as an 
institution and as one of the three state branches, is willing 
to respect and always obey the legal opinions handed down by any 
court that has jurisdiction. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What is your opinion about the paid 
advertisement by Alvaro Arzu, one of the secretaries of the 
National Vanguard Party [PAN], who points out that the 
corruption in Congress and... 
  [Second unidentified reporter, interrupting] Saying it is 
responsible for the whole crisis... 
  [Villar Anleu, interrupting] I say what I have always said: 
We respect the opinion of any Guatemalan citizen. In this 
case, Mr. Alvaro Arzu, a citizen like any other, is expressing 
his opinion. This opinion must be respected. As president of 
the Congress, I do not share his opinion. I want to make it 
clear that the deputies were elected by the people during clean, 
democratic, completely legal, and crystal clear elections for a 
five-year term. This term is mandated by the Constitution. 
  As I have said before, in the spirit of helping this 
Congress, we have accepted -- after an agreement with the 
executive -- moving up the legislative elections. Nevertheless, 
the mandate was for five years, and in this case it was the 
people who elected us. If he says there has been 
irresponsibility on the part of the deputies, I would say it is 
the responsibility of all, including the deputies of his party 
-- that is, the PAN -- who resigned last year. They are also 
responsible for any political activity taking place in the 
nation. Therefore, I am sorry he has made these statements. I 
do not share his opinion, but I respect it. That is his 
opinion, and it must be respected. Well, when someone has money 
to spend, he can publish paid advertisements. 
  We, as an institution, respect everyone's opinion, even if 
we 
do not share it. We want to make very clear our position that 
we are complying with a mandate for the upcoming elections. We 
will respect the agreement made with the executive; however, we 
also respect the law and the Constitution. If a court issues a 
decision, we will obey it because we live in a de jure state.

Constitutionality Court (CC) reported today that the country's 
new Congress will be elected on 14 August, just as had been 
established by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE). 
  The CC turned down the temporary amparo granted by the 
Supreme Court of Justice (CSJ) to Deputy Carlos Arroyave against 
the TSE, whom he accused of violating his rights by calling 
parliamentary elections for 14 August. According to the 
resolution issued today, the CC turned down the amparo granted 
by the CSJ on 22 April because it considers the situation 
presented by Solidarity Action Movement Deputy Arroyave as 
"nonexistent."

  [Text] President Ramiro De Leon Carpio said that fiscal 
reforms are intended to ensure tax fairness. The president also 
denied that the reforms could undermine the Guatemalan 
population. 
  According to the president, extraordinary taxes will only 
affect approximately 3,000 persons and legal entities that earn 
more than 500,000 quetzals in income. Likewise, he indicated 
that "it is completely false that the reforms proposed last week 
will tax the majority of the population since the VAT 
[Value-Added Tax] remains at 7 percent and the only thing that 
is being sought is to widen the base rate. 
  He pointed out that if Congress does not pass the reforms 
proposed by the Executive Branch, tax evasion could total 250 
million quetzals during the year. De Leon Carpio also said that 
the government is under pressure to cut its liability and 
increase its revenues in order to be able to invest more in 
basic services that will benefit the population. "Hospitals and 
schools alone owe more than 1.2 billion quetzals to their 
creditors," he stipulated.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 28 Apr (AFP) -- President Carlos 
Roberto Reina said Thursday that the Honduran Armed Forces 
support his decision to eliminate compulsory military service, 
as announced on Wednesday night on a national radio and 
television network. The president told the press that after he 
announced his intention to submit to the National Congress a 
bill to remove forced recruitment from the Constitution, General 
Luis Alonso Discua, commander in chief of the Honduran Armed 
Forces, telephoned him to congratulate him. 
  He described as "part of the democratic give and take" the 
statements made Thursday by other top military leaders, 
reiterating their disagreement with the measure, which relieves 
young men between 18 and 30 years old from compulsory military 
service. 
  Reina's bill proposes instead the creation of "a voluntary, 
educational, social, humanistic, and democratic military 
service." 
  In addition, the deputies of the opposition National Party 
of 
Honduras said today they will have to review the bill with the 
military before it reaches the plenum of the legislative 
chamber. Constitutional amendments must be approved by 
two-thirds of the 128 deputies and must be ratified by the 
legislature the following year to enter into force. 
  Meanwhile, Gladys Lanza, one of 10 people who went on a 
hunger strike 10 days ago to pressure the government to repeal 
compulsory military service, told reporters she will not stop 
her fast until there is a final decision on the matter. 
  President Reina acknowledged today in remarks to the press 
that compulsory military service "has been terribly unjust," 
because it has only been imposed on the poor, and military 
chiefs themselves have admitted that young men in the batallions 
have been mistreated.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 28 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina today said he has begun "to establish order 
in democracy" in his country, and, alluding to the military, he 
stressed that he is the commander in chief of the Armed Forces. 
  Reina was questioned today by opposition politicians and 
local analysts, who suggested he remove Defense Minister General 
Reynaldo Andino from his post for disagreeing with the draft 
bill which the government sent to the National Congress to 
reform military service. 
  The reform changes compulsory military service to 
"voluntary, 
educational, social, humanistic, and democratic" service. 
According to Andino, the Armed Forces do not agree with the 
change, but will abide by the president's decision. 
  Those who are questioning Andino's remarks argue he has 
shown 
disrespect for the president's authority, because by law the 
military must be "apolitical, obedient, and nondeliberative," 
and, therefore, they feel the president should remove him from 
his post. 
  Reina said there is no insubordination on the part of the 
general and that everyone interprets the draft military service 
reform as he sees fit. 
  The president asked, "How can it be insubordination, when he 
is obeying the orders of his commander?" Reina also noted that 
any citizen can express doubts about the proposal, which, in his 
opinion, is a democratic right. 
  In referring to those people who contend the defense 
minister 
is defying his decision, Reina said, "It seems to me that this 
is not a correct interpretation, perhaps because of a lack of 
information or because they do not agree with what is being 
done." 
  The president said the draft bill on reforming military 
service was discussed with his cabinet ministers, his advisers, 
and the military command "until we reached a point of consensus." 
  Reina told newsmen that, after he announced that he had sent 
the draft bill to the legislature on Wednesday, he received a 
call from Divison General Luis Alonso Discua, the chief of the 
Armed Forces, "congratulating" him. 
  The president reiterated on three occasions that he is the 
Armed Forces commander in chief and that he is not afraid of 
being wrong, because it will be the National Congress which will 
open the debate on military service. 
  "The people are represented there in Congress, and if 
Congress rejects the proposal, then I will know that I have been 
mistaken," he said. 
  He also said the Armed Forces have admitted that the 
traditional military draft "was inappropriate, inadequate, and 
violated basic principles." 
  Reina maintains that military service "has only been 
compulsory for the poor" and that "terrible injustice was 
committed under the former system."

<F P=106> [Report by Glenda Moreno; from the "This Very Day" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The apparent confrontation between the civilian and 
military sector, generated by the proposal to have a volunteer 
educational, social, humanistic, and democratic military service 
by President Reina, and the dissenting remarks by Defense 
Minister Reinaldo Andino Flores, monopolized the news conference 
the president held today. 
  [Begin Reina recording] Every person interprets the matter 
based on this opinion. What does he mean? That he abides by 
it. He has a different opinion because he does not think the 
volunteer service can meet the needs. Some tried to say he was 
defying this decision. I feel this is not a proper 
interpretation. [end recording] 
  Throughout the news conference, Reina denied there was any 
insubordination on the part of Gen. Andino Flores. 
  [Begin recording] [Reina] Absolutely. How can that be 
insubordination, when he obeys the orders of his boss? 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [Reina] The president is the chief of the Honduran Armed 
Forces. [end recording] 
  What is important, the president said, is that the Executive 
Branch's bill was submitted today to the National Congress. The 
Legislative Branch will have to decide, he said, whether or not 
we are wrong. 
  [Begin Reina recording] I am not afraid of being wrong, 
because this goes to the National Congress, and it will debate 
it. One supposes that all the people are there. If the 
Congress rejects it, I will openly admit I was wrong. [end 
recording] 
  Although the topic of the volunteer, education, social, 
humanistic, and democratic military service monopolized the 
attention of the media, President Reina commented on other 
topics, such as the energy crisis. 
  [Begin Reina recording] Let me tell you that yesterday I 
spoke with the Mexican president. He offered us all his help, 
and if this works out we will overcome the crisis in a few days. 
He is offering two plants that generate 30 megawatts each. We 
will overcome the problem with those 60 megawatts. [end 
recording]

  [Text] General Humberto Ortega's replacement is ready. 
Sources close to the Presidential House have learned Major Gen. 
Joaquin Cuadra Lacayo will be promoted to lieutenant general of 
the Sandinist Army. He will be the highest-ranking officer in 
the country, second only to the general [Humberto Ortega], of 
course, who does not allow anyone to be his equal. 
  Sources very close to the Presidential House have leaked 
that 
President Violeta Barrios will announce, any moment now, the 
promotion of Major Gen. Joaquin Cuadra Lacayo to lieutenant 
general. Mrs. Barrios, as supreme commander of the Armed Forces 
and defense minister, has the constitutional power to grant this 
promotion, thus making Cuadra Lacayo the second highest-ranking 
officer, second to Humberto Ortega, who does not allow any 
officer to become his equal; that would be disrespectful. 
  It is believed this appointment represents a message to the 
U.S. Government about the changes Mrs. Barrios is making to the 
image of her country and government. Many see this as a maneuver 
that is taking place with the concurrence of Humberto Ortega, of 
course, who has just said at the Olof Palme Convention Center 
that anyone trying to change the correlation of forces would 
provoke further destabilization, which could lead to a new 
Nicaraguan civil war.

  [Text] Managua, 26 Apr (AFP) -- Although political violence 
decreased after the war ended four years ago, Nicaragua has 
registered an increase in common crimes to the point that even 
policemen are assaulted by criminals, National Police Chief 
Fernando Caldera admitted today. "Violent crime" is what 
worries the police most because although there has been a 
decrease in political violence generated by the war, the crime 
rate is swelling, Caldera stressed to AFP. 
  According to the officer, the growing crime rate is a result 
of "political violence, economic crisis, and the culture of 
violence" so entrenched in this country, which was at war 
throughout the entire past decade. The war between the contras 
and Sandinists left more than 50,000 victims, including dead, 
injured, crippled, as well as material losses amounting to the 
millions across the entire country. 
  According to a study carried out by the National Police, the 
public order situation changed "substantially" in 1990, both in 
magnitude and type, to include land and institution takeovers 
and public demonstrations and protests over government policies. 
  In 1990, when Violeta de Chamorro assumed control of the 
government, replacing the Sandinists and ending the war, there 
were 28,005 crimes. That number increased to 30,896 in 1991, 
35,924 in 1992, and 42,394 in 1993. In 1990, the police 
dismantled 125 criminal bands. In 1991, however, they 
dismantled 189; in 1992, 288; and in 1993, 363. In addition to 
the criminals in the cities, there are 500 armed men in the 
mountains who ravage the peasant population. In the first three 
months of 1994, the police reported dismantling 98 bands; a 
31-percent higher rate than last year. During those four years, 
authorities solved 3,320 crimes and arrested a total of 3,946 
criminals, many who are repeat offenders. 
  Furthermore, in 1990, among other reasons because controls 
were reduced, drug crimes increased a substantial 120 percent, 
according to the National Police. In 1991, authorities seized 
730 kg of cocaine, 155 kg in 1992, 97 kg in 1993, and up to now 
in 1994, 1,100 kg of the drug have been seized. Murders have 
also increased since 1990 when 202 people were slain. In 1991, 
the number was 259; in 1992, 325; and in 1993, 331.

<F P=106> [Report by Cesar Ubeda Bravo] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal said Central America, 
especially Nicaragua, requires a transition period that would 
allow the region to maintain its competitiveness while 
negotiating joining NAFTA, which was signed by the United 
States, Canada, and Mexico. Minister Leal, who met with the 
American Chamber of Commerce yesterday, said this transition 
period is required by NAFTA and is necessary because of the 
special conditions of the region, which is leaving behind a 
period of wars and conflicts. 
  He said that in a prudent amount of time -- three years -- 
the Central American economies should adjust themselves to the 
transformations that are taking place, allowing the countries to 
maintain current preferences and to have access to the same 
preferences so they can join NAFTA after the transition period. 
  The chief of Nicaraguan diplomacy said that with the signing 
of the treaty, Central America is at a serious disadvantage with 
Mexico. "With the implementation of NAFTA this year, Central 
America runs the risk of losing its preferential conditions for 
access to the U.S. market. This is because the reduction of 
tariffs in this treaty is automatic for 84 percent of Mexican 
products," he indicated. For the Central American isthmus, 20.1 
percent of exports to the United States have a tariff treatment 
with preferences assigned by the Caribbean Basin Initiative 
[CBI], the Generalized System of Preferences (SGP), and the 
Assembly Plant [Maquila] Regimen. 
  During a meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
dignitaries of the Central American region and the Belizean 
prime minister, a high-level commission was created that will be 
in charge of the follow-up work on the CBI and Central America's 
adherence to this extremely important treaty. "It must be noted 
that the leading products exported to the United States are 
agriculture and textile products. It is precisely in these 
sectors that our relative competitiveness with regard to the 
same products of Mexican origin are adversely affected," Leal 
said. 
  He added that the seriousness of this situation not only 
consists of the fact that Mexico is joining the U.S. market, but 
that it also enjoys a preference that is far beyond the usual 
tariff treatment. "NAFTA encompasses, in addition to tariff 
aspects, the so-called nontariff barriers. It also includes 
specific provisions regarding investments," he pointed out. He 
added that the CBI lacks these additional benefits, "which 
constitutes a severe disadvantage for Central American products. 
It will allow Mexico to compete under better conditions." 
  He said NAFTA will grant Mexico preferential treatment on 
sugar, which will make the country a net exporter of the 
product. As for the textile sector, he indicated that the 
treaty allows 45 percent of Mexican exports to the United States 
to enjoy a zero tariff, which means Mexico will have an 
advantage over Central American products in the U.S. market. 
Finally, he called upon the businessmen to support the treaty 
signed by the northern countries.

  [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (DPA) -- Despite a strong police and 
military presence in Bolivian cities since early this morning, 
demonstrations were held in several cities but were violently 
dispersed. Meanwhile, surveys taken by several La Paz radio 
stations regarding the social situation indicate that most urban 
residents are asking for a state of siege "once and for all." 
  Lupe Cajis, the president of the La Paz Journalist 
Association, told DPA that "the people are clamoring for a state 
of siege." People called the radio stations to decry the acts of 
vandalism by the demonstrators, who -- according to the radio 
stations' listeners -- loot and destroy everything in their path 
as they flee from the police tear gas. 
  The authorities used tear gas today to disperse several 
attempts by the workers to gather at different points of La Paz. 
"We are virtually living under a state of siege, the only thing 
missing is an official declaration," a top opposition leader 
said. 
  The state of emergency measure was expected tonight, but the 
government of Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada decided at the last 
moment not to implement it. Incidents of abuse by the men in 
uniform against civilians not participating in the 
demonstrations have been reported. Soldiers and policemen were 
deployed in Bolivian cities in the early morning hours to 
prevent workers rallies and demonstrations. 
  The Bolivian Labor Federation (COB) has been on an 
indefinite 
general strike since 15 April demanding a wage increase above 
the 8 percent included in the general budget approved last week. 
Several observers agree that the moderate COB leaders have been 
overrun by extremists.

  [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (AFP) -- The authorities have 
reported that Armed Forces troops moved on Thursday to prevent 
striking peasants and teachers from establishing roadblocks on 
highways and railroads across Bolivia. The strikers are 
demanding salary increases. 
  Some observers say the tense situation has submerged the 
nation in a kind of semi state of siege. This forced President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's government to deploy some 30,000 
troops, who were ordered to act decisively to maintain peace. 
  First official reports indicate that the worst conflicts 
occurred in Santa Cruz Department, in the east. Peasant union 
demonstrators tried to block the railroads leading to Argentina 
and Brazil, and the highways that join that tropical city with 
Angostura and Chapare. 
  A police source said there is still no official word on 
arrests or other incidents. The source said security forces 
cleared the expressways of rocks and logs the strikers placed 
across them to pressure the government into accepting their 
demands. Another roadblock was removed from the highway that 
connects La Paz with the mountain regions of Oruro. 
  The authorities reported that the flow of traffic in and out 
of La Paz and the rest of the country is normal, according to a 
responsible source, who said the troops maintain control at 
points where strikers were trying to erect roadblocks. 
  In La Paz, police patrolling was doubled in view of the 
threat by 10,000 peasants to stage a march on the city to 
protest the government's refusal to grant their wage demands, 
which have been capitalized on by the Bolivian Labor Federation 
with a 24-day strike. 
  The conflict worsened last Friday after one of the street 
protests degenerated into disturbances with rock throwing and 
looting of businesses and vehicles, resulting in tens of persons 
injured and 27 arrested. Also, on Sunday and Monday the police 
forced a dozen hunger strikers to suspend their 20-day strike 
and admitted them to clinics for medical attention. 
  Although the chief of state had warned a few days ago that 
if 
the situation worsened the government might be forced to impose 
a state of siege, some analysts believe that the labor and 
opposition pressure appears to want to force Sanchez de Lozada 
into adopting that extreme measure. 
  The Catholic Church, whose mediation was requested by COB 
leaders, voiced "its exasperation" in view of the "deafness" of 
the labor leaders and government to find a solution to the 
conflict. "If there are two deaf people, who want to speak, the 
church cannot be in the middle screaming," Apostolic Nuncio 
Giovanni Tonucci remarked, saying that there was no room for 
dialogue. "If there is deafness on both sides, it seems to be 
that it is futile and ridiculous to ask the church to mediate," 
he said.

  [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (DPA) -- While the Bolivian 
Government ruled out the possibility of decreeing the use of 
force to neutralize the growing wave of protests by workers, who 
are demanding wage raises, opposition congressmen today 
interpreted the movement of military troops as a "virtual state 
of siege." 
  Hugo Carvajal, deputy and leader of the Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left (MIR), said the troop movement is a measure 
"to intimidate citizens and prevent democratic demonstrations 
against the government's economic programs. He said that the 
government is desperate to apply measures such as the 
capitalization and popular participation plan, which together 
with the general budget, are not to the citizens' liking. 
Carvajal maintains that the government is wrong to think that 
it should apply the parliamentary-majority steamroller, without 
reaching a minimum of consensus or engaging in constructive 
dialogue. 
  On his part, Eduardo Paz, a Conscience of the Fatherland 
(Condepa) congressman, said that Sanchez de Lozada is governing 
with a stick in his hand, not only "hitting at the stomachs of 
the poor," but also "repressing their democracy." He said that 
the government is attempting to scare the people, making 
military troops go out on the streets to face workers and 
provoke "hours and days of bloodshed and mourning." 
  Meanwhile, Fernando Kieffer, a Nationalist Democratic Action 
(ADN) Party deputy, said the government of President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada "adopted the easiest way to intimidate union 
leaders and repress workers." He noted that the Executive 
Branch "is acting illegally in dispersing workers, who were on a 
peaceful hunger strike, and ordering military troops to go out 
on the streets without declaring a state of siege."

  [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (AFP) -- Since dawn today, Bolivian 
Army troops have been patrolling the streets of La Paz, the seat 
of the government, as well as interstate highways throughout the 
country to maintain public order and to prevent roadblocks by 
peasant union members and rural teachers. 
  Social Communications Minister Ernesto Machicao has said the 
government of Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada yesterday announced the 
deployment of 30,000 men, including military agents and 
policemen, to urban and rural communities to guarantee "free 
movement and security," but he rejected the possibility of 
eventually implementing a state of siege, "because this is a 
drastic measure that is not yet necessary." 
  The government's preventive measures are in response to the 
tense atmosphere the country has experienced over the past 24 
days because of actions by the Bolivian Labor Federation (COB), 
which is demanding wage increases by declaring a widespread and 
indefinite strike and a hunger strike by more than 2,000 union 
leaders throughout the country and by blocking roads, which 
agricultural sectors were supposed to begin today. 
  Agricultural leader Felix Santos said about 10,000 peasants 
from the La Paz high plateau, valley, and subtropical zone will 
arrive in La Paz today to join the COB activities. 
  Meanwhile, the COB announced that negotiations with the 
government will resume today, but executive branch officials 
warned they will not attend the talks as long as the union does 
not end its pressure tactics. 
  Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters criticized the COB's 
uncompromising position -- namely, its demand to increase wages 
by more than the 8 percent increase in the minimum wage offered 
by the government -- because it "lacks solid foundations, and 
because it is not stipulated in the annual budget drafted and 
approved by the government."

  [Excerpts] We are going to start by repeating what we have 
time and again said here over the past few days: We are going 
through a tense social situation, which is marked by not 
entirely successful attempts to set up roadblocks. There is, 
above all, an atmosphere of uncertainty and insecurity. Workers 
have clashed with government forces on the streets using the 
technique of organizing in cell-style picketing groups. There 
are talks under way aimed at starting negotiations between the 
government and the Bolivian Labor Federation [COB], but no 
progress has yet been made in addressing substantive issues. 
While the situation is not new, it is worrisome just the same. 
  Violence took hold on the streets of La Paz this afternoon. 
Union leaders, policemen, and even common criminals participated 
in acts of violence. 
  The COB rally scheduled for this afternoon in San Francisco 
Square was not held. Police took positions over the entire city 
of La Paz, and prevented every form of street protest. As soon 
as a group of workers began to convene, police were already 
dispersing them. 
  Demonstrators moved toward the northern part of the city, 
where they continued to fight police personnel. Dozens of 
people were arrested. 
  The situation was altogether different at the Lima police 
precinct. There the ones who were surrounded were the 
policemen. The actions there were in no way related to the COB 
social struggle, let alone with the struggle waged by the unions 
of rural and urban teachers, who in recent times have often 
taken to the streets of La Paz. In this case, common criminals 
surrounded the Lima precinct to release their fellow criminals 
who were being held at the precinct. [passage omitted] 
  The criminals managed to open the cell, but there was only 
one prisoner there. Their next move was to try to hang the 
policemen, who locked themselves up in the precinct office. 
[passage omitted] 
  Finally, reinforcements managed to rescue the Lima precinct 
police personnel. 
  Disturbances in La Paz continued until very late. The 
demonstrators damaged several buses. You are now watching a 
clip of (Higuino Square), where the police dispersed one of the 
many groups of demonstrators and cleared the street for traffic. 
  No one was spared from the acts of violence on Peru Avenue, 
not even reporters. Three journalists and a press car were 
attacked this afternoon by rural teachers on Peru Avenue, where 
window panes were shattered and the windshields of cars and 
buses were broken. [passage omitted] 
  This time the demonstrators acted in small groups, giving no 
quarter to police. The clip you are watching took place near 
the court house, where the air was filled with tear gas. In the 
meantime, the last eight people still under arrest for breaking 
windshields and windows during the rural teachers demonstration 
on 22 April requested that the Fourth Criminal Court judge set 
them free during a habeas corpus hearing. Judge Lidia Molina 
upheld their request, and ordered that they all be released. 
[passage omitted] 
  The rural teachers have announced that they will file 
another 
habeas corpus petition to obtain the release of those arrested 
this afternoon.

  [Text] The meeting between the COB [Bolivian Labor 
Federation] and the government is being held openly, in the 
presence of reporters, at the Labor Ministry. The real 
negotiations have not yet begun. Let us listen to the positions 
of the two parties. First, Carlos Camargo of the COB: 
  [Begin Camargo recording] The COB has made a national 
proposal, and has been patiently waiting, without putting on any 
pressure, in the hope that the government would reply in a 
positive manner. This is an attitude that shows the willingness 
of the COB to talk. We did not implement measures first, and 
them submit the COB proposal. I would also like to point out 
before the public that in the case of La Paz, where regrettable 
events took place this afternoon, there was no provocation from 
the workers. The provocation came from the government, the 
police, and the Armed Forces. [end recording] 
  Let us listen now to the government representative, Human 
Development Minister Enrique Ipina: 
  [Begin Ipina recording] The government does not accept, and 
will not accept, the formal resumption of talks if there is no 
constructive and positive spirit for lifting the coercive 
measures. We reiterate the terms of our letter of 24 April, and 
expect from the COB, the lifting of all coercive measures 
without exception, as an essential condition, as absolutely 
necessary, for contributing to social peace and demonstrating to 
the world that Bolivians can understand each other without 
threats of any kind. We believe, we are convinced, that we need 
the lifting of all coercive measures, without exception, as a 
prior condition. [end recording]

  [Text] According to Peasant Leader Juan de la Cruz Villca, 
50 roadblocks have been established nationwide. Contrary to the 
government's assessment, peasants have indicated that the road 
blockade was a true success on its first day. 
  [Begin Villca recording, in progress] ...we have information 
on hand about 50 roadblocks. This means that over 150,000 
fellow peasants are taking part in this nationwide mobilization. 
Moreover, the military have been mobilized all over. 
  The main road blocks that have been set up are: in Santa 
Cruz 
Department: Angostura, Sevaruyo, Yapayapa, Ivirganzama, Bulu 
Bulu; (Chifarsama), near Tropico Cochabamba; in Cochabamba 
Department: (Parautani), the entire highway; in Oruro Deparment: 
Caracollo. From (?Cruce Machamarca) we have reports that 
despite the presence of tanks, one of which turned over while 
transporting soldiers, fellow peasants have established 
roadblocks along the entire highway. 
  Peasants have also established roadblocks in Potosi 
Department, near (Ipalla), near Tarija. Moreover, fellow 
peasants from Chuquisaca have been established on all local 
roads. 
  This is why we are saying that the rejection of the 
government's intention to commercialize land has been truly 
successful. [end recording] 
  Peasants and Army personnel this afternoon engaged in a 
violent clash in Chapare Region, Cochabamba Department. 
Desiderio Choque, leader of the United Central Federation 
[Federacion Central Unidas] reported that no serious injuries 
were reported among peasants, and that despite the clash, the 
roadblocks have not been lifted. 
  [Begin Choque recording, in progress] ...today there was a 
regrettable clash when we were staging a nationwide road 
blockade in compliance with instructions put forth by the 
National Confederation of Bolivian Peasant Workers. 
  This incident occurred at 2130 GMT. The clash lasted 30 
minutes. It ended at 2200 GMT. However, our fellow peasants are 
stronger than ever, and we are continuing with the road 
blockades, that is, the roadblocks have not been lifted. [end 
recording]

  [Text] According to government officials, today's road 
blockade has failed. Social Communications Minister Ernesto 
Machicado said that roadblocks were set up only in some parts of 
the country: 
  [Begin Machicado recording] Our overall impression is that 
as 
a whole, the 10 national highways were not cut off by roadblocks. 
  However, I am now going to itemize the roadblocks that were 
set up along specific points of the highways. This morning I 
reported that a roadblock was set up in (Puentevilla), in the 
Yungas region. This roadblock lasted all day long. 
  Roadblocks were set up all morning on the railroad tracks in 
Oruro Department. Railroad tracks were also blockaded nearby 
Vilavila. A roadblock was set up in Villa Tunari, in Cochabamba 
Department. However, it is important to note that this part of 
the highway is being repaired, because it was damaged. 
Therefore, a few days ago National Road Service closed transit 
through this highway. Therefore, this roadblock did not have 
any impact whatsoever on traffic. 
  In Santa Cruz Department, roadblocks were set up in 
(Pomarapa) during the morning; and also in La Angostura up to 
2100 GMT. 
  In Chuquisaca Department, roadblocks were set up all day 
long 
in Luis Calvo Province, in (?Monteburro) and Muyupampa. 
  As we have already reported, in Potosi Department roadblocks 
were set up at the (Cruce de Machas) intersection and 
(?Petanzos). Both of these roadblocks were dispersed this 
afternoon. 
  In Tarija Department, all (?streets) were blocked throughout 
the morning. These are specific areas. 
  As I reported beforehand, if we review the situation of 
roads 
nationwide, we can conclude there was no generalized blockade of 
national highways. [end recording]

  [Text] After releasing a detailed report on the regrettable 
incidents that were reported on 28 April, Social Communications 
Minister Ernesto Machicado asked the Bolivian Labor Federation 
[COB] leaders to overcome these attitudes that cause so much 
damage to the Bolivian family. 
  These images clearly indicate what happened in the city of 
La 
Paz on 28 April following the COB-sponsored workers 
mobilizations. 
  Without attributing responsibility to either side, and 
merely 
viewing the responsibility of the authorities in handling the 
situation the best way possible, Social Communications Minister 
Ernesto Machicado regretted the incidents at Government House. 
He singled out these attitudes that caused these extremely 
serious criminal actions against private property and 
individuals. Machicado also asked the COB leaders to ponder and 
overcome these attitudes, which, on occasions like this, are 
used by some criminal sectors. 
  [Begin Machicado recording] For example, what happened here 
at Government House, is (?extremely regrettable). The fact that 
a journalist from Radio Nueva America has been injured by a 
stone thrown by someone is extremely regrettable. 
  I, the social communications minister, who has permanent 
ties 
with the media, did not expect this to happen, particularly to 
someone who was doing her job. 
  [Words indistinct] and journalist [name indistinct] was hit 
by a stone. It is very regrettable that the police [words 
indistinct] and seriously injured. 
  Following the destruction and the fires, the three detainees 
who had been detained on the streets for common law offense 
escaped. They fled and the police [words indistinct]. About 10 
vehicles were destroyed [words indistinct]. I was close by and 
[words indistinct]. This is very unpleasant information. 
  Both the labor minister and the human development minister 
repeatedly asked not to include special measures in the talks 
[with the COB]. There were no special measures. The events 
have shown that this is not merely a whim because the government 
has no reason to be whimsical. 
  We merely sought to [words indistinct] for the talks to be 
fruitful because [words indistinct] on the one hand, they 
implement pressure measures, and, on the other hand, they 
participate in talks [words indistinct]. This shows a 
contradiction in terms: To be a friend and to not be a friend at 
the same time. [end recording]

Paz, includes video statements of Bolivian Labor Federation, COB

  [Text] [Unidentified reporter] Several COB leaders have 
lamented the administration's decision to order police and 
military forces to take action against the demonstrators 
throughout the country to prevent road blocks and street 
marches. Vladimir Terceros, one of the leaders, stated that the 
workers have the right to stage demonstrations in order to get 
the government to pay more attention to their demands. 
  [Terceros] As we see it, the workers are taking steps to 
compel the administration to heed their requests. Meanwhile the 
peasants are also on the move and will stage their own 
demonstrations because we believe that in a state of law we are 
entitled to express our opinions and positions, especially since 
we are enjoying a democracy which is an achievement of Bolivian 
workers and people, not of the individuals who now claim credit 
for it without having done anything to bring it about. 
  [Reporter] COB Executive Secretary Oscar Salas asked the 
government not to pit police and military forces against the 
workers and to prevent bloodshed. 
  [Salas] The Army must not be pitted at the people, nor 
should 
it be allowed to become an instrument of repression of the 
people. We are asking the Army not to do this. 
  [Reporter] The union leaders are perfectly aware of all the 
problems that the demonstrations can cause, but they also know 
that the workers need a sizable salary hike.

<F P=106> [Commentary by announcer Carlos Mesa] </F>
  [Text] As you saw in this newscast, the situation is not 
improving. On the contrary, the situation is getting worse, in 
an environment of uncertainty, in the clashes in the main cities 
and on the roads of the country. 
  The government has not implemented a state of siege, but it 
is at an intermediate point, as putting troops on the streets 
already illustrates the concern and inability of the police to 
take complete control of the situation. I would not say there 
is internal commotion, but the situation is reaching worrisome 
levels. 
  The experience suffered by our colleague Cathia Rodriguez, 
which you saw at the beginning of this newscast, was risky for 
her personal safety because of the actions of common criminals, 
thugs, who tried to lynch the policemen who were working in an 
office in La Paz. This event shows that the situation is 
beginning to get out of hand. I don't want to be an alarmist, 
but this is worrisome. I believe there is little flexibility 
from the government over negotiations that could provide some 
option, some solution. 
  The Bolivian Labor Federation says it will not negotiate 
under current conditions. The pressures are increasing, and the 
government is beginning to face reality. It is up against the 
wall, although paradoxically it holds the power. It opposes the 
state of siege, but this could be a way out. But if the overall 
situation is one of uncertainty and permanent confrontation, the 
government will not achieve its goals. Deputy Ferrufino clearly 
said: We are worried because of our impossibility of resolving 
the problems. 
  It is time for the government to realize that the discovery 
of a solution is in its hands, and this depends on a minimum of 
flexibility, which we believe it lacks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Cochabamba tropical region peasant leader </F>
Evo Morales by Jaime Murillo in El Chapare -- live] 
  [Text] [Murillo] We are talking with peasant leader Evo 
Morales. Can you tell us what is going on in Villa Tunari? We 
heard that many people are worried because traffic to Santa Cruz 
has been interrupted. 
  [Morales] Yes, since 0200 yesterday all national roads have 
been blocked. It is true that traffic to many places, that is 
to Santa Cruz or San Pedro de Cochabamba, has been interrupted. 
Within this framework, I heard that the [word indistinct] 
passengers are holding Villa Tunari mayor, who belongs to the 
MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] hostage in demand for a 
solution to this problem, that is, they are helping him find a 
solution. [as heard] 
  Evidently other people, including women and children, are 
worried about this. We are seeking a solution to the problem of 
people who must urgently travel to Santa Cruz and Cochabamba. 
  [Murillo] We have heard that some pregnant women are not 
receiving medical attention in the Villa Tunari health units. 
  [Morales] This is totally false. We are the ones who are 
making the medical attention possible. Fortunately, the doctor 
of Villa Tunari is my friend. He attended me after I was 
attacked by Umopar [Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas] agents 
in 1989. He is a great friend of mine and therefore he is 
giving medical attention in the most direct and practical manner 
in the area. 
  [Murillo] Will traffic be opened for people who have an 
emergency? 
  [Morales] We are authorizing transshipments to Santa Cruz 
and 
Cochabamba, but nothing more can be done. Yesterday it was 
still possible to travel because the Cochabamba-Villa Tunari 
road was not blocked. Blockades began last night. [words 
indistinct] There are some drivers who want to continue with 
their personal business rather than to protect the lives of 
women and children and they are trying to discredit and force 
the lifting of road blockades. 
  [Murillo] What is the situation now in tropical Cochabamba 
region? We understand there are 20 injured individuals as 
consequence of a clash that took place yesterday. 
  [Morales] I have heard nothing from Bulu Bulu and 
Ivirganzama. However, there was a clash in Sinaota at about 1700 
or 1800 yesterday when the Sole Federation of United Centrals 
and the Sinaota people began blocking the roads. Two U.S. DEA 
vehicles were stopped. They were carrying DEA members, that is, 
gringos. They asked for reinforcements to recover their 
freedom. Umopar agents came to help them and the DEA agents 
were freed. The road blockade was later reinstated in Sinaota. 
I have no information about injured people. In Villa Tunari, 
the Federation of Tropical Region Peasants is totally optimistic 
regarding the road blockades. They are proud and have stamina 
to continue imposing the road blockade. We will meet at 0800 to 
plan and organize many more actions. We will establish shifts 
to guarantee the road blockade. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Felix Salazar in Oruro] </F>
  [Text] Heavily armed military troops have prevented several 
attempts by peasants and rural teachers to block roads. Traffic 
on the Oruro-La Paz road was maintained although the flow 
dropped considerably because bus drivers suspended services to 
safeguard their buses. 
  In Caracollo, 37 km from Oruro, peasants and students were 
prevented from blocking the road toward the south. After being 
briefly blocked, a military presence now guarantees the free 
flow of traffic. 
  Peasants blocked the Oruro-Cochabamba road, suspending all 
traffic. The traffic police have reported that the peasants 
broke the windshields of three buses and demanded money to let 
them pass. It has been announced that inter-department bus 
services will be totally normalized today. 
  While there was military presence on the roads yesterday, 
the 
situation in the cities was totally calm, contrary to previous 
days when many demonstrations were held. 
  Railway services are working normally but under military 
custody. Yesterday peasants had to lift their blockade in 
Banderani and Cona Cona stations on the Oruro-Cochabamba railway 
stretch due to the presence of military troops. 
  The national railway service operations manager reported 
that 
services are being provided normally, although every train is 
guarded by military troops. 
  Private school classes were suspended today for 24-hours as 
determined by the Private School Teachers Association in support 
for the urban teachers' demands.

<F P=106> [Article by Cynthia Malta] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Brazil is proposing to its 
Common Market of the South [Mercosur] partners -- Argentina, 
Paraguay, and Uruguay -- the establishment of stricter rules for 
certificates of origin. These rules would go into effect in 
1995, by which time the four countries will be exchanging 
products without charging customs fees. The current rules 
contemplate a minimum national content of 50 percent in each 
product, with the possibility that the tariff may be changed. 
Ambassador Paulo Nogueira Batista, the Brazilian representative 
before the Latin American Integration Association [ALADI] in 
Montevideo, has said that Brazil proposes increasing this 
percentage to 75 percent and demands that product 
classifications be modified. He said that if it is not possible 
to enforce stricter rules, the trade of vehicles within the 
Mercosur would continue via import quotas, even after January 
1995. 
  The Brazilian Government may begin to negotiate a bilateral 
free trade agreement for the implementation of the South 
American Free Trade Area [SAFTA] without affecting its trade 
within Mercosur. Ambassador Nogueira Batista pointed out that 
the Asuncion Treaty, which created the Mercosur, allows this 
initiative. Interested countries can present exception lists on 
which certain products would be protected by higher tariffs. 
The remaining products would have zero tariffs for 10 years as 
of January 1995. Jorge Campbell, Argentine secretary for 
international economic relations, has reservations about the 
negotiation of accords to create SAFTA. He said: "The countries 
that negotiate these accords will have access to an agreement 
which took us a long time to negotiate."

  [Text] Doctor Elisaldo de Araujo Carlini is the first 
Brazilian to occupy a seat on the famous INCB [International 
Narcotics Control Board]. This organization, which controls 
narcotics and psychotropic drugs worldwide, is linked to the 
United Nations. Carlini was chosen on 19 April during the third 
round of elections and was appointed World Health Organization 
representative at the INCB. He disputed the position with 
representatives of the PRC and the Philippines. He will be 
installed in Vienna during the second half of the year. 
  Carlini has a well-defined line of action and wants to urge 
Brazil to comply with the international treaty terms that force 
countries to report on their production, import, and consumption 
of drugs that affect the brain and create addiction, such as 
morphine byproducts and psychotropic substances. Carlini 
criticized: "For three years, Brazil has been sending incomplete 
reports to the INCB or not sending reports at all." Brazil has 
never before been represented on the INCB (which comprises 13 
members with 5-year mandates), but has signed the 1961 and 1971 
conventions that establish rules to control drug circulation 
worldwide. 
  Carlini said: "I will press the Board to adopt a firmer 
position regarding Brazil." Carlini is a psycho-pharmacist and 
a professor at the Sao Paulo Medical School. He founded the 
Brazilian Center for Information on Psychotropic Drugs and has 
published nearly 200 papers on controlled drugs.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 28 April: 
  Telebras, Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc., has opened the 
social capital of its state subsidiaries expecting to make $260 
million this year. This was announced yesterday when the 
company announced its 1993 balance which showed a $1.143 billion 
net profit. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 21 
Apr 93 p B7) 
  Yesterday, the government reduced the import duty on 17 
products to 2 percent. Economic Policy Secretary Winston 
Fritsch said the objective is to warn national industry from 
committing price abuses. The products are soluble coffee; soft 
drinks; beer; cheese and milk byproducts; sugar; tire tubes for 
cars and trucks; tires for cars, trucks, and tractors; car 
generators and dynamos; disc plows; lampblack; ceramic bathroom 
parts; shaving machines; shaving cream; razor blades; oil; 
olives; and seeds and plants. Import duty on aluminum cans and 
condoms were reduced to zero. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in 
Portuguese 21 Apr 94) 
  Central Bank net dollar purchases totaled $1.7 billion in 
March, while international cash reserves grew by $1.4 billion in 
February, to reach $30.5 billion. At the end of January, cash 
reserves stood at $29.1 billion. Liquid reserves, which include 
medium and long-term credits, delayed credits, and provisions 
for the return of capital, stood at $36.5 billion at the end of 
February, while at the end of January they stood at $35.4 
billion. The Central Bank bulletin states that the slower 
reserve growth compared to January, when reserves grew by $3.2 
billion, was caused by a drop in the exchange operations surplus 
registered in February. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in 
Portuguese 22 Apr 94 p B6) 
  German enterprises control 1,027 enterprises in Brazil. This 
is equivalent to 12 percent of the 8,567 foreign capital 
enterprises registered in Brazil. Germans control 65, 47, and 
35 percent, respectively, of the car parts, vehicle, and 
medicine sectors. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 
23 Apr 94 p B2) 
  Yesterday, Citibank Senior Vice President Alcides Amaral 
said 
Brazil is again being granted short-term credits. He estimated 
that so far the country has obtained short-term credits worth 
$16 billion, especially for financing exports. The flow of 
short-term credits increased after Brazil began to negotiate its 
foreign debt. In connection with Brazil's debt to private banks, 
on the day the debt negotiation was concluded, the country 
received $352 million. Of this, Citibank provided $220 million.

    [Editorial Report] RUSSIAN ENVOY ON TRADE OBSTACLES, SPACE 
PROJECTS -- Russian Ambassador to Brazil Iosif N. Podrazhanets, 
who recently assumed the post, believes that it will be very 
difficult to raise the level of commercial trade between the two 
countries, currently ranging between $300 million and $400 
million, the Sao Paulo daily GAZETA MERCANTIL reported in its 31 
March-4 April issue. The reasons were cited as threefold: 
political instability in Russia, which keeps Brazilian investors 
away; shipping costs, which are higher than in the trade between 
Brazil and the United States; and a deficiency in providing 
sufficient stimulus to the space sector. Russia, GAZETA 
continued, is determined to cooperate with Brazil in creating an 
infrastructure by supplying technology and equipment for the 
satellite launch vehicle project. Russia also wants to 
participate in the Amazon protection and surveillance project, 
but it lacks the resources to finance equipment sales. 
  The protocol of intent, signed between Brazil and Russia in 
December 1993 and intended to increase bilateral trade to $2 
billion annually, has not yet "gotten off the ground," according 
to Ambassador Podrazhanets, due to difficulties in finding the 
mechanisms necessary to implement the project, particularly 
resources. "It's difficult to find the right products for that 
type of trade," he said. 
  In May or June, Podrazhanets continued, the Russian minister 
of atomic energy will visit Brazil, and in the ensuing months, a 
joint economic and commercial commission meeting will be held, 
during which Russia will discuss its interest in increasing 
cooperation in the areas of space, energy, and mining. 
  CUBA SIGNS S&amp;T ACCORDS WITH STATE GOVERNMENTS -- An 
article 
in the Sao Paulo daily O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO of 22 March 
announced that the Cuban and Sao Paulo State Governments will 
begin an S&amp;T exchange program in April that will bring a 
number 
of Cuban specialists to Sao Paulo state universities. In the 
article, Secretary Roberto Muller of the Secretariat of Science, 
Technology, and Economic Development remarked: "We are 
particularly interested in the transfer of Cuban technology for 
the development of research in DNA and genetic engineering for 
plants." The exchange program is a result of discussions held on 
18 March between visiting Cuban Minister of Higher Education 
Fernando Vecino Alegret and Secretary Muller, University of 
Campinas (Unicamp) Rector Carlos Vogt, and Sao Paulo State 
University (Unesp) Rector Arthur Roquete de Macedo. Secretary 
Muller further commented that the Sao Paulo state government is 
also interested in the use of sugarcane waste to generate 
thermal energy, as well as the mastery of techniques to increase 
the shelf life of cement. The agreement signed with Cuba was 
modeled along the lines of the accord signed with the Russian 
Government, O ESTADO continued. According to Muller, the 
secretariat is already studying the possibility of bringing in 
additional researchers, and will shortly be meeting with 
university rectors to review the situation. 
  CONSORTIUMS PLAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES LAUNCH -- Sao 
Paulo daily FOLHA DE SAO PAULO reported on 25 March that 
Brazilian Discount Bank (Bradesco), Odebrecht construction firm, 
Monteiro Aranha, Victori Internacional, and Globopar, owned by 
businessman Roberto Marinho, formed an association with the 
French Matra Marconi Space firm, and established an enterprise 
called Latin American Satellite Systems Communications (CLASS) 
for the purpose of launching three privately owned satellites to 
serve Brazil and neighboring Southern Cone countries. A second 
consortium, formed by the Itamaraty Group owned by businessman 
Olacyr de Morais, Splice do Brasil, and the German firm Deutsche 
Aerospace will compete for the same market acting as an 
associate and commercial representative of the Argentine Nahuel 
satellite. 
  The two consortiums, according to FOLHA, want to compete 
with 
the Brazilian Telecommunications Company (Embratel) in data 
transmission and offer options for new services, particularly in 
the area of cable television. Both the Nahuel satellite and the 
three satellites of the CLASS project will operate on the KU 
band, which is higher than the frequencies of Brasilsat's C 
band, and will allow TV signals to be picked up by 6O-cm 
parabolic antennas that can even be installed on apartment 
verandas. 
  The CLASS project, which will involve investments of $300 
million, was announced on 24 March during the Fourth 
International Telecommunications and Teleinformatics Congress 
(Telexpo) in Sao Paulo. Victori International Vice President 
Joao Santelli Junior told FOLHA that the project is only now 
being made public but has been in planning since 1992. In 
November 1993, the consortium asked the Ministry of 
Communications for three orbital positions. On 22 December, 
former Telecommunications Minister Hugo Napoleao petitioned the 
UN International Telecommunications Union (UIT) to authorize the 
orbital space positions, but the UIT has not yet published its 
decision. If the request is granted, the CLASS project and the 
Nahuel consortium will still need authorization from the 
Ministry of Communications. 
  According to Olacyr de Morais of the Itamaraty Group, the 
telecommunications market has great potential and several 
competitors are vying for it. FOLHA reported that that 
consortium has more ambitious plans than simply shareholder 
participation in the Argentine Nahuel satellite and intends to 
launch its own satellite. 
  Brazilian Communications Minister Djalma Morais remarked 
that 
Embratel and the state telephone companies are interested in 
participating as shareholders in the CLASS project; there may be 
criticisms from within Embratel ranks, however, of any attempt 
to launch private satellites. Some Embratel representatives 
believe that the operation of satellites is part of the state 
telecommunications monopoly. Communications Minister Morais, 
however, is of the opinion that the satellites will only provide 
limited services and therefore will not effect the state's 
monopoly. 
  Victori International Vice President Joao Santelli Junior 
also told FOLHA that the CLASS project intends to launch the 
first satellite in 1996 and the second in 1997. He said that the 
KU band satellites will also make it possible to install 
telephone terminals at an average cost of $3,000 each in remote 
areas. The current installation cost in remote areas of Brazil 
is as much as $100,000 per terminal. 
  CNEN, SCIENTISTS FAVOR QUADRIPARTITE SAFEGUARDS ACCORD -- 
Prior to the 9 February Brazilian Senate's approval of the 
quadripartite nuclear safeguards agreement (QSA) between Brazil, 
Argentina, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and 
Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC), and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), National Nuclear Energy Commission 
(CNEN), President Marcio Costa and various scientists commented 
favorably on the agreement's impending Senate ratification in 
Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO of 8 February. O ESTADO began by 
quoting a press statement made in Rio on 7 February by CNEN 
President Marcio Costa supporting the Senate's ratification of 
the QSA which will authorize international inspections of 
Brazilian nuclear installations. Although he opined that Brazil 
will lose sovereignty in the nuclear area, the CNEN head said 
that he was in favor of its ratification in order to avoid 
retaliations by First World countries. Costa criticized Germany, 
which had earlier threatened to break the 1975 Brazil-FRG 
nuclear accord, suspend the transfer of technology, and withdraw 
support for Brazil obtaining a permanent seat in the UN Security 
Council. "They pulled off the worst swindle in the country with 
that technology transfer story." 
  O ESTADO then went on to quote Ennio Candotti, former 
president and member of the council of the Brazilian Society for 
the Progress of Science (SBPC), as saying that Brazil should 
ratify the quadripartite accord and the Treaty of Tlatelolco. 
"But it is important," he added, "to extend those agreements to 
the countries that today hold arsenals of nuclear arms such as 
the United States, France, Britain, and Germany itself." 
Candotti then commented on Germany's threats: "I didn't even 
know that a nuclear accord with Germany was still in effect, so 
numerous have been the mistakes earmarking the 1975 treaty that 
provided for the construction of eight power plants." 
Furthermore, he added, "a seat on the UN Security Council is 
not acquired through bartering agreements and disagreements." 
  Professor Giorgio Moscati, head of the Physics Institute's 
Experimental Physics Department of the University of Sao Paulo 
(USP), believes that Brazil should ratify the accords, O ESTADO 
continued. "There is no reason for the country not to open up 
for a peaceful program and open itself up to international 
inspections," he remarked. Then Brazil will, in return, be able 
to demand that it cease being discriminated against in imports 
of products that may have a military application, he added. O 
ESTADO then noted that Professor Ivan Cunha Nascimento, head of 
the USP Applied Physics Department, is of the same opinion. "The 
accord should be ratified, simply because Brazil is 
discriminated against internationally and consequently does not 
have access to state of the art technology that may have a 
military application." He further explained that "Brazil is 
considered a `sensitive' country abroad for having a nuclear 
program that is neither known nor inspected."

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Clara Ines Rueda Gomez] </F>
  [Text] Cartagena -- Yesterday, President Cesar Gaviria 
called on the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank 
(IDB) to revise the mechanisms of extending credit and to 
rescind the conditions imposed on developing nations. 
"Considerations such as equilibrium, social as well as 
institutional development, and environmental protection must be 
key elements in development loans for them to become genuine 
instruments of economic development," Gaviria indicated. The 
president made these statements before 65 delegates representing 
27 countries at the opening session of the World Bank, IMF 
Developing Countries Inter-Ministry Committee Forum, or the 
Group of 24. 
  According to Gaviria, the formulas used by the international 
institutions are inadequate for solving the challenges 
confronted, especially those confronted by African or Latin 
American nations. These economies demand answers from the 
developed countries and need assistance to open and modernize. 
  During the forum, which also commemorates the 50 year 
anniversary of the Bretton Woods Agreement, Gaviria stated that 
despite the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT talks, 
developing nations still face obstacles of protectionism and 
discriminatory treatment by industrialized countries, as well as 
poor performance by a large segment of the essential goods 
market. 
  According to the president, the IMF and the World Bank must 
increase their involvement in improving the justice system, 
controlling the population explosion, and encouraging savings 
and private investment. In their role as mediators between 
industrialized and developing nations, these institutions must 
be more active and must preserve their independence. 
  In addition, speaking on behalf of his new position as an 
international leader, the president stated the two international 
organizations should become more involved in the struggle 
against poverty and every nation's social policies. "I do not 
say this based on the rhetoric of North-South cooperation. I 
say it with the conviction that any progress on issues such as 
economic aggregates, regardless of what part of the world it 
takes place, will be fragile and will have political 
consequences, if not accompanied by an improvement in the 
standard of living of individual nations," the president 
indicated. This could be one way to get ahead of the agenda for 
the next few years when problems such as immigration, lack of 
natural resources, and demographic pressures will be the order 
of the day. 
<H5>  New Mission </H5>
  According to Gaviria, the IMF must not only support efforts 
to stabilize those economies in crisis, but it should also 
become more involved in issues like the flow of capital and its 
impact on investment and growth. With respect to the World Bank 
and the regional banks, they should provide technical assistance 
to those countries that have undergone structural adjustments in 
order to evaluate the effectiveness of policies being 
implemented and to ensure an adequate balance between the 
various markets. 
  According to Gaviria, there are parallels between the 
situation the world was going through in 1944 (when the IMF and 
the World Banks were created as result of the Bretton Woods 
Agreement) and the current situation. "In 1994, the entire 
world is participating in the in-depth review of the roles 
played by all nations." 
<H5>  The Debt Crisis </H5>
  The new OAS secretary highlighted efforts by the World Bank 
and the IMF during the 1980's to solve the Colombian debt 
crisis. In his opinion, efforts by the two international 
organizations enabled his country to solve its debt problem in a 
unique manner and at the same time achieve the highest growth 
level in Latin America. 
  Likewise, Gaviria emphasized the fact that the Worlk Bank 
had 
learned to listen to its clients and accept that the best 
policies are those planned in accordance with each country's own 
initiative. He also indicated that the IMF's task has allowed 
some nations to be trusted once again by domestic as well as 
international markets.

  [Text] The governments of Colombia and Jamaica signed 
several tourism, scientific, and technical cooperation 
agreements yesterday. These are the first steps in the new 
relations of exchange between the two countries. 
  On the last day of his three-day visit to Colombia, Jamaican 
Prime Minister Percival J. Patterson and Colombian President 
Cesar Gaviria also signed a joint statement. In the statement, 
the two countries agree to continue developing their relations, 
aimed at cultivating new areas of bilateral cooperation. 
Patterson then returned to his country. 
  The two chiefs of state said the agreements establish an 
exchange of expertise and information in areas such as 
agriculture and language education. 
  During a news conference, Prime Minister Patterson broached 
the crisis of democracy in Cuba. He said he personally has no 
expectations about a possible role President Gaviria could play 
as OAS secretary general in the Cuban issue. He said such 
decisions arise from a consensus among the member nations. He 
did say, however, he views the Cuban situation as a priority 
issue for the regional organization. 
  Undoubtedly, Cuba's political system is different. There is 
no reason, then, to exclude Cuba from the family of Western 
nations," he said. [no opening quotation mark as published] He 
added he hopes Cuba will soon become a full OAS member because 
any contribution toward defining the Cuban crisis "should come 
through cooperation with them and not through their isolation." 
  Patterson predicted a positive outcome from the current 
negotiations between Colombia and the Caribbean Common Market 
(Caricom), of which Jamaica is a member. The talks are aimed at 
confirming a free trade agreement to be signed in July. He also 
announced aeronautics officials from the two countries will meet 
in San Andres at the end of May to complete the final details on 
an air transportation agreement to promote further development 
of bilateral relations. 
  Although Jamaica did not vote for Gaviria for OAS secretary 
general, Patterson expressed both his congratulations to the 
Colombian leader and his confidence Gaviria will make "the 
changes the new international situation and hemispheric problems 
will require from the organization."

  [Text] Paraguayan Finance Minister Crispiniano Sandoval 
urged industrial nations to reduce their protectionist measures 
and give products exported by the Latin American Southern Cone 
countries, especially Paraguay, broader access to their markets. 
The Paraguayan minister launched his call in Washington at the 
midyear World Bank Development Council meeting, which he 
addressed on behalf of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, 
Peru, and Uruguay. 
  "It is encouraging to find out that the recovery of 
Anglo-Saxon economies and the signs that mark the beginning of 
the end to the recession in western Europe will have favorable 
effects on international markets as far as exports from 
developing countries are concerned. We are also very pleased and 
optimistic over the success of the Uruguay Round of the GATT 
talks, following many years of hard bargaining," Sandoval said. 
  "We are especially pleased over the agreements reached in 
the 
agricultural field, although we would like to stress the need to 
gradually implement measures aimed at opening up markets while 
at the same time eliminating distortions caused by subsidies 
that industrial countries usually grant," Sandoval added. 
  Sandoval also asked the World Trade Organization [WTO] "to 
actively guarantee the commitments that have been undertaken to 
curb the use of unilateral commercial measures, to help resolve 
disagreements, and to ensure proper cooperation between the WTO 
and the institutions created at the Bretton Woods Conference. 
This will allow better use to be made of the new markets, and 
will pave the way for more precise coordination between 
commercial and economic policies." 
  The minister then discussed "the persistent decline in the 
international prices of our basic products." Because of this 
situation "our rural population, which is responsible for most 
of our production, has had to make greater sacrifices and its 
economic situation has worsened." 
  Sandoval also spoke about the landlocked situation of both 
Paraguay and Bolivia, an obstacle which further increases the 
cost of exports from these countries, and urged "multilateral 
organizations to give priority treatment to technical and 
financial support for infrastructure projects aimed at improving 
regional transport."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Peru monitored through 21 
April. 
  The Eximbank of Japan on 13 April reported in Tokyo that it 
will grant $22.5 million to Peru to finance electricity 
projects. The agreement was signed during the Inter-American 
Development Bank annual meeting held in Guadalajara, Mexico. 
(Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 14 Apr 94 p 2) 
  The Lima stock market showed an increase of 24.3 percent in 
the year's first three months, when it traded $948 million 
compared with the $253.1 million negotiated in the same period 
in 1993. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 17 Apr 94 p A16) 
  The State Petroleum Agency reported that the new oil well in 
the Pavayacu oil field, 235 km west of Iquitos, will begin 
operation on 19 April. It will produce 6,000 barrels of oil 
daily. Oil production went from 1,500 barrels per day in 
February 1993 to 14,885 barrels in March following the discovery 
of 11 oil wells in the past 12 months. (Lima EL COMERCIO in 
Spanish 18 Apr 94 p 1)

<F P=106> ["Summary" of interview with Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu </F>
by Fernando Gutierrez; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Gutierrez] What are the results of the Uruguay 
Round of GATT for our country? 
  [Abreu] One side of the negotiation that concerns Uruguay 
has 
to do with the multilateral issues dealing with tariff 
reductions. The main impact of this Round was an average 
40-percent tariff reduction. 
  Yet there are two additional very important circumstances. 
One is that the majority of current nontariff measures will be 
converted to tariffs. This more clearly shows the protection 
measures used by each country. The second is that this 
commercial opening will apply to other items that were 
previously outside GATT regulations, like textiles, services, 
and farm products. 
  In this area Uruguay will benefit from a reduction of farm 
export subsidies, to be gradually implemented over a six-year 
period, both in the subsidized volumes (which will be reduced by 
21 percent) and in the budget allocations for financing 
production (which will be reduced by 36 percent). This does not 
meet all of Uruguay's expectations, but it should be noted that 
progress was made, especially because the farm sector was 
included in the negotiations. 
  The other remarkable fact is that GATT will become a new 
institution, the World Trade Organization, which will provide 
the institutional framework to guarantee the fulfillment of the 
Uruguay Round agreements. 
  [Gutierrez] Will this new institution be able to prevent big 
powers from failing to comply with regulations, as happened 
several times with the GATT? 
  [Abreu] Yes, because this agreement was signed and will be 
ratified by Congress, following the standard practice of the 
majority of democratic countries. This entails a legal certainty 
that GATT did not have. 
  This institutional stability will be also reflected in other 
areas: One is the settlement of controversies. The new system 
sets forth that the panels in charge of studying controversies 
will operate automatically, and the deadlines for completion of 
their work is much tighter than at present. 
  This is beneficial for less developed countries; like the 
compensation for the closing of the oilseed market, when we 
waited eight years for compensation through a new meat quota. 
With the new system, this case can be resolved in no more than 
one year. 
  [Gutierrez] At the final Uruguay Round meeting you said that 
the progress that has been so far made will be meaningless if 
the commercial opening is not intensified in the future. Do you 
think such intensification has a chance? 
  [Abreu] The Uruguay Round is the conclusion of a 
consolidation stage for tariff reduction and for the inclusion 
of new subjects on the agenda. It also entails an effort that 
will project itself in future negotiation rounds. 
  [Gutierrez] There is then no danger of the current situation 
becoming frozen, right? 
  [Abreu] No, I believe relations will be very dynamic. 
Continuation of protectionist policies can be harmful for 
countries that cannot adjust themselves, because of the rapid 
reaction of competitive levels from other countries. There is 
not much chance for protectionism. There are chances for 
transforming the country following the demands of the 
international market. 
  [Gutierrez] What will be the negotiating strategy in the 
future? Will the Cairns Group continue to pressure European 
countries? 
  [Abreu] The Cairns Group is having internal problems because 
concessions were made seeking to divide it and discriminate 
against countries whose exports are in competition. 
  The issue will be on the agenda of the Group's next meeting, 
which will be held in Uruguay. 
  Concerning Uruguayan strategy, I want to emphasize the 
significance of our achievements, like the 2,000-ton Hilton 
quota and the fact that after failing to arrange significant 
sheep meat sales on the European market, we found other markets 
like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, or Jordan. 
  This shows that bilateral negotiations have been positive 
because they opened and diversified the market. 
  [Gutierrez] Does that mean that the time has come to 
emphasize negotiations with nontraditional markets? 
  [Abreu] Uruguay wants to diversify products and markets. The 
economy of a country that has a very narrow range of exports is 
directly affected by price fluctuations. 
  It is also true that our exporting capacity does not permit 
too much diversification, but since 45 percent of our exports go 
to Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and 12 percent to the 
United States, we must try to avoid dependence. This is a 
permanent strategy that small countries should implement on a 
day-to-day basis. Coordination is necessary between the state 
and the private sector to control the new variables of the 
international economy. 
  It is therefore necessary to adopt a different strategy with 
which we can have some degree of predictability.

  [Text] Caracas, 26 Apr (EFE) -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister 
Miguel Angel Burelli has announced the creation of the 
Association of Caribbean States, which he defined as an 
important step within the process of regional integration. 
Burelli, who made the announcement on Monday when he dedicated 
the Department of Latin America and the Caribbean at the Central 
University of Venezuela (UCV), explained that the association 
will include all of the Caribbean states and will begin work on 
4 July. 
  As of 1969 and following the process of independence of the 
countries forming part of Caribbean Common Market, Venezuela 
designed an "unchanging policy of lending a hand" to these 
nations with the sole purpose of serving its neighbors, the 
foreign minister emphasized. Venezuela is the only country that 
has 12 embassies and 10 cultural centers in the Caribbean. It 
also signed the San Jose Pact with Mexico, which supplies 
petroleum to those nations under special payment conditions. In 
addition, the government in Caracas has signed a Caribbean 
Development Bank exchange program that allows the granting of 
recoverable lines of credit to the Caribbean countries. 
  The Venezuelan foreign minister expressed his support for a 
massive Venezuelan projection into the Caribbean that, with the 
exception of Trinidad-Tobago and Guyana, is made up of small 
nations without large resources and with a small population.

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Rafael Caldera on the </F>
appointment of the new president of the Venezuelan Central Bank 
on 28 April; place not given --live or recorded] 
  [Text] I have the satisfaction of delivering to the 
Venezuelan people news of great national interest. The crisis 
created following the resignation of Dr. Ruth de Krivoy as 
president of the Venezuelan Central Bank [BCV] has been 
admirably overcome. The crisis was resolved in two days and the 
Senate unanimously ratified the appointment of Dr. Antonio Casas 
Gonzalez to fill the vacancy caused by Dr. Krivoy's resignation. 
  Current BCV law establishes that the president of the 
Republic appoints the BCV president, but this requires a 
two-thirds Senate vote. Of course, one would think that in a 
Congress as diverse as this one, where there could be so many 
opinions, it would be very difficult to reach this majority, and 
only after laborious efforts could the end be reached. 
  There was awareness among parliamentary faction 
representatives and their concern coincided with the 
government's urgent need to make this decision in order to give 
full confidence to Venezuelans and foreigners who conduct 
economic transactions with our country through financial system 
operations. 
  The BCV is a very important institution. It is an 
institution that is the working hub of the network essential to 
every country: the banking network, the financial system. 
  Dr. Antonio Casas Gonzalez is a Venezuelan with broad 
experience in administrative services, in the BCV itself, and 
serving Pdvsa, Venezuelan Petroleum -- the institution most 
important to the country's economy. I must explain that he was 
presented while the dialogue was under way. He was not 
initially proposed by the government. Talks were begun, the 
proper atmosphere was created through dialogue, the names of 
many important Venezuelans were studied, but when the name of 
Dr. Antonio Casas Gonzalez surfaced, there was such a positive 
and stimulating response that the Senate, as I have already 
said, approved the appointment without a single dissenting vote; 
it was unanimous. 
  This should give Venezuelans full confidence in our 
institutions. The feeling of strengthened institutions is 
reinforced. The national government guarantees full respect for 
the BCV's autonomy. We have had this respect in the past and we 
have it now. We had certain conceptual differences with Dr. 
Krivoy in the handling of the BCV. She felt that these 
differences warranted the decision she made. The BCV has always 
had the respect and the absolute assurance of the president. 
  We expect a harmonious relationship, harmony that will only 
be set by Venezuela's interests -- the country's utmost 
interests, the interest of the productive sector and all 
participants in the country's economy. All my fellow countrymen 
can have this assurance. The presidents of the legislative 
chambers accompany me in reiterating to our country the 
confidence people should have that in moments of great 
difficulty there will always be a possibility and a need to 
understand one another because the bottom line is that we are 
all Venezuelans and for us, Venezuela's interest must come first 
and foremost, above any other interest. 
  I ask my fellow countrymen to receive this news with 
pleasure. Dr. Antonio Casas Gonzalez at this moment is in 
London. He represents Venezuelan Petroleum's affairs in the UK 
and in other European countries. He has accepted the 
appointment and tomorrow he should return to Caracas to take up 
this delicate and important post. 
  I have complete faith that in the midst of all the problems 
we are experiencing and despite the attitude of some people, who 
without realizing it, without caring what harm they can cause to 
the country, place their concerns and interests above the 
national interest. [sentence as heard] I believe that any 
financial unrest that may have been generated following the 
events of these past few days has been overcome in a truly 
marvelous way. The Senate president was telling me that this is 
the first time the Senate has made a unanimous decision. This 
is a good sign; this fills us with hope for Venezuela's future.

  [Text] Two of the largest political forces in Congress have 
supported jurist Ivan Dario Badell for the post of prosecutor 
general of the Republic. The designation was made shortly after 
1700, when it was confirmed that 137 legislators from Democratic 
Action and Social Christian Party expressed their support for 
Dr. Badell, who defeated Dr. Gonzalo Rodriguez Corro to become 
prosecutor general. 
  Rodriguez Corro, a former Supreme Court president, received 
109 votes from the legislative wings of National Convergence, 
Movement Toward Socialism, and Radical Cause Party.

  [Text] Paulina Gamus, president of the Comptrollership 
Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, said statements by the 
deputy transportation and communications minister represent the 
first case of corruption in the Rafael Caldera administration. 
  [Begin Gamus recording] We can call this the first 
corruption 
scandal in this administration, which is not yet 100 days old. 
Rafael Irribaren, former [as heard] deputy transportation and 
communications minister, has made these charges against 
Transportation and Communications Minister Cesar Quintini 
Rosales. In its regular session this afternoon, the 
Comptrollership Committee will begin an investigation based on 
the request by Deputy Luis Manuel Esculpi. Through this 
investigation, we will determine whether what Irribaren is 
saying is true and why this type of thing is occurring. [end

  Deputy Paulina Gamus later said the case will be 
investigated 
by the Comptrollership Committee: 
  [Begin Gamus recording] This afternoon, Deputy Luis Manuel 
Esculpi of the Movement Toward Socialism asked for the floor to 
speak about this case. I had already announced on an early 
morning television program that the Comptrollership Committee 
was going to immediately open an investigation. Regardless of 
whether I or Deputy Esculpi made the request, this is a case 
that falls strictly under the purview of the Comptrollership 
Committee. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 26 April. 
  Petroven [Venezuelan Petroleum] directors on 19 April 
disclosed that the company earned over $1 billion in profits 
from its participation in foreign firms. The Petroven board of 
directors met with a group of congressmen to explain the scope 
of their foreign business dealings. The company owns 100 
percent of Citgo Petroleum Corporation, a refinery and 
by-product distribution company on the U.S. east coast. It also 
holds shares in other international firms. (Paris AFP in Spanish 
1552 GMT 19 Apr 94) 
  The impact of the pay raise granted by the Ramon Jose 
Velasquez administration and the minimum wage adjustment enacted 
by the government will increase the state's passive labor assets 
by 120.9 billion bolivares, according to studies by Office of 
Coordination and Planning and the Central Personnel Office. The 
labor minister says that although urban and suburban minimum 
wages were increased to 15,000 and 12,5000 bolivares 
respectively, those raises represent an additional expense of 
only 10 billion bolivares. He points out, however, that the pay 
raise granted by the previous administration to the government's 
professional and technical employees will have a greater impact 
on the state's passive assets. Meanwhile, the Caldera 
administration is working to guarantee that resources are 
available to cover the raises granted to professionals and 
technicians, which are retroactive to 1 January. (Caracas 
ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 20 Apr 94 p 8) 
  Venezuela's nontraditional exports during the first quarter 
of 1994 amounted to $853 dollars, $156 million (22.4 percent) 
more than during the same period in 1993. The information was 
reported by the Central Statistics and Data Processing Office, 
which added that nontraditional exports in March 1994 reached 
$371 million, 42.7 percent more than in February 1994 and 21.2 
percent more than in March 1993. Venezuela sent 27.5 percent of 
its exports to the United States, 26.4 percent to Colombia, 7.2 
percent to the UK, 5.5 percent to Mexico, 4.5 percent to the 
Netherlands, and 1.5 percent to Japan. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in

  [Text] Six days after the civilian-military operation in 
Raboteau, the working class neighborhood of Gonaives is still 
deserted. According to the Haitian Press Agency correspondent in 
Upper Artibonite, most of the youths seen at the time ran away 
when strangers came. According to rare testimonies collected on 
the spot, the bodies of those killed on 22 April while trying to 
escape by sea continue to surface, increasing the total number 
of dead, which had been assessed at over 23 on 25 April. 
According to the same witnesses, the body of a well known local 
soccer player is reputed to have been among those buried by the 
military. 
  By the way, according to the Interpress Agency, Bouter 
Mtayer, brother of Arnault Mtayer, who was also known as "The 
Cuban," and whose pursuit by the Army was the origin of the 
slaughter, was spotted by the military in the area of Sedren, 5 
km from Gonaives, and has been reported missing since then. 
  Observers note that apart from a communique issued by the 
resigning government of Prime Minister Robert Malval, condemning 
the Raboteau slaughter, none of the political class -- except 
for Aristide's spokesman -- has reacted to this situation so far. 
  In its communique published on the night of 26 April, the 
Army talked about a police operation carried out in Raboteau to 
find the individuals who authored reprehensible actions 
committed throughout the country, which according to the Haitian 
Armed Forces is a destabilization plan conceived in Washington 
by the legitimate Haitian authorities. President Aristide's 
spokesman has denied this.

  [Text] The World Bank and the country's private sector 
believe the creation of the Financial Group of North America to 
support the stability of financial markets is a sign of 
confidence and a guarantee for monetary and stock exchange 
stability. Luis German Carcoba Garcia, president of the 
Business Coordinating Council, has commented on the $6-billion 
mutual line of credit between Mexico and the United States. 
  [Begin Carcoba recording] A number of ideas has been 
discussed following NAFTA. They all seek to make mechanisms 
more simple, accessible, and, above all, more effective. [end 
recording] 
  Carcoba made this comment during the Mexico-Central America 
business meeting. Carl Dahlman, World Bank director for 
industrial development, said with Mexico's entry into the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, our 
country must consolidate its reforms and particularly work on 
modernizing its financial system because the levels of middlemen 
are still high. He commented on the creation of the Financial 
Group of North America: 
  [Begin Dahlman recording] [Words indistinct] provide more 
financial stability and confidence. [end recording]

Regarding your question, we have said over and over that the 
Armed Forces is a serious, professional, obedient, 
nondeliberative institution. The president made a promise 
during his campaign. The Armed Forces cannot leave the 
president in a predicament. We must support him. 
  But this doesn't mean that we are in complete agreement with 
the concept of volunteer military service, not for personal 
reasons or for a lack of understanding, but because we have many 
doubts about the benefits that volunteer military service would 
have for the national interest. 
  I would like to reiterate that the Armed Forces has always 
supported the president. We will accept the proposal because we 
are subordinates and have no reason to dispute the president's 
opinions or decisions. Nevertheless, we believe it is important 
that it be clearly understood that we do not completely agree 
with volunteer military service. We say this not as military 
officers but as Hondurans. 
  [Valladares] General, this means you accept the idea but do 
not completely agree. 
  [Andino] We hope we are wrong, but we have reservations 
about 
the impact of volunteer military service. We agree that 
existing recruiting measures are not the best, but we think the 
military service law by itself is good and thorough enough for 
us. The law separates the issue of military service from 
recruiting measures. The fact that part of the law -- in this 
case the part on recruiting -- isn't properly implemented does 
not mean the law is bad. Only some aspects of it would have to 
be changed or improved. 
  May I reiterate: This is the president's decision. As 
subordinates, we gladly support his decision and will do 
everything possible to ensure that volunteer military service 
produces the best possible results. 
  [Valladares] This station has learned that some have said a 
volunteer military service would be enormously expensive, 
costing nearly twice what the Armed Forces has in its current 
budget. This has all been discussed; you confirmed it tonight. 
The Armed Forces accept this proposal because President Reina 
is the commander in cheif of the Armed Forces, but you have 
expressed disagreement. 
  [Andino] Right now we have three lempiras allocated to feed 
one soldier each day. One of the main incentives for volunteer 
military service is a more balanced diet. These days, when 
prices of basic goods have skyrocketed, three lempiras could 
hardly buy an attractive meal for a young man willing to enroll 
in the Army. And this would have to come hand-in-hand with the 
correction of all criticisms and defects. We will try to live 
within our allotment. Let's see what happens. 
  I reiterate. I hope that I'm wrong and that volunteer 
military service will have the expected results. Nevertheless, 
there are several factors that could have some effects in the 
long term. Consider that only three countries in the world have 
volunteer military service, all of them developed countries. No 
country in the Second or Third World has this type of military 
service. 
  But I hope this idea can prosper. We hope the real winners 
will be the people. In this kind of military service, one 
enrolls voluntarily and leaves when one desires. But some 
people might stay with the added attraction of a higher salary. 
Others would do stay for personal reasons. And this sounds a 
little bit more like a mercenary service. 
  [Valladares] General, you explained all this to President 
Reina. I feel there is pessimism among the Armed Forces and 
that action was taken hastily so as to keep a campaign promise 
and because of the protests and criticism by some sectors. Has 
this been done in haste? 
  [Andino] We are members of the military; we are obedient; we 
are nondeliberative, and apolitical. We would not like to 
express an opinion on political topics. What I repeat is that 
we are going to obey, with good faith and goodwill, so that the 
volunteer military service will produce the expected results. 
We are here to follow orders. 
  [Valladares] General, at this time, taking advanatage of the 
opportunity you have given us, Danilo Izaguirre wants to ask you 
something about the educational military service [servicio 
militar educativo]. Go ahead Danilo, Gen. Reynaldo Andino 
Flores is listening: 
  [Izaguirre] Thanks, Raul. General, good evening. How true or 
false is the following? A group of deputies is going to talk to 
you to find out whether the government pressured you into 
remaining silent on the issue of abolishing what the 
Constitution says on compulsory military service. This group 
says that if you have indeed been pressured to approve this in 
haste, it will take measures in the National Congress. Go 
ahead, General: 
  [Andino] The sovereign National Congress will know what it 
has to do in this situation and at this time of historic 
decisions. I think they have enough experience, maturity, and 
knowledge to know what role the National Congress should play. 
We will support whatever Congress decides and whatever the 
president has decided. We will second him the best way possible 
and with the best intentions. 
  [Valladares] What has Gen. Discua, commander of the Armed 
Forces, told you about all this? There was a feeling that the 
military did not agree. Tonight you have confirmed to this 
station that they are going to obey, and that hopefully this 
educational military service will be successful, but that only 
three countries have it, and, with the country's economic and 
social problems, there is some uncertainty about this 
educational military service. 
  [Andino] I think the talks that have been held have been 
very 
positive. The problem has been analyzed in a climate of great 
cordiality and understanding on the part of the people appointed 
by the president. There has been a great desire to find the 
best solution. I think the alternative that was found... 
[pauses] We think the reform, as proposed in the new 
constitutional article, could help resolve the situation because 
several circumstances are foreseen in the event that the 
volunteer military service does not work. There are some 
aspects there which take into account the possibility of a 
problem with regard to calling on volunteers. 
  [Valladares] There is talk about disbanding nearly four 
battalions, about questions from the U.S. Government on 
reductions in the Honduran Army, and about U.S. aid to our 
country being linked to that. As defense minister, what can you 
tell our listeners about the situation? 
  [Andino] If we are not in fact independent, at least we 
should try to be independent. In the Armed Forces, the 
reduction process has been under way for the past three or four 
years. In the recent past, a field artillery brigade, an 
anti-aircraft battalion, and units of the territorial forces 
were deactivated. 
  We in the Armed Forces are preparing to present to the 
president a plan for reducing the Armed Forces that includes 
cutting back several units and merging others. All of this will 
be proposed not because of any internal or external pressure or 
because anyone has threatened to go on a hunger strike or 
anything like that. It is simply because the military is aware 
of national realities. We live in Honduras, and we have always 
lived here. As the saying goes: We were born here, we live 
here, and this is where we're staying. We have spent our entire 
lives here, and we are aware of the country's problems. We are 
quite aware of the nation's reality. 
  Considering the 10 percent budget cut implemented during the 
past administration and the current 10 percent cut, these alone 
are a 20 percent cut in the Armed Forces' budget. The fact that 
funds earmarked for the Armed Forces remained unchanged for 
approximately a decade can be viewed as a form of reduction. 
And considering the 20 percent I just mentioned, in addition to 
increases in the cost of living and the currency devaluation, we 
are talking about a nearly 50 percent cut in the Armed Forces' 
budget. 
  Taking all this into consideration, we definitely cannot 
continue with the same structures we have had in the past 
decade. Independent of what takes place on the financial side, 
we are aware that some of the original reasons for increasing 
the size of the Armed Forces no longer exist. But this doesn't 
mean that because the Cold War is over, we now must get rid of 
the Armed Forces. 
  In neighboring Guatemala, right next to us, there are no 
ideological or Cold War problems. Despite this, you are all 
aware of the problems Guatemala is going through. Guatemala has 
no border problems with any other country, yet there is no talk 
there about cutting the Armed Forces. They are confronting 
internal problems which hopefully we will never have to face. 
The problems over there are caused by menaces like poverty, 
injustice, and corruption. 
  [Valladares] Two final questions, General, before you send 
your message to the Honduran people. Tonight, President Carlos 
Roberto Reina said that these reforms will mark a turning point 
in relations between civilians and the military. Or will they 
mark differences with Gen. Reynaldo Andino Flores? 
  [Andino] No, I don't believe this will create any 
differences. I believe this marks a historic turning point in 
the sense that the Armed Forces will once again prove that it is 
sensitive to national problems. The institution will also prove 
its subordination to the civilian government. I believe this is 
the most important thing -- independent of the question of 
whether the measures are indeed positive -- the Armed Forces 
will obey. The president, as head of the Republic and commander 
in chief, commands the Armed Forces. We are a responsible, 
permanent, and credible institution, subordinate to a policy of 
obedience and nondeliberation. 
  [Valladares] General, what do you have to say to the 
Honduran 
people who are listening to you on HRN? Following this 
interesting conversation, what do you have to say to those 
listeners who have tuned in to this HRN broadcast? Gen. 
Reynaldo Andino Flores, as the Honduran defense minister, what 
do you have to say now that President Reina has pointed out that 
military service will be volunteer, educational, social, 
humanist, democratic, and intended to encourage the younger 
generation to fulfill their aspirations? 
  [Andino] Well, my message is that we should have faith, 
hope, 
and trust that everything will turn out well. The president is 
a man of experience. He is a national leader. He is our 
president and the top authority in the country. He knows what 
he is doing. We hope God will enlighten him in everything he 
does and decides. We, I repeat, are an institution that is at 
the service of the nation. The president has been elected by a 
system established by our laws, and we can do nothing but obey 
him. 
  I only want to reiterate, once again, that we, the Armed 
Forces, do not believe volunteer military service is a good 
idea. We do not agree, not because we are conservative or 
reactionaries, but because we, as professional military men, 
know a bit more about military issues and believe there are more 
disadvantages than advantages in this idea. If this measure is 
going to be implemented only to satisfy personal interests and 
not national interests, we are doing the wrong thing. It is, of 
course, easier to do what we want and what interests us than to 
do what the country needs. If we are truly going to take this 
path, I cannot say how appropriate it will be to have a 
volunteer military service. 
  I repeat, I hope we are wrong and that God has enlightened 
the [words indistinct] of the president and is enlightening all 
of the Honduran people. We hope this new measure will help 
Honduras to increasingly become a better and more prosperous 
country with better chances for an auspicious future.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Luis Batista] </F>
  [Text] According to a telephone survey of 512 people who 
watched last night's nationally televised presidential debate, 
singer Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro Movement won the debate. 
The poll conducted at LA PRENSA's request by the Dichter and 
Neira/Lou Harris polling firm gave the following results: Ruben 
Blades, 40.2 percent; Ernesto Perez Balladares, 29 percent; 
Ruben Dario Carles, 18.9 percent; and Eduardo Vallarino, 4.9 
percent. The question asked was: Regardless of your 
presidential preference, who do you think won the presidential 
debate? 
  Seven percent of those polled did not answer the question or 
said they did not know who had won. The margin of error in this 
poll is plus or minus 5 percent. Of those polled, 32.2 percent 
said their answer was not based on their party preferences, 
while 57 percent admitted their answer was related to their 
preferences. Meanwhile, 10.8 percent said they did not know 
whether their answer was based on their party preference. 
  Asked whether the presidential debate changed their opinion, 
76.9 percent replied it did not, while 11.5 percent said it did. 
Another 11.6 percent said they did not know. Of those polled, 
57 percent were women and 43 percent were men. As for their 
ages, 43.7 percent were between the ages of 18 and 35; 30.1 
percent between 36 and 49; and 26.2 percent were 50 or older. 
  A similar poll conducted by Dichter and Neira after the 11 
April presidential debate showed Blades in the top spot, 
followed by Perez Balladares, Carles, and Vallarino. In the 
debate, which was organized by the Latin American Institute of 
Advanced Studies (ILDEA) and the Media Presidential Debate 
Committee, the candidates discussed general issues like the 
economy, culture, the Canal, population growth, the prison 
system, and the Constitution.

  [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (EFE) -- Bolivian President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada has ordered military troops to the streets and 
national highways to control public order and guarantee free 
transit, in view of possible road blockades by peasants. 
  The Bolivian Labor Federation (COB) has urged peasants to 
block roads, highways, and railroad tracks as of today to 
increase pressure on the government to yield to their salary 
demands. 
  Bolivian main cities were today under military control, 
while 
several military units were patrolling highways to stop peasants 
from complying with the COB appeal. 
  Although the government has expressed its willingness to 
negotiate with union leaders, it has warned that it is very 
difficult to amend the budget law which provides for an 8 
percent salary increase because "there is no flexibility in the 
allotment of resources." 
  Military and police officials have reported that all roads 
were cleared during the first 12 hours of the day; but they 
admitted that several roadblocks were set up at different 
locations. 
  However, Radio Fides in La Paz reported that peasants have 
complied with the COB instructions to block roads and railroad 
tracks. 
  Peasant Leader Juan de La Curz Villca asserted that about 
30,000 members of the coca leaf farmers union in the El Chapare 
region have set up roadblocks on the main highway linking 
Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. 
  Villca warned that the producers of coca leaves, a 
traditional product for Bolivian indigenous groups that is also 
the basic ingredient for manufacturing cocaine, have reported 
"they will not lift the roadblocks, not even under machine gun 
fire." 
  Union leader David Herrada asked the members of the Armed 
Forces and the police to join the blockade in Cochabamba. He 
said: "If we take another piece out of this neoliberal 
government it will also benefit the police and the Armed Forces, 
who also have low salaries, like the workers." 
  The prefect (governor) of Chuquisaca, Omar Montalvo, 
confirmed that the military unit patrolling Sucre and the access 
roads will break up any demonstration and prevent any road 
blockade. 
  A Sucre radio station reported that about 3,000 peasants 
closed roads in five of the 10 districts of Chuquisaca. 
  In addition some buses going to Potosi had problems in 
arriving in that city due to the blockades set up by the 
peasants. 
  Several military units have been deployed to other regions 
of 
the southern part of the country, where roads and railroad 
tracks were closed. 
  The FIDES news agency reported that in Camargo, in the 
southern part of the country, about 500 peasants prevented about 
100 cargo and passenger vehicles from passing, and that because 
of this a two-year-old girl "died from the very cold weather 
early this morning." 
  Some cargo and bus companies have suspended services while 
the strike ordered by the COB continues. 
  Despite the tense situation created by the presence of 
military troops on the streets and the road blockades, 
government officials and COB leaders are holding talks behind 
closed doors in an effort to find a solution to the crisis. 
  The appeal made by the COB to the Catholic Church to mediate 
in the conflict was rejected by Apostolic Nuncio Giovanni 
Tonnucci, who said that the church cannot mediate "among people 
who turn a deaf ear to dialogue."

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] Crime -- The Andean Center for Popular 
Action, (CAAP), reported in the Quito daily HOY of 3 April that 
from 1982 to the present the country's crime rate has increased 
by 9.4 percent annually, exceeding the urban growth rate of 4.3 
percent per year (since 1974). CAAP believes that one of the 
main reasons for this spiraling crime rate is the increase in 
poverty resulting from the economic crisis of the 1980's. Crimes 
against property increased 20.8 percent and represented 51 
percent of the total reported crimes in 1992-93, while crimes 
against individuals increased 11.6 percent and represented 14 
percent of total reported crimes. CAAP also reports that the 
regional distribution of crime has changed "drastically." For 
example, population groups most hit by the economic crisis, the 
poor in large urban areas and in the most "neglected" provinces, 
now register the highest crime rates. Crime increased at a 
faster rate in the Amazon region (19 percent), followed by the 
coast (17 percent), and the highlands (8 percent). The provinces 
with the largest increases in the crime rate were Esmeraldas 
(37.9 percent) and Loja (35.1 percent). In absolute terms, 
however, CAAP reports that Pichincha Province registered the 
highest crime rate with 12,900 cases per year, followed by 
Guayas Province with 12,600 cases. 
  The National Rehabilitation Council reported in Guayaquil EL 
UNIVERSO of 23 March that, of Ecuador's total prison population 
of 8,856 distributed among 33 penal institutions, 4,878 are in 
Guayaquil and Quito. Drug-related crimes constitute 39.3 percent 
of all crimes for which people are jailed. Crimes against 
property follow at 27.2 percent. H0Y 3 April also reported that 
the number of people detained for drug-related crimes increased 
8 percent in 1993. However, 70 percent of those arrrested were 
only drug possessors or consumers; drug traffickers were a small 
percentage of those arrested. Guayas, Pichincha, and El Oro 
Provinces have the highest incidences of drug-related crimes. 
  Human Rights -- Citing the monthly journal PEOPLE'S RIGHTS, 
4 
April HOY reported that in 1993 human rights violations 
increased 65 percent, from 641 reported or detected cases in 
1992 to 1,055 in 1993. The same daily also quoted CAAP 
statistics charging that the police are responsible for 43.9 of 
all human rights abuses. According to CAAP "authorities, 
individuals, the military, public functionaries, penal 
authorities, private employees, and unknown persons" are 
responsible for the rest of human rights abuses. 
  Unemployment Rate -- The 18 March issue of the Quito daily 
EL 
COMERCIO reports that Labor Minister Alfredo Corral said that 
Ecuador now has one of the highest unemployment rates in Latin 
America with 14 percent of its economically active population 
without work and a 50 percent underemployment rate. This was 
contrasted with 1992 when the unemployment rate was at 8.9 
percent. The minister added that unemployment and 
underemployment were the country's most "pressing" problems, and 
that the Duran-Ballen administration is committed to carrying 
out projects that will generate jobs mainly in the "education, 
health, transportation, and housing sectors." 
  The same daily observes that the government's modernization 
program, launched in 1993, has "substantially" reduced 
employment in the public sector. In 1993, over 26,000 employees 
"resigned or terminated their employment with the state." It is 
estimated that a similar number will do the same in 1994. 
  Edgar Ponce, president of the United Workers Front (FUT), 
commented to EL COMERCIO that the current unemployment figures 
put the country on "red alert": 57 percent of unemployed are 
between the ages of 15 and 24; 
  47 percent of unemployed are women; 
  12 percent are heads of households; 
  Ponce pointed out that "unemployment is a direct route to 
social upheaval," and it is therefore necessary for government 
and business to come up with a "responsible, viable, and 
humanitarian solution to the problem." He noted that past 
government labor reforms have not brought results, stating that 
"in 1993, 23,670 workers were dismissed and only 3 percent found 
other jobs." He also charged that the Labor Ministry's 
employment program is a "mockery of all workers," since in more 
than two years it has managed to create only "500 temporary 
positions."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Miguel Angel </F>
Burelli Rivas by Manuel Abrizo; place and date not given -- 
first paragraph is EL NACIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas has only been able to 
fulfill his role as foreign minister during the last week of the 
10 weeks he has been in his post. He said during the first 
weeks, he had to deal with the post seekers who want to join the 
foreign service. The 10 weeks were filled with "little things," 
like explaining why a passport was issued to former Defense 
Minister Radames Munoz Leon and explaining to why the appointed 
ambassadors have yet to travel to their posts. He considers his 
frustrated attempt as OAS secretary general as a closed case. 
"I have already said what I had to say." 
  [Abrizo] And how did you find what they left you? 
  [Burelli] Fine, in general terms. A gentlemen occupied this 
post, and the mess I found was not his; it is old and 
accumulated. The Foreign Ministry is not an exception. The 
whole country is upside down. 
  [Abrizo] In 1968, when you were a Tripartite Front 
presidential candidate, you said, at the Caracas Metropolitan 
Theater, our diplomacy should be substantially modified because 
it is inhibited, backward, bogged down by bureaucrats, to give 
the world an approximate idea of the country. Has the outlook 
changed since then? 
  [Burelli] It is even more bogged down now. Since then, 
foreign service and civil service laws have overlapped, making 
it impossible for personnel to move about with the necessary 
freedom. That is one aspect; the other, everyone wants a post 
abroad, now that officers are paid in dollars. Even the lowest 
grade officer earns 400,000 bolivares, which is four times my 
salary. Political influence peddlers seek this refuge. 
Embassies often have as many as nine times the amount of 
required staff. I have asked many Caracas officers to collect 
their pay and not come to work bcause they only get in the way 
of those who do work. Therefore, we are like it was 26 years 
ago. Venezuelan diplomacy is bogged down, and the minister's 
duties have dwindled to the point of only dealing with the 
lesser issues, not with what concerns international diplomacy, 
which should be cared for in the country's best interest. 
  [Abrizo] You were appointed to solve problems. How will you 
face the situation? 
  [Burelli] I am working on it. I am not here to make another 
entry in my resume because I am too old. I am here to do 
something, to help President Caldera, who needs not a friend in 
this post, but a helper who honors the intention of changing the 
country. 
  [Abrizo] But a strategy is needed to solve these problems. 
What is yours? 
  [Burelli] First, to step on a few toes, and I am willing. I 
have requested legal help to comprehensively deal with the 
problem. I am asking directors to utilize the powers the law 
gives them to dismiss the good-for-nothings. I do not want to 
be remembered only as the minister who fixed the personnel issue 
but, rather, as the foreign minister who relaunched Venezuela 
into the world. 
  [Abrizo] It so happens we have heard the same speech from 
previous foreign ministers. 
  [Burelli] I need to be given a chance. As I was saying, I 
did not come here to add to my resume. I have been a 
jack-of-all-trades in this country, and if I cannot do it I will 
have failed. I have come to leave my mark. What favor would I 
be doing President Caldera by being just another minister who 
says silly things he knows he cannot carry out? 
  [Abrizo] This week, a U.S. official said corruption, 
bureaucracy, and deprivation block Latin America's progress. 
How can Venezuela's image be sold abroad when it is afflicted 
by all this? 
  [Burelli] Tell me which country does not suffer from at 
least 
two of these. 
  [Abrizo] That is no excuse to.... 
  [Burelli] Seen in that light, there could be no agreement 
with anyone. Political systems have collapsed in Europe because 
of corruption. Those countries have existed for two or three 
thousand years. This is a problem from north and south, east 
and west. We are attempting to wipe out corruption. 
Undoubtedly, we have a president who is above reproach. 
  [Abrizo] The problem are the vultures [zamuros] flying 
around. 
  [Burelli] But why do we only see the problem, not looking at 
who scares away the vultures? Before, there was no one to scare 
them away, and the vultures were left guarding the meat. 
  [Abrizo] Many believe the Foreign Ministry's efforts to 
sell Venezuela's image abroad are mere public relations. Is 
that a mistake? 
  [Burelli] It is not a matter of mere public relations. The 
issue is if we want to sell Venezuela's image abroad, we must 
first improve our image here. It is impossible to sell 
something we do not have. What are we going to do if the only 
thing that prevails here is chaos, discouragement, and contempt 
for the country? 
  We can cry out to the world and invite them to come to a 
fun-loving, investment-safe country, but Caracas television 
images travel to other countries, and scenes that can unnerve 
anyone are broadcast. We will be saying one thing, and the 
media will be saying another. What we are applauding here are 
instincts. Venezuela is being associated with the instincts of 
the worse segment of its population, exactly the way it is not. 
  We are in a crisis, but we are not penniless. The price of 
crude may have fallen, but it is still priceless as a resource. 
We also have gas resources we still have yet to exploit. We 
have aluminum, the price of which is beginning to rise on the 
world markets. We have iron, and there is untapped gold, which 
could be this country's future. 
  What is missing here is faith in Venezuela's future and 
unity. There is also a lack of ethics. We must revert to more 
positive values. The private and public sectors have 
anticipated getting rich even if it was done the wrong way. The 
prevailing factor here is a prey and plunder mentality, as if we 
were living in an occupied and beaten country where everything 
is booty and we all can get something from somewhere. That is 
the type of situation we are in, and it is very difficult to 
rectify. 
<H5>  To Scare the Brazilian Gold Seeker </H5>
  [Abrizo] It has been argued the powers that be act according 
to concrete interests, leaving such intangible questions as 
principles to Third World countries. Do you think we should be 
more realistic? 
  [Burelli] I said that before, and I did not cite former 
British Prime Minister Pitt (William, 1708-78) who said states 
have interests, not friendships. We basically have interests, 
which we deal with in accordance to the degree of friendship 
those interests will allow. We cannot discuss the same question 
with a distant nation as we do with a neighboring one. We act 
according to our interests. We are facing the world with such 
issues as fuel emulsified with water, also known as Orimulsion, 
dolphins, and Brazilian gold seekers, just to mention four 
[number as published] cases to which the media have referred. 
You should find out what has been done regarding those four 
problems so that you may realize what the country had to do. 
Had we made the wrong decisions, the media would be full of 
comments, but because we have made the correct decisions, so 
far, there is not even one line. 
  [Abrizo] It seems the solution to the case of the Brazilian 
gold seekers has been to sow seeds fear along the border so that 
they will not trespass. 
  [Burelli] And what do you think should be done? Not even 100 
million soldiers would be enough to cover the border. What 
would you do? Is it bad we scare away the looters who come to 
threaten our natural resources? 
  [Abrizo] No. 
  [Burelli] Then? 
  [Abrizo] The gold seekers claim insofar as there are no 
visible borders, there will be problems. 
  [Burelli] They know better than you and I where the borders 
are. Why isn't Brazil protesting our bombing of the landing 
strips? Brazil is very grateful of how we have managed the 
situation. 
  [Abrizo] That was a Venezuelan sovereign decision (to bomb 
the landing strips). 
  [Burelli] Oh, good. And then? I do not know what we will 
have to do. We will have to send the archbishop, the cardinal 
to convince them, to spray them with holy water. It is entirely 
untrue the gold seekers do not know the borders due to a lack of 
boundary markers. A meeting between the Brazilian and 
Venezuelan militaries will be held on 21 April (tomorrow) to 
outline future courses of action because Venezuela has stopped a 
second bombing on the condition Brazil destroy the strips on 
their side of the border. Not even they (gold seekers) believe 
the story they are unaware where the boundary markers are. 
<H5>  Cuba </H5>
  [Abrizo] When you were a candidate, you mentioned the need 
to 
maintain diplomatic and commercial relations with all countries, 
despite their ideological trends. Why is Cuba denied bread and 
water? 
  [Burelli] We have an embassy in Cuba. We have sold them oil; 
therefore, we have not denied them bread and water. 
  [Abrizo] Those are diplomatic formalities. 
  [Burelli] We might have done for Cuba more than any other 
nation on this continent. A three-tier system existed with the 
Soviet Union until recently. We sold oil to Cuba, and in 
exchange the Soviet Union sold oil for us in Europe. 
  [Abrizo] But that was merely business. 
  [Burelli] It was a business that conveyed friendship. It 
was not just cold business. Even the Venezuelan Government had 
to pay huge costs due to that. 
  [Abrizo] Every time the topic of Cuba's reincorporation into 
the American community is discussed, such questions as liberty, 
democracy, and human rights emerge. How do you view Cuba's 
reincorporation into the American community? 
  [Burelli] It cannot be any other way. We want Cuba's 
reincorporation into the community, but the community has game 
rules. 
  [Abrizo] And do you believe in those game rules? 
  [Burelli] Yes I do. Freedom of expression is extremely 
important. There are political prisoners, and I wish that there 
were no political prisoners anywhere and that all citizens had a 
passport to be able to enter and leave their country. That is 
all. 
  [Abrizo] Do you believe Venezuela has any moral authority to 
demand compliance with those principles elsewhere? 
  [Burelli] It has the freedom to allow the people to do 
anything they want: to write, talk, and say what they want. 
They have the freedom to demonstrate without the threat of 
imprisonment. In short, these are the game rules in America. 
  [Abrizo] Many people in Venezuela would change some of those 
freedoms for a piece of bread. 
<H5>  Colombia </H5>
  [Abrizo] When you resigned from the post of Venezuelan 
ambassador to Colombia, people in Santa Fe de Bogota almost 
cried over your departure. It was even said you were the best 
Venezuelan diplomat assigned to that country. Twenty years 
later, after the Colombian Government refused to vote for you in 
the OAS, did you feel somewhat hurt? 
  [Burelli] That means nothing, and you should ask Colombia. 
What happened was that I was too young and had much strength and 
fervor. I might not have as much strength now, but I do have 
the same fervor. I see my friendship with Colombia as a way of 
serving Venezuela. I cannot imagine a hateful or hostile 
attitude toward Colombia. Whatever they did to me, whatever 
they do to me, my interest is for Venezuela and Colombia to 
march together always. Our industry is already expanding in 
Colombia, and Venezuela's best interest lies in integration. 
Colombians regarded me with much sentiment after only four 
months of living in Santa Fe Bogota because I founded the Andean 
Pact. The Andean Pact was my brainchild, my blood child, the 
child of my dreams as a politician. Years after that pact, they 
wanted to stone me under the argument that the pact constituted 
an act of treason against Venezuela and that I had sold the 
Venezuelan market to low-cost foreign labor. Then, the only 
author of that pact was Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas. The Andean 
Pact has many authors now, and I am very pleased no one 
remembers I was its founder. 
  [Abrizo] Why discuss the revision of relations with 
Colombia? 
  [Burelli] We have not discussed a revision. What is 
happening is that relations that are so close, so energetic, so 
dynamic need constant changes due to the same divisions they 
prompt. Each government imparts a more subtle or marked nuance 
to its foreign policy. 
  [Abrizo] What is yours? 
  [Burelli] The one I mentioned. Our priority regarding 
foreign relations lies with Colombia, Brazil, and the United 
States. Concerning Colombia, we will bolster relations in all 
areas. Two cabinet members, the Caracas governor and the 
development minister, visited Bogota last week. I asked them to 
convey a message of friendship and integration, which symbolizes 
Venezuela's attitude toward Colombia. 
  [Abrizo] Do you believe the problem of delimiting marine 
waters with Colombia will be solved during this period? 
  [Burelli] That would be ideal because this is a problem that 
has substantially hindered both countries' functions in America. 
Our integration has given us considerable strength. Imagine 
what we would become had the dispute not cast a shadow upon our 
relations. 
  [Abrizo] Do you see a light at the end of the tunnel? 
  [Burelli] I see neither light nor darkness. I see real 
situations, and we will handle them as the real situations they 
are: without sentimentalism or biases. We will try to have a 
day for agreements that honor both countries during negotiations. 
  [Abrizo] But that is too abstract. 
  [Burelli] And what do you want me to tell you? Do you want 
me to tell you to divide this table into two? First, it was the 
word, and the word remains the only way to communicate with each 
other. We have often discussed specific solutions. In a series 
of solutions that result from a long negotiation, one must 
choose one of them at some point. 
  [Abrizo] What is the status of the negotiations? 
  [Burelli] We have resumed them. No rapprochement had taken 
place until this government took office, and it has already 
happened.

  [Excerpts] Khartoum, 28 Mar (SUNA) -- The minister at the 
Federal Government Chamber and spokesman of the government's 
delegation to peace talks, Dr. Ali al-Hajj Muhammad, announced 
that meetings of the technical committees for implementing the 
agreement signed for supplying relief to war-hit areas will be 
started in Nairobi on Thursday [31 March]. Dr. Muhammad said at 
a press conference he held here on Monday that the technical 
committee, which includes representatives from all sides, will 
discuss issues related to the agreement, such as safe ways and 
other topics. 
  He went on to say that the signing of the relief transport 
agreement does not mean stopping shooting of fire between the 
disputing sides, but aims at delivering relief materials to the 
war-hit population. Indicating that the Sudanese Government did 
not use food as weapon in the ravaging war in southern Sudan 
[words indistinct]. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. Muhammad pointed out that the success of the relief 
agreement is linked to many factors, among them were liberation 
of the outlaws' movement from domination of the external 
countries and the so-called northern opposition, adding that 
goals of the so-called national alliance aimed at toppling the 
existing government, not restoring peace in southern Sudan. 
[passage omitted] 
  He indicated that attitudes of the outlaws' movement has 
continuously been changed during the negotiation years, 
particularly by the mainstream faction, John Garang's group, 
where it had requested federalism in the Abuja One peace talks, 
confederalism in the Abuja Two peace talks and 
self-determination in the Nairobi talks. 
  He asserted the government's readiness to continue the next 
talks with the rebels' movement in Nairobi on 16 May, pointing 
out that foreign hands want to exploit the southern Sudan 
problem by speaking on human rights violations in the south and 
the Islamic shari'ah. 
  He announced finally Sudan's welcoming to the Arab League's 
condemnation of the foreign plots aimed at harming Sudan's unity.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Arab League Council's unanimous support for 
Sudan's stand against foreign plots aimed at separating the 
south and fragmenting the country's territorial integrity 
reflects the spirit of solidarity, fraternity, and unity which 
ought to prevail in the Arab nation. This spirit saw in these 
threats to an Afro-Arab country not only a danger to this 
state's security and territorial integrity, but also a danger to 
the security, future, and stability of the Arab region as a 
whole. The decision, adopted during the 101st session which 
just met in Cairo, expressed great concern about the foreign 
plots aimed at separating the south and the support for the 
secessionist rebels, as well as the open incitement of the 
rebels to demand self-determination as a pretext to divide a 
sovereign state. The Arab states' concern arises from a 
recognition of the danger of breaking up a state which is a 
member of the Arab League, not only for the effect such 
secession would have on the state concerned, but also for the 
encouragement this gives other separatist movements. This would 
fragment Arab unity and provide room for foreign interference in 
the internal affairs of other states. [passage omitted] 
  The current obstacles to the march of peace in Sudan will 
not 
affect the determination of its sons and will not thwart their 
efforts. Indeed, these obstacles will add strength to their 
strength, through the unanimity of all Arab states to work to 
preserve the territorial integrity of Sudan and to confront any 
threat to it. All this was confirmed by the speeches of the 
foreign ministers of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Egypt, Syria, 
Yemen, Jordan, Morocco, and Iraq at the Arab League session. 
They all stressed that Sudan's territorial integrity and 
security were that of the entire Arab nation and any threat to 
this integrity and security was a threat to all Arab states. 
[passage omitted] 
  As Foreign Minister Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih has confirmed, 
the government and people of Sudan are working with 
determination and sincerity to find a peaceful solution to the 
southern problem based on just and comprehensive acceptable to 
all parties and have responded to all the initiatives of 
brothers and friends. These initiatives, however, will not bear 
fruit unless there is an end to the interference by some states 
and circles in Sudan's internal affairs, as well as their 
plotting to separate the south. Sudan is well able to resist 
these plots, supported as it is by the solidarity of the Arab 
states and other brothers and friends. Success comes from God.

  [Text] Cairo, 31 Mar (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has voiced optimism over developments in the overall 
confrontation of terrorists in view of the painful blows 
recently dealt by the security agencies to the terrorist 
organizations. 
  In an interview with today's AL-JUMHURIYAH, al-Alfi noted 
that public opinion has exposed the terrorists for what they 
really are -- outlaws who have nothing to do with religion and 
whose goal is to terrorize the people, spread panic, and disrupt 
stability. Consequently, he added, the public now sympathizes 
with the state in its efforts to eliminate terrorism. 
  Minister al-Alfi pointed out that through cooperation with 
Arab and Asian states, Egypt has repatriated 29 fugitives from 
abroad. More is to come. He noted that coordination is now 
under way among all the ministries and competent authorities as 
part of the overall confrontation. He stressed that everybody 
is in the same boat in the face of terrorism. 
  The interior minister urged the public to report any 
deviation or shortcomings. He said that corruption is as 
serious as terrorism, because they are two sides of the same 
coin and both must be confronted. 
  Al-Alfi described the terrorists as outlaws who promote 
ideas 
that incite the overthrow of the regime by force; these are the 
same ideas that they use to penetrate the youth's minds. He 
emphasized that contacts exist among the various terrorist 
organizations, as evidenced by the terrorists' confessions. 
Their objective, he added, is to destabilize the regime and 
embarrass the government. Toward that end, they came up with new 
ideas, such as striking at tourist and economic installations, 
he added. 
  The minister noted that cooperation exists among the Arab 
interior ministers to confront the misleading ideologies as well 
as the groups preaching such ideologies, because most of the 
Arab states have started to realize the gravity of the ideas of 
these gangs, which have become a threat to their regimes. These 
groups use the same slogans, training methods, and even the same 
instructors, he added. Proof of this is that bombs used in 
Tunis, for instance, were made up of the same substances and 
components as those used in Egypt, he added. 
  Al-Alfi expressed his belief that brainwashing of those who 
join these organizations explains why particular individuals 
carry out suicide operations. He noted that these organizations 
receive continuing and considerable financial support. He said 
that $15,000 and 20,000 pounds were seized from one of these 
terrorist groups. 
  Asked about the possibility of initiating a dialogue with 
these groups, al-Alfi asked: With whom will we hold a dialogue? 
With a group of killers who use arms to promote ideological and 
religious terrorism? He pointed out that holding a dialogue 
with these groups would mean that their Islam is true and ours 
is false. 
  Al-Alfi pointed out that Egypt is a state of institutions 
and 
has its laws and Constitution. He said dialogue can be held 
with legal and recognized organizations in accordance with the 
Constitution. Otherwise, the result would be chaos and 
confusion. If anyone wants to be active he can join any legal 
organization. He said: Those in charge of security want a 
national dialogue to inform them of every legitimate view 
through the constitutionally acknowledged organizations, noting 
that there should be a bold comprehensive confrontation of 
terrorism for the sake of Egypt. 
  Al-Alfi stressed that arms licenses must be restricted to a 
minimum and be in accordance with the law. He said there should 
be ample justification for carrying arms so as to prevent arms 
from reaching terrorists. He noted that most arms being used by 
terrorists are either brought in from abroad or left over from 
the wars in Sinai. He noted that depots housing tons of TNT 
were seized because there are some nomads who collect arms and 
explosives from private depots to sell to anyone who pays. 
  On the role of art in the confrontation of terrorism, 
al-Alfi 
stressed that art plays a major and important role because it 
influences the literate and illiterate masses through a quick 
and facile presentation of facts.

<F P=106> [From the "Foreign Policy" column by Muhammad 'Abdallah: </F>
"Who Is Saving Who"] 
  [Text] U.S. President Clinton met with Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at the White House 10 days ago to discuss 
the Middle East peace process. At the time, Clinton was up to 
his ears in the "Whitewater" scandal, while Rabin was up to his 
ears in the scandalous massacre at the al-Ibrahimi mosque. Both 
Clinton and Rabin were looking for ways to rescue them from 
their scandal or crisis. 
  Rabin was seeking to get from Clinton something to 
consolidate the Israeli position -- to disregard the massacre 
and resume the peace talks. Perhaps the Israeli prime minister 
was looking for some kind of a position on the part of the 
United States that could calm down the Israeli right after the 
"punitive" measures that his government had taken against the 
extremist rightists, including the outlawing of the Kakh and 
Kahana Hay movements, the expulsion of leading Jewish extremists 
from Hebron, and the disarming of some others. 
  Likewise, it seems that Clinton was seeking to get moral 
support from Rabin in the face of the tremendous media campaign 
against him and his wife, in which the Jewish-owned media organs 
are naturally taking part. The U.S. President saw in this an 
opportunity to appease these parties by adopting a strong 
position in favor of Rabin and Israel. On the eve of his talks 
with Rabin, the U.S. President stood up to say that he supported 
Jerusalem as the unified capital of Israel -- meaning that East 
Jerusalem will not be the capital of the coming State of 
Palestine, which is still on the far horizon. 
  This is the way politics sometimes is when someone is in a 
weak position; and both men were in such a position. That is 
why the United States, in various ways, backed off from 
Clinton's remarks; and Rabin had to wait for some time before 
the Palestinians agreed to receive his men in Tunis.

<F P=106> [Article by Muhammad Sayyid Ahmad: "The Significance of </F>
Washington's Reservations on Resolution 904"] 
  [Excerpts] The stand taken by Madeleine Albright, U.S. 
delegate to the UN, on UN Security Council [UNSC] Resolution 
904, which was passed on Friday and which condemns the Hebron 
massacre, is worthy of our attention for more than one reason. 
The United States abstained on two points: The definition of 
the occupied territories as Palestinian (paragraph 2) and the 
statement that these territories include part of Jerusalem 
(paragraph 6). Washington's argument is that these territories 
are still subject to negotiations and consequently, they cannot 
be considered as Palestinian before the negotiations are over. 
This is because the negotiations may result in giving them to 
Israel. 
  Washington's position deserves deep thought because it sheds 
light on developments that have escaped our attention regarding 
what is being planned for the future final resolution of the 
Palestinian issue. Washington's position implies that 
everything on which there is no agreement between the 
Palestinians and Israelis must be left open regardless of the 
existing Security Council resolutions, including Resolution 242, 
which is the basis of negotiations. The preamble of Resolution 
242 notes the "inadmissibility of seizing others' territories by 
force." Since Israel is occupying the land, this means that the 
United States, a cosponsor of the negotiation process, accepts 
the Israeli interpretation on any issue where there is no 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement, even if this is contrary to the 
opinion of the entire world community and the other Security 
Council members. Based on this logic, the Israeli settlements 
in the Palestinian territories are not necessarily illegal and 
thus they do not necessarily need to be removed. Therefore, 
their presence is not necessarily against the law. [passage 
omitted] 
  The fact is that it would have been difficult for the 
Clinton 
Administration to accept Israel's position that Jerusalem is the 
unified and eternal capital of Israel had it acknowledged that 
all the occupied territories in Palestine are Palestinian, 
because East Jerusalem is occupied land and is in fact 
Palestinian. Hence, it is clear that Washington's positions on 
the Palestinian territories and even Clinton's recent remarks on 
Jerusalem were not just a slip, but have a basis and are 
consistent. The United States, like Israel, proceeds from the 
premise that the occupied territories must not be organically 
linked to the Palestinians and that their status must remain 
"open." This is because to acknowledge in advance that the land 
is Palestinian implies questioning the legitimacy of Israel's 
existence in the first place and that Israel is a lawful state 
(etat de droit) [preceding words in French as published]. Thus, 
in order for the Hebrew state to have irreversible legitimacy it 
is necessary from the start not to acknowledge that the 
territory of Palestine has a primarily Palestinian-Arab identity. 
  The U.S. position on Resolution 904 shows the kind of 
argument that Israel is expected to use in the final stage of 
negotiations. The prevailing thought is that the Gaza-Jericho 
First formula is the first stage of a Palestinian entity that is 
ultimately expected to include most, if not all, of the 
Palestinian territories occupied in 1967. It is true that 
Israel has always emphasized that it will not change its stand 
that Jerusalem is its eternal capital. It is also true that it 
has continued to build settlements relentlessly. But the 
parties' continued commitment to Resolution 242 was construed to 
mean that "exchanging land for peace" could apply in the end to 
all fronts, including the Palestinian front. 
  But the U.S. vote on Resolution 904 now shows that this 
premise may not be true and that the "interim period", scheduled 
to last for five years at least, is meant to delay a decision on 
the Palestinian issue until the other aspects of the conflict 
are settled. The purpose of this is to separate the Palestinian 
issue from the other fronts so that Israel can impose its views 
in full. 
  The question we need to ask in this regard is: Why is the 
United States standing firmly against the intervention of the UN 
and the world community in the administration of the occupied 
Arab territories even after the occurrence of such appalling 
crimes as the Hebron massacre? In the meantime, the United 
States has just as firmly backed intervention in other tense 
conflicts such as Somalia, Bosnia, etc. Why presume from the 
start that Israel's "right" to administer the occupied 
territories until it gets a peace formula it considers 
acceptable is an "absolute" right? [passage omitted]

  [Text] Amman, March 30 (AFP) -- The authorities are holding 
23 Jordanian Islamic militants suspected of trying to kill 
Jordanian and Palestinian leaders involved in peace talks with 
Israel, a legal official said here Wednesday. 
  The 23, all veterans of the Afghanistan war, were believed 
to 
have plotted to kill Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali and Palestinian peace negotiators Faysal al-Husayni 
and Hanan 'Ashrawi last year, according to charges being drawn 
up against them. 
  The militants, already detained for more than one month, 
were 
also suspected of involvement in a series of bomb blasts in 
Jordan in January and February. 
  The official said the militants plotted to kill al-Majali 
during an interview, with one of the group posing as a 
journalist. However, the interview was postponed. 
  Al-Majali was leading Jordan's delegation to the bilateral 
peace talks with Israel at the time. The Arab-Israeli talks 
were suspended after the February 25 Hebron massacre. 
  The militants also planned to kill al-Husayni and 'Ashrawi 
when the Palestinian leaders made one of their regular trips to 
Amman, the official said. 
  Bombs were to be planted in their hotel rooms with the 
connivance of a hotel employee, but the plot failed due to the 
secrecy surrounding the Palestinian leaders' movements. 
  The official said the militants were expected to stand trial 
at the end of April. 
  The group's aim was to "torpedo the peace process and get 
alcoholic drinks, bars and cinemas outlawed," the official 
explained. 
  On February 6 the authorities said they had arrested two 
Islamic militants implicated in the bombings of two cinemas in 
Jordan on January 26 and February 1 which injured a total of 
nine people. The two had reportedly fought in Afghanistan. 
  Interior Minister Salamah Hammad said a group of militants 
had been rounded up for planning attacks against the Jordanian 
parliament and leading political figures. 
  Nearly 400 Jordanians and Palestinians have returned to 
Jordan over the past year after undergoing military training 
with the Afghan Mujahedin.

<F P=106> [Interview with Walid Junblatt, leader of the Lebanese </F>
Progressive Socialist Party and refugee affairs minister, by 
Randah Taqiyy-al-Din in Lausanne; date not given] 
  [Text] [Taqiyy-al-Din] What is your opinion of the 
disbandment of the Lebanese Forces party and arrest of some of 
its officials like retired Major Fu'ad Malik? 
  [Junblatt] That measure was needed because the Lebanese 
Forces phenomenon can only grow through a small partitionist 
scheme in a Christian area and on Christians' bodies. If we go 
back and read the speech by Samir Ja'ja' after the Sayyidat 
al-Najah Church explosion, we can try him, regardless of the 
legal or criminal evidence. We can try Samir Ja'ja' because he 
wanted to arouse sectarian feelings and to say that the state is 
impotence, and to say, look, here we are. He delivered this 
speech on the same day the Sayyidat al-Najah bomb exploded. But 
we should not confuse the Lebanese Forces' disbandment at the 
political, security, and economic level and the issue of 
freedoms. 
  There are people suspected of being key Forces financiers, 
some of whom may have laundered their money inside the country. 
These must be prosecuted. 
  [Taqiyy-al-Din] Do you support the government's ban on news 
bulletins in the media services? 
  [Junblatt] The government should long ago have studied the 
media issue and passed a clear law on the visual and audio media 
services. As a result of the Forces issue, the government 
hastily issued the decision in question. Unless the government 
draws up a clear bill on Tuesday (today) and speedily sends it 
to the Chamber of Deputies, we will consider that there is an 
unconstitutional and undeclared state of emergency in the 
country. I warn that we cannot tolerate such a situation. 
Because later, and under the slogan of suffocating and 
controlling freedoms, the situation will affect the theater 
issue and the opposition. That is, I personally am a member of 
the government but oppose it sometimes, so how about the 
legitimate opposition? If this situation continues, it will set 
a precedent we have never heard of before in Lebanon except in 
the days of Amin al-Jumayyil and the Shahabis. 
  [Taqiyy-al-Din] Some Christians are frustrated and believe 
that the state is using two scales: disbanding the Forces and 
not touching Hizballah, for example. 
  [Junblatt] The frustration theory is aimed at partitioning 
the country and hitting the achievements of the al-Ta'if 
agreement. We should give that up. Hizballah, the Islamic 
phenomenon, or the national phenomenon -- that is, the 
resistance -- is a different matter. It is natural for this 
phenomenon to perform its activities and maintain its presence 
in the south, only in the south. No one can put pressure on 
this phenomenon before the land in the south has been liberated. 
But the Christian frustration and the speeches delivered by the 
patriarch (Nasrallah Sfayr) and other leaders are sometimes 
aimed at striking at the al-Ta'if agreement or proposing 
Christian self-security, as advocated by some voices following 
the Sayyidat al-Najah Church explosion, to the extent that some 
of them wanted to close the Nahr al-Kalb tunnel in order to say: 
"We are here...this is our self-security" -- which is 
unacceptable. 
  [Taqiyy-al-Din] If the involvement of Samir Ja'ja' is 
proved, do do you support his arrest, or do you believe that it 
would aggravate sectarian disunion? 
  [Junblatt] When the Sayyidat al-Najah Church incident took 
place, I urged that those concerned be investigated and 
prosecuted and that the senior security officials of Ja'ja', 
like Ghassan Tuma in Paris, Pier Rizq, known as Akram, and 
others in Paris or in Canada, should be brought to the country. 
A very violent statement was issued by the Forces at the time, 
but I did not respond to it because I knew they were seeking to 
provoke me, that is all. I support the prosecution fully. I 
believe that Samir Ja'ja' must be arrested and condemned if it 
is proved he has certain links, as his history is eventful. I 
also believe that one of the security measures which should be 
taken is to close the crossings to the south in order to limit 
the Israeli infiltrations from Jazzin and elsewhere and prevent 
security elements from infiltrating the country and planting 
bombs or booby-trapped cars. The people of the south might 
complain in the end, but the people of the Golan have been 
steadfast for over 20 years and continue to safeguard their 
Arabism. I do not believe that the people of the south will 
abandon their Arabism. 
  [Taqiyy-al-Din] What stage has been reached in your efforts 
to return the evacuees to the mountain? 
  [Junblatt] The evacuees issue is linked to financial 
resources, and this issue and the other plans proposed by the 
state should be given every effort. We note some laxity on the 
part of some circles, which are interested in other projects 
which I believe are not among the priorities. Maybe the 
evacuees issue is not as "useful" as the conferences palace or 
the railroad project, but it should be given priority over the 
conferences palace, the railroad project, and the central Beirut 
project. We and [Prime Minister] al-Hariri are cooperating to 
give the fund a sufficient loan, but of course, we have to speed 
up this matter, because evacuees cannot wait. 
  [Taqiyy-al-Din] How do you view the situation in the 
Arab-Israeli negotiations? 
  [Junblatt] I said in the past, and I repeat and stress now, 
that we are at an impasse, because Israel is procrastinating and 
will not return the land. Nor will it give the Palestinians the 
right to sovereignty over the land and resources, especially 
water resources. It is an issue of time, as far as Israel is 
concerned. It is trying to absorb the Hebron shock and tomorrow 
it will invent something new. At present they are involved in 
the whirlpool of distracting the PLO with the protection issue, 
and there will be strange and amazing chaos among the 
Palestinian police, the Israeli Army, and the settlers, who will 
all be carrying weapons. It reminds me of the situation in 
Beirut during the chaos in the days of 'Arafat. We used to form 
joint committees, unified forces, and so on...the same situation 
has moved to the West Bank, but the difference is that we are 
dealing with a clever group, that is the Jews.

<F P=106> [Statement by Deputy Prime Minister Michel al-Murr in Beirut </F>
on 30 March--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] The ministerial committee is in charge of 
studying the issue of information in general and Legislative 
Decree No. 104 in particular -- which the Government has pledged 
to amend and redraft for the Chamber of Deputies -- and is to 
present it at the next Cabinet session. At yesterday's session, 
the Cabinet asked the ministerial committee to meet again to 
prepare a new draft law on the audio and visual media. 
  Following discussions, the committee prepared a specific 
program for amending Legislative Decree No. 4, and these 
amendments will be presented to the cabinet at its next session, 
which I believe will be held next Wednesday [6 April], so it can 
make the appropriate decision and refer the draft amendments to 
the Chamber of Deputies. 
  Regarding the law on audio and visual media, which is being 
redrafted, the committee reviewed it in light of all recent 
developments. We again heard the views of the ministers. There 
was a general discussion of this issue and it became evident 
that it is necessary to completely redraft the entire law in a 
way that ensures the citizen's rights and protects public 
freedoms and the homeland's higher interests. Therefore, we 
have begun to prepare a new draft law. I believe that we will 
able to make progress at the next session in light of all the 
data that will be at the disposal of the committee at next 
week's session. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Ilyas al-Hirawi received Phalangist Party 
leader Dr. George Sa'adah yesterday. Sa'adah said al-Hirawi 
briefed him on the reasons prompting the government to postpone 
granting permission to radio stations to broadcast news and 
explained the recent suspension of newscasts. He said: I was 
convinced of some reasons and now I am convinced of the others. 
No one can bargain over the issue of freedom in Lebanon, he 
said. He voiced his hope that the Council of Ministers will 
settle this issue quickly. 
  Dr. Sa'adah spoke of the possibility of links between the 
bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il and the 
Phalangist Party headquarters, expressing his confidence in the 
Lebanese judiciary and urging patience.

  [Text] Judicial sources have confirmed that they will ask 
the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation on 28 March to 
investigate the AL-SAFIR and AL-DIYAR newspapers for publishing 
on 26 and 27 March incorrect reports pertaining to a current 
investigation, including AL-DIYAR writing that retired Major 
Fu'ad Malik was beaten up. Investigation circles have denied 
this report, noting that the judicial investigator asked Malik 
at the start of his interrogation, in the presence of his lawyer 
Emile Rahmah, whether he wanted to be medically examined by a 
state doctor for any reason. Malik and his lawyer replied that 
there was no need for that. This remark was recorded in the 
official minutes of the interrogation. The judicial circles do 
not conceal their extreme indignation at the attempt to focus 
the spotlight on the investigation and distort the proceedings. 
It has been learned that these circles will demand that the 
authorities pursue all those who interfere in this case without 
having official proof.

  [Text] Beirut, March 24, IRNA -- The Zionist regime's 
ruthless massacre of children in South Lebanon has prompted a 
wave of condemnation and hatred among the country's Islamic 
circles. 
  Prominent Lebanese religious leader, Allamah Sayyid Hasan 
Fadlallah, commenting on the incident, said here today that the 
massacre of the innocent people and students could not be 
justified under any excuse, political or religious. Lashing out 
at the international organizations and the United States for 
their deadly silence towards the latest Zionist crime, he said 
the U.S. and Europe which claim to be vanguards and advocates of 
human rights, did not even utter a word in condemnation of the 
savage shelling of al-Nabatiyah. 
  Several innocent students were killed and wounded in the 
shelling of the Israeli Army. "This silence only proves that 
the U.S. is an accomplice in the killing of the people of South 
Lebanon," he said. 
  The secretary general of Hizballah, Sayyid Husayn Nasrallah 
also strongly criticized Washington's policies towards the 
Zionist regime's crimes, and said: "Washington's silence once 
again proved that the rights of the nations and human values in 
general are of the least importance for the U.S. and other 
arrogant powers, and that they only care for the Zionists and 
their children." 
  The Hizballah secretary general called on the Lebanese 
people 
to get united in the fight against the Israeli aggressions and 
reiterated his party's all-out support for the anti-Zionist 
struggle. 
  Leader of the Islamic Amal Movement, Husayn al-Musawi called 
the U.S. "the gang leader of the world's terrorists" and said 
Washington was the enemy of the nations and universal peace. 
"The brand of peace that the United States is trying to impose 
on the countries of the region, is only a cover-up to serve its 
own illegitimate interests," he added. 
  Al-Musawi also strongly criticized the United Nations 
Security Council and said the organization was an executive of 
Washington's terroristic policies. 
  Meanwhile, the association of Lebanese Muslim ulama in a 
statement issued here today, termed the U.S. "the great satan" 
and a government without any humanitarian intentions.

  [Text] The Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has 
received a delegation of the Foreign Policy Association in 
Denmark which is currently visiting Jordan. During the talks, 
the prime minister reviewed the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations 
on the Middle East. Here is more: 
  [Begin al-Majali recording] In fact, discussing, rather 
[than] negotiating because, still, Israel hesitant on getting on 
the principles of the negotiation. In other words, the 
principle items, which is the occupied territories, which is 
water, and refugees. These three. And they want us to 
negotiate on tourism, on energy, on trade, on, on, on, on, which 
is what we call the items of normalization rather that to solve 
the principles. 
  Now, as I said, going back to our thinking or a state of 
mind 
that in peace negotiation nobody should be the winner or the 
loser, all should be gaining. We did innovate an idea where we 
put all the items on the same level. No priority. All have the 
same priority. And then we went further and we suggested to 
them, and they accepted, that we put them into baskets. Now in 
each basket we put items which we want, items which they want 
and we discuss them at the same time. 
  Unfortunately, so far, for reasons of their own, they are 
not 
coming through for this negotiation. They say: Look here, we 
cannot discuss or negotiate occupied territories, withdrawal 
from the land, or shares of water. Let it be this at the very 
end when we have the peace treaty. 
  In other words, I just want to be very quick. They want to 
put the agenda upside down. In other words, the last word on 
the agenda was the peace treaty to be put on the top and now we 
negotiate peace treaty and then these items will come through.

<F P=106> [Report by Majid al-Khudari and Ra'id al-Najjar] </F>
  [Text] The International Tourism Fair was held in Berlin 
last month. In its noon newscast on Monday, 7 March 1994, 
Israel radio said Jordanian Tourism Minister Muhammad al-'Adwan 
visited the Israeli pavilion and made a statement in which he 
said: I hope Jordan and Israel will overcome their extremists 
so the desired peace between the two countries will be realized 
soon. I also hope that after signing a peace agreement between 
the two countries, it will become possible to carry out joint 
tourist projects to attract foreign tourists to Israel and 
Jordan. He said Jordanian businessmen and investors are ready 
to cooperate with their Israeli counterparts on setting up joint 
ventures that serve bilateral economic and tourist interests. 
  Israel radio attributed this statement to al-'Adwan during a 
surprise visit to the Israeli pavilion, as the radio claimed. 
The radio said the Jordanian minister arrived in the pavilion 
unexpectedly, and that the director general of the Israeli 
Ministry of Tourism was quickly called in to receive the 
unexpected guest. 
  Sources at the Israeli pavilion expressed a belief that the 
political relaxation in Middle East relations have a direct 
impact on the change in the Arab world and the visits to various 
Israeli fairs by Arab officials. The Israeli side proposed 
tourist deals to their Arab visitors. 
  Israeli tourists toured Arab pavilions. The director general 
of the Israeli airlines company visited the Yemen pavilion and 
met with Yemeni businessmen. 
  Ahmad al-Ma'ni, director general of a tourist company in 
Dubai, told Israeli press representatives who visited the Dubai 
pavilion that what happened in Hebron turned things upside down. 
  Ibrahim Yasin, a ranking Syrian Tourism Ministry official 
said several Syrian officials are impatiently waiting for the 
time when they will be allowed to visit Israel. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-SABIL, Dr. Muhammad 
al-'Adwan, Jordanian minister of tourism and antiquities, said 
this report is baseless. He said: I did not visit the Israeli 
pavilion, nor did any member of the Jordanian delegation. No 
one made a statement to the Israeli media. This report is 
totally untrue, he said. 
  He said the objective of Israel radio is to stir up a clamor 
and to try to harm the firm Jordanian position by diverting 
attention from the ugly massacre committed by Israeli settlers. 
  Al-'Adwan welcomed cooperation between AL-SABIL and the 
Ministry of Tourism in the service of the public interest.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Jordan Is Committed to Comprehensive Peace"] </F>
  [Text] Jordan responded to the U.S. call to take part in 
the Madrid conference because the conference was based on 
achieving a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in accordance 
with the resolutions of international legitimacy and the 
land-for-peace principle. The conference was also based on 
restoring all the occupied Arab territories, foremost of which 
is holy Jerusalem, and on fully restoring the national rights of 
the Palestinian people. 
  However, the U.S. Administration abandoned its role as a 
full 
and effective partner in the peace process and forgot about the 
Madrid terms of reference. It began to encourage and support 
Israel in its attempts to fragment the peace process and to 
strike separate deals. It also gave Israel the liberty to 
maneuver and prevaricate. It went on to plant obstacles on the 
road to a just and comprehensive peace. The U.S. Administration 
bypassed UN Security Council resolutions and tried to impose its 
conditions on the Palestinian and other Arab parties. 
  Furthermore, the U.S. Administration harshly pressured all 
the Arab parties in order to impose Israeli conditions on them. 
As a result, Israel succeeded in imposing the Oslo, Davos, and 
Cairo accords on the Palestinian side. 
  Because Jordan is firmly committed to a just and 
comprehensive peace based on Resolutions 242 and 338, the U.S. 
Administration, at Israel's request, strongly pressured and 
harassed Jordan to agree to sign a separate agreement with 
Israel. The U.S. siege imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah is 
part of this harassment, which has caused serious harm to 
Jordan's economy and trade. 
  When His Majesty King Husayn visited the United States, he 
was asked to sign a separate peace agreement with Israel before 
the problems of water, occupied territories, and refugees are 
solved. 
  However, His Majesty King Husayn, who has never submitted to 
pressure or harassment from any party, rejected the U.S. offer 
with courage, pride, and a firm Hashemite will. He stressed the 
need to restore Jordanian rights to the occupied territories and 
to the plundered waters, and the need to resolve the issue of 
refugees and evacuees. This spurred a U.S. desire to take 
revenge on Jordan. 
  As a result of all this, the U.S. Administration began to 
tighten the siege on Jordan in order to cause more harm to it. 
Hence, the brave Hashemite response announced by His Majesty 
King Husayn when he linked continuation of Jordan's 
participation in the peace process with the lifting of the siege 
imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah. He stressed that Jordan is a 
difficult number in the equation and that it will not submit to 
pressures that are suspect in terms of causes and objectives.

<F P=106> ["Last Station" column by Salih al-Qallab: "BABIL's </F>
Admonitions"] 
  [Text] For the second time in less than two months, the 
Iraqi daily BABIL, whose board chairman is 'Udayy Saddam Husayn, 
has criticized Iraq's foreign policy, contending that 
decisionmakers "have given the United Nations and the West 
everything but got nothing in return." 
  Aware that the Iraqi press is state-controlled, foreign 
observers are speculating that BABIL's admonitions may signal an 
imminent shakeup in the Iraqi diplomatic community that may see 
the country's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz and Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf lose their jobs. 
  BABIL's views and commentaries are not necessarily those of 
the decisionmakers in Iraq. It must be pointed out, however, 
that Iraq's foreign policy, and that of all nations, for that 
matter, is a reflection of its internal politics, all the more 
so in the absence of a pluralistic political system of 
government or a state within a state. 
  Out of our concern for Iraq, we will venture to say that 
BABIL's criticisms are not well founded. It does not make sense 
to single out one party for criticism and lay the blame for the 
failure to get the sanctions lifted at the doorstep of Iraq's 
foreign policy makers. It is not so much the preformance of 
this or that Iraqi diplomat that will get the job done. It has 
more to do with Iraq's overall policies, administered by a 
well-known leader. 
  To be fair, there is much to be said for the way the 
diplomatic team led by Tariq 'Aziz conducted itself at the 
height of the Kuwait crisis. Even hostile Western circles will 
go along with that evaluation. At the United Nations, 
'Abd-al-Amir al-Anbari did a wonderful job that few, in his 
place, could match. The same could be said for 'Abd-al-Razzaq 
al-Hashimi, who steered a successful media effort from Paris 
under unfavorable circumstances and an unequal balance of forces. 
  Even Henry Kissinger, renowned for his feats on the 
diplomatic battlefront, could not have outperformed Tariq 'Aziz, 
Nizar Hamdun, or al-Sahhaf. The diplomatic team of any nation 
with circumstances similar to those of Iraq would probably do no 
better. 
  In the kind of circumstances -- a bottleneck -- Iraq is 
going 
through, such brilliant diplomats should be retained, not fired. 
Iraq has had more than its share of exhaustion and bloodletting 
over the last three decades. 
  It is more than likely that BABIL's admonitions to the 
directors of Iraq's foreign policy are not inspired by the 
country's top leadership, but are the opinion of their authors. 
If, indeed, they are inspired from above, then Iraq is in for a 
big loss that it can ill afford in these particularly hard and 
critical times.

<F P=106> [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Maryam M. Shahin] </F>
  [Text] Amman--A group of over 60 Palestinian and Jordanian 
businessmen have founded an investment company with an initial 
capital of over $100 million to jump-start the economy of the 
West Bank and Gaza even before Palestinain self-rule is 
implemented there. 
  Today the founders of the company, officially registered as 
an off-shore firm in Liberia due to the still lucid political 
conditions in the occupied territories, will elect their board 
of trustees at the Amman Chamber of Industry. 
  The Palestine Company for Development and Investment (PCDI) 
is to be a public share-holding company which is founded by 
mostly millionaire Palestinian businessmen based in and outside 
the Arab World. 
  The founding members who spoke to the Jordan Times Tuesday 
asked to stay anonymous until after the board of trustee 
elections. 
  "After the elections most of the founders and investors will 
be known to the public. There is no need to publicize names 
before-hand," said the company's Amman spokesman Rajaii al-Masri. 
  The company plans to invigorate the Palestinian economy by 
building much of the housing and industrial infrastructure 
needed to upgrade the living and working conditions of the 
almost two million Palestinians living in the occupied 
territories in the next 10 years. 
  Addressing many in the occupied territories who fear an 
"economic takeover" by Diaspora Palestinians once self-rule is 
implemented, company founders say the development projects will 
employ local expertise, labour and use locally-made building 
materials wherever available. 
  PCDI has three main "priority projects." The first is to 
build reasonably priced modern middle class housing projects 
throughout the West Bank, Gaza and possibly East Jerusalem. 
  The second most "urgent" objective is to build "heavy" 
industries. While investors who spoke to the JORDAN TIMES 
declined to be specific, a cement plant was given as one 
possible example. The third most important objective is to build 
smaller self- sustaining industries. 
  Another "IMMEDIATE PROJECT" will include a chain of medium 
sized hotels in all the major cities and towns in the occupied 
territories, for the "throngs of Palestinian and Arab visitors" 
that are expected to converge on the occupied territories in the 
near future. 
  PCDI has been years in the making. According to company 
sources, development projects founded and supported by the 
Geneva-based Welfare Association have been vigorously analysed 
to serve as a blue print for economic needs "large and small" in 
the occupied territories. But unlike the Welfare Association, 
which is a non-profit foundation for humanitarian and 
development assistance for Palestinians, PCDI is a large-scale 
business venture. 
  The company was officially registered in Liberia in October 
1993 and will remain listed as an off-shore company until the 
political climate surrounding self-rule "stabilises," Mr. 
al-Masri said. 
  Company stocks will be listed in a Palestinian stock market 
once that is set up in the occupied territories. An initial 
suggestion for the location of a Palestinian stock market has 
been Ramallah, Bethlehem or Nablus. 
  PCDI founders say the company will have several 
subsidiaries. 
  One such firm, the Ruwad Filistine Company, a construction 
firm, is already being set up in the occupied territories. 
  More than half of PCDI shares (or 51 per cent) will be owned 
by people who live inside the occupied territories, Mr. al-Masri 
says. The rest will be owned by Jordanian and Diaspora 
Palestinians. 
  Before the company becomes fully operational the investors 
hope that the starting capital would have increased to $200 
million. 
  Before the shares go on sale to the general public, initial 
capital raising begins with those investing a minimum of 
$100,000 with a maximum capital ceiling of investment put at $2 
million. 
  While the majority of the investors thus far have been 
Diaspora Palestinians, followed by Jordanian Palestinians and 
others living in Arab countries, a few West Bank and Gaza 
investors have also invested. 
  While many of the Diaspora and Jordan-based Palestinians 
have 
invested the maximum $2 million, none of the West Bank and Gaza 
based investors have been able to do so thus far," said one of 
the investors. 
  The degree of autonomy the company will have from 
Palestinian 
government and Israeli interference is still to be worked out, 
founders say. "We expect a very large degree of economic 
autonomy," said one leading investor. 
  Most company founders still prefer relative anonymity citing 
both political and personal reasons. "The political situation 
is still too fluid," said a leading founder, "most of the 
investors are nationals of countries other than Jordan and to 
play such a major role in the building of another economy needs 
indirect approval from certain quarters. So until everything is 
perfectly clear most prefer anonymity." 
  But those investors who are Jordanians national, who form a 
"good third if not a half" of the founding investors, have an 
implicit approval from the Jordanian Government. "Jordan and 
Palestine are intricately linked and the only non-Palestinians 
to found the company are Jordanians. So it is a special 
relationship," said one of the founding members, Nidal Sukhtyan. 
  But the Jordanian Government is not the only government to 
have been consulted about PCDI. The Palestine Liberation 
Organisation (PLO) too has been extensively briefed about the 
company's plans and intentions and has given its tacit approval. 
  "The Palestinian entity will be one in which the open market 
rules and business community will bank roll the economy. 
Naturally the PLO approves," said one founder. 
  Individuals, companies and banks are among the initial 
founders of the PCDI and the board of trustees to be elected 
today is likely to include the economically most powerful people 
in the lands to come under Palestinian control.

but police gave chase and arrested one of them, named Yasir 
'Abd-al- Salam 'Abd-al-Qadir al-Satari, formerly from al-Ramlah 
and currently an al-Husayn Camp resident. 
  The two Russian nationals, Victor Manhalbin and May Rijan 
[names as transliterated], received medical treatment. Rijan 
works for the national wrestling team as a trainer. Yasir 
confessed that he was accompanied by Kayid Muhammad Salamah and 
Rawhi Talal Ahmad, both residents of the al-Husayn Camp. The 
three were delivered the head of the preventive security section 
to complete their interrogation. He then transferred them to 
the General Intelligence Directorate, were they remain.

  [Text] The Group of 15 developing countries, or G-15, will 
take a common position to ensure that interests of South 
countries are protected and informed at the GATT ministerial 
meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco next month. This is agreed upon 
by leaders attending the fourth G-15 summit in New Delhi, India. 
Briefing Malaysian journalists, Foreign Affairs Minister Datuk 
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the leaders agreed that ministers 
representing the group at Marrakesh should meet before the 
meeting to coordinate their positions. 
  He said the subject on the need to impose a global minimum 
wage raised by Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir will be 
viewed with concern. Efforts should be made to ensure such a 
move is not approved or endorsed. If a global minimum wage is 
imposed, it will have serious negative consequences in the 
industries and economies of the South countries.

  [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed says countries of 
the South can meet the challenge of the so-called social clause 
to be included in the Marrakesh Declaration if they stand 
together. 
  The United States proposes to include Marrakesh Ministerial 
Declaration, the clause of seeking a committment to address the 
link between social and labor standards towards international 
trade in the world trade organization. 
  The prime minister said this when replying to a question 
posed to him at the news conference at the end of the fourth 
G-15 summit in New Delhi. He said if the U.S. and other 
developed nations insist on imposing a global minimum wage, it 
will not be advantageous to the South nations. He pointed out 
that cheap labor is the only comparative advantage the 
developing world has against the developed nations. The 
developed countries on the other hand, have full advantages, 
namely, capital, technological knowhow, management and marketing 
know-how, and huge domestic markets.

<F P=106> [Address by Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao at the </F>
concluding session of the G-15 Summit at Vigyan Bhavan in New 
Delhi -- live] 
  [Text] Excellencies, heads of state, heads of government, 
special envoys, ladies and gentlemen: We meet now in the 
concluding session of the fourth summit of the G-15 in New 
Delhi. We have had fruitful discussions on matters relating to 
the future organization of the work and activities of the group 
as well as on further evolving its perspectives on global issues 
of common concern. When we began the summit, we were set to 
impart a new dynamism to this group and enable it to more 
meaningfully serve the interests of its constituents. We sought 
to clearly establish a direct correlation between our interests 
in the group and the benefits that we can derive from it. We 
believe that we have been able to provide the wherewithal and 
direction to the group in terms of institutional framework and 
agenda that, given rigorous monitoring and follow up, could 
achieve this objective. 
  We have decided to broaden the scope of intra-G-15 economic 
cooperation through the establishment of a Committee on Trade, 
Investment, and Technology, which will work toward evolution of 
transregional arrangements. Key elements of these arrangements 
would be liberalization, facilitation, promotion of trade to 
demonstrably increase economic interaction within the group. 
The success of our efforts would, in turn, simulate such 
exchanges in the vital areas of trade, investment, and transfer 
of technology with and among other developing countries. The 
private sector will have a crucial role to play and will 
therefore be closely associated with this venture. This 
committee will also establish interactive links with related 
projects such as the South Investment, Trade, and Technology 
Data Exchange Center -- SITTDEC -- payments, arrangements, 
infrastructure, sectoral, and techno-economic projects such as 
solar energy and gene banks. This approach will not only bring 
our complementarities to the fore, but will fully utilize them 
to enlarge markets and accelerate growth and development in our 
countries. Above all, this approach provides an altogether new 
dimension to our firm commitment to further implement our 
cooperative projects and establish more vigorous linkages 
between them and our national institutions and policies. This 
would then make South-South cooperation a truly vibrant 
component of G-15. 
  The business forum which has been held in tandem with the 
summit has provided new insights to expanding trade, investments 
through joint ventures, technological exchanges, and tourism. 
It drew up time-bound action plans for strengthening transport, 
financial, and information infrastructure for intra G-15 trade. 
The trade committee would help achieve these objectives through 
its own work program. We recognize that the availability of 
objective, balanced, extensive, and timely information about 
political, cultural, economic, and social developments in G-15 
countries is an essential prerequisite of effective cooperation. 
We, therefore, agreed that G-15 should harness the information 
and communication revolution to promote better understanding and 
knowledge about the problems and experiences, capabilities, and 
potential of our countries. This could best be achieved by 
establishing telecommunications and media link-ups and 
coordination of efforts in these areas. A group to evolve 
appropriate strategies in this regard, including recommendations 
on information infrastructure and communication systems -- 
existing and new -- that may need to be established will be set 
up. We are asking the troika foreign ministers to facilitate 
the setting up of such a group and develop its terms of 
reference. 
  The summit reaffirmed support for the continuing operation 
of 
SITTDEC and agreed that member countries should meet their 
financial obligations. To ensure viability, the summit 
recommended that SITTDEC should be commercially oriented and 
accept subscribers directly from all developing countries. In 
this regard, it was felt that a board meeting should be convened 
at the earliest. Our group has considerable technological 
resources and expertise, which we are keen to put to the service 
of industrialization, rural development, employment generation, 
and building of social infrastructure in developing countries. 
Cooperation in the setting up of small scale industries, 
especially in Africa is of particular relevance and we agreed to 
extend full support through appropriate projects. 
  We welcomed the offer by the government of Senegal to 
coordinate a project on the transfer of technology and 
development with a focus on food production, energy, and health. 
We welcomed the proposal by the government of Egypt on 
establishment of South-South Renewable Energy Promotion Center, 
which is geared to exchange of information and the use of 
existing capabilities in member countries in this field. We 
also welcomed the proposal of the government of Egypt for 
cooperation in the design, execution, and management of 
petroleum, gas and petrochemical projects. We agreed to hone 
our consultative mechanisms by providing for meetings of our 
ministers of foreign affairs, economy, trade, agriculture, 
environment, and science and technology on a regular basis in 
the intersummit period. This would not only deepen our 
understanding on these policy areas, but also lay the practical 
foundation for cooperation among our countries. We are aware 
that our decisions will have to be continuously followed up and 
translated into action on the ground. We expect that the 
summit's declared commitment will ensure that our national 
administrations with the active support of our industry and 
business would involve themselves in this task and produce 
results. We would use ministerial and other consultative 
mechanisms to coordinate our approaches on specific global 
issues of common concern. The group's mandate of engaging in a 
substantive dialogue on such issues with our partners in the 
north will be actively pursued through interactions at 
multilateral fora. The G-15 initiative on a constructive and 
focussed dialogue with the G-7 will be carried forward. 
  The summit provided us an opportunity to evaluate the 
international situation and exchange perceptions on issues of 
critical importance to peace and development in our times. We 
undertook a [words indistinct] of the economic, political, 
environmental, and social changes that we, the developing 
countries face in common and shared our experiences in meeting 
these challenges. We affirmed the equal importance of attention 
to peace and development in a restructured and democratized UN, 
if we are to realize more equitable, prosperous, and secure 
world order. 
  The world trading order that is emerging after seven long 
years of negotiations in the Uruguay Round engaged our 
attention. We expect that the round will fulfill its promise of 
propelling our growth through new and expanded market access 
areas of current and potential interest to us. Further, we look 
to the WTO [World Trade Organization] as a guarantor of the 
rights of the weaker trading partners and as a safety net 
against arbitrary, unilateral, and discriminatory protectionist 
action. In the coming months and years, we would have to work 
together for this. At the same time, while we are fully 
conscious of genuine social and environmental requirements and 
the need to fulfill them in our specific context, we will have 
to guard against new trade restricting tendencies in the 
developed countries using the pretext of social and 
environmental concerns with the real aim of nullifying the 
comparative advantage of the economies of the south such as raw 
materials, simple life styles, climate, wage structure, et 
cetera. Keeping these factors in mind, it was agreed that our 
ministers could meet at Marrakech on the occasion of the 
concluding conference on the Uruguay Round with a view to 
ensuring coordination amongst us. 
  Our discussions on the substantive and organizational 
aspects 
of the group have yielded positive results and it is my hope 
that the group will influence policies, decisions, and events 
that directly impinge on our individual and collective 
well-being. We welcomed the offer made by the president of 
Argentina to host our fifth summit meeting and look forward to 
meeting in Buenos Aires in 1995. We also welcomed and accepted 
the offer made by the president of Zimbabwe to host our sixth 
summit in 1996. As this summit draws to a close, we look 
forward to the future. We are confident that under the wise and 
able stewardship of President Menem, the G-15 will prosper and 
advance toward the realization of its potential. I would like to 
assure him of our fullest cooperation in this noble endeavor, 
which is the cherished goal of all our countries and peoples. I 
now invite His Excellency Mr. Carlos Menem to make his 
acceptance statement as the host of the fifth summit of G-15. 
Thank you.

<F P=106> [Speech by Argentine President Carlos Menem at the Closing </F>
Ceremony of the G-15 Summit in New Delhi -- live, in Spanish 
with simultaneous translation into English] 
  [Text] Mr. Prime Minister of India, Mr. Prime Minister of 
Malaysia, Mr. President of Nigeria, delegates of the Group of 
15, ladies, gentlemen: I would like to use this opportunity to 
confirm our commitments to the targets and principles of the 
group, which, according to our conviction, has been strengthened 
and matured in the course of the years, and also to repeat the 
willingness of our country to host in 1995 this summit meeting. 
Furthermore, on behalf of my people and the government, I would 
like to thank very sincerely for the cordial welcome, the 
affection, the kindness that has been shown to us in these few 
hours of our presence in this beautiful country and congratulate 
you for the organization of this meeting. We are convinced of 
the importance of the cooperation among our countries as a 
fundamental instrument in our struggle for development and 
welfare of our people. 
  Success that we noted in the processes of reform in the past 
years in many countries that form part of this forum shows 
clearly which benefits countries can expect that are ready to 
undergo processes of liberalization and the economic opening. I 
believe that the traumatic experiences shared by the countries 
present here are some of the most valuable ones offered by the 
contemporary world. Sharing this experience among us will help 
us to face future challenges and strengthen the achievements 
already attained. In this respect, I would like to express my 
great personal satisfaction over the results obtained in many of 
the cooperation projects the group has already implemented. In 
particular, I would like to underline the success of the meeting 
on exchange of information on national economic policies, which 
focus on the issue of privatization. It is an example of the 
activities aimed at strengthening and consolidating the work and 
functioning of this group. At the same time, it is a clear 
example of the constructive form of a high-technical component 
in which the South-South cooperation can be made increasingly 
effective. I am convinced that the strengthening of our group 
through a program of technical cooperation cleared of 
ideological contents, which are survivors from, or vestiges 
from, passages already overcome, and a solid scientific support 
constitute the best possible way to sensitize the most developed 
countries regarding the needs of a free international trade. 
The different sectors of our countries, without prejudice, will 
help us to create a favorable international environment, in 
which the benefit of free trade will be distributed in a just 
manner among all of the nations of the world. 
  Luckily, the days are already gone by when the probable, 
alleged culprits of all our problems were sought in the 
developed world. Today, we know that the main responsibility of 
our countries is to achieve the necessary structural 
transformation to maintain the course of full economic and 
social development. The genuine economic development, stemming 
from this process of sincerity, will constitute the best basis 
for the universal consolidation of fully democratic regime 
founded on the sovereignty of the people whose authorities act 
in strict conformity with the laws sanctioned by the 
representatives of the people without discriminations and with 
full respect for the human rights. In other times, these 
subjects were considered to be the exclusive domain of each 
state outside of the interference of other members of 
international community. Today, we know to which extent it is 
in the interest of everyone that democracy be effectively 
adopted by all nations. Recent history and also the events we 
have to face everyday in the different regions of this world 
show us that as long as this does not occur, a Damoclean sword 
will continue to hang over world peace and over the material, 
moral progress of our people, as well as the effective sharing 
of the benefit of civilization by all human beings. 
  Argentina has systematically sustained the need to realize a 
role of international organizations of all kinds as a dominant 
force and a useful instrument in trying to achieve international 
peace. In this framework, an active commitment to the values of 
democracy, pluralism, rule of law, and the protection of human 
rights, is the best contribution we can make in order to promote 
all the other objectives of the Group of 15. 
  I would like to repeat my thanks, very warm gratitude, at 
the 
fact that we have been allowed to be in the last moments of the 
meeting of the Group of 15 and to be able to repeat the offer of 
Argentina that in 1995 we will be able to meet again in our 
country in order to continue our deliberations there. One of 
the most fundamental topics Argentina is going to propose, and 
that has already been dealt with in the framework of the United 
Nations, is the creation of an organization termed White Helmets 
in order to make sure and support the struggle against poverty 
on our earth. I think we cannot be talking of justice and peace 
as long as there are poor people on this globe. I think we have 
reached an unavoidable and inescapable commitment of all 
countries, especially those that have greater possibilities, to 
be involved not only on the diplomatic level in a preventive way 
but fundamentally in the diplomacy of cooperation, solidarity. 
The White Helmets that the Republic of Argentina proposes do 
not mean to try and achieve only food and similar help for our 
brothers on this earth that need it, but to achieve a way of 
teaching man to work, teaching man to make use of the resources 
available on the earth to make sure that on the basis of his own 
efforts, he may have a more dignified life. We will continue to 
insist on this issue and we will make sure that in 1995, the 
White Helmets will be present in those countries and those 
places where marginal poverty is specially hard until we may in 
this way bring warmth and affection to those people who really 
need to be alleviated of the sacrifice they are subjected to. 
Thank you very much and we see you soon. [applause]

  [Text] The G-15 countries have decided to adopt a united 
stand at the Marrakech meeting in Morocco, which has been 
convened to endorse the GATT accord. Addressing a joint press 
conference in New Delhi today, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha 
Rao, said representatives of the leaders of the group will meet 
to formulate their stand. Replying to a question on putting up 
of new conditions on trade outside the framework of GATT, the 
Malaysian prime minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, said that the 
developing countries have to adopt a common stand on such 
extraneous issues. He deplored the tendency of the rich 
countries to impose restrictive practices, including quota 
system and Super 301. 
  Referring to the problem of quorum at G-15 summit, Mr. 
Narasimha Rao said a proposal was discussed to make it more 
flexible. Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said the absence of some leaders 
of the summit should not be interpreted as loss of interest in 
the forum. He said it is difficult to get all the heads of 
state at one place at a particular time. 
  The Argentinian president, Dr. Carlos Menem, expressing 
total 
support for the meet, said commerce and trade should be made 
much more transparent. 
  Mr. Rao described the three-day summit as successful. 
  The joint communique issued at the end of the summit has 
called for setting up a monitoring mechanism to protect the 
interest of the developing countries while carrying out the new 
GATT accord. It also called for expansion of both the permanent 
and nonpermanent membership of the UN Security Council on 
democratic lines to give representation to the developing 
countries. Describing terrorism as one of the most dangerous 
threats to human rights, it urged the international community to 
cooperate in effectively combating the menace. 
  The seven-page communique welcomed the conclusion of the 
Uruguay Round and expressed the hope that it will lead to the 
creation of a nondiscriminatory multilateral trading system and 
expansion of trade, especially for the developing countries. 
Expressing concern over moves to bring in new issues like label 
standards and trade negotiations, the G-15 leaders urged the 
developed countries to refrain from actions which will affect 
the balance in the global trading system. On restructuring the 
UN, the communique said a stable formula should be devised to 
establish appropriate and dynamic interaction between the 
Security Council and the General Assembly. 
  The summit called for revitalization of the dialogue with 
the 
G-7 advanced nations to find meaningful solutions to acute 
problems like poverty, population growth, environment, and 
development. Referring to South-South cooperation, the 
communique said impressive progress made by some developing 
countries reinforces its rationale. The summit called for a 
comprehensive approach to solve the debt problem faced by some 
developing countries. 
  Argentina will host the fifth summit next year, while 
Zimbabwe will host the sixth.

  [Excerpts] The three-day G-15 meeting of heads of state and 
government ended today in India. A joint communique was issued. 
They noted that the work done by the group since its inception 
four years ago was satisfactory and reaffirmed their 
determination to pursue the objectives of strengthening of 
South-South consultation and cooperation and promoting the 
South's productive partnership with the North on issues of 
mutual benefit and common concern. [passage omitted] 
  Also while in India, [Nigerian] foreign affairs minister, 
Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, addressed a news conference. The 
briefing was to clear any misconception or misinformation on 
Nigeria and the G-15 meeting. Ambassador Babagana Kingibe said 
Nigeria's presence at the meeting was the reaffirmation of its 
belief in the ideals of the G-15. He said the democratic wind 
blowing through the world should also influence the membership 
of the UN Security Council and that the council should be 
expanded to reflect the changes in the world since 1945. On 
Bakassi, the minister said Nigeria was accommodating in the face 
of provocation. He also said government was working hard to 
firm up the naira.

  [Text] Cairo, March 30 (AFP) -- Israeli and PLO negotiators 
broke off talks here Wednesday [30 March] after failing to reach 
agreement on plans to protect Palestinians in the mosque 
massacre town of Hebron, a diplomatic source said. 
  The two sides met for several hours before suspending the 
talks, which were aimed at finalising agreement on deploying 
Palestinian police and international observers in Hebron. 
  The negotiators had been unable to reach any compromise and 
were dissatisfied with each other's proposals, the source said. 
  "An Egyptian mediator is shuttling between them to try to 
get 
them back around the table," said the source, who did not give 
specific reasons for the breakdown. 
  The delegations are trying to reach agreement on ways to 
protect Palestinians in Hebron, where a Jewish settler killed 30 
Arab worshippers on February 25. 
  An accord would allow the resumption of talks on launching 
Palestinian autonomy, which have been suspended since the 
massacre.

  [Text] Cairo, 30 Mar (MENA)--The Palestinian and Israeli 
delegations led by Nabil Sha'th and Amnon Shahaq resumed their 
negotiations here this evening. 
  A Palestinian source has told MENA that the two sides will 
discuss how to reach an agreement on the security arrangements 
and international protection in Hebron in accordance with 
Security Council Resolution 904. They will also discuss the 
possibility of extending these arrangements to the Gaza Strip in 
view of the deteriorating situation there after the killing of 
six Palestinians in Gaza two days ago. 
  In its statement to MENA, the Palestinian source noted that 
the two sides have not yet reached an agreement on the security 
arrangements, adding that the negotiations are still going on in 
this regard. 
  A Palestinian-Israeli subcommittee met all night last night 
to discuss the volatile situation in the occupied territories. 
The negotiators referred the outcome of their discussion 
concerning these arrangements and international protection in 
Hebron and Gaza Strip to the Palestinian leadership in Tunis and 
the Israeli Government as part of the continued consultations. 
  MENA has learned from sources close to the negotiations that 
the two delegations have met only when the green light has been 
received from Tunis. 
  Israeli sources said that Israel has approved of the 
presence 
of 100 members of the Palestinian police force and 70 
international observers armed with light weapons in Hebron. 
However, Palestinian sources say the Palestinian delegation has 
rejected the Israeli proposal.

  [Text] An Israel-PLO agreement on security arrangements in 
Hebron, to be signed by the delegation heads this morning, was 
reached in Cairo past midnight last night. Our correspondent in 
Cairo Arye Gus reports that under the agreement, an increased 
international force will be deployed in Hebron in exchange for 
the Palestinian consent to waive their demand for Palestinian 
police there. 
  PLO officials said that about 160 observers from three 
countries -- Norway, Denmark, and Italy -- will be stationed in 
Hebron, and as said, there will be no Palestinian police there. 
  The agreement has paved the way for the resumption of the 
Gaza and Jericho autonomy talks and for an early deployment of a 
Palestinian police force in Gaza.

  [Text] Cairo, 31 Mar (MENA)--The Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiators reached an agreement early this morning on the 
security arrangements and international protection in the city 
of Hebron in the occupied West Bank. They also agreed on the 
entry of vanguards of the Palestinian police force into Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  Sources close to the negotiations have told MENA that the 
implementation of the two agreements will begin within one week. 
The same sources noted that Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the talks, and Major General Amnon 
Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation, will sign the agreement 
at 1000 [0800 GMT] this morning. The same sources told MENA 
that Israel had agreed to let 160 observers from Norway, 
Denmark, and Italy be deployed in Hebron and that the PLO had 
given up on the idea of the entry of a Palestinian police force 
into the city. The sources added that the international 
observer force will not be entirely dedicated to monitoring. 
Some will perform administrative work. Israel earlier proposed 
allowing 100 Palestinian policemen and 70 international 
observers into the city but the Palestinian side refused. 
  The same sources noted that an agreement was also reached on 
the entry of vanguards of the Palestinian police force into Gaza 
and Jericho before the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement. The sources told MENA that the two delegations 
started consultations early this morning on the agenda of the 
talks on Gaza and Jericho, which have been suspended since 25 
February following the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in 
Hebron. The same sources noted that negotiations on this 
subject will last all day today and will resume next week in 
Cairo. The sources described the atmosphere of the talks as 
serious and said both sides worked to reach this agreement as 
soon as possible and begin talks on implementing the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  The same sources stressed that there is a mutual desire to 
honor the deadline for implementing the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement on 13 April. The sources noted that the drafting of 
the two agreements was concluded at 0100 this morning. The 
first agreement relates to Hebron and the second to the entry of 
vanguards of the Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho. 
The delegations had to wait until early this morning to receive 
a reply from the Palestinian leadership in Tunis.

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 22 March 
issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Al-Azhar Defended; Mufti on Fatwas 
  2. Lawsuit Against Use of Satellite Dishes 
  3. Religious Seminar Stresses Islamic Values, Mosque's 
Role 
  4. Attack Seen as Part of Scheme Against Islam

  8. The Islamic Economic System 
<H5>  AL-AZHAR DEFENDED; MUFTI ON FATWAS </H5>
  In an approximately 400-word article on page 24, Chief 
Editor 
al-Sayyid 'Abd al-Ra'uf rebuts those who "ignorantly and 
maliciously" accuse al-Azhar of being a "backward and 
narrow-minded institution restricting the freedom of thought and 
creativity." He maintains that al-Azhar, with its weight, 
history, role, and status "will always remain too strong and 
mighty for the weak ones to harm." Apart from being a beacon of 
knowledge and learning, the writer says al-Azhar has all along 
been the springboard for national struggle against foreign 
occupation and aggression. Now, the writer argues, "the voice 
of intelligence and moderation against extremism and terrorism 
is unleashed from al-Azhar, and from there the voice of 
knowledge and faith is unleashed to counter the attack that is 
being launched against religion and its principles, values, and 
symbols under the pretext of freedom of thought and creativity." 
  In a related 500-word article on page 10, columnist Majdi 
Salim discusses how some people, against the law, are publicly 
criticizing some judicial rulings in newspapers. He notes the 
"clamor raised by some people against the ruling of the 
Administrative Judiciary Court and the State Council giving 
al-Azhar the legal right to review artistic works, whether 
audio, visual, or printed, as far as religious matters are 
concerned." The author comments: "The clamor against al-Azhar 
and the law was raised in the name of freedom and liberty. Do 
they know law better than the men of law, or are they-- to 
achieve their objectives--ready to sacrifice even the laws that 
protect them and the homeland?" Salim concludes: "At any rate, 
it is not strange for this group, which is used to attacking 
ethics and religious values, to throw the rules of the judiciary 
overboard." 
  In a 120-word report by Mahmud 'Ushb on page one, Dr. 
Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, the mufti of the republic, says any 
capable Muslim can pass fatwas [religious rulings], but those 
who do not have the right answers must not try to make fatwas. 
The mufti is cited as saying that specialist ulema must be 
consulted about fatwas and religious matters in movies and 
television dramas. He says: "Religion is sacred and everybody 
must be committed to its rules and act accordingly. Passing 
fatwas without the required knowledge is a major sin." 

<H5>    LAWSUIT AGAINST USE OF SATELLITE DISHES </H5>
  A 150-word report on page three says that a young lawyer 
from 
Aswan has filed a lawsuit demanding that "all decisions allowing 
citizens to possess satellite dishes be rescinded." In his 
petition, the lawyer says that "explicit sex movies" available 
on satellite television "violate Article 2 of the Constitution, 
which states that Islam is the religion of the state. They also 
violate Article 10, which stipulates that the state shall 
guarantee protection of motherhood and childhood, care for the 
young, and ensure the right conditions for the development of 
their talents." 
<H5>  RELIGIOUS SEMINAR STRESSES ISLAMIC VALUES, MOSQUE'S ROLE </H5>
  An approximately 2,000-word report by Ibrahim Nasr and 
Mamduh 
al- 'Ashri on page four gives an account of a religious seminar 
arranged by the newspaper at a Cairo school. According to the 
reporters, the ulema addressing the audience stressed the 
importance of Islamic upbringing and noted the important role of 
the mosque "not only as a place for worship, but also as a 
comprehensive cultural and social establishment." The speakers 
noted the organic bond between religion and culture. 
<H5>  ATTACKS SEEN AS PART OF SCHEME AGAINST ISLAM </H5>
  A 300-word article by Basyuni al-Hulwani on page six 
discusses a television serial on the era of a Muslim caliph and 
concludes that Muslims have historically been the target of 
foreign hatred and conspiracies. He says: "History proves that 
we have always been the target of ambitions often supported from 
outside. The forces of evil, which do not want Islam to be 
active, find local hands to implement their wishes. This is 
what we are currently suffering from. Will we correctly read 
what is happening and realize that the scheme against stability 
in Egypt is part of a comprehensive scheme to attack Islam 
throughout the world? And will we try to answer one question to 
realize who is the real beneficiary from attempts to attack 
Egypt? The question is: Who are the enemies of Islam?" 
<H5>  RELATIONS WITH NON-MUSLIM BELIEVERS </H5>
  An approximately 1,300 word article by Samir al-Hudaybi on 
page six discusses Muslims' relations with "the people of the 
book"; that is, followers of the other heavenly religions. The 
writer begins by noting that one of the "harmful common beliefs 
hindering an Islamic upsurge is that paradise is exclusively for 
Muslims." The writer provides Koranic texts to make the point 
that followers of the other heavenly religions are also 
believers. He writes: "Belief is a human phenomenon in all 
heavenly religions. Here, believers' hearts are full of virtue 
and knowledge that there is a creator and a day of judgment. 
But Islam is a way of life and the best of all religions; that 
is, the best way of life, and Muslims are required to highlight 
it and its virtues to the entire world." The writer concludes: 
"God is the lord of all humans. All men are God's people; He 
is more gracious to people than their fathers; He is absolute 
justice, and no one will enter paradise except those who have 
virtuous hearts that know no hatred and love others as they love 
themselves." 
<H5>  ISLAMIC CULTURAL OPTION VERSUS WESTERN CULTURE </H5>
  An approximately 700-word article by Islamic writer Dr. 
Muhammad 'Amarah on page seven discusses the Islamic cultural 
project, analyzing the factors that make the Islamic option "the 
only cultural alternative capable of competing with the Western 
cultural option on an international level." The writer 
maintains that Western culture, which rearranged its house after 
the fall of the Marxist model, "does not want Islam, its nation, 
and its culture to grow strong and independent." He explains: 
"The strength, upsurge, and independence of this nation mean 
the fall of the biggest spoils from the mouth of the `Western 
lion,' a real earthquake in the international balance of power, 
and the return of the Islamic culture's influence on the 
deep-seated world cultures." The writer determines that "the 
West, as history certifies, views the culture of Islam as the 
first rival, the only competitor, and the main alternative to 
its culture in the international cultural struggle." 
<H5>  DIALOGUE IN ISLAM </H5>
  Columnist Hamid Isma'il writes on page nine the 500-word 
second part of an article headlined "Freedom of Thought in 
Islam." He says the Koran urges meaningful dialogue and opposes 
fanaticism. He notes how early Muslim jurisprudents discussed 
their differences without any fanaticism or encroachment on the 
rights of their opponents. They never allowed their differences 
to develop into conflicts or splits. Isma'il concludes that 
"tolerance and mutual respect characterized the general life of 
our early jurisprudents, who fully understood the spirit of 
Islam and its principles." 
<H5>  THE ISLAMIC ECONOMIC SYSTEM </H5>
  Page 10 contains an approximately 800-word report by Tariq 
'Abdallah on an interview with Dr. Ja'far 'Abd-al-Salam, 
director of al-Azhar's Islamic Economy Center. 'Abd-al-Salam 
stresses the importance of the Islamic economy in pushing the 
economic and social life toward a comprehensive development. He 
notes that current man-made economic systems are trying to deny 
the existence of an Islamic economic system because of its 
competitiveness, which no other economic system can match. He 
argues: "The current dominance of certain economic systems is 
only a mater of time; they will end like other ones, and nothing 
will remain but the economic dealings imposed by Islam." "These 
dealings," he adds, "are not a man-made theory, but ones imposed 
by the book of God [Koran] and the Sunnah [sayings and deeds] of 
his prophet."

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 25 March 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Israeli Academic Center Spies on Islamic Group 
  2. Student Demonstrations Force Israeli Ambassador to 
Work at 
  Home 
  3. Police-Islamic Group Vendetta in Asyut 
  4. Human Rights Violations in Prisons 
  5. Islamist Cleric Defended 
<H5>  ISRAELI ACADEMIC CENTER SPIES ON ISLAMIC GROUP </H5>
  A 5,000-word "analytical study" by Rif'at Sayyid Ahmad on 
page 3 discusses the Israeli Academic Center in Cairo and its 
"spying activity and attempts to penetrate the Islamic Group in 
Egypt, in coordination with the Israeli Embassy and the Mosad 
apparatus, as well as its recruitment of Egyptian youth to spy 
for Israel under the cover of scholarships in the 
Mosad-affiliated Ulpan 'Aqiva Institute in Jerusalem." 
  The study says that AL-SHA'B has obtained a number of 
"secret 
messages" sent by the center to "researchers and spies of both 
sexes." The messages, of which samples in Hebrew and Arabic are 
published, begin by thanking the persons involved for earlier 
services, enclose large sums of money--varying between 2,000 and 
5,000 Egyptian pounds--and close with a specific request for the 
person to continue to send reports and studies about extremist 
Islamic groups in his governorate. The messages are usually 
signed by Dr. Emanu'el Marx, director of the Israeli Academic 
Center in Cairo, and bear the center's stamp and the Israeli 
Embassy's secret stamp. A copy of each message is forwarded to 
the "official concerned" at the embassy. 
  Maintaining that the center violates the protocol under 
which 
it was established, which describes the center as "a private 
organization established under and subject to Egyptian laws," 
the study asks if the center really operates in accordance with 
Egyptian laws and if "collecting information, recruiting spies, 
and penetrating the Islamic group with the goal of destroying it 
and the homeland from within can be described as activities 
subject to Egyptian laws." Noting that the protocol was careful 
to emphasize the dissociation of the center's scientific 
undertakings from any political activity, the study wonders why 
copies of these secret messages are sent to the Israeli Embassy. 
It deduces that "the center practices clear political spying in 
coordination with the Israeli Embassy." 
  The study cites an "official letter" the Israeli Foreign 
Ministry sent to the center's previous director about four 
Egyptians who were supposed to take a course at the Ulpan 'Aqiva 
Institute, "which belongs to Mosad, according to the Jews 
themselves." It asks: Since when does the Israeli Foreign 
Ministry concern itself with teaching Hebrew to Egyptian 
students and researchers? 
  The study also cites the center's "secret report" to the 
Israeli Foreign Ministry, which the Egyptian Foreign Ministry 
knows nothing about. The report talks about the deteriorating 
security situation in Egypt, several attempts to assassinate 
senior officials, and the persons who have been recruited. Of 
these, the report mentions a "counselor who had a financial 
problem with the Jewish Congress in Switzerland in 1988." The 
counselor claimed to have lost $30,000, and the report adds that 
"this sum should be provided so that we will not lose him as an 
important source and a weighty friend." The report also talks 
about the center's spying activity and methods applied in 
penetrating national research groups and requests increased 
financial and moral support for the persons cooperating with it, 
the study says. 
  The study finally notes that an Egyptian working in the 
center has been caught selling the center's documents to Arab 
and foreign reporters. 

<H5>    STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS FORCE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO WORK </H5>
AT HOME 
  A 300-word report by Mu'tazz al-Hadidi and Nasir Faruq on 
page 1 says that Cairo University students organized 
demonstrations at the campus during the past few days, in which 
"they shouted anti-Zionist slogans and denounced the continued 
massacres against the Palestinian people." The students burned 
the Israeli flag, raised the Palestinian flag, and denounced the 
government's feeble stance. 
  The report adds that the Muslim Brotherhood students at 'Ayn 
Shams University organized demonstrations last Tuesday to 
denounce Clinton's remarks about Jerusalem. In a statement they 
issued, the students said that their demonstrations "forced the 
Israeli ambassador in Cairo to perform his job from his home in 
al-Ma'adi, file a request with the government to permit him to 
use 40 guards, and send a memorandum to the Zionist Ministry of 
Tourism, warning it against the organization of excursions to 
Egypt." 
<H5>  POLICE-ISLAMIC GROUP VENDETTA IN ASYUT </H5>
  A 350-word report by Qutb al-'Arabi on page 1 maintains that 
clashes between police and the Islamic Group in Asyut have 
turned into "a fierce vendetta." The report adds that the 
Central and Public Security forces have placed a siege around 
the al-Walidiyah neighborhood in Asyut over a week ago and 
prevented the people from entering or leaving. 
<H5>  HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN PRISONS </H5>
  A 200-word report on pages 1 and 7 says prison inmates have 
been subjected to a one-month "discipline campaign," in which 
dozens were injured and deprived of food and water, their 
personal effects confiscated, and their heads and beards shaved 
inhumanely. 
<H5>  ISLAMIST CLERIC DEFENDED </H5>
  Mustafa Bakri's 1,500-word article on page 4 criticizes the 
government for preventing Islamic cleric 'Umar 'Abd-al-Kafi from 
preaching. He affirms that 'Abd-al-Kafi does not preach 
violence and has always warned against it. 
  Bakri maintains that only groups that pursue "political 
violence" stand to gain from this measure. He emphasizes the 
need for an exhaustive, rudimentary solution for society's 
problems and demands political and intellectual freedom for all 
nationals, without discrimination. 
  A related 150-word report by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im on page 7 
contends that 'Abd-al-Kafi was banned from preaching because of 
security reports submitted to the political leadership on the 
type of audience that frequents his mosque. Security reports 
indicated that the majority of his audience were rich 
businessmen who reside in high-class neighborhoods, state 
officials, and famous artists, 'Abd-al-Mun'im says. These 
reports also noted 'Abd-al-Kafi's ability to persuade his 
listeners. The report adds that the ban was preceded by 
repeated warnings that 'Abd-al-Kafi might be arrested.

  [Text] Jeddah, March 30, (SPA) -- The general secretariat 
of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) [ICO] has 
reaffirmed the Islamic nation's solidarity with the just 
struggle of the Palestinian people to restore their firm, 
unequivocal national rights of self-determination and the 
establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem 
as its capital on Palestinian soil, under the leadership of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole legitimate 
representative of the Palestinian people. 
  This came in a statement issued today by the OIC Secretary 
General Dr. Hamed al-Ghabid on the occasion of the Palestinian 
Land Day on March 30. 
  He said this occasion comes at a time when Palestinian 
people 
are suffering from the escalation of killing, oppression and 
persecution by Israeli authorities since the Hebron massacre. 
  He pointed out that Tuesday's carnage which claimed the 
lives 
of six Palestinians and wounded scores others at the Jabalia 
refugee camps and was committed by Israeli occupation forces is 
a new proof of continued Israeli hostilities and non-commitment 
to the establishment of just and comprehensive peace in the 
region. 
  He said this confirms the necessity to secure immediate 
international protection for the Palestinian people as the 
current situation triggered by Israeli inhuman practices warns 
of a near explosion and an escalation of violence and threatens 
to destroy the peace process. 
  Dr. Ghabid expressed the OIC's strong condemnation of the 
killing and repression carried out by Israeli occupation forces 
against the Palestinian people. 
  He urged the international community to shoulder its 
responsibilities and force Israel to halt its criminal acts 
immediately and secure international protection for the 
Palestinian people.

<F P=106> [Report by Munsif al-Sulaymi: "Moroccan Ulema To Discuss </F>
Sunni-Shiite Rapprochement in Tehran"] 
  [Text] Rabat -- A diplomatic source in Rabat has told 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that a delegation of Moroccan ulema will visit 
Tehran at the beginning of April to attend the meetings of the 
Joint Ulema Committee which was formed last year with the aim of 
bringing the Shiite and Sunni sects closer together. 
  The Moroccan delegation to the meeting, which will be held 
in 
the Iranian capital in the next few days, will include Qarawiyah 
[Academy] ulema and advisers from the Awqaf and Islamic Affairs 
Ministry with the supervision of senior Royal Court officials. 
Most prominent among the Moroccan participants will be Cheikh 
Mohamed Lazrak, Ahmed El Ghazi El Houseyni, and Abdelkarim El 
Daoudi. 
  The meetings of the Joint Committee will be attended on the 
Iranian side by ulema and experts from the Assembly for 
Inter-Islamic Understanding and the Sunni Affairs Committee at 
the Office of the Iranian President. 
  Most prominent among the Iranian figures who will 
participate 
in the meetings will be Hojjat ol-Eslam V'eizzadeh-Khorasani, 
secretary general of the Assembly for Inter-Islamic 
Understanding, and Ishaq Medani, presidential adviser on Sunni 
affairs. 
  The conferees in Tehran will discuss the possibility of 
crystallizing basic features for dialogue between the ulema of 
the two sects and of arriving at general theological common 
grounds of jurisprudence that would form the basis of a program 
for the work of the committee, which was born last year in Rabat 
after lengthy meetings held at the Moroccan Academy. 
  Theological sources who will participate in the meetings say 
that the dialogue between the Moroccan and Iranian ulema will 
concentrate on trying to crystallize the points of agreement 
between the Shiite and Sunni sects which had already been 
underscored at the Rabat meetings, especially the principles of 
Islamic unity and solidarity, tolerance, dialogue, goodwill, and 
rejection of violence, coercion, and arrogance. These 
principles are expected to form the basis of a practical and 
elaborate program for cooperation between the Sunni and Shiite 
theological and jurisprudence institutions, and it is not 
unlikely that rejection of violence and intransigence will be 
one of its main features. That is the issue considered to be at 
the core of the disagreement between the religious and political 
authorities in Iran. 
  The new round of Sunni-Shiite dialogue constitutes another 
endeavor to enhance the call for inter-Islamic understanding and 
for dialogue between the Sunnis and the Shiites originally made 
by King Hassan II at the start of the new hegira century about 
10 years ago. He made that call in his message to Muslims on 
the occasion of the new century and he reaffirmed that call in 
the summer of 1990. The past two years witnessed the beginning 
of the dialogue process between Moroccan and Iranian ulema. 
Last month Morocco welcomed a delegation of Lebanese Shiite 
ulema who attended the Ramadan lectures which are usually 
delivered in the presence of the Moroccan king.

  [Excerpt] The Palestinian National Liberation Movement, 
Fatah, accused the occupying forces of working to destroy the 
peace process by the premeditated assassination of a number of 
its cadres in Gaza. The movement, in a statement yesterday 
evening, held Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin responsible 
for this crime. The following is the full text of the statement: 
  In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate, a 
statement issued by the Palestinian National Liberation 
Movement, Fatah: 
  The new, hideous massacre that the Israeli forces committed 
on 28 March 1994 against a number of cadres and leaders of the 
Fatah's movement's organizational action in Gaza -- and which 
was carried out by an organized and premeditated plot -- 
confirms a determination to destroy the peace process. 
  It was a direct assassination in which targets were picked 
out and monitored by special forces in order to hit the 
officials in charge of organizing our movement and dealing a 
blow to their role of struggle, whether on the peace process 
level or on the level of future building and development. 
  Our movement, Fatah, while stressing its denunciation and 
condemnation of the crime targetted against them on the eve of 
the Cairo meeting aimed at taking measures to restore security 
and stability in Hebron, holds the Israeli Army leadership, 
headed by Defense and Prime Minister Rabin, responsible for this 
crime. 
  We also strongly condemn the position the Israelis initially 
announced when they believed that those assassinated were 
members of Hamas and not Fatah. It is an exposed attempt to 
cause a division between Fatah and Hamas, jihad and the popular 
movement, al-Fidah, al-Nidal, al-Tahrir al-Filistiniyah, and 
others of our people's struggling forces. 
  The attempt to divide the children of our people through 
killings and assassinations is rejected in principle. Our 
concern for the blood of the sons of our movement is the same 
concern for the blood and lives of all strugglers and all our 
struggling, steadfast, and persevering people. 
  The Israeli Government's praise today of the criminal act 
and 
the precision of its execution proves Rabin's determination to 
impose a de facto situation that will impede the continuing 
implemention of measures serving the peace process. It is 
trying to impose realities on us that would lead to hammering a 
wedge between Palestinians and cause trouble between the 
children of our people. 
  Our condemnation of the forces opposing peace imposes upon 
us 
the duty to protect our people by all means, including 
implementation of Resolution 904, which calls for international 
protection for our people, to take all cautionary and 
precautionary methods, and to make strong denunciations to put a 
limit to those criminal acts that legitimize the spilling of 
Palestinian blood. We remind our brothers that we face the same 
treatment as our Algerian brothers received by the secret army 
movement and the settlers in Algeria. It is being repeated on 
our Palestinian land with units of the Israeli Army conniving 
with armed settlers. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Ahmad al-Tibi, one of 'Arafat's advisers, by </F>
Julia Albrecht; place and date not given: "I Was Naively 
Optimistic"] 
  [Text] [Albrecht] The day before yesterday, in the 
evening, the Israeli military shot six al-Fatah members in the 
Jabalyah refugee camp in Gaza. How can such acts of violence be 
prevented? 
  [Al-Tibi] Only by implementing the peace agreement. Even 
though things will not become completely peaceful then, the acts 
of violence will at least be reduced. 
  [Albrecht] Yesterday, it seemed that the peace negotiations 
would be continued now. Is this still true? 
  [Al-Tibi] The PLO Executive Committee is currently 
discussing how things are going to continue after the latest 
crime. 
  [Albrecht] You call it a crime. 
  [Al-Tibi] Yes, it is a crime. It is just a continuation of 
the Hebron massacre. First, Baruch Goldstein shot 30 people. 
Then, during the following eight days, the Israeli military 
shot 30 Palestinians. And now another six Palestinians were 
killed. It will be very difficult to continue the peace talks 
this week. 
  [Albrecht] What is your demand to the Israelis? 
  [Al-Tibi] They should stop killing us. They should make 
sure that the atmosphere changes and they finally see us as 
human beings. 
  [Albrecht] Do you trust Rabin, who is defense minister and 
prime minister at the same time? 
  [Al-Tibi] Defense Minister Rabin is hurting the peace 
efforts of Prime Minister Rabin. 
  [Albrecht] How, do you think, did this most recent shooting 
of Palestinians come about? 
  [Al-Tibi] The only reason that can be behind that is that 
there was an order to stage a massacre. If the Israeli military 
goes to the refugee camps, it does so only for one specific 
reason. In addition, these soldiers were not normal military. 
They were a special unit that went in to shoot people. Who 
gave the order to go to the refugee camp one day before the 
continuation of the talks? 
  [Albrecht] A few days ago you were still optimistic about 
the peace process. You spoke of "historic changes" and of the 
"mutual recognition of the two peoples." 
  [Al-Tibi] Yes, I was naively optimistic. 
  [Albrecht] Why? 
  [Al-Tibi] Because we were very close to an interim solution 
after the massacre in Hebron. Nevertheless, I am sure that, in 
the end, we will implement the peace agreement. 
  [Albrecht] The trust of the Palestinians in their leadership 
is constantly decreasing. While the leadership wants to 
continue the peace talks, the people at the grassroots demand 
not to continue negotiations. 
  [Al-Tibi] Yes, I just had a telephone call from Gaza. I was 
asked to tell 'Arafat that he should stop the peace talks. 
However, there is no alternative to the peace process. Of 
course, our credibility has suffered. The Palestinians still do 
not see any change or improvement. I am sure that at the moment 
when the agreement comes into force and when the Palestinians 
see that the Israeli military withdraws, the support for peace 
will be there again. I know my people.

<F P=106> [By Riyad Mansur] </F>
  [Text] The Hebron emergency committee has addressed a 
strongly worded statement to Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat, warning him against the consequences of signing any 
agreement that deals with their city. 
  In a statement sent to President 'Arafat, a copy of which 
was 
obtained by SAWT AL-SHA'B, the Hebron emergency committee, which 
represents all the city's sectors and factions, said its 
approval should be obtained before the signing of any agreement 
that deals with their city. It called for the removal of all 
settlements through the total elimination of the occupation of 
all the territories, including Jerusalem, and securing 
international protection for the Palestinian people to replace 
the occupation forces according to international laws. 
  Hebron's warning came after prominent figures in the city 
rejected a decision by the Palestinian president to appoint a 
council for the Hebron Governorate. 
  A number of those appointed by 'Arafat as members of the 
council rejected the decision, including Dr. Nabil al-Ja'bari, 
former member of the Palestinian negotiating delegation. 
Al-Ja'bari sent a cable to the Palestinian president telling 
him that he reviewed the name list of the so-called Hebron 
Governorate council and that he rejects being appointed as 
member of this council. 
  In his cable, al-Ja'bari said the difficult circumstances 
facing the Governorate of Hebron and the pure blood watering its 
soil prompts them to close ranks and unite their words to 
confront the common enemy. He said the men of the Governorate 
of Hebron are capable of finding a legislative body with a 
popular base to protect their interests and rights. 
  Al-Ja'bari affirmed to the Palestinian people that he does 
not accept an appointment to this council. He said he was not 
consulted before his name was thrown in, noting this name list 
will not be representative of the Hebron Governorate, no matter 
how many names are included, because there are well-known bases 
for appointment.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian </F>
delegation to the Washington peace talks with Israel, by Samir 
al-Masri in Jerusalem; date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Masri] The Hebron massacre revealed large gaps 
in the Oslo agreement. Some of these gaps are related to the 
subject of protecting the Palestinian people. What prevented 
this issue and others from being discussed in Oslo? 
  ['Urayqat] I am surprised some local and Arab voices are 
trying to exploit this horrible massacre to project the weakness 
or impotence of the Palestinian leadership. I do not think this 
is the fault of the leadership. What is required is that all 
efforts should be pooled to besiege the terrorist Israeli 
action, not to blame the Palestinian leadership. Gaps in the 
Oslo agreement stem originally from the Madrid conference and 
the Israeli terms that were accepted prior to participation in 
the conference. The terms were very unfair to us, although we 
were the last to join the negotiations on the basis of the 
Madrid formula. Accordingly, the unfair terms in Madrid were 
reflected in the Oslo agreement, which revealed pretty obvious 
gaps, including the issues postponed to the final phase. Among 
them is the issue of settlements, which are considered time 
bombs that can explode anytime, anywhere, in the university, 
street, farm, or market. 
  Naturally, agreement to postpone the settlements issue was 
something Palestinians accepted reluctantly, not willingly. The 
massacre proved what we said before: The issue of discussing 
the protection of Palestinians from settler attacks cannot be 
postponed. It has become clear that Israel cannot prevent the 
settlers' terrorist operations. We hope the world will realize 
no negotiations can lead to a successful conclusion of the peace 
process unless the issue of settlements is on the agenda. 
  Once again, we warn against the current campaign that seeks 
to take revenge or disparage the Palestinian leadership. The 
newspapers are devoting 10 percent to the massacre and 90 
percent to Palestinian rift. Concentrating on and deepening the 
Palestinian rift is not in our interest. We take pride in the 
fact that we are the only people in the region who can directly 
criticize the president. This does not exist in any other Arab 
state. I stress that efforts should be pooled toward providing 
protection of the Palestinian people and exposing Israeli 
terrorism after it has developed in an unprecedented manner. 
  [Al-Masri] In the light of the Hebron massacre and based on 
what you said in your reply to the first question, is the Oslo 
formula still valid for negotiations, particularly after the 
criticism of this formula by a big power like Russia, which 
called for a new conference that would supersede the failed 
formula? 
  ['Urayqat] The question to ask is if the peace process based 
on the Madrid formula is valid. This formula was based on the 
principle of land for peace. Thus far, Israel has not abided, 
even formally, by the principle of withdrawal from the 
territories occupied in 1967, with the exception of talk about 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Israeli practices on the 
ground indicate the continuation of settlement activity, 
intransigence, and terrorism. There is also Israel's failure to 
implement any international legitimacy resolutions. This 
largely overshadows the entire peace process. The question now 
is if the current peace process between the Arabs and Israel has 
any future. The matter is no longer connected with a 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement. The have endured the major 
burden of the peace process because they were in the forefront. 
The question now concerns all. It does not have to do only 
with Oslo, but the entire peace process on all the tracks. I 
think Israel's failure to abide by withdrawal raises serious 
questions about the feasibility of the peace process. 
  [Al-Masri] How do you view the recent Russian initiative? 
  ['Urayqat] It is very good. I am glad Russia has begun to 
get out of its seclusion and its complete subservience to the 
United States. When we began the Madrid conference there were 
two loud voices. A few months later, the Soviet Union collapsed 
and the United States was alone in the arena, drafting and 
deciding world policy. The Russian initiative signals the 
beginning of Russian disengagement from the United States. 
Russia has begun to realize that the peace process in its 
current form cannot succeed. Consequently, Russia has begun to 
demand a new mechanism. This is a good step that should be 
studied thoroughly and carefully. It should also be supported 
even if Israel and the United States reject it. 
  [Al-Masri] But Russia is still politically dependent on the 
U.S. Administration. Some believe the Russian initiative is 
nothing but a tactical move made in agreement with the United 
States to put indirect pressure on Israel. This is because 
Russia's need for aid renders it unable to lay out a foreign 
policy that is independent of U.S. policy, at least under the 
current circumstances. How do you view that? 
  ['Urayqat] In light of its economic and political problems, 
I 
cannot tell what Russia can or cannot do. However, no one 
should underestimate Russia's regional, continental, or 
international weight. Therefore, Russia's noncompliance with 
U.S. decisions is a step that must be encouraged and blessed by 
all Arabs. As for the U.S. stand on the Russian initiative, I 
believe decision makers at the U.S. State Department still think 
in accordance with the Likud's mentality. Clinton's objective 
is to emerge before public opinion with a procedural, formal 
solution aimed at saving Israel, not the peace process. It has 
been proved to us that the U.S. decision making circles are 
controlled by the Likud mentality. They are more Israeli than 
Israel itself. Therefore, the U.S. reservation about the 
Russian initiative raises doubts about the fate of the peace 
process. 
  [Al-Masri] Palestinians had linked the resumption of the 
negotiations to the return of the Marj al-Zuhur deportees. We 
know what happened later. Afterward, Palestinians insisted on a 
certain position regarding the crossings issue. However, later, 
they approved the Cairo agreement. Will the same thing happen 
regarding the Hebron massacre? Or will the Palestinian 
leadership learn from its previous policies? 
  ['Urayqat] We cannot judge this issue in isolation from the 
prevailing circumstances. If we want to deal with politics, we 
cannot raise the same slogans all the time. Politics is a 
continuous process through which the politician seeks to achieve 
the best of what can be achieved. But such attempts do not take 
place in isolation from the various parties's conflicting 
interests and the pressures that are being exercised. One day, 
we will disclose how the Palestinian delegation returned to the 
negotiations and the circumstances and pressures that are 
exercised against the delegation on all levels. The question is 
not that of making concessions or not. It really has to do with 
people's lives and security. If the peace process does not 
protect human lives, then what use does it have? Therefore, the 
Palestinian delegation cannot hold negotiations with Israel if 
there is no agreement on international protection for the 
Palestinians. 
  [Al-Masri] The White House announced that it did not want 
Palestinian preconditions for the resumption of the negotiations 
and that it would exercise the veto at the UN Security Council 
if the PLO insists on its conditions. Does this mean that the 
PLO will return to the negotiations without preconditions? Or 
will it ignore the U.S. position? 
  ['Urayqat] The U.S. position is totally biased toward 
Israel. 
The Palestinian leadership is coming under tremendous U.S., 
Israeli, and domestic pressure. I believe the time is not right 
for inciting inter-Palestinian differences. It is time for 
Palestinian agreement on the demand for international 
protection. The Palestinian leadership's impasse has been going 
on for years. It is taking various forms and dimensions. I 
hope attempts to strike at the unity of our people will be 
unsuccessful. I hope the Palestinian leadership will be able to 
circumvent this impasse. We are sure the Palestinian leadership 
is well aware that Palestinian demands are not conditions, but 
legitimate demands to ensure the success of the peace process. 
  [Al-Masri] Do you think there is a possibility of Israel 
abandoning the protection of Israeli settlements in the West 
Bank, especially since Rabin's legal advisers counseled him not 
to make a hasty decision to evacuate the Hebron settlement 
because the court might reject the government's decision? 
  ['Urayqat] The ball is now in Rabin's court. He must make 
the courageous decision. If they want peace, they cannot 
continue the settlements. It is either the settlements or the 
agreement. We call at the outset for dismantling the settlement 
in the heart of Hebron and the one in the heart of Nabulus, 
because they are elements of tension and pressure for the peace 
process. 
  [Al-Masri] What issues were on the Washington talks agenda? 
Is it true they were confined to negotiations on election 
arrangements and forming the transitional council? 
  ['Urayqat] The discussion was not confined to what you 
mentioned, but included several other geographic issues 
concerning the Gaza-Jericho agreement. The Oslo agreement 
covers less than 10 percent of the occupied territories. 
Therefore, the Oslo agreement is one of many required steps 
that would cover all the occupied territories. The Washington 
talks center on the other issues that have not been discussed. 
In addition to the issue of elections and the formation of the 
legislative council, we placed on the agenda issues such as the 
redeployment of Israeli forces in the West Bank and a review of 
military orders applied on the Palestinian side, and then the 
complete transfer of authority in the occupied territories. An 
agreement was reached on a discussion of these issues in 
Washington. However, the terrorist Israeli operation in Hebron 
cast a shadow on the negotiations. As a result, we suspended 
the talks. 
  [Al-Masri] What use are the bilateral negotiation in 
Washington now when other negotiations are taking place under 
'Arafat's leadership and supervision in Paris, Taba, Cairo, and 
other places? Don't you think the negotiations here have a 
formal nature, given that other secret talks have always been 
held behind the scene? 
  ['Urayqat] We do not differentiate between the leadership 
inside the territory and the leadership outside. At the 
beginning of the negotiations there were unfair conditions, such 
as the postponement of the settlements issue, preventing the PLO 
from directly participating, and not allowing delegation members 
from Jerusalem. Now I am proud of the fact that there are no 
restrictions concerning membership in negotiations. The PLO is 
negotiating directly and is freely selecting the negotiating 
delegation. 
  [Al-Masri] Why have the links with the Palestinian 
delegation 
to the bilateral been cut, given that they have political weight 
in the occupied territories and they participated in long rounds 
of negotiations during which they gained enough experience in 
talking to Israeli negotiators. Moreover, they know many 
details because they live in the occupied territory. 
  ['Urayqat] The delegation is not an establishment or a 
permanent company. It is formed in accordance with missions. 
These members carried out definite tasks. Before the Hebron 
massacre we talked about reforming the Palestinian delegation 
for the bilateral peace talks. Many of these names are 
candidate members. I assure you that the question is not linked 
to individuals. Nobody is allowed to prefer his own political 
stands in accordance with his own place in the political 
formula. The delegation is composed of individuals tasked with 
a certain mission by the PLO central command. The command is 
capable of deciding their continuation or otherwise. 
  [Al-Masri] Why the delay in forming the Palestinian 
establishments or naming their heads or officials? 
  ['Urayqat] The United States leveled these accusations at us 
twice: once in a meeting with Christopher in Jerusalem and once 
in Amman. In fact, we formed establishments such as the economic 
council for construction and development and appointed its 
technical staff, which has been working for years. I don't know 
why, but whenever the Palestinian side attains the capability to 
work independently, we come under attack and criticism as though 
the specter of trusteeship never leaves us. 
  [Al-Masri] The subject of elections raises an argument 
between proponents and opponents who are afraid that these 
elections will produce elements that have no links with the PLO 
and are probably opposed to the settlement. Other voices 
believe that it is important to protect the Palestinian 
community through democracy. How do you see this? 
  ['Urayqat] Elections are one of the most important 
guarantees 
for the existence of the Palestinian people, but this democracy 
should be real and should not be a mere facade to satisfy the 
authority's objectives. I am pleased to say that the first 
decision signed by President 'Arafat after the Oslo agreement 
was the formation of a committee assigned to deal with elections 
and local government, and that he appointed me as the head of 
this committee. I believe that the time is ripe for elections 
because elections not only give legitimacy to the continuation 
of the new state regime, but also give it a power that protects 
the Palestinian people. I think that elections should be held 
as soon as possible. Some people, who have vindicative aims, 
may raise the pretext of instability. The strategic point of 
view says real democracy is one of the pillars for the 
continuation of the Palestinian people. 
  [Al-Masri] What is the elections and local government 
committee doing to make these elections a reality? Are the 
elections you speak about local or legislative elections? 
  ['Urayqat] The elections committee is comprised of brothers 
Faruq al-Sarraf, 'Ali al-Safarini, Rami 'Abd-al-Hadi, Muhammad 
'Ishtayah, and Zahirah Kamal. This committee, which I chair, 
operates on several horizons, including the legal horizon, with 
the aim of attaining a unified law for municipal and council 
elections in the West Bank, and laying down the basic law for 
council elections and the electoral system. 
  We have 480 population centers in 29 municipalities, 82 
rural 
councils, and 26 camps, in addition to 347 population centers 
that do not have any councils. This situation has prevailed 
since the time of Ottoman rule, and this emphasizes the need for 
reorganizing the structural map of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
The only three existing governorates cannot continue to work 
without setting up new governorates such as Tulkarm, Janin, 
Qalqilyah, and Bethlehem governorates. New municipalities 
should also be formed, and rural councils should be set up in 
some villages. This does not mean that development will be 
carried out from above, but rather should include all levels. 
Some 72 percent of the rural areas suffer from the absence of 
councils, and are run by mukhtars. This is a dangerous defect 
that should be tackled by setting up municipal or rural councils 
to carry out the required construction projects. In addition to 
this, the committee is working to carry out censuses, and cadres 
are being trained to run elections. The elections will be held 
on various levels; the national, legislative, local, municipal, 
and rural levels as well as other levels. 
  [Al-Masri] Will the elections be delayed because the 
Palestinian side is not prepared yet, or will they be held on 13 
July in accordance with Oslo agreement? 
  ['Urayqat] The holding of elections is not a decision to be 
made by 'Arafat or Rabin alone, it is a process that has long 
procedures that should be taken into consideration. We need 150 
voting centers and about 6,000 supervisors and trainers on 
supervision. There is a need for a UN committee that represents 
Europe, the cosponsors of peace talks, Canada, Australia, Japan, 
and China to observe elections. All this requires time, and now 
we are in late March. This means that it is impossible to hold 
elections on July, but we will do all we can to hold the 
elections as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the APF on the 18th anniversary of Land </F>
Day] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
Masses of our militant Palestinian people, sons of our people in 
the diaspora, sons of our Arab and Islamic nation, and free men 
of the world, 30 March 1994 is the 18th anniversary of Land Day. 
Our heroic Palestinian people are facing the ugliest conspiracy 
to liquidate their national cause through the Oslo and Cairo 
agreements in which 'Arafat gave in to all the Zionist-U.S. 
dictates and conditions, relinquished the Palestinian people's 
historical and national rights, and canceled all their 
sacrifices over 70 years. 
  The Land Day anniversary this year falls on the 40th day of 
the massacre in the Ibrahimi mosque in steadfast Hebron. This 
massacre highlighted the reality and essence of the 
Zionist-'Arafatist peace when scores of glorious martyrs fell, 
and hundreds were wounded. The fascist Zionist army followed 
this with other massacres in the same city and the other 
occupied territories in response to the wave of popular wrath 
that unfolded throughout the occupied territories and which 
resulted in more heroes, martyrs, and wounded. 
  This anniversary this year also coincides with the uprising 
of our militant masses in the 1948 occupied territories. This 
confirms the unity of our people, the unity of their land and 
fate, and their endless readiness for struggle to foil all the 
Zionist schemes to liquidate their national cause. 
  Masses of our people, and sons of the land: This land has 
been yours since time immemorial. The signature of a defeatist 
traitor will not constitute an edict that changes the name of 
the owner of the land. The land is yours, and yours is the sea, 
the river, the valley, and the mountain. Yours are the oranges, 
grapes, figs, and olives. 
  O Hebron, the deep wound of Palestine, the mother of 
martyrs, 
we shed tears on your doorstep but we will not give in. The 
pledge remains as it. O Hebron, you remain in the lap of 
Palestine and in the heart of the nation. The series of 
massacres the occupation army has carried out and is 
perpetrating under direct orders from Rabin -- 'Arafat's partner 
in the Washington, Oslo, Taba, Cairo agreement -- have stepped 
up the Palestinian popular call for the resignation of 'Arafat 
and his deviationist clique, for halting the farce of 
negotiations, and for toppling the U.S.-Zionist settlement 
course. The massacres have also led to the stepping up of calls 
for the withdrawal of the negotiating delegation, for the 
dismantling of the settlements, for international protection for 
the sons of our people throughout the entire occupied 
territories, for their right to determine their fate on their 
national soil, and for toppling the deviationist clique and its 
main emblem, which have placed our people and cause in this 
dilemma. The recent agreement with the Zionist enemy has 
constituted a cover for the Hebron massacre and what took place 
before it. All this confirms the unequivocal fact that 
coexistence with this enemy is impossible and that the struggle 
against it will continue. 
  O people of Palestine inside and in the diaspora, o people 
of steadfast and mujahid Hebron: The popular situation caused 
by the massacre, and the militant momentum the heroic intifadah 
is witnessing -- in spite of the comprehensive siege and 
systematic acts of mass killing at the hands of Rabin's army 
gangs, 'Arafat's partner -- force the Palestinian and Arab 
nationalist and Islamic forces to understand the features of 
this stage and to work to develop struggle and jihad to higher 
and more effective standards on the ground. They must close 
ranks and adopt militant programs inside and outside the 
occupied territories in order to pull the rug out from under the 
feet of the capitulative leadership, to confront the onslaught, 
to restore respect to struggle and jihad, to put to use the 
furious popular sentiment, and to work to topple 'Arafat and his 
deviationist and relinquishing clique on the path of continued 
struggle and jihad in order to realize all objectives of the 
Palestinian people to attain full liberation and independence. 
  Our observation of Land Day and the 40th day since the 
martyrdom at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque reemphasizes our 
adherence to the unity of the people, the unity of land, and the 
unity of blood that we will not relinquish no matter what the 
pressures, difficulties, and obstacles might be. We pledge to 
the souls of the martyrs -- the martyrs of Land Day in the 
Galilee, and the martyrs of the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque in 
Hebron -- to remain faithful to their pure blood. We in the APF 
[Alliance of Palestinian Forces] emphasize that there will be no 
peace in the region without the collapse of the sin represented 
in the presence of Israel in the heart of our Arab and Islamic 
nation. We promise our people that we will carry out serious 
and unionist actions, burn the occupied land under the 
occupiers' feet, and topple the symbols of relinquishment, 
capitulation, and treason. 
  On these two anniversaries, we ask our people to carry out 
the following activities: 
  1. In the occupied territories: To escalate the intifadah 
and emphasize the unity of land and people. 
  2. In the diaspora: To observe a general and full strike on 
Wednesday morning 30 March 1994 in all camps and Palestinian 
residential areas in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. To stage a 
sit-in in front of the offices of the International Committee of 
the Red Cross in the diaspora countries on the morning of 5 
April. We also call on the masses of our people to participate 
in the popular rally the APF will sponsor at al-Nujum Cinema in 
al-Yarmuk Camp, southern Damascus, at 1800 on Tuesday 5 April 
1994, and to take part in all rallies that will be held in 
Amman, Beirut, Aleppo, Hims, and all Palestinian camps. 
  O relatives of noble martyrs: Your martyrs are in heaven and 
will be a mercy for you and the nation. They will remain in the 
hearts. Hail to the souls of the our martyrs in Hebron, the 
Galilee, and Gaza, and all martyrs of Palestine and nation. 
Hail to all sons of our people in the homeland and abroad. 
Shame and disgrace to the fascist Zionists, shame and disgrace 
to 'Arafat and his deviationist clique, glory to the martyrs, 
victory to the fighting masses. 
[Signed] The Alliance of Palestinian Forces

<F P=106> [By Sa'id 'Ayyad] </F>
  [Text] Bethlehem, QUDS PRESS -- A former Palestinian 
negotiator has said that the arrangements reached by Palestinian 
and Israeli negotiators recently and which provide for the 
deployment of police units comprised from Israeli, Norwegian, 
and Palestinian elements "are a retreat from the prevailing 
situation and might create a more harmful one." 
  In a statement to QUDS PRESS, Ghassan al-Khatib, former 
member of the Palestinian delegation to the bilateral talks, 
expressed apprehension that these arrangements "might reinforce 
and consolidate the existing situation, which includes an 
unacceptable settlement presence even in the short-term." 
  Al-Khatib, who is a leading member of the Palestinian 
People's Party, believes that the task of the joint police force 
"will not only be to protect the security of Palestinians but 
also that of the settlers." He pointed out that this "will mean 
recognizing the reality of their presence and their right to 
security. This is recognition and reinforcement of a reality 
which everyone has admitted is the real cause for the present 
grave situation in Hebron." 
  The Palestinian negotiator said that "solving the problem on 
the basis of a joint Palestinian-Israeli-international police 
force reflects the Israeli concept of the problem. Namely, that 
it is a conflict between Arab residents and Jewish settlers and 
that the Israeli authority is a neutral party in this conflict." 
He said that the arrangements which are being talked about "are 
not a step toward ending settlement activity, but a step toward 
its consolidation. They do not constitute a guarantee for the 
security of Palestinians, but will complicate the security 
situation." 
  The former Palestinian negotiator called on the Palestinian 
leadership to reassess its position with regard to this issue. 
He said that "one must not accept any arrangement that does not 
include the removal of settlements, especially in Hebron." He 
added that the Palestinian side "must not rely on undeclared or 
unofficial promises because these promises seek to persuade, 
after which the Israeli position will return to its customary 
intransigence."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Gaza Mayor Dr. Zakariya Makki, in </F>
Gaza, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo, date not given; from the 
"Dialogue From Afar" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Jundi] Let us begin with the situation inside 
the occupied Arab territories, especially since yesterday marked 
the Land Day anniversary. 
  [Makki] Actually, the assassination of six leaders of the 
Fatah Hawks in Jabalya -- and I mean assassination -- was 
deliberate while peace talks were in progress yesterday to 
resume Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. This caused a very 
severe shock in Gaza. 
  The Gaza Strip is in a very sad and volatile situation. The 
streets are volatile and the people's feelings are inflamed. 
People are upset because of the loss of good young men who were 
assassinated without warning and without any resistance on their 
part. They were not going to war but to attend a ceremony when 
they were assassinated by special forces or Israeli military 
units.... 
  [Al-Jundi, interrupting] Israel's justification that the 
Israeli (?forces) thought they were members of Hamas is 
unacceptable. We would like to note here that there is no 
difference between the Hamas Movement and the Fatah Movement, as 
both are Palestinian movements. 
  [Makki] This is certain. As for us, we do not distinguish at 
all between all the Palestinian movements. Today we are 
speaking about peace, but how can we speak about peace while 
these youths are being killed by those who say that they are 
negotiating with parties belonging to Fatah? The death of these 
youths caused severe agitation among the public and general 
resentment in the strip. Furthermore, the Strip is under a 
security siege and in a bad economic situation and people view 
peace as an Israel trick on the Palestinians. One hand 
negotiates and the other kills the Palestinian people. [words 
indistinct] and this is totally unacceptable. 
  [Al-Jundi] Do you believe that the current deterioration of 
the situation in the occupied Arab territories is a natural 
result of the delay in implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord? 
  [Makki] We have repeatedly said that the continued 
occupation 
of Palestinian land in Gaza, the West Bank, and Hebron is a 
source of friction and agitation. The Israelis must now 
withdraw immediately, leave the Palestinians to handle their own 
affairs, and allow the Palestinian police to enter the West Bank 
and Gaza. 
  These malicious settlers who do not understand any human 
ethics and relationships also must not remain among us in Gaza, 
Hebron, or elsewhere because they represent time bombs in the 
West Bank and Gaza, causing friction, disturbances, and problems 
between the Palestinians and Israelis. 
  If a genuine peace is sought, I believe that the 
settlements--and this fact has been proved--cannot exist under a 
real peace between the Arabs and Israelis. 
  [Al-Jundi] What do you think about Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin's previous statements that he is not willing to 
evacuate the Jewish settlers from the Palestinian city of Hebron? 
  [Makki] We tell all the Israelis: If you truly seek peace 
and not world publicity -- they gained a great deal in the peace 
process [sentence incomplete as heard]. We say to Mr. Rabin 
that if he sought a genuine peace, Rabin had the opportunity to 
remove these settlers after what they did in the Hebron 
massacre, which is a disgusting act for anyone. 
  [Al-Jundi] Can we say that there can be no peace in the 
occupied lands as long as there are settlements, which are time 
bombs? 
  [Makki] Most certainly, if these settlements remain on 
Palestinian land the word peace will be meaningless. I know 
these settlers well. They are charged and hateful. They hate 
every Arab, every Muslim, and all Palestinians, and they are 
armed. 
  Hence, we believe that to achieve a genuine peace surgery 
should be performed to remove all factors that hamper the 
process. I believe that the most important thing is for the 
settlements to be removed immediately and for Israel to 
implement the peace agreement by withdrawing its forces. Of 
course, we seek peace from the bottom of our hearts and this 
makes us wonder how can we face the public. The Palestinian 
people are very aware. 
  We talk with them [the Israelis] openly and sit with them in 
Taba, Cairo, Madrid, Washington, and New York while our people 
are being killed everywhere. 
  What happened in Gaza today is considered a massacre, a 
slaughter. The Hebron killings happened inside the mosque, but 
scores were also killed outside the mosque. This confirms that 
there are instructions issued to these military forces to 
immediately kill anyone carrying a stone, wearing a mask, or 
belonging to this or that organization.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abir Fu'ad: "AL-SABIL Visits Al-Quds Radio in </F>
Damascus"] 
  [Excerpts] For years, we have been hearing Al-Quds Radio. 
It carries a militant voice that we have missed very much, 
especially these days when we are almost suffocated by the dust 
of [the Arab-Israeli] talks, whose only objective is to destroy 
our cause and terminate our existence. This radio conveys to us 
the daily heroic actions of our kinsfolk in Palestine, always 
accompanied by songs of revolution and jihad. 
  It is unlike the other Arab radios filling the airwaves. It 
has been distinctly successful in attracting listeners of other 
radios inside and outside the occupied territories. Having won 
keen and regular listeners, the radio dedicated all its 
resources to reporting on and following Palestinian events 
anywhere at anytime. 
  When I arrived in Damascus, I immediately began to look for 
the radio building. Few people were familiar with the place. 
Therefore, it took me some time before I managed to arrive at 
the radio building. It was not a big surprise to me when I 
found nothing but a small, old four-story building, the first 
story of which is occupied by the radio station. This building 
is surrounded by shops and other residential buildings. The 
only thing that distinguishes it from other buildings is an 
armed guard standing at its gate. I was not surprised because I 
knew that the radio officials wanted to keep its location secret 
so that it would not become an easy target for attacks or acts 
of sabotage. 
  Since its establishment, this radio has continued its role 
of 
invigorating our Palestinian people and their struggle against 
their enemies, both overt and covert, including those who hide 
their treachery and treason under guises of political wisdom. 
  Al-Quds Radio has managed to worry and annoy Israel, which 
was prompted jam it despite the high costs, which has amounted 
to millions of dollars. For this purpose, Israel used jamming 
devices at the building of the Ramallah radio, something Israel 
has not done against any other Arab radio. 
  Abu-Shadi [Fadl Shururu], director general of the al-Quds 
Radio, says: Al-Quds Radio began its experimental transmission 
in 1987, and officially announced its name on 1 January 1988, 
when it began to identify itself as: "Al-Quds, the Palestinian 
Arab Radio on the Road to Liberation of Land and Man." Only 20 
days after the beginning of its official transmission, the 
Zionists began to jam the radio on the recommendation of 
terrorist Mike Gurdus, [Israeli radio's] specialist in 
monitoring Arab radios in the Middle East. 
  Not long after the blessed intifadah broke out, Al-Quds 
Radio began broadcasting to become one of the continuous factors 
of incitement for our kinsfolk to continue struggle and 
steadfastness in face of the Zionist enemy. 
  The radio broadcasts statements issued by Palestinian 
resistance factions, which call for strikes and demonstrations. 
It also transmits patriotic songs and follows Palestinian 
developments and broadcasts these developments as soon as the 
necessary information is available. All this explain the 
enemy's costly attempt to jam the radio. 
  In one occasion, Al-Quds Radio was forced to make 56 
frequency changes to evade the Zionist jamming. The 
continuation of these jamming attempts by the enemy gave the 
workers of the radio lots of experience in changing frequencies 
quickly -- in less than two minutes. It is noteworthy that the 
radio broadcasts on three waves: the medium, short, and FM waves. 
  The radio's transmission begins at 0900 and lasts until 
2000. 
Hence, the question is raised: If the radio shoulders the 
responsibility of this important media role to serve our people 
and their cause, are the limited transmission hours enough to 
realize this objective? 
  Abu-Shadi says: We wish that we could continue transmitting 
24 hours a day because we need to maintain contacts with our 
people, but this requires huge material capabilities that are 
not available at present. In fact, some large quarters are 
prepared to buy our radio on the condition they would turn it 
into one of their media horns that markets their ideas and 
policies. 
  The small size of the place is another obstacle to the 
development and growth of the radio. As I said before, the 
radio is in one floor of a building in which all radio 
departments, including the studios, are present. 
  In the editorial room, which is no more than 3 by 4 square 
meters, nearly eight people sit at a rectangular table to edit 
news and write reports. You can see the editor of the Russian 
newscast beside the editor of the Hebrew newscast, and beside 
them sits the editor of the Arabic newscast. The constraints of 
the place may cause some problems here or there, but of course 
does not prevent the continuation of work in constant force and 
enthusiasm. [passage omitted] 
  The radio also seeks to effect communication with non-Arab 
communities. For, it airs programs targeting Jewish immigrants 
in Palestine. The radio airs its programs in seven languages, 
in addition to Arabic. These languages are the following: 
Hebrew, Russian, French, Italian, English, Spanish, and 
Romanian. As a matter of fact, the radio has not thus far 
received any real feedback from target listeners on these 
programs. But, the radio director is almost certain that the 
radio programs are also listened to by Jews in Palestine. The 
very reasons that prompt the Palestinians of the occupied 
territories to listen to this radio's programs are bound to 
prompt Jews to do so, the radio director argues. 
  Having debated with Abu-Shadi the media role being played by 
Palestinian factions, I wanted to ask him about the clearly 
stepped-up Islamic sentiments enshrined in the programs aired by 
this radio, particularly since the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], which is 
managing this radio station, has not been known as a front that 
promotes Islamic sensibilities. When I asked him this question, 
he was disturbed. He retorted, saying: The fact that the radio 
was launched by the PFLP-GC does not mean that it belongs to the 
PFLP-GC. Al-Quds Radio is the radio of the Palestinian masses 
inside and outside the occupied territories. It is the radio of 
those denied the chance to make their voices heard. It is not 
affiliated with any Palestinian resistance faction. At any 
rate, I hope that we will someday become Muslims in deed, and 
not only in word, Abu-Shadi added. 
  Fast reporting is an equally important factor that has 
contributed to the radio's wide popularity. The radio is quick 
to report on news stories. By the way, the radio has listeners 
in various parts of the Arab homeland, as well as Europe. 
Abu-Shadi adds: Fast reporting, and accuracy in broadcasting 
developments in the occupied territories have enhanced the 
radio's reputation, and allowed it to increase the number of its 
listeners. These factors have also given rise to myths about 
the radio. When the radio first began transmission, there were 
numerous guesses as to where it was transmitting from. The 
radio was reported to have been transmitting from a secret place 
in Jerusalem. In an opinion poll conducted in London last year, 
Al-Quds Radio came ahead of both the BBC Arabic Service and 
Monte Carlo Radio in terms of preference by listeners. 
  To obtain its news stories, the radio depends on a network 
of 
correspondents inside the occupied territories. Abu-Shadi 
believes that it is enough for a Palestinian to be a true 
patriot enjoying a high sense of responsibility toward his cause 
and people to qualify as a correspondent for the Al-Quds Radio. 
Zionist troops once apprehended several correspondents of the 
radio in Gaza, Rafah, and Nabulus. But, these correspondents 
had already trained others to do their job and accomplish news 
assignments. Correspondents use fax machines to send their news 
reports to the radio in Damascus. The radio also has 
subscriptions with several international news agencies; and this 
enables the radio to cover Arab and international developments. 
Nonetheless, the radio airs news agency-datelined Palestinian 
news stories only after it receives a confirmation of these 
stories from its correspondents in the occupied territories. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Fu'ad] Since the convocation of the Madrid conference, and 
even before that, the Al-Quds Radio has been opposed to the 
peace process. What will happen to your radio if Syria 
concludes a peace treaty with Israel? 
  [Shururu] We at Al-Quds Radio still believe that what is 
being done is capitulation, rather than peace. We mean what we 
say. How can we expect the achievement of peace at a time when 
our people are still displaced, and when their objectives are 
yet to be achieved? If the Israelis give the Arabs back the 
Golan and southern Lebanon, and deny me the right to regain my 
land and national soil, there will be no peace. As long as 
there is a good reason for Palestinian children to continue to 
carry stones, there is no room for any talk of peace. If and 
when the Syrian leadership signs a peace agreement with Israel, 
providing for a recognition of Israel, something which I cannot 
believe even if I were to see it with my own eyes, then we can 
discuss this development. In this regard, I would like to 
emphasize that Al-Quds Radio is not the only weapon in the hands 
of our people. It is an instigator. Our people's struggle will 
not come to a halt with any cessation in the radio's 
transmission. 
  [Fu'ad] Then, is it possible that Al-Quds Radio will halt 
its 
transmission? 
  [Shururu, smiling] If this were to be forced on us, there is 
nothing we can do to ward off such a development. 
  [Fu'ad] This is Al-Quds Radio, the Palestinian Arab radio 
along the path of liberating land and man. It has continued to 
exemplify a mature media perspective. We hope that many of our 
Arab radio stations will emulate Al-Quds Radio. We acknowledge 
that the example this radio has provided is not flawless, for 
there is always room for improvement in the radio's performance. 
  We salute Al-Quds Radio and its employees.

  [Text] Tehran, March 31, IRNA -- A Foreign Ministry 
spokesman on Thursday rejected claims by Armenian officials that 
Iran had commented on the reasons behind the March 17 crash of 
the Iranian aircraft in Karabakh region before a team of experts 
finished its probe into the issue. 
  The spokesman, Mahmud Mohammadi, termed as "untrue" the 
claim 
raised by a spokesman of the Armenian president on Wednesday 
that Iran had made its comments on the crash even before the 
completion of the investigation by a team of Iranian experts. 
Based on the report filed by the fact-finding team of experts, 
the Iranian Foreign Ministry issued its statement last Monday, 
saying Armenian troops in Karabakh had missiled down the Iranian 
aircraft killing all 32 passengers and crew members aboard. 
Mohammadi said that at present some details relevant to minor 
aspects of the crash were being followed up. 
  Over the past two days, the ISLAMIC REPUBLIC NEWS AGENCY has 
contacted Armenian officials in Yerevan and Armenian diplomats 
in Tehran to inquire about their views on the statement of the 
Iranian Foreign Ministry concerning the crash but none of them 
have yet made any formal comment on the issue. 
  The C-130 which was bound to Tehran from Moscow with 
families 
of Iranian diplomats on board exploded in mid air and crashed in 
Armenian held Karabakh moments after it contacted the Yerevan 
control tower at 19:10 hours GMT.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The first political commentary of today is in 
connection with the outcome of the investigation into the cause 
of the crash of an Iranian C-130 plane in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
With the issuing of a statement by our country's Foreign 
Ministry, which highlights the direct role of the Armenian 
Government in shooting down the Iranian transport plane over 
Karabakh, public opinion has become more sensitive about the 
incident. 
  The cause of the incident, which resulted in the death of 
several Iranian diplomats and their families, was scrutinized by 
a special investigative team, comprising Iranian Foreign 
Ministry and Air Force experts. Finally, in light of bona fide 
proof and undeniable evidence, Armenia's responsibility in the 
incident was ascertained. 
  For some time now the Government of Armenia has fanned the 
flames of the Karabakh dispute and, by trampling on the 
independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan, has violated that country's sovereignty. Despite 
ostensible support for Iran's peace-seeking and mediation moves, 
it has, in practice, rendered all efforts at mediation 
fruitless. Therefore, the shooting down of the Iranian 
transport plane would naturally result in Iran's doubting 
Armenia's goodwill and intentions. 
  Although the Government of Armenia has so far not clearly 
admitted its responsibility for the shooting down of the Iranian 
C-130 plane, the existing proof and evidence have shed 
sufficient light on the matter. Therefore, it is necessary for 
the Armenian Government to take steps, as soon as possible, to 
bring to trial and punish the perpetrators of this crime. Also, 
the Islamic Republic of Iran reserves the right to follow up the 
crime and claim damages for the families of the victims. 
  Undoubtedly Armenia should be aware of the importance of its 
relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and not be 
influenced by foreign suggestions and mar and destabilize its 
relations with Iran any further. That would be of no benefit to 
that country. Rebuilding those ties, which have been maintained 
under the most difficult conditions, would necessitate a great 
deal of effort on Armenia's part.

  [Text] It has been precisely clarified, following the 
return of the special expert team of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran to Karabakh, that the C-130 plane belonging to the Iranian 
Air Force has crashed in Karabakh region due to a missile fired 
by the Armenian forces stationed there. 
  Based on the investigations conducted by the Iranian team, 
the plane had deviated course before the crash due to a 
technical problem. The area's control tower and navigation 
facilities did not respond to the pilot's request for help and 
assistance either. 
  It must be noted that the Iranian expert team dispatched to 
the scene of the C-130 crash did not manage to find the plane's 
black box, which could answer so many puzzles. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Ministry -- in the 
wake of the announcement of the final results of the experts 
about the March 28th incident -- condemning the downing of the 
C-130 plane, mentioned the bitter tragedy as a clear indication 
of the adverse consequences and the rest of the situation in the 
region [sentence as heard]. 
  The Iranian plane was carrying 32 people -- including 13 
crew, 19 passengers, and 17 women and children belonging to 
diplomats' relations as well as two Iranian students residing in 
Moscow -- who were returning home on March 18 to spend the New 
Year holidays. In the incident even the lives of the innocent 
people and other countries' nationals were seriously exposed to 
danger. 
  Assuredly, the responsibility for these acts lies with the 
people who are trying to step up the disputes. It is necessary 
that proper measures be taken to prevent occurrence of such 
pitiable incidents. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran, since the outbreak of the 
Karabakh conflict, laying emphasis on the importance of peace 
and security in the region, has called on the belligerent sides 
to search for a peaceful way. To this end, the impartial 
mediation by Tehran and the periodical visits of the Iranian 
officials to Baku and Yerevan indicate honesty in the part of 
Iran to grant help peacefully solve the Karabakh crisis 
[sentence as heard]. 
  In (?a lot) of the experts' opinions, the Islamic Republic 
of 
Iran reserves the right of legal pursuit of the plane crash and 
fulfilment of the rights of the incident victims and 
compensation for the survivors of the horrible incident. 
Undoubtedly those behind the incident should be answerable to 
such inappropriate acts. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Ministry on Monday 
March 28th released a statement requesting the Armenian 
Government to identify and punish those behind the incident. It 
is natural that such a measure by the Armenian Government can 
avert the recurrence of such incidents, which in no way (?help 
to) resolve the current disputes and improve the atmosphere 
prevalent in the regional relations.

him. Our colleague in Africa reports: 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] During this 
meeting, the Guinean president expressed the hope that 
Iranian-Guinean relations will expand through joint bilateral 
efforts. Conte added: The Guinean Government and nation attach 
great significance to cooperation with the Islamic Republic of 
Iran and announce their readiness to expand relations. 
  During his stay in Guinea, our foreign minister also met his 
Guinean counterpart and referred to the two major problems in 
the world of Islam--Palestine and Bosnia-Herzegovina--and stated 
that the only solution to these problems is through the unity of 
Islam. Velayati added: Iran and Guinea can adopt joint stances 
during the upcoming meetings of the Nonaligned Movement and of 
the Islamic Conference Organization to overcome Islam's 
problems. Velayati described Guinea as one of the major centers 
of Islam in Africa and stressed: Based on Islam, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran considers support for Muslims as one of its 
major duties. 
  Ibrahima Sylla, Guinea's minister of foreign affairs and 
cooperation, lauded the significant role that the Islamic 
Republic of Iran plays in the region and in the world of Islam 
and called for Iran's assistance to Guinea in the fields of 
fishing, railways, health, dam construction, energy, and 
technology. The Guinean minister said he was happy about the 
opening of Iranian trade fairs, which help toward meeting the 
needs of his country's people. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati arrived in 
Burkina Faso yesterday as part of his trip to six African 
countries and held talks with the local officials. Even though 
the visit to Burkina Faso by Velayati and the high-ranking 
political delegation accompanying him is the second phase of our 
foreign minister's tour that began on Tuesday, the delegation 
actually stopped in two countries before arriving in Burkina 
Faso. In addition to meeting and talking with officials of 
Guinea, the delegation stopped briefly at the airport in the 
Chadian capital, Ndjamena, on its way to Burkina Faso and talked 
with the Chadian foreign minister. 
  During the meeting between the Iranian and Chadian foreign 
ministers, Chad requested that the Islamic Republic of Iran 
assist in exploiting its oil resources as part of cooperation 
among countries of the South. This request is vitally important 
to Chad, especially after the discovery of an important oilfield 
in southern Chad. 
  In Guinea the Iranian delegation held detailed talks on 
economic, political, and cultural cooperation between Tehran and 
Conakry, including discussions on cooperation in the 
exploitation of bauxite mines, energy, the construction of 
hydro-electrical dams, and the construction of railways. 
  In Burkina Faso our foreign minister and his delegation met 
with the prime minister and discussed political and economic 
relations between the two countries. During this meeting, the 
initial basis for the expansion and consolidation of economic 
and commercial cooperation was laid, and with the formation of a 
joint commission in this field, a new era began in the economic 
cooperation between Tehran and Ouagadougou. To acquaint the 
government and nation of Burkina Faso with our country's high 
economic potential, it was decided that a trade exhibition 
including products and industries of Islamic Iran be set up in 
Ouagadougou. 
  Iran's diplomatic activities in Africa are of interest to 
political experts and analysts for various reasons. The first 
is that this diplomatic initiative by the Islamic Republic of 
Iran strengthens the position of Muslims in Africa, especially 
in Black Africa. The second is that this activity is 
significant to the expansion of South-South relations vis-a-vis 
the array of forces by the North against the South. The third 
is that meeting mutual needs in the economic, cultural, and 
political fields and helping deprived countries, especially with 
experts and know-how from the rich scientific and industrial 
experiences that our country has among the Third World, is an 
important objective in our country's diplomatic policy. 
  At any rate, Tehran's new look toward Africa has attracted 
the attention of many political experts.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the Hajj"] </F>
  [Text] The head of our country's Hajj and Pilgrimage 
Organization has asked Saudi Arabia to honor the Saudi-Iranian 
agreement on the number of Iranian pilgrims and the manner of 
performing the hajj ritual. Under the agreement Saudi Arabia 
consented to the dispatch of 110,000 Iranian pilgrims to that 
country and also to the performing of the Disavowal of Infidels 
ritual during the hajj period. Three years after the sending of 
Iranian pilgrims was halted, following the tragedy of the 
massacre at the holy shrine in 1369 [1990], the foreign 
ministers of Iran and Saudi Arabia signed an agreement which has 
been implemented over the past three years. [sentence as heard] 
  Now, within the framework of its commitments in its 
relations 
with Iran, Saudi Arabia is expected to provide the necessary 
facilities for the reception of Iranian pilgrims eager to visit 
the holy House of God. Since adherence to the Koranic and legal 
principle of honoring commitments is considered as a basis for 
international relations, its violation is considered a violation 
of international regulations and norms and would undoubtedly 
reduce Saudi Arabia's international credit. 
  Saudi Arabia's adherence to its commitments concerning its 
bilateral and multilateral relations notwithstanding, the Saudi 
rulers should be aware of their present position and of their 
sensitive responsibility for managing the two holy shrines. 
They should know that their main duty, if they value that 
management, is to help eligible Muslims to perform their 
religious duty of hajj. 
  Saudi Arabia's sudden, unconventional, and unethical 
decision 
to reduce the number of Iranian pilgrims by 50 percent, in 
addition to delaying hundreds of thousands of eager Iranian 
pilgrims in the performance of their hajj duty, would completely 
prevent about 177,000 septuagenarian Iranian pilgrims 
[accumulated backlog of elderly still waiting to undertake 
pilgrimage] from performing this divine duty. Undoubtedly, this 
is contrary to the Saudi rulers' religious and moral commitment 
to assist Muslims in the performance of their religious duty. 
Although the Saudi Government, by insisting on its criterion -- 
that is, accepting one pilgrim per thousand of the population of 
each country -- is trying to reduce Iran's quota, it is 
perfectly obvious that many countries are sending a much smaller 
number than their quota. Therefore, sending 110,000 or more 
Iranian pilgrims, as in previous years, would not have a 
fundamental effect on the management of the pilgrims' affairs. 
  Arabistan [Saudi Arabia] is insisting on reducing the quota 
of pilgrims agreed with Iran, while every year several countries 
send more than their set quota to the House of God. In this 
connection one can mention Egypt, which has a smaller population 
than Iran but exceeds the quota set by Arabistan by tens of 
thousands of pilgrims. 
  Such contradictory assertions and behavior by the Saudi 
rulers give rise to the thought that the Saudi Government has 
adopted a political attitude in relation to the hajj. This of 
course is not in harmony with that country's obligation to 
manage the affairs of the two holy shrines. Adopting a 
politically laden attitude toward people's religious obligations 
is a sensitive issue which can, furthermore, induce sensitivity. 
This attitude, moreover, cannot be justified or interpreted 
coherently within the framework of the two countries' friendly 
relations, which Iran has always tried to maintain. 
  It is appropriate that while there is still time the Saudi 
rulers should adopt a more careful stance toward the 
uncompromising behavior of some of their diplomats in connection 
with the issue of the hajj, and in particular toward the issue 
of pilgrimage by hundreds of thousands of Iranians, so that, as 
it did a few years ago, this political and Islamic ritual can 
take place in an appropriate and fitting fashion.

  [Text] Tehran, March, 29, IRNA -- The adoption by the 
government of Saudi Arabia of a position against the interests 
and profits of other member countries of the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has astounded petroleum 
exporters. 
  While the belief of oil experts and also the position of the 
other 11 OPEC members and the psychological atmosphere of the 
market was favourable for reduction of the production ceiling by 
1 to 1.4 million barrels per day, Riyadh disagreed with any 
reduction in the production of its oil. 
  On the basis of these views such a reduction by member 
states 
could cause the price of oil to increase by dlrs 3.00 to 4.00 
per barrel. 
  All witnesses and reasons indicate that the opposition of 
Saudi Arabia with other OPEC members and especially Islamic Iran 
as one of the countries that offered that proposal in the recent 
OPEC meeting was merely political and was adopted without taking 
into account the interests of other members. 
  Oil and economic experts emphasize on this point that the 
responsible officials in Saudi Arabia should not relate its 
dispute with Iran over the number of Mecca pilgrims to oil 
issues. 
  The recent decision-making by the Saudi Government in the 
area of oil issues has always created the suspicion that this 
country prefers Western interest to the interests of Muslim 
countries and other OPEC member states. 
  Although the OPEC secretariat had warned that if the 
production ceiling was not reduced within the next two months 
the oil price would fall several dollars from the present level. 
Nevertheless Saudi Arabia remained stubborn on its strange 
position without considering the realities. 
  Because Saudi Arabia is considered as the biggest oil 
producing country of the world it has suffered more loss than 
other countries due to the falling trend of the price of oil 
during this past year. The income of this country has been 
reduced at dlrs 2.5 billion for each dollar in the fall of oil 
price. 
  Iran's policies has indicated the reality that the Islamic 
republic has always considered the issue of understanding within 
OPEC, the stability of oil market and the interests of other 
members and as a result the interests of the Muslim world. 
  It should also be noted that for attaining these goals the 
Islamic republic has at time even overlooked its own interests. 
  Saudi Arabia, by supplying eight million bpd [barrels per 
day] of oil to the oil market has played an effective role in 
reducing the price of oil and the perpetuation of this 
unprincipled policy has always guaranteed the protection of the 
interests of the West and the wealthy consumers of oil. 
  'Abdallah Bin-Hamad al-Attiyah [name as received], energy 
minister of Qatar voiced his dissatisfaction in this regard in 
an interview with the state news agency of Qatar. 
  He emphasized the importance of the reduction in oil 
production of member countries with the view to improve the 
situation of the market. 
  According to OPEC secretary general of OPEC, Sobroto, 
Nigeria 
and Indonesia, too, offered separate proposals for reducing OPEC 
production at the level of 1 to 1.4 million bpd which also 
includes the reduction of the quota of Saudi Arabia. 
  The oil minister of Oman, too, wrote a letter to OPEC on 
behalf of eight non-OPEC countries saying these countries are 
ready to reduce the sum of their output by 250,000 bpd. 
  In the opinion of a political expert in the present 
situation 
that many of the oil producing countries which, under the 
influence of diferent factors including reduced oil prices, face 
economic stagnation, any decision which should create hindrances 
in the way of the determination of a just and reasonable oil 
price will be in fact a measure against the interests of 
developing nations and developing countries. 
  The same expert says Saudi Arabia, by creating a chaos in 
the 
adoption of a common decision in OPEC for reducing the volume of 
oil production has caused considerable loss to the oil producing 
countries and with respect to the warming temperature there is 
now the likelihood that the crisis caused by the reduction of 
oil prices will stretch its heavy shadow on the economy of many 
oil producing countries including Saudi Arabia. 
  He also believed that the opposition of the government of 
Saudi Arabia with the increase in oil prices is in fact some 
sort of antagonism and opposition with the Islamic Republic of 
Iran. 
  At any rate eonomic experts have a consensus of opinion in 
one issue which is that the position of Saudi Arabia did not aim 
at understanding, unity and solidarity of OPEC members and this 
decision-making has deeply astounded and at the same time 
angered producing countries. 
  It is said that in Geneva the officials of the Saudi 
Government in their direct talks with the Iranian sides admitted 
that their opposition to the increase in the oil price is a 
reply to the position of Iran in relation to the issue of hajj 
and reaction to the violation of Saudi Arabia of its previous 
commitments. 
  Such reports, in case they are true, more than anything else 
are indicative of the presence of political weakness, and there 
is the expectation that the officials of Saudi Arabia will look 
at issues with more realism and refuse to take a decision which 
inflicts the biggest loss to this country.

  [Text] During the recent session, OPEC petroleum ministers 
renewed the existing agreement among members on an oil 
production of 24.52 million barrels a day for another nine 
months. This decision was made at a time when not only the 
majority of OPEC members but the eight non-OPEC members had 
announced their willingness to reduce oil production. However, 
Saudi Arabia's disagreement on dropping production compelled 
OPEC to renew the agreement that was adopted six months ago on a 
daily production of 24.52 million barrels a day until the end of 
the current Christian calendar year. 
  Commenting on the renewal of OPEC's existing production 
ceiling, several petroleum ministers--the Qatari petroleum 
minister who also heads OPEC, the Libyan petroleum minister who 
is also a member of the three-man committee that studies 
possible violations by members, and the petroleum minister of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran--made separate statements 
criticizing Saudi Arabia. They also said that the decision was 
made to renew the production ceiling to avoid indecision. 
  Following Saudi Arabia's refusal to reduce its production, 
the OPEC secretary general and some members said that the 
renewal of the production ceiling was the only decision that 
members could practically and collectively agree on. 
  Our correspondent Hafezi has prepared the following report 
on 
the impact of this decision on oil prices and on our country's 
economy. 
  [Begin Hafezi recording] Following OPEC's recent decision, 
incoming reports from oil markets show that the continuation of 
oil production at the former production ceiling during a season 
when OPEC would have normally reduced production has led to an 
estimated $1 drop in oil prices in comparison with the period 
before the OPEC session. Meanwhile, a number of oil market 
analysts have noted that since the oil market foresaw a renewal 
of the agreement even before the current session, prices have 
sufficiently dropped and the official announcement will not 
reduce oil prices more than one more dollar during the next six 
months. 
  Meanwhile, OPEC members have agreed to maintain the former 
official production level even during the three months of autumn 
when oil demands increase. In this case, oil prices can be 
expected to strengthen during the three months of autumn. 
  As for the recent OPEC decision's impact on the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, domestic observers point out that since oil 
incomes in the 1373 budget law [year beginning 21 March 1994] 
were less than the estimates in the budget bill and are based on 
$13 per barrel, lesser foreign exchange expenditures have been 
foreseen for projects in that year. These observers have 
pointed out that determining two separate methods for foreign 
exchange expenditures, which are in ratio with oil prices, can 
help the government confront the drop in foreign exchange 
income. The observers add that it is ultimately an increase in 
domestic production and more use of domestic products that can 
help drop foreign exchange needs. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] In his meeting yesterday with Kuwaiti Amir 
Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah, our country's Roads and 
Transport Minister Akbar Torkan submitted to him a message from 
Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, president of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran. Although the content of the president's message has not 
been publicized, according to informed sources, the message was 
chiefly in connection with friendly ties and cooperation between 
Iran and Kuwait. 
  Our country's roads and transport minister, who started his 
three-day visit by meeting the amir of Kuwait, has also met the 
Kuwaiti prime minister and has conferred with him about the 
expansion of bilateral cooperation in economic and political 
spheres. 
  In this visit, Mr. Torkan will sign a maritime agreement 
between the two countries. The first shipping line between the 
two countries has been operating actively since February last 
year. The opening of an active shipping line between the two 
countries is in reality a new chapter in the process of 
consolidating economic and political bonds between the two 
Muslim and fraternal nations of Iran and Kuwait. In addition, 
the distinguished and unique geopolitical situation of Iran has 
made our country a major communications link between Muslim 
countries, in particular as Iran links Arab countries -- 
especially Persian Gulf littoral states -- to the newly 
independent Muslim countries of Central Asia. 
  The expansion of cordial and fraternal ties between Iran and 
Kuwait is taking place at a time when there are vigorous 
attempts by a number of Western countries and their allies in 
the region to mar Iran's relations with its southern neighbors. 
However, the present state of relations shows that despite the 
wish of the enemies and their extensive political and propaganda 
endeavours aimed at creating distance between Iran and its 
neighbors, the present realities in the region prove that there 
exist many profound bonds, as well as common interests and 
objectives, the attainment of which is dependent upon the 
expansion of cordial relations between historical neighbors in 
the region.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by political </F>
correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen at the Foreign Ministry in 
Jerusalem on 30 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres this evening 
commented on the negotiations with the Palestinians. He said 
that Israel was now seriously considering implementing an early 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip even before the negotiations were 
fully completed. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen 
interviewed the foreign minister a short while ago. 
  [Begin recording] [Peres] I think that both sides want to 
extricate themselves from this confusing situation and achieve 
results. The time is ripe for decisions and an interim period 
may only invite further trouble. 
  [Rosen] Sir, you are about to send armed Palestinian 
policemen and an multinational force into the powder keg that is 
Hebron. When will the government finally make the decision it 
is constantly discussing and inching toward to evacuate some of 
the Jewish settlers from Hebron? 
  [Peres] First of all, I would like to make things perfectly 
clear. The Jewish residents of Hebron are not in charge of the 
Cave of the Patriarchs. The Israeli Government, through the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces], is responsible for the Cave of 
Patriarchs and for guaranteeing freedom of access and worship at 
the site. As for Jewish settlers residing in Hebron, the 
government has to reach a decision. There is no point in 
ministers, including myself, making premature statements. The 
appropriate place for discussions is in the cabinet, not the 
media. Clearly, we are facing a very difficult problem. It is 
not a problem of rights but a problem of relations. 
  [Rosen] Is Israel ready to consider starting its withdrawal 
from the Gaza Strip even before the negotiations are completed 
in order to meet the target date of 13 April? 
  [Peres] I believe that any reasonable proposal will be 
examined on an individual basis. I do not want to make any 
generalizations, but the Palestinians are not the only ones who 
want to enter the Gaza Strip quickly. We also want to transfer 
authority to them quickly. There is no point in gaining another 
week or two of riots. We have no interest in this. All the 
violent confrontations which took place recently cause all of us 
pain, and we have no interest in seeing any further bloodshed, 
not of Arabs and certainly not of Jews. [end recording]

  [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is preparing to 
evacuate all forces from most parts of the Gaza Strip and their 
deployment to the Qatif Bloc settlements and the northern edge 
of the Strip. A Qol Yisra'el reporter says that IDF commanders 
in the Gaza Strip and Jericho say that once the order is given, 
they will be able to complete the redeployment within 72 hours. 
  Yesterday bulldozers began clearing land near the settlement 
of Vered Yeriho in order to set up a crossing point to and from 
the autonomous region of Jericho. An Army base and a police and 
border police post are also to be built near the crossing point. 
  The Defense Ministry is considering setting up a special 
body 
which will deal with coordination between the IDF and security 
forces and the Palestinians in the autonomous zones of the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho. Qol Yisra'el's military affairs 
correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that a senior Army officer 
will head the committee.

  [Text] Police Minister Moshe Shahal says there will be 
joint patrols between Palestinian police and the Israeli 
security forces in Hebron. In an interview with Amy Rhodes, 
Shahal said the move can be implemented immediately, and he 
hopes it will promote understanding between Israelis and the 
Palestinians. 
  [Begin recording] [Shahal] This was needed to give a 
feeling of security to the Palestinians living in Hebron after 
what happened on 25 February. The major issue, and the most 
important one is to have progress in the peace process. 
  [Rhodes] According to the compromise, there will be some 100 
Palestinian policemen in Hebron. How will it work? 
  [Shahal] Well, first of all, the Palestinian police who are 
members of this police force....[pauses] It's going to be a 
municipality police force. They are going to be responsible for 
the institutions of the Palestinians in Hebron, they are going 
to be responsible for the Palestinian inhabitants. They will 
have joint patrols together with Israeli security forces, 
including Israel Police officers. They will be entitled to have 
light arms -- the same that the Israel Police forces have, and 
those arms are going to be for self-defense of the police 
officers, and only when they are on duty. So, I think that it 
is very clearly defined what are the limitations, what is the 
jurisdiction. I hope it will promote understanding between the 
Israeli security forces and the future Palestinian police force. 
  [Rhodes] How soon until something like this can be 
implemented? 
  [Shahal] Immediately. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin today condemned those 
calling on IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers to disobey their 
commanders' legal orders. This could herald the destruction of 
the IDF and the undermining of Israel's security, Rabin said. 
The prime minister noted that he had never accepted any refusal 
by soldiers to carry out orders because of political 
differences, neither during the Lebanon war nor by refusing to 
serve in the territories. The prime minister said that the 
individual's duty to obey legal orders constituted the backbone 
of democracy and of the IDF, which was the army of the Israeli 
people. Yitzhaq Rabin was speaking during a briefing to 
military correspondents. His remarks were reported by Army 
affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe. 
  Israeli officials, from both sides of the political spectrum 
have expressed reservations with the ruling issued by the three 
rabbis calling on soldiers to disobey orders in Hebron. 
  Likud Knesset Member [MK] Ari'el Weinstein called on his 
party to express reservations with the halakic ruling. He told 
our correspondent Hayim Hecht that Israeli citizens could oppose 
the evacuation of the settlers within the confines of the law 
but soldiers must carry out any order which does not clearly 
violate the law. 
  Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan vehemently protested the halakic 
injunction. He said that the rabbis had no right to make 
rulings on IDF orders. Eytan said that the IDF and its 
commanders must comply with all authoritative orders issued by 
the political echelon, even if it did not correspond with their 
personal viewpoint. Refa'el Eytan told our correspondent 
Shmu'el Tal that he was sure that the political echelon would 
not issue IDF commands that would divide the Israeli people. 
  Labor Party Secretary Nisim Zvili said that the edict issued 
by the three rabbis proves that they have strayed from their 
spiritual path and are guilty of attempted insurrection. Such 
fanatical rabbis, Zvili said, who either lead or are led by the 
lunatic and dangerous fringes of society, may spark off a civil 
war. Zvili hoped that the national religious Zionist camp would 
eradicate all manifestations of messianic zealotry. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 30 March 
reports that "Zvulun Hammer, the leader of the National 
Religious Party, said that if responsible and loyal rabbis like 
Shapira, Yisre'eli, and Neriya issued such a harsh and dangerous 
halakic ruling which implies that soldiers should disobey 
orders, then this proves that the government and the Left have 
pushed the most moderate members of the religious camp up 
against the wall. Hammer suggested that Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin invite the rabbis to a meeting. MK Hammer told our 
correspondent Shmu'el Tal that the leadership of his party would 
meet with the three rabbis in order to hear exactly what they 
said and to be apprised of their position. Hammer also accused 
Minister Yosi Sarid of incitement and claimed that Sarid's 
reaction to the halakic edict would only cause more 
radicalization. Likud MK Mikha'el Eytan also blamed Minister 
Sarid for making slanderous remarks and fomenting divisiveness."]

  [Text] Environment Minister Yosi Sarid sharply attacked 
the halakic ruling issued by Rabbis Shapira, Yisre'eli, and 
Neriya, calling on IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers to 
disobey any orders to evacuate Jewish settlers from Hebron. 
Minister Sarid said that the three rabbis behind the injunction 
were irresponsible people who were toying with the fate of the 
IDF and threatening the very existence of the state. If each 
and every individual exhorted their supporters to refuse 
objectionable orders, it would mean the end of the IDF, which 
would rapidly disintegrate together with rest of the country. 
The State of Israel should be pitied for having such stupid, 
irresponsible, reckless and good-for-nothing rabbis, Sarid said. 
  Knesset Member [MK] Moshe Qatzav, the chairman of the Likud 
Knesset faction, called on the government not to put the 
soldiers' obligation to obey orders to the test in the context 
of evacuating Jews from Hebron. MK Qatzav told our 
correspondent that such action by the government could lead to 
chaos within the IDF.

<F P=106> ["Holiday" interview with Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi Yisra'el </F>
Me'ir Lau and Sephardic Chief Rabbi Eliyahu Baqshi-Doron by 
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Moving on to 
the political problems, what is the Chief Rabbinate's attitude 
toward ceding territory within the peace process? Jerusalem was 
in the headlines this week. What are the rabbis' enlightening 
views? 
  [Baqshi-Doron] I knew such a question would be asked. I 
think one of the nicest and most heroic things we did this past 
year was not to talk about the issue. As the saying goes, he 
who is prudent will keep silent in such a time, for it is an 
evil time. Keeping silent is not easy. However, we set 
ourselves a rule in our capacity as chief rabbis who feel the 
influence they have on the entire nation to keep silent on such 
a controversial issue. 
  [Correspondent] This silence is being interpreted as 
cowardice and gutlessness. 
  [Baqshi-Doron] God forbid. The moment we are called upon to 
make an halakic ruling on the issue -- and this will happen -- 
we will consult our eminences and give our opinion. Today I do 
not know whether the leaders know where they are headed. 
  [Correspondent] But the rabbis cannot sit idly by when the 
nation is so split. 
  [Baqshi-Doron] Not only the nation, but also the rabbis, are 
divided. Rabbis and religious Jews differ on political and 
halakic issues. We know that our opinion does not carry any 
weight at this point. Consequently, as long as this is not 
necessary, we do not want to make a ruling favoring one side, 
which would only exacerbate the conflict. 
  [Lau] The issue came up in a meeting of the Chief Rabbinate 
Council after the publication of the Oslo agreement. 
  The Chief Rabbinate in its current constellation abides by 
resolutions passed by its predecessors. The matter has been 
discussed in one way or another over the 27 years since the 
Six-Day War. Since we accept these resolutions based on the 
halakic ruling about "honoring the edicts of elders," we 
presented them to current council members. These resolutions 
are registered in the minutes of the council's sessions, which 
answers your question about our position on the issue. The 
Israeli people's right over Eretz Yisra'el is inalienable. So, 
I speak as an educator, a father, a rabbi, and a teacher -- not 
as a politician -- when I emphasize the verse: He has shown His 
people the power of His works, in giving them the heritage of 
the nations. This is the basis of the entire Bible, and there 
is no question about it. On the basis of this principle that we 
all abide by, a process is currently under way whose details we 
are not familiar with. We said that as rabbis we must be sure 
of one thing: that the right over Eretz Yisra'el is not 
impaired. Even if politicians and the military must decide in 
their peace talks that they must give self-rule in a certain 
place within a certain period of time, this should not undermine 
our right over Eretz Yisra'el. 
  We will not be dragged into any corner of the political 
arena. We uphold the basic right concerning the integrity of 
Eretz Yisra'el, the right of Jews to live in all parts of Eretz 
Yisra'el. As long as this right is assured and is not impaired, 
we will abide by the consensus. 
  [Correspondent] Could you be more specific about the 
evacuation of Jews from Hebron? 
  [Lau] We are opposed to the evacuation of Jews from Hebron. 
We must pray for them to be able to live there, but we are 
opposed to their evacuation. 
  [Baqshi-Doron] I am in principle opposed to an evacuation, 
but the duty to save Jewish lives legitimizes an evacuation.

moderate head injuries in a stoning incident in the vicinity of 
the village of al-Jib north of Jerusalem. He was transferred to 
the Hadassah-'En Kerem Hospital. Our correspondent Moti Amir 
reports that the soldier was driving near the village, which is 
under curfew, when his car came under a barrage of stones. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0800 GMT on 31 March 
adds the following: "Terrorists fired at an IDF outpost in the 
Jabalyah refugee camp this morning. None of the soldiers were 
hurt. The troops returned fire, gravely injuring one of the 
terrorists. The other gunman escaped, and Army troops mounted a 
manhunt for him. Our correspondent reports that one of the 
terrorists used an M-16 rifle and the other a Kalashnikov 
against the soldiers. Riots erupted in the refugee camp in the 
wake of the incident."] 
  Our correspondent notes that numerous Judaea and Samaria 
cities and villages remain under curfew today, including Nabulus 
and its environs; Tulkarm and the adjacent refugee camps; 
downtown Ramallah and the refugee camps near Ramallah; the 
al-Duhayshah refugee camp; and downtown Hebron. 
  Owners of gas stations in the territories complained today 
that the IDF has been prohibiting the supply of cooking gas and 
fuel to the Judaea and Samaria stations. A check conducted by 
our correspondent revealed that for security reasons, the IDF 
has been barring the entry of fuel and cooking gas trucks into 
the area for over two weeks, and the local population's fuel and 
cooking gas supplies are running out.

  [Text] Five members of the Kakh organization, settlers from 
the territories who are under administrative detention, have 
asked the prime minister to deport them to south Lebanon, an 
area they consider the birthright of the tribe of Asher, one of 
the 12 biblical tribes of Israel. 
  Our army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David reports that 
the five men claim that their appeal was neither a media gimmick 
or a joke. They assert that their deportation to south Lebanon 
would satisfy the prime minister's craving to be rid of them and 
also get them out of jail. The five said that in south Lebanon 
they could contribute to the conquest of Eretz Yisra'el and the 
war against terrorism while realizing their Jewish and Zionist 
aspirations.

<F P=106> [Report by security affairs correspondent Sharon Shade] </F>
  [Excerpts] Israeli sources express concern in view of the 
growing tension between black factions in South Africa in 
anticipation of the elections in April. The sources refused to 
react to foreign reports according to which missile scientists 
have threatened to reveal details of nonconventional weapons 
cooperation between Israel and South Africa. They also refused 
to comment on the possible ramifications of the new situation on 
bilateral cooperation. According to the sources, due to 
political reasons bilateral security cooperation has been 
extremely curtailed over the last few years, and this 
cooperation will be affected by future internal changes in South 
Africa. 
  In the past Israel maintained tight military and security 
cooperation with the white regime of South Africa, including -- 
according to foreign reports -- the development and manufacture 
of weapons to the tune of billions of dollars, as well as 
nuclear cooperation, including trade in sensitive raw materials. 
[passage omitted] 
  Israeli sources expect changes to take place in South 
Africa's security concept in the wake of the political changes 
there. It is possible that the South Africans will reevaluate 
various military projects. The Israeli sources believe that 
South Africa will strive to become a regional power and a 
leading African force by increasing its military power. This 
will require a rebuilding process in many parts of the Army, 
while introducing new battle doctrines to accommodate the new 
black recruits. The sources assess that the South African 
Army's ground forces will absorb many new black recruits. A 
long time will be required, however, to absorb them in the air 
force due to the complicated systems, which require long 
training periods for pilots, as well as technical and 
engineering personnel. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ron Ben-Yishay: "Let Fatah Establish an </F>
Inquiry Commission"] 
  [Text] It would be appropriate for the Fatah leadership to 
establish an inquiry commission into the killing of six senior 
Fatah activists in the Gaza Strip two days ago. 
  The mandate of such a commission -- were it established -- 
would be to determine why the six acted in direct contravention 
to the explicit understandings and agreements between Fatah and 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], in such a way as to endanger 
their own lives and those of passersby. Such a commission would 
also ascertain who in the Fatah leadership knew about their 
activity or approved it, and punish those responsible. 
  Instead of doing this, however, the PLO leadership prefers 
-- 
as always -- to blame the IDF. And in the spirit of those who 
see a conspiracy behind every corner, there are people who 
disseminate in Israeli and foreign media that the undercover 
unit's attack on the six was initiated by a group of Israeli 
officers who want to foil the Oslo agreement. 
  However, the facts -- which even Fatah people in the Gaza 
Strip do not deny -- all indicate that the tragic mistake should 
be entirely attributed to the Fatah members. On Monday 
afternoon the six activists -- after proper coordination with 
the IDF -- participated in a memorial service for a Fatah 
activist in the al- Shaykh Radwan neighborhood, which is located 
only several kilometers from the site of the incident. The six 
were armed and wore checkered uniforms (apparently with tacit 
IDF agreement). 
  However, they did not settle for this. Following the 
ceremony -- and without any prior coordination -- they set up a 
roadblock on a main road of the Jabalyah refugee camp, stopped 
cars with drawn weapons (Kalashnikovs and pistols), and 
distributed leaflets. 
  It was dark, the Fatah men were masked, and wore no signs to 
indicate their affiliation -- in clear contravention to the 
agreements between the Fatah leadership and the IDF in the Gaza 
Strip. 
  The undercover soldiers who spotted them assumed -- and 
rightly so, from their point of view -- that the six were 
terrorists, and went on to attack them. It should be noted that 
a short time prior to that incident an attempt was made to 
attack the IDF outpost in Jabalyah, and that the IDF is still 
responsible for maintaining security in the Gaza Strip. Fatah 
is also aware of the fact that undercover units are operating in 
the Gaza Strip and should have foreseen what would happen. 
  It is also inconceivable that 'Arafat's PLO would delay the 
negotiations on transferring responsibility for security to the 
PLO while at the same time its people on the ground are acting 
as though the negotiations have been completed and they no 
longer need to coordinate their moves with the IDF before 
departing on an armed mission. 
  The IDF, however, should also draw the appropriate 
conclusions. The Jabalyah incident ought to serve as a warning 
sign as to what could happen after a Palestinian police force 
deploys in Hebron, the Gaza Strip, and Jericho. It should be 
feared that the security cooperation agreements of the kind the 
delegations are currently striving to attain would "invite" such 
incidents. 
  The more complicated and intricate the security and 
coordination arrangements are, the greater the potential for 
fatal mistakes on both sides. And as is well known, mistakes 
cause escalation in violence and friction even between 
well-meaning Palestinians and Israelis. 
  The only way to avoid this situation is to clearly demarcate 
the borders of the sectors in which the Palestinian police force 
on the one hand, and the IDF on the other, will operate. 
  The joint patrols in the sectors slated to be jointly held 
will be an inexhaustible source for mistakes and 
misunderstandings -- and consequently must be avoided. It is 
inadvisable to rely on coordination, especially with an 
inexperienced force -- which is exactly what the Palestinian 
police force will be at first.

<F P=106> [Commentary by 'Aqiva Eldar: "The Fourth Side"] </F>
  [Text] A visitor from the moon stumbling upon the latest 
issue of the FOREIGN AFFAIRS magazine might think the Middle 
East is a major inducer of insomnia among Washington 
decisionmakers. 
  Writing in the magazine, National Security Adviser Anthony 
Lake says that ever since the end of the Cold War, the only 
superpower has been apprehensive about the potential damage from 
five countries which choose to remain outside the international 
community and to assail its basic values. Three of these -- 
Iran, Iraq, and Libya -- grace the Middle East with their 
presence. (The other two are Cuba and North Korea.) 
  Lake's article focuses on the advantages of the U.S. 
strategy 
vis-a-vis the Iraqi and Iranian threats, known as "dual 
containment." Lake illuminates Israel's role in the era of 
peace as assigned by the United States. The strategic 
cooperation has lost the Soviet enemy, but Israel shall not 
stand alone. According to Lake, Israel, along with the other 
U.S. allies in the region -- Egypt, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia -- 
permit the United States to simultaneously contain the Iranians 
and the Iraqis. Thanks to Israel and the other U.S. friends in 
the region, the United States can afford to forgo the dubious 
satisfaction of cooperating with the devil against a greater 
devil. 
  By the way, the same magazine carries an article by Prof. 
Gregory Gause from the Columbia University, who presents the 
theory of those who doubt the logic of dual containment. He 
suggests seeking channels to Tehran while intensifying the 
pressure on the peace process participants, in order to foil the 
Tehran efforts to torpedo the process. 
  The timing of the publication of the National Security 
Council official's contemplations can hardly be accidental. The 
weight of his observations differs from that of the lecture on 
the dual containment policy delivered by his assistant, Martin 
Indyk, in May 1993. Lake insinuates the peace process dimension 
into the depth of strategic analysis: Peace between Israel and 
its neighbors, the senior adviser opines, will deprive Iraq of 
occasions to exploit the Palestinian suffering and divest Iran 
of the capability to cultivate chaos in Lebanon. Lakes is 
careful -- possibly fearing Israeli reaction -- not to include 
Syria in his vision of the Middle East coalition, although his 
remarks plainly reveal that his desire to move Syria away from 
Iran is as great as his aspiration to draw it close to Israel. 
  The United States will have to convince the Arab countries 
-- 
the moderates and those on their way to becoming moderate -- 
that the quadruple coalition will not threaten them or offer 
them formulas that will tempt them to cooperate, in exchange for 
overt and active support for the peace process; at the same 
time, President Clinton will have to pledge assistance to Israel 
toward reducing risks inherent in a compromise with the Arabs. 
  All this offers Israel an opportunity -- perhaps unique -- 
to 
take advantage of its special relationship with an 
administration which waives a priori the option of playing the 
game with two elements hostile to Israel and which mobilizes all 
its strength and influence for the sake of uniformly 
neutralizing all those who reject conciliation with Israel. 
  Since the end of the Cold War, Israel and its friends in the 
United States have been searching for a new footing on which the 
strategic cooperation -- the source of many important advantages 
in the sphere of defense and public relations -- can be 
established. Israel's becoming a frontline deterrent base 
against Iran and Iraq, and if necessary, a base for military 
action against them, requires a revaluation of the "dual 
containment" approach. If the Americans manage to create a 
Middle East NATO after the conflict between Israel and its 
neighbors is resolved, a new Middle East balance of power will 
have to be established. The new alliance will justify a 
generous supply of state-of-the-art technologies, weapons, and 
intelligence to Israel to ensure its deterrence vis-a-vis Syria. 
  Along with the above, we can expect the U.S. Navy to deploy 
a 
floating power off the Middle East shores and to create new jobs 
in Israel for the benefit of the U.S. troops and equipment. 
This handsome package, along with the blessing inherent in the 
termination of the war with Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon, must be 
weighed against the advantages stemming from retaining control 
over the Golan Heights. 
  The introduction of the peace process in the context of dual 
containment demands that the U.S. President pull out of the 
narrow labyrinth of the desire to gratify Israel -- in fact, the 
Jewish constituency -- at almost any cost. If U.S. weakness 
contributes to the failure of the peace process, the writings of 
the most senior national security adviser will become a national 
indictment against Clinton.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Pinhas 'Inbari: "An Open Declaration or a </F>
Secret Commitment"] 
  [Excerpt] Although the talks between Israel and the PLO on 
defense for the Palestinians attracted the most attention this 
past week, one should also take note of the contacts which the 
U.S. peace coordinator, Dennis Ross, conducted in Damascus 
rather than in Tunis. Washington is considering the chances of 
bringing about a breakthrough on the Palestinian track, but real 
achievements in the near future are possible only in the talks 
with Syria. 
  This week I met with some of the members of the Israeli 
Arabs 
delegation, led by Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, who 
had just returned from a visit to Syria. By the testimony of 
the delegation members, Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' 
specified Damascus' position on the way in which a breakthrough 
in the negotiations with Israel can be achieved. 
  Al-Shar' said that Syria adheres to the formula of full 
peace 
in return for a full withdrawal from the Golan, but is prepared 
to discuss with Israel all the conditions the latter will 
present on the road to implementing the formula, so as to 
reassure it on security issues. At the same time, Syria refuses 
to specify the components of peace now since it does not trust 
that Israel indeed wants true peace. 
  Syria is offering Israel two options for the acceptance of 
the formula. The first option is an open, official declaration 
by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin that Israel is willing to 
withdraw from the Golan in return for full peace. If Rabin 
openly declares the acceptance of the Syrian proposal, the road 
will be open to a historic summit between al-Asad and Rabin. 
  The second option, in case Rabin prefers not to declare 
Israel's readiness for a withdrawal openly, is for a secret 
Israeli commitment to be relayed to the Syrians. Itamar 
Rabinovich, the head of the Israeli delegation to the talks, can 
convey such a commitment to his Syrian counterpart, Muwaffaq 
al-'Allaf, together with Israel's position on the security 
arrangements. A secret commitment to withdraw from the Golan in 
return for full peace will complete the formulation of the joint 
Israeli-Syrian declaration of principles and will embark on the 
talks between the two countries on the road leading to peace. 
  What interest does Syria have in establishing peace with 
Israel? The members of the Israeli delegation to the 
negotiations got the impression that Syria's economic situation 
is reasonable. Furthermore, Syria emerged from the economic 
crisis which had plagued it, and its citizens currently enjoy 
economic prosperity. In theory then, Syria's condition is good 
and it has no reason to want a change. This is also the message 
the Syrians tried to relay to the members of the Darawshah 
delegation: "We are in no rush; we are waiting patiently." 
  The Syrians indeed have a feeling of self-confidence which 
enables them to pose maximal opening demands. At the same time, 
the decision by the Syrian leadership to prefer economic 
development obliges it, of necessity, to turn to a road of peace 
and to help the Israeli Government to promote a new Middle East 
based on econmy. The suspicious Syrians show great hostility 
toward the ideas of a new Middle East presented by Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres, claiming that Israel intends to take 
over the region economically. Still, when the two countries 
agree on the framework of bilateral peace and Syria joins the 
multilateral talks, many of its fears on this issue will surely 
dissipate. Syria boycotts the multilateral talks which discuss 
regional cooperation indeed, but it is still following, via 
France, all those details raised in the talks which concern it, 
such as the regional roads network in which Damascus is supposed 
to feature prominently. 
  It is clearly understood in Syria that if the Israeli 
Government does not make real progress in the peace talks this 
year, then a right-wing government which may emerge from the 
ruins of the present process will bring the war tension back and 
this will result in new economic deterioration in Syria. The 
Syrians are also troubled by Israel's nuclear capability, and 
want to take advantage of the peace talks in order to safeguard 
themselves from this aspect of Israel's power. 
  Syria's name has so far been linked with radical forces in 
the Middle East. Nevertheless, following its policy in Lebanon 
may point to new trends which can also influence its policy 
toward Israel and its position on the Palestinian question. The 
invitation extended to Darawshah's delegation too indicates that 
Syria is shifting the emphasis to those who represent the 
moderate mainstream. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The prime minister has expressed the hope that 
enhanced cooperation between India and the United States will 
continue despite sharp differences in some areas of national 
importance. In an interview published in the latest issue of 
INDIA NEWS, Mr. Narasimha Rao described Indo-U.S. relations as 
multifaceted, complex, and replete with challenges and 
opportunities. He said U.S. is India's largest trading partner 
as well as the largest source of foreign direct investment. 
  Referring to China, Mr. Rao said there has been steady 
improvement in Sino-Indian relations over the last few years. 
The uptrend in ties has facilitated attempts to resolve the 
difficult boundary question between the two countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Abu-Salih by </F>
Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] [Abu-Husayn] First of all, who, in your view, is 
responsible for the eruption of Egyptian-Sudanese differences, 
especially after the start of the dialogue between the two sides? 
  [Abu-Salih] Sudan has done nothing wrong against Egypt and 
it will not sacrifice its relations with Egypt, which should be 
special. I have come to Egypt six times to tackle the Hala'ib 
triangle dispute. The second round should have been held in 
Khartoum. It was postponed several times by the Egyptian side. 
More than once we appealed to [Egyptian Foreign] Minister 'Amr 
Musa to make the visit urgently so that we could carry out the 
task entrusted to us by Presidents Husni Mubarak and 'Umar 
al-Bashir at the time of the African summit in Cairo last 
summer. I believe that dialogue and meetings are essential for 
the settlement of the Hala'ib dispute, which, we believe, is a 
constant source of provocation and tension between the two 
countries. As far as we are concerned, postponement of the 
dialogue is unacceptable because it means continuation of the 
present situation. 
  [Abu-Husayn] But Minister 'Amr Musa said more than once that 
the reason for the postponement was the fact that he was too 
busy at home and abroad. 
  [Abu-Salih] I believe that Cairo and Khartoum are no more 
than two hours apart. Is it conceivable that visits to 
countries other than Sudan are more important than the current 
tense situation between the two countries? We insist on urgent 
dialogue because relations should not remain as they are for a 
long time. We believe that the present Egyptian Government is 
stronger than previous governments and more serious about 
establishing good relations between the Egyptian and Sudanese 
peoples. To us, that is a strategic objective and neither of us 
should lose sight of it. 
  We will never forget Egypt's support for us on the question 
of Sudan's territorial integrity and against partition of Sudan, 
but we want to cooperate and coordinate and we want to move 
forward and settle any dispute which might undermine the 
situation in Sudan. We see the Hala'ib problem as much too small 
a problem to be a major obstacle in the way of special relations 
between the two countries. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Has a date been set for Minister 'Amr Musa to 
visit Khartoum? 
  [Abu-Salih] Regrettably, no date has been set yet. I have 
talked to him about everything I have said regarding ties 
between the two countries, their importance, the need to end 
this abnormal situation, and the need to move on to a better 
situation in the interest of both countries, particularly as 
there is much talk these days about Arab solidarity. The 
question is how is that to be achieved. There are differences 
between one state and its neighbor. That is unacceptable in a 
world which does not respect small entities. There must be 
cohesion and solidarity for the present and the future. 
  [Abu-Husayn] But how is that going to apply to your 
relations with Egypt after the Sudanese president's appointment 
of a governor for the Hala'ib triangle? 
  [Abu-Salih] If we just looked at what both the Egyptian and 
Sudanese sides are doing in Hala'ib, the problem would never be 
solved because it is disputed territory and, in the present 
situation, each side can do what it likes. That is why the 
dispute must be settled. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Pardon me, but Egypt emphasizes that Hala'ib 
is Egyptian and Sudan says it would never forfeit it. So, how 
is the dialogue to be resumed? 
  [Abu-Salih] Dialogue is the only way of creating a positive 
atmosphere. We would never forfeit the Hala'ib triangle by 
force or through the imposition of a fait accompli. We could 
possibly give it to Egypt through cordial means and provided we 
agree and the dialogue begins on the basis of mediation, 
international arbitration, or any sensible solution agreed upon 
by the two sides. 
  [Abu-Husayn] It seems that Sudan's declaration that Hala'ib 
is Sudanese was sufficient reason for Egypt to lose interest in 
dialogue. 
  [Abu-Salih] And Egypt's creation of electoral constituencies 
is also unacceptable to us. We had previously agreed to stop 
such practices. That Egyptian measure actually was sufficient 
proof that Hala'ib is Sudanese. Why were these constituencies 
not created in Hala'ib dozens of years ago? Why now? That is 
the question. We do not wish to discuss that in the media. We 
must arrive at practical solutions through dialogue. With 
goodwill, the dispute can be settled. 
  [Abu-Husayn] What do you think of the Sudanese media claim 
that President Mubarak secretly visited Nairobi and met with 
John Garang? 
  [Abu-Salih] That is ridiculous. I do not believe that 
President Mubarak did such a thing. No one in the Sudanese 
Government has accused or would ever accuse him of doing that. 
That was just a report which confused the Egyptian press. The 
Sudanese press reported that Mubarak al-Fadil, not President 
Mubarak, met with Garang. So, we should not pay any attention 
to such reports. The Sudanese media are tired of me going after 
them for the reports they publish because I always investigate 
any incident which might be harmful to our relations with any 
state. You now have the correction to the report carried by the 
Sudanese media. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Have you requested Arab League intervention in 
the war in southern Sudan? 
  [Abu-Salih] Sudan has submitted a memorandum, not seeking 
mediation or intervention but informing the Arab League of what 
is going on in southern Sudan and of the attempts to partition 
Sudan and undermine its territorial integrity, particularly as 
the Arab League has for over a year been contemplating calling 
for pan-Arab security integration. We consider Sudan to be part 
of that security. We emphasize that we will never allow the 
rebels and gunmen to fulfill their demands and 
self-determination because that constitutes an open call for the 
partition of Sudan, which is impossible. The Sudanese Army 
would never allow that. The Army is doing its duty against the 
rebels to promote stability and is giving them the punishment 
they deserve. Despite that, we have offered dialogue and 
negotiations to arrive at a comprehensive and just peaceful 
solution that would end the war, which is hurting everyone. The 
negotiations began on 17 March. The next round will be in May. 
The aim is to solve the problem on the basis of the Sudanese 
Government's program on the distribution of power and 
development but within the framework of a united Sudan, with 
exemption from application of the Islamic Shar'iah.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yusuf Bin-'Abdallah Bin-'Alawi, Omani </F>
minister of state for foreign affairs, by unidentified 
correspondent in Cairo; date not given -- recorded passages in 
Arabic processed from Hebrew subtitles] 
  [Text] This evening for the first time ever, an Israeli 
delegation left for Oman in the Persian Gulf. The delegation is 
headed by Shlomo Gur, political adviser to the deputy foreign 
minister. He is accompanied by the technical team which 
prepares for Israel's participation in the multinational 
conference on water issues. 
  In an exclusive interview with MABAT, Yusuf Bin-'Alawi, 
Oman's minister of state for foreign affairs, said in Cairo that 
there is nothing wrong with inviting Israeli representatives to 
his country: 
  [Begin recording] [Bin-'Alawi] Israel has been attending all 
the multinational talks, whether they were held in Arab 
countries or in non-Arab countries. That is why one cannot give 
up on Israel's participation in such a conference. Israel's 
presence at the water conference does not affect the importance 
of the goal which, we hope, would serve the best interests of 
the Arab nation. 
  [Correspondent] What do you think about solving the 
Palestinian and Syrian water problem with countries such as 
Turkey and Israel? 
  [Bin-'Alawi] The issue must be studied and discussed by all 
the countries who will enjoy the arrangement, and those in which 
territory the water sources are, where the rivers run. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with former Prime Minister General Michel 'Awn by </F>
Shukri Nasrallah in Paris; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Nasrallah] Are you still opposed to the 
pope's visit to Lebanon? 
  ['Awn] I have not said that I am against the visit. I just 
expressed some political reservations about the visit because I 
consider Lebanon to be an occupied territory. Therefore, the 
sight of the pope shaking hands with the current regime's 
officials would greatly shock the Lebanese at the national 
level. [passage omitted] 
  [Nasrallah] What is your political peace plan for Lebanon? 
  ['Awn] My plan is well known. There should first be a 
dialogue between me and those who are against me. I was the one 
who started the march. I refuse to have my country marginalized 
in the peace negotiations. Lebanon should be present as a major 
party at the negotiating table. There should be tripartite 
negotiations attended by Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. 
  I am willing to sign an agreement with any Lebanese Muslim 
to 
work together for the freedom and salvation of Lebanon. I am 
confident that I can bring the Christians to the dialogue table, 
and also the Muslims. I believe that I truly represent the 
Muslims just as I truly and freely represent the Christians. 
  That is my offer. I hope that nobody would claim to 
represent the Christians and Muslims more than I do. I have not 
rejected anyone. All I call for is equal rights for all the 
Lebanese in a dear, free, and independent Lebanon. 
  [Nasrallah] Tell us about the agreement reached between you 
and the government under which you signed a document indicating 
that you would not indulge in political acitivity in France. 
  ['Awn] Let whoever holds such a document produce it. 
  [Nasrallah] The government says that it has something to 
that effect. 
  ['Awn] I have nothing at all to do with the Lebanese 
Government. I neither negotiated with the Lebanese Government 
nor promised it anything directly, indirectly, or through 
mediators. I rejected that government and still do. So how 
could I negotiate with a government I do not recognize? 
  I had been kidnapped. I was a hostage inside the French 
Embassy. Even if their claim that I did sign something were 
true, it would be invalid under the law because I was not 
completely free to accept or sign anything. The situation is 
now as follows: I do nothing that contravenes French law, 
because I am a guest in France. I will do anything permissible 
under French law, regardless of whether or not I signed anything 
to the contrary. 
  [Nasrallah] I have heard you talk about funds seized by the 
Lebanese Government. What are these funds? 
  ['Awn] There are funds in my name that did not come from the 
government or from donations. These were funds in the bank 
under my name and the names of my wife and daughters. The 
government froze these funds unfairly. 
  Furthermore, I was an army commander. I served Lebanon for 
35 years. The government has ignored my material rights 
arbitrarily through a law that violated all laws. 
  Also, do not forget that I was prime minister and I have 
material rights and am entitled to compensation as army 
commander, and am also entitled to aides and a monthly salary 
and compensations. The government has rejected all that. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Nasrallah] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri says that nobody 
has claimed Gen. 'Awn's rights from him and that if that 
happened he would look into it. 
  ['Awn] At any rate, my problem is not with them. I have not 
recognized them and I still do not recognize them. Even if they 
put me in the dock on any particular charge, I would not defend 
myself before them. [passage omitted] 
  [Nasrallah] Permit me to go to the heart of the matter. You 
tend to accuse Syria of everything. Is that right? 
  ['Awn] Let me be frank. Am I an enemy of the Syrian regime? 
Have I betrayed it to Israel? Have I plotted against it? Have 
I taken political regional or international stands against its 
position or in a way detrimental to it? I only defended 
Lebanon. I never opposed special relations between Syria and 
Lebanon. I have said and I continue to say that I extend my 
hand to the sincere hands in Syria so that we can be two 
fraternal countries in the full sense of the word, with each one 
free, independent, and its own master. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Leaders of the G-15 developing nations meeting in 
the Indian capital, New Delhi, have called for a restructuring 
of the United Nations in a way that it will take account of 
significant changes that have taken place since 1945. In a 
draft joint communique, which is to be approved by the summit 
today, the leaders are also suggesting that the restructuring 
should rest on the principle of democratization and transparency 
in decision-making at the UN and all its agencies. The General 
Assembly, according to the communique, should be revitalized, a 
suitable formula that would ensure appropriate interaction 
between the Security Council and the General Assembly designed. 
  The G-15 leaders are also calling for an expansion of its 
membership. According to a Voice of Nigeria correspondent in 
New Delhi, the draft communique is taking note of the current 
world trade agreement and is expressing the hope that 
liberalization, increased market access and expansion of world 
trade would materialize. The draft communique is further 
calling for a monitoring mechanism to ensure that during the 
implementation of the GATT agreement the interest of developing 
countries is adequately protected.

  [Text] The G-15 summit in New Delhi has taken a number of 
new initiatives to strengthen South-South cooperation. A 
committee is to be set up to work out trans-regional 
arrangements for promotion of trade finances and transfer of 
technology among member nations. The private sector and G-15 
business forum will be closely associated with this. At the end 
of the summit yesterday, the leaders also directed that viable 
projects of cooperation should be implemented with more vigor. 
The foreign ministers of India, Argentina and Zimbabwe, who 
will now form the troika or the steering committee of the group, 
have been asked review the projects and examine their source of 
financing. India offered to share its technology in harnessing 
wind energy with other member nations. 
  AIR [All India Radio] correspondent reports that the heads 
of 
government and state expressed concern over attempts by 
developed countries to bring in new issues like labor standards 
in the talks on the GATT deal. This, they said, will adversely 
affect the export of developing nations. 
  The summit decided that the G-15 ministers will meet in the 
next two weeks before the authentication of the new GATT deal at 
Marrakech in Morocco to take coordinated action aginst such 
move. The joint communique issued after the summit called for 
setting up a monitoring mechanism to protect the interest of the 
developing countries during the implementation of new GATT 
accord. Official sources in New Delhi said the leaders also 
decided to maintain the practice of holding the G-15 summit 
annually, but with a flexible quorum.

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 17 March 
issue of Cairo AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH summarizes articles that 
are Islamic in nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Call to Revive Islamic rule 
  2. Secularism Versus Islam 
  3. Antinormalization Committee 
  4. Roots of Jewish Thought Examined 
  5. Anti-Sudan British Conspiracy 
<H5>  CALL TO REVIVE ISLAMIC RULE </H5>
  The 17 March issue of AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH devotes much of 
its space to the struggle between secular and Islamic currents. 
  A 5,000-word report by Hani al-Makkawi on page 3 speaks of 
the ills wrought by "morbid secularism". The article, which 
bears the headline: "What Has the World Gained by Drawing Away 
From Islam? ... Destruction, Corruption, Humiliation, and the 
Nations' Inability To Feed Themselves", addresses the following 
question to a large number of Islamic figures and academics: 
"What have the Muslims lost or gained by adopting secular 
methods in various spheres?" 
  Among the answers cited is one by Dr. Fawzi Ta'il, who lists 
the ills resulting from the abandonment of Islam, including the 
spread of AIDS, illegal drugs, weakened family ties, 
unemployment, spiritual emptiness, the specter of trade wars, 
and "moral catastrophes in the scientific field such as organ 
transplants; genetic engineering; artificial insemination; the 
right to end one's life, which they call suicide; and the right 
to get rid of a fetus, which they call abortion." 
  Noting that "60 percent of the world's population are 
idolaters", Ta'il asks: "If the West casts off its hostility to 
Islam, it will benefit from this great message that brings 
guidance to the people of the Earth." 
  Dr. Salim Najm, chairman of the Egyptian Relief Committee 
and 
deputy president of the Physicians Association, comments on the 
Islamic countries "disgraceful" attitude on the issues of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, and Kashmir, which, he says, would 
be different if Islam ruled the world. 
  Islamic preacher Tal'at al-Shinnawi, from al-Daqahliyah 
Governorate, says that the Islamic world's abandonment of 
shari'ah has led to autocratic rule and produced a strong Israel. 
  Dr. Jamal 'Abd-al-Hadi, a professor of Islamic history, says 
that as a result of its alienation from its religion, the 
Islamic world suffered "an obliteration of Islamic identity 
following the collapse of the Caliphate [Ottoman Empire] and an 
intellectual invasion via foreign educational curricula and 
media, non-Islamic values, and foreign economic domination, 
particularly after the Gulf war." 
  'Abd-al-Hadi continues that alienation from Islam also 
caused 
the loss of Jerusalem, the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque, the chaste 
land of Palestine, and al-Andalus [Spain]. 
  Dr. Mahmud Himayah, professor of comparative religion and 
head of Asyut University's Islamic Studies Department, 
criticizes "imported constitutions and laws," which fail to 
punish "immorality and corruption of the faith." He attacks 
secular writers who ridicule Islamic teachings and symbols. He 
extols such figures as Shaykh [Muhammad] al-Ghazali, Shaykh 
[Muhammad Mutawalli] al-Sha'rawi, and the Grand Imam of al-Azhar. 
  Himayah continues: "It is strange that when al-Azhar uses 
its natural right to confiscate the garbage of human thought 
[zibalat al-fikr al-bashari], the secularists and communists 
raise a brouhaha about freedom of belief and thought. It 
appears as if freedom of thought among these people means to 
attack sanctities and ridicule Islam." 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Sattar al-Miliji, a professor at Suez Canal 
University and secretary general of the Scientific Professions 
Association, says that by drawing away from Islam, the Islamic 
world lost its respect. He adds: "We have become the world's 
plaything. Muslim blood has become the cheapest blood. The 
era's major tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina is two years old now 
but the Islamic world remains complacent and unconcerned. The 
European-U.S. West is fighting them by giving political, media, 
and diplomatic backing to their enemy. Russia and Greece are 
supplying the aggressors with soldiers and hardware. The 
international organizations, in the absence of Islam, are even 
worse." 
  Dr. 'Abdallah Hilal, a nuclear energy professor, contrasts 
Israel's early acquisition of nuclear power with the Islamic 
world's lack of success in this sphere, which he blames on 
inter-Arab differences and foreign intervention. Commenting on 
Egypt's plans in this field, he says: "When the Egyptian 
Nuclear Energy Authority was established to boost the economy by 
producing electricity and desalinating sea water, it had great 
success in its first years. It brought good repute to Egypt and 
other Arab and Islamic countries. Its cadres of trainees began 
to carry this knowledge to Arab, Islamic, and African states. 
Nuclear power plants were supposed to be built and feasibility 
studies began for eight such stations. However, Zionist-U.S. 
conspiracies did not allow the project to be completed. As a 
result of Egypt's links with the U.S., there were no Egyptian 
secrets. They let us make studies and plans, offer tenders, and 
spend much money and efforts only to interfere at the last 
moment to wreck our plans by using the weapons of aid, the IMF, 
and the World Bank. In addition, we were given frank 
instructions to abandon the project. As a result our trained 
cadres emigrated." 
  Shaykh al-Ghazali says that after the collapse of the 
caliphate, the Islamic world's enemies multiplied and communists 
and secularists became stronger. He remarks that alienation 
from Islam has rendered the Muslims very weak and notes that if 
the Islamic nation realizes what its role should be and returns 
to its God and shari'ah, it will be "qualified to lead the 
world." 

<H5>    SECULARISM VERSUS ISLAM </H5>
  Under the headline "The Atheistic-Secularist Onslaught on 
Islam: Its Causes and Motives," Dr. Ahmad al-Majdub, in a 
2,000-word column on page 2, brands Egyptian communists as 
selfish and superficial opportunists who, having lost their 
erstwhile Soviet master, are now attacking Islam and Muslims in 
order to demonstrate their credentials to the "rich new U.S. 
master." He notes that some of them are afraid of "transferring 
their loyalty directly to the West" in order not to expose their 
true opportunist nature. The column also defends Arab Muslims 
who helped the Afghans against the Soviet invaders, noting that 
most of them are not terrorists or extremists. 
<H5>  ANTINORMALIZATION COMMITTEE </H5>
  A brief report by Hani al-Makkawi on page one discusses a 
conference organized by the Cairo University Faculty Club, which 
issued a statement announcing its determination to form a 
"committee for boycotting normalization with the Zionist enemy 
in all spheres of life." The conference appealed to every 
Egyptian who has any information on individuals and companies 
dealing with the "Zionist enemy" to submit it to the above 
committee. 
  In a related item by al-Makkawi, a 3,000-word report on page 
4 recounts protests against the Hebron massacre carried out by 
students and faculty members at several Egyptian universities. 
<H5>  ROOTS OF JEWISH THOUGHT EXAMINED </H5>
  A 2,000-word back-page article on page 10 offers an analysis 
of the "doctrinal and cultural roots" that made a "Zionist army 
physician take the liberty of assassinating hundreds of 
Palestinians," a reference to the shooting of Muslim worshipers 
in Hebron. 
  The writer, Dr. Ahmad 'Abd-al-Rahman, says the Talmud 
teaches 
that the Gentiles are not human beings, the Torah permits the 
"Semites" to enslave the Canaanites, and Arabs have no right to 
resist Jewish settlement in Palestine. He says "Zionist racism" 
drew sustenance from "modern racist ideology in Europe and 
America," which is based on Greek philosophy and Roman culture, 
notably Aristotle's division of humanity into "Greek humans and 
non-Greek savages," a view which the writer says was adopted by 
the Romans. He says this ideology was further strengthened by 
Machiavellian thought. 
  The writer goes on to warn of possible nuclear attacks on 
Arab capitals such as Damascus, Baghdad, Khartoum, or even 
Mecca, especially as the United States has prevented the Arabs 
from acquiring similar weapons. 
  He says: "Such a possibility is not an illusion. The 
conditions to which we have been reduced encourage the sons of 
Israel and Judah to consider it." 
  He concludes by urging the overthrow of "the chains of 
secular government" because an Islamic government would respond 
with whatever weapons it had at hand and would proceed "on the 
path of glorious victory." 
<H5>  ANTI-SUDAN BRITISH CONSPIRACY </H5>
  A 300-word report by Muhammad 'Urfah on page 1 notes "a 
secret document revealing a British conspiracy against the 
Muslims in Sudan that is designed to seize the Nile sources". 
This document is a letter circulated by a group of British 
opposition politicians and reportedly sent by British Prime 
Minister John Major to his foreign secretary Douglas Hurd, 
specifying Britain's position on Sudan and other issues, 
including Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In the letter Major reportedly advocates south Sudan's 
secession with the help of media publicity, claiming that Arab 
Muslims are oppressing the Christian southerners, the aim being 
to "confront political Islam" in that country and Africa in 
general. 
  The document is said to reveal a report about the Nile 
water, 
of which Israel hopes to have a share; the projected control of 
all governments in the region in the 21st century; and the 
"Zionists' cooperation with the Turkish Government against Arab 
regimes and Islamic organizations." 
  The document reportedly discloses a British attempt to unite 
south Sudan's rebel factions with the help of a 
British-influenced local church to guarantee British, rather 
than U.S., influence in the region. 
  The document is said to hint at "extensive military 
intervention in south Sudan under UN supervision."

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 22 March 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Freedom of the Press Violations Criticized 
  2. Shaykh 'Abd-al-Kafi Banned From Preaching 
  3. Islamist Detainees Go on Hunger Strike 
  4. Clinton's Double Standards Policy Criticized 
  5. Religious Scholar Warns Against Cultural Invasion 
  6. Union Criticizes Clinton's Jerusalem Remarks 
<H5>  FREEDOM OF THE PRESS VIOLATIONS CRITICIZED </H5>
  Under a banner headline, the paper features a front-page 
400-word statement by the Labor Party's Political Bureau in 
which it decries the action of the state prosecution organs in 
summoning the officials and writers of the newspaper AL-SHA'B 
for questioning concerning "unfounded accusations" about what 
the paper published in connection with the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre. The statement says that the "State Security 
Investigations Department is considered a police organ 
responsible for maintaining security and order, and cannot 
assume the role of a press censor." 
  In a related unattributed 150-word report on this issue's 
front page, AL-SHA'B says that the "Egyptian Human Rights 
Organization has called on the authorities to stop the ongoing 
investigations by the Supreme State Security Office against 
officials of the Labor Party and AL-SHA'B newspaper regarding 
articles the paper has published in protest against the Israeli 
massacre in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque." 
  A 2,500-word editorial by Majdi Ahmad Husayn on pages 1 and 
2 
highlights the authorities' disregard for the freedom of the 
press and defends AL-SHA'B's reports and coverage of the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and its stories of corruption. 
  On pages 1 and 7, the paper publishes a 300-word report that 
Dr. Muhammad Hilmi Murad, deputy leader of the Labor Party, has 
been summoned for questioning regarding an article he wrote in 
the 8 March issue of AL-SHA'B under the headline: "This Popular 
Awakening Must Continue in Order To Correct Our Internal 
Conditions." The report says that Murad is accused of inciting 
hatred of the regime, preventing the state authorities from 
exercising their powers, and supporting the ideas of the 
fundamentalist groups. 
<H5>  SHAYKH 'ABD-AL-KAFI BANNED FROM PREACHING </H5>
  A 150-word front-page report by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im notes 
that "the security services have banned Shaykh Dr. 'Umar 
'Abd-al-Kafi from preaching in his Asad Ibn-al-Furat Mosque in 
al-Duqqi and from giving religious lessons. The mosque has been 
placed under the control of the Awqaf Ministry." 
<H5>  ISLAMIST DETAINEES GO ON HUNGER STRIKE </H5>
  A brief 30-word report on page 1 says that "the imprisoned 
Islamist detainees have declared a hunger strike in protest 
against ill-treatment, denial of visitation rights, confiscation

statement on Jerusalem. The statement says that "contrary to 
all diplomatic norms and international laws and treaties, and 
under pressure from the Zionist lobby, U.S. President Bill 
Clinton made a press statement in which he in effect recognized 
Islamic Jerusalem as the eternal capital of world Zionism, which 
has usurped Palestine." The statement adds that the union sees 
in this "irresponsible statement a clear threat to the Muslims 
and the Arabs and a declaration of war against our nation by the 
U.S. President."

  [Text] During meetings with several Western ambassadors at 
the PLO headquarters in the Tunisian capital, brother leader 
President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] stressed the need to ensure 
international protection for the Palestinians of the occupied 
territories. He underscored the role Europe can play to ensure 
this protection. These remarks were made in the aftermath of 
the martyrdom of six Fatah heroes in the Jabalyah camp the day 
before yesterday, Monday, at the hands of the terrorist 
undercover units affiliated with the Israeli Army. 
  Brother President Abu-'Ammar also underlined the need to 
implement UN Security Council Resolution 904, which provides for 
international protection for the Palestinian people. He held 
the United States and Russia, cosponsors of the peace process, 
responsible for providing this protection. 
  Brother leader President Abu-'Ammar described the 
assassination of the six Fatah heroes in the Jabalyah camp as a 
new massacre. He added: In this regard, the first possibility 
that comes to mind is that Rabin might have been well aware of 
the plans to commit these massacres. He might have chosen to 
condone them. The second possibility is that these massacres 
were committed by Israeli Army units without Rabin's prior 
knowledge. One can derive no comfort from either possibility. 
This has grave repercussions on the entire peace process, he 
maintained.

  [Text] Our great Palestinian people inside the homeland and 
abroad celebrate the glorious Land Day, as they continue 
relentless struggle to protect their national rights and to 
materialize them over the soil of the homeland to establish 
their independent state, with the capital Jerusalem, to ensure 
the return of every Palestinian to his homeland and to achieve a 
durable and just peace for the coming Palestinian generations 
over the land of Palestine, the land of peace, justice, and 
freedom. 
  On this occasion, Palestinian people confirm their 
indivisible unity, be it on the soil of the homeland or in the 
diaspora and continue the confrontation in all its forms, 
defending every grain of their homeland's soil, giving martyr 
after martyr, proving that any solution that undermines part of 
its rights will never pass nor will it be constant or durable. 
  Our people have affirmed that peace will be achieved 
effectively when these hotbeds are removed from the territory of 
their homeland in Hebron, Gaza, Nablus, Jericho, and Holy 
Jerusalem, the capital of the independent State of Palestine, 
the heart of the Palestinian homeland, and the epitome of its 
independence as well as the conscience of every Palestinian 
wherever his place is in the homeland or outside it. 
  [Passage omitted] Despite all the forms of suffering, 
oppression, and pain, the dawn of freedom is approaching. The 
day of the revival of Palestine with its land, people, and 
entity has become a reality confirmed by the world, which is 
waiting for the moment when it will be undoubtedly achieved on 
the political and geographic map in the Middle East. Our land, 
which has been irrigated by generous and pure blood, is living 
the dawn of the forthcoming independence. 
  The PLO reiterates its determination to continue the path 
consecrated by the sacrifices of Palestinian generations; this 
is the path of struggle and steadfastness as well as work for 
the just peace, which is based on international legality and its 
resolutions, the latest of which is resolution 904 of the UN 
Security Council. This provides for international protection for 
our people and puts a decisive end to the crimes of the Israeli 
army units, their settlers, and enmity and massacres against our 
steadfast people on the land of their homeland. 
  [Passage omitted] We express our salutation to our devoted 
martyrs on the glorious Land Day and we promise our people who 
are prisoners that the certain day of freedom is approaching. 
The great people with its whole population promises that every 
day is a holiday of the sacred land, that freedom and 
independence will be achieved, and that there will be a return 
to the sacred land of Palestine and holy Jerusalem to all our 
devoted sons who made sacrifices for it. 
  In the name of God the merciful and compassionate; that even 
the apostle and those of faith who were with him cried: When 
will come the help of God? Ah verily, the help of God is always 
near. God Almighty has said the truth. [previous paragraph 
Koranic verse]

<F P=106> [Unidentified commentary] </F>
  [Text] Iranian Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati, 
leading a key political delegation, yesterday left on an 
official tour of six African states. During his African tour, 
Dr. Velayati will visit Guinea-Conakry, Burkina Faso, Namibia, 
Zimbabwe, Uganda, and Kenya. 
  At present, the Islamic Republic of Iran has diplomatic 
relations with more than 20 African states, enjoying cordial and 
friendly ties with nearly most of the African countries. 
Subsequent to such ties, political and cultural teams have been 
exchanging visits, embarking on development of economic 
relations. 
  It must be recalled that during the previous regime, on 
account of the posturings of the then ruling cliques, Iran did 
not enjoy good relations with most of the African states. As a 
result, the former regime had set up political and economic 
relations at a limited level with only a few African countries 
and in particular with the racist regime of South Africa. In 
the wake of the victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran, the 
Islamic republic's foreign policy gave priority to establishing 
relations with the Third World states, especially with the 
African countries. In this same connection, Iran has endeavored 
to increase its economic and cultural relations with them. 
  Undoubtedly, continuation of this trend and regular meetings 
between the officials of Iran and these states confirm the 
reality that, due to common bonds existing between Iran and 
these countries in various political and commercial spheres, 
there is available considerable potential for enhancing and 
bolstering mutual ties. For instance, the six African states 
referred to earlier possess huge mineral reserves, such as gold, 
diamonds, silver, and iron ore, and also farm products like 
coffee, cocoa, tea, rice, sugar cane, and cotton. Therefore, 
they can forge good cooperation with the Islamic Republic of 
Iran in various economic fields. Reciprocally, there are useful 
experiences enjoyed by Iran in exploiting industrial and mineral 
raw material, and also in education, technical, and vocational 
training. These are some cases which provide suitable ground 
for expansion of cooperation and also cementing of ties by these 
states with Iran. 
  In view of these points, political observers attach 
significance to Dr. Velayati's tour of these six countries. 
They assess the tour as beneficial to bilateral interests and 
also to further bolstering of political, economic, and cultural 
relations, besides a sustained cooperation with international 
circles.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Qobi Meydan, from the "As Of Now" program -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Meydan] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres is on 
the line. Good morning, sir. 
  [Peres] Good morning. 
  [Meydan] Do you know whether the agreement with the PLO has 
been signed already? 
  [Peres] What I know is that it is supposed to be signed at 
this time. The main thing is that there is an agreement. 
  [Meydan] Do you think the agreement is good for Israel? 
  [Peres] Look, it would have been better had there been no 
need for this agreement, which arose after the events in Hebron. 
But in view of what happened, it is a very good agreement. 
  [Meydan] How much have we ceded? 
  [Peres] I do not know what you mean by ceded. We never 
intended to annex Hebron, either the Likud or Labor. Hebron 
will probably have partial autonomy. There is an incredible 
tension there as a result of the Cave of the Patriarchs event, 
and that is not surprising. We are all constantly discussing 
borders, places, situations. The truth is the main problem is 
relations. If we had different relations, there would be no 
problem with Hebron. I think that what we have done was a great 
attempt to heal understandable emotional and spiritual wounds. 
  [Meydan] What will the multinational contingents do there? 
I understand that several countries will participate. 
  [Peres] First of all, they will calm raging tempers. Also, 
they will help rebuild as much as possible, to restore a normal, 
more reasonable life. Things like that. They will also help 
the municipality reorganize economically and socially. 
  [Meydan] How will they be armed? 
  [Peres] They will have weapons for self-defense -- probably 
handguns. 
  [Meydan] Will they have any powers vis-a-vis IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] soldiers? 
  [Peres] No, no, they will not deal with any security 
aspects. 
  [Meydan] Not even vis-a-vis settlers? 
  [Peres] Settlers do not enter the picture. Overall 
responsibility should remain in the hands of the legitimate 
government, and we are the legitimate government. The same 
applies to the Cave of the Patriarchs: Neither the settlers nor 
the worshipers of either religion are in charge of the cave. 
The exclusive, overall responsibility is of the Government of 
Israel, and the Government of Israel is the one that will 
safeguard security and ensure that worshipers can access the 
site they hold holy and pray without fearing anything. This is 
our responsibility, and we will not shirk from it. 
  [Meydan] There is one word we have been shirking: 
internationalization. It is now part of the Hebron vocabulary. 
  [Peres] Where is the connection? Internationalization means 
the replacement of a sovereign government with an international 
government. There is no international government here. 
Observers have been known to be deployed in the past, such as 
in the Sinai, Gaza, Golan, in all kinds of places. 
  [Meydan] In territories under Israeli sovereignty? 
  [Peres] You are wrong, this territory is not under Israeli 
sovereignty. Hebron is not under Israeli sovereignty, it is 
under Israeli control. In the Camp David Accords, Mr. Begin 
agreed that this place, like other locations, would not be 
annexed. 
  [Meydan] Then the international presence is not something 
that can be extended.... 
  [Peres, interrupting] The international presence is 
temporary, limited in time. I hope we will revert to better, 
more normal times shortly. 
  [Meydan] But the Palestinians are attaching great 
significance to this force. 
  [Peres] Their attaching great significance does not disturb 
me. There is nothing wrong with it, if it helps restore normal 
life. 
  [Meydan] How should we understand their waiving a 
Palestinian police? 
  [Peres] I think they did not want a force subordinate to the 
IDF. 
  [Meydan] Were they afraid of responsibility, perhaps? 
  [Peres] I do not think so. Rather, afraid of the symbolism 
of such a thing. Why had Palestinian policemen resigned in the 
past? Because of the same reasons; there had been about 900 
policemen in Judaea and Samaria, and they all resigned. 
  [Meydan] The reports from Cairo are slightly confusing; 
perhaps we could try to understand them. They appeared to be 
referring to a return to the negotiations on the implementation 
of the Gaza and Jericho agreement, but there is now talk about 
Israeli consent to an early withdrawal from Gaza. 
  [Peres] It has been agreed that negotiations complementing 
the talks on the implementation of the Gaza and Jericho 
agreement would be started at once, that the negotiations and 
the implementation would be accelerated. It had been agreed in 
Taba that Palestinian policemen will deploy in several locations 
in the Gaza Strip and Jericho even before the negotiations are 
completed. This is what is going to happen. 
  [Meydan] When will it happen? 
  [Peres] Within a week or so, I suppose. 
  [Meydan] Will they have overall powers? 
  [Peres] No, no, the powers are retained....[pauses] There 
cannot be two concurrent authorities. We are the authority, and 
we will remain the only authority until such time as we are 
replaced by another authority when an agreement has been 
reached. There will be no two concurrent authorities. 
  [Meydan] We are very close to 13 April. 
  [Peres] We may be able to implement a considerable part of 
the agreement by then and to turn the agreement, which has been 
a pile of papers until now, into a new reality. For the first 
time, the Palestinians will receive a measure of reality that 
will include land, responsibility, powers. Although it is not 
independence and sovereignty, it is still self-rule in the full 
sense of the word. 
  [Meydan] Thank you very much, Minister Shim'on Peres. 
  [Peres] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [Full text of statement by presidential spokesman Mr. </F>
Mihoubi to national media; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] At the presidency, Mr. Mihoubi met the national 
media and read out a statement that revealed the framework of 
the national dialogue proceedings with parties, associations, 
and personalities since its resumption on 9 March. The full 
text of the presidential spokesman's statement follows: 
  The head of state has always stressed, in his statements to 
the nation, his commitment to implement all political, economic, 
social, and security targets contained in the platform the 
National Dialogue Commission endorsed. 
  In this framework, a presidential statement on 18 March 1994 
was announced on the head of state's intentions to resume 
political dialogue and received for that reason national 
figures, political parties, economic and social associations. 
  Accordingly, as of 19 March and until now, the head of state 
held discussions during the first phase with national 
personalities and representatives of the Movement for Democracy 
in Algeria, Party of Algerian Renewal, Ennahda, Ettahadi 
movement, National Liberation Front [FLN], Hamas, as well as 
representatives of the following social and economic 
organizations: National Organization of War Veterans, General 
Union of Algerian Workers, National Union of Framers, National 
Association of Public Administration Cadres, National 
Organization of Martyrs' Sons, National Union of Public 
Contractors, confederation of association of managers of local 
public enterprises, Confereation of Algeruab employers, genreal 
confederation of Algerian economic operators, Union of Algerian 
Students, retired staff of the National People's Army and Youth 
and women's associations. 
  During all those meetings, the head of state clarified and 
specified what he meant by serious dialogue -- without excluding 
anyone -- within the framework of respecting the constitution. 
It is a constructive framework capable of bringing together all 
Algerians concerned about the country's security and interest of 
its people. The head of state stressed that serious dialogue 
was such that dealt with current problems facing the nation. 
They were urgent problems that required urgent and quick 
solutions. 
  The head of state also said dialogue that did not exclude 
anyone and respected the constitution was one that accepted 
differences in opinion. However, it was on the condition that 
these opinions fell within the framework of respecting the 
constitution, that principal law which formed the nation's 
common denominator, and was the primary guarantee for the 
promotion of democracy. 
  Accordingly, respect for the constitution rules out all 
dialogue with all those who violate it by resorting to violence. 
The head of state added that terrorism, violence, and the 
attempt to sabotage the country was a matter that necessitated 
mobilizing all nationalists to eradicate these phenomena by all 
means and methods provided by the law and the country's 
sovereignty. He said that the state, on its part, was 
determined to shoulder all its responsibilities to confront this 
violence and to firmly and continuously fight it. But he added 
that the security solution alone was not sufficient. 
  It is true. Just as it emerged in the platform endorsed by 
the national conference, security work must be consolidated by 
political action. These culmulative actions are aimed at 
tearing out the roots of violence forever from our society. 
  The president took this opportunity to provide 
clarifications 
on the contacts he carried out with the dissolved Islamic 
Salvation Front [FIS]. In this context, the head of state 
reminded that many parties had proposed taking appeasing 
measures to put a stop to the phenomenon of violence throughout 
the dialogue process by the National Dialogue Commission. At 
the same time, the leaders of that suspended movement expressed 
their readiness to work towards putting a stop to violence and 
restoring calm. 
  Mr. Lamine Zeroual, who then met personally with FIS 
officials in his capacity as national defense minister, got 
their commitment to work in that direction. Appeasing measures 
were taken by the government, including the release of two FIS 
personalities with the agreement of the other detained leaders. 
Those two personalities were given a mandate by their 
colleagues to carry out the commitments they made to put a stop 
to terrorism and for the return of calm and security. 
  These commitments have not yet been implemented until our 
present day. But the head of state insisted on clarifying that 
the national values and constitutional principles are 
unnegotiable, just as defending the country's unity, security, 
and citizens were. During these talks, the head of state 
reminded those he spoke to that during the transitional period, 
he would remain attentive to epitomize all the aims contained in 
the platform endorsed by the national conference. He added that 
this result would enable the existence of necessary conditions 
for the return to elections, which was everyone's aim. 
  The head of state expressed his hopes that the dialogue 
would 
allow the entwining of efforts and collective energy to 
epitomize all these aims. The meetings, which the head of state 
convened during the last two weeks, recorded vast feelings on 
the dangerous state the country was going through. Those he 
spoke to said they were prepared to promote this dialogue to 
serve the nation's higher interests. Thank you. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report:"Two Algerian Female Students </F>
Assassinated Because of Veil Issue"] 
  [Text] London, Algiers, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, news agencies 
-- Two Algerian gunmen have assassinated two Algerian female 
students while were standing at a bus stop in Boumerdes province 
near the Algerian capital. 
  The incident occurred the day before yesterday after noon 
near the two students' Boudouaou Secondary School. One of the 
two girls was killed instantly. Her name is Rozeika Miloud 
Jammi (18). The second, Neima Kar Ali (19), died of her wounds 
in the hospital. The two gunmen escaped on a motorcycle. 
  The security services did not say whether or not the two 
students who were killed at the bus stop, where they were 
waiting to return to their home after the end of school, were 
wearing a veil. With this incident the number of female 
students killed in attacks attributed to members of the armed 
groups who threatened women who refuse to wear a veil has risen 
to three. 
  The Algerian security services have also announced that 
Sadouki Sadouk (53), regional director of the Algerian Red 
Crescent in the Sidi Rash [as transliterated], was killed in his 
home last Monday by two gunmen. 
  Reports in the Algerian capital have said that the day 
before 
yesterday the special court in the capital passed -- in absentia 
-- 12 death sentences on a group of gunmen on charges of harming 
state security and forming armed groups. 
  The group comprises 27 people, 16 of whom attended the 
trial. 
Six of these 16 were acquitted. One person was sentenced to 
seven years in prison, and nine to three years in prison. The 
group is accused of setting up an ambush in July 1993 for a 
police patrol in which three members of the patrol were killed 
and five abducted. 
  The Algerian Oran special court yesterday sentenced to death 
two gunmen for killing three policemen seven months ago. The 
two policemen are Lazrak Ben Sidi Ahmed and Mohamed Hemidi. 
  In Paris, Said Saadi, secretary general of the Rally for 
Culture and Democracy in Algeria, urged armed resistance against 
violence in Algeria. He said that "armed groups and 
self-defense cells" have been formed in that country. Saadi 
said in his opposition party's name in an interview with the 
French newspaper LE FIGARO yesterday that, as a result of the 
"state's importance" in the face of violence, society now 
understands that it has to run its own affairs, even at the 
security level. He also stressed that "a civil war has been 
imposed on society and we must confront it."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Talbott's Mission"] </F>
  [Text] US Assistant Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is 
expected to visit Pakistan and India towards the first week of 
April carrying, according to Press reports, the outline of a 
package deal to implement the American nuclear non-proliferation 
agenda for the region. The deal would first ask Pakistan and 
then India to cap their nuclear programmes. To sweeten the pill 
for Pakistan, the undelivered 38 F-16s Pakistan has already paid 
for as well as some P-3 Orion anti-submarine attack planes would 
be delivered as a one-time exception to the Pressler Amendment. 
Both the nuclear programmes of Pakistan and India would be 
opened up to international inspection and verification. A 
five-power conference comprising Pakistan, India, China, Russia 
and the US, with the possible inclusion of Britain, France, 
Germany and Japan, would be convened to obtain pledges from 
Pakistan and India that they will ban nuclear tests. Both 
countries would be asked not to develop and deploy ballistic 
missiles as potential delivery systems for nuclear warheads. 
For some time now, conflicting signals have been emanating from 
the Clinton administration which indicate its desire to find a 
way round the Pressier Amendment, not out of any love for 
Pakistan, but in order to have sufficient leverage to persuade 
us to forego our nuclear option. Congressional opposition led 
by Senator Pressler has so far made that difficult for the US 
government. Even the package under discussion has come under 
fire during hearings of the US Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. 
  Whether the Clinton administration will be able to negotiate 
all these reefs before Mr Talbott's arrival in South Asia is 
highly doubtful, given the strength of opposition to its 
proposals from Congress. It seems premature therefore for us to 
be speculating whether Pakistan has agreed to any of these 
proposals, which could hardly be said to have jelled even within 
the American foreign policy establishment, in any case. Mr 
Talbott's package hardly contains anything new or startling. 
All these proposals have been mooted in the recent past, some, 
like the five-power conference, by Pakistan itself. The 
obstacles too, are well known and formidable. The most 
intractable is India's continuing hegemonistic ambitions in the 
area which have led it to develop a nuclear weapon which it 
tested as far back as 1974, arm itself to the teeth despite 
possessing the fourth largest army in the world which lends it 
overwhelming military superiority over all its neighbours, and 
its stubborn refusal to engage in meaningful discussions let 
alone accept any reasonable solution to the Kashmir issue. It 
has tried to defect the US pressure for non-proliferation in the 
region by hiding behind the demand for global nuclear 
disarmament. It has tried to defect the US pressure for 
non-proliferation in the region by hiding behind the demand for 
global nuclear disarmament. It has not even been prepared to 
take seriously the five-power conference proposal which seeks to 
meet its argument that it faces a nuclear threat from China. 
Given this reality, it might be more productive if Mr Talbott 
could first persuade India to cap its nuclear programme and 
discuss the core issue of Kashmir seriously with Pakistan before 
the `demonstration effect' could assuage Pakistan's very real 
concerns. If, however, flying in the face of these facts, the 
US is training its guns on Pakistan because it thinks it can 
pressurise us more easily than India since it has greater 
leverage over us, it is seriously underestimating the will of 
our people to forego even badly needed aircraft in order to 
safeguard our national interests. In the furtherance of those 
interests, before Mr Talbott arrives, it would be in the fitness 
of things if the government were to take the nation into 
confidence and sit down with the Opposition to chalk out a joint 
position to resist any pressures the US may be planning to exert.

  [Text] Indian troops have committed 822 cease-fire 
violations along the Line of Control [LOC] in Azad Kashmir 
during 1993. This was stated at a briefing for a group of 
journalists, including members of foreign news media, held in 
Azad Kashmir. During these violations, Indians fired 0.4 
million rounds of small arms and 400 grenades, killing 36 
civilians and wounding 110, including women and children. The 
mediamen were told that the Indians have started sabotage 
activities in Azad Kashmir villages close to the Line of Control 
with a view to forcing the local population to abandon those 
areas. On their side of the LOC, the Indians had forcibly 
evacuated all civilians creating miles deep depopulated belts. 
The newsmen were informed that Indian were also seen building 
concrete bunkers and strengthening defenses. Three layers of 
defense have been set up so as to deny any entry into or exit 
from occupied Kashmir. People, who lost limbs in Indian firing, 
spoke of the trauma to which they were frequently subjected due 
to the enemy's unprovoked firing. The journalists also met 
wounded civilians under treatment at Army's main (?resting) 
station at Kotli. These persons sustained injured as a result 
of Indian firing from across the Line of Control. They were 
evacuated and provided medical care at Army's field hospitals on 
humanitarian grounds.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pursuing nuclear nonproliferation"] </F>
  [Text] The United States has now, reportedly, sought to 
expand the framework of the proposed five-nation conference on 
nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia. The proposal envisages 
India, Pakistan, China, Russia, and the United States together 
working out a formula for a nuclear-free South Asia. India, 
however, has been reluctant to participate in any such 
conference on the grounds that it is not prepared to limit 
consideration of nonproliferation strategies aimed only at South 
Asia. It has recently reiterated this position during the 
course of a visit by the US assistant secretary of state for 
South Asia. India's contention is that in the presence of a 
nuclear-armed China it is not possible for it to consider 
capping its nuclear programme. 
  Now the US proposal to expand the framework to include 
Britain, France, Japan and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) could be seen as a way of bringing more pressure 
to bear upon the two sides to work out some kind of an 
acceptable arrangement. The current US emphasis does not appear 
to be on absolute nuclear disarmament. The effort is now 
directed at getting the two sides, at least in the initial 
stage, to freeze their existing arsenals at current levels. The 
objective of a roll-back would be pursued at a later stage. As 
a part of this graduated approach, also, Pakistan has repeatedly 
signalled its willingness to undertake the necessary 
nonproliferation measures in tandem with a similar policy on the 
part of India. The latter has, however, continued to invoke the 
argument of a nuclear China as well as the need to discuss any 
such measures not by reference just to South Asia but in a much 
broader, global, context. In a sense, this proposal by 
including among the participants all the permanent members of 
the Security Council, as well as Japan and the IAEA does meet 
India's demands for a broader context for discussing the issue 
of nonproliferation. But how much help this will be in getting 
India to make any meaningful change in its rigid position on the 
issue remains to be seen. In any such context Pakistan could 
also find itself being subjected to increasing pressure by 
powerful global and regional actors. It is important, 
therefore, for Pakistan's policy-makers to identify its policy 
options carefully in this regard, beyond the understandable 
linkage with India's nuclear programme that it has continued to 
emphasise. There appears to be a heightened US interest in 
Pakistan's nuclear programme as demonstrated by its recent offer 
to allow the sale of 38 F-16s that Pakistan has already paid for 
in exchange for a verifiable capping of its nuclear programme. 
The upcoming visit by the US deputy secretary of state is also 
in the same context. While there appears to be general 
consensus in Pakistan on rejecting this offer it is interesting 
that it has been opposed also by Senator Pressler as well as 
Indian policy-makers, perhaps as a result of the apprehension 
that it will leave Pakistan with the ability to assemble a 
limited number of nuclear devices in short order while 
augmenting the ability of its air force, not least in the 
department of nuclear weapons delivery, in considerable measure. 
In any case Pakistan, while remaining mindful of its own 
security interest and the options available, should welcome the 
proposals to discuss the various aspects of the nonproliferation 
issue in a broader framework. Among other things, it should 
help in subjecting India's case for a voiding any meaningful 
response to Pakistan's various initiatives for a nuclear-free 
South Asia to a thorough review by the international community.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "F-16's in Lieu of Nuclear Program -- </F>
Unacceptable Deal"] 
  [Text] Lynn Davis, the U.S. under secretary of state, has 
said the United States is ready to supply F-16 aircraft to 
Pakistan on the condition that Islamabad halts its nuclear 
program. The U.S. under secretary of state added that the 
administration will ask Congress to lift the restrictions on 
military aid so it can hand over the F-16 aircraft to Pakistan 
for which payment has already been made, but in return Islamabad 
will have to give assurances that it will not make any further 
advances in its nuclear program. 
  Pakistan has repeatedly assured the international community 
that its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes, that 
it does not intend to manufacture a nuclear bomb, and that it 
does not harbor any aggressive designs against any country, even 
though India has already exploded a nuclear device and committed 
two acts of aggression against Pakistan. The United States has 
maintained a policy of overlooking the nuclear programs of 
India, South Africa, and Israel, but its strategy vis-a-vis 
Islamic countries -- especially Pakistan -- has been to prevent 
them from acquiring modern technology at all costs. When the 
former Soviet Union was alive as another superpower, the U.S. 
attitude was somewhat flexible; but with the disintegration of 
the USSR, the United States -- swollen with pride at being the 
sole superpower -- has been continuously pressuring Pakistan. 
This is why it has not only approved discriminatory legislation 
in the form of the Pressler Amendment, but has also refused to 
deliver aircraft for which we have already made payment. 
  If Pakistan were situated in a peaceful region without such 
a 
crafty and cunning neighbor as India, it would not have needed 
to start a nuclear program or spend a large chunk of its 
resources on defense. Pakistan -- which has faced two 
aggressions and lost half of its territory -- cannot afford to 
demonstrate any weakness or enter any deal regarding its nuclear 
program. The only reason India has not attacked Pakistan so 
far, despite its intentions, is the nuclear deterrent. It is 
also a fact that the United States has shown it is not 
Pakistan's trusted friend. After the way it turned away from 
Pakistan after the withdrawal of the Soviet troops and tried to 
improve relations with India, it is impossible for Islamabad to 
accept Washington's offer, abandon its nuclear program, and in 
exchange rely on U.S. weapons or try to live with U.S. promises 
that proved unreliable during the 1965 and 1971 wars. 
  Pakistan has forwarded several proposals to eliminate 
regional tension and declare South Asia a nuclear-free zone. 
These proposals have included a nonaggression treaty and a 
five-nation conference that has been supported by the United 
States. India, however, has never given a positive or favorable 
response to these proposals, thereby proving its aggressive 
designs. The United States has been pressuring Pakistan to sign 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Pakistan is ready to 
sign the NPT on the condition that India does the same. Even 
this is not in Pakistan's interests, because it does not have 
the strength to face India with conventional weapons. Moreover, 
India is not even ready to sign the NPT. The United States has 
also been pressuring Pakistan to open Kahuta and other nuclear 
research centers for inspection. This is tantamount to 
eliminating Pakistan's nuclear program, because the inspections 
would be the same as those carried out against the Iraqi nuclear 
installations, as a result of which the United States silenced 
Iraq. If Washington thinks that any Pakistani Government could 
remain in power after committing such a blunder, it is mistaken. 
The U.S. assistant secretary of state is due to arrive in 
Pakistan in a few days; the Pakistani Government must not 
demonstrate any weakness in this regard. 
  If Washington -- ignoring the ethics of trade -- intends to 
demand a quid pro quo for the delivery of those F-16 aircraft 
that were paid for in cash, it is outrageous. The government 
must stand firm rather than bowing to this blackmail and meet 
the situation by keeping the nation informed. There is no need 
to indulge in confrontation with the United States. In the 
context of its national interests and regional situation, 
however, Washington can be convinced that its discriminatory 
attitude is harming its own interests and its image is being 
tarnished in the eyes of the Islamic world. In this context, 
the government should apprise the opposition of all the details 
and tell the United States that we want friendship, not 
submission.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, met yesterday evening with 
the brother members of the Political Forces Dialogue Committee. 
The meeting addressed several issues on the local scene, as 
well as the efforts being made by the committee to end the 
political crisis. The conferees also reviewed the decisions 
reached by the committee during its recent meetings in the 
commercial and economic capital, Aden. These decisions aim at 
implementing the accord document, activating Constitutional 
agencies, enhancing trust between political leaders, and 
supporting efforts to lead Yemen to a safe haven. The purpose 
of this is to safeguard Yemeni unity and democracy and build a 
modern Yemeni state. 
  During the meeting, the brother chairman of the Presidential 
Council welcomed the members of the committee and blessed the 
committee's decisions. He said: We bless you and highly 
appreciate the committee's efforts that resulted in the accord 
document. This shows concern on the part of everybody. The 
homeland is, after all, for everybody and it is the duty of 
every patriotic and well-meaning individual to seek an end to 
the crisis that has plagued our people for more than seven 
months. 
  Addressing the dialogue committee, the brother chairman 
said: 
We do not want you to be biased toward this or that party. We 
want you to favor the homeland and to champion it wisely and 
adroitly. The interests of the homeland should be placed above 
all other considerations. The political forces and all the sons 
of the homeland are responsible for ridding the homeland of the 
ongoing developments and schemes to foil the homeland's unity. 
These schemes cannot succeed unless there are domestic tools to 
implement them and unless the doors are open to them. We should 
close all doors and not allow the fragmentation of national 
unity, whatever the differences. We should have recourse to 
dialogue and not infringe on constant national principles and 
not harm our unity. It is better for us to sit at the 
negotiating table right from the very beginning to find 
solutions to our problems, instead of resorting to armed 
struggle and violence and later sitting at the negotiating 
table, having shed blood and destroyed the homeland. 
  The brother chairman stressed the need for the dialogue 
committee to monitor the official media and make sure they abide 
by the committee's decisions and end the media campaigns. He 
said the Dialogue Committee should make a decision to assume 
direct supervision, through work teams, over all airports and 
seaports in Aden, Sanaa, Hadhramaut, al-Hudaydah, Ta'izz, and 
other Yemeni ports to make sure no weapons or military equipment 
and hardware are imported from abroad, and to stop military 
escalation. 
  The brother chairman reiterated the commitment of the 
General 
People's Congress [GPC] to any decision adopted in this regard. 
He also denied press reports that Yemen has imported 
internationally banned weapons. He expressed extreme regret 
over hearing such unfounded rumors. He said: Whatever the 
political differences between the political organizations, we 
should not allow this to reach the level of harming Yemen and 
its international reputation. Repeating such false rumors does 
not harm just one political side alone; it harms all the Yemeni 
people and distorts their image worldwide. Consequently, it 
will be difficult to remove such a distorted image in the short 
run. Everybody should enjoy national responsibility toward such 
irresponsible practices. We should enhance mutual trust. The 
Dialogue Committee should also intensify its efforts so the 
homeland can recover and trust can be restored. This will enable 
everybody to devote their efforts to promoting a safe, stable 
homeland enjoying unity and democracy. 
  The meeting was attended by brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the Presidential Council and GPC 
assistant secretary general.

  [Text] Tehran, March 28, IRNA -- Oil Minister Gholam Reza 
Aqazadeh said here Monday that Saudi Arabia's decision to oppose 
any decrease in the OPEC's production ceiling has only served to 
keep down the price of oil. 
  Speaking at a press conference upon his return from an OPEC 
ministerial meeting in Geneva, Aqazadeh regretted that political 
issues always affected the decisions of the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). 
  He did not rule out the possibility that Saudi Arabia's 
decision might be linked with Iran's position on the number of 
Iranian pilgrims for this year's Hajj pilgrimage. 
  Saudi Arabia has decided to cut the number of Iranian 
pilgrims from 115,000 to 60,000. 
  On the sideline of the OPEC meeting, he said, some Saudi 
Arabian delegates raised the issue concerning the quota of 
Iranian pilgrims and criticized the Iranian press for their 
stance on the matter. 
  According to Aqazadeh if the OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers 
had agreed to cut their output ceiling, it would have pushed up 
the price of oil up to three to four dollars per barrel.

  [Text] The foreign ministers of the Arab League member 
states held a session in Cairo on March 26th. 
  The participants in the Cairo session are discussing the 
cancellation of the indirect economic embargo against the 
Zionist regime. The embargo includes that group of companies 
and institutions which have economic and commercial deals with 
the Israeli regime. The Arab states imposed the economic 
sanctions since the early 1950's in the wake of recurrence of 
the first war between Arabs and the Israelis. Based on the 
Zionist regime officials, within this period of time Israel has 
sustained over $50 billion in loss. 
  With the start of the Arab-Israeli peace process and the 
Arab-Zionist mutual talks paving of grounds for lifting of 
economic sanctions against that regime by the United States have 
been further revealed. This took a more serious form with the 
conclusion of the Gaza-Jericho agreement by the Zionist regime 
and the PLO. Since last September -- that is, the time when the 
agreement was signed -- the U.S. pressures on Arabs for easing 
the economic sanctions against Israel have been stepped up. 
These pressures as well as spread of reports on some 
agreements reached between some Arab states and the Zionist 
regime over economic plans caused the Arab League general 
secretary, 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, to declare late last year that 
the Arab League will hold a session in March to discuss the 
lifting of the indirect economic embargo against Israel. 
  In the past six months reports regarding the possibility of 
cancellation of economic embargo of Israel by Arabs have 
entailed various reactions among the Arab countries. Despite 
the silence maintained by Arab countries, Syria, Sudan, and 
Libya have shown protesting reactions towards such a 
possibility. The Syrian Prime Minister Faruq al-Shar' upon 
arrival in Cairo on Friday said the issue of lifting of the 
Israeli sanctions by the Arabs will not be dealt with as long as 
the Israeli forces have not evacuated the occupied lands and a 
Palestinian country is not established. 
  Political observers assess these comments which in fact 
indicate serious posturing toward the Arab League session in 
Cairo today as a kind of taking of position by that group of 
Arab states which are not satisfied with the Arab-Israeli peace 
process. However, in line of their current regional situation 
it is not easy to predict whether this might leave an impact on 
decision-making of the Cairo session or not.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "OPEC Fails To Lower Crude Production"] </F>
  [Text] Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC) Saturday failed to agree on new 
production ceilings and decided to extend the current 24.5 
million barrels a day level. 
  Prior to the meeting, some OPEC nations including Iran and 
Kuwait had indicated their willingness to cut production to 
boost prices. Several non-OPEC producers excluding Britain, 
Norway, and Mexico also favored lower crude export levels which 
would bring higher prices and prolong the life of underground 
crude reserves. 
  Britain and Norway claim that keeping the current level and 
even increasing it has been planned a long time ago based on 
"long-term investment programs." 
  Self interest is obviously the main consideration for 
agreeing to any changes in production volume by the individual 
members of OPEC. However, it does not necessarily follow that a 
formula cannot be found that will benefit all members as well as 
the non-OPEC crude exporters. 
  Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter of petroleum, 
saying it needs to keep its production at the current level to 
pay for its foreign debts, disrupted any semblance of consensus 
by disagreeing to any production cuts. On the surface the Saudi 
stance seems reasonable. But this is the same country that a 
few weeks ago bought $6 billion worth of U.S.-made planes from 
manufacturers who were on the verge of bankruptcy. it is hard 
to understand the Kingdom's policy which costs its nation huge 
sums in order to save American businesses but at the same time 
endangers and actually damages the economies of its own 
neighbors by reducing their oil revenues. 
  Iran's Oil Minister, Gholamreza Aqazadeh, proposed a 1.4 
million barrels a day collective reduction in OPEC's crude 
output amounting to an overall 6 percent drop in production 
volume. At the same time Oman, representing 8 non-OPEC 
producers, offered to cut non-OPEC production by 250,000 barrels 
a day. Aqazadeh quoted the OPEC Secretariat as saying that the 
above proposed cuts would have resulted in a $4 a barrel 
increase in crude prices. This will more than offset Saudi 
Arabia's lower oil revenues if production ceilings are dropped. 
  Considering the fact that all OPEC nations, particularly 
Saudi Arabia which has the largest production volume, will 
economically benefit from higher prices the Kingdom's opposition 
to lowering production volumes seems contrary to its own 
interests. 
  By keeping crude prices low the Saudi rulers are in effect 
giving higher priority to the interests of the United States, 
which wants cheap crude, than to their own economic well being 
and political independence, and in the process they are creating 
financial inconveniences for their neighbors.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Capitalizing on Politicization of Hajj"] </F>
  [Text] This spring provides an auspicious opportunity for 
the leadership of Saudi Arabia to prove its good will towards 
all Muslims including the people of the Islamic Republic by 
making independent policy decisions relating to the Organization 
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the handling of the 
Hajj pilgrimage. 
  Due to their economic and political potentials, Iran and 
Saudi Arabia are capable of bringing about stability and a 
spirit of cooperation in the Persian Gulf region and the Middle 
East as a whole. 
  The key role played by both countries in the world's oil 
markets, their proximity to the Persian Gulf's northern and 
southern shores, together with their common religious heritage 
makes them natural allies. A Tehran-Riyadh axis can be 
instrumental in creating a political and economic critical mass 
large enough to address the problems currently facing the 
Islamic world. 
  Despite their national and regional interests, the Saudis 
have subordinated their domestic and foreign policies to the 
United States' hegemonic objectives in the Middle East. By 
doing so, they have diluted their own political independence and 
have identified themselves too closely with Washington's 
interests which are at odds with the aspirations of the Islamic 
world. 
  The three salient Saudi policies which run contrary to the 
interests of the region and do not bestow much honor on the 
Saudi leaders are: producing more than their OPEC quota; 
facilitating an American presence in the Persian Gulf; and 
reducing the limit on the number of Iranian pilgrims to Mecca in 
the Hajj season. 
  Riyadh has so far failed to formulate a cohesive policy 
based 
on the recent Islamic and Arab political experiences, and has 
not been able to differentiate between its national and regional 
interests, and those of the Western powers. 
  The Islamic Republic recognizes Riyadh's right to make 
independent policy decisions, so long as those decisions are 
based on the principles of peaceful coexistence with and mutual 
respect for neighboring countries. However, Tehran is not 
prepared to accept the political and economic cost of its 
neighbor's shortsighted policies which will ultimately affect 
the welfare of the Islamic Republic and other Muslim countries 
of the Middle East. 
  After 15 years of Saudi enmity towards the Islamic Republic 
with the resulting negative consequences for the Islamic and 
Arab worlds, a review of Riyadh's policies towards Iran based on 
mutual respect and interests is now in order. 
  The Saudi leadership's decision to lower the number of 
Iranian pilgrims was made, supposedly, because of construction 
projects to expand the holy Grand Mosque of Mecca which 
surrounds the holy Ka'ba. But according to informed sources, 
renovations were completed some time ago. 
  This Saudi decision to, unjustifiably, reduce the number of 
pilgrims from the Islamic Republic is politically motivated and 
reflects the wishes of certain factions in the House of Sa'ud 
whose interests are served by sowing dissension between Iran and 
Saudi Arabia. 
  Under the present circumstances, the Saudi leadership needs 
to make a courageous political decision to remove the existing 
strained relations between the two countries.

  [Text] All diplomatic and service passports will change as 
of 1 April, but ordinary passports will continue to be valid. 
  Manuchehr Mottaki, Iranian deputy foreign affairs minister 
for legal, consular and parliamentary affairs said the reason 
for the changing of passports was to insert concepts of the 
Islamic system and stop possible misuse. 
  Mr. Mottaki added: The new diplomatic and service passports 
will be introduced as of 1 April, and ordinary passports from 
the second half of the current [Iranian] year [beginning 21 
September]. He added: The diplomatic and service passports of 
the government employees serving abroad are valid until the end 
of the current year [ending 20 March 1995] and the government 
employees who have received visas from other countries and are 
still in Iran will be given new passports. 
  On the characteristics of the new passports, Mr. Mottaki 
said: The new passports are smaller than the old ones. They 
have been given special numbers, and certain chemical substances 
have been used to reduce the possibility of forging or misusing 
them to zero. 
  He stressed: In order to expand our consular cooperation and 
ties in a principled manner, we welcome the removal of visa 
restrictions with some countries.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Review of the First Week of the Year"] </F>
  [Text] Last week's celebrations of the Iranian new year 
coincided with some international events worth mentioning. 
  The world once again witnessed Israeli aggression against 
Palestinian freedom fighters and the innocent population of 
Southern Lebanon. Both Zionist actions were the result of the 
United Nations' foot dragging on the resolution condemning 
Israel for the al-Khalil massacre of the Palestinians last 
February. 
  Recent attacks on Lebanon and on the Palestinians once more 
prove that Israel, enjoying full support of the United States in 
the UN, will ignore any internationally accepted law it 
considers contrary to its own interests. This intransigent 
attitude towards UN resolutions should serve as a warning to 
those Arab states who currently entertain the idea of a real and 
genuine peace with the Zionist state. 
  Armenia, another regional trouble spot, was also in the news 
last week. A C-130 plane belonging to the Islamic Republic 
carrying Iranian diplomats and students coming home for the new 
year crashed in Armenian territory killing all 32 people on 
board. This tragedy deeply saddened our people especially 
considering IRI's recent mediating efforts in the Azeri-Armenian 
territorial dispute. 
  Iranian blood should not be spilled because of conflicts of 
its neighbors. Iranian-Armenian relations are based on 
centuries of coexistence and cultural exchanges between the two 
ancient peoples. It is incumbent upon the Armenian authorities 
to do whatever is necessary to regain the good will of the 
Iranian people and to continue the Iranian-initiated peace 
process with Azerbaijan if peace is really their ultimate 
objective. 
  Kashmir and the conduct of India's Border Security Forces 
(BSF) were also prominent in last week's news. A report by an 
Indian commission accused the BSF of having fired on Kashmiri 
Muslims killing at least 30 unarmed protesters without any 
provocation. The commission recommended the court-martial of 
several BSF members including two of its top officers. 
  India's swift and impartial actions regarding the renegade 
members of the BSF in Kashmir deserve international praise and 
we hope will serve as a model for other countries when faced 
with a similar situation. 
  The new year message of Iran's Revolutionary leader, 
Ayatollah Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i, emphasizing social discipline 
and work ethics in the everyday lives of the Muslim people began 
the year 1373 with a national spirit of hope, and motivated the 
Iranians to begin the new year with a resolution to work towards 
achieving the country's objectives of self-sufficiency and 
independence.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Who Was Responsible for the Crash of the C-130 </F>
Plane?"] 
  [Text] Iran's experts looking into the cause of the crash 
of the C-130 Hercules transport plane that killed 32 Iranians 
have not found the black box and are leaving Karabakh for 
Tbilisi and Baku where they hope to find clues from both 
airports' towers. The Iranian pilot had contacted both towers 
prior to the disaster. 
  This plane crash is still shrouded in mystery while Iranian 
officials are under increasing public pressure to identify those 
responsible for this atrocity which resulted in the martyrdom of 
32 innocent Iranians returning home for the New Year. Iranians 
are outraged at this savage terrorist act and demand cooperation 
of all parties concerned in efforts to identify the culprits and 
to bring them to justice. 
  The Armenians of Karabakh and the Azeris accuse each other 
of 
responsibility in this heinous crime against Iranian citizens. 
However, the evidence so far points to the Armenians as the most 
likely perpetrators of this cowardly act, therefore it is 
incumbent upon the Armenian authorities to prove otherwise. 
  The C-130 tragedy along with the rampant and pointless 
killings by both sides make it necessary to find a final and 
comprehensive solution to this destructive armed conflict. 
Despite political pressures from the Armenians and the Azeris 
and their respective supporters on the international level, 
Iran's mediating efforts so far have been based purely on the 
Islamic Republic's desire for peace in the region and its 
absolute impartiality in this dispute. 
  Iran believes that the ongoing Armenian-Azeri land dispute 
has sapped both countries' economic and political energies which 
will sooner or later result in the two countries' dependence on 
big foreign powers. 
  International organizations' slow pace in resolving such 
disputes make them ineffective in solving this particular 
crisis. Only the bilateral political resolve of Armenians and 
the Azeris together with the mediation of well intentioned 
regional countries could put an end to this senseless mass 
killing. 
  Both sides should also consider the fact that if such 
flagrant acts of terrorism continue, neighboring countries such 
as the Islamic Republic will have no choice but to react 
accordingly in order to protect their citizens.

Rally for Culture and Democracy, by Irina de Chikoff and 
Philippe Gelie; place and date not given: "Algeria: Said 
Sadi's Appeal for Resistance; According to the Democrats' 
Leader, `Algerian Society' Has Understood That It Has To Assume 
Responsibility Itself, Even for Security Issues" -- first six 
paragraphs are LE FIGARO introduction] 
  [Text] The president of the Movement for the Republic, a 
46-year old doctor and psychiatrist who is secretary general of 
the Rally for Culture and Democracy [RCD], has just launched an 
appeal for resistance in Algiers. 
  He was one of the few politicians present during the 22 
March 
demonstration in which more than 50,000 people, mainly women, 
marched through the streets of the capital to present a 
rejection front to the violence of the Islamic fundamentalists. 
He has never minced his words in talking about the violent 
collapse of the regime formed immediately after independence, of 
which fundamentalism is just a by-product. He condemns the 
government's relentless pursuit of the same policy despite all 
the evidence, namely advocating dialogue with the FIS [Islamic 
Salvation Front] leaders while repressing acts of terrorism. 
  Condemned by the armed Islamic groups, Said Sadi continues 
to 
live in Algeria. Forced to constantly move house and cover his 
tracks, he makes numerous speeches and attends numerous meetings 
throughout the country to rally around a single republican 
platform all those who are not yet resigned to the worst. 
  Born in a poor family in Aghriba near Tizi Ouzou -- his 
father was a road mender -- Said Sadi has always been an 
oppositionist. As a high school student he had a brush with 
prison. As a student, he was frequently in trouble with the 
authorities because he took part in cultural groups which 
escaped the control of the single party. Said Sadi became a 
doctor and is the driving force of Berber Spring. In 1980, he 
organized the first general strike in Kabylia against the 
dictatorship and appeared before the State Security Court. 
  Barely had he been released when he reoffended. In 1982 Said 
Sadi headed a semiclandestine publication. Between 1983 and 
1985, he worked on the creation of the Human Rights League. 
Brought before the courts once again, he was condemned to three 
years' imprisonment and remained in the Lambese prison. 
Pardoned in 1987, he did not give up. He was behind a new 
strike and called for the holding of a national assembly of the 
Amazigh cultural movement, which resulted in the creation of the 
RCD which, in the June 1990 municipal elections, won 87 communes 
whereas the fundamentalists won 900 city councils. 
  When Mohammed Boudiaf became president of the HCE (Higher 
State Committee), Said Sadi regained hope, but the head of state 
was assassinated six months after his return to Algeria in June 
1992. Disaster. Panic. The political class did nothing or 
emigrated. Said Sadi has not given up. He knows that his 
country is already at war. He chose his camp a long time ago -- 
that of resistance. He is organizing it. 
  [LE FIGARO] You have just launched an appeal for resistance. 
Do you think that Algeria is at war? 
  [Sadi] A civil war is being imposed on society and we must 
face it. One section of the nation is organizing the genocide 
of the other. I will mention just two examples: Outside a high 
school in the suburbs of Algiers, a 13-year old boy had his 
throat cut simply because his father is a policeman. A young 
woman who refused to wear the veil was shot in the head. 
Hitherto, the majority of Algerians felt that the defense of 
individuals and goods should be entrusted to the state. It must 
be admitted that this state is defective. We can no longer 
spend our time burying our dead. 
  [LE FIGARO] Does the 22 March demonstration in Algiers, 
which brought together 50,000 people, the majority of them 
women, mark a turning-point in the struggle against the FIS? 
  [Sadi] It is a turning-point for two reasons. First, this 
demonstration was organized by citizens' movements and 
associations of women who are among those most seriously 
threatened by radical Islamic fundamentalism. They are now 
taking up the fight. Second, this demonstration took place 
under the banner of resistance. The slogans clearly proclaimed 
the rejection of a fundamentalism which is the product of the 
existing system. Society has understood that it must assume 
responsibility itself, even for security issues. 
  [LE FIGARO] Are you planning armed resistance? 
  [Sadi] Without waiting for my appeal, armed groups have been 
formed, self-defense cells are emerging to resist 
fundamentalism. It was therefore necessary to react before 
control was lost. Just because you are a democrat, it does not 
mean that you are incapable of using a gun, but war is not the 
only way of bringing down this regime. 
  [LE FIGARO] What kind of action are you envisaging? 
  [Sadi] Demonstrations, especially in Kabylia on 20 April, 
repeated strikes throughout the country, a boycott of the 
schools which have become terrorist factories... The situation 
is deadlocked, but it will not continue to be for long. The 
word resistance has spread like a trail of gunpowder. 
  [LE FIGARO] Who will wage this struggle with you? 
  [Sadi] The priority is to channel all those who reject the 
Islamic fundamentalist plan. The trade unions, the 
associations, the political parties understand that they are all 
equally threatened. The issue goes beyond government-opposition 
splits. I know senior officials, officers, and diplomats who 
fully support our approach. Civilian society cannot accept 
being the hostage of the government and the Islamic 
fundamentalists. The match will be a three-sided one. 
  [LE FIGARO] Do you want to open up a "third path" between 
the FIS and the FLN [National Liberation Front]? 
  [Sadi] I reject the idea that the FIS and FLN represent two 
antagonistic options. The FIS is the FLN painted green. Most 
of its political cadres come from the FLN's inner circle. 
Islamic fundamentalism is a natural but radical variant of the 
FLN. 
  [LE FIGARO] Who is the main enemy? 
  [Sadi] We must first deal with the government, force it to 
step down and free the state from the clans. What does the FIS 
trade on other than the government's negligence and corruption? 
I am convinced that the Islamic fundamentalists would lose 
their credibility if the existing regime fell. 
  [LE FIGARO] How can it be forced to step down? 
  [Sadi] It is a struggle: These things cannot be requested, 
they must be seized. 
  [LE FIGARO] Surely you also have to be able to organize the 
resistance? 
  [Sadi] That is the whole problem. The majority of the 
population are disorientated, crushed by the weight of social 
problems. But thinking and active Algeria totally supports our 
idea for resistance and change. 
  [LE FIGARO] Is that Algeria not tempted by exile? 
  [Sadi] A race against time has started, between safeguarding 
the country and despair. I refuse to cast any stones at those 
leaving. 
  [LE FIGARO] Will you not help the FIS by first targeting the 
existing government? 
  [Sadi] It is a risk. The Islamic movement's ability to 
cause trouble is strong enough to take advantage of a power 
vacuum. The FIS is at war, it is trying to win it. The 
transfer of power must not be chaotic. 
  [LE FIGARO] Otherwise? 
  [Sadi] There are three possible scenarios. First, the 
collapse of the state. Algiers will not be Tehran but Kabul: 
We do not have the 2,000 ayatollahs or the 4,000 mullahs who 
could replace the state with a theocracy. Second, the country's 
collapse, because Algerian national consciousness is fairly 
recent. Third hypothesis on which we need to work: All the 
nation's vital forces say: "That is enough! This suicidal 
course of tolerating corruption in the heart of the government 
must be stopped!" 
  [LE FIGARO] President Zeroual has decided to open the 
dialogue to all political parties, including the FIS. What do 
you have to say to him? 
  [Sadi] I have four questions to put to him: First, do you 
believe it is possible to dissociate terrorism and 
fundamentalism? Second, how can you hope that the country will 
mobilize when you are haggling over the state in the visiting 
rooms of Blida prison with the Islamic fundamentalist leaders? 
Third, what form of Islam do you plan to uphold? Four, do you 
accept that a definitive lesson should be learned from the 
failure of the system to which you belong? 
  [LE FIGARO] Are you resolutely opposed to dialogue with 
the Islamic fundamentalists? 
  [Sadi] I am not opposed to it on principle but what kind of 
dialogue can you have through Kalashnikovs? For the time being, 
the dialogue is merely a relentless pursuit of the same policy 
despite the evidence. If it is to enable the clans to survive 
by plunder, we already know where that has led us. Dialogue is 
a means, not an end. 
  [LE FIGARO] Is there room for a moderate Islamic movement? 
  [Sadi] I have never believed in the idea of a moderate 
Islamic movement in Algeria. What we have is an Islamic 
movement born of frustration, it can only express itself through 
extremes. Ali Belhadj (one of the FIS leaders) is the real 
representative of Islamic fundamentalism in Algeria: He always 
represents outrage, extremes, and violence. He is the result of 
a social failure which could have led to the extreme Left it had 
been mature in 1970. 
  [LE FIGARO] So it is secular society against Islamic 
fundamentalism? 
  [Sadi] I do not think there is any alternative. Religion 
and politics must be separated. The regime claims to have found 
a middle way which does not exist. Even the established Islamic 
fundamentalists who tried to play that game have been 
disqualified by the armed groups. 
  [LE FIGARO] Does the FIS really enjoy popular support? 
  [Sadi] If that were the case, Algeria would already have 
toppled. It is perfectly possible to win back the FIS' social 
base. Many young people who demonstrated with us last week were 
in the streets with the FIS in 1991. It has constantly been 
said that the small traders form the Islamic fundamentalists' 
social base, but they closed their stores on 22 March. 
  [LE FIGARO] Why is Algeria deadlocked 30 years after 
independence? 
  [Sadi] The regime's clan-based and mafia-based organization 
prevented competition from emerging, efficiency has always been 
regarded as a luxury we could do without. A kind of mediocrity 
has been established at all levels. Algeria was rich. Some $12 
billion in aid was showered on us and we managed to gain a debt 
of $26 billion. 
  [LE FIGARO] Is the problem entirely political? 
  [Sadi] There is also a sociological division. More than 70 
percent of the Algerian population is less than 30 years old. I 
am 46: I have met with the seven or eight main political 
parties in the country; I was the youngest. Young people are 
going to extremes because they cannot identify with leaders who 
are constantly looking to the past. 
  [LE FIGARO] What is your generation doing to counter that? 
  [Sadi] What little has been achieved is thanks to my 
generation. But we are merely technical cooperation agents. 
Those who administer have never had power and those who have 
power have never administered. 
  [LE FIGARO] Do you expect any specific aid from France and 
Europe? 
  [Sadi] What is happening in Algeria does not just concern 
the Algerians. The aim is to uphold peace in the Mediterranean 
basin. If our allies, who share the values of democracy, do not 
support us, everybody will suffer. Tehran or Riyadh take their 
alliances for granted. France and Europe are swinging between 
compassion and rejection. They ought to stop their credit to 
the existing government: They are transfusing a corpse, turning 
the wheel of misfortune. It is a question of political ecology. 
  [LE FIGARO] Are you afraid of having to go into exile or 
underground? 
  [Sadi] Nothing can be ruled out. But the democracy of exile 
is not my style. I have to move house frequently, keep my 
schedule secret... I have already been forced underground to 
some extent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Libyan Salvation Front Discusses </F>
Convening Its National Assembly, Split"] 
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- The National Front for the 
Salvation of Libya [NFSL] has said that its permanent office 
held its third meeting in the current session 19 and 20 March, 
and that members from the Front's leadership committee 
participated in the meeting. 
  A statement issued by the front said that the office 
received 
"a message from the officers who participated in the last 
October uprising and managed to escape arrest." It pointed out 
that they stressed their loyalty to the front and its aims. 
  The statement added that "the permanent office discussed 
developments concerning the issue of those who split from the 
front. The office expressed its utmost regret over the haste of 
the brothers concerned in making such a decision and their 
failure to wait for the convening of the extraordinary national 
assembly meeting agreed by all parties at the permanent office's 
last meeting. At the same time the office would like to place 
on record for these brothers its thanks and gratitude for the 
efforts and sacrifices they have made in the service of the 
Libyan national cause with their fellow front members throughout 
these years (...). The office highly valued the way in which 
the leadership committee has handled this issue. The office 
also blessed the selection of Colonel Salih Muhammad al-Habbuni, 
member of the permanent office, as commander in chief of the 
Libyan National Army, the NFSL's armed forces, and Staff 
Lieutenant Colonel 'Abdallah Khalid al-Shaykhi as deputy 
commander in chief, wishing them both success in the new 
mission." 
  It went on: "The permanent office listened to the leadership 
committee's report on the radio retransmission of Voice of the 
Libyan People, Voice of the National Front for the Salvation of 
Libya. 
  "The office examined the report of the committee assigned to 
prepare for the national assembly meeting. It completed the 
drawing up of a program of action for the plan to convene the 
national assembly next summer, God willing. It made a number of 
organizational decisions and recommendations to redouble efforts 
to tackle developments and events on the struggle scene and to 
lead the front to the achievement of national struggle aims." 
  The NFSL issued another statement in which it said that it 
leadership committee held a routine meeting under Dr. Muhammad 
al-Muqariyf, the front's secretary general, at which it studied 
a number of questions concerning the general conditions of the 
national issue in the light of local, regional, and 
international changes. It also viewed the front's 
organizational conditions and the program of action. In 
addition to members of the leadership committee and the 
permanent office the meeting was attended by Col. al-Habbuni and 
Lt. Col. al-Shaykhi. 
  The statement pointed out that the committee devoted special 
interest to the decision to convene the national assembly for an 
extraordinary meeting. It stressed the importance of exerting 
efforts, making good preparations, and enabling all members of 
the front to contribute effectively to the preparatory work and 
select their representatives to the assembly. The committee 
made a number of decisions in this connection and urged all its 
members to contribute effectively to the work of the specialized 
committees formed by the permanent office.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Clarification on Libyan Opposition's </F>
London Meeting"] 
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- Clarifying a report published by 
AL-HAYAH last Wednesday on Libyan oppositionists' London 
meeting, Prince Muhammad al-Hasan al-Rida al-Sanusi has said: 
  1. We renew our respect for all Libyan opposition figures 
and groups and wish them success in ridding the country of its 
predicament. We also renew our willingness and desire to 
meeting with any figure or group to exchange views on the Libyan 
problem. We stress that we do not consider ourselves an 
opposition faction or organization. We belong to everyone, in 
accordance with the traditions of our al-Sanusi family, which 
has never sided with one group against another. 
  2. With regard to the meeting held in the London house of a 
figure known for his generosity and good reputation, we clarify 
that it was not a political meeting. It was an invitation to a 
lunch which witnessed general and unspecific discussions about 
Libyan issues, just like any other discussions one would expect 
at such meetings. No memorandum was written, nor were 
signatures on any initiative collected. 
  3. We have been surprised by what was published and 
circulated by Libyan brothers. We had organized the issues 
raised at the meeting. We would like to stress that we are not 
against any opportunity to discuss current political affairs, 
but we prefer that there be clear prior organization for the 
sake of the unity of all the nation's sons. 
  4. We do not wish to be a means for any plan or a tool for 
any quarter seeking to achieve personal or factional interests. 
And we assure everyone that we will respect the will of every 
person and quarter and will not interfere in the Libyan 
opposition's affairs.

  [Text] Tripoli, Al-Rabia'a [March] 29, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS 
AGENCY -- Abu-Musa [Colonel Sa'id Muragha], one of the leaders 
in the Palestinian national alliance applauded the Great 
Jamahiriyah's unwavering and brave stance vis a vis pan Arab 
issues -- particularly those concerning the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. 
  in an interview with today's issue of the AL-JAMAHIRIYAH 
newspaper, Abu-Musa said that their presence in the Great 
Jamahiriyah was due to their being a part of the process of 
struggle led by the Great Jamahiriyah, embodied in the 
leadership of Col. Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi. He said "our 
continuing contact with the Libyan leadership comes as part of 
the continuing dialogue, discussion and joint action in the 
service of essential pan Arab issues, most prominently, the 
Palestinian cause [no closing quote as received]. He said that 
the Great Jamahiriyah's stance was an historical where we devote 
ourselves in our conflict with the occupiers of this part of the 
Arab world [sentence as received]. 
  Abu-Musa said that the so-called Gaza-Jericho Accords 
consolidated the Israeli occupation of occupied Palestine and 
are a Western conspiracy directed against the Arab world. 
  He said that the Israelis had proposed a withdrawal from 
Gaza 
for years because they wanted to get rid of Gaza. They even 
asked Egypt to take Gaza because the Israelis wanted to get rid 
of it, a piece of land containing a powder keg of revolution 
which has caused great consternation for the Zionist entity. 
"It is impossible for us to consider Gaza as separate from the 
entire struggle. Gaza-Jericho is the result of a complete 
process of political activity which we can call an American 
conspiracy aimed at the Arab nation. [no closing quotation

  [Text] Cairo, 31 Mar (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid met today with French Ambassador to 
Cairo Patrick LeClercq, British Ambassador Christopher Long, and 
U.S. Charge d'Affaires David Hill. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid briefed the three envoys on the Arab 
League 
Council resolution from its recent meeting to support the Libyan 
stand in the Western-Libyan Lockerbie crisis and the Council's 
adoption of a proposal to try the two suspected Libyan nationals 
before the International Court of Justice in The Hague. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said after the meeting that Libya took a 
flexible stand when it agreed to the trial of its suspected 
citizens before a neutral body. He said that the proposal 
adopted by the Arab League Council at its recent meeting calls 
for the travel of a Scottish court and judges to The Hague 
because the U.S. plane crashed over the Scottish town of 
Lockerbie and the law to apply in such a case is that of the 
country where the incident happened. 
  The Arab League chief said that Scottish law is more 
flexible 
than English law, which only stipulates two outcomes of a trial: 
either guilty or not guilty. 
  He added that he proposed at the meeting to have the 
Security 
Council issue a resolution transferring the Scottish court to 
The Hague in order to begin the trial of the Libyans suspected 
of involvement in the Lockerbie case. 
  He stressed that Libya is responsive and eager not to 
escalate the Libyan-Western crisis since such an escalation will 
have grave consequences for Libya, the neighboring countries, 
the Mediterranean Sea countries, and even the European 
countries, which will not be happy with the imposition of an 
embargo on the export of Libyan oil.

  [Text] Cairo, 31 Mar (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid met today with Ibrahim al-Bishari, 
Libya's permanent representative to the Arab League. 
'Abd-al-Majid briefed al-Bishari on the outcome of his meeting 
today with the British and French ambassadors and the U.S. 
charge d'affairs in Cairo. 
  After the meeting, al-Bishari said 'Abd-al-Majid has a clear 
concept of Libya's crisis with the West. This concept is based 
on two points--safeguarding Libya's sovereignty and upholding 
international law. 
  Al-Bishari said the Arab League supports the stand of Libya, 
which does not seek to escalate the crisis so that its effects 
will not adversely affect the whole region. 
  Al-Bishari described the international blockade of his 
country as tantamount to "the illegal detention of a people 
inside a small country with limited capabilities and resources." 
He noted that it is in Libya's interest to solve the problem 
and not to enter into a showdown with three major states.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 31, IRNA -- Dispelling the doubt of 
various Kashmiri freedom struggle groups on the role Iran played 
in the events that led to the withdrawal of Pak-sponsored 
resolution on Kashmir at the recently concluded UN Human Rights 
Commission summit at Geneva, the Iranian ambassador to India, 
'Ali Reza Sheykh 'Attar [name as received], has said these have 
resulted from the lack of a "correct, deep and comprehensive 
information of events". The ambassador's interview, originally 
given to IRNA, New Delhi, has today appeared in leading 
newspapers of the valley. 
  On Iran's position on Kashmir, 'Attar says "his country 
believes in a lasting solution to the dispute fulfilling the 
aspiration of Kashmiri people". 
  'Attar dismisses the allegation that Iran took a pro-India 
stand in the interest of its commercial ties with that country 
as "misconceived". He states that "commercial ties with 
Pakistan are equally important to Iran. Moreover, Iran has 
never compromised its principles for its economic interests. 
Kashmiris are aware of this fact". 
  Cautioning the people of Kashmir of the West's designs, the 
ambassador warns: "These powers do not stand for the well-being 
of Muslims. Therefore, they should not be given any excuse to 
establish their foothold in the region". "The West's 
intervention has never been in the interests of Muslims. 
Palestine, Somalia and Bosnia bear testimony to this", adds the 
ambassador. 
  While holding the view that Iran's initiative at geneva 
proved "effective", the ambassador is quoted to have said "both 
India and Pakistan have appreciated it". The ambassador also 
says that the Iranian mediation came in the wake of the two 
countries' interest to sort out their differences over the 
resolution at the summit. 
  Reposing confidecne in growing political awareness among the 
people of Kashmir, 'Attar concludes that now "the case of 
resolving the Kashmir tangle through negotiations among all 
sides has become stronger".

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Apr (MENA)--Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris 
Buwayz has stressed that the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat 
Church was committed after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre to 
divert international attention away from the massacre. 
  In an interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM published today, 
the Lebanese foreign minister said that a number of people have 
been arrested for the church bombing. These people revealed 
that they has connections to Israeli officers and had obtained 
instructions, funds, and equipment that enabled them to assemble 
the explosive device, Buwayz added. 
  Buwayz maintained that it is not possible to terminate the 
resistance before obtaining assurances that south Lebanon will 
return to Lebanon because the resistance is not the reason for 
the Israeli occupation but a result of it. 
  Responding to a question on the Middle East market, the 
Lebanese foreign minister said: Any concept of future regional 
relations must be based on the dimensions of peace.

  [Text] Lebanese Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul has said 
that the bomb that exploded in the Sayyidat al-Najat Church and 
killed 11 people last month was made at the headquarters of the 
banned Lebanese Forces militia in the presence of Fu'ad Malik, 
senior aide to Samir Ja'ja'. 
  In an interview with MBC, Dallul said that he believes that 
the objective behind the explosion was to create sedition in the 
country. He added: 
  [Begin Dallul recording] The measures taken by the 
government 
were correct. From the security aspect, there was a coup 
attempt in every sense of the word, an attempt that served the 
Israeli enemy. There were attempts to undermine the homeland. 
What happened was very serious and it is up to the judiciary to 
decide on it. [end recording]

  The MENA version omits paragraphs 2 through 8. 
  Paragraph 13, second sentence reads: ...in promoting 
stability in the city, monitoring the situation there, and 
exerting efforts to restore... (changing "reporting" to 
"exerting" and supplying variant wording).

  [Text] Cairo, 31 Mar (MENA)--MENA has learned that the 
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators, headed by Dr. Nabil Sha'th 
and General Amnon Shahaq, have agreed on the immediate 
repatriation of 35 Palestinian deportees who belong to the Fatah 
Movement. In fact, agreement has been reached on the names of 
those who will return as part of confidence-building measures 
between the two sides. 
  Sources close to the negotiations noted that final agreement 
was also reached on reopening all PLO, Fatah, and other popular 
organizations' offices in the occupied territories, which were 
closed recently after the intifadah activities were stepped up. 
These offices were officially allowed to reopen once the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles was signed on 13 
September 1993. 
  The same sources clarified that measures to reopen these 
offices are being taken by the Israeli military ruler for all 
the occupied areas. 
  Moreover, sources close to the negotiations' delegations 
have 
affirmed that negotiations on autonomy in Gaza and Jericho will 
resume on Sunday in Cairo. 
  The sources said that all necessary measures will be taken 
to 
speed up these negotiations so that they will end in about one 
week, or ten days at the latest. These sources clarified that 
there are four different committees: The Economic Committee, 
which was meeting in Paris under the chairmanship of Israeli 
Finance Minister Avraham Shohat and Ahmad Quray', alias 
Abu-'Ala', head of the PLO Economic Department, will meet in 
Cairo with the rest of the committees. The other three 
committees are the Security Affairs Committee chaired by Dr. 
Nabil Sha'th and General Amnon Shahaq; the Civil Affairs 
Committee chaired by lawyer Jamil al-Tarifi and General Gadi 
Zohar, deputy director of civil administration in the West Bank; 
and the Autonomy Privileges Committee, which will set the final 
arrangements for the transfer of Palestinian authority in Gaza 
and Jericho. 
  The same sources clarified that concerted efforts are being 
exerted to end the negotiations within the coming week so that 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin can sign the final agreement no later than 12 
April 1994. 
  It is worth mentioning that the Palestinian and Israeli 
delegations actually started discussing the agenda of the 
remaining issues on implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
late last night.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with chief Palestinian negotiator Nabil </F>
Sha'th, in Cairo, by Sa'id Mu'addi, in the studio, on 1 April; 
from the "With The Midday Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Now that the agreement 
on the security arrangements in Hebron has been signed in Cairo, 
when will this agreement be implemented? 
  [Sha'th] As soon as possible. Fifteen minutes after the 
signing I was at the Norwegian Embassy [in Cairo] with the 
official request signed by us and the Israeli Government. I 
submitted the request to Mr. Larsen, adviser to the Norwegian 
foreign minister and head of the coordination office of the 
donating states, to prepare for the arrival of 160 observers 
from Norway, Denmark, and Italy as soon as possible. I believe 
Mr. Larsen will go to Hebron in the next few days. Also, the 
chief of the Norwegian international observers will arrive in 
Cairo on Sunday [3 April]. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil: Does this agreement mirror the 
provisions of Security Council Resolution 904? 
  [Sha'th] At least one of the two major paragraphs of the 
resolution is on international protection and the temporary 
international presence in Hebron. We reached this in accordance 
with Resolution 904. Very soon, 160 observers will be in Hebron 
to give its people a feeling of security. They will be present 
everywhere. They will have an open-door headquarters for the 
citizens of Hebron. I believe this will create a feeling of 
security. Israel took some measures and will take other 
measures to provide security and protection and to prevent 
settlers' violence in the city of Hebron. I believe we are 
seeking the implementation of the Security Council resolution, 
knowing that this resolution [as heard] was based on Security 
Council Resolution 904. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, the Palestinian side conceded its 
initial demand to send Palestinian police to Hebron. Why? 
  [Sha'th] The Security Council resolution, in fact, does not 
call for dispatching Palestinian police to Hebron. There was an 
idea to send Palestinian police to Hebron, and Israel agreed to 
this idea. However, we could not reach an agreement on the 
number, arms, and conditions, in accordance with which the entry 
of this Palestinian police force woyld help achieve the security 
of the Palestinians in Hebron. If we cannot achieve this, their 
presence will add nothing to this protection, but could create 
problems, particularly in the absence of a real participation in 
the political authority that will supervise the security power. 
Therefore, following lengthy discussion and despite Israel's 
agreement to 130 Palestinian police, we decided to double the 
international observers in this stage and to postpone the entry 
of Palestinian police until after [the implementation] of the 
Gaza-Jericho accord when the Palestinian police are deployed 
throughout all West Bank cities and when the Israeli forces are 
redeployed outside the Palestinians cities, villages, and camps 
in the West Bank. 
  [Mu'addi] Has an agreement been reached in Cairo on the 
return of longtime deportees? 
  [Sha'th] Yes. A group of deportees will return very soon. 
And the Palestinian police will enter Gaza and Jericho very 
soon. I believe that this police will begin to enter during the 
next week to receive military headquarters and garrisons and to 
take over police stations in Khan Yunus, Gaza, and Jericho... 
  [Mu'addi, interrupting] When will economic talks be resumed 
and what are the next steps in the coming week? 
  [Sha'th] I believe the talks will take place next week, 
together with the return of the Gaza-Jericho talks in all their 
security and civilian committees. This is in addition to the 
release of prisoners. Furthermore, the legal committee and the 
standing drafting committee will be formed. All these 
committees will work intensively during the coming two weeks in 
an attempt to reach a comprehensive agreement on issues related 
to Gaza-Jericho as soon as possible. This is what we did during 
the past two weeks, particularly during the past three weeks as 
we worked from 9 o'clock until 2 or 3 after midnight. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you very much. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you, brother.

<F P=106> [Interview with Faysal al-Husayni, chief adviser to the </F>
Palestinian negotiating team, by Fadi Isma'il on 31 March; place 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Husayni] First of all, I believe that if the 
measures that are taken do not include the evacuation of the 
settlers from Hebron they will not lead to a solution to this 
problem and the fuse will continue burning with the possibility 
of a real eruption. Hence, I believe that none of these 
measures will lead to a solution as long as the settlers stay in 
the heart of Hebron. 
  [Isma'il] There were some reports today that the Palestinian 
police will start to arrive in Gaza and Jericho early next week, 
before the anticipated Israeli withdrawal. Does this mean that 
agreement on the details of self-government is only a matter of 
time? 
  [Al-Husayni] If by the arrival of the Palestinian police you 
mean the arrival of some administrators to prepare for the 
arrival of the Palestinian police and if this is done before the 
complete Israeli withdrawal, then this might be reasonable. But 
if Palestinian policemen enter areas that are still under 
Israeli control, I believe it will not have positive results. 
What is needed is to have the Palestinian police enter the 
areas from which the Israeli forces withdraw and exercise full 
authority there. Otherwise, there will be new eruptions.

<F P=106> [Studio talk between anchorman 'Adi Talmor in Tel Aviv and </F>
correspondent Sefi Hendler in Cairo -- live] 
  [Text] [Talmor] The PLO and Israel signed an agreement on 
security arrangements for the Arab residents of Hebron a short 
while ago. This paves the way for the resumption of 
negotiations on Gaza-Jericho First. Our correspondent in Cairo 
Sefi Hendler attended the brief signing ceremony. Here is his 
report: 
  [Hendler] Good afternoon. After having become accustomed to 
the DOP -- the Declaration of Principles between Israel and the 
Palestinians -- we will now have to learn a new acronym, TIPH: 
Temporary International Presence in Hebron [acronym and 
preceding five words in English]. This is the name of the 
international force that will be composed of 160 soldiers from 
Norway, Denmark, and Italy. The agreement stipulates that these 
soldiers, who will have the status of civilian observers, will 
be permitted to carry personal handguns for self-defense 
purposes only. This force will deploy in Hebron for three 
months. If at the conclusion of this period, the Palestinians 
and Israelis are jointly interested in extending the observers' 
mandate, then this will be possible. The goals of the TIPH -- 
the international force to be deployed in Hebron -- are 
specified in the agreement, copies of which were handed out to 
correspondents a short time ago in Cairo. The goals are as 
follows: One, to give the Palestinians a sense of security. 
Two, to maintain stability in Hebron in order to guarantee the 
safety and wellbeing of local residents. Three, to supervise 
the efforts to restore the Palestinians' sense of security and 
to allow life to return to normal in Hebron. Four, to report on 
developments in Hebron to several bodies: first and foremost to 
a special Hebron committee which will be comprised of two 
representatives from each side, including the mayor of Hebron 
and the head of the Civil Administration in Hebron. The Hebron 
committee will report to a subcommittee which will be 
established within the framework of negotiations on the 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles. The United 
States and Russia, the cosponsors of the peace process, will 
also establish a committee that will be briefed by the 
multinational force deployed in Hebron. 
  The second part of today's agreement deals with the 
implementation of Gaza-Jericho First. It stipulates that the 
discussions on the implemention of Gaza-Jericho First will 
resume today. We understood that this constitutes a temporary, 
and not very significant piece of news which was only noted in 
order to prove that the negotiations on the implementation of 
Gaza-Jericho First would start today while the really practical 
discussions would begin next week, apparently in Cairo. The 
agreement also stipulates that the Israeli withdrawal from the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho will be accelerated and posits the early 
stationing of Palestinian policemen in the Gaza Strip by next 
week in order to give the Palestinians there a greater feeling 
of security and to further speed up the Israeli withdrawal. 
These are the details. The negotiations on Gaza-Jericho First 
will resume later today following the signing of the agreement 
on the security package in Hebron known as TIPH. This is the 
name of the international presence that will number 160 
personnel from Italy, Norway, and Denmark. 
  [Talmor] When will the negotiations on Gaza-Jericho First 
resume in a wider framework? 
  [Hendler] This is not mentioned in the agreement but we 
understand that this will take place next week, probably on 
Sunday or Monday [3 or 4 April] in Cairo.

<F P=106> [Article by Naji 'Allush, leader of the Arab Popular </F>
Liberation Movement: "Season for Questions About Yasir 'Arafat"] 
  [Text] This year, Arabs in general, and Palestinians in 
particular, are asking more and more questions about 'Arafat's 
identity. The questions involve his name, family, his true ties 
to Palestine, etc. 
  Why are these questions being raised now? Why weren't they 
asked on such a large scale when 'Arafat experienced a meteoric 
rise to fame against the backdrop of armed struggle? 
  These questions are definitely the result of skepticism. The 
"rebel" who sparked off armed resistance in 1965 is now a 
would-be "governor". The identity of a "rebel" lies in his 
rifle. A rebel can also lead others while he remains in caves 
and hideouts and walks the streets wearing a mask. However, a 
ruler cannot rule wearing a mask and cannot become a head of 
state without revealing his identity. 
  The Arabs of Palestine, just like all other Arabs, care a 
great deal about knowing people and their background, even if 
this means little to them. Faced with such questions, what will 
'Arafat do? 
  Press and radio reporters have tried to ask Yasir 'Arafat 
where he was born. He avoided their questions. Television 
reporters have persistently asked 'Arafat to tell viewers about 
Jerusalem, his birthplace, and about the playground of his 
childhood. He refused. When pressed, however, he said: "I was 
born in the al-Aqsa Mosque." A witty person commented: It seems 
Mr. 'Arafat does not know that the al-Aqsa Mosque has no 
hospital. Also, women do not usually give birth during prayer. 
  The "rebel" has turned into a would-be "governor". The 
people want to have an idea about their new ruler, who has now 
abandoned the assumed role of liberating rebel and agreed to 
supervise a process of liquidation. 
  What has 'Arafat got to tell those people? How will he reply 
to their persistent questions? He cannot now refuse to answer, 
as he did in the past on the pretext of security and secrecy. 
  He will say: My real name is Muhammad 'Abd-al-Ra'uf 
al-Qudwah. The majority will be surprised. 
  Where was your father born? Where did he die? Where was 
your grandfather born? Where did he die? 
  My father was was born in Cairo. He also died in Cairo. My 
grandfather died in Cairo. That is all. 
  Do you have a family home in Palestine? 
  No, we were not like all the other Palestinians who had a 
home and planted trees. Besides, Salah-al-Din did not have a 
house in Palestine. 
  How do you consider yourself a Palestinian according to the 
law of the Palestine National Council [PNC], when you do not 
have well-known Palestinian parents? Why did you deny Nayif 
Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, membership in the PNC because he does 
not have Palestinian parents, even though his father's 
birthplace is known? Hawatimah's birthplace is known. Hawatimah 
has been leading a Palestinian faction since 1968. Why did you 
foment a parochial Palestinian approach driving the people who 
advocated your leadership to consider Palestine an entity that 
differs from the rest of the Arab homeland; to say that the 
Palestinians descend from non-Arab Kanaanites; to say that 
Palestine, the West Bank and Gaza, should be a state; that..., 
that..., that..., and that the Palestinian identity should be 
asserted before the Arab identity, so that it can merge with the 
Zionist identity? 
  It is true that Salah-al-Din did not have a house in 
Palestine. However, he went to Palestine to liberate it and not 
to become a mayor under occupation. 
  The man who came to us from Egypt and who lived in Egypt, 
along with his father and grandfather, also does not bear 
Egyptian nationality. He would not tell us where he came from, 
how he became Palestinian, and why did he not become an 
Egyptian, like all others who lived in Egypt late last century. 
If we go to Jablah, we will find the roots of the al-Qassam 
family, who was martyred in Palestine in 1963. 
  If we go to Homs, we will find the roots of the family of 
Sa'id al-'As, who was martyred near Hebron in 1937. Where can 
we find the roots of the man who lives amongst us and plans to 
go back to Gaza-Jericho as a ruler under occupation? 
  The people asking this question will go to Jerusalem and 
Amman and will not find an answer because the experts in family 
trees and city and village dwellers know nothing about 'Arafat, 
nor about 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Qudwah. Bi'r Zayt Mayor Tawfiq 
Ibrahim al-Kaylah asked me in 1978 in Baghdad: Do you know 
where Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] comes from? I replied: Why? 
He said: We, the mayors of the West Bank and Gaza, got 
together and none of us knew anything about 'Arafat, his father, 
grandfather, or house. I told him: You will not find anything 
of this, because his father and grandfather were nor born in 
Palestine, nor lived there. His father visited Jerusalem in the 
1920's and married a woman from Jerusalem, and this is the 
secret of 'Arafat's affinity with Palestine, as people in the 
know say. 'Arafat has led the Palestinians to Gaza-Jericho 
after wresting leadership in the name of armed struggle and full 
liberation. He reduced this liberation into a state, then into 
representation, and then into Gaza-Jericho. No one knows where 
he will end up. 
  The Palestinians, together with the Arab masses, should 
ask: How did this change happen? In whose interest is it? Why 
did the factions fail to know the person who was leading them 
and the PLO since 1968, in accordance with his program, until we 
reached the Gaza-Jericho accord? As it has become necessary now 
to know the person who will become a ruler, it is necessary to 
know his program well before he, together with his followers, 
become the authority that liquidates the cause and turns the 
Palestinian municipal system into an alternative to liberation 
and the cause. However, why are these questions raised now? 
  We believe there are many reasons, and the most prominent 
are 
the following: 
  First: The Gaza-Jericho accord prompted people to ask: Where 
did the man who agreed to something that was never previously 
accepted by any Palestinian leadership come from? Who is this 
person, who carried the gun in the name of liberation, to lead 
his supporters and opponents to the liquidation of the cause? 
  Second: 'Arafat's competitors from the West Bank and Gaza, 
who exploited his move toward the settlement, are working to 
replace him now that he has played the role they could not play. 
They are the alternatives who want to rule. Therefore, sons of 
famous families, who agreed to play a limited role under the 
power of resistance, are now trying to show that their origins 
are more deeply rooted than those of the president. 
  Third: Many people want to know the personality of the 
coming 
ruler, because the identity of this ruler is not known like that 
of Faysal al-Husayni, Sirri Nusaybah, Hanan 'Ashrawi, and 
others. This makes people ask many questions. 
  Fourth: His aides, who agreed to play secondary roles in the 
past, now want to play greater roles, to have positions in the 
future. Those people are encouraged by Arab and foreign 
quarters that seek to implement the Gaza-Jericho accord in 
accordance with the set plans. What will 'Arafat say in 
response to questions about his identity? What will he answer 
regarding his program, which was exposed by the Gaza-Jericho 
accord? 
  The secret is in the official quarters in Cairo that sent 
'Arafat to become the chairman of the PLO instead of al-Shuqayri 
[former PLO chairman], that has taken care of him throughout all 
these years, which sent him to Gaza-Jericho, and which is still 
planning for him and looking after his march. 
  However, the answers to the questions might come from Tel 
Aviv and Washington, or from any other place. 'Arafat, who does 
not know the Palestinian people, will face many difficulties. 
The first: How can he govern while his identity and program are 
still unknown, although he led the resistance with an unknown 
identity and program? Resistance is one thing, governing is 
something else. The secret, however, will become more ambiguous 
if the ruler leaves before stepping on the land of Palestine, 
when other well-known leaders appear. 
  The bitter fact, however, will remain, whether or not the 
man 
stays, and whether or not the secret is revealed. How did 
'Arafat lead committees, councils, and masses that did not know 
him? How was he able all this time to hide the reality of his 
program, which is more important than his identity and origin? 
We admit he is smart and others are naive, although the man was 
exposed by his personality and acts, although his course was not 
revolutionary, his experience not that of a leader, his bravery 
not real, and although he did not enjoy any of the skills that 
qualify him to be a leader. All this was known by all those who 
dealt with him inside and outside the PLO. What is not known 
about him was not hidden from those who wanted to know and who 
refused to place their fate in the hands of unknown persons. 
  Despite all this, some factions supported him while others 
opposed him in a way that strengthened his position. The whole 
Arab order supported him. Although the Arab order differed with 
him, it wanted him to stay and to expeditiously impose his full 
authority over the Palestinians. Now that he has led the 
resistance, the PLO, and the Palestinians to the Gaza-Jericho 
accord, his identity and program must be known so that despair 
will make people see no other savior except him. [as published] 
  As people such as 'Adnan al-Yasin [Palestinian security 
official arrested in Tunis for collaboration with the Mosad] 
have been exposed, other people will be exposed in the coming 
days, months, and years. 
  In brief, 'Arafat has hidden behind the liberation program 
in 
order to hide his identity and his program, in order to lead the 
Palestine question to its present situation. He has 
strengthened and protected himself by the capitulation of the 
Arab order and by American arrogance. Now that he has revealed 
his program, he does not care if his identity is revealed as 
long as he is protected by the force of the international order.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "The Bases of the Resumption of 
the Peace Process," AL-BA'TH says: Since the convocation of the 
Madrid conference, Israel has been involved in feverish attempts 
to circumvent the peace process, render it void of any content, 
and divert it from its main target, which is a just, 
comprehensive peace. 
  The paper continues: However, those Israeli efforts ended in 
total failure because of Syria's adherence to a firm pan-Arab 
position insisting on the basic principles of the peace process, 
particularly the relevant UN resolutions, the land-for-peace 
formula, and rejection of any relinquishment of any Arab rights. 
  Stressing the need for Arab coordination, cooperation, and 
integration regarding the peace process, the paper warns against 
separate deals and their results, which obstruct the peace 
process and lead it into a maze that gives Israel a chance to 
undermine the Palestine question and achieve gains at the 
expense of the Arab nation's cause, interests, and pan-Arab 
security. 
  Concluding, AL-BA'TH stresses that any resumption of the 
peace talks requires the United States, as the sponsor of the 
peace process, to play the role that it is supposed to play to 
make that process successful and lead it to its desired 
objectives. 
  Under the headline "The Evil Plans," TISHRIN says: It has 
been revealed that Israel had a role in the explosions which 
took place in Lebanon and which targeted houses of worship and 
cultural, party, and political institutions. Lebanese sources 
have declared that Israel planned and financed these operations 
and supplied all the requirements of implementation. By such 
actions, the Rabin government sought to sabotage Lebanon's 
accord process, return the country to the furnace of the 
sectarian civil war, undermine its national awareness, and 
revive sectarian plans and infighting. Thus, it has been 
categorically proved that the present Israeli government has 
changed nothing in the hostile view toward Lebanon, and that 
like its predecessors, this government seeks to partition 
Lebanon and to see it again immersed in bloodshed and 
destruction. 
  The paper stresses that Israel is still the main threat to 
all Lebanese and that it still covets their land and 
possessions. The paper indicates that Israel's plots against 
the Lebanese are endless, and that Israel will continue its 
occupation of southern Lebanon to strike at any signs of 
relaxation and reconstruction in Lebanon and to inflame 
sectarian and religious infighting in it. 
  The paper says that despite the weakness of UN Security 
Council Resolution 904 condemning the Hebron massacre and 
demanding specific measures to protect the Palestinians, the 
Israeli Government seeks to circumvent this resolution and make 
it devoid of any content. This proves again that the Rabin 
government does not intend to comply with international 
resolutions, especially the ones demanding withdrawal from the 
occupied territories and recognition of the Palestinian rights, 
the paper notes. The paper declares: Israel absolutely refuses 
to give up settlement building and settlements, and it does not 
intend to accept the land-for-peace formula. Israel's role in 
southern Sudan, including sending weapons to rebels, has also 
been exposed. This proves that Israel wants neither welfare nor 
stability for the Arabs. The paper stresses that wherever there 
is tension in any Arab country, there must be Israeli fingers 
and weapons. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: What we have said clearly shows 
that Israel never considers peace with the Arabs and real 
coexistence with them. Rather, it raises slogans of peace to 
deceive and mislead Arab public opinion and conceal Zionism's 
aggressive and expansionist objectives.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Lebanon and the Israeli Traps," 
the newspaper TISHRIN today writes on Israel's continuous 
attempts to exacerbate the situation in Lebanon. 
  TISHRIN says: The Lebanese judiciary investigations have 
revealed that Israel was the party responsible for planning the 
Sayyidat al-Najat Church massacre with the objective of covering 
its continuous crimes and brutal massacres in the occupied Arab 
territories, particularly the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
  TISHRIN touches on Israel's attempts to restore its 
subversive and conspiratorial role in Lebanon by moving the 
remnants of its agents to infiltrate into the Lebanese arena and 
to storm the march of security and accord. 
  TISHRIN says: The Lebanon of today is not that of yesterday, 
when Israel used to wreak havoc in it, and when Israel used to 
believe that by moving its tools in Lebanon, it could guarantee 
its free presence in southern Lebanon, dictate its conditions, 
and evade the peace requirements and the implementation of UN 
Security Council Resolution No. 425, which calls for a full 
[Israeli] withdrawal from southern Lebanon. 
  TISHRIN says: Through its attempts to ignite the situation 
in Lebanon, Israel has proven anew that it does not at all like 
seeing Lebanon enjoying security and stability. When it plans 
to strike at the march of accord in Lebanon by perpetrating 
crimes and carrying out aggressions against Lebanese territory, 
Israel clearly shows that it is completely hostile to peace and 
stability in the region, and that it only seeks to achieve its 
hostile and expansionist objectives and to continue its 
occupation of southern Lebanon and the other Arab territories. 
  TISHRIN adds: This is clearly shown by the fact that the 
occupation troops are in a continuous state of alert in southern 
Lebanon, and by Israel's ceaseless threats to Lebanon to expand 
aggressions on its territory, perpetrate massacres against its 
citizens, and endanger its sovereignty. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: Undoubtedly, the Lebanese 
government's determination to impose the supremacy of law on all 
sides was received with satisfaction and positive response by 
the sons of the Lebanese people, especially since attempts to 
involve Lebanon in crimes and bloodshed have been checked once 
and for all, and since it has become clear that Lebanon, which 
confronted and foiled previous Israeli challenges and plots 
resolutely and strongly, is now able to resume the march of 
security and peace and to strengthen its internal front. 
Lebanon will not go back on its plans to achieve accord, and 
the Lebanese people will not allow its enemies, the Israelis, 
its agents, or the remnants of militias, to disrupt its 
stability or to undermine its national and pan-Arab aspirations.

  [Text] Brothers, we have just received the following news 
item: A PLO official spokesman has made the following statement: 
  The agreement reached in Cairo on the international presence 
in Hebron represent a starting point on the path of the 
implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 904, and 
other effective measures that provide security for our 
Palestinian people in Hebron and in other occupied Palestinian 
regions. They also deal with the issue of the armed and 
extremists settlers in Hebron and other parts of the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip; the need to put an end to their terrorist 
activity, their carrying of weapons and other problems, as was 
stipulated by UN Security Council Resolution 904. These 
measures represent fundamental elements to guarantee the 
security of the Palestinian people and provide an effective 
international protection in our Palestinian land for our people, 
its territories and sanctities. 
  While the PLO welcomes the participation of a number of 
friendly states in the international forces, and their friendly 
units, it would like to stress that our people will contribute 
toward the facilitation of their mission. The PLO calls on the 
government of Israel to provide all the necessary conditions 
that will help these forces carry out their duties according to 
the appropriate agreement; and help implement the Declaration of 
Principles agreement and the UN Security Council Resolution, 
which defines the role of these international forces. 
  The PLO will continue its efforts to guarantee the 
implementation of all the provisions regarding security and 
protection for our people, and the removal of all terrorist and 
settlement hotbeds, and the implementation of the Declaration of 
Principle Agreement to secure the entrance of the the 
Palestinian forces to the Palestinian land as soon as possible, 
and to establish and set up the first Palestinian authority in 
this Palestinian land, raise the Palestinian flag, and 
consecrate the Palestinian presence.

says that this decision by the Russian leadership has been 
emphasized in a letter conveyed by the Russian ambassador in 
Tunis to brother President Abu-'Ammar. 
  Meanwhile, President Abu-'Ammar has asked France to help 
provide an international protection for the Palestinian citizens 
in the occupied territories.

  [Text] An official spokesman for the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] has stated the 
following: 
  More than 40 days have passed since the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre. Press statements and angry announcements have been 
made and threats issued to stop the negotiations unless the 
Zionist enemy submits to the demands of the so-called 
Palestinian negotiating delegation and its leadership. There 
was also a period of stalling, procrastination, and threats to 
use the veto. Yet all this, including the PLO leadership in 
Tunis and Resolution No. 904, only affirmed one unchanging fact; 
namely, that Palestinian blood was exploited in the auctions and 
markets of [the Middle East] settlement both in Washington and 
the Camp David capital to orchestrate the political process. 
'Arafat never fails to provide evidence of his direct and 
indirect involvement in underrating the blood of our Palestinian 
people, coordinating his positions with those who want from the 
settlement the liquidation of our cause and to conspire against 
our people and their objectives. 
  'Arafat's most recent Cairo accord--calling for deploying a 
multinational force--confirms the anticipated results of the 
maneuvers of this treasonous leadership that had issued 
deceptive statements on the status of the Hebron settlers, 
raised the prospect of suspending the talks unless they were 
evicted, and then demanded that the future of Jerusalem and the 
settlements be put on the agenda before the expiration of the 
first phase of self-rule. 
  However, the latest Cairo accord is evidence of how lightly 
our people are being taken, along with their memory and 
principles. We in the PFLP-GC view this accord as a transparent 
attempt to betray the blood of the Hebron massacre martyrs and 
our people's cause. We ask whether a token force made up of 
only dozens of blue helmets and operating under a limited 
timeframe and the control of the enemy and the Hebron town 
council can provide our people with real protection in the face 
of the terror of the settlers and the enemy military. 
  This accord reinforces the settlements and runs counter to 
the fiery statements made by 'Arafat in the aftermath of the 
massacre. The token international force is just another false 
witness. 
  The PFLP-GC's official spokesman adds: In the latest Cairo 
accord, 'Arafat brushed aside the Arab refusal to return to the 
negotiating table while the Zionist terror persists. In the 
final analysis, the return to the negotiations accommodates a 
U.S.-Zionist decision and shows 'Arafat cannot wait to complete 
the self-rule conspiracy. Talk about deploying a 'Arafatist 
police force by mid-April within the framework of self-rule 
arrangements is like throwing sand in ones eyes and a prelude to 
civil war being programmed by the parties to the conspiracy and 
executed by 'Arafat and his lieutenants. 
  The spokesman concludes: We have absolute faith in our 
people's awareness and capacity to thwart what is being hatched 
against them. Our people's will and their mujahidin are sure to 
thwart all the maneuvers, whose authors will reap only disgrace. 
Revolution until the liberation of land and man.

  [Text] The Palestinian opposition has condemned the 
PLO-Israeli agreement on Hebron security and asked the 
Palestinian police force, which will be deployed in the 
autonomous region, not to thwart attacks aimed at the Israeli 
occupation. 
  The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] 
has denounced what it called the observers deal in Hebron and 
regarding it as an ineffectual deal confined to the presence of 
a limited number of European observers with no security powers 
and without any deterrent measures against the settlers and 
settlements. It also considered this a new concession in the 
'Arafat leadership's long line of concessions under the pressure 
and blackmail of the United States and Israel. 
  Those who speak on behalf of the ten Palestinian factions 
opposed to the Oslo agreement say that the measures which have 
been agreed on in Hebron will not prevent new massacres of 
Palestinians. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the 
Islamic Jihad Organization, says that yesterday's agreement in 
Cairo does not ensure for the Palestinians a minimum level of 
security and the international presence is useless because the 
international observers will not play the role of policemen. He 
said the Islamic Jihad will continue against the Zionists in all 
parts of occupied Palestine and asked the Palestinian police 
personnel not to hinder his organization's operations against 
the Israeli enemy, as he put it.

  [Excerpts] Dawud Talhami, the spokesman of the Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine has described the 
agreement on Hebron security as a submission to Israel's stands 
and terms. The agreement did not tackle the presence of 
settlers in Hebron, maintained the Qiryat Arba' settlement, and 
has not put an end to settler terrorism, he added. The new 
agreement watered down the international protection and confined 
it to 160 observers, Talhami said. 
  The signing of the agreement on the international presence 
in 
Hebron will allow the resumption of the autonomy negotiations 
next Monday [4 April], according to PLO ambassador to Jordan, 
al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, who announced that the first units of 
the Palestinian force will begin deployment in Gaza and Jericho 
the next day and will complete deployment on 13 April. As for 
the Israeli forces, they will redeploy in these areas. Our 
correspondent Basim Abu- Sumayyah informs us of the general 
conditions in the occupied Palestinian territories: 
  [Begin recording] Israeli military officials have said the 
Israeli Army is prepared to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho and 
redeploy within 72 hours of receiving orders. [passage omitted] 
Former Hebron Mayor Mustafa al-Natshah, who is expected to 
return to his post shortly, has welcomed the deployment of the 
international forces in the town, regarding it as a good step if 
the members of this force are capable of providing genuine 
protection for the Palestinians. He emphasized the need to 
disarm and evacuate the settlers to provide security and 
stability for the Palestinians. 
  On the other hand, supporters of the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] have rejected the agreement, 
which fails to provide genuine protection for the Palestinian 
people. 'Abd-al-'Alim Da'nah said that what is required is an 
opportunity for a just peace and not reaching a truce between 
the victim and the perpetrator. 
  Islamic law judge al-Shaykh Tayseer al-Tamimi expressed fear 
that the deployment of the international force will help 
consecrate the partition of the town which was imposed by the 
Israeli forces. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Hebron, Occupied West Bank, March 31 (AFP) -- 
Palestinian leaders here welcomed the imminent arrival of 
international observers under Thursday's [31 March] Israel-PLO 
security accord, but urged more steps to protect Palestinians. 
  Former Palestinian mayor Mustafa al-Natshah told AFP: "The 
population in Hebron will only be safe when the 30 families of 
Jewish settlers situated in the heart of Hebron are evacuated." 
  Some 400 settlers live scattered through the town of 120,000 
people. 
  Al-Natshah added he was "satisfied" that 160 lightly-armed 
observers from Norway, Denmark and Italy were to be sent to the 
town under a deal signed Thursday in Cairo. 
  It is the first time that Israel has agreed to the 
deployment 
of an international force in territories under its control. 
  The PLO demanded protection for Palestinians living in 
Hebron 
after a Jewish settler killed 30 Arab worshippers in a mosque 
here as a condition for returning to talks on launching 
self-rule. 
  But leaders of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine (DFLP) said in Damascus the agreement would not ensure 
the safety of Palestinians in Hebron. 
  The two dissident factions are opposed to the Middle East 
peace process. 
  PFLP deputy leader Abu-'Ali Mustafa said Palestinian 
security 
would be "impossible without the dismantlement of the 
settlements." 
  DFLP spokesman Dawud Talhami said settlers would still 
"continue to carry out massacres. 
  "The 160 international observers will not be able to react 
seriously in face of the deployment of thousands of Israeli 
soldiers," he added. 
  The president of Hebron university's graduate association 
Ahmad Tamimi said the agreement was "a step forward", but added 
Palestinians would never "know stability and security until the 
settlers have left." 
  The deal reached between Israeli and PLO negotiators called 
for the observers to be deployed immediately in Hebron. It 
paved the way for an immediate resumption of autonomy talks on 
Thursday, suspended for almost five weeks since the February 25 
massacre. 
  A PLO spokesman in Tunis said the accord was "a first step 
in 
applying (UN) Security Council Resolution 904." 
  The resolution adopted on March 18 condemned the massacre 
and 
called for international protection for the Palestinians in the 
occupied territories. 
  But the spokesman urged extra measures "to guarantee an 
effective international protection for the Palestinian people, 
its land and its holy sites."

  [Text] QUDS PRESS--A senior official of the Palestinian 
organization Hamas, which opposes peace negotiations with 
Israel, has said that Libya has promised the Alliance of 
Palestinian Forces [APF] financial and political aid for the 
liberation of Palestine. 
  Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for Hamas, the biggest 
faction within the APF, said that a delegation of all the 
leaders from the opposition factions recently returned from an 
official visit to the Libyan capital Tripoli. He added that 
this is the first visit of its kind. 
  In a statement to QUDS PRESS, Ghawshah said that the leaders 
of the alliance visited Libya at the invitation of Libyan 
President Mu'ammar Qadhdhafi. He noted that the delegation 
included George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP]; Colonel Muhammad Musa, 
alias Abu-Musa, secretary of the central committee of the 
Palestine National Liberation Movement, Fatah-The Uprising; Dr. 
Fathi al-Shaqaqi, leader of the Islamic Jihad Movement; Talal 
Naji, assistant secretary general of the PFLP-General Command; 
'Arabi 'Awwad, secretary general of the Revolutionary Communist 
Party; Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP]; 'Isam al-Qadi 
[secretary general of the Popular Liberation War Vanguards 
Organization-Al-Sa'iqah]; Abu-Nidal al-Ashqar [member of the 
Palestine Liberation Front Political Bureau]; Khalid 
'Abd-al-Majid [secretary general of the splinter group 
Palestinian Popular Struggle Front]; in addition to Ghawshah 
himself and Khalid Mash'al from Hamas. 
  The spokesman said that the delegation held a two-hour 
meeting with leader Qadhdhafi in Surt. The delegation demanded 
that al-Qadhdhafi support the intifadah and the mujahidin and 
work on stopping attempts of normalization with the Zionist 
enemy, as he said he would. The Palestinian official said that 
last Saturday, the delegation met with Colonel Abu-Bakr Yunus, 
the Libyan Chief of Staff and member of the ruling Revolution 
Command Council. 
  Ghawshah described the visit as useful and fruitful. He 
said: It is a gain in itself to exchange views and agree on 
common denominators dealing with Arab and official interests. 
He noted that Libya promised to offer more moral and financial 
support for the liberation of Palestine. He added that he 
expects the APF leadership to visit Iran on a date that has not 
yet been fixed.

  [Text] PLO leader 'Arafat has appointed Mustafa al-Natshah 
as mayor of Hebron effective 4 April. Al-Natshah was voted into 
office as mayor of Hebron in 1983, but was prevented by Israeli 
authorities from carrying out his duties because of allegations 
that he encouraged attacks against settlers. Two years ago, 
al-Natshah served as a negotiator at the Washington peace talks 
with Israel. 
  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] says it opposes the 
appointment, and if al-Natshah accepts, he will be assassinated.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Wlodek </F>
Goldkorn and Dina Nascetti in Tunis; date not given: "We Will 
Live With the Jews. I Swear It" -- first paragraph is 
L'ESPRESSO introduction] 
  [Text] "I so much wish that Yitzhaq Rabin had the courage 
of Charles De Gaulle: Like Rabin, he was a general, he was the 
leader of a state, but he had the courage to withdraw France's 
troops from Algeria." This was said by PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat. The modest house that is his headquarters in Tunis is 
receiving a constant stream of visits by delegations at present. 
Deputy Chief of Staff of the Israeli Army Amnon Shahaq; 
Clinton's Middle East envoy, Dennis Ross; his Russian 
counterpart, Viktor Possuvalik; and the Norwegian mediators -- 
all of them discussing the resumption of negotiations between 
the PLO and Israel, suspended following the massacre in the 
Hebron mosque five weeks ago. The Palestinian leader found time 
to grant the following exclusive interview to L'ESPRESSO: 
  [L'ESPRESSO] Mr. Chairman, the UN Security Council issued a 
very sharp criticism of Israel for what happened at Hebron. 
Does that resolution constitute a basis for a resumption of 
negotiations? 
  ['Arafat] It was an important step. Not only because of the 
criticism itself but, rather, because the resolution indicates 
specific measures to be adopted with respect to the armed 
Israeli settlers and recommends the presence of international 
observers in the occupied territories. Last, I would like to 
stress that the Security Council resolution talks about the 
responsibility of the sponsors of the Madrid conference for 
implementing the aforementioned measures. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] One of the sponsors of the Madrid conference, 
together with the United States, is Russia. Are you pleased 
that Russian diplomacy has returned to the Middle East scene? 
  ['Arafat] Look, we went to the Madrid peace conference in 
October 1991 precisely because it was called by two major powers 
-- the Soviet Union and the United States. Subsequently, 
Russia, heir to the USSR, was a joint-signatory of the 
Declaration of Principles signed in Washington 13 September 1993 
by Israel and the PLO. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] But because of its domestic problems, Russia 
has 
been out of international politics for months and months... 
  ['Arafat] That is not true. Russia has played a crucial role 
in Bosnia. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] But not in the Middle East. 
  ['Arafat] That is not true either. The Russians have played 
a most important role in the Middle East from the start of the 
peace process. And they have never abandoned it. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] The U.S. Government does not look favorably on 
Russia's return to the Middle Eastern scene. 
  ['Arafat] I see no evidence of that. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] Do you see any evidence of the Vatican's having 
mobilized its diplomacy since the events at Hebron and the 
breaking off of the negotiations? 
  ['Arafat] Of course, I confirm it. In any case, I am in 
constant contact with the Vatican -- so much so that we have 
established a standing joint committee between the PLO and the 
Vatican. Furthermore, while Israeli Prime Minister Rabin was in 
Rome to meet with the pope, I received Monsignor Touran, the 
Vatican's foreign minister. We have always appreciated the 
Vatican's role and the pope's work in the Middle East. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] Do you discuss the future of Jerusalem with the 
Vatican, too? 
  ['Arafat] Yes, of course. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] And what solution do you suggest for that city? 
  ['Arafat] Jerusalem must become the capital of two states -- 
Palestine and Israel. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] The Israelis say that a city cannot have this 
dual role. 
  ['Arafat] Why not? Is Rome not the capital of two states? 
  [L'ESPRESSO] Mr. Chairman, you were expected in Jericho at 
the end of last December... 
  ['Arafat] I am not here because I want it but because of 
Prime Minister Rabin's fault. It is he that has always 
postponed the implementation of the Declaration of Principles 
signed in Washington 13 September. It was he who repeated that 
there are no sacrosanct deadlines to be observed. Rabin 
promised Egyptian President Mubarak that we would meet in Cairo 
about 10 days after the ceremony and handshake in Washington to 
give an immediate go-ahead to the agreements signed. But 
nothing has been implemented yet. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] Do you feel that you have been duped? 
  ['Arafat] No. I think that playing for time and constant 
postponements are part of the Israelis' mentality. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] What would you say to Rabin if you were to meet 
with him tomorrow? 
  ['Arafat] I would remind him that Menahem Begin, the former 
prime minister and leader of the right, the one who waged the 
war in Lebanon, implemented the agreements with Egypt extremely 
strictly and precisely, including the dismantling of the Jewish 
settlement in Sinai. 
  Rabin once said: "I will make 'Arafat sweat" -- for both the 
body and the mind. People pay to go to the sauna. And I will 
make Rabin sweat, too. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] Mr. Chairman, does Israel really want peace? 
  ['Arafat] Ask them. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] What do you think? 
  ['Arafat] They are raising both formal and substantive 
obstacles. I repeat: They are playing for time. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] But Rabin has major problems within his own 
country. And we know from a reliable source that the Israeli 
prime minister is waiting for a goodwill gesture from you... 
  ['Arafat] What? Rabin dares to request a generous gesture 
from me, his victim? It is we who are entitled to demand a 
courageous gesture -- and soon. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] Of what kind? 
  ['Arafat] To guarantee my people's safety. Look at what 
happened in Hebron between Tuesday 22 and Wednesday 23 March. 
The city was actually under siege. They used missiles. And 
still Rabin expects a gesture from me? 
  [L'ESPRESSO] What concrete measures do you expect from 
Israel, in Hebron? 
  ['Arafat] To bring in international observers. Also, to 
implement the Security Council resolution that envisages the 
disarmament of the settlers. Furthermore, there must be a 
Palestinian police force in the city of the patriarchs. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] But Rabin says that your police must be under 
Israeli command, since there is only one sovereignty and only 
one authority. 
  ['Arafat] Look, according to the Washington declaration, two 
sovereignties, two authorities, and two responsibilities are 
envisaged in the occupied territories. Where there are Israeli 
citizens, the responsibility for their safety lies with the 
Israeli state. And where there are Palestinians, the 
responsibility is ours. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] But will the Palestinian police in Hebron 
protect the settlers too? 
  ['Arafat] If they are in transit, of course, like any 
self-respecting police force. But I do not see why the settlers 
should continue to live in the heart of the city, in our homes. 
Let them go to Qiryat Arba'. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] Mr. Chairman, does that mean that you want the 
settlers simply to be transferred to the settlement overlooking 
the city, not sent back to Israel? 
  ['Arafat] At this stage, yes. We will discuss their return 
to Israel in the negotiations. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] The tragic events in Hebron have split Israeli 
public opinion. Shim'on Peres even described the fanatic 
settlers as "Nazis." What did it feel like to hear an Israeli 
minister talking like that about other Jews? 
  ['Arafat] It was certainly a very courageous act. In any 
case, I appreciate Peres, and I think I can say that an 
atmosphere of understanding has been created between us. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] Did you know that Peres recently described you 
as "a real leader"? 
  ['Arafat] Really? Why? 
  [L'ESPRESSO] According to Peres, a real leader knows how to 
lead his people to peace, not to war, even when his people no 
longer have confidence in peace. 
  ['Arafat] Look, after the Hebron massacre, after months when 
no progress was made in the peace process, my people really did 
lose confidence in the outcome of the negotiations. But I will 
not give in, despite all the enemies of peace. And do you know 
why? 
  [L'ESPRESSO] Tell us. 
  ['Arafat] Because the essence of leadership is to have a 
vision and a blueprint for the future. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] THE INDEPENDENT wrote recently that when you 
went to Damascus to brief Hafiz al-Asad on the Washington 
agreement, the Syrian president apparently told you: "You are 
sitting on the same seat where al-Sadat sat." 
  ['Arafat] That is not true. He would never have dared to 
speak like that. In any case, let us not forget that that is 
also al-Asad's seat. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] The enemies of peace include the Islamic 
fundamentalists of Hamas. Paradoxically, some people in Israel 
have suggested the idea of banishing them to a desert island 
together with the Jewish fascists. And leaving them to settle 
matters among themselves. 
  ['Arafat] I do not like that theory. There is no parallel 
between the Islamic fundamentalists and the Israeli fascists. 
So much so that Rabin himself has supported Hamas from the 
outset, perhaps in the belief that he could thus weaken the 
PLO's leadership. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] After Washington is your destiny bound to that 
of Rabin? 
  ['Arafat] I called that handshake the peace of the brave. 
Now each must draw the necessary conclusions at home and 
shoulder his own responsibilities. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] Tell us about your dream of peace. 
  ['Arafat] I want two states -- Palestine and Israel, next to 
each other. Ours will be a confederation with Jordan, in 
accordance with the decision of the Palestinian and Jordanian 
peoples. We also need a kind of Marshall Plan for the entire 
region. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] So is your plan similar to that of the regional 
common market that Peres is talking about? 
  ['Arafat] Yes, it is. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] Has the West already granted you some economic 
assistance? 
  ['Arafat] We have received only promises. With two 
exceptions -- Spain, which has granted us credit worth $8.5 
million, and Greece. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] What do you expect from Italy? 
  ['Arafat] A great deal. We have always maintained excellent 
relations with Italy. And now I call on the Italian people to 
help us. We need roads, schools, hospitals, aqueducts, an 
airport, sea ports. And also a telecommunications system. 
Everything, in other words. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] Mr. Chairman, one final question: What 
similarities are there between the Palestinians and the Israelis? 
  ['Arafat] There are many: We cannot keep a secret, we are 
gossips, we like publicity, propaganda, and above all we like 
the mass media. And we cannot live without democracy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political </F>
Department, by 'Abd-al-Ra'uf Arna'ut "following the Arab foreign 
ministers meeting" in Cairo on 26 March] 
  [Text] [Arna'ut] What are the latest developments with 
regard to the resumption of the peace talks and the principles 
which cannot be ignored regarding this matter in light of recent 
events in the occupied territories? And when do you expect the 
talks to resume? 
  [Qaddumi] From the outset we insisted that the talks be 
resumed after the Security Council adopts a resolution and after 
measures are taken on the ground. In other words, providing 
measures for the protection of our people in the occupied 
territories, especially in Hebron, in order to create a suitable 
climate for the negotiating process. Hence, to date we have 
been discussing those measures with the Israelis and the 
cosponsors before beginning talks about other issues. 
  [Arna'ut] Recent Palestinian statements indicate that there 
is an emphasis by the Palestinian leadership on the presence of 
international protection in Hebron although there are other 
areas which require such protection no less than Hebron. Is the 
leadership insisting on the presence of this protection in 
Hebron only? 
  [Qaddumi] Security Council Resolution 904 covered all the 
occupied territories, but in particular we asked for special 
arrangements in Hebron because of the presence of settlers and 
students there and because of the ongoing friction in the city, 
which regrettably witnessed those repugnant massacres. However, 
all the measures that we demanded cover all the occupied 
territories. Those include the presence of international 
observers and Palestinian security forces and the adoption of 
measures aimed at disarming the settlers and preventing them 
from wandering around with their weapons. Moreover, other 
measures will have to be adopted so that we will have enough 
reason to resume the talks. 
  [Arna'ut] Do you believe that the international presence, on 
the basis of the Security Council resolution, will be adequate 
in providing protection for the Palestinian people under 
occupation? 
  [Qaddumi] This is one of the measures that must be taken in 
accordance with the Security Council resolution, but the 
definite guarantee for our people in the occupied territories is 
when the Palestinian police assumes this protection. Above all, 
there must first be a speedy Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and 
the Jericho area. 
  [Arna'ut] Don't you believe that the presence of police in 
the Hebron area, then in other parts of the West Bank, will be a 
deviation from the Declaration of Principles? And in light of 
Israeli procrastination, will this not mean -- as some observers 
have indicated -- that Gaza and Jericho will be first and last? 
  [Qaddumi] This is neither correct nor accurate. The 
withdrawal is supposed to begin on 13 April. Afterward, the 
Israeli forces will withdraw from all heavily populated areas 
and be deployed along the red line. Thus, there will be an 
initial and speedy withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, then before 
elections are held in July there will be another withdrawal from 
all the Palestinian territories. 
  [Arna'ut] Do you expect the arrival of the first vanguards 
of the Palestinian police to the occupied territories? 
  [Qaddumi] First of all agreement must be reached on security 
measures, then in the talks we will discuss the date for the 
entry of these battalions into Gaza and the Jericho area. 
  [Arna'ut] What is your perception of the nature of 
Palestinian action in the period up to the Israeli withdrawal 
from the occupied territories? And are there any guarantees 
that a massacre, similar to the one in Hebron, will not be 
repeated? 
  [Qaddumi] There are no guarantees that similar incidents 
will not occur, but world public opinion, which has denounced 
and condemned such deeds, has put Israel in a difficult 
position. However, we cannot say for sure that such deeds will 
not be repeated. We have absolutely no confidence in the 
occupation. As long as there is occupation and as long as 
Israeli soldiers suppress the Palestinian people, resistance 
must continue by all available means. 
  Arna'ut] Don't you think there is a contradiction between 
the continuation of the talks and the practices by the Israeli 
authorities against the sons of our people? 
  [Qaddumi] First of all, war is another form of policy. 
Second, it does not at all prevent talks from taking place. 
These sorts of talks were conducted when Vietnam was waging a 
war. Vietnam witnessed the most abhorrent kinds of inhuman wars 
and the most intensive bombing during the negotiations that were 
held between the Americans and the Vietnamese. This is the 
nature of aggressive wars waged by occupation forces and 
international imperialist forces. 
  [Arna'ut] Many calls have been made by the Palestinian 
street to the Palestinian leadership to halt the talks until a 
change occurs in the Israeli position. Meanwhile, the 
leadership is going to decide to resume the talks. How could 
the leadership be harmonious with the mood of the masses in the 
Palestinian street? 
  [Qaddumi] First of all, undoubtedly leaderships are the ones 
representing public opinion. Second, what is the alternative to 
negotiations? Will we achieve what we want if we halt the talks 
completely or if we walk out of the talks and not insist on 
implementation of the Security Council resolutions in terms of 
the adoption of measures for the protection of our people? 
  [Arna'ut] Does continued Israeli settlement activity in 
Jerusalem not represent a violation of the Oslo accord and the 
bases and principles of the invitation to the Madrid conference? 
  [Qaddumi] The United States and European countries say that 
settlements are an obstacle to peace. European countries stress 
in official communiques that settlements are illegal. In 
Resolution 465, the Security Council says that these settlements 
are illegal and must be dismantled. For all these reasons, we 
say that we adhere to international legitimacy and that the 
solution should be based on this legitimacy. We cannot make the 
slightest concession on these rights. 
  [Arna'ut] What is the state of Arab coordination regarding 
the resumption of talks? 
  [Qaddumi] We maintain bilateral contacts with our brothers 
in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan and consult on these issues. 
Although some Arab states believe the Oslo accord to be a 
deviation from Arab coordination, they must understand that 
there is a transitional stage. This stage does not exist in the 
other Arab tracks. We had to take off in order to conclude the 
transitional stage so that we would reach the final stage with 
the Arabs and so that all of us would negotiate over this stage, 
leading ultimately to a comprehensive peace agreement which all 
of us will sign at the same time. 
  [Arna'ut] Did the Arab foreign ministers meeting today yield 
positive results for the Palestinian territories and the Arab 
arena in terms of reconciliation and joint Arab action, for 
example? 
  [Qaddumi] There were positive indications. All the Arab 
foreign ministers agreed to the Palestinian decisions, supported 
the intifadah, stressed that Jerusalem was part of the occupied 
Palestinian territories, and issued a statement condemning the 
Hebron massacre. These are positive measures that have begun to 
evolve with time and prove the Arabs' desire to enhance Arab 
coordination and solidarity. 
  [Arna'ut] Do you have a statement for the Palestinian 
people? 
  [Qaddumi] If there is one thing I want to say it is that our 
conflict is long but we will triumph. I am not saying this to 
encourage our great people who have waited for many years, but 
the historical process affirms that we will triumph and regain 
all our rights. Patience is a good thing, but action and 
resistance should continue. While resisting, we are keen for 
the safety of our cadres and are trying to reduce our losses as 
much as possible. We will continue in this struggle and will 
not become restless. We will act when we see that such action 
is beneficial to our cause.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "'Urayqat: Settlement and Peace Will </F>
Never Meet; Solving Palestinian Problem Is Basis for Stability 
in Region"] 
  [Excerpts] London, AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI -- A senior 
Palestinian leader has warned that the peace process is 
threatened with collapse as a result of the Israeli Government's 
intransigence and refusal to seriously discuss the issue of 
evacuating the settlements as a fundamental point in the file of 
the bilateral negotiations between the two sides. He stressed 
that the Palestinian leadership, which is discussing the demands 
of its people, is fully aware that "settlement is a time bomb 
which will explode in its face later unless it is defused 
completely." And that the "U.S. Administration is responsible 
for obstructing the peace process." 
  Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the negotiating Palestinian 
delegation in Washington, said at a seminar in the British 
capital during the evening of the day before yesterday that "the 
Middle East problem did not begin between the Arabs and Israel. 
It began inside Palestine. And without solving the Palestinian 
problem there will be no solution in the Middle East." 
  He criticized the U.S. position on the Hebron massacre and 
the U.S. Administration's threat to use its influence inside the 
international organization to confront it if we insist on the 
implementation of the UN resolutions. He added that he was in 
Washington when the massacre occurred and that he held several 
round of talks, but "President Clinton and his secretary of 
state, Warren Christopher, failed to realize that the 
perpetrator of the massacre is a settler and the main cause is 
settlement." 
  Dr. 'Urayqat warned that "settlement and peace will never 
meet," stressing that Washington alone can salvage the 
negotiations, which were suspended after the massacre. He 
criticized its international position of appeasing Israel, 
accusing it of offering Israel preferential and biased treatment 
by excluding Europe from the peace process and confronting 
Russia, the co-sponsor of the negotiations. The Americans and 
the Israelis are imposing their will on us, instead of sitting 
with us to negotiate." 
  'Urayqat denied that the Palestinians demanded a solution to 
the settlers issue only after the Hebron massacre. He said: 
"The massacre made it a strong issue." He added that the 
Israelis had always refused to discuss the settlements issue, 
stressing that none of our fears would materialize." 
  The head of the Palestinian delegation to the Washington 
negotiations added that "failure to include the settlement issue 
on the negotiating agenda will inevitably lead to the death of 
the negotiations, and the Israeli Government alone is 
responsible for what settlers did and are doing." 
  He went on: "Even if our leadership decides -- under the 
pressures to which it is exposed -- to join the negotiations 
once again, the negotiations will die if this issue is not 
resolved. And peace requires evacuating the settlers first, 
otherwise any measure will be merely a measure to make the peace 
process look prettier." 
  'Urayqat warned the U.S. Administration, the Europeans, and 
any party interested in the success of the peace process that 
"the failure of the peace process will not only affect the 
Palestinians and the Israelis, but will have a regional impact." 
'Urayqat accused the Israeli offers to end the effects of the 
Hebron massacre of lacking seriousness. He said that "the offer 
to disarm the settlers is not a serious one, because they are 
all reservists and thus entitled to keep weapons in their 
homes." [passage omitted] 
  He said that 72 settlers in Hebron are protected around the 
clock by 1,400 Israeli soldiers. "So what sort of negotiations 
do we wish to continue if the problem is not included on the 
agenda." Addressing the Palestinian leadership, he said sorry, 
but "the settlers remaining while Palestinian police forces are 
deployed there would lead in the event of a massacre like the 
Hebron massacre to one of two things: 
  "First, inhabitants killing settlers in retaliation, 
resulting in Israel sending its aircraft to destroy 'Arafat's 
headquarters and police centers; 
  "Second, inhabitants throwing stones at settlers, thus 
initiating a whirlpool of successive reactions, taking us back 
to square one." 
  He added: "We asked Rabin to settle his options, so he chose 
settlement, domination, and the logic of force. Rabin is 
supported by the U.S. Administration, the U.S. Army, and senior 
U.S. envoy Dennis Ross." 
  'Urayqat admitted the Palestinians are faced with deep and 
unprecedented difficulties and changes, saying that the Oslo 
agreement is not a final peace agreement. He said: "The 
agreement contains 63 clauses, none of which has a mechanism for 
implementation and each needs an agreement of its own." 
  Asked about the disagreement with President Yasir 'Arafat, 
'Urayqat stressed that he ['Arafat] "is a source of strength for 
us, and we are not criticizing him. We realize he is merely a 
human being like all of us." He added: "We want peace more 
than any other people, but not at any price, because we will not 
accept any solution seeking to reorganize the Israeli 
occupation." 
  Palestinian figures who attended the seminar noted that Dr. 
"Urayqat's speech reflected the view of the Palestinians inside 
the occupied territories, who are urging 'Arafat to grant them 
more powers as regards decisionmaking vis-a-vis peace and 
negotiations. 
  'Urayqat said that Rabin "has the impression that he can do 
anything without a deterrent in view of the U.S. solidarity and 
the European silence -- which causes me to say that the peace 
process is approaching its end. This has nothing to do with 
optimism or pessimism. I just do not know whether or not the 
process can continue." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Baghdad, 31 Mar (INA)--'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur, 
member of the Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, 
left Baghdad en route to Moscow today at the head of an Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party delegation to attend meetings of the 
conference of the Russian Liberal Democrat Party [LDP] that is 
due to convene there next week. 
  In a statement to INA, 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur said 
that 
the party delegation will hold talks with Russian parties and 
political forces to promote ties between the Arab Socialist 
Ba'th Party and these parties and forces. The party delegation 
will also explain to these Russian parties and forces the 
implications and dangers of the unfair anti-Iraq embargo that 
continues due to the wishes of the United States and Zionism, 
although Iraq has fulfilled its commitments per relevant UN 
Security Council resolutions, including Resolution 687. 
  'Abd-al-Ghafur added that the improved positions of a few UN 
Security Council permanent members, including Russia, 
demonstrate the need to implement Paragraph 22 of UN Security 
Council Resolution 687, and immediately lift the unfair embargo 
clamped on Iraq.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, chairman of the </F>
Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, in Tehran by 
Zuhayr Qusaybati in London; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Qusaybati] Some opposition parties believe 
that your staying in Iran and failure to move to northern Iraq 
is obstructing the effort to unify the opposition. 
  [Al-Hakim] My staying in Iran is natural, as it (Iran) was 
and continue to be a base for jihad and political action against 
the regime. And it provides opportunities for contacts inside 
and abroad, whether within the region or with the international 
community. 
  It also has major scientific seminaries like the Qom 
seminary 
-- which provide opportunities for moves at all levels in line, 
of course, with all our political and cultural moves. And I do 
not believe that my moving to northern Iraq would provide a new 
opportunity for the opposition, especially as I have always 
believed it is necessary for me personally to remain outside the 
unified opposition establishments. However, I believe in the 
opposition's unity. [passage omitted] 
  [Qusaybati] Is your moving to northern Iraq on the cards? 
  [Al-Hakim] My moving to north Iraq is on the cards and 
natural. I also believe that it would provide a better 
opportunity to serve the aim of getting rid of the criminal 
regime and achieving justice, brotherhood, and unity in Iraq. 
But I do not believe that there is a need for it at the moment, 
especially as general harmony and cooperation exist with the 
Kurdish brothers, may God bestow success on them, and also with 
the other opposition parties operating in Iraqi Kurdistan. 
  [Qusaybati] Do you believe the opposition can still be 
unified? And what about your reservations about the Salah 
al-Din conference? 
  [Al-Hakim] I believe that unifying the opposition in the 
general sense is possible. And some steps have been achieved, 
as a group of the major forces is cooperating this connection. 
And efforts are still continuing to achieve the other steps. 
What is easy to achieve should not be abandoned because of what 
is difficult to achieve, as the Islamic jurisprudence rule says. 
  As for the reservations announced by the Islamic forces 
about 
the Salah al-Din conference, this institution has responded to 
some of them and efforts are being made to surmount the others. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Qusaybati] Some people accuse you of adhering to Iranian 
policy and confirming things with it. 
  [Al-Hakim] That is a completely false accusation. It is a 
method used by the enemies in the psychological war to achieve 
political aims. This is in the knowledge that we respect the 
views of the brother believers in Iran and also respect Iran's 
policy. [passage omitted] 
  [Qusaybati] You are calling for a change of regime, but the 
opposition is accused of ineffectiveness and lack of influence 
inside the country. 
  [Al-Hakim] The Iraqi position, in particular the Islamic 
opposition, has turned from an opposition of political groups 
and forces into an opposition of a people fighting for the sake 
of salvation. The best proof of this is the uprising of 15 
Sha'ban 1411 H (March 1991) and the Iraqi people's resistance 
and jihad operations, which are still continuing despite the 
regime's numerous attempts to destroy the resistance, use of 
heavy and deadly weapons, and numerous and huge life-destroying 
schemes like draining the marshes, the economic and military 
blockade, the continued large-scale sweeps in the cities, and 
physical liquidations and executions. 
  [Qusaybati] Do you believe foreign intervention is on the 
cards? 
  [Al-Hakim] I believe that the Iraqi people should carry out 
the salvation task, and the international community should help 
them to do so. Regrettably the international community still 
has not responded to the appeal for help. [passage omitted] 
  [Qusaybati] You demanded the establishment of a "safe area" 
in southern Iraq. How do you explain the West's intervention to 
set up a safe area in the north and its and the United Nations' 
disregard for your appeals vis-a-vis the south? 
  [Al-Hakim] I did not demand a safe area in the south. I 
demanded protection for all the Iraqi people against heavy 
weapons and annihilation operations -- that is, the annihilation 
of people and life. [passage omitted] 
  [Qusaybati] What is the number of the men of the "Badr 
Corps" belonging to the "Supreme Assembly of the Islamic 
Revolution" in Iran? 
  [Al-Hakim] It is not right to reveal such information. 
  [Qusaybati] Iraqi opposition sources say that Iranian 
sources have scattered the corps' men. 
  [Al-Hakim] That is untrue. At any rate, we have our own 
means of retaining our own military forces. 
  [Qusaybati] What about Tehran's attempts to normalize 
relations with Baghdad? Does that not worry you? 
  [Al-Hakim] I have said from the outset that these attempts 
do not worry us, because our work is associated with the Iraqi 
people as a whole, and the issue is too broad and deep to be 
harmed by these relations. This is why we see the regime more 
frightened than us of these relations. [sentence as published] 
  [Qusaybati] How do you explain President Saddam Husayn's 
threat to retaliate against the extension of international 
sanctions, given that a split has emerged in the Security 
Council over determining an armament inspection timetable that 
would help lift the oil blockade? 
  [Al-Hakim] Saddam is experiencing a real crisis, not only at 
the economic level but also at the level of the narrow and 
limited base on which he relies, which has begun to shake. This 
is in addition to the popular turmoil and his inability to 
control the situation except through the Army -- which poses a 
real threat to his existence. This is why he is trying to 
preoccupy the Army with fabricated actions. And he could commit 
a crime or another foolish action for the sake of staying in 
power. This is why three areas are likely to targeted: the 
marshlands and the north, Kuwait, or Iran... or all of them. 
And he has indeed begun his attack in the marshlands but has so 
far failed to achieve his aims. And he has also begun to 
provoke Iran through some limited military operations. He has 
also begun to deploy troops [on the border with] the north and 
Iraqi Kurdistan and Kuwait. Maybe in his view Kuwait is the 
most important of the fronts in question. God knows. 
  As for the Security Council's split, it is the result of a 
conflict of interests. And the regime has its own means of 
tempting and making the interests owners' mouths water as 
regards the hope of having some of the debts paid. Even though 
the regime has not paid its previous debts. In fact it has 
increased the debts and failed to fulfill its promises and 
pledges. It has actually broken them and failed to achieve 
stability for the region. In fact these opportunist attitudes 
have resulted in unrest and serious threats.

  [Text] Gonaveh (Bushehr), March 31, IRNA -- Scores of Iraqi 
families have been made homeless as a result of the Iraqi 
regime's fresh offensives on the southern marshlands, reported 
reliable sources here today. 
  According to the fresh arrivals, the people in the Iraqi 
marshlands especially the women and children, are suffering 
through shortage of foodstuffs and medicine. 
  The radio "Voice of Iraqi People," operating from somewhere 
inside Iraq, reported today that scores of refuge families in 
al-Basrah, Nasiriyah and al-Amarah have left their homes for 
safe havens, near the Iranian borders in the southeast. 
  The Iraqi Arabs betrayed by the U.S. and its coalition 
forces 
which incited them against Saddam Husayn and then deserted them 
in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, have been 
subject to rigorous economic sanctions. 
  The Iraqi regime launches periodical attacks on the 
southerners and other opponents in the central and northern 
parts.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Kurdish Officials Deny </F>
Appointment of Barzani as Governor of Iraqi Kurdistan"] 
  [Excerpt] London -- An Iraqi Kurdish official has denied 
yesterday's reports that the Iraqi Government intended to 
appoint Mas'ud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party 
[KDP], as governor general of Iraqi Kurdistan. He said that 
this claim was "unfounded and aimed to undermine the KDP and its 
leader." 
  The Qatari News Agency [QNA], citing the Jordanian paper 
AL-BILAD, said yesterday that the Baghdad government would 
appoint Barzani as "governor general of the Kurdish autonomy 
region in the north of the country." The paper cited what it 
called "informed Arab sources" as saying that the Kurdish leader 
would "return to Baghdad within 10 days at the latest to settle 
in his country permanently." 
  Muhsin Dazha'i, Barzani's personal representative and member 
of the Executive Council of the opposition's Iraqi National 
Congress [INC], told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that "the 
report was fabricated at the instigation of the Iraqi Government 
and some tendentious people." He added that "its aim is to 
undermine the party and its leader and create confusion, 
suspicion, and friction among the Kurdish people, the Kurdish 
parties, and the Iraqi opposition forces in general." 
  An official of the KDP's European Bureau in London has also 
denied the report, describing it as "sheer lies." 
  Hani al-Fukayki, deputy chairman of the INC Executive 
Council, accused the Iraqi intelligence services of trying to 
"confuse the Iraqi opposition, the Arab states, and the United 
Nations by spreading rumors and lies such as that report." He 
added that "Saddam's local and regional intelligence services 
have made up that false report in order to harm Barzani who, 
along with other brothers, is leading the struggle in the 
homeland against Baghdad's dictatorship and despotism and for 
the creation of a united, federal, democratic Iraqi state."

  [Text] Watchers of the Syrian scene and arrivals from 
Syria report that Basil, President Hafiz al-Asad's eldest son, 
met his death at the hands of drug gangsters operating in 
Lebanon. 
  According to some reliable sources, Basil was killed in 
Lebanon, having received threats in connection with the hush 
money he had been receiving from hashish growers and smugglers. 
He had been suspected of planning to swindle the traffickers 
and control the market. 
  The sources indicate that the news of Basil's death, 
officially caused by an auto crash, was broken two days after 
its actual date. Neither was there any picture of the the 
accident that could be shown on Syrian television. 
  Observers note that Lebanese factions, the Maronites in 
particular, were keen to send delegations to pay their last 
respects, lest any be suspected of involvement in his 
assassination and then bear the vengeance of Syrian intelligence 
services. 
  The observers are confident that the next few days will bear 
out their assessment. A tradition of the al-Nasiriyah sect 
calls for the deceased's face to be uncovered for a final 
glimpse, which was not observed in the case of Basil al-Asad.

    [Editorial Report] Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic on 23, 24, 
25, and 27 March 1994, and Baghdad BABIL in Arabic on 26 March 
1994 publish articles by Iraqi columnists on the latest UN 
Security Council debate over the Iraqi blockade. All articles 
note a "development" in the UN Security Council stance, saying 
now that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations, Security Council 
members should honor their resolutions "despite any endeavor by 
the United States to continue the blockade." However, while 
most articles hail "the new UN stand" as a development "in 
Iraq's favor" and predict "great victory" soon, one columnist, 
while acknowledging this development, thinks Iraqis have been 
too euphoric, and warns local papers against playing up the 
"split," saying "our papers have been carried away by this game 
of nations." 
  Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic 23 March carries in its 
"Standpoint" column on page two a 700-word article by Mu'ayyad 
'Abd-al-Zahrah entitled: "The Security Council Must Honor Its 
Resolutions!" The article says Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 
'Aziz's intensive deliberations and contacts with UN members 
have led to "further international understanding of and clear 
sympathy with Iraq's rights and legitimate demands." Referring 
to the "Iraqi message of facts" which 'Aziz submitted to the 
Security Council, the article says: "Facing the Security Council 
with the facts and asking it to stand by its decision had fully 
exposed the situation so that it was no longer acceptable for 
anyone to remain silent." "The message," the article adds: "was 
echoed by several permanent member states, which acknowledged 
Iraq's positive steps toward and tangible cooperation with the 
UN resolutions." The article concludes: "Thus, the new change 
occurred as a result of Iraq's steadfastness and firm struggle 
as well as its people's courage and patience in adversity. The 
coming days portend the harvest of a great victory over the 
tyrant and the collapse of the unfair blockade." 
  The paper also publishes in its "Attention" column on page 
three a 300-word article by Hasan al-Kashif entitled: "The 
Blockade and the Requirement." Al-Kashif says due to "absolute 
U.S. and British hostility to Iraq" those Security Council 
members "who acknowledged Iraq's commitment and cooperation with 
the United Nations are alone qualified to represent 
international will." He adds: "Washington has chosen to be the 
enemy of Iraq and this is its own affair. But, if it wants to 
express its dirty options, it should do so outside international 
legitimacy. At any rate, This is not something new to the 
United States, which is blockading Cuba due to an American 
decision with which no one agrees. Therefore, it can, if it 
wants, remain captive to its failure before Iraq's willpower. 
But it has no right to ask the international community to adopt 
a stand which is not based on legitimacy or law. It cannot 
justify the murder of Iraqi people through hunger and disease." 
  Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic 24 March publishes in its 
"Standpoint" column on page two a 700-word article by 'Adil Sa'd 
entitled "The International Change and the Internal 
Requirement," saying: Two factors were behind "the creation of 
a significant majority in the Security Council calling for a new 
approach" Iraq's cooperation with the UN resolutions and its 
citizens' "great patience and ability to adjust to hardships." 
Sa'd calls upon the government, headed by the Prime Ministry, 
to make up for the citizens' endurance internally by improving 
public services and being "very tough with the renegade 
parasites and horders who speculate on people's livelihood." 
  Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic on 27 March carries in its 
"Standpoint" column a 500-word article by 'Isa Ismail al-'Abbadi 
entitled: "The Blockade In a Bottleneck." Al-'Abbadi says 
contacts inside and outside UN lobbies between Iraq and world 
nations indicate that the blockade "is in a bottleneck and its 
continuation can no longer be justified by anyone," despite 
"contradictions" in recent statements by Ekeus, chairman of the 
UN Special Commission, "who, in one press interview, says he 
cannot now say that he is completely satisfied with what he has 
achieved in Iraq concerning the implementation of what was 
requested by the Security Council, and in another press 
interview says that he is 'completely satisfied' with what he 
achieved in Iraq in this regard, but also adding that he cannot 
now recommend lifting the blockade on Iraq." Al-'Abbadi 
concludes by saying that in view of these contradictions "It is 
essential for the Security Council to consider the facts as they 
stand without being influenced by the biased political 
influences of the United States." 
  Baghdad BABIL in Arabic 26 March 1994 publishes on page two 
an article by Mazhar 'Arif entitled: "The Security Council and 
the Game of Nations!" (filed as JN3003215794) in which he warns 
lraqi news media against playing up the "split" in the Security 
Council by raising citizens' hope about "an impending 
breakthrough," saying what took place was "a game of nations," 
and the outcome was "a gain for the United States, and not for 
Iraq." 
  Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic 25 March 1994 carries in its 
"AL-THAWRAH Diary" on page eight an article by Wadi' al-Muzaffar 
entitled: "A Pledge by Marsh Arabs." The item says since 
President Saddam Husayn's "historic speech" to the Iraqi cabinet 
on Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz' mission to the UN Security 
Council to lift the blockade, Ba'th Party offices in the , 
al-Basrah Governorate witnessed continuous tribal rallies in 
support of the president. The item says tribal chiefs and 
citizens "armed to the teeth" poured into those offices 
"demanding to volunteer as fighters against evil aggressors." 
The item reports on one particular rally in a tribal camp in 
the marshlands, where an 80-year old tribal chief addressing his 
sons and grandsons says: "The mean, treacherous act of the 
Americans and Zionists in blockading Iraq and depriving our 
people of food and medicine, and their flying of their crows in 
our airspace on the pretext of protecting us have driven me 
crazy." He pledges: "We stand behind the leader Saddam Husayn 
with all we possess: soul, spirit, and the tribe."

<F P=106> ["Mazhar 'Arif Article: "The Security Council, a Game of </F>
Nations!"] 
  [Text] What took place in the UN Security Council over Iraq 
was, in my personal opinion, a game of nations: Two states 
against three, and all of them permanent members. Yet, the 
blockade was extended with the approval of all five on the 
pretext of routine extension, and the dissemination of a good 
measure of hope that the position would completely change in 
favor of lifting the blockade after two months; that is, during 
the next Council session in May. The proof was that the 
traditional chairman's statement on the extension, which is 
normally released every two months by the Council, was not 
issued this time because of what they termed a "split" between 
the permanent member states over the draft of that statement. 
It is really unfortunate, in my opinion also, that our papers 
have been carried away by this game of nations and have entered 
into some kind of race between them to break the good tidings to 
the citizen about an impending breakthrough in our tribulation, 
while what was required, according to the science of politics -- 
and this is another aspect of the whole issue -- was that we 
should not have tampered with the citizen's sentiments and 
thoughts by relying on certain situations that developed here 
and there connected with the motives and calculations of all 
these sides in the Security Council. 
  The sides in the game of nations have reduced the issue of 
the criminal blockade on Iraq, in which all the permanent 
members and other world nations have taken part, into a mere 
statement. On this basis, a Don Quixote-like battle has taken 
place in which wooden swords were used, and here lies the 
theatrical. 
  Those who opposed the draft of the chairman's statement and 
insisted on including references to Iraq's cooperation with the 
world organization, but could not do so due to the opposition of 
the United States, Britain and Argentina, should have lifted the 
blockade themselves or transformed the Council session into an 
occasion for a general debate on the sanctions, which have been 
imposed on our country, with the view to removing them or using 
the veto against any U.S. endeavor to prolong the blockade -- 
which is what I referred to in my article last Saturday -- in 
order to affirm the credibility of their new conviction, 
interpret their words into actual deeds, but above all, affirm 
something which is even more important; namely, their freedom to 
determine their own foreign policy and to make decisions 
according to national and international interests, not as they 
are required to do by others now or at any other time. 
  In order not to deceive our people -- and this is a matter 
that concerns us in the press and the other news media -- we 
must convey to them the full picture about any situation. In 
the case of the last UN Security Council session, we should not 
have relied on ready-made analyses or answers concerning the 
positions taken by the permanent member states of the Security 
Council and other members in the Council. When we explain to 
the people what happened by saying that this means the beginning 
of a split between the big powers because some of them -- and 
this is the prevalent talk now in political writings -- have 
began to realize the danger of being continuously dragged behind 
U.S. policy, and to clearly see their interests with Iraq, for 
instance, which are long and historical interests, we should 
also tell the reader that what took place in the Security 
Council was a political exercise by some people for different 
reasons that concern only them. Each state that spoke about the 
positive points in the Iraqi position did so with the aim of 
bargaining with the Americans over certain national and other 
issues by using Iraq this time. 
  Therefore, as far as I am concerned, what took place in the 
Security Council does not deserve the importance it was given by 
our press or the foreign press. What took place was an attempt 
to calm Iraq, reduce world public pressure to lift the blockade 
on Iraq, and to busy everyone at least for the present time with 
the game of the division within the Council without disturbing 
or annoying the United States. 
  In the final analysis, this is a gain for the United States 
and not really for Iraq. True, what took place -- and 
regardless of the opinions expressed in this article -- was a 
positive development in the positions of Russia and France in 
particular, since China is known to have expressed its 
reservations on every resolution adopted against Iraq right from 
the beginning, we must not exaggerate that development, unless 
it develops into a definite new relationship with Iraq, outside 
U.S. trusteeship, as of now and without waiting for the next 
Security Council session in May.

<F P=106> ["Attention" column by Hasan al-Kashif: "Shelling of </F>
Hebron's Occupation"] 
  [Text] After 27 years of military occupation of the City of 
Hebron, the occupation authorities could not find a way to 
control the city other than by artillery shelling, anti-tank 
rockets, and heavy machine guns. By this invasion, Hebron says 
it is a city that cannot submit to the will of the Zionists, and 
that it is a Palestinian Arab city with a free will that could 
not be subdued by years of captivity, suppression, murder, 
deportation, confiscation of lands, and encroachment on 
sanctities. 
  In Hebron, a real war continued for 18 hours after the city 
was isolated and besieged by the occupation army, thereby 
revealing its old colonial face. The army intervened after the 
settlers had failed to subdue the will of the Ibrahimi Mosque 
guards, who are all Hebronites, brothers of Gazans, sons of all 
Palestine who deepened their affiliation with their Arabism with 
heavy sacrifices, while all others around them were heading 
toward their final downfall in the final, historical screening 
of the entire Arab popular and official rank. 
  At the peak of talks on the details of how to deprive 
international protection of its effectiveness, the army of Rabin 
and Peres invaded Hebron to re-occupy it and guarantee effective 
protection of the settlers, whose crime Rabin and Peres had 
disowned for temporary political reasons. 
  But by that 18-hour armed confrontation, Palestinian 
militants, who believe in their freedom, sovereignty, and full 
rights, showed they were in full control of their will and that 
they had completely given up the idea of attaining their rights 
outside the confrontation field. Because everything in Hebron 
and all other towns and camps of occupied Palestine is now 
clear, and everything in the labyrinths of open and secret talks 
is suspect and vague. Chief negotiator Shahal is a false man of 
peace at the negotiation table; in the battlefield, however, he 
is a general armed to the teeth with U.S. weapons and racist 
Zionist hatred. Once he is through with his murderous, 
suppressive tasks, he changes his uniform and goes back to 
continue his mission at the negotiations table. It is precisely 
here that we clearly see the unison of enemy words and deeds. 
It is also here, unfortunately, that we clearly notice the 
absence and growing separation of the [Palestinian] negotiator 
from the resistance stand in Hebron which, like other parts of 
the land, is creating its own glory and delivering another 
child, who will hold a stone to the face of the occupation 
soldier, with his helmet and gun, and force him to flee in 
defeat. 
  Is Washington, which recognizes Jerusalem as the eternal 
capital of "Israel," suitable as an arbiter of justice after all 
bloody massacres and moral scandals?! 
  Denunciation is our firm answer at this stage when the 
Intifada is moving toward a wider armed confrontation, opening 
the way for a general armed popular rebellion, which will 
definitely come.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Henceforth Blame-Free" by 'Abd al-Jabbar Muhsin] </F>
  [Text] In coping with aggression and the blockade, our 
ancient people, interacting with their leadership, have lined up 
a number of mechanisms that have brought the crisis to 
manageable proportions, and thus thwarted the primary objectives 
of the aggression and the blockade. 
  Not a single Iraqi has even entertained the possibility of 
kowtowing to the aggressors or conceding their demands. Nor has 
any Iraqi ever thought of abandoning his people's interests or 
sovereignty. Our first mechanism was the armed struggle to ward 
off aggression and rout its first line in the south of the 
country, where the men of the demanding missions attached to the 
Republican Guards proved they were not sitting targets for 
invaders, but men standing ready to defend their land. Iraq did 
not provide the example of a nation crushed by the United 
States, but rather an example of a people who, with the benefit 
of the right leadership and a willingness to sacrifice, can hold 
out and stand firm. Then came the rebuilding mechanism that 
proved to the enemies they could not possibly set Iraq back to 
the pre-industrial age. 
  However, as Iraq patiently pursued the jihad and 
reconstruction effort, it also followed a political line of its 
own that fragmented the opposing forces, increased its own 
supporters, and denied the enemies any justifications for any 
fresh aggression on its infrastructure. Iraq has proved that it 
is not a discordance in international relations, but the 
repository of legitimate hopes. It has shown itself to be a 
champion of freedom, security, advancement, and peace. 
  The aggressors have been waiting for any false steps by Iraq 
to justify retaining the sanctions, but they have been denied 
this opportunity by Iraq's judiciousness. 
  Thus, Iraq is now free to say and do what it will in defense

fault the way it is conducting itself.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Shlomo </F>
Ganor in Peres' office on 31 March -- recorded in Hebrew with 
Arabic subtitles; processed from Hebrew] 
  [Text] [Ganor] Mr. Peres, does the agreement on security 
arrangements in Hebron provide satisfactory answers to the 
special situation and needs of the city? 
  [Peres] It stems from the special situation in the city, and 
in my opinion it can alleviate the tension in the city, as well 
as bring about the resumption and early conclusion of the Gaza 
and Jericho talks. 
  [Ganor] Will this agreement serve as an example for other 
agreements which could be implemented on the ground before the 
autonomy is established? 
  [Peres] I do not think so. I hope there will be no need to 
repeat this thing, meaning that there will be no more terrible 
incidents such as at the Cave of the Patriarchs. I want to 
state unequivocally that the Israeli Government alone is 
responsible for security at the Cave of the Patriarchs and for 
enabling Jewish and Muslim worshipers to pray freely and without 
any danger to their lives. Not the settlers, guards, or anyone 
else is responsible for security -- only we are. Naturally we 
are interested in implementing arrangements which would permit 
peaceful prayers. In future we will consult with the Waqf on 
everything relating to the Muslim side, just as we have done in 
the past. 
  [Ganor] What are the next steps, now that this agreement has 
been signed? 
  [Peres] The main thing now is to facilitate the final part 
of the Gaza and Jericho negotiations and to implement this 
agreement soon. On the basis of the agreement achieved last 
night, seven days following the signing of the agreement on 
Hebron Palestinian police units are slated to start entering 
Gaza. This is to all intents and purposes the beginning of the 
agreement's implementation. 
  [Ganor] Does the Hebron agreement pave the way for 
implementing the Gaza and Jericho agreement? 
  [Peres] Certainly. The negotiations on Gaza and Jericho 
started the moment we reached agreement on Hebron. The Hebron 
agreement was signed today at 1100; immediately after that the 
Gaza and Jericho negotiations started. We will work ceaselessly 
until these negotiations are completed. The implementation 
stage will also be considerably accelerated. 
  [Ganor] Is there an understanding regarding the timetable 
for the completion of the negotiations? 
  [Peres] Some people say it will take a week, others that it 
will take two weeks. It depends on the rate of our work and on 
the problems we encounter. If we find quick solutions to the 
problems -- such as the problems of jurisdiction and authority 
-- then the process will be very quick. If there are problems, 
this could slow down the process. 
  [Ganor] Will Israel stick to the target date of 13 April? 
  [Peres] Israel will strive to honor this date -- whether the 
13th, 14th, or 15th of April, the precise day does not matter so 
much. Again, this depends on our not encountering serious or 
unexpected problems. I hope things will run smoothly. My inner 
feeling is that the PLO -- just like us -- is interested in 
finally ending the negotiations and turning this into a reality. 
This is the first time the Palestinian people will have a 
concrete piece of reality, not merely a piece of paper, a 
declaration, a congratulatory or condolences letter -- but 
rather a territory, an authority, an administration, and 
responsibility, as is proper.

<F P=106> [Video report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>
  [Excerpts] Sources in Jerusalem are concerned that the 
entrance of the international force into Hebron will create 
difficulties, but Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin this evening said 
he hopes this is an exceptional and one-time arrangement. Our 
political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen heard the Israeli 
reaction to the Cairo agreement: 
  [Rosen] In Jerusalem there are mixed feelings today. On the 
one hand there is satisfaction with the success in defusing the 
dangerous Hebron situation; on the other hand there is concern 
about the precedent and difficulties involved in bringing 
international forces into the territories. [passage omitted] 
  The PLO gains three things from the international presence: 
international recognition in the special problems of Hebron; 
interference with Israeli activities in the city; and receiving 
something that Israel sharply opposed from the beginning. The 
PLO also received a promise to accelerate the withdrawal process 
from the Gaza Strip. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Political commentary" by Shim'on Schiffer: "PLO's </F>
Achievement"] 
  [Text] PLO Chief Yasir 'Arafat can enter another 
achievement in the log of his long voyage toward independence 
for his Palestinian people. 
  The Oslo agreement formulators never even dared put the 
possibility of foreign observers in the territories in writing. 
It was taboo as far as Israel was concerned. And yet now 
Israel has consented, for the first time, to the deployment of 
an international force in the territories, and it does not 
matter that it is called "temporary international presence." 
  Since 1967, Israel has refused, in one way or another, all 
Palestinian demands raised through UN-endorsed resolutions to 
hand the territories over to international custody. Now the 
demand has been accepted as the interim stage en route to the 
territories transfer to the Palestinians. The gain, therefore, 
is now all 'Arafat's. 
  As for the opponents to the agreement with the PLO, they 
can, 
if they like, direct their complaints to Dr. Barukh Goldstein. 
This was his present to them. The Hebron massacre accelerated 
proceedings designed to sever and separate Israelis from 
Palestinians. 
  'Arafat conceded nothing in the negotiations conducted after 
the Hebron massacre: Contrary to reports about the 
Palestinians' waiving the deployment of Palestinian policemen in 
Hebron, they did not give in even on this issue. 'Arafat had no 
use for a Palestinian police that was subordinate to Israeli 
command. He was afraid -- with reason, from his viewpoint -- 
that the Palestinian public would perceive such policemen as 
collaborators with the occupation regime. Thus the force of 
several dozens Norwegians, to which Israel had agreed, became a 
160-member observer force with a freedom of action in Hebron. 
  The second Cairo agreement, which was signed yesterday by 
Amnon Shahaq and Nabil Sha'th, concurs with what any reader of 
the Oslo agreement has always known -- that Israel is going to 
surrender the territories it took in 1967. The Oslo agreement 
has been described as vague and ambiguous in many spheres; the 
second Cairo agreement elucidates the issues for those who are 
still in the dark as to Israel's destination. 
  This agreement will also have a political ramification: 
Please note that within a year, Israel will have gained many 
enemies in Norway, Denmark, and Italy, three currently friendly 
countries. The dispatch of observers from these countries to 
Hebron is the surest way to turn the amicable relations with 
people from these countries into hostility and resentment.

  [Text] The prime minister is conferring with opposition 
leaders on the situation in the territories. Before the 
meeting, the opposition leaders met and decided to urge Mr. 
Rabin to make a commitment not to evacuate any settlements. 
  There was a large meeting at the prime minister's bureau 
this 
morning to sum up the agreement reached on Hebron security 
arrangements and the resumption of the Gaza-Jericho first talks. 
Our political correspondent reports that Israel has expressed 
displeasure with the suspension of the Israeli-PLO economic 
talks, which the PLO initiated. The delegation for talks on 
Gaza-Jericho security will leave for Cairo on Sunday and on 
Monday the delegation for talks on civilian matters will leave.

<F P=106> [Video report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who until recently 
opted for the Jordanian option, has recently changed his 
position and decided to concentrate mainly on facilitating the 
dialogue with Damascus. For this purpose, he even postponed a 
visit abroad. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen 
reports about a new emphasis emerging in Jerusalem: 
  All those who have recently been closely following comments 
made by Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres regarding the price 
Israel will have to pay on the Golan Heights, could not avoid 
noticing that there was more in these remarks than a change in 
nuance. The previous statement according to which the depth of 
withdrawal will equal the depth of peace has now been replaced 
by much more explicit remarks. Several days ago, appearing 
before the Forum for Peace and Security, Rabin made explicit 
remarks which were published in the press and have not been 
denied so far. Rabin spoke about normalization of relations 
before Israel completes the withdrawal from the Golan Heights, 
rather than on the Golan Heights -- a withdrawal to which it 
will commit itself in the framework of the negotiations. The 
entire issue hinges on the difference in the preposition. 
  Jerusalem sources speak about a positive atmosphere 
emanating 
from Damascus nowadays, but Rabin is saying that he is still 
awaiting a signal from al-Asad, after which the sky will be the 
limit -- or perhaps the international border. What is Rabin 
waiting for? Three things mainly: for the process to become 
overt, that is, public meetings at a senior level; openness 
toward Israel on the Syrian media; and pro-Israeli comments by 
Syrian leaders. 
  The most recent developments, however, have occurred in 
Jerusalem. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who so far was the 
one with most reservations regarding Syria and who supported the 
Jordan option, has changed his position. Peres is extremely 
annoyed with King Husayn for not making any progress in his 
contacts with Israel, and has decided to invest all his efforts 
in the contacts with Syria. Peres is thereby joining the Syrian 
lobby, which includes IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Intelligence 
Chief Uri Sagi, Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq, Ambassador Itamar 
Rabinovich, and Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin. For this 
reason he announced he is canceling a planned visit to Ethiopia 
and Eritrea, this in order to focus his efforts on negotiations 
with Syria.

  [Excerpt] The U.S. Administration has recently expressed 
concern over publications regarding contacts between Israel and 
Iraq. U.S. Ambassador in Israel Edward Djerejian has asked 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin for answers on this issue. 
  The prime minister vehemently denied the existence of any 
contacts with Baghdad. A senior political source in Jerusalem 
said last week: "There is no point in maintaining contacts with 
Iraq as long as Saddam Husayn is in power. Saddam is a madman, 
and you do not marry one." 
  According to the British weekly FOREIGN REPORT, Israel and 
Iraq have been holding indirect contacts through European and 
Palestinian mediators in a bid to expand the peace process. 
According to the paper, in the framework of the contacts, 
efforts are being made to arrange a meeting between Foreign 
Minister Peres and a senior Iraqi figure. 
  The foreign minister's bureau yesterday denied the London 
weekly story, saying: "this is nonsense." [passage omitted]

testimonies from the head of the Jerusalem district in the Shin 
Bet. Earlier Colonel Moshe Giv'ati, the former commander of 
Judaea, told the commission that the Army's open-fire orders

  [Text] "We must stop the hunt of Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] and Fatah members in the territories, where they live, 
and prepare the transition to the interim arrangements." This 
remark was made yesterday by Shulamit Aloni, minister of 
communications, science, and the arts. She was referring to the 
incident in which ago Six Fatah members who were not wanted by 
the security forces were killed in the Gaza Strip two days ago. 
  Minister Aloni said that "the need to capture another three 
or five people is outweighed by the great effort the IDF and the 
Defense Ministry have been investing in the peace process and 
the implementation of its results. We are the rulers here. We 
have the strongest army in the Middle East. This hunt for 
another two or three terrorists is out of proportion with the 
great thing that should take place here," she said. 
  This recent incident was not initiated by the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces], she said, "because we are about to leave the 
territories. Our role there is nearly over." 
  Aloni noted that the occurrence of such incidents can be 
prevented at this time "provided that the IDF does not initiate 
operations, thus reducing friction between the parties." 
  The minister concluded her remarks by saying that "although, 
in the wake of the incident, there is rage, pain, and a desire 
to take revenge in the territories today, the residents there 
must realize that there is always a tomorrow and a day after, 
and that that day could promise security, liberty, and freedom 
of movement, as well as human, political, and civil rights for 
the residents. We must be patient for the sake of that day."

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Arye Kiesel and David </F>
Regev] 
  [Text] Brigadier General Doron Almog, commander of the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] troops in the Gaza Strip, and Colonel 
Sh., commander of the Gaza Strip northern brigade, have ordered 
the IDF commanders in the Strip to act in the future just as did 
the undercover soldiers who killed six senior Fatah members two 
days ago. There is no other method of operation in a 
confrontation with masked and uniformed persons, the two said. 
  The two also recommended that the commanders of the 
undercover unit give their soldiers a citation of merit for 
their performance. The recommendation was made at the close of 
the full debriefing of the incident. 
  A senior officer who was at the debriefing noted: "We made 
it 
clear to the force that its performance was remarkable. We must 
remember, especially the bleeding hearts, that on Passover eve 
one of our officers was shot in the abdomen and is still in 
grave condition. The undercover unit was praised by the chief 
of staff as well. It is impossible to make a distinction 
between Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]." 
  Following are the findings of the IDF debriefing: 
  -- Two hours before the incident, a hand grenade was thrown 
at the IDF outpost in Jabalyah. 
  -- Over the past two weeks, 11 hand grenades and explosive 
charges were thrown at that post. 
  -- The incident was not initiated by the undercover unit. 
Its task was to guard the outpost. 
  -- The unit spotted six men who were wearing checkered 
uniforms and masks -- in contradiction to the agreements made 
over the past months between the IDF and Fatah. 
  -- The force opened fire at the six, four of whom were 
holding loaded guns in their hands and aiming them at the 
soldiers. 
  Despite the satisfaction in the IDF over the way the 
soldiers 
performed, there is serious embarrassment over the fact that the 
dead men were senior Fatah members who supported the peace 
process. 
  Immediately after the incident, Gen. Almog met with the Gaza 
Strip Fatah commanders. Among others, he met with Sufyan 
Abu-Zayidah. Almog made it clear to Abu-Zayidah that the 
standing IDF orders compelled the soldiers to react the way they 
did. He expressed his regret over the incident, and stated that 
cooperation between Fatah and the IDF should continue. 
  Abu-Zayidah found it hard to accept the remarks: "This was 
one big massacre which could have been prevented," he said. 
"The Army has no business being in Jabalyah. The soldiers 
should not have been there in the first place. These men wanted 
peace very much and supported it." 
  At the end of their meeting, Gen. Almog and Abu-Zayidah 
agreed that operational coordination between Fatah and the IDF 
troops in the Gaza Strip will expand. A cooperation mechanism 
-- a sort of a "hot line" -- may possibly be set up to 
facilitate the exchange of ongoing information between the 
parties. 
  A senior Southern Command officer said yesterday that early 
coordination between Fatah and the IDF could have prevented the 
killing of the six Fatah members. "Let them make no 
accusations," the senior officer said. "Fatah should have 
coordinated the presence of its men in the region. It should 
not have sent armed and uniformed men into the heart of the 
'hot' region. 
  "There have been incidents in the past when we allowed Fatah 
men to stage marches while carrying their guns, as long as this 
was done for their internal purposes. Unnecessary victims can 
be spared when things are coordinated," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Pe'erli Shahar] </F>
  [Excerpts] Political sources in Jerusalem have revealed 
that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will begin withdrawing from 
the Gaza Strip in the second half of April even if by then there 
is no signed agreement with the Palestinians, provided that 
there is momentum of progress in the negotiations. Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres said yesterday that Israel is considering 
the option of starting the transfer of self-authority powers 
over to the Palestinians in Gaza even before ending the 
negotiations and signing the agreement. 
  Senior political sources have recently hinted that this 
option is being seriously considered particularly in view of the 
unrest in the territories expected to take place in the coming 
days of "twilight" when Israel will still be in charge of the 
territories while the locals expect to assume self-government 
authorities. 
  It is obvious that the move will not be made on 13 April, 
which marks Memorial Day for the IDF fallen. The last week of 
April is currently being mentioned. [passage omitted] 
  Palestinian policemen will enter Gaza as soon as the middle 
of next week, in coordination with the IDF forces there. This 
is one of the issues Israeli and PLO representatives agreed on 
in Cairo. Initially, the delegations convened to discuss 
security arrangements in Hebron in view of the Cave of the 
Patriarchs massacre, but the killing of the six senior PLO 
members in Gaza made it necessary to discuss a change in 
security concepts in the Gaza Strip as well. 
  For that reason, Major General Yom-Tov Sami', former 
commander of the IDF in the Gaza Strip, arrived in Cairo 
yesterday. He was party to the decision to formulate new joint 
working procedures in the strip. It has been decided that the 
PLO delegation will arrive in Gaza next week for a first-hand 
examination of the deployment of the forces. Obviously, the 
Palestinian police will be subject to IDF instructions. 
[passage omitted] 
  It is worth mentioning that the members of the delegation 
for 
the discussion on the Gaza and Jericho agreement have arrived in 
Cairo. This team does not include the delegates who discuss 
economic issues.

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>
  [Text] Under agreements achieved yesterday in Cairo, the 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will permit the international force 
due to deploy in Hebron to set up constructions, such as 
observation points and offices. Members of the force will be 
free to drive their cars about and to perform various 
construction-related tasks without IDF intervention. 
  A senior military source said last night that he did not 
think the IDF would be able to complete the Gaza evacuation 
within 72 hours. "The new plan approved by the IDF indicates 
that from the moment the Gaza and Jericho agreement is signed, 
or from 13 April, the IDF will require three weeks to complete 
its withdrawal. We need this time, and we will not be able to 
carry out the task in less time," he said. 
  The military source stressed that the evacuation of Army 
buildings and bases from the Gaza Strip, which was launched in 
recent months, was not a comprehensive evacuation and it did not 
include the evacuation of operational infrastructure. According 
to the IDF plan, no operational troops are to pull out of the 
Strip as long as no agreement has been signed. 
  According to the new plan, the evacuation agenda will be as 
follows: In the first stage, the Hof 'Aza detention facility; 
in the second stage, the hotel in which policemen are quartered; 
later, small bases scattered throughout the Strip; in the fourth 
stage, observation posts and outposts; and in the last stage, 
the division and brigades command. 
  "There will be no actual evacuation until the agreement is 
signed. We are reducing the number of our troops, but not those 
of operational nature," the senior source said yesterday. 
  The implementation of the new evacuation plan began 
yesterday 
with the evacuation of Ansar 2, the Hof 'Aza detention facility. 
The Palestinian detainees and prisoners held in this facility 
will be moved to Qezi'ot prison. The military source said 
yesterday that the whole facility will very soon be handed over 
to the Palestinian police. As soon as the facility is cleared, 
the Army will evacuate the hotel used as night quarters by Gaza 
District policemen and as an office building. 
  Rather than demolish the evacuated buildings, the IDF leaves 
them intact, including their electricity and water mains. The 
IDF has not sold any equipment to the Palestinians, and all the 
equipment will be moved out. The military source said that the 
Army continues the construction of new installations in the 
Qatif Bloc concurrently with the evacuation. Some settlements 
have agreed to the IDF's building the installations inside their 
boundaries. 
  The General Staff Logistics Branch has decided not to call 
up 
extra reserve troops for the evacuation. The evacuation process 
is being assisted by officers who participated in the evacuation 
of the Sinai bases, and an attempt is being made to apply the 
lessons learned there to the Gaza situation. 
  The IDF has begun evacuating facilities in Jericho as well.

Hebron is a red line from the public point of view and that 
following the halakic ruling it is also a halakic red line.

  [Text] The National Religious Party [NRP] Knesset faction 
is against soldiers' disobeying orders, and says that the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] -- including all its forces and echelons 
-- is above the public debate. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht 
reports the decision was made unanimously following a session 
lasting more than four hours. The NRP faction also states that 
a government decision to evacuate Jews from their homes and 
lands in Eretz Yisra'el is a terrible edict which contradicts 
Zionism, Jewish law, and human ethics. The NRP promises to do 
everything within its power to foil such a decision and calls on 
the entire Israeli public to evince passive, nonviolent civil 
resistance to foil such a decision, if it is made.

  [Text] A support rally for the Jewish settlers in Hebron 
and Qiryat Arba' ended in Qiryat Arba' a short time ago. Our 
correspondent Gil Litman reports that many thousands of people 
participated in the rally, among them the heads of the Knesset 
opposition factions and Knesset members [MK's]. The organizers 
distributed registration cards urging participants to defend 
Hebron if a decision is taken to evacuate Jews from the city. 
Border policemen prevented several young Kakh supporters from 
hoisting Kakh flags during the rally. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1600 GMT 31 March, 
reporting on the Qiryat Arba' rally, adds the following: "MK 
Ari'el Sharon, who addressed the massive rally, said that as far 
as he is concerned, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres is no longer 
the foreign minister of the Jewish state, but rather the foreign 
minister of the state of Palestine. According to Sharon the 
Israeli Government is not a Jewish and Zionist government, and 
as far as he is concerned, Shim'on Peres -- who is returning the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho to 'Arafat -- can stay there with the 
head of the PLO." "MK Binyamin Netanyahu called on the audience 
to oppose the evacuation of Jews from Hebron by all legal means 
possible. MK Refa'el Eytan demanded that the government hold 
elections prior to such a move."]

<F P=106> [Report by Tzvi Singer] </F>
  [Text] Volunteers signing up for the Magen Avraham 
[Abraham's Shield] operation -- the campaign aiming "to protect 
Hebron from the danger of Jewish deportation and of Hebron's 
surrender to the enemy" -- are asked to fill out a form which 
includes a question on the possession of weapons. The form is 
been currently distributed in Judaea and Samaria settlements. 
  The Magen Avraham operation, which aims to prevent the 
evacuation of Hebron Jews, is organized by the right-wing bloc's 
operational command. The command is headed by several 
settlement activists, as well as right-wing activists living 
inside the Green Line. In the past, the command played a 
central role in organizing mass right-wing rallies against the 
government. 
  The sign-up form, which was distributed among the attendants 
of the mass rally in Qiryat Arba' yesterday, asks the potential 
volunteers to state their IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
assignment, navigation skills, whether they are paramedics or 
doctors, whether they have a driving license, and whether they 
own a car, a cellular phone, a video camera. 
  The potential volunteer is asked how many kilometers he is 
willing and able to walk, if required, and how many days he is 
prepared to devote to the struggle. The spheres in which 
activists can volunteer are the distribution of leaflets on road 
junctions and in mailboxes, fund raising, poster pasting, 
graphics, marketing, writing and editing, photography, 
lecturing, and other areas.

<F P=106> ["Issue and Opinion" column by Salamah 'Ukur: "No to U.S. </F>
Blockade"] 
  [Text] In the first American reaction to His Majesty King 
Husayn's remarks about the U.S. blockade of Jordan, a State 
Department spokesman said his country will likely reconsider its 
approach rather than lift the siege altogether. 
  It would seem our information minister does not mind our 
ships being inspected at the Port of al-'Aqabah instead of the 
Suez Canal or further out at sea. At his news conference, Jawad 
al-'Anani simply criticized the checking procedure itself. 
  Inspection of the ships at the Port of al-'Aqabah is a 
blockade, pure and simple. Is there any reason the blockade 
should remain??!!! And what justification is there to inspect 
incoming ships carrying goods intended for Jordan?!! 
  By way of justifying the blockade of al-'Aqabah Port, the 
pressure being applied on Jordan, the extreme inconveniences it 
is experiencing, and the high cost to Jordan's national economy, 
the U.S. Administration argues that it wants to ensure that the 
goods aboard incoming ships do not find their way to blockaded 
Iraq. If that is the intention, why are the ships bound for 
Iran and Turkey -- both with borders with Iraq -- not subjected 
to the same routine??!! 
  We are aware that the U.S. Administration encourages trade 
between Turkey and Iraq as a reward for Turkey's shameful stand 
in the second Gulf war. We are also aware that Washington, 
grateful for Iran's stance during the 30-state aggression, 
avoids even a mere reference to Iraqi-Iranian relations. 
  The U.S. Administration is keen not to provoke Iran at this 
stage lest it lurch into the anti-American camp. 
  It is possible, then, that there are reasons and pretexts 
other than those advanced by the U.S. Administration to explain 
its unfair blockade of Jordan. 
  His Majesty King Husayn, acknowledged for his foresight, has 
exposed the intentions harbored by the U.S. Administration 
against Jordan. 
  To quote his majesty, the United States wishes to press 
Jordan into signing a unilateral and immediate peace treaty with 
Israel even before the border dispute or such issues as occupied 
Jordanian territory and misappropriated Jordanian waters are 
sorted out. The U.S. Administration wants to see Jordan lead 
the way for the Arabs in the matter of ending the Arab boycott 
of Israel. 
  Seeing that Jordan is not about to oblige Washington on 
these 
Israeli-inspired demands, the U.S. Administration is attempting 
to twist Jordan's arms and force it down on its knees. 
  It is an exercise in self-delusion for the U.S. 
Administration to think that Jordan, with its limited resources 
as they are, will go down on its knees and abandon its occupied 
territory, water, and stolen rights. Endowed with such 
leadership as the Hashemites, Jordan will kneel only to God. 
  The U.S. Administration is denying Jordan its peacemaking 
and 
stabilizing role in the Middle East. However, let it be known 
that, limited resources notwithstanding, Jordan can still play 
havoc with the peace process and neutralize or even end the U.S. 
role in it. With America's Israeli bias now absolute and 
hostility toward the Arab nation undisguised, Jordan's stand is 
all the more understandable. 
  The Palestinian leadership may have been ensnared by the 
U.S. 
Administration into the Oslo, Cairo, and Davos agreements -- by 
all standards unilateral and unfair. Jordan, however, will not 
be coerced into accepting anything that falls short of its 
satisfaction or that of future Jordanian, Arab, and Muslim 
generations. 
  Let it be known by the U.S. Administration that, as far as a 
peace treaty with Israel is concerned, Jordan will synchronize 
its moves with Syria and Lebanon. For us, peace has to be 
comprehensive, based on UN resolutions and an Israeli withdrawal 
from all the occupied territories, including Jerusalem, or it 
can wait. And, just for the record, certain Gulf oil states, 
while maintaining a boycott of Jordan and building bridges with 
Israel, are doing so at the behest of the United States.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Will Washington Lift The Siege on Jordan </F>
During April?"] 
  [Text] Since the negotiations on the Jordanian and other 
tracks are scheduled to resume in April, the U.S. Administration 
must reconsider its siege of Jordan. This is especially true 
because His Majesty King Husayn linked Jordan's participation in 
the negotiations with the lifting of the siege imposed on the 
Port of al-'Aqabah. 
  It is true that President Bill Clinton yesterday affirmed 
that the negotiations on the Jordanian, Syrian, and Lebanese 
tracks will resume in April as scheduled. However, it is also 
true that the continuation of the U.S. siege of the Port of 
al-'Aqabah will obstruct the resumption of the negotiations on 
the Jordanian track. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Christopher promised to take 
measures 
to assist Jordan in facing the siege. However, the U.S. stand 
on the siege has yet to change. This U.S. stand needs to be 
seriously reconsidered in a way that is in keeping with Jordan's 
seriousness about stopping negotiations if the siege continues. 
In other words, the U.S. Administration should respect Jordan's 
interests and stop trying to harm its economy and trade by 
continuing the unjust siege. The U.S. Administration should 
realize that Jordan will not submit to unjustified pressures and 
harassments. 
  The U.S. Administration should review its recent stand on 
the 
identity of Jerusalem and should not disavow its Arabism. It 
should appreciate His Majesty King Husayn's historic concern 
about the Arabism of Jerusalem. This is especially so since all 
the Security Council resolutions on which the peace process is 
based stipulate that Jerusalem is an integral part of the 
occupied Arab territories. 
  Moreover, Israel's decision to annex Arab Jerusalem is 
unrecognized by legitimate international bodies, leb by the 
Security Council itself. 
  The U.S. Administration is fully aware of the burdens Jordan 
has been shouldering as a result of the Gulf crisis and the 
serious economic and social losses it has been suffering on all 
levels. 
  However, instead of compensating Jordan for its large 
losses, 
the U.S. Administration continued the siege, with the intention 
of causing more harm to its economy and trade. The U.S. 
Administration is doing this in an attempt to force Jordan to 
abandon the constants of its principled stands.

  [Text] France is pushing for a United Nation's resolution 
regarding the easing of sanctions on the Gulf of Aqaba, the 
French Ambassador in Amman Mr. Bernard Bajolet told THE STAR's

only interested in seeing sanctions work against Iraq, and not 
in creating hardships for Jordan. He added that "Jordan's 
suggestion of allowing UN inspection of ships only once they 
reached shore and not on the high seas was very reasonable," and 
that "France along with its European partners are taking the 
Jordanian suggestion very seriously and presently discussing 
it." The ambassador said the French navy is participating in UN 
inspection of ships heading for Aqaba along with the Americans.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Reaffirmation of the Jordanian Stand"] </F>
  [Text] Jordan's clear and brave stand on the Gulf of Aqaba 
siege issue, expressed by His Majesty King Husayn to the 
ambassadors of the five permanent Security Council states, 
continues to echo in the Jordanian arena and in the Arab and 
international arenas, as well. His majesty the leader linked 
the resumption of Jordan's role in the peace process to ending 
search operations and harassment by warships in the Red Sea. 
  Jordan's concern about its independence and dignity and 
about 
exercising its full sovereignty is not any less than its concern 
about achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region -- 
a peace that provides stability and is conducive to growth, 
progress, and development for all the people in the region. 
  Yesterday, King Husayn reiterated the historic role Jordan 
has been playing during the past decades in terms of defending 
the Palestinian Arab people's rights to restoring their 
territories and to wrenching their right to self-determination. 
During his meeting with the Palestinian president's envoy, his 
majesty expressed Jordan's adherence to the Arab right to 
protect the holy places and to Arab sovereignty over Jerusalem. 
  The Palestinian president's envoy hailed His Majesty King 
Husayn's role in maintaining the Arabism of Jerusalem and its 
holy places. He appreciated Jordan's stand toward the 
Palestinian cause, people, and their fate. This blocks the road 
of anyone trying to cast doubts on the Arabism of the holy city 
and the right to sovereignty over it and on Jordan's decisive 
and clear stand on the religious, historic, geographic, and 
physical aspects of Jerusalem. One is wrong to think that Jordan 
will allow a claim of sovereignty over Jerusalem by anyone other 
than almighty God. The fact that Jordan and its Hashemite 
leadership have adopted the caring, protection, and maintenance 
of the holy places throughout all these decades does not leave 
room for anyone to harbor bad or good intentions. 
  In any case, Jordan will continue to shoulder the Arab and 
Palestinian concern. Despite the difficulties and challenges it 
faced, Jordan will continue to be the Hashemite Arab fortress 
that does not relinquish a single right or give up any of its 
principled national and pan-Arab stands on the issue of 
Palestine; on issues of harassment, siege, and inspection; and 
on various pressures exerted on it. Jordan is a free and 
independent homeland with its own mission. Its sons have their 
own ambitions and hopes of keeping their homeland impregnable 
and their people free and lofty.

  [Text] Minister of State of Foreign Affair Mr. Talal 
al-Hasan has conferred with the Danish delegation [of the 
Foreign Policy Association in Denmark which is currently 
visiting Jordan]. The minister explained the efforts Jordan is 
making under the leadership of his majesty the king to advance 
the peace process in the region and to achieve just, durable, 
and comprehensive peace in accordance with the international 
legitimacy, represented in Security Council Resolutions 242 and 
338. He said this is also based on the principle of bartering 
land for peace, as well as safeguarding the rights of the 
Palestinian Arab people on their national soil. It is also 
based on safeguarding Jordan's rights as far as land, water, 
security, and the resolution of the refugee problem. 
  The minister said the blockade imposed on the Gulf of Aqaba 
is leaving a negative impact on the Jordanian economy. He said 
his majesty the king is making persistent efforts to secure the 
lifting of the blockade. These efforts included a meeting 
between his majesty and the ambassadors of the five permanent 
members of the Security Council. His majesty told the 
ambassadors that this question should be dealt with as quickly 
as possible, and that there is no justification for this 
blockade, particularly that Jordan has been constructively 
cooperating with the peace efforts in the region. 
  Mr. al-Hasan said that the massacre committed by Jewish 
settlers in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron has undermined the 
peace process in the region. He added that the international 
community should shoulder its responsibilities to prevent the 
recurrence of such a crime and to secure the necessary 
protection for the Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
  Mr. al-Hasan pointed out that the Israeli settlements are 
dangerous to the peace process and should be removed, and the 
Israeli occupation should be ended if we were to achieve just, 
comprehensive, and durable peace in the region. Mr. al-Hasan 
commended the good relations existing between Jordan and Denmark 
in all fields, pointing in particular to the relationship of 
friendship and mutual respect that exist between His Majesty 
King Husayn and the monarch of Denmark. 
  The Danish guests said they were very appreciative of the 
great role Jordan is playing in giving momentum to the Middle 
East peace process and achieving peace, security, and stability 
in the region. 
  The meeting was attended by the Danish ambassador in Amman 
and the honorary consul of Denmark in Amman.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has said 
that a solution to the Middle East problem must be 
comprehensive, prevail throughout in the entire region, and 
include all parties. He added that this solution must not be a 
divided or a phased one. He stressed that the main topic on the 
Jordanian track is represented by restoring the occupied 
Jordanian territory, whose area is more than 350 km square, in 
addition to restoring Jordan's share of water, which was seized 
by Israel in the late fifties and in the early sixties, as well 
as the major part of the al-Yarmuk River water which it seized. 
  Addressing a delegation of the Foreign Policy Association in 
Denmark, the prime minister added that when it addresses the 
issue of peace, Jordan is not thinking of war, and that Jordan 
has joined the peace process out of its awareness of the 
importance of peace, which should provide gains for all parties, 
whether these gains are material or moral, immediate or deferred 
ones. 
  Dr. al-Majali reviewed the history of the Arab-Israeli 
conflict and the changes in the region and the world after the 
end of the Cold War, as well as the spread of new concepts in 
the world, which have introduced changes in the strategies of 
the United States and the Arabs. However, Israel took some time 
to adapt to the new situation away from the concepts of war, he 
added. 
  He said: The process of change and the time required for 
this has been exhausted by Israel. The prime minister also 
reviewed Jordan's efforts to guarantee the Palestinians' 
participation in the peace talks, and to provide them with an 
umbrella through the joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. He 
also touched on the obstacles Jordan has faced, beginning with 
the Jordanian-Israeli talks, and ending with the signing of the 
joint agenda, which included basic elements defining the 
objective of the negotiations; namely, the realization of a 
lasting and comprehensive peace, as well as the pillars of 
building mutual confidence in the future. 
  Answering a question, the prime minister said: We cannot 
talk about the establishment of regional cooperative 
institutions before achieving peace. This is in order to avert 
the occurrence of problems in the future, taking into 
consideration that the original problem of the Middle East 
situation lies in the fact that Israelis have the land, while 
the Palestinians do not have it. 
  Answering another question, he said: The refugees issue 
constitutes the biggest price Jordan has had to pay for peace 
since 1950 when the Palestinians decided to unite with Jordan to 
establish one state, something which was exploited by the 
Israelis. Jordan's stand toward this can be summed up by the 
fact that everyone who lives here is a Jordanian citizen whose 
political rights in his mother homeland are safeguarded as 
agreed upon in the 1950 unity agreement. This is one of the 
reasons that most of the refugees are still living in camps.

<F P=106> [Report by Shafiq al-Asadi: "Abu Dhabi Denies Qaddumi Made </F>
Visit"] 
  [Text] Abu Dhabi -- Diplomatic sources in Abu Dhabi have 
denied that PLO Political Department head Faruq Qaddumi paid an 
official visit to Abu Dhabi and held talks with officials there 
on the situation in the Middle East and the Palestinian issue. 
The sources said they had no knowledge of such a visit. 
  Well-informed sources have told AL-HAYAH that Qaddumi 
stopped 
over on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning at Dubai international 
airport en route from Cairo to the Far East to visit a number of 
states there. 
  They added that Qaddumi, who stopped over at Dubai airport 
for about an hour, made some telephone calls to some Palestinian 
embassy officials in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The sources expect 
Qaddumi to stop over at Dubai airport when he returns from east 
Asia. The sources stressed they had no knowledge of the 
possibility of his making an official visit to the United Arab 
Emirates [UAE] soon. 
  Qaddumi's stopover at Dubai airport does not carry any 
political indications, as President Yasir 'Arafat too stopped 
over at Abu Dhabi international airport last year while en route 
from Jakarta and Turkey. 
  Observers point out that official contacts between Abu Dhabi 
and the PLO were limited to the contacts with PLO Executive 
Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin), who visited it on 
two occasions, the more recent of which was after the signing of 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement in Washington on 13 September. 
During this visit he met with senior UAE officials, first and 
foremost Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, the head of state.

  [Excerpt] In his Friday prayer sermons, Ayatollah Mohammad 
Yazdi referred to the Day of God, 12 Farvardin [1 April], the 
anniversary of the establishment of the Islamic republic system, 
and described it as the day of sovereignty of justice and Islam. 
He stressed: The true gratefulness for such a great blessing 
can be shown through support for the Islamic government and its 
principles and inspirations. 
  He referred to the historic vote of the Muslim nation of 
Iran 
for the Islamic republic system and added: The participation of 
the people in the general process of the Islamic system and 
their determining its structure is a principle which has 
prevailed since the victory of the Islamic revolution. 
  The head of the judiciary branch explained the 
characteristics of the Islamic Republic system and said: Such 
form of government is still unknown to the world and for that 
reason the dimensions and philosophy of its structure should be 
further introduced to the people of the world. 
  The head of the judiciary branch also called for a 
principled 
solution to the hajj problem. He said that the problem should 
be solved in a mutual way. The Saudi Government should be made 
aware and the problem explained to its officials in order to 
find a fundamental solution to the problem of the hajj. 
  He referred to the possibility of a number of Iranian 
volunteers going to hajj from other countries, and said: If a 
person holds a passport and a valid visa, then there should be 
no problem for going to hajj from other countries, and people 
should not be limited for no reason. 
  Ayatollah Yazdi also called for a specific reply by the 
government of Armenia on the downing of an Iranian C-130 
aircraft over Karabakh. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, March 31, IRNA -- The Persian daily ABRAR in 
a commentary Thursday raised the likelihood of Moscow's 
involvement in the downing of the Iranian passenger plane near 
Stepanakert in Armenian controlled Karabakh on March 17. 
  It said that previously when other passenger planes happened 
to fly over the area Moscow would immediately inform the 
commander of Armenian forces of the scheduled flight over the 
airspace of Armenia to make sure that the plane would not be 
shot down, but that in the case of the Iranian plane none of the 
navigation systems in the region operated as responsibly as they 
should have. The commentary also noted that immediately after 
the news of the downing of the plane broke out on the media 
Moscow suggested that the Iranian passenger plane had been 
flying over the region for reconnaissance purposes. 
  "The Russians having been traditionally slow in their 
responses to current developments, their unwonted haste in 
publicizing that suggestion makes their purpose all too 
transparent," it added. 
  The C-130 bound for Tehran from Moscow with families of 
Iranian diplomats in Russia on board, exploded in mid air and 
crashed in Karabakh moments after it contacted Yerevan airport 
control tower at 19:10 hours GMT. There were no survivors among 
the 32 passengers and crew including 17 women on board. After 
due investigations by an expert sent to the site of the crash by 
Iran, the Foreign Ministry has confirmed that the plane was 
missiled down by Armenian troops. 
  The commentary in ABRAR said "whether the downing of the 
Iranian plane was the result merely of negligence on the part of 
the systems in Armenia or it was imposed on that country as a 
plot, Armenia would do itself good to evaluate the mishap 
independent of the insinuations of the outsiders and assume 
responsibility for it, and do something by way of appeasing her 
neighbor Iran." 
  "Or else," the paper warned, "the incident will remain for 
ever a thorny issue in the relations between Armenia and her 
neighbor Iran."

<F P=106> [Speech by leader Mu'ammar Al-Qadhdhafi in Bani Walid on 29 </F>
March -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Brothers, the rumors of colonialism and 
appendices of colonialism, and the attempts of colonialism are 
smashed today on the steadfast and proud mountains of Wadi 
Dinar, on the mountains of Bani Walid just as they were in the 
Italian era, brothers. Today, brothers, we challenge the 
enemies from Wadi Dinar in Bani Walid, the Wadi where the blood 
of martyrs had flowed, the martyrs of Bani Walid who fought the 
Italian army which was stronger in number and equipment and 
material. The free voice, the voice of defiance rises from Bani 
Walid, from Wadi Dinar. Our voice rises, brothers, in defiance 
of the agents, the disreputed American intelligence, and we 
challenge America with its might. We are stronger than it 
because we have the right to our land and we have the right to 
live freely, proudly, under the sun and on the land of our 
fathers and ancestors, which was irrigated by their blood, 
brothers. 
  Brothers, from this sacred valley, in which the blood of 
your 
martyr fathers and grandfathers of Bani Walid flowed, our voice 
rises with defiance, and we announce the destruction of the 
conspiracies of America, its hirelings, its intelligence 
service, its rumors, and its [word indistinct]. 
  Brothers, we are destroying their rumors as we have 
destroyed 
their armies in this valley. 
  Brothers, sons of Bani Walid, grandsons of the martyr 
(?Gulbar) hero of Afya battle, sons of Bani Walid, grandsons of 
the martyr al- Sadiq (?Buli), hero of (?Tagirbit) battle, you 
must remain faithful to the blood that flowed in Dinar valley to 
defend the freedom of Libya, to defend Pan-Arabism and to defend 
Islam, the religion of Pan-Arabism. You must remain faithful to 
the blood that flowed in [words indistinct] against Turkish 
colonialism. 
  [passage omitted] Brothers, today Bani Walid's role has come 
to line up in the preparation battle, in the defiant battle 
against the international encroachment and haughtiness 
(?practised) by America and its allies. In this Wadi we did not 
fear Italy's legions and we smashed Italy's arrogance in Wadi 
Dinar. [passage omitted] 
  Now, we declare that, once again, we are ready for 
confrontation and defiance in Wadi Dinar, in Zaytouna, and 
everywhere in our land, to face up to a new confrontation 
against new colonialism. We are the sons, the grandsons of 
those people whose blood flowed in this Wadi. Brothers, we will 
be faithful to this blood. 
  Today, brothers, Bani Walid's voice is raised in the defiant 
battle as long as colonialism points its rifles against the 
chest of each son of our people, and as long as colonialism 
targets the freedom of every area of this homeland. Wirfallah 
[a tribe, members of which were accused of spying] cannot but 
line up in the battle of glory, pride, defiance, and 
independence. It is a battle of independence, a battle of 
awakening of the Arab nation from the Ocean to the Gulf. 
  Your shouts at Wadi Dinar and Bani Walid will not go unheard 
and in vain; today the whole Arab nation, from the Atlantic to 
the Gulf, is hearing your shouts. These shouts represent a 
boost for the Palestinian militants and thousands of 
Palestinians kept inside the prisons of the Israeli forces of 
occupation. Your shouts raise the morale of Lebanese fighters, 
fighters of the Somali people, and all militants of the Arab 
nation to liberate the occupied territories that stretch from 
Ceuta and Melilla to the usurped Palestine. Brothers, this voice 
emanating from Wadi Dinar and Bani Walid is being heard by the 
whole Arab nation. 
  From this position, from the sacred Wadi Dinar, we invite 
Warfalah to take a leading role and mobilize itself for 
confrontation, as we always expect it to do. It should lead the 
confrontation to defend the dignity, honor, and the whole 
nation. Brothers, we will never give up, and history will never 
be able to record that we have abdicated our duties. We are the 
sons of the district [word indistinct], the sons of the martyrs 
and heroes. History will never be able to write that we have not 
responded to the call for the preparation for confrontation. 
  Bani Walid will never miss the opportunity and will answer 
the call of the holy war, the call for the confrontation against 
the United States and the allies of the United States. Cursed 
are those agents: the traitors, the cowards, those who gave up 
and bowed, those who sold their country to others. Cursed are 
the pitiful cowards. Glory and honor for these revolutionaries, 
these brave people, the sons of Bani Walid who march today in 
Wadi Dinar to announce their collective pledge. Bani Walid is a 
fortress of defiance, Bani Walid is a fortress of steadfastness, 
Bani Walid is a fortress of confrontation. The struggle 
continues, and victory is inevitable, brothers. Forward we 
march until the sun of liberty shines on the whole Arab world, 
from the Atlantic to the Gulf. Forward we go and may the 
struggle continue.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz by an </F>
unidentified NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent in Beirut on 31 
March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] How would you describe the current 
situation in the peace process? Is it true that U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher will visit Lebanon? 
  [Buwayz] The latest round of [Arab-Israeli] negotiations, 
undoubtedly, was somewhat deadlocked. Mr. Christopher's 
upcoming visit to the region is supposed to get things going by 
securing some points to encourage the resumption of the 
negotiations. Anyway, I believe that progress on the 
Palestinian track would push forward the other topics on the 
agenda of the negotiations. 
  [Correspondent] Will Lebanon demand that Christopher visit 
it 
within his tour? 
  [Buwayz] We do not demand; we welcome anyone who visits 
Lebanon or deals with it as it should be dealt with. 
  [Correspondent] How do you explain what was achieved between 
the Palestinians and the Israelis in Cairo today? Does this 
mean the beginning of progress on the Gaza-Jericho track? 
  [Buwayz] The Gaza-Jericho agreement, naturally, had some 
weak 
points. Any action that will in one way or another fill this 
vacuum and satisfy the Palestinians will be welcome. So far, I 
believe that only the incorporation of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement into a comprehensive peace process can cover this 
agreement in the best way. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, how is Lebanese diplomacy 
handling the current Israeli acts of aggression against the 
south? 
  [Buwayz] Lebanon and Israel have been in a state of crisis 
for a long time. This crisis has not at any point stopped 
progress in the Middle East talks. Just as Israel did not stop 
its repeated aggressions, Lebanon conceded neither its right to 
confront and resist the aggression nor its right to use all 
political and diplomatic means to confront it. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, as regards media, the public 
is under the impression that it should (?wait), and the Chamber 
of Deputies was inclined to ask the government to suspend its 
decision [on banning news programs on private radios] until the 
media law is issued. What do you think? 
  [Buwayz] I clearly and realistically believe that it is 
necessary to think of democracy and freedom on one hand, and 
security and stability on the other, and take the requirements 
of both into consideration. Talking about returning the media 
to the old situation; that is, the return of more than 50 
television stations and more than 100 radio stations is 
impossible for any country, no matter how much democracy and 
freedom it has, to tolerate and accept. But I also believe that 
talking about one official station and closing the door to the 
development of media -- and they actually have developed over 
the past 20 years -- when a number of Stalinist countries have 
renounced Stalinism, may be wrong. We need to lay down a 
framework to reshuffle all these broadcasting stations so that 
we can find a number acceptable to Lebanon's security and order 
and satisfying the Lebanese people's ambitions for democracy and 
freedom. I believe that four or five television stations and 
four or five radio stations -- controlled by the valid laws on 
sectarian sedition, insults to Lebanese or foreign officials, 
and provocation of the sentiments of the public -- may be a 
realistic solution that reconciles Lebanon's democracy, which 
has always been an integral part of the Lebanese situation and 
entity, and security requirements. We cannot ignore the fact 
that Lebanon is living on a sensitive Middle East volcano and 
cannot tolerate disorder, which no democratic country allows.

  [Text] Cairo, March 31 (AFP) -- The following is the text 
of the Israeli-PLO agreement signed in Cairo Thursday [31 March]. 
  Joint communique, Cairo, March 31, 1994 
  On March 31, 1994, the Israeli and Palestinian delegations 
reached an agreement on security arrangements for Hebron and on 
the immediate resumption of the Gaza and Jericho area 
negotiations. 
  The two sides have agreed on a set of measures which 
include, 
inter alia, a temporary international presence in Hebron to 
assist in promoting stability and restoring normal life in the 
city and on modalities for resuming negotiations on Gaza and 
Jericho. The two sides have also agreed on a gradual movement 
of Palestinian policemen into Gaza and the Jericho area, 
starting next week. 
  The two delegations have also set out an agreed agenda in 
order to accelerate their negotiations and the implementation 
with the objective of making up for lost time. Israel agreed to 
shorten the withdrawal schedule and accelerate the withdrawal, 
being guided by the target dates set in the DOP (Declaration of 
Principles). 
  The two sides have expressed their strong resolve to pursue 
their negotiations in order to reach agreement as soon as 
possible. 
  The Israeli and Palestinian delegations express their 
gratitude to President Mubarak, his government and the Egyptian 
people for the assistance and hospitality they bestowed. 
  Finally, the Israeli and Palestinian delegations express 
their hope that the measures taken will ensure success in their 
efforts to reach a real peace and co-existence. 
  Agreement: 
  In the aftermath of the horrendous massacre in Hebron, and 
in 
response to the heightened needs of the Palestinians for 
security throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and 
particularly in Hebron and in accordance with (UN) Security 
Council Resolution 904, delegations of Israel and the PLO met 
and agreed to take the measures set out in this Agreement. 
  As soon as this Agreement is signed, its implementation will 
begin and the Gaza-Jericho negotiations will be resumed, as set 
out below. 
  A. Temporary International Presence in the City of Hebron. 
  1. In response to the unique situation created in Hebron in 
the aftermath of the massacre, a temporary international 
presence will be established in the city of Hebron ("TIPH"). As 
detailed in paragraph A.3 below, the TIPH will assist in 
promoting stability and in monitoring and reporting the efforts 
to restore normal life in the city of Hebron, thus creating a 
feeling of security among Palestinians in the city of Hebron. 
  2. The two sides shall request the donor countries to 
provide 160 persons, citizens of Norway, Denmark and Italy, as 
TIPH personnel, consisting of field observers, office staff and 
support personnel, as agreed between the two sides. Changes in 
the composition of the TIPH may be made from among the donor 
countries with the consent of both sides. Consistent with its 
stated tasks, the TIPH personnel shall have no military or 
police functions. 
  3. The tasks of TIPH personnel will be: 
  a. to provide by their presence a feeling of security to the 
Palestinians of Hebron, 
  b. to help promote stability and an appropriate 
environment conducive to the enhancement of the well-being of 
the Palestinians of Hebron and their economic development, 
  c. to monitor the efforts to restore the safety of 
Palestinians and events affecting it and the return to normal 
life in the city of Hebron, and 
  d. to provide reports as set out in paragraph A.5 below. 
  4. In order to facilitate the carrying out of TIPH tasks, a 
building will be chosen in the city of Hebron as a seat for the 
TIPH. 
  5. The TIPH will report to the following: 
  a. on specific events -- to a Joint Hebron Committee 
("JHC"), comprised of two representatives from each side. The 
senior Palestinian representative will be the Mayor of Hebron 
and the senior Israeli representative will be the head of the 
Civil Administration in the District of Hebron. A 
representative of the TIPH will be invited on a bi-weekly basis 
to participate in the JHC meeting in order to report on the TIPH 
activities. 
  b. periodically -- to the Joint Israeli-Palestinian Liaison 
Committee established pursuant to the DOP. 
  In addition, the TIPH will provide periodic reports to the 
Chair of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee of the Donors. 
  6. The members of the TIPH shall wear distinctive uniforms 
with a special emblem, as agreed by the two sides, and their 
vehicles shall be marked with the same emblem. TIPH members may 
carry pistols for self-defence purposes. 
  7. The TIPH will enjoy freedom of movement for the 
performance of its tasks within the city of Hebron. Such 
freedom of movement shall not be restricted, except for reasons 
of imperative military necessity, and then only as an 
exceptional and temporary measure. 
  8. The TIPH will establish the modalities of its presence 
and activity with the agreement of the two sides, with due 
regard being given to its aforementioned tasks. 
  9. The expenses of the TIPH will be borne by the donor 
countries. 
  10. The TIPH may commence its operation immediately after 
the signing of this Agreement and continue to function for a 
period of three months. With the consent of the two sides, the 
TIPH may extend the period or change the scope of its operation, 
as agreed. 
  B. The Gaza-Jericho Negotiations. 
  1. The Gaza-Jericho negotiations shall be resumed in Cairo 
on Thursday, March 31, 1994. These negotiations shall be 
accelerated with the objective of making up for lost time. 
  2. Israel agrees to shorten the withdrawal schedule and 
accelerate the withdrawal, being guided by the target dates set 
in the DOP. 
  3. Immediately after the conclusion of the Gaza-Jericho 
Agreement, early empowerment negotiations will commence, and the 
two sides will explore possible expansion of the scope of these 
negotiations beyond the five spheres. 
  4. The two sides will intensify the negotiations on the 
interim arrangements consistent with the DOP and guided by its 
target date. 
  5. The two sides reiterate their commitment to commence 
permanent status negotiations as soon as possible, but not later 
than the beginning of the third year of the interim period, as 
provided for in Article V of the DOP. 
  6. Gradual movement into Gaza and Jericho of Palestinian 
policemen will start one week after the resumption of the 
Gaza-Jericho negotiations, in order to commence preparations for 
assuming powers and responsibilities, as agreed by the two sides.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Palestinian negotiator Dr. Sa'ib </F>
'Urayqat by Sa'id Mu'addi on 31 March, place not given; from the 
"With the Events" program; --recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, at last an agreement 
on security arrangements in Hebron was signed in Cairo today. 
Do you believe that these arrangements ensure the security of 
the Palestinians in Hebron? 
  ['Urayqat] In fact, there are causes for the problem in 
Hebron. The root of the problem is the existence of settlers in 
the heart of the city of Hebron. I fear that without the 
evacuation of the settlement hotbeds from the heart of Hebron, 
the problem will remain and could explode despite any measures. 
  [Mu'addi] Will the arrival of international observers from 
Norway, Belgium, and Italy ease friction between the settlers 
and Arab residents in Hebron? 
  ['Urayqat] The question is not one of easing anyone's 
worries. The question is one of finding a fundamental solution 
to this issue. This would be achieved by tackling its roots. 
First, the root of the problem is the presence of settlers. 
Settlers must be evacuated from Hebron. Second, there are 
questions that must be addressed, such as what authority these 
international forces will come under, what their jurisdiction 
will be, what their responsibilities will be, until when will 
they submit their reports, and how will they implement their 
measures and orders. In fact, we do not know the details of all 
these matters. However, the problem will remain as long as the 
settlement hotbeds exist in Hebron or anywhere else. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Urayqat, will signing the agreement on 
arrangements in Hebron help complete the measures regarding the 
Gaza-Jericho plan? 
  ['Urayqat] We have always emphasized that the negotiations 
are not an end in themselves. After the Hebron massacre, unless 
the settlement subject is placed at the top of the agenda, it is 
unreasonable to expect any negotiations to lead to the hoped-for 
just, comprehensive, durable peace, a peace based on Resolution 
242. I fear that unless the main problem, represented by 
settlement activity, is resolved, the arrangements that have 
been agreed upon may lead to further future complications. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Urayqat, concerning the bilateral 
negotiations, has the Palestinian side received an invitation to 
go to Washington next month? 
  ['Urayqat] No. The Palestinian side has not received any 
invitations. The negotiations which took place in Tunis and 
Cairo dealt with providing protection for the Palestinian people 
in accordance with Resolution 904. However, it seems that the 
basic issue and the root of the problem, which is the settlement 
existence, has not been tackled. This will have negative 
consequences in the future. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, thank you very much. 
  ['Urayqat] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Before It Is Too Late," the 
newspaper AL-THAWRAH comments on developments in the peace 
process, and Israel's procrastination and maneuvering, which aim 
to create additional excuses for evading the requirements of 
peace and derail the peace process. The paper says: Now that 
there is renewed talk of the possible resumption of the peace 
talks, Israel has demonstrated an enthusiastic excitement about 
the peace process. While focusing its attention on the 
implementation of the Gaza- Jericho accord, which yielded 
countless advantages in its favor, Israel seeks to play games on 
the other tracks of the negotiations. Israel reaped the fruits 
of games with the Palestinians when it concluded the Oslo accord 
with them. This is because this accord contains serious and 
secret loopholes that allowed Israel to pounce upon the 
Palestinians, who departed from the overall inter-Arab 
coordination regarding the peace process. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: Israel is certain that it cannot ensnare 
any other Arab side by making it depart from the Arab consensus 
regarding the need to achieve a just and comprehensive peace. 
Nonetheless, it has continued to make desperate attempts in this 
regard. If anything, this policy indicates that Israel is not 
concerned with just, comprehensive, and durable peace. This is 
because such peace is the antithesis of the expansionist Israeli 
scheme and its Zionist objectives, which aim to achieve a 
version of peace that allows Israel to have peace, and, at the 
same time, retain its control over the territories. 
  The paper adds that Israel is only interested in the 
benefits 
it can draw from the peace process, particularly since it has 
continued to evade any discussion of substantive issues in the 
bilateral talks, namely, the issues of occupation and withdrawal. 
  Concluding its commentary, the paper says: The solution, as 
all observers believe, lies in activating the role of the United 
States as a full partner that should honor its pledges and 
commitments, particularly since it is the party that launched 
the peace initiative in the first place. Otherwise, the peace 
process will be jeopardized, and the region will remain 
vulnerable to worst case scenarios. 
  Under the headline "Israel's Crimes Before the International 
Community," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher has reiterated his willingness to make 
a fresh tour of the region to activate the peace process, 
without committing himself to a forceful role in efforts to 
address the Arab-Israeli conflict. It was no coincidence that 
Christopher's offer came in the aftermath of Israeli attacks on 
southern Lebanon and amidst the thunder of bullets that kill and 
wound scores of Palestinians of the occupied Arab territories 
every day. That is why he has absolved himself of any 
undertaking to play a forceful role. He is well aware that 
progress in the peace process is now contingent upon the Israeli 
stand, which seeks to obstruct the regional peace process. 
  The paper believes that Israel aims to encircle the new 
peace 
opportunity that could be created if the peace talks are resumed 
in Washington. The paper notes that in addition to political 
maneuvering and foot-dragging, Israel has begun to carry out a 
series of successive massacres that started with the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre. This series of massacres is continuing. 
Israel is now covering up its massacres with fresh ones, as 
manifested in the Sayyidat al-Najat Church blast in Lebanon. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: By so doing, the Rabin government seeks to 
distract those concerned with the peace process. It wants to 
prompt them to address the new problems it is creating. Nobody 
will be taken in by this policy, which has been stepped up 
recently, particularly in the aftermath of the Geneva summit. 
It is difficult for the Rabin government, regardless of the 
tactics it is employing, to influence the course of the peace 
negotiations, or to derail them. 
  Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH says: International 
efforts to advance the peace process and resume the Washington 
negotiations have become extremely necessary to end regional 
tension and halt the Israeli anti-Arab terrorism, repression, 
and massacres.

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Al-Asad To Visit Iran Next </F>
Month and Might Mediate Between It and Algeria"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- Syrian political sources have announced 
that President Hafiz al-Asad will visit Iran for summit talks 
with Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani on international, 
regional, Islamic, and Arab issues. 
  The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the visit will take 
place in the second half of next April. They said that the 
meeting will be of some importance at Arab and international 
levels in view of the international changes and their effect on 
the region and also because of the peace process and its 
possible results. 
  The sources added that the Syrian-Iranian summit will also 
cover the Geneva summit results and President Hafiz al-Asad's 
talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on peace affairs and the 
region, the Gulf, the situation in Iran, and Iran's relations 
with other states. They said that al-Asad might mediate between 
Iran and Algeria in an attempt to improve relations. 
Syrian-Iranian relations are believed to be strategic. They 
have been allies with special ties characterized by depth and 
continuity. Iran realizes to what extent these constant 
relations with Syria have enhanced Iran's relations with the 
Arab world and especially the Gulf states. President al-Asad's 
clear pan-Arab policies have succeeded in settling more than one 
dispute between Arab states and Iran, including the dispute with 
the United Arab Emirates [UAE] over the three islands and 
problems in Iran's relations with some Arab states such as Egypt 
and Algeria. The sources said that President al-Asad will 
convey to President Rafsanjani Egypt's desire to eliminate the 
obstacles standing in the way of the improvement of its 
relations with Iran. 
  The sources further said that the al-Asad-Rafsanjani summit 
agenda will be full of topical issues, especially regional, 
Islamic, and international issues, extraordinary developments 
affecting these issues, and other matters of mutual interest, in 
addition to the situation in the Gulf, Lebanon, the Palestinian 
question, and the effects of the separate Palestinian-Israeli 
agreements on the peace process. On the situation in southern 
Lebanon, the Syrian and Iranian sides will reaffirm continued 
support for the Islamic and national resistance for the 
expulsion of the Israeli forces and the liberation of the south. 
  The summit talks will cover the situation in Iraqi and the 
position of the Kurds, particularly in view of the recent change 
in that position. Iran is worried about the main Kurdish 
parties in the region, especially those which have close links 
with the West. Iran and Syria have emphasized in past joint 
statements that what happens in Iraq is an internal affair and 
something for the Iraqi people to resolve. The two sides will 
also review Arab-Turkish relations and the tense situation in 
the Kurdish areas of Turkey. 
  President Rafsanjani has stressed that Iran and Syria are 
opposed to any violation of Iraqi territorial integrity and 
Palestinian rights. 
  This will be al-Asad's second visit of its kind to Iran. He 
visited Tehran in September 1990. 
  President Rafsanjani paid his first visit to Syria as 
Iranian 
president in April 1991. He held talks described at the time as 
very successful. 
  Political observers believe that Syria's participation in 
the 
peace negotiations with Israel, which Iran strongly opposes, has 
not resulted in any Syrian-Iranian misunderstanding and that 
Iran's position on this is that it is a matter related to 
Syria's views on the issues of peace and the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. Iranian Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati has 
stated that his country would not have a dispute with such 
states as Syria, with whom it enjoys solid and close relations, 
over the question of peace agreement. Iran believes that 
Damascus is coming under massive pressure to sign a peace 
agreement with Israel, and Iran has told Syria that it is 
opposed to such an agreement and to anything to do with peace 
with Israel. 
  President al-Asad has said that both countries share the 
same 
views on Lebanon and both have long supported Lebanon's unity. 
  Syrian sources say that President Hafiz al-Asad's visit to 
Tehran will further enhance Syrian-Iranian relations and raise 
them to a more special level, particularly in economic and 
cultural fields.

  [Text] Tunis, March 31 (AFP) -- Israel has taken the first 
step toward protecting Palestinians by signing an accord with 
the PLO Thursday [31 March] to deploy 160 foreign observers in 
the West Bank town of Hebron, a PLO spokesman said. 
  The accord signed in Cairo was "a first step in applying 
(UN) 
Security Council Resolution 904," the spokesman said. 
  The resolution, adopted on March 18, condemned the massacre 
of 30 Palestinians by a Jewish settler at a Hebron mosque on 
February 25 and called for international protection for the 
Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
  The PLO spokesman, quoted by the official WAFA news agency, 
welcomed the participation of "friendly countries in the 
international force" which is to deploy in the West Bank town. 
  But he urged additional measures "to guarantee effective 
international protection for the Palestinian people, its land 
and its holy sites." 
  He called on Israel to fulfill all the conditions necessary 
to ensure the observers could complete their neutral mission and 
said the PLO was "ready to help them in the task." 
  Other problems still to be resolved included settlers 
carrying arms and "the presence of extremist settlers and their 
terrorist activities," he said. 
  The PLO would continue its efforts to protect all 
Palestinians and "wipe out centres of terrorism," as well as 
pushing ahead with deployment of a Palestinian security force in 
the Gaza Strip and Jericho as set out in the Declaration of 
Principles signed in Washington in September. 
  Talks on launching Palestinian self-rule resumed Thursday 
after the security deal was signed in Cairo.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Apr (INA) -- Foreign Minister Muhammad 
Sa'id al-Sahhaf has said Iraq has fulfilled its international 
obligations, particularly Resolution 687, which stipulates, in 
return, that the Security Council should immediately lift the 
Iraq embargo in line with Paragraph 22. 
  In an interview with Egyptian television screened last 
night, 
al-Sahhaf said it is the right of the Iraqi people and 
government, in line with international law, to take measures 
that keep them alive and ensures their future if pressure on the 
Security Council persists in order to prevent the lifting of the 
embargo. 
  He said lifting the Iraq embargo is necessary and is 
stipulated by Resolution 687, Paragraph 22, and that any talk to 
the contrary is obvious manipulation of the resolutions and 
their contents. 
  Regarding the allegations of the Kuwaiti regime about 
missing 
persons, the foreign minister said Iraq had cooperated with 
three envoys sent by the Arab League, the Security Council, and 
the International Committee of the Red Cross, and that Iraq 
holds no Kuwaiti people at all.

  [Text] Baghdad, 1 Apr (INA) -- [National Assembly Speaker] 
Sa'di Mahdi Salih has reasserted his satisfaction with the 
outcome of his meeting with the president of the French National 
Assembly in Paris early this week. He said the meeting was an 
advanced step down the road of normalizing relations between 
Iraq and France. 
  In an interview with AL-THAWRAH published today, Salih said 
the meeting revealed a serious French desire and concern on the 
part of the French Government to normalize relations with Iraq 
and to move on toward a new stage in which France will greatly 
contribute, through the Security Council, toward lifting the 
Iraq embargo. 
  He said the atmosphere that prevailed during the meetings of 
the Interparliamentary Union, concluded recently in the French 
capital, highlighted a noticeable change in the international 
arena and a frank call for lifting the Iraq embargo, especially 
the oil embargo. 
  Commenting on the agreement of the Arab sides to a Moroccan 
proposal to hold an ordinary session for the Arab Parliamentary 
Union to clear the Arab atmosphere, Salih said: Definitely, the 
question of the Iraq embargo will command the attention of 
everybody, because the removal of its causes opens the door for 
a unified Arab position. 
  On a visit by a Jordanian parliament delegation to Iraq 
tomorrow, Sa'di Mahdi Salih said the delegation, led by 'Abd 
Musa al-Nahar, deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, 
will hold talks with several officials within the context of 
brotherly relations between the two countries. The delegation 
will also attend part of the new session of the Iraqi National 
Assembly.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Netan'el Semrik on news conference </F>
by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at the Defense Ministry in Tel 
Aviv on 31 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, 
held a news conference a short while ago in which he sharply 
criticized right-wing figures and the rabbis who called on 
soldiers to disobey orders. Rabin said that this was moral 
lawlessness, irresponsibility, hypocrisy, and lies. Our 
correspondent Netan'el Semrik reports. 
  [Semrik] Good evening from the our broadcasting van at the 
Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv. In a news conference for 
electronic media correspondents which ended exactly two minutes 
ago, Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, 
vehemently attacked right-wing figures and the rabbis, accusing 
them of setting the precedent for a transfer of Jewish 
population. This in reaction to the charges leveled against him 
about the possibility of evacuating the Jewish settlers from 
Hebron. Let us hear some of Rabin's remarks: 
  [Rabin] The Palestinians have given up their demand for a 
police force. We agreed to a certain increase in the size of 
the international presence to 160 people, of which 90 will be 
Norwegians, 35 Danes, and 35 Italians. Those personnel who will 
serve as observers will report to a joint team composed by the 
mayor of Hebron and the military governor. They will also 
report to the liaison committee we agreed upon in the 
Declaration of Principles signed in Washington, which will be 
headed on the Israeli side by the foreign minister and on the 
Palestinian side by Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas]. We very much 
hope that this new situation will help restore calm to Hebron 
and of course permit the resumption of the negotiations over 
reaching an agreement on the implementation of the first stage 
of the Declaration of Principles: Gaza-Jericho First. Indeed, 
the formal opening of the negotiations on Gaza-Jericho First 
began today in Cairo and will resume on Sunday [3 April] when 
our delegation arrives there to continue the negotiations as 
rapidly as possible in order to finalize, sign, and subsequently 
implement the agreement. At the same time, we agreed to permit 
the first Palestinian policemen to enter the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho to begin organizing themselves -- in Gaza city as well 
as in other locations in the strip and in Jericho -- without 
them assuming any police duties at this stage. Only one party 
must retain overall responsibility for security. Israel will 
retain sole responsibility for security in Hebron. This also 
remains the case, at this stage, throughout the Gaza Strip as 
well as in that area of Jericho where the Palestinian 
self-administration body will be established within the 
framework of Gaza-Jericho First. 
  I am pleased with the fact that we have managed to overcome 
the obstacles created by the despicable massacre at the Cave of 
the Patriarchs and the subsequent incidents, and that we have 
managed to get the negotiations back on track. Hopefully, they 
will now be accelerated. I believe that the appropriate reply 
to the enemies of peace and to those people from both sides who 
are trying to murder the process should be to speed up the 
negotiations and implement Gaza-Jericho First in order to prove 
to all the enemies of peace on all sides that they will not be 
able to prevent the process from moving ahead. 
  [Semrik] Mr. Prime Minister, is 13 April Israel's 
preferred target date for starting its withdrawal from the Gaza 
Strip, even under the assumption that the agreement with the PLO 
will not be fully completed by that time? 
  [Rabin] At this stage we must first complete a clear, 
detailed, and comprehensive agreement on security and control 
arrangements, as well as major economic issues before fully 
implementing the agreement and carrying out the IDF's [Israel 
Defense Forces] withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho 
area. Nevertheless, as I mentioned earlier, we are permitting 
the initial planning and organization of the police force -- at 
this stage we are talking about something between 100 to 150 
Palestinian policemen who will be stationed in the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho -- in order to make the appropriate preparations. 
We want the transfer of authority to be carried out as rapidly 
as possible but in an orderly manner. We do not want any 
vacuums or ambiguities regarding responsibility. The transfer 
of authority will take place when the Palestinians are 
thoroughly ready to shoulder their responsibility to uphold law 
and public order, as well as for preventing serious incidents in 
the areas under their control. 
  [Israel Television Channel 1 correspondent Gadi Sukenik] Mr. 
Rabin, as this news conference is being recorded, right-wing 
leaders are holding a meeting in Qiryat Arba'. They have issued 
a firm demand not to evacuate Jewish settlers from the 
territories, especially not from Hebron. Do you accept their 
demand? 
  [Rabin] I would like to tell the right wing that they were 
the first to carry out a transfer of Jews during the Israeli 
withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula. All the settlements were 
evacuated, Yamit was torn down, and Ofira was abandoned. I 
advise them to remember who established the precedent that when 
signing a peace treaty with an Arab country, Israel is expected 
to return all the territories seized from that country by the 
IDF in the 1967 war. Who was the first to set the precedent of 
what they call a Jewish transfer from all of the Sinai Peninsula 
while uprooting all signs of an Israeli presence there? It is 
time for them to stop making these statements which are full of 
hypocrisy and lies. For the time being, nobody is talking about 
evacuating the Jewish settlers from Hebron. 
  [Israel Television Channel 2 correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] 
Sir, former prime minister Yitzhaq Shamir today joined the 
rabbis in calling on IDF soldiers to refuse to obey orders to 
implement such a withdrawal. Now that it is not just one or two 
lunatics issuing such a call, do you not fear the possibility of 
a civil war or problems within the Army? 
  [Rabin] I am convinced that calling on soldiers to refuse to 
obey legal orders issued by a legally elected government is an 
act of total lawlessness and irresponsibility. I would like to 
remind everyone that many soldiers and large segments of the 
public questioned the way the Lebanon war was handled. There 
were even officers and public figures who called on soldiers not 
to serve in Lebanon. I said then and I reiterate today that 
nothing poses a greater threat to the continued existence of 
Israel as a democratic country and to the future of the IDF as 
the people's army than such calls to reject legal orders. Many 
soldiers refused to serve in the territories. There were also 
public organizations which called on soldiers to refuse to carry 
out such missions. I stated at the time, regardless of whether 
or not I was in the government or of what position I held, that 
it was inconceivable to call on an IDF soldier to refuse to 
carry out legal orders. I think that what is happening now -- 
whether these are calls by rabbis or statements by various 
public figures -- constitutes lawlessness and irresponsibility 
on a level unprecedented in the State of Israel's history. 
  [Qol Yisra'el correspondent Shlomo Raz] Mr. Prime 
Minister, you mentioned that the observers will carry out 
additional tasks and help the Hebron Municipality do its job. 
Could you give us some more details on this matter? 
  [Rabin] We made such a proposal. The issue has yet to be 
formulated but some of the international personnel will not 
function as observers but rather carry out administrative duties 
and assist the Hebron Municipality wherever such aid is required. 
  [Raz] For example? 
  [Rabin] On economic issues, engineering, education and in 
other fields depending on the municipality's needs. This of 
course, depends on the relationship that develops between the 
municipality and the members of the temporary international 
force. 
  [Rosen] Mr. Rabin, you said that Palestinian policemen would 
begin entering the Gaza Strip and Jericho next week. Is the 
start of a withdrawal by the IDF also included in the attempt to 
accelerate the implementation of the agreement, even before the 
latter is completely finalized and signed? 
  [Rabin] In the area of the Gaza Strip, the IDF is in the 
midst of redeploying for the new situation which take effect 
following the signing of the agreement. This redeployment does 
not cover all fields. The IDF retains responsibility for 
overall security throughout the entire Gaza Strip. Therefore, 
while there is redeployment on the one hand, we continue to bear 
overall responsibility for whatever happens in the Gaza Strip. 
  [Sukenik] What is your reaction to the killing of the six 
Fatah Hawks in Jabalyah on 29 March? 
  [Rabin] That was a regrettable mishap. However, in my 
opinion and to the best of my knowledge from the reports so far, 
the IDF soldiers acted correctly. This was a regrettable mishap 
which resulted from a lack of coordination. I hope that the 
entry of the first police contingent will permit a higher degree 
of coordination and preclude unnecessary confrontations. 
  [Semrik] Mr. Prime Minister, is the scenario of either 
evacuating the Jewish settlers from Hebron or concentrating them 
in one site closer today than it was several days ago? 
  [Rabin] I am dealing with this issue now and I will not 
comment on it. I made it clear that we have no intention of 
uprooting the Israeli presence in Hebron, certainly not at this 
stage of the negotiations. 
  [Raz] Mr. Rabin, do you not fear that a precedent has been 
set for the stationing of international forces at various 
locations beyond the Green Line whenever there are problems? 
  [Rabin] I consider this an exception. The horrendous 
massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs was perpetrated by an 
Israeli with a weapon issued to him by the IDF for self-defense 
purposes. This man also donned an IDF uniform, although he was 
not on military duty. Statements were also made by various 
elements which almost justified this man's deed. The State of 
Israel is paying for all this just as it might pay with the 
lives of Jews both in Israel and abroad as a result of the fury 
and anger caused by this despicable murder.

<F P=106> ["Roundtable" program with Wan Jingzhang, secretary of the </F>
UN Iraqi Sanctions Committee, and representatives of the 
Jordanian economic and government community, moderated by 
correspondent Zayd Zalatimu in Amman on 28 March: "UN Sanctions 
Imposed on Iraq and Its Effects on the Economy of Jordan"; 
broadcast simultaneously on Amman Jordan Television Network in 
Arabic with captioned Arabic translation -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Zalatimu] The Gulf war will be noted as possibly 
the most difficult and challenging episode in the history of the 
Arab world. Although it did not participate in the war, Jordan 
continues to be one of its most profound victims. As a result 
of the war, Jordan's population increased by 10 per cent in a 
matter of months, causing a severe strain on Jordan's economy, 
infrastructure, and services. 
  The total financial resources needed to cover the cost of 
these basic services was estimated at $3.5 billion. Jordan 
found itself dealing with this burden alone, at a time in which 
Israel was receiving $10 billion in loan guarantees. Jordan was 
forced to interrupt its economic adjustment program, and 
witnessed a substantial reduction in the exports of goods and 
services, workers' remittances, external grants, and endured the 
diversion of trade routes. The United Nations estimated 
Jordan's direct external financial losses caused by the conflict 
at $4.3 billion for 1990 and 1991. 
  At present, due to the UN sanctions against Iraq, Jordanian 
industry and trade continue to suffer from being deprived of 
this vital market. Prior to the conflict, Iraq was Jordan's 
largest trading partner, and the feasibility of many Jordanian 
businesses was based on the buying power of the Iraqi consumer. 
The UN Sanctions Committee, whose secretary is our guest this 
evening, was established to grant the necessary permissions to 
export to Iraq and to monitor the embargo. The export included 
only humanitarian goods and services. 
  It is important to note that Jordan is the only country in 
the region which has strictly adhered to the imposed sanctions. 
And yet, as Jean Ripert of the United Nations stated in 1990 on 
a report on the status of the embargo, Jordan is not the target 
of the embargo, but it may be its greatest victim. 
  Before we engage in discussion, I would like to welcome our 
distinguished guest this evening. As I noted, we have Mr. Wan 
[Jingzhang], the secretary of the Sanctions Committee. He is 
also the senior political affairs officer in the department of 
political affairs; Mr. Muhammad al-Jamal, director general of 
the Customs Department; Engineer 'Imad al-Shamma, deputy 
treasurer of the Chamber of Industry; Dr. Durayd al-Mahasinah, 
director general of the Jordan Ports Corporation; Mr. Tawfiq 
Qa'war, chairman of the Jordanian Shipping Agents Association; 
Mr. Muhammad 'Asfur, president of the Federation of Jordanian 
Chambers of Commerce; and last, but not least, Dr. Muhammad 
al-Mumtaz, adviser to the minister of finance. 
  Before we carry on with our discussion, and ask questions 
from Mr. Wan, I'd like to read a statement from the Royal Court: 
His Majesty King Husayn has taken the personal lead in this 
issue. His Majesty King Husayn called to his office at the 
Royal Court today [28 March] the ambassadors of the five 
permanent members of the UN Security council to inform them in 
very clear terms of the pressures and aggravation Jordan faces 
due to the blockade imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah. 
  So, as you can see, we are here to discuss one of the most 
important issues faced by Jordan today. 
  Mr. Wan, if you could tell us of the mechanisms your 
committee uses in determining who is allowed to export the 
humanitarian goods and services to Iraq. As you know, this is 
an issue of utmost importance for Jordanian merchants and the 
industrial sector. 
  [Wan] Thank you, I would like to say in the first place that 
the Sanctions Committee is very thankful and appreciative for 
the important contribution made by Jordan for the effective 
implementation of the sanctions regime established under 
Resolution 661. I would like to give you a very brief 
introduction of how the committee works. As you see, the 
Sanctions Committee is established by Resolution 661, 1990, and 
the mandate of the committee is also defined very clearly in 
that resolution, that is Security Council Resolution 661. At 
the moment, the committee is composed of 15 members, which are 
also members of the Security Council. You are well aware that 
they are the five permanent members which are China, France, 
Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and also the 
10 nonpermanent members. They are Argentina, Brazil, the Czech 
Republic, Djibouti, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Oman, 
Rwanda, and Spain. 
  The committee has established its guiding lines to guide the 
conduct of its work. Mainly, the principal rule is that a 
decision has to be made by consensus. This means that any 
approval for any application, for instance, would have to be 
approved by all 15 members in the committee. If one of them is 
against such approval, or is not in a position to agree to any 
application, that means that application would not be allowed to 
be exported to Iraq. 
  I have to mention another point. It is that the 
responsibility for implementation of that resolution rests with 
the government. That means all applications would have to come 
through government channels to this committee. If any 
individual or any company wishes to export anything to Iraq, he 
may, through the government channel -- here, maybe the Ministry 
of Finance -- and then in turn through the Jordanian permanent 
mission to the United Nations to submit the request to this 
committee. That is the normal procedure. Otherwise, if any 
request is submitted to the committee directly by that company 
or merchant, then the committee would to have return it, would 
have to start from the very beginning. So that takes time. So 
please, if there is any request, submit them through the 
Jordanian Government. 
  I also want to say that, apart from medicine and health 
supplies, which are exempt from the sanctions, there are 
foodstuffs which also need only notification to this committee. 
Apart from these two categories, most applications concern 
request for export to Iraq of commodities regarded as basic 
civilian-need items. And these items fall under procedure, 
which is described in Paragraph 20 of Security Council 
Resolution 687 as the simplified and accelerated non-objection 
procedure, which means, the request when it is submitted to the 
requestee would have to be commented [on] by all 15 members of 
the committee within a certain time limit. 
  If no negative comment is received that means that 
application is automatically approved. But if a member, or some 
members, are not in a position to approve such a request, they 
will notify the committee of their position and that one will 
not be approved. But of course, the final decision would be 
made at a committee meeting (?which would) be discussed and then 
a final decision would be made. Once a final decision is made, 
then a response from the chairman -- that is, a letter signed by 
the chairman -- will be addressed to the original requester; 
that is, the permanent mission of a certain country which has 
submitted that request to the committee on behalf of any 
individual or business. 
  So in that sense, if it is approved, an approval letter 
would 
be signed. If it is rejected, a refusal letter would be signed. 
And there are many cases, because of the lack of information 
pertaining to that specific request, and some members are not 
yet ready to have a final decision on that. We call that to put 
a certain request on hold -- to shelve it -- and in the meantime 
to seek further information from the original requester. If 
further information provided by the original requester is 
satisfactory, then they may say: It is okay. It could be 
approved. Then another letter of approval will be issued. But 
if they are not satisfied by any further information, or if no 
further information concerning that request is forthcoming, in 
that case, that particular request would be either refused, or 
still remain on hold, which means indefinitely on hold, it could 
last a month, or even years, because they are waiting for 
further information. 
  So, for the time being, the committee is working in a way 
which we try to make the applications simpler and we treat and 
process those applications in a more effective way. But 
unfortunately, because of the numbers of requests and also the 
limited resources we have and because of some of the complicated 
procedures guiding our work, there is a backlog. And we have 
succeeded in cutting that backlog to about one and one-half 
months now, from three to months at the end of last year. So 
this is all I want to say at the very beginning. 
  [Zalatimu] I am sure all our distinguished guests are very 
anxious to ask and comment on what you just said, but first 
we'll move to Mr. Muhammad al-Jamal, director general of the 
Customs Department, because, as you know, the Jordanian 
Government relies heavily on customs for its income, and with 
the loss of its most significant trading partner, that, of 
course, caused some severe financial problems for the 
department. Please, Mr. al-Jamal. 
  [Al-Jamal] Thank you. The Jordan Government has to implement 
the Sanctions Committee 661. And to implement that, the 
minister of finance have found an office, private office. The 
purpose of this office is to receive the application of the 
Jordanian exporters to send goods to Iraq. This office have to 
receive all his applications and send it through the minister of 
foreign affairs to our permanent ambassador in the UN. We send 
these application to get approval to be sent to export goods to 
Iraq. We found that most of these application is not approved. 
We have sent 4,454 applications to the Sanctions Committee, we 
have received 718 approvals, and we have received 852 
applications refused, and still 2,984 applications pending. 
  We are facing a lot of problems with the Sanctions Committee 
in terms of time needed for approvals, and the discrimination 
between Jordan applications and other countries' applications, 
and between the same commodity. For example, we have sent 76 
applications for textiles, they approved 11, they refused 41, 
and still 24 pending. 
  [Zalatimu] If I can make just a footnote. I think a lot of 
people send you applications and expect that you are actually 
the decisionmaking body on what they are allowed to export and 
what they are not allowed to export. When actually in reality 
its Mr. Wan's committee which makes these decisions, so... 
  [Al-Jamal, interrupting] Thank you for the question. 
Actually, our job in that is just to receive the application 
and send it to the UN Sanctions Committee through our ambassador. 
  [Zalatimu] So, to emphasize, again, you're just a conduit 
and 
not a decisionmaking body. So, when citizens come to you with 
complaints that, for example, they weren't given permission to 
export y or z, its not actually on your shoulders, but on... 
  [Al-Jamal, interrupting] No, exactly. And another question 
we are facing now, when I am mentioning that we are sending 76 
applications for textiles and we just got 11 approvals and that 
41 refused. Those 41 [word indistinct] why give approvals to 11 
people and you don't give us? Actually, it's not our decision. 
And we send 44 applications for tires, we received four 
approvals, and no approvals six, and 34 still pending. For 
glass, we send nine applications, three approvals approved, one 
is not approved, and five is pending. Another example, the last 
one is clothes. 38 applications, 12 is approved, zero not 
approved, and 26 still pending. 
  [Zalatimu] Sorry to cut you off, we're going to move Mr. 
Tawfiq Qa'war, chairman of the Shipping Agents Association. He 
is essentially Jordan's link to the outside world through its 
only port, al-'Aqabah, and he has, probably, the most severe 
gripe with these sanctions and the imposed embargo. Please, Mr. 
Qa'war. 
  [Qa'war] Well, inspection started in August of 1990. There 
was no prearrangement at all. It was all haphazardly, until 
March of 1991 when the guidelines set out and then we have kept 
a record as a shipping agents association. We have kept a 
record, and we have been monitoring every ship that was delayed, 
inspected, diverted, or refused entry. And, in the guidelines 
two conditions were played down. One, is that all documentation 
must be clear and visible, and that is very easy to comply with. 
And the second precondition is accessibility. Ships must have 
their cargo fully accessible, and this is very difficult to 
achieve, especially in general cargo. They are two types, 
conventional ships, where you have general cargo. And, to make 
all cargo accessible you have to open corridors and they keep 
some stackings of cargo here and there. So this is not safe for 
the ship in its navigation, nor for the cargo itself, 
containers, to have them accessible, I'll give you a very simple 
example which explains the difficulty of the situation. A ship 
coming from north continent down to the Red Sea serving 
al-'Aqabah. Let's say we will have around 1,000 containers. 
This is mainly the Red Sea Express, which is the basic line 
consortium of lines serving al-'Aqabah with that area. It has 
400, let's say, containers to al-'Aqabah general, and 600 to the 
other ports. It cannot come to al-'Aqabah with 1,000 containers 
to be fully accessible. Logistically this is impossible, so the 
ship has to go to Jeddah first, discharge the cargo, 
al-Hudaydah, Djibouti, Port, Sudan, restore al-'Aqabah cargo 
again, leave corridors among the containers, come back to al- 
'Aqabah so that it can be fully accessible, discharge the 
containers of al-'Aqabah, reload the empties, and the exports, 
go down to Jeddah, Port Sudan, Saudi, come back through the Suez 
Canal up north. This round trip cost the ship between 250 to 
300 thousand dollars, plus the delays that the ships must pass 
in by daylight, come out by daylight. All these delays cost 
money. Therefore, it is the ship owners who impose a certain 
inspection search charge, which is $500 for a 20-footer, and a 
$1,000 for a 40-footer container. This goes to the ship owners. 
It does not go to the United Nations, let's make this very 
clear. 
  [Zalatimu] Would you say this is the most difficult period 
you faced as a shipping agent? 
  [Qa'war] Exactly, yes. And I have to continue to give you 
this idea about the damages which have been caused Jordanian 
economy from the point of view of extra insurance at the 
beginning of the Gulf, from the delays in inspections, from the 
surcharges that have been imposed, from the losses of exports of 
Iraqi cargo, the losses of the import of the Jordanian-Iraqi 
cargo via al-'Aqabah. All this has cost the country, according 
to our calculation, in the vicinity, about 600 million dinars, 
close to $900 million, which is a very substantial crunch. The 
negative effect on the shipping side is that out of 41 regular 
lines that were calling at al-'Aqabah, 21 have stopped. Some 
others are now transshipping via Jeddah with feeding services. 
Al-'Aqabah has lost its position as a major port in the Red Sea 
and has become a subsidiary port. Before, al-'Aqabah was very 
important port for ship owners. Ships coming in, let us say, 
with 10,000 tonnes of sugar, on completion of this charge will 
easily pick up phosphate, potash, and go out. So, we were 
enjoying shipper freight coming in, shipper freight going out. 
  The other losses is the lack of confidence by the importers 
and exporters in their ships or containers coming to al-'Aqabah 
with raw materials afraid that the ship will be diverted, move 
their cargo via Latakia, Beirut, and Tartus. Last year, over a 
half a million tonnes out of 3 millions discharged in al-'Aqabah 
moved via those ports. This is another loss. 
  While sitting with the American side in September 1993, we 
discussed this question at length. And a suggestion came from 
them saying this is a very a cumbersome operation. Why don't 
you get an organization like Lloyd's, independent organization, 
to do this inspection on land? And we jumped at this suggestion 
and we placed it with the ICC, International Chamber of 
Commerce, in Paris, through which we have been complaining to 
the international world what is happening in al-'Aqabah and 
keeping them informed. They agreed to it, they supported us 
with Lloyd's, and finally we reached the Lloyd's Register to 
come in and do the inspection in the port, not as reported by 
the radio services from 5 o'clock this morning that the ships 
will be inspected in al-'Aqabah. We do not want the ships to be 
inspected in al-'Aqabah because we will be back in square one, 
where ships will not be able to have their full capacity. It is 
essential that the ships coming through the Tiran Straits, in 
accordance with the freedom of navigation -- a condition 
recognized all over the world -- with their full capacity, and 
the cargo can be discharged in the port. It will be inspected 
in the port area, during the customs clearance. And I think the 
discussions between the Jordan Government and the United States 
Government have advanced a lot towards instructing this job to 
an internationally-recognized independent non-profit 
organization called Lloyd's Register to do the job. And we hope 
that the ideal solution after three and a half years of agony 
and losses, it is time that we take stock, and the international 
community takes stock and looks at what is happening in 
al-'Aqabah. The ideal solution -- since Jordan is effectively 
complying with the United Nations resolutions and not one single 
package can move to Iraq unless there is a United Nations 
inspection certificate with it, and since no cargo can be loaded 
at the loading port if it is consigned to Iraq, cannot be 
loaded, and there has not been one single package which has been 
caught for Iraq -- therefore, we suggest the inspection could be 
lifted entirely, if this is not impossible [as heard] for some 
reason or another, then we move over to the inspection of cargo 
in the port. And I think this will be a very good proposal for 
the time being and we will fully support it. 
  [Zalatimu] Ok, thank you, sir. Staying in al-'Aqabah, Dr. 
al-Mahasinah, who is the director general of the Jordan Ports 
Corporation, I am sure feels a lot of your agony. You two have 
become very good friends, I assume, in the past few years. 
  [Al-Mahasinah] Well, as Mr. Qa'war mentioned and as you 
emphasized, we became so much in business together, 
unfortunately with this negative side effects. But, let me 
first welcome Mr. Wan in this panel, and thank you for 
presenting the whole issue, which is really vital. It took its 
climax yesterday, when His Majesty King Husayn called the five 
ambassadors to the Royal Court and really expressed our agony 
about this thing. Our agony is expressed both in statistics 
that my colleagues would mention or state and in principle. We 
feel that all the resolutions that Mr. Wan mentioned, 661 and 
the rest, Jordan was not the subject of these resolutions in the 
idea, or in principle, or in writing. Unfortunately, in 
practice, it is Jordan that is suffering out of these 
resolutions. We don't find a reason why. I don't find a reason 
why my cargo should be inspected and scattered all over the 
world; I don't find a reason why the UN, or any other agencies, 
or any other governments would take me as a victim or as an 
enemy and scatter my cargo all over the world and divert my 
ships. In the years since 1990 till 1994, approximately 150 
ships were either prevented or delayed or not allowed to proceed 
to al-'Aqabah. 
  Gentlemen, in terms of money, this is too much that Jordan 
can take. Our cargo in the Port of al-'Aqabah dropped. In 
1989, we used to handle about 20 million tonnes a year of 
exports and imports. We now handle, 1993 figures showed that we 
only handled 11.6, this is a drop from 1992, which was 13.3. 
That means that the situation is aggravated. And I don't find 
a reason for it; neither do I find a solution for it. Each 
tonne of cargo makes 25 JD's, which is approximately $32 and 
plus; that is, we have truck drivers benefiting out of that, 
approximately 7,000-8,000 trucks are working to load and unload 
this cargo; we have agents like Mr. Qa'war and his colleagues; 
the commercial sector and the industrial sector. All these 
people. The revenues, not my exact revenues, which are 
estimated with a loss of approximately $200 million to $250, I 
would presume that this situation is unbelievably unjustified, 
very harmful, and it causing me that much of disastrous 
consequences. 
  In this regard, I don't find a reason that why should this 
inspection goes on, and I don't find a mandate for it. If 
through the 150 ships that you diverted out of entering the Gulf 
of Aqaba, all the cargo on them came back was justified, and, as 
Mr. Qa'war mentioned, not a single box was found destined or 
bound to Baghdad in violation of 661, so why should this go on? 
  [Zalatimu] I think it is important to know also the way in 
which ships are often pirated by the MIF's, the Military 
Intervention Forces, which I believe are intend to be a U.S.-led 
groups which divert Jordanian ships to other ports, often not 
knowing exactly where they're going to, the captain of a ship 
doesn't exactly know where he is going.... 
  [Al-Mahasinah, interrupting] Let me add to this and give you 
an example. We had an example two weeks ago, or during the past 
two weeks. A ship came to al-'Aqabah, its cargo was refused, it 
did send the cargo back to Suez. Another ship came with the 
same cargo, and then the inspectors came to approach the ship at 
2 P.M. They said: OK, you wait till next morning. Next 
morning, they came on board the ship, and they couldn't inspect 
it because there were some bees on the ship. So they postponed 
it till he sprays insecticides against the bees and the flies. 
They came back again and it was mentioned that there is not 
enough light on it. 
  [Zalatimu] It's amazingly incredible difficult to set a 
schedule, for example, when the ships are coming or where they 
going. 
  [Al-Mahasinah] Here, I'm not talking biology. I'm not just 
mentioning bees and so on. The reason I want to tell you: If 
your legal cargo, that you are waiting for in Amman, is diverted 
or delayed because there is a bee on the ship that is not a 
reason. That's a very, very silly reason, and that's a 
harassment. That is not really justified technique. Mr. Wan 
mentioning simplifying, but it is not being simplified in the 
Tiran Straits. It is not being simplified for Jordan and its 
economy and survival. 
  [Zalatimu] I guess his majesty's statement yesterday 
underlined the importance of this issue for the Jordanian 
economy, and in fact, his majesty linked Jordan's participation 
in the peace talks with some sort of easing of the inspection 
and sanctions in al-'Aqabah. 
  Next, we move to the export side of this equation, Mr. 'Imad 
al-Shamma' from the Chamber of Industry is gravely affected as 
Jordanian exports. Sir. 
  [Al-Shamma'] Well, thank you very much, sir. Allow me first 
just to give you a brief idea about the Jordanian industry as a 
sector, and then I'll move on to the effect of what we talking 
about today. 
  Basically, we represent, as a Chamber of Industry, the 
industrial sector, which comprises about 18,000 companies and 
factories and firms and employs about 110,000 people. This is 
not the first time that the Chamber of Industry or the Jordanian 
officials raise the issue of the effect of Resolution 661 and 
the embargo or the ship searching on al-'Aqabah with officials, 
whether from the United States or visiting delegations. 
  We feel, as the Chamber of Industry, as Jordan as a whole, 
its economy has been targeted to a level of impoverishment. And 
we feel that Jordan as a result of this Security Council has 
suffered tremendously. As Mr. Qa'war has mentioned, and Dr. 
al-Mahasinah, we on both sides of the coin, on the import side 
and on the export side, suffered in the sense that our cost of 
imports has went up vis-a-vis that we have to pay about $1,000 
extra for every 40-foot containers that we import, and about 
$500 for 20-foot container. And even on the export side, we have 
lost tremendously on the export side, because we are paying now 
about $250 for every 20-foot container for export and about $500 
for a 40-foot container. 
  To make the problem even worse is finding the vessel. If I 
am saying that I don't need to export to Iraq and I'm looking 
for new markets in Europe or anywhere else, if I don't find a 
vessel to come and pick up my cargo, then I cannot export, I 
cannot compete. And if I have to pay an extra fee to put my 
container on a ship and to be searched by the military forces 
then that would add to my cost and to my competitiveness. 
  As you know, the Jordanian industry as a whole is of 
humanitarian needs; it is not of military type of industry. We 
are a converting industry. So, we do not believe why should we 
as Jordanian industrialists have to keep on convincing the 
United Nations and the Sanctions Committees that we don't export 
military to anywhere else in the world, and specifically to 
Iraq? Add to that, if the UN sanctions, according to a certain 
approval, it has granted to a certain product, as Mr. Jamal has 
mentioned, we do not see the reason why we should, every time we 
need to export the same product from the same company to the 
same market, why do we have to keep on asking for the same 
approval? We have mentioned to Mr. Wan that this would only add 
to his dilemma and problems because it would augment the demand 
on his services and the Sanction Committee services, whereby we 
have to keep on import applying for the same product from the 
same company to the same market. This as a whole, we feel, 
should be addressed in a very crucial manner, whereby we grant a 
blanket approval for that product for that company from a 
certain part of the world, especially Jordan. I have to 
emphasize another fact. It is that we are mixing two main 
issues here. It is that the sanction is a UN resolution while 
the inspection of the port is done on basis of the military 
forces or the allied forces that were there in the Gulf crisis. 
And we feel that the two are part and parcel of the whole 
crisis. The Jordanian industry has suffered tremendously. Many 
companies are closing down or reducing their staff. And as you 
see, Jordan is the hub of democratization, it is the hub of 
stability, thank God to his, you know, the vision, of his 
majesty the king. So, we feel with this sanctions and the 
search on our ports, whether on the import side or in the export 
side, is creating some sort of social instability. And this can 
affect not only Jordan, it would affect the whole region. Add 
on to top of that we know that Jordan is going through the peace 
process now and we believe that you cannot have a stable peace 
if the people are poor and if they are not happy. 
  Basically all this becomes to one simple factor: We should 
have economic prosperity to develop our country in the sense to 
accommodate the peace process, or else we cannot compete. 
  [Zalatimu] Thank you. Talking about the Jordanian consumer, 
possibly the most in touch with the Jordanian consumer in this 
panel here this evening is the president of the Jordanian 
Chambers of Commerce, Mr. Muhammad 'Asfur. I'm sure you are 
particularly interested in commenting on Mr. Wan's theme. 
  ['Asfur] Thank you, Zayd. I want to enter into a different 
line of direct but simple questions concerning the sanctions and 
the siege on Iraq. My first question, Mr. Wan, would be until 
when is Jordan to keep suffering and sacrificing the constants 
of free trade on false political grounds? All my questions are 
going to be interrelated, really. And on that pretense, how 
will the region enter a new phase of economic relations while 
Jordan cannot purchase its imports for the same prices available 
to other countries in the region? Where is the just formula in 
this political agenda? And also for my own education, I would 
like to know does the United Nations Resolution 661 concerning 
the siege on Iraq gives the upper hand to the United States to 
investigate ships loaded with goods or imports to Jordan? Is 
Jordan the target? 
  Will the U.S. really halt vessels carrying American exports 
to Jordan, in the same [way] it stops any other vessel, ship 
that has goods shipped to al-'Aqabah? What is the intention 
there? Is it to hurt Jordan more than it had been hurt as a 
result of the Gulf war? Are we trying to increase the 
percentage of unemployment? Are we trying to increase the 
percentage of people beyond the poverty line? What are we 
really trying to do within all these sanctions? And as a result 
Jordan is suffering? Thank you. 
  [Zalatimu] I think we'll keep the, we'll keep Mr. Wan's 
answers to the end. First, before we move to Mr. Wan, I would 
like to hear from Dr. al-Mumtaz, advisor to the minister of 
finance, who's with us today. If you have, I'm sure you have 
some comments Dr. al-Mumtaz. 
  [Al-Mumtaz] Thank you Zayd. It seems to me that nothing is 
left to me to talk about, but I have two comments. The first 
one relating to the mechanism of the Sanctions Committee. Now, 
I think that the mechanism is used especially when it comes to 
handling Jordan's requests to ship goods to Iraq is very slow. 
Now, this unanimous vote of the committee, you know, when you 
are dealing with human beings, you know, with sending 
humanitarian goods to Iraq and, you know, you leave it to the 
(?whim) of one person to block any decision of that committee. 
So, again, the consensus, you have to have consenus, is 
bothering me a lot. The other thing is limiting now, limiting 
the period of the, you know, implementing the approval of a 
certain commodity for four months. Now, again, people are 
complaining about this in Jordan. You know, why don't leave it 
open as it used to be before? 
  Now, the other point. Now, wherever we go to present our 
case, the whole world now knows that we are abiding by the 
sanctions and also everybody will tell us: You know, look, you 
know, we understand your case. We are very sympathetic. But 
until now, no, and practically no, real support is provided to 
Jordan. Now we, the whole world knows, that we did take care of 
the evacuees who left Iraq and Kuwait and we took care of even, 
you know, some refugees all over the world. And now, in a 
country like Jordan, where democracy is flourishing, we have to 
take care of the concerns of our citizens in Jordan. Now, I 
have a quotation. I am quoting a report by Mr. Jean Ripert, who 
was then the director general for development and international 
economic cooperation at the United Nations who came here to 
Jordan in October and he wrote a report. In that report, I'm 
quoting him: The Security Council should take every effort to 
see that these embargo-related losses are compensated in full in 
order to avoid destabilizing the economy, etc.. in Jordan. 
  Now, I think, you know, the world community should listen to 
us and concerning the citizens of Jordan, I think, you know, 
their patience is running thin and we expect, you know, the 
world community to respond to our concerns. Thank you. 
  [Q'awar] Can I interject here just on one point regarding 
the 
inspection which is relevant to this as this stems out from his 
majesty's remarks and declaration, is that Iraq is able to 
import anything it wants from any port around without the ships 
calling at those ports being inspected. This is very important 
to be a point, focal point. 
  [Zalatimu] So, I guess actually when the objective of the 
Sanctions Committee is to forbid things from entering Iraq, 
things are entering Iraq, and Jordan, in the final analysis, is 
paying the price for UN-imposed sanctions which have been 
insensitive to Jordan's economic, and political, and social 
needs. 
  [Al-Mahasinah] Other ports are flourishing on behalf of our 
port, which is unjustified. Plus, you must take in 
consideration that the reputation that Jordan made through the 
years of being a very moderate country, a country that believes 
in international decisions, international committees, it 
respects them all the time. Now, people think of Jordanians as 
maybe smugglers, contrabandists, and everything is concentrated 
on Jordan [words indistinct]. 
  [Zalatimu] In reality, Jordan has become a model for Third 
World democratization and institutionalized democracy. 
  [Al-Mahasinah interjects] As Mr. al-Shamma' mentioned it. 
  [Zalatimu] I think you have, may be, 15 questions or so. I 
don't know if you've had a chance to look them over and see 
what... [changes thought] I'm sure some of them are 
interrelated, if you'd like to begin answering them. Hate to 
put you in the hot box, but that's the situation here in now. 
  [Wan] Thank you. 
  [Zalatimu] You're welcome. 
  [Wan] I can set on the sea. I have a lot of difficult 
questions to answer. First of all, I shall thank you for your 
statement and your comments. The points you raised in your 
statement are well taken and I'll certainly -- can promise you 
-- that I'll report your feelings, the feelings of the Jordanian 
people and your government and the business to the chairman of 
the Security Council Committee for consideration. Hopefully, 
something could be done in that area, but I cannot promise 
anything because the final decision rests with the 15 members of 
the committee, not with the Secretariat, from which I am from. 
We are providing secretarial service to the committee, not the 
policy makers, the decisionmakers. That is the first point I 
want to make. 
  Secondly, I can see our host, my host, has raised a number 
of 
very interesting questions. Some are of a general nature and 
some are more individualized. Let me address some of the 
questions one by one and if I omit anything or if you have any 
further questions, I'm always at your disposal. 
  Personally, I should say, I am keenly aware of the difficult 
plight, the difficult situation faced by Jordan, because, from 
the carry out of the Security Council resolution sanction 
regime. [sentence as heard] And I can assure you, gentlemen, 
that when that question was brought up to the committee for 
discussion, all the members of the committee expressed their 
great sympathy and also all the committee members recognize that 
Jordan had indeed been significantly affected by the sanctions 
regime established and Resolution 661, 1990. That is a fact I 
want to convey to you. At the same time, the committee members 
they're also concerned with a view of finding a way to address 
that issue although no consensus has been reached in that 
respect. I think Mr. al-Jamal is right. We have received 
thousands of applications from Jordanian businesses for export 
of various commodities to Iraq and I think I would be right to 
say that Jordan is one of our chief clients, or the main client, 
because about half of the applications are from Jordan. However, 
the committee has its own guiding lines as expressed in the very 
beginning, that we are operating on a non-objection basis which 
need the consensus of all 15 members to decide upon anything. 
  With regard to some of the points raised by Mr. al-Jamal, I 
would like to say when that question of discrimination was 
brought up to the committee for discussion, many members 
expressed the idea that the committee was conducting its 
business and is carrying out its mandate on a non-discriminatory 
basis, considering each application submitted to the committee 
for its consideration and no objection procedure on its own 
merit and without any focus, without focusing its attention on 
the origin of the goods involved, [word indistinct] who is the 
requester. 
  [Zalatimu] If I could just interject, I understand as a 
recent case of some water purification system, something which 
Jordan applied to export to Iraq and I believe the Netherlands 
had applied to export the same item and for some reason the 
exporter from the Netherlands was given permission and the one 
from Jordan was not. I do not know if you are aware of this 
most recent occurrence. 
  [Wan] I'm well aware of that. I just want to give you, 
gentlemen, some explanations how we work. I'm not commenting on 
any of the comments of member individual member states. His 
excellency the prime minister of Jordan, when he visited New 
York, he presented a statement to the committee and he also 
raised that example you raised. It's true that the committee 
did approve a request from Netherlands for -- if my memory is 
right -- about 2,000 tonnes of chemical materials for water 
treatment premises. At the same time, we have received dozens 
of requests along that line. Most of them are either rejected 
or put on hold and that is a case which has been approved 
because some members can see they include or they have enough 
information about the end use and end user and other relevant 
information concerning the issue. That was approved indeed. In 
the case of Jordanian applications, we received a number of 
them. Most of them are still (?shelved) on hold, not rejected 
outright because the committee members, some of them at least, 
are wishing to have further information concerning the request. 
That explained why. You see there could be similar requests, 
but because of the abundance or the absence of further 
information regarding certain aspect of the request, that also 
affect the decision of some members. 
  [Zalatimu] If my memory serves me correctly, I believe this 
particular incident, I believe you, sir, resubmitted the 
application providing full details. I mean the application of 
Netherlands and the application of Jordan were almost identical 
in the information they contain, and yet, you know, the outcome 
was to grant permission to Netherlands. 
  [Wan] Yes, indeed. Sometimes, you may provide further 
informations in that regard. But, it's up to the judgment of 
members to decide whether they are satisfactory or not. That's 
why I would say although they're of a similar or identical 
nature the applications, but, because of the information 
pertaining to the goods contained in that request that are 
really matters. Sometimes of crucial importance to determine 
whether that application met with the approval of the committee. 
  [Zalatimu] It seems to me that comes down to a technicality. 
I mean, what seems to me to be more important than some 
technicality in an application is the fact that Jordan has 
suffered greatly because of the sanctions and the embargo 
imposed on Iraq. And that seems to be much more important than, 
you know, a few missing words in an application. And it seems 
that the committee should consider the fact and the position of 
the Jordanian economy vis-a-vis this crisis, and not deny 
applications on the basis of you minor technicalities. I mean it 
is very hard for us as Jordanians to understand why we are not 
given permission to export, as you say, based on the 
technicalities. 
  [Wan] I'll certainly convey what you said to the committee 
members. What I want to stress in this respect is that if the 
requester provide enough information regarding that particular 
request they have a better chance to be considered by the 
committee. That's why when the chairman wrote to the permanent 
representative of Jordan to the United Nations, he said that it 
would be a greatly helpful if fully detail information about the 
relevant product and end user and the general circumstances 
related to the export is included on the application form when 
it is initially submitted for the consideration of the committee. 
  [Zalatimu] Thank you gentlemen, and good evening.

<F P=106> [By STAR staff writer Osama al-Sharif ] </F>
  [Text] Minister of Finance Mr. Sami Qammuh said that the 
prolonging of the UN enforced embargo on al-'Aqabah is a form of 
"pressure on Jordan for a political purpose" and that this will 
not be accepted by Jordan. He said interception and inspection 
of al-'Aqabah-bound vessels has increased over the last few 
weeks, and that it is time that this "intervention" in Jordanian 
affairs be stopped. 
  "We never agreed or accepted these practices since the 
beginning," he said. 
  His Majesty King Husayn told ambassadors of the five 
permanent members to the Security Council on Monday [28 March] 
that Jordan's resumption of its role in the peace process is 
conditional to an immediate resolution of the siege enforced on 
al-'Aqabah. 
  In an interview with THE STAR this week, Mr. Qammuh said the 
interception and inspection of vessels coming to al-'Aqabah by 
U.S.- led ships in the Red Sea "is in contradiction with 
international law and with the UN Charter." He added that the 
naval act is not supported by any UN resolution and has no legal 
warrant. 
  "We have informed the Security Council Sanctions Committee 
(of Jordanian grievances) and the Prime Minister visited New 
York and addressed this committee and submitted detailed reports 
about the practices and the losses Jordan had been incurring due 
to the interception of vessels and the embargo against Iraq and 
we are still waiting for a response," Mr. Qammuh said. "No less 
than 12 documents have been sent (to the UN), and we received 
lots of promises but we have not seen implementation of these 
promises." 
  The minister reiterated Jordanian demands for compensations 
to the losses incurred by the Jordanian economy as a direct 
result of the embargo. "The losses amount to more than $1.3 
billion and with the heavy burden Jordan is shouldering this 
additional burden will aggravate an already difficult financial 
situation," Mr. Qammuh said. 
  Since the naval blockade was enforced in 1990, over 1700 
commercial vessels were inspected by naval forces positioned at 
the Straits of Tiran. "They were inspected, rerouted, but none 
was found to be carrying irregular or unacceptable cargo," Mr. 
Qammuh said. 
  He added that Jordan has accepted an interim arrangement of 
"an independent, international, nonprofit organization to check 
on shore cargo coming to al-'Aqabah because we wanted to 
cooperate with the Sanctions Committee." But he pointed that 
even such an arrangement does not apply to any of the countries 
bordering Iraq. 
  "We have been acting in good faith and we are committed to 
our international responsibilities," the minister said. "We 
expect other parties to be equally committed and equally fair in 
treating and handling the problems concerning the peace process."

  [Text] Cairo, 31 Mar (MENA)--A locally made explosive 
device planted by an unidentified man under a car parked outside 
the International Trade Bank near the al-Zamalik Club fence on 
Jami'at al-Dual al-'Arabiyah Street in the al-Muhandisin 
neighborhood of al-Jizah went off this morning. The explosion
