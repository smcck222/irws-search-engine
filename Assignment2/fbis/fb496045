  [Text] Cairo, March 31 (AFP) -- A powerful bomb exploded at 
a bank in the Egyptian capital on Thursday [31 March], damaging 
the building and nearby cars, but causing no casualties, police 
said. 
  Witnesses had earlier said several passers-by were lightly 
injured by the blast, which blew out the building's windows. 
  The outlawed Islamic militant group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah 
[Islamic Group] later said it had placed a time bomb under a 
parked car which exploded outside the branch of the Egyptian 
Trade Development Bank. 
  The booby-trapped car and four others parked nearby were 
destroyed when they caught fire. 
  The al-Jama'ah said in a statement sent to AFP that the 
attack had been carried out "in revenge for the torture and 
humiliations inflicted on Islamic detainees." 
  It was the first bomb explosion at a bank during opening 
hours, despite a series of such bombings in recent months. 
  The al-Jama'ah, which has been waging a two-year violent 
campaign against the secular government of President Husni 
Mubarak, previously claimed responsibility for about 10 bombings 
this month. 
  The statement warned that more attacks would follow to 
avenge 
human rights violations in Egypt's prisons, which it alleged had 
"increased in recent days." 
  It also repeated accusations that banks were involved in 
usury by charging interest, which is outlawed by the Koran.

<F P=106> [Interview with Coptic Pope Shanudah by 'Abdallah </F>
al-Sinnawi; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Sinnawi] What were the motives of the attack 
on the al-Muharraq Monastery? According to your information, 
was it an isolated incident or was it premeditated? 
  [Shanudah] I do not know the motives of those people; they 
are in their minds and hearts, and I cannot express them. But 
the incident apparently took place as follows: Some monks were 
seeing off guests to a microbus outside. The monastery's door 
was opened. A terrorist happened to be passing by in his car. 
The door was open, the man had a machine gun in his hand, and 
the chance was there. He fired his bullets and killed two monks 
and some guests. It was merely an opportunity that he found too 
good to miss. 
  [Al-Sinnawi] Do you believe that the attack was not planned? 
  [Shanudah] I believe that it was not planned or 
premeditated. 
No one knew that the monastery's door would be open at that 
particular time and that some monks would be out seeing some 
guests off. It was merely a chance incident. 
  [Al-Sinnawi] Is it not possible that the attack was an 
attempt, even an individual one, to create sectarian sedition? 
  [Shanudah] The term "sectarian sedition" was invented by 
[the 
late President] Anwar al-Sadat. We had never known this term 
before al-Sadat. These people want to disrupt public order in 
general, and if this can be achieved by attacks on foreign 
tourists, operations against police, bombs against banks, or 
attacks on Copts, then it is fine. Even trains are now being 
attacked; the aim is to disrupt security. Moreover, the 
monasteries date back to the Roman era. They are like castles, 
with high walls; it is not easy to attack them. I have no doubt 
that the attack was individual and largely carried out by 
chance. We cannot talk about "chance," unplanned sedition. 
  [Al-Sinnawi] When was the last time a monastery was 
attacked? 
  [Shanudah] This is the first time in the modern age. The 
whole thing means that the attacker had no feelings of love and 
was far from right. What was the sin of some monks or monastery 
guests? Monks are virtuous, humble worshipers who have nothing 
to do with any disputes or rivalries. Why should they be 
attacked? But do not forget that the al-Muharraq Monastery is 
located in Asyut, which is raging with violence. 
  [Al-Sinnawi] Some people say monasteries and churches are 
storing weapons for the decisive time. 
  [Shanudah] What is the decisive time? 
  [Al-Sinnawi] When the prestige of the state is about to fall 
and the groups of political Islam come close to governing. 
  [Shanudah] No. The state's prestige cannot be lost. Anyway, 
this is a rumor that has been proved false and that we have 
repeatedly denied. If some people are exaggerating things to 
the point where they say without thinking that the monasteries 
contain weapons arsenals, then my response to them is clear: 
  First, our monasteries and churches are open to anyone, 
including non-Christians. Our Muslim brothers frequently visit 
these places for social and national functions. I say it once 
more: You have carte blanche, go see for yourselves whether 
there are weapons. 
  Second, the Christians do not carry arms and will not do so 
unless they are provided by the state, the Armed Forces, or the 
police. How can the Christian, whose religion teaches him a 
life of modesty and tells him to turn his other cheek to whoever 
slaps him, bear arms against his brothers in the homeland, 
against his society? At the end of al-Sadat's presidency, large 
numbers of Coptic bishops, priests, and members of the laity 
were arrested. Did you ever hear anyone calling for the use of 
weapons? 
  Third, where is the Ministry of Interior on this matter? Why 
has it not yet discovered the alleged arsenals of weapons in the 
monasteries and churches? The churches and monasteries are open 
to it. Why, throughout the past years, have we not heard or 
read in the newspapers about arms being seized in a monastery or 
church? 
  [Al-Sinnawi] Could the deteriorating security situation 
provide the necessary reason for some Copts to think about 
forming militias or starting to train in the use of weapons? 
This is a possibility that has evidence to prove it. 
  [Shanudah] It is impossible to have such militias, and also 
impossible for the security situation to deteriorate to such an 
extent. Is it possible that some individual troublemakers, or a 
handful of individuals, could lead to a complete breakdown of 
the security system and the collapse of the state? I completely 
rule out a scenario like the one you are talking about. I do 
not only rule it out, but I regard it as impossible. It is 
intended to create an atmosphere of fear among people; no more, 
no less. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Sinnawi] After the Hebron massacre and its 
repercussions, do you feel satisfied with your stances prior to 
the massacre regarding banning visits to Jerusalem until Copts 
and Muslims gain access to it together? What would your stance 
have been had the head of the Egyptian church responded to the 
calls for normalization at once, before the massacre had taken 
place? 
  [Shanudah] We follow a basic principle that we are convinced 
of from the bottom of our hearts. Many things happen, and we 
shall continue to have the same stance. When some tourist 
agencies continued to advertise in the newspapers about trips to 
Jerusalem because they believed that the Gaza-Jericho Agreement 
had found a solution to the Palestinian problem, I said: 
"Listen to me people. The problems have not yet been resolved. 
The situation has not changed yet, despite the Gaza-Jericho 
Agreement." Israel is still placing obstacles in matters such 
as the area of Jericho, the crossings, and other issues. 
  This agreement, which many did not like and others 
considered 
a mere step, required tremendous effort to be achieved. There 
is a popular saying: We accepted defeat, but even defeat 
rejected us. 
  I said: The situation is not over yet and our stance 
continues to be the same. I published many statements in the 
public newspapers and Coptic magazines. I still cling to the 
stances I expressed in these statements. Then, the Hebron 
massacre took place to prove that what we had said was right. 
Travel agencies, whether owned by Muslims or Copts, should 
place their national principles and the general interests of the 
whole Arab homeland before all else. They should not profit 
from tourism or use superficial advertising that takes advantage 
of people's love and respect for Jerusalem. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Sinnawi] After the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the 
al-Azhar shaykh called for liberating Jerusalem. He said that 
this is the duty of every Muslim. Is there a possibility of 
coordinating stances with the office of al-Azhar shaykh on this 
issue? 
  [Shanudah] Yes. We call on him to discuss with us the 
practical stances for liberating Jerusalem and retrieving our 
Islamic and Christian holy shrines. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The Asyut security organs have arrested five 
dangerous terrorists whose job it was to monitor the movements 
of policemen and their houses in obedience to instructions given 
them by fugitive terrorist leaders. The plan was to prepare for 
a number of terrorist operations following the capture of some 
of their leaders and the liquidation of others in armed clashes 
with the police. 
  A responsible security source stated that these terrorists 
were arrested during raids on dens of terrorism in the slum area 
of al-Walidiyah in Asyut city. The raid was staged after a 
terrorist element informed on this group that was shadowing the 
movements of some police officers, watching their houses, and 
reporting this information to those charged with implementing 
the new terrorist plan despite the failure of most of their 
criminal plans. The source added that the security forces are 
continuing their encirclement of al-Walidiyah area, which is 
regarded as a criminal and terrorist den in Asyut. 
  The raids resulted in the arrest of 23 active terrorists, 
including two important terrorists from Abu Tij, and the capture 
of two rifles, one Lee Enfield and a hunting rifle. [passage

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Mar (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has decided to divide Asyut Governorate into four zones, 
each of which will be supervised by an officer with the rank of 
major general. 
  The minister also decided to appoint two deputies to the 
director of Asyut security to facilitate the issuance and 
following up of decisions. 
  The decision falls within the context of the security 
strategy pursued by the Interior Ministry in view of the 
geographical terrain and social nature of Asyut Governorate. 
  The interior minister's decision also took care to bolster 
the Asyut security directorate with a group of highly trained 
officers to meet current security needs. 
  Minister al-Alfi met earlier today with the new commands 
that 
have moved to Asyut Governorate and instructed them on security 
operations there. 
  The minister also issued a decision to set up four public 
directorates in the prison authority and to upgrade the latter 
into a department. 
  These directorates have been bolstered by commanding 
officers 
who enjoy a high level of security performance.

  [Text] Cairo, March 31 (AFP) -- An Egyptian human rights 
group called Thursday [31 March] for the release of 22 lawyers 
held for up to four years for defending Moslem militants. 
  The Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights said in a 
statement the detention of the lawyers was "an act of arbitrary 
detention ... in violation of both the Egyptian constitution and 
law as well as their basic human rights." 
  It said most of the lawyers had been "found innocent by the 
courts of all charges brought against them" and were being held 
despite orders for their release. 
  "This is a particularly alarming violation in view of the 
role that these lawyers play in upholding the integrity of the 
law," the statement added. 
  It said the lawyers had been held because they had visited 
and prepared appeals for prisoners charged in terrorist cases 
and were falsely accused of passing on information to people on 
the outside of the prison. 
  One of the attorneys, Hasan al-Gharabawi Shihatah, has been 
held since 1989 even though he was cleared of all charges in May 
1990 and despite 25 release orders, the group added. 
  It has sent a list of 150 names to President Husni Mubarak 
of 
people still being held despite being declared innocent. 
  Islamic militants have targeted banks and foreigners in a 
two-year campaign to topple Mubarak's government.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Muhammad Sharaf: "The Peace Process Between </F>
the Palestinians and Israel Overcomes a Big Hurdle"] 
  [Text] If the weeks that have passed since the heinous 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque crime have proved anything, they prove that 
the peace process is facing real dangers that no one will be 
able to control in the absence of certain essential conditions. 
The first condition is that the parties concerned, especially 
Israel, prove with practical deeds that this process is not 
being used for maneuvers or compromises over firm principles. 
One of these principles is that there must be security for both 
the Arab Palestinian and Israeli sides. This means that Israel 
should not place the issue of its own security above all other 
considerations, especially the security of the Palestinians and 
their legitimate human and political rights. 
  The second condition is that all parties should scrupulously 
adhere to all the agreements they reach, especially on the 
timetables of these agreements. As events and developments have 
proved, it is indisputable that Israel's non-adherence to the 
timetables of the Declaration of Principles and the Gaza-Jericho 
Agreement has given the enemies and opponents of peace a chance 
to try to scuttle the peace process. 
  The third condition is that all international regional and 
international circumstances dictate the need to speed up the 
peace process. 
  We say this in the light of the announcement early today 
that 
the Palestinian and Israeli sides have reached an agreement on 
the security arrangements in Hebron. The details of this 
agreement will be announced later. The negotiations will then 
directly move to the current bas in the way he talks. Sources 
close to the talks have stated that Egyptian diplomacy has 
played a key role in helping the two sides to reach an agreement 
on the security arrangements in Hebron. These sources have 
stated that the focal point of these arrangements is the two 
sides' agreement on a strong international presence after a 
prolonged Israel hesitation in accepting it. 
  A major issue in during the phase of Palestinian self-rule, 
lasting until agreement is reached on the final status of the 
occupied territories, should now be addressed -- that is, mutual 
security in these territories. Events since the al-Ibrahim 
Mosque crime prove, as they have since 1967, that it is 
impossible for Israel to remain solely responsible for security 
in these occupied territories. The legacy of enmity and hatred 
between the Palestinians and Israelis, especially the extremist 
Israelis, is heavy. Events and developments indicate in no 
uncertain terms that the Jewish settlements in the occupied 
territories are illegal and a grave mistake from the practical 
point of view. Those who have agreed to settle among the 
Palestinians in areas of high population density are mostly 
ultra-extremists and adventurists. The repressive practices of 
the occupation forces prove that these forces cannot get rid of 
their hatred and fanaticism toward the Palestinians. 
  Therefore, the strong international presence in Hebron must 
extend to the remaining occupied territories, including 
Jerusalem, so that the final peace agreement can provide for the 
disengagement of the two sides. In any case, it is somewhat 
reassuring that the peace process has so far been proceeding on 
a correct course despite the substantial obstacles and 
difficulties facing it.

  [Text] The government has backed down on its decision to 
allow Israel to participate in the Cairo International Fair 
scheduled to open on 9 April because of the overwhelming anger 
that swept through Egypt after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre 
in Hebron. 
  Engineer Hamid 'Atwah, director of the fair authority, said 
Israel will not participate in the fair through its own pavilion 
or through the U.S. pavilion. Israel has not participated in 
the fair since 1986, following the attack that the "Egypt's 
Revolution" organization launched on the Israeli pavilion in 
1985. 
  Two weeks ago AL-'ARABI quoted diplomatic sources, as well 
as 
fair sources, as saying that the government was inclined to 
allow Israel to participate in the fair by allocating space for 
it in the U.S. pavilion.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 Mar (MENA)--A round of Egyptian-German 
military talks was held today under the chairmanship of 
Lieutenant General Salah Halabi, Chief of Staff of the Armed 
Forces; and Klaus Naumann, Chief of Staff of the German Armed 
Forces, who is currently visiting Cairo. 
  The session was attended by senior Armed Forces commanders 
from both countries. At the beginning of the session, Lt. Gen. 
Halabi made a speech stressing that it is high time, now that we 
are at the doorstep of the 21st century, to work together for 
the good and safety of our peoples and to deepen the concept of 
an overall security for all mankind, so that the next century 
may be one of security and stability for all the world. 
  Lt. Gen. Halabi added: We look forward to a world marked by 
amity, accord, wellbeing, and common action for the coming 
generations, which we do not want to suffer from the wars that 
our generations have gone through. We also call for a 
comprehensive disarmament and a ban on nuclear, biological, and 
chemical tests so that humanity may stay free of any threat to 
its security and well-being, he added. 
  Lt. Gen. Halabi noted that Egypt took it upon itself to 
promote peace in the Arab region after it had chosen a clear 
path. He noted that all parties must have equal faith in the 
need to achieve a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace in our 
region to achieve a bright future and security for the region's 
peoples. He hoped that today's talks will lead to fruitful 
results as far as joint action is concerned to preserve security 
and stability in the region as well as in Europe. He added: 
Egypt's participation in the European security conference in 
Rome a few months ago was an indication of the role we could 
play in this regard. 
  The talks dealt with all aspects of military cooperation 
between Egypt and German and ways of developing them.

as friendly. He added that they agreed to work together to 
straighten out bilateral relations. He noted that Minister Musa 
expressed readiness to meet him in Khartoum. They will agree 
upon a date later. He said the problem of Hala'ib can be solved 
through negotiations between the two countries, not through the 
media. He stressed that Sudan would allow nothing that would 
harm Egypt's security. 
  Abu-Salih pointed out that Sudan held talks with the rebels 
in the south to find a solution to the problem, adding that 
Sudan cannot agree to the right of self-determination for the 
south. He noted that the Arab states' position on the south is 
that they are against any attempt to separate it from the north 
and that they support Sudan's unity and territorial integrity. 
  The Sudanese foreign minister pointed out that resolving the 
inter-Arab differences requires courage, a strong will, and a 
mechanism. The Arab League secretary general, he added, 
proposed a mechanism for resolving these differences and 
restoring true Arab solidarity. He noted that Sudan wants its 
relations with all the Arab countries to be normal, so that 
solidarity can be restored, differences eliminated, and things 
restored to normal.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Abu-Salih: There Is Sectarian </F>
Dissimilarity Between Sudan and Iran"] 
  [Excerpt] Cairo, AL-HAYAH -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Dr. 
Husayn Abu-Salih has announced that his country will agree to 
resume the Egyptian-Sudanese talks on the disputed Hala'ib 
triangle in Khartoum in accordance with what was agreed with 
Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa last July. 
  He said in a press conference held in the foreign 
correspondents association in Cairo yesterday that his country's 
agreement to hold talks on the Hala'ib triangle represents a 
kind of concession. He said: "I pledged to safeguard Sudan's 
sovereignty over its territory." 
  He added: "Hala'ib is Sudanese." He said that Egypt's 
decision to establish a new electoral constituency there is 
tantamount to an Egyptian confirmation that it has never 
belonged to Egypt before. He described his country's decision to 
appoint a governor for Hala'ib as an internal matter within the 
framework of its sovereignty over its territory. 
  He said: "The governor will go there to assume the duties of 
his post at whatever time he wants." He expressed Sudan's 
willingness to accept mediation or arbitration with regard to 
the triangle. 
  Abu-Salih urged Egyptian officials to "stop pursuing the 
fait 
accompli policy and to consider the triangle a disputed 
territory." He held Egypt responsible for "the delay in 
convening the ministerial meeting in Khartoum." 
  On Egypt's criticisms of Sudan for sheltering extremists, 
Abu-Salih renewed his invitation for an Egyptian security 
delegation to visit Sudan to ascertain there are no terrorist 
camps in Sudan. He said that "Sudan's security is linked to 
Egypt's security, and Sudan would not allow Egypt's security to 
be threatened from its territory." 
  He denied that Sudan has received any Egyptian lists 
demanding the extradition of a group of extremists who are 
wanted to appear before the Egyptian judiciary. He stressed 
that "Sudan has not received any lists." He expressed "Sudan's 
willingness to bolster security cooperation between the two 
countries." 
  With regard to Sudan's relationship with Iran, he described 
this relationship as "less than normal." He pointed out that 
"Sudan is Sunni...and Iran is Shiite, and there is a difference 
between the two sects." 
  He added: "Sudan is entitled to establish relations with any 
state without interference from anyone." He said that "any talk 
about this relationship is interference in Sudanese internal 
affairs -- which we reject." He strongly denied the presence in 
Sudan of any forces from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. He 
said: "Anyone who has such evidence should submit it." 
  Regarding the presence of [Saudi businessman] Usamah 
Bin-Ladin [in Sudan] and his support for fundamentalist 
extremists, he said: "Usamah Bin-Ladin lives in Sudan normally 
and is engaged in construction work on the most vital road in 
Sudan, that is the Khartoum-'Atbarah road. About 170 km of this 
road have been completed. He has no activities other than his 
trade businesses." 
  Abu-Salih said: "Madeleine Albright, U.S. permanent 
representative to the United Nations, will visit Sudan the day 
after tomorrow, Thursday, in the framework of the Sudanese-U.S. 
talks. We are waiting for the message which she will carry from 
U.S. President Bill Clinton to Sudanese President 'Umar Hasan 
al-Bashir." He expects the message to deal with the Sudanese 
peace talks held in Nairobi recently. 
  He added that Sudan has indictment evidence against states 
he 
did not name and Israel, "supported with documents showing the 
types of weapons seized from southerners during the fighting, 
but we prefer not to reveal this evidence at present." [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> ["Closeup" Column By Salamah Ahmad Salamah: "We and the </F>
Korean Crisis"] 
  [Text] For one reason or another, the United States chose 
this particular time -- after 20 years -- to create a severe 
crisis with North Korea because of unconfirmed "possibilities," 
lacking in substantiated proof, that North Korea is producing or 
is on the verge of producing nuclear weapons. This crisis, 
which escalates and then abates for reasons that are 
incomprehensible to us, seems to be remote from our area and to 
have nothing to do with us. As a matter of fact, it is linked 
to U.S. policies that are becoming clearer and more determined. 
These policies are generally aimed at preventing proliferation 
of nuclear arms in various parts of the world on the one hand 
and at completely controlling arms shipments to the Middle East 
on the other -- naturally, this is to guarantee Israel's 
continued superiority. 
  North Korea is not an unlikely source of certain types of 
weapons for some Arab countries. There are U.S., European, and 
Russian agreements to "control" arms shipments to the Middle 
East, but these agreements are subject to the mood in the United 
States. The United States violated these agreements with the 
sale of modern military aircraft that it decided to offer to 
Israel recently as a down payment for starting the peace talks. 
  Twenty years ago, there were doubts that North Korea had a 
nuclear plan that might be used to produce weapons. But North 
Korea signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty in 1985 and it 
allowed the IAEA to inspect its installations in 1991. Amid the 
continuing tense relations between North and South Korea, the 
North Korean Government decided last June not to allow the IAEA 
inspectors to check its installations and threatened to withdraw 
from the Nonproliferation Treaty if the U.S. and South Korean 
pressure continues. 
  North Korea has played on the nerves of the United States 
and 
South Korea: It finally allowed the IAEA inspectors to check 
some installations but then suddenly prevented them from 
completing their mission. The United States tried to use this 
crisis to gain access to the center of the closed society in 
North Korea, but it failed. The crisis was referred to the 
Security Council. The United States also tried to use the PRC 
and Japan to pressure North Korea, but the PRC stated that this 
crisis must he resolved peacefully without threats. 
  The United States so far has not one single confirmed bit of 
evidence that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons. North 
Korea probably is playing this card for its own purposes in the 
conflict with South Korea. The U.S. stance seems strange and 
incomprehensible. It leaves in Israel nuclear weapons the 
existence of which have been proven beyond a shadow of doubt and 
searches for nuclear "ghosts" in North Korea. The whole game is 
intended to serve Israel.

<F P=106> [From the "Comment" Column by Husayn 'Abd-al-Wahid: </F>
"Clinton's Promises"] 
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton's position on the issue 
of Jerusalem has become some sort of a puzzle. In the past few 
days, statements by Clinton and officials in his Administration 
about the issue have been strangely and suspiciously 
contradictory. When the U.S. President met with leaders of the 
"Zionist lobby" in the United States he emphasized to them his 
support for making Jerusalem the unified capital of Israel. A 
day later, the U.S. State Department issued a statement 
stressing that there is no change in Washington's position 
regarding Jerusalem! A few days later, Jewish sources once 
again quoted President Clinton as backing Jerusalem as the 
unified capital of Israel. 
  Later, news agencies quoted him as affirming that the status 
of Jerusalem must be determined through Arab-Israeli 
negotiations. The Arabs understood this to mean Clinton's 
promise to them not to recognize the legitimacy of the Israeli 
occupation of Jerusalem. 
  In general, the U.S. comments, which are designed to satisfy 
the Arabs, were marked by a great deal of deliberate ambiguity. 
Former U.S. President George Bush was once asked his opinion on 
declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel. His specific and 
firm answer was that Jerusalem is part of the occupied Arab 
territories and that its final status, like that of the other 
Arab cities and villages that Israel occupied in 1967, will be 
determined by the peace talks. 
  However, the current U.S. Administration confines itself to 
emphasizing that its "position on Jerusalem has not changed." 
The confusing thing about this phrase is that the position of 
the Democratic Party and its presidential candidate in the 
recent elections, Bill Clinton, recognized Jerusalem, both East 
and West, as the capital of Israel and even sought to move the 
U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Zionists viewed 
this position as a promise no less important or significant than 
the infamous "Balfour Declaration." 
  Thus, the "no-change in the U.S. position on Jerusalem" 
means 
one of two things: First, that Clinton meant that he adheres to 
his position announced during his election campaign, namely to 
recognize the legitimacy of the Israeli occupation of Jerusalem; 
or second, that he meant they continue to adhere to the position 
of the preceding U.S. administrations, which viewed Jerusalem as 
an occupied Arab territory. 
  I believe that this duality in meanings is intentional and 
deliberate, acting upon the foxy Kissinger's theory that "modern 
politics should be hard to understand." We apologize to Mr. 
Kissinger, but we are nevertheless trying to understand. 
Unfortunately, our attempt to do so leads us to believe that the 
whole thing is nothing but a trial balloon by Washington to see 
what the Arab and Islamic reactions would be if the U.S. Embassy 
were to be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Thus, the Arabs 
must counter this U.S. ambiguity with full clarity and firmness 
before it is too late.

<F P=106> [Article by Ihsan Bakr: "Questions About the Role of Full </F>
Partner"] 
  [Text] It is everybody's expectation, including the 
pessimists', that the parties to the Middle East conflict are 
about to return to the bilateral negotiations, not consequent to 
a pause for consultations with their governments or for more 
study and examination, but in the wake of the overwhelming 
popular anger that swept the Arab world in the wake of the 
massacre of worshipers inside the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. 
  The aftermath of this massacre continues to pose big 
question 
marks about the usefulness of the negotiations themselves 
considering the U.S. Administration's decisive and firm bias 
toward Israel and the Rabin government's total refusal to comply 
with the international resolutions. 
  After three weeks of consultations, pressures, and 
postponements, the Security Council condemned the ugly massacre 
after the martyrs' blood had cooled, the martyrs' and injured 
people's blood had dried, a lethal blow had been dealt to the 
peace efforts, and acts of violence and counter-violence had 
engulfed the occupied Arab territories. The resolution 
condemning the massacre was clear and unanimous but has left two 
major issues unresolved. 
  Yes. The resolution underlined the need to provide 
protection for Palestinian citizens inside the occupied 
territories. But it has not told us how this protection will be 
provided and who will be responsible for it. That was an 
intentional lapse to negate the essence of the international 
resolution, especially as Israel has declared that it refuses to 
let UN forces do the protecting. But it appears that the 
Security Council resolutions are always deficient whenever they 
concern an Arab issue. The Council was asked to take a clear 
and frank stand on the issue of protecting the Palestinian 
citizens because it is difficult to restore calm to the occupied 
territories while there are armed criminal settlers with their 
fingers always pressing the trigger to kill innocent people. 
  The resolution, which took a long time to formulate, was 
adopted after the United States expressed reservations over the 
clause dealing with Jerusalem because Washington does not 
recognize Jerusalem as part of the occupied Arab territories, 
and it even appears that it does not admit that there is such a 
thing as occupied territories. President Clinton underlined 
this stance twice, once during the presidential elections when, 
as the Democratic candidate, he declared that Jerusalem will be 
Israel's capital. The second time was a few days ago when he 
stressed during a meeting with the leaders of the 
American-Israeli Political Action Committee that the United 
States regards unified Jerusalem as the capital of the State of 
Israel. 
  The U.S. Embassy in Cairo has issued a clarification of 
President Clinton's statements, and the U.S. State Department -- 
after a silence that lasted more than a week -- has said that 
there is no change in the U.S. stand on the Jerusalem issue. 
But the U.S. reservations in the Security Council over the 
clause on Jerusalem casts doubts and suspicions on the real U.S. 
stand on this issue, an issue that is close to the heart of all 
Arabs and Muslims. 
  The Security Council issued its resolution of condemnation 
and then sat back! It appears that this Council issues two 
types of resolutions: ones that are liable to be implemented 
and applied -- such as the cases of Iraq and Libya -- and other 
resolutions that cannot be implemented, especially if they deal 
with Israel and Arab rights. 
  Is it not strange that at a time when Israel is asking the 
Arabs to negotiate, achieve peace, and establish and normalize 
relations, and is demanding an end to the economic boycott and 
resumption of trade, it is also practicing organized terrorism 
against the Palestinians and building up its military arsenal? 
  The United States has raised a major hue and cry against 
Libya and imposed a comprehensive international embargo against 
it merely on the suspicion that two Libyans might have been 
involved in bombing an American plane over Lockerbie in 
Scotland. It is demanding that the two suspects be extradited 
to stand trial. And in its bizarre arrogance, the United States 
insists on maintaining the full international embargo on Iraq, 
plunging the Iraqi people into isolation, hunger, and medicine 
shortages; and it is leading a broad international campaign to 
remove Iraq's nuclear weapons and all other weapons. 
  While the United States is taking all these measures against 
Arab peoples, it does absolutely nothing about Israeli acts 
against the defenseless Palestinian people, and it observes the 
silence of the dead over Israel's possession of more than 200 
nuclear bombs that threaten all Arab peoples of the region. The 
United States is doing nothing to Israel despite its refusal to 
join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty! 
  This being the fact, we have a right to ask about the true 
U.S. role in the region and about U.S. objectives in the peace 
process. Is the United States seeking peace for Israel without 
returning the Arab land to its rightful owners? 
  The United States is telling everybody that it is a sponsor 
of the peace process, and it says it is a full partner. Indeed, 
it is preventing any other international party from intervening 
in the process, on the pretext that it is the "only mediator" 
that can intervene in the crisis. Even Russia, the other 
cosponsor of the peace process that was launched in Madrid, is 
not allowed to go beyond a decorative role. Having all these 
broad powers, when the United States is pushed into a position 
where it must make a difficult decision it hurriedly announces 
that it will not intervene in the negotiations, leaving the two 
sides, the Palestinians and the Israelis, face to face! 
  The political situation in the occupied territories 
threatens 
dire consequences due to this intentional disregard of Arab 
rights, total bias toward Israel, and insistence that the ball 
is in the Palestinian negotiators' court, portraying them as the 
obstacle to returning to the negotiating table. 
  It is Yasir 'Arafat's right to make inquiries, be skeptical, 
and demand genuine guarantees of protection for his people. He 
has a right to receive specific answers about the role of 
settlers and why the settlements have been planted in the middle 
of the Palestinian masses. 'Arafat's primary duty is to not be 
rushed, to be careful, and obtain all international guarantees. 
Their constant pressure on the PLO leadership to resume the 
negotiations unconditionally only shows that the United States 
and Israel want 'Arafat to accept unconditional surrender. 
  The United States is gravely deceiving itself and the whole 
Arab nation if it believes that this policy will lead to peace. 
The Palestinian people, together with all Arab peoples, will 
not accept the desecration of Arab land and Arab sanctities in 
return for a false peace. The peace that Yasir 'Arafat aims at 
and all the Arabs demand is based on the return of the land and 
the end of occupation.

<F P=106> ["Idea" column by Mustafa Amin] </F>
  [Text] If I were a member of a national dialogue committee 
I would call for the president to be elected directly by the 
entire nation, not by the People's Assembly acting on behalf of 
the people. And, I would demand that presidential elections be 
contested by many candidates, not one. 
  I would also call for a new constitution. The current 
Constitution is a vestige of a totalitarian regime that amassed 
power in the hands of one man. I would demand that the people 
become the source of all power. The parliament should have the 
right to pass a vote of no-confidence against the cabinet or any 
minister, as was the case in parliaments before the revolution. 
The parliament should also be able to amend the budget and 
overrule allocations that it judges to be inappropriate, a 
privilege that all parliaments, except ours, have. 
  I would demand that the Consultative Council be promoted 
from 
a Parent-Teacher-Association-style forum into a full-fledged 
senate with the power to bring down the cabinet. 
  Above all, I would demand the abolition of the disreputable 
[emergency] laws and the post of the socialist prosecutor 
[created by late President Anwar al-Sadat to investigate and try 
fraud and corruption cases. Detractors of this post believe 
such cases should be handled by ordinary law courts]. Civilian 
defendants should be tried at civilian courts, not at emergency 
or state security courts. Ordinary, not extraordinary, laws 
should be the law of the land. 
  I would call for the Shaykh al-Azhar to be elected by senior 
ulema. The posts of governor, town mayor, and village head 
should be filled through direct elections. 
  I would call for the abolition of the press authority 
[sultat] law, dubbed the press salad [salatat] law. Every 
citizen should have the right to issue a paper, even if only one 
reader were to read it. 
  Ministers and their wives and children should not be allowed 
to run their own businesses or accept gifts valued at more than 
100 pounds [$30]. Ministers should hand over the gifts they 
receive to a state-owned museum. 
  Parliamentary deputies should not combine their 
parliamentary 
duties with a government job. How can a deputy criticize a 
minister if the latter is his boss and as such has the power to 
promote or demote him? 
  We want a constitution for the 21st century. Despotic 
constitutions do not suit free people.

  [Text] The Islamic Council for Call and Relief yesterday 
denounced the Austrian government's intention to grant its 
European Literature Prize to Indian-born British author Salman 
Rushdie for his book The Satanic Verses. 
  In a statement it issued, the Council said that the panel of 
judges' choice of The Satanic Verses as an example of 
contemporary European literature is a shock that arouses 
feelings and shows a clear bias and vile prejudice on the part 
of the atheists and apostates. It appealed to the Austrian 
Government to reject the panel's choice. 
  The Austrian Ministry of Education and Arts has proposed 
that 
the prize be not awarded publicly, while Arts Minister Rudolf 
Scholten refused to hand it over in secret and postponed the 
award ceremony.

  [Text] Cairo, 31 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
has welcomed the agreement reached today between the 
Palestinians and the Israelis, which protects the Palestinians 
in Hebron in the occupied West Bank. 
  In statements upon his arrival from New Delhi, where he took 
part in the summit meeting of the Group of 15 that convened in 
India recently, Musa said that Egypt approves of this agreement 
if the Palestinians approve of it. 
  On developments in Burundi, Musa described the situation 
there as regrettable and said that Egypt tried to contain it. 
President Husni Mubarak sent an envoy there at the beginning of 
the crisis. The OAU secretary general also tried to send an 
African force to Burundi but officials there hesitated in 
accepting this force. 
  'Amr Musa noted that this evening he will contact the OAU 
secretary general to discuss steps that need to be taken to stop 
acts of violence in Burundi. 
  He added that he will submit a report on the situation in 
Burundi to President Husni Mubarak in his capacity as current 
OAU chairman. 
  Answering a question on the situation in South Africa, he 
said that recent developments there, such as clashes and 
bloodshed, are painful and will affect the elections. The 
objective of these elections is to establish democracy. 
  'Amr Musa said that Egypt is very upset by current 
developments in South Africa. He pointed out that a message 
will be sent from Egypt to Nelson Mandela, leader of the African 
National Congress, on this matter. 
  He added that an understanding will be reached with the OAU 
secretary general in light of the resolutions that were taken at 
the recent summit in Harare to find out what can be done to stop 
the deteriorating situation in South Africa. 
  On the meetings of the Group of 15, Musa said that Egypt 
submitted two projects to bolster cooperation among the 
countries of the group. He pointed out that the ministers of 
economy and trade will hold a meeting in Marrakech on 15 April 
before the GATT meeting to define the developing countries' 
stand on this agreement.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Apr (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
stated that he submitted a report to President Mubarak on the 
proceedings of the 4th summit of the Group of 15 [G-15] held 
recently in India. 
  He said that he briefed the president on the meetings he 
held 
with the heads of states who took part in the summit and 
delivered messages they sent to his excellency in response to 
his messages. 
  Musa affirmed in a statement today that the G-15 summit was 
important and showed that it is continuing its efforts to 
support the South-South dialogue in an age of world economic 
blocs. 
  The foreign minister noted that Egypt submitted two working 
papers on consolidating cooperation, not only among the G-15 
states but among all developing countries. He added that 
Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and Senegal have also presented 
working papers on consolidating cooperation among the countries 
of the South. 
  Musa affirmed that the 4th G-15 summit gained additional 
significance with the meeting of the businessmen forum on the 
sidelines. During this meeting, the private sector's role in 
consolidating cooperation among the group members was discussed. 
  He added that a commission was formed to follow up on the 
issues regarding the consolidation of cooperation and investment 
and the transfer of technology among the countries of the South. 
  Minister Musa added that the G-15 ministers of economy, 
trade, agriculture, scientific research, and technology have 
been invited to a meeting in Marrakech before the GATT meeting 
in mid-April to consider the impact GATT will have on developing 
countries' economies. 
  The minister said that a number of political issues were 
also 
discussed at the summit, primarily the role of the United 
Nations, the expansion of UN membership, and international 
terrorism. He noted that the conferees emphasized the need to 
stand up to that phenomenon, which threatens secure societies.

  [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to the 
Palestinian president, has affirmed that the Israeli withdrawal 
from Gaza and Jericho has actually begun and vanguards of the 
Palestinian police will deploy there within a week. 
  This follows the agreement reached by the Palestinian and

the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The agreement provides for the 
deployment of 160 international observers to oversee the 
arrangements.

  [Text] The Israeli delegation to the talks with the 
Palestinians has arrived in Cairo. The delegation is composed 
of Major General 'Uzi Dayan, Brigadier General Yom-Tov Sami', 
Brig. Gen. Tzvi Stauber, and the Foreign Ministry's legal 
adviser Yo'el Singer. 
  Military sources told our correspondent Karmela Menashe that 
the major obstacles in the discussions with the Palestinians 
have been removed and Israel can now meet the original timetable. 
  Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, one of the Fatah leaders in the Gaza 
Strip, told Qol Yisra'el this morning that the violent incidents 
in the Gaza Strip were unconnected to the progress made in the 
peace negotiations. In his opinion, once the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] withdraws and the Palestinian police force 
assumes responsibility for maintaining public order, the police 
will impose their authority on the entire Palestinian 
population, including the members of Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement].

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 3 Apr (MENA)--The Security Committee, a 
part of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on ways of 
implementing the Gaza-Jericho Palestinian autonomy agreement, 
began meeting in Cairo today. Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, is leading the 
Palestinian side of this committee, while 'Uzi Dayan, head of 
the Israeli General Staff's Planning Branch, heads the Israeli 
side. 
  The committee is discussing a timetable for the Israeli 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho and the deployment of 
Palestinian forces there, including the number of Palestinian 
police to be stationed in the two areas, their tasks, and the 
equipment they will use. 
  Official Palestinian sources told MENA that there are 
indications that Israel will accept the Palestinian demand for 
10,000 Palestinian policemen. Formerly it insisted on limiting 
the number to only 6,000 policemen. They explained that this 
change in the Israeli position comes in the wake of the Hebron 
massacre of hundreds [as received] of Palestinian worshipers. 
  Representatives of the international observers from Norway 
and Denmark who will be deployed in Hebron are expected to join 
the meeting of the Security Committee. 
  It should be recalled that the observers team will consist 
of 
160 members from Norway, Denmark, and Italy. 
  The Palestinian delegation has held meetings in Cairo for 
the 
past two days to discuss the dispatch of Palestinian police 
officers to Gaza and Jericho. It has been decided that the 
first 300 police will enter these areas on Tuesday [5 April]. 
They will be followed by 1,500 more policemen on Thursday. 
Others will follow later. They will prepare for taking over 
control of the self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho in accordance 
with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  Israeli sources in Cairo said that General Amnon Shahaq will 
arrive Monday morning to participate in the negotiations 
regarding the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First 
agreement. [passage omitted] 
  Other negotiations committees on the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho self-rule agreement are scheduled to begin their 
meetings tomorrow. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, April 2 (AFP) -- Israel and the PLO are close 
to agreeing on the deployment of up to 10,000 Palestinian 
policemen in Gaza and Jericho, chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th 
said Saturday [2 April]. 
  "An accord on the number of policemen should be concluded 
during meetings of the PLO and Israeli security committee" which 
begin here on Sunday, Sha'th said. 
  The talks would also focus on "preparations for the 
deployment" of the police and security arrangements for the West 
Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza Strip. 
  "I don't think there is currently a problem on the number of 
policemen, which will be around 10,000," Sha'th said after talks 
here Saturday with Palestinian officials to prepare for the 
deployment. 
  Under a security accord signed in Cairo Thursday Israel and 
the PLO agreed that 160 foreign observers would be deployed in 
the mosque massacre town of Hebron, and a first contingent of 
Palestinian police would be sent to Gaza. 
  Sha'th added that the talks on transferring civilian powers 
would be held here on Monday, while negotiations on the size of 
the Jericho autonomous area would be conducted by PLO chief 
Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.

  [Text] Cairo, April 3 (AFP) -- The PLO wants Islamic 
militant prisoners held by Israel to be included in any accord 
on the release of Palestinian detainees, PLO chief negotiator 
Nabil Sha'th said here Sunday [3 April]. 
  "All Palestinian prisoners are our responsibility, whether 
they belong to (the Islamic Resistance Movement) Hamas or not," 
Sha'th told AFP. 
  "The question of the release of prisoners will be examined 
today (Sunday) or tomorrow, and the Hamas prisoners remain the 
main problem," Sha'th said, adding that the releases would take 
place in stages after an accord to launch Palestinian autonomy 
was signed. 
  Israel and the PLO started intensive negotiations here 
Sunday 
to launch Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho within 10 
days, after a break of five weeks because of the Hebron massacre. 
  Israel has freed more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners since 
the autonomy negotiations began last October. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin announced Sunday that more 
Palestinian prisoners would be freed and others who had been 
deported or fled would be allowed to return to the territories. 
  "These measures will concern only those wanted or expelled, 
who do not have blood on their hands, grassroots militants and 
not frontline political leaders," he said. 
  A Foreign Ministry official said the majority of the 10,000 
Palestinians still in Israeli jails would be released in several 
stages.

  [Text] In Cairo, Israeli and Palestinian delegations led 
by General 'Uzi Dayan and Dr. Nabil Sha'th today resumed 
negotiations on Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Gen. Dayan, who heads the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
Planning Branch, told reporters that Israel hoped the 
negotiations would be completed quickly. 
  Nabil Sha'th told Qol Yisra'el's correspondent in Cairo Arye 
Gus the PLO want to conclude the agreement by the 13 April 
deadline in the Declaration of Principles. 
  [Begin Sha'th recording] We are starting the negotiations on 
the withdrawal plan from Gaza and Jericho, which is really the 
completion of what we had started and stopped just because of 
the massacre. We hope to finish as soon as possible the 
withdrawal plan, the deployment of the Palestinian police force, 
and the remaining factors of security in the Gaza and Jericho. 
The entry of the Palestinian police force will start with first 
a small group of maybe seven or eight people to go to make the 
arrangements and then be followed by a larger number to take 
over some of the camps and to start preparing within a week at 
most, maybe Thursday. There will be a detailed schedule that 
will coincide with gradual withdrawal of the Israeli Armed 
Forces, so that by the end of this period the Palestinian police 
force will be fully deployed. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Opening speech by Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben </F>
Ali in Tunis on 2 April -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of the God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. Your Excellencies: It give me great pleasure to 
welcome you to your country Tunisia, which is happy to welcome 
you as its respected brothers. Today, Tunisia is once again 
proud to host the sixth session of the Arab Maghreb Union [AMU] 
Presidential Council. On your behalf, please permit me to 
welcome brother Liamine Zeroual, the head of the Algerian state, 
on the occasion of his joining our council. We would like to 
renew our congratulations to him on his assumption of this noble 
responsibility. We wish him every success and all progress in 
the interest of the brotherly Algerian people. We are sure that 
his competence, virtues, and belief in Maghreban unity will 
strongly contribute toward giving more impetus to the march of 
our union. 
  I am also pleased to welcome brother militant Yasir 'Arafat, 
the president of the state of Palestine. Through him, we send 
humble greetings to the brotherly Palestinian people, and renew 
our support and backing for their heroic struggle for the 
recovery of their legitimate rights. [passage omitted] 
  Your Excellencies: The AMU is committed to working for the 
sake of rapprochement and harmony amongst nations; it stresses 
dialogue and negotiations as a method for solving conflicts; and 
it is loyal to the ties of brotherhood and solidarity within the 
Maghreban family. As a result, the endeavors of the AMU have 
continued uninterrupted on the path for finding a peaceful, 
just, and honorable solution to the conflict existing between 
the sisterly Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah and 
certain Western states. Maghreban efforts have concentrated on 
a persistent search for a political solution to this crisis 
within the framework of respecting international legality and 
the protection of the dignity and sovereignty of the Libyan 
people; we also warned against the repercussions of the its 
suffering as a result of the continuous sanctions, in addition 
to the negative outcome of this ongoing crisis. 
  The Maghreban efforts have been joined to those of the Arab 
family regarding this issue within the seven-man committee; the 
moves were coordinated on all international levels, mainly at 
the African and Islamic levels, the Nonaligned Movement, and the 
United Nations. It is only natural that the AMU should continue 
its contribution to all endeavors, on all international 
platforms, to help find a solution to this crisis and reach a 
just and honorable political solution. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] On the sidelines of the proceedings of the Arab 
Maghreb Union [AMU] summit, an official ceremony was held 
yesterday at the Foreign Ministry during which 11 Maghrebian 
agreements on cooperation were signed. These agreements pertain 
to a number of fields, mainly the economic, cultural and trade 
sectors. The most important of these agreements is the decision 
to set up a free trade zone among the five Maghrebian countries. 
  These agreements were signed on the Tunisian side by Foreign 
Minister Habib Ben Yahya; for Algeria by Foreign Minister 
Mohamed Salah Dembri; for Morocco by Foreign Minister Abdellatif 
Filali; for Mauritania by Foreign Minister Mohamed Salem Ould 
Lekhel; for Libya by Mr. Jum'ha al-Fazzani, General People's 
Committee secretary for unity. [passage omitted: officials 
welcome signing of these agreements] 
  The Tunisian secretary of state for foreign affairs said it 
has been agreed to start the practical implementation of the 
free trade zone agreement immediately, and that a working group 
will begin preparing articles regarding this agreement as from 
the current month of April.

  [Excerpts] As I mentioned earlier, the sixth regular summit 
of the AMU [Arab Maghreb Union] Presidential Council ended in 
Tunis a few moments ago with the approval of a final communique 
by the leaders and representatives of the AMU member states. 
Before the end of the summit, Liamine Zeroual, the head of 
state, delivered a speech in which he dealt with several issues, 
including the Arab Maghreb Union's march and current 
international matters. Here is the full text of the speech of 
the head of state: 
  [Begin Zeroual recording] In the name of God, the merciful, 
and compassionate, Your Excellency the President, Your 
Excellencies, and Your Excellencies the Ministers, it is a cause 
for happiness and pleasure that my first visit, since I 
undertook the duties of head of state, is to fraternal Tunisia 
in order to participate in this AMU summit. [passage omitted] 
  Our conviction is that the Maghreban unity is, at the same 
time, a wish and a strategic objective for our people. 
  Mr. President, Your Excellencies, Ministers: We came to take 
part in this Maghreban summit at a time when Algeria is entering 
a new phase of its modern history, and because this phase cannot 
leave you indifferent, we consider it our duty to review with 
you the main points of this phase. Our country is experiencing 
an important transformation dictated by our people's aspirations 
and the enormous development it is experiencing, which is aimed 
mainly at establishing political pluralism and bolstering the 
foundations of national development so that it [Algeria] will be 
able to keep, in the best circumstances, abreast of the economic 
transformations in the world. [passage omitted] 
  It is obvious that the qualitative change lived by Algerian 
society cannot be achieved safely, [far removed] from 
conspiracies and secret schemes. It has become apparent to us 
that this leading process started to threaten many interests 
that made some foreign forces, which are known to us, bet on the 
opposite [as received] and on the exploitation of the 
opportunity to hit at the unity and stability of our country, 
hiding behind our true religion and our sacred values. 
  In this context, we believe that our Maghreban union has an 
important role in contributing effectively and seriously to the 
creation of a suitable and positive atmosphere for bolstering 
all the efforts made in order to achieve the comprehensive Arab 
interests. This would allow our Arab nation to obtain a 
position that suits its weight and its enormous resources in an 
international community full of risks and challenges. 
  Today as we monitor, with interest and concern, the events 
taking place on the Middle East arena, and in Palestine in 
particular, where the brave Palestinian people are still making 
sacrifices in order to establish their legitimate rights, we 
could only express our solidarity with it [the Palestinian 
people] in its just struggle and our support for its leadership, 
represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization which is 
fighting a decisive battle within the ongoing peace talks. 
  We also express our support for other Arab parties concerned 
with the Middle East peace process. [passage omitted] Also, we 
will not miss the opportunity to express our deep concern about 
the sufferings of the fraternal Libyan people as a result of the 
continuation of the blockade imposed on it, despite the 
readiness and flexibility expressed by the Libyan leadership in 
order to deal with the problems existing between it and some 
Western states. We have great hopes that the recent Libyan 
initiative would find a positive response that would enable this 
problem to be solved in a peaceful and final manner within the 
aegis of the sovereignty of peoples and the respect for their 
laws. 
  In our African continent, we are on the eve of the first 
legislative elections in South Africa and this constitutes a 
great triumph for a bitter struggle, to which we had the honor 
to contribute, in order to eliminate apartheid and racism. 
  If this great aim in South Africa is a cause for 
satisfaction 
and optimism, the painful events taking place in many states 
foretell political, economic, and social decline. Sources of 
tension and civil wars have become numerous in a large number of 
these states to a point where they began to threaten the fate 
and entities of entire peoples. This constitutes to us a source 
of anxiety and concern. 
  Some problems emerged near us on our borders that began to 
threaten the security and stability of the neighboring friendly 
states. 
  Algeria has worked hard and with all its resources toward 
helping the brother countries in containing their disagreements 
and solving them by suitable peaceful means. 
  In this context, our AMU should give the necessary attention 
to the analysis and recommendations of the Ministerial Council 
of the Sahel countries, held in Algeria at the end of last year. 
This is because the security and stability of our region are 
linked to the security and stability of these countries. 
[passage omitted] 
  The proclamation of our union in Marrakesh [in 1989] was 
followed by a dynamism that made the last five years distinct 
from the previous years of the modern history of our region. 
[passage omitted] 
  Our persistent eagerness to build the edifice of our Arab 
Maghreb requires us to continue the search for the best ways and 
means to speed up the achievement of our common interests. We 
note with great satisfaction the harmony in our opinions in this 
regard, as was obvious from the important results and 
recommendations reached by our foreign ministers that were 
approved yesterday. [passage omitted] 
  Algeria, which now assumes the honor of the AMU Presidency 
for the second time, fully appreciates this noble mission. 
Algeria is fully confident that it can rely on your 
participation and assistance, and also on the cooperation of 
your governments so that this year will be a year of new 
successes that will crown our unification march. 
  In conclusion, allow me to address my deep thanks and 
gratitude to the president, government, and people of fraternal 
Tunisia for the hospitality and warmth with which we, and the 
accompanying delegations, were met since we arrived in this dear 
country. 
  Peace and God's blessings be upon you. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Address by Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to </F>
Arab Magreb Union summit in Tunis on 3 April -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate; Your Excellencies, at a time when the proceedings 
of our council are about to be concluded, I am pleased to 
express to you once more our pride at hosting this Maghreb 
meeting in which we have changed viewpoints on our joint Maghreb 
action, on the most efficient means to give a boost to the march 
of our Arab Maghreb, and on the most prominent matters and 
international issues. [passage omitted] 
  There is no doubt that any progress on the path of building 
a 
unified Maghreb is liable to add strength and competence to the 
economies of our countries for integration and positive 
interaction with the international economic community and 
achieve more equilibrium in the exchange relations with the 
large economic groups and particularly those with which we have 
traditional relations in our immediate neighborhood. [passage 
omitted] 
  At the end of my speech, your excellencies, I am pleased to 
express on your behalf and in my name most sincere 
congratulations to His Excellency President Liamine Zeroual, the 
head of state of the fraternal People's Democratic Republic of 
Algeria, on his taking over the Presidency of the Arab Maghreb 
Union this year. We are convinced that his undertaking these 
supreme tasks will give our unionist march, thanks to the wisdom 
and conviction in the Maghreb unity that characterize him, more 
impetus and progress to the course of building our Arab Maghreb 
towards achieving the common aspirations of our peoples. 
  May God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you. 
[applause]

  [Excerpts] We now join our correspondent Larbi Gharbi live 
from Tunis to talk to us on the closing session of the AMU [Arab 
Maghreb Union] summit: 
  [Gharbi] The proceedings of the sixth ordinary session of 
the 
AMU Presidential Council ended today. This summit has adopted a 
number of articles, agreements, and protocols that had been 
submitted. 
  At the start of the closing session, the union's leaders and 
representatives signed the following chapters: 
  -- To amend Article 12 of the Union's Treaty providing for 
increasing the number of the Maghreban Shura Council from 20 to 
30 members for each member-state; 
  -- Recommendations to change the legal framework of the 
cooperation agreement; 
  -- To set up the Maghreban Agency for Youth Tourism, and the 
Maghreban Union of Sport. 
  The final communique of this summit stated that the council 
expressed its satisfaction over the positive outcome of the 
union's continuing work thanks to the periodic meetings of the 
appropriate bodies and ministerial committees and their 
councils. Their work gave a significant impetus to the 
Maghreban action during the sixth session. The council stressed 
the need for the continuation of this work to achieve the 
union's common goals, and respond to the ambitions of the 
Maghreban people for more practical achievements, and the 
provision of the appropriate circumstances for the Maghreban 
integration longed for by everyone, which remains the ultimate 
goal of the Maghreban people. 
  The council noted the practical implementation of five 
agreements recently -- a matter that provided the march of 
integration with significant legal cadres, capable help advances 
this march. The council also called for the endorsement of the 
remaining Maghreban agreements; preparation of their protocols 
and complimentary and executives chapters. 
  The council renewed its firm commitment to the working 
program of the union, especially Maghreban projects that could 
be implemented, taking into account their cost and direct impact 
on the daily life of the Maghreban citizen. 
  The Presidential Council expressed its satisfaction over 
choosing permanent headquarters for the Shura Council and the 
Judicial Body, the Maghreban Academy for Sciences, the Maghreban 
university. It stressed the need for supporting these 
institutions. 
  Taking all the necessary measures to set up the Maghreban 
Bank for Investment and External Trade and holding its 
constituent meeting so that the union would complete the setting 
up of its institutions, and contribute toward the realization of 
Maghreban ambitions for a better future based on unity and 
integration. 
  The council adopted a recommendation from ministers for 
foreign affairs on executive programs and the agenda of the 
meetings of the union's bodies during the seventh presidential 
session. The council stressed the need for the implementation 
of the agreements on their specified deadline. 
  Within the framework of the union's endeavors to underline 
its belonging to its Arab, Islamic, African, and international 
regions, the council noted with satisfaction the program of 
cooperation achieved between the AMU and the Arab League on the 
one hand, and regional Arab, Islamic, African, European groups, 
Arab and Islamic development funds, and UN organizations on the 
other. It also called for the continuation of efforts to define 
more opportunities of cooperation and integration with these 
groups, and bolster the path of development and solidarity on 
the basis of common development goals for the sake of the common 
interest. 
  The council also praised the continued Maghreban-European 
dialogue at the level of parliaments and institutions; it also 
hailed the meetings that took place between the Maghreban Shura 
Council and the European Parliament, and with the European 
Economic and Social Council. 
  Regarding relations between the Maghreban Union and the 
European Union, the council expressed its readiness to resume 
this dialogue on the basis of equal and harmonious interests, in 
a way that serves the meaning of the common development, the 
rights of the Maghreban community living in Europe, and the 
collective responsibility to protect peace and security on both 
sides of the Mediterranean. 
  Regarding the situation of the Maghreban community living 
abroad, the Presidential Council expressed its deep concern over 
the mounting wave of violence against this community because of 
the spread of extremism and violence directed against it. The 
Council called on the European states to take firm and necessary 
measures to eradicate this phenomenon. [passage omitted] 
  The council reviewed the political developments witnessed 
by the Maghreban, Arab, African, and Mediterranean region as 
well as international arenas, and it expressed its satisfaction 
over the use of dialogue and negotiations regarding most issues 
of common interest, which permitted the coordination of 
positions and had a positive impact on supporting just causes. 
  The council praised the efforts deployed during the past 
presidential term regarding the consolidation of the union's 
relations at regional and international levels; on the path of 
establishing international peace and security. The council 
expressed its efforts to help provide an international order 
that is based on international law and legality, the respect of 
human rights, the use of the spirit of cooperation and 
solidarity among all nations; condemnation of all forms of 
terrorism, violence, and extremism; the commitment to the 
respect, the sovereignty of states and non-interference in their 
internal affairs -- a fact that would firmly establish the 
pillars of peace and stability. 
  On the other hand, the Presidential Council expressed its 
deep concern over the suffering of the Libyan Arab people 
because of the ongoing embargo, its negative impact, and its 
ensuing damage on these people and on all Maghreban peoples, and 
on the Maghreban march of integration. The council expressed 
its resolve to carry on with its endeavors at union level, and 
also at a level of the Arab seven-man committee that is 
entrusted with finding an immediate settlement to the current 
crisis between the Libyan Jamahiriyah and some Western states. 
  When reviewing the peace process in the Middle East, the 
council expressed its great concern over the deteriorating 
situation in the Arab occupied territories; it expressed its 
condemnation against the continuing occupation, and the 
oppressive measures applied against the defenseless civilian 
Palestinians; and the repeated humiliated attacks against the 
Palestinians. The council voiced its backing for the just cause 
of the Palestinian people and its leadership. 
  The Presidential Council's final communique also dealt with 
a 
number of hot-spots in the world -- at their forefront the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis; the Yemeni and Somali crises, in 
addition to other conflicts. The council called for settling 
these crises through peaceful means. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat </F>
'Abd-al-Majid by Safa' Hijazi in Cairo, date not given; from the 
"Arabs' Home" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Hijazi] Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid, the Libyan-Western 
crisis was a topic at the Arab League's 101st session. News 
agencies have quoted British officials as saying that the 
International Court of Justice [ICJ] only looks into conflicts 
between nations, not into criminal cases. They were commenting 
on the Arab League's proposal that the two Libyan suspects 
appear before a Scottish court affiliated with the ICJ. What is 
your reaction? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] I have heard these statements. I believe the 
British Foreign Office officials know full well, as do I, the 
jurisdiction of the ICJ. The Arab League has never thought that 
this case is within the jurisdiction of the ICJ. This is the 
alphabet of the international law. They say this is not the 
business of the ICJ. I have never said it is. I am talking 
about a Scottish court applying Scotland's law but having its 
seat in the ICJ in The Hague; the ICJ will have nothing to do 
with the case. I hope this clarification will serve as a 
response to the statement of the official British Foreign Office 
spokesman, who, I am sure, knows very well what I am talking 
about. 
  The idea, as discussed by the seven-member committee and in 
the meeting of the Arab foreign ministers, is that we apply 
Scottish law, as the incident took place in Scotland. Judicial 
rules say that when an incident takes place in a country, the 
law of that country is applied. As concerns Libya, it is only 
natural for any country not to hand over its subjects for trial 
in foreign countries. The Libyan position in this regard is 
fully in keeping with the international law. The suspects can 
appear before a Scottish court in accordance with Scottish law, 
and, at the same time, the trial can take place in a neutral 
country, whether the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, or any 
other country. But the ICJ will have nothing to do with the 
case. 
  Why Scottish law? I would like to explain an important point 
here. In criminal cases, Scottish law is more flexible than 
British law. A Scottish court examining a case has three 
options concerning the defendant: guilty, not guilty, not 
proven [previous five words in English]. In Britain, courts 
apply what they call common law [previous two words in English], 
and they have only two choices against the defendant: guilty or 
not guilty. Scottish law, therefore, is more flexible. The 
painful Lockerbie incident took place in Scotland. So, we say 
let us apply Scottish law. Libya accepted that, and the Arab 
League Council ratified it. We are talking about a Scottish 
court, with Scottish judges, and perhaps other judges. The 
Scottish law will be applied where the suspect -- who is 
innocent until proven guilty -- is given a chance to be found 
not-proven. That is the whole thing. 
  [Hijazi] We were optimistic that an Arab court of justice 
would see the light, and that the Arab League Charter would be 
amended during the Arab League Council session. Why were these 
two projects postponed? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Concerning the Arab court of justice plan, I 
would like to give the credit to its rightful owners; namely, 
those who laid down the Arab League Charter in 1945. Article 19 
of the Charter mentions this court. It was conceived in 1945, 
but it never came to be. The idea was revived now so that the 
court can serve as a mechanism to resolve Arab conflicts by 
peaceful means. Going to the court is optional; no country can 
be forced to go to the court. The OAU established a mechanism to 
resolve African conflicts. As regards the amendment of the Arab 
League Charter, this has been under consideration for many 
years, but it did not happen either. There have lately been many 
changes that have pushed us to think of some important 
amendments, particularly adopting resolutions by a two-thirds 
majority rather than unanimity. Current Arab circumstances, and 
I understand this, prompted some countries to ask for a 
postponement of this issue. But both subjects, an Arab court 
and an amendment of the Charter, are still open; the door is not 
closed.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Apr (MENA)-- Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has emphasized that Arabs need peace 
among themselves and to bring about accord as soon as possible. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM published today, 'Abd-al-Majid 
said that it is not possible to reconcile Arabs and Israelis and 
establish Arab-Israeli peace so long as the Arab nation remains 
fragmented and riven by conflicts. He said this when referring 
to the fact that although three years have passed since the 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the repercussions of that crisis still 
reflect negatively on the Arabs' active march. He said he fears 
Arab disputes might grow worse in the coming period, 
particularly border disputes. 
  The Arab League secretary general called for speeding up the 
amending of the current Charter to permit the adoption of 
decisions by majority vote rather than by consensus. He also 
called for setting up an Arab court of justice. 
  Touching on the call for an Arab summit to mark the 50th 
anniversary of the establishment of the Arab League, 
'Abd-al-Majid hoped this call will be received favorably. 
However, he stressed the need for a favorable climate for this 
and emphasized that good preparation for such a summit would be 
inter-Arab candidness as a basis for reconciliation. 
  Commenting on the Lockerbie crisis involving Libya and some 
Western states, 'Abd-al-Majid pointed out that the Arab League 
Council has called for trying the Libyan suspects in the 
International Court of Justice with the participation of 
Scottish judges. He reiterated the League's support for Libya's 
right to exercise sovereignty on its territory and to refuse to 
hand over its citizens. 
  The Arab League secretary general added that he will 
continue 
his efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Lockerbie crisis.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, adviser to PLO Chairman </F>
Yasir 'Arafat, by Yoni Ben-Menahem on 1 April; place not given] 
  [Text] [Ben-Menahem] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, some reports have 
indicated that the Cairo agreement also includes a special 
clause relating to the repatriation of Palestinian deportees. 
Is this correct? 
  [Al-Tibi] The fact is that the issue of Palestinian 
deportees was raised during the recent meetings in Cairo. The 
Israeli side agreed in principle to the repatriation of more 
than 30 Palestinian deportees. This issue will be finalized at 
the beginning of next week. 
  [Ben-Menahem] When will the deportees return? 
  [Al-Tibi] This hinges on the talks that will begin next week 
in Cairo. The names of the returning brother deportees will be 
announced after the Cairo meetings next week. 
  [Ben-Menahem] Do the deportees belong only to Fatah? 
  [Al-Tibi] The list agreed on by the Israelis includes 
Palestinian deportees from various factions. 
  [Ben-Menahem] There are also reports indicating that Israel 
has agreed to release a large number of security prisoners. 
  [Al-Tibi] This is an extremely important issue for the 
Palestinian side. The Gaza-Jericho agreement cannot be signed 
or implemented without a scheduled release of the brother 
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. This position has been 
firmly raised with the Israeli side. The Israelis have agreed 
to it in principle. Talks are to be held later on about the 
timetable as well as on how and when the brother detainees will 
be released. I can say that in our contacts we recently focused 
particularly on the sick prisoners, because the number of sick 
prisoners in Israeli jails has increased. This issue should be 
given a very high priority. The Palestinian leadership is aware 
of this issue, has raised it repeatedly, and it has been 
accepted in principle. The details will be finalized in the 
upcoming round of talks. 
  [Ben-Menahem] There is criticism in the Palestinian street 
in Hebron as well as by the Palestinian opposition that the 
international presence in Hebron does not provide the necessary 
protection for the citizens. 
  [Al-Tibi] In fact, the international presence -- 160 
international observers -- does not provide absolute protection 
for the Palestinians in Hebron. Although this force does not 
provide protection, it gives an important political meaning to a 
multinational presence in Hebron in the occupied territories. 
This is the first thing. Second, the issue is not over yet. 
The more important issue is the evacuation of Jews from Hebron. 
Settlement presence in Hebron is a time bomb. We will wait a 
short while to see what the Israeli Government's next step will 
be on this matter. We have to wait a short while and see this 
step. 
  [Ben-Menahem] But what can you say to the man in the street 
about his protection? 
  [Al-Tibi] As I have said, undoubtedly international presence 
by itself does not provide the required protection for the 
Palestinians in Hebron. 
  [Ben-Menahem] Then why did the PLO agree to this? 
  [Al-Tibi] Because this has been a political demand by the 
PLO and the Arab side for scores of years. International 
presence in the occupied territories means that the occupation 
is about to end and that we are on our way to sovereignty. 
However, with regard to reducing friction and providing 
protection for the Palestinians, this will come by evacuating 
Jewish settlers from the heart of Hebron. We expect the Israeli 
Government to take a step shortly in this sphere. 
  [Ben-Menahem] Have you obtained any agreement on this issue? 
  [Al-Tibi] We will wait a short while and see what step the 
Israeli Government will take in this sphere.

<F P=106> ["Text" of telephone interview from Jericho with Sa'ib </F>
'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian delegation to the Cairo talks 
with Israel and chairman of the Palestinian election committee, 
by Radio Monte Carlo correspondent Salim Badawi, date not given; 
from the weekly "The Event" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Badawi] How do you view the Hebron agreement and 
the importance of its achievements on the Palestinian question? 
  ['Urayqat] In fact the problem lies with the settler hotbeds 
in the heart of Hebron. Therefore, and as you have noticed from 
the beginning, the Palestinian side has always insisted that the 
settlements be removed from the heart of the town. This did not 
happen. Therefore, and regrettably, the problem will not be 
solved, and protection for the Palestinian people cannot be 
realized unless the settlers are evacuated from Hebron. 
  Yet, we will not try to belittle the fact that a paragraph 
in 
the UN resolution concerning the existence of an international 
presence has been implemented. We do not want this 
international presence to be a means of beautification, a means 
of face-saving. What is required is real protection for the 
Palestinian people. 
  As we notice in the agreement, the powers of these 
[observer] 
forces are really very limited and will leave things in one way 
or another in the hands of the Israeli Army, which provides 
protection for the settlers and which has been unable to protect 
the Arabs. In fact, the Israeli Army has participated in 
massacres of Palestinians. I am afraid that the real aim of the 
UN Security Council Resolution No. 904 on protecting the 
Palestinian people; the real aim of our call for the past 27 
years to realize international presence, is not in fact 
practically intended to realize the aim of providing real 
protection for the Palestinian people. 
  [Badawi] Here we must point out that the agreement 
stipulated 
the presence of an international team only in the city of Hebron 
whereas Resolution 904 stipulates international presence in all 
parts of the occupied territories. Therefore, what you say is 
in agreement with what the PLO has said; that the security 
agreement is a first step toward implementing the resolution? 
Do you expect other steps to follow? 
  ['Urayqat] As I said, the international protection is in 
accordance with the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention, especially 
concerning civilians in times of war. The agreement did not 
even allude to the Fourth Geneva Convention. Israel continues 
to reject this convention. Therefore, naturally what is 
required is protection for the Palestinian people all over the 
Palestinian territories occupied in 1967. 
  The issue is not related to the presence and the size of 
this 
presence. It is related to the powers and substance of this 
presence. As we have seen, the agreement is a step but will not 
meet any requirements. For instance, let us take these settlers 
in Hebron, the Kakh group. These people loudly claim that they 
intend to force the Arab inhabitants off their land. They will 
not stop at anything. I will not be surprised if a number of 
these settlers attack these Norwegian, Italian, and Danish 
forces and kill three or four. Then public opinion in Italy, 
Denmark, and Norway will rise and demand that their forces 
leave. Giving the power to the Israeli Government is in itself 
stripping the international protection of any substantive power 
to take practical measures. 
  We have never sought to safe face at any time. We are 
seeking international protection for our people because there 
are real dangers threatening the lives of 2 million Palestinians. 
  [Badawi] So, Dr. 'Urayqat, based on the agreement, how can 
the international team's presence contribute to entrenching the 
aspired stability as long as the observers' mission is neither 
military nor one of security? 
  ['Urayqat] Frankly speaking, there will be no stability as 
long as the roots of the problem still exist. The cause of this 
problem is the existence of settlements. I believe that without 
evacuating settlers from the heart of Hebron, as a first step, 
and consequently putting the issue of settlements on the 
negotiations agenda, we will not achieve the aspired objective. 
Settlements are time bombs and mines that could explode at 
anytime. We should wait and see when another bomb will explode 
in a church, a mosque, a farm, or a university. What is really 
required is to provide true protection of the Palestinian people 
based on the Fourth Geneva Convention, and not procedural issues 
through which these forces' mission will be emptied of any 
meaning. 
  [Badawi] Dr. 'Urayqat, before we continue talking about the 
security agreement on Hebron, I would like you to listen with me 
to the position of the Palestinian opposition inside the 
occupied territories toward this agreement. This position was 
expressed earlier to "The Event" program by Riyad al-Maliki, 
official spokesman of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [PFLP] in the occupied territories: 
  [Al-Maliki] Certainly, the agreement has come to abrogate UN 
Security Council Resolution 904 on the Hebron massacre and the 
need for the presence of international forces to protect the 
Palestinian people in the occupied territories. The agreement 
on dispatching international observers greatly undermines 
Resolution 904. It seems that the PLO has contributed, together 
with Israel, to dealing a blow to that resolution, and decided 
not to comply with this resolution. The PLO is greatly 
responsible for this. We are talking about 160 international 
observers who cannot protect our people in Hebron. As Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres today said that 60 of them will 
be observers and 100 will help the municipality execute the 
development and economic projects. This means that there will 
be no international security presence. The issue of security in 
Hebron does not exist at all. We know full well that the 
agreement does not tackle the basic conditions the PLO has set, 
following the Hebron massacre, for going back to the negotiating 
table. Among these conditions are the evacuation of settlers 
from Hebron, disarming settlers, and using a Palestinian police 
force. What the PLO got is less than what is required. This 
conflicts completely with our masses' needs in Hebron and the 
rest of the occupied territories. We know that 'Arafat has 
tried to exploit the massacre to arrange his affairs in Hebron 
at the expense of the forces which reject the agreement. It is 
clear that he has formed a council for the Hebron Governorate 
instead of the emergency council on which all the functionaries 
in the city agreed. He has also formed an investigation 
committee in parallel with that formed by the awqaf committee in 
Hebron. He also nominated Mustafa 'Abd-al-Nabi al-Natshah to 
entrench his powers there, taking into consideration that the 
Palestinian masses in Hebron call for honest and free democratic 
elections to elect a municipal council after the last formation 
which took place in 1976. In other words, 18 years after this 
issue. We know that the negotiations on the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement began yesterday after the signing of an agreement. 
This is the pretext 'Arafat was looking for. It is an excuse 
which is even worse than the offense for which it was offered. 
'Arafat believes that he can convince our people in the 
occupied territories on this issue. 'Arafat's credibility has 
sunk to a new low. He has also lost his legitimacy. Neither 
'Arafat, nor his policy has any credibility in the occupied 
territories as a result of this latest agreement. 
  [Badawi] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, we have just listened to the 
opinion of Riyad al-Maliki, official PFLP spokesman in the 
occupied territories. In his opinion, the agreement undermines 
the UN resolution. So, you agree with him on this. According 
to Riyad al-Maliki, the agreement does not tackle the basic 
conditions the PLO has set following the Hebron massacre. 
However, Dr. 'Urayqat, despite this, you have returned to the 
negotiating table. 
  ['Urayqat] In the final analysis, I don't think we are 
talking about who is for or against the agreement. Objectively 
speaking, the agreement does not provide the required 
protection. But to single out 'Arafat, or any other Palestinian 
circle, for blame does not make sense. We should now direct all 
our energies to securing protection for the Palestinian people. 
As brother Riyad al-Maliki and others know, a committee was 
formed by President 'Arafat months ago to prepare elections for 
the Hebron municipal council and the local government. These 
elections will take place. We are on the verge of signing an 
accord with the European Union with the participation of another 
22 countries to join this program. A town council will be 
elected in accordance with the existing law, and that is the 
Jordanian law, in line with the Geneva Convention. 
  The laws that were in force before 1967, before the 
occupation, are supposed to apply. Municipal committees must be 
named for a limited period of time ahead of these elections. 
However, we must also bear in mind that, as a Palestinian side, 
we are trying to bring about the best possible conditions for 
the Palestinian people. As far as the other side is concerned, 
we are coming up against Israeli intransigence and 
procrastination. We are also dealing with a U.S. Administration 
totally biased toward Israel. If we are to apportion blame, it 
must be directed at the Israeli Government, which is responsible 
for the massacres and the absence of security. Fundamentally, 
negotiations must bring about an end to occupation. In every 
step we take, we must act objectively and dispassionately. We 
should not be distracted from the real problem, and that is 
occupation, and as brother Riyad has indicated, we should not be 
looking for scapegoats to explain away our problems. 
  [Badawi] But it remains the case that the PLO has 
backtracked on two fundamental demands. First, the evacuation 
of 400 settlers from the heart of Hebron. Second, the 
deployment of a Palestinian police force in the city. 
  ['Urayqat] The stationing of Palestinian forces while Israel 
still maintains a presence is absolutely rejected. This does 
not amount to a retreat. To bring in Palestinian police or 
security forces to take orders from Israeli forces is just 
illogical. It was right that this issue was not brought up to 
begin with. There is no retreat here. According to the Oslo 
agreement, the Palestinian security forces will be responsible 
for public order in any of the areas vacated by the Israeli 
forces. To introduce Palestinian forces when the Israeli 
military and occupation are still there is unacceptable. Our 
rejection does not represent a retreat. As for the first point, 
let me repeat with all objectivity, this accord insofar as 
international protection is concerned, falls short of our 
target. Only by the settlers pulling out from the heart of 
Hebron will our target have been reached. This is because they 
are at the root of the problem. A disease is cured not by 
addressing its symptoms but rather by tackling its roots. 
  [Badawi] What about the disarming of the settlers? 
Resolution 904 provided, among other things, for disarming the 
settlers. But the agreement made no reference to that. 
  ['Urayqat] That was a point that we raised from the start. 
But, in actual fact, every settler is a reservist in the Israeli 
Army. If he is not disarmed as a settler, will he be disarmed 
as a reservist in the Israeli military? When the criminal 
Goldstein committed his terrorist act at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, 
he was wearing a military uniform of a reserve captain in the 
Israeli military. Let us be honest. We are not just after 
disarming the settlers while they remain in their places. They 
are reserve soldiers as well. What is required is to evacuate 
the settlers and disband the settlements in the hearts of such 
cities as Hebron, Gaza, and Nabulus, and then place the 
settlement issue at the top of the agenda of any negotiations. 
Without the settlement issue being the first item on an agenda, 
any negotiations will be pointless. 
  [Badawi] Why do you think Yitzhaq Rabin decided not to 
evacuate the settlers even though eight out of 15 members of the 
Israeli Government supported such a move? 
  ['Urayqat] I do not think Rabin is a decisive person. He 
has failed to be bound by what he signed in Oslo or what Israeli 
negotiators signed in other places. Therefore, I consider Rabin 
to be wholly responsible for the way the peace process has 
evolved. I think that the peace process is headed for collapse. 
The U.S. Administration, which has conducted itself according 
to a damage control and crisis management mentality with a view 
to lifting Israel from crisis, and in the meantime brushing 
aside the true requirements for making peace, must share the 
responsibility. 
  [Badawi] According to the agreement, the negotiations 
should be intensified to make up for the wasted time. How will 
this be translated into actions? 
  ['Urayqat] The question is very realistic. The negotiations 
are not an objective. Emphasis should be on the contents of the 
negotiations. As I said, after the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre, it became clear, practical, and logical that no 
negotiations should take place unless the subject of settlements 
is on top of their agenda, because the peace process, as the 
letter of invitation to Madrid and the Oslo agreement stipulate, 
call for ending the occupation, which means the principle of 
land for peace in accordance with Resolution 242 and not 
reorganizing occupation as Rabin is trying to do. Occupation is 
a model that failed after 26.5 years. We have to be aware that 
what Rabin is trying to do now is just an attempt to reorganize 
the occupation, and not to end the occupation. 
  [Badawi] Dr. 'Urayqat, the United States expects substantial 
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho before the end of this 
April. Is this in line with the call for respecting the date of 
13 April? Is it possible to expect completing the Israeli 
withdrawal before 13 April as the Declaration of Principles 
agreement stipualtes? 
  ['Urayqat] As I said, the agreement is clear. Its points are 
coherent although all its articles lack mechanisms for 
implementation. Despite much talk about peace and withdrawal, 
Rabin has never been committed to any date on which there had 
been agreement. I do not think that he is going to be committed 
to the date of withdrawals as decided by the agreement. Even if 
we speak about withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, there are many 
issues that should simultaneously take place. 
  [Badawi] For example? 
  ['Urayqat] Withdrawal should be withdrawal and not 
redeployment. The agreement called for redeployment in the rest 
of the West Bank and not in Gaza and Jericho. If the 
settlements remain in these areas with Israeli presence, I 
believe this will not be a withdrawal. I also believe that the 
U.S. Administration, which failed to take a just stand due to 
its intransigence, full bias, and blind policy in favor of 
Israel, is using the peace process just for public relations 
purposes, nothing more. 
  [Badawi] Then the subject of withdrawal is still unresolved 
concerning some... 
  ['Urayqat interrupting] It is unresolved concerning many 
points, especially security issues. 
  [Badawi] Between 100 and 120 officers of the Palestine 
Liberation Army will arrive in Gaza Strip early next week as the 
first unit of the Palestinian police. When will their mission 
begin on the ground? 
  ['Urayqat] In fact, I do not know many details about this 
subject. All I can say is that the entry of any forces should 
be accompanied by a timetable and procedures that should be 
taken. Until now, I do not have any information on how these 
forces will enter or their tasks--whether these forces will be 
the vanguards which will arrange the situation or which will 
prepare for the entry of other forces. I cannot go into detail 
on this subject because I lack complete information. 
  [Badawi] Dr. 'Urayqat, a question to you as head of the 
Palestinian elections committee. According to the agreement 
that was signed, negotiations are to be held soon on the 
transfer of power from the Israelis to the Palestinian 
authority, that in turn, will take care of elections expected in 
the occupied territories next July. Can this subject be amended 
or delayed? 
  ['Urayqat] In fact, there was a Palestinian and presidential 
decision on 20 November concerning the formation of the 
elections and local government committee which I chair. The 
Israeli procrastination, and its failure to abide by the set 
timetable signed in Washington means that it is practically 
impossible to have the elections on 13 July. International 
groups worked with us last month. A timetable was approved on 
general elections, and it sets a 15 October 1993 date [as heard] 
because the electoral process does not take place immediately 
after a political agreement is signed by leaders. It is a 
tiring and long process. It requires training, preparations, a 
census. It also requires sending many people abroad for 
training. These people then come back to train others. 
Therefore, the realistic date for the general political 
elections was set for next 15 October. 
  [Badawi] My final question is on the resumption of bilateral 
negotiations in Washington. Will you head the Palestinian 
delegation to the U.S. capital? 
  ['Urayqat] I do not know yet if my tasks within the 
elections 
committee will allow me to go or not. 
  [Badawi] Will the Palestinian delegation be present in the 
bilateral negotiations hall? 
  ['Urayqat] The decision is left to the Palestinian 
leadership 
and not me. 
  [Badawi] Thank you Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hasan 'Asfur, deputy head of the Palestinian </F>
delegation to the Cairo talks with Israel, by Sha'ul Menashe in 
Cairo; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Menashe] The PLO is scheduled to take over in Gaza 
and Jericho shortly. Does it have a list of priorities ready 
for these territories? 
  ['Asfur] There is no doubt that it will be a historic event 
when the PLO and the national Palestinian authority take over in 
the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. It will mark the first 
step in building the Palestinian homeland. We think that 
security for the Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho and the 
rebuilding of the national economy that has suffered long under 
occupation will top the agenda. 
  [Menashe] What does the PLO leadership think relations will 
be like with the forces opposed to the peace process, notably 
the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas? 
  ['Asfur] It is not possible to say that there is opposition 
while the PLO exists. This is because the PLO is the national 
framework encompassing all the Palestinian political forces. 
However, there is opposition within the framework of the PLO to 
the Declaration of Principles. This opposition is open and 
always speaks out. The PLO, as the leadership of the 
Palestinian people, handles opposition within the framework of 
the Palestinian people's democratic principles consecrated by 
long years of national Palestinian struggle. We do not think 
that the democratic principles have been compromised. Our 
people's national forces will uphold these values. We think 
that political opposition within the framework of the PLO will 
respect the values and political traditions of the Palestinian 
people on which the PLO was built. 
  [Menashe] Do you have a contingency plan to counter 
violence, if, God forbid, it materialized? 
  ['Asfur] Let's not discuss such complications just yet. I 
am confident, however, that the political forces of opposition 
are sufficiently enlightened to express their opinion within the 
framework of the Palestinian political legitimacy. 
  [Menashe] One last question: According to Palestinian 
sources cited in Tunis yesterday, Mr. 'Arafat, after assuming 
power, will visit the territories, along with 120 Palestinian 
figures. Can you confirm that report? 
  ['Asfur] As for the logistics of President 'Arafat's return 
to the occupied Palestinian territory after the Israeli 
withdrawal, these have yet to be worked out. I think it is 
premature for me to discuss this matter. We are going to take 
over the national Palestinian authority. We have been working 
on that for some time. We think our people are looking forward 
to that moment. The PLO and its affiliated bodies are poised to 
take over.

<F P=106> [Interview with Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO's Political </F>
Department, by Safa' Hijazi in Cairo, date not given; from the 
"Arabs' Home" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Hijazi] Security Council Resolution 904 has 
condemned Israel for the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
After that, Israel bombed some buildings in Hebron, in defiance 
of the Security Council resolution and the world community. How 
will the confrontation with Israel end? 
  [Qaddumi] I do not believe that ending the confrontation 
with 
Israel is a simple matter. Israel continues to occupy 
Palestinian land. Ending the occupation will end the 
confrontation. Without ending the Israeli occupation, the 
confrontation with Israel will continue using all means. 
Unfortunately, this community has proved to be one that harbors 
rancor toward the Palestinians and the Arabs. [Former Israeli 
Foreign Minister] Abba Eban said this in a lecture he delivered 
at George Washington [as heard], when he said that it is now the 
duty of Israel to restore its democratic nature, which it 
claimed to have had. 
  [Hijazi] What is the mechanism for implementing the Security 
Council resolution? 
  [Qaddumi] The Security Council is responsible for 
implementing its own resolution. It urged the cosponsors of the 
peace conference to use all methods to provide protection for 
and ensure the safety of the Palestinian civilians inside the 
occupied territories. Among these measures is the dispatch of 
international troops, the disarming of settlers, and the 
adoption of other measures, such as removing the Israelis from 
Hebron. This is because their presence creates friction and 
constitutes a provocative act intended to perpetuate such 
incidents. 
  [Hijazi] Following the Hebron massacre, Israel announced its 
intention to assemble settlers in settlements close to each 
other and away from Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
Do you think Israel is serious about this? 
  [Qaddumi] Israel is now divided. We know very well that 
there are people who want to resolve the problem, but Yitzhaq 
Rabin in particular is a man who indeed does not want peace. He 
has postponed the withdrawal and he does not honor anything that 
he says, unfortunately. He says that these deadlines are not 
sacred. We have cautioned the United States and Israel about the 
consequences of these actions, but the Israeli Army put pressure 
on Rabin. This became clear during the talks held in Cairo, 
Davos, Oslo. Yitzhaq Rabin does not want to honor this 
agreement. He says something but does not honor it. He is 
acting in collusion with the Army people and with the settlers. 
I believe that continuing this policy will finish off the peace 
process. Had the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho not been 
delayed, these incidents would not have happened. Rabin has 
given the opposition more cards to strengthen its position, and 
here are the results, but they will fall on Rabin's head, God 
willing.

  [Text] Amman--The implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First 
accords will begin this week with the entry of up to 300 
Palestinian policemen from Jordan and Egypt into Jericho and 
Gaza, Palestinian officials in Amman and Tunis confirmed Friday 
[1 April]. 
  Ten Palestinian police officers are expected to head for the 
occupied territories on Tuesday to prepare logistics for the 
entry of the Palestinian policemen; 150 of whom would be 
stationed in Jericho and another 150 in Gaza. 
  Tunis based Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) 
officials 
said that "no dates were for certain." Amman based officials 
tipped Thursday April 7 to be the date of entry for 150 
policemen from Amman into Jericho and 150 policemen from Egypt 
into Gaza. 
  "I can confirm that the implementation of the Oslo accords 
will begin this week but the exact timetable is not yet known," 
Marwan Kanafani, the spokesman for Palestine President Yasir 
'Arafat told the JORDAN TIMES in a telephone interview Friday.

  [Text] Jerusalem, April 2 (AFP) -- A first group of around 
1,500 Palestinian policemen will be deployed on Thursday [7 
April] in Gaza and Jericho where self-rule is to be launched, 
the PLO said here Saturday. 
  The office of Faysal al-Husayni, the PLO mainstream group 
Fatah's chief in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said three 
battalions of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) would "start 
their mission immediately" on arrival. 
  One thousand former PLA fighters drafted in the police force 
will arrive in the Gaza Strip through the Rafah border post with 
Egypt. The other 500 will arrive in the West Bank town of 
Jericho over the Allenby bridge from Jordan. 
  The office added that a first group of Palestinian exiles 
would start to return on Tuesday, signaling "the start of the 
return of all the Palestinians expelled since 1967," when Israel 
seized the territories. 
  Israel and the PLO are close to agreeing on the deployment 
of 
up to 10,000 Palestinian policemen in Gaza and Jericho, chief 
PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th said Saturday. 
  "An accord on the number of policemen should be concluded 
during meetings of the PLO and Israeli security committee" which 
begin in Cairo on Sunday, Sha'th said in the Egyptian capital. 
  The talks would also focus on "preparations for the 
deployment" of the police and security arrangements for Jericho 
and Gaza. 
  "I don't think there is currently a problem on the number of 
policemen, which will be around 10,000," Sha'th said. 
  Under a security accord signed in Cairo on Thursday, Israel 
and the PLO agreed that 160 foreign observers would be deployed 
in the mosque massacre town of Hebron and a first contingent of 
Palestinian police would be sent this week.

  [Text] Palestinian Ambassador in Amman al-Tayyib 
'Abd-al-Rahim has voiced appreciation for the Jordanian 
Government's position under Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali in support of the PLO as well as the Government's 
policy aimed to protect the Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories and establish a just and comprehensive peace in the 
region. 
  In a statement to the Jordanian news agency commenting on 
the 
remarks made by Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for 
cabinet affairs and information minister, on the recent 
agreement reached in Cairo, 'Abd-al-Rahim said the Jordanian 
Government's call for Palestinian national unity and its support 
for the PLO, which is on the threshold of a new phase, emanate 
from a genuine pan-Arab position and show sound political 
foresight. 
  He added that the PLO is very eager to coordinate with 
Jordan 
now and in the future in view of the common interests and the 
one future for both fraternal peoples. He said: Jordan, under 
His Majesty King Husayn and his wise government, is maintaining 
a pan-Arab position. We believe this position should be 
championed because it supports the Palestinian people's struggle 
to establish an independent entity on their national soil, he 
added.

  [Text] At least 50 Palestinians expelled by Israel for 
intifada-related activities will be allowed to return home this 
week, a Palestinian spokesman said Friday [1 April]. Many of 
over 2,000 Palestinians expelled for political reasons since 
1967 were tipped to return in May 1993 when Israel allowed a 
token 30 to return, but refused to allow those who had been 
expelled for intifada-related activities go home. 
  "The names should be agreed upon by Sunday if all goes 
well," 
a PLO official in Amman told the JORDAN TIMES on Friday. 
Tunis-based spokesman Marwan Kanafani confirmed that "there are 
plans for the return of deportees this week," but refused to 
give further details. 
  Former student union president of Bir Zayt University Marwan 
Barghouti, Palestine Peoples Party executive committee member 
Taysir 'Aruri and 'Ayshah 'Awdah, a prominent political party 
activist, are expected to be among the first batch of expellees 
allowed to return. Some PLO officials had tipped that a return 
may be possible as early Monday or Tuesday.

  [Text] Mustafa al-Natshah began discharging his duties as 
mayor of Hebron this afternoon, after the Civil Administration 
informed him that he had been appointed to the job at 'Arafat's 
request and that his fellow city councilmen would be returning 
to the positions from which they were fired eight years ago. 
  Civil Administration officials gave al-Natshah and his 
colleagues a report about the municipality's financial situation 
and other documents. Al-Natshah then went to the municipality 
offices and began discharging his duties. He told our 
correspondent Moti Amir that he had asked the Civil 
Administration to remove the curfew and the closure on Hebron in 
order to ease the lot of the population, and that the Israeli 
officials had promised him they would look into the matter. 
  The outgoing mayor, who had been appointed by the Civil 
Administration and discharged his job until this morning, was 
asked to vacate his office and hand it over to al-Natshah.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview of Hebron Mayor Mustafa al-Natshah, in </F>
Hebron, by radio correspondent Muhammad al-Aswad, in Cairo, date 
not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Aswad] Mr. al-Natshah, we welcome you to the 
Voice of the Arabs. 
  [Al-Natshah] Thank you. 
  [Al-Aswad] After the PLO and Israel reached agreement on 
security arrangements in the Hebron area, President Yasir 
'Arafat appointed you mayor of Hebron. In your opinion, what is 
the significance of this step? Can it be seen as the beginning 
of actual Palestinian authority and decisionmaking in the 
occupied territories? 
  [Al-Natshah] We welcome this decision and regard it as a 
step 
toward legality and democracy. My return and the return of the 
elected Municipal Council to our duties at Hebron Municipality 
strengthen legality and democracy. The Municipal Council is 
actually the elected body that was dismissed in 1983. Now, 
thanks to PLO efforts, it can again carry out its tasks. 
  [Al-Aswad] Your appointment followed the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre in Hebron. What is the mayor's role in providing 
protection for the Palestinians? Is this part of the mayor's 
authority? 
  [Al-Natshah] Conditions in the city since the massacre are 
unprecedented. The city center is closed off because of the 
security measures imposed by the Israeli authorities to protect 
the settlers. We have 750 shops that are closed. People living 
in the downtown area need permits to reach their homes. The 
schools in that area are closed because of the security cordon. 
Generally the city is paralyzed. Therefore the Municipal 
Council's first task is to reopen the city and restore normal 
life. We hope to do this within a few days, God willing. 
Second, the citizens have suffered a lot from assaults by the 
settlers and the Israeli Army. We hope that the international 
forces will protect the citizens and end the assaults. 
  [Al-Aswad] Mr. al-Natshah, as you know, there is an 
agreement 
to deploy Palestinian police and international observers in 
Hebron. How do the Palestinians in Hebron view this step? What 
is the general atmosphere like in view of these recent 
developments? 
  [Al-Natshah] The agreement provides for the deployment of 
international observers, meaning international protection, but 
not Palestinian police. We welcome the international 
protection; it has been a Palestinian demand for years. This is 
the first time we are being given international protection. We 
regard it as part of the implementation of the relevant UN 
resolutions -- in this case, Security Council Resolution 904. 
We hope this is a prelude to the implementation of the 
remaining UN resolutions. We stress that an ounce of prevention 
is worth more than a pound of cure. Evacuating 30 settler 
families from inside Hebron would be the most important move to 
protect the city's Arab citizens. 
  [Al-Aswad] The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations will resume 
in Cairo today to discuss ways of implementing the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles on transitional 
Palestinian autonomy, beginning with Gaza and Jericho. 
According to some reports, the Israeli withdrawal from these 
two areas will begin on 12 April. What is your assessment of 
this step, judging from your perspective as a resident in the 
occupied territories? 
  [Al-Natshah] We want peace in the region. We want a 
withdrawal from the rest of the West Bank. We want it to be a 
genuine, total withdrawal. We want the settlements issue to be 
put at the top the agenda so that the settlers will also be 
evacuated. 
  [Al-Aswad] Mr. al-Natshah, how do the Palestinians in the 
territories regard the Egyptian role in making peace and 
restoring the Palestinian people's legitimate rights? 
  [Al-Natshah] We greatly appreciate the stance of Egypt and 
Mubarak and their backing for the Palestinian cause. We hope 
this backing will continue until the Palestinian people can 
exercise self-determination and establish a state on their 
national soil. 
  [Al-Aswad] Mr. Mayor, we thank you very much. You are always 
welcome on the Voice of the Arabs. 
  [Al-Natshah] Thank you.

  [Text] Gaza -- The Fatah Hawks, Fatah's military 
apparatus, have called on the Palestinian leadership to stop the 
negotiations in protest of Israeli practices in the occupied 
territories. They urged the leadership not to resume the talks 
until acts of pursuit and liquidation against all wanted men 
from all factions are halted. 
  The Fatah Hawks called on the movement's organizational 
authority in the Gaza Strip to immediately freeze all channels 
of contact with the Israeli administration. 
  The statement said that this has no connection with the 
peace 
process, that what is taking place at the negotiating table is 
being done according to the laws of negotiations and what is 
taking place on the ground in the occupied territories is 
governed by the laws of the occupied territories, and that there 
was no contradiction between the two. 
  The statement was issued in the wake of the killing of six 
Fatah activists last Monday by special Israeli units.

  [Text] An IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldier was lightly 
wounded a short while ago when shots were fired from a passing 
car at IDF headquarters in Gaza city. 
  A senior Fatah official was kidnapped by Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] activists in Gaza city over the weekend. 
Hamas claims that the man was collaborating with the Israeli 
authorities. Palestinian sources told our correspondent Moti 
Amir that the real reason behind the kidnapping was a dispute 
over land in Rafah. In the course of the kidnapping a violent 
fight broke out; one Hamas activist was killed and 30 were 
injured. The sources stressed that because of the continuing 
clashes with Hamas, Fatah was making efforts to capture 
influential positions and seize control of land and 
installations before Hamas does. 
  Our army affairs correspondent has learned that two wanted 
Hamas activists turned themselves in to the IDF over the past 
few weeks. IDF commanders in the Gaza Strip are continuing to 
hold contacts and meetings with Hamas members in an effort to 
persuade them to halt terrorist activity. Military sources said 
that the Hamas activists have a great deal of motivation to 
carry out terrorist attacks and they are expected to increase 
their efforts over the next few days.

  [Text] The fiftieth session of the GCC Ministerial Council 
began at the general-secretariat headquarters this afternoon. 
The meetings are chaired by His Royal Highness [HRH] Prince 
Sa'ud al-Faysal, minister for foreign affairs and chairman of 
the current session. At the beginning of the meeting, HRH 
minister for foreign affairs made the following speech: 
  [Begin recording] [Faysal] In the name of God, the 
Compassionate and the Merciful, prayers and peace upon the 
prophets and messengers. 
  Your Highnesses and excellencies, secretary general, 
respected brothers, God's peace and blessings upon you. It 
gives me great pleasure to express to you the warmest of 
welcomes to your country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; which is 
today pleased to welcome you in the GCC Ministerial Council 
fiftieth session. With God's assistance, I pronounce this 
session open, and would like to praise the elements of 
cooperation and solidarity existing among our countries, as 
exemplified in the most effective resolutions adopted by our 
leaders during the sessions of the GCC summits. [passage omitted] 
  The field of bolstering military cooperation between the GCC 
states represented the most important issues discussed during 
the 14th summit. The higher council decided to set up a higher 
committee to implement resolutions pertaining to collective 
defense and military cooperation whose chairmanship will be 
assumed on a alternate basis by the GCC defense ministers. The 
committee will include the chiefs of staff and the chairman of 
the military committee of the GCC general-secretariat. The time 
has now come for the UAE to assume the chairmanship term. 
  Brothers, our meeting takes place at a time when our Gulf 
region is still witnessing difficult and critical situations. 
The Iraqi regime continues its policy of violating and 
selecting all UN Security Council resolutions regarding its 
aggression against Kuwait; and its breaking of the UN Security 
Council 773 and 833 Resolutions which stipulated a demarcation 
of land and sea borders between Iraq and Kuwait, its 
continuation to keep as hostages Kuwaiti prisoners and other 
nationals thus violating international laws and appropriate UNSC 
resolutions. 
  Also, Iran has again started to reiterate its claims of 
control and sovereignty over Greater and Lesser Tunb Islands and 
the island of Abu Musa, which belong to the UAE. However, we 
remain hopeful that Iran will respond to the voice of reason 
regarding the issue of the three islands and reach a final 
solution with the UAE through peaceful means; and in the process 
prove its sincere intention concerning its claims of 
good-neighborliness, development of friendly relations, and its 
desire for bilateral cooperation with GCC states. [end recording] 
  HRH the minister for foreign affairs added that the GCC 
fiftieth session is taking place at time which is at best not 
reassuring, because the Iraqi regime continues to pose a threat 
to the security and stability of our countries. There are also 
threats aimed at destroying our cooperation council which 
represented the solid rock that quashed Iraq's ambitions and 
thwarted its ugly aggression. 
  His highness went on to say that Iraq's latest efforts are 
represented in its large-scale campaign which it is conducting 
in the Arab arena, in an attempt to help lift the embargo 
imposed against it by the the UN Security Council resolution; 
and its attempt to re-establish relations without respecting and 
fully implementing these resolutions and recommendations. 
  His highness added that it is absolutely crucial for our 
current meeting to issue resolutions that stress and underline 
our determined and strong stance regarding this matter, to close 
the door in the face of any such attempts. 
  His highness said that our hearts continue to bleed 
profusely 
because of the ugly crime committed by the criminal Zionist 
settlers against defenceless and innocent worshippers in the 
sacred Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron; and its ensuing consequences 
and complications on the the peace process. 
  Stemming from this, his highness went on to say, we call on 
the international community to shoulder its responsibility 
regarding the provision of protection for the Palestinians and 
the sacred places from the savagery of the Jewish settlers in 
the occupied land. 
  Regarding Somalia, his highness said that we are still 
hopeful that the Somali leaders would be at the level of 
responsibility to implement what they had agreed upon in 
Nairobi, Kenya, to save their country from the ravages of a 
civil war and the tragedy of a deadly famine. 
  His highness added that we also have not lost hope that the 
Afghan leaders would use the voice of reason and raise above 
their differences to spare Afghanistan from a total destruction. 
  We also hope that the international community would continue 
to implement its promises to stop the criminal Serbs from 
implementing their criminal ethnic plans against Muslim 
Bosnians. His highness expressed his hope that the Bosnian 
Muslims and Croats would be able to reap the fruits of their 
confederation plan to live together in security, stability, and 
peace; hoping that this plan would convince the Serbs to join 
the peace efforts and accept the solutions which are on the 
negotiating table. 
  In conclusion, his highness asked God to help them achieve 
success. Following this speech, the opening session was 
adjourned, and a meeting behind closed door was held.

<F P=106> [By Sulayman Nimr] </F>
  [Text] Riyadh, April 2 (AFP) -- Saudi Arabia on Saturday 
urged its Gulf allies to toe the line against Baghdad and 
prevent it sowing division in the region, criticizing Qatar and 
Oman for their rapprochement with Iraq. 
  Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal said Iraq was 
"working to divide the GCC" and was "still a threat to security 
and stability in the region." 
  He urged the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to "restate the 
member nations' joint position on Iraq, to block any attempts" 
to drive a wedge between Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE), Oman, Bahrain and Qatar. 
  Observers said Prince al-Faysal, in his opening address to a 
two-day GCC foreign ministers meeting in Riyadh, was implicitly 
criticizing Baghdad's links with Oman and Qatar. 
  Oman was the only GCC country to maintain relations with 
Baghdad after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990. 
  Qatar has also drawn closer to Iraq in the past few months, 
arousing deep concern in Kuwait, which was liberated by a US-led 
multinational coalition in February 1991. 
  In Cairo last weekend, the Omani and Qatari foreign 
ministers 
held talks with their Iraqi counterpart Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf 
on the sidelines of an Arab League ministerial meeting, 
officials said. 
  Al-Sahhaf described Iraq's relations with Oman, Qatar and 
Bahrain as "good" at the meeting, they added. 
  The GCC session was also expected to cover the Middle East 
peace talks, notably the multilateral track in which the Gulf is 
involved. Qatar and Oman are to host Israeli delegations for 
meetings of multilateral working groups. 
  Likewise on the agenda was Iran's territorial dispute with 
the UAE, the official Emirates news agency WAM said. 
  In Cairo, the 22-member Arab League reaffirmed support for 
the UAE in its dispute with Iran over three strategic islands in 
the southern Gulf. 
  The UAE has warned it could resort to international 
arbitration to resolve the dispute with Iran over the islands of 
Abu Musa, Tunb al-Kubra, and Tunb al-Sughra. Iran insists the 
problem must be tackled through direct dialogue. 
  The UAE and Iran had strong political and economic links 
until the dormant dispute flared anew in 1992 following 
accusations that Tehran had annexed the UAE part of Abu Musa and 
expelled some of its residents. 
  The GCC defence, political and economic alliance was created 
in May 1981 during the Iran-Iraq war.

  [Excerpts] Riyadh, 2 Apr--Their highnesses and 
excellencies, the foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation 
Council, ended their second ministerial council working session 
today under the chairmanship of the Saudi foreign minister, His 
Highness Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal. [passage omitted] 
  His Highness said, "The nature of this meeting is to 
implement decisions reached during the summit meeting of their 
majesties and highnesses, the leaders of the Council's states. 
Accordingly, the decisions reached at the summit were reviewed 
during the meeting, be they security, economic, or political 
decisions." 
  His Highness said the meeting at the outset concentrated on 
the summit's decisions and ways of implementing them, and thus 
on political evaluations, political topics, GCC states' ties 
with their neighbors, and on the international effort that would 
be launched. 
  Asked about incongruity in the GCC's political stands, His 
Highness said, "That is what we hear in the press, but at the 
summit-level meetings or at those at the foreign ministers 
level, we have not noticed any incongruity between GCC states." 
  Responding to a question on Iraq's attempts to split the 
Arab 
front, Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal said, "I did not mention splits 
in my address. I said that Iraq was trying to come through with 
justifications, particularly humanitarian ones." 
  He added that Iraq wanted to reached its aims of not 
complying with the Security Council resolutions, particularly in 
its dispute with Kuwait on the demarcation of borders with 
Kuwait and on ending Iraq's claims on Kuwait. That effort had 
to be confronted and shown for what it was. 
  His Highness said, "We sympathize with the Iraqi people and 
their plight, but what is standing as an obstacle to improvement 
of the conditions of the Iraqi people is the Iraqi Government 
and not international resolutions." 
  He said that the international resolutions would solve the 
Iraqi people's tragedy. But Iraq was trying--through them--to 
get through to the Arab countries emotionally by telling them 
that the continuing sanctions were harming the Iraqi people. 
However, Iraq wanted to exploit this in order not to comply 
with the resolutions, which were of utmost importance for the 
Arab sphere, to Kuwaiti-Iraqi ties. If the basic condition was 
carried out, the whole picture toward Iraq would change, and 
Iraq would gain international support.

  [Text] Riyadh, 3 Apr -- The Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] 
Ministerial Council ended its 50th session this afternoon at the 
Council's General Secretariat in Riyadh. It was chaired by His 
Highness Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, the Saudi foreign minister. 
  The Ministerial Council issued a press statement that was 
read out by GCC Secretary General Shaykh Fahim Bin-Sultan 
al-Qasimi. The following is the text of the press statement: 
  The Ministerial Council held its ordinary 50th session at 
the 
headquarters of the General Secretariat in Riyadh on 2nd and 3rd 
April, 1994. His Royal Highness Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, the 
foreign minister of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and head of the 
Ministerial Council's current session, chaired the meeting which 
was attended by all its members -- His Excellency Rashid 
Bin-Abdallah al-Na'imi, the foreign minister of the United Arab 
Emirates [UAE]; His Excellency Shaykh Khaled Bin-'Abdallah Al 
Khalifah, Bahrain's housing minister; His Excellency Shaykh 
Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur Al Thani, the foreign minister of the 
State of Qatar; and His Excellency Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir Al 
Sabah, first deputy prime minister and the foreign minister of 
the State of Kuwait. 
  The Ministerial Council studied the new regional 
developments 
and developments in the Gulf in the light of the Iraqi regime's 
lack of compliance with all international commitments imposed by 
Security Council resolutions related to its aggression, 
continuing procrastination, its pick-and-choose treatment of 
those resolutions, pursuit of a hostile policy toward the State 
of Kuwait, its continuing formation of a threat to GCC security 
and stability, and continuous attempts to split the cohesiveness 
of international legitimacy. 
  The council also studied the Iraqi nonimplementation of the 
UN Security Council resolutions related to Kuwait, its attempts 
to evade its international commitments concerning the Kuwaiti 
issue, its persistent repetition of expansionist claims on 
Kuwait, its claims against Kuwaiti sovereignty, its threats to 
Kuwaiti independence, and its cease-fire violations. In this 
context, the council recalled the GCC Supreme Council's 
emphasis, in its 14th session, that respecting the sovereignty 
and independence of Kuwait, as it came in the second paragraph 
of Resolution 687, and the international borders of Kuwait, as 
ratified by UN Security Council resolution No. 833, represent 
the essence of the commitments specified in Resolution No. 687, 
and that their nonimplementation represents a violation of the 
essence of that resolution. 
  As it welcomed the resolution adopted recently by the UN 
Security Council to continue the international sanctions against 
Iraq because of its nonimplementation of the UN Security Council 
resolutions related to its aggression against Kuwait, the GCC 
Council expresses its satisfaction with the understanding shown 
by the UN Security Council members of the aggressive policy of 
the Iraqi regime and their insistence on the necessity for Iraq 
to respect the sovereignty of Kuwait and sanctity of its 
territories. The council appeals to the international community 
to continue its pressures on the Iraqi regime in order to make 
it stop its aggressive behavior and to submit completely to all 
the UN Security Council resolutions related to Resolution No. 
687, particularly those related to recognizing the international 
borders between the two countries, releasing the Kuwaiti and 
other prisoners of war and detainees, the payment of 
compensations, and a commitment not to commit or support any 
terrorist or sabotage action. 
  The council emphasizes its complete commitment to Iraqi 
unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and expresses its 
sympathy with the fraternal Iraqi people against the human 
suffering for which the Iraqi regime is fully responsible 
because of its refusal to implement the UN Security Council 
Resolutions 706 and 712 that deal with the Iraqi needs of food 
and medicine. 
  The council also reviewed the new developments in the 
relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and reiterated its 
firm stance of supporting the UAE and its sovereignty on the 
three islands of Abu Musa, the Greater Tunb, and the Lesser 
Tunb. The council also reiterates its absolute support to all 
the peaceful measures and means adopted by the UAE to restore 
its sovereignty over its islands. 
  It expresses hope that Iran would comply with the call of 
His 
Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin Sultan al Nuhayyan, president of the 
UAE, with regard to the holding of a direct dialogue between the 
UAE and the Islamic Republic of Iran concerning the latter's 
occupation of the three islands belonging to the UAE. 
  The Council condemns the noticeable escalation by Iranian 
media and its media campaign against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
during March 1994 and its allegations, according to which the 
Kingdom is obstructing the Iranian pilgrims. 
  It expresses full support for the measures that the Kingdom 
of Saudi Arabia has adopted to enable pilgrims to perform the 
duty of pilgrimage in comfort and tranquility, in accordance 
with the teachings of the pure Islamic tradition and the 
resolution of the foreign ministers of the Islamic states in 
their meeting in Amman, Jordan, during March 1988. 
  The Ministerial Council followed the developments in the 
Middle East peace process and in the occupied territories and 
expresses in this respect its great anxiety about the 
deterioration of the security situation and living conditions in 
the occupied Arab territories. It holds Israel fully 
responsible for the increase in the number of people killed 
among the sons of the fraternal Palestinian people, in a way 
that is in contradiction with the spirit of the peace process 
and represents a violation of the fourth Geneva Agreement. 
  In this respect also, the Council condemns Israel for the 
massacre carried out by the Israeli settlers against worshipers 
in Ibrahim's Mosque [Hebron]. It calls on the UN Security 
Council and the co-sponsors of the peace process, the United 
States and Russia, to speed up the implementation of the 
articles of UN Security Council's Resolution 904. This 
resolution concerns the condemnation of the massacre and the 
adoption of measures to guarantee the safety and protection of 
Palestinian civilians in all parts of the occupied Palestinian 
territories, which includes the provision of an international 
presence, the disarming of Israeli settlers, and the 
implementation of the fourth Geneva Agreement to the occupied 
Arab territories. 
  It stresses in this respect that the Israeli settlements in 
the occupied territories are illegal according to international 
law and that their continued presence constitutes an obstacle to 
peace that is liable to rock confidence and will not provide a 
suitable atmosphere for the achievement of a comprehensive 
solution to the Palestinian issue and the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
  While welcoming the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement concerning an international presence in al-Khalil, and 
the resumption of the peace negotiations, the council reaffirms 
its full support for the peace process on all tracks aimed at 
reaching a just, permanent, and comprehensive solution to the 
Palestinian question and the Arab-Israeli conflict on the basis 
of UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the land-for 
peace principle, a full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied 
Arab lands, primary among which is holy Jerusalem, and securing 
the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people, 
including its right to self-determination. 
  The council reiterates its request to the international 
community to put pressure on Israel to carry out UN Security 
Council Resolution 425 to secure an immediate and unconditional 
withdrawal from southern Lebanon. 
  The Ministerial Council brought back to mind the 
recommendations of the 8th conference of the Damascus 
Declaration member states foreign ministers held in Damascus on 
9-10 January 1994, and welcomed the graceful invitation made by 
the State of Kuwait to host the coming meeting of the Damascus 
declaration foreign ministers' conference, in implementation of 
Article 1 of the recommendations of the 8th Damascus Declaration 
member states foreign ministers' conference on the importance of 
continuing coordination and consultation in the political domain 
between the 8 countries regarding regional and international 
issues. 
  The council is following with interest the development of 
the 
political and security situation in fraternal Somalia, and it 
expresses its aspiration to see a reconciliation between the 
Somali factions. It welcomes the signing of the Nairobi 
agreement and hopes that this step will contribute to the 
restoration of security and stability to Somalia so that it will 
be able to resume the reconstruction and development march. The 
Ministerial Council also followed the latest developments of the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and it lauds the international 
efforts made to force the Serbs to withdraw their artillery from 
Sarajevo, and it urges the international community to take 
similar measures in the other security zones. 
  The council welcomes the signing of an agreement on the 
establishment of a Muslim-Croatian Federation in Bosnia and 
considers it a step toward restoring peace and security to the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and affirming its sovereignty, 
independence, and territorial unity. 
  It calls on the Security Council to enable the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to exercise the right of legitimate 
self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations 
Charter, to lift the arms embargo imposed on it, and to tighten 
sanctions and redouble pressure on Serbia and Montenegro. 
  The council expresses its deep concern at the continuing 
deterioration of the situation in the sisterly Republic of 
Afghanistan, and calls on all the Afghan factions to put a halt 
to the fighting, to give priority to the national interest, and 
to respond to the United Nations efforts for that purpose so 
that security and stability can be restored throughout that 
sisterly country. 
  The council also discussed the minutes of a number of 
ministerial committees and approved them. It reaffirmed to the 
technical committees the necessity of completing implementation 
of the rules of the unified economic agreement, in line with 
decisions taken by the Higher Council. 
  The Ministerial Council also reviewed the situation in the 
international oil market, expressing the concern of its states 
over its instability. In that context, the Ministerial Council 
urged oil-producing states within and outside OPEC to respond to 
the appeal made by their majesties during the 14th session, and 
to cooperate in stabilizing the market. 
  The council expressed its satisfaction at the positive 
results of the latest round of the Gulf-American dialogue 
chaired by the Saudi minister of commerce representing the GCC, 
and the U.S. trade secretary, representing the United States. 
It the council hoped that the steps agreed upon would provide 
more support for cooperation between them. 
  The Ministerial Council is awaiting its fifth meeting with 
the European Union foreign ministers in Riyadh on 8 May 1994 and 
the issuing of resolutions that will serve cooperation between 
the two groups in various fields. 
  Issued in the city of Riyadh 
  On 3 April 1994. 
  His Royal Highness Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, the foreign 
affairs minister, then declared the meetings closed.

  [Excerpts] His Excellency Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, Presidential Council chairman in the sisterly Republic of 
Yemen, arrived in the country at noon today on a two-day visit 
to the sultanate. 
  His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Said led those who received 
President Salih upon his arrival in Salalah Civil Airport. 
[passage omitted] 
  His excellency the Yemeni president made a statement to the 
press upon arrival in which he said: We are very happy to make 
this visit to the Sultanate of Oman to meet my dear brother His 
Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id to discuss everything that 
concern our bilateral fraternal relations, which are eternal and 
warm relations based on amity, brotherly cooperation, mutual 
respect, and good-neighborliness. These relations are 
witnessing continued progress in a manner that serves and 
benefits our mutual interests. 
  There are many subjects that will be discussed within the 
framework of continuous bilateral consultations, whether 
concerning developments in our country and the efforts made to 
contain the political crisis and safeguard Yemeni unity, or 
regarding regional and Arab issues and international 
developments that concern our two sisterly states or our Arab 
nation, foremost of which are the efforts to restore Arab 
solidarity. 
  He added: We greatly appreciate the sincere fraternal 
efforts our brothers in Oman are making and the efforts of the 
Omani military team within the joint military committee. These 
efforts realized several good results, such as stopping the 
military deterioration in our country. We also appreciate the 
eagerness shown by the Omani brothers to contain the crisis and 
protect the march of unity and stability in our country based on 
the awareness that stability is something that concern all 
brothers and neighbors of Yemen, and that Yemeni unity is an 
important and vital factor for security, stability, and peace in 
the region. This unity is an element that consolidates our Arab 
nation, which is in need now, more than at any other time, of 
unity, solidarity, and a basis of joint interests for the Arabs. 
  Oman has led the sisterly states that have supported and 
blessed the Yemeni unity. Probably, one of the positive 
elements realized by the unity was that it has made a solution 
to the border problem between Yemen and Oman possible. A border 
agreement was signed, and this agreement laid down a solid basis 
for developing fraternal bilateral relations to realize the 
joint aspirations of the two sisterly and neighborly peoples. 
The agreement demonstrated a model that can be followed in 
solving border problems and establishing strong relations 
between brothers and neighbors. 
  We are confident that our Yemeni people, thanks to the 
support of their brothers, will be able, God willing, to 
overcome all the challenges posed by the crisis, in order to 
continue their march and work toward achieving their objectives 
of progress and development under the banner of unity, which is 
an umbrella of security and peace in our Yemeni homeland and the 
region.

  [Text] Al-Fujayrah, United Arab Emirates, April 2 (AFP) -- 
The Gulf emirate of al-Fujayrah called Saturday [2 April] for 
international help to fight an oil slick which has hit 30 
kilometers (18 miles) of coastline, killing fish and turtles. 
  Al-Fujayrah officials said Saturday that 15,900 tonnes of 
oil 
-- more than twice the initial estimates -- spilled from the 
supertanker Seki after it collided with the tanker Baynunah in 
the Gulf of Oman on Wednesday. 
  International "help is now required to prevent a major 
disaster to the area's beaches and marine life," a al-Fujayrah 
government spokesman said. 
  "Large quantities of oil have come ashore on the beaches 
between Lu'lu'iyah and Ras Qadnah, accompanied by dead fish, 
turtles and other forms of marine life," he said, adding that 
scientists had been sent to investigate the damage. 
  Salvage teams from several oil and shipping companies were 
so 
far working with the UAE coast guard. 
  Al-Fujayrah port officials said Hugh Parker, a pollution 
expert from the London-based International Tanker Owners' 
Pollution Federation, had arrived in the emirate and started 
helicopter flights over the spillage. 
  The anti-pollution firm Fairdeal deployed three skimmers to 
tackle the slick, and operators said later they had collected 
more than 1,500 tonnes (10,950 barrels) of oil. 
  Each of the skimmers can collect 20 tonnes (146 barrels) of 
crude every 30 minutes and salvage experts said more than three 
days would be needed to clear up the slick. 
  "We are focusing on the beach area to prevent pollution, but 
the problem is that the wind is variable and the crude is 
spreading," Fairdeal general manager Captain Michael Sarros said. 
  "So far there is no threat to the desalination plants or the 
nearby Omani coast. But we cannot speculate on the consequences 
right now," he said, adding that the spillage covered around 
eight square kilometres (3.2 square miles). 
  Captain Musa Murad of al-Fujayrah port told AFP that the 
slick covered the stretch of coast north of Khawr Fakkan. 
  "It's a catastrophe. Thirty kilometres of coastline have 
been hit by the oil slick," he said. 
  The al-Fujayrah spokesman said that according to Seki 
officials around 15,900 tonnes of oil was spilled into the sea, 
but the spillage from the ruptured tank had stopped Saturday. 
  First reports said around 7,000 tonnes had leaked. 
  "Our initial hopes of containing the spill were dashed when 
weather conditions altered during the early hours of Friday 
morning moving the slick directly to our shores," he said. 
  The 56,300-tonne Baynunah, built in South Korea, joined the 
Abu Dhabi National Tanker Company (ADNATCO) in 1983. 
  ADNATCO said the tanker was about to head for Kuwait to pick 
a shipment of crude for Japan when it collided with the 
282,000-tonne Panama-registered Seki some 10 nautical miles (17 
kilometres) off al-Fujairah. 
  Port officials in al-Fujayrah daily handle up to 50 tankers 
arriving to load up with fuel by ship-to-ship transfers. 
  The last accident at the port occurred in 1986 when a tanker 
hit a mine during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. 
  In another accident, a fire-gutted supertanker barred from 
port for two weeks will be allowed to dock in the Gulf after it 
has unloaded its oil in the next few days, an official with the 
firm towing the tanker said Friday. 
  The Greek-owned Stolidi, carrying the charred bodies of 18 
Filipinos killed in a March 20 fire, will transfer its 225,000 
tonnes of oil to another ship, an International Marine Services 
official said. 
  "The Stolidi is now in Gulf waters and unloading operations 
may start in two or three days about five to 10 nautical miles 
off the coast of Dubai or Sharjah" in the United Arab Emirates, 
he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah by </F>
Safa' Hijazi in Cairo, date not given; from the "Arabs' Home" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Hijazi] Mr. Yemeni Foreign Minister and Chairman of 
the 101st session of the Arab Foreign Ministers' Council: 
Following the withdrawal of the international forces from 
Somalia, which coincided with the signing of the national 
reconciliation accord among the Somali leaders in Nairobi, what 
is the role of the Arab forces? Was this topic placed on the 
agenda? 
  [Basindwah] At this session the council was informed that 
some Arab states that have contributed forces to the 
peacekeeping troops in Somalia intend to withdraw their forces. 
Naturally, if the Somalis agree among themselves and engage in 
a quiet and objective dialogue, they will not need forces to 
safeguard their security and stability. It seems that the 
existing situation in Somalia will not continue. Somalia will 
inevitably emerge from its current crisis, God willing. 
  [Hijazi] Yemen is a member of the Arab League. Yemen's 
security is part of Arab national security. How can Yemen 
overcome its domestic crisis and what are the latest 
developments in this crisis? 
  [Basindwah] Thank you for your question. On this occasion I 
would like to make it clear that the situation in Yemen is now 
better than before. The cabinet convened in Aden on Wednesday. 
It reconvened in Aden on Sunday. The cabinet is expected to 
meet in Ta'izz tomorrow. The Presidential Council will meet in 
Sanaa tomorrow. We hope all constitutional establishments will 
resume their work in Sanaa within one month. Naturally, if what 
has happened in Yemen had happened in another Arab country or 
another developing country, civil war would have broken out. 
Despite the passage of seven months since the crisis began, we 
Yemenis have not been dragged into a civil war or ferocious 
infighting. This proves that despite our differences and 
disputes, we have been able to steady our nerves and apply 
political pressure on each other without reaching the level of a 
civil war.

  [Text] Sanaa, 3 Apr (INA)--Yemeni gunmen today kidnapped 
two members of a Chinese team that is working on the 
Jihanah-Ma'rib road project, 49 km northeast of the Yemeni 
capital, Sanaa. 
  To free the two Chinese experts, the kidnappers are 
demanding 
that work on the road, which extends over 76 km along the 
Saudi-Yemeni border, be stopped. The project was started in 
1991. 
  On 12 February, Yemeni gunmen kidnapped three Chinese 
experts 
working on the same project. The experts were released on 21 
February. 
  Informed Yemeni sources have indicated that the Saudi regime 
is behind the kidnapping, and that this regime seeks to obstruct 
the project, which, once completed, would allow the Yemeni 
authorities to control smuggling, curb acts of economic 
sabotage, and check the Saudi regime's ambition to expand into 
Yemeni territory.

written message from the U.S. President Bill Clinton to 
President al-Bashir, dealing with issues of mutual concern. 
  The U.S. official has held talks with General al-Bashir at 
the Republican Palace following her arrival. These talks 
tackled the progress of bilateral relations and issues of mutual 
concern. In a press statement following her meeting with 
President al-Bashir, she said that Sudan and the United States 
should work together for pushing forward the peace process, 
human rights, and what she described as Sudan's support to 
terrorism. She said that her dialogue with General al-Bashir 
was very serious and frank, saying that the continuation of the 
IGADD [Intergovernmental Agency on Drought and Development] 
peace initiative is necessary for achieving a lasting peace in 
Sudan. 
  The foreign minister, Dr. Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih, 
described the visit of Mrs. Albright to Sudan as a real 
beginning of the serious dialogue between Sudan and the United 
States. He affirmed that the dialogue has been one of the basic 
methods which had been adopted by the revolution adding that the 
visit of Mrs. Albright came in the framework of the serious 
dialogue between the two countries. The minister Dr. Husayn 
Sulayman Abu-Salih stressed that the Sudan gives top priority to 
the issues of realizing a just and permanent peace. He warned 
her that any (?work) for supporting the outlaws with arms and 
attempts to abort the peace talks. Will negatively affect the 
peace process in Sudan. Dr. Abu-Salih has welcomed contribution 
of the American Government to the peace endeavors in Sudan, 
providing that this contribution was serious and honest. 
  He described as lacking evidence, the accusation made by the 
American Government on Sudan's violation of human rights and 
support to terrorism. He affirmed Sudan's serious desire to 
continue dialogue with the U.S. 
  Following her meeting with President al-Bashir which lasted

  [Text] Khartoum, 1 April (SUNA) -- Sudan Government 
Thursday [31 March] issued a statement on the occasion of the 
visit to Sudan by Mrs. Madeleine Albright, permanent 
representative of the USA at the United Nations. Here is the 
statement full text: 
<H5>  Sudan's Stance Towards Various Issues </H5>
  The government of the Revolution of National Salvation is 
fully aware of the fact that most of the problems that face the 
Sudan at the internal level and at the level of its relations 
with the other countries, including the United States, are 
tightly connected with the problem of the war in southern Sudan, 
therefore, the government has always been looking for the 
attainment of a peaceful solution to the problem in itself as 
well as for the treatment of the complications that the war has 
caused. 
  This has been clearly reflected in the efforts exerted by 
the 
government in order to restore peace and to provide relief for 
those affected by the war. On the other hand, the problem of 
the war in the south is connected to varying degree with other 
problems encountered by the Sudan such as human rights, the 
quest for an equitable division of wealth and power and the 
creation of social and economic development. 
  Since its advent the Revolution of National Salvation has 
put 
the quest for a peaceful solution to the conflict in southern 
Sudan at the top of its priorities. It took the initiative by 
sending a message to Colonel John Garang calling him for the 
table of negotiations, but he refused to receive that message, 
which was received instead by the former Ethiopian President 
Mengistu. 
  The government also took the initiative by declaring a 
unilateral cease-fire which induced the rebels to capture Kurmuk 
Town, but the government had nevertheless committed itself to 
the transportation of relief products to the needy in the 
operation areas, including those controlled by the rebels. 
  Two months after the advent of the revolution, in August 
1989, a government delegation met with rebels delegation in 
Addis Ababa and the two sides agreed upon the necessity of the 
continuation of the negotiations in order to attain peace. 
  During September and October 1989 a national conference on 
peace issues convened in Khartoum and tackled problems such as; 
  (1) Power sharing 
  (2) Distribution of wealth 
  (3) Religion and politics 
  (4) Unity in diversity 
  During the period from 28th November to 5th December, the 
second round of negotiations between the government and the 
rebels was held in Nairobi, sponsored by former U.S. President 
Mr. Jimmy Carter. In effect, the government's agenda during this 
round and during all the subsequent talks were the resolutions 
of the national conference on peace issues. 
  In 1991 the rebel movement was split into two factions. 
However, the government had not given up hope in contacting 
both of them. During May, June, 1992, and in response to the 
mediation of the Nigerian Government, another first round of 
negotiation was held in Abuja between the government and the two 
factions, and the agenda had been agreed upon for the future 
talks, but John Garang declared in Kampala during a press 
conference that he would not recognize the Abuja resolutions 
because the head of his delegation surpassed the powers 
delegated to him. 
  The second round convened in Abuja in May 1993, and this 
time 
the concerned sides had agreed upon most of the raised points 
but the coming of John Garang at the end of the talks impeded 
the success of the round by causing a disagreement over the 
issue of residual powers. However, another round of talks 
between the government and the United Faction was held in 
Nairobi and resumed in Fashoda (Sudan) in August 1993. 
  During the summit meeting of IGADD (6th to 8th September 
1993), the presidents of Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda, 
expressed their desire to mediate in order to put an end to the 
war in southern Sudan. A meeting between the two sides of the 
conflict was thus held in Nairobi, 17th March 1994, but the 
talks have been postponed, to be resumed in the same venue on 
16th May 1994. 
  This long war which is imposed upon us in the southern part 
of the country has created a humanitarian problem. This problem 
is manifest in the great numbers of displaced persons who sought 
refuge in safer areas inside or outside of the Sudan. The 
government has therefore committed itself to displaced people 
until peace is restored and they go back to their areas. 
  In fact, the government has done its utmost in order to 
provide relief for its needy citizens and at the same time it 
welcomed the support of the international community in this 
respect. The government has signed a number of agreements, some 
of which represent a breakthrough in the field of providing 
relief to those affected by war, even for those who live in the 
areas held by the rebels. The agreements include: 
  (1) The general agreement with the International Commission 
of the Red Cross signed in 1984. 
  (2) Operation Lifeline Sudan signed with the U.N. in 1989. 
  (3) Operation Lifeline signed with U.N. in 1991. 
  (4) The detailed agreement with the ICRC in 1992. 
  (5) Operation Lifeline signed with the U.N. in 1993. 
  (6) The Nairobi Agreement with the rebel factions on the 
facilitation of the flow of relief March 1994. 
  In spite of the fact that the rebel movement has exploited 
these agreements to serve other ends, and in spite of the fact 
that certain organizations have acted in such manners that 
ignore the Sudanese sovereignty, the government showed a lot of 
patience and cooperation in consideration to the miserable 
situation of its citizens. 
  However, the major handicap that faces us at the present is 
the lack of the means of transportation that secure the arrival 
of the relief materials to the needy in due time. 
  And hence, the government is ready for full cooperation with 
the international community represented by the U.N. and donor 
countries for the import of the necessary equipment for the 
transportation of relief products as well as for the cooperation 
in the field of the supervision of relief operations. 
<H5>  Democracy and Political System </H5>
  The concept of democracy in Sudan entails the exercise of 
people of their legitimate rights in governing themselves and 
choosing the political system that conforms with their social 
background, cultural heritage and economic prosperity. 
  (?As to) the question of democracy (?on) the agenda of 
(?Sudan)- American relations, it is imperative to agree on the 
content rather than the form which is governed by the changing 
factors of specific community. 
  Sudan has adopted a political system that conforms with its 
orientation, having in mind repeated failures of applying 
Western democracy since independence, in 1956. Although the 
political system is still in its preliminary stages, the active 
participation of people in popular committees' elections gave it 
the needed drive. Necessary steps are being taken to complete 
the system by introducing free and direct elections at all 
levels, from popular committee to the National Assembly. The 
political system tends also to elect the president and vice 
president directly. The federal system will help also to widen 
the base for political participation. 
<H5>  Economic Reform </H5>
  Sudan's Government has exerted great efforts regarding 
privatization of the Sudanese economy to an extent that exceeded 
what is usually recommended by the IMF. It applied a tough 
policy of self-reliance and market economy which resulted in 
economic hardship. 
  Unfortunately, the IMF has ignored its adviser's technical 
view, which praised Sudan for achieving an annual economic 
growth of 11.5 percent. The IMF response to American 
(?pressure) has denied Sudan any financial assistance. The IMF 
has lost its technical credibility and began to treat economic 
issues which are influenced by double standards. 
<H5>  Terrorism </H5>
  Sudan has renewed its condemnation of international 
terrorism. It also requested those accusing Sudan of terrorism 
to furnish evidence to that effect. 
  It is needless to say that Sudan does not harbour terrorists 
or training camps and the government has repeatedly declared 
that Sudan is an open country for those who want to see for 
themselves. 
  Sudan also is not threatening the stability of other 
countries. To the contrary, Sudan is threatened by some 
neighbouring countries that provide rebels and opposition groups 
with logistics, camps and access to media. Efforts were made to 
refute these allegations about terrorism. Dialogue was started 
with the American ambassador in Khartoum and a letter was sent 
by the foreign minister to his American counterpart, suggesting 
exchange of information about the subject. Instead of a 
positive response, the United States include Sudan in its list 
of countries sponsoring international terrorism. 
  A statement by ex-President Jimmy Carter and a testimony by 
an official of the State Department, at hearing in the congress 
on last March 1994, prove beyond doubt that the American 
decision was baseless. 
<H5>  Human Rights </H5>
  Respect of human rights in Sudan is a matter of principle 
and 
the government is very eager to preserve these rights in 
accordance with its principles. Sudan welcomed the special 
rapporteur, Mr. Gaspar Biro, and accorded him all assistance 
possible to carry out his job. However, the report of the 
special rapporteur was full of misinformation and disrespect to 
the beliefs of the Sudanese people. Nevertheless, the U.S. 
Government delegation to the 50th session of the human rights 
committee decided to support the biased report and spearhead the 
attack on Sudan. 
  We believe that the noble cause of human rights is being 
exploited politically and double standards were applied to 
ridicule the beliefs of Muslims, as did the report by the 
special rapporteur. This is a serious matter. 
  Such irresponsible behavior defeats the real objectives 
behind the international instruments on human rights that call 
for the respect of different cultures and religious beliefs. 
<H5>  Grievances of the Sudanese Government Against the USA Policy </H5>
  The Sudanese Government has its own grievances against the 
policy of the U.S.A. vis-a-vis the Sudan. It is a policy 
characterized by permanent hostility, escalation of contention 
and arbitrary. 
  (1) The American administration based itself in its hostile 
position against the government of the Sudan on Congress 
Resolution No. 513, despite the selectivity and double standards 
practised by the American administration in applying this 
resolution. The administration did not take into account the 
legacy inherited by the NSR government such as an imposed war, 
refugees, displaced persons, drought and instability that 
hindered development, endangered unity and security of the 
country and posed a threat to neighbours. 
  (2) The United States adopted a number of resolutions 
against 
the Sudan without any objective reasons, an act that deepened 
misunderstanding between the two governments, e.g.; 
  (3) Congress Resolution No. H.R. 2295 (June 1993), H.R. 
2332, 
(June 1993-1994), (March 1993) and 131 (November, 1993). 
[paragraph as received] 
  (4) Hostile positions of the American Administration by 
preparing draft resolutions against the Sudan and lobbying for 
their adoption. Such positions were flagrant at U.N. General 
Assembly during 47th, 48th sessions, especially on human rights 
issue. 
  (5) Hostile American positions against the Sudan within the 
Human Rights Commission sessions 48,49,50. The question of 
appointing the independent expert, the appointment of the 
special rapporteur, transition of Sudan from the confidential 
hearing to the public hearing phase and, finally, the adoption 
of the report of the rapporteur which contained insults against 
Islam, the creed of the nation. 
  (6) Adaption by the American administration of the rebels' 
version at different international forums and different 
occasions, as proved. 
  - The Washington Colloquium, organized under the auspices of 
Mr. Johnson, chairman of the Special Committee on Africa. 
  - Hostility to the Islamic orientation of the Sudan and its 
cultural option. 
  - The hostile position of the American Administration 
against 
Sudan at the IMF, an act that led to forcing the Sudan to quit 
the IMF. 
  - The American Administration consistently stood against the 
Sudan in other international financial institutions. 
  - Inscription of the Sudan on the list of countries that 
sponsor international terrorism, without the least proof by the 
American administration. 
  - Anti-Sudanese declarations by USA officials in every 
international forum, subjectively and without any proof whatever. 
  - Despite the American humanitarian assistance, a gesture 
appreciated in itself, yet this assistance is limited and does 
not cover liberated zones and falls short of involving 
infrastructure for relief operat ons. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  Despite the grievances mentioned above and the damage 
suffered by the Sudan due to the American hostile policy, we do 
believe that there is no objective reason for this hostility. 
We are confident that the wrong information leaked to the 
American Administration, which caused the misunderstanding that 
prevail over the relations between the two countries, can be 
corrected through serious, frank, and active dialogue. The 
Government of Sudan stands ready for such dialogue and that it 
shall contribute, it is the conviction that dialogue is the 
confidence between the two countries and strengthen the ties of 
friendship between the two governments.

  [Excerpt] Khartoum, 2 April (SUNA) -- Foreign Minister 
Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih made a press statement today regarding 
the statement by Madeleine Albright, a U.S. envoy, on Sudan. 
The U.S. statement was issued in Addis Ababa on 1 April. 
  The foreign minister said that Sudan, on the basis of its 
overall national strategy, had striven to establish some kind of 
normal and warm relations with the United States through 
dialogue, a system adopted by the revolution. Dr. Abu-Salih 
said that the Sudanese Government had sent numerous letters 
concerning dialogue between Sudan and the United States, and had 
addressed correspondence to U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. There were talks in November 1992, and in August 
1993. He said that the U.S. Government had, without any 
preliminaries, placed Sudan on the list of states which fostered 
terrorism -- without any evidence. 
  His excellency made it clear that Sudan had earlier, four 
months before the declaration, received notification that it had 
been placed on the list of states under supervision, but not as 
a state fostering terrorism. 
  The foreign minister stated that Sudan had welcomed 
Madeleine 
Albright's visit to confirm the revolution's intention to attain 
good relations. He pointed out that the president of the 
Republic, Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, held a 70-minute 
meeting with Mrs. Albright, the U.S. envoy. It was a 
responsible and frank dialogue and a start to serious dialogue. 
Dr. Abu-Salih added: We do not know the reasons for Albright's 
statement in Addis Ababa, or why it was not made in Khartoum. 
  His excellency denied what was said in Albright's statement 
in Addis Ababa. He said that what she said about the issue of 
peace in Sudan confirmed what was known by the government and 
people of Sudan: That the war had been imposed on them, as well 
as the fact that Sudan was striving in all seriousness with the 
goal of reaching peace to stop everything that fanned the war. 
He said that Sudan wanted peace. Moreover, Sudan had 
communicated to the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and 
Development [IGADD] states its adherence to their initiative, 
and to making it a successful initiative. 
  Dr. Abu-Salih said that the IGADD states should know that 
there were obstructions to the peace process from certain 
quarters, which back the rebels with weapons, ammunition, and 
money, and which want the fragmentation of Sudan and the 
promotion of war. 
  With regard to Albright's comment that Sudan was obstructing 
relief operations, Dr. Abu-Salih said that her comment in this 
regard was strange, pointing out that Sudan had concluded many 
agreements with many quarters, including the Operation Lifeline, 
which was considered a model for providing relief supplies. He 
said that Sudan was satisfied with the commendation it received 
from the third committee three months ago. That committee had 
praised Sudan's role in conveying food to the famine victims and 
the needy. 
  As to Albright's remarks about terrorism, Dr. Abu-Salih 
said: 
We ask the U.S. Administration to provide evidence for these 
accusations and to remove the name of Sudan from the list of 
countries fostering terrorism. [passage omitted] 
  As to what Albright said about Sudan's violation of human 
rights, Abu-Salih said: We in Sudan believe in human rights on 
the basis of the tenets of our religion, and we do not need 
directions from anyone on good conduct. The U.S. Administration 
should present its authority on this. He said that Sudan had 
records of human rights violations in a number of states, 
including Israel and the United States, and was ready to provide 
evidence concerning this.

  [Excerpts] Khartoum 3 April (SUNA) -- The chairman of the 
External Relations Committee of the Transitional National 
Assembly (TNA) Professor Muhammad Shakir al-Saraj has attributed 
the strain in Sudanese-U.S. relations to Sudan's Islamic 
orientation under the National Salvation Revolution. 
  In an interview with the Iranian news agency's correspondent 
in Khartoum on Sunday [3 April], Professor Saraj said the media, 
parliamentary, and political circles were responsible for 
America's hostility towards Sudan. He said the United States 
had never been concerned with the restoration of peace in 
southern Sudan, and that it used the rebels in the south as a 
pretext to put pressure on the Sudanese Government. [passage 
omitted] 
  He emphasized that Sudan will not accept threats and will 
never give up its Islamic path, whatever the pressures. 
  He said the United States cannot internationalize the 
conflict in southern Sudan, as that would constitute a violation 
of Sudanese sovereignty. Sudan is ready to defend its 
independence and territorial integrity.

  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: The National Salvation 
Revolution [NSR] believes in dialogue as a procedure and method 
for finding solutions to numerous and thorny issues. That was 
evident from the broad consultative conferences which were held 
throughout the country, which produced truly Sudanese views on 
solutions to numerous complicated internal issues. On this same 
basis, the NSR is pursuing the same procedure and using the same 
method for dialogue to remove misunderstandings which might 
occur between Sudan and any other state. This is what Sudan has 
always called and striven for, that is: To place relations 
between ourselves and the United States in their correct 
framework on the basis of mutual respect and noninterference in 
the country's internal affairs. Colleague Najm al-Din Muhammad 
Ahmad wrote the following commentary on the visit to this 
country last Thursday [31 March] by Madeleine Albright, the U.S. 
delegate to the United Nations, which he will now read: 
  [Najm al-Din] The two-hour visit to the country by 
Ambassador Madeleine Albright, the U.S. delegate to the United 
Nations, during which she met Lieutenant General 'Umar 
al-Bashir, president of the Republic, was regarded in diplomatic 
and official circles as a true beginning to serious dialogue 
between our country and the United States. The United States 
has displayed flagrant hostility towards Sudan since the 
beginning of the National Salvation Revolution in 1989, without 
Sudan committing a sin or without issuing anything which in the 
least harmed these relations. For this reason, we know, just as 
the whole world does, that the United States itself, and not 
others, is the one and only country responsible for the state of 
estrangement and indeed hostility that has been a characteristic 
tarnishing relations between the two countries. Evidence, facts 
and the practices of that great power have demonstrated this, 
for that country is the one that started all this through an 
economic boycott, beginning in 1989, within the framework of a 
policy of pressure -- which it always pursues towards states and 
peoples that strive to liberate their will and build themselves 
through self-reliance. 
  The superpower was not content with that. It led a feverish 
campaign in international forum when the weapon of economic 
pressure did not succeed. America has been drawing on this 
weapon against Sudan to make it bow or retreat, even an inch, 
from all the programs and plans which have crystallized through 
the numerous dialogue conferences in which the people of Sudan 
joined forces. The result was a comprehensive national 
strategic plan which laid down a cure for all the diseases and 
maladies of the state. Sudan began to implement this plan with 
every confidence and ability, in order to achieve the superstate 
of Sudan, which it sought with the help of God. 
  We say: When the weapon of economic pressure did not 
(?finish off) a free, noble people like the people of Sudan, the 
United States resorted to campaigns in which it looked for 
excuses to condemn Sudan and justify its direct interference in 
Sudan's internal affairs, exploiting that so-called 
international organization, the United Nations, in which it is 
represented by the visitor who came to our country as a dear and 
honored guest. She was granted the honor of meeting the 
president of the Republic, who cleared up matters and removed 
every obscurity or ambiguity in her mind about issues and 
ambiguities. We hope she will be able to convey all the facts 
she heard, the documents she acquainted herself with and the 
information she was given on all her queries so as to thaw the 
thick ice in relations between Sudan and her country -- or, that 
at least, we can count on this as being the beginning of the 
road leading to that. When the weapon of economic pressure 
failed, the United States, which since the collapse of the 
communist bloc has always brandished a stick at whoever disobeys 
or tries to disobey it, led a campaign in which it desperately 
attempted to distort Sudan's image in world opinion. This 
endeavor reached its climax when the great power threw the name 
of Sudan falsely onto the American list for terrorism, without 
citing any convincing proof to justify the allegation, labeling 
as terrorists people who profess a religion that discards 
violence and calls on people to embrace it amicably. 
  The United States has always been accustomed to attaching 
the label of terrorism to any honorable, proud, and free state, 
forgeting or pretending to forget that it, that is to say, the 
United States, in reality -- according to evidence -- sponsors 
terrorism and protects those who practice terrorism. It also 
assists those who terrify peaceful people and it spreads terror 
and a lack of tranquility among peoples. No two people disagree 
on U.S. support for organized international terrorism. 
Moreover, its support for terrorism in Sudan is represented by 
the direct moral support which it gives, just as it gave 
generously to the rebel movement through the Washington 
Symposium, and its sponsorship of the rebellion's assertion, 
which favors the separation of southern Sudan from the rest of 
the country. 
  U.S. support for terrorism in Sudan does not limit itself to 
moral support --it exceeds it to give material support and 
indirectly supply the rebel movement with the necessary 
equipment through its allies and pawns. In all this hostility 
and incitement, the United States proceeds from the bases of its 
flagrant hostility to Islam. While it does so, it takes into 
account the fact that Islam is the logical alternative to 
remolding the world on the basis of justice and equality, and 
absence of injustice after having suffered injustice and 
oppression under U.S. attempts at hegemony and domination. 
  This is naturally not the conviction of the Sudanese people 
alone but the conviction of all Muslim peoples in all parts of 
the world. We say this, but, at the same time, we welcome the 
dialogue between Sudan and the United States, which we regard as 
having seriously begun with all openness and frankness. 
However, we only hope that the United States will continue its 
dialogue with us, while bearing in mind the principles of the 
Sudanese people, which we cannot abandon or deviate from. These 
principles are represented by Sudan's cultural orientations. 
The United States ought to know that Sudan's cultural option 
was not manufactured by the Sudanese Government, inasmuch as it 
is the option of the widespread national will. 
  This matter is not confined to the Sudanese people but it 
goes beyond them, becoming one of the concerns of the Islamic 
nation as a whole. Consequently, the United States is faced 
with an historic test and should show some readiness, however 
limited, to respect other peoples' options. It is now entering 
a dialogue with Sudan to rehabilitate its relations and 
eliminate misunderstandings, caused by the United States in the 
first instance -- that is, if it so wishes. God grant us 
success.

  [Text] The Sudanese opposition National Democratic Grouping 
has affirmed that the Sudanese regime's policy is to divide 
Sudan and to foment disturbances among its sects and people. 
  In a memorandum sent to Arab foreign ministers, the grouping 
pointed out that the regime has obstructed the Constitution, 
dissolved parties and democratic unions, and launched ethnic war 
against the south. This, the grouping added, threatens Sudan's 
unity and invites foreign intervention. The grouping accused 
the regime of harboring and training terrorists in Sudan. It 
said that the regime is providing terrorists with weapons, 
funds, and passports. The grouping maintained that it has 
information that terrorists come from various Arab countries to 
training camps in Sudan. 
  In its memorandum, the Sudanese grouping urged the Arab 
League to intercede and stop the ongoing war in southern Sudan. 
The grouping also called for removing the regime and setting up 
a democratic authority that would respect the right of 
citizenship; separate religion from politics; recognize 
religious, cultural, and ethnic diversity; and recognize the 
independence of the judiciary and the legal profession. The 
grouping voiced its support for the unity of Sudan and its 
people.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] A spokesman of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] in an interview described Israel's refusal to sign 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] as the main obstacle 
in the way of the Middle Eastern countries' cooperation with 
that international organization. [passage omitted] 
  The refusal of countries such as Israel to join the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty makes countries who have signed the 
treaty feel that their cooperation with the IAEA does not 
provide them with any kind of guarantee against a threat posed 
by the countries who are not members of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. That matter has not only created an 
obstacle in the way of cooperation between the Middle Eastern 
countries and the IAEA, it has also created a problem for 
international cooperation in that context. 
  The acknowledgement of the IAEA spokesman of that problem 
reveals the fact that if this situation is not addressed, it is 
not possible to pin much hope on the nuclear nonproliferation 
programs. 
  At a time when America, together with other countries and in 
cooperation with the IAEA, is exerting pressure on countries 
such as North Korea in order to facilitate the inspection of its 
installations suspected of prohibited nuclear activity, the 
signatories of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty expect that 
pressure is also exerted on countries such as Israel who have 
not signed the treaty and have not accepted any nonproliferation 
commitment, so that they accept nuclear nonproliferation. 
  Undoubtedly, that measure would serve international peace 
and 
stability as it can reduce obstacles in the way of nuclear 
nonproliferation.

  [Excerpts] Recent news reports from the Korean peninsula 
speak of the continuation of the American interventionist policy 
in that region. 
  During the past few days, Washington has, once again, 
brought 
serious crisis to the Korean peninsula through its provocative 
acts such as the announcement of stationing Patriot missiles in 
South Korea and deciding to resume its joint maneuvers with 
North Korea. [passage omitted] 
  Paying attention to the current situation in the east Asia 
region and the Pacific Ocean makes it clear that the American 
policy aimed at creating tension in the Korean peninsula is 
intended as a long-term measure. 
  The east Asia region is the focus of attention of the big 
powers, such as America, because it seems that that region would 
play a more significant role in international developments in 
the future. Particularly that the Pacific Ocean region has, 
during the past few years, turned into an international focal 
point, and the rate of growth in some of the countries of the 
region, such as China, has reached a level that is currently 
unachievable by advanced industrial countries. It is clear that 
the continuation of such a trend, which is achieved through the 
continuation of efforts to maintain stability in the region, 
would force America to withdraw its 6,000-strong force from the 
Korean peninsula, which would mean losing its economic or 
military control of the region. That is an issue which, 
according to the White House politicians, contradicts the 
American strategy.

    [Editorial Report] Tehran IRIB Television Second Program 
Network in Persian at 1520 GMT on 1 April carries a live relay 
of the Friday prayer sermons delivered by Ayatollah Meshkini at 
Qom. Reception is good. 
  Ayatollah Meshkini begins his first sermon with three 
minutes 
of Arabic prayers. He then says: "I would like to say a few 
sentences about the issue of Marja'iyat [the status of being the 
source of emulation]. Someone may ask from what source our 
sources of emulation derive their decrees and interpretations, 
which they then pass on to people as God's strictures." 
Meshkini asserts that all the fatwas and interpretations about 
the correct performance of religious rituals and moral conduct, 
and also about proper and acceptable religious belief, have one 
single source, out of which two currents flow. The source, he 
states, is the prophet, and the two currents are the Koran and 
the tradition. He then goes on to stress that Koran is a divine 
phenomenon, and as such its words cannot be questioned. The 
Koran, therefore, was passed intact through the generations, 
until it reached the hands of the Marja'. 
  On the question of the tradition, he says: "As far as the 
issue of tradition is concerned, this is where we differ 
significantly from our Sunni brothers. How lucky you, the 
Shiite faithful, are." He then quotes an Arabic verse, and 
Persian poetry about the Shiites' devotion to their imams. He 
goes on to say that whatever the prophet said was learned and 
safeguarded by 'Ali, the first imam. He says: "We believe that 
the tradition was left with 'Ali for safekeeping, and 'Ali 
passed it on to Hasan, who then passed it to Hoseyn, who in 
turn gave it to Sajjad; Sajjad gave to Baqir, who then passed it 
to Sadiq. Then it passed from Sadiq to Kazem, Kazem to Reza, 
Reza to Javad, Javad to Naqi, Naqi to Askari, and Askari to the 
hidden imam. This all tells us that the prophet's tradition is 
in fact exactly the same as the one which has been passed to us 
and our sources of emulation today." 
  Meshkini then cites remarks and work on the tradition by the 
late Ayatollah Borujerdi, saying that he had 36,000 quotations 
from the prophet and the imams in his book, all of which can be 
proved to be authentic. He then declares: "To sum up, I would 
like to say that if someone asks from what source and what 
reference point a source of emulation derives his 
interpretations, then we have to answer that the sources and the 
points of reference are the divine book and the tradition of the 
prophet, which has been passed to us by the imams." After 
reciting an Arabic verse, he says: "The Sunni doctrine should 
not then be referred to as the orthodox sect; orthodoxy is in 
fact inherent within the Shiite doctrine, because it is the 
Shiites who have found the true Islamic tradition, on the basis 
of which they set out to issue decrees and interpretations. I 
will, on another occasion, refer to the Sunni mode of reasoning 
and interpretation, and the methods they choose. We are proud 
to be Shiites of the immaculate family of imams."

<F P=106> [Second Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, </F>
head of the judiciary branch and acting Friday prayers leader, 
in Tehran on 1 April -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. [passage omitted] Today is 12 Farvardin [1 
April]. In fact, 16 years have passed since the victory of the 
revolution. [passage omitted] I presume that the form of our 
Islamic government is still unfamiliar to the world. Whenever 
the world refers to the Islamic Republic -- its decisions, 
organizations, officials, and responsibilities -- one senses 
that the world has not properly understood the formation of our 
government. [passage omitted] When the word, republic, comes 
to mind, people think it is like other republics. Yes, they do. 
The majority of the people voted for it; that is, 98.2 percent 
of all Iranians who could vote said yes to the Islamic Republic, 
and this system relies on the public vote. Its decisions take 
shape through by voting. Majles representatives are elected by 
voting. Members of the Experts Assembly are elected by the 
people. People use the ballot in many other cases. [passage 
omitted] 
  Our people use the ballot to ensure that the government 
respects religious laws in employment and in the execution of 
government affairs. They voted that women should respect 
Islamic norms once they accept responsibility in organizations 
of the system. The republic has voted for the sovereignty of 
Islam. All people have called for the sovereignty of Islam. In 
some cases, it is true, votes are cast but they are not in 
contradiction with the principles of Islam. There is a 
supervisory body -- the honored Guardian Council which reviews 
approved bills and rejects things that contradict the 
constitution and the religious laws. Anyway, Islam is sovereign. 
  The world has not understood the form of the Islamic rule. 
They sometimes ask: Who is the first person of the system? 
They see that in other systems the head of the executive is the 
first person. Then they see that the Islamic system is 
different, where the first person is the supreme jurisconsult 
and has the honored position of the leadership, presently his 
eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, may God preserve his noble shadow, 
[crowd chants in approval]. And he is responsible for 
determining the general plan of the country's management. In 
truth, the legitimacy of the other officials of the system is 
formed and actualized in their relationship to him. Of course, 
here I do not want to discuss the form of Islamic government 
which includes legitimacy, the measures of legitimacy, the 
method of activity, and the limits of activity. This is an 
extensive debate that must be discussed in its place. But I 
want to say that some officials in some countries speak, and one 
understands them to be thinking that republic in this system is 
the same as republic in some Arab or European country. Then 
they realize that the systems are not compatible in some issues 
and therefore ask: what are we to do? You should inform 
yourselves better. Improve your knowledge. You should 
understand our system, our people, our system of government and 
the rights and duties of each official. 
  Take for example, as you know, the judiciary. In places I 
have visited during my term of office, or in various countries 
of the world which I have studied, the highest person 
responsible for the judiciary is in fact supervised by the 
executive and even in many places he is appointed by the 
president. Even in systems managed by councils, a number of the 
council members are appointed by the president. But our system 
is different. In our system, the official responsible for the 
judiciary is directly appointed by the esteemed leader. 
Naturally then there are many differences in terms of laws, 
rights, and manifestations. In fact, the independence of the 
three powers is relatively greater in Islamic government than 
the systems existing in the world today. Anyway, in the Islamic 
republic, where the republic has called for Islam and where all 
the officials of the system work on the basis of Islam, there is 
a particular system with its particular methods, manifestations 
and consequences. [passage omitted] 
  There are a few other minor issues. Concerning the issue 
of the pilgrimage, I will voice my own view: First of all, I 
wish to point out to high-ranking officials that bilateral or 
multilateral issues cannot be resolved on a unilateral basis. 
One should never lose sight of this fact and try to resolve the 
issue on a unilateral basis. Whenever there is a bilateral or 
multilateral issue, we must accept the face that it should be 
resolved on a bilateral or multilateral basis. This is the 
terminology being used by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A 
unilateral solution is either no solution at all or, even if it 
is a solution, it is only a temporary solution and may have 
other consequences. 
  Therefore, on the pilgrimage issue, one should accept that 
the problem is a bilateral problem. In order to resolve this 
problem, one should act in a bilateral way and, God willing, get 
to the root of the problem. In this connection, of course, if 
there are any words of advice or caution, any facts, one should 
bring these to the notice of the Saudi Government. One should 
remind them of the issues, inform them of the facts, and explain 
the situation of the Islamic Republics compared with other 
countries. When they say that there is no difference between 
this country and another country, one should tell them that 
there is a difference and there are reasons for the difference, 
and so on. One should explain the issues to them so that a 
correct solution can be found and the issue resolved on a 
fundamental basis. This is one point, that one cannot solve 
these problems from a unilateral point of view. 
  Of course, you know that the responsible officials have been 
trying to have discussions, they are discussing it, and I do not 
have any specific information about the outcome of these talks. 
One should not make a promise from this podium unless it is 
clearly based on facts and is definite; and as I do not have any 
specific information I will not make any promises. 
  The second issue - again I'm giving you my own opinion: It 
seems to me that we should clarify the issue and appoint someone 
with full powers. He should be told: Go and pursue the matter 
until a solution is found. This is the way to solve the 
problem. When every day we have a situation in which a certain 
newspaper of our country writes a certain article, a certain 
Saudi newspaper writes another article and a newspaper in a 
third country -- which has nothing to do with the Islamic 
Republic or with Saudi Arabia -- writes something else -- this 
newspaper is a famous newspaper. These are all examples, each 
one of them have to be discussed. If a newspaper has written a 
certain article, what has that got to do with the fate of two 
countries? If a newspaper has published something, what has 
that got to do with the fate of a country? 
  Newspapers are free; each one of them publishes articles 
according to their taste. The issues of a country cannot be 
given to a couple of journalists to play with. A journalist's 
job is to do this. He looks at the issues and increases the 
size of his headline or reduces it. Or he might write something 
catchy for his headline and when you look at the article you do 
not see that much. I know a number of newspapers will not like 
what I am saying, but I have examples for everything I say. 
  All I am saying is that someone should be given the 
responsibility by the higher authorities of the country -- with 
full powers and taking into account all the realities in our 
country, in the other country and in the world of Islam -- to 
solve this problem fundamentally and once and for all; and far 
from the fears and discussions created by newspapers, especially 
the media and newspapers of other countries, who are waiting for 
such opportunities to say something or other. The problem 
should be solved once and for all. 
  The third issue -- again, this is my opinion: Regarding the 
hajj, I don't know if this decision was made by our esteemed 
deputy minister of culture and Islamic guidance or the minister 
of guidance or both. However, I say this: How many times should 
we experience one issue? If we experienced something and we 
were not successful, we should not go through it again. We 
should not repeat the act since we experienced defeat. When I 
see that it is officially announced that if someone were to have 
a passport and the passport holder had the visa to visit that 
country and we said: We will not give you an exit visa. I ask 
the honorable minister, and the esteemed deputy minister: Are 
you in a position to ban anyone from travelling abroad? Is 
leaving the country in your hands? What is the legal basis of 
your decision? You did this once, and you saw that certain 
people, even those held in high esteem by you, with passports at 
hand entered Saudi Arabia via other countries during the hajj. 
And you saw them there and they said to you: Hello, how are 
you! Why did you do this and create problems for us and 
yourselves? You did not achieve anything. My first point is 
legal and the political point is secondary. 
  I say that the Hajj Organization or the Guidance Ministry -- 
because I do not know who made this decision.... [pauses] If 
someone has a passport, that means it does not matter. If 
someone has a visa, it means it does not matter. With a 
passport and a visa, why do you say: We will not let you go? 
You cannot say this. It is not within your jurisdiction to ban 
someone from travel abroad. What is this! How many people are 
there in the country who can do this? How many people can leave 
the country to go to hajj and be honored in this way? Let us 
pay a bit more attention to reality. In other words, limit the 
people to the extent that is called for, and by taking into 
account all the issues. [passage omitted] 
  Palestine -- and about yesterday's agreement in Cairo -- 
and Mr. Clinton's remarks -- I really don't know; we must really 
ask the American President: who gave you the right -- you, who 
are on the other side of the world -- and on the basis of what 
criteria? Even if we look at it on the basis of common law -- 
on the basis of what criteria do you say that Quds [Jerusalem] 
belongs to Israel? On the basis of what criteria? 
  You are the President of the United States. That is fine. 
The people of the United States voted for you. What right does 
this give you to interfere in the country of Palestine -- or 
Israel, as it stands? These remarks do not have any legal or 
judicial basis, even on the basis of common law. That is the 
first point. 
  Secondly, let me say this to you: Palestine, the people of 
Palestine and Quds, all these agreements, remarks, signatures, 
and talks, as you have seen in practice, Palestinian jihadi 
groups are unanimously opposed to them. There are strikes every 
day. There are clashes every day. There are killings every 
day. The pure blood of the martyrs of the shrine of Abraham in 
al-Khalil [Hebron] has not even dried yet. The blood of the 
martyrs of the incident which took place a few days ago has not 
dried yet. Do you think that by just gathering together in a 
country such as Egypt, for example, or elsewhere and signing a 
piece of paper you can solve everything? You can do away with 
past promises? 
  The people of Palestine are the true owners of Palestine. 
Quds is the permanent and eternal capital of Palestine and 
Palestine belongs to the Palestinian people. [crowd chants in 
support] 
  They commit the worst crime. The entire world says that it 
was the ugliest crime to massacre people while they were 
kneeling in prayer in a mosque. Then they say that it was done 
by an extremist group; it had nothing to do with the government. 
A few days later, they kill a number of other people. Then 
they say, yes, it was such and such a group and it had nothing 
to do with the government. They use trickery and wear different 
clothes, then they massacre Palestinian youths, and then they 
give some other explanation for the incident. 
  Let me tell you this: apart from military and war issues, 
the 
killers of the Palestinian Muslims in the Hebron mosque must 
definitely be brought before an international penal court sooner 
or later; whoever they may be. You say they are an extremist 
group, we say it was the government itself under the guise of an 
extremist group, and others say the order came from even higher 
up: from the United States or wherever else. What I am saying 
is this: an international penal court must definitely examine 
and try this crime and punish the perpetrators. [crowd chants in 
support] 
  We hope the Armenian Government responds to the Foreign 
Ministry statement as soon as possible. Procrastinating and 
saying we have not officially received a report yet, or that it 
has been rushed, and so forth, will not suffice. In any case, 
an incident has occurred and the plane carrying a number of 
innocent people has crashed. The Foreign Ministry has 
investigated the matter and announced the results. A reply must 
be made. 
  About our Afghan brothers, I do not know how to say it. Do 
they, themselves, know that there have recently been whispers in 
the world of appointing a guardian, of a partition, and so 
forth. Do you know what the outcome of the continuation of 
these wars and domestic clashes will be? For God's sake, for 
Islam's sake, leave these power struggles aside, stop these 
civil wars; put an end to the matter; do not break your recent 
cease fire; come and sit together and solve the problem and 
preserve Islam; do not ruin any further this ruined country. 
Otherwise one of oppressors or infidels who ruled your country 
for many years would come from the other side of the world, 
under the pretext that you cannot manage yourselves, and lay 
their hands on the country, and you will once again be enslaved 
by another power. Come and put an end to the matter. We hope 
that your cease-fire will have a happy ending. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by M. Paydar: "Tehran, Beijing, New Delhi: ASEAN </F>
Plus the ECO"] 
  [Excerpts] Early last week, only a few hours after the 
visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to Tehran, Indian 
External Affairs Minister Dinesh Singh arrived in Tehran. Singh 
stated that the objective of this visit was to continue and 
expand the warm and cordial talks between India and Iran. 
[passage omitted] 
  Both India and Iran are large regional countries with a 
special role in Asian security, both because of the vastness of 
their territories, their command of maritime areas, their 
erudite work force, their history and culture, and above all, 
the fact that they belong to the Third World. [passage omitted] 
  The only weak point is India's differences with Pakistan, 
which has become a problem as far as stability in the Indian 
Ocean is concerned. At any rate, there is no doubt that if 
Islamabad is excluded from security dealings, the logic behind 
any regional political-security forecast or planning will 
collapse. For various reasons stemming from its understanding 
on its own national interests, Iran naturally wants some 
breathing space for its foreign policy. By nature, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran cannot limit itself to a small political, 
economic, and security sphere. Therefore, it has always tried 
to expand its strategic horizons in relationship to its 
position. It is natural that the Indian subcontinent, 
stretching as far as China's borders, is of special importance 
in this sphere of interest. Logically, in the effort to develop 
this area, it is practically impossible for Iran to ignore or 
exclude Pakistan. Of course, this part of the process may be 
delayed but it cannot be ignored. Therefore, any solution that 
ends the Indian-Pakistani dispute is not only to Iran's benefit 
but will also open up the last remaining door to cooperation 
among the south-central Asian countries and the Indian 
subcontinent, stretching from South Asia to east Asia. In other 
words, it would make possible the final steps for uniting the 
ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] and ASEAN [Association 
of South East Asian Nations]. In this regard, ASEAN's Permanent 
Secretary General Singh, who is in Bangkok for a meeting of the 
organization's top officials, has stated that he will pay a 
visit to Tehran soon. Pointing out that this visit is very 
important, Singh stated that the ECO is extremely interested in 
expanding its relations with ASEAN. 
  But will the expansion of Iran's relations with some 
regional 
countries be contingent on the internal relations in ECO? No 
definite answer can be given to this question yet; the answer 
depends on to what extent ECO will allow its members--namely 
Iran--a free hand in regional cooperation. Naturally if the ECO 
acts as a cartel like OPEC, members will face limitations, not 
only vis-a-vis India but also other countries and other 
economic-political alliances. Political and economic observers 
believe that if the ECO acts like a regional cartel, it will 
fail because none of the ECO members currently is economically 
competitive, with all its members facing economic problems. 
  Iran, Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the six Central 
Asian republics that were recently admitted to ECO all face 
extensive economic problems. Even in the most optimistic view, 
this alliance will only benefit the member countries themselves, 
and to an extremely limited extent. Therefore, it has no 
benefits for the Asian continent as a whole. Also, the increase 
the ECO membership poses a problem because it is not clear what 
benefits countries like Afghanistan and Tajikistan bring to it 
apart from absorbing the organization's limited capital, which 
mostly comes from Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan. 
  ECO's counterpart ASEAN consists of countries located in 
south and southeast Asia; and despite the fact that it is a 
regional body, it has also become an active and successful 
political and economic group of worldwide significance, and it 
also welcomes new members. 
  It is natural for ASEAN to want to expand its influence and 
for the ECO to seek an effective atmosphere in which to operate. 
But can these two alliances absorb each other? 
  Fortunately both sides have reasons enough to give a 
positive 
answer to this question. During the recent visit by Chinese 
Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to Iran as well as 
the visit by Indian External Affairs Minister Dinesh Singh, the 
topic of cooperation between the ECO and ASEAN was seriously 
discussed. Qian Qichen said that ECO-ASEAN cooperation and even 
the formation of a new organization from the two is important, 
adding that he had discussed the topic with Iranian officials. 
India too welcomes the formation of a new organization in the 
region because this would free it from unilateral dealings with 
each and every ECO member, notably with Pakistan. 
  It now appears that the formation of a new alliance in the 
region is an extremely necessary and inevitable fact and that 
the coming visit by the ASEAN secretary general to Tehran will 
be a very good opportunity for serious preliminary consultations 
on this topic. 
  Apart from according Iran, India, and China outstanding 
roles 
in Asia, a new alliance would also endorse the Islamic 
Republic's supremacy over a large part of Asia--from Asia Minor 
to western China. And as stated by a Chinese diplomat of the 
region: 
  "The formation of a new alliance in Asia would, first and 
foremost, divide the region among three immense political and 
economic poles. Iran and China would be the poles on either 
side, with India in the middle linking the other two. 
  "The first pole's scope would include Turkey, Afghanistan, 
and the newly-independent countries; and Iran will have full 
supremacy over this pole because of the vastness of its area, 
its seacoast, its air and land routes, its immense and 
relatively skilled manpower, its membership in OPEC and access 
to financial resources, its political stability, the general 
inclination of its economy toward capitalism, its membership in 
the Nonaligned Movement, and its fully independent policy." 
  Asked why Turkey would not assume such supremacy, the 
diplomat answered: 
  "It is clear that Turkey lacks all these factors. Also, the 
absence of political stability at home and its dependence on 
NATO are problems that cannot be ignored. This is extremely 
important to Iran, China, and India. Therefore, the western 
sector extending to the central area of this alliance will be, 
or should be, in the hands of Iran. 
  "Similarly, India can organize the middle section of the 
alliance because of its technical and economic potentials, its 
vast area, its supremacy over the Indian Ocean, the general 
inclination of world capitalism to invest in India, very cheap 
labor, and an annual economic growth rate above 8.5 percent, 
ranking second only to China. So it can be a bridge between Iran 
and China in this alliance. And, who knows, maybe this alliance 
can play a part in ending the differences between India and 
Pakistan, in which case Iran will gain another trump card." 
  This Chinese diplomat added: "The eastern front is also very 
important. Actually, the balance between the central and the 
western fronts is in China's hands. Because of its high 
economic growth rate of more than 11 percent, its high technical 
and agricultural levels and because of its generally favorable 
economy, it is impossible for ASEAN to make any decisions 
without taking China into consideration. Also, the regional 
economy is greatly affected by China's economy. In 1997, when 
Hong Kong is returned to China, this influence will increase. 
Therefore, China will seek ways to expand its economic 
influence." 
  Some political experts fully agree with the views of this 
Chinese diplomat and say that regardless of the reason, the 
formation of such an alliance at a time when countries are 
showing preference for political, economic, and security 
groupings and alliances rather than going it alone and at a time 
when the meaning of national development is synonymous with 
regional development, membership in supra-regional alliances 
appears to be imperative. And forming and belonging to regional 
and supra-regional alliances is now considered an important 
factor in international relations and stances. 
  A general glance at the all aspects of Iran's domestic and 
foreign policies shows an inclination toward such a polarization 
in this region. Both the Chinese and the Indians have much 
experience in workings and the uses of big alliances. 
Therefore, Iran should prepare its diplomatic machinery to 
participate in such an organization. The ECO is approaching the 
end of its traditional role, and because of world economic 
reality it will have to play a new role within a new entity; and 
the winner will be the one that adapts the best.

  [Text] Minister of Health Dr. Umid Midhat Mubarak returned 
to Baghdad today after attending meetings of the Arab health 
ministers' council, which convened in Cairo on 30 March. 
  In a statement to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY, the minister said 
that the Iraqi delegation was held in high esteem by most 
conferees, who demanded that the unfair embargo clamped on the 
lofty Iraqi people be lifted, particularly since this embargo 
has claimed the lives of thousands of children, women, and 
elderly due to acute food and medicine shortages. 
  The minister noted that he held a private meeting with Arab 
League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid. During the 
meeting, the actual reasons for maintaining the unfair anti-Iraq 
embargo were addressed. The minister explained that the Arab 
League secretary general demonstrated special concern for this 
issue, and urged all Arab League offices in the world to clarify 
the relevant facts to the world public to aid efforts to lift 
the unfair embargo clamped on the Iraqi people. 
  The minister also indicated that he held other meetings with 
the heads of most delegations attending the meetings. He noted 
that he discussed with them bilateral ties and means of 
promoting them, especially in the area of health. The minister 
also met with Regional WHO Director Dr. Husayn al-Jaza'iri. 
  The conferees attending the Cairo meeting discussed the 
enhancement of health cooperation among the Arab health 
agencies, as well as other issues to promote the Arab health 
endeavor.

  [Text] Nicosia, April 3 (AFP) -- Gunmen shot dead an AFP 
correspondent and her bodyguard in an ambush near 
al-Sulaymaniyah in Iraqi Kurdistan on Sunday [3 April], UN aid 
workers said. 
  Lissy Schmidt, a 35-year-old German, was travelling by car 
with her Iraqi Kurdish bodyguard when they were attacked east of 
the city, Steven Allen of UNICEF in the northern Iraqi town of 
Irbil told AFP by telephone. 
  The ambush occurred at 1:00 p.m. (0900 GMT). 
  Schmidt was the only foreign journalist permanently based in 
Iraqi Kurdistan, which has had de facto autonomy since a Kurdish 
uprising against the Baghdad regime following the 
January-February 1991 Gulf war. 
  She worked for AFP and the German media, notably the 
Frankfurter Rundschau and Tagesspiegel newspapers.

  [Text] Baghdad, 3 Apr (INA) -- Taha Yasin Ramadan, Ba'th 
Party National Command member and deputy prime minister, has 
stated that the new order championed by the United States will 
inevitably fail because it is based on hegemony, exploitation, 
and aggression. 
  In a speech at the opening of the cultural season organized 
by the secretariat of Arab students in Baghdad, Ramadan said 
that the dissension among the UN Security Council members on the 
question of the embargo imposed on Iraq is a positive element in 
Iraq's interest. He said this positive stand can be viewed as a 
victory for the Iraqis who have scored it thanks to their 
steadfastness, struggle, abidance by their principles and 
rights, and their rallying around Saddam Husayn, the leader of 
the brilliant march. 
  Ramadan urged the oppressed people to resist injustice and 
hegemonistic policies. He said the Iraqis alone shattered the 
myth of U.S. monopoly of the world and showed how false is the 
belief that there is a united stand against Iraq which the 
United States had created through its deceptive and misleading 
policies and its colonialistic blackmail methods. 
  Ramadan said that by distancing themselves from the United 
States and Britain, some UN Security Council members have 
exposed the falsehood of the U.S. claims and how they are 
violating international laws and conventions to achieve their 
designs and interests at the expense of other people and 
countries.

<F P=106> ["From the Heart" column by Ghazi al-'Ayyash: "Iraq's Curse"] </F>
  [Text] A note to the reader: The Iraqi people have a high 
measure of pride and enjoy strong values. Therefore, it is 
perfectly in character for them not to reflect on small deeds 
and spiteful acts by their enemies when those enemies fall into 
the trap of their own evil or receive a dire, divine punishment. 
Hence, we have not gloated over what has happened to the 
criminals who planned and carried out the 30-state aggression, 
thus demonstrating the most remarkable degree of moral nobility. 
However, the truly Iraqi, Ghazi al-'Ayyash, unlike the rest of 
the Iraqis, could no longer tolerate the kind and magnitude of 
the crimes of the enemies of humanity. So he wrote the 
following lines that express legitimate human feelings. 
  [Signed: the Chief Editor] 
  The collapse of former British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher in Santiago, Chile, was not the first such incident for 
one of the symbols of the 30-state aggression against Iraq. 
Former U.S. President George Bush had earlier fainted in Tokyo, 
Japan. Both collapsed in front of television cameras worldwide, 
just as bulls collapse when they are about to enter a 
slaughterhouse and approach their end. George Bush collapsed 
like a worn bull that fought in battles too great for him. 
Margaret Thatcher fell and her head drooped like a sick sheep 
falling under the feet of its herd. 
  Here, we are not gloating, nor praying to God for the death 
of George Bush, Margaret Thatcher, or others whose hands were 
smeared with the blood of the innocent Iraqis, those who had a 
hand in imposing an unjust embargo against the Iraqi people, or 
those who denied Iraqi children and sick people food and 
medicine, thus causing their death en masse. We have faith and 
know that we are all going to die. However, we pray to God for 
their long suffering and agony. We pray to God to infect them 
with scabies that make their bodies itch constantly, denying 
them sleep at night and the joys of life in daytime. 
  We pray to God to make those people lose their eyesight, 
having lost their insight. We pray that their minds and tongues 
be paralyzed, and that their hearts be rent over the death of 
their most beloved ones. We pray that their spite will eat into 
their bodies and those of their grandchildren. We pray they 
lose their way in the desert, naked and barefoot, and look for a 
drop of water but find only a mirage. We hope they are denied 
everything they like, that they will never feel happy and that 
they will lose their minds. We hope they will turn into a 
laughable joke to amuse children. We hope adults will kick them 
as well. 
  The curse of the Iraqis shall haunt them, just like the 
curse 
of the Pharaohs has been haunting those who infringe upon their 
boundaries, sanctity, rights, and land. The curse of the Iraqis 
has begun to haunt them, for mysterious diseases are eating away 
their soldiers and earthquakes and volcanoes are destroying 
American cities and the cities of other countries that took part 
in the aggression against Iraq. Gorbachev has been overwhelmed 
by the disgrace of the disintegration of the former Soviet Union 
and the tribulations of its peoples. Shevardnadze, who was 
foreign minister of the Soviet Union during the 30-state 
aggression against Iraq and who contributed to this aggression, 
is today crying over the rubble of his country, Georgia, and its 
ordeal and is seeking shelter under the spears of the soldiers 
of another country. British Prime Minister John Major is now 
walking on thin ice. Any moment now, he could fall into a 
bottomless abyss from which he will never return. 
  The symptoms of the Iraq curse have started to appear on 
U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. He still has not come up with a way to 
handle the Whitewater scandal. The world economy is being shaken 
and is about to collapse. The governments that contributed to 
the aggression against Iraq have all fallen, haunted by the 
curse of their scandals and their people's disavowal of them. 
They have fallen into the abyss. Some of them are still 
waiting. This is the inevitable fate of all tyrants and 
despots. It is a natural outcome of what they did to a 
faithful, peaceful people, the people of Iraq. The curse of the 
Iraqis promises them more dire consequences.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: The U.S. Administration's decision to 
keep Syria on the list of countries accused of not combating 
drugs leads us to question the purpose behind this decision in 
terms of the peace process and the United States' role in it. 
We are not worried about aid that could be withheld because of 
such a decision or by the drug list itself or any other similar 
lists. What is important is who and what is behind this 
decision. 
  The U.S. press a few days ago explained who is behind the 
decision when it revealed that certain named elements rejected a 
recommendation by a competent body within the U.S. Department of 
State to lift Syria's name from the drug list and insisted on 
keeping it. These elements are well known for their loyalties 
and bias toward the other non-Arab party in the Arab-Zionist 
conflict. Their stands have often obstructed the peace process 
to serve the Israeli party. 
  The fact that these elements are behind this decision, 
indicates that the issue is not an issue of drugs or Syrian 
efforts to put an end to the production and distribution of such 
a blight. Indeed, it is a means to exert pressure on Syria to 
influence its stands. But Syria's stand cannot be bargained 
over in terms of a comprehensive and just peace in the region or 
the legitimate bases on which this peace should be founded. If 
the concern of those elements was really to combat the blight of 
drugs, then this concern would have been compatible with Syria's 
concern. Moreover, fairness would have prompted them to admit 
the fact sensed by every citizen in Syria and Lebanon, and even 
by every honest observer, that Syria has exerted serious efforts 
and enacted deterrent legislations aimed at uprooting this 
blight -- in terms of production, distribution, and addiction. 
  However, was real the motive of those who have insisted on 
keeping Syria on their list to expose Syria's stand on combating 
drugs or to undermine Syria's stands on the issue of a just and 
comprehensive peace? The answer is clear by defining who is and 
what is behind that decision. We, in Syria, did not and will 
not pay heed to this list or other similar lists. We will 
persevere in our efforts and sustain our stands toward uprooting 
the blight of aggression and occupation from our occupied 
territories just as much as we are seeking to uproot the blight 
of drugs. This is in order to have security, stability, peace, 
and tranquility prevail in this region and to provide all 
necessary conditions conducive to unleashing the potential of 
the sons of this Arab region. 
  As for the U.S. Administration, which has, on the issue of 
this list, adopted the stand of those elements well known for 
obstructing the Middle East peace process, we deem it our right 
to ask: If unfairness on such an obvious issue as combating 
drugs has reached this point, then how can one trust that this 
administration will be a fair, unbiased, and honest partner on 
issues that deal with the fate of the region as faced in the 
peace process?

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' by Safa' </F>
Hijazi in Cairo; date not given; from the "Arabs' Home" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Hijazi] Mr. Faruq al-Shar', Syrian foreign 
minister, the Arab League Council's 101st session had the topic 
of amending the Arab League Charter on its agenda. Some say 
that the Arab situation does not allow this amendment now. When 
will the Arab situation allow it? 
  [Al-Shar'] We in Syria adhere to and insist on rectifying 
the 
Arab situation. We always say, and I said it in front of the 
Arab ministers, that the Arab situation is not in its best 
shape, with Arab countries facing serious problems--Iraq, 
Algeria, Somalia, southern Sudan. Even Yemeni unity is 
threatened with collapse, God forbid, and there is the 
possibility of a civil war in Yemen if the unity falters. All 
this prompts us to work seriously and earnestly to rectify the 
Arab situation and create the right atmosphere for better Arab 
relations. This is our objective, anyway, and we must continue 
to work to realize it. The Gulf war made things difficult, but 
we in Syria believe that we should not consider the Gulf crisis 
the end of the world. True, we must study all the negative 
consequences of the Gulf war and address them in a positive and 
constructive spirit with a view toward remedying the Arab 
situation and serving common Arab interests. 
  [Hijazi] Do you think there is an international collusion to 
disarm the Arabs and retain Israel's arsenal? What about the 
elimination of the mass destruction weapons from the Middle 
East? This was also a topic on the session's agenda. 
  [Al-Shar'] There are international inclinations, with Israel 
behind them, to disarm the Arabs and retain Israel's formidable 
arsenal of conventional and nonconventional weapons. You know 
that Israel possesses and manufactures all kinds of mass 
destruction weapons--nuclear, chemical, and biological. It has 
so far refused to subject its nuclear weapons to international 
supervision and to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and 
the safeguards agreement. Therefore, we believe that 1995 will 
see a review of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and this 
gives the Arabs a chance to adopt a unified position regarding 
the renewal of the treaty on the condition that Israel join it. 
The Arabs must take a position regarding the renewal of the 
treaty if Israel refuses to join it. 
  [Hijazi] The Arab boycott of Israel was also on the agenda. 
What happened? 
  [Al-Shar'] We held contacts with many Arab foreign ministers 
and sensed a unified and firm Arab position; namely, that the 
boycott should continue until its causes--the state of war 
between the Arabs and Israel and Israel's occupation of Arab 
territory--are removed. As long as these causes remain, the 
boycott must be maintained. This is a peaceful act and a 
legitimate right of self defense against aggression and 
occupation. It is strange that we, the Arabs, are asked and 
pressured to lift the boycott, which is a legitimate act of self 
defense, when no pressure is applied on Israel to end its 
illegitimate occupation of the Arab lands. This is not a topic 
for discussion; it was not discussed in the meetings. But there 
was an item on the agenda concerning a report from the main Arab 
Boycott Bureau in Damascus; this is an annual report on the 
activity of the bureau and how to strengthen the boycott by 
closing the gaps that may appear from time to time. The aim was 
not to discuss lifting the boycott. So far, this item has not 
been on the agenda with the purpose of lifting the boycott. 
There was virtual Arab unanimity not to discuss the subject and 
to maintain the boycott.

realized in the Middle East. He added that Russia, in its 
capacity as a superpower and one of the sponsors of the peace 
process, has made and will continue to make all efforts toward 
reaching this objective. 
  He emphasized that Moscow attaches great importance to 
cooperation between Syria and Russia. 
  Ivanov said he will discuss in Damascus issues relating to 
the Middle East peace process in addition to bilateral relations. 
  Concluding his statement, he emphasized that the latest 
Russian initiative is valid and long term, and that its 
implementation depends on the positions of all concerned parties.

  [Text] Damascus, 2 Apr (MENA)--Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Igor Ivanov has emphasized that Russia's initiative to 
hold a new conference on the Middle East peace--Madrid 2-- is 
aimed at the future of the region's peace process and does not 
invalidate the current efforts and negotiations to settle the 
Middle East problem. 
  In (?statements) to the MENA correspondent in Damascus, he 
said the current bilateral negotiations between the Arabs and 
Israel according to the Madrid formula will produce tangible 
results. 
  Ivanov, who is currently visiting Syria, said the essence of 
the Russian initiative is based on the need to hold a new 
meeting of the parties concerned in the Middle East negotiations 
to evaluate what has been achieved, define [words indistinct] of 
the future, and devise a new formula for the future of the 
Middle East peace process. 
  The Russian deputy foreign minister described his talks with 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in Damascus today as very good 
and said they discussed bilateral ties in various fields. He 
added that he sensed during the meeting a mutual understanding 
on reaching a peaceful settlement for the Middle East problem 
and avoiding undermining the negotiating process. 
  He affirmed that his country will pursue an effective and 
active role as a cosponsor of the peace conference and noted 
that President al-Asad welcomes this role. 
  Ivanov said agreement was reached during the talks on 
arranging a bilateral meeting of experts to discuss Syria's 
debts to Russia.

<F P=106> [Sana' al-Imam dispatch from Damascus; from the "Panorama" </F>
program] 
  [Text] In an exclusive statement to Radio Monte Carlo 
following his meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad, Russian 
presidential envoy Igor Ivanov has said that the new Russian 
initiative is based on holding a second conference in Madrid. 
Ivanov said: Despite all the difficulties, the negotiating 
process will lead to tangible results. Holding another 
conference in Madrid will give everyone the opportunity to 
evaluate what has been realized and define the future outlines 
and formulas. However, this conference does not constitute an 
alternative to current negotiations. 
  The Russian envoy said: Those who understood our initiative, 
as I have explained it, supported it and those who understood it 
to be an alternative to the negotiations rejected it. However, 
I do not believe that the initiative is categorically rejected 
although it needs time. 
  Ivanov counseled alertness and vigilance to avoid 
undermining 
the negotiating process. He emphasized Syria's readiness to 
continue pursuing an active and effective role to reach a just 
peace. He said President Hafiz al-Asad welcomes such a role. 
  On the two countries' bilateral relations, the Russian envoy 
said that an agreement has been reached with President al-Asad, 
who is held in high esteem in Russia, as he put it, to give a 
new push to bilateral relations in all fields. As for the 
Syrian debts to Russia, agreement has been reached to hold a 
meeting of experts from both sides to study the various options 
in light of the legitimate interests of both sides. 
  On Russia's views regarding the limited international 
observers [in Hebron] and whether such a number is sufficient to 
protect a city of more than 120,000 Palestinians, Ivanov said 
that this is more a question of the efficiency rather than 
number of observers. 
  Concerning the absence of the Russian role and its 
reemergence recently following the Hebron massacre, the Russian 
envoy said that this role did not disappear in order to 
reemerge, but that it is continuing without clamor unless the 
situation warrants otherwise.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] TISHRIN comments editorially on the Russian deputy 
foreign minister's visit to Damascus to convey a message from 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin to President Hafiz al-Asad. The 
message deals with the peace talks, which have been broken off 
because of Israel's intransigence, maneuvering, and refusal to 
respond to the peace talks' most important requirement, which is 
withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. 
  TISHRIN notes that the latest round of talks in Washington 
following the al-Asad-Clinton summit was disappointing because 
of Israel's continued policy of prevarication and 
procrastination. Once again raising its alleged security 
problems, Israel evaded discussions on withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories. Then, the paper says, the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre took place, only to consolidate the conviction 
that Israel is not serious about peace and that it seeks to use 
the talks as a cover for its aggressive, expansionist actions. 
  TISHRIN stresses that the recent events in the occupied 
territories have increased the conviction of Syria and other 
Arab parties that any peace in the region must be based on a 
just, comprehensive solution that meets Arab aspirations and 
restores the Arab rights and territories. 
  The paper stresses that if the Washington talks are to be 
successful, there is no alternative to an effective U.S., 
Russian, and international role that pushes for the 
implementation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions. 
Implementation of these resolutions means Israel's full 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights and other occupied 
territories. Syria has repeatedly stressed that there will be 
no compromise over the Golan, that there will be no peace 
without full withdrawal, and that Syria will not relinquish an 
iota of territory or any national and pan-Arab right. 
  Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN stresses that Syria wants 
peace, but Syria will never accept the partial and separate 
solutions demanded by Israel. Syria has the right to urge the 
cosponsors of the peace process to translate their assurances 
into a tangible solution that spreads justice and helps 
international law to prevail. 
  AL-BA'TH notes that the suspension of the latest round of 
bilateral peace talks in Washington was because of the Zionist 
settlers' brutal massacre of our kinfolk in the Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  AL-BA'TH adds that when the UN Security Council condemned 
the 
massacre and stressed the need to provide international 
protection for the people of Palestine, and when it emphasized 
the need to continue the peace process, which is viewed as an 
opportunity to achieve security and stability in the region, it 
became necessary to continue coordination among Arab parties in 
order to arrive at a common decision on the resumption of the 
peace negotiations. This has been explicitly stressed by Syria. 
  The paper says that so far, Israel has not shown an explicit 
commitment to withdraw from the Golan Heights. Nor has it shown 
an equal readiness to implement Resolution 425 providing for 
immediate Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. Moreover, 
Israel is continuing its daily crimes against our kinfolk 
throughout the occupied Arab territories. 
  The paper continues: While the U.S. Administration, which 
has frequently stressed its commitment to advancing the peace 
process, is preparing for a renewed diplomatic move prior to the 
resumption of bilateral talks, Russia, as one of the two 
cosponsors, has reasserted its readiness to play its role in the 
peace process. 
  Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH stresses the need for 
concerted international efforts, which can lead to tangible 
results if they focus on changing the intransigent Israeli 
position. The winning card is the UN resolutions, which must be 
implemented, and which must not be allowed to be hampered 
indefinitely by the Rabin government. 
  In a comment, AL-THAWRAH writes on the recent agreement in 
Cairo between Israel and the PLO, providing for the deployment 
of international observers in Hebron. The paper refers to a 
statement by Yosi Beilin, the Israeli deputy foreign minister, 
in which he said that the agreement will change nothing in the 
current state of affairs, and that it has given Israel full 
control over all security affairs in this city. 
  AL-THAWRAH says that such a statement shows that this 
agreement is ineffective, useless, and does not have a shred of 
credibility to give the Palestinians even a little sense of 
security and tranquility. Besides, it does not give any actual 
guarantees for preventing the recurrence of the Zionist 
settlers' massacre in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. The paper adds 
that the agreement does not provide any tangible solution to the 
volatile situation in the occupied territories, a situation 
which is deteriorating daily as a result of the repressive 
Israeli practices. Nor does the agreement provide an adequate 
method for preventing further bloodshed there. 
  Concluding its comment, AL-THAWRAH says that if the Rabin 
government continues its maneuvers and procrastination, and if 
it continues to raise security pretexts to justify the policy of 
occupation and expansion, then it will be fooling nobody but 
itself by this false and deceptive logic. This is because it 
has become common knowledge that only a just, comprehensive 
peace that is accompanied by full withdrawal from all the 
occupied territories can provide security for everyone.

<F P=106> ["Special to the JORDAN TIMES" by Sa'id Silawi] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali said 
Friday [1 April] the government was considering a proposal to 
exempt the first JD [Jordanian Dinar] 5,000-JD6,000 of 
individual income from income tax. 
  In an interview with AL-RA'y and the JORDAN TIMES, Dr. 
al-Majali said the government was reconsidering a number of 
laws, including the law on encouragement of investments with a 
view to ending cutting down bureaucracy and facilitating 
procedures to attract more investments. [sentence as published] 
  On criticism levelled against official media, the prime 
minister said the Ministry of Information had worked out a 
strategy which was adopted last year, but since the minister was 
replaced and the new minister had been heavily preoccupied with 
improtant issues, the official media has looked as if they were 
lagging behind. He noted that the information strategy needs 
people who believe in it in order to translate it into reality 
on the ground. 
  The prime minister said Jordanian press had developed 
tremendously and stressed that the government did not exploit 
its ownership of newspapers' shares to influence the freedom of 
opinion or expression. 
  Dr. al-Majali said the government plans to introduce elected 
district councils in its efforts to decentralise work at 
governorate and district levels. 
  "Decentralisation will turn us into a very advanced state," 
the prime minister said. 
  On the al-'Aqabah siege, Dr. al-Majali said Jordan had 
informed Syria of its decision to stay away from Arab-Israeli 
peace talks until the siege on Aqaba is lifted. Dr. al-Majali 
said the siege undermines peace, adding that "one cannot talk 
peace at a time when he is besieged." 
  On United Nations Security Council Resolution 904 on the 
Hebron massacre, Dr. al-Majali reiterated Jordan's firm position 
towards Jerusalem. 
  "Sovereignty on Jerusalem will only be of God's, and not of 
Israel's, he said. [punctuation as published] 
  The United states has not recognised Jerusalem as the 
capital 
of Israel, Dr. al-Majali said. The inclusion by the Palestine 
Liberation Organisation (PLO), of Jerusalem in Resolution 904 
was done in good intention because "we and the PLO believe in 
the Arab identity of Jerusalem."

  [Text] Amman (J.T.)--Jordanian officials said on Saturday 
[2 April] a Washington meeting of top U.S. bodies in charge of 
searches of ships heading to the Kingdom had been postponed 
until next week. 
  The meeting to review the searches aimed at goods that might 
be transhipped to Iraq, initially had been scheduled to be held 
at the State Department on Thursday, Reuter said. 
  It has been delayed until next Wednesday to allow more time 
to study a three-month-old Jordanian proposal to replace 
offshore with onshore inspections by a third party. 
  His Majesty King Husayn said Monday Jordan would not resume 
peace talks with Israel if the disruptive searches by U.S.-led 
navies enforcing U.N. trade sanctions against Iraq continued. 
  Officials say the inspection has been tightened recently to 
pressure Jordan into signing a peace deal with Israel. 
  Under the proposal expected to be discussed by U.S. 
officials 
on Wednesday, the sea-based inspection by the U.S.-led forces 
will be moved to the port of al-'Aqabah. 
  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said Tuesday that 
Jordan 
felt that the proposal was not given the proper attention it 
deserved since enough time had passed for studying the proposal 
but no action had been taken. 
  A group of Jordanian officials, businessmen and shipping 
agents held a televised debate last week with the secretary of 
the U.N. Sanctions Committee. They explained the negative 
impact of the sanctions enforcement in its present form on 
Jordan's economy. The Sanctions Committee official promised 
that the Kingdom's grievances will be placed before the 
committee.

<F P=106> [By Caroline Faraj in Amman] </F>
  [Text] Jordanian ambassador in Washington Fayiz 
al-Tarawinah has stated that U.S. officials assured him that the 
reasons for postponing the expanded meeting scheduled for last 
Thursday [31 March] among representatives of various U.S. 
Government departments and bodies concerned with foreign affairs 
to discuss available options concerning the naval inspection of 
ships bound for al- 'Aqabah port are purely technical and that 
the meeting is expected to be held next week. 
  In a statement to AL-RA'Y by telephone from Washington, 
al-Tarawinah said that senior U.S. Administration officials have 
understood with complete seriousness [tafahhamu bijiddiyah 
tammah] his majesty's stand as expressed during his meeting with 
ambassadors of the permanent member states on the Security 
Council on the current blockade on al-'Aqabah and that the 
situation was very clear to everybody. 
  During his meetings and contacts with a number of U.S. 
officials, al-Tarawinah asserted that Jordan's position on the 
al-'Aqabah blockade stems from its being an extremely sensitive 
political issue and not a procedural or bureaucratic matter. 
  He said that some officials gave him to understand that next 
week's meeting at the State Department to make a decision on 
al-'Aqabah blockade is expected to be in Jordan's interest. 
  A State Department official said recently that the meeting 
was postponed until next week for reasons connected with 
revision of schedules and times convenient to representatives of 
U.S. departments and bodies concerned with foreign affairs. 
  It is worth mentioning that Jawad al-'Anani, minister of 
state for cabinet affairs and Information minister, told a news 
conference last Tuesday [29 March] that Jordan had proposed that 
a neutral technical committee, such as the Lloyds company, might 
inspect the ships upon docking at al-'Aqabah port.

<F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The U.S.-led naval task force patrolling the 
Red Sea on Saturday [2 April] turned back an al-'Aqaba-bound 
ship carrying animal feed for a Jordanian importer, shipping 
agents said Sunday. 
  The Dolphins I was turned back amid the countdown to a 
meeting this week in Washington where American officials are 
expected to discuss a three month-old proposal to replace 
sea-based inspections by the U.S.led force with onshore checks 
by a neutral international agency. 
  His Majesty King Husayn said Monday that Jordan required a 
statisfactory solution to the siege of al-'Aqabah in order to 
continue playing a positive role in the peace process. 
  The increased international attention on the blockade of the 
Red Sea port has also brought sharp focus on the very legality 
of the inspections. Businessmen said that they had learnt that 
the interception of al-'Aqabah-bound vessels was a self-assumed 
task of the U.S. with no coordination with the U.N. Sanctions 
Committee. 
  T. Gharghur and Fils, agents of Dolphins 1, said in a letter 
to the minister of finance that the vessel, which was carrying 
nearly 4,000 tonnes of soya bean meal--animal feed--was 
intercepted at the Tiran Straits in the mouth of the Gulf of 
Aqaba on Friday. 
  After two inspections of the St. Vincent-flagged ship, 
inspectors aboard the U.S. frigate which intercepted the 
Dolphins 1 ruled that they did not have accessibility to inspect 
the lower holds where the Jordan-bound cargo was stowed and 
therefore could not allow it to proceed to al-'Aqabah. 
  All the papers related to the consignment were in order and 
were produced to the inspectors, including details of the 
consignee, but the inspectors insisted that they should be able 
to check the bagged cargo, said a spokesman for the agents. 
  The Dolphin 1, which was running out of fuel, could not stay 
around in the straits and headed for Port Suez where the cargo 
could be rearranged to satisfy the inspectors before returning 
to the Tiran Straits, the agents said. 
  The process is expected to cost several thousand dollars to 
the importer. 
  No official comment was immediately available. But the 
interception was certain to fuel fears that the Kingdom's 
repeated complaints over the negative impact of Red Sea 
inspection methods on its economy have gone unheeded except for 
repeated American promises that they would be looked into. 
  Meanwhile, Jordanians who met with a visiting U.N. Sanctions 
Committee official last week said they understood that the 
committee had nothing to do with the actual inspections and was 
not kept informed of what is going on in the Red Sea. 
  "We were amazed to get the distinct impression that the 
inspections are a self-assumed task of the U.S. and there was 
little communication, let alone coordination, between the 
enforcers of the sanctions and the committee," said one of those 
who met with Jhiang Zhang Wan, secretary of the sanctions panel, 
which includes representatives of all the 15 members of the 
Security Council. 
  "We could not but reach a conclusion that the U.S. is mostly 
trying unilaterally to cater to the desires of some of the Gulf 
states by maintaining the sanctions on Iraq and also pressure on 
Jordan," said the Jordanian, who declined to be identified 
further. 
  The Jordanian government has filed several memos with the 
Sanctions Committee raising this particular point, but no action 
had been adopted, diplomats said. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said last week 
that he was looking for ways to ease the impact the embargo 
against Iraq is having on Jordan. 
  "We're certainly working on that," Mr. Christopher said. 
"We'd like to find some way to ease the burden on Jordan of 
these inspections... we recognise the pressure on Jordan and the 
disadvantages to Jordan's economy." 
  The U.S. has always maintained that it has Security Council 
authorisation to enforce the sanctions which the world body 
imposed in August 1990 following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
Legal experts have questioned this assertion, however. 
  'Ali al-Dumur, head of the Jordanian Jurists Association, 
said: "Legally there is a grey area between what the U.S. claims 
as the authorisation it has from the Security Council and the 
actual modality of enforcing the sanctions." 
  "But in reality there is no such formal authorisation and 
the 
enforcement of the sanctions and the interception of 
al-'Aqabah-bound vessels were adopted by the U.S. in its own 
interpretation of how to monitor respect for the sanctions," Mr. 
al-Dumur told the JORDAN TIMES. 
  Despite the argument, it is unlikely that any bid to 
challenge the American assertion will be entertained in the 
U.S.-dominated Security Council, observers say. 
  "But that does not mean that we should shut up and put up 
with whatever way the U.S. wants to deal with us," said the 
Jordanian who attended the meeting with the Sanctions Committee 
official. 
  A European diplomat said: "Jordanian patience has to be 
commended since (the Kingdom) put up with the status quo for 
more than three years before deciding that enough was enough and 
took a firm position." 
  "I think most of the Euroepan countries support the 
Jordanian 
stand although it is not yet clear what individual governments 
would do to help the Kingdom," added the diplomat. 
  So far, only France, whose ships often participate in the 
U.S.-led force patrolling the Red Sea, has publicly said that it 
supported the Jordanian position and that an urgent solution to 
the siege of al-'Aqabah had to be found.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Acknowledgement and the Required </F>
Practical Steps"] 
  [Text] Through its secretary of state, the United States 
has reiterated the acknowledgement that the unfair siege to 
which the Port of al-'Aqabah has been subjected for some time 
has damaged and pressured Jordan and its economy. 
  Certainly, such an acknowledgement does not relieve the U.S. 
Administration of its prime responsibility for the outcome of 
this siege of Jordan's only port. It even doubles the U.S. 
responsibility for this siege, because the U.S. Navy is the 
party that carries out acts of harassment and inspection, and 
because the U.S. Administration is the party that controls the 
international decision that is supposed to be made to end 
Jordan's suffering and the pressures on it as a result of this 
unfair siege. 
  By addressing this message directly to those concerned and 
by 
dotting the i's and crossing the t's by requesting the parties 
concerned to halt their pressure and lift the siege, Jordan is 
asking each party to assume its responsibility if this part of 
the world is to be stable and if peace based on justice, 
comprehensiveness, and durability is to be established. 
  Jordan has never failed to comply with international norms 
and laws. Likewise, it has never departed from its policy on 
abiding by the UN resolutions. In return, the international 
community is supposed to champion Jordan's just demands by 
safeguarding its legitimate rights, understanding its 
constructive pan-Arab and regional role, and fairly examining 
the burdens Jordan is shouldering due to its position in the 
center of a region rocked by catastrophes and events due to 
international reasons, regional interpretations, and continued 
Israeli aggression after the Zionist entity was established on 
the land of Palestine. 
  Having realized that it is mainly behind many of the reasons 
for the suffering Jordan is facing and for the repercussions 
Jordan is enduring, the United States must move from sweet words 
that indicate it is aware of Jordan's suffering as a result of 
the siege to making a decision. Such a decision should not only 
lift the unfair embargo, but should also prove, by deeds, that 
the U.S. Administration is in the process of addressing the 
repercussions resulting from the series of injuries and mistakes 
committed against this country. Everyone should be confident 
that Jordan will not yield to pressure, change its positions, or 
relinquish its constant principles to suit circumstances or 
occasions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Lifting the Blockade on Jordan </F>
Before Resuming the Negotiations"] 
  [Text] The fast response shown by France and Japan to the 
Jordanian demand that the blockade imposed on Jordan be 
addressed reflects the international community's respect and 
appreciation for Jordan, especially since the concerned UN 
committee, which is discussing how to address this blockade, has 
acknowledged the great damage inflicted on the Jordanian economy 
and trade. This committee also acknowledged Jordan's commitment 
to the resolutions of international legitimacy. 
  His Majesty King Husayn raised this issue with courage and 
convincing objectivity, and demanded that it be addressed 
quickly. Reactions have clearly shown that the U.S. 
Administration has been most instrumental in maintaining the 
blockade on Jordan and even in a more painful and harmful manner. 
  King Husayn pointed out that Jordan's principled position on 
the peace process and its insistence on resolving the issues of 
the occupied territories, water, the refugees and the displaced, 
and other issues before signing any agreement with Israel had 
annoyed the U.S. Administration, so it practiced various 
pressures and harassments against Jordan in order to force it to 
yield to its will and sign with Israel the agreement which this 
administration wants. 
  King Husayn, however, was well aware of this maneuver and 
announced that Jordan's continued participation in the peace 
process hinges on lifting the unfair U.S. siege on al-'Aqabah. 
Now that Washington has promised to address the situation and 
that U.S. Secretary of State Christopher intends to make a new 
regional tour in the next two weeks and visit Jordan to discuss 
the resumption of negotiations with Israel, the U.S. 
Administration should seriously take the Jordanian position into 
consideration. Jordan is sustaining grave losses as a result 
of this unfair siege on al-'Aqabah. It is inconceivable for 
Jordan to negotiate the achievement of peace in the region at a 
time when it is besieged and encircled without any convincing 
reasons or justifications. 
  It is important for the U.S. Administration to learn that 
Jordan insists on ending this injustice resulting from the U.S. 
blockade before talking with Christopher on resuming the 
negotiations and before talking about peace.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Pressure With No Name"] </F>
  [Text] There is no doubt that Jordan is being subjected to 
tremendous pressures from regional and big powers to fall into 
line with new arrangements in the Middle East, especially a full 
peace based on the dictates of Israel. That pressure is being 
manifested in many ways. In one, Israel wants Jordan to sign a 
peace treaty without settling the thorny issues of land, water 
and refugees. Unless our borders with Israel and Palestine are 
demarcated and fixed there cannot be progress; and unless the 
issues of water and refugees are solved to the satisfaction of 
all parties no peace treaty can stand the test of time. 
Palestinian refugees in Jordan, who number no less than 30 per 
cent of the population, will turn into a destabilising factor to 
the country's security unless and until their plight is solved 
once and for all. 
  As far as water is concerned, Jordan's population, which is 
growing at about three per cent annually, is already running 
short of it but due mainly to the uneven sharing of the water 
resources with Israel. 
  In another way, the U.S., which seems to be all the time 
going along with whatever policies Israel advocates, is putting 
pressure on Jordan on at least two fronts. The first is the 
naval blockade against al-'Aqabah, and the second is in the 
realm of Jordan-Arab relations. On the first count, Jordan can 
only see the blockade as a punishment for Jordan's position 
during the Gulf crisis. Since only al-'Aqabah-bound traffic in 
the whole of the Near East and the East Mediterranean region is 
being checked, the U.S. cannot continue to claim that it is 
merely enforcing the regime of sanctions imposed by the U.N. 
Security Council against Iraq. Jordan is right to ask whether 
the same is being applied to goods destined to Iraq through 
Syria, Turkey or Iran. The blockade against al-'Aqabah can only 
be interpreted as a cruel tool of pressure on Jordan mandated by 
Israel and implemented, with arrogance, by the U.S. and its 
erstwhile allies in the Gulf war. 
  On the Arab front, Jordan cannot understand why it is being 
boycotted by other Arab states in the region, especially Saudi 
Arabia. Jordan has proven it had nothing to do with Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait. its position on foreign intervention in the 
crisis has been vindicated. Some Arab members of the 30-nation 
U.S.-led coalition that fought against Iraq are admitting that 
the whole treatment of the conflict was a sham. Perhaps because 
the Saudi leadership knows very well that the Saudi people 
themselves were against foreign intervention, King Fahd has 
decided not to "forgive" Jordan for pointing to that since the 
very beginning of the crisis. 
  The prime minister, Dr. 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali, said 
recently that the West was not contributing as much as it could 
to Jordan's attempts to mend fences with the Saudis. 
  Well, if the U.S. truly cannot help that cause, Washington 
can at least show goodwill by lifting the al-'Aqabah siege right 
away. Good intentions by the Americans, translated into a 
practical gesture this time, will not only help boost U.S. 
standing among Jordanians. it will also serve America's best 
interests in the region.

<F P=106> ["Opinions" column: "Why the Siege on the Port of </F>
al-'Aqabah," by Mikha'il Jumay'an] 
  [Text] Anyone following the accelerating events in the 
world and the Middle East, particularly after the United States 
became the sole party that dominates the world and controls the 
resources of the Third World states and peoples, and also after 
the UN Security Council came under U.S. sovereignty and after 
the United States made the Security Council peddle its policies, 
carry out its orders, and achieve its numerous interests in the 
world, he will paradoxically discover that there is no special 
U.S. interest in imposing its authority on al-'Aqabah; rather, 
the United States wants to serve Israeli interests and make 
Israel the strongest state in the region. 
  To achieve this, the United States found in imposing a 
strict 
and firm siege on the port of al-'Aqabah a way to humiliate, 
pressure, and force Jordan into signing a separate peace 
agreement with Israel, which Jordan rejects in part and parcel. 
  Jordan has frequently reiterated that it rejects separate 
and 
partial solutions because these are not among its policies. 
Jordan also said that the siege imposed by the U.S. Navy on its 
sole port will not intimidate it, and that it absolutely rejects 
this siege because it harms Jordan's national sovereignty, 
dignity, and reputation. His Majesty King Husayn asserted that 
Jordan's resumption of its role in the peace process hinges on 
lifting the siege on the port of al-'Aqabah and immediately 
addressing this totally unacceptable issue in a new way. 
  This siege has inflicted huge costs and grave economic 
losses 
on Jordanian importers and merchants. Hence, both the Jordanian 
merchants and citizens sustain these losses as a result of 
searching the ships carrying Jordan-bound merchandise on the 
high sea rather than on the dock at al-'Aqabah port and also as 
a result of diverting these ships to ports other than the port 
of al-'Aqabah. This doubles the expenses and delays the transfer 
of merchandise to their owners for several months. This 
constitutes a service for Israel, the strategic ally of the 
United States, and achieves Israel's objectives and expansionist 
and settlement schemes in Palestine and the Arab homeland. 
  The visible practices on the ground since 1948 and the 
series 
of vetoes which the United States used at the Security Council 
and in other international institutions constitute a service for 
Israel, especially since the United States turns a blind eye to 
the series of hideous crimes and massacres committed by the 
Israeli Army and settlers, beginning with the Dayr Yasin, 
Qibyah, and Sabra and Shatila massacres. 
  The United States is still pressuring Jordan and other Arab 
states to lift the boycott of Israel, focusing particularly on 
Jordan because it is the most important state in the region and 
because of its stand on the Gulf war and its demand to find an 
Arab solution to the Gulf crisis. 
  The United States has recently intensified its pressures on 
Jordan due to the latter's position on Jerusalem and its 
dissatisfaction with inserting the Jerusalem issue in Resolution 
904 because Jerusalem was marginally mentioned in it and because 
this resolution did not address the substantive issues 
pertaining to Jerusalem in its capacity as being part of the 
occupied Arab territories. 
  Moreover, Resolution 904 raised the Jewish voices calling 
for 
making Jerusalem Israel's eternal capital, knowing that Muslims 
are the ones most entitled to protect the holy places because 
Islam acknowledges both Judaism and Christianity as it came 
after these two religions. Jerusalem is also a dear city for 
the Hashemites, Muslims, and all Arabs, including Christian 
Arabs. It is the place from which Prophet Muhammad ascended to 
heaven and the cradle of Jesus Christ, so protecting it is an 
Arab and Islamic right that cannot be relinquished no matter how 
dear the price may be.

  [Text] Faysal al-Husayni, head of the Palestinian team to 
the peace negotiations, has called for setting up a joint 
Jordanian-Palestinian committee in permanent session as an 
alternative to occasional visits and periodic meetings. The 
task of such a committee would be to specify, in detail, the 
frameworks, form, and extent of joint cooperation. 
  In an exclusive interview with the Jordanian news agency on 
arriving in Amman en route to occupied Jerusalem tonight, 
al-Husayni added that Jordanian-Palestinian coordination should 
be at the highest levels and that all details should be 
discussed. He said: If we do not proceed in this direction, the 
Israelis will seek to isolate the Palestinians in order to move 
the occupied territories from the Israeli occupation to limited 
self-rule. To prevent Israel from achieving this objective, 
Jordanian-Palestinian cooperation should be enhanced. 
  Al-Husayni asserted that the current phase requires maximum 
coordination. Palestinian-Israeli relations have reached a 
phase in which Jordanian-Palestinian coordination is an 
inevitable necessity. Without such coordination, we would give 
Israel an opportunity to tamper with our cause and plan and make 
whatever decisions it pleases, he said. 
  Al-Husayni added that Palestinian-Jordanian coordination 
should bring us to the point where the Jordanian and Palestinian 
sides would be almost one party. He asserted that the Israeli 
settlements should be removed, and that there is no room for the 
settlers in the occupied territories because they are an 
obstacle to peace. He added that he visited London and Paris 
where he held talks with several officials dealing with the 
Palestine question and European support for the Palestinian 
people. He also met with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat in 
Tunis.

  [Text] Faysal al-Husayni, head of the Palestinian 
delegation to the peace negotiations, hailed the great efforts 
and continuous support Jordan has extended and is extending to 
the current restoration works of the Dome of the Rock. 
  He added: What has been achieved there so far is considered 
a very great accomplishment which has rescued the Dome of the 
Rock. We can only express our thanks and gratitude to Jordan for 
what it has done in this field. 
  In a press statement after meeting with Prime Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali at the Prime Ministry today, al-Husayni 
emphasized the importance of the Jordanian role and the support 
the Jordanian Government extends for the efforts of the 
religious establishments in Jerusalem in order to protect the 
holy shrines there. 
  He said it was agreed that the Islamic Awqaf Establishment 
will shoulder full responsibility for restoration actions in the 
holy al-Aqsa Mosque and the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  He said the enormity of the events and the circumstances 
surrounding us require us to boost current coordination to reach 
the level expected from us during the next stage. 
  He added that during his meeting with Dr. al-Majali, which 
was also attended by Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for 
cabinet affairs and information minister, and the Palestinian 
ambassador in Amman, he discussed several issues, including 
Jerusalem. Great emphasis was placed on this subject and on 
concentrating on bilateral coordination concerning this 
important subject. 
  Answering a question by the Jordanian news agency on the 
Cairo agreement, which the PLO and Israel recently signed, 
al-Husayni said: Expediting Israeli withdrawal and starting to 
implement the agreement will undoubtedly be a step forward, and 
we hope that Israel will apply the agreement in a manner that 
serves the spirit of the agreement. 
  On the international observers who will be deployed in 
Hebron, and whether their number is enough to protect the 
population of this city, al-Husayni said that what is enough to 
protect the population in Hebron is an Israeli withdrawal and 
the uprooting of the Israeli settlements in the area. He added 
the international presence is something new that will 
undoubtedly serve the Palestinian position, and that although it 
is not enough to protect the Palestinians, it will be an 
assisting factor. 
  The meeting discussed in detail the situation in Jerusalem 
and the need to preserve its Arab character, as well as the 
restoration works on of the Dome of the Rock and the holy 
al-Aqsa Mosque. 
  At the meeting, it was agreed that the subject of Jerusalem 
is one of the most important issues, therefore, the two sides 
emphasized the need to activate the Jerusalem Committee that 
Jordan and the PLO had agreed to set up within the framework of 
comprehensive coordination between Jordan and the PLO.

  [Excerpt] The Council of Ministers held a session today 
chaired by Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali. The 
council reviewed the agreement signed in Cairo recently between 
the PLO and Israel regarding the security of Hebron, as well as 
the broad outlines in the agreement regarding the implementation 
of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. 
  Following the session, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of 
state 
for Prime Ministry affairs and minister of information, told the 
Jordanian news agency that the government considers this 
agreement a positive step on the road to a comprehensive 
peaceful solution that leads to the restoration of the basic 
rights of the Palestinian Arab people on their national soil and 
territory. 
  Dr. al-'Anani added that the Council of Ministers asserted 
that the security measures agreed upon between the PLO and 
Israel, namely, the temporary deployment of international 
observers from Norway, Denmark, and Italy, will contribute to 
the protection of the city and its holy sites, since these sites 
are part of Arab and Islamic heritage. This is in addition to 
the right of citizens to worship without any restrictions. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said that as a result of the massacre 
committed 
by the settlers in Hebron and the consequent martyrdom and 
injury of dozens of people in the city, the Jordanian Government 
asserts that the security measures will not be complete unless 
the Israeli Government evacuates the Israeli settlers from the 
city of Hebron. This is meant to return basic rights, after 
settlements were established in the city, and so as to prevent a 
repeat of the acts of violence that have claimed the lives of 
innocent Palestinians. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said the PLO is about to undertake major 
responsibilities in light of the expected developments -- the 
Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories, and the PLO's 
takeover of the territory from which Israel is going to 
withdraw. The government would like to express its support for 
the PLO so that it will be strengthened and so that can assume 
its responsibilities in the best possible manner so as to 
restore the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and so 
that the Palestinian people can attain their rights in full.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Insufficient Step"] </F>
  [Text] After yesterday's Cairo agreement between the PLO 
and Israel to deploy a temporary international presence in 
Hebron, and then to resume self-rule negotiations on Monday [4 
April], the Israeli authorities began, as usual, to belittle the 
importance of this step, considered the first of its kind since 
Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli officials 
began to stress that Hebron sovereignty is Israel's alone and 
that this step was taken to calm the situation and explore 
efforts to bring life back to normal. 
  It seems Israeli acceptance of this step has three 
objectives. The first is to bring the Palestinian party back to 
the table of self-rule negotiations in order to implement the 
Gaza-Jericho First accord. The Palestinian and Israeli 
delegations began negotiations immediately after signing the 
agreement. The second objective is to absorb the vengeance and 
anger of Palestinian citizens in Hebron and the occupied Arab 
territories in the wake of the massacre and the consequent 
killing, terrorism, and siege. The third objective is to 
mislead world public opinion and circumvent the world protest 
that accompanied and followed the massacre in the holy 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque and, since then, the continuing coercion. 
  Despite its importance and significance, this step is not 
enough to prevent more massacres, terrorism, and deliberate 
killing in the Hebron area, Jerusalem, and the occupied Arab 
territories. This will be especially true as long as the 
occupied territories are planted with settlements and as long as 
the Israeli Government is providing weapons, support, and 
protection for the settlers, and even considers them a 
complementary part of its political and security policy. 
  What happened in Hebron happened before in Jerusalem, 'Ayn 
Qara, Dayr Yasin, Qibya, and in Gaza, a few days ago. There are 
plenty of examples. It is likely to happen again anywhere, any 
time. The Zionist objective has not changed, namely, land 
without people. 
  What is really needed to end the attacks on defenseless 
citizens is eliminating the settlements, ousting the settlers 
from inside and outside Hebron and from the occupied 
territories, and providing real and effective international 
protection for the Palestinian people, paving the way to the end 
of the occupation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: A Lame Agreement That Does Not </F>
Guarantee Protection for the Hebron Inhabitants"] 
  [Text] The recent Palestinian-Israeli agreement on 
Hebron's security is an impotent and lame agreement. It cannot 
guarantee the protection of Hebron's inhabitants from settlers 
or occupation troops. An international protection force that 
does not have a deterrent weapon, even to defend itself, cannot 
protect Palestinian citizens from settler terrorism and 
occupation troop bullets. 
  The alleged Israeli withdrawal will be nothing more than a 
redeployment of Israeli forces. They will still be able to 
interfere and kill Arab citizens at any moment. It is 
inconceivable that the international protection force will be 
confined to only one of many occupied Palestinian cities and 
that its inhabitants will be left subject to continued Israeli 
attacks that are escalating in a flagrant brutal manner. 
  Wide popular and official Palestinian and Arab circles have 
criticized the recent Palestinian-Israeli agreement. They 
regarded it as a result of tough Israeli and U.S. pressure on 
the Palestinian side. What draws our attention is the fact that 
the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian leadership has 
not affected the situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 
any way whatsoever, nor has it reduced escalating Israeli 
campaigns of terrorism, repression, and killing of Arab 
citizens. It has not limited mass arrest campaigns among the 
sons of Palestine. 
  Numerous Palestinian martyrs and wounded Palestinians fall 
every day at the hands of Israeli occupation authorities. The 
Palestinian police will deploy in Gaza and Jericho this week, 
according to the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. This police 
force will be linked to the occupation authorities and under 
their supervision and orders. It is feared that this force will 
become a tool of repression against the inhabitants of Gaza and 
Jericho and strike at the glorious intifadah there. If this 
occurs, the Palestinian people will have lost a strong 
bargaining chip. 
  The Palestinian leadership's involvement in signing the 
recent agreement with Israel only gave vent to a wave of 
Palestinian, Arab, and Islamic wrath triggered by the massacre 
at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. No doubt, Israel's 
isolation of the Palestinian leadership in the absence of Arab 
coordination has led to such tragic results.

Arab efforts to promote Yemen's interests based on the 
principles and guidelines of the pledge and accord agreement 
signed by the various Yemeni groups in Amman last February 
through the joint Jordanian-Omani good offices. 
  Concluding his statement, the source said that the 
Omani-Jordanian contacts will continue to follow the Yemeni 
issue as long as the Yemeni brothers remain in need of backing 
and support from Oman and Jordan.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Awdah 'Awdah in Amman] </F>
  [Text] Gathered by Land Day and dispersed by the peace 
process. A rally organized by the intifadah committee of the 
engineers association at the al-Rashid hall in the professional 
unions' complex last night to celebrate the 18th anniversary of 
Land Day had to end prematurely because of differences between 
those who supported and those who opposed a peace march among 
attendees. 
  Only 30 minutes into the rally, and with only two of the 
five 
scheduled speakers heard, a row broke out between those who 
support and those who opposed the peace process. The 
altercation began with the raising of slogans and shouts and 
ended with a fistfight and the throwing of chairs. The fight 
ended after a few minutes and there were no casualties. 
  The master of ceremonies, Muhammad Abu-Taha, exerted great 
but unsuccessful efforts to continue the rally but the audience 
started leaving the hall through doors and windows. 
  The rally was addressed by Muhammad Nayil 'Ubaydat, doyen of 
the dentists association, and Muhammad al-A'raj, known also as 
Abu-al-Ra'id, one of the founders of the Fatah Movement. Taysir 
Khalid, member of the PLO Executive committee and a Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine official; Muhammad Nazzal, 
Hamas representative in Jordan; and Ahmad Nawfal, a professor at 
the University of Jordan, had no chance to deliver their 
speeches at this important annual event. 
  This is the first time the intifadah anniversary celebration 
has failed since the beginning of these celebrations 18 years 
ago.

  [Text] Islamabad, April 1 (AFP) -- Forces opposing Afghan 
President Borhanoddin Rabbani killed and wounded inhabitants 
Friday [1 April] in a hail of rockets, loyalist radio Kabul said. 
  The broadcast, monitored here, said the attack came on the 
eve of a planned visit by a special United Nations peace mission 
led by Mahmoud Mestiri. 
  The UN team is to leave Islamabad for Kabul Saturday for 
talks with Rabbani, his rival, Prime Minister Golboddin 
Hekmatyar, and other factional leaders to explore ways of ending 
13 weeks of fighting for control of Kabul. 
  The radio, controlled by Rabbani loyalists, blamed the 
attack 
on Hekmatyar and his military ally, Abdoul Rashid Dostam, leader 
of the Uzbek militia, and said it came despite their pledge to 
hold a temporary ceasefire from dawn Friday to facilitate the UN 
visit. 
  The radio said people were killed and wounded but it gave no 
figures. 
  No confirmation was immediately available from the rival 
side.

  [Text] KABUL, April 2 (AFP) -- Emerging from a lunchtime 
meeting with United Nations special envoy Mahmud Al-Mestiri 
Saturday, Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani declared his 
committment to a permanent ceasefire in Kabul. 
  "We are ready to accept a permanent and unconditional 
ceasefire," Rabbani told journalists at the Presidential Palace. 
  Rabbani added he hoped the "other side" would follow his 
lead 
on the ceasefire, stop their bombardment of the city, and open 
the highways for free passage of relief food supplies to Kabul. 
  Just before Rabbani emerged from lunch with Mestiri three 
artillery rounds crashed into the neighbourhood, but apart from 
this there was an unusual but welcome calm in the capital. 
  Mestiri heads a UN delegation which will spend three days in 
the capital talking to Afghan leaders in a bid to end the 
current three- month long factional fighting which has killed 
and wounded more than 15,000, driven hundreds of thousands from 
their homes and destroyed vast tracts of the city. 
  Rabbani's chief rival Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar has 
demanded the president's resignation as a precondition for a 
negotiated peace settlement but Mestiri said he did not discuss 
this with Rabbani. 
  "This point was not included in our negotiations," Mestiri 
told AFP. 
  Mestiri's departure from the Presidential Palace was blocked 
by a small group of placard-waving children demonstrating for 
peace. 
  Exiting from his limousine Mestiri spoke with two young 
Afghan girls who handed him their written demands. 
  "I know all the children in Afghanistan want peace," Mestiri 
said, before driving off to the Intercontinental Hotel for his 
next meeting, with provincial peace delegation leader 
Jallaloddin Haqani. 
  The pistol-packing Haqani said all sides in the factional 
fighting had agreed on the point that the military option was 
null and void. 
  However, 200 kilometres (120 miles) north of Kabul fighting 
raged between the forces of Rabbani's commander-in-chief, former 
defence minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, and Hekmatyar's military 
ally, Uzbek warlord General Abdol Rashid Dostam. 
  The fighting is around Dostam-occupied Qelagai, where 
massive 
amounts of ammunition and large numbers of Masood troops are 
being trucked daily in preparation for an attack against the 
strategic centre of Pul-e Khumri, half an hour's drive further 
north. 
  UN sources said there was a possibility that observers might 
be sent to Kabul to monitor the situation but ruled out the 
military role of Blue Helmets as peace-makers.

  [Text] The infamous Golboddin-Dostum militia launched a 
futile attack on the Islamic army's positions last night from 
the southern direction but was repulsed by the Islamic army's 
counterattack after loosing three opposition forces positions 
and suffering heavy losses. 
  A responsible source of the Ministry of Defense said to the 
correspondent of Bakhtar Information Agency that the savage 
militia last night at 0100 attempted to invade the Islamic 
army's positions from the southern direction but forced to 
retreat after suffering heavy losses; three of their positions 
were seized by the Islamic army. The source added that the 
infamous militia after this defeat carried out a rocket attack 
on residential regions of Kabul as a result of which a large 
number of our citizens were either martyred or injured. A 
number of residences were demolished. The attack took place 
with only one day remaining from the visit to Kabul of Mahmud 
Mastiri, special envoy of the UN secretary general. 
  The repeated attacks by the Golboddin-Dostum militia during 
the past two nights and the firing of rockets at the city's 
residential regions is taking place with the aim of showing 
Kabul as insecure. The infamous Golboddin-Dostum militia who 
have faced decisive military defeats both in Kabul and in the 
country's northern regions, are attempting now to create 
obstacles for a special (? presentation of proposals), the will 
of the nation, and peaceseeking international efforts for 
solving conflicts in the country.

  [Text] In occupied Kashmir, widespread demonstrations were 
staged after Juma'h [Friday] congregations today to protest 
against the Indian troops atrocities in the wake of devastation 
of military cantonment in Srinagar. The occasion coincided with 
the death anniversaries of Dr. Abdul Ahad Guru and mojahed 
Ashfaq Majid Wani, considered to be one of the earliest martyrs 
of Kashmiris' struggle. Addressing a big gathering at Jami' 
Masjid [grand mosque] in Srinagar, leaders of All Parties 
Hurriet Conference declared that they would continue to wage war 
against imposed Indian rule till the objective of the struggle 
is achieved. 
  Meanwhile, Indian troops continued their siege and search 
operations, in which many civilians were martyred and wounded. 
A large number of innocent civilians have been arrested during 
these operations. Indian troops opened indiscriminate firing on 
Srinagar- Jammu highway near Pampur, killing a bus conductor, 
Maqbul Dar. In Kangan, dead body of Abdul Ghaffar Gujjar was 
recovered, who had been taken in custody a few days back. Dead 
body of mojahed Ghulam Mohammad was recovered from Doda. 
Mojahedin in retaliation carried out attacks on military 
positions at various places. A number of Indian troops, 
including a major and a subedar [low-ranking army officer], were 
killed when mojahedin attacked a military camp in Laulab area of 
District Kupwara.

  [Text] In occupied Kashmir, five people were reported 
burned alive by the Indian troops when a conflagration was 
caused by excessive mortar shellings by Indian forces during the 
siege of a vast area in Hindwara. Thirty houses were reduced to 
ashes in this reckless military action. The situation in the 
area was described as very tense and reports said the Indian 
military action was still continuing. 
  Meanwhile, in one area of Srinagar, three people were shot 
dead in a military crackdown. Similar crackdowns were also 
carried out in various other localities of Srinagar and Sopor. 
Another report says two bullet-ridden bodies were recovered in 
Bijbiara. The dead were victims of custodial killings. In 
Kulgam, two persons were shot dead by military personnel during 
a siege and search operation. The freedom fighters in a 
retaliatory move opened fire at the troops, but the casualties 
of the occupation troops are not known.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Capping It All"] </F>
  [Text] The new American move to promote nuclear non- 
proliferation in South Asia is yet another illustration of the 
Clinton administration's tendency to come out with glib answers 
to admittedly complicated issues. The proposal aims at getting 
India and Pakistan to agree to cap their nuclear programmes and 
accept international inspection of their nuclear production 
facilities. There is hardly anything new about this approach. It 
had prompted earlier unsuccessful initiatives to bring about 
bilateral or regional accords on nuclear-free zones. The present 
attempt is essentially to present the same idea in a more 
attractive package. New Delhi must be extremely wary of the 
underlying trap. The renewed move is suspect especially because 
it looks like a clumsy stratagem to overcome strong 
Congressional opposition to the administration's frantic bid to 
scuttle the Pressler Amendment and supply F-16 combat aircraft 
to Pakistan. Originally, the administration had sought to oblige 
the Pakistani military establishment in return for the latter's 
agreement to verified capping of that country's nuclear 
programme. Since the proposal made no headway, Washington has 
now come up with the idea of roping in India into this dubious 
exercise. This suggests not so much an eagerness to promote 
nuclear non- proliferation as an overriding need to fulfill 
Pakistan's ambition to get hold of the sophisticated aircraft as 
soon as possible. It is particularly significant that while a 
specific incentive has been offered to Pakistan for accepting 
the capping idea, no sign is yet discernible of a quid pro quo 
to India, too. 
  The more intriguing aspect relates to the facile talk of 
verifiable capping of nuclear installations. It is by now common 
knowledge that the existing mechanism of verifying these has 
proved to be anything but foolproof. The International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] was totally in the dark about Iraq's 
nuclear programme although it was a signatory to the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]. The same fatal deficiency has 
now been indicated in the case of North Korea which, too, has 
formally subscribed to NPT. 
  India has often underscored the vital importance of an 
unquestionably sound verification regime if the objective of 
non-proliferation is to be achieved. But the IAEA has not yet 
devised one. So long as this is the stark reality, New Delhi 
must not allow itself to be cajoled much less coerced into 
accepting any non- proliferation proposal. In fact, credible 
verification of full compliance with nuclear obligations should 
be high on the agenda of the NPT review conference next year. 
The Clinton administration's bid to jump the gun is thus 
entirely misconceived. Most pertinently, India is already a 
co-sponsor with the US of a UN resolution seeking an 
international convention for fissile material cut-off. This is 
all the more reason why the US initiative limited to South Asia 
lacks justification

<F P=106> [Editorial: "She Came and Went Away"] </F>
  [Text] Many people did not believe that Robin Raphel would 
visit India. Experts thought that apart from the normal 
courtesy, Raphel would get nothing more from Indian officials. 
They were also of the view that the majority of political 
parties would display their wrath against her. As a matter of 
fact, the reaction to her visit was quite different. Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao did not meet Raphel. There is a rumor 
that Ms. Raphel is angry with the Indian Government for not 
giving her the opportunity to meet with the prime minister 
during her stay in New Delhi, despite several attempts to do so. 
Rao's close aides are very conscious about not giving any 
foreigner reason to criticize India's traditional hospitality. 
Many of the prime minister's administrative staff and his 
political colleagues held cordial meetings with Raphel. Tea and 
dinner parties were arranged for Raphel, during which she held 
talks with several prominent personalities. Home Minister 
Chavan, who is a bitter critic of the Clinton administration's 
Kashmir policy, talked with Robin Raphel for about an hour. An 
Indian official of Raphel's rank would hardly get the 
opportunity to meet officials in Washington equivalent to those 
Raphel was able to meet in New Delhi. Despite this, the female 
diplomat was accorded a very cordial reception in the Indian 
capital. 
  What is the reason for this cordiality? Our weakness toward 
the white-skinned people is perhaps the main reason behind this 
attitude. It is also due to the enthusiasm of some of our 
bureaucrats and ministers who want to get on the Americans' good 
side. During her visit, both sides were especially cautious. 
Raphel did not make any straightforward comments, which is quite 
contrary to her nature. She was very careful about her 
utterances and thoughtfully considered her words before making 
any statements. This American lady emulated the style adopted by 
diplomats in the past in dealing with such situations. For the 
time being, Raphel has deviated from the style being followed by 
the new and inexperienced officials of the Clinton 
administration. Perhaps Raphel changed her approach because she 
is the first pawn the U.S. President has sent to India. Mr. 
Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state and the second 
pawn, is due in India in the first week of April. It would be 
foolish for New Delhi to seek consolation in the sweet words 
Raphel uttered during her visit. It would be wrong to deduce 
from Raphel's visit that there has been some change in the U.S. 
administration's policy toward India centering on Kashmir and 
the human rights issue. Similarly, it would also be wrong to 
assume that the U.S. efforts to sell F-16's to Pakistan by 
amending the Pressler Amendment have been stalled by this visit. 
  It may be mentioned that the Indian Government was also very 
careful during Robin Raphel's visit, as it does not want to 
offend the U.S. Government unnecessarily. New Delhi adopted 
this posture keeping in mind Narasimha Rao's forthcoming visit 
to Washington. India does not believe that a dramatic 
improvement is possible in the relationship between Delhi and 
Washington at present, nor does it believe it is possible for 
the United States to overcome its weakness for Pakistan. For 
these reasons, Stephen Solarz is not willing to become the U.S. 
ambassador to India. An intelligent man like Solarz could not 
fail to realize that he will become powerless once he arrives in 
New Delhi. Although a marked improvement in political relations 
between the two countries would be difficult, it is possible to 
increase U.S. economic assistance to India. It is not difficult 
to realize that this is needed. Despite his apparent 
reluctance, Prime Minister Rao is eager to visit the United 
States. Rao and his advisers are encouraged by the success of 
his recent trip to Britain. They believe that India will be 
able to secure a lot of facilities from the United States if Rao 
is able to hold direct talks with President Clinton. It is 
unwise to think that India will be able to get additional 
benefits from the United States even if it does not respond to 
the U.S. Government's nuclear program for South Asia. Definite 
hints in this regard may be given during Strobe Talbott's visit. 
It would be wrong to think that Robin Raphel left a lot behind 
for India apart from her mouthful of laughter. It is necessary 
to see and observe what she says in Pakistan after she leaves 
India.

  [Text] The supply of F-16 fighter aircraft to Pakistan will 
bring about a qualitative change in the strength of the Pakistan 
Air Force. The Pakistan Air Force presently has 37 F-16's and 
it is said that a similar number of additional F-16's will be 
supplied to Pakistan. Pakistan is demanding 71 such aircraft 
for which it has paid $660 million in advance; it is highly 
possible that the United States will fulfill this demand by 
first supplying 38 F-16's and then another batch of 31 at a 
later stage. 
  This decision by the United States will provide a great 
setback to its nuclear nonproliferation targets. India could 
decide to massively deploy Prithvi and Agni missiles in response 
to the new consignment of F-16's to Pakistan. India only has 
started deploying Prithvi surface-to-surface missiles with a 
range of 250 km and out of respect for international concerns, 
no decision has been made about the deployment of Agni 
surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 2,500 km. The plan 
was to test three types of Agni missile and only a political 
decision regarding their deployment needs to be made after 
successful tests. Now that Pakistan is acquiring F-16's, which 
are capable of carrying nuclear weapons, India will be forced to 
give up its hesitations regarding the deployment of long-range 
missiles. In response, Pakistan too will deploy M-11 missiles 
in much greater number with the help of China. A single step by 
the United States will start an unprecedented arms race in South 
Asia, which it will not be able to stop. In the end, this arms 
race could prove fatal for the United States' own interests. 
  The statements issued recently by various level officials of 
the U.S. Administration's Departments of State and Defense make 
it clear that the United States is prepared to supply F-16's to 
Pakistan. Robin Raphel, U.S. assistant secretary of state for 
South Asia, during her current Indian visit is full of flattery 
while talking about relations with India, but she has not given 
any assurance on retracting the U.S. step of supplying F-16's to 
Pakistan which has adversely affected the Indian security 
environment. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's 
comments to the U.S. Senate on 24 March makes it clear that the 
United States wants to give F-16's to Pakistan. Talbott, when 
he visits India on 6 April, will add insult to injury by asking 
India to cap its nuclear program because he is seeking a similar 
assurance from Pakistan. 
  The logic for giving F-16's to Pakistan at this time is that 
the United States will ask Pakistan to accept conditions in 
return for the F-16's. These conditions will lead to a freeze 
of its nuclear program at the present level, or in the American 
terminology, to cap its nuclear program. The capping of 
Pakistan's nuclear program will mean that it can maintain its 
current nuclear capability, but it cannot further enhance it. 
  At the beginning of the last decade the United States gave 
F-16's to Pakistan on the pretext of saving it from Soviet 
attacks from Afghanistan. Following India's protests, the 
United States argued that Pakistan is being supplied such 
conventional arms to make it feel secure and it then refrains 
from making nuclear weapons. It is interesting that Pakistan 
then not only acquired F-16's but continued its nuclear program 
as well. What guarantee is there now that Pakistan will cap its 
nuclear program forever in accordance with the pledge that it 
will make to the United States?

  [Text] An official spokesman in New Delhi today denied 
reports appearing in a section of the press that the Indian 
security agencies have sought an assurance from the LTTE 
[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] regarding the prime 
minister's security during his recent visit to Britain. He 
termed the reports as mischievous and baseless. The spokesman 
said there is absolutely no basis for reports of an alleged deal 
between the LTTE and the government in this regard. He said 
there is no question of lifting the ban on the LTTE imposed two 
years ago under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.

  [Text] Athens, April 1, IRNA -- The Islamic Salvation Front 
(FIS) said the military-backed regime in Algeria has intensified 
its terror campaign against the people and warned that the 
country is slipping towards a civil war. 
  A FIS statement, faxed to IRNA from Germany Friday, referred 
to the recent announcement by Algerian authorities to form armed 
militias to fight Islamic groups and said the regime "is now 
taking refuge in widespread terrorist and illegal acts." 
  The statement noted that youth between 14 to 25 years of age 
were being killed and their bodies thrown on the streets "in 
order to create fear among the people so that they may accept 
the rule of the minority." 
  257 civilians were murdered by the regime only in three 
Algerian cities in the last few days, said FIS, also blaming the 
regime for attacks against women. 
  "Our sister believers should know that all calls for attacks 
against women stem from this deviated group which is thirsty for 
the blood of the innocent men and women," said the statement in 
Arabic. 
  Unidentified gunmen shot and killed two schoolgirls near 
Algiers Tuesday. FIS said the aim of the attacks "is to lead 
the country into a civil war as soon as possible," and called on 
all Algerians regardless of their views and positions to make a 
united stand and foil the plots of the "enemies of Islam both 
inside and outside Algeria." 
  The Algerian regime cancelled elections, banned FIS and 
imprisoned its leaders after its sweeping victory in general 
elections in the country two years ago. 
  FIS and other Islamic groups, which enjoy popular support, 
are struggling to create an Islamic state in Algeria.

that in their meeting this morning, Prime Minister Rabin 
promised them not to evacuate Jews from Hebron, not to change 
the location of the Jewish neighborhoods in the town, and that 
all the settlements in the Gaza Strip, including Dugit, 
Netzarim, and Kfar Darom will remain where they are at least 
until the final settlement is implemented. 
  The settlement leaders also told our correspondent Gil 
Litman 
that the prime minister confirmed in the meeting that there has 
been a significant rise in the number of stone-throwing and 
firebomb incidents in Judaea and Samaria in recent weeks. Rabin 
told them he believes there are now five times more incidents 
than there were in the past. Mr. Rabin promised the settlement 
leaders that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] would step up its 
activities against those who disturb the peace in the 
territories. Those attending the meeting were Uri Ari'el, 
secretary of the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, 
Samaria, and the Gaza Strip; Rabbi Yo'el Bin-Nun of 'Ofra, and 
Tzvi Hendel, head of the Hof 'Aza Regional Council.

Israel has agreed to the Palestinian demand for international 
observers in Hebron, the Jewish settlers in the town must not be 
evacuated. In an interview with reporter Dick Winter, he called 
the agreement a victory for the Palestinians: 
  [Begin Shetrit recording] I hope that the fact that there 
are international observers, that all those who suggest moving 
out the Jewish residents in Hebron would stop talking about it, 
because you cannot at the same time say that in order to secure 
the security of the Palestinians you need international 
observers and at the same time to say get out all the Jews; 
either way. If they have accepted international observers, you 
assume that they are going to do this service of what is termed 
as protection of the Palestinians, so if was the requirement, we 
cannot agree both to this and to other measures. This is 
enough. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Sakhr Abu-al-'Awn] </F>
  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 3 (AFP) -- 
Israeli troops completed their evacuation of the largest 
military base in Gaza City on Sunday [3 April] after emptying 
its prison, Palestinian officials said. 
  Witnesses said an armoured vehicle and a truck were the last 
equipment driven out of the "Seafront" army camp as Israel and 
the PLO resumed talks in Cairo to try to launch autonomous rule 
in Gaza and Jericho within 10 days. 
  A couple of soldiers however remained in a look-out post and 
border police were on duty outside the base know as "Hof" in 
Hebrew. 
  PLO officials, who refused to be named, said the last 
prisoners in the jail at the camp had been moved to other 
facilities. Until early March 200 men were held at the prison, 
known to Palestinians as "Ansar II". 
  The army first began removing soldiers and materiel from the 
Seafront base in November. 
  The army steadfastly refuses to confirm details of any 
pullout, but the first Palestinian policemen are expected to be 
deployed in the territories during the coming week. 
  Palestinian witnesses also said equipment including an 
electronic gate had been dismantled at the army headquarters 
nearby in the centre of Gaza City. 
  Activity at the sprawling HQ appeared to have been reduced 
to 
a minimum, they said, noting a drastic reduction in the usually 
constant comings and goings. 
  Israeli forces are set to pull back to three core areas on 
the Gaza Strip from where they will maintain security for the 
4,000 Jewish settlers who are set to remain on the strip under 
the September 13 autonomy agreement. 
  In the aftermath of the February 25 Hebron mosque massacre, 
the PLO and Israel have pledged to speed up the implementation 
of Palestinian self-rule. 
  Meanwhile Israeli police also started a pullout from Jericho 
on Sunday, but under a hail of stones from Palestinian youths, 
an AFP correspondent reported. 
  A police spokesman confirmed that equipment had been taken 
out, but said the 18 Israeli policemen and five Palestinian 
employees would remain in place in Jericho for the time being. 
  And as part of the Cairo security accord package under which 
160 lightly-armed foreign observers are to be deployed in 
Hebron, the Israeli military restored Mustafa al-Natshah as 
mayor of Hebron on Sunday, more than 10 years after abolishing 
his role.

  [Excerpts] The government does not plan on giving prior 
warning of any decision to evacuate Jewish settlers from Hebron, 
according to the State Attorney's Office response to a High 
Court of Justice appeal by Uri Karzan, a resident of Tall 
al-Rumaythah. Karzan, who demanded that the security forces be 
ordered to give prior warning of a decision to evacuate Jews, 
withdrew his appeal after being convinced that the government 
does not intend to make such a move in the near future. Yiftah 
El'azar reports: 
  The scenario was probably taken from the settlement leaders' 
threats in the media: Thousands of settlers flowing into Hebron 
preventing the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] from evacuating the 
Jewish settlers. Uri Karzan, a resident of Tall al-Rumaythah, 
appealed to the High Court to give prior warning of any 
evacuation. The state's response indicates that the government 
is worried that the above scenario could turn into reality. An 
early warning, the State Attorney's Office said, might foil the 
implementation of the government's decision. Although the 
government did not accept Karzan's demand for an early warning, 
Attorney Elyaqim Ha'etzni withdrew the appeal. [passage omitted] 
  Karzel became convinced that the government does not plan to 
transfer the Hebron settlers at this stage. The state attorney 
said so in the response to the appeal. The government added in 
more legal terms: There is no reason why Karzal cannot appeal 
to the High Court after a decision on evacuation is made and he 
should not try to put the cart before the horse. The High 
Court, however, gave Karzel the right to appeal later on.

  [Excerpt] Last night the residents of the Dugit settlement 
in the northern Gaza Strip abandoned their settlement and set up 
an encampment on the Israeli side of the border. The encampment 
was a protest against what they termed a deterioration in the 
state of security. 
  "We do not intend to return to Dugit any more. We fear for 
our lives. If they cannot protect us, they should compensate us 
and let us leave," two settlers, Tova Goren and Orit Qariti, 
said last night. 
  The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the police placed guards 
at the encampment and declared the new settlement a closed 
military zone, permitting the settlers to stay on the site till 
morning. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Syrian Army handed over 11 Hizballah fighters 
to the Lebanese Army last night. They had been arrested about 
three weeks ago in the course of a violent demonstration to mark 
Jerusalem Day held in Ba'labakk, an area under Syrian control in 
Lebanon. 
  Uri Lubrani, coordinator of government activities in 
Lebanon, 
told our correspondent Yoram Kohen that as far as is known this 
is the first time such an event has occurred. If it is true, 
Lubrani added, this is a step in the right direction aimed at 
curbing terror in Lebanon.

  [Text] A Fatah member from Khan Yunus was killed this 
evening as he was assembling a bomb in the Khan Yunus refugee 
camp. The victim is Khalid Halabi, who spent eight years in an 
Israeli prison because of his Fatah membership. His body was 
snatched away from the hospital. 
  Our correspondent Shlomi Eldar adds that shots were fired 
this evening at an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] lookout position 
in al-Shaykh Radwan. Nobody was hurt. The Fatah Hawks claimed 
responsibility for this attempted terrorist attack. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1900 GMT on 2 April 
adds: "An Israeli was lightly injured in the head this evening 
when his car came under a hail of stones in the village of 
al-Jib south of Ramallah. Two border policemen were injured: 
one in Qalqilyah and another in Gaza. 
  ["Riots erupted this evening in the al-Burayj refugee camp. 
In Gaza, an explosive charge was thrown at a police station. 
The charge exploded, but nobody was hurt and no damage was 
caused. 
  ["A firebomb was thrown this evening at an Israeli car in 
the 
'Aqabat Jabr refugee camp on the outskirts of Jericho. Nobody 
was hurt and no damage was caused. The driver reported the 
incident and drove away. An IDF unit arrived on the scene and 
found the firebomb's remnants as well as empty cartridges. 
Shortly afterward, an Arab suffering serious wounds arrived in 
a hospital in the area. The security forces are checking whether 
the man was the one who threw the firebomb and was wounded by 
shots fired by passengers aboard the Israeli car."]

<F P=106> [Report by David Regev] </F>
  [Text] IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops in the Gaza 
Strip have received new orders: They are to enter refugee camps 
as rarely as possible, to avoid altogether entering city centers 
locations rife with friction, and to do their best not to harm 
Palestinians. 
  A senior Gaza Strip officer said yesterday that the troops 
have been instructed to intensify their patrols on the Gaza 
bypass road and the road to the Qatif Bloc, in order to prevent 
terrorist attacks. "This is the period that precedes our 
departure," the officer explained, "and it is a sensitive 
period." 
  The officer revealed that the evacuation of equipment and 
buildings from the Strip would start in the coming days. "Bases 
and buildings will not be handed over to the Palestinians, 
except for a few buildings that will be used by their police 
force. A special committee will coordinate the transfer of 
buildings." 
  This is how the evacuation will be carried out: First the 
IDF will pull out of areas controlled by Fatah, namely the PLO, 
and the areas will come under Palestinian command. This process 
will continue until only the "hottest" locations, such as the 
Jabalyah refugee camp, remain under IDF control. The latter 
will be evacuated after Fatah is firmly established in most of 
the Gaza Strip. The first sites to be evacuated will be 
evidently Rafah and Dayr al-Balah in southern Strip.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Tzvi Bar'el: "Shattering Every Myth"] </F>
  [Text] There are three ways in which U.S. national 
security advisers can influence the state of affairs. One, to 
set up a subversive body inside the administration that will 
secretly carry out a policy the administration publicly opposes, 
as John Poindexter did in the Irangate affair under President 
Reagan. Second, to have frightful rows with the secretary of 
state, as Zbigniew Brzezinski did with Cyrus Vance, and the 
third, to write articles in the daily or professional press, 
hoping the White House will read them more earnestly than 
internal memorandums. 
  Anthony Lake, President Clinton's new national security 
adviser, chose the third way. In an article published in 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS magazine, he proposes -- as a sequel to his 
assistant Martin Indyk's article -- a dual containment policy. 
In practical terms, this policy means that instead of pitting 
Iran against Iraq and vice versa, a pro-Western alliance would 
be formed, comprising Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel, and 
possibly Syria, too. The alliance would be a security belt 
against the influence of reactionary countries. 
  The unveiling of the new strategy causes concern. The 
strategy is slightly reminiscent of Reagan's caricature world 
map. In that map, the world was divided into four parts: the 
Soviet Union and the Evil Empire; Europeans and those who do not 
speak our language; we, the Americans, who are the greatest; and 
an empty area comprised mostly of Africa. The world is simple. 
We will curb and eradicate the evil nations and pay off the 
good ones. This is what Lake is also proposing. Except that 
his plan, which looks enticing on paper, is potentially as 
dangerous as a telephone diagnosis. The United States has never 
clearly defined the term reactionary country. Is Saudi Arabia, 
which cuts off thieves' hands, reactionary, or is it perhaps a 
progressive state because it takes pains to restrain elements 
more reactionary than herself? Is Turkey a progressive state 
only because it is a NATO member, or is it backward because it 
has been massacring the Kurdish minority? 
  Another vague definition pertains to the term alliance. Does 
Lake envision a NATO-like alliance in the Middle East, in which 
Turkey is member but Iran is not, although the two share the 
same interest in restraining the Kurds and both have announced 
their objection to carving up Iraq? If Lake hopes that such an 
alliance will offset the Hizballah control of Lebanon, what will 
block radical Islam in Egypt, Algeria, and Sudan? And what is 
Israel's contribution to the war against the Islam? An even 
greater danger is the possibility that establishing one 
pro-Western pact will immediately generate another composed of 
Iran and Iraq, Libya and India, Afghanistan and the rich Islamic 
central-Asian states of Indonesia an Malaysia. The latter 
alliance may engage the endorsement of China and perhaps the 
support of Japan, currently in a tacit economic war with the 
United States. 
  What price is the United States ready to pay today for 
preventing the creation of such an alliance? Is the blocking of 
Hizballah worth the loss of thousands of American jobs resulting 
from the counter-alliance's decision to boycott one single 
American product? The national security adviser would have done 
well to look up the origin of the term containment, which was 
invented by George Keenan, who was the U.S. ambassador to the 
Soviet Union 45 years ago. Writing in -- what a surprise -- 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS -- in 1947, he suggested applying a containment 
policy to Stalin's USSR, but in his memoirs written twenty years 
later, he warned that the containment policy should not 
constitute a sequel to the status quo, but rather be a bridging 
policy toward an era in which the United States and the USSR 
would be able to hold an effective dialogue on how to avoid the 
perils of status quo. "And if the plan fails," Keenan wrote, 
"it will happen because of our government's inability to spot 
the emerging opportunities to establish an effective political 
dialogue, and because of its excessive preoccupation with the 
military aspects of the conflict." 
  The Arab alliance that will constitute the double 
containment 
proposed by Lake is none other but a semantic description of the 
current status quo. Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, and 
certainly Israel are considered pro-American countries. Iraq is 
sealed off by an international embargo anyway, and Iran is 
already subject to every possible American sanction, excluding a 
military attack. What additional containment can the United 
States expect? Some observers believe there is even now an 
opportunity to move on to the post-containment stage, to a slow 
resumption of relations with Iran and the gradual lifting of 
sanctions on Iraq. 
  There are indications that at least Iran is interested in 
resuming the ties with the United States, provided the latter 
stops meddling in its domestic affairs. Would it not be better 
if the national security adviser stopped defining existing 
situations and instead, probed the situation to verify that the 
United States was not missing another opportunity?

<F P=106> [Report by media affairs correspondent 'Irit Rosenblum] </F>
  [Text] A poll conducted by the New Channel 2 Television 
Network shows that 50.3 percent of the public are generally 
satisfied with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin while 49.7 percent 
are dissatisfied. The number of interviewees completely 
dissatisfied with the prime minister is almost double those who 
think Rabin's performance is very good -- 26.2 percent compared 
with 14.3 percent. 
  The questions which asked were: 1. Are you satisfied or 
dissatisfied with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin? What grade 
would you give Rabin as prime minister? (very good, quite good, 
not so good, bad). 
  2. What grade would you give the prime minister for his 
handling of each of the following issues: advancing peace and 
the negotiations with the Arabs; foreign and defense policy; 
the economy; social welfare. (very good, quite good, not so 
good, bad). 
  The prime minister received a "very good" grade from 14.3 
percent of the interviewees, "quite good" from 32.7 percent, 
"not so good" from 20.3 percent, "bad" from 26.2 percent. Some 
6.5 percent did not have any opinion. 
  A total of all those with good opinions about Rabin's 
performance reached 50.3 percent while a total of those with 
negative opinions was 49.7 percent. On the issue of advancing 
peace and negotiations with the Arabs, 46.6 percent expressed 
satisfaction and 53.4 percent had a negative stand. On foreign 
and defense policy, 52.6 percent supported his actions and 47.4 
percent rejected them. On economic issues: 49.7 percent had 
positive thoughts while 50.3 percent expressed negative views. 
On social welfare issues: 47.6 percent gave the prime minister 
positive grades while 52.4 percent gave him negative grades. 
These data show that overall satisfaction with the prime 
minister is higher than when his performance is divided up into 
specific areas. 
  The poll also studied the interviewees according to changing 
variants. Among the women, 48.1 percent had positive views on 
Rabin and 51.9 percent had negative views. Among the men, 52.7 
percent had positive opinions and 47.3 percent had negative 
views. Among young people, Rabin supporters numbered 42.9 
percent and those who rejected him 57.1 percent; among middle 
aged people, 51.8 percent supported him and 88.2 percent opposed 
him; Rabin had most support among the elderly, 56.3 percent, 
compared with 43.7 percent who oppose him. That means that 
women and young people are more critical of Rabin than middle 
aged and elderly men. 
  Support for Rabin was also divided up according to 
geographic 
areas. Most of the support came from the north (Haifa, 
kibbutzim, Arab areas) where the rate of support was 60.4 
percent and the opposition is 39.6 percent. In the center of 
the country, 52.8 percent supported Rabin, compared to 47.2 
percent who did not; and in the south it was the opposite, 47.2 
percent supported him compared to 52.8 percent who did not. 
Jerusalem is opposed to Rabin, according to the survey: 64.3 
percent are dissatisfied compared to 35.7 percent who are 
satisfied (the poll apparently did not include East Jerusalem 
residents). 
  The poll encompassed a representative sample of 1,006 
people, 
men and women from the age of 18. It was held in the second 
half of May 1994 through telephone interviews from the Teleseqer 
Institute in Ramat Gan. The margin of statistical error can 
reach 3 percent.

  [Text] Prosecutor General Magistrate Munif 'Uwaydat met 
with Judge Joseph Furayhah, judicial investigator into the 
Sayyidat al-Najat church at the Palace of Justice this morning. 
Furayhah briefed 'Uwaydat on the investigation process of the 
bombing of the church in Zuq Mikha'il. 
  After the meeting, Judge 'Uwaydat made a statement in which 
he denied a report published by the newspaper AL-DIYAR yesterday 
that he had exonerated the Lebanese Forces as an establishment 
of the charge of bombing the Sayyidat al-Najat church. He said 
the aforesaid newspaper's headlines differ from the article's 
text. He noted that what he really had said was that a judicial 
finding can only be decided on after completion of an 
investigation and will be declared subsequently in an 
indictment. He said that this rule pertains to the judicial 
procedure mechanism and does not mean anyone has been cleared, 
as the paper incorrectly concluded. 
  He regretted the use of his statement for narrow-minded 
political purposes and as a pretext for a defense in the media 
aimed at detouring the investigations from their natural course. 
He noted that we need to continue the investigations in an 
objective atmosphere and in strict secrecy free from distortions 
of facts.

  [Excerpt] Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah has 
said that the government has silenced national and Islamic 
media, which support security measures and peace. He urged the 
government to rescind its decision immediately. 
  Nasrallah was addressing a memorial for Hajj 'Abdallah 
Mi'mah 
in Al-Laylaki Mosque yesterday. The service was attended by 
'Ammar al- Musawi, Hizballah deputy Political Bureau chairman; 
Deputies Muhammad Ra'd, Muhammad Funaysh, and 'Ali 'Ammar; and 
some ulema. Nasrallah said: Government officials have 
repeatedly sought to oppress the media. We even hear dissonant 
voices today calling for additional controls on the printed 
media, which thought the publication law protected them from 
oppression. These voices are also demanding control over 
printing houses. 
  He added: People in Lebanon feel annoyed and suffocated by 
this. The government was not wise in making this decision. 
Indeed, it was opportunistic because it used the political and 
security situation to pass the plan. Like all forces, trends, 
and all the Lebanese people, we call on the political authority 
to rescind this unfair and terrorist measure and to promptly 
pass the media law. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri received in 
Beirut today, Majid 'Izzu Ruhaybani, the Syrian minister of 
reconstruction and building, and his delegation who arrived in 
Beirut this morning. 
  Talks centered on bilateral relations, historical links, and 
existing ties between the two countries and ways to bolster them 
to realize joint aims and interests. 
  In a statement to reporters, the minister emphasized 
continued Syrian support of Lebanon's march to entrench its 
national unity, rebuild it, and support its struggle to liberate 
its occupied territory. 
  The minister said: At President Hafiz al-Asad's 
instructions, Syria is always prepared--prompted by its 
brotherly feelings--to implement any projects by Syrian general 
construction companies if Lebanon needs them. Ruhaybani alluded 
to schools constructed in southern Lebanon by Syrian companies 
in cooperation with the higher committee in support of the 
south. He said: We are prepared to contribute to reconstructing 
Lebanon within the framework of the close brotherly cooperation 
between the two countries. 
  This afternoon, Ruhaybani and his delegation held meetings 
with Dr. Hasan Yusuf, head of the council of the south, and the 
council's members. They discussed joint work to implement 
services projects being implemented in southern Lebanon by joint 
financing of the Syrian committee of solidarity with the people 
of the south and by the council of the south. Discussion also 
dealt with aspects of future cooperation and ways to support the 
people of southern Lebanon and western al-Biqa' to confront the 
repeated and bestial Israeli attacks. 
  Dr. Hasan Yusuf, chairman of the council of the south, 
praised Syria's continuous assistance to the people of the 
south, under President Hafiz al-Asad, to ensure the means of 
their steadfastness in the face of the Israeli occupation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri by Artur K. </F>
Vogel; place and date not given: "Uncertainty After the Civil 
War"] 
  [Text] [Vogel] The differences between the rich and the 
poor are crass and seem to have increased. 
  [Al-Hariri] In Lebanon there was a broad middle-class, which 
largely disappeared because of the war. Now it is recovering, 
but this will take some years. Reconstruction has begun: You 
see everywhere many projects and many building sites. The hope 
in financial circles is that the country will really take off. 
Many Lebanese are coming back and investing here. 
  [Vogel] Several hundreds of thousands of expellees are also 
waiting for help; they do not notice any reconstruction. 
  [Al-Hariri] My government is the first that is seriously 
taking care of them. We took thousands of families back to 
their places of origin. Now a bill that is to enable the 
government to spend $436 million on this has been presented in 
parliament. If the bill goes through, the problem might be 
solved in a few years. 
  [Vogel] However, many refugees do not have much confidence 
in your government. They are saying that you are not concerned 
about the common people. 
  [Al-Hariri] I cannot blame them. They are right if they 
feel ill at ease, but they are not right if they think that we 
do not take care of them. 
  [Vogel] To put it mildly, unease can also be felt among the 
Christians. On 27 February, 10 men were killed and 60 injured 
by a bomb attack in the Maronite-Catholic Church of Suk Mikhail 
near Junieh. When you visited the site, you talked of the 
involvement of foreign powers, in order to divert international 
attention from the Hebron massacre (two days before). Your 
information minister even accused Israel directly. Are you 
sticking to this theory? 
  [Al-Hariri] Even during the war -- it was a religious war -- 
nobody dared to attack a mosque or a church. The attack was an 
event that is far from the habits of the Lebanese. They were 
cruel, but they never did such a thing. 
  [Vogel] Meanwhile, 127 people have been arrested. Does this 
not point to local perpetrators? 
  [Al-Hariri] If a crime is committed and the police do not 
have any direct clues, they examine the suspects. Most were 
released after a few hours. 
  [Vogel] You said yourself that certain forces still want to 
destroy Lebanon's fragile unity. What would be their motivation? 
  [Al-Hariri] After a civil war, there is always uncertainty 
for a few years. There are people who want to overthrow the 
government in order to get into power themselves. 
  [Vogel] That is to say, are you as a Sunni Muslim denying 
that the center of power in Lebanon is moving too far toward the 
Muslims and away from the Christians, as many Christians are 
claiming? 
  [Al-Hariri] We are not trying to deprive the Christians of 
their power; we are trying to create a balance of power. 
  [Vogel] You have another problem: Israel continues to 
occupy 10 percent of your country. 
  [Al-Hariri] We are negotiating with the Israelis on their 
withdrawal. We are prepared to guarantee security at their 
border. It is for the Israelis to decide whether they want to be 
part of the Middle East or to dominate it. If they want to 
dominate, there will be no peace. 
  [Vogel] Among other things, Israel is calling for the 
disarmament of the Hizballah militias. 
  [Al-Hariri] The Israeli occupation is creating resistance. 
If Israel wants to withdraw from Lebanon, the Lebanese 
Government would be responsible for nobody trying any longer to 
disturb the peace. But as long as the occupation continues, I 
cannot keep the Lebanese from putting up resistance.

  [Text] Maronite Patriarch Mar Nasrallah Butrus Sfayr stated 
that the Christians' abstention from taking part in the state's 
activities is due to the imbalance in the distribution of roles 
following the settlement accord that put an end to the war. He 
pointed out that the state has not treated everyone equally and 
has failed to make Christians feel that it cares about them as 
much as other citizens. 
  He noted that except for faith in God, freedom is Lebanon's 
one and only asset. He pointed out that all complaints reflect 
violations of the principle of national accord. 
  Patriarch Sfayr's remarks came in his Easter message to the 
Lebanese today.

  [Text] Following his meeting with Maronite Patriarch Mar 
Nasrallah Butrus Sfayr in Bkirki yesterday, Minister of State 
Jean 'Ubayd spoke about three issues. The first of these deals 
with the Christian representation [in state institutions]. He 
stressed that there is such representation, as reflected in the 
presence of the Franjiyah, Mu'awwad, and Buwayz families. No 
one can dispute their patriotism and nationalism, he stressed. 
  As for the Christian figures living abroad, Minister 'Ubayd 
said that Raymond Iddih himself chose to leave and so did 
General Michel 'Awn and former President al-Jumayyil. Gen. 'Awn 
can return at any time but must do so in accordance with the 
law, 'Ubayd added. 
  Concerning the third issue, Minister 'Ubayd said: I am 
against a Muslim state or a Christian state.

  [Excerpts] Brother leader Major al-Khuwayldi al-Humaydi 
delivered a speech at the opening of the sixth council session 
of the Arab Maghreban Union [AMU]. [passage omitted] In his 
address, Major al-Khuwayldi al-Humaydi warned against the 
dangers posed by challenges confronting the Arab nation, 
indicating that they formed an obstacle toward achieving any 
Arab integration, prosperity and progress. [passage omitted] 
  He added that one of the most prominent challenges facing us 
and which the enemies are using to impede our unity and to 
destroy our basic principles with deep-rooted crusade-like 
rancor is the crisis fabricated more than two years ago by 
Western states against the Great Jamahiriyah. The Western 
states insist on continuing to use the so-called Security 
Council to issue unjust mandatory resolutions which all the 
world -- people and agencies -- have rejected. 
  Major al-Khuwayldi al-Humaydi said that the repeated threat 
by the three Western states and their indifference to all 
initiatives to find a peaceful solution to the crisis required 
collective confrontation in line with the requirements of our 
charters and pacts to prevent those countries from carrying on 
implementing the same method they have been following, and to 
work on lifting the unjust mandatory sanctions imposed on your 
brothers in the Great Jamahiriyah, which have resulted in large 
physical and material losses that have spread to the AMU. 
[passage omitted] 
  Major al-Khuwayldi al-Humaydi said: We announce from this 
podium, full self-confidence, that we are ready to hold direct 
dialogue with Western states, on equal footing, without there 
being room for any terrorism or encroachment. We also announce 
that we are prepared to receive their judges, with grace and 
honor, in line with recognized international rules. 
  Al-Khuwayldi al-Humaidi added: Your brothers in the 
Jamahiriyah expect a decisive solution and practical steps to 
lift injustice from them to emerge from this summit. Any 
position which contradicts that will make Libyans feel the 
futility of this union as being one political entity and will 
leave them with a feeling of deep disppointment. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Tunis, 2 Apr (MENA) -- High-ranking Palestinian 
sources taking part in the autonomy talks have said that the PLO 
has received an Israeli offer to withdraw from Gaza and the 
Jericho area within four days. According to the sources, 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres reiterated this in 
statements to the Israeli television yesterday. 
  The sources add that a number of Palestinian deportees have 
left Tunis for the homeland after Israel has agreed to let 35 
deportees return. 
  Palestinians arriving from the occupied territories have 
said 
that the Israeli Army command plans to organize the process of 
transferring control to the Palestinian national authority 
before withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho and that the Israeli 
Army started to evacuate the camp and withdraw much equipment 
from the Gaza Strip a few days ago. 
  The Palestinian sources note that the occupation army's 
senior officers estimate that the army will be prepared to 
complete its withdrawal within 72 hours of receiving orders to 
withdraw. 
  According to Palestinian sources in Tunis, 300 of the 
Palestine Liberation Army's senior officers will enter Gaza and 
Jericho to take over control once the expected Israeli 
withdrawal is completed.

  [Text] In reply to the statement issued at the end of the 
50th meeting of the foreign ministers of the Persian Gulf 
Cooperation Council [GCC] on the subject of the three Iranian 
Islands, the Foreign Ministry of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
said: This statement repeats the baseless claims of the 
government of United Arab Emirates which bears no fruit but 
causes disunity among the united ranks of Muslims, and Iran 
understands such statements to be contradictory to intentions 
that are based on goodneighborly relations in the region, and 
they are another step towards meeting the interest the foreign 
powers in the sensitive and strategic region of Persian Gulf. 
  The communique states that: The repetition of such futile 
claims will not change whatsoever the fact that the three 
islands belong to Iran. 
  In the communique, the Foreign Ministry stressed: Iran 
continues to take the initiative in direct talks with the 
Emirates and continues to ask this country -- rather than 
resorting to a commotion that will have no result, let alone 
that will cause greater complexity and will aggravate the 
difficulties -- to prove its good will in bilateral talks 
towards the clarification of any form of misunderstanding in the 
form of the letter by Shaykh Zayid, the head of United Arab 
Emirates to the president of Iran. 
  Also, regarding the issue of hajj, in the communique the 
Foreign Ministry stressed the freedom of the press in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and regretted the inability of the 
Council's statement to appreciate this fact -- and called on 
Saudi Arabia to respect and implement the agreement between the 
foreign ministers of the two countries regarding the number of 
pilgrims and the administration the Disavowal of Infidels 
Ceremonies, and that since the agreement was reached after the 
meeting of foreign ministers of Islamic countries in Amman, it 
called on Saudi officials to act towards better administration 
of this important divine duty, instead of breaching promises and 
creating difficulties in the execution of this Muslim's 
pilgrimage.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al- Sahhaf </F>
by Safa' Hijazi in Cairo, date not given; from the "Arabs' Home" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Hijazi] Your Excellency Iraqi Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, Iraq recently announced it might 
reconsider its stand on Kuwait if the air blockade of Iraq is 
lifted. What is your comment? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] As you know, Iraq has sent the Security Council 
a 
letter signed by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz. The letter 
factually explains Iraq's implementation of the measures 
required of it in accordance with Resolution 687. The letter 
asks the Security Council to implement Paragraph 22 because the 
Security Council is responsible for its implementation. The 
Security Council is committed to implementing this paragraph 
after Iraq implements what is required of it. Paragraph 22 
calls for lifting the economic blockade of Iraq. However, if 
there are pressures on the Security Council and Iraq implements 
its commitments but the Security Council does not implement its 
commitments, it is the right of Iraq and the Iraqi people to 
take measures that keep them alive and ensure their future. 
  [Hijazi] Regarding the stand on Kuwait, what is meant by 
this 
stand on Kuwait? Is it the border or the issue of the prisoners? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] During contacts between Iraq and a number of 
governments that are members of the Security Council, the 
representatives of these governments raised the subject of 
Kuwait with the Iraqi delegations. Iraq's answer was and still 
is based on the paragraphs of the UN Security Council 
resolution. In other words, this subject is not connected with 
the economic blockade. Paragraph 22 says that if Iraq implements 
certain paragraphs dealing with weapons of mass destruction, the 
Security Council will implement Paragraph 22 and lift the 
embargo on Iraqi exports. The subject of Kuwait has no 
connection with this paragraph. If the Security Council member 
states want to talk about this subject, Iraq believes that 
movement toward implementation of Paragraph 22 should not stop. 
If Paragraph 22 is implemented and the economic blockade of 
Iraq is lifted, then a positive atmosphere will be created that 
will help talks to take place on this subject. Iraq has 
expressed its readiness to begin discussions with the Security 
Council on this subject. 
  [Hijazi] The Arab League secretary general has sent two 
envoys to the Iraqi Government on the subject of Kuwaiti 
prisoners. Recently, it was reported that if Kuwaiti authorities 
release the defendants in the attempt to assassinate former U.S. 
President Bush, then Iraq will reconsider the subject of 
prisoners, in the sense that Iraq has some prisoners. 
  [Al-Sahhaf] First of all, this issue is completely 
groundless. It is a fabrication. The secretary general sent 
three envoys: 'Abdallah Adam, Rashid Idris, and Mayhub 
al-Bayhubi. The three envoys came to Baghdad in the past two 
years only as part of an attempt or an initiative by Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al- Majid to help resolve this problem, 
which he describes as hurting the general atmosphere. We 
reiterated to all three envoys--as we explained to the Security 
Council and the International Committee of the Red Cross 
ICRC--that there are no prisoners or detainees in Iraq at all. 
This issue concerns missing people. We are ready to cooperate 
with all parties to probe and investigate to discover the fate 
of these missing people. Iraq received the files on 625 missing 
people. We have formed special committees that are searching 
for and gathering information on these missing people. We are 
ready to share any information we gather on any individual whose 
name is mentioned and who has a file, with the ICRC and the Arab 
League secretary. And, as I said in the news conference, we are 
prepared to cooperate with the Gulf states on this subject.

  [Text] The Syrian Foreign Ministry has stated the following: 
  For many years, the Syrian authorities, in cooperation with 
the Lebanese authorities, have been exerting themselves to 
combat the growing of poppies and other narcotics, especially in 
the al-Biqa' region, long known for producing such crops. 
  We can state, on the strength of the information available 
to 
us, that these efforts have succeeded in putting an end to the 
cultivation of these illegal plants, despite the extreme 
difficulties involved in combating them, curbing their 
processing, and banning trade in them. 
  Syria is known to have passed strict anti-drug legislation 
and taken severe disciplinary measures against drug growers, 
manufacturers, smugglers, and traffickers. Syria ranks among 
the countries with the cleanest record in this area. 
Furthermore, the values and traditions of the Syrian Arab 
society in themselves constitute a natural immunity against this 
blight. 
  Syria's efforts in the area of fighting drugs have earned 
the 
satisfaction of the United Nations and the regional committee 
for the fight against drugs, which chose Damascus as the venue 
for its 30th congress in February, 1994. The committee's 
representative judged Syria's anti-drug drive to be commendable. 
  For all the above reasons, and despite the fact that the 
competent agency at the U.S. State Department recommended that 
Syria be removed from the list of nations charged with failing 
to combat drug abuse -- to cite an article published in the 21 
March issue of THE WASHINGTON POST -- certain members of the 
U.S. Administration, many of whose stands have hindered rather 
than facilitated the peace process, have deliberately ignored 
these recommendations, and insisted on keeping Syria on the 
list, despite all the realities and facts that prove Syria's 
fight against drugs. 
  It is now clear beyond a shadow of doubt that the aim of 
placing Syria on the drug or terrorism list is to pressure Syria 
into relinquishing its stands and just causes, acknowledged by 
the international community and endorsed by UN resolutions, 
envisaging a just and comprehensive peace in the region. 
  Syria's stands and just causes cannot be bargained over. 
Syria's efforts and measures in the anti-drug campaign 
originate in a conviction in the need to wipe out the risks 
inherent in this scourge and its devastating impact on 
individuals and societies in this region and elsewhere. 
  Syria is not looking for a reward from anyone for its 
antidrug and antiterror efforts. Syria would not have issued 
this statement if it were not for the attempts of certain 
circles in the United States to misrepresent facts and falsify 
records to advance political pressure that will only shake the 
confidence of the region in the role of the United States as an 
honest broker in the peace process.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali </F>
by Sa'd al-Silawi in Amman -- date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Silawi] What does Jordan's 
decision to link its participation in the negotiations to the 
halting of inspections at the al-'Aqabah Port mean? 
  [Al-Majali] For over three years, the al-'Aqabah Port has 
been subjected to inspections. Jordan has been under siege. 
From time to time, there is a noticeable increase in the 
pressure being applied against Jordan. This has had a severe 
effect on the economic situation in the country. Unable to 
reach Jordan because of the harassments that take place, a large 
number of shipping companies stopped dealing with Jordan. 
Besides, the conditions that have been set regarding the 
arrangement of shipped cargoes and their quantities have led to 
an increase in insurance premiums, fees, and the cost of living 
in Jordan. Some cargoes have even been lost or unloaded at 
other ports. Their owners could not find them. All this has 
led to an inconvenient situation. In addition, we are suffering 
from a major restraint imposed on exports to Iraq, especially 
basic supplies. Of course, food and medicine are allowed, but 
there are complications. Other human supplies also face many 
complications. This has affected the Jordanian economy, which 
has for a long time been built on the basis that it is a main 
exporter to Iraq. When the Gulf war broke out, the blockade 
started. The Jordanian economy has been negatively affected. 
Under these circumstances and the extremely negative effect on 
the Jordanian economy, how can we go and negotiate within the 
peace process? The negotiator must feel comfortable and must 
have the feeling that peace brings benefits to everyone. 
Moreover, we have the feeling that many parties in Jordan feel 
and explicitly say that all these measures are aimed at twisting 
Jordan's arm and forcing it into a certain course of 
negotiations. We want this matter resolved, especially since 
all the inspections have not spotted a single violation. 
  [Al-Silawi] Mr. Prime Minister, has the decision been 
coordinated with the other Arab parties to the peace conference? 
  [Al-Majali] Among other states, Jordan is the only state 
that 
has been subjected to a blockade. Our's is a Jordanian 
decision. But the brothers have been in the picture. They have 
found this to be one of Jordan's rights. 
  [Al-Silawi] Therefore, the decision was made through 
coordination with the brothers in Syria, Egypt, and the PLO? 
  [Al-Majali] I cannot say so. But in view of our constant 
coordination, our brothers in Syria have been contacted. 
  [Al-Silawi] The United States says that there are 
discussions 
and proposals concerning ship inspections. What are these 
proposals? Will the Jordanian Government respond to them? 
  [Al-Majali] First, I would like to emphasize that we hide 
nothing. We are a committed and credible state. When we say 
that we import nothing that violates the UN resolutions, we mean 
that. But they insist on inspection. Therefore, we proposed 
several verification methods, including the hiring of an 
international firm, such as Lloyds Register, so that it would 
send representatives to al-'Aqabah, where they can monitor 
traffic and send their observations and reports to the United 
Nations directly. This proposal was made three months ago. As 
we understood, those concerned have approved the proposal. But 
so far, nothing has happened. On the contrary, strangely 
enough, the number of ships that have been inspected or 
intercepted this year is nearly equal to the number of all ships 
that have been inspected in the past years. 
  [Al-Silawi] But is there a specific commitment or 
guarantees concerning the international organization's 
resolutions on Iraq? 
  [Al-Majali] Of course, we are committed. We are a UN member 
country. We respect and implement its resolutions. This is a 
moral commitment. The picture should be clear. How can we not 
be committed to an organization in which we are a member? 
  [Al-Silawi] Mr. Prime Minister, can you give us the losses 
in 
figures resulting from the inspection operations? 
  [Al-Majali] These losses range from $300 to $400 million a 
year. Total losses so far have reached $1.3 billion. For the 
Jordanian economy, this is a very sizable loss. 
  [Al-Silawi] Reports in the Israeli press say there is a 
project to widen the Jordan River to benefit from its waters, 
and that Jordanian firms will carry out this operation. Is this 
true? What do you have to say about this? 
  [Al-Majali] I do not have any information on this. This is 
the first time I've heard of such a thing. However, from a 
quick review of the issue, I do not see any justification for 
this. What little what there is in the Jordan River is 
mineralized. The Israeli authorities are pumping this mineral 
water to purify the Tiberias Lake waters. 
  [Al-Silawi] Mr. Prime Minister, as journalists we feel that 
there is a missing link. Sometimes, we cannot understand what 
the government wants. For example, when we speak about the 
issue of Jerusalem, we do not know how to translate the state's 
stand on the Jerusalem issue. What are the terms of reference? 
We understand that only God's authority should prevail at holy 
places. So far, we do not understand what the government wants. 
What are the state's policies on these issues? There is a 
missing link. 
  [Al-Majali] There is no missing link. The problem is that 
journalists do not carry out indepth studies. They do not come 
to us about these issues. But, since you have asked this 
question, I will answer you: When his majesty the king says 
that sovereignty over Jerusalem and the holy places belongs only 
to God, this is clear. He does not say sovereignty belongs to 
him, but to God. The Islamic quarters should meet and study how 
to achieve this, that is, sovereignty is not for Israel, which 
in its religious books and propaganda says Jerusalen belongs to 
it and that it enjoys sovereignty over it. When we say to the 
world at large that sovereignty belongs to God almighty, this is 
to emphasize that sovereignty does not belong to Israel but to 
god, and that we have to sit down and discuss this issue. 
  One other thing we should not forget is that Jerusalem 
falls under the 1947 partition. The city and its environs are 
areas that were given to an international administration that 
did not materialize. Israel occupied the western part. There 
was the Jordanian presence in the eastern part. There were two 
parts. Western policies see it as a unified city. Most 
countries still do not recognize Israel's sovereignty over the 
occupied eastern part of Jerusalem. That's why these countries, 
including the United States, have no embassies there. 
  [Al-Silawi] Jordan has asked for a clarification from the 
United States concerning Resolution 904. Tnis resolution is 
crucial if we realize that the U.S. Congress, which is 
controlled by the Democrats, had in the past asked that 
Jerusalem be the capital of Israel. 
  [Al-Majali] The United States did not recognize Jerusalem as 
Israel's capital. Even so, President Bill Clinton said during 
the election campaign that he would transfer the embassy from 
Tel Aviv to Jerusalem if it did not constitute an obstacle to 
peace. The fact is, this is an obstacle to peace. This is 
something we should know. 
  [Al-Silawi] Mr. Prime Minister, are there Jordanian-U.S. 
contacts on this resolution? 
  [Al-Majali] Contacts on this resolution and others are under 
way. His majesty the king's intervention was very clear that 
the United States should not veto this resolution. This also 
should be taken into consideration. 
  [Al-Silawi] Mr. Prime Minister, this issue might have 
created 
a disagreement between the PLO and Jordan. 
  [Al-Majali] The brothers in the PLO placed the issue of 
Jerusalem in the resolution with good intentions. They believe 
Jerusalem should be Arab. We also believe it should be Arab. 
But, the question is when to raise such an issue and in which 
resolution. This is our viewpoint. It was feared that the 
manner with which it was introduced would lead to removing it. 
Thus, things would become worse, or it would have been vetoed. 
This would have been very bad. The safest and the less damaging 
stand was that the United States abstained on the paragraph on 
Jerusalem. But, the resolution as a whole was adopted by the UN 
Security Council members. The deliberations took place and 
there was success. However, we do not wish to place the issue 
of Jerusalem where it could be affected. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed Editorial: "We Welcome the Russian </F>
Initiative"] 
  [Text] We greatly welcome the visit by Russian President 
Yeltsin's envoy and any step or initiative designed to enhance 
bilateral relations and activate the peace process, especially 
since Russia, along with the United States, is cosponsoring the 
peace process on all tracks. 
  Now that friendly Russia, which is a permanent member of the 
UN Security Council, is eager to activate the peace process, we 
hope it will take into account Jordan's bitter suffering as a 
result of the U.S. siege imposed on al-'Aqabah. This siege has 
inflicted grave losses on the Jordanian economy and trade. 
  Friendly Russia knows better than others the extent of 
Jordan's eagerness to achieve peace, security, and stability in 
this vital region of the world. At the same time, Russia knows 
that Jordan has recently linked the resumption of its role in 
the peace process to addressing this unfair siege. 
  We thus hope that this friendly big power will give serious 
attention to this siege of the port of al-'Aqabah and work to 
lift it. What draws attention is that while President Yeltsin's 
envoy was visiting Jordan, the U.S. forces twice searched a ship 
carrying Jordan-bound merchandise and turned it back to Suez. 
Such a position does not serve the peace process in any way 
whatsoever. 
  Jordan experienced much suffering and many economic and 
trade 
difficulties during the Gulf crisis and the second Gulf war. It 
is still suffering as a result of this siege which is imposed 
unfairly and without any convincing justification. Jordan 
complied with the Security Council resolutions, and the U.S. 
Administration itself acknowledged this compliance. This 
administration, however, insists on harming our national economy. 
  It is known that Jordan is not the only neighbor of Iraq. 
Washington, however, did not impose a similar blockade on Turkey 
and Iran, which are also neighbors of Iraq. At any rate, we 
hope that the guest Russian envoy will brief President Yeltsin 
on Jordan's suffering as a result of the unfair siege in order 
to address this issue. 
  It is inconceivable to activate the peace process in order 
to 
achieve peace, security, and stability in a region where some 
countries are suffering from an unfair siege at the hands of 
peace advocates.

securing peace and stability as well as the solution of the 
country's current difficulties by talks. 
  Mr. Mahmud Mastiri then expressed appreciation for 
statements 
and goodwill displayed by esteemed Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani 
for the solution of issues by talks. Mastiri expressed hope 
that a reliable peace would be restored in Afghanistan as soon 
as possible, that the country's current difficulties would be 
solved by understanding, and that the ground would be prepared 
for the extension of international assistance for the 
reconstruction of Afghanistan and prosperity of the persecuted 
people of Afghanistan. 
  Mr. Mahmud Mastiri at this meeting said that the purpose of 
his visit to Kabul is to help the people of Afghanistan as much 
as possible to restore peace and security and to extend UN 
humanitarian assistance. The special envoy of the UN secretary 
general said that he will use all available possible means so 
that the people of Afghanistan can achieve peace and security. 
The UN will extend every necessary cooperation in this respect. 
At this meeting Mr. Mahmud Mastiri asked that the enforced 
ceasefire be allowed to continue for the progress of affairs and 
peace-seeking efforts. The esteemed president gave a positive 
reply to this request by the UN special envoy and said: We have 
declared a unilateral ceasefire in the past and now we are also 
ready for the continuation of the current enforced ceasefire. 
We want the current difficulties to be resolved so that a 
reliable peace and profound security will be guaranteed in 
Afghanistan. 
  The correspondent of the BIA adds: Mr. Mahmud Mastiri 
arrived in Kabul this morning by a UN special flight. The UN 
delegation was welcomed at Kabul airport by esteemed Najibollah 
Lafra'i, minister of state for foreign affairs; esteemed Abdol 
Aziz Morad, head of the presidential press office; esteemed Dr. 
Abdol Hai Allahi and Hamidullah Tarzi, ministers of state; 
esteemed Sayed Eshaq [surname indistinct], minister of culture 
and information; esteemed Dr. Abdol Rahman; esteemed Fazl Karim 
Aymaq, Kabul mayor; the acting head of protocol of the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs; and a number of other high-ranking state 
officials. 
  Esteemed Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani and Mr. Mahmud 
Mastiri 
then answered questions raised by domestic and foreign 
journalists regarding today's talks: 
  In response to a question, esteemed Professor Borhanodin 
Rabbani said: This was and is the strategy of the Islamic State 
of Afghanistan: to resolve issues by talks and understanding and 
to secure peace. We never support the idea of resolving issues 
by weapons. We are interested in the UN role for the solution 
of the country's difficulties. We are interested in all 
difficulties being resolved by peaceful means. Today's talks 
with the UN envoy were useful. 
  In reply to another question, the esteemed president said: 
We declare that a permanent ceasefire is to be continued in 
Kabul. [Words indistinct] the fighting is to discontinue by the 
(? opposition forces) against the persecuted people of Kabul 
[words indistinct] and the innocent people of Kabul are not to 
be punished by closing supply roads. We are hoping that supply 
roads to Kabul are to be opened by the opposition in honor of 
the arrival of the special envoy of the UN secretary general. 
The esteemed president said: Our talks are continuing . 
  In reply to a question, esteemed Mahmud Mastiri expressed 
optimism regarding the results of today's talks with our 
country's president.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Daniyel </F>
Bloch, Moti Bassok, and On Levi; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [DAVAR] Will we be ready to 
withdraw from Gaza and Jericho even before all the fine details 
of the Gaza and Jericho agreement are worked out? 
  [Rabin] We should make a distinction between withdrawing -- 
that is, ceding the overall responsibility -- and between 
starting to implement certain elements of the agreement, even if 
all the details have not been concluded yet -- providing the 
security issues are being implemented in a clear and 
well-organized manner. After all, we must set up completely new 
security networks there. We have to establish a foundation for 
the Palestinian police force which will assume responsibility in 
Gaza. Greater Gaza numbers 250,000 Palestinians. I have no 
desire to see Israeli soldiers and policemen roaming there. 
They have no business being there once a Palestinian element 
assumes responsibility for law and order and for preventing 
terrorism in Gaza, but this cannot happen overnight. 
  We must prove to the enemies of peace on all sides that 
despite the despicable murders of Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement], the Islamic Jihad, the rejectionist front 
organizations and those coming from the Israeli side -- mainly 
the crime of that murderer from Qiryat Arba' whose name does not 
deserve mention -- that we are continuing the process. 
  [DAVAR] In view of the present situation, wherein every step 
forward is followed by three steps backward, is it not 
preferable to skip over the interim stages? 
  [Rabin] It is impossible to skip over the interim stages, 
because that would lead to a complete stalemate. If we start 
dealing with the permanent solution, the problems of Jerusalem, 
the settlements, and the borders will crop up. The main test 
now is to continue the negotiations and to implement the 
Gaza-Jericho First agreement. I understand the Palestinians' 
and 'Arafat's predicament, but he has to understand -- just as I 
and the Israeli Government do -- that any delay only causes 
problems in implementing the agreement and is helping the 
enemies of peace on both sides foil it. The answer is that both 
sides overcome all the difficulties and realize that the 
appropriate answer to the enemies of peace is to attain and 
implement the agreement. [passage omitted] 
  [DAVAR] There are those who claim -- some ministers included 
-- that in order to minimize the friction in Hebron the Jewish 
settlers should be evacuated now, without waiting for the next 
stages. 
  [Rabin] I do not want to remark here on various operative 
proposals. When I was prime minister between 1974-1977 I did 
not permit any Jewish settlement in Hebron. Now, however, after 
the fact and on the basis of the Declaration of Principles, we 
are not uprooting settlements. It is very probable that in the 
special circumstances of Hebron, as long as the small Jewish 
settlement exists there, we will have to find other arrangements 
which would provide security to the 120,000 residents of Hebron 
vis-a-vis the 415 Jews living there. 
  [DAVAR] Will you at least make sure that no more Jews move 
there? 
  [Rabin] I do not want to enter the details. 
  [DAVAR] Was it not possible to evacuate the two minor 
Jewish enclaves in Hebron a long time ago? 
  [Rabin] Tall al-Rumaythah was established in August 1984, a 
month after the elections and a month prior to the establishment 
of the national unity government. The place is an 
archaeological site, perhaps even a cemetery. Mrs. Pli'a 
Albeck, who approved the Jewish holdings there, at the time 
stated that it is forbidden to dig in that ground and is 
necessary to dwell in mobile homes there because they do not 
call for digging foundations in the ground. If anybody dared to 
build a road somewhere in Israel over such a site, a great 
outcry would have ensued. Some seven or eight families live 
there. Two people under administrative arrest live there -- 
Barukh Marzel and No'am Federman. One of them is under 
detention and the other is on the wanted list. The decision to 
settle there was stupid, it is the classical example of a stupid 
political decision. 
  [DAVAR] Is not the presence of five armies in Hebron -- the 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces], armed settlers, international 
observers, the Palestinian police, and Hamas people -- a sure 
recipe for a powder keg? 
  [Rabin] Unfortunately it has already been proven that Hebron 
is a powder keg. Today we are paying the price of this 
despicable murderer, the lives of Jews worldwide and in Israel 
have been endangered by him. The first thing we must do now is 
to provide security for both Jews and Arabs in the present 
layout, with a urban police force and international presence. 
This is the price we must pay for the crime perpetrated by the 
despicable murderer in the Cave of the Patriarchs. [passage 
omitted] 
  [DAVAR] How do you see the West Bank following the 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Rabin] I regard Gaza as marginal for Israel's future and 
security. The status of Judaea and Samaria, from both the 
historical-religious and the security aspects, is totally 
different. My national priorities are as follows: United 
Jerusalem has top priority. Then come parts of Judaea and 
Samaria, the Golan Heights, and Gaza is in last place. 
  [DAVAR] Will you consider the removal of problematic 
settlements such as Netzarim following the withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho? 
  [Rabin] I want to adhere to the agreement. At this stage we 
are not discussing the removal of settlements. In Hebron we 
somewhat deviated from the agreement by accepting the 
international presence, but here we are paying the price of the 
despicable murderer from Qiryat Arba'. 
  [DAVAR] There are assessments according to which if we 
declare our willingness to withdraw from all of the Golan, a 
full peace agreement with Syria can be attained in a short time. 
  [Rabin] I maintained that in the previous circumstances, 
faced by an inflexible Syrian position, we should have given 
priority to negotiations with the Palestinians. I hope that 
upon the resumption of the talks in late April Syria will evince 
a new willingness. We must remember that the Palestinians do 
not constitute a threat to Israel's existence. The main problem 
with them has to do with the personal security of Israelis. A 
strategic threat to Israel's existence comes from the direction 
of Arab armies, and it is possible that in future they will be 
supported by military aid from another Muslim country. This is 
where we invest most of our defense budget. We do not need the 
F-15's, F-16's, Apache helicopter gunships, and Merkava tanks 
for our confrontation with the Palestinians. This is why we 
need a peace agreement with Syria, but it must be a peace treaty 
which will provide Israel with strategic security. With the 
Palestinians we are trying to create a new reality which will 
improve chances for coexistence. In the framework of the 
interim arrangement we are trying to bring about coexistence in 
a different format than today, a format enabling the 
Palestinians to run their own lives and defend themselves. 
  [DAVAR] Based on what you heard from Clinton about his 
meeting with al-Asad, and on what Ambassador Rabinovich told 
you, do you think there are any chances for a breakthrough with 
Syria? 
  [Rabin] I always believe there is a chance. But I cannot 
tell you that this breakthrough is within reach at this stage. 
  [DAVAR] Are there secret contacts with Syria? 
  [Rabin] Unfortunately, no. 
  [DAVAR] Turning to Lebanon, it looks as though things are 
getting worse there. Palestinian terror organizations have 
taken advantage of the agreement with the Hizballah for firing 
katyusha missiles at our northern settlements for the second 
time. 
  [Rabin] There is no point in downplaying this. There has 
been an escalation in Hizballah activity, and Palestinian 
organizations have been joining this activity more intensely 
than before. At the same time, the understandings remain in 
effect even if there are occasional deviations. If I am not 
mistaken, there were two such cases since last July. At the 
same time, for the last eight or nine months calm and security 
have prevailed along the northern border. The IDF and SLA [South 
Lebanese Army] are paying a dear price for maintaining this 
security. 
  [DAVAR] In retrospect, do you not think it would have been 
preferable to continue Operation Accountability for another few 
days in order to attain a better agreement? 
  [Rabin] No, we achieved our main objective. It would have 
been a grave mistake to repeat the Lebanon War. 
  [DAVAR] What expectations do you have of your upcoming 
meeting with Yeltsin? 
  [Rabin] I have not asked for this meeting. He invited me, 
and during the visit in late April I will try -- if nothing 
unexpected happens -- to discuss various political issues with 
him and with the top Russian echelon. We are witnessing renewed 
Russian political activity. This is not up to us, it is a fact. 
We are mainly coordinating our moves with the United States, 
but we cannot ignore the fact that Russia has been a partner, 
together with the United States, in the Madrid process and the 
ensuing negotiations, and we must maintain the dialogue with it. 
The second important aspect of this visit will be the meeting 
with Russian Jewry. 
  [DAVAR] Can the Russians offer any help on the Syrian track? 
  [Rabin] It is hard to answer this question before I speak 
with Yeltsin. 
  [DAVAR] Will you ask Yeltsin to act on the issue of the 
POW's and MIA's? 
  [Rabin] Everywhere I go I raise this issue, including during 
my meeting with the pope. [passage omitted] 
  [DAVAR] A group of South African scientists have threatened 
to reveal the secrets of nuclear and missile cooperation between 
Israel and South Africa. Are you concerned about this? 
  [Rabin] I am not concerned about anything relating to what 
you term the nuclear cooperation between Israel and South 
Africa, because there never was such cooperation. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul has disclosed 
that all those involved in the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat 
Church carry more than three passports. Some of them, he added, 
fled to the border strip and from there to Israel and then 
Australia. He added: The judiciary will decide on the matter; 
investigations continue and those found to be involved will be 
taken to court, regardless of who they may be. He added: We 
will not cover up for anybody and our judiciary is independent. 
The judicial investigator issues arrest warrants and instructs 
the security agencies to apprehend the suspects, he said. 
  He noted that the new press law will give the press more 
freedoms and will restrict the arbitrary questioning of 
journalists as well as the suspension of a paper before a trial 
is held. He stressed the need to organize the audiovisual 
media, which are a legacy of the war and which continue to 
operate from a militia-minded point of view. 
  Minister Dallul's remarks came in an interview with the 
Kuwaiti paper AL-QABAS. [passage omitted] 
  Concerning the defendants who participated in blowing up the 
Sayyidat al-Najat Church and who are abroad, Minister Dallul 
pointed out that the defendants currently in custody had made 
confessions and admitted that each participant carried more than 
three passports. He added: We have information that many of 
them fled to the border zone and from there to Israel. From 
Israel, they left for Australia with passports under false 
names. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tripoli, al Tayr [April] 3, JAMAHIRYAH NEWS AGENCY 
-- The American radio broadcast a commentary quoting the 
American chief of staff who represents the American 
Administration's viewpoint. The commentary referred to remarks 
by the American President. 
  JANA's editor for international affairs commented on this 
saying that "opinion and remarks expressed in this commentrary 
reflect the colonial viewpoint of the USA towards other peoples 
especially peoples who are endeavouring to build and assert 
themselves and take their decisions freely. This is a 
narrow-minded viewpoint leading the USA to mock international 
law and consider independent states as if they were her colonies 
or companies which she controls their resources. When American 
officials talk about changing other regimes, they should not 
forget that the American regime is the one which deserves to be 
change for it is founded on injustice, exploitation, persecusion 
of minorities including [words indistinct], racial 
discrimination and aggression. 
  The remarks made by American officials against China, the 
Great Jamahiryah, India, North Korea, Iran and Cuba and other 
peoples who are genuinely independent contain a scent of 
aggression. The peoples against whom America declared her 
hostility and uncovered her plans towards them, should get ready 
in anticipation of the aggression which the American radio 
remarks said it was being planned. 
  America [words indistinct] from the political stances she 
has 
been follwing that she is against all values and principles of 
freedom. She endeavours to distort civilisation and fuel wars. 
America commits daily tens of inhuman crimes against mankind 
civilisation. She threatens international peace. The peoples 
of the world continue to remember the crimes of America in 
Vietnam, Korea, Angola, Mozambic, South Africa, her strategic 
alliance with the Israelis against the Arabs, her instigation of 
conflicts in South America, her support for dictatorial regimes 
in South America, her promotion of drugs in the world and her 
acts of political assassination like that against the late 
president of Chile Salvador Allende. 
  All free peoples and active forces are required today to see 
the true nature of America who uses a colossal arsenal for the 
realisation of her designs and exerting pressure on other 
peoples through intimidation, terrorism and bribery so as to 
abandon humanitarian values and surrender to american domination.

<F P=106> [By Jamal Khashuqji from Jeddah; Algerian names as published] </F>
  [Excerpt] The dissolved Algerian group of the Islamic 
Salvation Front [FIS] has asserted that it has not pledged to 
halt violence. 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH, Rabeh Kebir, chairman of the FIS 
Executive Committee operating abroad, has said, in the first 
press statement since the German authorities ordered him to halt 
his political activities, that FIS leaders have not made any 
commitments to President Zeroual to halt "armed action." He 
added that FIS leaders have not made any decision in this regard 
contingent upon consultations with free FIS leaders. 
  The FIS reaction came less than 24 hours after the Algerian 
Presidential Office announced that Major General Zeroual had 
held personal contacts with the jailed FIS leaders, who asked 
Sheiks Ali Jedi and Abd el Qader Bou Khamkham to work to stop 
the violence. 
  In a related development, informed Algerian sources informed 
AL-HAYAH that the Algerian Army continues to "initiate" battles 
with armed group members, and that it is waging "a calculated" 
war against them. The Army's withdrawal from a certain area, 
the sources continued, does not mean that it is incapable of 
confronting these groups. Any military move hinges upon a 
full-blown and calculated plan, the sources maintained. 
  The sources declined to delve into military details. 
Nonetheless, they underscored the Army's cohesion, unity, and 
ability to keep things under control. They noted that the Army 
is currently engaged in large-scale pursuit operations against 
gunmen. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, April 1 (AFP) -- The banned Islamic Salvation 
Front (FIS) has accused Algerian authorities of killing more 
than 200 civilians during anti-terrorist sweeps over the past 
few days, according to a statement received here Friday. 
  The head of the FIS abroad, Rabah Kebir, who normally lives 
in Germany, called on international human rights organisations 
to condemn what he said was a wave of killings. 
  A number of anonymous callers have also phoned AFP in Paris 
over the past few days to denounce what they say have been 
"kidnappings" and "killings" by the army. 
  "Amongst the many examples of barbarity (...), one notes 
over 
the past few days the assassination of 82 civilians in Blida, 
south of Algiers, of 120 others between Meftah and Sidi Moussa, 
east of Algiers," said the statement dated March 31. 
  "Not a day goes by without word of collective killings 
across 
the country (...) people are taken from their homes and then 
assassinated, slaughtered and their bodies abandoned in the 
streets to create an atmosphere of fear amongst the population," 
the statement said. 
  Women are also victims of such "institutional terrorism", 
the 
statement said, referring to the killing of two women wearing 
the Islamic veil at Boudaouaou, east of Algiers, on Tuesday. 
  Anonymous telephone callers said they had witnessed the 
"execution" of at least 10 people Wednesday at Les Eucalyptus, 
an Islamic fundamentalist stronghold in the southeast suburbs of 
Algiers. 
  The callers said the 10 were killed in reprisal for the 
death 
of 10 soldiers and para-military police caught in an ambush. 
  One caller said he had seen a man deliberately "run over" by 
a tank on the main street of Les Eucalyptus. 
  Algerian authorities have blamed the FIS for a wave of 
terrorist attacks in the country since January 1992 when general 
elections the Islamists were poised to win were annulled.

  [Text] The security servives in the province of Tamanrasset 
today announced that they have arrested more than 300 people of 
foreign nationality during the combing operations which the 
security forces recently carried out in a number of quarters of 
the capital of Hoggar. The security services added that those 
persons were residing illegally in Algeria. The services 
pointed out that most of those arrested are perverts who carry 
out unlawful practices, including trading in drugs and armed 
robbery, as well as money dealings, as they have not presented 
any identity documents. During this day-long combing operation, 
in which joint forces of the army, police, gendarmerie, and 
customs participated, more than 1100 tins of Lahda [powdered] 
milk and baby milk, and more than 2000 packs of cigarettes - all 
of which were going to be smuggled to neighboring states - were 
seized.

<F P=106> [Statement by Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif after </F>
President Husni Mubarak's meeting with members of the National 
Democratic Party's [NDP] Political Bureau in Cairo on 4 April-- 
recorded] 
  [Text] During his meeting with members of the NDP Political 
Bureau, the president discussed the working papers of the 
national dialogue and the results of the meetings that took 
place between the NDP and leaders of the Egyptian political 
parties. These papers contained the viewpoints, ideas, and 
concepts of the Egyptian parties on the national dialogue from 
the perspective of the objectives and mechanisms of this 
dialogue. 
  During this meeting, President Mubarak affirmed many 
principles. First, that national dialogue is a dialogue among 
all the political parties and the constitutional institutions in 
which intellectuals, thinkers, unions, federations, and 
universities take part. Second, that the National Democratic 
Party is a party to this dialogue. It cannot impose opinions on 
it. Its responsibility, as the party of the majority, is to 
provide the opportunity for the dialogue to succeed and to make 
available to every side all the information and statements 
regarding the issues open for discussion. All the political, 
economic, and social issues of the homeland are open to dialogue 
for the present and future of Egypt. So that the call for the 
dialogue starts off on the right course, President Mubarak has 
decided to form a minicommittee called the Committee To Prepare 
for National Dialogue. It will include 25 members selected by 
the president from among the leaders of the political parties, 
unions, intellectuals, and those who have an opinion. The 
committee will state its views on: 
  1. Identifying the general committee for national dialogue 
and the names of those personalities who are expected to be 
invited to join in the national dialogue. 
  2. Proposing the objectives and issues of national 
dialogue. 
  3. Studying the method of action of this general 
committee, or general congress, as well as its subcommittees, 
specializations, the method of convening it, and the 
administration of its meetings. 
  4. Proposing and providing the groundwork for the 
statements that should be made available to serve the issues the 
national dialogue will address. 
  5. Proposing a venue for the general congress and the 
various committees of the national dialogue. 
  President Mubarak will invite the members of the Committee 
To 
Prepare for National Dialogue to a meeting when he returns from 
his upcoming visit to Japan and China.

has affirmed that the security agencies are keeping up their 
irreversible course in fighting terrorism without hesitation. 
He added that the Egyptian mass media have exposed what these

some of their members who came to their senses and returned to 
society's ranks. 
  Speaking at a celebration at the police academy today to 
mark 
the day of learning, al-Alfi said that these groups have plenty 
of secret undertakings, which will soon be publicized to expose 
the truth about this misguided bunch. 
  Al-Alfi added that the security agencies will not rest until 
they have eradicated the remnants of these terrorist elements 
who have turned terrorizing society into a profitable trade and 
way of life. 
  He emphasized that the security agencies are finished with 
the policy of action and reaction and will take the initiative 
to eradicate these elements in their hideouts to protect society. 
  During the celebration, excelling leaders and learners at

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Presidency of the Republic; date </F>
not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Brother citizens, the National 
Salvation Revolution was begun in the defense of this homeland, 
which had been overwhelmed by the dangers of fragmentation and 
infighting. National unity was threatened and the economy was 
in a state of collapse and stagnation. Corruption and nepotism 
were rampant because of the weakness of the rulers and the 
absence of a true course and higher ideals. Further fuel was 
added to the fire by party differences and improper press 
practices linked to private benefits and foreign interests. 
  The principles of the National Salvation Revolution were 
opposed to all that. It replaced division with unity. Defense 
and the struggle for the sake of God and the homeland replaced 
caution and surrender to enemies. It raised aloft the ideals of 
purity and impartiality over and above corruption. It raised 
aloft the banner of the brilliant Islamic law in place of a 
confused and baffled course. It worked to establish a new 
society guided by clear ideals linked to heaven. 
  The revolution established institutions for popular and 
political work and embarked on policies for reforming the 
economy, the education sector and society. The ship sailed on, 
guided by God, confident of victory despite storms, challenges, 
and trials. 
  When the revolution provided opportunities for consultation 
and advice, it issued regulations, but some people, whose minds 
were narrowed against the revolution and who hated it, thought 
that their opportunity had come to achieve their dreams and the 
dreams of those who supported them, to drag the country back to 
the hated and painful past. Among these was the newspaper 
AL-SUDANI AL-DUWALI, which gathered a clique blinded by the 
brilliance of money which was generously given to them, and by 
the fear of the foreigner whom they thought was God disposing of 
the universe. They were also friendly to the alliances and the 
ghosts of the past, which feed on illusions and live on mirages. 
  The paper permits its pens to harm the noblest causes of the 
homeland in the struggle and defense of its creed and unity. It 
raises doubts about the purpose and the struggle of the Armed 
Forces and the popular defense forces. It calls for the 
separation and negligence of the unity of the country, for which 
many martyrs have fallen and colored with their pure blood. 
  The martyrs march forward, liberating every inch of the 
country until they attain victory -- and they will attain it, 
God willing. 
  These journalists have worked to fragment national unity by 
raising doubts about the option of the people and the 
revolution, about the political system and the popular and 
constitutional bodies. They have called for a return to 
parties, sectarianism, and tribal conflict. They have waged a 
psychological war against the Armed Forces and the other regular 
forces, falsely accusing some of them on having committed 
excesses and oppression, and denigrating the strength of others 
in so far as the protection of the citizens and their property 
were concerned. 
  They resorted to magnifying simple incidents with the 
intention of influencing the security of citizens and the 
homeland. They then raised the charge of corruption and spread 
rumors, without providing any evidence or proof, in spite of the 
call made by the minister of justice, the attorney general, 
stressing the revolution's readiness and its firm commitment to 
establish the truth and to punish anyone whose criminality was 
proved. They intended by these acts to harm the revolution and 
its noblest intentions, namely righteousness and impartiality. 
  Finally they crowned all this with a premeditated design to 
kill respect for the revolution and its symbols. They became 
arrogant without any justification, committed excesses without 
any proof, and made allegations without any evidence. 
  Brothers, the revolution has promised God, then its people, 
to go to the end of the road to achieve clear victory and God's 
favor. It has proffered martyrs as evidence of its sincerity 
and a sign of devotion, and will not retreat or withdraw. God 
willing out of fear, nor will it bow before anyone other than 
God. [sentence as heard] 
  An order has been issued in accordance with emergency rules 
to close this newspaper. The organs concerned will call to 
account all those who have exceeded the bounds and overstepped 
the limits. Those who have done wrong shall know the end they 
will meet. God is great, glory to Islam, God is great, victory 
to Sudan.

  [Excerpts] Algerian President Liamine Zeroual left Tunisia 
this afternoon after a two-day official visit at the invitation 
of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. He was seen off on 
departure from Tunis-Carthage international airport by the 
president. 
  Following the visit, a joint statement was issued. The 
statement said that during the visit, in which the Algerian 
president was accompanied by an important delegation, the two 
presidents held comprehensive talks where the spirit of 
understanding and friendship and the belief in a common destiny 
prevailed. The talks showed much harmony in the points of view 
on bilateral, regional, and international matters discussed. 
  Regarding bilateral relations and ways of strengthening and 
promoting them on the basis of the strong political will of the 
two leaderships, the two presidents praised the achievements 
made in the process of enlarging existing spheres of fruitful 
common cooperation and their diversification in a way that will 
serve the aspirations of the two brotherly Algerian and Tunisian 
peoples and achieve their longing for more development and 
strength in a climate of solidarity and integration. 
  The two presidents noted with great satisfaction what the 
two 
brotherly countries achieved in the border demarcation issue and 
considered it a great achievement embodying the spirit of 
brotherhood and good neighborliness that built a strong bridge 
of fruitful cooperation and interaction between the two 
countries in faithfulness to their common history. 
  Presidents Ben Ali and Zeroual hailed the creation of 
several 
economic and social joint projects, particularly within the 
framework of the development of areas on the borders between the 
two countries. They stressed their determination to carry on 
bolstering this fruitful cooperation and their eagerness to 
guarantee the viability of the joint projects and make the 
Maghreb Bank for Cooperation an effective instrument to finance 
these projects. In this context, they agreed to convene the 
11th session of the Higher Tunisian-Algerian Joint Committee in 
September 1994. The two presidents also stressed their strong 
commitment to the progress of the two countries on the path of 
democracy, pluralism, the promotion of human rights, and the 
establishment of the civil society by preserving the 
constituents of the Arab and Islamic identity and promoting 
values of tolerance that are the pride of the Muslim religion -- 
distinct from all aspects of fanaticism, isolation, and 
extremism. The joint Tunisian-Algerian statement added that 
in their review of the progress of the building of the Arab 
Maghreb Union, the two heads of state blessed the important 
steps the Union had made. 
  They extolled the new push the sixth session of the 
Presidential Council had given to the Maghreb march. They 
reaffirmed their determination to continue to support the 
Maghreb edifice as the best way to rise to the challenges that 
are thrown up by the developments on the international stage and 
to embody the ambitions of the Maghreb peoples toward progress 
and invulnerability in the shadow of solidarity, integration, 
and merger. 
  Regarding the situation on the Arab and international 
levels, 
the presidents renewed their concern over the continuation of 
the crisis between the Libyan Jamahiriyah and some Western 
states. They stressed the need to work together to find a 
peaceful, just, and honorable solution to this crisis; a 
solution that will secure the interests of all sides on the 
basis of respect for international legitimacy and safeguard the 
Libyan people's sovereignty and dignity. They reaffirmed the 
importance of continuing efforts to rebuild trust and harmony in 
Arab relations and to establish firm and stable foundations for 
these ties based on respect for the sovereignty of countries, 
their choices, and the well-being of their entities and 
cooperation to utilize all these resources to serve joint 
interests. 
  They also confirmed their full support for the Palestinian 
people in their struggle to regain their legitimate rights, 
which include self-determination and setting up their 
independent state on their land, with Jerusalem as its capital. 
They denounced the barbaric massacres, particularly the Hebron 
mosque massacre, committed against the Palestinian people. 
  Presidents Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Liamine Zeroual 
confirmed the importance of solidarity between Arab and African 
peoples and the effective role of the Arab League and the OAU to 
boost and develop cooperation to serve joint interests. 
  They noted with optimism the steps achieved to lift the 
apartheid regime from the people of South Africa and to lay the 
foundations for a new epoch based on a just, democratic, and 
multiracial system. 
  The two heads of states expressed their deep interest in 
coordinating positions on security and cooperation with 
Mediterranean countries. They said they supported the 
initiative calling on Arab states overlooking the Mediterranean 
sea to coordinate between them to reach a unified stand 
reflecting their interest in making peace and tranquility 
prevail in this region. 
  The Tunisian-Algerian joint statement added that the two 
presidents welcomed their talks on the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the agreement between Bosnian Muslims and 
Croats, saying it was the first step toward ending the tragedy 
of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. They stressed the 
necessity that international and UN efforts continue to ward off 
Serb attacks, protect the sovereignty of country -- which is a 
member of the United Nations -- and preserve the right of its 
people to exist and live in peace and security. 
  President Liamine Zeroual expressed his admiration for 
Tunisia's revival in all fields under the wise leadership of 
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. [passage omitted] 
  He invited President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to go on an 
official visit to Algeria. The invitation was accepted and a 
date will be set later.

  [Text] Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf made 
intensive efforts on the sidelines of the Arab League Council 
session to persuade Arab countries, foremost Egypt, to normalize 
their relations with Iraq and allow the rift in Arab ranks to 
heal. 
  Al-Sahhaf met with the Egyptian, Jordanian, and Moroccan 
foreign ministers in a bid to improve Iraqi-Arab ties. Minister 
al-Sahhaf said that his country will be pleased to receive any 
Egyptian official who wishes to visit Baghdad in an attempt to 
normalize relations. 
  The Iraqi foreign minister accused Israel of arming and 
training the Kurds in Northern Iraq to destabilize the security 
and stability of Iraq. Al-Sahhaf called for a stiffer Arab 
boycott of Israel until the latter stops its arbitrary practices 
in the occupied territories and respects the resolutions of the 
UN Security Council and international legitimacy. 
  Al-Sahhaf said that his country implemented most UN Security 
Council resolutions. He denied that Iraq holds any Kuwaiti 
detainees, inviting Arab teams to visit Iraq to see for 
themselves.

  [Text] Baghdad, 4 Apr (INA)--Iraq has refused to sign an 
agreement reached by the OPEC Ministerial Monitoring Committee 
in its 12th session held in Geneva last week. The agreement 
calls for maintaining the current crude oil production ceiling 
of 24.52 million barrels per day [bpd] until the end of the year. 
  In a statement to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY, Oil Minister Safa' 
Hadi Jawad said that Iraq has reiterated its commitment to the 
1990 Geneva agreement because it is the only agreement reached 
by the OPEC under normal circumstances, because it defines the 
level of production and prices in a legitimate way, and because 
it is binding on the OPEC member states. 
  The oil minister said that the recent agreement, which was 
not signed by Iraq, will cause further deterioration in oil 
prices in the world market because the ceiling is much higher 
than the expected world demand for OPEC crude oil, particularly 
during the second and third quarters of this year. World demand 
for OPEC crude oil is estimated at 23 million bpd, a figure that 
is less than OPEC's current production ceiling. 
  The minister noted that the convening of this meeting came 
at 
a time when oil prices have deteriorated to a level not seen 
since the beginning of the seventies. OPEC, he said, had to 
make a choice: Either to reduce the production ceiling to the 
level of demand indicated by the oil prices or to maintain the 
current production ceiling and sacrifice the prices. 
  Dr. Jawad indicated that Saudi Arabia rejected the first 
choice because it requires it to make a significant drop in its 
output. Saudi Arabia's current output amounts to one-third of 
the region's output. He added that Saudi Arabia has claimed 
that this choice would encourage non-OPEC states to increase 
their output, something that would result in the decline of OPEC 
output and its share of the oil market. This, according to the 
Saudi point of view, would further weaken OPEC. The minister 
stressed that the nine-month period specified by the agreement 
will eventually result in weakening OPEC and the market because 
its does not take into consideration seasonal changes in the 
demand for oil. 
  Concluding his statement to INA, Dr. Safa Hadi Jawad said 
that, out of its concern for the individual and collective 
interests of the OPEC member states, Iraq has rejected this 
agreement and declared its commitment to the Geneva agreement of 
1990 for the reasons mentioned above. He urged the oil 
exporting nations to adopt stands that protect their interests 
and stop the continued looting of their resources through the 
continued reduction in oil prices, which have now dropped to 
levels lower than those of the early seventies.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry of the Saddam regime has 
recalled a number of ambassadors and heads of missions abroad to 
discuss urgent issues. This came in a circulation issued by the 
ministry a few days ago. The ministry is expected to discuss 
with these diplomats the method of action in the next phase. 
Iraqi opposition sources expect the regime to embark on 
diplomatic transfers on charges of dereliction of duties 
following the sharp criticism of Iraqi diplomacy made by 'Udayy 
Saddam Husayn through his newspaper BABIL. 
  An Iraqi diplomat, who asked to remain anonymous, revealed 
that a circular was issued by the Iraqi Intelligence Command to 
its offices in Iraqi embassies to activate their efforts and to 
contact Iraqis abroad to attract them to return to Iraq. 
  The intelligence office in the Iraqi regime embassy in 
Jordan 
embarked on an organized campaign to exert pressure on Iraqi 
writers, who are in Amman, to return to Iraq and to warn them 
against issuing any anti-regime writings. The source added that 
a ranking Iraqi intelligence officer, Hikmat al-Haju, joined the 
Amman Embassy staff to replace the second man in the embassy and 
to supervise intelligence activities together with two other 
employees who were assigned to the embassy earlier. The source 
added that a new plan has been set to utilize trade and 
commercial centers to collect information and to monitor the 
movements of Iraqis through recruiting agents among them as fake 
reporters and propagation employees who deal with Gulf papers. 
  In another development, Interior Minister Watban al-Tikriti, 
Saddam's half-brother, has been charged with the chairmanship of 
the Higher Council for National Security, including the heads of 
the Departments of Intelligence, Private Security, Military 
Intelligence, and Internal Public Security. This council will 
coordinate among the security departments and its affiliated 
institutions to tackle the emergency situation that is expected 
to explode in the country.

  [Excerpt] Nicosia, April 4 (AFP)--An AFP correspondent and 
her bodyguard in Iraqi Kurdistan were killed instantly when one 
or more gunmen fired at their car with automatic weapons at 
short range, UN officials said Monday. 
  Lissy Schmidt, a 35-year-old German, was travelling with her 
Iraqi Kurdish bodyguard on a road linking al-Sulaymaniyah with 
Sayid Sadiq near the Iranian border when they were attacked from 
a passing car Sunday, UN officials in the area told AFP by 
telephone. 
  "It was really (an attack) aimed at her," one UN source 
said. 
"She had no chance." 
  The two bodies were sent to a mortuary at al-Sulaymaniyah 
hospital. Schmidt's body is to be flown back to Germany. 
  UN officials said it was not known who carried out the 
attack. 
  Schmidt had not spoken of any threats on her life in the 
days 
before her death. 
  In Damascus one of the main Iraqi Kurdish groups, the 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), said Iraqi President Saddam 
Husayn's regime had "promised a reward of 10,000 dollars to 
anyone killing a foreigner in Kurdistan." 
  However, the PUK, which runs the de facto autonomous region 
with the Democratic Party of Kurdistan (DPK), did not name the 
killers in its statement. 
  The PUK said Schmidt and the bodyguard, Aziz Qadir, were 
killed instantly by the gunmen at a range of around 300 metres 
(yards). They were near Jakhnakhajian village. 
  Schmidt was the only foreign journalist permanently based in 
Iraqi Kurdistan, controlled by the Kurds since their uprising 
against the Baghdad regime following the January-February 1991 
Gulf War. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Baghdad, 3 Apr (INA)--AL-THAWRAH has stressed that 
the policy of the Al Sa'ud family has always been characterized 
by subordination and submissiveness to foreigners, and that 
their stands have always been hostile to all nationalist and 
pan-Arab regimes in the Arab homeland. 
  The paper, which speaks for the Arab Socialist Ba'th party, 
says in an article today that the Al Sa'ud family has spent 
billions of dollars to conspire against nationalist and pan-Arab 
revolutions in more than one Arab country, following 
instructions from and through direct coordination with their 
American masters and allies. 
  The paper adds: In view of their upbringing and the role of 
imperialism in the establishment of their state and constant 
support for it, the Al Sa'ud rulers find nothing abnormal in 
their submissiveness to the West and the United States. 
  Referring to yesterday's address by Sa'ud al-Faysal, the Al 
Sa'ud family's foreign minister, at the meeting of the foreign 
ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC], the paper says 
that this agent, expressing his family's black hatred against 
Iraq, has deemed it too much for some Gulf states to adopt a 
stand that is in line with pan-Arab sentiments or to call for 
lifting the unjust blockade imposed on the people of Iraq. 
  The paper adds: In his address, agent Sa'ud al-Faysal 
denounces with extreme stupidity Iraq's efforts and contacts 
aimed at developing a world public opinion in support of its 
fair cause. 
  The paper explains that this agent minister was so shameless 
as to accuse Iraq of working to split the unity of the Gulf 
states against Iraq, which stood like a lofty mountain and whose 
children offered rivers of blood to defend the Gulf itself. 
  The paper stresses that what Sa'ud al-Faysal said was 
directly ordered by his American masters. Thus, he is only 
playing the role of a minor agent echoing the voice of his 
masters and acting like a lowly follower. The paper says that 
this stand is a continuation of the Al Sa'ud family's treasonous 
role which they started in Hafar al-Batin when they made 
available all requirements of the 30-state aggression against 
Iraq. 
  The paper stresses that the progress in the stands of some 
sisterly Arab Gulf states was not a coincidence, but was the 
outcome of a total conviction of the importance of Iraq and its 
role in maintaining the Gulf unity and security, and because 
they have come to realize that the blockade imposed on Iraq has 
gone beyond all international and legitimate justifications. 
  Concluding its article, AL-THAWRAH says that the aim of the 
Al Sa'ud family's allegations is to keep the Arab Gulf states 
under the threat of the imperialist hammer, represented by this 
family, and to urge the continuation of the blockade, which will 
inevitably come to an end because of the rising number of good 
people in the world and the unrelenting steadfastness of the 
people of Iraq.

  [Text] Irbil, Iraq, April 1 (AFP) -- At least 2,000 Kurds 
have trekked across the mountains from Turkey to 
Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq in the past month, reporting 
widespread repression by Turkish security forces, officials said. 
  Kurdish customs officers and military personnel said Friday 
the Kurdish authorities registered more than 1,000 refugees in 
the border town of Zakho on March 11, but 1,000 more arrived 
later in the month. They were staying in tents and ruined Iraqi 
Kurdish villages. 
  Muhammed Mikho, a Kurd from the village of Gevere in 
southern 
Turkey, told AFP the Turkish authorities prevented cars from 
entering or leaving the village and the Kurds could not take 
sick people to hospital. 
  "No food reached our village. We could not provide our 
children with fruit or vegetables throughout the winter," he 
said. 
  He was staying in a tent near the Turkish border with his 
wife and eight children. 
  Just before Sunday's Turkish municipal elections "soldiers 
came into the village, hit us, tortured our women and threatened 
to kill all of us," Mikho said. The soldiers' actions prompted 
Kurdish families to leave Gevere. 
  The Kurdish authorities, who have controlled the Iraqi side 
of the border since March 1991, said they had not decided how to 
handle the new influx. 
  The refugees insisted on international protection and 
rejected plans to move them into a camp, saying they were 
"afraid of the Turkish secret services," Kurdish officials in 
Zakho said. 
  Turkish representatives maintain a contact office in Zakho. 
  A refugee from Sibeli village said the Turkish Kurds feared 
cross-border raids by Turkish helicopters, and wanted to keep 
their places of refuge secret. 
  Other refugees said the Turkish military did not let them 
take any property with them and they had not yet received any 
aid. 
  As discussions continued in Zakho over the establishment of 
a 
refugee camp, Kurdish police who refused to be named said they 
were not sure whether they would be able to protect refugees in 
a camp against "attacks from the Turkish secret services."

  [Text] Cairo, 4 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and head of the 
Palestinian side to the Gaza-Jericho Committee meetings, has 
stressed that the main objective of the Security Committee 
meeting today is to complete the negotiations concerning the 
establishment of the Palestinian police force, the timetable for 
the force's entry, and the date the vanguards will arrive in the 
Arab territories. 
  In statements before starting the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations today, Dr. Sha'th said the Legal Affairs Committee 
is expected to begin its work today after legal advisers arrive 
from the West Bank and Gaza. Sha'th said several Palestinians 
from the occupied territories are expected to arrive today to 
take part in the meetings of the committee in charge of 
transferring power. The committee started its work in Cairo 
today. 
  In his statements, Dr. Sha'th said the delegates will also 
discuss the possibility of drawing up a timetable for the 
release of the Palestinian prisoners and detainees. He noted 
that the committee stemming from the Gaza-Jericho Committee will 
meet today and will continue working day and night to achieve an 
agreement as soon as possible. He said several Norwegians from 
the international observer force will arrive in Cairo today. 
  General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of staff and head 
of the Israeli side to the negotiations, said this round of 
talks will continue until Wednesday evening. He said he hoped 
that positive results would be achieved as soon as possible. 
  Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, head of the 
Palestinian side to the Security Committee, expects that an 
agreement will be reached very soon, noting that if progress is 
achieved in the talks, the negotiations concerning the 
Palestinian police force will be concluded today. 
  Brig. Gen. al-Yahya affirmed that Palestinian President 
'Arafat will arrive in Cairo tomorrow, Tuesday.

  [Text] Cairo, 4 Apr (MENA)--Responsible Palestinian 
military sources have affirmed that there are major differences 
between the Palestinian and the Israeli sides over arrangements 
for the entry of the Palestinian police force into Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  In statements to MENA, the sources said the Israeli side 
wants a limited number -- no more than seven individuals -- of 
the vanguards of the Palestinian police force to enter these 
areas for a site inspection. Then, a small force can enter some 
time between April and mid-May. The main body of the force 
could enter at the beginning of July. 
  The sources warned against the dangers that could crop up 
because of the delay in the entry of the basic police force into 
Gaza and Jericho. 
  The Palestinian sources clarified that the Palestinian 
military leadership, which has met for three days running in 
Cairo, set out a specific working paper, which it dispatched to 
President Yasir 'Arafat. 'Arafat asked Nabil Sha'th, head of 
the Palestinian negotiating team, to adhere to this working 
paper during his negotiations with the Israeli side. 
  These sources specified the demands of the Palestinian 
military command in the following points: 
  1. Compliance with a specific timetable endorsed by the 
Israeli side and linking the entry into Gaza and Jericho of the 
vanguards of the Palestinian police force and the remaining 
members of the force. 
  2. Agreement on the magnitude and arming of the force. A 
timetable is to be set out for the entry of the Palestinian 
force's equipment. 
  3. A strong entry by the Palestinian police force into Gaza 
and Jericho, so that the Palestinians in these territories, who 
have long suffered occupation and frustration, can feel pride 
and dignity. 
  The same sources added that the Palestinian side stressed to 
the political leadership the need to set out a timetable for the 
entry of the police force, providing entry is complete before 
the end of April. The sources noted that the Israeli side is 
now discussing delaying the entry of the force from 15 May, 
which marks the anniversary of the establishment of the State of 
Israel, to 1 July. This could create a security vacuum that 
might result in serious moral and military consequences, the 
sources noted. 
  The sources added that the Israelis want the Palestinian 
police force to enter Gaza and Jericho in closed vehicles or 
buses and in a way that resembles the entry of prisoners or 
infiltrators, not as security forces returning to their land 
with pride and dignity, something that will affect the mission 
of these forces and their future dealings with the Palestinian 
people, who have suffered much from Israel's occupation and its 
repressive measures. 
  The Palestinian sources added that the Israelis also want 
the 
equipment and weapons of the Palestinian police to enter in 
sealed boxes, thus denying them the opportunity to test them. 
The sources demanded that the 200 vehicles the United States 
decided to give to the Palestinian police be handed over in 
Egypt or al-'Arish, not in Israel, so that they might be 
examined, painted in distinguishing Palestinian colors, and 
marked with the security emblem of the Palestinian police. The 
same sources stressed that the magnitude of the Palestinian 
force has not been fully determined, adding that this topic will 
be discussed during the current round. 
  The sources named the military commanders who must enter 
Gaza 
and Jericho as follows: Nasr Yusuf, commander in chief of the 
Palestinian forces; Haj Isma'il, official in charge of security 
in the Palestinian command; Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq 
al-Mahaydah, who is the chief of staff; Mamduh Nawfal, from the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine; and Muhammad 
Qudsiyah, commander of the Badr Forces in Jordan. The following 
are the names of the Palestinian commanders who must enter Gaza 
[as received]: Sa'ib al-'Ajiz, commander of the Palestinian 
Forces in Sudan; Khalid Sultan, commander of the Palestinian 
forces in Libya; Muhammad Fawj, alias Abu-Humayd, commander of 
the Palestinian forces in Yemen; and Brigadier General 
'Abd-al-Hayy 'Abd-al-Wahid, commander of the 'Ayn Jalut Forces 
in Egypt.

  [Text] At the end of the second day of the deliberations 
of the military committee in Cairo, it transpires that the 
progress being made is extremely slow, despite public 
declarations on the intention to facilitate the talks and reach 
an agreement soon. Our correspondent in Cairo Arye Gus has 
learned that the Palestinians are avoiding agreements on various 
issues, and that they tried to reopen several issues which have 
already been concluded, such as the deployment of the 
Palestinian forces in Gaza and the timetable for the deployment 
of the police force in the autonomy areas. There are also 
differences between Israel and the PLO on the technical 
procedures for the entrance of the police force to the 
territories. Our correspondent was told that the Palestinians 
will not be given any responsibility over the autonomy areas 
before the agreement is signed, although they will be 
responsible for refugee camps handed over to them in these areas.

  [Text] Cairo, 5 Apr (MENA)--Sources from the Palestinian 
and Israeli delegations have agreed that substantial differences 
are impeding the current negotiations in Cairo to implement the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  The sources said that these negotiations are going through 
"a 
crisis," despite some positive statements. 
  The Palestinian sources told MENA that the Israeli side 
continues to refuse to draw up a definite timetable for the 
withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
They added that the Israeli side is also refusing to draw up a 
timetable for the entry of the Palestinian police and 
specifications for the type of weapons to be used by this force. 
  The Palestinian sources went on to say that the Israeli 
side, 
which has mainly used civilian negotiators with the exception of 
Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, wants to ignore the 
Palestinian military commanders' view of the security and 
military situation in Gaza and Jericho. They added that these 
commanders are demanding a definite timetable for the entry of 
their main forces into the Palestinian self-rule area in the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho area. They are also demanding an 
agreement on the type of weapons needed for these forces to 
achieve security in the areas from which Israel will withdraw.

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 29 March 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Report on Violence in Asyut 
  2. Alexandria University Teaching Club Elections 
  3. Article by Muslim Brotherhood Official Dr. Ahmat 
al-Malat 
  4. Criticism of the Movie "The Terrorist" 
  5. Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali Column 
  6. Reaction to Ban on Shaykh 'Abd-al-Kafi Sermons 
  7. Article on Land Day 
<H5>  REPORT ON VIOLENCE IN ASYUT </H5>
  On page 4, the newspaper publishes a 2,000-report by Qutb 
al-'Arabi on the ongoing confrontation between the security 
forces and the Islamic groups in Asyut. The report notes that 
violence has escalated in Asyut in the past three months, with 
armed operations against the police increasing from six 
operations in January, to nine in February, to 18 operations in 
March. Over 50 people, including policemen, citizens, and 
Islamic group members, have been killed and over 70 others have 
been wounded in these operations. The report then tries to 
explain the reasons for this escalation, putting the blame 
squarely on the government's heavy-handed policy. The report 
says "the leaders of the Islamic current in Asyut (Labor 
Party-Muslim Brotherhood) believe that the reduction of violence 
in Asyut must take place within the framework of a comprehensive 
solution that will establish real pluralism and democracy and 
allow and decriminalize freedom of political action." 
"Moreover, moderate Islamic leaders believe that the haphazard 
arrest of citizens in Asyut, their detention as hostages, their 
harsh treatment, and the blockade of residential quarters 
encourage the escalation of violence and the formation of a 
strong front supporting it." The report notes that these 
government tactics "feed the industry of violence" in Asyut. It 
calls for lifting the blockade on al- Walidiyah quarter and 
allowing freedom of movement for its inhabitants. 
<H5>  ALEXANDRIA UNIVERSITY TEACHING CLUB ELECTIONS </H5>
  In an 800-word report on page 4 by 'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad, 
the 
newspaper says that "despite strong government pressure and 
overt rigging", the Islamists won 6 seats in the elections for 
the board of directors of the teaching club of Alexandria 
University. The government ticket won the remaining eight seats 
while the leftist ticket won no seats. The report identifies 
the elected Islamist members of the teaching club as Dr. 'Umar 
al-Barbari, Dr. 'Abd-al- 'Aziz Salamah, Dr. Mustafa Abu-al-Huda, 
Dr. Mustafa Abu-al-'Aynayn, Dr. al-Masiri, and Dr. Nabil 
al-Mulukhiyah. 
<H5>  ARTICLE BY MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD OFFICIAL DR. AHMAD AL-MALAT </H5>
  On page 5, the newspaper publishes a 1,500-word article by 
Muslim Brotherhood official Dr. Ahmad al-Malat. Referring to 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron, al-Malat deplores the 
weakness of the Muslims who now receive "blow after blow" and 
"slap after slap," without doing anything. He adds that 
"regrettably, the media, including the Egyptian media, have not 
paid any attention to this tragedy, as if it was an earthquake 
that happened in a remote place and did not harm us in any way." 
The media have maintained their "trivia" and their "deliberate 
defiance of Islamic values." "The last days of Ramadan were 
celebrated with dancing, nakedness, and entertainment. The 
Koran's share on the radio were a few minutes every day while 
'Adawiyah [a folklore singer] got the lion's share." The 
writer goes on to say that all the Arab governments without 
exception have become "defeatist", running after the "mirage of 
peace" which they are worshiping instead of God. 
<H5>  CRITICISM OF THE MOVIE "THE TERRORIST" </H5>
  On page 9, the newspaper carries a 900-word critique by 
Sharif Samih of the movie "The Terrorist," played by famous 
Egyptian actor-comedian 'Adil Imam. Samih says "the movie 
represents the Interior Ministry's view of terrorism. It deals 
with this issue "very superficially" and without trying to 
identify the roots of the problem. He goes on to say that if 
the movie's message is to entertain and kill two hours of time, 
then it has succeeded, but of its message is to fight terrorism, 
then it has failed. Samih says the move has no relation to 
reality and is based on a fabricated scenario. The audience are 
only attracted by 'Adil Imam's acting abilities and by the 
"sexual jokes" in the movie. 
  Also on page 9, reader Muhsin Mahmud Amin Sarhan from the 
College of Sciences says the movie "The Terrorist" offers an 
alternative slogan to the slogan "Islam is the solution. The 
alternative slogan is "Corruption is the solution" because the 
movie urges us to emulate the "immoral and dissolute Western 
civilization." 
<H5>  SHAYKH MUHAMMAD AL-GHAZALI COLUMN </H5>
  In his 800-word column "This Is Our Religion" on page 12, 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali criticizes an article headlined 
"Religion and Ideology" by counselor Muhammad Sa'id al-'Ashmawi. 
Al-Ghazali notes that al-'Ashmawi's article is "vague" and 
"deliberately creates confusion" between heavenly and 
terrestrial religions. He says al-'Ashmawi equates Buddhism and 
Hinduism with Islam and Christianity. Wihout offering a 
counteropinion, he also takes al-'Ashmawi to task for saying 
that "Islam is a religion, while the doctrines embraced by some 
groups are ideology." Referring to the British Parliament's 
passage of a law reducing the age of consent among homosexuals 
to 18, al-Ghazali asks whether the religious people who oppose 
this legislation do harm to God or interere in politics. He 
also asks if this "abnormal" legislation is adopted in the Arab 
world, will we blame the pious youths if they oppose it? He 
then says that the Koran is an immortal book that specifies the 
following punishment for those who commit adultery: "Flog each 
of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in 
their case, in a matter prescribed by God, if ye believe in God 
and the last day." 
<H5>  REACTION TO BAN ON 'ABD-AL-KAFI SERMONS </H5>
  On page 12, the newspaper publishes an 800-word article by 
writer Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus entitled "Blatant Injustice." 
The writer says the ruling regime has committed grave mistakes 
in fighting the "entire Islamic current," thus winning the 
enmity of wide sectors of the people. Giving an example, the 
writer says the "police rule was blatantly manifested in the 
decision to prevent Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Kafi from delivering 
sermons, although he never attacked the government." The writer 
notes that the government caved in to the demands of the secular 
people and haters of Islam and adopted this measure against the 
popular preacher, who used to attract large crowds of worshipers. 
<H5>  ARTICLE ON LAND DAY </H5>
  On page 12, the newspaper publishes a 2,000-word article by 
Dr. Mahjub 'Umar on "Land Day," celebrated by the Arabs of 
Israel on 30 March of each year. The article reviews the events 
of that day on 30 March 1976 when the Arabs of Israel staged 
strikes and demonstrations to protest the seizure of their lands 
by the Israeli Government. Six Arabs were killed by the Israeli 
forces during these protests. The writer notes that the Arabs 
of Israel are a force to be reckoned with and will have the 
"final say" in the long conflict with Israel over the land.

<F P=106> [Interview with Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political </F>
Department, by Salwa Abu-Sa'dah in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] Faruq Qaddumi "Abu-al-Lutf", head of the PLO 
Political Department, one of the organization's prominent 
leaders, and indeed one of the strongest opponents of the "bad" 
articles of the Oslo agreement, as he puts it, has given this 
exclusive interview to AL-MUSAWWWAR. Hebron's massacre, its 
repercussions, active influence on the peace process, and the 
changes of priorities and concepts that it dictated, 
particularly its undermining of the Israeli security theory, was 
one of the chief issues he discussed. Neither Rabin's policies 
nor the U.S. violation and circumvention of the text and 
principles of the U.S. peace initiative escaped Abu-al-Lutf's 
analysis. In the following interview he outlines the necessary 
Palestinian negotiating method and sets forth the priorities of 
Palestinian action after the Gaza-Jericho agreement is 
implemented. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] During the Arab foreign ministers meeting two 
days ago, did you expect better results than the ones actually 
achieved in connection with the Jerusalem issue and protection 
for the Palestinians? What level of Arab action do you believe 
is necessary to serve this cause? 
  [Qaddumi] The Arab group should handle the task of barring 
U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. This 
group should also mobilize world support for our demands on this 
issue, taking into account the fact that Jerusalem is part of 
the occupied territories. The United States cannot turn its 
back on the principles on which the peace process was founded. 
These principles maintain that Jerusalem is part of the 
Palestinian territories occupied in 1967. UN Security Council 
resolutions specify this, too. Several weeks ago the U.S. 
Administration submitted a message on human rights which 
referred to the same point. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] What do you say about President Clinton's 
remark 
that Jerusalem is Israel's capital? 
  [Qaddumi] The United States, explaining its reservations 
about the Jerusalem paragraph in the relevant UN Security 
Council resolution, says that Jerusalem is being left to the 
final status negotiations. Actually this is a manipulation of 
words. The United States must be an impartial intermediary and 
must not interfere in such matters but must let the negotiations 
take their course. There must be no alteration of the text of 
UN Security Council Resolution 242 which considers East 
Jerusalem part of the Palestinian occupied territories. The 
United States should not give the impression to the world that 
these territories are disputed territories in line with Israel's 
pretension that it regained the Palestinian occupied territories 
from Egypt and Jordan. The UN partition resolution that gave 
Israel its own birth certificate declares that these territories 
are Palestinian and belong to the Palestinians who have the 
right to establish an independent state on them. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] Will the PLO adopt specific steps to clarify 
the 
Palestinian opposition to any U.S. bias to Israel? 
  [Qaddumi] We have begun to take such measures. The Arab 
League has been active in this regard. It organized a meeting of 
the Arab ambassadors in Washington and formed a committee which 
began a dialogue with the U.S. Administration, explaining that 
the foundations on which the peace process rests must not be 
changed. Otherwise the process of political settlement would 
become flawed. The Arab group must also rally world opinion 
around the idea that Jerusalem belongs to the three religions 
and that East Jerusalem was occupied in 1967. The whole world 
recognizes this. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] What about the alternatives Palestinians have 
to tackle on the issue of Jerusalem--negotiating it in the final 
phase--and about the idea of internationalization that 
Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] raised some time ago? 
  [Qaddumi] Abu-'Ammar has not called for internationalizing 
Jerusalem. These statements--if we can call them 
statements--were fabricated by a foreign news agency. Jerusalem 
in our view is part of the occupied Palestinian territories. I 
am referring to Arab Jerusalem; it is the capital of the 
Palestinian state. From the first moment, when we took part in 
the Madrid conference, [former U.S. Secretary of State] James 
Baker said that Jerusalem is part of the Palestinian territories 
occupied in 1967. We are therefore mobilizing world public 
opinion to emphasize this fact. Our vision is that east 
Jerusalem must be the capital of the Palestinian state once it 
is proclaimed. It is impermissible for any party to anticipate 
matters and determine the fate of this city. Everyone should be 
committed to the texts of international legitimacy and the UN 
Security Council resolutions, which provide the basis for the 
political settlement President Bush suggested on the basis of 
Resolution 242. This resolution stresses the need to withdraw 
from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967--east Jerusalem 
was occupied in 1967--and definitely shows that whatever is 
being said by the Israeli or American side in this connection is 
jumping ahead of events. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] Do you expect the Israeli response to the 
disputed points in recent talks in Cairo--about the technical 
details concerning the deployment of Palestinian forces in 
Hebron--to be positive, or negative? 
  [Qaddumi] We know the policy Israel pursues and we know its 
negotiating approach; it procrastinates and equivocates. Shamir 
clearly said before that he wanted these talks to drag on for 10 
years without taking a step forward. Rabin and the Labor Party 
use a more flexible language that deceives many world circles. 
He says that he wants to emphasize the security aspect in the 
occupied territories and that Israel gives top priority to the 
issue of security. He wants to blackmail the Palestinian 
negotiator--as though it were Israel that is threatened--without 
committing himself to the Oslo agreement. He even says that 
these dates [not further specified] are not sacred. 
  After the ugly massacre--committed in Hebron through a 
conspiracy between the settlers and the Israeli Army--it was 
proved beyond a doubt that Rabin, who is in collusion with the 
army, shows by his statements that Israel does not want peace. 
All he seeks through these practices is to subjugate the 
Palestinian people and eat up the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He 
once again describes the Palestinian territories as Judea and 
Samaria. The al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre proved that it is we, 
and not the Israelis, who need security. The recent resolution, 
904, demanded that protection for the Palestinian people be 
provided. This rebuts Israel's claim to protect its security 
against neighboring threats. The massacre has proven that 
Israel is the chief cause of tension, that it procrastinates and 
that it wants to devour the occupied territories. We reject that. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] Therefore, you don't expect a positive Israeli 
response to the points of dispute concerning the deployment of 
the Palestinian forces in Hebron? 
  [Qaddumi] Israel is pursuing procrastination in the 
negotiations. They sometimes agree on certain points, but later 
on they disagree on these points. When we show flexibility and 
accept specific points, they consider this a gain and they try 
to gain more points. We reject this policy. They will make 
other proposals that run counter to the provisions that have 
been agreed upon. Israel procrastinates and it is not sincere. 
We have no confidence in its behavior. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] During the Cairo negotiations concerning the 
deployment of the Palestinian forces in Hebron, Israel said that 
it will unilaterally deal with the settlers the way it sees fit. 
Do you believe that Israel will comply with its commitment 
concerning the issue of settlers? 
  [Qaddumi] Israel must clearly adopt measures in this regard. 
According to Resolution 904, Israel will disarm the settlers. 
Israel must eliminate the settlements that cause instability and 
obstruct the peace process. 
  Some settlements cause direct friction and provoke the 
Palestinian people. These settlements must be eliminated. 
There are 42 Israeli families, an Israeli school, and various 
centers in Hebron. All these meant to provoke 120,000 Arabs who 
live in the town and its suburbs. Many Israelis corroborated 
these facts and demanded that this Israeli presence be 
eliminated. Therefore, Israel must eliminate this. Israel 
adopted some measures, including the imposition of a curfew on 
Hebron and the occupied territories. This curfew must be lifted. 
Israel must also end the siege on the West Bank, Gaza, and 
Jerusalem, because these measures do not help create the 
appropriate atmosphere for starting the negotiations. 
  The United Nations must send enough international observers 
of various nationalities, such as Americans, Britons, Russians, 
and the French, so that the Palestinian people feel secure. 
These observers will supervise the questionable movements of 
the settlers. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] Now that the two sides have agreed on several 
points regarding the Palestinian force, the deployment in 
Hebron, and the international presence, should the talks resume, 
do you expect Israel to withdraw by 13 April? 
  [Qaddumi] The question is not whether we are pessimistic or 
not. The point is that Israel does not comply with the 
agreement and does not honor the promises it makes, not even if 
there is international verification of Israel's promises. In 
the first place, Israel did not honor the Oslo agreement and did 
not withdraw on 13 December. Rabin even boasts that these dates 
are not sacred. Thus, for Israel, none of the points in the 
agreement are sacred and require long negotiations. Since the 
balance of power is in Israel's favor and it is the occupying 
power, it does what it likes. But the cosponsors of the 
conference must pressure Israel to implement this agreement in 
full; that is, the withdrawal must take place on time on 13 
April and the last withdrawal must take place in June so that 
the elections can be held. They should have fully withdrawn 
from Gaza, but they came to Cairo to seek a bigger area for the 
settlements and to insist on their responsibility for security 
at the crossing points, although the internal security and the 
crossing points are two closely related issues. The crossing 
points are the responsibility of the internal security and they 
[the Israelis] are responsible for external security, which is a 
like a seasonal issue that arises in case of an aggression 
against the Israeli or Palestinian territories. They had an 
agreement with Egypt, so there is no threat. But they insist on 
interpreting the agreement the way they want and try to divest 
it of its real substance under the claim of security. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] How would you describe the magnitude of the 
Palestinian rejectionists? 
  [Qaddumi] Everyone has the right to criticize, and the 
Palestinian people have the right to voice their opinion 
clearly. If I am one of those opposed to the Oslo agreement and 
the bad points in it, the others too have the right to object to 
it. But there are two kinds of opposition: The first is 
objective opposition. The second is non-objective opposition 
that involves insults. We are for the first. As to the 
question of the negotiations, we have accepted them as a 
political method to gain our rights, but resistance will 
continue as long as there is a single Israeli soldier in the 
occupied territories. We are entitled to defend ourselves and 
resist this occupation. So, we respect the constructive 
opposition as part of the national movement of the Palestinian 
people that plays its role the way it sees fit, and we cannot 
interfere in this. But we listen to criticism if it is 
constructive. If we believe it is correct, we must take it into 
consideration. We are going through a difficult peace process 
and tough negotiations and we do not have any other alternative. 
If we say we do not want negotiations, what would the 
alternative be? It is true that the intifadah continues. We 
have entered the negotiations to cut back on immigrants, contain 
the settlement-building activity, and take part of our land, 
albeit gradually. All this is important because time is passing 
by, the settlements are built, and the immigrants are coming. 
The settlement process has caused these phenomena to abate with 
international pressure. We are committed to the political 
settlement, but we cannot resume the negotiations before 
Security Council Resolution 904 is implemented. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] Do you think that Rabin's decision to consider 
Kakh and Kahane Hay as illegal terrorist organizations will 
affect the official conduct of the Israeli government and that 
settlers will abide by the rules to be imposed on them? 
  [Qaddumi] The trend of racism and building settlements is 
gaining strength day by day in Israel. This is what arouses our 
suspicion about Rabin's ability to enforce actual measures in a 
short time to prevent settlers from conducting acts of terrorism 
and violence against the Palestinian citizens. He will not be 
able to do that. Moreover, he does not want to take such 
measures. This is clear in his hesitation concerning the Oslo 
agreement. It showed on his face during the signing ceremony. 
He looked as though he had been dragged to Washington against 
his will by an U.S. order. This is the truth. This hesitation 
was reflected in his responsiveness to the Israeli army 
officers; he postponed withdrawal and began to impose 
unacceptable conditions during the negotiations that produced 
the foul Cairo agreement--the agreement that forced many 
restrictions on us. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] Can you specify what these restrictions are? 
  [Qaddumi] Giving the Israelis control on pathways; their 
attempts to deploy more troops around settlements; granting more 
areas to settlements; giving settlers freedom of movement; 
cutting down the area of Jericho to less than 345 square km, the 
area stipulated in the 1932 administrative division under the 
British mandate; and other things they forced on us in violation 
of the agreement. Rabin does not have the will. In the 
meantime, he schemes with senior army officers. Peres said "we 
were negotiating with ourselves." In other words, there was a 
controversy among them on the stipulations of the Oslo and Cairo 
agreements--which Minister 'Amr Musa calls the Cairo 
declaration--because it was just initialed and not fully signed. 
This agreement awaits the other part of handing over authority 
to be complete. 
  Hence, we find that the measures Rabin is taking are 
superficial and absolutely do not create a favorable or relaxed 
atmosphere to keep up negotiations. 
  The ratio of those who support the Oslo agreement has 
dropped 
to less than 10 percent, if not five percent. How can such a 
leadership lead the masses when these masses do not back the 
agreement? That is all because of Yitzhaq Rabin. This gave 
Israeli fanatics cards to play and encouraged them to commit 
acts of violence and terrorism against the Palestinian people. 
Rabin has bet on the fanatics; he has become almost one of them. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] You disapprove of the Oslo agreement, but how 
would you assess the peace process and the Palestinian 
negotiating method, both with the Israeli and U.S. parties? 
  [Qaddumi] What we see happening before us does not make us 
optimistic, something that will obstruct the peace march and 
create a tense atmosphere that may lead to an explosion in the 
entire Arab region. It will also affect Israeli society, where 
there are voices calling for removing many of the settlements, 
speeding up the withdrawal, and providing adequate security 
measures so that the Palestinians may feel that Israel is 
serious about peace. The differences within Israel will 
increase. Yitzhaq Rabin has concluded an agreement with Shas 
(an extremist religious party) under conditions that compromise 
the Oslo agreement as well as the political settlement. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] How? 
  [Qaddumi] Rabin and Shas agreed on five conditions, allowing 
Shas to continue building the settlements, stating that they are 
against a Palestinian state, and that they will continue to 
establish settlements inside the occupied territories. We have 
submitted a memorandum to the United States and Russia on this 
recent Israeli agreement. Yitzhaq Rabin is still playing games, 
maneuvering, and procrastinating. This policy and attitude by 
Rabin will destroy the settlement and will increase tension to 
the point of explosion. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] What is the scenario that you think the 
Palestinian negotiators should follow in this delicate stage of 
the negotiations? 
  [Qaddumi] To insist on the political constants and on a 
comprehensive withdrawal, discuss the settlements today and not 
tomorrow so that measures can be taken to remove them, even if 
gradually; to hand over power to the Palestinians immediately, 
and to adopt immediate measures in the occupied territories in 
general and in Hebron in particular so that our people there can 
feel that there is a desire to establish peace. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] It seems that the head of the PLO Political 
Department does not expect the self-rule talks to resume. Is 
this true? 
  [Qaddumi] That is a false statement. When we accepted the 
Madrid conference, the United States told us that something must 
be accomplished quickly, within one year: an interim 
self-government that is more than self-rule and less than 
independence. Thus, self-rule is rejected. There are twice the 
number of our people as compared to Israelis in Palestine, and 
this is clear. Thus, there must be sincerity in implementing 
this agreement so that it can be fully implemented in the end 
and an atmosphere of peaceful coexistence between us and the 
Israelis can be created, not by creating obstacles, 
difficulties, and procrastinating like Rabin is doing. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] Has the Palestinian leadership started to 
discuss the question of authority in the next stage after 
getting a part of the land back in the first stage? 
  [Qaddumi] We have a popular saying in Arabic that we should 
cross the bridge when we get to it. We are not after authority. 
We just want our land back. We want our people, who were 
wrenched from that land in 1967, to return. That is our major 
concern. Another concern is to establish the pillars for the 
security and peace of our people. After that, we can think 
about the issue of authority. We are working on constructing our 
institutions inside the occupied territories so that the people 
can take on their responsibilities fully without any pressure or 
threats. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] I would like to ask you, Mr. Faruq Qaddumi, 
about the political map of the Palestinian street with its 
various parties and currents, and whether the Palestinian choice 
during the first stage will be political pluralism or whether 
this issue is not under discussion now. 
  [Qaddumi] From the beginning, there has to be free 
democratic government and free economy. Everyone opposing this 
course will be thrown outside it by history itself. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] If you are thinking about pluralism, then you 
are proposing dissolving the PLO. Is this a possibility? 
  [Qaddumi] The PLO does not necessarily need to be dissolved. 
It is a haven for every Palestinian citizen and all the 
organizations and institutions of the Palestinian people. They 
have the right to stay within the PLO, and to discuss and 
practice their duties through the organization. It is also 
their right to explain and criticize every political decision in 
a constructive way that serves the national movement and cause. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] But what will the PLO's situation be like with 
respect to the presence of political pluralism. What is the 
proposed form for political action now? 
  [Qaddumi] It is the rule of the national front. During the 
liberation phase, the national front will be formed. We insist 
on the participation of all parties in this front. They are our 
partners and have contributed toward the national struggle. 
They participated with us in decisionmaking. It is their right 
to work within the framework of this organization and to have 
their specific responsibilities. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] Very often in writings about the question of 
Palestine and in talk among the Palestinian people, discussions 
touch on the dictatorship in Palestinian decisionmaking. How 
true is this and how can one avert it, if it is actually present? 
  [Qaddumi] In the stage of national struggle, central 
democracy is the prevalent principle. To a large extent, it is 
similar not to dictatorship, but is based on the national front 
which will run all affairs. 
  However, we are on the threshold of a new phase, during 
which we need to preserve freedom of speech and political 
pluralism, as well as freedom to criticize and freedom of choice 
for the Palestinian people. In other words, these democratic 
features need to be adopted and the people need to feel that. 
At the same time, we have all really started practicing them. 
The issue of democracy is very important and we should not 
close our eyes to it, to pluralism, or to free economy. In this 
way, we can contain any individual behavior. However, at this 
stage, while we are still scattered in all parts of the world, 
it is not easy for us to construct our permanent institutions. 
We are a nomadic revolution constantly on the move. When we 
settle on our land, we will build our permanent institutions and 
our democracy. 
  Such shortcomings will remain as long as we are dispersed. 
We should not be harder on ourselves than is necessary. We 
cannot hold general elections, and therefore we have to resort 
to other methods until we are able to give our people a choice. 
Our people are living under different conditions and in several 
countries. They are under political, economic, and social 
pressure because of their presence in those countries and they 
are affected by those pressures, either voluntarily or 
involuntarily. Some individual actions are caused by the absence 
of the true form of democratic unity. 
  Our conditions create many failings and make a lot of the 
actions of the leadership or individuals appear to be 
individualistic ones. This is the reality. 
  We should not evade this reality but confront it and 
continue 
our efforts in this organization and tell whoever acts 
unilaterally that they are acting unilaterally. If we look at 
the Arab region and the Third World, we can see that the 
leaderships there are not criticized as much as the Palestinian 
leadership. We are nearer to democracy in its unrefined term. 
We curse and exchange harsh words, therefore we are democrats. 
The abnormal conditions of our people have created these 
resentful ideas among the Palestinian people. We cannot change 
them until we get back to the territories and then tell our 
people: Be hard on your leadership because you are right in 
seeing we have made mistakes. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] How much are you convinced of your remaining 
involved, when you are openly opposed to the Oslo agreement? 
  [Qaddumi] Being opposed to something does not mean running 
away from the battle, regardless of the price. The Palestinian 
cause is not served through statements or press writings. To 
reach a common concept, we must get together within the 
framework of the PLO and the establishment so as to have a 
dialogue because a dialogue will remain one-sided if it is held 
through newspapers and magazines. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] What happened in the dialogue between the PLO 
and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]? 
  [Qaddumi] No dialogue between us and Hamas has been held so 
far. This does not mean that we have not made mistakes. We 
have made mistakes. But the stage is really critical and we 
must overcome many of the mistakes made by this side and the 
other side. We must sit down and have a dialogue because 
interaction can only come through a lively direct dialogue. 
Many forces are trying to damage the PLO's credibility and its 
ability to lead the Palestinian people. We want all our 
brothers to participate in this dialogue even if they are 
opposed to the Oslo agreement. 
  This is the lesser of two evils, because the PLO has lost 
Arab aid and has been besieged politically, even by the Arabs as 
a result of the Damascus Declaration after the Gulf war. Some 
of us were of the opinion that we must get out of this 
predicament. Many of us opted for the Oslo agreement, which I 
oppose, as a way out of this dilemma. But as a responsible 
leader, I cannot leave the others to navigate through the Oslo 
agreement maze. I am a PLO official and I must be with them to 
express my views frankly and clearly. 
  [Abu-Sa'dah] Even if such views are not accepted? 
  [Qaddumi] Even if they are not accepted. However, many of 
my views are beginning to find acceptance. It is becoming clear 
that many brothers have begun to realize that they were wrong 
and that they were hasty in doing this or that. One of these 
mistakes was that we made promises to some Arab states, 
including Syria, for example, that we will take their views into 
consideration. But Clinton insisted very strongly that the 
agreement be signed on 13 September. Therefore, it was not our 
responsibility. We approached Syria and Jordan. As to the 
statement that everything was done secretly, the fact is that 
there were several chances for a breakthrough in the 
negotiations after they reached a deadlock. A breakthrough was 
essential. The brothers achieved this breakthrough in the Oslo 
agreement. They made an effort. But it is not true to say that 
we lost everything, and that the Arab nation has lost the 
military option. The Arab nation was in a deep sleep. We had 
to have a breakthrough to bring about Israeli withdrawal. Enemy 
withdrawal from any inch of land is a positive thing. If 
negotiations were suspended, then immigration to Israel, the 
building of settlements, and intra-Israeli accord would have 
continued--a significant matter. We have created conflict among 
the Israelis, and this will undermine Israel from within.

  [Text] Cairo, 4 Apr (MENA)--Official Palestinian sources 
have stated that the first group of political deportees, whose 
return Israel has approved, will leave Cairo for the Gaza Strip 
tomorrow, Tuesday. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin announced earlier that 
Israel has consented to the return of 48 deportees. 
  Their return is part of the confidence-building measures 
between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples after the signing of 
the Declaration of Principles in Washington on 13 December 1993. 
  [In a related, Tunis-datelined report, Paris AFP in English 
at 1734 GMT on 4 April adds the following: "Seventeen 
Palestinian exiles left here Monday bound for their homes in the 
occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank. 
  ["The 17 were part of a group of 46 Palestinians allowed to 
return under an Israeli-PLO security accord signed in Cairo last 
Thursday. They will travel via Jordan and Egypt. 
  ["Six of the Palestinians flew in to Tunis earlier Monday. 
  ["The 11 others had lived in Tunisia since being expelled 
for 
belonging to the mainstream Fatah faction led by Palestine 
Liberation Organisation Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and participating 
in the intifadah, or uprising, in the occupied territories. 
  ["Five will return to the West Bank from Jordan via the 
Allenby bridge and the other 12 will enter Gaza from Egypt."]

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Maryam M. Shahin] </F>
  [Excerpt] Amman--A last-minute veto by Israel prevented the 
return of three Palestinian expellees close to Palestine 
Liberation Organization (PLO) chairman Yasir 'Arafat from 
joining 43 other expellees who return to the occupied 
territories today. 
  Scaled down from a list of 49 whom Israel was allowing to 
return as part of an agreement with the PLO, the 43 expellees, 
along with up to 25 family members, will enter the West Bank and 
Gaza today via Jordan and Egypt. 
  "Twenty-seven deportees will leave Jordan for the occupied 
territories on Tuesday," confirmed 'Umar Khatib, deputy chief to 
the PLO's mission in Amman. "They will take their families with 
them. The other 16 deportees in Egypt will enter Gaza from 
Egypt, also on Tuesday," Mr. Khatib added. 
  Two expellees allowed to return to the West Bank by Israel 
left to the occupied territories on Monday on their own and 
another, Mursi Abu-Ghuwaylah, is in the United states and will 
return later, said officials at the PLO mission in Amman. 
  "The list we received today did not include the names of 
Akram Haniyah, Jibril Rujub and Muhammad Dahlan," said Mr. 
Khatib. 
  The return to the occupied territories of Mr. Haniyah, 
senior 
advisor to Mr. 'Arafat on occupied territories' affairs, was 
reportedly blocked by Israeli negotiators in Cairo. "The 
Israelis felt that Haniyah was too senior, too close to Chairman 
'Arafat to go in this early," one PLO official in Amman told THE 
JORDAN TIMES. 
  Mr. Rujub and Mr. Dahlan are also close to the PLO 
leadership 
in Tunis, where they were until Monday night, according to PLO 
officials in Amman. They were seen by the Israelis as "too 
close to the leadership to return at this time," one official 
said. 
  "The three men are still in Tunis. Therefore we don't expect 
any last-minute changes," said Mr. Khatib. 
  Mr. Rujub is from Hebron, where dozens of Palestinians were 
gunned down by a fanatic settler on Feb. 25. Mr. Dahlan directs 
Fatah military operation in his native Gaza Strip from his exile 
in Tunis. 
  All three men are expected to exercise influence on behalf 
of 
Mr. 'Arafat and his Fatah factions in their respective areas 
once they are allowed to return home. According to reports from 
the occupied territories the popularity of Mr. 'Arafat has been 
waning since the Hebron massacre. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani by </F>
Nasir 'Arif in Amman; date not given] 
  [Text] ['Arif] Coordination among the Arab countries on all 
issues is of utmost importance at the present stage, 
particularly among the parties involved in the peace process. 
How do you assess such coordination at the present time? 
  [Al-'Anani] First of all, we would like to say that Jordan 
neither opposes nor does it obstruct. It has always emphasized 
the need for Arab coordination. Jordan also admits that such 
coordination should be at a high level among the Arab parties 
that are involved in the peace negotiations. 
  We in Jordan do not insist on how to carry out such 
coordination. It is irrelevant whether the Arab foreign 
ministers meet on the sidelines of the Arab League meeting, or 
hold a specific meeting for this purpose in Cairo, Damascus, or 
Amman. What is important is that such a meeting takes place and 
tackles all the issues that should be discussed. Otherwise, 
there will be an impression that there are conflicting interests 
among the negotiating countries, and this should absolutely not 
occur. 
  From this premise, and out of its awareness of the 
importance 
of this issue Jordan states its viewpoints on the stands of the 
negotiating parties and sometimes criticizes the Palestinian 
negotiating stands as such stands directly harm or affect 
Jordan's interests. However, Jordan does not reject 
coordination but insists on it, whether on the bilateral of 
multilateral level. This should be given top priority. 
Otherwise, the alternative will not produce good results for 
the entire Arab nation. 
  ['Arif] Some Arab parties which participate in the 
negotiations say that the PLO has removed itself from the 
framework of Arab coordination by signing the Oslo agreement. 
Does Jordan hold a similar view? 
  [Al-'Anani] We in Jordan do not believe the conclusion of 
the Oslo agreement is a departure from Arab ranks. This is 
because we began negotiations in Madrid and later in Washington 
with the knowledge that the PLO was negotiating on the 
transitional phase while the other Arab countries were 
negotiating for a final solution. In other words, only the PLO 
from among the Arab delegations participating in the 
negotiations had two stages; a transitional stage and a final 
stage. 
  I believe Syria's protest revolved around the fact that the 
PLO did not coordinate with the other Arab parties participating 
in the negotiations. Some frankly say that had there not been 
secret negotiations, results would not bave been achieved. 
Others say that these results were not satisfactory because 
there was no Arab coordination. 
  I conclude by saying that every negotiating party has its 
own 
interpretation and assessment. However, in the final analysis 
we do not believe that by signing the Oslo agreement, the PLO 
has violated the conditions of Arab coordination. What we view 
as an infringement is the PLO's withholding any dealings with 
the other Arab parties while it was discussing this agreement 
with the Israelis. 
  Let me say this frankly. Arab coordination requires a large 
amount of tolerance and forgiveness to enable the negotiating 
Arab parties to bring pressure to bear on those who depart from 
Arab ranks to have them rejoin these ranks. If we adopt a 
rejectionist stand toward it, it will make it persist on its 
lone course. 
  ['Arif] There were conflicting reports about the results of 
the recent visit by the PLO's representative to Jordan. How 
true is this? 
  [Al-'Anani] Mr. Hakam Bal'awi did not intend to achieve 
results during his recent visit. He came to explain the 
Palestinian stand on Resolution 904 and to brief Jordan on the 
negotiations that are taking place between the PLO and Israel in 
Cairo. 
  Mr. Bal'awi explained in detail the PLO's stand on this 
resolution. Jordan had insisted on the need for coordination 
before, during, and after the incident. The PLO representative 
understood the message very well and he will communicate it to 
the Palestinian command. 
  ['Arif] We have heard that the Kuwaiti Government has 
proposed reestablishing relations with Jordan in return for the 
Jordanian Government's recognition of the recent demarcation of 
the Iraq-Kuwait border. How true is this? 
  [Al-'Anani] This is absolutely not true. However, Jordan's 
hand is open for anyone who wants to reestablish ties with it 
without preconditions and based on noninterference in internal 
affairs. 
  If Jordan was convinced that the border demarcation between 
Iraq and Kuwait is the acceptable thing that the two countries 
have agreed upon, then we cannot but support this. However, it 
is not right to say that we are for or against, without having 
clear information about this issue. 
  In this context, let me say that Kuwait is in need of 
reestablishing ties with Jordan, just as Jordan is in need of 
reestablishing ties with Kuwait. Therefore, if the Kuwaiti 
officials think it is in the interest of their country to 
reestablish ties with Jordan, then we welcome them as brothers 
on the basis of mutual respect and each party's free adoption of 
whatever positions it deems appropriate on Arab issues. 
  ['Arif] How do you assess the meeting of the Arab foreign 
ministers held recently on the sidelines of the Arab League 
meeting? 
  [Al-'Anani] First of all, we have to bear in mind that the 
Arab atmosphere amid which this meeting was held was not good. 
There are Arab disagreements which I need not recount. The Arab 
states have failed to agree on some difficult issues which are 
difficult to agree on even when Arab states are in perfect 
accord. To agree on those issues at present will be much more 
difficult, especially amending the Arab League charter. This 
issue was discussed before the Gulf war, which split Arab ranks. 
  Despite all of this, we should develop the Arab League's 
bylaws to enable it to play its true role in the right manner 
and to serve as a mechanism of Arab support for the United 
Nations. 
  ['Arif] What about relations with the Gulf states? 
  [Al-'Anani] One cannot clap with one hand. Enhancing 
relations with the Gulf states should be mutual. If we examine 
Jordan's present circumstances and the circumstances of the Gulf 
states, we will see that the two parties need each other and 
that no one will be doing the other a favor in this respect. 
  Here, I should say that Arab relations in general between 
the 
states that export manpower and the states that had a surplus of 
cash should no longer depend on the oil aspect alone. It should 
be based on other dimensions. 
  In this context, it must be said that Jordan is not only a 
country that has extra manpower to export to the Gulf states. 
Also, the Gulf is not only a region that has a surplus of cash 
to give to Jordan in the form of aid or soft loans. The 
question is much more complex. There are strategic interests 
for all of us, primarily defending the Arab nation and its 
resources. There is also the question of peace and its 
requirements, whether we reach peace agreements or not. 
  Jordan is not an inferior country. It has an equal status to 
any other fraternal Arab country. In this context, we value and 
appreciate Qatari and Omani relations with Jordan, as well as 
the progress in relations with the United Arab Emirates. We 
hope there will be concord with the rest of the Gulf states 
because we both have mutual interests in promoting bilateral 
ties. 
  ['Arif] The statements issued by the U.S. Administration in 
the wake of Jordan's protest against the al-'Aqaba embargo 
created the impression that there will be negotiations to 
resolve this issue. Has the Jordanian Government received 
anything from the United States to this effect? 
  [Al-'Anani] First of all, we have to say that negotiations 
over this issue have been going on for a long time. So they are 
not new. Jordan has constantly been protesting the ship 
searches. However, the recent ship incident was the straw that 
broke the camel's back. Hence, Jordan's strong position and 
reaction because the question has now infringed on its 
sovereignty and dignity. 
  We play our role in the peace process out of full 
conviction that, first, a just, honorable, and lasting peace is 
important and, second, Jordan's role in this process is also 
important. We do not want anyone to think that our belief in 
these issues mortgages us to them in a way that entitles them to 
encroach on the homeland's dignity and safety. 
  Jordan will adopt an appropriate position on the U.S. stand. 
There were positive reactions by the U.S. Administration after 
this issue was protested. This administration, however, has not 
committed itself to specific dates. We hope this issue will be 
resolved quickly; otherwise, Jordan will take whatever measures 
it deems appropriate to express its dissatisfaction. 
  ['Arif] It is known that the siege on al-'Aqabah was imposed 
four years ago, and that it caused grave losses to the Jordanian 
economy. Why was this issue raised only recently and in this 
manner? 
  [Al-'Anani] This issue was raised many times in the past. 
Time, reaction, and the means of expression depend on the 
state's assessment of circumstances. Over time, His Majesty 
King Husayn has proved that he knows very well when to say what 
should be said and when to take a position. The fact that the 
reaction to this issue has been great at a specific moment does 
not mean that the event occurred all of a sudden; this reaction 
was preceded by other methods. For example, if, under certain 
circumstances, you express your dissatisfaction with something 
and demand reversing what you believe is injustice done to you, 
then you resort to various means and you should try various 
methods. If these methods prove useless, you will then make an 
appropriate decision. Hence, when the siege reached this limit, 
Jordan protested, and his majesty spoke to the U.S. president 
and the U.S. secretary of state, who both promised to study the 
Jordanian proposals. We said this would take time. However, 
when we noted that the [search] measures were escalated, rather 
than alleviated, we knew that this constituted an indirect reply 
by the U.S. Administration to our position. Thus, our reaction 
had to be very clear and unequivocal toward the U.S. 
Administration. 
  ['Arif] To what extent can Jordan continue to link the 
lifting of the siege on al-'Aqabah to the return to the peace 
negotiations? 
  [Al-'Anani] I do not like to discuss this issue at present. 
Important alternatives are being studied. I, however, do not 
want to divulge or talk about these alternatives at present. 
  ['Arif] The World Bank and the IMF make it conditional for 
Jordan to adopt certain economic policies in exchange for loans. 
Will Jordan respond to these terms? 
  [Al-'Anani] This is a political question. Regrettably, I 
believe that many economic measures adopted by the Government 
are analyzed by many critics, who lack information, as being 
imposed or not imposed by the IMF. Here, I would like to say 
frankly that this is not a scientific way of assessing matters. 
A scientific approach is to view the law from the viewpoint of 
whether or not it serves the country's interest. It is not true 
that something was imposed on us. Naturally, a state with 
approximately seven billion [currency not specified] 
indebtedness to the IMF would set more terms than other states. 
Here, let me honestly say that we ourselves should have 
implemented many policies which the IMF had requested us to 
implement. 
  Moreover, it should be emphasized that all matters agreed by 
Jordan, the IMF, and the World Bank were thoroughly discussed 
before being approved or accepted. I thus do not believe that 
matters go the way some believe. We are not "lying" on the 
ground and yielding to IMF terms. On the contrary, and as I 
said, we only agree with the World Bank and the IMF on any 
matter after a lengthy discussion. Regarding the talk that we 
should discard and ignore the IMF and the World Bank as if they 
do not exist, we frankly say that we cannot do so. 
  ['Arif] Jordan was to host an international economic 
conference. What happened to this conference? 
  [Al-'Anani] There are endless ideas in this regard. Some of 
us are surprised when we read a story or a study about this 
issue. As a matter of fact, there are many studies in all 
advanced nations about the future plans of the Middle East. We 
will only do what we think is in our interest. The idea of the 
conference was originally put forward by Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres. He tried to present and crystallize 
this idea. We do not think, however, that the time is right for 
this. Not only this. We do not have answers to give investors 
when they come to Jordan. Therefore, making this idea a reality 
is not possible at this time. 
  ['Arif] In light of the democratic and world changes and the 
requirements [istihqaqat] imposed by the peace process, what is 
the new strategy of the Jordanian media? 
  [Al-'Anani] I do not know what this phrase means. This 
phrase has been frequently used recently. I wish someone could 
tell me what it means. I will tell you, however, about the role 
of the media in the current phase. The media should serve the 
state and achieve its interests. It should air different views 
and tell the public the truth about what is happening and the 
various views regarding what is happening. In any country, 
people differ over major issues, either against the background 
of ideological differences, because they have conflicting 
interests, or for political and party reasons. The media should 
reflect world public opinion and public opinion in the homeland 
and help the homeland make decisions. 
  Second, it is the duty of the media to develop its means and 
capabilities, since we are not living alone. Jordan has a 
central geographic location and is open to all channels. 
  ['Arif] His Majesty King Husayn has recently criticized the 
official media characterizing it as "absent and lost." What 
measures will be taken to correct this situation? 
  [Al-'Anani] His majesty's position on the media is not new. 
He has said this several times in the past. I fully support 
this assessment and understand the higher national and positive 
motives that made his majesty criticize the media. This 
criticism places the Information Ministry and the officials 
before their true responsibilities. There will be a 
comprehensive media plan which we will carry out as soon as 
possible. 
  ['Arif] There are rumors about changes in the media leaders 
in the coming days. How true is this? 
  [Al-'Anani] No comment. 
  ['Arif] Jordanian journalists accuse the Information 
Ministry of facilitating the mission of foreign journalists 
without providing the same facilities to them. How do you reply? 
  [Al-'Anani] Personally, I do not think so. 
  ['Arif] Much has been said about a plan to turn the Radio 
and Television Corporation into an independent entity. When 
will this happen? 
  [Al-'Anani] I want to say one thing. We have an entity 
named the Radio and Television Corporation, but this entity has 
no bylaws or board. This is what we plan to do at present. 
  ['Arif] Amnesty International has criticized the Jordanian 
Press and Publications Law, saying it contradicts human rights 
and freedom of expression. How do you reply? 
  [Al-'Anani] We reject this because this law is the outcome 
of a constitutional, legal process and it was endorsed by the 
parliament. It is, in fact, much more advanced than previous 
laws. As for some restrictions in the law, these are in harmony 
with the Jordanian climate and positions. 
  The long and short of it is that we do not need anyone to 
tell us that the Press and Publications Law agrees with or 
contradicts human rights and freedom of expression because laws 
are judged by the way they are implemented.

<F P=106> [Interview with Talal al-Hasan, minister of state for </F>
foreign affairs, by Safa' Hijazi in Cairo, date not given; from 
the "Arabs' Home" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Hijazi] Following Israel's appalling massacre in 
Hebron and the issuance of Security Council Resolution 904, His 
Majesty King Husayn had a certain opinion about the massacre and 
on the resolution. Could you tell us about his opinion? 
  [Al-Hasan] After the massacre that Israel committed at the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron during the month of Ramadan, His 
Majesty King Husayn made several contacts about this subject 
with his brother Arab leaders in Morocco, Syria, Egypt, and with 
President Yasir 'Arafat. He also contacted U.S. President Bill 
Clinton to keep the resolution intact and to avoid any 
abstention or veto against this resolution. The resolution was 
indeed passed with a U.S. abstention on two paragraphs in the 
preamble related to the occupied Arab territories and Jerusalem. 
Thanks to the efforts made by his majesty and the Jordanian 
Government in this regard, we believe that the resolution 
contained a series of positive points that satisfied the demands 
of the Palestinian side, particularly with respect to the 
protection of the Palestinian people, the disarming of the 
settlers, and providing international protection in the occupied 
territories. It is true that the matter needs to be followed 
up. We believe that the implementation of this resolution 
requires Arab and international efforts to enforce the executive 
measures contained in this resolution, which includes a 
paragraph urging the UN secretary general to follow up the 
matter and calling upon the cosponsors of the peace process to 
implement the measures contained in the resolution. 
  [Hijazi] Do you believe that the recent Israeli arbitrary 
practices are harmful to the Gaza-Jericho agreement signed 
between the PLO and Israel? And could this agreement be 
implemented on schedule on 13 April? 
  [Al-Hasan] First of all, we in Jordan condemn any terrorist 
or arbitrary practices by Israel, because this does not serve 
the peace process. As for the Gaza-Jericho agreement, our 
position is clear. Although we were not a party to this 
agreement and had no prior knowledge of it, Jordan backed this 
agreement, in support of the Palestinian brothers, out of a 
desire to highlight the Palestinian identity, and out of respect 
for the independent Palestinian decision as well as of the 
historic responsibility undertaken by the PLO, in its capacity 
as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian 
people. Our backing for this agreement constitutes a real 
contribution to giving impetus to the peace process. We have 
always said that the Palestinian track is the core of the peace 
process. Despite the fact that we had almost reached an 
agreement with the Israeli side, we preferred to wait until the 
Palestinian brothers managed to make progress along their own 
track. When the Palestinian and Israeli sides reached an 
agreement and the PLO and Israel mutually recognized each other 
and the Declaration of Principles was concluded on 13 September 
1993 in Washington, the next day we endorsed the agenda [of 
talks with Israel]; that is, on 14 September. 
  [Hijazi] So do you expect that this initial stage will be 
implemented on 13 April despite the Israeli practices? 
  [Al-Hasan] We hope that Israel will refrain from undertaking 
such practices to make room for peace. We hope that the brother 
Palestinians will accomplish their goal; namely, to find a 
solution acceptable to them. Then, we will have done our duty 
of respecting the Palestinian decision and will, as reflected by 
their legitimate leadership.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Jordan's senior delegate to negotiations with 
Israel on water said on Wednesday [30 March] the Kingdom was not 
party to an Israel proposal to desalinate water from the 
Mediterranean Sea to meet the water needs of both countries in 
the 21st century. 
  Mundhir Haddadin, head of the Jordanian delegation to the 
multilateral working group on water, said the Kingdom had its 
own concept of integrated solutions to water shortages and had 
repeatedly turned down Israeli overtures to include it in the 
so-called "new Jordan river" project and other proposals. 
  Dr. Haddadin also said he was not aware of any involvement 
by 
any Jordanian company in the project, which was reported in the 
Israeli press on Monday. 
  "It is purely a unilateral project proposed by a group of 
academics financed by a German company," Dr. Haddadin told the 
JORDAN TIMES. "Jordan has nothing to do with it. We have 
repeatedly rejected Israeli proposals that we take part in it." 
  The purported plan was among four proposals submitted to 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin last week in light of the 
28-month-old Arab-Israeli peace talks, according to a report by 
the Associated Press. 
  The agency quoted Israeli sources and the YEDI'OT AHARANOT 
as 
saying that the proposal was made by the Israeli Military 
Industries and includes the construction of a "new, artificial 
Jordan river." 
  It would involve laying a 120-kilometre pipeline from the 
Mediterranean to a desalination plant in the Bet She'an area in 
northern Israel. The water would flow down a 320-metre decline 
and provide hydroelectric power for desalination. The clean 
water would then be piped to a long narrow dam stradd;ing the 
Jordanian-Israeli border and the new "Jordan river," offering 
water to both sides. 
  According to the report, the plan envisages that about a 
billion cubic metres of water would flow through the dam 
annually. The cost of the project was estimated at $3 billion, 
to be mostly financed by German partners, the report said. 
  Israel experts have also cast doubts on the feasibility of 
the project, which was reported as "brand new." 
  "It is not a new idea, it was first floated in 1870," said 
Dr. Haddadin, adding that he himself had presented the Jordanian 
viewpoint on the project when it was dusted off and presented 
again during recent water negotiations with Israel. 
  "There is no Jordanian involvement in the project and I am 
not aware of any Jordanian companies getting involved in it 
either, "Dr. Haddadin said. 
  Dr. Haddadin, a former head of the Jordan Valley Authority 
(JVA) and one of Jordan's top experts on water resources in the 
Middle East region, said Jordan's concept of solution to the 
water shortages in the region involved the construction of a 
pipeline canal from the Red Sea from al-'Aqabah to the Dead Sea. 
This project, estimated to cost around $1.5 billion, will raise 
the Dead Sea to its historic level and protect the ecological 
features of the area, he said. 
  Dr. Haddadin has said that protecting the ecological 
features 
of the Dead Sea was of benefit to all parties around it, 
including the Palestinians and Israelis as well as Jordan, and 
that the project could not go ahead without approval by all of 
the parties concerned. 
  The project could bring in an annual average of 1,300 
million 
metres of Red Sea water to the Dead Sea, will be a source of 
supply to desalination plants, can develop agriculture in the 
mostly arid southern regions of Jordan and also generate power, 
Dr. Haddadin said. 
  Israel informed a recent Beijing meeting of the multilateral 
working group on water that it was abandoning a similar project 
to bring Mediterranean water to the Dead Sea, Dr. Haddadin said. 
  According to reports from Israel, the government now 
considered the Med-Dead canal project as prohibitive in terms of 
cost. When the project was first proposed in the early 80s, it 
was estimated to cost $3 billion.

  [Text] Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani has said: 
We in Jordan absolutely welcome the call of Faysal al-Husayni, 
head of the Palestinian team to the peace negotiations, for the 
formation of a joint, resident Jordanian-Palestinian committee 
in permanent session. The purpose of this committee will be to 
promote joint coordination and spell out, in detail, the 
frameworks, form, and extent of joint cooperation. 
  In a statement to AL-DUSTUR, Dr. al-'Anani said His Majesty 
King Husayn and the Jordanian Government have constantly been 
calling for continued Jordanian-Palestinian coordination. He 
pointed out that the Jordanian-Palestinian committees formed 
earlier should be in permanent session to coordinate stands 
between the two sides, especially with regard to the question of 
Jerusalem. 
  He added: We are waiting for the Palestinian side to name 
the members of the committee called for by Faysal al-Husayni. 
  The Jordanian Foreign Ministry has also welcomed the 
formation of this committee. A responsible source said the 
formation of a permanent committee is very important for 
continued, fruitful Jordanian-Palestinian coordination in the 
face of Israeli policy and negotiators. 
  He added that coordination should not be limited to the 
Jordanian and Palestinian sides, but should extend to all the 
Arab parties taking part in the peace process.

  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn received at the Royal 
Hashemite Court today a number of the deportees of the intifadah 
leadership who are returning to their homeland after the 
occupation authorities allowed them to return. They thanked his 
majesty for the care they received from their brothers and 
kinsfolk here in Jordan. They also expressed their pride in and 
appreciation of His Majesty King Husayn's honorable pan-Arab 
stands toward the kinsfolk in the occupied homeland, and toward 
the Palestinian people's issues and rights. 
  Addressing the deportees, his majesty expressed his pride in 
the steadfastness of the kinsfolk in the occupied homeland on 
their national soil, and his appreciation of their suffering and 
sacrifices which, God willing, will pave the way for the 
emergence of a new dawn in the history of the nation and the 
future of its generations.

  [Excerpt] A delegation from the Hebron Governorate visited 
the Royal Hashemite Court today. The delegation represented 
various popular organizations and the families of the martyrs 
and wounded of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. It came to 
express thanks, appreciation, and gratitude for His Majesty King 
Husayn's noble and honorable pan-Arab and human stands on the 
kinsfolk in the occupied homeland and for his majesty's 
eagerness to stand on their side in all cases and under all 
circumstances. 
  Speaking at this meeting, His Majesty King Husayn said: 
  [Begin recording] Brothers, I am thankful to have this 
opportunity to meet with you today. This home is your home and 
this place is your place. No matter how I try, I cannot find 
the words to express my feelings toward the criminal massacre 
and toward the suffering of the kinsfolk and brothers in Hebron 
and everywhere in the occupied territories. You need not thank 
me. We and you are one. We support you to the best of our 
ability. With the help of God, we will continue to be as such 
as long as we are alive, and until rights are restored to their 
rightful owners--our kinsfolk, beloved ones, and brothers--in 
the Palestinian territories. Please convey to the kinsfolk all 
love and appreciation. I take pride in our kinsfolk and 
appreciate their patience and endurance in the face of ordeals, 
challenges, and sacrifices. Their sacrifices are made for the 
sake of the Arab nation and for a future of justice, wellbeing, 
and prosperity for the coming generations on their national soil. 
  May God bless you. Please convey to everyone that we here 
are constantly for them and with them. We are confident that 
justice will eventually prevail. If there is any way that we 
can do anything, anytime, we beseech God to help us. I hope 
that my kinsfolk and brothers here will bring to my attention 
anything we can do to ease the suffering of the kinsfolk who 
were injured and suffered. As for the martyrs, they have 
preceded us down the path of martyrdom. They have fallen in the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque, near the forefather of the prophets 
[Abraham], in Ramadan, and at the dawn of a Friday. Thus, they 
have gone to heaven. I beseech God to make us among the 
righteous martyrs in defense of the Arab nation and its rights. 
I pray that God will inspire and help the revival of an 
imminent Arab awakening to restore to this nation its status 
among other nations, so that our nation, which is part of the 
Islamic nation, will become the best nation on earth, as God 
Almighty has wanted it to be. 
  If we fail to do anything, significant or trivial, forgive 
us 
and alert us, because nobody matches us in our eagerness to be 
with you and on your side, as we have always been in all cases 
and under all circumstances. National unity is not just 
necessary, it is imperative; we are one small family within a 
larger family, which is the Arab family. It is our destiny to 
face challenges and dangers, to suffer, and to offer martyrs. 
All this is an honor to us. I pray that the time will come 
when everyone will appreciate the extent of what the kinsfolk in 
the occupied territories have offered by clinging to their land 
and rights, and by their steadfastness and endurance throughout 
the long march. I beseech God to help us to be always at their 
side. May God guide our steps and grant us success. Once again, 
I address every thanks, appreciation, and gratitude for you as 
you visit this home and place of yours, now and anytime. As 
long as we live, we will take pride in our being one family. 
Peace and blessings be upon you. [applause] [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Jordan's Ambassador to Yemen Dr. Fayiz al-Rabi' 
has said no final decision has been made yet on the return of 
the Jordanian military committee to Jordan, having finished the 
mission it was officially assigned. 
  In a telephone interview with AL-RA'Y, Dr. al-Rabi' said the 
Jordanian military committee is now awaiting further missions. 
This, however, is a political, rather than a military, decision. 
  Dr. al-Rabi' denied reports that the members of the 
Jordanian 
side in the joint Jordanian-Omani military committee supervising 
the implementation of the accord document in Yemen have returned 
to their country following the completion of their mission. 
  The members of the Jordanian military committee are still in 
Yemen. Only certain officers returned to Amman, having spent 
the 'Id al-Fitr holiday in Yemen, while the officers who spent 
their holiday in Jordan returned to Yemen. The members of the 
Omani Army returned to their country and no final decision has 
been made on their return or reassignment to other missions in 
Yemen. 
  He said contacts are continuing between the three parties -- 
Yemen, Jordan, and Oman -- on the future missions of the 
military committee. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Fire has broken out briefly in Amman's Forte Grand 
Hotel, killing an Italian tourist and injuring at least 10 other 
people. Security officials were able to evacuate 430 people 
from the nine-story hotel and put down the blaze in a short 
period of time. 
  An Italian Embassy spokesman identified the dead tourist as 
(Michel Otorino). He had tried to escape the fire by jumping 
from the second story. Thick smoke reached the ninth floor and 
at least 10 people were hospitalized for broken limbs and smoke 
inhalation. Security officials are investigating the cause of 
the fire. The hotel is equipped by self-operated fire 
extinguishers, but were not used due to panic that gripped the 
hotel staff.

  [Text] The seventh Pan-African Congress convened in 
Kampala, the capital of Uganda, today in the presence of top 
officials from various countries and representatives of regional 
and international organizations. 
  According to a Central News Unit correspondent's report 
Foreign Minister Velayati, who is taking part in the Congress at 
the invitation of the Ugandan Government, said in a speech at 
the session: The revival of Islam is one of the most successful 
replies to the rule of colonialist powers. It is the Islamic 
movements which are leading the struggle against foreign rule. 
  Mr Velayati described the special circumstances of the Third 
World countries, particularly African countries, in global 
equations and referred to the conspiracies of hegemonistic 
powers to plunder their wealth. He said: In the past, through 
dangerous propaganda, the people of the Third World were 
estranged from their spiritual and material values. Today 
colonialist powers are resorting to fresh political, economic 
and even military means to continue their rule. 
  Mr Velayati said the South-South cooperation was a 
prerequisite to the task of the Third World countries. He said: 
Collective self-sufficiency in the Third World could be further 
achieved through cooperation in organizations such as the 
Non-Aligned Movement, the African Unity Organization, and the 
Islamic Conference Organization. 
  Our country's Foreign Minister referred to the expansion of 
Iran's cooperation with Africa after the victory of the Islamic 
revolution. He said: Iran's diplomatic relations with African 
countries has doubled in the past 15 years. We are actively 
taking part in the development programs of African countries. 
  Referring to the severance of relations between the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and the racist regime of South Africa he said: 
Iran continues to give the necessary support to freedom-seeking 
struggles in Africa, such as the struggle of the Namibian 
nation. We hope that, from now on, through unity and 
understanding, especially amongst the majority of the deprived 
peoples of South Africa, the dark days of racism come to an end 
in that country, too.

  [Text] The pilgrimage to the House of God is a religious 
and political duty demanded of world Muslims by the blessed and 
supreme God who ordered his great prophet to declare the 
necessity of Muslims departing toward this house from the 
furtherest corners of the world. While no one has the right to 
question and doubt the necessity of this great duty and while 
the need to adhere to this religious rite has an ever increasing 
importance in today's world, is it right for some to obstruct 
the path of departure of Muslims toward the House of God and to 
be among those who obstruct the path of God and who hinder the 
departure toward this House? 
  While some holy and religious cities easily welcome and 
house 
over two million pilgrims a day throughout the year, is it 
dignified for an Islamic country such as Saudi Arabia, which 
enjoys so much God-given wealth, to claim that it is not able to 
provide suitable and necessary services for the pilgrims of the 
House of God? Is it basically befitting for a wealthy country 
such as Saudi Arabia to express inability and impotence in 
providing services at the time of this religious duty of world 
Muslim people? 
  If there really is a disability in the management of the 
holy 
sanctuaries and in provision of services to the pilgrims, it 
would be suitable for this to be announced to Islamic 
governments so that the affluent and able Islamic countries can 
come to aid and assist the government of Arabia in a decent 
administration of the pilgrimage duty. However, to prevent the 
departure of enthusiastic Iranian pilgrims, who have waited for 
years for their turn to visit the House of the Friend, the 
government of Arabia has brought up the subject of accepting 
quotas of one-thousandth or a thousand pilgrims per one million 
population. 
  There are a number of significant issues involved here, the 
first of which is the fact that the quota system has no basis in 
religious laws and there are no references to this in either the 
Koran or the tradition of the prophet. To the contrary -- the 
prevention of visits to the mosques of God or blocking the path 
of God and the House of God have been the subject of rebuke and 
censure. Second, while many Islamic countries and Muslim 
nations are not able to send as many pilgrims as their declared 
quotas, should there be any constraints -- from the point of 
view of religious law -- in increasing the quota of countries 
such as Iran? Furthermore has the acceptance of 120,000 
Iranian pilgrims caused any problems in the past? 
  Why should the government of Arabia accept more than the 
announced pilgrim quotas from some other countries but when it 
comes to the Muslim people of Iran the matter is left to 
detailed accounting? It is possible to point to these nations 
-- including Egypt -- whose population is less than Iran, but 
the government of Arabia accepts tens of thousands more of their 
pilgrims than their claimed quota. 
  The other important point is that this quota system was 
planned and administered after the tragic killing of pilgrims to 
the divine sanctuary in 1987. This indicates that the 
government of Arabia has taken a political stance regarding the 
pilgrimage and is playing a political game with the religious 
duties of people. Of course, political experts and analysts 
more or less understand the sensitivity and negative 
consequences of such act. 
  While the Islamic world is facing an extensive military and 
cultural offensive by the West and its regional agents and while 
Muslims are the target of extensive anti-moral and anti-Islamic 
bombardments through satellites or books such as apostate Salman 
Rushdie's Satanic Verses and while in Bosnia, Palestine, 
Kashmir, Somalia, and Algeria world Muslim are killed by 
Westerners or their agents, is it suitable for this congregation 
of pilgrims -- which is the most important gathering and 
congress of Islamic unity against the above aggressions -- to be 
limited or for religious duties to be restrained? 
  It is necessary for the government of Arabia to look at this 
issue from a brotherly point of view -- which has always been 
emphasized by Islamic Iran -- and to remove those officials who 
might cause, even with a hint from foreigners, such unnecessary 
problems between the two Muslim nations and countries and thus 
prepare the grounds for a better administration of the glorious 
religious duty of pilgrimage. 
  Presently Islamic Iran, according to the agreement of the 
foreign ministers of the two countries in Oman, is preparing 
itself for the dispatch of 120,000 Iranian pilgrims and is ready 
to start the great operation for their transfer to Arabia. 
Arabia's adherence to the Koranic principle of fulfilling 
covenant, which is the very basis of international law and 
relations, is a religious and moral duty that will in turn open 
the way for the administration of ceremonies by the enthusiastic 
pilgrims of the House of God.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] The recent meeting of the foreign ministers of the 
Persian Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] in Riyadh has shown the 
differences in the points of view of the members of this council 
more than ever before. Saud al-Faysal, Saudi Arabian foreign 
minister and rotating chairman of the meeting, said in his 
speech: Iraq remains a threat to the security and stability of 
GCC countries. Therefore, the council's member states should 
take a unified stance toward it. 
  According to political observers, this statement is not only 
a reiteration of the previous position of this council on Iraq, 
it also points to the relations between Qatar and Oman, which 
have in the past year expanded considerably. Three years ago, 
during the oil Gulf war, in opposition to a GCC decision, Oman 
did not sever its relations with Iraq. Recently, with mutual 
visits by officials of these two countries, their relations have 
expanded. Qatar, unlike Oman, severed its relations with Iraq 
during the oil war and took part militarily in the liberation of 
Kuwait. However, since then -- and, more precisely, since the 
border clash with Saudi Arabia -- Qatar has restored its 
relations with Iraq and is currently expanding them. 
  Another issue on the agenda of the GCC foreign ministers, 
which was also pointed out in the final communique of this 
session, was the stance of this council regarding Israel's 
participation in regional multilateral meetings, which are due 
to take place in the future in Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain. 
Multilateral sessions are basically derived from the so-called 
Middle East peace negotiations. Unlike bilateral negotiations, 
in which only the two opposing sides take part, the Zionist 
regime participates in the major multilateral sessions of Arab 
countries [as heard] and some European, American, and Asian 
countries. It is worth noting that Syria and Lebanon, which are 
themselves two major partners in the negotiating process with 
the Zionist regime, have boycotted multilateral negotiations. 
They believe that regional cooperation with the participation of 
the Zionist regime cannot be possible until tangible progress is 
made in resolving the crisis in the Middle East and until the 
aggressive policies of Israel are reversed. 
  A multilateral meeting on water resource cooperation is due 
to take place in Oman in two weeks' time. A similar session is 
to take place in Qatar a month later on arms control in the 
Middle East. Next fall, another session on the environment is 
due to take place in Bahrain. The Zionist regime is to take 
part officially in these meetings, which are being held in Arab 
countries of the Persian Gulf. According to political experts, 
this issue was brought up in the recent GCC session because the 
host countries of the multilateral meetings intend to act 
collectively [sentence as heard]. 
  Of course, opening the door of the region to the usurper 
Zionist regime will not have fortunate results. The negative 
impacts of such uncalculated measures will definitely engulf 
those countries that engage in political adventurism without 
taking into account public opinion. 
  Another issue that was mentioned in the final communique of 
the recent GCC foreign ministers meeting was support for the 
position of the United Arab Emirates on the Iranian island of 
Abu Musa. It is obvious that the GCC is a regional organization 
which could clearly help to resolve any misunderstanding between 
the countries of the region. However, repeating the mistaken 
policy of this council on the Iranian island of Abu Musa 
destroys the cooperation of this council in finding a solution 
to this matter. According to political experts, the GCC cannot 
take part in any political effort to solve differences until it

  [Text] Tehran, April 3, IRNA -- A morning daily here Sunday 
welcomed the last week statement by the United Arab Emirates 
(UAE) to solve the misunderstunding with Iran over Abu Musa 
island through the World Court and said it was indicative of 
peaceful coexistence with the Islamic Republic. 
  "Iran welcomes UAE's statement as a reflection of the 
maturity of that country's political system, and believes that 
any positive proposal will contribute to the final and mutually 
acceptable agreement between the two neighboring Muslim 
nations," wrote 'TEHRAN TIMES' in its editorial. 
  The Islamic Republic, added the paper, [words 
indistinct] and other regional countries believes that such 
misunderstandings between neighbors should first be resolved 
through bilateral discussion before involving international 
organizations which would act only to protect big power 
interests. 
  The article stressed that the Persian Gulf war was a result 
of the inability of regional governments to solve their own 
differences through dialogue and discussion and treat the 
dispute as a local rather than an international issue. 
  Iran had extended a hand to the UAE and had repeatedly 
stated 
its willingness to resolve the current misunderstanding with its 
neighbor through bilateral talks, said the paper adding that the 
Islamic Republic was leaving the World Court option open, but 
only as a last resort, and believed that at the moment there was 
no need to involve such organizations in this regional 
disagreement. 
  It noted that referring the disagreement to the World Court 
at The Hague would be counterproductive to the [words 
indistinct] a mutually acceptable solution and wrote that Iran 
did not wish to fan the flames of discord. 
  The paper in conclusion epressed hope that the UAE would 
further prove its political maturity and independence, and 
create an abundance of good will by warmly shaking the friendly 
hand extended by Iran, rather than brushing it aside.

presided over by Deputy Speaker Movahhedi-Kermani, the bill for 
the amendment of Article 17 of the courts' appeal law, approved 
in Mordad 1372 [month beginning 23 July 1993], was approved

session, over 150 Majles deputies conveyed their condolences to 
the families and friends of the victims of the downing of an 
Iranian C- 130 aircraft in the Karabakh region, and described 
the Armenian Army as the main cause of the incident and voiced 
their protest over the silence of international organizations in 
response to this incident. 
  In the letter, the Majles deputies called on the Armenian 
Government to give an explicit response on this issue and also 
called on our country's Foreign Ministry to pursue the matter in 
earnest. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said this morning 
that anyone who thought that the negotiations with the 
Palestinians could be concluded within a matter of days was 
wrong. Rabin said that there is no room for a meeting between 
himself and Yasir 'Arafat at the present time. 
  [Begin recording] [Rabin] Did anyone expect some kind of 
hocus-pocus? Anyone who thought that everything could be 
wrapped up within two or six days was simply wrong and did not 
understand the situation. If an agreement is not reached or, at 
least, until such an agreement is secured, we will have to 
clarify to the Palestinians how the economic side of things will 
be implemented. 
  [Economic affairs correspondent Shlomi Stein] In your 
opinion, is there room for another meeting between Yasir 'Arafat 
and yourself at the present time? 
  [Rabin] I think it is preferable to prepare such a meeting 
-- if and when it takes place -- in such a way as to preclude 
the possibility of another meeting between 'Arafat and myself 
ending unsuccessfully. [end recording] 
  Our economic affairs correspondent Shlomi Stein reports that 
the prime minister was speaking after a ceremony marking the 
sale of the Bet Shemesh engine factory to the Ormat company.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says that the 
implementation of the agreement with the Palestinians will be 
very quick and will require only a few days. Mr. Rabin said 
this during today's cabinet session. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1300 GMT on 4 April, in a 
report by Udi Segal on the cabinet session, adds the following: 
"Prime Minister Rabin said it will take a miracle to complete 
the negotiations by the middle of this month. Rabin said there 
are only six or seven negotiating days until 12 or 13 April -- 
the no-longer sacred date -- due to Holocaust Day [7 April]. 
Rabin also denied press reports on 14 April as an alternative 
option."] 
  Also in the session, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said 
that 
Yasir 'Arafat played a constructive role in the contacts 
involved in resuming the Gaza-Jericho negotiations. Security 
elements told the minister that 'Arafat's status in the 
territories is shaky. The government was also told that several 
mayors in the territories who had been deposed now want to 
resume office, like newly reappointed Hebron mayor Mustafa 
al-Natshah. Police Commissioner Rafi Peled said that 90 percent 
of nationalistic motivated murders of Israelis over the last 
year were perpetrated by Gaza Strip youths.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says if he has another 
meeting with Yasir 'Arafat it will have to be carefully prepared 
to ensure that it is not a failure like the last one. He told 
reporters this morning Israel will stand firm on the issue of 
the Qatif Bloc, in spite of the last minute demands of the 
Palestinians in the Cairo talks. Our reporter Jack Katzenell 
asked him if the talks were proceeding too slowly: 
  [Begin recording] [Rabin] There are differences of opinion, 
but I believe that we will succeed to overcome the difficulties. 
We are not expecting to achieve an agreement in few days, but 
we have agreed to start building the nucleus of the Palestinian 
police in two places in Gaza and in one place in Jericho. We 
will do it gradually. We believe that it will allow -- once we 
reach an agreement and sign it -- and help a more smooth hand 
over of the responsibilities that will be transferred from the 
Civil Administration and the military government to the 
Palestinian authority. 
  [Katzenell] If Israel allows the Palestinians to deploy bit 
by bit in this way, will it not in the end force our hand? Can 
Israel hold the Palestinians to their promises about all the 
limitations on the Palestinian police? 
  [Rabin] Well, I believe that the bringing of a few dozen 
Palestinian police to these places -- to each one of them, every 
one of them -- will not undermine our capability to reach the 
agreement that we want, so that our vital interest will be 
served. 
  [Katzenell] Is Israel standing firm on the issue of the 
Qatif Bloc and the idea of its being one single bloc which the 
Palestinian police cannot enter? 
  [Rabin] We signed an agreement in Cairo, including attached 
maps. Of course, everything is dependent on the conclusion of 
the agreement; but the maps were signed and we take them as they 
signed as the basis for whatever will develop. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Israel has changed its stand regarding Russia's 
involvement in the peace process. This emerges from remarks 
made by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres in yesterday's cabinet session. Peres said that 
"we should treat the Russians with respect," reminding the 
ministers that there are 1.5 million Jews in Russia. "We have 
no business expressing reservations about Russia's involvement," 
he said. 
  Rabin said that the United States praised the role the 
Russians played in the activity vis-a-vis the Serbs in the 
Bosnia crisis. "We have special relations with the United 
States, expressed through aid and strategic cooperation, but 
Russian foreign policy is more active than in the past and is 
not negative," Rabin said. 
  The prime minister did not reiterate the claim he made 
during 
the past several weeks that Russia should coordinate its moves 
on the peace process with the United States. [passage omitted]

with Viktor Posuvalyuk, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's 
Middle East Department. The Russian official, who arrived in 
the Middle East as the special envoy of President Yeltsin, 
briefed Rabin about his meetings in Tunis and Jordan. Our 
political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that in the meeting, 
Posuvalyuk made it clear that Russia wants to preserve a neutral 
attitude in the Middle East political process and is interested 
in coordinating positions with the United States in the 
political negotiations.

  [Text] President Yeltsin's envoy, Viktor Posuvalyuk, said 
he has been warmly received in Israel. In an interview with 
Jack Katzenell, Posuvalyuk said Russia is coordinating its 
Middle East policy with the United States. He dismissed the 
suggestion that Yasir 'Arafat is trying to exploit the 
traditional rivalry between the two superpowers to obtain last 
minute concessions from Israel. 
  [Begin recording] [Posuvalyuk] I think that Yasir 'Arafat 
adequately and in a right way understands that Russian cosponsor 
stands, let us say, in the middle between the two parties as the 
American cosponsor does. We are trying to help both parties. 
My concept is that the Israeli Government and the leadership of 
the PLO are in one boat. So, they are moving ahead with this 
peace process. They are helping each other, and they are serving 
their own interests. There is no contradiction. 
  [Katzenell] Have you had a warm welcome here in Israel? 
  [Posuvalyuk] Yes, yes. And I thank the Israeli Government 
for this warm welcome. 
  [Katzenell] What are you going to do next, sir? 
  [Posuvalyuk] I suppose in a few days, maybe -- in two or 
three days -- I am going to take part in Russian-American 
consultations on the Middle East. [end recording]

report] 
  [Excerpt] The representatives of the Foreign and Defense 
ministries of the three countries which are contributing 
personnel to the international force in Hebron will arrive in 
Israel tomorrow. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres today promised 
the Norwegian, Danish, and Italian ambassadors in Israel that 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will guarantee the safety of the 
international force. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el 
Rosen reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Rosen] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
today sought to assuage the concern of the ambassadors of the 
three countries which agreed to send observers to Hebron. For 
this reason he also summoned Major General Dani Yatom, the 
officer who will be in charge of the safety of the 160 
international observers as of next week. The complicated 
problems of coordination will be tackled, among other ways, by 
special uniforms and easily identified vehicles. Peres believes 
that the headache is not too bad: 
  [Peres] In English we refer to the temporary international 
presence in Hebron as TIPH, Temporary International Presence in 
Hebron [preceding five words in English]. In Hebrew we can 
refer to it as tipa [meaning one drop in Hebrew]. [passage

  [Text] In its session today, the cabinet decided not to 
discuss the evacuation of Jews from Hebron, and the ministers 
said that at this stage, the focus should be on promoting the 
negotiations on Gaza and Jericho. The cabinet heard optimistic 
briefings about the chances of concluding the negotiations with 
the Palestinians by the end of April. The prime minister 
expressed his fear that countries that pledged to contribute 
funds to the Palestinians might not transfer their donations in 
an orderly fashion, and that the delays might harm the residents 
of the territories and make the political process more difficult. 
  Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the 
cabinet was briefed about the difficulties in the economic 
negotiations, due to disagreements among the Palestinians. The 
cabinet was further told that U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher will apparently arrive in the region toward the end 
of the month, before the resumption of the Washington 
negotiations. In his coming tour, he will also focus on 
promoting the negotiations with Syria.

  [Text] Israel has agreed to permit the return of 47 
deportees. They will arrive in the territories in two groups. 
The first group is slated to arrive in Jericho today. 
Officials in Tunis said that in the next few days, Israel will 
present a list of another 20 deportees who will be permitted to 
return. At the same time, Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], the head 
of the PLO's Economic Department, said that the Paris 
negotiations on economic issues will be concluded before 13 
April. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Amir] The first deportees will return to 
Jericho today via Amman and the Allenby Bridge. A Palestinian 
source in Tunis yesterday said that Israel had agreed to permit 
the return of 20 deportees and would present a list of their 
names to the PLO in the next few days. The source stressed that 
in his opinion, the new list would also include Akram Haniyah, 
who was deported from al-Birah in 1988 and has since served as 
one of Yasir 'Arafat's senior advisers. Speaking over the 
telephone from Tunis, Ahmad Quray', alias Abu-al-'Ala', the head 
of the PLO's economic department, said that in addition to the 
aforementioned 20 deportees, Israel has also authorized the 
return of 47 deportees. 
  [Abu-al-'Ala', in English] I think about 47. I am not 
speaking about names; I am speaking about figures. I believe 
that all of them, if not in this group then in the other groups, 
they will come. 
  [Amir translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues] As 
for the economic talks in Paris, Abu-al-'Ala' expressed the 
assessment that the negotiations with Israel will be concluded 
before 13 April. 
  [Abu-al-'Ala', in English] I hope, and we will do our best. 
I believe that we and Mr. Shohat and the delegation, both of 
us, are concerned to finish this mission immediately so as to 
come into the implementation of the first stage of the agreement 
on Gaza and Jericho. 
  [Amir translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues] 
Jericho today awaits the arrival of the deportees returning 
across the Allenby Bridge. PLO representatives in the 
territories are preparing a warm reception; however, the Civil 
Administration has been instructed by the defense establishment 
to permit the deportees to enter Jericho only this afternoon in 
order to keep celebrations to a minimum. The IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] will probably close off the Jericho area to the 
media to prevent any coverage of the deportees' return. The 
deportees intend to hold a news conference in Jericho. Fatah 
leaders in the territories, who, on 'Arafat's instructions, have

supervision of the organization's activists in the field to the 
first representatives of the PLO leadership in Tunis. The

the arrival of the PLO leaders from Tunis, who are already 
packed and ready to move to the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
Abu-al-'Ala' estimates that the PLO leadership, led by Yasir 
'Arafat, will arrive in the territories immediately after the 
IDF withdrawal and the deployment of the Palestinian police.

  [Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 5 April in a report 
by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer on pages 1 and 19 
reports that "in his talks with Israeli officials in Tunis, PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat expressed his desire to pray at the 
Temple Mount in Jerusalem shortly after he arrives in Jericho in 
May. It has been learned that Israeli decisionmakers are 
inclined to accept 'Arafat's request." 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 5 April 
reports that "reacting to Yasir 'Arafat's desire to be allowed 
to pray at the Temple Mount mosques, Police Minister Moshe 
Shahal said that in his opinion, the time is not ripe for this. 
The police minister believes that at this stage, it would be 
best to put this off to a later time."]

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>
  [Excerpts] Special roadblocks will be set up on the day 
the territories of the Palestinian self-government are evacuated 
to prevent the entry of right-wing activists who are expected to 
carry out spectacular acts to foil the evacuation. In view of 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from Gaza and 
Jericho, the IDF and the security forces will employ special 
units to handle disturbances along the routes and at certain 
sites in the territories and inside Israel. The above details 
appear in a document obtained by HA'ARETZ. 
  According to estimates by the security forces and the 
police, 
the right is expected to stage demonstrations against the 
evacuation. At the same time, Palestinian organizations opposing 
the Declaration of Principles and the accompanying agreements 
might carry out attacks. 
  According to the plans, the Khan Yunus police station is due 
to be evacuated in five days. All the other Gaza Strip 
installments will be evacuated between 17 and 21 April. 
[passage omitted] 
  The defense establishment is anticipating riots by Israelis 
on the day of the evacuation. Therefore, it has been decided to 
concentrate large forces to handle riots by Jews along the 
routes, at certain sites, and inside Israel. On the day of the 
evacuation, the IDF, the police, and the security forces will 
takeover all the routes leading to the Gaza Strip and Jericho to 
prevent the riots. 
  Until the evacuation, the IDF will avoid initiating 
operations which might create friction with the local 
population. Activity against fugitives, mainly Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] members, will continue. The soldiers were 
instructed to avoid shooting as much as possible. New open-fire 
regulations will soon be issued. They will state that soldiers 
may not open fire at a vehicle which breaks through a roadblock, 
unless it has been established that this is a terror attack and 
the soldiers threatened with death. The soldiers were 
instructed to work for the security of the Palestinian police 
arriving in Gaza, and treat them with restraint and respect.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Foreign Ministry recently prepared its first 
working paper on security arrangements for the Golan Heights in 
the framework of a peace a agreement with Syria. The document 
does not address the issue of withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
or its extent in the framework of the arrangement; rather, it 
examines the foundations of security arrangements between Israel 
and Syria, such as demilitarizing territories, thinning out 
forces, setting up early warning stations, and deploying 
international supervisors. 
  The document was presented to Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres, 
Foreign Ministry top echelons, and senior members of the defense 
establishment. The document is based on analyses of research by 
HA'ARETZ's military commentator Ze'ev Schiff and by Brigadier 
General (Reserves) Arye Shalev and which examined possible 
security arrangements between Israel and Syria. 
  Two days ago, Peres held a discussion with his ministry's 
top 
officials on an arrangement with Syria. Over the past few days, 
sources in the ministry have been saying that after completing 
the agreement with the PLO, "we will race toward Syria." 
  In the discussion, Peres told the ministry staffers to 
prepare proposals for the development of characteristics of 
normalization in the arrangement with Syria, such as economic 
ties between the two countries. Several ideas in this respect 
have already been raised at the Foreign Ministry. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Yehudit Yehezqeli] </F>
  [Text] A plan to create a new Jordan River carrying 
desalinated water from the Mediterranean Sea was presented last 
Wednesday [23 March] to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Dan 
Shomron, chairman of Israel Military Industries, a co-partner in 
the project put forth together with a Jordanian and three German 
firms. 
  The meeting was attended by the ministers of finance, 
agriculture, energy, and environment. The project, which calls 
for a $3-billion investment, would for the most part be financed 
by the German firms and would last 10 years. One of the 
partners in the project said it is designed to meet the water 
requirements of Israel and Jordan upon the advent of the 21st 
century. 
  The plan is based on the original idea conceived decades ago 
by the Israeli engineer Shlomo Gur. Its main components are: 
  Water from the Mediterranean Sea would be carried in a 
63-km-long canal from the 'Atlit area to Ramat Tzvi, north of 
Bet She'an. From this point, the water would flow in a pipe to 
the desalination site, 5 km from Ramat Tzvi, and would drop from 
an altitude of 320 meters. The desalination facility would be 
built near Kibbutz Ma'oz Hayyim, on both sides of the Jordan 
River. 
  The water would be desalinated in a process known as double 
osmosis, using the energy created by the difference in altitude. 
Hence, the desalination would not require electric energy and 
would cause no ecologic pollution. The water would gather in a 
dam to be built about 20 km away, in the Tall Abu-Sus area on 
the Israeli-Jordanian border. 
  The lake that would be created would constitute "a new 
Jordan 
River"-- narrow, long, and deep. It would be 20-km long, 
25-meter deep, and 5-km wide and would carry 1 billion cubic 
meters of desalinated water yearly, in addition to the flood 
water now streaming into the Jordan River and getting lost in 
the Dead Sea. 
  The Dead Sea would get the additional salt settling as a 
result of the desalination process. 
  The entire project, both the pipe and the canal, would be 
170-km long. According to the plan, the cost of desalinating 
one cubic meter of water would be 50 cents, as opposed to the $1 
it costs to desalinate water by the seaside. 
  The project was drafted by Idea G.V., a company formed by 
Israel Military Industries and the German firms Proeussag (a 
steel manufacturer), Noell (a Proeussag daughter company 
specializing in hydromechanics and desalination), and Kaiser (a 
venture capital firm for special projects); and a Jordanian 
firm, seeing that the project would lie half in Israel and half 
in the Jordanian Kingdom.

    [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew on 3 
April carries several reports by legal affairs correspondent 
Mira Amsalem on the testimonies heard today by the Shamgar 
commission of inquiry into the Hebron massacre. 
  At 0700 GMT, Amsalem reports on the testimony of Tzvi 
Katzover, head of the Qiryat Arba' Council. "Katzover warned 
that more acts of despair by individuals should be expected if 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] continues to desert the 
settlers, leaving them to fend for themselves. He denounced 
Goldstein's deed, saying that most residents of Qiryat Arba' 
disapprove of it, even if they understand the reasons that drove 
Goldstein to it. 
  "Commission member Moshe Levi, a former chief of staff, 
asked 
Katzover whether the Qiryat Arba' Council had taken any action 
to get rid of people whom he suspects might carry out acts of 
despair. Katzover explained that the council had no authority to 
expel people, but that he had approached the commander of the 
Central Command and given him names of dangerous people." 
  At 1100 GMT, the radio reports that "sewage truck driver Eli 
Ganon denied allegations that he had entered the Cave of the 
Patriarchs carrying an M-16 rifle and had thus confused 
witnesses trying to identify the weapon used by Barukh 
Goldstein." 
  Ganon told the Shamgar commission that "he was not carrying 
a 
rifle on the morning of the massacre, but was only armed with a 
pistol. He added that he normally kept an Uzi submachine gun at 
home," and noted that "he did not see Goldstein on the morning 
of the massacre." 
  At 1400 GMT, Amsalem reports on the testimony of Brigadier 
General David Agmon, the chief of staff's adviser on intifadah 
affairs. "His testimony centered on the question of how Barukh 
Goldstein entered the Cave of the Patriarchs and whether it was 
reasonable to assume that he had an accomplice. Agmon stated 
that in his first debriefing to the chief of staff he had noted 
that Goldstein walked into the cave through the main entrance, 
and not through a side door. In Agmon's opinion, Goldstein 
operated alone and was armed with a Glilon rifle which was found 
in the hall after the massacre. Nevertheless, Agmon said he had 
heard from soldiers that they were used to seeing Goldstein with 
an M-16 rifle. He rejected the theory raised by Justice 
al-Zu'bi that Goldstein's accomplice was carrying an M-16 rifle 
and a bag to collect spent bullets. Justice Shamgar also 
remarked that such a possibility did not appear reasonable to 
him. 
  "Earlier, the commission heard the testimony of four of the 
10-man group of worshipers Goldstein used to pray with. They 
confirmed that only shots, not explosions, were heard in the 
cave at the time of the massacre. A discrepancy was found 
between the testimony of one of the worshipers, Yosef Nagar, and 
his deposition to the police over the question of the place 
through which Goldstein had entered the Muslim's prayer hall. 
  "Goldstein's widow, Miryam, failed to appear before the 
commission."

    [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 
1030 GMT on 4 April reports that "in this morning's session, the 
commission heard Police Inspector Leon Nadivi's ballistics 
report on the bullets fired during the massacre. He said he 
checked 115 cartridges collected in the area of the Cave of the 
Patriarchs, where the massacre took place -- 89 had been fired 
from the Glilon rifle belonging to Barukh Goldstein; 5 had come 
from soldiers' weapons; and one was fired by an unidentified 
gun. Nadivi said also that he found no indication of grenade 
explosions. Several Arab witnesses who were in the cave at the 
time testified they heard explosions of the type associated with 
a grenade." 
  Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1500 GMT on 4 April 
reports that "in today's proceedings police ballistics experts 
said one of the bullets found on the scene did not belong to the 
gun of Barukh Goldstein but remains unidentified." 
  In this afternoon's testimony, Palestinian doctors from 
local 
hospitals told the commission about delays in the transfer and 
treatment of massacre victims."

  [Text] The three terrorists killed in Hebron approximately 
10 days ago were involved in the murders of several Israelis in 
the territories. An IDF [Israel Defense Forces] spokesman 
reported that ballistic examinations of their weapons prove that 
the three men participated in the murders of Efrayim Ayubi, 
Shalom and Mordekhay Lapid, Me'ir Mendelovich, and Eliyahu 
Levin. They also participated in other terrorist attacks in 
which three Israeli citizens and six soldiers were wounded. 
  An Arab youth was captured this afternoon at the entrance to 
the Cave of the Patriarchs in possession of a knife, a 
switchblade knife, and a leaflet calling for revenge against the 
Jews. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that the youth 
confessed he had planned to stab Jews. 
  Last night, the security forces discovered an arms cache 
containing a Kalashnikov rifle, a handgun, and a large quantity 
of ammunition, in Gaza city, near the home of a local resident, 
who is a Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] activist. Our 
correspondent Moti Amir reports that the man was detained for 
questioning.

  [Text] His Excellency Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah, 
minister of state for foreign affairs, has stated that during 
the tripartite meeting among His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, 
His Excellency Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and his 
deputy 'Ali Salim al- Bid in Salalah yesterday, discussions 
dealt with the dimensions of the Yemeni political crisis. His 
excellency described this meeting as cordial. 
  In an exclusive statement to the Omani News Agency, his 
excellency Bin-'Abdallah said that after the tripartite meeting, 
a closed meeting was held between the Yemeni president and his 
deputy. He said that from a personal perspective, the meeting 
between the two sides was cordial, warm, and friendly. It seems, 
he added, that during the closed meeting, the two sides agreed 
on some principles that they believe to be necessary to prevent 
any military confrontations or a civil war in Yemen. They 
entrusted a committee from the two sides with drafting a 
statement that expresses this orientation and these principles. 
However, for reasons that we do not known, but which could be 
related to the stands of the three major parties, in view of the 
known differences already declared by all parties to the Yemeni 
crisis, members of the two sides could not agree on issuing such 
a statement during their meeting this morning. 
  In his statement, his excellency the minister of state for 
foreign affairs added that, in light of the lack of agreement 
between the commands of the Yemeni parties, despite the 
orientation of the president and his deputy to evade the 
disasters of the crisis, it seems that the commands of the 
parties have not reached an agreement yet, especially regarding 
the military issues. 
  In this regard, his excellency said: In the Sultanate of 
Oman, we hope that contacts between the parties to the Yemeni 
crisis will continue through Yemeni initiatives. 
  The minister of state for foreign affairs said: In light of 
this situation, we should hold consultations with our brothers 
in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to end our participation in 
the joint military committee under these circumstances in which 
the committee cannot assume its role with regard to the 
remaining minutes and meetings. His excellency added: This is 
caused by the contradiction in the political stands among the 
parties to the Yemeni crisis, particularly the three major 
parties. 
  His excellency said: If no political progress is achieved 
among the major parties, the military committee will not be able 
to work, and consequently, consultations with the Jordanian side 
is necessary. 
  His excellency the minister of state for foreign affairs 
noted that the brothers in Yemen should rely on their political 
efforts first and must take into consideration the circumstances 
in this difficult phase, the level of responsibility, and the 
size of tragedies if, God forbids, the crisis develops contrary 
to the interests of Yemen. 
  His excellency stressed that his majesty the sultan was very 
concerned during this meeting to help Yemen overcome this 
crisis, or at least, achieve a breakthrough. The minister said: 
I can say that a breakthrough on the personal level between the 
president and the vice president has occurred. However, he 
added, the breakthrough on the level of the three party 
leaderships needs time and determination to overcome this 
obstacle. 
  His excellency expressed his belief that the endeavor should 
be Yemeni-Yemeni first and that the party leaders must be able 
to follow the sound path, forget difficulties, and give up their 
conflicting demands because it will be difficult to achieve any 
progress on any political track.

  [Text] Muscat, April 4 (AFP)--Yemen's rival leaders, 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, failed to settle their political dispute during talks in 
Salalah south of here, an Omani government official said Monday. 
  "It appears the two sides have still not reached agreement, 
especially on military matters," Omani Minister of State for 
Foreign Affairs Yusuf Bin-Alawi Bin-'Abdallah [name as received] 
told reporters. 
  Salih and al-Bid met on Sunday in the Omani city of Salalah 
-- their first meeting since they signed a reconciliation accord 
in Amman on February 20 calling for widespread reforms. 
  Omani television showed the northern and southern leaders, 
who have been embroiled in a dispute since last August over the 
running of their country, embracing and relaxing at a dinner 
hosted by Sultan Qabus. 
  Bin-'Abdallah said Oman may pull out of a commission set up 
jointly with Jordan to try to implement the military clauses of 
the reconciliation accord. 
  North and South Yemen were united in May 1990 but their 
armies have not been merged and the south has called for 
decentralization. 
  The accord said the opposing armies should be redeployed and 
military checkpoints removed from certain areas. 
  At least 20 people were killed in clashes which broke out 
soon after it was signed. 
  Bin-'Abdallah said Oman would have to consult with Jordan, 
"to halt our involvement in the military commission, because it 
can no longer fulfill its role." 
  The commission could not function "without any political 
progress," he said. 
  "The Yemenis must make efforts themselves, the party leaders 
must resolve the difficulties and make concessions for there to 
be political progress." 
  The minister said the military commission's work was 
obstructed by divisions between the three ruling parties in 
Yemen's coalition government. 
  Salih heads the General People's Congress, while al-Bid is 
leader of the Aden-based Yemen Socialist Party, which ruled 
former Marxist South Yemen. The third party is parliamentary 
speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar's Muslim militant movement 
Al-Islah. 
  Al-Bid has refused to take up his duties in Sanaa since the 
dispute erupted. 
  Salih arrived in Doha Monday for his first visit to Qatar 
since the January-February 1991 Gulf war. 
  He was met at the airport by the Amir of Qatar, Shaykh 
Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al-Thani. 
  Relations between the two countries soured over Yemen's 
pro-Iraqi stance during the Gulf crisis which followed the 
August 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
  Al-Bid left Oman for Aden Monday, the official Omani news 
agency said. 
  More than 40 deputies began a sit-in at the Yemeni 
parliament 
in Sanaa Monday after it was announced that the talks in Oman 
had failed. 
  A participant said the protest was "against any split or 
attempt to undermine unity" in the country. 
  Other deputies were due to join the sit-in later Monday, he 
said.

  [Excerpts] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
the Yemeni Presidential Council chairman, arrived in Doha 
Airport at 1230 today on a visit to the sisterly State of Qatar. 
  His Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, amir of the 
State of Qatar, led those who received brother President Salih. 
[passage omitted on reception ceremony] 
  President Salih made a statement to the press in which he 
said: I am pleased to visit the sisterly State of Qatar and to 
meet with my brother His Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al 
Thani, amir of Qatar. 
  During this visit, we will discuss several issues that 
concern our warm fraternal relations and the spheres of 
cooperation between our two sisterly countries. I am satisfied 
with the continuous progress in these relations, which reflects 
the aspirations of the two fraternal peoples. Discussions will 
also deal with regional developments and issues that concern the 
region and the Arab nation. 
  During this visit, I will brief my brother Shaykh Khalifah 
on 
developments in our country and the efforts made to overcome the 
political crisis that is endangering unity and stability in our 
country. We appreciate the efforts the brothers are making 
toward bolstering Yemeni unity in its capacity as a pan-Arab 
achievement that should be preserved in order to entrench peace 
and stability in the region. 
  I express the appreciation of our country -- its leadership, 
government, and people -- for our brothers in Qatar, led by His 
Highness Shaykh Khalifah, for their fraternal positions toward 
our country, and their pan-Arab eagerness to safeguard the 
Yemeni unity. 
  We appreciate the Qatari brothers' support for development 
in 
Yemen, which is something that demonstrates the depth of warm 
fraternal bilateral relations. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brother Presidential Council Chairman Lieutenant 
General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih received at his place of residence 
at the Guest House in Doha this evening representatives of the 
Yemeni Community Council in the fraternal State of Qatar. 
  The representatives of the Yemeni community expressed their 
happiness over this meeting with the brother president in their 
second home, Qatar. They briefed him on the situation of the 
Yemeni community in Qatar, and also on the care and hospitality 
accorded to them by the Qatari Government under His Highness 
Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, amir of Qatar. They praised 
the fraternal ties that bind them to the fraternal Qataris -- 
officials and people. They expressed their confidence that this 
visit will contribute toward promoting and enhancing the ties 
between the two fraternal countries and peoples. 
  The representatives of the Yemeni community in Qatar also 
expressed concern over the current political situation in the 
homeland. They reiterated their adherence to our people's 
national constants, foremost among which are unity, democracy, 
and stability. 
  Brother Presidential Council Chairman Lt. Gen. 'Ali 
'Abdallah 
Salih spoke to them. He expressed his great happiness over his 
meeting with his compatriots in their second home, Qatar. He 
appreciated the strong patriotic sentiments they expressed 
toward their homeland, toward its unity, and toward the problems 
plaguing the country due to the ongoing crisis. 
  The brother president paid tribute to the positive stands of 
the Yemeni expatriates in general, and the expatriates in Qatar 
in particular, especially since their conduct reflects the 
Yemenis' nobility, as well as their cultural and humane values. 
He urged them to make greater efforts to promote and enhance 
their ties with their Qatari brothers, and to do their best to 
reinforce these fraternal ties to epitomize the ties of kinship 
between them and their Qatari brothers, given the fact that they 
are representatives of their people and homeland. 
  The brother president also addressed the current 
developments 
in the homeland, and the challenges posed to Yemeni unity and 
the Yemeni people. He reaffirmed his confidence that our people 
are, God willing, capable of coping with these challenges, 
thanks to their cohesion, solidarity, and unshakable faith in 
Yemeni unity, which is the people's destiny and fate. 
  The brother president added: I am confident that our people, 
who have managed to cope with the challenges that faced the 
Yemeni revolution [words indistinct], are capable of coping with 
the current challenges posed to unity in the same spirit, and 
with the same zeal and (?faith). 
  The meeting was attended by the members of the delegation 
accompanying the brother Presidential Council chairman on his 
current visit to the State of Qatar.

  [Text] The efforts to solve Yemen's political crisis have 
suffered a serious setback. Oman has announced that the talks 
that Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id sponsored between Yemeni President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his vice president 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
have failed to end their differences. As a result, Oman 
threatened to withdraw from the multinational disengagement 
committee that is supposed to oversee the disengagement of the 
opposing Yemeni military units. 
  The failure of the talks in Salalah raised immediate fears 
in 
Sanaa that a Yemeni civil war might erupt. 
  Both President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Sultan Qabus 
Bin-Sa'id, who saw him off, looked somber when he departed 
Salalah Airport at noon today. 
  Sources of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], led by Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, said that when President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih left his meeting with al-Bid today, he 
threatened to use force against the leaders of south Yemen, whom 
he accused of dragging the country toward partition. 
  YSP sources denied this accusation and declared that Sanaa's 
policy of oppression and its attempt to exercise hegemony over 
the south, as the sources put it, is the real threat to the 
country's unity. 
  Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yusuf Bin-'Alawi 
Bin- 'Abdallah stated that President Salih and Vice President 
al-Bid failed to solve their differences during a second meeting 
in Salalah today. He explained that they could not agree on the 
wording of a statement calling for calm in the country, 
particularly where military matters are concerned. The Omani 
minister announced that his country will consult with Jordan 
over its wish to end its participation in the joint military 
committee charged with the task of disengaging hostile Yemeni 
forces unless there is political progress among Yemen's major 
political parties. 
  Following the meeting in Salalah, al-Bid returned to Aden. 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih made a brief visit to Qatar, 
during which he met with the amir, Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al 
Thani, and senior Qatari officials. 
  Meanwhile, about 40 Yemeni deputies began a sit-in at the 
House of Representatives in Sanaa' to protest the country's 
7-month political crisis and the failure of the Oman-sponsored 
talks.

  [Text] Aden, 4 Apr (WAKH)--A responsible source at the 
Central Committee of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has denied 
that the Salalah meeting between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid was held at al-Bid's request. 
  The source added that the Salalah meeting was the outcome of 
a proposal made by the Sultanate of Oman, Jordan, the United 
Arab Emirates, and Egypt, because the four countries were 
concerned that Yemen not slide into a civil war. The source 
went on to say that these countries advised the Yemenis and the 
Yemeni leaders to opt for either confederation or federation, 
particularly since the merger unity has failed due to doubts, 
suspicion, and mistrust between the two parties to the merger 
unity.

  [Text] Damascus, April 2 (AFP) -- The official press here 
on Saturday [2 April] accused the "Zionist" lobby of helping to 
keep Syria on a US list of nations involved in the international 
drug trade and trying to sabotage better ties between Damascus 
and Washington. 
  Syria's Tishrin daily denounced "the refusal of US 
congressmen who are close to the Zionist lobby, and who do not 
really like the Syrian-US rapprochement, to remove Syria's name 
from the list." 
  Such behavior was "proof of hostile and aggressive 
intentions 
against Syria," which had taken the necessary steps to curb the 
transit of drugs across its territory, the paper said, adding 
that Syria was not a producer country. 
  Tishrin recalled that in April 1993 a law was adopted 
requiring the death penalty for those convicted of growing, 
producing and trafficking drugs. 
  A White House statement on Friday said that Syria had done 
little to combat drug trafficking. 
  The State Department had initially wanted to exempt Syria 
from the list to reward it for helping to press the Palestine 
Liberation Organization back into peace talks, The New York 
Times reported Friday. 
  But legislators denounced the State Department's 
maneuvering, 
given Syria's poor record in stopping the opium trade in the 
al-Biqa Valley in Lebanon, an area largely controlled by Syria, 
the Times said. 
  Mindful of the explosiveness of granting concessions to 
Syria, Secretary of State Warren Christopher overruled 
lower-ranking officials who had recommended the exemption. 
  Syria is due to resume bilateral peace talks with Israel 
later this month.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Just as reports began to circulate about 
a possible Middle East tour by U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher near the end of this month with the aim of advancing 
the peace process, the Israeli foreign minister said in a 
statement that major progress will be realized on the 
Syrian-Israeli track during the forthcoming negotiations. 
However, the Israeli minister did not say whether a change has 
taken place in the Israeli position that has obstructed such 
progress. 
  It is known that the Syrian-Israeli talks in particular, and 
the Arab-Israeli talks in general, have always faced the Tel 
Aviv rulers' intransigence and their refusal to discuss the most 
important aspect of the conflict -- withdrawal from the occupied 
Arab territories and the implementation of Security Council 
Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. [break in transmission] 
  The Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre dealt a strong blow to these 
talks and entrenched the conviction that Israel is not serious 
about realizing peace. This is not the first time that Israeli 
officials have spoken about progress in the negotiations with 
Syria. Such talk has never gone beyond media deception and 
negotiations tactics aimed at playing games on each track. 
  Hence, a demonstration of real seriousness about making 
progress should come through a serious declaration of commitment 
to reaching a just and comprehensive solution in the Middle East 
based on Security Council resolutions. Syria has unequivocally 
committed itself to this position. Any talk about partial and 
phased settlements, or peace by installments, is only an Israeli 
maneuver to entrench the occupation and legitimize settlement 
activities. 
  Syria has repeatedly urged the Arab parties to stick to the 
principles of the Madrid conference, the resolutions of 
international legitimacy, and the principles agreed on at the 
Damascus, Amman, and Beirut meetings. Syria has also urged the 
Arab parties to coordinate positions in a manner that will 
circumvent the malicious Israeli attempts to isolate Arab 
parties and dictate conditions on each party. 
  The Arab parties are expected to hold a meeting to discuss 
the resumption of the Washington talks in light of their 
contacts with the United States, the developments in the region, 
and the higher pan-Arab interest. It should be recalled that 
Israel is the one that has obstructed the Washington talks so 
far, and prevented the realization of the slightest progress by 
refusing to commit itself to withdraw from the occupied 
territories. 
  The area is now in need of real, just, and comprehensive 
peace. It is impossible to attain this peace without Israel's 
full withdrawal and the return of all occupied territories to 
their owners. 
  The only viable agreements are ones that realize calm, 
security, satisfaction, and peace. What we see in the occupied 
territories is the total opposite of this. Confrontations 
between the Palestinian people and the occupation forces are on 
the rise, and scores of people are being victimized daily. 
Furthermore, the occupied territories have turned into a real 
battlefield. Therefore, where is peace in all of this? 
  In response to [Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on] Peres' 
optimism, we say that progress in the talks with Syria and the 
other parties depends on Israel's full withdrawal from the Golan 
and the occupied Arab territories, and the full implementation 
of Security Council resolutions without ambiguity, and in a 
manner that gives the final say to international law and the 
principles of right and justice.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz by NATIONAL </F>
NEWS AGENCY correspondent, Ma'ruf al-Da'uq, in Beirut on 4 April 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Da'uq] Can you tell us what you discussed with 
His Excellency Prime Minister al-Hariri at this lengthy meeting? 
  [Buwayz] The meeting dealt with several major political 
issues, those concerning the regional situation and foreign 
policy and those concerning the domestic situation. Lebanon is 
undoubtedly coming to a sensitive stage as far as the [peace] 
negotiations are concerned, especially in view of the progress 
made in the Palestinian-Israeli file and the efforts being made 
to boost the negotiations. I believe the Lebanese arena should 
be fortified in a way that will enable Lebanon to deal with this 
stage using all its resources and capabilities. 
  Regarding the domestic situation and the political, media, 
and security issues, I believe that despite everything, this 
stage requires action that will enable Lebanon to get through 
this critical stage. 
  [Al-Da'uq] His beatitude the [Maronite] patriarch, in his 
Easter message two days ago, raised the issue of the Christians' 
participation and the lack of a balanced treatment of 
Christians. What is your view of this and of the patriarch's 
message? 
  [Buwayz] I do not believe anyone is saying he has achieved 
his every ambition for Lebanon, be it in relation with national 
unity, democracy, or the development of the political system. 
The crux of the matter is that this state has not inherited 
much. This state has not inherited establishments, only 
destruction and ruin. We have many more ambitions for Lebanon. 
As for the timing for achieving them, the state undoubtedly 
need not rush through each stage, but should make particular, 
constant progress toward strengthening national accord, building 
the state of institutions and the state of justice, and toward 
achieving the accurate, developed, and real representation, not 
of individuals, as much as of political ideas. 
  [Al-Da'uq] Minister, the vanguards of the Palestinian police 
started to arrive in the Gaza Strip today. Will the start of 
the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement help boost the 
negotiations, specifically on the Lebanese-Israeli track? 
  [Buwayz] The Israeli side's excuse in the previous round of 
negotiations was its inability to advance on several fronts and 
that the Palestinian file remained open, requiring it to be 
focused upon before embarking on other files. It appears now 
that this file has made some progress on its principal points. 
So we are asking what the next excuse will be. In the previous 
round, the Israeli side claimed that the Israeli Government's 
domestic position did not allow the adoption of or commitment to 
decisive decisions. Now, following the development of this 
domestic position and these new alliances we see in the Israeli 
domestic arena, we believe there can be no excuses for keeping 
the negotiations stalled and futile. We believe there might be 
some appropriate climate if the Israeli side really wants to be 
serious in the coming stage. 
  [Al-Da'uq] Minister, have you been told that the U.S. 
secretary of state might visit Lebanon during his next tour? 
  [Buwayz] I believe this tour remains vague; its itinerary 
has 
not been drawn up. 
  [Al-Da'uq] Thank you, Minister.

  [Text] In the context of the security measures that the 
Internal Security Forces and Army units are using to reassure 
the citizens, maintain stability, and punish those who disregard 
the lives of the citizens, Ba'labakk's Gendarmerie Company, 
operating under the command of Colonel Hasan Hallaq, the 
al-Biqa' area commander; and company commander Staff Col. 
Ghassan Subh, has carried out raids with the assistance of the 
Syrian Arab forces deployed in the area. The company arrested 
four individuals of the Shakar family in the township of al-Nabi 
Shit. They are Zakariya Muhammad Shakar, 'Ali Wahbah Shakar, 
Haytham Wahbah Shakar, and Muhammad 'Ali Shakar. They were 
detained in connection with the accidental fatal shooting of the 
policeman Husayn 'Ali Shakar. 
  In Tripoli a military engineer defused a small explosive 
device which had been placed in a yellow Renault 12 in the 
city's Abu-Samrah district. The device had been set to detonate 
when the accelerator was depressed. A security source said it 
is likely that the car owner was the intended victim because of 
a personal dispute. 
  In a related development, a noise bomb exploded under the 
car 
of Ahmad Tawfiq al-Barqawi al-Halabi in Tripoli's al-Mullah 
area. The incident occurred while the car owner was driving it, 
but there was only minor damage to the car.

  [Text] Minister of State 'Ali 'Usayran has said the 
government will soon issue a law organizing the audio and visual 
media and will refer it to the Chamber of Deputies for 
ratification or amendment. 
  Speaking at his home in al-Rumaylah today, 'Usayran affirmed 
that the Chamber of Deputies is the defender of liberties. He 
added that the purpose of a media law is to organize the 
dissemination of political information, not to suppress 
liberties, especially as such suppression is a fruitless 
activity in Lebanon. 
  He pointed out that during the civil war the militias 
attempted to dictate their wishes to local communities. He 
explained that all those who lived through that period know that 
the silent majority in Lebanon opposed and still opposes any 
attempt to suppress liberties.

  [Text] Commenting on the Council of Ministers' decision to 
ban radio and television networks from broadcasting newscasts 
and political programs, Hizballah has issued the following 
statement: 
  First, at a time when everyone realizes the critical stage 
through which Lebanon is passing and the tremendous role being 
played by the Islamic and national resistance in waging the 
battle of honor and existence against the Zionist occupation, 
which lies heavy on our cherished soil, at a time when the evil 
Israeli hands have started to transfer the cycle of massacres, 
killings, and destruction from the villages of the south and 
western al-Biqa' to other areas in the capital, spreading bloody 
sedition in religious places and schools and targeting innocent 
people in the holiest places, we stress the importance of 
uncovering the Zionist terrorist network and the size of the 
Israeli penetration of Lebanon so that the agents will receive 
their punishment commensurate with their abominable crimes 
committed against the society and homeland in service of the 
enemy's interests and divisive schemes. 
  Second, any decision dealing with the radio and television 
networks must differentiate between right and falsehood and must 
not imply the possibility of confiscating the basic rights of 
society represented in protecting the citizen's right to express 
the sound national stance or the objective opinion. 
  Viewing with concern the recent decisions relating to 
information, we believe that the timing of the decisions lacks 
accuracy and objectivity. Scoring great achievements need not 
be at the expense of other national gains.

  [Text] Beirut, April 2 (AFP) -- Pro-government newspapers 
in Lebanon Saturday [2 April] criticised the head of the 
Maronite Christian Church, Patriarch Nasrallah Sfayr, for a Good 
Friday speech in which he accused the Syrian-backed government 
of discrimination against Christians. 
  The AL-SHARQ daily asked whether the patriarch's homily was 
"a call to rebellion," adding that if it was, "it would be 
extremely dangerous." 
  The remarks of Monsignor Sfayr, spiritual leader of the 
largest Lebanese Christian community, "go against national 
understanding, while the patriarchate should be the meeting 
place for all Lebanese," the paper said. 
  Meanwhile, the AL-SAFIR newspaper accused Monsignor Sfayr of 
saying "things that are pleasing" to supporters of Samir Ja'ja', 
head of the former Christian Lebanese Forces (LF) militia, and 
General Michel 'Awn, the anti-Syrian former prime minister 
exiled to France in 1991. 
  Monsignor Sfayr said Friday Christians were living in 
"anguish and bitterness" because they were not treated "on an 
equal footing" with Moslems. 
  He charged that Christians did not receive a fair deal in 
the 
provision of state jobs and in the protection of property and 
said Christian leaders had been forced to leave the country. 
  "Christians are not claiming privileges and do not wish to 
impose their will on anyone. But they want to feel that Lebanon 
belongs to all its citizens, who enjoy equal rights and 
responsibilities." 
  Private radio and television stations have been banned from 
broadcasting news and political programmes since March 23. The 
government has restricted all news coverage to state-run Tele 
Liban and Radio Liban. 
  The move came as the authorities launched an investigation 
into a church bombing last month that killed 10 worshippers and 
wounded 54 others. 
  The authorities accused seven members of the Lebanese Forces 
of involvement in the attack. They arrested the group's deputy 
Fu'ad Malik and outlawed the LF, which formed a political party 
in 1991. 
  The LF was one of the militias widely held responsible for 
much of the bloodshed and destruction in Lebanon's 1975-1990 
civil war.

  [Text] Cairo, 4 Apr (MENA)--Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations resumed today to discuss implementation of the 
autonomy agreement in Gaza and Jericho. 
  The Security Affairs Committee held its second meeting this 
week [starting Saturday, 2 April]. The Palestinian side is 
chaired by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat's political advisor, while the Israeli side is chaired 
by General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of staff. 
  The committee started its meetings yesterday in 
implementation of the agreement reached between Dr. Nabil Sha'th 
and Gen. Amnon Shahaq on Thursday, 31 March. 
  The Security Committee is discussing during its meetings 
security arrangements in Gaza and Jericho and the locations 
where the Palestinian forces will be deployed, as well as the 
area of Jericho and the release of Palestinian detainees whose 
number is estimated at around 10,400, according to Red Cross 
statistics. 
  The Security Committee is also discussing arrangements 
regarding the entry of the Palestinian police force to Gaza and 
Jericho. Their number is estimated at around 10,000 individuals. 
  The Palestinian-Israeli Civilian Affairs Committee also 
started its meetings this morning. The Palestinian side is 
chaired by lawyer Jamil al-Tarifi and the Israeli side by Gadi 
Zohar, chief of Civil Administration in the West Bank. 
  The Committee is discussing how to continue transferring 
power, services, and facilities to the Palestinian side. In 
previous rounds, agreement had been reached to transfer 90 
percent of the authorities from the Israeli side to the 
Palestinian side. 
  On the other hand, MENA learned that the Palestinian-Israeli 
Economic Committee will meet in Paris the day after tomorrow, 
Wednesday. The Palestinian side will be chaired by Ahmad 
Quray', alias Abu-'Ala', head of the PLO's Economic Department, 
and the Israeli side will be chaired by Israeli Finance Minister 
Avraham Shohat. 
  Palestinian sources had recently mentioned possibilities of 
transferring the venue of the Economic Committee meetings to 
Cairo.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Executive Committee member </F>
Samir Ghawshah, in Tunis, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo, date not 
given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Jundi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, what new principles 
must the upcoming Palestinian-Israeli negotiations be based on 
after a full month of hiatus following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre? How do the Palestinians envision the next talks? 
  [Ghawshah] Undoubtedly, the negotiations will be based on 
the 
practical implementation of the Declaration of Principles. But 
we can say that the new talks must focus on accelerating the 
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho as a practical 
preparation for the full implementation of the Declaration of 
Principles. This will be the first step in the interim stage 
before subsequent steps are taken to reach the final stage. 
  [Al-Jundi] Do you believe that the arrival of the first 
groups of Palestinian police in Gaza beginning on Tuesday is a 
real beginning to the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement? 
  [Ghawshah] The arrival of the first group of police is part 
of the latest agreement on the security measures following the 
Hebron massacre. We are supposed to begin these moves within 
days, on Thursday at the latest, for the entry of the first 
battalion of the Palestinian police force. We believe that this 
is the beginning of a tangible step that must be followed by 
others. We will discuss a timetable for the entry of the 
Palestinian police as soon as possible during the negotiations. 
  [Al-Jundi] Do you think that the Palestinian police force, 
still in its initial stage, can protect the Palestinian people 
under the occupation, or must international forces impose 
themselves at this stage? 
  [Ghawshah] The Palestinian police will face no problem 
except 
from one side, the armed settlers. This is a major 
responsibility that also rests on the shoulders of the Israeli 
police. International observers must be deployed in areas where 
Palestinian forces are not, such as Hebron. But for us, we 
believe the Palestinian police force, when its deployment is 
completed, can perform its duty and face all eventualities, 
including aggression by settlers, especially in Gaza and Jericho. 
  [Al-Jundi] Has the relationship among the Palestinian force, 
the Israeli Army, and the Jewish settlers been decided? 
  [Ghawshah] This is one of the points being discussed at the 
Cairo negotiations. 
  [Al-Jundi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, the Palestinians have asked 
that the Palestinian-Israeli talks be transferred to Cairo 
instead of Washington. This is because of the Egyptian 
diplomacy's clear activity in reconciling the two sides at the 
negotiating table, which is known as positive mediation. 
  [Ghawshah] There is undoubtedly a big qualitative difference 
in the role and effort. Before anything else, Egypt is an Arab 
country. It has its clear position in supporting the rights of 
the Palestinian people, and it has a positive role in pushing 
the negotiations toward the practical implementation of the UN 
resolutions, including Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. 
In addition, Egypt knows the details and it is geographically 
close. This makes the Egyptian role effective. On the other 
hand, so far the United States has not been playing its full 
role. It has not been an active partner. U.S. officials have 
often said that they would leave the Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiators without intervention in their negotiations. But the 
fact was that the Americans were biased toward the Israelis. In 
short, we can say that the Egyptian role is outstanding. The 
efforts of Egyptian diplomacy were clear in both the 
negotiations and in supporting the struggle of the Palestinian 
people until they achieve their full rights, including their 
rights to repatriation, self-determination, and the 
establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem 
as its capital. 
  [Al-Jundi] Thank you. 
  [Ghawshah] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [By Caroline Faraj in Amman] </F>
  [Text] An expanded meeting will be held tomorrow Wednesday 
[6 April] comprising representatives of U.S. Government 
departments and bodies concerned with foreign affairs to discuss 
available options concerning the U.S. Navy's inspection of ships 
bound for the Port of al-'Aqabah. 
  Well-informed sources have said that a number of concerned 
U.S. departments and institutions are trying to obstruct the 
holding of this meeting. However, the U.S. State Department 
intends to make a final decision during Wednesday's meeting. 
  A political observer believes that the U.S. State 
Department's inclination toward making a decision should lead to 
a positive one in Jordan's favor. This expected decision will 
be the result of the clear and frank stand expressed by His 
Majesty King Husayn during his meeting with ambassadors of the 
five permanent members of the UN Security Council last week. 
  The previous meeting scheduled for last Thursday was 
postponed for reasons the U.S. State Department spokesman said 
were connected with fixing an appropriate date and time among 
the bodies concerned with foreign affairs. 
  It is worth noting that three months ago Jordan proposed the 
appointment of a third technical and neutral party such as 
Lloyd's Register to inspect ships at the Port of al-'Aqabah 
rather than by the U.S. Navy in the Straits of Tiran as the 
situation is now.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>
  [Text] Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad arrived in Cairo at 
the head of a delegation yesterday afternoon and immediately 
began talks with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak. 
  In addition to the two presidents, the Egyptian prime 
minister, defense minister, and foreign minister also 
participated in the bilateral Egyptian-Syrian talks. The Syrian 
side included the vice president and the country's foreign 
minister. The focus of the al- Asad-Mubarak talks was on the 
efforts for a compromise in the Middle East, although some 
regional and international issues of mutual interest such as the 
events in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Somalia were also discussed. 
  The unscheduled visit by Hafiz al-Asad to Egypt is 
significant since within a few days Warren Christopher will be 
visiting the Middle East region to reactivate the wheels of 
diplomacy to achieve this compromise. In the course of this 
visit, the U.S. secretary of state is to strive to resuscitate 
the almost lifeless Washington- brokered Arab-Israeli talks. 
  These talks--which were resumed after a prolonged hiatus in 
the wake of Clinton and al-Asad's meeting in Geneva--were 
suspended by the Arab side after the al-Khalil [Hebron] 
massacre. Informed sources predict that after Christopher's 
visit and within the next 10 days these talks will resume in 
Washington. 
  At present, the crisis in the Middle East will play a 
decisive role in the array of political forces in this region. 
Therefore, between Tel Aviv and Damascus is Cairo, which is the 
base of the compromise and peace brokering. 
  While Damascus continues its role-playing in the peace 
talks, 
it is also a center for the Palestinians opposed to this 
compromise and is a leader of the diplomacy of intense conflict 
with the Zionist regime. On the other hand, Cairo is the base 
of the colluding Palestinians and the center of the compromising 
talks between 'Arafat and Tel Aviv. 
  Despite all this, the situation in the region, especially in 
the wake of the Cold War and the departure of the Soviet Union 
from the Middle East arena on the one hand and Mubarak's efforts 
for attaining a special position in Washington's Middle-East 
policies on the other, has brought Egypt and Syria closer 
together. In fact, whenever Damascus wishes to gauge the 
viewpoints of the United States and of the Zionist regime or to 
convey its own views to them the Damascus-Cairo axis becomes 
active. 
  Of course, the interim policies and strategies transpire 
amid these tussles, more or less. In any case, Damascus has a 
decisive role in the Middle East crisis both during wartime or 
in the course of peace talks. Neither Washington nor Tel Aviv 
and Cairo can nudge the process forward without taking into 
account al-Asad's viewpoint on regional developments, certainly 
not on a longstanding crisis such as that in the Middle East.

  [Text] Cairo, 5 Mar (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, and Major 
General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of staff, held a 
closed meeting this morning to discuss topics related to the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations currently being held in Cairo. 
  Earlier today, Palestinian and Israeli sources confirmed the 
existence of substantial differences between the two sides in 
the negotiations, particularly over the timetable for the 
withdrawal of Israeli troops, the entry of the Palestinian 
police force into Gaza and Jericho, and the arming of this force. 
  The meetings of the Security and Civilian Affairs Committees 
under the Gaza-Jericho Committee resumed this morning. The 
Security Committee is discussing a number of topics being 
disputed by the two sides, including the Palestinian police 
force's entry into the occupied territories, the exact size of 
the Jericho area, and the deployment of Palestinian forces in 
Gaza and Jericho. 
  The Civilian Affairs Committee is discussing the transfer of 
a number of powers, services, and utilities to the Palestinians 
as part of self-rule and in accordance with the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles signed in 
Washington on 13 September 1993.

<F P=106> [Reports by Muhammad 'Ali al-Qulaybi in Tunis and Ilyas </F>
Nasrallah in London: "News of a Secret Agreement Between Israel 
and the PLO"] 
  [Excerpt] An informed Palestinian source has revealed to 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the security agreement on Hebron signed 
by the PLO and Israel the day before yesterday in Cairo was 
coupled with another secret agreement between the two sides, 
details of which have not been officially announced. 
  The source said that one of the secret agreement's 
provisions 
was Israel's agreement to allow 35 Palestinian deportees, all 
Fatah members, to return to the occupied territory. It is 
believed that these deportees will constitute a part of the 
security and administrative apparatus of the Palestinian 
autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. The agreement also provides for 
the revival of the Hebron Municipal Council under the 
chairmanship of Mustafa al-Natshah. 
  According to the same source, a list of the names of the 35 
deportees is being prepared in Tunis. It is believed that the 
list will include names whose repatriation was requested by the 
PLO and rejected by Israel last year. The list, which will be 
submitted to Israel tomorrow, is expected to include Muhammad 
Dahlan, former official in charge of Fatah in the Gaza Strip; 
Jibril al-Rajub, former official in charge of Fatah in the 
central sector of the West Bank and current director of the 
commander in chief's office in Tunis; Samih Subayhat and Marwan 
al-Barghuthi, two Fatah activists who occupied the post of Bir 
Zayt University Students Union chairman at different times; 
Akram Haniyyah, former editor of the paper AL-SHA'B and current 
personal adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat; and 
Ahmad al-Dik, formerly a prominent Fatah figure in the West Bank 
and son-in-law of the late Khalil al-Wazir (Abu-Jihad). 
  It is believed that by agreeing to allow the repatriation of 
35 deportees, Israel was trying to compensate for the killing of 
six Fatah members in Gaza last Tuesday. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cautious optimism is being voiced on the Israeli 
side on the eve of the resumption of the economic talks with the 
Palestinians in Paris. Close to 70 percent of the issues have 
been finalized, and the sides plan to conclude the remaining 30 
percent in the sessions scheduled to begin tomorrow. Our 
economic affairs correspondent Shlomi Stein reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Stein] There has been a turning point in 
the Israeli position: Attainment of the economic accord is no 
longer a prerequisite for the signing of a comprehensive 
agreement with the Palestinians. Commenting on the need to 
conclude all outstanding issues before signing the agreement, 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin sounded less categorical this 
morning. 
  [Rabin] The least we need is a macro framework -- which must 
also be included in the agreement -- or temporary arrangements, 
which we could implement until a full economic accord is 
attained. 
  [Stein] In previous rounds, Israel presented to the 
Palestinians a 40-page draft accord, 70 percent of which has 
already been worked out and finalized with the Palestinians. 
Finance Minister Avraham Shohat noted today that his ministry 
has drafted a contingency plan in the event that Israel 
evacuates Gaza and Jericho before attaining a full economic 
accord and no longer has full influence over what is done in the 
field. 
  [Shohat] We have worked out an alternative, which we will 
present to the Palestinians. In practical terms, it is a 
one-sided move because it does not stem from an agreement on 
cooperation. 
  [Stein] Shohat voiced cautious optimism today, on the eve of 
his departure for Paris at the head of the Israeli delegation.

<F P=106> [By 'Abd-al-Jabbar al-Barghuthi] </F>
  [Text] Ramallah -- Fatah in the occupied territories has 
called on the Palestinian people to refrain from any ceremonial 
manifestations in welcoming the deportees who are returning to 
the occupied territories today. 
  In a statement issued yesterday, Fatah considered the return 
of the deportees to be a very small step toward the repatriation 
of all deportees, kinfolk, the displaced, and refugees to their 
homes and homeland. 
  The statement said that the Rabin government's goodwill 
should not be epitomized by the return of a number of deportees 
but by the release of all prisoners and the repatriation of all 
deportees. The statement demanded the deportees' return in one 
batch, because it said that the right of our people to return to 
their land and kinfolk is not subject to being divided into 
batches or numbers. 
  Fatah stressed that amid the enthusiasm of welcoming the 
returning brothers, our people should not forget the 
occupation's measures against them, which escalated recently. 
Since the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, 93 martyrs have been 
killed and hundreds wounded by Israeli soldiers. 
  In its statement, Fatah noted that past experience with the 
Israeli authorities, whether concerning the brother deportees or 
steps for a political settlement, prompts us to deal with any 
step extremely cautiously. We should place that step in its 
right context so that it will not be exploited by the 
authorities on the political and media levels to show that they 
had made some concessions to our people and, hence, refrain from 
restoring to us rights that have been and are being acknowledged 
by international laws. 
  The statement said that the reasons for deportation were 
merely an expression of a legal and human injustice against our 
brother deportees and our people and a violation of all 
international laws and norms, especially the Fourth Geneva 
Convention.

  [Text] In what some may regard as a positive sign, the 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] organization has welcomed 
the return of the PLO deportees to the territories. Dr. Mahmud 
al-Zahhar, one of the leaders of the Islamic Movement in the 
Gaza Strip, told IDF Radio this morning that although he does 
not believe in the political process, those promoting it should 
be given a fair chance. Our Arab affairs correspondent Netan'el 
Semrik reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Semrik] Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, one of the 
political leaders of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, has many memories 
of the time he spent at the deportees' camp at Mazra'at Bayt 
Nawfal in southern Lebanon. This morning, we called him at his 
villa in the Gaza Strip and asked for his reaction to the fact 
that the list of returning deportees does not include any 
members of organizations that have rejected the political 
process. 
  [Al-Zahhar, in English] Firstly, I would like to address the 
fact that I was one of the people who were deported since one 
year. I feel very happy on return, so I am appreciating and I 
think everybody here appreciating the return of the 
ex-deportees. We are happy for any Palestinian to come to his 
homeland. 
  [Semrik translates above into Hebrew and continues] Taking a 
very moderate tone, Mahmud al-Zahhar explained why Hamas is 
ready to give peace what he called a very big chance. 
  [Al-Zahhar, in English] We are going to give a very big 
chance for peace, but our assessment was and is still that this 
is not the proper way to achieve our basic demand. We will not 
participate in autonomy, but we will not put any hindrance for 
the implementation of autonomy. [end recording]

  [Text] Jerusalem, QUDS PRESS -- With the imminent 
establishment of Palestinian self-administration and the 
expected arrival of senior Fatah officials to Gaza and Jericho, 
site of this administration, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
has called for the election of a Palestinian national leadership 
in the occupied territories. 
  In a statement, Hamas called on all national forces and 
groups to meet and formulate a national program on the basis of 
the Israeli Army's full withdrawal, the removal of settlements, 
and the election of a national leadership that safeguards the 
right of the Palestinian people to obtaining their rights and to 
self-determination. 
  The statement proclaimed Hamas' rejection of the principle 
of 
reinstating former mayors instead of the current ones, some of 
whom were appointed by the Israeli authorities. It called for 
adopting the method of elections as the only means for choosing 
leading officials in municipalities, institutions, trade unions, 
and all popular bodies. 
  Hamas, which is resolutely opposed to holding talks with the 
Israelis, described the deployment of international observers in 
Hebron, expected to take place within a week, as a symbolic 
measure that seeks to justify the resumption of talks between 
Israel and the PLO. 
  The statement called on all Arab countries to exert pressure 
on the United States in the wake of its recent stance on 
Jerusalem, so that the Clinton administration would back down 
from this stance and declare that, in accordance with 
international law, the Palestinian territories are occupied. 
The statement urged the Arabs to adhere to the economic boycott 
of Israel and refuse to normalize relations with it.

  [Text] Gaza -- The Islamic Jihad Movement yesterday 
criticized the recent Cairo agreement signed between the PLO and 
Israel. Noting the continuing daily massacres being perpetrated 
against the Palestinian people's sons, it stressed that this 
agreement cannot protect even its supporters. 
  In its monthly statement, distributed yesterday in the Gaza 
Strip, Islamic Jihad said that the entry of the Palestinian 
police into the Gaza Strip and Jericho is no more than a failed 
attempt "to deceive the people." 
  The statement pointed out that in view of the Gaza-Jericho 
accord, the international police and forces will not be able to 
provide real protection to the Palestinian people. 
  The statement criticized the spread of large numbers of 
weapons among residents and said that honorable persons should 
not use weapons against the people. 
  The statement called on all political forces to impose on 
their cadres rules of ethics in order to confront this problem 
so that it would not turn into a muscle-flexing phenomenon and a 
means for intimidating and coercing people. 
  The statement referred to the phenomenon of killing 
individuals accused of collaborating with the Israeli security 
agencies and said that this issue is now causing great anxiety 
among the people and is raising questions and doubt about 
whether justice and truth were pursued when those executions 
were carried out. 
  The statement also noted the recent increase in strikes. It 
considered strikes to be a means for expressing rejection of the 
occupation, which should not turn into a means for proving one's 
self and factional muscle-flexing. 
  The statement called on all Palestinian factions and 
political forces to ease the burden of the masses and to refrain 
from exhausting them with more competing and repetitious strikes.

  [Excerpt] Ramallah -- A statement issued yesterday by the 
Palestinian People's Party in Ramallah on the recent Cairo 
agreement stressed that this agreement will not achieve 
confidence or liquidate settlements and that it ignored the 
provisions of Security Council Resolution 904. 
  The statement said that just as the Security Council tried 
to 
cover up the the crime, the second Cairo agreement came to 
complete the cover-up, ridicule the existing painful realities, 
recognize the status quo in Hebron, and affirm Israel's 
intention to sustain the settlers through the international 
presence and the Cairo agreement itself. 
  The statement said that the recent Cairo agreement does not 
provide any protection for the residents of Hebron and the 
occupied territories. 
  The statement noted that the removal of the settlers from 
Hebron is a necessary prelude to instilling a sense of 
confidence in the town's residents. This should be followed by 
negotiations over the dismantling of settlements in all the 
occupied Palestinian territories in respect of our people's 
right to their land and in conformity with international 
resolutions and the Fourth Geneva Convention, which forbids the 
confiscation of lands and the establishment of settlements on 
them. 
  The statement called for continued action to remove the 
settlers from Hebron as a prelude to liquidating the visible 
danger against the Palestinian people's security and their 
national rights epitomized by the presence of settlements and 
the Israeli occupation. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "We Demand That Our Delegation Be Clear and </F>
Frank"] 
  [Excerpts] Some believe that the crisis caused by the 
Hebron massacre has been resolved by the dispatch of 
international observers to this ill-fated town. Palestinian and 
Israeli negotiators are expected to resume their talks in Cairo 
on Sunday to discuss the next steps of implementing the 
Gaza-Jericho First stage. Palestinian officials have said that 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat agreed to the formula 
reached by Palestinian envoy Nabil Sha'th with Israeli 
negotiator Amnon Shahaq after obtaining "a private Israeli 
commitment" that Israel will gradually remove the settlers from 
the center of Hebron. This is what reports from the Palestinian 
side indicate, but Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres have categorically stressed that 
the evacuation of settlers from the center of Hebron is not 
included in any clause of the announced Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement nor are there any secret clauses. Here is the 
contradiction between what has been agreed upon and how each 
party interprets it! 
  It is certain, however, that the accord did not overcome the 
Palestinian people's concern for their safety or that agreement 
was reached to provide protection for them. Our people do not 
feel more secure today than before. If the agreement and the 
dispatch of international observers seek to deflect the anger 
against negotiations, what is taking place in the Palestinian 
territories reflects not only the dissatisfaction in Hebron but 
that of the entire Palestinian people with any agreement that is 
not preceded by the evacuation of settlers from the center of 
Hebron. This ordeal proves once again that the Palestinians 
faced Israeli and U.S. pressure alone, as well as that applied 
by some of the Arabs, while the other Arab states sat in the 
spectator's seat as if what is happening does not concern them 
at all. Here, we cannot but mention the stance of Dennis Ross, 
the U.S. coordinator of the peace process, in his meeting with 
President 'Arafat and the methods of pressure and warning that 
he used to force the Palestinians to return to the talks and 
refrain from inflating the Hebron massacre, as he put it! 
[passage omitted] 
  The Security Council tried to laugh at us with a resolution 
in which there was condemnation, denunciation, and high-sounding 
words. The result was that the Palestinians were forced to 
accept an agreement on Hebron that fails to respond to the 
minimal Palestinian aspirations for security and safety. What 
is the value of the international community's condemnation if it 
is not accompanied by unceasing work to implement international 
legitimacy's resolutions, foremost of all that which considers 
the establishment of settlements in the occupied territories 
illegal and an obstacle to peace? 
  We are facing a grave and delicate stage. The Palestinian 
orientation toward a settlement and peace does not mean that the 
road will be easy. There will be many stations that will 
confront our people with difficult tests, but Israel and its 
allies should not regard their methods as some kind of a sport 
where our people will accept what is unacceptable. The Israeli 
leadership should respond to the sincere Palestinian inclination 
to end the conflict so that each party will secure its rights, 
security, and stability.

  [Excerpts] Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat left Amman 
this morning at the end of a two-day visit to Jordan during 
which he met with His Majesty King Husayn and ranking officials, 
and held talks on the peace process and joint action regarding 
various issues of mutual interest. [passage omitted] 
  PLO Executive Committee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh also left 
with President 'Arafat. 
  In statements to journalists, President 'Arafat described 
his 
meeting with His Majesty King Husayn yesterday as a blessed, 
positive, and constructive meeting, especially since the talks 
dealt with Jerusalem, which is in our hearts and consciences. 
  He added: We discussed with His Majesty King Husayn ways to 
settle all important issues, and constructive cooperation in the 
economic, security, administrative, and monetary fields. 
  He said it was agreed that the joint committees will be 
immediately activated. 
  Asked about the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and the date 
of 
his meeting with the Israeli prime minister, 'Arafat said: This 
depends on the results of the current talks which have been 
taking place in Cairo for the last two days. 
  He emphasized that the Palestinian side insists that the 
withdrawal be carried out as scheduled on 13 April. He added 
that the Israelis have begun to withdraw from some bases in Gaza 
and Jericho, but there has not been official notification of 
when the withdrawal will be completed in order to deploy the 
Palestinian security forces there. 
  He stressed that the Palestinians want the return of more 
deportees, saying there is no reason to delay their return.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Distinguished Brotherly Relations"] </F>
  [Text] Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's recurrent 
visits to Jordan and his meetings with his brother His Majesty 
King Husayn reflect the distinguished brotherly relations and 
mutual confidence between the two fraternal peoples. They also 
underscore the importance of continuing coordination, 
consultation, and cooperation between Jordan and the PLO. 
  President 'Arafat's working visit yesterday came in the wake 
of important political developments regarding the various 
aspects of the Palestine question. This situation necessitated 
discussing these developments with the Jordanian leadership as 
is customary in accordance with the firmly-established 
traditions and characteristics marking the fraternal 
Jordanian-Palestinian relations. 
  The two political leaderships and peoples are aware of the 
need to intensify bilateral relations of coordination and 
cooperation out of their awareness of the difficulties facing 
the Palestinian action at this stage. These difficulties 
require entrenching unity of the Arab fold and fostering 
Jordanian-Palestinian relations in order to face the 
developments of this stage. 
  No Arab country is more concerned with or affected by the 
Palestine question than Jordan. Therefore, Jordan has always 
given Palestine--land, cause, and people--constant attention and 
sincere effort out of its eagerness to restore rights and lands 
to their legitimate owners and rescue the shrines, headed by 
holy Jerusalem, from impending dangers. 
  While watching the current developments of the Palestine 
question and while witnessing a turning point in the efforts to 
activate the first article of the Declaration of Principles, we, 
along with the brothers in Palestine, look forward 
optimistically to the day, which we hope is imminent, when the 
occupation ends and our brothers regain their freedom and right 
to self-determination.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Keeping the Channels Open"] </F>
  [Text] Despite the euphoria with which the peace process 
was greeted when it began in Madrid in 1991, no one expected the 
negotiations to bring about an immediate solution to the Arab- 
Israeli conflict. Nor did anyone believe the Arab parties to 
the talks will have identical approaches to the many complicated 
aspects of a conflict that continued to grow wider during the 
decades in which it has kept the whole region living under the 
shadow of war. 
  Differences among them were bound to develop, but common 
national interests and the necessity for a coordinated and 
unified Arab stand against an enemy which always sought to 
divide Arab ranks provided enough gurantees that these 
differences will never grow into major disagreements. 
  More than anybody else, the fates of the Jordanian and 
Palestinian peoples are inter-connected. What happens on the 
West Bank of the river will have its reverberations in the East 
Bank. So will any development in Jordan have its bearing on the 
Palestinians. That is why it is so crucial that Jordan and the 
Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) maintain open channels 
and the highest level possible of coordination. Strong 
Jordanian-Palestinian relations are a requirement by everyone 
interested in protecting the rights of the Arabs, a necessity 
that neither side can escape. Only Israel would want the PLO 
and Jordan to go their separate ways; because only Israel will 
benefit under such a scenario. 
  Jordan has, throughout the peace talks, called for a strong 
Arab front in the negotiations, emphasising more than anything 
else the uniqueness of the Jordanian-Palestinian relationship. 
In words as well as in deeds, it demonstrated its support for 
the Palestinian people and the negotiating position of the PLO. 
But we will be fooling ourselves to say that differences 
between the two sides did not emerge. It serves no purpose to 
deny that the relations were at some point uneasy, at other 
tense. But, fortunately, the disagreements have so far been 
contained and the problems not allowed to grow out of 
proportion. From that, there has been only one winner: the 
Arabs, one loser: the Israelis. 
  Hence is the importance of the visit of PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat to Jordan yesterday to discuss the Palestinian track of 
the negotiations with His Majesty King Husayn. the meeting 
would certainly help put things back in their right perspective 
and give a boost to efforts to have stronger coordination 
between Jordan and the Palestinians. The PLO can only benefit 
from hearing the Jordanian point of view on the problems facing 
its negotiators, and the Arab negotiating position can only get 
better. 
  Only through continuous contacts can Jordan and the PLO 
overcome their differences. Only by maintaining a strong front 
can the two sides make real progress in working to alleviate the 
suffering of the Palestinian people under occupation, regain 
Arab rights and advance the cause of peace in the area.

<F P=106> [By AL-MUHARRIR correspondent in Amman] </F>
  [Text] AL-MUHARRIR has learned from well-informed political 
sources in Amman that the Jordanian-Palestinian talks held 
between King Husayn and Hakam Bal'awi, special envoy of the 
Palestinian president to Amman, have not achieved their 
objectives. 
  The sources said that the Jordanian monarch expressed to the 
Palestinian official his deep resentment of the PLO's policy of 
ignoring Jordan and excluding it from any coordination although 
what is being discussed between the Palestinian and Israeli 
sides affects the internal situation in Jordan, in fact -- as 
the king said -- it is the crux of the Jordanian internal 
situation. 
  The sources disclosed that Jordan informed Bal'awi of its 
resentment over two press statements made by the PLO official 
spokesman: The first statement deals with Security Council 
Resolution 904 and includes "unjustified indications that would 
lead to an unnecessary dispute with Jordan;" and the second 
statement openly accuses the Jordanian press of being "a paid 
agent." 
  It is noted that while in Amman Bal'awi refused to make any 
statement or grant any interview to a Jordanian newspaper in an 
expression of the PLO's resentment of the unofficial Jordanian 
media. 
  AL-MUHARRIR learned that Jordanian officials indirectly 
expressed to the Palestinian envoy their dissatisfaction with 
the level of the delegation represented by Bal'awi himself. 
They told him that he is "from the people of this country," 
indicating the Jordanian diplomatic passport held by Bal'awi. 
  On the other hand, Bal'awi explained to King Husayn and to 
the Jordanian delegation whom he met the conditions surrounding 
Resolution 904, noting that the PLO is very much preoccupied and 
that most of the time it briefs the Palestinian ambassador in 
Tunisia on what takes place on the negotiations front. Bal'awi 
also said that the PLO's internal situation has brought the 
issue of coordination and dealing between Jordan and the PLO to 
the present situation. 
  Bal'awi also expressed the PLO's dissatisfaction with 
Jordan's decision to open a branch of the Bank of Jordan in 
Ramallah. He said that Jordan should have waited for the 
convening of the Jordanian-Palestinian financial committee to 
endorse such a decision. Bal'awi also expressed the PLO's 
annoyance at failing to hold the meeting for the foreign 
ministers of the cordon states scheduled to take place following 
the Arab foreign ministers' meeting in Cairo last week. Bal'awi 
accused Jordan of playing a role in this to exclude the PLO with 
the aim of forming a Syrian-Jordanian-Lebanese axis. The 
Palestinian envoy also discussed the Jordanian measures related 
to the movement of Palestinians in the occupied territory via 
the King Husayn and Prince Muhammad bridges. 
  The Jordanian side categorically denied that it worked 
toward 
the formation of a tripartite axis in order to exclude the PLO 
from any coordination, and stressed that what took place in 
connection with the meeting of the Arab foreign ministers is a 
declared Syrian stand.

  [Text] Within the framework of his eagerness to continue 
the close contacts between the government and the various 
political, economic, professional, and media organizations, 
Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali today met with the chief 
editors and columnists of the daily newspapers. Al-Majali 
frankly and clearly answered their questions on all issues and 
events, including the blockade on al-'Aqabah port, relations 
between Jordan and the PLO, the economic and financial 
situation, unemployment, the media, and other issues of interest 
to the country and the people. 
  At the beginning of the meeting, the prime minister welcomed 
the media figures and expressed his happiness for such meetings 
to discuss all important issues. These meetings are a framework 
to build bridges of trust between the government and the press 
and will eventually benefit the homeland. 
  The prime minister reviewed the issue of the blockade on 
al-'Aqabah port and the efforts exerted by the Jordanian king, 
government, and people on all levels to solve this problem as a 
result of which Jordan suffered immense material losses which 
reflected negatively on the performance of the Jordanian 
economy. The prime minister noted that His Majesty King Husayn 
clearly stated that the blockade and harassment of Jordan 
contravenes its historic role to realize security, stability, 
and progress in the region and to defend itself against anything 
that infringes on its dignity and rights. 
  On Jordanian-PLO relations, the prime minister described the 
Jordanian-Palestinian relationship as distinguished and 
brotherly. He said that Jordan has supported and will always 
support the Palestinian brothers until rights are restored on 
the Palestinian territories. Al-Majali emphasized that 
Jordanian-PLO ties must be based on the principle of 
coordination. 
  The prime minister dealt in detail with Jerusalem and its 
religious importance to both Christians and Muslims, stressing 
that there can be no genuine peace without Jerusalem. He said 
that His Majesty King Husayn reaffirmed that rule over Jerusalem 
will be for God alone and that his majesty's call did not 
materialize from a vacuum but was in answer to Israel's claims 
of sovereignty over Jerusalem.

  [Text] Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, Jordan's ambassador to the

Port will be eased soon. He also hoped that practical

  Al-Tarawinah said in a telephone interview with AL-DUSTUR 
that U.S. State Department officials have always stressed that 
the decision in this regard will be positive and that it will be 
made as soon as possible. 
  Asked about the visit to the region by the U.S. secretary of 
state, Dr. al-Tarawinah noted that the visit depends on the 
results of the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli talks in Cairo and 
the final signing between the two parties. If the signing is 
decided, he added, it will be attended by U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher. 
  Dr. al-Tarawinah added that the Palestinian side insists 
that 
the signing takes place before 13 April, however, this would be 
delayed for a week. In light of this, the U.S. secretary's 
visit will be decided. 
  Dr. al-Tarawinah noted that the U.S. secretary's visit is 
expected to take place in mid-April. In light of the results of 
the secretary's visit, he added, the date for resuming the 
Arab-Israeli talks in Washington will be set. 
  Dr. al-Tarawinah expects the Arab and Israeli negotiators to 
return to the negotiating table at the end of this month if no 
new obstacles appear.

<F P=106> [Interview with Talal al-Hasan, minister of state for </F>
foreign affairs, by Sumayyah Ahmad "during the meetings of the 
Arab Foreign Ministers Council at the Arab League headquarters 
in Cairo"-- date not given] 
  [Text] [Ahmad] Why has coordination among the Arab 
countries involved in the peace negotiations stopped? 
  [Al-Hasan] We in Jordan have always advocated coordination 
and consultation with the parties involved in the peace process 
and are dealing with this issue seriously and enthusiastically. 
We hope that this coordination will be enhanced to become an 
established and firm framework, not mere seasonal coordination. 
  [Ahmad] The Syrian foreign minister has stated that the 
April 
meeting will decide whether the negotiations will resume. Is 
this your stance too? 
  [Al-Hasan] We in Jordan are committed to the peace process 
and to any meeting for consultation and coordination in the 
sense that I have defined above. We hope this coordination 
among the Arab countries will be established to reach a positive 
stance that will help to boost the peace process and achieve 
substantial progress in the negotiations. 
  [Ahmad] Will the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre have any effect 
on the negotiations when they resume? 
  [Al-Hasan] The massacre has undoubtedly harmed the peace 
process. We hope the international community and the cosponsors 
of the Madrid peace conference, most notably the United States, 
will pressure Israel to cease its arbitrary practices. 
  [Ahmad] How tense are Jordanian-Palestinian relations? 
  [Al-Hasan] Please excuse me from discussing this issue. 
  [Ahmad] But what is Jordan's stance on the recent 
Palestinian 
statement about Jordan's reservations over Resolution 904? 
  [Al-Hasan] Jordan has expressed no reservations about 
Resolution 904 but it has its view on the Jerusalem issue. King 
Husayn contacted some of his brother Arab leaders in Egypt, 
Morocco, Syria, President 'Arafat, and President Clinton before 
the resolution was issued, with the aim of obtaining approval 
for the entire resolution without American reservations. The 
king discussed Jordan's stance on Jerusalem. I have nothing to 
add. 
  [Ahmad] Where have your negotiations with Israel reached? 
  [Al-Hasan] We approved the joint agenda last September 
following the mutual recognition between the PLO and Israel. 
The Jordanian-Israeli agenda includes the principal issues, 
such as the land, borders, water, and refugees. We are 
discussing all the points with the Israeli side but Israel must 
agree to tackle the essential issues through which positive 
progress can be made in the peace process. 
  [Ahmad] Does this mean the negotiations will stall if they 
don't deal with a solution to some of the essential issues? 
  [Al-Hasan] The peace process has achieved many positive 
things but the essential issues must be tackled so that the 
peace process can proceed. 
  [Ahmad] How do you assess Egyptian-Jordanian relations? 
  [Al-Hasan] Relations are good and coordination and 
consultations are proceeding well. We always seek to strengthen 
this coordination. I discussed with my colleague the foreign 
minister and with Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi several issues 
of common interest, including the two countries' higher 
committee. 
  [Ahmad] When will the committee meet? 
  [Al-Hasan] The date will soon be agreed through diplomatic 
channels. 
  [Ahmad] What about Jordanian-Gulf relations in light of King 
Husayn's recent visit to some Gulf countries? 
  [Al-Hasan] Our relations with Oman are always excellent and 
unique. Our relations with fraternal Qatar have reverted to 
their normal course. We hope that the positive conditions will 
emerge to return Jordanian-Gulf relations to their former state.

<F P=106> ["Special to The Star" by Bilal Hijawi] </F>
  [Text] Eight Jordanian transport and clearance agents have 
protested to the Minister of Transport over a recent Iraqi 
transport measures, which they say threatens to destroy the 
Jordanian land transport sector. 
  In a letter sent to the minister early March, the agents 
said 
the Iraqi Ministry of Transport had canceled all land transport 
contracts with Jordanian companies as of the beginning of 
January, once these contracts expired. The agents said while 
this measure was not officially announced, it was effectively 
enforced. 
  The measure, the agents said, is aimed at limiting all land 
transport contract rights, from Jordan to Iraq, to one 
Jordanian-registered company, the Iraq-Jordan Land Transport Co. 
(IJLTC) 
  The agents said they were informed of the new policy when 
they attempted to renew their bank gurantees with the Iraqi 
government one month before their expiration. Under the new 
measure IJLTC, a private shareholding company, will be the sole 
party authorized to issue Iraqi manifests in accordance with 
Iraqi laws. That authority had until last year rested with the 
Iraqi Ministry of Transport. 
  "IJLTC is thus given total authority as a legal department 
representing Iraqi government interests in Jordan," Mr. Uthman 
'Azir, of the Orient Maritime Services (OMS), told THE STAR. 
  Another regulation names the State Enterprise of Land 
Transport in al-'Aqabah as the sole agent for Iraqi imports 
through Jordan. It will be responsible for securing clearances 
and transport of cargo to Iraq.

  [Text] According to the latest reports from 'Afula, eight 
people were killed in the car bomb explosion, apparently 
including the terrorist who drove the car. More than 50 people 
were wounded in the explosion. Five people who were gravely 
wounded were transferred to the Rambam Hospital in Haifa, where 
one of them died of her wounds. Another four wounded are 
currently being transferred to the Tel Hashomer Hospital. Eight 
of the wounded were released; 33 people were hospitalized in the 
'Afula Hospital with light to moderate injuries. 
  Police Minister Shahal and Police Commissioner Peled arrived 
at the scene. Minister Shahal said that since the Hebron 
massacre the Police feared Arab terrorist attacks, and several 
attacks were indeed foiled. Commissioner Peled said that it is 
possible that as of tomorrow no vehicles from the territories 
will be allowed entrance into the Green Line, because it is 
inconceivable that Israel would allow inhabitants of the 
territories to enter the Green Line to carry out attacks. The 
issue of the closure will also be reassessed. The commissioner 
added that the timing of the attack -- 40 days after the Hebron 
massacre -- did not surprise the police, which were recently 
reinforced along the Green Line and in Jerusalem. 
  Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv reports that the car used for 
the explosion was stolen from the Tel Aviv area. Migdal Ha'emeq 
[a town near 'Afula] residents have started to congregate en 
masse, and the police are acting to prevent acts of revenge.

  [Text] A few minutes ago, Yitzhaq Rabin, the prime 
minister and defense minister, wrapped up his testimony before 
the Shamgar commission. His testimony lasted five hours and was 
given on camera. The prime minister came out from a side door 
and refused to answer journalists' questions. Our legal affairs 
correspondent Hadar Vismonsky reports: 
  Yitzhaq Rabin, the prime minister and defense minister whose 
face we did not see today at all because he walked in and came 
out through a side door to evade the cameras, gave a long 
testimony. For five long hours, Rabin was questioned on camera 
by the five members of the commission of inquiry. He was 
accompanied by the legal adviser of the Prime Minister's Office 
and by Cabinet Secretary Elyaqim Rubinstein. 
  The prime minister's testimony actually concluded the 
commission's 15th day of work and the first stage of the 
hearings. Within the next few weeks, the commission members will 
meet in order to formulate their initial conclusions and to 
decide whether any people are liable to be affected by these 
conclusions. If there are such people, they will be sent 
warning letters and be summoned for another hearing, this time 
accompanied by their lawyers. 
  As said, the first stage of the Shamgar commission's work is 
over. Over the next few weeks, the commission will proceed with 
consultations.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says he would prefer 
to advance the negotiations with Jordan at this point, but 
regretfully, that side has recently evinced hesitancy. When 
asked which country was our first priority, Syria or Jordan, 
Minister Peres replied: A great deal depends on them; we will 
be serious with whoever is serious. 
  Interviewed by our correspondent Karmit Gay this morning, 
Minister Peres called on Knesset Member [MK] Hayim Ramon not to 
quit Labor both for his and the party's sake. Shim'on Peres 
revealed that he had met twice with Hayim Ramon last week to try 
to talk him out of his plan. Peres said Ramon belongs in the 
government, and his stepping down had been a blunder. 
  The foreign minister rejected Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi 
Beilin's accusations, saying no one was pushing MK Ramon out of 
the party. 
  Minister 'Uzi Bar'am has also said that Ramon should remain 
in Labor. He criticized Labor Secretary General Zvili's 
remarks, made in Washington this morning, against Hayim Ramon.

  [Text] Knesset Member [MK] Hayim Ramon is expected to 
announce on 10 April whether he will run on an independent list 
in the Histadrut elections. Our correspondent reports that Mr. 
Ramon invited Likud MK Me'ir Shitrit to fill the second slot on 
his list. MAPAM [United Workers Party] has agreed to join 
Ramon's list, while Meretz is yet to decide its stand. 
  MK Me'ir Shetrit said he was still undecided whether to make 
the move. The Likud candidate for Histadrut chief, MK Ya'aqov 
Shamay, said Hayim Ramon's announcements might be designed to 
pressure Yitzhaq Rabin to reinstate him as cabinet minister. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin said it would be tragedy 
for the Labor Party if Hayim Ramon left it to run independently 
for the position of Histadrut chief. He believed the public 
health issues over which Ramon had waged a struggle are valid, 
but the thinking that these issues could be solved outside the 
party was erroneous. Yosi Beilin leveled criticism at senior 
Labor officials for showing Ramon the way out, as he put it. I 
would do everything possible to prevent his secession from the 
party, the deputy foreign minister told our correspondent this 
morning.

  [Text] The Israel Police are completing their preparations 
for withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Police Minister 
Moshe Shahal said today that the Israel Police would evacuate 
their personnel within the very next few weeks, rather than the 
originally planned four months. Our correspondent 'Ofer Vardi 
spoke with the police minister: 
  [Begin recording] [Vardi] Upon the evacuation and the 
redeployment in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, the Israel Police's 
Gaza District will be renamed the Shimshon District, Minister 
Moshe Shahal announced today in a meeting with journalists in 
Tel Aviv. Policemen are busy organizing the said withdrawal 
which, according to the police minister, will take effect soon. 
  [Shahal] Israel Police troops will initially evacuate police 
stations and Gaza's central prison, according to the timetable 
stipulated by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. This timetable 
will apparently be shorter than the four months originally 
planned. I believe we are now talking about very few weeks. 
  [Vardi] This fast withdrawal, however, will not change the 
Israel Police's plans to reinforce its troops in the territories. 
  [Shahal] We have started discussing the issue, but the 
debate has not yet been concluded. We are mainly dealing with 
the second phase, the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, which will call for additional troops; we are 
requesting an addition of some 1,400 policemen. Our immediate 
requirements in order to carry out first phase of evacuating the 
police stations in Gaza are: building stations in the Qatif 
Bloc, creating a police district near Gaza, integrating police 
personnel into the border terminals planned by the IDF, and 
reinforcing the border terminals in Rafah and especially at the 
Allenby Bridge especially. [end recording]

  [Text] Jericho, Occupied West Bank, April 5 (AFP) -- 
Twenty-six Palestinians who were exiled by Israel returned to 
the occupied territories on Tuesday [5 April] to bolster 
preparations for self-rule, military officials said. 
  The group, nearly all from PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's 
Fatah 
movement, crossed the Allenby Bridge from Jordan at the second 
attempt after the Israeli authorities at first refused to accept 
23 of their 46 relatives. 
  The officials said the group had completed formalities, been 
issued identity cards and would shortly pass out of the Israeli 
side of the border post. 
  Another couple of dozen Palestinians were being processed at 
the Rafah border crossing from Egypt into the Gaza Strip 
following a deal between Israel and the PLO in Cairo last 
Thursday. 
  Of the 26, one is a communist, one independent and one from 
Yasir Abd-Rabbuh's moderate Fida' group. 
  The rest are Fatah men considered vital to efforts to build 
autonomy in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
  The exiles were expelled or wanted by the Israeli 
authorities 
and had fled abroad since Israel seized the territories in 1967.

  [Excerpts] Some 51 Palestinian deportees and former 
fugitives crossed over from Jordan and Egypt yesterday evening. 
The men, many of whom will be in positions of authority under 
Palestinian autonomy, were welcomed by thousands of people. 
About 28 deportees returned via the Allenby Bridge to Jericho, 
and reporter Mark Weiss was there when they arrived: 
  [Begin Weiss recording] It was a long wait in the Jericho 
sun for the relatives and friends who came to greet the 
deportees at the Allenby Bridge crossing. Because of 
registration problems at the border, the bus bringing the 
deportees didn't cross until 8 o'clock in the evening [1700 
GMT]. Army jeeps escorted the bus by a back road to a 
restaurant outside Jericho where the men received a hero's 
welcome. [passage omitted] 
  In contrast to the group of elderly veteran deportees that 
were allowed back last year, this group is mostly made up of 
younger intifadah activists or those deported for student or 
trade union activity. They are expected to take up leadership 
positions throughout the territories, as Fatah and the other 
groups that support the peace process attempt to win over the 
population. They hope that their return is just the beginning. 
[end recording] 
  At the same time, at the border crossing at Rafah in Gaza, 
23 
deportees arrived. Dani Gur-Arye reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Gur-Arye] Palestinians destined to 
become the new bureaucrats in the Gaza Strip returned home to a 
warm reception. Dozens of friends and relatives greeted the 
returnees at the Rafah terminal, while hundreds of others waited 
outside, chanting and waving the PLO flag. [passage omitted] 
  The returnees, mostly Fatah members, have credentials both 
in 
Gaza and in Tunis. They were all grass roots intifadah 
activists, who were either deported or who fled to Egypt as 
fugitives. In their years abroad, they were incorporated into 
the PLO's leadership in Tunis. Now they are back in the Strip, 
with authority from above and with what the PLO hopes is respect 
from below. 
  The head of Fatah in Gaza, Zakariya al-Agha, describes the 
return as a positive gesture. But, he says, the Palestinians 
are waiting for more serious steps. 
  [Al-Agha] I hope that we will see in the near future the 
complete evacuation of Gaza from the settlements and settlers, 
because this is very important and this will remove a large 
obstacle from the road to attain the full peace we are looking 
for. 
  [Gur-Arye] The returnees are expected to begin working out 
of PLO offices in Gaza in the coming days. Officials in Tunis 
hope their presence will bolster Yasir 'Arafat's position in the 
Gaza Strip. [end recording]

  [Text] The multinational observers will apparently begin 
deploying in Hebron next week, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
determined today after meeting for the first time with 
representatives of the countries participating in the force. 
The foreign minister added that the 160 observers from Italy, 
Denmark, and Norway will mainly engage in administrative duties: 
60 of them will report on the situation in the field directly 
to the Israeli security forces, and the other 100 will advise 
the Israeli Government and Hebron Municipality in a bid to 
attain a normalization of the situation in the city.

<F P=106> [Article by No'omi Levitsky: "Scenario on Syria"] </F>
  [Text] The more the negotiations with the PLO on security 
arrangements in Hebron progressed, the more heads turned north 
to the main focus, Syria. When the Hebron agreement was 
completed in Cairo on Wednesday, Damascus once more drew our 
attention because since his latest meeting with Clinton, Yitzhaq 
Rabin has been fully aware that the moment of truth over the 
Golan Heights can no longer be put off. 
  And it is now clear to all, Shim'on Peres, Ambassador Itamar 
Rabinovich, the Army top brass, but more than anybody else, to 
Rabin himself, that immediately after the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
is completed, the time will come to do real business with Hafiz 
al-Asad. Clinton made it clear to Rabin: He wants a settlement 
with Syria, and fast. 
  In fact, the new fare, prepared according to an American 
recipe, is already being readied in the political kitchens. 
There are no longer semantics like: "Al-Asad must first define 
the substance of the peace and then we will define the depth of 
the withdrawal." It is no longer "the depth of the withdrawal 
will depend on the depth of the peace." The time has come for a 
new ball game. 
  It is unclear who invented this brain wave. There are those 
who point to Dennis Ross, head of the U.S. peace team. There 
are others who claim that Rabinovich presented the new formula, 
while there are still others who have once again observed Peres' 
fingerprints, since he is the most creative member of the band. 
Whatever the case, the Americans believe that a redeeming 
formula, which will extricate the negotiations with Syria from 
the deep freeze, has been found. That formula is called a 
package deal. 
  Before Passover, when Ross and his peace team came to 
Jerusalem from Damascus, they brought the al-Asad message. Up 
to then, he had also insisted on first hearing an unequivocal 
Israeli declaration that it is prepared to withdraw from the 
entire Golan Heights. Al-Asad has now changed that tune and is 
playing new music, which is very pleasant to Ross' sensitive 
ears. 
  With open glee, Ross told Rabin that al-Asad has agreed to 
talks in terms of a package deal. In other words: Peace with 
all its trappings, security and all its trappings, withdrawal, 
Golan Heights, Lebanon, and all that involves. "I believe," 
al-Asad told Ross, "that a package deal has to be offered. 
Peace, security arrangements, U.S. involvement, Lebanon, 
withdrawal, a timetable. Everything. Okay, I agree to Israel 
presenting a comprehensive package deal." 
  The Americans were thrilled. They believe that toward the 
end of summer an agreement of principles will be signed between 
Syria and Israel. They can already imagine a repeat of the 
signing ceremony for the Oslo agreement on the White House lawn. 
Al-Asad and Rabin, or Peres and Faruq al-Shar'. A boost for 
Clinton's somewhat pale image. 
  Rabin is worried. In Washington he met a restive, even 
nervous Clinton, who kept moving in his chair and who seemed to 
be suffering from a backache. The Whitewater affair, which 
refuses to vanish from the headlines, left its marks on him. 
Rabin received the impression that Clinton is looking for 
international achievements, hoping that this will deflect the 
spotlight from the unfortunate affair in which he is stuck up to 
his neck. 
  The Americans nearly always support Israel in relation to 
the 
Palestinians, yet Rabin found Clinton in a different mood in 
relation to the negotiations with al-Asad. Clinton told Rabin 
al-Asad has already said he agrees to full peace with Israel, 
and that he (Rabin) knows Israel will have to withdraw from the 
Golan. He (Clinton) therefore fails to understand why Israel 
refuses to finalize things and sign the agreement. Rabin told 
Clinton there are security problems. Clinton answered that in 
the security sphere the United States is the address and will 
provide security arrangements. 
  And now the package deal is being worked out. The United 
States is indeed the address for security issues. Immediately 
after the Gaza-Jericho agreement is signed, Israel will 
intensify its work on formulating its proposal to al-Asad. The 
proposal will be finalized in anticipation of the resumption of 
the Washington talks in late April and another shuttle round of 
the region for Christopher. 
  Until recently al-Asad behaved as though he had all the time 
in the world, but now he has made a certain shift and is 
behaving as though he is pressed for time. Rabin, for his part, 
counted up to now on semantics, settling for the occasional word 
on the Syrian issue. Now he too understands this game is over. 
Now everyone is talking business. The general working 
assumption is now full withdrawal in exchange for full peace. 
Everything else stems from this. 
  The Israel-Syria border has been under dispute for years. 
There is no clear and fixed border between the two countries, 
no Green Line. There is the border line known as the 4 July 
1967 border, which at a certain point almost reaches Lake 
Tiberias, and there is the international border. According to 
this border all of Lake Tiberias and the southern slopes of the 
Golan Heights, including al- Hammah, are parts of historic 
Palestine. As far as Israel is concerned this is not Syrian 
territory. 
  There will probably be a sharp argument for years after a 
peace agreement with Syria is signed over which of the two 
borders is the correct one. It is possible that the seeds of an 
arbitration process similar to the Taba arbitration are already 
being sown. 
  Israel, even when it recognizes Syrian sovereignty on the 
Golan Heights, will fix its sight on the international border. 
Even when it agrees to say "complete IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] withdrawal," it will not specify where to. It will 
demand, on the other hand, a timetable of eight years, but will 
gladly settle for six years. 
  Peres, Rabin, and Rabinovich realize that the problem is 
that 
al-Asad is thinking about the Egyptian model. Israeli 
withdrawal in the south was conducted in three stages over a 
period of three years. Al-Asad will also demand a three-year 
withdrawal process. There is also the problem of the 
settlements. With Egypt we only had the problem of the Rafah 
Approaches settlements, and that was limited to the third and 
last stage of withdrawal. The Golan Heights, on the other hand, 
is completely covered with settlements -- 12,000 settlers are 
spread over all parts of the Golan Heights. 
  Whenever he picks up a map of the Golan, Rabin's heart 
probably sinks. Whichever way he turns it, however he may shape 
the package deal, he will have to deal with one settlement or 
another in the first stage of the withdrawal. A withdrawal, 
however minor, will per force have to include Aloney Habashan, 
to cite just one example. 
  That is why in the package deal being formulated by Israel 
Rabin wants to leave the settlements the option of evacuating if 
they wish, or remaining under Syrian sovereignty. Al-Asad is 
hardly likely to agree to such an arrangement, and neither is 
any Jewish settlement. The Americans realize that, and so does 
Rabin. However, just as in the case of Netzarim and Hebron, he 
prefers to create a situation whereby the settlers themselves 
will want to leave rather than forcing him to evacuate them. A 
matter of character. 
  Of course, Israel demands a full demilitarization of the 
entire Golan Heights. The Syrians agree, but demand the 
demilitarization of an area equal in size within Israeli 
territory. According to this scenario, the entire Galilee would 
be demilitarized. However, the point is that nobody is taking 
this Syrian demand seriously. Negotiating games -- this is how 
it is dubbed in Washington. 
  In contrast, a demilitarization of the Golan is a sine qua 
non. When Clinton told Rabin that he was the address for 
security matters he really meant it. Washington is prepared to 
send a military force to the Golan to uphold the peace treaty. 
At this point, reference is to two U.S. Army brigades which 
would deploy in the Golan Heights, two early-warning stations -- 
one Israeli and one Syrian -- and joint Israeli-Syrian control 
of the water sources. 
  Mount Hermon is a problem onto itself, a real security 
problem. Israel plans to wage a real battle over this mountain, 
"the eyes of Israel," as a Golani Brigade solder nicknamed it in 
the Yom Kippur War. If Israel loses it, Israel will demand an 
appropriate reward from Clinton. 
  An arrangement with Lebanon has a place of honor in the 
package deal. To date the Lebanese delegation has been 
conducting some kind of make-believe negotiations in Washington, 
seeing that it is clear to all that Lebanon is just a 
marionette, a Syrian puppet on a string. Henceforth, 
negotiations about an arrangement in south Lebanon will be 
conducted in the most official way possible, as part of the 
negotiations with Syria and the package deal. 
  Israel is prepared to withdraw from south Lebanon and does 
not object to a continued presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon. 
In exchange, it demands that Syria totally disarm Hizballah and 
all other Palestinian terror organizations in Lebanon. Israel 
would initially withdrawal from the town of Jazzin. Later, 
after a six-month trial period, it would proceed to implement 
the second phase of the withdrawal. Israel would go ahead with 
the withdrawal only if all terror activities against Israel and 
the security zone including against the SLA [South Lebanese 
Army], stopped. 
  The SLA is in a bind. It has been angry ever since Operation 
Accountability and the arrangement Syria imposed on Hizballah, 
whereby Hizballah may not fire katyusha rockets at Qiryat 
Shemona but may fire them at Marj 'Uyun. What is wrong with 
you, Antoine Lahd asked, is the blood of Israeli children redder 
than that of Lebanese children? The SLA feared Israel had 
abandoned them. As far as they were concerned, this was a sign 
of things to come. 
  Uri Lubrani, coordinator of government activities in 
Lebanon, had to work hard to placate the SLA. Perhaps through 
Lubrani's doing, Rabin is now demanding from the United States 
that the SLA be part of the package deal with Syria and that the 
United States assume responsibility for the well-being of its 
personnel after Israel's withdrawal. According to the emerging 
deal, the SLA would become a regional brigade within the 
Lebanese Army. Antoine Lahd has already given his consent. 
  Al-Asad, who is in a hurry to reach an arrangement with 
Israel, is playing his Lebanese card for all it is worth. Last 
week, when Ross asked him to rein in Hizballah in south Lebanon, 
al-Asad replied: If Rabin wants quiet in the north, let him 
work out a comprehensive arrangement with me. 
  One must admit that Rabin is not having an easy time of it: 
Almost endless difficulties in the Gaza-Jericho deal, the 
horrible massacre in Hebron which disrupted the timetable, hurt 
the delicate and fragile equilibrium, and fully exposed the 
regrettable hatred, racism, and hostility toward the Arabs. 
Rabin told Clinton that al-Asad must persuade the Israeli 
people that he really means peace and must take steps to build 
its confidence. 
  As far as Rabin is concerned, the joint news conference held 
by Clinton and al-Asad in Geneva was a big miss, as he put it. 
He had expected al-Asad to appeal to the Israeli nation, to 
look straight into the camera and tell Israelis that what he has 
in mind is true peace, that they can trust him, that there will 
be no more wars; something along the lines of what al-Sadat 
said. Instead, al-Asad barred Israeli journalists from the news 
conference, mumbled a few words about peace, and let Clinton 
explain what he had in mind. 
  Ross conveyed Rabin's remarks to al-Asad. It would be very 
wise, Ross told him, if you were to make some 
confidence-building step vis-a-vis Israeli public opinion. 
Rabin, too, has difficulties, he said. Al-Asad promised Ross 
he would do something. This is the message Ross brought to 
Jerusalem. Now everybody is looking forward to mid-April, 
waiting with bated breath for the dramatic step promised by 
al-Asad. 
  Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the 
United States and chief negotiator with Syria, has in his own 
way been trying to persuade the Syrians to make some move. 
Rabinovich wants the Syrians to invite a group of Israeli 
journalists to Damascus. These should not be Arab or Druze, but 
Israeli journalists bearing Israeli passports, without any kind 
of religious, racial, or sexual discrimination. 
  "If you are not prepared to invite Israelis to Damascus at 
this point," Rabinovich told the Syrians, "at least arrange a 
meeting between Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and Israeli 
journalists outside Syria at a venue of your choice, in Europe 
or in the United States. You must, you simply must open up to 
the Israeli media," Rabinovich said. 
  Two moves made by al-Asad were perceived by Washington and 
Jerusalem as confidence-building measures. The first was to 
allow Syrian Jews to leave the country, and the second was to 
permit the visit of an official U.S. Congressional delegation to 
look into the question of Israeli MIA's. However, as far as 
Israeli public opinion is concerned, these moves were not 
dramatic enough. 
  The problem lies with a difference in perceptions. What 
al-Asad considers a confidence-building measure and what Rabin 
does are as far apart as Jerusalem is from Damascus. Al-Asad 
even regarded the visit of 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah with a 
delegation of Israeli Arabs as a real sacrifice on his part, as 
a compromise, as a confidence-building measure. Rabin expects a 
different thing altogether, to put it mildly. 
  At some point al-Asad consented to informal talks between 
Israeli and Syrian academics. Three meetings were held in which 
Israel was represented by Dr. Yosi Olmert, Ze'ev Schiff, and 
'Amos Gilbo'a. A minor scandal ensued when the meetings were 
publicized. Rabinovich told Muwaffaq al-'Allaf, head of the 
Syrian delegation to the talks in Washington, that the 
subsequent Syrian repudiation of the meetings could not be 
construed as a confidence-building move. 
  On the eve of Passover, in an interview with IDF Radio, 
Rabin 
spoke about a new phase in the negotiations with Syria. "Of 
course, I look forward with faith," he said. "Syria, Jordan, 
and Lebanon have already agreed to resume the Washington talks 
at the end of April. I believe they will take a somewhat 
different form. 
  "There will no longer be algebraic-like formulas defining 
what constitutes peace and what constitutes withdrawal, but 
rather a far more comprehensive view of peace and withdrawal as 
packages, withdrawal in stages without committing ourselves to 
the final line and, of course, security arrangements and the 
subsequent U.S. aid." 
  Rabin also mentioned confidence-building measures. He does 
not just mention them, but whenever the opportunity arises he 
appeals to al-Asad and asks him to make a move. "Al-Asad," 
Rabin told IDF Radio, "is no al-Sadat. Al-Asad has a different 
approach which makes progress in the peace process more 
difficult. The State of Israel and its people are democratic. 
The Israeli public has to be convinced that the Arab leader it 
is negotiating with really means peace and is willing to hold 
public meetings at the most senior levels. 
  "At this stage of the negotiations with Syria, only 
relatively low-level contacts have been held. If this does not 
change at some stage -- if higher-level contacts are not held, 
if the Syrian media does not show greater openness, if Syrian 
leaders do not issue clearer public statements on their 
intention to reach peace -- it will be very difficult to make 
progress in the negotiations." 
  Some change began to emerge in the latest round of talks in 
Washington. In fact, the talks reverted to tete-a-tete sessions 
between Rabinovich and al-'Allaf, with Dennis Ross joining them 
on occasion. The Americans have been keeping a high profile in 
the talks with the Syrians. 
  However, the talks between Rabinovich and al-'Allaf look 
more 
like a diplomatic war of attrition than like peace talks. Rabin 
claims that al-'Allaf does not have enough powers. On the other 
hand, Rabinovich is Rabin's confidant. He arrives at the talks 
with powers and leeway, and seated opposite him he encounters a 
junior clerk who cannot move even one inch without al-Asad. As 
far as Rabin is concerned, there are only two options: Either 
replace al- 'Allaf or give him leeway. 
  In a private session this week Peres said that they would 
seriously proceed to tackle the negotiations with Syria 
immediately upon the completion of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
As everybody knows by now, when Peres says seriously, he 
definitely means it. As far as he is concerned, serious 
negotiations mean overt diplomacy to prepare public opinion, 
official talks, and high-level meetings such as between foreign 
ministers. However, more than anything else, as far as Peres is 
concerned, serious negotiations mean secret talks.

  [Text] The offensive of Golboddin Hekmatyar's militia in 
Tagab was repulsed. A source in the Ministry of Defense told 
the BIA military correspondent that yesterday Golboddin 
Hekmatyar's militia mounted a sudden offensive on the front 
lines of the front and high points. As a result of the kindness 
of the great God and the valor of the mojahedin of Islam it was 
dislodged. As a result of the counteroffensive of the mojahedin 
of the Islamic army, eight raiders were killed, three were taken 
prisoner, and three others were wounded. Three rocket 
launchers, three PK machine guns, and 13 Kalashnikovs were 
captured from the enemy. According to the security sources' 
report, the Tagab offensive took place as a result of Dostam's 
request that Hekmatyar open a second front against the forces of 
the Islamic army to [words indistinct] on central bases of the 
militia in the north.

<F P=106> [By Terence White] </F>
  [Text] CHARASIAB, Afghanistan, April 3 (AFP) -- In opening 
remarks during his first meeting with United Nations special 
peace envoy Mahmud Al-Mestiri Sunday, Afghan Prime Minister 
Golboddin Hekmatyar claimed he was not fighting for power. 
  "This war is not for power, it is for principles," said 
Hekmatyar without elaborating. 
  Mestiri and his staff of seven UN personnel, including 
Sotirios Mousouris, Coordinator for Afghan Humanitarian 
Assistance, drove to Hekmatyar's Charasiab headquarters 25 
kilometers (15 miles) southeast of Kabul to sound out the prime 
minister's views. 
  The UN convoy, which included local and foreign journalists, 
was blocked temporarily in Charasiab bazaar by banner-waving 
civilians calling for peace and the resignation of Hekmatyar's 
rival, Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani. 
  "Rabbani's resignation is a must," read the English language 
banners and placards, which could be taken as a clear statement 
of Hekmatyar's first political objective. 
  The armed forces of Rabbani and Hekmatyar have been battling 
each other most recently since January 1, when Hekmatyar joined 
the ex-communist militias of warlord General Abdol Rashid Dostam 
in a failed coup attempt to topple Rabbani. 
  "We ask for a government elected by the people and not by 
means of tanks and artillery," Hekmatyar told Mestiri, who 
doubtless observed the truck-mounted 122mm (5 inch) multi-barrel 
rocket launchers and D-30 howitzers as he drove to Charasiab. 
  In south and west Kabul the sound of shelling could be heard 
before noon Sunday, but in general the special ceasefire 
declared for the duration of Mestiri's visit to Kabul was 
respected. 
  Mestiri is expected to meet on Monday with Rabbani's 
strongman, former defence minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, and return 
to Pakistan Tuesday by a special UN flight from Mas'ud's Bagram 
airbase 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the capital. 
  Civilians in Kabul have suffered the brunt of the factional 
fighting there, and are hopeful of positive results from 
Mestiri's visit, but it would be unrealistic to expect the UN 
envoy to conjure up a peace formula acceptable to all sides 
without further sessions of lengthy negotiations.

  [Excerpts] A Hizballah delegation is touring African 
countries. After its fruitful and successful visit to Cote 
d'Ivoire, the Hizballah delegation led by Deputy Muhammad 
Barjawi arrived in Sierre Leone. The delegation was accorded a 
warm reception by a huge crowd of the Lebanese community led by 
the community's president, the Iranian ambassador in Freetown, 
and the iman of the town's mosque. 
  During the visit, the Hizballah delegation met the vice 
president, the prime minister, and Presidential Affairs Minister 
Colonel Jomo [name and title as published]. Deputy Barjawi and 
his delegation also met Hindolo Tyre, secretary of state for 
information. The two sides discussed bilateral relations and 
the status of the Lebanese community in Sierre Leone. 
  The Lebanese ambassador in Freetown hosted a dinner banquet 
in honor of the visiting delegation. Deputy Barjawi delivered a 
speech during the banquet. He said: We have come to visit our 
expatriate kin and to reiterate our cooperation and solidarity 
with them. We also urge them to increase their participation in 
the reconstruction process in Lebanon and support their 
steadfast kin in the south and western al-Biqa'. 
  Syria's Honorary Consul in Freetown, al-Hajj Husayn Jawad, 
hosted a dinner banquet in honor of the Hizballah delegation. 
Present were the Lebanese ambassador, the Iranian ambassador, 
and Turkey's honorary consul. It was an opportunity to exchange 
views and to praise the role of resistance in confronting the 
Israeli occupation. [passage omitted] 
  Guinea was the last leg of the delegation's African tour and 
it was accorded a mammoth reception at Conakry Airport. During 
the visit, the Hizballah delegation met the Guinean foreign 
affairs minister, the minister of religious affairs, and head of 
the Transitional Council. The delegation thanked the Guinean 
officials for the care and facilities extended to Lebanese 
nationals in Guinea. The delegation cautioned against the 
Jewish threat to the interests of the oppressed nations, 
particularly in Africa. 
  The Guinean foreign minister welcomed the delegation and 
stressed his country's continuing support for Lebanon's issues 
and people until the liberation of the south from the Israeli 
occupation. The Guinean minister also reiterated his support 
for the Palestinian people.

  [Excerpts] His Eminence Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Husayn 
Fadlallah has stated that the enemy Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin's visit to the Vatican and his audience with the pope "is 
an indulgence for the enemy absolving him of shedding the blood 
of 56 worshippers." 
  In an interview, Fadlallah said that when Rabin visits the 
Vatican and is warmly received, we want to ask: Is the Vatican 
a West European country like the others or a Christian mission? 
Is it operating in its capacity as the Church, guided by its 
Christian values, or as a state operating according to 
international balances? [passage omitted] 
  His eminence continued: The Vatican always spoke of 
internationalizing Jerusalem first and the holy shrines second. 
It also spoke of the freedom of religion and even regarded 
Jerusalem as its very own cause. This time the pope did not 
discuss Jerusalem with Rabin, as Rabin said. The Vatican did 
not deny Rabin's story. 
  Fadlallah asked: If the pope did not discuss Jerusalem with 
Rabin or the need to protect unarmed Palestinians by sending in 
international forces and if Rabin did not ask him to mediate in 
the negotiations, what was the visit about? The affair then 
represents an indulgence for the Jews and a new recognition that 
gives "Israel" new moral strength to add to the strength it 
already has. [passage omitted] 
  He continued: We want Christianity and Islam to be value 
systems that defend the wronged and oppose the arrogant 
regardless of the consequences. When calculations enter the 
issue, value is lost. If value is lost, what is left of the 
meaning of Islam and Christianity? This is not a position 
against Christianity and Christians. It does not deal with the 
pope's planned visit to Lebanon. We do not oppose the visit. 
We welcome some of its aspects. Undermining causes is a 
different issue. It is not an issue of a papal envoy sent to 
Tunis. A papal envoy should be sent to all those who lost their 
fathers or children in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, because 
it is these people who can utter the word of truth and ask: 
What is the meaning of the Jews' existence in Palestine?

  [Text] The information and broadcasting secretary, Dr. 
Tanvir Ahmad Khan, said no country of the world has forwarded 
more meaningful proposals than Pakistan to make South Asia a 
nuclear-free zone. It, however, is regrettable that India has 
rejected most of these proposals. India is the only country in 
the world where the pursuit of limitless power is increasingly 
seen as a religious obligation in the context of militant Hindu 
revivalism. Dr. Tanvir Ahmad Khan commented on a book called 
The Critical Mass, in which its two authors presented 
facts in a distorted manner, ignoring Pakistan's declaration 
that it wants to utilize nuclear power to meet the growing fuel 
and electricity demands in the country. Dr. Tanvir Ahmad Khan 
criticized the arguments of a specific circle, which is 
overlooking the peaceful nature of Pakistan's nuclear program 
with the intention of reinforcing its own viewpoint, to have 
strict restrictions imposed against Pakistan. He made it clear 
that Pakistan has no intention whatsoever of using its nuclear 
program for military purposes. On the other hand, he added, 
India has been adopting an intimidatory posture toward Pakistan. 
During the Cold War, which has now ended, India had acquired 
massive stocks of arms from the former Soviet Union and acquired 
arms and relevant technology from the Western countries. Under 
these circumstances, Pakistan's national security has assumed 
special importance and nuclear capability is the only effective 
means of safeguarding national security under the current 
scenario. 
  Tanvir Ahmad Khan answered a question about rolling back the 
nuclear program and said no Pakistani Government will be able to 
sign an agreement on the nuclear issue until a regional 
agreement is signed. This agreement must bind all countries of 
the region. 
  The information secretary said it is a matter of great 
strength for Pakistan that today it enjoys the leadership of 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who possesses the full ability, 
determination, courage, and foresight to lead the nation at this 
time of difficulties. He said the opposition should cooperate 
with the government at this difficult time so a national outlook 
and strategy on the nuclear issue can be adopted.

  [Text] Karachi -- Former attorney general Fakhruddin G. 
Ibrahim has said that he has tendered his resignation on 
principles, terming it a `painful decision.' 
  Ibrahim, while talking to The FRONTIER POST here Monday on 
phone, said the government did not consult him before taking the 
decision to single out the legal services out-of-office for 
state representation in the Peshawar High Court regarding former 
NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] chief minister's petition. 
  "They (government) didn't even informed me of the decision" 
Ibrahim said adding it had become a question of self-respect. 
"I had resigned from the government offices twice in the past 
and was happy, but this is a painful decision," he added. 
  To a question he said several PPP [Pakistan People's Party] 
leaders had contacted him requesting to take back his 
resignation. "Aftab Sherpao, federal law minister and others 
asked me to take back the resignation, but now I cannot go 
back," he said. 
  He said prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had not yet contacted 
him. "I hope the prime minister would not contact me on this 
issue as I have written her each and every thing," he said, 
adding it would be embarrassing from him if she contacted him. 
  As for his future plans, Ibrahim said he was happy to be a 
lawyers. He also said the government should continue and 
complete its tenure. 
  Ibrahim had resigned as the Supreme Court judge in [year 
indistinct] after the promulgation of the Provisional 
Constitutional Order (PCO), imposed by General Zia. 
  He had also resigned as Sindh governor in 1990 when he was 
asked by the then president, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, to dissolve the 
then Sindh Assembly following the sacking of Benazir's first 
government.

  [Text] Islamabad -- Within twenty four hours of the 
resignation of Attorney General [AG] Fakhruddin G Ibrahim, 
Deputy Attorney General Mumtaz Ali Mirza too has submitted his 
resignation to President Farooq Leghari. 
  "I don't want to say anything other than that I have 
resigned," the rather cautious Mumtaz Ali remarked when asked 
about reasons of resignation. 
  The move of the Deputy AG, viewed as a setback to the 
government, comes at a time when serious efforts are being 
apparently made by the top government officials to persuade 
Fakhruddin G. Ibrahim to withdraw his previous decision. 
  In his resignation letter, sent to the President, Mirza 
says, 
"I regret to say that it is no longer possible for me to 
continue as Deputy AG. Accordingly, I tender my resignation. 
You are informed." Government circles refused to comment on 
the resignation.

  [Text] Khartoum, 4 Apr (MENA)--The Sudanese authorities 
today suspended AL-SUDANI AL-DUWALI newspaper. The decision was 
taken under the emergency laws. 
  A statement by the Sudanese Presidency, carried by Omdurman 
radio today, said that the paper cast doubt on the struggle of 
the Sudanese Armed Forces and called for separation and 
abandoning the unity of the country and disintegrating national 
unity. It also dealt lightly with the prestige of the 
revolution and its symbols without any justification.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Basit Sabdarat, minister of culture </F>
and information, by Kamal Hasan Bakhit in Khartoum; date not 
given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Bakhit] Sudanese-U.S. 
relations are facing a continuing crisis. The United States 
always confronts Sudan at international forums. Indeed, it 
endorses the Sudanese statement opposing the government. The 
question is: What does the United States want from Sudan? Are 
there any non-Sudanese forces behind the hardline U.S. stand 
toward the Sudanese Government? 
  [Sabdarat] First of all, the United States wants Sudan to 
abandon its cultural awakening plan. After the collapse of the 
socialist camp, the United States now believes that it is a real 
danger to have Islam as the second major power after the United 
States. In other words, the United States believes that the 
power of Islam and Muslims cannot but be the second major power. 
Therefore, it is in principle against Islam. In fact, the 
United States is against religions because its real religion is 
materialism. So, it does not want Islam to be the alternative 
to the capitalist collapse, which will eventually afflict the 
Western camp as it afflicted the socialist camp. The United 
States believes that Sudan is the model for a new Islamic state, 
one that is different from those Islamic states in which Islam 
is a mere facade -- just the way the United States wants it to 
be. Therefore, killing this model has become the main concern 
not only of the United States but also of Britain, which is more 
hostile, and of Western countries, in general. 
  I believe that the issue of Bosnia is an example of this 
inclination. These Western countries do not at all want the 
establishment of a fully Islamic state in the middle of Europe. 
They also do not want an Islamic state in the middle of Africa 
or the Middle East or in strategic places anywhere in the world. 
Hence, the United States' hostility toward Sudan does not target 
a certain party, it is a continuous and blatant hostility toward 
Islam. It is also a conflict of cultures. This is a well known 
conflict, even though it remained hidden in many occasions. 
However, it now began to emerge in its real blatant form. 
  [Bakhit] How do you explain the stand of Aldo Ajo Deng, 
former deputy speaker of the parliament, in terms of seeking 
political asylum in Britain and in terms of joining the 
opposition? 
  [Sabdarat] I believe that Aldo Ajo became convinced that his 
generation has no place in Sudan after he saw that rulers of 
Sudanese regions and commissioners comprise a new generation. 
He saw that his generation, which created part of the Sudanese 
movement, has a weak future. Moreover, he had an ambition of 
becoming the vice president. However, he found out that a young 
man from the new generation would take that position. Then, he 
and others were subject to many temptations. He believed other 
people's talk about an approaching end to this regime. He 
succumbed to pressures and followed the road he is on now. 
  [Bakhit] What are your expectations about the talks to 
achieve peace? 
  [Sabdarat] I always believe that sitting at a dialogue table 
is a sound start. However, it is not always certain that those 
who sit around this table will end up achieving peace. The 
available facts confirm that the rebel movement has no 
alternative to dialogue. After it has been encircled, the rebel 
movement cannot achieve any goal on the military level. 
Practically, the movement cannot depend on the outside world in 
order to separate the south because this issue is also an issue 
of war. The separation of southern Sudan cannot be achieved by 
a UN decision. Even if the United Nations and the entire world 
imposed this, the south would remain part of Sudan. Sudan has 
sacrificed thousands of martyrs for the sake of maintaining its 
unity. The issue remains inflamed and the war continues. 
Therefore, I believe that the movement is at its weakest and 
its only means of saving face is peace. This is especially true 
since the model we are establishing now is a practical model. 
We are making real peace on the ground in Bahr al-Ghazal, the 
Upper Nile, and vast parts of Sudan's Equatoria. We are doing 
so through development and work so that the model of peace 
inside Sudan will be that of real peace. I believe that if the 
rebel movement understands these facts, peace can be achieved. 
  [Bakhit] However, the government has constants that cannot 
be 
shaken and so does the rebel movement. The question is: How 
can peace be achieved? Don't you think that the issue will turn 
into a useless dialogue? 
  [Sabdarat] First of all, the rebel movement does not have 
any constants. At one time, it talked about a federation, then 
about a confederation, and later about self-determination 
(separation). Now, it is talking about sharing authority and 
wealth. Hence, there constants are tactical. We will not 
change our own constants, which stipulate that Sudan is one 
united country and that a federation is the ideal model for rule 
in Sudan. Therefore, I believe that when the rebel movement 
demands its right to self-determination, it is asking for the 
maximum in order to achieve the minimum of what it wants. 
  [Bakhit] A short time ago, the government announced that two 
foreign military aircraft penetrated Sudan's airspace, What is 
the story behind this? In other words, how true is this? 
  [Sabdarat] The truth is that two warplanes flying at an 
altitude parallel to that of civil airplanes were monitored. 
Some quarters and Arab and foreign ambassadors were informed 
about this. There is an ongoing investigation to find out the 
identity of these warplanes and their objectives. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] Mogadishu, 5 Apr (AFP) -- Heavy guns pounded 
several parts of south Mogadishu late Monday [4 April] as rival 
Somali clans clashed in the most fierce battle in several 
months, witnesses said. A Somali journalist said at least one 
person was killed in the fighting which lasted almost three 
hours. 
  The fighting occurred between the K4 roundabout on Afgooye 
Road and the seaport. Militiamen exchanged machinegun and 
rocket fire. It was unclear which clans were involved in the 
fighting, but Somali journalists said it pitted "bandits from 
rival clans". 
  South Mogadishu is the fiefdom of warlord Mohamed Farah 
Aidid 
of the Somali National Alliance (SNA). United Nations deputy 
military spokesman Major Asif Iqbal said no United Nations 
peacekeeping forces were involved in the fighting. "We don't 
know which clans were involved in this", Major Iqbal said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Factional fighting has been escalating during the week, but 
previous clashes involved the use of small arms. Three SNA 
officials were reportedly killed near the October 21 Road on 
Sunday by a lone gunman who fired into a crowd, a Somali 
journalist said. SNA militiamen vowed to retaliate and 
surrounded a building near the stadium.

<F P=106> [Statement by Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif </F>
following talks between Presidents Husni Mubarak and Hafiz 
al-Asad in Cairo on 5 April--recorded] 
  [Text] President Hafiz al-Asad's visit to Egypt comes 
within the framework of continuous consultations between the two 
countries and presidents. Several rounds of talks have been 
held. The two presidents held private talks and the Egyptian 
and Syrian delegations also met. 
  The talks covered many issues of common concern. 
International relations, international developments under the 
new world order, and regional, Arab, and Islamic issues were 
discussed. 
  The talks also covered several important issues. The overall 
Arab position was reviewed. The two emphasized the efforts made 
by both countries to clear the Arab atmosphere and cement Arab 
solidarity. 
  Other issues also figured in the talks, most notably the 
Yemeni crisis and the efforts to overcome this crisis. Egypt 
and Syria believe that these efforts should continue because of 
the dire consequences the crisis holds for Yemen's unity, a 
unity that we all hope to preserve. 
  The two parties reviewed the Libyan-Western crisis and the 
Egyptian and Arab efforts to stop the escalation of sanctions 
against Libya. The two leaderships see a need for further 
cooperation and coordination in this regard. 
  Concerning Somalia, Egypt and Syria see a need to achieve 
reconciliation and agreement among the Somali factions. The 
Somalis should be encouraged and helped to rebuild their 
country. The Egyptian and Syrian sides also reviewed the 
situation in Sudan, stressing the need to preserve the unity of 
Sudan's land and people during the dialogue concerning the 
problem in south Sudan. 
  Another topic broached during the talks was peace. The two 
sides discussed that issue in full detail, reviewing the current 
talks and consultations concerning the Middle East peace process 
and highlighting the need to make this peace a comprehensive and 
just one. The two parties reviewed some of the obstacles facing 
the peace process and the factors affecting it. The two parties 
discussed the common vision and principles leading to progress 
in the Arab-Israeli peace process. In this connection, the 
efforts and consultations of the international community and the 
United States were discussed. 
  The Egyptian and Syrian sides reviewed the peace process on 
every track, particularly the Syrian and Palestinian, always 
emphasizing the comprehensiveness of a regional settlement in 
the Middle East and the need to achieve a just peace. 
  The Nonaligned Movement was discussed and emphasis was 
placed 
on the group's upcoming meeting in Cairo and the need to 
consolidate the role of the Nonaligned Movement and enhance 
cooperation among Third World countries. Perhaps these were the 
most important issues discussed on the international, regional, 
and Arab levels. 
  The two presidents and the meetings of the two delegations 
discussed bilateral ties. The Higher Egyptian-Syrian Joint 
Committee will meet on 15 May. The committee will discuss 
cooperation between Egypt and Syria in the political, economic, 
cultural, social, and other fields and several joint ventures.

  [Text] Cairo, 5 Apr (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak today 
called Egyptian-Syrian relations very strong. Speaking to 
journalists just after seeing off Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad, Mubarak said that he and President al-Asad discussed 
the Middle East peace process and examined ways of restoring 
Arab solidarity to its former state and resolving differences 
within the Arab family. 
  Answering a question from MENA, President Mubarak said that 
his talks with President al-Asad also touched on the Yemeni 
crisis and the disputes between the north and the south. We 
also discussed the Libyan-Western crisis, he said. 
  President Mubarak said: We talked in general about the 
issues of concern to the entire Arab world. 
  Answering a question on whether the Egyptian-Syrian summit 
explored ways to end the crisis facing the current peace 
process, Mubarak said: We did not get into details, but I would 
like to say that we discussed the issue of peace, bearing in 
mind the recent meeting in Geneva between President al-Asad and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  President Mubarak added: I think that there was tremendous 
hope for the continuation of the peace talks, and then the 
incident in Hebron forestalled and complicated the process. 
  President Mubarak expressed his full confidence that Syrian 
President al-Asad wants peace. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin shares this view and also wants peace, he added. 
President Mubarak expressed his hope that negotiations will 
resume in the last week of April in Washington. He said that he 
hoped there will be flexibility in the negotiations so that 
peace can be achieved this year without further delay. 
  Asked by an Israeli television reporter if he had discussed 
the peace negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track with the 
Syrian president, President Mubarak said: Yes, we talked about 
it. I would like to emphasize that President Hafiz al-Asad 
cares about peace and wants to reach a solution to the problem, 
a just and honorable solution. President Mubarak expressed his 
belief that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is also 
following the same line and wants peace. President Mubarak 
added: I hope that there will be flexibility in the Arab-Israeli 
bilateral negotiations, which I believe will be resumed in the 
last week of April. He added: I hope they will reach a peace 
agreement before the end of this year. 
  Asked if he means flexibility on the part of Israel, 
President Mubarak said: Actually, the flexibility must come 
from both sides, although more flexibility is needed from the 
Israeli side so that we can give momentum to the peace process. 
In this regard, President Mubarak emphasized that peace 
deserves every sacrifice because it means life to the peoples 
that enables them to live safely, cooperate, and come together. 
He added: Now, they do not come together because there is a 
problem that has existed for almost 50 years. We cannot expect 
to just push a button and have all parties come together and 
embrace. It takes time. Peace is important to every 
individual, whether an Israeli or an Arab. 
  Asked about Syria's position on the Golan, President Mubarak 
said: The Golan is Syrian territory, and it is hard to ask 
Syria to give up an inch of the Golan. He added: I am not 
imposing this on Israel but I say what I believe; that is, peace 
must be in return for land, otherwise, the peace process will 
remain difficult. 
  Asked about the current situation on the Israeli-Palestinian 
track, President Mubarak said: As you know, the Hebron incident 
has complicated things. But I believe that they have reached an 
agreement to secure the Hebron region and are now continuing the 
negotiations on how to implement the Palestinian-Israeli 
Declaration of Principles. I hope they will finish this quickly 
although some minor obstacles still exist, but I am confident 
they will overcome them. 
  In response to another question if there are proposals to 
resolve the Syrian-Israeli problem, President Mubarak said: The 
matter is clear; the Syrian land must be returned, which would 
mean the return of peace, with some security measures that could 
be taken. The president referred to the Madrid conference for 
Middle East peace. He said: The conference has played its role. 
All parties have met and now everybody must get down to direct 
agreements among themselves. 
  Asked whether a meeting between Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin can help 
achieve a peace agreement, President Mubarak said: Such a 
meeting will help resolve problems. We have tried this several 
times. But the Syrians do not agree to such a high-level 
meeting at present. When they reach a peace agreement, such a 
meeting will not be a problem. 
  On his upcoming visit to Japan and China sometime this 
month, President Mubarak said: We have good relations with 
China. There is great cooperation between us. Japan is an 
important country and cooperates with us. Japan has given 
economic aid to Egypt. We expect more cooperation during our 
visit. 
  On the national dialogue committee, President Mubarak said: 
Once I return from China and Japan I will meet with the 
dialogue committee to draw up the bases for its work so that it 
will start its activity and adopt the necessary recommendations. 
On the date the committee will start its work, President 
Mubarak said that once the committee meets, the wheels will 
start turning. 
  Asked whether he discussed with al-Asad the issue of [words 
indistinct] states that export terrorism, President Mubarak 
said: We did not discuss this problem. I hope all this will 
disappear. Let us concentrate on the peace process.

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Apr (MENA)--Unidentified men diverted a 
Sudanese airliner coming from Khartoum and forced its captain to 
proceed to the Luxor airport, where the airliner has landed. 
  The Boeing 737 airliner with 93 passengers and six crew 
members on board took off from Khartoum en route for 
al-Danaqilah in south Sudan. The hijacker forced the captain to 
fly to Egypt. Defense Minister Field Marshal Husayn Tantawi 
gave permission to the airliner to land at the Luxor airport. 
The hijacker is a Sudanese national and is asking for political 
asylum in Egypt.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "The Astronomical Military Expenditure </F>
and Reduction of the Oil Income"] 
  [Text] Esteemed listeners. The clerics' regime which is 
known to be a dictatorial, tension-generating one is constantly 
seeking to purchase various kinds of weapons so as to continue 
its evil actions, and it is expending astronomical sums for this 
purpose. In the past few years, the clerics have formulated and 
implemented extensive programs to expand their armed forces for 
the purpose of suppressing the discontented people in the 
country, and to continue their efforts to create tension abroad 
in the past few years. These programs required enormous outlay. 
  What has transpired on this issue so far is that right from 
the outset, the clerics' regime allocated nearly $40 billion for 
this program and on the basis of the agreements, a large part of 
the sum has been used and this program is expected to continue 
in the future. At present, the clerical regime is seeking to 
implement the last stages of its military program. In the past 
five years, the officials of the Islamic Republic signed a $10 
billion agreement for the ordnance purchases from Russia, a $3 
billion agreement with the DPRK, and have completed a $5 billion 
transaction with the PRC. 
  In addition, the clerics' regime is pursuing an ambitious 
scheme to acquire a nuclear bomb and it is expected to implement 
this scheme in the next few years. For this purpose, it has 
initiated (?preparations) and is not stinting on any expenditure 
in this regard. 
  The regime's megalomaniac policy of generating tension does 
not take into consideration that it has already spent large sums 
of tens of billions of dollars from the country's budget for the 
purchase of miscellaneous weapons and is still pursuing this 
policy. It is also motivating and encouraging various hardline 
and Islamic fundamentalist groups in other countries which 
demands even more expenditure on the part of the regime. 
  The clerics have displayed particular generosity in this 
regard and have spent freely for this purpose. The training of 
agents and the establishment of terrorist networks in most of 
the countries of the world by the clerics' regime also entails 
massive expenditure. It is obvious that to meet these costs, the 
clerics' regime had counted on their oil income to a great 
extent and this income has declined considerably at present. 
  In view of the fact that the reduction of the oil income has 
not affected the regime's military program and its policy of 
generating tension, and as we can perceive, the clerics continue 
to pursue their policy of fanning discord and arming their 
forces more than ever. Even if Iran is an affluent country, one 
can foresee that in the not so distant future, it will become a 
backward country and will bring the people face to face with 
difficult conditions. 
  With the slump in oil prices on the international market and 
a concomitant budget deficit of 20 percent, the rate of 
inflation soared to nearly 30 percent per month. It is for this 
reason that the regime is unable to pay its installments and 
interest on the $28 billion worth of foreign debts. In brief, 
the regime's purchases of ordnance and military equipment 
continues unchanged but the oil income has dwindled. There is 
no doubt that eventually, such a situation will be to the 
detriment of the people in the future. 
  At present, more than two-thirds of our people are living on 
or even below the poverty line. The regime is only extending 
long term promises of future prosperity for resolving these 
problems and is asking people to be patient and bear with them, 
instead of providing some solutions. In general, the erroneous 
policies and conduct of the regime has disrupted the lives of 
the people on the one hand and with the implementation of its 
military program on the other, it has created other (?problems) 
for the outside world, which will transform Iran into a center 
of even greater tension and crises in the region in the future 
which will have unforeseen consequences.

  [Excerpts] In the first Majles session of the new year, the 
generalities of the bill for health service insurance were 
approved. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Nateq-Nuri, who was chairing today's open session, 
expressed good wishes for the new year and referred to the 
guidance of His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the leader of the 
Islamic revolution, and his excellency's stress on work ethics 
and social discipline and hoped that the Majles deputies, 
government, and administrative officials will look sufficiently 
towards a culture of labor and social discipline, and will work 
for providing better services for the people. 
  Evaluating developments in the past year, the Majles speaker 
said the expansion of Islamism and Islamization across the 
world, in particular in the Islamic countries, were among the 
political and social achievement of Muslims. 
  He referred to Serbian and Croatian crimes in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the massacre of Muslims at prayer in the 
al-Khalil [Hebron] mosque by Zionists, and the silence and 
indifference of international associations that claim the 
defense of human rights as the bitter events of the past year, 
and said that the destruction of the Zionist regime was the only 
way of solving the Palestinian issue.

  [Text] The speaker of the Qatari parliament arrived in 
Tehran today at the head of a parliamentary delegation. He was 
welcomed at the airport by Mr. 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, the Majles 
speaker. 
  Mr. 'Ali bin-Khalifa al-Hatm said in an interview with our 
reporter that the purpose of his visit to Iran was to expand 
relations even further and said the visit was of importance to 
his country's officials. 
  Mr. Nateq-Nuri, for his part, spoke in an interview with our 
reporter about issues that will be discussed in talks between 
the two countries' officials. 
  [Begin Nateq-Nuri recording] We will discuss economic 
issues, 
such as the issue of the transfer of potable water to Qatar, 
which is a very huge project; the exploitation of a joint gas 
field; and regional issues and issues relating to the world of 
Islam and Islamic countries, such as the issue of Palestine and 
so on. Our relations with Qatar are very sincere, warm, and 
long-standing. Qatar has consistently adopted very good stances 
in international organizations -- during the imposed Iran-Iraq 
war for example -- and this kind of thing means our relations 
with Qatar are on a special footing and of importance to us. 
God willing, we hope that, with this visit by these gentlemen, 
these relations will expand even further. [end recording]

  [Text] 'Ali Bin-Khalifah al-Hatm, the speaker of Qatar's 
parliament, met and conferred with Majles Speaker 'Ali Akbar 
Nateq-Nuri this afternoon. 
  At this meeting, Mr. al-Hatm referred to the longstanding 
ties between the two countries and said that the basis for 
fraternal relations between Iran and Qatar is their common 
religious and historical heritage. He added that one of the 
fundamental policies of his country is to observe the principle 
of mutual respect and to refrain from interference in the 
internal affairs of other countries. 
  Mr. Nateq-Nuri then stressed the need to establish cordial 
ties between regional countries, in particular among the Islamic 
states. Furthermore, he said that the spread of Islam and the 
desire for Islam are the main cause of global arrogance's enmity 
toward world Muslims. He added that the ruthless massacre of 
the Muslim people of Bosnia-Herzegovina serves to prove such a 
claim. 
  The Majles speaker, moreover, criticized the double 
standards 
adopted by the world's so-called human rights organizations and 
forums. He referred to the horrific crime of the Zionists in 
the al-Khalil [Hebron] mosque, and stressed: The al-Khalil 
atrocity will certainly not be the Zionists' last crime. The 
only way to confront the enemies of Islam is by displaying unity 
among world Muslims. 
  He continued his remarks by alluding to the existing 
problems 
in the sensitive and strategic Persian Gulf region. He 
emphasized that the region's security should be safeguarded by 
the region's people. He asserted: In its attempt to create 
discord among the countries of the region, the enemy has entered 
the arena under the pretext of bringing about security, whereas 
in fact it is disrupting the region's security. 
  Mr. Nateq-Nuri also referred to relations between the two 
friendly and fraternal countries of Qatar and the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. He alluded to the religious, historical, and 
geographical traits that the two countries have in common, and 
said: Because of these common traits, and also because of the 
fair stances adopted by the Government of Qatar during the 
course of the war imposed by Iraq on Iran, the Islamic Republic 
of Iran reserves a special regard for Qatar. 
  The Majles speaker then expressed the hope that cordial and 
fraternal ties between Tehran and Doha will serve as an 
exemplary model for all the Persian Gulf littoral states.

<F P=106> [Unattributed political commentary: "Innovation!"] </F>
  [Text] The trend of a compromise with the Zionist regime 
has assumed new proportions in the region, the first 
manifestation of which can be seen in the invitation to Israel 
to participate in regional sessions. 
  Qatar became the pioneer of this latest innovation when it 
announced that it had invited an Israeli delegation to 
participate in the multilateral talks on the nonproliferation of 
weapons expected to convene in Qatar in Ordibehesht [21 April-21 
May]. 
  Accordingly, Oman has also announced that an Israeli 
delegation will visit Muscat in the next few days to participate 
in a multipartite working group session regarding water 
resources. Thus, Oman becomes the first Gulf Cooperation 
Council [GCC] member country to host a delegation from the 
Zionist regime. 
  The following points may be noted with regard to this latest 
dangerous innovation: 
  1. It can be conceded without doubt that the convocation of 
the so-called experts' sessions with the inclusion of the 
Israeli regime's representatives has only one objective, that 
is, to pave the way for normalizing relations between the GCC 
countries and this regime. 
  This can be confirmed in the context of the remarks of an 
Arab diplomatic source who stated that the United States is 
trying to persuade the littoral states to lift the Israeli 
boycott in their multipartite talks. 
  Thus, the U.S. pressure to normalize relations with the 
Israeli regime has increased and recently, reports have been 
disseminated of covert contacts between the littoral countries 
of the southern Persian Gulf and Israel. Thus, they are seeking 
to bring them out of the closet and make these covert ties overt. 
  2. In circumstances when the Zionist regime, officially and 
in full view of people everywhere, makes innocent Palestinian 
civilians wallow in blood and dust and when little time has 
elapsed since the al-Khalil debacle, what does the presence of 
Israeli delegates at sessions held in Islamic countries mean? 
  Is this anything but the treachery of these countries to the 
Islamic aspirations or at least Arab aspirations that have been 
bandied about for years? 
  What answer do these littoral countries of the southern 
Persian Gulf, which will host representatives from the most 
rootless and illegitimate regime, have for the world's public, 
especially the Muslims, whose hearts are still bleeding from the 
heinous slaughter of the fasting worshippers while they were 
prostrating themselves in the al-Ibrahimi mosque? 
  3. The Persian Gulf shaykhs have chosen the worst and most 
dangerous path for protecting their thrones and diadems. 
Permitting the ingress of the Zionists into the Persian Gulf 
region will not benefit them; it will certainly generate 
sentiments opposed to this action among the awakened societies 
in their respective countries, which will certainly not be very 
pleasant for their rulers. 
  The sins of the Persian Gulf shaykhs are unforgivable and 
Israel's presence in the region will never be tolerated by the 
Arab and Muslim public in the region. 
  Subservience to the U.S. policies on normalizing relations 
with the Zionist regime will harm all the countries involved in 
this trend, harm that will be too costly to redeem.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The results of the recent municipal polls in Turkey 
and the success of the Islamic Rifah -- Prosperity -- Party in 
some of its cities, including Ankara and Istanbul, have 
(?entailed) sensitivity and reaction from the country's 
statesmen and government officials. 
  The Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, in a meeting with a 
group of editors from the country's highly circulated newspapers 
and magazines this week, stressed that the central government 
would not allow measures repugnant to its laic [as heard] 
policy. He said that the administration of Istanbul, too, is 
the responsibility of the government rather than that of the 
municipality. 
  Also, Turkey's interior minister, in a similar statement, 
has 
sounded a warning to the new Islamic mayors of Ankara and 
Istanbul, as well as of other cities in the country. He 
declared that they would probably be prosecuted in the event of 
not adhering to the policy of the separation of politics from 
religion. 
  Undoubtedly, such statements from Turkish officials arise 
from their concern over the impact of the assumption of power by 
the Islamic Prosperity Party in some major cities of Turkey. In 
fact the acceptance of such an issue -- based on the secular 
system of government in Turkey -- is something which can hardly 
be likeable to the country's laic circles. 
  At any rate, the reality cannot be overlooked that the 
outcome of the recent municipality elections has shown that, 
despite 70 years of sovereignty of un-Islamic laws and 
propaganda about secularism, Islamic trends in Turkey are on the 
rise and this is something which has put the secular government 
of Turkey at loggerheads with the Muslims of the country. 
  However, aside from the various reasons that have led to the 
recent election success of the Islamic-based Prosperity Party, 
which has been allowed to have political activities, it can be 
said that the frustration that the Turkish Muslim people have 
with respect to the potential of the country's secular and 
liberal parties in overcoming the social, economic, and 
political problems of Turkey has also acted as a main factor in 
shifting the voters toward the Prosperity Party. Now, in view 
of these considerations, the secular circles in Turkey are faced 
with the question and concern as to what extent the Islamic 
trends in that country are going to influence the economic, 
social, and political aspects in the future. Besides, according 
to these secular circles, there is no guarantee that, during the 
future parliamentary elections, the Muslim people of Turkey will 
turn to the Islamic-based Prosperity Party.

  [Text] Our country's permanent representative to the United 
Nations described as deceitful the remarks made by U.S. State 
Department officials about Iran's performance in the fight 
against narcotics. 
  He stressed: While Iran has come under strong Western 
criticism for taking strict antinarcotics measures, the United 
States accuses Tehran of procrastination in the matter. 
  Referring to data and statistics and a report by the 
International Narcotics Control Board, our country's permanent 
UN representative said: The Islamic Republic of Iran has taken 
extensive measures to control narcotics, not only in the region 
but also globally. Tehran's investment in the matter is of the 
highest level. 
  The U.S. assistant secretary of state claimed last Monday 
that the Islamic Republic of Iran is taking no measures to fight 
narcotics smuggling.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 1, (IRNA) -- The developed world, 
led by the United States is beginning to realize the possibility 
of losing its long-standing competitivenss in economy. 
  The economic regeneration taking place in the developing 
world, specially in Asia is giving the West a bit of its own 
medicine. Their products have been overselling the West's, 
thanks to their competitiveness. 
  Western economies under the spell of a major recession, have 
been attempting to look outward for enhanced trade to narrow 
their trade deficit. 
  Consequently, a great deal of effort was put into resolving 
the stalemate that Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) had come to. But while they wanted to 
pry foreign markets open, they were anxious also to insulate 
their own economies from the growing competition that newly 
industrialised countries were giving them. 
  A policy of "managed trade" was resorted to. It was 
throughly discredited as was witnessed in the case of US-Japan 
trade talk. The American demand for quantitative targets for 
imports by Japan backfired. 
  A more subtle tool is being used now. Developed economies 
today are busy laying the ideological foundation for "social", 
non-tariff barriers to trade. 
  As more and more developing economies modernise, 
industrialise, and compete in a wide range of markets with the 
developed indusrtrial economies, two centuries of inter-country 
comparative advantages are going haywire. This turning of the 
table on the developed world, is only in part due to the lower 
wages in developing world. 
  But the West has made "labour welfare", its major plank for 
criticism. 
  The Uruguay Round of GATT is to be formally adopted in 
Morocco by the end of April this year. Although the Dunkel 
proposals for resolving the deadlocked was approved by all 
members, the US supported by such countries as France has made 
it known that, the social clause would be legal ground enough to 
ban import of products from the developing economies. 
  The US has contended that low wages in the developed world 
gives an artificial advantage to their products which amounts to 
"social dumping" in the developed world. 
  This move is extremely distressing. The G-7, especially the 
US and the European Union are pushing developing countries to 
see how far they will go in accomodating the former's 
protectionist moves. The inclusion of environmental 
protectionism, "green barriers to trade" and the threat of 
countering "social dumping" by banning products produced by 
cheap labour are the latest weapons in their arsenals. 
  But all these aim at undoing the gains of the Uruguay Round. 
  Such attempts by the West are not new. For over two years 
Western governments have been linking political, especailly 
human rights and environmental issues to economic relations with 
the developing economies. 
  Developing world leaders have reacted sharply to the above 
moves. Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao made a hard-hitting 
speech at the G-15 summit in New Delhi against the unilateral 
interpretation of some of the provisions of the GATT against the 
interests of the developing countries. 
  He cautioned the advanced economies against putting up 
artificial barriers to free trade. 
  The Malaysian prime minister, Mahatir Mohammad, speaking in 
a 
similar vein criticised the West for resorting to measures 
detrimental to the interests of the developing countries. He 
urged all developing countries to come together to oppose the 
"social clause". 
  It is in this context that the final agreement in April on 
GATT, will be taken.

  [Text] India is to ask the ESCAP [Economic and Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific] member countries to oppose 
any neoprotectionist trade barriers. Speaking to newsmen on the 
issues before the ESCAP New Delhi meet, the commerce secretary, 
Mr. Tejinder Khanna, said neoprotectionism should not be allowed 
to cast its shadow on the post-Uruguay Round of world trade [as 
heard]. India, he said, is opposed to creation of roadblocks in 
the free flow of global trade under any pretext. He said New 
Delhi firmly believes that bilateral and multilateral 
differences should not come in the way of regional economic and 
trade cooperation. There is also a need for greater interaction 
between the business community of the ESCAP countries without 
interference from the government. The commerce secretary hoped 
that the golden jubilee session of the ESCAP being inaugurated 
by the prime minister this morning will endorse our stand and 
establish a trade information network for the purpose. 
  The ESCAP executive secretary, Mr. Rafiuddin Ahmad, told 
newsmen that member countries have to be watchful of insidious 
attempts of protectionism in world trade. 
  The chairman of the session and commerce minister, Mr. 
Pranab 
Mukherjee, has said technology transfer is an important element 
in strengthening regional cooperation. He stated this is an 
interview with our special correspondent, A.K. Sengupta, 
broadcast in the Spotlight program last night. Mr. Mukherjee 
said the Asia-Pacific Center have been shifted to New Delhi with 
India developing an indigenous base for appropriate technologies 
relevant to the member countries. 
  Representatives of 48 member countries and 10 associate 
members will participate in the week-long conference.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ravindranath Mishra] </F>
  [Text] The golden jubilee session of the United Nations 
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, ESCAP, 
beginning in New Delhi today assumes significance as it is being 
held on the eve of signing of the GATT. The commission, one of 
the largest of the five regional commissions, provides an 
opportunity for the governments to meet every year to review and 
discuss economic and social issues to promote and strengthen 
regional cooperation. Its basic role is that of a think tank 
and a catalyst for regional ventures such as the Asian 
Development Bank and the Asian Highway Network. It executes a 
wide range of programs and projects to stimulate growth and 
improve socioeconomic conditions. The present forum has created 
an integrated communication infrastructure for the Asian region 
besides conceiving the trans-Asia railway system and the Asia 
Pacific telecommunity. The Asian Development Bank also set up 
at the initiative of the commission has a big impact on the 
region's development. 
  During its nine-day meeting, the 48 members and 10 associate 
members will discuss key issues like strengthening of 
infrastructure, fiscal reforms, population control and 
development, environment, poverty alleviation, and waste 
management. The commission will have a special discussion on 
the problems faced by the least developed countries and 
landlocked countries. India will try to impress upon the 
commission that unprecedented growth withnessed by the ASEAN 
countries should spill over to other members of the ESCAP 
family. New Delhi is also of the opinion that economic 
cooperation in the region must get precedence over political 
issues and more importantly neoprotectionism should not be 
allowed to cast its shadow on the new GATT. 
  When the 118 countries are preparing to sign the new GATT in 
about two weeks time, the third world countries are appalled by 
the reported move of the United States to include nontariff 
barriers for exports of the developing countries. The session 
will provide an invaluable opportunity to these countries to 
share their perceptions on the issue and work out a common stand.

  [Text] The prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, has cautioned 
the developed countries that it would be counterproductive to 
create problems for the developing countries in free flow of 
resources, capital, technology, and market access. Opening the 
golden jubilee session of the United Nation's Economic and 
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific -- ESCAP -- in New 
Delhi today, he said the third world countries should resist any 
move to put extraneous concerns on the trade agenda after the 
conclusion of GATT treaty. He said the Western countries are 
trying to use social and environmental issues for nullifying the 
comparative advantage of the developing countries. Urging the 
rich countries to understand the aspirations of the Third World 
countries to catch up with the rest of the world, he said a 
great opportunity will be lost if instead of concentrating 
efforts to globalize the benefits from GATT, fresh impediments 
are introduced in the form of unjustified controversies. Calling 
upon the members for adopting the real declaration on 
environment protection, Mr. Rao said it is a comprehensive 
declaration with a broader charter which not only addresses the 
present ecological and developmental problems, but also aims at 
preparing the world for the challenges of the next century. 
Appreciating the role of the commission, he said it provides a 
vast scope for mutual cooperation among the nations of the 
region in the development of infrastructure. Highlighting the 
importance of massive investment in the social sector, he said 
poverty alleviation must be addressed on priority basis, if the 
goal of sustainable development is to be achieved. He called 
for sharing the benefits of human capital formation and 
technological development among the countries of the commission. 
The prime minister urged the members of the Asia Pacific region 
to give highest priority and unconditional support to the 
imperatives of economic cooperation, including trade, 
investment, technology transfer, and tourism over the other 
aspects of mutual relations. 
  The Commerce minister, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, was unanimously 
elected chairman of the session. His name was proposed by China 
and was seconded by Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Mongolia. 
  The executive secretary of ESCAP, Mr. Rafiuddin Ahmad, in 
his 
report to the conference asked member countries to remain on 
guard against imposition of new forms of nontariff barriers 
after the new GATT deal comes into force. He said already 
attempts are being made to impose restrictions to affect the 
exports of the developing countries. About the ESCAP agenda, he 
outlined an action plan for greater focus on infrastructure 
development in the region. One hundred and forty billion 
dollars will be needed every year to improve the network of 
road, communication, and power generation facilities. Since the 
external assistance will not be forthcoming to the required 
extent, pragmatic measures will be necessary to mobilize 
resources through private sector participation and efficient 
operation. This action plan will be adopted as the New Delhi 
Declaration. 
  Our correspondent covering the conference reports that 
Armenia has been admitted as a member of the ESCAP though it is 
not a part of the Asia Pacific region. This has been done as a 
special case following a request from the former Soviet 
Republic. Today's discussions are covering recent economic and 
social developments in the region and their impact as also the 
need for sustainable development.

<F P=106> [Commentary by K.S. Jayraman] </F>
  [Text] The reports that Japan's fast-breeder reactor is 
expected to go critical should be good news to India's nuclear 
scientists. India and Japan appear to be the only two countries 
pursuing the breeder technology in today's world that has become 
hostile to this new source of electric power. The hostility 
stems from two reasons. 
  One is the safety consideration, because of the complex 
technology involved in breeder reactors. It is for this reason 
that France, which pioneered the breeder technology, decided to 
shut down its 1,200-megawatt fast-breeder reactor. 
  To appreciate the second reason, one must know what a 
breeder 
is. The fast-breeder reactor has a core made of plutonium fuel 
surrounded by a blanket of natural uranium. During the chain 
reaction, more plutonium is created in the blanket than what is 
consumed in the core, and hence the name breeder. One simply 
has to remove the blanket, extract the plutonium, and build 
another breeder with it or use the plutonium to build a bomb. 
  It is this possibility of nuclear proliferation that is at 
the heart of the American campaign against plutonium. In the 
United States spent nuclear fuel is not reprocessed to recover 
plutonium, and Washington does not want any other nation to 
produce plutonium, even for power generation, because of its 
fear that it can be diverted for bombs. 
  Interest in fast-breeders declined for yet another reason. 
In the 1970's it was anticipated that a spread of conventional 
reactors would lead to a shortage of uranium and make plutonium 
the fuel of choice. But this did not happen. Japan relies 
almost totally on the outside world for energy. It sees 
fast-breeder technology is a promising route to reduce this 
dependence. Japan's prototype fast-breeder reactor Monju will 
produce 280 megawatts when it begins full operation next year. 
  India's compulsion to go into fast-breeder technology is 
dictated by the fact that while its uranium resources are 
limited, it has large deposits of thorium, which can be turned 
into a nuclear fuel. In order to efficiently make this 
conversion, India has to build fast-breeder reactors with cores 
made of plutonium and blankets out of thorium. India's 
fast-breeder test reactor at Kalpakkam, near Madras, is about 10 
years old, but its power level is nowhere near the designed 40 
megwatt. It has succeeded in convincing Indian scientists that 
the technology is difficult to master but not impossible to 
learn. 
  India no doubt is way behind Japan in harnessing this power 
source, but its consolation is that it is not alone in pursuing 
this technology. Whether India will be able to commit enough 
resources to pursue its goal like Japan is, however, a big 
question mark.

  [Text] After concluding his visit to New Delhi, Deputy 
Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin said that there is no reason for 
Israel not to sell arms to India. Beilin stressed, however, 
that he has no knowledge of any joint military plans between the 
two countries. Beilin asserted that the potential for 
cooperation between India and Israel is unlimited. The deputy 
foreign minister expressed the hope that India will become more 
involved in the peace process.

  [Text] Under the headline "Coordination and Consultation 
Summit", AL-THAWRAH writes: Inter-Arab coordination and 
national and pan-Arab parameters are cornerstones of Syria's 
policies. It has thus managed to scotch Israel's circuitous 
tactics and deny it the opportunity to take on the Arab 
countries one at a time. Syria is universally acknowledged to 
be pursuing sound policies. Syria's key role and objective 
outlook in peacemaking have been equally recognized. 
  Israel's intransigence, the paper emphasizes, remains the 
real obstacle to the peace process. Unilateral deals have been 
shown to be unworkable. Arab coordination and consultations, 
AL-THAWRAH adds, are crucial to a successful common approach to 
Israel's attempts at dividing Arab ranks and deflecting the 
peace process from its set objective; namely a fair and 
comprehensive peace -- the peace of the brave, to quote 
President al-Asad at the Geneva summit. 
  Coordination and consultations between Syria and Egypt about 
the peace process and how to counter Israel's 
less-than-straightforward ways will go a long way toward forging 
a united stand as the Arabs wage the battle for peace. Only by 
adherence to national and pan-Arab parameters will it be 
possible to establish a fair and comprehensive peace and regain 
all the occupied land, free of any Jewish settlements, concludes 
AL-THAWRAH.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Political observers have followed with 
intense interest President Hafiz al-Asad's visit to the Arab 
Republic of Egypt and his talks with President Husni Mubarak, 
especially since the talks dealt with all aspects of the peace 
process and ways of attaining its objectives. It is known that 
holding Syrian-Egyptian consultations on hot regional issues has 
become a tradition in the life of the two countries. When these 
consultations rise to the level of a direct meeting between 
Presidents al-Asad and Mubarak, this emphasizes the importance 
of the topics under discussion. 
  In fact, the region is close to making a decision on the 
resumption of the peace talks in Washington. The parties 
directly involved in the peace are expected to hold a joint 
meeting to discuss the issue of resuming the talks and to emerge 
with a unified Arab stand. Consequently, it is natural for the 
two sisterly countries -- Syria and Egypt -- to hold 
consultations on the highest levels to assess the peace process 
and future prospects in light of regional developments and 
contacts with the United States. 
  It is common knowledge that the Geneva summit between 
Presidents al-Asad and Clinton has revived the world's hopes 
about the possibility of advancing the Middle East peace 
process. No progress has yet been made in this process due to 
Israel's intransigence and because the Zionist lobby in the 
United States has moved to disrupt any effective and influential 
U.S. role. The latest round of the Washington talks ended just 
as they started, without any significant results. Moreover, 
Israel has reciprocated the sincere Arab intentions with the 
Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. This was followed by President 
Clinton's reported commitment before Zionist organizations in 
the United States to keep unified Jerusalem as the capital of 
Israel, in contravention of UN Security Council Resolution 242 
and the policies of the previous U.S. Administrations, which 
refused to acknowledge the annexation of Arab Jerusalem and 
insisted on considering it part of the occupied territories. 
Afterward, the U.S. secretary of state expressed readiness to 
visit the region, but he said that he would not put any pressure 
on Israel. This is despite the fact that Israel's 
procrastination and maneuvering have made it impossible to make 
any progress. After this, the Zionist lobby in the United 
States pushed the U.S. Administration to adopt extortionist 
stands defaming Syria and aimed at dissuading it from its 
principled stands on the aspired peace in the Middle East. 
  All these issues and developments need meticulous Arab 
assessment. Syria has offered great services for the peace 
issue and frequently saved it from Israel's plotting. However, 
Syria does not negotiate for the sake of negotiations, but in 
quest for a genuine, just, comprehensive, and honorable peace 
that is based on the implementation of UN Security Council 
resolutions and leads to the return of Arab rights and 
territories. Syria has joined the peace process in the hope 
that the U.S. Administration will honor its pledges and play the 
role of a fair and impartial full partner. However, so far, 
pledges to play such a role have not been turned into tangible 
action. The talks are taking place in a vicious circle and 
Israel is committing massacres and crimes in front of the entire 
world. Meanwhile, the U.S. Administration refrains from 
condemning these massacres and crimes. Besides succumbing to 
the Zionist lobby, the U.S. Administration has also placed Syria 
on the list of terrorism. 
  Syria adheres to the bases of a just, comprehensive peace as 
outlined by the Madrid conference, the UN Security Council 
resolutions, and the meetings of the Arab foreign ministers. 
Syria is not in the habit of giving in to extortion or 
relinquishing its own or other Arab territory or any national 
and pan-Arab rights. Therefore, Syria holds consultations with 
its sisters, in particular Egypt. As shown by modern and 
ancient history, Syria and Egypt are the backbone and main power 
of the Arab nation. The Arab people everywhere pin great hopes 
on coordination between Syria and Egypt and on their efforts to 
revive pan-Arab solidarity and unify stands. President al-Asad 
headed for Cairo proceeding from these bases and principles and 
in his quest for a pan-Arab position that maintains the Arab 
nation's rights and stresses its concept of a just, 
comprehensive peace.

  [Excerpts] President Hafiz al-Asad returned to Damascus 
this afternoon after a two-day visit to the Arab Republic of 
Egypt. During the visit, he held talks with President Muhammad 
Husni Mubarak in four meetings, including two closed meetings. 
[passage omitted] 
  Talks dealt with the world situation and with several 
international issues, including matters pertaining to the 
Nonaligned Movement and its future role and activities. They 
also dealt with the peace process and the phases it has thus far 
gone through, as well as the situation of the peace talks on 
various tracks, the obstacles and difficulties Israel is placing 
in the face of this process, and the ongoing efforts and 
contacts to place this process on the path leading to the set 
and agreed objective of the peace process; namely, a just and 
comprehensive peace. It was agreed to continue contacts between 
the two sides. 
  The two sides also discussed the Arab situation from its 
various aspects in light of the tasks facing the Arabs in 
defending both their pan-Arab interests and the issues of their 
Arab nation. Emphasis was placed on the importance of improving 
inter-Arab relations and working for Arab solidarity that serves 
the interests of the Arab countries and the joint pan-Arab 
interest. 
  The two sides reaffirmed their concern for the territorial 
integrity and sovereignty of the Arab countries. They reviewed 
developments in the crisis in fraternal Yemen, and reiterated 
their call on the Yemeni brothers to continue to work to 
circumvent the ongoing crisis and preserve unity. The two sides 
stressed their concern for the unity of Sudan's land and people. 
They also discussed the Libyan Jamahiriyah's crisis with the 
Western states, and expressed their sympathy with the fraternal 
Jamahiriyah. 
  The two sides reviewed the development of bilateral 
relations, and voiced satisfaction with what was achieved in 
terms of implementing both the instructions of the two 
presidents and the decisions made by the Joint Higher 
Syrian-Egyptian Committee. They agreed that the committee will 
hold its next meeting in Cairo in the middle of next month.

  [Text] Commenting on President Hafiz al-Asad's visit to 
Egypt, AL-BA'TH says: President Hafiz al-Asad's talks with 
President Husni Mubarak have attracted much attention in the 
Arab nation and the world. The reason for this is the current 
situation in the region and that of the peace process. The 
peace process is still at square one because of the intransigent 
Israeli position. 
  AL-BA'TH notes that the two presidents discussed 
developments 
in the Arab arena, the peace process, and the obstacles placed 
by Israel in the wayh of peace. 
  The Arabs, Syria in particular, have done everything 
possible, in line with the resolutions of international 
legitimacy, so the peace process will achieve its objectives. 
President Mubarak has stressed that the Geneva summit between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton gave great momentum to 
the peace process. However, the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre 
obstructed this process. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes: Israel does not want peace. It only 
seeks agreements, such as the Gaza-Jericho accord, because such 
agreements achieve its dreams. At any rate, Syria will continue 
to work seriously to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in 
the region, but for peace to prevail Syria must restore its 
territory in full.

  [Text] At a meeting in Damascus today with the leaders of 
the 10 Palestinian groups, Deputy Majles Speaker Hasan Ruhani 
stressed: The massacre of the Muslims at al-Khalil Mosque shows 
that the Zionist regime will never shed its savage streak. 
  The secretary of our country's Supreme National Security 
Council added: The demonstrations on International Jerusalem Day 
show that not only did the Zionist regime not achieve its cursed 
aims in the al-Khalil incident but that the affection of the 
world Muslims for the Palestinians has increased. 
  Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah, the secretary-general of the 
Lebanese 
revolutionary movement Hizballah, at a meeting with the deputy 
Majles speaker this morning, thanked the esteemed leader 
[Khamene'i], the president, the Majles speaker, and the people

"Syria's Dynamic Position"] 
  [Text] Dennis Ross, the U.S. overall Middle East 
coordinator, has emphasized Washington's appreciation of Syria's 
central and meaningful role in the peace process. 
  The renewed recognition of the Syrian role brings to mind 
the 
fact that there can be no peace in the region without Syria and 
that, with its intransigence, prevarication, and aggressive 
line, Israel is the only obstacle to the peace process. 
  That peace without Syria is impossible is now obvious. 
Syria's contribution to launching the peace process and 
correcting its course has been universally acknowledged. We now 
know with the benefit of experience that there is no ignoring 
Syria if the peace process is to be sustained and its objectives 
fulfilled. 
  If it were not for Syria's consent to the American 
initiative 
and its positive approach to all the efforts that set out to 
energize the peace process, the 30-month process would not have 
lasted long. 
  Syria has consistently been the party most committed to the 
peace process and the foundations and points of reference on 
which it was launched. The one condition Syria set for its 
participation in the process was that it be an effective 
framework and worthwhile means to achieve real and enduring 
peace predicated on principles of justice and international 
legitimacy. In other words, peace that assures all parties's 
rights -- the peace of the brave as President Hafiz al-Asad 
called it at the Geneva summit. 
  The peace process might have made strides. If only Israel 
took it as seriously as Syria did and tried to approach the 
whole exercise from the standpoint of a nation interested in a 
just and lasting peace. In practice, however, Israel is using 
the peace process as a means to buy time and a platform to 
distort the foundations of peace and replace the Madrid formula 
with separate deals that can only hinder the movement of the 
process and whip up regional tension that could erupt in an 
explosion at any minute. 
  Israel has deployed all its practiced skills in 
prevarication, trickery, and craftiness to make sure that the 
peace process never moves toward its set goal; that is, peace 
grounded in the Madrid formula and UN resolutions. Having 
failed in its effort to bring the peace process to a complete 
halt or deflect it from its course, it turned to open aggression 
and crimes with the aim of destroying the process. It is in 
this context that one can make sense out of the Hebron massacre 
and the ensuing savage escalation against the Palestinian people 
and the threats Israel is issuing against Lebanon for having 
spurned its blackmailing tactics and stuck to its national and 
pan-Arab principles. Lebanon is being targeted because it has 
opted for intra-Arab coordination as the road to a just and 
comprehensive peace under which national and pan-Arab rights are 
restored. 
  To break the logjam in the peace process and relaunch it 
toward its set objective will take a clear international stand 
in which the U.S. Administration plays a key role. Maximum 
pressure must also to be brought to bear if Israel is to be 
talked out of its current line of aggression and crime and into 
an open acceptance of the guidelines of the peace process as 
laid out in the Madrid formula and its key component -- the 
land-for-peace principle. There should be strict adherence to 
the substance of this formula on the part of Israel if a 
universal settlement on all fronts is to be achieved. Only such 
a solution will guarantee the establishment of complete peace in 
the region. The logic of aggression, crime, and occupation does 
not square with peace.

<F P=106> ["AL-THAWRAH Issues" column by Muhammad 'Ali Buzah: "Going </F>
Too Far and the Need for Retaliation"] 
  [Text] It seems that the massacre perpetrated against the 
Palestinian people inside the holy Ibrahimi Mosque last February 
was only the beginning. It was another test balloon through 
which the Tel Aviv rulers aimed to measure the international 
community's reaction to and influence on the course of events. 
Despite the existing peace process and all attempts at 
self-restraint by the Arabs, these events are becoming 
increasingly tragic and bloody and -- due to the Israeli policy 
-- are placing the region at the point of no return, moving it 
toward a catastrophic conflagration that could take place at any 
moment. 
  All news agencies and political observers were unanimous 
that 
the events that have taken place in Hebron during the past 24 
hours and the large-scale Israeli military operations carried 
out by thousands of occupation forces -- operations which turned 
the city that has been besieged for one month into a battlefield 
targeting congested Palestinian areas and in which houses next 
to the mosque were destroyed by rockets and anti-tank missiles 
-- are a new massacre. These events and military operations show 
that last month's massacre was only the beginning and that the 
perpetrator is different only in name. There is no difference 
between a regular soldier wearing a helmet and an armed settler. 
The settlers are the backbone and the reserve of the Israeli 
military force; they are also the spearhead and tool of 
expansion, aggression, terrorism, and organized crime. 
  The new massacre in Hebron coincided with the endeavor of 
the 
Clinton administration, in the form of moves by U.S. coordinator 
Dennis Ross in the involved capitals, to activate the peace 
process and to give momentum to the obstructed peace process, as 
well as in the wake of Security Council Resolution 904. In 
addition, the new massacre coincided with the feverish Israeli 
military escalation against the cities and villages in southern 
Lebanon. Israeli crimes and killings have reached even school 
children. All this does not hold out any hope that Israel will 
succumb to the will of peace, that it will respect the points of 
reference, that it will respect the resolutions of international 
legitimacy and its charters, that it will abandon belligerence 
and racist terrorism, or that it will restore the Arab's usurped 
lands and rights. 
  These events present new evidence of the aggressive nature 
rooted deeply in the Zionist strategy and of its impossible 
coexistence with peace. These events also emphasize the need to 
exert international pressure, to abandon quiet diplomacy, and to 
adopt the language of force in order to make the rulers of 
Israel follow the right path and accept the requirements of a 
just and comprehensive peace with which all occupation injustice 
and evils will end and rights will be returned to their owners. 
  Israel's practices and continued bloody terrorism have 
raised 
many important questions regarding peace, its feasibility, and 
the credibility of those responsible for implementing the 
resolutions of international legitimacy and for maintaining 
world peace. Israel's practices and bloody terrorism constitute 
a serious threat that needs a firm and swift response from the 
international community and the U.S. sponsor -- whose role, 
initiative, and interests are being targeted -- to champion 
credibility and resolutions that are still being violated openly 
so that Israel will not remain above the laws of the 
international community and above questioning and punishment. 
  We do not need to wait longer to see more massacres and 
slaughtering by the Tel Aviv rulers who kill every opportunity 
for peace. We, as well as the world, want to see the 
resolutions of international legitimacy implemented 
expeditiously in order to protect and secure the citizens in the 
occupied territories. A firm stand should be taken to curb 
Israeli aggression and to force it to withdraw from all occupied 
Arab territory.

  [Excerpts] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, returned to Sanaa in God's 
protection at 1330 today after paying official visits to the 
Sultanate of Oman and the State of Qatar. 
  He led a high-level delegation to the two countries, and 
held 
talks with his brothers His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id of 
Oman and His Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, amir 
of Qatar. His talks dealt with the fraternal relations between 
our country and both sisterly countries, the current 
developments in our country, and the efforts to contain the 
political crisis and safeguard the national unity march, in 
addition to the regional, Arab, and international issues and 
developments of interest to our country, to fraternal Oman and 
Qatar, to the region, and to our Arab nation. 
  On his arrival at Sanaa International Airport, the brother 
Presidential Council chairman made a statement. He said: We 
are satisfied with the outcome of our visits to Oman and Qatar 
and with the talks we held with my brothers His Majesty Sultan 
Qabus Bin-Sa'id of Oman and His Highness Shaykh Khalifah 
Bin-Hamad Al Thani, amir of Qatar. These talks were positive 
and fruitful. We sensed a sincere fraternal understanding of 
the overall issues discussed, whether regarding the ongoing 
developments in our country, the regional issues, or the Arab 
developments of interest to our country, to both sisterly 
countries, and to our Arab nation. 
  He added: The talks particularly dealt with developments in 
our country and the exertion of efforts to contain the political 
crisis and its negative repercussions on the national situation 
as well as its threats posed to stability in our country and the 
region. 
  Chairman Salih concluded: We were pleased with the 
understanding and care shown by our brothers in Oman and Qatar 
who emphasized backing for our people and their unlimited 
support for Yemeni unity and democracy as a national gain for 
our people and as a pan-Arab gain for the sons of our Arab 
nation. 
  A session of official talks between our country and Qatar 
was 
held at the Amiri Court in Doha at 0930, Sanaa time, today. 
The session was led by brothers Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, and His Highness Shaykh Khalifah 
Bin-Hamad Al Thani, amir of fraternal Qatar. [passage omitted] 
  Talks dealt with Yemeni developments. The brother chairman 
briefed his brother His Highness the amir of Qatar on the 
outcome of the efforts and mediations being made to achieve 
national accord in our country, contain the political crisis, 
end all its negative repercussions, and implement the document 
of pledge and accord. The latest of these efforts was the 
meeting held between brothers Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, and his deputy, 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, in Salalah in the presence of His Majesty Sultan Qabus 
Bin-Sa'id of fraternal Oman. 
  Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani reaffirmed Qatar's care 
for Yemen's unity and its support for all efforts and good 
offices designed to end the crisis between the brothers in Yemen 
and to spread security and stability throughout Yemen in order 
to preserve the gains of the fraternal Yemeni people. The amir 
of Qatar also expressed his great confidence in the wisdom of 
both the leadership and the various national and political 
forces and in their ability to circumvent this crisis and 
respond to the Yemeni people's aspirations. 
  Talks also reviewed the recent developments in the Middle 
East peace process and regional developments. The two leaders 
also exchanged views on all that would enhance Arab and Islamic 
solidarity. Moreover, the talks dealt with ways to consolidate 
and promote fraternal relations in various fields in a way that 
will benefit both sisterly countries and peoples.

  [Text] A responsible source has stated to the Yemeni News 
Agency, SABA', that a number of news agencies and newspapers 
have carried inaccurate reports on the proceedings of the 
meetings that took place in the Omani city of Salalah between 
brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Presidential 
Council chairman, and brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice chairman 
of the Presidential Council, in the presence of His Majesty 
Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id of Oman, and the subsequent bilateral 
meeting between the brother chairman of the Presidential Council 
and his deputy. The source regretted the unjustified confusion 
and anxiety that those incorrect reports have caused among the 
public. The source indicated that although those meetings did 
not emerge with the results that all Yemenis had looked forward 
to, they did help stress the need to abide by the pledge and 
accord document and to swiftly implement the decisions that the 
Council of Ministers made during its meetings in the economic 
and trade capital [Aden], especially regarding security and 
military issues.

  [Text] Yesterday, Yemeni southerners accused northerners of 
mobilizing forces on the former border between the two parts of 
Yemen, considering this a serious military escalation. This 
came in a statement by Ahmad 'Abdallah Salih, deputy secretary 
of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. 
  A responsible source at the General People's Congress [GPC] 
-- a northern official -- responded to these accusations by 
saying that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih rejected, during the 
Salalah meeting, a southern proposal implying divisionist 
trends, calling for returning all northern and southern military 
units to their pre-unity positions. 
  The same source noted that the Yemeni Presidential Council 
will not be able to hold its scheduled meeting tomorrow because 
the second man in the YSP refuses to come to Sanaa to 
participate in the meeting. 
  It is noteworthy that the Yemeni Presidential Council is a 
collective presidential body including five members -- three 
from the North and two from the South. The two members from the 
South are 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his deputy Salim Salih Muhammad.

<F P=106> [Reports by Hammud Munsir in Aden and Lutfi Shatarah in </F>
London: "Yemeni Diplomat Obstructs Arms Deal Between Sanaa and 
Warsaw"] 
  [Excerpt] Muhammad Sharaf, the Yemeni charge d'affaires in 
the Polish capital Warsaw, has obstructed an arms deal worth 
hundreds of millions of dollars which the northern leadership in 
Sanaa was arranging through a contract between the Economic and 
Military Foundation, whose name has recently been changed to the 
Yemeni Economic Foundation, and the Polish Arms and Foreign 
Trade Company. 
  The deal included what has been described as 
"internationally 
banned fragmentation bombs," aircraft, spare parts, and various 
types of other weapons including light ammunition. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that the charge d'affaires 
refused to grant visas to five of the Polish company's senior 
sales officials. He also informed the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] leadership in Aden of the situation on the grounds that 
the deal was part of the military repercussions of the Yemeni 
political crisis and that it would undermine Yemen's national 
Army. 
  Colonel 'Abdallah al-Hadrami, director of the Yemeni 
Economic 
and Military Foundation, had sent a letter to Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salim Basindwah in Sanaa asking him to grant the 
delegation a visa to enable it to complete the agreement on the 
deal, but Sharaf refused to carry out the foreign minister's 
instructions and the visit was suspended. The delegation was 
supposed to arrive in the Yemeni capital on 6 April. 
  YSP officials in Aden have raised questions about the source 
of funds for such a deal and also about the attitude of the 
Foreign Ministry or rather about the way the Yemeni leadership 
used that ministry, bearing in mind that Basindwah had issued a 
circular to all Yemeni diplomatic missions instructing them to 
refrain from any actions that would reflect partisan views and 
urged foreign states to deal directly with the Foreign Ministry. 
  Yemeni sources have confirmed that Sanaa has recently opened 
two offices for the purchase of arms in the Russian capital 
Moscow and the Ukrainian capital Kiev. In a telephone statement 
to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in London, they said that a well-known 
Yemeni businessman was supervising the Moscow office and 
negotiating contracts on behalf of the north Yemeni leadership 
with the Russian authorities, some covering 60 fragmentation 
bombs, each worth $350,000, as well as missiles which have been 
shipped to al-Hudaydah port through Bulgaria. 
  The sources said that Muhammad Sharaf, the Yemeni charge 
d'affaires in Warsaw, contacted the home of Yemeni Mrime 
Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attass in the evening of the day 
before yesterday while the Yemeni Political Forces Dialogue 
Committee was in session, and informed him of the matter. 
Al-'Attas then reported what he heard directly to the Dialogue 
Committee. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 5 Apr (MENA)--Sources from the Palestinian 
and Israeli delegations have agreed that substantial differences 
are impeding the current negotiations in Cairo to implement the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  The sources said that these negotiations are going through 
"a 
crisis," despite some positive statements. 
  The Palestinian sources told MENA that the Israeli side 
continues to refuse to draw up a definite timetable for the 
withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
They added that the Israeli side is also refusing to draw up a 
timetable for the entry of the Palestinian police and 
specifications for the type of weapons to be used by this force. 
  The Palestinian sources went on to say that the Israeli 
side, 
which has mainly used civilian negotiators with the exception of 
Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, wants to ignore the 
Palestinian military commanders' view of the security and 
military situation in Gaza and Jericho. They added that these 
commanders are demanding a definite timetable for the entry of 
their main forces into the Palestinian self-rule area in the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho area. They are also demanding an 
agreement on the type of weapons needed for these forces to 
achieve security in the areas from which Israel will withdraw. 
  The Palestinian sources said the Israeli side is offering 
the following measures in "a general and nonspecific working 
paper," which it called "a timetable" for withdrawal from the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho and for the entry of the Palestinian 
police force: 
  1. Setting up a temporary Palestinian-Israeli coordinating 
team and the entry of Palestinian commanders. 
  2. Setting up liaison offices for officers from both 
sides. 
  3. The entry of additional Palestinian commanders, 
between 20 and 30, and an early entry of a basic force of 
Palestinian forces, 300 people, within a week of signing the 
agreement. 
  4. Completing the withdrawal from the Gaza area. 
  5. Completing the withdrawal from the Khan Yunus area. 
  6. Completing the withdrawal from the Jericho area. 
  7. Establishing the Palestinian authority and the start 
of the Israeli withdrawal from the city of Jericho and Gaza. 
  8. The entry of the main body of the Palestinian police, 
between 1,000 and 1,500. 
  The Palestinian sources added that according to this general 
and nonspecific Israeli paper, agreement is to be reached on the 
timetable for starting the work of the Joint Coordination 
Committee and the group of commanders and several additional 
commanders will then enter. But the Israeli paper explains that 
this measure might not be necessary. 
  The paper believes that the implementation of these steps 
will start two days after the signing of the executive agreement 
covering the Gaza-Jericho First Agreement and that the process 
of implementing its steps will take between one week and 21 days. 
  The Palestinian sources said the paper makes it clear that 
there is no indication either of a specific timetable for the 
entry of the remaining Palestinian police force, which, it was 
agreed on in principle will consist of 10,000 people, or of its 
weaponry. 
  According to Israeli delegation sources, the Palestinian 
side retreated from the Cairo Accord signed in early February by 
PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, 
and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in the presence of 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat under the sponsorship of 
President Husni Mubarak. 
  The Israeli delegation sources told MENA: Had we pursued the 
negotiations on the basis of the Cairo Accord and the outcome of 
subsequent meetings, we could have reached agreement in two 
weeks. The sources noted that no such problems existed 
previously. The same sources say an agreement for the entry of 
300 Palestinian policemen was supposed to take effect today. 
  The Israeli sources said talk of a timetable "blocks" the 
negotiations from the Israeli point of view. The same sources 
noted that Israel is committed to implementing the Cairo Accord 
and that Israel has indeed begun to dismantle camps in the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho, adding: But we do not see the Palestinian 
side serious about the negotiations. 
  The sources pointed out that no agreement has been reached 
on 
the Palestinian forces' deployment in Gaza and Jericho and that 
the Israeli withdrawal will not take place unless such an 
agreement is reached. The same sources referred to chief 
Israeli negotiator General Amnon Shahaq's threat to walk out. 
  Palestinian and Israeli sources said the other committees at 
the negotiations continued their work but that the water issue 
was not discussed because the experts from the Palestinian side 
who are concerned with this issue did not show up. 
  The Civil Affairs Committee continued working until 0100 
today. 
  Hasan 'Asfur, a member of the Palestinian delegation to the 
Security Affairs Committee, summarized the situation for MENA, 
saying that the negotiations were difficult because they dealt 
with sensitive issues concerning security arrangements. He 
added that the two sides will continue discussing these issues 
to work out a solution. He affirmed that the Palestinian side 
is serious in its efforts to reach an agreement and noted that 
the delay in the talks is due to the delay in issues concerning 
security. 'Asfur said: We hope we will not reach a situation 
where the negotiations will be threatened. 
  MENA has learned that the Palestinian side held a meeting 
this morning to coordinate positions and discuss the current 
stage of the talks.

  [Text] Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat arrived in Amman 
today on a visit to Jordan. 
  He was received at the airport by Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali, the prime minister; Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, the 
information minister and minister of state for cabinet affairs; 
Faysal al-Husayni, the head of the Palestinian negotiating 
delegation; Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh and Yasir 'Amr, PLO Executive 
Committee members; al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, Palestinian 
ambassador in Amman; and Muhammad Qudsiyah, the commander of the 
Palestine Liberation Army in Jordan. 
  In a statement to journalists upon arrival at Amman Airport, 
'Arafat said: I am visiting Jordan to have the honor of meeting 
with His Majesty King Husayn to exchange views with him at this 
important time. His Majesty King Husayn has always been close 
to the Palestinian people and their national cause, may God 
watch over him. 
  Answering a question on the deportees' return, the 
Palestinian president said: This is another positive sign down 
the road. He expressed the hope that more deportees will 
return. In this regard, he said: I will leave actions to speak 
for themselves. He added: The talks are still taking place with 
Israel on various issues. I hope that progress will also be 
made at the economic talks which will be held in Paris tomorrow. 
  Concerning the security of Palestinians, 'Arafat said: The 
Cairo talks constitute a mechanism to implement UN Security 
Council Resolution No. 904. He expressed the belief that this 
is a fair beginning, especially since this is the first time 
that there has been international protection for the Palestinian 
people and the holy places. He called on the cosponsors of the 
peace talks to assume their responsibility and coordinate and 
cooperate with each other to implement this resolution.

  [Excerpts] First to 'Afula where a car bomb exploded three 
meters from a bus. Latest reports say five people were killed, 
another 35 at least wounded. The incident occurred near a 
cultural center. Apparently there was a suicide bomber in the 
car. Neil Samba has the story. Neil: 
  [Samba] The explosion occurred at around 1230 near the 
cultural center of 'Afula not far from the town's ... er, in the 
center of the 'Afula, not far from the town's main auditorium. 
Latest reports speak of five dead and 35 injured, but these 
figures are changing and constantly being updated. Reports from 
[words indistinct] say that the injuries range from light to 
serious. Some of the injured were on the bus and others were 
waiting at a nearby bus station. All of the injured are being 
taken to the (?Haemic) hospital. The evacuation continues at 
this hour. We've just heard though that two of those seriously 
injured were taken to Haifa, Haifa's Rambam hospital. Northern 
district police commander Jacob Grenel was the first to confirm 
that it was in fact a car bomb that exploded near an Egged bus, 
but he said it's not clear whether it was a suicide bomber or 
whether the bomb was set off by remote control. 
  The explosion took place three to four meters from a bus 
stop. [passage omitted]. Dozens of ambulances arrived on the 
scene within minutes after the explosion and the police closed 
off the area. Police reinforcements were sent into the town and 
engineers are combing the area. The center of 'Afula has been 
closed off. [passage omitted] A lot of details are still 
unclear at this time.

correspondent that on top of gaining control of two fortified 
positions of Dostam's militia, capturing some strategic points, 
and killing dozens of the militia near the old town of Baghlan, 
the mojahedin and the forces of the Islamic army continue their 
advance toward the old city of Baghlan. In the course of this 
operation some heavy and light weapons of the militia have been 
captured by the devotees of Islam. Security sources added that 
due to the loss of the control of those positions, the moral of 
the militia was extremely weakened and that they mostly abandon 
their positions and trenches without any resistance and escape.

  [Text] Pakistan has told the United States that it will 
never compromise on its vital security matters by unilaterally 
revising its nuclear program. This was conveyed by the chief of 
the Army Staff during his talks in Washington with senior U.S. 
officials including Defense Secretary William Perry, National 
Security Adviser Anthony Lake, and Deputy Secretary of State 
Strobe Talbott. He made it clear that Pakistan will not 
consider U.S. proposals on nuclear nonproliferation in South 
Asia until India also accepts them. Bilateral military 
cooperation between Pakistan and the United States and 
cooperation in security matters also came up during these 
meetings. 
  The Army chief apprised the U.S. authorities of Pakistan's 
security concerns, especially India's increasing military 
capability, and its effects on Pakistan's vital interests. He 
told the U.S. authorities that India is amassing weapons, 
thereby widening the military imbalance in the region. It will 
harm South Asian regional security and further heighten the 
existing tension in the region.

  [Excerpts] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi has 
today instructed that there will be no movement of people from 
1900 to 0500 [as heard] in the Burnt Forest area which has 
recently been the scene of clashes. President Moi said the 
instruction takes effect from today and will continue until such 
time as peace will have been completely restored in the area. 
[one-minute break in reception] instructed the provincial 
administration to facilitate the formation of village committees 
in the various settlement farm to enhance and maintain order. 
He warned that any village that will be found to have 
instigated violence of any order will be fined heavily, apart 
from other legal measures being taken against them. The 
president told the two communities, the Kalenjin and the Kikuyu, 
living in Burnt Forest to also form youth groups who will be the 
watchdog of the villagers. 
  The president explained that the recent clashes in the area 
erupted when two Kikuyu youths hurled a grenade at two Kalenjin 
youngsters who fortunately were not killed. He said following 
the attack, the police arrested the attackers but some people 
took the law into their hands and sparked off tribal animosity 
which led to the clashes. The president told the wananchi 
[citizens] in the area to abide by the law and report to the 
security agents whenever they are aggrieved, so that 
investigations could be carried out. President Moi instructed 
the police to hunt down some few people who are known to have 
incited the people by spreading falsehood. 
  The president cautioned the Wananchi against being incited 
to 
fight one another, saying that in the long run, they and their 
children will be the sufferers. President Moi particularly took 
a swipe at the DAILY NATION newspaper for fanning tribal 
animosity in the area by publishing false reports. President 
Moi said the media in the country should play a more responsible 
role of promoting a harmonious coexistence among the different 
communities in the country. 
  The president also called on the churches to preach to the 
people the importance of maintaining peace, instead of using the 
pulpit to criticize the government and making inflammatory 
statements. [passage omitted] 
  The head of state told the villagers in Burnt Forest to stop 
being alarmists by demolishing their homes and leaving behind 
their property while running away to urban centers. He 
explained that there are some people who have run away with 
their household goods to seek sympathy, claiming that their 
houses had been burnt when that was not the case. He said no 
one should be allowed to create the impression that some 
communities were being chased away from Burnt Forest and urged 
all the people in the area to return to their farm. 
  By a show of hands, the people in Burnt Forest assured the 
president that they were for peace and will cooperate with all 
those concerned to ensure that normalcy resumed. President Moi, 
at the same time, called on all leaders from the Burnt Forest 
and the surrounding areas to hold barazas [meetings] and 
emphasize to the people the need to live harmoniously. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] The golden jubilee session of the Economic and 
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific [ESCAP] begins in New 
Delhi tomorrow. At a joint press briefing with the ESCAP 
executive secretary in New Delhi today, the commerce secretary, 
Mr. Tejinder Khanna, said India will voice its concern at the 
meeting over any form of neoprotectionist measures in the 
post-Uruguay round of Trade and Tariff Agreement. He said we 
would not like any alibis to be trotted out to serve as a 
roadblock to global trade. The ESCAP executive secretary, Mr. 
Rafiuddin Ahmad, described the new GATT deal as a package of 
mutual benefit. He, however, said the member countries have to 
be watchful against any kind of protectionism and ensure that 
the agreement is implemented in letter and spirit.

  [Text] Baghdad, 5 Apr (INA)--The newspaper AL-'IRAQ has 
asserted that the United States is experiencing growing 
frustration because its criminal objectives against Iraq and its 
people have been thwarted. 
  In an article published here today, the paper adds: The 
United States is going to the limit in its aggressive approach. 
It is flouting all laws and norms, including the unfair 
resolutions passed by the UN Security Council. 
  The paper goes on to say: Those endowed with an analytical 
mind that enables them to read between the lines are well aware 
of the reasons prompting the United States to proceed with its 
anti-Iraq campaign. These reasons are manifest in the way the 
United States is managing this campaign. 
  The paper says: And within this context falls the bizarre 
U.S. position at the UN Security Council, and the U.S. 
determination to overlook the fact that the reasons for 
maintaining the anti-Iraq embargo have been fully removed, that 
Iraq has fulfilled its commitments toward the UN Security 
Council, particularly with regard to Resolution 687, and that 
the world body must honor its commitments toward our country 
through the rapid implementation of Paragraph 22. 
  AL-'IRAQ adds: It is the U.S. colonialist policy, which is 
rooted in hegemony and a willingness to do the impossible to 
promote the image of the Zionist entity as a key regional 
player, that is pushing the United States to circumvent this 
resolution, and to obstruct the crystallization of any fair 
relevant position that could be entertained by the other members 
of the UN Security Council. This was made clear during the UN 
Security Council's recent periodic review session. 
  AL-'IRAQ concludes by saying: The rancorous and intransigent 
U.S. position, which professes to uphold legitimacy and 
international law, has nothing to do with either of the two. As 
a matter of fact, it is the outcome of an evil and frenzied 
endeavor to weaken Iraq and cripple its pan-Arab and 
humanitarian role. 
  The paper urges the parties that have taken a constructive 
and fair position inside and outside the UN Security Council to 
promote their positions in the interest of true legitimacy and 
international law, which the United States seeks to undermine in 
order to advance its own interests and the interests of its 
agents and stooges, as well as its evil schemes.

<F P=106> [Article by Salah al-Mukhtar: "Waffling President Clinton </F>
Believes That Animal Rights Must Assume Precedence Over Human 
Rights"] 
  [Text] Nowadays, the waffling President Clinton seems 
careful to provide additional proof of his lack of balance, his 
lack of discrimination, and his lack of cognitive potential. 
For only yesterday, he threatened to impose economic sanctions 
on the PRC, which is currently enjoying most favored nation 
status. The reason is not the PRC's rejection of U.S. 
conditions, foremost among which is accepting the U.S. concept 
of human rights. We would like to say it again that Clinton's 
threats against the PRC were prompted neither by human rights 
issues, nor by the PRC position that the new Korean crisis 
created by the United States should be resolved peacefully. 
  What then could be the reason? This time, Clinton seeks to 
reaffirm that he has departed from the realm of common sense and 
entered the realm of the irrational. He has threatened the PRC, 
saying that it will be subjected to economic sanctions if does 
not halt its extermination of a certain species of tigers. Just 
imagine the waffling president, heir of criminal George Bush, 
seeking to impose economic sanctions on the PRC just to preserve 
Chinese tigers that are threatened with extinction. 
  The waffling President Clinton has become too blind to see 
his own lack of common sense and good reasoning. Nonetheless, 
when the survival of Chinese tigers is at stake, he too becomes 
vulnerable. He becomes willing to launch an economic war against 
China. By contrast, he is unwilling to halt the massacres he 
helped unleash in Iraq, Palestine, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
former Soviet republics, and elsewhere, in which scores and 
hundreds of people are killed every day. The reason is that the 
United States seeks to colonize the world after it has caused 
catastrophes, tragedies, genocides, and the rape of hundreds of 
thousands of women. 
  Have you ever heard of such nonsense? We have seen a 
semblance of waffling President Clinton's kind-heartedness on 
the face of his envoy Rolf Ekeus when he wept as skillfully as 
an actor, and then wiped his tears so he could proceed with his 
work, which is justifying the cold-blooded and heartless 
genocide targeting Iraqis. 
  Has humanity ever stooped so low? Have we ever seen a 
hypocrite, a liar, and a double-faced man as waffling President 
Clinton, who is defending animal rights while butchering and 
torturing thousands of people every day?

of organizations opposing the Iraqi regime, has said that 
Al-Hajj 'Abd-al-Latif al-Hajj Mahmud Bunniyah was killed in an
