  [Text] Baghdad, 2 Apr (INA) -- A delegation from the 
Jordanian House of Representatives arrived in Baghdad this 
afternoon on a visit to Iraq at the invitation of the National 
Assembly. The delegation is led by 'Abd Musa al-Nahar, deputy

  In a statement to INA, al-Nahar urged the Arab nation to 
intensify efforts on the Arab and international levels to lift 
the unjust embargo against Iraq and to support the people of 
Iraq to enable them to achieve their legitimate aspirations for 
progress. 
  He also praised the steadfastness of the Iraqi people under 
the leadership of President Saddam Husayn in the face of the 
U.S.- Atlantic-Zionist conspiracy that targets the Arab nation 
and its civilization. He pointed out that the people of Jordan 
view with admiration and appreciation the heroic actions of 
their brothers in Iraq in defense of the nation's honor and 
dignity against the odious foreign aggression that seeks to 
assassinate all human and cultural aspects of life. 
  The delegation is made up of 14 members who represent 
various 
Jordanian political parties.

  [Text] Baghdad, 5 Apr (INA)--Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 
'Aziz today received a delegation from the Jordanian House of 
Representatives headed by Deputy House Speaker 'Abd Musa 
al-Nahar. 
  The deputy prime minister explained in detail the human 
suffering and the [word indistinct] effect of the unfair 
embargo, which certain tyrannical and domineering parties at the 
UN Security Council seek to perpetuate, despite the fact that 
Iraq has fulfilled its commitments, which obliges the UN 
Security Council to lift the embargo clamped on Iraq in 
fulfillment of its reciprocal obligations. 
  Tariq 'Aziz commended Jordan's courageous stands in support 
of the Iraqi people, and urged parliamentarians as well as all 
organizations and well-intentioned people in the world to 
redouble their efforts to lift the unfair embargo clamped on the 
Iraqi people. 
  For his part, the deputy speaker of the Jordanian House of 
Representatives reiterated the Jordanian people's support for 
and solidarity with the fraternal Iraqis. He commended the 
Iraqis' steadfastness and firmness in their confrontation of the 
aggression and in their handling of the unfair embargo.

  [Text] Baghdad, 2 Apr (INA)--Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn 
Khudayyir has asserted that the UN Security Council is required 
to lift the embargo clamped on Iraq, particularly since Iraq has 
fulfilled all its commitments. 
  During a meeting today with Nicolas Rodriguez, under 
secretary at the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Relations, the prime 
minister added: Iraq has been done a flagrant and monstrous 
injustice as a result of the arbitrary anti-Iraq resolutions the 
UN Security Council passed under U.S. pressures. Nonetheless, 
Iraq has fully honored its commitments toward these resolutions 
to remove the pretexts and excuses the United States and Zionism 
are using to perpetuate the unfair embargo clamped on Iraq, and 
also to expose the aggressive and malicious intentions of the 
evil and aggressive powers. 
  The prime minister went on to say: Iraq's steadfastness and 
the firmness of its unique leadership, represented by his 
excellency the president, have thwarted the enemies' designs and 
exposed their positions even at the UN Security Council. This 
has been manifested in the emergence of new trends at the UN 
Security Council demanding that a new approach be used in 
handling the anti-Iraq embargo, particularly since Iraq has 
fully honored its commitments toward the relevant resolutions 
passed against it. 
  Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn Khudayyir also reviewed with the 
Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry official the impact of the 
treacherous 30-state aggression, as well as the reconstruction 
drive the Iraqis have been engaged in under His Excellency 
President Saddam Husayn. He noted that the Iraqis have rebuilt 
in record time the infrastructure destroyed by the evildoers. 
The Iraqis have viewed the reconstruction campaign as a 
counteroffensive, he added. 
  For his part, Nicolas Rodriguez said he hoped that friendly 
bilateral ties will be promoted. He added that his current 
visit to Iraq is aimed at holding consultations with Iraqi 
officials to achieve this objective.

  [Text] Baghdad, 2 Apr (INA)--Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 
'Aziz received here today Nicolas Rodriguez, under secretary of 
the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Relations. 
  During the meeting, the talks addressed the friendly 
bilateral ties and the means of promoting them despite the 
embargoes clamped on both Iraq and Cuba. 
  The talks also addressed the imperialist U.S. policy, which 
seeks to perpetuate the iniquitous embargo clamped on Iraq, 
although Iraq has fulfilled all its commitments. The two 
officials also discussed the wicked embargo the United States is 
imposing on Cuba and its people to achieve tendentious political 
purposes. 
  The two sides asserted that adherence to independence is the 
best weapon to be used in confronting embargoes and conspiracies. 
  The meeting was attended by the Foreign Ministry under 
secretary and the Cuban charge d'affaires in Baghdad.

<F P=106> [Report by Majid al-Lami, Nabil al-Wadi, and Hiyam Ahmad] </F>
  [Excerpts] Calls for lifting the unjust siege imposed on 
Iraq are intensifying on the official and popular levels. 
  These calls urge the Security Council, the United Nations, 
and humanitarian organizations to expedite serious action toward 
ending the siege since Iraq has responded to all Security 
Council resolutions. 
  Chinese Ambassador in Baghdad Zheng Dayong emphasized 
China's 
principled and firm position in support of Iraq and its 
continuous efforts aimed at lifting the siege imposed by the 
states of aggression. 
  At a meeting with Health Minister Dr. Umid Midhat, Zheng 
urged the international community to stop this tragedy that the 
Iraqi people are facing, which has increased fatalities among 
children, the elderly, and women as a result of scarcity of 
food, medicines, and basic human requirements. 
  He emphasized that the siege has entered a dangerous phase 
on 
which silence should not continue because this is a pure 
humanitarian subject. 
  The ambassador emphasized the importance of expediting the 
unfreezing of Iraqi assets abroad so that Iraq can buy medicines 
and food, and keep the ghost of death away from innocent 
children. [passage omitted] 
  Cuban Ambassador in Baghdad (Luis Mas Reyes) emphasized his 
country's firm position in rejecting the continuation of the 
siege imposed on the Iraqi people. 
  The Cuban ambassador conveyed the greetings of the Cuban 
parliament speaker to Sa'di Mahdi Salih, the National Assembly 
speaker, and his eagerness to foster friendly relations with 
Iraqi parliamentarians. 
  During his meeting with Dr. Anwar Qasirah, chairman of the 
Iraqi- Cuban Parliamentary Friendship Committee, the Cuban 
ambassador expressed his appreciation of the relations between 
the Iraqi National Assembly and the Cuban Parliament and the 
willingness to foster these relations and coordinate positions 
at regional and international parliamentary meetings.

  [Text] Nicosia, April 5 (AFP) -- Gunmen shot and seriously 
wounded a Danish UN guard in an ambush Tuesday [5 April] in 
Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, security officials in the area 
said. 
  The guard was shot in the chest as he was driving from 
al-Sulaymaniyah to Irbil, and later underwent an operation, said 
the sources contacted by telephone from Cyprus. They did not 
give any information about the assailants. 
  The attack came only two days after an AFP correspondent, 
German-born Lissy Schmidt, and her bodyguard were killed by 
unidentified gunmen in the al-Sulaymaniyah area close to the 
Iranian border. 
  Since the start of the year the UN has reported 13 attacks 
against foreigners in Iraqi Kurdistan, which have left one 
person dead and seven wounded. 
  One of the main Iraqi Kurdish groups, the Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan (PUK), said earlier in a statement from Damascus that 
Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's regime had "promised a reward of 
10,000 dollars to anyone killing a foreigner in Kurdistan." 
  Schmidt was the only foreign journalist permanently based in 
Iraqi Kurdistan, controlled by the Kurds since their uprising 
against the Baghdad regime following the January-February 1991 
Gulf War.

  [Text] Baghdad, 6 Apr (INA) -- An official spokesman in 
Baghdad said today the accusation made by U.S. State Department 
spokesman Mike McCurry yesterday --that the Iraqi Government is 
behind the killing of several foreigners in the Kurdistan region 
-- is an absurd accusation. It shows to what extent the U.S. 
State Department is deliberately seeking to mislead public 
opinion and not tell it the truth about the deteriorating 
security situation in that region. 
  The Iraqi spokesman said the Kurdistan region, which is 
under 
U.S. protection and control, is rife with thugs, armed men, and 
thieves. The people there do not dare go out at night or travel 
between cities and villages. Incidents of killing and robbery 
by highwaymen in Kurdistan occur almost daily. 
  The spokesman added that the newspapers run by the armed 
cliques in the Kurdistan region are full of complaints and 
criticism about the deteriorating security situation. The 
newspapers daily accuse the Kurdish authority of being unable to 
control its armed men and from time to time publish reports 
about armed robberies and holdups committed by those armed men. 
Sometimes, those armed groups fight over spoils. They also 
trade accusations in public about who is responsible for the 
deterioration of security in the region from the warlords in the 
region, Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani and other leaders of 
the armed cliques who were armed by the Americans. 
  The Iraqi spokesman added that the U.S. State Department's 
accusation of the Iraqi Government is clear disinformation and 
political deception. It is part of the U.S. blind hostility to 
Iraq.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "LIBERATION Banned in Tunisia"] </F>
  [Text] Once again LIBERATION has been banned in Tunisia for 
an indefinite period. Tunisia's Agency for External 
Communications (ATCE) formally notified us yesterday of this 
without further details. Explanations were to be found in the 
previous day's issue of the government-controlled daily LA 
PRESSE. Under the headline "Tunisia's Dignity and Its People's 
Honor Foremost," the paper attacked, without quoting it, an 
article by a Tunisian intellectual that was published in 
LIBERATION's "Rebounds" section on 23 March. The article's 
author, who lives in exile in France, was expressing his 
reaction to the reelection of head of state Zine el Abidine Ben 
Ali with 99.92 percent of the votes. Condemning the absence of 
"a democratization process" in his country, he gave his support 
to the former president of the Tunisian Human Rights League, 
Moncef Marzouki, who had not been allowed to run in the 
presidential election. 
  Contrary to LA PRESSE's allegations, the Tunisian Government 
did not use its right of reply in LIBERATION, but prompted 
instead a representative of a "Confederation of Tunisian 
Associations in France" to submit two texts. LIBERATION was 
unable to publish these texts due to the personal nature of 
their attacks as well as a total lack of sound arguments. We 
need not remind readers that the "Rebounds" section is an 
opinion column reserved for outside contributors. In any case, 
our Tunisian readers were denied any opportunity to read the 
offending article, as LIBERATION was not made available in 
Tunisia that day, as is the case every time the paper deals with 
that country's political situation. 
  The ban on LIBERATION is but the latest in a long series of 
measures against foreign media. The BBC correspondent for 
Tunisia was expelled in mid-February, and the offices of Kuwaiti 
agency KUNA were closed down temporarily. [French] newspapers 
LE MONDE and LE MONDE DIPLOMATIQUE as well as British daily THE 
GUARDIAN were banned in turn. Last week, the Tunisian 
authorities turned back the lawyer of "Reporters Without 
Frontiers, an international organization working to preserve the 
freedom of the press. As to Moncef Marzouki, whose candidacy 
had caused an uproar in Tunisia, he is currently in jail.

Hamas said that the name of the suicide terrorist is Ra'id 
Zakarnah, 19, of Qabatiyah. 
  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that a short while ago, 
the security forces arrived in Qabatiyah, and took Zakarnah's

  [Text] This morning's terrorist attack at the Ashdod 
Junction was perpetrated by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
member 'Ali 'Abdallah, a 21-year-old resident of the al-Shati' 
refugee camp. 
  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that a leaflet signed by 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the military arm of Hamas, was 
distributed in the Gaza Strip today. The leaflet stated that 
yesterday's terrorist attack in 'Afula was carried out by a

  [Text] Jerusalem, April 7 (AFP) -- The Islamic Resistance 
Movement Hamas warned Thursday [7 April] it will soon fire 
rockets at Israeli homes and urged Palestinians to stock up with 
food for war. 
  The threat in a communique distributed in the occupied 
territories came a day after a suicide bomber from the Hamas 
armed wing 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam killed seven Israelis and 
wounded 45 at 'Afula. 
  That was just the first of five major attacks to come on 
Israeli targets in revenge for the Hebron mosque massacre of 30 
Moslems by a Jewish settlers on February 25, Hamas said. 
  "We are calling on settlers to evacuate now so no one will 
be 
able to accuse us of killing civilians," the communique said. 
  "Our al-Qassam units will shell their homes with rockets 
that 
we have received recently. Everyone knows we keep our word. 
  Hamas called on "shopkeepers and the people to stock up with 
foodstuffs because an atmosphere of war will prevail in the near 
future." 
  The statement also urged PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat to halt 
negotiations with Israel for one year. 
  "Our units will force Israeli leaders to evacuate their 
soldiers and settlers from Gaza, Jericho and Hebron without any 
conditions as a first step to liberating the whole of the West 
Bank and strip," Hamas said. 
  "We will guarantee Arafat's position as president if he 
agrees. 
  The communique noted that 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam waited until 
the traditional Moslem day of mourning 40 days after the Hebron 
slaughter to carry out the bombing in 'Afula, northern Israel. 
  A Palestinian gunman shot five soldiers at a bus stop in 
Israel on Thursday before being killed himself and two Arab 
workers stabbed and badly wounded a Jewish settler on the Gaza 
Strip, the authorities said.

<F P=106> [Report by Gay Bekhor, 'Amira Hess, and news agencies] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, head of 
Fatah in the Gaza Strip, expressed his sorrow yesterday over the 
attack in 'Afula. "We regret the death of every innocent 
person, be he a Jew, a Christian, or a Muslim. We hope such 
deeds will stop as soon as the peace process succeeds." 
  [HA'ARETZ] Do you not consider it an attempt on the part of 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] to sabotage the peace 
process? Hamas has claimed responsibility for the attack. 
  [Al-Agha] We heard about it on Israel Radio, but I do not 
know exactly who perpetrated the deed or is responsible for it. 
After all, it was also reported that the Islamic Jihad claimed 
responsibility for it. Anybody can claim responsibility. 
  [HA'ARETZ] Was it not a message to Fatah by the opponents of 
the agreement with Israel? 
  [Al-Agha] Our objections and denunciations notwithstanding, 
the attack came in the wake of the Hebron massacre and was to be 
expected. When people start feeling a change in the field, 
there will be no such deeds. 
  [HA'ARETZ] But this will have no effect on people who object 
to such actions. 
  [Al-Agha] Any such attack, be it in Hebron or in 'Afula, is 
meant to harm the peace process. There are opponents on both 
sides. Support for the agreement will grow, however, and the 
opponents will be pushed to the sidelines when results are 
evident. 
  Attorney Furayh Abu-Middayn, formerly a member of the 
Palestinian delegation to the Madrid and Washington talks, also 
does not consider the attack a direct message against Fatah and 
the path it has chosen. "It was to be expected. The Hebron 
massacre was a turning point, and the attack yesterday was an 
act of revenge. Reports that thousands of Israelis consider 
Barukh Goldstein a hero increased the pain." 
  The negotiating process, Abu-Middayn said, has brought the 
Palestinians prolonged humiliation and has led them to the 
realization that it is not a fair agreement. "This is the time 
for talks about a permanent arrangement based on UN Resolutions 
242 and 338, which recognize the national rights of the 
Palestinians, if they want to prevent what happened in 'Afula 
and what will happen tomorrow elsewhere." 
  Abu-Middayn added that the Americans and the French were 
driven out of Lebanon in the same way. "Admittedly, the attack 
did not take place in the occupied territories, but Israel 
should expect the unexpectable," he said. 
  [Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew on 7 April carries a 
report 
by Pe'erli Shahar on page 4, adding that Jad Ishaq, the PLO 
representative to the multilateral talks on the environment 
currently being held in The Hague, last night "expressed his 
regret over the terrorist incident in 'Afula and the loss of 
human life in tragic events in the region."]

  [Text] Ramallah -- Dr. George Habash, secretary general of 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], 
stressed that the Palestinian national struggle entered a new 
political phase after the signing of the Gaza-Jericho accord. 
The most prominent feature of this phase is the diversion of 
part of the Palestinian bourgeoisie from the national program. 
  In an exclusive interview with AL-QUDS, Dr. Habash added: We 
are preparing ourselves and are working on the basis of a 
program of comprehensive opposition to the Madrid-Oslo program 
and its numerous and Islamic parties without ignoring the 
international link, be they international institutions or 
progressive organizations, parties, and forces supportive of our 
rights and struggle. 
  Dr. Habash affirmed that the future struggle will consist of 
two parts: First, continuing the struggle in all forms and with 
all available means. Second, opposing the accord and its 
implementation on the ground with the aim of foiling it. 
  Dr. Habash expects the accord to be implemented on the 
ground 
because of the international, Arab, and local support for it. 
He added: However, this accord greatly contradicts our 
people's aspirations, such as on the issue of settlements and 
Jerusalem, in addition to the ongoing Israeli practices. All 
these factors promote popular opposition, which means that the 
accord will fail in the future. 
  Dr. Habash emphasized that his opposition to the self-rule 
authority will be based on political, popular, and social 
struggle and all possible democratic forms. 
  On whether Arab states, especially Syria, were exerting 
pressure on the 10 factions, Habash said: The current situation 
of the official Arab system and the state of total collapse that 
it has reached, particularly following the second Gulf war, 
constitutes by itself the greatest pressure on us -- as 
rejectionist forces -- to be incorporated into the U.S. orbit. 
This situation, however, does not preclude the existence of 
Arab regimes that reject or oppose the U.S. concept of peace 
despite their limited role and effect. 
  Habash affirmed: Despite differences in views and positions, 
Syria is not exerting any pressure on us. On the contrary, it 
is showing understanding for these positions, which stem from 
the nature and dangers of this accord. 
  Dr. Habash said: For more than a year now the PLO leadership 
has stopped paying the PFLP its allocations from the Palestine 
National Fund. The cause for this is not the financial crisis. 
It preceded the crisis. By doing so, it is using the same 
weapon which Arab and Western countries are using against it. 
  Dr. Habash added: Nationalist allies in Arab regimes provide 
us with periodic aid, which is very modest and does not meet the 
requirements of the struggle.

  [Text] Security Council's speedy action in condemning the 
martyrdom-seeking attack by a Palestinian youth in the town of 
'Afula in northern Palestine yesterday has caused the reactions 
of Palestinian party and organization leaders. Dr. Fathi 
Shaqaqi, general secretary of the Islamic Jihad in Palestine 
spoke to our colleague in Beirut few hours ago: 
  [Begin Shaqaqi recording, in Arabic with superimposed 
Persian 
translation] The stance taken by the UN general secretary and 
the head of the Security Council in condemnation of the 
martyrdom-seeking operation in 'Afula practically proves that 
the UN and the Security Council are controlled by U.S. policy. 
It took the Security Council three weeks of negotiations and 
great doubt to issue a resolution in condemnation of the Zionist 
regime in the al-Khalil massacre. But only several hours after 
the martyrdom-seeking operations in 'Afula, which was carried 
out in revenge for the al-Khalil killing, the Security Council 
and the UN general secretary speedily condemned the operations. 
This indicates the height of conformity of the UN and the 
Security Council to U.S. policies. 
  Yesterday's martyrdom-seeking operations against the 
Zionists 
is a legitimate right of the Palestinians because according to 
international law, residents of occupied lands have the right to 
operate against the occupiers. [end recording] 
  Dr. Shaqaqi referred to the signed agreement between PLO and 
the Zionist regime and said: 
  [Begin Shaqaqi recording] Such an agreement will not lead to 
peace. On the contrary it will further inflame war because this 
agreement will legitimize the Zionist occupation and the 
Palestinian people will fight this design in whatever form they 
can. The continuation of anti-Zionist operations in occupied 
Palestine is in fact an indication of people's opposition to 
deals with the occupiers. [end recording]

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Apr (MENA)--Hebron Mayor Mustafa al-Natshah 
arrived in Cairo from Israel today on a four-day visit. 
  Upon his arrival, al-Natshah said the aim of his visit was 
to 
meet President Yasir 'Arafat to brief him on the situation in 
Hebron and to listen to his instructions for easing the 
suffering of the Hebron inhabitants, who were under curfew for 
30 days after which the city center was closed on the pretext of 
protecting Jewish families. 
  Al-Natshah explained that this closure inconvenienced 
120,000 
Palestinians. He said he would ask 'Arafat to explain this 
tragedy to President Mubarak so that he could try to help in 
this direction.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Abdallah al-Franji, PLO </F>
representative in Bonn, by Vera Szoelloesi; place not given -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Szoelloesi] I now welcome 'Abdallah al-Franji, 
PLO representative in Germany, on the telephone. Good morning. 
  [Al-Franji] Good morning. 
  [Szoelloesi] Mr. Al-Franji, have Israel and the PLO overcome 
the greatest obstacle to the Gaza-Jericho agreement? Can you 
tell us when Rabin and 'Arafat will sign it? 
  [Al-Franji] I think that there is no other possibility than 
to sign it soon because this state of affairs, that is, the 
present state of affairs, will result in major tensions and 
certain actions here and there that might stop this peace 
process. Therefore, it is time for both sides, that is, us, the 
PLO, and Israel, to sign it soon. That is to say, I expect that 
we will be through with everything before 13 April. 
  [Szoelloesi] That is to say, even before 13 April? 
  [Al-Franji] This is my hope and my estimate. I hope that I 
will be right. 
  [Szoelloesi] Yesterday it was said -- the number of 
Palestinian policemen who might be deployed was controversial -- 
that 9,000 policemen for Gaza and Jericho were agreed upon. Can 
you confirm this figure? 
  [Al-Franji] I think this figure is correct. I think that 
the number of policemen that the Israelis have accepted is about 
8,500 to 9,000. We need so many policemen now in the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho because we can only have this situation under 
control with a strong police troop and because security will 
only be guaranteed for all people living there if we see to it. 
There is a vacuum and certain problems that have developed in 
these days. One can only have this under control if one is 
prepared for it. 
  [Szoelloesi] You are saying that a strong police would be 
needed in these days, which indicates that the PLO is aware that 
there are also many radical forces on the Palestinians' side and 
the whole of the society has also got used to something like 
violence. What will happen if a Palestinian police take action 
against Palestinians? 
  [Al-Franji] We are planning to refrain from violence against 
our people. This would be the most stupid thing that we could 
do. We simply have to lead the Palestinian society into a 
democratic process, so that the Palestinians can somehow cope 
with a dialogue between themselves alone. If we use force 
against each other, this will mean that we have peace with the 
Israelis, while, on the other hand, we have a situation of 
violence with the Palestinians. This is not the objective of 
the Palestinians and the PLO. We would like to develop a 
democratic society, but, on the other hand, order also has to be 
established in these days. It is not easy to establish order in 
a people who have lived under an occupation regime for, let us 
say, 27 years. 
  [Szoelloesi] But is your answer not also wishful thinking? 
I mean that this is a long-term objective. All agree on it. 
However, in the beginning the society will be as it is and the 
people will be as they are. The police will be confronted with 
the question of how to establish order. 
  [Al-Franji] Well, I think -- first of all, this is not 
wishful thinking -- that the Palestinians among themselves have 
been very tolerant so far. The Palestinians outside have 
practiced democracy for many years, for 30 years. The 
Palestinians in the occupied territories will not regard the PLO 
and the Palestinian policemen there as occupation forces. 
Therefore, there is a great difference between Palestinian 
policemen and the Israeli Army units. The Palestinians who live 
there are waiting for their freedom. Therefore, only minorities 
will carry out violent actions. This is the reason we have to 
see to it that such violent acts cannot be repeated and that 
they are not so frequent. However, the Palestinian people will 
welcome it and you will see that the Palestinians will be very 
enthusiastic when the Israeli Army leaves and, second, when the 
PLO comes. 
  [Szoelloesi] For a similar reason, that is, in order to 
prevent a split of the Palestinian people, the PLO also insists 
that Israel should not only release PLO adherents who are in 
Israeli prisons, but also Hamas adherents. How far have the 
negotiations progressed in this respect? 
  [Al-Franji] First of all, this is a very clever attitude of 
the PLO, so that the Palestinian society is not divided. 
Second, I think that the Israelis will also have to understand 
that they cannot achieve peace with the Palestinians if they 
distinguish between them -- that is, these Palestinians are 
good, those Palestinians are not good. Hamas has lived in a 
state of war with Israel for 5 or 6 years, since the 
establishment of this organization. The PLO has also lived in a 
state of war with the Israelis for 30 years. If they strive for 
peace now, they have to win all Palestinians for this peace. 
Therefore, it is very clever if the Israelis accept the 
Palestinians' position and also release the imprisoned Hamas 
members. 
  [Szoelloesi] What will happen if Israel does not do this? 
  [Al-Franji] I hope that they will do it. What will happen? 
This will, of course, be negative. It will also have a negative 
influence on the future development. We would simply like to 
have a certain harmony between all Palestinian groups when we 
come. When we say that we are striving for a democratic 
Palestinian society, we mean it and we also do not want to 
interfere in the Israelis' affairs. The Israelis also have to 
learn that, according to the treaty that we signed, the 
Palestinians are a partner with equal rights. That is to say, 
we, not the Israelis, are responsible for us and for our society. 
  [Szoelloesi] Why has the PLO not yet dispatched a vanguard 
of Palestinian policemen to the Gaza Strip and Jericho? After 
all, the Israelis have prepared their withdrawal and are now 
really beginning to withdraw. Would it not be time now to send 
someone there as early as now and not to wait any longer? The 
dispatch was again postponed to Thursday, as I believe. 
  [Al-Franji] Well, I think that one point is also that the 
Israelis accepted 100 people. This number is not sufficient 
because here and there, on the Palestinians' side, but also on 
the Israelis' side, the people who want to disturb this process 
might take action against these 100 people, who are not armed. 
If they simply go there without protection -- a pistol is not a 
weapon -- another action might take place. This would expose 
the Palestinian authority to ridicule. We do not want this. 
When we get there, we want this troop to be able to defend 
itself at least against anybody who plans to disturb this peace 
process. Therefore, we are trying to convince the Israelis that 
they should not insist on these small matters. I hope that they 
will accept it. Some Israelis, above all the Israeli Army, are 
not yet used to treating the Palestinians as partners with equal 
rights. 
  [Szoelloesi] Thank you very much, Mr. 'Abdallah al-Franji, 
PLO representative in Germany.

director of political affairs in the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, has said. 
  Ibrahim disclosed this when he addressed a political forum

  He accused a rebel leader, John Garang, of fearing peace in

  [Text] Khartoum, 7 Apr (MENA)--Sudan's President Lieutenant 
General 'Umar al-Bashir has declared that the security agencies 
have seized dangerous documents from Mahjub 'Urwah, proprietor 
and chief editor of the AL-SUDAN AL-DUWALI newspaper, as he was 
returning from a foreign trip. In a statement published in the 
official newspaper AL-SUDAN AL-HADITH today, he said that these 
documents revealed the suspicious link between the owner of the 
newspaper and foreign intelligence circles hostile to Sudan. 
  Lt. Gen. al-Bashir pointed out that the competent agencies 
immediately began to examine the contents of the seized 
documents -- contacts and correspondences with these foreign 
circles. He noted that these documents will be made known to 
the public through the various media organs. He said the 
information in these documents reveals the schemes and goals of 
the newspaper, which are hostile to Sudan and designed to 
destabilize the country. 
  The Presidential Office in Sudan released a statement on 
Sunday, according to which the AL-SUDAN AL-DUWALI newspaper 
published in Khartoum was closed. The statement noted that the 
paper's writers will be interrogated about their reports on 
corruption, bribery, nepotism, armed robberies, and price rises, 
which are considered to be an attempt to strike at the 
revolution and fragment the domestic front.

  [Text] Khartoum, 29 Mar (INA)--Ibrahim Ahmad 'Umar, 
Sudanese minister of education and scientific research, has 
saluted the Iraqi people's militant stand and high resolve under 
the leadership of President Saddam Husayn in confronting the 
forces of evil and aggression. 
  During a meeting with Dr. Humam 'Abd-al-Khaliq, Iraqi higher 
education and scientific research minister, here today, 'Umar 
added that both the aggression on Iraq and the continued 
blockade on its people are aimed at stopping scientific, 
technical, and military progress and obstructing Iraq's 
effective role in defending the Arab nation's interests. 
  'Umar reaffirmed that the Sudanese people stand alongside 
the 
Iraqi people in confronting and foiling the aggressive schemes 
and conspiracies concocted by the imperialist, colonialist, and 
Zionist circles. 
  The Iraqi minister appreciated the positions of Sudan's 
leadership and people alongside Iraq in the battle it is waging 
against the imperialist-Zionist conspiracy. He asserted that 
the Iraqi people will not forget this stand despite the 
pressures and threats that Sudan is facing, which have not 
dissuaded Sudan from its genuine pan-Arab positions. 
  The two ministers discussed issues of joint cooperation in 
the field of higher education and scientific research in 
accordance with both the cultural agreement signed in 1974 and 
the subsequent executive programs. Talks also dealt with the 
possibility of reviewing the agreements signed between the Iraqi 
and Sudanese universities.

<F P=106> [By Maher Chmaytelli] </F>
  [Text] Cairo, April 6 (AFP) -- Israel is holding back on a 
date for its withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho to pressure the 
Palestinians into giving up their demands, the PLO complained 
here Wednesday [6 April]. 
  A PLO negotiator, asking not to be named, said Israel aimed 
to win concessions from the Palestinians on key issues such as 
water-sharing rights for Jewish settlers in the future 
autonomous areas. 
  The date for the Israeli army's withdrawal from the Gaza 
Strip and West Bank town of Jericho is being used as a weapon to 
secure Palestinian concessions on several other points, he said. 
  The Israelis also wanted veto rights over legal matters so 
they could overrule decisions taken by Palestinian courts. 
  On archaeology, another of the issues under discussion since 
a new round of autonomy negotiations opened in the Egyptian 
capital on Sunday, Israel demanded excavation rights. 
  The negotiator said Israel was calculating that the PLO had 
more to lose from a delay in an army withdrawal, which was 
originally due to start on December 13 and be completed by April 
13. 
  When the two sides failed to meet the December target set by 
the Declaration of Principles they signed in Washington on 
September 13, opponents of peace such as the Islamic Resistance 
Movement (Hamas) gained ground, he noted. 
  To ease the pressure of time and win room for manoeuvre, the 
Palestine Liberation Organisation has asked for an Israeli 
commitment to pull out between April 13 and May 1, he said. 
  "Once one commits himself to a date, he really goes about to 
do everything to respect it," chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th 
said on Tuesday. 
  But his Israeli counterpart General Amnon Shahaq remained 
non-committal and stressed that the emphasis was on signing a 
final package for the launch of autonomy. 
  "What is important is to have the agreement signed and it 
will be signed when all discussions will be finished here. I 
can not say when," he said. "We will continue next week and I 
hope it will be finished soon." 
  The latest round, following a five-week break because of the 
Hebron mosque massacre, was to wind up on Wednesday because of 
Israel's commemoration of the Holocaust the next day and to 
reopen on Sunday. 
  On the ground, 26 Palestinians who were exiled by Israel 
returned to the West Bank on Tuesday to bolster preparations for 
self-rule. Another 23 Palestinian exiles returned home to a 
hero's welcome on the Gaza Strip. 
  Meanwhile in Cairo, both sides were still divided over the 
release of Palestinian prisoners. Sha'th complained that Israel 
was refusing to free members of groups hostile to the peace 
process, including Hamas. 
  Talks on deploying a Palestinian police force focused on 
several issues, including the size of the force, a factor which 
appears to have been resolved in contrast to the other 
difficulties. 
  The force will be 9,000 strong, a compromise between the 
10,000 demanded by the PLO and the original Israeli offer of 
6,000, according to Sha'th. 
  Akram Haniyah, a close aide to 'Arafat, said in an Israeli 
newspaper interview from PLO headquarters in Tunis that Arafat 
should arrive in Jericho during the first week of May. 
  "I think 'Arafat and the political leadership of the PLO 
will 
arrive in Jericho during the first week of the month of May," he 
told HA'ARETZ. 
  However the aide added a note of caution with an eye on the 
talks: "The situation is still fluid. Everything depends on the 
outcome of the negotiations underway in Cairo." 
  'Arafat himself on Wednesday left Amman after talks with 
King 
Husayn to travel to the Egyptian capital where he was to guide 
his negotiators on the last day of talks. 
  Israel and the PLO were also to meet in Paris the same day 
to 
discuss economic issues.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F>
delegation, by Sha'ul Menashe in Cairo; date not given; from the 
"With the Midday Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Menashe] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, what is the current 
status of the negotiations? 
  [Sha'th] We are in the final days before the signing of an 
agreement and before the beginning of the withdrawal and entry 
of the Palestinian police force. In these final days, there is 
much and continuous work that should be done by all committees, 
and we are working seriously on this. We are aware that in 
these final days we should complete the work so that 
implementation can begin. In fact, implementation has actually 
begun. A withdrawal has begun and this is clear to all our 
people everywhere. Deportees are returning to shoulder specific 
responsibilities within the upcoming Palestinian administration. 
Preparations are being made for the entry of the vanguards of 
the Palestinian police. God willing, we will complete 
preparations for implementing this agreement as soon as possible. 
  [Menashe] Final question. Do you believe that the deployment 
of the Palestinian forces in the first stage should guarantee 
security for the Palestinian people in the territories after the 
departure of the Israeli forces? 
  [Sha'th] Undoubtedly. First, the Palestinian forces will 
enter before the withdrawal of the Israeli forces. The Israeli 
forces will then withdraw, and the Palestinian forces will 
become fully responsible for security. 
  [Menashe] When will the Palestinian forces be armed? 
  [Sha'th] The Palestinian forces will be armed upon their 
entry, but their security responsibility will begin when the 
Israeli forces withdraw. 
  [Menashe] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you very much.

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Apr (MENA)--Chief Palestinian negotiator 
Nabil Sha'th has said that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations 
are facing difficulties "but we are seeking a solution to them." 
  In a statement today, Sha'th said the Palestinian forces are 
not ready to enter Gaza and Jericho. He said they will first 
come to Egypt from several Arab countries. 
  The Palestinian official called on the donor states to meet 
their obligations now, not after the signing of the agreement. 
He said the Palestinians need cash to finance arrangements for 
the entry of the Palestinian police into Gaza and Jericho. 
  Sha'th said Norway is the only country to pay for the 
Palestinian police. It has paid $2 million. The other donor 
countries have not met their obligations, he said. 
  Sha'th said the water issue will be discussed at the 
Civilian 
Affairs Committee in the next round of negotiations. 
  Nasr Yusuf, a PLO military commander, has stated that the 
vanguards of the Palestinian police force, who were scheduled to 
enter Gaza and Jericho, will not now go there due to problems 
facing the negotiations. 
  He said there has been no agreement on the final size of the 
police force or the timetable for its entry into the self-rule 
areas. 
  Yusuf said the Israelis are linking agreement on the start 
of 
the negotiations with the signing of an agreement on the 
implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles [sentence as received]. 
  The Palestinian official denied that the two sides agreed 
that the Palestinian police force should consist of 9,000 men. 
  In a related development, MENA has learned that difficulties 
appearing at the last minute prevented Israeli officers from 
handing over Israeli police barracks to PLO representatives in 
Gaza.

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the negotiations with the Israelis on 
the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, has said that 
President 'Arafat reviewed the negotiations during his meeting 
with President Husni Mubarak this afternoon. 
  He said the Palestinians welcome any help to resolve the 
pending issues so that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles can be implemented on schedule on 12 April. 
  Sha'th told journalists following the latest round of 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations that President 'Arafat also 
discussed the results of the negotiations during his meeting 
with Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana. Egyptian Foreign 
Minister 'Amr Musa was also briefed on the results, he added. 
  Sha'th said: We did not achieve the progress we expected to 
achieve to sign the final agreement on schedule on 12 April. 
  He accused the Israeli delegation of obstructing the 
negotiations. Noting that the Israeli delegation left the 
negotiations at this time for a long recess (three and a half 
days) without finalizing the issues under discussion, Sha'th 
said: It is difficult to blame us for this; the Israelis are 
entirely to blame. 
  Sha'th said the Israeli delegation promised to continue the 
negotiations by fax and telephone. We are waiting to see if 
this will solve the remaining problems, he said. 
  He stressed that this depends largely on the intentions of 
the Israelis and their readiness to end the negotiations on 
time. If this is the case, he said, a practical result can be 
reached on Sunday or Monday. 
  Sha'th went on to say: We are working and are ready to work 
every minute of the remaining five and a half days before 
Tuesday 12 April. I firmly believe that if the Israelis have 
good intentions there is enough time to reaching an agreement. 
  The Palestinian official explained that the economic talks 
in 
Paris will continue tomorrow and the day after. Had these 
negotiations [in Cairo] been given a similar chance, he said, 
they would have been completed on time. 
  Sha'th said the Israeli delegation's ending the negotiations 
ahead of schedule on the pretext of marking the holocaust (the 
burning of Jews by the Nazis during World War II) means the 
Israelis have obstructed the negotiations in some way. 
  We could celebrate the intifadah or any other dear national 
Palestinian occasion by observing a silence or by breaking up 
the negotiations for an hour, he said. Ending the negotiations 
before their time in this way, he added, is an obstruction. 
  Sha'th stressed that the Palestinians still insist on the 
specified date for the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, that is, 13 April. He said this date is extremely 
important and must not be overlooked. There is enough time to 
achieve this, he said. 
  Sha'th added: The Israelis know full well what we want and 
what is required. I do not believe it is impossible to achieve 
what is required. 
  He said he tried to persuade the Israeli delegation to stay 
to complete the negotiations but the delegation insisted on 
leaving.

<F P=106> [Commentary by 'Atif 'Umar: "Egypt Is an Important Center </F>
in the Arab-Israeli Peace Process"] 
  [Excerpts] In their summit meeting in Cairo over the past 
two days, Presidents Husni Mubarak and Hafiz al-Asad discussed 
several important issues, including the Middle East, Arab 
coordination, and efforts to contain differences and clear the 
air in the Arab capitals. The meeting highlighted that Cairo 
will remain a center, a forum, for all Arab leaders to discuss 
their issues and coordinate and plan for the region's peoples 
and their ambitions to solve their problems fairly and honorably. 
  The summit followed a new development in the Arab region due 
to the latest Hebron massacre and its new threats to the peace 
process, which was about to make some progress on the road to 
Arab-Israeli reconciliation. The massacre came to undermine the 
peace process and had it not been for the self-restraint 
demonstrated by the Arab region, most notably the PLO, the whole 
region would have seen a retreat on the course of peace through 
negotiations. [passage omitted] 
  The summit talks in Cairo showed that Syria is eager for a 
comprehensive peace in the region based on Security Council 
resolutions and international legitimacy, which rejects 
aggression and does not allow the occupation of others' 
territory by force. In a statement after seeing off Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad, President Mubarak said he hoped Syria 
and Israel would reach an agreement. The statement emphasized 
the Syrian leadership's earnest desire to end the Arab-Israeli 
conflict and create stability and peace for the region on fair 
bases. 
  As President Mubarak explained in his answer to a question 
from an Israeli correspondent, peace requires sacrifices by both 
sides, particularly the party that occupies the land. This 
party has major capabilities that give it the chance to make 
peace with the other parties and to achieve historic 
reconciliation that would reflect positively on all the region's 
peoples. The sides are fed up with conflicts and their dangers 
for both sides. History proves that things cannot remain as 
they are and that no one entity can remain stronger than the 
others forever, whatever his capabilities. 
  President Mubarak's continuing call on the need for the 
parties to be flexible about peace demonstrates that the 
Egyptian leadership is eager to maintain the momentum of the 
peace process and spare the Middle East the scourge of bloody 
conflicts. No one can deny the threat of these conflicts to all 
the peoples of the region.

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Apr (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
stated during their 90-minute meeting today that Presidents 
Husni Mubarak and Yasir 'Arafat discussed the Middle East peace 
process, especially the Palestinian-Israeli track. 
  In a statement after the meeting Musa said: Things are 
moving slowly; we hope progress will be achieved in the next few 
days. 
  Musa explained that the slow pace is a result of some of the 
demands and the insistence on some points. The two sides, the 
Israelis and the Palestinians, are having difficulty agreeing on 
those things, he said. 
  The foreign minister stressed that Egypt is ready to assist 
the two sides and do its best. We are closely watching the 
talks, he said. 
  On today's explosion in an Israeli vehicle, where some 
people 
were killed, Musa said these incidents further complicate the 
current situation. He expressed the hope that all these things 
will be solved through negotiations and the signing of an 
agreement between the two sides. 
  Musa hopes the Palestinians and the Israelis will sign the 
agreement before 13 April. 
  Answering a question, the foreign minister stressed that the 
Palestinians are well organized, their positions on the disputed 
points are very clear, and they are ready to go forward and sign 
the agreement on 12 April if possible. 
  Asked what he thinks of the entry of Palestinian police [to 
Gaza and Jericho] before the signing of the agreement, Musa 
said: If there is an agreement and an understanding between the 
parties, then why not? 
  The foreign minister stressed the importance of continuous 
the negotiations, not breaking them off today and then resuming 
them tomorrow. He said the Israeli delegation must continue the 
negotiations. Its departure today, even if for specific 
reasons, is a kind of postponement. 
  Musa said he believes the negotiations should be given 
precedence over any other commitments.

  [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa met Palestinian president 
Yasir 'Arafat this evening. Members of the delegation 
accompanying the Palestinian president attended. They discussed 
developments in the Palestinian issue and continued discussing 
topics that the Palestinian president reviewed today with 
President Mubarak. 
  Musa said afterward that he held contacts with Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres today on the Palestinian-Israeli 
peace talks and added that he hopes the talks will continue. He 
expressed his hope that the car bomb in Israel today will not 
affect the negotiations, because the peace process is important 
and fundamental. He said the peace process can put an end to 
violence and that the launch of a Palestinian entity, 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho Accord, and a move toward 
implementing the timetable will all pacify the situation. He 
noted that what is required is a fast and sincere implementation 
of the provisions of the Declaration of Principles. 
  Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat said his talks with 
President Husni Mubarak and Musa today were important, positive, 
and constructive and would contribute greatly to advancing the 
peace process. He added that regrettably, the Palestinian side 
has seen no real gestures from the Israeli side for a precise, 
sincere, and swift implementation of what was agreed upon 
recently. 
  [In two related Cairo-datelined reports, at 1835 GMT and 
1845 
GMT respectively on 6 April, Cairo MENA in Arabic adds the 
following: "Musa ruled out the possibility of visiting Israel 
right now." 
  ["'Arafat refused to answer a question on the explosion in 
Israel today."]

  [Text] In its meeting Thursday, the General Secretariat of 
the Nasirite Arab Democratic Party [NADP] decided to hold the 
party's second General Congress on 28 and 29 April. 
  In his political report to the General Secretariat meeting, 
NADP Secretary General Diya'-al-Din Dawud said that with the 
deteriorating situation in the country, the call for national 
dialogue has lost its credibility. He noted that violence is 
constantly increasing and there are more than 25,000 detainees 
in prisons. Nevertheless, he said, the government is repeating 
its claims about security and stability, imagining that it is in 
full control, refusing to listen to the views of the opposition, 
and believing that the security solution is enough to confront 
violence. 
  The secretary general said that government decisions are 
being determined by the policies and dictates of foreign 
quarters, like the World Bank and the United States. He noted 
the feeble government position on GATT and the government's 
promotion of the Middle East market from a position of impotence 
and capitulation. 
  Dawud saluted the valiant Palestinian intifadah and NADP 
youths and leaders at universities and in all positions for 
rising up to entrench the concept of pan-Arabism, defend the 
firm Arab right to Palestine, and confront the continuing 
Zionist massacres against our Arab people. He stressed that the 
Nasirite voice in our people's anger in the wake of the 
al-Ibrahhimi Mosque massacre was the loudest, strongest, and the 
best. 
  Meanwhile, the NADP has issued a statement to the nation on 
U.S. President Bill Clinton's description of Jerusalem as 
Israel's unified capital. The statement said the American 
remarks are a natural result of the humiliating agreement known 
as Gaza-Jericho and the full surrender to the Zionist enemy's 
designs.

  [Text] Luxor, 6 Apr (MENA)--The hijacked Sudanese airliner 
took off from Luxor Airport at 1600 today bound for Sudan. 
  The airliner was hijacked this morning on a domestic flight 
from Khartoum to al-Danaqilah. The Egyptian authorities and 
Armed Forces supplied the plane with fuel before it took off and 
provided food and medical care to its passengers. 
  The passengers appreciated the good hospitality they 
received 
from the Armed Forces and Egyptian officials and said it was 
nothing unusual from the fraternal and generous Egyptian people. 
  The captain of the Sudanese airliner said he would head 
first 
for al-Danaqilah and then proceed to Khartoum, adding that all 
the passengers are well. 
  A Sudanese official earlier announced that the Sudanese 
airliner left Luxor Airport two hours before it actually took 
off.

  [Text] Khartoum, 7 Apr (MENA)--Sudanese newspapers today 
published conflicting reports on the Sudanese airliner that a 
Sudanese national hijacked yesterday, Wednesday, and forced to 
land at Luxor airport. 
  While AL-SUDAN AL-HADITH said the plane was bound for 
al-Danaqilah and then Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, AL-INQADH AL-WATANI 
said the plane was on a domestic flight. 
  AL-INQADH revealed that the hijacker Mahjub Husayn Muhammad, 
who requested asylum in Egypt, was registered on the flight as a 
passenger under a false name. He revealed his real name to the 
Egyptian authorities, the paper said, adding that the person who 
carried out the operation is called 'Adil Mahjub Muhammad Ahmad. 
  The paper explained that domestic flights are not subject to 
the same passenger-list checks that international flights 
usually undergo. 
  Meanwhile, all Sudanese media as well as statements made by 
the Sudanese information and media minister and Sudan airways 
totally disregarded the presence of Sudanese ministers on the 
plane that returned to Khartoum last night; the hijacked plane 
was carrying two ministers: Education Minister Ahmad Muhammad 
Kapuche and Agriculture Minister Yusuf Adam [names and titles as 
received].

  [Text] The Arab Maghreb Union [AMU] has proved through its 
recent summit in Tunis its maturity at all levels of 
responsibility. This is what the Foreign Affairs Minister 
Mohamed Salah Dembri said in an exclusive statement to EL MASSA 
newspaper following the sixth summit of the AMU states. 
  Mr. Dembri said that political will has been mostly 
premature, noting that realism meant that world transformations 
should be taken into account and that these transformations will 
not allow for any individual adventure from now on. He added 
that it was imperative that we organize ourselves as an integral 
entity and hold dialogue with the others in order to become a 
partner either in the North- South direction, or within the 
framework of the Mediterranean states, or within Arab unity, or 
in the South-South direction. 
  The minister for foreign affairs spoke about the 
Algerian-Syrian call for the holding of a meeting of Arab 
Mediterranean states. He said that the call aimed at stressing 
the need for starting consultations between these countries so 
that we could agree at least on what to be said in the 
Mediterranean forum.

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 29 March 
issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Cairo Mosque To Turn Into Islamic Center 
  2. Editorial on Terrorist `Deceptions' 
  3. Seminar Urges Students To Avoid Extremist Ideas 
  4. Weakness of Islam Analyzed 
  5. Former Soviet Union Muslims Study in al-Azhar 
  6. Columnist on Terrorism and Image of Islam 
<H5>  CAIRO MOSQUE TO TURN INTO ISLAMIC CENTER </H5>
  A 70-word report by Muhammad al-Abnudi on page 1 says that 
Awqaf Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub has announced that the 
'Amr-Bin- al-'As Mosque in Cairo will be turned into an 
integrated Islamic complex and that his ministry has prepared an 
open budget for this project and for repairing the mosque, which 
serves more than a million people. The minister's remarks came 
during a visit to the mosque to inspect the damage caused by the 
collapse of part of the wall surrounding it. 
<H5>  EDITORIAL ON TERRORIST `DECEPTIONS' </H5>
  A signed 250-word editorial by Samir Rajab on page 1 
comments 
on the televised confessions of ex-terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi. 
He says that these confessions show that the deceived groups 
killed, stole, and sowed corruption for years, all the while 
realizing that they were committing crimes against their 
homeland and compatriots. The writer then goes on to say: "The 
problem is, how have they succeeded in brainwashing thousands of 
young people? This is the question. Do not say it is a 
question of unemployment or a housing crisis. There are many 
examples of pious and good people who refuse to commit sins 
despite all the enticements." He voices his view that what 
these groups are doing is a struggle for an illusionary 
authority by individuals who have set themselves up as amirs and 
found people to listen to them, thus degrading religion. He 
adds: "There are also those manipulating them from abroad who 
claim to be the protectors of Islam. Won't they come to their 
senses and know that the day of judgement will be difficult?" In 
conclusion, the writer says that a day will come when these 
guilty persons will regret their sins and that Egypt will always 
remain above all, "vanquishing with its true religion the lies, 
deceptions, and deviations." 
<H5>  SEMINAR URGES STUDENTS TO AVOID EXTREMIST IDEAS </H5>
  A 1,500-word report on page 4 details a seminar held at the 
al-Haram Model Secondary Boys School during one of 'AQIDATI's 
convoys of Muslim scholars. The students were addressed by 
Islamic preacher Dr. Sabri 'Abd-al-Ra'uf, teacher of 
jurisprudence and head of the Islamic and Arab Studies Center at 
the Medical College for Men at al-Azhar University, and Dr. 
Mahmud Khiami, teacher of jurisprudence at the same college. 
After explaining the role of youth and students, which he 
describes as "important and serious, with big responsiblies," 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Ra'uf lists the instructions and guidance mentioned 
in the Koran about the duty of parents and guardians toward 
their children and their education and the young's duties to 
obey their elders and abide by religious teachings. He then 
urges the students "to prepare yourselves starting now to 
shoulder responsibility in the future. This requires you to 
rise to the level of responsibility, to be an example for Muslim 
youth, and to work together to protect the homeland from any 
harm. Prior to all this, you have to work to protect your 
minds. Do not listen to all that is being said to you." He 
then urges them not to ignore the role of the family and school 
and to help their homeland achieve progress and prosperity. In 
response to questions from various students, Dr. Khiami and Dr. 
'Abd-al-Ra'uf speak at length on how Muslims should behave and 
act toward others, on the proper way to pray, on refraining from 
using bad words especially in public. 
  Then answering a question on the young people's duty to 
propagate Islam, Dr. 'Abd-al-Ra'uf says: "Your duty now, O 
sons, is to complete your studies. You are not required to be 
preachers now because preaching is a heavy responsibility and is 
not as easy as some people believe. Not everyone who has 
learned some of the Prophet's sayings or Koranic verses can make 
himeself a preacher. You, O noble son, should not sit with these 
extremists but learn from the qualified scholars." 
  In reply to the next question, Dr. Sabri 'Abd-al-Ra'uf 
says: "Regarding terrorism first, Islam does not know or 
condone terrorist actions. The terrorist is not a Muslim and is 
beyond Islam and its teachings. The prophet, God's peace and 
blessing be upon him, says that `the Muslim is the one who does 
not harm Muslims by word or deed.' A Muslim cannot do such 
things. We do not see any terrorist voicing his belief in God 
and his prophet with his heart and tongue while he is on a spree 
of destruction, killing, and sabotage." On Bosnia, he says 
that what is happening in Bosnia and Palestine indicates that 
Muslims are still ignorant of their religion and that they 
should become aware of their present and work for their future. 
After urging unity of Muslims, he adds that "victory cannot be 
achieved because of the Islamic nation's state of divisions and 
fragmentation" and we should be united and obey God's book if we 
want to protect the honor of Muslim women in Bosnia, Palestine, 
Kashmir, Burma, India, and the Philippines. The two college 
teachers then answer various questions on the proper behavior of 
Muslims and the rights and duties of parents and children. 
<H5>  WEAKNESS OF MUSLIMS ANALYZED </H5>
  A 1,200 word report on page 10 details a seminar on the 
current cultural crisis and the lesson of Andalusia [Spain under 
Arab rule], in which the speakers analyze the reasons for the 
weakness of the Muslim nation and unanimously agree that the 
main reason for this is the loss of direct contact with the 
Koran and that the remedy lies in going back to the true 
religion and its tenets. Senior preacher Shaykh Muhammad 
al-Ghazali began the seminar by saying that the Muslim nation 
might become sick but will never die. After warning that Muslims 
have become ignorant of Islam and that trivial issues have taken 
priority over fundamental questions, al-Ghazali says that if the 
nation's minds and hearts get together and are inspired by the 
Koran, then the Muslim nation can be qualified to become strong 
on the ground and sovereign -- otherwise it will remain weak and 
humiliated. He adds: "Our present links with Islam are weak 
and if we rule the world now we will corrupt it because we will 
not be presenting the true religion or a sound relationship with 
God. The belief defined by the prophet must be embedded in our 
ethics, societies, and conditions." 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Halim 'Uways, teacher of history and Islamic 
culture, makes the same point about loss of links with the Koran 
and warns that "we are facing in our Arab and Islamic world 
another surge of cheap and parasitic ideas: secular, 
materialistic, or theological. We are confronting failed schools 
of thought that are deeply immersed in the quagmire of sedition 
and are traitors to the nation's civilization and principles. 
These schools of thought do not see any good in this nation's 
present and future except by melting in the western pot even 
though western and pan-Arab experiences have proved to be a 
failure." 
<H5>  FORMER SOVIET UNION MUSLIMS STUDY IN AL-AZHAR </H5>
  A 1,400 words report on page 20 views the scholarships 
granted by the al-Azhar University for Muslim students from the 
former Soviet republics and interviews some of the students 
about their backgrounds, hopes, and ambitions. 
<H5>  COLUMNIST ON TERRORISM AND IMAGE OF ISLAM </H5>
  A 250 comment by 'Adil Dayf on the same page argues that the 
source of terrorism is Israel as evidenced by the Hebron 
massacre. He says that there is terrorism in various countries, 
including Ireland, France, and the United States, but only Islam 
is the target of accusations. He adds that "it is the Muslims 
themselves who are regrettably distorting the image of Islam 
when they commit inhuman crimes." He then calls on every Muslim 
to apply true Islam and not distort it with acts that violate 
every law "because all forms of terrorism are rejected by Muslim 
and non-Muslim countries and we should wash our hands of 
terrorism and let the whole world hear that we condemn all forms 
of terrorism and crimes in the world." He adds that the first 
and strongest condemnation should be addressed to all inhuman 
crimes, whether perpetrated by a Muslim or a non-Muslim, and 
also to Jews who use violence to expel the Arabs.

  [Text] Algiers, April 6 (AFP) -- A prominent Algerian 
businessman and opposition party leader, Mehdi Abbas Allalou, 
was badly injured in an attack in an Algiers suburb Wednesday, 
security officials said. 
  Allalou, leader of the small Popular Association for Unity 
and Action (APUA) movement, was rushed to hospital after the 
attack in the southeastern El Harrach district. Officials gave 
no details of the circumstances. 
  He was the third party leader to have been attacked since 
Moslem fundamentalists launched a bloody campaign which has 
claimed more than 3,000 lives since the authorities in January 
1992 cancelled the second round of a general election the 
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win. 
  The FIS was subsequently outlawed. 
  The businessman, known for his close ties to the Gulf 
countries and Saudi Arabia, took a stance in favour of Kuwait 
when it was invaded by Iraq in 1991.

  [Excerpts] Following the [Arab Maghreb Union] summit [in 
Tunis], Mr. Liamine Zeroual had a number of activities including 
meeting with the Algerian community in Tunisia, whom he 
addressed and called upon to work and contribute to removing 
Algeria from its plight. He stressed that the state is looking 
with every possible care at its communities abroad. 
  [Begin Zeroual recording] In the Name of God the Merciful 
and 
Most Compassionate. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me pleasure to thank you for 
the good expressions of welcome which you addressed to me. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Algerian communities abroad will be the subject of 
special in all our decisions for the service of our country and 
people. 
  More than at any time in the past, Algeria today needs all 
its children to contribute to correcting the current situation, 
promoting its development, and strengthening its true position 
among the nations to enable every citizen inside or outside our 
borders to show the sense of honor which characterizes the 
Algerian people. 
  As you know, our country currently exists in a difficult 
condition characterized by the phenomena of violence and 
terrorism which are alien to our values and traditions. It also 
lives in a critical economic crisis. 
  You all know these problems and the ways and means defined 
by 
the Algerian people to overcome them. These ways and means 
stemmed from the national conference which was held in January. 
I am committed to making things concrete in order to emphasize 
the unity of the Algerian people, ensure civil peace and calm, 
and to provide the conditions for the free choice by the nation 
within the framework of sovereignty and stability. This 
endeavor will also encompass all the necessary actions aimed at 
consolidating and activating the national economy. [end 
recording] 
  The head of state's address also touched on the course 
Algeria is following, on democracy, and the transitional period 
and on far-reaching reforms which would satisfy the citizen's 
needs and open the door for creative initiatives. In short, he 
talked before everyone on the need for a break with the past. 
  [Begin Zeroual recording] It is a break which calls for 
eliminating the spirit of monopoly in the different spheres. 
The democracy which the transitional period would strengthen 
would open the field for individual and collective freedoms. 
The far-reaching reforms of our national economy would not only 
satisfy the needs of the citizen, but would also open the field 
for creative initiatives. These are the new goals which would be 
confirmed before our expatriate community and before the whole 
of our Algerian people to enable everyone of us to offer his 
contributions to invigorate the national development effort in 
all spheres. [end recording]

  [Text] Imprisoned leaders of the outlawed Islamic Salvation 
Front [FIS] have said that they have never previously committed 
themselves to issuing a appeal for halting violence in Algeria. 
A statement, signed by two FIS officials who were released by 
the Algerian authorities on 23 March, says that the imprisoned 
FIS leaders, chief among whom are Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, 
believe that a proposal made by General Liamine Zeroual when he 
was defense minister was premature and ineffective. 
  The FIS leaders' proposal calls for the drafting of an 
appeal 
urging the Algerian people to remain calm and confident. The 
two FIS officials cite three conditions laid down by the FIS 
leaders for a political settlement of the Algerian crisis. 
These conditions may be summed up as the total release of the 
front's leaders, the provision of comprehensive and detailed 
information on the general situation in the country, and the 
opening of a direct and comprehensive dialogue with various 
parties to decide the country's destiny.

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>
  [Excerpt] AL-SHA'B has learned that approximately 160 
senior military commanders in the Algerian Army are secretly 
working with the Islamists. According to diplomatic reports, 
these commanders are planning to deal a crushing blow to the 
pillars of the regime in Algeria. Approximately 40 percent of 
the Algerian Army's equipment and weapons has reached the hands 
of Islamists between November of last year and this February. 
  A recent report by the U.S. State Department affirms that 
the 
Islamists' control of the Algerian regime would shatter 
stability in the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Arab Gulf regions. 
The report expresses extreme concern at the prospects of the 
Islamists' reaching power in Algeria, particularly because the 
Algerian Army has proved to be extremely weak and divided before 
them. The report stresses that the Algerian Army will fall 
under the control of the Islamists in the next six months. The 
report does not rule out the possibility that the Islamists 
could rule Algeria by next year. 
  The report stresses the need for rapid intervention to 
rescue 
Algeria from the "fundamentalists" and giving the U.S. fleet in 
the Mediterranean specific prerogatives to monitor the situation 
and intervene immediately should conditions become unfavorable 
to the government. Accordingly, reports indicate that the U.S. 
Defense Department (the Pentagon) has been instructed to prepare 
a plan on the various political and military possibilities in 
Algeria in the coming stage and the U.S. role to deal with them. 
The U.S. report stresses that the Islamists' control of the 
country will be harmful to U.S. security in the Mediterranean, 
Red Sea, and the Arab Gulf. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, al-Tayr [April] 6 (JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY) 
-- The Spanish foreign minister, Javier Solana, has expressed 
his country's condemnation of the unjust harsh measures imposed 
on the Great Jamahiriyah by the Security Council at the bidding 
of the Western countries. He said that the Lockerbie incident 
had caused a state of tension and instability in the region of 
the Mediterranean. 
  After his meeting with Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, the 
secretary general of the Arab League, the Spanish foreign 
minister said that the secretary general had given him a 
detailed explanation of the Arab League Council resolution 
concerning the trying of the suspects by the International Court 
of Justice in the [word indistinct] and had expressed his 
satisfaction with this resolution. The minister said that the 
resolution would ensure a just and impartial trial for the 
suspects and complied with international resolutions. 
  He added that Spain strongly favoured this resolution and 
would be calling on the countries of the European Community to 
adopt it and to act to have it adopted in a serious and speedy 
manner. He said that his country would be co-operating with the 
Arab League in order to have this resolution publicised, that 
Spain had a special relationship with the Jamahiriyah and all 
the Arabs, and realised the importance of bringing an end to the 
Lockerbie issue, given its concern for stability and security in 
the region. 
  The Spanish foreign minister added that his country opposes 
the arbitrary American Western stance of rejecting all solutions 
aimed at defusing this crisis. 
  At the same time, he applauded the Great Jamahiriyah's 
positive response in dealing with the crisis despite the 
injustice it suffered as a result of the baseless measures 
imposed on it. 
  He ended by saying that Spain would soon be calling on 
France, Britain and the United States to realise the need to 
respond to this peaceful initiative and to request that they 
accept the Arab League's resolution.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl, lawyer for the two </F>
suspects in the Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, by Tal'at Rumayh 
in Tripoli; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Rumayh] Could you please 
specify the accusations against the two suspects point by point? 
  [Al-Ghuwayl] The accusations are based on four pieces of 
evidence against the suspects: 
  1. The fact that 'Abd-al-Basit al-Miqrahi [one of the 
suspects] was in Malta on 7 December. He bought things from 
some shop and the shop owner testified to the purchase. 
  2. Al-Amin Fuhaymah's [second suspect] private diary. 
  3. The timers, the story of which came to light with the 
fall of East Germany. It was discovered that the timers were 
also sold to East Germany. 
  4. The story of the suitcase shipped from Malta. But this 
piece of evidence was automatically dropped. Even an FBI report 
sent from Frankfurt to its headquarters in the United States 
recommended that this piece of evidence be dropped because 
shipping an unaccompanied suitcase from a country to another 
cannot be done without sending a cable with it and taking 
specific administrative measures. The cable is not there and no 
measures were taken; it would be difficult to fabricate this 
because a long time passed before the indictment was issued. 
  If some "suitcases" passed, they must have entered from 
Frankfurt airport without going through the detection machine. 
This casts much doubt on those who carried out this operation. 
The suitcases were American-made. 
  There is also a stunning thing that we will reveal soon; it 
will deal a crushing blow to the accusations against the Libyans. 
  [Rumayh] What is that? 
  [Al-Ghuwayl] On 30 December 1988, CIA agents visited Mr. 
Polier [name as published], owner of the factory producing the 
timers used in the bombing crime. They sought to wrest a 
confession from him that he sold the timers only to Libya 
although the piece of the timer had not yet been discovered in 
the plane's wreckage. 
  More surprisingly, this timer piece, over which Libya was 
accused, was not found by the Scottish police but by American 
FBI agents in Scotland! 
  This indicates that the accusation against Libya was 
deliberate and prearranged. 
  More seriously, the CIA asked the aforementioned person to 
say that he personally went to Malta on 20 December -- a few 
days before the incident -- to install the timers on the 
explosives on behalf of the Libyans. Under pressure, he wrote 
them something to that effect. However, circumstances did not 
serve them; at that specific time the same person was already 
booked on another flight to a different airport. They, 
therefore, did not use the piece of paper he wrote for them. 
  Regarding the testimony of the Maltese vendor who claimed 
that things were bought from him, it is invalid. His testimony 
against the suspects said that the purchase was made on a rainy 
day and that there was a football match between Italy and 
Germany on that day. We checked the weather bulletin but found 
that it was not raining that day. We also checked the dates of 
matches but did not find any match on that day. The match to 
which the witness referred was played on 23 November 1988, 
several months before that date. 
  There remains the story of Fuhaymah's diary. These are the 
papers taken from his diary. There is nothing in them. All 
that happened is that the accusers of al-Amin Fuhaymah joined 
some lines together and read them as they wanted. This is the 
paper, please read it! "'Abd-al-Basit coming from Zurich with 
Salvo. Take the tanks." What is this? Various points on 
various topics and impressions. They put them together and made 
accusations out of them according to their whims. 
  [Rumayh] From your own point of view, how could this problem 
be solved? 
  [Al-Ghuwayl] This is a media effort. I believe that even 
among the Arabs there are those who believe that Libya is 
involved. The fact is that whoever carefully reads the 
accusations and the answers to them and whoever is versed in the 
legal precedents, even those in the United States, on the 
acceptance of holding trials in foreign countries without 
insisting on demanding an extradition -- whoever carefully reads 
this will discover that all these accusations are fabricated. 
We are now in the process of preparing booklets to explain 
these matters from all the angles. We will distribute these 
booklets to the public, intellectuals, decisionmaking centers, 
and even the Arab leaders themselves. 
  [Rumayh] Time is in favor of which side? 
  [Al-Ghuwayl] So far it is in their favor. Nevertheless, 
certain things happened recently that refuted many of the false 
accusations. Following the downfall of East Germany and during 
the trial of intelligence officers, it was proved that the 
"timers" used in the bombings were also delivered to East 
Germany. It is not true that they were only delivered to Libya. 
  [Rumayh] Are the two suspects leading a normal life? 
  [Al-Ghuwayl] They are not leading a normal life. As is 
known, they are confined to their houses. According to the 
Montreal treaty, the authorities guarantee their presence so 
that they can be brought in at any time. We have not asked for 
changing this treatment so that the option of their trial in 
Libya will also remain open.

'Arafat condemns the terrorist attack in 'Afula. Shetrit 
expressed the belief that all the cabinet ministers will support 
his proposal. The minister said that not only has 'Arafat failed 
to condemn the terrorist attack of his own volition but also 
avoided replying to a question on the matter yesterday in Cairo. 
  Shetrit explained that by his actions, 'Arafat is giving 
cause to doubt the sincerity of his intention to fulfill his 
commitments to Israel. Shetrit said that Prime Minister Rabin 
and Foreign Minister Peres will find the appropriate time and 
place to comment on 'Arafat's behavior.

  [Text] Security sources said yesterday that the 
booby-trapped car that blew up in 'Afula was assembled by 
experts. They believe the terrorist who was killed in the blast 
did not assemble the car bomb but was merely a suicide driver. 
  The sources added that this type of booby-trapped car is 
used 
by Hizballah. Therefore, it may very well be that the gang that 
assembled the bomb used the know-how acquired by the Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] activists who were deported to 
Lebanon in December 1992 and who returned to the territories a 
few months ago. The sources pointed out that the deportees, who 
spent a year at the Marj al-Zuhur encampment, were trained in 
the preparation of bombs and booby-trapped cars by Hizballah 
experts and Iranian elements.

two sustained moderate injuries. The wounded were taken to 
Rehovot's Kaplan Hospital where the hospital director later told 
us that one of the casualties had died of his wounds. The 
nationality of the dead man remains unknown. 
  One of the terrorists was killed, but his accomplice or 
accomplices managed to escape. According to the reports, the 
terrorists fired from a bus or car at people standing at a 
hitchhiking stop at the Ashdod Junction. The dead terrorist was 
killed by bystanders who shot at him from the junction.

  [Text] An Israeli resident of the Qatif Bloc was stabbed 
and slightly wounded this morning by a terrorist near the 
Kissufim checkpoint in the Gaza Strip. He is currently being 
evacuated to a hospital in Beersheba. 
  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that the Israeli came to 
the checkpoint to pick up workers. On his way back to the Qatif 
Bloc, he was stabbed in the chest and shoulder by one of the 
workers. The terrorist dropped the knife and fled. Other 
workers called soldiers from the checkpoint who found the 
wounded man in his car. The security forces have launched a 
manhunt after the assailant. 
  In another incident, an Israeli citizen was injured in 
Qalqilyah when his car was pelted with stones. He lost control 
of the vehicle, which overturned. The man sustained moderate 
injuries and was taken to a hospital in Kefar Sava. 
  The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] tightened the closure on the 
territories this morning and increased security at its 
checkpoints, especially in Samaria. Soldiers are conducting 
very thorough inspections and hardly any Samaria Arabs are being 
permitted to enter the Green Line.

  [Excerpt] A total closure will be imposed on the 
territories from 1700 [1400 GMT] this afternoon, following the 
recent spate of terrorist attacks. Our correspondent Shlomo Raz 
reports that from that hour onwards, Arabs from the territories 
will not be permitted to enter the Green Line. 
  This morning, the chief of staff said it is impossible to 
completely prevent terrorist attacks in retaliation for the 
Hebron massacre. He praised the soldiers at the Ashdod Junction 
for showing initiative by shooting and killing the terrorist. 
  The prime minister will convene the Ministerial Committee on 
Security Affairs for a special session tomorrow in order to 
discuss the deterioration in the security situation and decide 
on the necessary steps. 
  The leaders of the opposition factions are meeting at Likud 
headquarters in Tel Aviv this afternoon to discuss the 
situation. They will demand the establishment of a commission of 
inquiry into the wave of terrorist attacks and a halt to the 
negotiations with the PLO. Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan called 
on the government to resign and call new elections. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by On Levi] </F>
  [Text] Thousands of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] reservists 
have recently been issued special call-up orders to reinforce 
the Army's presence in Hebron and to replace some of the regular 
Army units that have been stationed inside and around the town 
since the massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs over one month 
ago. 
  The commanders of these units have been receiving dozens of 
requests from soldiers asking to be released from reserve duty 
because of personal or business-related problems. Yesterday, 
IDF sources explained that were it possible, they would have 
been glad to do without the service of these soldiers, and 
promised that these soldiers will be the first of those in the 
field to be released from duty. 
  The call-up orders were issued without giving the soldiers 
the required advance notice. They were based on a special 
authorization issued by Major General Yoram Ya'ir, head of the 
IDF Manpower Branch, in light of the situation. According to 
senior military sources, "the situation made the call-up of 
reserve soldiers necessary. We cannot freeze the education and 
training of the regular soldiers for long periods. The 
detrimental effect this has had on the regular soldiers is 
already untenable." The sources added that employing the 
reservists will involve thousands of reserve duty days and 
constitute a difficult burden for the reserve soldiers. 
  Over the past few weeks, reservists from the Artillery and 
Infantry Corps have received thousands of call-up orders for 
special operational activity in the territories. The call-up 
orders were issued without the customary 44-day advance notice. 
At this stage, call-up orders have been sent to reservists who 
were not supposed to serve in the territories in the current 
workyear. The units called up for special reserve duty have 
done long periods of reserve duty in the territories over the 
past two years, and the IDF had originally intended to refrain 
from using these units this year. 
  The call-up orders were sent to the soldiers several weeks 
ago, in the wake of a situation analysis conducted by the 
General Staff's Operations Department. The commanders of the 
reserve units met with Maj. Gen. Yoram Ya'ir over the past few 
days to protest the decision to break the promises made earlier 
to their soldiers.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Some 500 IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] reserve officers, most of whom are still on active 
reserve duty, yesterday sent the prime minister a petition, 
declaring: "Eretz Yisra'el belongs to the Jewish people, and you 
have no right to give it away to strangers! 'Arafat is no 
better than a war criminal! Terror must not be rewarded!" 
  The reserve officers -- ranking from lieutenant to brigadier 
general -- signed a petition initiated by Aharay [Follow Me], a 
reserve officers movement opposing the agreement with the PLO. 
Among the signatories are Reserve Brigadier Generals Amatzya Hen 
and David Hago'el. 
  The letter further states: "All our lives, we fought for our 
homeland, we went to battle, guarded the border, and lost 
friends while defending our homeland. By giving away parts of 
the homeland to the murderers of women and children and shaking 
hands that are covered in blood, you are telling us that our war 
was in vain. Our comrades fell in vain, and the battle order 
was a mistake, because it could have been solved by surrender 
and concessions to the aggressor and the murderer. 
  "We are opposed to this terrible move, which leads to 
complete surrender, to an indefensible country, and the loss of 
all moral values, as well as the loss of our capital of 
Jerusalem the streets of which are already decorated with PLO 
flags," the reserve officers write.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Sever Plotzker: "There Will No War Over </F>
Water"] 
  [Text] Once again they threaten us with war over the 
Middle East water. This time the threats are made by 
entrepreneurs who wish to set up a project for desalinizing 
water in Israel. According to them, the project would cost some 
$3 billion, and apparently not less than $5 billion. 
  The project may well be very profitable, but please, stop 
scaring us by saying that a water shortage would lead to war. 
Economists are not familiar with the term shortage separated 
from the notion of price. Shortage, they say, is always 
relative -- it is related to the price of the commodity in 
question. For example, when the price of gold was $12 an ounce, 
there was a terrible shortage of it on the world markets. At 
$660 an ounce, there was an enormous oversupply. Eventually, the 
forces of the market created a balance. 
  The same holds true for any commodity: gold, water, or oil. 
The oil lesson is the most studied and the most outstanding 
example. In the spring of 1981, an oil barrel went for $60 (in 
1994 prices) on the free market. Since then, the price of oil 
dropped by 75 percent. Today you can buy a barrel for $14. 
What happened? 
  The high prices of oil led to worldwide searches for it, 
from 
the North Sea to the China Sea, not to mention the oil drills on 
the Tel Aviv stock exchange. Worldwide proven oil reserves have 
doubled (!) despite pumping and consumption. 
  The high prices motivated oil consumers and energy producers 
to save by any possible means. Energy conservation was 
discovered as a new source of wealth for the nations. 
  New free markets of all types of oil were created. OPEC, the 
oil producers cartel, began losing its power. Oil-producing 
countries started cheating, producing and selling more than they 
had agreed to. They discovered the appealing charm of the free 
market, where you are king if you sell your oil at $.001 less 
than the agreed-upon price. 
  And we have not yet mentioned the secret oil treasures of 
Russia, the Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan, only a little 
of which has been uncovered. 
  The case of the oil shortage is important for us to 
understand that there is no such thing as "water shortage," just 
as there never was an oil shortage. Furthermore, unlike oil, 
water can be recycled. 
  The real economic question, therefore, is whether it would 
be 
possible in the future to supply most of the amount of water in 
demand while maintaining a "reasonable" price -- that is, a 
price that would not cause entire production fields to collapse, 
would preserve a good public health system, and would not 
financially devastate the poor water consumers. The answer to 
all of the above is positive. 
  Water conservation in our region has enormous potential. 
Just by preventing waste, promoting efficient use, and 
improving water pipes, we could reduce all types of water 
consumption by 30-40 percent without seriously harming anything. 
  Water desalination could prove very profitable. Desalination 
techniques are constantly improving and production costs keep 
falling; hence, water prices will constantly drop. Small- and 
medium-size desalination plants are profitable already at this 
time. 
  Consumption of purified water -- which is cheap and has 
almost unlimited sources -- is expected to rise. Here too, 
technologies constantly improve. 
  There will be no "war over water" in the Middle East, and 
peace between us and our neighbors will not rise or fall over 
the water issue, which is economic and technical. 
  The problem of water shortage will be solved if it is dealt 
with by economic experts and engineers, and not by politicians 
and lobbyists.

  [Text] Baghdad, 6 Apr (INA)--The National Command of the 
Arab Socialist Ba'th Party has emphasized that Iraq--with its 
civilized depth, distinguished pan-Arab role in the past and 
present, liberation achievements, and delicate Arab awareness, 
as well as the courage of its Ba'thist vanguard and the 
ingenuity of its leader comrade struggler Saddam Husayn--has, 
under the Ba'th Party's banner, renewed its position as a center 
of strength and a preventive shield for the Arab nation. 
  In a statement on the 47th anniversary of founding the Ba'th 
Party, which will be marked tomorrow, the National Command said 
that the responsibility for safeguarding understanding and 
promoting the militant state to the highest level requires the 
masses' ranks to be equipped with militant thinking and a new 
awareness of both the nation's battle and its historic depth and 
civilized essence. 
  The National Command explained that the Arab nation's forces 
can foil the schemes of fragmentation and internationalization 
of domestic problems, and can also mobilize the nation's 
resources to lift the embargo on Iraq. 
  The National Command also stressed that the jihad in the 
Mother of Battles was a slogan for adhering to principles and 
insisting on entrenching basic values through liberating the 
people and moving international relations to a new level free 
from the spirit of trusteeship and the domination of world 
colonialism. It called on Arab parties, political 
organizations, trade unions, intellectuals, and literary and 
artistic people as well as all parts of nation's body to wage 
the battle of fateful civilized conflict by maintaining the 
spirit of resistance shown in both the Mother of Battles and the 
intifadah.

  [Text] Baghdad, 6 Apr (INA) -- The Arab Liberation Front 
[ALF] this evening held a speech rally to mark its 25th founding 
anniversary, which coincides with the the Arab Socialist Ba'th 
Party [ASBP] anniversary. 
  Sa'di Mahdi Salih, member of the Iraq Command of the ASBP 
delivered a speech at the function, also attended by 
'Abd-al-Majid al-Rafi'i and Badr al-Din Muddathir, members of 
the National Command of the ASBP. Salih first communicated 
greetings from His Excellency President Saddam Husayn to the 
people of the intifadah in Palestine. He emphasized that the 
party leadership is absolutely confident of complete victory, 
notwithstanding the unsavory character of certain incumbent Arab 
politicians and leaders. 
  The Mother of Battles agenda has forced the 
Zionist-American tyrants to expose all the agent puppets, 
leaving none of the agents in the ranks of the Arab nation 
capable of concealing their treasonous connections. 
  Salih was followed by 'Azzam al-Ahmad, the state of 
Palestine's ambassador in Baghdad. 'Azzam said that, led by 
Saddam Husayn, Iraq is bound to bring its ambitions to fruition, 
since they are those of the Arab nation. He said he was certain 
Iraq will ride out the sanctions crisis and mount a successful 
challenge to all types of aggression, and, in the end, emerge 
the victor. 
  The Zionist enemy, he went on, is working to liquidate the 
Palestinian cause and extinguish the freedom of the Palestinian 
people to pursue their advancement and independence. 
  The next speech was delivered on behalf of the professional 
and popular Palestinian organizations, which voiced their 
appreciation and recognition of the support they have been 
receiving from President Saddam Husayn in pursuing their 
programs in Iraq. 
  Mr. Anwar Daklas, president of the General Union of 
Palestinian Engineers said: We have learned from President 
Saddam Husayn's Iraq all the militant values that will help us 
attain our liberation and advancement. 
  Mr. Abu-Mahmud, deputy secretary general of the ALF 
delivered 
a speech in which he stressed that over the past 25 years, the 
front has fought all the battles in which the national existence 
and legitimacy of the Palestinian people were at stake and stood 
up to the Zionist and anti-Arab enemies. 
  He called for severing all forms of contacts pursuing a 
settlement with the enemy and quitting the policy of making free 
concessions. He also urged that all forms of struggle, armed 
struggle in particular, be intensified against occupation and 
that all resources be mobilized to refine the valiant popular 
intifadah.

  [Text] London -- 'Abbas 'Abd 'Awn, an important money 
changer, who was executed in Baghdad last Sunday, was reportedly 
related to President Saddam Husayn. Iraqi opposition sources 
told AL-HAYAH in London yesterday 'Awn "worked for an operation 
run by Saddam's sons 'Udayy and Qusayy, which traded in hard 
currency in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq, including the 
Kurdish-controlled north." 
  The Associated Press reported that Arab sources yesterday 
cited Iraqi officials as saying that 'Abbas 'Awn was convicted 
of dealing with "hostile external powers" bent on undermining 
the Iraqi dinar. 
  Travelers confirm the news of the execution. 'Awn had been 
apprehended on 3 January, 1994, but was then released. 
  According to the same sources, 'Abbas 'Awn was executed by 
firing squad, along with his brother-in-law, Qasim Qaqiyah, and 
others. 
  Sources of the "United National Iraqi Opposition" told 
AL-HAYAH the day before yesterday that 'Awn was bankrolling 
Iraq's military industries. Also executed with him were Majid 
Hulw, Qasim 'Abd-al-Karim Hasan, and his chaufeur.

  [Excerpts] In a press interview before leaving for Syria, 
brother Jalal Talabani, secretary general of the Patriotic Union 
of Kurdistan [PUK], said: [passage omitted] I will visit Syria 
first before going on to Europe, Egypt, and possibly Saudi 
Arabia. [passage omitted] 
  The main aim of my tour is to strengthen and consolidate 
Kurdish political activity abroad, explain conditions in 
Kurdistan, and request aid to rebuild Kurdish society. We will 
also demand that the blockade imposed on Kurdistan be lifted, 
that a solution be found for our problems, and that the 
necessary protection be afforded to Kurdistan. We will ask the 
United States and Europe to help us with weapons and training so 
that we can form our own main protection force in the Kurdistan 
region. We will also ask them to help us build a modern police 
force capable of safeguarding security and stability in 
Kurdistan. We will ask them to continue their aerial protection 
on a permanent basis. With these three methods, we can provide 
the necessary protection for Iraqi Kurdistan. We will also try 
to increase the humanitarian aid for the Kurdistan region's 
people and explain the situation in Kurdistan. [passage omitted] 
  On the Iraqi regime's threats to launch an offensive against 
liberated Iraqi Kurdistan, especially following the renewal of 
the UN sanctions on Baghdad, brother Talabani said: I believe 
the ruling dictatorial, fascist regime in Baghdad is serious in 
its threats. The attempt to attack the Kurdistan region is one 
of the dreams of the dictatorial regime. But we have seen the 
miscalculations of the head of the defeated Iraqi regime, such 
as his war against Iran and his occupation of Kuwait. He also 
made many mistakes during his war against Kurdistan. I believe 
his mistakes this time will be added to his previous mistakes. 
I believe the regime is serious in its threats but I am not 
afraid of these threats. If the regime embarks on such a 
desperate attempt, it will help us to liberate the remaining 
parts of occupied Kurdistan. The regime will meet its doom, 
because the Kurdistan people are prepared for sacrifice. The 
peshmerga forces in Kurdistan are prepared to confront the 
enemies. The international coalition forces will deal a deadly 
blow to the dictatorial regime's force. If the regime's forces 
come under air strikes, they will suffer utter defeat, not only 
in Kurdistan, but elsewhere in Iraq. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sanaa, 6 Apr (MENA)--An official Yemeni source has 
denied a statement by an official at the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP], led by 'Ali Salim al-Bid, about a north Yemeni military 
buildup on the former border regions between the north and the 
south of Yemen. The source said the YSP official's statement is 
not true and aims to cover up the military buildup and movements 
by the forces of the YSP in al-Dali' and Shabwah in the south. 
  The source warned against attempts by the YSP separatists, 
as 
he described them, to seriously escalate the military situation, 
dragging the country into a crushing civil war that could lead 
to separation and return the country to the situation it was in 
before 22 May 1990, the day unity was declared. 
  The Yemeni source said the YSP separatists are seeking 
military escalation to circumvent the Pledge and Accord document 
and hinder the implementation of the decisions made by the 
Council of Ministers in its latest meeting in Aden. The 
decisions provide for withdrawing troops from the former border 
regions. 
  The source denied reports that several countries offered 
proposals to solve the Yemeni crisis on the basis of federation 
or confederation. No Arab brother made such proposals. Indeed, 
they all stressed support for the Yemeni unity and its 
continuation, the source said. 
  The official Yemeni source stressed that the General 
People's 
Congress, led by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, is eager for 
dialogue among the political forces as the only option and the 
best solution to protect unity, reach understanding on common 
denominators to build the Yemeni state, and entrench the course 
of unity. 
  The source denied reports that during the meeting in Salalah 
in Oman, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih threatened to resort to 
war to solve the crisis. The source said these reports are 
false and are being promoted to cover up the YSP's unjustified 
military escalation and preparation for war.

  [Text] A responsible security source has stated the 
following: At about 2000 last night, Wednesday, 6 April 1994, 
very powerful explosions were heard throughout the city of 
Dhamar and its suburbs. Amid the roaring explosions, perhaps 
caused by the bullets and shells fired from various light, 
medium, and heavy weapons, the streets of the city and the 
surrounding villages became empty of pedestrians and citizens, 
who sought refuge in their homes. As a result, panic prevailed 
in the region. It was later discovered that the source of the 
explosions was the Ba-Suhayb camp, south of the city, and that 
forces in the camp arbitrarily fired shells toward the inhabited 
mountains and some government departments in Dhamar, including 
the Dhamar governorship, the governorate's security department, 
and other government offices. The shelling also included the 
headquarters of the Central Security Forces and the Republican 
Guard, whose personnel maintained complete calm and self- 
restraint to avoid any escalation. 
  When, after more than an hour, the powerful explosions and 
firing of bullets stopped, and in light of the contacts and 
investigations that were held by competent authorities in the 
govenorate, it was revealed that guards at the camp's gate had 
been arbitrarily fired at by an unidentified speeding red sedan. 
None of the guards was injured. Immediately, the camp's troops 
mobilized their armored vehicles, various types of machine guns, 
and a tanks battalion, which assumed an offensive posture. 
Then, the region was set alight when the troops fired hundreds 
of shells, as explained above. 
  The security source added: According to all the available 
information and contacts that have been held by competent 
authorities there was no acceptable justification for such an 
irresponsible act by the Ba-Suhayb troops. 
  The source added: We warn against the gravity of that act 
which aims at disturbing the national security, stability, and 
social and political safety. We warn against the gravity of 
committing such provocations. We demand that the joint military 
committee expeditiously investigates all the circumstances of 
this incident and informs the people of the entire truth. God 
testifies to our true intentions.

  [Text] Sanaa, April 7 (AFP) -- Southern troops based in 
northern Yemen bombarded the town of Dhamar, raining hundreds of 
rockets on official buildings in an hour-long raid, police said 
Thursday [7 April]. 
  There were no reports on the number of casualties or the 
damage caused during the attack late Wednesday by a battalion of 
southern troops from Basahib, based south of Dhamar, 100 
kilometres (62 miles) south of Sanaa. 
  Police said the bombardment followed an attack on guards 
outside the Basahib camp when unidentified gunmen opened fire 
from their car, without wounding anyone. 
  A police statement sent to AFP said the mortars had been 
fired at several districts housing official buildings, the 
national guard headquarters and the police station. 
  Northern troops did not return fire, the statement added. 
  The north and south armies have not been merged since former 
North and South Yemen were united in May 1990. 
  A crisis broke out eight months ago when Vice President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, a southerner, refused to take up his duties in the 
capital Sanaa in the north, citing security fears and demanding 
major political and economic reform. 
  Clashes between the rival armies have continued despite a 
reconciliation accord signed in Amman on February 20. 
  In Sanaa a member of President 'Ali 'Abdallah 'Salih's 
General People's Congress blamed leaders of al-Bid's Yemen 
Socialist Party (YSP) for the attack saying they "were trying to 
lead the country into war." 
  A YSP leader confirmed to AFP that the attack had taken 
place 
adding it had been provoked "by northern forces." 
  Al-Bid called on his northern rival Salih on Sunday to 
withdraw all northern troops based in the centre of the country, 
while in turn all southern troops in northern Yemen would pull 
back to the south. 
  The two men were meeting for the first time since the 
signing 
of the Amman accord in Salalah in Oman. But their talks 
concluded without any sign of ending the crisis which is 
threatening to tear the country apart. 
  A member of the presidential council, 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al- 
Ghani, told AFP that al-Bid's proposal for a redeployment of 
troops would end up destroying unity. 
  He added "noone here wants war," saying the only way forward 
was to continue dialogue with southern "opponents." 
  About 300,000 northern and southern troops are stationed in 
the southern regions of Abanye and Shabwah to monitor the Yemeni 
oil fields. 
  Although Yemen is only a small producer of about 340,000 
barrels a day, control of the natural resource is essential to 
ensure the survival of the government in the north or any future 
creation of a southern breakaway rival.

  [Text] The U.S. Navy stationed at the entrance of the Gulf 
of Aqaba in the Straits of Tiran is not satisfied with just the 
siege, the inspections, and the scaring away of ships. Indeed, 
the issue has reached the point of laying siege to a Jordan 
Television [JTV] crew that was trying to film the ships that 
have been intercepted without encroaching on the security 
measures required by the Americans. 
  AL-BILAD's information has confirmed that more than one 
military boat circled the JTV crew and seized their cameras. It 
was not until a final intervention that the television crew, 
their cameras, and the rest of their equipment were released. 
  Official Jordanian sources kept the report a secret. 
However, other reliable sources told AL-BILAD that the case is 
not over and that upon the request of the Information Ministry, 
the Foreign Ministry took quick measures that could lead to more 
tension in the relations between Washington and Amman. 
  This tension was clear in His Majesty King Husayn's 
statements the week before last when he said that Jordan will 
not go to the negotiations unless the Americans and their allies 
find a suitable solution to the inspection operations, which 
have taken a serious course that encroaches on Jordanian 
sovereignty.

  [Text] Amman--(Petra)--His Royal Highness Crown Prince 
Hasan on Wednesday called on Muslim and Christian scholars to 
promote the scope of Christian-Muslim dialogue and to highlight 
Islam's position vis-a-vis Jerusalem. 
  Addressing a three-day meeting on Jerusalem which ended at 
the King 'Abdallah Mosque Wednesday, Prince Hasan said scholars 
also had the duty to clarify Islam's positive relations with the 
Christians throughout the ages. 
  The meeting coincided with preparations by some people (in 
the west) to observe the 3,000th year of "founding" Jerusalem, 
Prince Hasan said. 
  "We have to discuss and prove by science and research that 
Jerusalem existed before David and after him," the Crown Prince 
said. "We do not talk about this in mere rhetorics or in an 
emotional manner. We seek to remind the world of the historic 
eras which are linked together starting from the Cannanites and 
the other Arabs," the Crown Prince said in an address to the 40 
scholars gathered at Basman Palace. 
  "I wanted to talk to you today about what we can call divine 
sovereignty over Jerusalem that does not conflict with political 
sovereignty. I would like to point out that divine sovereignty 
derives its dignity and esteem from its value and from the 
morals of the faithful who believe in it," Prince Hasan said. 
"In this context, we can only express pride in the Al al-Bayt 
University, which is due to embark on the experiment of setting 
up an institute for Christian studies," he noted. 
  "We hope this institute, (the first of its kind in the 
region), would yield good results because we believe that the 
time has come for the world to realise that this nation has 
always been oriented towards promoting culture," the Crown 
Prince said. 
  Addressing the delegates, Prince Hasan said: "You have to 
enhance the concept of the holiness of the city of Jerusalem and 
promote dialogue among the religions and reaffirm the status of 
the Holy City for the Christians and Muslims. 
  "We are facing a historic moment entitled `survival of the 
more competent' in expression and best in presenting reason in 
dialogue. I believe that the media in particular have a role to 
play but without much rhetorics and excessive emotions. 
  "We have to conduct a dialogue that caters to the spirit of 
the modern age and we have to be aware of our rights and 
highlight them. 
  "Our dialogue could be emotional, but it should have reason 
and responsibility, especially as we mourn our martyrs who fell 
in the Hebron massacre. We have to direct our reason and 
dialogue in a true and scientific manner away from selfishness 
and we should not allow weakness to be the sole method of 
expression because this would lead to counter-violence devoid of 
reason. 
  "Through your courage and wisdom you can encourage people to 
resort to reason and positive thinking and can enhance the 
spirit of wisdom as we strive to remind the world of the 
greatness of Islam and the greatness of the Arab Muslim 
Christian project. Remember that Jerusalem is in need of your 
efforts under the current difficult circumstances." 
  Several speakers among the delegates addressed the meeting, 
focusing on the importance of Christian-Islamic dialogue. 
  Field Marshal 'Abd al-Rahman Siwar al-Dhahab of Sudan paid 
tribute to His Majesty King Husayn's devotion and dedication to 
safeguarding the holy places in Jerusalem. 
  He noted that the King sold part of his personal property in 
order to finance the restoration of the holy sites in Jerusalem. 
  The scholars who took part in the three-day meeting, 
organised by the general Islamic Congress for Jerusalem, issued 
a statement at the end of their conference denouncing American 
policies for their disregard of the international resolutions 
regarding Jerusalem. 
  The statement condemned American policies, which "express 
Zionism's ambitions and intentions to seize the Holy City and 
make it the united capital of Israel." 
  The statement also rejected the American stand vis-a-vis the 
Hebron massacre and Washington's "opposition to a resolution 
that would have condemned Israel's terrorism." 
  It deplored Washington's retreat from the U.N. Security 
Council resolution that considered Jerusalem as part of the 
occupied territories and not a disputed land. 
  The statement called on the Arab and Islamic countries to 
unify their rank and adopt a collective position with regard to 
"the issues of destiny, foremost of which the issue of 
Jerusalem." 
  It called on the Arabs and Muslims to "defend Arab and 
islamic rights in the face of Zionism's expansionist and 
aggressive plots." 
  The statement urged Muslims and Christians to "promote their 
dialogue, encourage tolerance and solidarity among the faithful 
and set up a special fund for the reconstruction of Jerusalem."

  [Text] According to well-informed sources, who spoke to 
AL-BILAD, the existence of "Jordanian Afghans," cannot be ruled 
out. But there are only a handful of them. They fled 
Afghanistan to Kenya among a group of other Arabs who have 
recently sought refuge in Africa. 
  Led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian medical doctor, this 
group is seeking entry into southern Sudan from Kenya. 
Al-Zawahiri has been to Nairobi a number of times in an effort 
to find a place for Arabs forced to leave Pakistan. Khartoum 
has balked at accepting them. 
  Over the past three months, there has been a mass exodus of 
"Arab Afghans" who have taken Pakistan's threats to expel them 
seriously.

  [Text] Aqaba (Petra)--Labour Minister Khalid al-Ghizawi 
Friday [April 1] said the ministry is planning to replace 
non-Jordanians working in the fields of medicine, engineering, 
administration and clerical fields, accounting and driving with 
Jordanian job seekers. In an interview with the Jordan News 
Agency, Petra, Mr. al-Ghizawi said this step is aimed at 
organising the local labour market, a measure which is essential 
in the battle against unemployment, the minister added. The 
ministry's decision was made after the completion of a study of 
the labour market which aimed at identifying characteristics of 
job-seekers. The minister said that the ministry is making 
great efforts to encourage Jordanians to work in the agriculture 
sector, where the presence of a non-Jordanian labour force is 
prominent. He added that because of the low participation of 
Jordanians in this sector, the ministry will continue to depend 
on non-Jordanian labour.

<F P=106> ["An Issue and Opinion" column by Salamah 'Ukur: "The Fight </F>
With Chairs Is a Serious Sign"] 
  [Text] The regrettable fight with chairs that erupted 
Wednesday [30 March] between Fatah and Hamas supporters during a 
Land Day rally at the professional unions' complex was another 
sign that these political forces will not hesitate, if 
necessary, to turn Jordan into an arena for conflict and the 
settling of accounts. 
  We were not surprised by the dialogue, which involved the 
use 
of chairs, at this complex. The winds of democracy have not yet 
reached the ranks and the organization of these political 
forces. Democratic dialogue is lacking among them. Likewise, we 
will not be surprised by fresh dialogues using other tools, 
including, perhaps, bullets, exactly like what has frequently 
happened in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank, and also 
similar to what happened earlier in Lebanon. 
  We frequently cautioned against the infiltration by external 
forces and organizations into our official, popular, and trade 
union institutions. These forces would pursue activities that 
have nothing to do with the Jordanian people's issues, problems, 
and concerns. Moreover, the rallies and interests of these 
forces have no room for Jordanian national occasions. 
  We also frequently cautioned against turning Jordan into a 
hotbed of tension or a heated arena for conflicts and battles 
among non-Jordanian organizations and forces which are not 
interested in safeguarding this country's security and 
stability. We are very afraid that the phenomenon of quarreling 
by chair will escalate and become a fiercer fight using more 
dangerous tools. 
  We are also very afraid that Fatah, which is now preparing 
to 
assume the self-rule authority in Gaza and Jericho, will 
deliberately settle its accounts with the Palestinian opposition 
wherever it is present, including Jordan, so the opposition in 
Gaza and Jericho would not be able to undermine Fatah's 
authority, paralyze its capabilities, or upset it. 
  We wish that a constructive democratic dialogue would have 
been initiated between the Palestinian leadership and its 
supporters on the one hand and all opposition factions and 
forces on the other in order to close the Palestinian ranks and 
unify the Palestinian position. Conflicts and settling of 
accounts by force and violence will weaken the Palestinian 
position and undermine the security and stability of the hosting 
states. When the spark of violence is triggered, it will not be 
easy to put it out or circumvent its repercussions.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Acid Test of Sanctions"] </F>
  [Text] Contrary to some interpretatons that try to portray 
Jordan's linking of its resumption of the peace talks to ending 
the siege against al-'Aqabah as political posturing, the Kingdom 
will prove that it means business when it comes to vital 
national interests. An upcoming multilateral meeting in the 
Hague on the environment will not be boycotted. Instead Jordan 
will be sending a junior diplomat to the meeting in a gesture 
that is meant to send a double message to the international 
community: The Kingdom is committed to the peace process; yet 
it will not accept to be taken for granted when a national 
interest is at stake. Jordan will thus attend the meeting to 
prove that we will go all the way to advance the cause of peace 
in the region. But by doing so, at a minimum level of 
representation, we intend to drive the point home that unless 
our legitimate rights and concerns are properly addressed, we 
will have to do what is necessary in the future to protect this 
country and its people. 
  All through its history, Jordan has demonstrated its genuine 
interest in bringing about a just and lasting peace to the 
region. In the words of many American officials, Jordan has been 
an oasis of moderation in the area. The Kingdom never played 
the spoiler game. it is not about to start that now. The 
warning that the unfair and unjustifiable siege against 
al-'Aqabah should end was a call prompted by the country's real 
need to have that done right away. 
  For years, the Kingdom has been applying quiet diplomacy to 
have its concerns dealt with. But little attention did the 
decision-makers in Washington and the United Nations give to the 
country's requests, it seems. When Jordan exhausted all 
possible channels without receiving a positive answer, it 
resorted to the only option left to it: Let the whole world 
know that it is no longer willing to have its rights violated at 
a time when it is meeting all its obligations under 
international law and norms. 
  The United States, which repeatedly said it "understood" 
Jordan's concern, was supposed last week to discuss means of 
enforcing the sanctions against Iraq without continuing to hurt 
the Kingdom. Yet that did not happen, apparently because the 
various U.S. government organs needed more time to study the 
matter, but more likely because the Clinton administration did 
not want to appear as bowing to pressure from a small country 
like ours. 
  The U.S. would be wrong to think Jordan is merely playing a 
political game over the issue of sanctions and their 
implications on our economy. We do not need to make political 
capital this way. Jordan wants a speedy solution and has gone 
out of its way to prove its goodwill, by sending a delegate to 
the Hague's meeting. Washington should reciprocate. Nobody 
doubts the ability of the U.S. to find a suitable way of 
enforcing the sanctions against Iraq without hurting Jordan if 
it wanted to. Otherwise, Jordan has at least to be compensated 
for all the economic losses sustained as a result of those 
sanctions. After all, the way the international community 
chooses to deal wth this problem will be an important indication 
of what it might do to bring about real peace in the region. If 
it is going to be an imposed, shaky peace, Jordan might not need 
it anyway.

<F P=106> ["Everyday" column by Tariq Masarwah: "Peace by Blockade and </F>
Impoverishment"] 
  [Text] In my opinion, the government should stay away from 
a session of Middle East multilateral talks set for 17 April in 
Muscat. 
  Washington seems bent on undercutting His Majesty King 
Husayn's courageous stand!! A meeting was supposed to have been 
held at the U.S. State Department last Thursday to review the 
Port of al-'Aqabah blockade, but was put off the day before, 
lest a lifting of the siege be preceived as a reaction to his 
majesty's position. 
  It seems very unlikely Washington will set a new date for 
the 
review before 17 April to make certain we will show up at the 
waters conference in Muscat. This is a challenge we must come 
to grips with, seeing that the U.S.-imposed blockade is to force 
us into a particular course of action advancing Israeli 
interests in relation to the peace process!! 
  The Port of al-'Aqabah blockade was not a UN decision; it 
was 
undertaken unilaterally by the United States. 
  The blockade has no connection with the UN Security Council 
sanctions imposed on Iraq. Both Turkey and Iran have seaports 
and both maintain more substantial economic ties than any such 
relations Jordan may have with Iraq. Why, then, does not the 
U.S. Navy inspect Turkish and Iranian ports? 
  In the matter of the blockade of the Port of al-'Aqabah, 
then, there is more at stake than ensuring Jordan's compliance 
with the Iraq sanctions resolution. At stake is a drive to 
impoverish us and force us to our knees and then incorporate us 
into Israel's strategic reach and transform us into a buffer 
between the Zionist entity and each of Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon 
and an extension of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho! 
  In any case, the so-called multilaterals do not seem to be 
getting anywhere. With Syria and Lebanon not putting in an 
appearance at talks supposedly tackling such issues as the 
environment and waters, what is there to talk about? 
  These talks are zero; they are little more than symposiums 
comparable to many gatherings held at Amman hotels. There does 
not seem to be much point in the multilaterals beyond the fact 
that they are convened in Arab capitals. The idea behind them, 
then, is to serve as gateways for Israeli teams and television 
crews, no matter how much we or our kinsfolk in the West Bank 
and Gaza may resent it. 
  Initially, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland were chosen as 
venues for the multilateral sessions. Israel demanded that they 
be held in Cyprus. Washington, however, decided that they 
should be hosted by Arab capitals. 
  Why do we attend such talks at all? Is it because Washington 
wants us to? If that is so, what about our national and 
pan-Arab interests? And, why should we oblige Washington while 
it points a gun at our head? 
  We call on the government to take its cue from his majesty 
the king. If the blockade is not lifted by 17 April, we should 
not send a delegation to Muscat. We will not go along with a 
peace settlement that sets out to impoverish us. Are we 
supposed to become as impoverished as the West bank and Gaza 
strip population before we become eligible for peace?

<F P=106> [Interview with His Eminence Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi </F>
Shams-al-Din, chairman of the Higher Islamic Shiite Council in 
Lebanon, by Kamal Tarabayh on 2 April; place not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Tarabayh] Your Eminence Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi 
Shams-al-Din: During the Friday sermon you delivered yesterday, 
you made clear your support for the measures the government has 
taken, particularly with regard to the media issue. You said: 
Freedom should not give rise to chaos. At the same time, it 
should not result in repression or exclusion. My question is 
the following: More than 10 days have passed since private radio 
and television stations were banned from airing political news. 
Since then, a cabinet session was held. However, a new media 
bill has not been endorsed, as was previously announced. Your 
Eminence, why do you think that this situation is not tantamount 
to repression and exclusion, a development that shows a 
violation of the law? 
  [Shams-al-Din] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. As you have said, I addressed this issue in my 
Friday sermon yesterday. My support for the decisions made by 
the Council of Ministers last week was couched in general terms. 
I did not specifically address the decision made regarding the 
media. Last week, we supported the government's decisions. We 
said that we could understand the decision that was made with 
regard to private media, and that we would wait until the 
following week to see what the government would do with regard 
to the media bill. The deadline announced for examining the 
media bill has elapsed without any discussion of this bill. 
That is why I raised the issue yesterday. I said I saw the 
delay as an unfavorable development. I added that efforts to 
endorse the bill must be expedited so that the current 
suspension of the private media may be remedied. It is also 
necessary to correct the previous status of the private media, 
namely, their illegal operation. Also, outside the context of 
this sermon, I have informed officials that they must expedite 
efforts to endorse the media bill so that the suspension does 
not become permanent and effectively turn into a law. We do not 
want the suspension to be prolonged. Last week, we said frankly 
that we do not at all agree to a monopoly of media activities by 
the official media, underscoring the fact that citizens have the 
right to listen to various viewpoints with regard to what is 
taking place. Hence, I do not agree with the view that the 
current situation is one of repression. Nonetheless, I do not 
at all advise that the current status be prolonged. We are 
closely following the situation to expedite the referral of the 
media bill to the Chamber of Deputies. We are also urging the 
Chamber of Deputies to quickly endorse this bill, God willing. 
  [Tarabayh] Your Eminence the Shaykh, have you received any 
assurances from officials regarding a desire to speed up the 
promulgation of a media law? 
  [Shams-al-Din] I have had no direct assurances. However, I 
know that the government wants to get it over with. 
  [Tarabayh] Your Eminence Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, 
I want to shift to another topic. In his Easter address, His 
Beatitude Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Sfayr said the state has 
not treated all people equally, nor has it made the Christians 
feel that it is embracing them like other citizens. Do you 
subscribe to the idea that there is some defect in the way the 
state has been treating a part of the sons of the homeland? 
  [Shams-al-Din] I deeply regret, an I am saddened by, what 
has happened. I do not agree with the ideas presented by His 
Beatitude Patriarch Sfayr in his sermon yesterday. I do not 
approve of the content. We spoke last week with his beatitude 
about the form as well. First of all, to say that the state 
does not embrace Christians is not justified, as far as I am 
concerned. As for the justifications advanced by his beatitude 
the patriarch, he knows more about these. We will get in touch 
with him to discuss this view the way it was presented in 
yesterday's sermon. We think that the state looks after 
citizens equally. If some individuals or groups do not feel 
they are being looked after properly, maybe they themselves are 
responsible for this and not the state. I am not implying that 
the state is infallible and cannot make mistakes. Doubtless, 
there are mistakes committed by the state as a whole or by its 
institutions. However, these mistakes do not reach the degree 
espoused by his beatitude the patriarch. Therefore, I hope -- 
and I have repeatedly said this publicly and secretly -- that 
disputable issues will be presented in a way that contributes to 
unifying positions and helping the state assume its 
responsibilities and avoid making mistakes. 
  [Shams-al-Din] We respect his beatitude the patriarch. His 
voice is one of the pure and sincere voices. However, only God 
is infallible. We wanted to hear from him what I appealed for 
him to give -- a speech of hope and confidence. As everybody 
knows, I am personally concerned about the Christian citizens, 
who are also my fellow men. We have a responsibility toward all 
citizens. I am not responsible for the Muslim citizens more 
than the Christian citizens. I am responsible for the Muslim 
citizens in terms of religion more than the Christians. On the 
political level and in terms of citizens' rights, I reiterate 
that I am also responsible for the Christians. I hope that all 
Lebanese in high positions feel the same. His beatitude the 
patriarch should also be responsible for the Muslim citizens as 
he is responsible for the Christian citizens. 
  [Tarabayh] Your eminence, my last question is the following: 
Is it possible to see your voices -- as leaders of the spiritual 
communities in Lebanon -- united and unifying the ranks through 
a religious summit, for example? 
  [Shams-al-Din] This is my objective. I believe that the 
existing situation requires the convening of such a spiritual 
summit. This issue has been my main concern for the past two 
days. I will make some moves in this direction in this week, 
because the present situation requires such a meeting even 
though relations with the other brothers are continuous. We 
always exchange opinions and we are in continuous contact. I 
spoke with the patriarch two days ago. I am thinking seriously 
about convening a spiritual summit. 
  [Tarabayh] Your Eminence Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, 
thank you. 
  [Shams-al-Din] May God preserve you all.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz by a panel of </F>
AL-AHRAM writers in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] The discussion began with writer Muhammad 
Salmawi greeting the Lebanese foreign minister. Salmawi 
wondered about the developments in that long-suffering fraternal 
country and said that we all wonder if an end to Lebanon's 
ordeal is in sight. Writer Lutfi al-Khuli then mentioned that 
we need to learn more about the events in Lebanon since the 
church bombing. 
  [Buwayz] Thank you, everyone. I think that the bombing of 
Sayyidat al-Najat Church, which came on the heels of the 
explosion in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, was aimed at diverting 
attention from the latter explosion and rechanneling the 
attention of the international media. Another goal of the 
church bombing was to provoke the locals and lead them into 
thinking that the bombing was the doing of the resistance. A 
third motive was to incite Christians into demanding a change in 
the relations between Lebanon and Syria. I think that these 
were the motives behind the church bombing. It was a 
provocative and conspiratorial act. 
  Immediately after the investigations began it became clear 
that the above impressions were justified. I arrived at the 
scene just 20 minutes after the explosion, which occurred in my 
home town and electoral district. What I told you before were 
my first impressions, and they were vindicated. A number of 
individuals were arrested and they later confessed that they had 
links with Israeli officers. They admitted to having met 
Israeli officers in the border strip and to have received the 
information, instructions, money, and equipment for carrying out 
the bombing. Clearly, this was an attempt to disrupt the 
situation in Lebanon. This is hardly a secret anymore. 
  I recall remarks made by the head of the Israeli negotiating 
delegation to the effect that Israel finds the security equation 
in Lebanon unacceptable, particularly the presence of the 
resistance in the south, and will try to change it. About ten 
days ago, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that Israel 
cannot reach an understanding with Lebanon unless the current 
relations between Lebanon and Syria change. 
  Therefore, it is clear that what is happening is an attempt 
to change a number of domestic equations in order to promote 
certain political interests. True, the Lebanese were known 
during the war to be susceptible to infighting and to foreign 
plots and intervention, but this time the country's reaction was 
very mature. As a result, the bombing failed to create a 
factional division or spark sectarian strife. 
  The nation was almost unanimous that unity should be 
maintained. The public was aware that those who perpetrated this 
atrocity wanted to revive internal strife here. I believe that 
the nation has passed that test in good form, helped to no small 
extent by the progress in the investigations. I am a lawyer and 
therefore cannot prejudge things, but it seems that the evidence 
gathered in the case and the statements of the detainees have 
pieced together a clear picture. [passage omitted] 
  [Dr. Halah Mustafa] My question concerns the future 
political impact of Hizballah's presence in Lebanon. It has two 
parts: First, what effect will Hizballah's armed operations in 
the south have on the future of the peace process, specifically 
the Lebanese-Israeli peace process? Second, what is the nature 
of Hizballah's relations with the legitimate authorities in 
Lebanon? Because, given its ideological and political structure 
and its well known regional links, Hizballah may pose a real 
challenge to the authorities in the post-peace agreement era. 
Will the authorities in Lebanon be able to control this party 
in the future? 
  [Buwayz] In Lebanon Hizballah is part of the resistance. In 
fact, this party was established on the basis of certain 
commitments. Despite its ideological premises based on applying 
the Islamic shar'iah, Hizballah realizes that it is impossible 
to achieve its goal in Lebanon as long as Lebanon is a unified 
country. Thus, Hizballah's ideology takes the Lebanese situation 
into account and perhaps it is trying not to aggravate this 
situation as long as they need Lebanon to remain a unified 
homeland for all its sons and sects. Hizballah cannot impose 
its own interests on other sects. Regarding the second part of 
the question, I believe it is wrong to say that resistance 
should stop before guarantees are obtained on the return of 
southern Lebanon, because the resistance is not the reason for 
the occupation. The resistance emerged as a result of the 
Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon and not vice versa. There 
would not have been any resistance had it not been for the 
occupation of part of Lebanon. The crux of the issue is the 
resistance, which was founded on a clear and just basis--that 
is, Israel's occupation of one-tenth of Lebanese territory, 
apart from its daily actions and arrests. It seems that no one 
wants to know that there are 400 Lebanese detainees in Israeli 
jails who have not been visited by any international 
organization. 
  The resistance is sometimes a manifestation of international 
impotence. The Lebanese Government is being asked to restrict 
or abolish the resistance; Israel constantly requests this. We 
say: How can the state abolish the resistance when it has no 
guarantees? This means that the Lebanese Government is being 
asked to become a suburb of the Israeli occupation. This might 
trigger a permanent civil war in Lebanon between those who 
believe that resistance is a legitimate right as long as 
Lebanese territory is occupied and those who want to end the 
resistance. Therefore the Lebanese Government will not enter 
into internal strife over this issue. The Lebanese Government's 
stand is that since Israel maintains that it has no designs on a 
single inch of Lebanese territory or one cubic meter of Lebanese 
water, a joint military committee can be formed to discuss a 
timetable for withdrawal as well as all security requirements in 
the south. This committee could also discuss hopes for the 
future. The Government could then say that there is a plan to 
liberate the south and that the resistance is preventing 
liberation. The resistance would then look like a hindrance to 
liberation instead of the only means of liberation. Israel 
continues to ask us why we do not commit ourselves to ending the 
resistance. We are not saying that we will not agree to take 
control of the security situation in the south until the last 
Israeli soldier withdraws. In stage two, a joint security 
committee could decide to link withdrawal to the establishment 
of security and stability. The Government will then be 
responsible for any violation originating on Lebanese territory. 
Certainly the resistance is not a military problem for Lebanon. 
For the Lebanese state, the resistance is a political issue. 
When the political side of this problem is solved, there will 
be no problem. [passage omitted] 
  [Ahmad Nafi'] It was noticed that the issue of deploying 
the Army in the south was raised during U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's visit to Lebanon to speed up the resumption 
of the peace negotiations. Talk about this issue then stopped. 
It is being said that there is still a plan for the Army's 
deployment in the south. What effect would this have on 
speeding up the implementation of Resolution 425? 
  [Buwayz] There is a fundamental point that we did not touch 
on when we spoke about the al-Ta'if accord and its achievements. 
The al-Ta'if accord allowed the state to build up the 
establishments. The Lebanese Army numbered no more than 10,000 
soldiers and its armament was very weak when the civil war 
ended. The army now has around 40,000 soldiers and we can say 
that it is now a respectable force. Overall the Armed Forces 
now number 70,000 if we include the internal security forces and 
some other organs. 
  One of the achievements of the al-Ta'if accord is that it 
allowed Lebanon to rebuild its institutions. All the militias 
have been dissolved. Everyone recognizes that this is not a 
military problem, but a political one. Looked at from this 
angle, the Army's deployment in the south has dispelled the 
fears. It is not a military problem but a political one. 
  [Muhammad Salmawi] Has a decision been made in Lebanon to 
concede the resistance card? 
  [Buwayz] The consequences of making a premature decision and 
the absence of Israeli guarantees would create an internal 
problem, and perhaps even a civil war in Lebanon between the 
resistance's supporters and opponents. The state has not looked 
at this issue yet. What we are saying now is that the cabinet 
has decided to order the Army to deploy on all the Lebanese 
territory. But the deployment so far is limited to part of 
Beirut and other areas -- that is, to around 65 percent of 
Lebanon's territory. Four days ago, the Cabinet expanded the 
Army's deployment. This means that the internal security 
situation will be under full control. But the decision does not 
mean stopping the resistance. 
  [Amin Muhammad Amin] There is supposedly a link between the 
Syrian peace track and the Syrian presence in Lebanon. Does 
such a link in fact exist or is this a mere Israeli assertion? 
  [Buwayz] There is a real and known link, but this linkage is 
Israel's and is not new. This linkage was first made after the 
17 May 1985 agreement when the Lebanese negotiator had 
negotiated at length with the Israeli side. When they broached 
the issue of withdrawal from the south, the Israelis linked all 
these terms to Syria's approval and blessing of the agreement. 
That was not the first time that Israel had made the linkage. 
I will explain how Israel concocts the linkage. We tell 
Israel: UN Resolution 425 has been passed, so please implement 
it. In return, the Lebanese Government will pledge to impose 
full security and stability on both sides of the border. This 
resolution has nothing to do with regional developments and is 
independent of a peace agreement. This resolution demands 
Israel's withdrawal and says that the Lebanese state is 
responsible for security and stability. It is an independent 
resolution. We are and remain Arabs. So what is the Israeli 
reply? They say that Israel will withdraw only after the 
signing of a peace agreement with Lebanon, the peace agreement 
that involves recognition and relations. It says: To implement 
Resolution 425, the Lebanese state first has to impose security 
and stability. We will sign a peace with you when all the Arab 
problems are resolved and agreement is reached with the 
Palestinians, Syrians, and Jordanians. A separate peace 
agreement with Lebanon is impossible as long as this conflict is 
a comprehensive Arab effort and as long as this peace and its 
establishment can only be built on the general principles of the 
peace process. We say that Israel must withdraw in 
implementation of Resolution 425; and when progress is made with 
the Palestinians, Syrians, and Jordanians, we will, in 
solidarity with them, sign a full peace agreement with Israel. 
As you can see, it is Israel who links the situation in the 
south to the overall situation in the region and to the Syrian 
track in particular. 
  There is no link between Syria's presence and Israeli's. We 
believe the Syrian Army's presence in Lebanon to be necessary 
for a while to help the state rebuild its institutions and 
impose security and stability. We regard the Israeli Army's 
presence as an occupation that is opposed by all Lebanese. We 
needed the presence of an army at one stage but this need is 
decreasing daily since we have rebuilt our institutions, but 
there is an occupation that is creating a political crisis, an 
occupation in the full sense of the word. As far as we are 
concerned, this occupation is illegal. Politically and 
regionally, when Israel withdraws from the south, then there 
might be no justification for the presence of any foreign army 
in Lebanon, depending on the political and psychological 
conditions. 
  Legally, of course, we refuse to equate these two presences.

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Syria: Christopher Should </F>
Remedy Situation Before Proceeding to the Region"] 
  [Excerpt] Damascus -- Responsible sources in Damascus have 
told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Syrian leadership is waiting to 
see what U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will bring 
with him on his trip to the region in the near future. The 
sources said that Syria has expressed willingness to return to 
the Arab-Israeli negotiating table and that there is serious 
coordination with the Arab states concerned with these 
negotiations. The foreign ministers of these states are 
expected to hold a coordination meeting after Christopher's 
visit to Damascus to set a date for the resumption of the 
negotiations in Washington. 
  The Syrian sources added that the UN Security Council's 
recent resolution on the Hebron massacre offered a reasonable 
impetus for the resumption of the Washington negotiations, 
provided the Arab states involved in the peace negotiations get 
new U.S. assurances of Israeli commitment to the basis of peace, 
for only that can spare the peace process the difficult 
possibilities. 
  The responsible sources added that Israel is still adopting 
its same known position on the peace process, rejecting the 
basis, trying to prevent fulfillment of the peace requirements, 
seeking to keep the peace process at point zero, and placing 
obstacles in the way of any U.S. or international efforts to 
reactivate the process and ensure progress. 
  The sources also said: In anticipation of any U.S. move to 
iron out obstacles standing in the way of the peace process, 
Israel always makes provocative statements or creates explosive 
situations in order to contain such a move and prevent it from 
achieving its objective of boosting the peace process and 
driving it toward a just and comprehensive peace. 
  The Syrian sources added that Israel is now repeating the 
same practices before Christopher comes to the region, pursuing 
a calculated escalation of its policy of aggression and 
repression in southern Lebanon and in the occupied Arab 
territories, demonstrating more Israeli intransigence in the 
face of any constructive proposals the U.S. secretary of state 
might carry with him to the region with a view to extricating 
the peace process from the vicious circle it was thrown into by 
Israel through its intransigence. 
  The sources pointed out that the United States is requested 
to act firmly and to throw all its weight behind the peace 
process and to put the necessary pressure on Israel to compel it 
to change its anti-peace policy and commit it to the principles 
and basis of the peace process as specified in the Madrid 
formula and in the UN resolutions, particularly the 
land-for-peace principle. 
  The Syrian sources expressed the fear that the peace process 
might be in danger of collapse if the current Israeli policy 
continues, and that is why Syria believes that it is now 
Washington's responsibility to rescue the process by taking a 
firm stand based on committing Israel to full withdrawal and 
full recognition of Palestinian rights to prevent the peace 
process from moving toward the point of complete failure and the 
point of no return. Washington should remedy this situation 
before its foreign secretary goes to the region because the 
positions of the Arab states are clear and there are no problems 
for the U.S. secretary to discuss with them. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Elias Tohme] </F>
  [Text] Damascus, April 6 (AFP)--President Hafiz al-Asad has 
criticised the United States for bowing to Israeli pressure in 
the Middle East peace process, a Syrian official said Wednesday. 
  Al-Asad accused US President Bill Clinton of going back on 
what was agreed during their summit in Geneva on January 16, the 
official said, asking not to be named. 
  "The Geneva summit brought us hope that we could advance the 
peace process," he said. 
  "But nothing has been done because of Israeli intransigence 
and the Zionist lobby which is preventing the United States from 
playing an effective role," he added. 
  Al-Asad voiced the criticism during a meeting with Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak in Cairo on Tuesday, warning the peace 
process was in crisis "because of irresponsible Israeli 
positions," the official said. 
  After the talks Mubarak called on all parties in the stalled 
Arab-Israeli talks to "show flexibility" and said he hoped the 
negotiations would resume at the end of April in Washington. 
  Syria maintains there has been no progress following talks 
between Syrian and Israeli leaders in January and February in 
Washington because the United States did not put any pressure on 
Israel. 
  A foreign ministry spokesman said: "Syria committed itself 
to the peace process in the hope that the US administration 
would keep to its promises and play its role as an honest 
partner. 
  "But that role has never been put into action on the 
ground," 
he said, adding Syria would not give into blackmail. 
  Damascus has accused Washington of blackmailing it by 
refusing to remove Syria from a list of countries known to be 
sources for drug- traffickers. 
  Damascus said it had made considerable efforts to end drug- 
trafficking, particularly in Lebanon's al-Biqa' valley, but the 
US decision means Syria will be unable to receive certain aid 
handouts. 
  Meanwhile, in Washington senior Israeli Labor Party official 
Nissim Zvili said the US administration backed Syria's call for 
a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. 
  "They (the United States) completely support Syria on the 
sovereignty issue. It is not easy for us," he said, adding 
Israel was not ready to trade the plateau for peace. 
  President Bill Clinton's administration has sought to 
mediate 
differences between the two sides over the strategic land seized 
by Israel in the Middle East war in 1967.

  [Text] A Syrian information source has said that the Syrian 
president's talks in Cairo dealt mainly with the peace process, 
which is now undergoing a veritable crisis as a result of the 
lack of seriousness in the Israeli government's stands. 
  The source said that, in addition to Syria's criticism of 
Israel, Damascus blames Washington for its stands. which 
contradict peace, contrary to what was agreed on during 
al-Asad-Clinton summit in Geneva last January. The Geneva 
summit revived hopes for promoting the Middle East peace process 
but no progress has been realized because of Israel's 
intransigence and the Zionist lobby's moves in the United States 
to hamper any effective and pressuring U.S. role. Syria is also 
of the opinion that the Syrian-Israeli negotiations in 
Washington last January and February on the level of delegation 
heads ended without any results worth mentioning because 
Washington did not bring pressure to bear on Israel. 
  Syria also blames Washington for its failure to denounce 
Israel after the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, for preventing the 
Security Council from adopting a resolution on this issue for 
three weeks, and for the reported pledge by President Clinton to 
the Zionist organizations upholding unified Jerusalem as capital 
of the Hebrew state, contrary to UN Security Council Resolution 
242 and the policies of the previous U.S. administrations, which 
refused to recognize the annexation of Arab Jerusalem and 
insisted on considering it part of the occupied territories. 
  Damascus is equally displeased with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's announcement on his readiness to visit the 
region but without exercising any pressure on Israel. Moreover, 
the United States insisted on keeping Syria on the list of 
states that did not cooperate with it in the field of combating 
drugs. 
  Asserting that, with all these moves, the U.S. 
Administration 
aims to deny Syria any Economic assistance, the Syrian 
information source reiterated that his country had neither asked 
nor obtained any such assistance in the past, and that it joined 
the peace process hoping that Washington would fulfill its 
pledges and play the role of a full, fair, and just partner. 
This role has not materialized, however, into tangible results 
yet, the source said.

  [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad has turned down an Iranian invitation to 
visit Tehran later this month to discuss the Middle East peace 
process. 
  Sources in Tehran said yesterday that the invitation came in 
a written message from "Supreme Leader" 'Ali Khamene'i delivered 
to al-Asad in Damascus by Iranian Majles Deputy Speaker Hasan 
Ruhani. 
  Iranian media had reported that President al-Asad would 
visit 
Tehran this April to discuss "a new strategy for the Middle 
East" with Khamene'i and his aides. But sources in Tehran said 
yesterday that al-Asad accepted the invitation without setting a 
date for it. Ruhani, who is also secretary general of the 
Iranian National Security Council, also delivered a message from 
President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. Khamene'i had openly 
urged Syria to withdraw from the "American peace process" and 
support the Palestinian factions which pledged to torpedo any 
agreement with Israel. 
  While in Damascus, Ruhani received a number of Palestinian 
radical leaders including Ahmad Jibril, Fathi Shaqaqi, and 
Colonel Abu-Musa [Sa'id Musa]. He invited George Habash and 
Nayif Hawatimah to meet with him but they sent representatives. 
  Ruhani, who is considered to be a member of the small circle 
of mullahs at the center of power in Tehran, also met with 
leaders of Lebanon's Hizballah. 
  The Iranian sources say that he asked the Hizballah leaders 
to persuade the Shiite leaders in Lebanon to accept Khamene'i as 
the highest Shiite authority. Senior Shiite leaders in Lebanon, 
including Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah and Muhammad Mahdi 
Shams-al-Din had expressed support for 'Ali Mohammad Sistani, 
the Iranian mullah living in al-Najaf in Iraq. 
  Some reports indicate that the Palestinian radical groups 
have expressed displeasure with Iran for failing so far to 
provide the massive aid it had promised at a special conference 
held in Tehran in February 1993. 
  Iranian sources attribute the delay in providing aid for 
these groups to Tehran's cash flow problems, but in a recent 
speech Khamene'i reaffirmed his government's commitment "to aid 
the Palestinian struggle" against the PLO-Israel agreement. 
  Tehran analysts believe that the summit meeting between 
Presidents al-Asad and Bill Clinton in Geneva last January was a 
turning point of historic importance in relations between 
Washington and Damascus. One of the results of that meeting is 
perhaps Damascus's clear attempts to gradually distance itself 
from Tehran's radical policies, according to the analysts.

Reaffirms Support for Palestinian Opposition Factions"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- An Iranian Majles delegation headed by 
Deputy Speaker Hasan Ruhani has started talks in Damascus with 
Syrian People's Assembly and other senior Syrian officials. 
  In Damascus yesterday, a highly placed Iranian official 
reaffirmed Tehran's support for the 10 Palestinian factions 
opposed to the PLO-Israel Gaza-Jericho autonomy agreement. 
  A Palestinian spokesman said that Iranian Deputy Majles 
Speaker Hasan Ruhani emphasized that position when he met with 
the leaders of the 10 factions at the Iranian Embassy in 
Damascus yesterday. 
  The spokesman said that the talks covered the situation in 
the region after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and that the 
Iranian official reaffirmed his country's support for the 
Palestinian intifadah against the Israeli forces in the West 
Bank and the Gaza Strip. He added that the discussions also 
covered means and ways of providing aid for the intifadah and 
the 10 factions. 
  Ruhani, who leads a high-ranking delegation, told reporters 
on his arrival in Damascus the day before yesterday that he was 
carrying two messages for Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad from 
'Ali Khamene'i and President Hashemi-Rafsanjani on the issues of 
peace, the Gulf region, and bilateral relations between the two 
countries. 
  Some observers in Damascus believe that the two messages 
also 
deal with President al-Asad's forthcoming visit to Tehran 
scheduled to take place in the second half of this month.

Serb forces have advanced 10 km in the area, but UN officials 
still say that Gorazde is not facing a serious threat. 
  Meanwhile, the Islamic Republic of Iran has called for 
speedy 
action by the United Nations to prevent the fall of Gorazde and 
the massacre of its innocent inhabitants. In a letter to the 
United Nations, our country's foreign affairs minister has also 
made reference to the fact that Gorazde was earlier declared a 
safe area. The letter, furthermore, cautions against the 
occurrence of yet another tragedy in Bosnia. 
  The Islamic countries have also started a series of 
diplomatic initiatives in the United Nations with the aim of 
inducing the Security Council to pass a resolution to prevent 
the fall of Gorazde.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Velayati by unidentified </F>
correspondent upon Velayati's return on 6 April from visiting 
African countries--recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Please tell us what issues you 
discussed and what agreements you reached during your tour of 
some African countries? 
  [Velayati] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. Before the revolution, the regime did not pay much 
attention to ties with Africa in its foreign policy. After the 
revolution, for various reasons, that attention was considerably 
increased. There was first the expansion of diplomatic ties. 
The next step was the expansion of cultural, economic, 
commercial, and industrial ties. By the expansion of industrial 
ties, I mean those countries are eager to use Iran's industrial 
goods. During that period there were very good examples of 
cooperation with those countries in that field. The inception 
of temporary or permanent trade and industrial exhibitions in 
some countries was one of the first steps taken and was very 
successful in those countries. 
  One of the main reasons for the extraordinary welcome by all 
the African countries in which we opened exhibitions is that not 
many countries can compete with Iranian prices, while the 
quality of our goods is relatively high, particularly the 
quality of goods offered there. In some commercial and economic 
fields, the private sector could definitely be more active, and 
in some other fields the public sector. Without exception all 
the African countries we visited asked for the expansion of 
economic and commercial cooperation. 
  [Correspondent] To what extent could cooperation with Africa 
help our presence on the international scene? 
  [Velayati] Because of the end of the cold war, some Western 
countries are today interfering more blatantly in the internal 
affairs of Third World countries, particularly African 
countries, without any consideration for their endemic 
characteristics. They have disturbed the situation in some 
African countries. The people of Africa are wise to this and, 
therefore, seek cooperation with countries that have 
particularly more influence on the international scene. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you very much. 
  [Velayati] Thank you.

  [Text] Iran and Italy have signed a long-term financial 
agreement and have thus ended their differences in this field. 
The Central News Unit reports that on the basis of this 
financial agreement, which was signed by a delegation of the 
Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Italian 
financial officials and the state Italian insurance organization 
(SACE), an $800-million credit has been placed at the disposal 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  On the basis of this agreement, all debts by state and 
private companies and by Iranian importers to their Italian 
trade partners that have not been paid up until now will be paid 
by this credit. All the debts of 1373 [year beginning 21 March 
1994] that will mature within the coming months will also be 
paid by this credit. The credit covers all purchases that are 
covered by the Italian state insurance company (SACE). The 
credit is for a period of six years, comprising two years of a 
grace period and four years of repayment. 
  The Central Bank has previously signed similar financial 
agreements with Germany, Japan, Switzerland, Austria, and Poland.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gilbert 
Monday [4 April] contended that the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Nigeria, Burma, and Syria are either collaborating in drug 
trafficking or are not taking preventive steps in this regard. 
  Of course this is not the first time that Washington has 
levelled such charges in an attempt to counter the independent 
policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In the past, too, 
propaganda tactics such as production of nuclear weapons, aiding 
international terrorism, and violation of human rights have been 
repeated time and again. 
  Apparently, the U.S. State Department has asserted a new 
charge on account of the earlier subjects getting old. This 
subject alleges that Iran has not helped prevent the drug 
trafficking destined for Europe and America. The charge is 
being levelled at a time when numerous reports have already been 
released by international agencies on the successful campaign 
launched by the Islamic Republic of Iran against production and 
sale of drugs. Included among them are the recent comments of 
Mr. George Canary, executive director of the UN drug control 
program stationed in Vienna. He has declared that Iran is 
making fervent efforts to combat drug trafficking. Also mention 
can be made of the recent report of the international department 
for drug control, whose officials toured the bordering areas of 
Iran and Pakistan. The report, which has been released as an 
official document of the United Nations, has said: Even though 
Iran is not at the highest level in terms of per capita 
investment on drug control, it is very close to this point. The 
report also stresses that the Islamic Republic of Iran is 
actively carrying out an anti-drug campaign on regional and 
international level. 
  It should be mentioned that Islamic Iran, which is itself a 
victim of the attacks by the drug traffickers, has launched 
widescale efforts to combat the merchants of death during the 
past years, and tens of thousands of its security forces have 
laid down their lives in fighting the drug traffickers who try 
to smuggle narcotics from Pakistan and Afghanistan to Europe and 
the United States. 
  Official figures indicate that the amount of narcotics 
seized 
in 1979 stood at 11,000 tonnes, whereas in 1992 it reached 
66,000 tonnes, which reflects a remarkable success. More 
interesting is the fact that when the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
in order to uproot the drug trafficking, brings to the gallows 
the drug lords who have been involved in the trade for years, 
the U.S. Administration and its allies condemn Iran for 
violating the human rights. 
  In the end, one can only say that in this connection 
Washington's political scandals are so clear that there is 
hardly any need for a further look at its performance. It would 
suffice to remind that it is the United States where the heroin 
manufacturing plant makers are living, and where the big drug 
barons are based with their widescale resources.

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has 
categorically stated that Pakistan will not roll back its 
nuclear program. Addressing a news conference in the Parliament 
House in Islamabad this morning, she said this is a firm 
commitment of her government with the people of Pakistan. She 
said Pakistan will not open its nuclear facilities for 
inspection unilaterally as this would be discriminatory and 
against the wishes of the Pakistani nation. Ms. Benazir Bhutto 
emphasized that there should be an even-handed approach by the 
United States on the problem of nuclear nonproliferation, arms 
race, and missiles race, but these are to be resolved in South 
Asian subcontinent. Pakistan has given several positive 
proposals for nuclear nonproliferation in South Asia, but these 
have been rejected by India. 
  The prime minister said Pakistan wanted to improve bilateral 
relations with the United States not for acquisition of F-16 
aircraft or for arms purchases, but because Pakistan and the 
United States have a history of old friendship. She said the 
United States is now the only superpower and so it has a role to 
play in the solution of the Kashmir problem. Referring to the 
U.S. deputy secretary of state's forthcoming visit to Pakistan, 
Ms. Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan will inform Mr. Strobe Talbott 
that it believes in nonproliferation in South Asia, but there 
should a regional approach to it. 
  She also urged the opposition to give up its negative 
attitude of confrontation and join hands with the government on 
the sensitive issues of national importance like nuclear and 
Kashmir.

  [Text] Pakistan has refuted press reports as totally 
baseless suggesting that the United States has proposed to 
Islamabad to freeze the Kashmir issue. A Foreign Office 
spokesman briefing newsmen in Islamabad today said Pakistan has 
received neither any paper nor any nonpaper on this subject. 
[sentence as heard] 
  To a question, the spokesman said Pakistan resents deeply 
the 
proliferation of false and defamatory statements from India 
alleging the involvement of Pakistan's Inter Service 
Intelligence in the internal affairs of India and other 
neighboring states. He said Pakistan Government rejects 
categorically statements made in this connection by the chief 
minister of Assam, director general of its police, and the 
article in the Indian newspaper THE INDEPENDENT. 
  To another question, the spokesman said the entire spectrum 
of Pakistan-U.S. relations would come under review during the 
three-day visit of the U.S. deputy secretary of state, Mr. 
Strobe Talbott, beginning from Friday [8 April]. The spokesman 
said the agenda of talks is very broad and we are prepared to 
discuss all the issues faced.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Danger of a Nuclear War in the </F>
Subcontinent -- the Need To Resolve the Kashmir Issue"] 
  [Text] Commenting on the visit of Strobe Talbott, the U.S. 
deputy secretary of state, to the Indian subcontinent beginning 
6 April, Voice of America [VOA] has said that the danger of the 
outbreak of a nuclear war during the next few years is nowhere 
in the world so great as in Asia. In view of this apprehension, 
Talbott will exert pressure on Pakistan and India to end the 
race to manufacture nuclear weapons and missiles. The VOA 
commentary also expressed doubts about the success of Talbott's 
visit because no country in the subcontinent can instantly sign 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. They might not even 
be ready to have their nuclear installations inspected. This is 
why the United States anticipates a growing danger of a nuclear 
threat in the subcontinent. 
  The question is why the United States is not trying to find 
out the reasons behind this serious threat. It has become 
well-known throughout the world that India has repeatedly been 
threatening a limited war on the Kashmir issue and trying to 
establish a justification for it by alleging that Pakistan is 
"abetting terrorists." Two wars had already been fought in the 
subcontinent on Kashmir, and every time it was India which 
started the aggression. At first, in 1948 it captured the 
Muslim-majority state of Kashmir adjoining Pakistan by deviating 
from the predetermined agenda on the partition and independence 
of India. When this was resisted by the Kashmiris and Pakistan, 
then India went to the United Nations where the Security Council 
adopted a cease-fire resolution on the condition that the people 
of Kashmir would be given an opportunity to freely express their 
views on Kashmir's accession either to India or Pakistan. 
Although India had then accepted the resolution, for the last 
half a century it has been avoiding a plebiscite while claiming 
Kashmir is an integral part of India. 
  Four years ago, the Kashmiri people indigenously launched a 
crusade to get rid of the Indian yoke of slavery. India is 
awfully baffled by the success of this struggle and it is quite 
possible for her to embark on an onslaught against Pakistan 
anytime as she did in the past. India has equipped itself with 
the most modern, dangerous, and destructive weapons. It 
expanded its blue water navy exceeding its legitimate defense 
needs. It has been given the target of control in the Indian 
Ocean region. [sentence as published] It did not stop there. 
India turned itself into a nuclear power. It has been 
confirmed by CIA records that India possesses enough enriched 
uranium to produce 20 to 100 bombs. India's entire attention is 
now focused to the production of long-range missiles as carriers 
of nuclear warheads. It is conducting experiments in this 
regard. 
  The irony is that India has not accepted any global 
restriction on its nuclear program nor is it ready to sign the 
NPT. Pakistan has every right to do everything to ensure its 
defense. It can be said with full confidence that if India did 
not dare wage a war so far, it was because of Pakistan's nuclear 
program. Still, the Pakistani nuclear program is being made a 
target of criticism by the United States and anti-Islamic 
powers. The United States has even suspended economic and 
military aid to Pakistan so as to exert pressure. It is 
refusing to supply the F-16 planes to Pakistan although Pakistan 
has already paid for them. It is being proposed now that 
Pakistan will have to cap the nuclear program and sign the NPT 
in future. 
  Pakistani Army Chief General Abdul Waheed is currently 
visiting the United States. He has repeatedly made the position 
clear that Pakistan is always willing to abandon its nuclear 
program. It has repeatedly said that a solution to the nuclear 
issue should be found on a regional basis and India should also 
be included in the NPT so that at least a nuclear confrontation 
in the Indian subcontinent can be averted. However, India not 
only rejected the regional solution, it has also termed the NPT 
contrary to its national interests. In fact, it is not in 
Pakistan's interest either to sign the NPT without determining 
the balance of power between Pakistan and India and securing a 
guarantee for it. It is becoming more and more difficult for 
Pakistan to counter India with conventional weapons. And in this 
age, we cannot face India depending only on our faith in God, 
because our faith in God has also dwindled. 
  The fact is that so long as the Kashmir issue remains 
unresolved and a permanent peace agreement is not concluded 
simultaneously, there will always be a threat of aggression from 
India. Therefore, if the United States is interested, even 
slightly, in establishing peace in the subcontinent, then it 
becomes obligatory on the part of the United States to allow the 
Kashmiris an opportunity to express their views as provided by 
the Security Council resolutions. Obviously, at a time when the 
Kashmiris are engaged in a jihad against the Indian troops, 
their verdict will be in favor of accession to Pakistan. The 
key to the establishment of peace in the subcontinent lies in 
this verdict.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "New U.S. Proposals, Do Not Accept Pressures"] </F>
  [Text] In the past few days, it has become clear that the 
United States is considering various proposals to realize the 
goal of nuclear nonproliferation in South Asia. These proposals 
are being put forward to both Pakistan and India formally and 
informally. Although the exact nature of the proposals has not 
come up at the official level, it has been guessed from 
newspaper reports that their foremost aim is to do away with 
nuclear arms proliferation in South Asia. As Pakistan has made 
it clear that the nuclear program in the subcontinent is linked 
to the Kashmir issue, the United States has put forward some 
proposals to resolve the Kashmir dispute. According to the 
latest report, the United States has proposed to Pakistan that 
the Kashmir dispute be put on hold for some time. Meanwhile, a 
conference is to be held and attended by Pakistan, India, the 
United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China to 
discuss all the aspects of security in South Asia. The 
conference will propose a strategy that guarantees and becomes a 
source for stability for the South Asian subcontinent. The 
United States will expect from any such conference some strategy 
to prevent the proliferation of nuclear arms in the region. 
  If Pakistan has refused to accept this proposal, there are 
solid reasons behind it. First of all, it is not clear what the 
intention of putting the Kashmir issue in cold storage is and 
what the demands after the strategy is adopted would be. Will 
it mean that Pakistan should stop raising its voice against 
Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir? Likewise, will it mean 
that Pakistan should not raise the Kashmir issue at 
international fora? In other words, will it mean that Pakistan 
should stop its moral, diplomatic, and political support to the 
Kashmiris? It is obvious that this will be impossible and 
unthinkable to Pakistan. The American proposal also does not 
make it clear when the proposed conference will be held and the 
outcome of the deliberations emerge, and whether that outcome 
will be acceptable to Pakistan? Another strong objection to the 
proposal is that its basic aim is not to resolve the Kashmir 
issue, but to put forward a strategy that prevents the 
proliferation of nuclear arms and missiles in South Asia. In 
Pakistan's view, giving preference to this issue has the similar 
connotation of dangling a carrot before the horse. 
  The Kashmir issue is the root cause for all the problems and 
hardship in the South Asian subcontinent. As long as efforts 
are not taken to resolve the issue in accordance with the UN 
resolutions, no other problem can be resolved. If the Pakistan 
Government adopts a stance that the above U.S. proposal is 
impractical and unacceptable in the present context, it is fully 
understandable. We hope that the Pakistan Government will not 
bow to any kind of external pressure and will not take up as 
worthy of consideration proposals such as putting the Kashmir 
dispute on hold and initiating discussions on the Kashmir issue. 
Despite all the political differences between the opposition 
and the government, the entire nation and political circles are 
unanimous and united on Kashmir and on Pakistan's nuclear 
program. The government should never be cowed by any external 
pressure and should remain as firm as a rock on its principled 
stand. The entire nation is behind the government on this 
question and it need not have any anxiety over it, but it should 
make the country's policy clear to the external forces with more 
vigor and clarity.

  [Text] U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott 
arrived here this evening on a three-day visit. Talking to 
newsmen on his arrival, Mr. Talbott said the Clinton 
administration attach great significance to Indo-U.S. relations. 
He said India is important to them and Washington wants to 
ensure that relations with New Delhi expand and strengthen in 
the years to come. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Kamini Sawhny] India is Mr. 
Strobe Talbott's first destination abroad after taking over as 
America's deputy secretary of state. Mr. Talbott, who arrived 
in New Delhi this evening on the first leg of his overseas tour, 
is here on a three-day visit. The United States has been 
India's largest trading partner, and with the liberalization of 
the economy, the trade turnover between the two countries is 
expected to touch $7 billion this year. Indian exports to the 
U.S. were up by 20 percent last year, while about 40 percent of 
all investments approved by the government in the same year were 
from U.S. firms. So economic issues will probably be high on 
the agenda when Mr. Talbott, who is the highest ranking U.S. 
State Department official to visit India from the Clinton 
administration, meets with Indian officials tomorrow. 
  [Talbott] My government attaches considerable significance 
to 
my visit here. President Clinton and Secretary of State 
Christopher have asked me to come here in order to consult with 
Prime Minister Rao and other officials of the Indian Government 
on concrete ways in which we can give together new impetus and 
new scope to U.S.-Indian relations. 
  [Sawhny] Nonproliferation is also likely to be a key subject 
for discussion. According to reports, the U.S. proposal to hold 
a multilateral conference on nuclear nonproliferation and 
regional security in South Asia is likely to be conveyed to the 
government. The backbone of India's nuclear policy has been the 
Rajiv Gandhi action plan of 1988, which calls for a regime that 
is global and nondiscriminatory. Another related issue that 
India may take up is the proposal to supply 38 F-16 aircrafts to 
Pakistan as a one-time waiver of the Pressler Amendment. India 
feels that this will escalate the arms tension in the region. 
The post of U.S. ambassador in New Delhi, which continues to be 
vacant for over a year, will also figure in the talks. At the 
end of his visit here, Mr. Talbott is headed for Islamabad.

<F P=106> [Statement by unidentified official spokesman on the call by </F>
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe on Prime Minister P.V. 
Narasimha Rao and Home Minister S.B. Chavan on 4 April] 
  [Text] While briefing newsmen, the official spokesman 
stated that the French foreign minister, Mr. Alain Juppe, called 
on our prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, today morning. 
Both sides emphasized the traditional affinity between India 
and France. The French foreign minister stressed the need for 
increased economic cooperation in the light of economic reforms 
in India and said that it was their intention to attend the 
joint commission meeting at the ministerial level later this 
year. A visit by a French business delegation is also envisaged 
this year. 
  Our prime minister briefed Mr. Juppe on our relations with 
neighboring countries and underlined the challenge to our 
territorial integrity on account of Pakistan's interference and 
support to terrorism on Indian soil. The prime minister 
indicated that India was open to bilateral discussions with 
Pakistan. Mr. Juppe said that France opposed 
internationalization of the Kashmir dispute. He said that they 
understood India's position and hoped that bilateral discussions 
between India and France [as received] would soon be resumed. 
  On NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty], our prime minister 
mentioned that the NPT review conference of 1995 provided 
suitable opportunity for a genuine review of the treaty to make 
it universal and nondiscriminatory. In this context, the prime 
minister pointed out that India's action plan presented an 
approach which was exemplary. 
  While briefing newsmen, the official spokesman stated that 
the French foreign minister, Mr Alain Juppe, met our home 
minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, today. The discussions focussed on 
terrorism and fundamentalism aided and instigated by Pakistan. 
He briefed Mr. Juppe extensively on the J and K [Jammu and 
Kashmir] situation and the problems posed by Pakistani support 
in the context of our efforts to revive the political process in 
Jammu and Kashmir. The home minister said that the phenomenon 
of terrorism was not something faced by India alone and a global 
approach was necessary to counter this menace. 
  Mr. Juppe said that France also had been a victim of

  [Text] At the ESCAP [Economic and Social Commission for 
Asia and the Pacific] session in New Delhi, many developing 
countries have voiced full support to India's stand against the 
creation of new trade barriers after the GATT agreement comes 
into force. These countries include Malaysia, Indonesia, 
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, South Korea, China, and Hong Kong. The 
Bangladesh delegate urged the ESCAP secretariat to send a 
message to the forthcoming ministerial conference on GATT at 
Marrakech on this matter. The Indonesian delegate also said 
environment and social issues should not be used as an excuse 
for interfering in the internal affairs of any country and for 
imposing conditions on development assistance. 
  New speakers participating in the plenary and the Committee 
on Regional Economic Cooperation said linking trade and nontrade 
issues poses a threat to the exports from the third world. It 
also negates the spirit of free trade under the Uruguay Round of 
Trade and Tariff Agreement. While some least developed 
countries and New Zealand, Australia, and Japan remained more or 
less noncommittal, the U.S. delegate was quoted as saying that 
his country is not trying to impose any protectionism nor reduce 
the advantage of the developing nations. 
  Other issues that dominated the ESCAP session today relate 
to 
the problem of infrastructure development and the need to ensure 
environment friendly development programs. Most delegates said 
better network of roads and communication facilities is 
important for boosting economic growth in the region. Several 
countries voiced the need for additional funds for financing the 
implementation of the agenda adopted at the Rio Earth Summit.

  [Text] The Delhi ESCAP [Economic and Social Commission for 
Asia and the Pacific] session has finalized an action program 
for regional cooperation in technology transfer. It has been 
endorsed by the committee for regional economic cooperation 
which met yesterday under the chairmanship of the commerce 
secretary, Mr. Tejinder Khanna. The action program seeks to 
promote indigenous technological capabilities in the member 
countries. The private sector is sought to be involved in the 
implementation. Special attention will be given to the 
least-developed landlocked and island countries. 
  India has called for greater regional cooperation in the 
application of space technology, particularly for monitoring the 
management of environment. The environment secretary, Mr. P. 
Rajamani, told the ESCAP meeting that the Indian space program 
is tailored to meet the development needs of the country. He 
welcomed the move for a ministerial-level conference and offered 
New Delhi's full cooperation. 
  Today's discussions will (?cover), among other things, 
poverty alleviation through economic growth and social 
development.

  [Text] Six Indian soldiers were killed and seven civilians 
were martyred in clashes between the freedom fighters and Indian 
troops in various areas of the valley in occupied Kashmir. Four 
soldiers of the Indian paramilitary force were killed and one 
freedom fighter was martyred in a clash at (Rayar) in Badgam 
today. Biswajit Mandal, a military officer of the Border 
Security Force, was killed and four personnel were injured in 
Batamalu. A report says that an Indian soldier shot and killed 
his officer, Man Singh, at Nagrota camp. In Rafiabad, 24 people 
were arrested while 12 houses and shops were set ablaze in the 
Kangan area of Srinagar. Meanwhile, the All Party Hurriet 
Conference at a meeting in Srinagar reaffirmed its stand that 
the Kashmir issue can be resolved only when the Kashmiris are 
granted an opportunity to exercise their right to 
self-determination under UN auspices. The meeting, presided 
over by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, rejected any attempt by India to 
initiate the so-called political process.

  [Text] Cairo, April 7 (AFP) -- Israel and the PLO have 
agreed to meet again in Cairo on Friday [8 April] to try to 
finalize an accord on launching Palestinian autonomy, chief 
Palestinian negotiator Nabil Sha'th said Thursday. 
  Palestinian and Israeli officials reached the decision over 
the telephone on Thursday morning, Sha'th told AFP. The two 
sides had agreed to reconvene on Sunday after adjourning 
autonomy talks on Wednesday. 
  They will meet Friday on the Moslem traditional day of rest. 
  Sha'th had criticized Israeli negotiators for heading home 
to 
observe a Holocaust remembrance day on Thursday, and said it 
would be difficult now to finalize an accord on launching 
autonomy by an April 13 deadline. 
  Under the September accord the two signed in Washington, 
Israel was to have begun withdrawing its troops from Gaza and 
Jericho on December 13 and completed the move by April 13. 
  The first deadline was missed, but PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat 
insisted in Jordan on Wednesday that the withdrawal take place 
in a week's time.

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Apr (MENA)--Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat has stated that in his meeting with Arab League 
Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today, they discussed 
the latest developments in the Palestinian-Israeli talks, 
whether those in Cairo, Washington, Paris, Moscow, or elsewhere. 
The purpose of the meeting was to put the Arab League in the 
picture on these latest developments, he added. 
  Speaking to MENA following his meeting with Dr. 
'Abd-al-Majid, 'Arafat said he informed the Arab League chief 
that Israel was dragging its feet about implementing the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement, something that marks the general 
Israeli position, although 13 April, the date on which Israeli 
troops are scheduled to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho, is 
approaching. 
  The Palestinian president described Israeli leaders' 
statements that the deadlines for withdrawal are not sacred as a 
new attempt by Israel to avoid implementing the agreements on 
time. He referred to the obstacles Israel is placing in front 
of the talks, be it at the Administrative Affairs Committee or 
other committees. He added: This has become a basic feature of 
the Israelis, who first evaded the withdrawal on 13 December and 
are now evasive about completing the withdrawal on 13 April as 
agreed upon in Washington. He pointed out that with Israel 
dragging its feet, the antipeace forces will seize the 
opportunity to get fiercer. 
  On Egypt's role in promoting peace, 'Arafat thanked 
President 
Mubarak for his constant efforts to boost the peace process in 
every direction. He described his meeting with President 
Mubarak today as positive and constructive, part of the constant 
consultations between the two sides. 
  'Arafat added: Our relations with Egypt are strong and 
outstanding in every political and economic field. He noted 
that the Palestinian side uses Egyptian experts in economic and 
other fields to face the Israeli negotiators, who are trying to 
be evasive about legal issues to which they committed themselves 
in their agreements with the Palestinians. 'Arafat pointed out 
that he briefed the United States and Russia, the cosponsors of 
peace, on Israel's intransigence over implementing the peace 
agreement and asked them to perform their duty in protecting the 
Palestinian people and sanctities and implementing the 
international resolutions for safeguarding the Palestinian 
rights.

members of armed groups, including two gunmen who might have 
carried out the assassination attempt on the leader of the 
Popular Association for Unity and Action. Over to Hamza Wahib 
for more details: 
  [Wahib] The security forces have announced that, following 
this morning's attempted assassination of Abbas Allalou, the 
leader of the Popular Association for Unity and Action, in El 
Kouthbane district in Mohammedia, they killed two gunmen who 
were driving a car at a place called Gatfi, on the highway east 
of Algiers. This happened at a roadblock erected by the 
security forces immediately after the assassination attempt. 
  The security forces have also stated that they recovered two 
automatic weapons and that an investigation is under way to 
establish whether these weapons were used in the attempted 
assassination of Abbas Allalou. Earlier reports released by the

out by two gunmen. 
  Moreover, the security forces have announced the killing of

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Nine Israelis were killed and dozens were injured 
today when a car bomb exploded in the heart of 'Afula 
settlement, in northern occupied Palestine. An Israeli military 
official said that so far nine Israelis had died and 50 others 
had been injured, most of them seriously. The official added 
that the explosion was the result of a suicide attack. 
  News reports said that a massive fire engulfed the scene of 
the explosion. Another Israeli official described the scene as 
a horrible sight. News reports have also indicated that, after 
this explosion, which shook the Israeli settlement, Israeli 
enemy forces surrounded the area, sealed off all roads from and 
to the occupied West Bank, and began a series of arrests among 
the Palestinians. 
  Thus, the illusion of peace which is being promoted has been 
exposed. It has now been confirmed that real peace could be 
achieved only with the return of the occupying invaders, who 
have colonized Palestine, to their original homelands, the 
return of the Palestinian people to their homeland, and the 
establishment of a democratic state of Palestine where 
Palestinians, Muslims, Christians, and Jews can live together. 
If this is not achieved, there can only be more massacres, more 
killings, and more bloodshed. 
  What happened today confirms an obvious reality -- namely, 
that there will be no stability for the invaders, whatever means 
of repression they use and however much blood they shed. The 
only road of escape for the occupiers is to return immediately 
to the countries from which they have come as invaders.

  [Text] Here is an initial Palestinian reaction to the 
attack in 'Afula: Nasri Yusuf, head of the Palestinian military 
delegation to the Cairo talks, told our correspondent in Cairo 
Arye Gus that the fact that acts of violence continue is very 
saddening. He added that the Palestinians do not support such 
acts, and make every effort to put end to violence in the 
region. The remarks were made after the Palestinian military 
delegation held a meeting with Yasir 'Arafat in Cairo. 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has said that no one can 
guarantee that the attack in 'Afula will be the last. At the 
same time, every effort will be made to cut off the arms of the 
murderers and harm the terror organization which aspires to 
murder all that is good in the Middle East. Minister Peres 
further said that grave incidents had been expected, but the 
attack in 'Afula was graver than could be expected. He added 
that the government will make security-related decisions, and 
rejected the opposition parties' demand that a commission of 
inquiry be set up to investigate the incident. Such murders 
took place when the Likud was in power, and even before the 
peace talks started, Peres said. 
  [In a live telephone interview on Tel Aviv IDF Radio in 
Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 6 April, Foreign Minister Peres says: "I 
do not believe that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] asks or 
needs 'Arafat's permission to carry out such attacks. For the 
time being, 'Arafat is not on the ground here. When he enters 
the region, we will examine his conduct in the region under his 
jurisdiction." Asked about the opposition demand to suspend the 
negotiations with the PLO in the wake of the attack, he said: 
"I see no connection between the two issues."] 
  Minister Yosi Sarid said that the circumstances of the 
attack 
in 'Afula will be thoroughly studied. He rejected the demands 
that the peace talks be suspended claiming that the terrorists 
should not be given a prize for their acts. At the same time, 
he said, we must fight terrorism to the end. 
  Deputy Agriculture Minister Walid Sadiq condemned the grave 
attack in 'Afula, and called for restraint. Deputy Health 
Minister Nayif Musaliha said that the terrorists intend to 
murder the peace process and the relations between Jews and 
Arabs in Israel. 
  Knesset Member [MK] Yosi Katz, deputy chairman of the Labor 
faction, said that the bloody attack proves that the government 
must go on with the peace process, and not be deterred by 
attempts by extremists to torpedo it. 
  Meretz faction Chairman Ran Kohen called on the prime 
minister and the PLO head not to retreat, and to speed up the 
exit of Israelis from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  HADASH [Democratic Front for Peace and Equality] faction 
Chairman Tawfiq Zayyad condemned the attack, saying that it 
poisons the atmosphere and harms the political process. 
  The National Religious Party said that the 'Afula attack is 
the outcome of the Rabin government's policy of groveling. 
  Moledet said that the 'Afula massacre is an indication of 
what is to happen once the recipe for peace, prepared by the 
government and the PLO, is implemented. 
  Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that MK Ravitz of the 
United Torah Jewry demanded that the prime minister set up a 
state commission of inquiry to examine the events that led to 
the attack in 'Afula. 
  Likud MK 'Ovadya Eli, who used to be 'Afula mayor, demanded 
that peace talks be stopped at once, and that their continuation 
be made conditional on a Palestinian commitment to prevent 
additional acts of terror from taking place.

  [Text] Iraqi opposition sources in the north of the 
homeland have accused elements among the Iraqi agents of killing 
German journalist Lissy Schmidt, who worked for AFP and several 
German newspapers. The source said that Saddam's bloody regime 
promised its agents a reward of $10,000 for killing a foreigner 
in north Iraq and that Schmidt is a victim of this criminal 
campaign. The spokesman affirmed that Saddam makes light of the 
UN resolutions, particularly Security Council Resolution 687, 
which stipulates that halting terrorism is one of the conditions 
for lifting the international sanctions imposed on Iraq because 
of Saddam's indiscriminate policy. These sources added that 
unknown gunmen killed Schmidt and her Kurdish companion, 'Aziz 
Qadir, at noon the day before yesterday when they were 
travelling to a village in al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate to report 
on the arrival of humanitarian aid to the region.

<F P=106> [By 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Haydari and Faysal Makram from Sanaa, </F>
and Iqbal 'Ali 'Abdallah from Aden] 
  [Excerpt] Yesterday, the Yemeni crisis witnessed a series 
of developments indicating an escalation. Reliable sources in 
Sanaa have reported that Presidential Council Chairman 
Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih informed the Political 
Forces Dialogue Committee that the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
is floating a "new plan" that calls for the deployment of 
Egyptian troops between the northern Yemeni and southern Yemeni 
troops in the former border areas. 
  These sources added that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was informed 
of 
the new YSP plan by Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister 
Ambassador Badr Hammam, who also met with YSP leaders in Aden, 
including 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the YSP 
Central Committee and vice chairman of the Presidential Council. 
  Sources close to the General People's Congress said that it 
was Yemeni Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas who relayed 
the "new plan" to the Egyptian mediator. The sources added that 
the Presidential Council chairman expressed his strong 
dissatisfaction with the new plan, noting that it was only 
promoted by a minority within the YSP higher command, the 
majority of which cherishes unity. President Salih noted that 
this plan would return the country to the situation that 
prevailed before the merger unity of 22 May 1990. 
  In a separate development, and in a meeting with members of 
the Political Forces Dialogue Committee, the Yemeni president 
has denied that his country is importing banned weapons, saying: 
"Regardless of the differences in perspective we might have, we 
must resort to dialogue. We should not undermine national 
constants. Our unity must remain intact. It is better for us 
to come to the negotiating table to reach understanding and find 
solutions to our problems and hurdles before the onset of any 
armed conflicts or violence. This is because the failure to do 
so would result in bloodshed, devastation, and ruination 
throughout the homeland." [passage omitted]

  [Text] In an exclusive statement to AL-BILAD, Information 
Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani has denied reports that Amman will 
host Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and U.S. President 
Bill Clinton within the context of an international investors 
conference allegedly scheduled to be held before the end of this 
year. 
  Al-'Anani added that Shim'on Peres proposed the convening of 
this conference under the pretext of reinvigorating the 
Jordanian economy. He went on to say: Peres should have 
realized that Jordan would not agree to host such a conference 
before the peace process comes to a successful conclusion. 
  Our interlocutor asserted that many ideas are being raised 
on 
the international scene. We have also heard about joint 
projects. Israel seems to want to conduct feasibility studies on 
such projects, he said. 
  Al-'Anani added: We will hear many things. There are 
various ideas being floated. However, those who learn of them 
should not take them seriously. 
  When asked whether he is optimistic or pessimistic over the 
prospects of the current negotiations, al-'Anani said: As a 
former negotiator, I do have a certain objective; namely, the 
restoration of our rights in full, as enshrined in the relevant 
UN resolutions. 
  Al-'Anani added: The key to the negotiations is not in the 
hands of any single party. It is in the hands of many parties. 
Given the current circumstances, and the current Arab 
divisions, we in Jordan cannot control the course of the 
negotiations. 
  We asked al-'Anani why Jordan suddenly adopted a tough 
position toward the siege of al-'Aqabah. He answered us, 
saying: Jordan did not express its anger over the al-'Aqabah 
siege only last week. It has been expressing its anger for a 
long time. However, Jordan's expression of this anger has 
become stronger than ever before in the aftermath of the recent 
ship search incident, in which UN troops and U.S. battleships 
hastened to inspect a German cargo ship carrying goods bound for 
Jordan and other countries. In this incident, the U.S. 
battleships inspected the goods imported for Jordan and other 
countries twice. Nonetheless, the ship was prevented from 
unloading its cargo in Jordan. The ship left for the Suez 
Canal, where it unloaded its Jordanian cargo. 
  We asked al-'Anani about statements made by former 
information ministers regarding the need to disband the Ministry 
of Information, contending that its existence is no longer 
justified, al-'Anani said: I believe that the media must have 
an official agency to supervise them, be it a ministry or 
another state agency. I think that the Ministry of Information 
is the best agency to provide such supervision. 
  When pressed further about the rationale for the existence 
of 
the Ministry of Information, al-'Anani said: Honestly, I do not 
insist on the existence of the Ministry of Information to 
supervise the media in Jordan. Another agency other than the 
Ministry of Information could be created to supervise the 
Jordanian media. 
  We asked him the following question: We believe that the 
official media has failed to express Jordan's policy. What do 
you have to say on this? 
  Al-'Anani said: I believe that the official media is 
experiencing problems. We need the convocation of a media 
conference to discuss the multifaceted problems facing the 
press. It goes without saying that a diversity of views is 
required. I am a true believer in the statement made by His 
Majesty King Husayn that we need a state media, rather than a 
government media.

<F P=106> [News conference by Information Minister Michel Samahah with </F>
unidentified correspondents following a Cabinet meeting in 
Beirut--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Samahah] The Cabinet held its weekly meeting 
under the prime minister this evening. At the outset the 
Cabinet discussed the situation in the country, security, and 
the media. It then discussed its agenda and approved most of 
the topics, including the amendment of Legislative Decree No. 
104/77 governing the publication law. The Cabinet approved two 
bills on concluding agreements between Lebanon and France on a 
cooperation protocol signed in Paris on 14 October 1993 and a 
cultural, scientific, and technical cooperation agreement signed 
in Paris on 14 October 1993. 
  The Cabinet approved a draft decree amending Article 14 of 
the lending law at the Agricultural, Industrial, and Land 
Lending Bank. It approved a decree transferring and appointing 
editors and clerks in some public departments. It also approved 
four decrees pertaining to the potable water authorities of 
al-Batrun, al-Miyah wa Miyah, 'Akkar, and al-Kurah. 
  The Cabinet formed the National Authority on Childhood and 
approved a memorandum of understanding with the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia under which the Kingdom will give Lebanon $100 million to 
finance reconstruction projects. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] 
  [Samahah] The Cabinet did not discuss this subject. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] 
  [Samahah] Several amendments were made to the appeals 
attorney general's right under Article 23 to confiscate 
publications without suspending them. A mechanism for quick 
trials has been adopted and fines have been increased. The 
NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY will tonight release the amended bill 
approved by the government. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] 
  [Samahah] This topic, which has caused an uproar, is 
groundless. Neither the government nor the information minister 
have thought of banning plays on television and radio. Whoever 
watches private Lebanese stations listens to all kinds of plays. 
In the media bill being prepared [words indistinct], it is one 
the articles being discussed by the ministerial committee on 
radio and television media. Emphasis is placed on the need for 
national theatrical production in every field. [passage omitted 
on the theater and culture] 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] 
  [Samahah] I believe the mission is big. It does not concern 
a person or a minister. It does not concern the Cabinet or the 
ministerial committee. We are striving to accelerate things 
with the necessary speed. I hope we will finish as soon as 
possible. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] 
  [Samahah] We are awaiting a Cabinet decision. This decision 
[words indistinct] television and radio law after it is issued 
by the Chamber of Deputies. I hope this law will be issued 
soon. It is difficult to imagine Lebanon with only one company 
and once voice. But all companies and all radios must adhere to 
instructions.

Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho when they take over self-rule. 
It earmarked $10 million to build housing units for the 
Palestinian police force.

  [Text] The death toll in the suicide operation that was 
carried out by 19-year-old Palestinian Ra'id Zakarinah in 'Afula 
yesterday has risen to nine. Fifty-two others were injured in 
the attack. The Palestinian youth was martyred in the operation, 
which marked the passing of 40 days since the Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre. The youth who carried out the operation had been 
detained in occupation jails last year and had been tortured by 
the secret security organs for 75 days. 
  In a statement to London radio, Israeli Government Spokesman 
(Uri Drumi) urged the PLO to condemn the car bomb operation in 
'Afula. 
  The United States also asked PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to 
condemn the car-bombing in 'Afula, northern occupied Palestine. 
U.S. State Department Spokesman Mike McCurry said: We certainly 
hope that 'Arafat would condemn this act of violence. The 
language would be of his choosing. McCurry described the 
operation as extremely serious. In a press release issued by 
the U.S. State Department on the operation last night, McCurry 
said that the United States condemns this act in the strongest 
terms. He stressed that the United States is committed to the 
security of Israel and to supporting it in its fight against 
so-called terrorism. At the same time, he stressed that the 
United States will continue efforts to advance the Middle East 
peace process. [In its review of the Syrian press headlines at 
0445 GMT on 7 April, Damascus Radio carries the following 
headline without further elaboration: "The papers highlight the 
martyrdom operation that was carried out by a Palestinian youth 
against an Israeli bus, killing nine settlers and wounding 52 
others"]

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] The brave and martyr-seeking attack by a Palestinian 
mujahid at a Zionist bus stop -- on the 40th day of the massacre 
of fasting worshipers in the al-Khalil mosque -- which resulted 
in the death of eight Zionists and the wounding of more than 50 
others, shows, first and foremost, that the era of the intifadah 
is different from the past. By undertaking responsibility for 
this operation, the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement 
Hamas stated that the car explosion at a Zionist bus stop in 
'Afula in the north of occupied Palestine is in answer to the 
massacre of the fasting Palestinian worshipers at the 
al-Ibrahimi shrine and in order to avenge their unjustly shed 
blood. 
  Political observers believe that this attack demonstrates 
the 
strength of the Palestinian Islamic movement in organizing and 
carrying out jihad operations. Yesterday's attack took place on 
the anniversary of the commencement of the intifadah and the 
Zionist forces were on full alert. The place where the 
operation took place was north of occupied Palestine, or, in 
other words, outside the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a place where 
carrying out operations is extremely difficult. The admission 
by the Zionist chief of staff that the Zionist regime's military 
forces will not be able to prevent such operations in the future 
proves this point even further. 
  Since its founding, the Zionist regime has unilaterally 
massacred and rendered homeless the people of Palestine and Arab 
countries that share borders with occupied Palestine. Because 
of the unequal military balance and extensive support by 
international powers for the usurping regime, the reaction by 
the people of Palestine and the world has not been strong enough 
to stop this inhuman process. However, now that the Muslim 
Palestinians have been armed with the spirit of jihad and 
martyrdom, the situation has completely changed. 
  Seven years ago, with the commencement of the intifadah and 
the persistent struggle against the Zionist regime, the 
Palestinians gave up the past beliefs of political leaders of 
Palestine in defending the rights of the Palestinian Muslims 
through international organizations. By relying on the 
Palestinian people and their Islamic belief, they set off on a 
path that has proven to be effective and, God willing, will lead 
to victory in the not very distant future.

  [Text] The participants in the discussions at the Prime 
Minister's Office held in the wake of the Cairo talks this 
morning were advised that this week's negotiations achieved no 
progress. The talks will resume on 10 April and continue until 
12 April, the eve of the commemoration day for fallen IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] soldiers. 
  Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that Israel 
categorically rejects the Palestinian demand to reopen the 
negotiations on the map of Gaza Strip roads and zones on which 
the two sides have already agreed. 
  Other disputed issues are the size of the Palestinian police 
and the authority that will have jurisdiction over Israelis who 
commit offenses in the Gaza and Jericho precincts. In fact, the 
legal committee was unable to start discussions because the 
Palestinian representatives to this committee failed to show up 
at the meeting. Our correspondent adds that it has been agreed 
that in view of the situation, there is no point in sending the 
delegation back to Cairo today. 
  Our correspondent adds that in the Paris talks, progress was 
achieved in the negotiations on the Gaza port. It was agreed 
that the procedures governing the other international border 
crossings will be applied in the port. 
  Nabil Sha'th, the chief Palestinian delegate to the Cairo 
talks, says the Israeli proposals on the Gaza and Jericho 
autonomy jurisdiction are totally unacceptable. In his opinion, 
the Israeli proposals stand in complete contravention of the 
Oslo Declaration of Principles. Nabil Sha'th refused to specify 
the substance of the Israeli proposals.

  [Text] Finance Minister Avraham Shohat, who heads the 
Israeli delegation to the economic talks in Paris, says that 
although not all the problems have been solved, progress is 
achievable. It has been learned from the Israeli delegation 
that about 60 percent of the economic agreements have been 
drafted. 
  Last night Israeli and PLO representatives discussed worker 
traffic. The remaining unresolved issues are the imports from 
Arab countries and the value added tax rates. Our correspondent 
Gid'on Kouts reports that the PLO has agreed to establish a 
monetary authority instead of a central bank, and as for 
Palestinian currency, there will be a limited token issue. 
  This round of the Paris talks will continue until 11 April.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal] </F>
  [Text] Israeli sources say that any delay in the deployment 
of Palestinian policemen will bring about a delay of one or two 
weeks in the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho. Major General Amnon Shahaq also said as much to 
his colleague, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, during the last round of talks 
in Cairo. This was reported in a consultation held in Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's Tel Aviv office yesterday. 
  A member of the Israeli delegation explained that the 
deployment of the Palestinian police force will take about one 
month and that until it is completed, the IDF will not complete 
its withdrawal. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin firmly opposes 
unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Sources 
in the defense establishment say Israel will not create a power 
vacuum which could be filled by Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement], even if this means our remaining in the Gaza Strip 
for another week or two against our wishes. 
  The question is: Why are the Palestinians holding up the 
entrance of the first Palestinian police officers, who are 
slated to arrive in the autonomy areas in two days. A senior 
political source said: This does not stem from 'Arafat's 
negative attitude; even worse, it is the result of internal 
differences of opinion and disarray within the Palestinian 
delegation. 
  Jerusalem hopes that despite the differences of opinion 
between the generals and the politicians within the PLO, the 
first eight Palestinian police officers will arrive in Gaza and 
Jericho next Sunday or Monday.

  [Text] Dubai, April 7 (AFP) -- It is too early to consider 
an end to the Arab trade boycott of Israel because the Middle 
East peace process has yet to achieve success, a senior Arab 
League official said here Thursday [7 April]. 
  The league's assistant secretary general for political 
affairs, 'Adnan 'Imran, told AFP: "It is premature to talk of 
lifting the boycott because the reasons which motivated this 
legitimate measure have still not disappeared." 
  And he said those trying to pressurise Arab countries would 
do better to "concentrate their efforts on ensuring the success 
of the peace process." 
  The Arab League agreed in Cairo last month to postpone a 
debate on whether to ease the trade boycott of Israel, amid 
anger over the Hebron mosque massacre in which a Jewish settler 
killed 30 Arab worshippers in February. 
  The decision ignored a US campaign aimed at lifting the 
indirect boycott on foreign firms doing business with Israel 
following the signing of the Israeli-PLO autonomy accord in 
Washington in September. 
  Oman and Qatar had also pushed for easing the boycott, Arab 
diplomats said. 
  Ministers from the 22 member countries agreed to consider 
the 
boycott imposed over four decades ago at a session later in the 
year. 
  "We are waiting for the day when the Israeli occupation ends 
and that will lead to a lifting of the boycott," according to 
'Imran, a Syrian. 
  Damascus, one of the four Arab parties in the peace 
negotiations with Israel, has steadfastly opposed lifting the 
boycott until Israel withdraws from all Arab lands captured in 
the 1967 war. 
  'Imran said all Arab countries agreed on the need to bring 
peace to the Middle East. 
  'Imran, who was attending a meeting of the Arab Towns 
Organization here, also condemned the recent defence agreement 
signed between Israel and France which ended a 30-year freeze on 
military cooperation. 
  "We hope France will revise its policy especially as Arab 
states hope to reinforce their friendly relations with this 
country." 
  And he warned Paris should not count on Arab support "if it 
aligns itself with Israel, supplying it with the means to bring 
war and destruction." 
  He added that the Arab League was stepping up efforts to 
restore Arab solidarity badly shaken by the 1990-1991 Gulf 
crisis, when Jordan, Yemen and the PLO were accused of backing 
Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait. 
  Arab-Israeli peace talks suspended since the Hebron massacre 
are due to resume at the end of April.

  [Text] Cairo, April 7 (AFP)--The PLO expressed its 
condolences Thursday to the families of the seven Israelis 
killed when a teenage Palestinian militant rammed his 
explosive-packed car into a bus in the northern Israeli town of 
Afula. 
  An official PLO spokesman said in a statement to AFP: "The 
PLO presents its condolences to the families of the victims (of 
the attack)," which also left 45 wounded. 
  "The PLO hopes that all concerned parties will assume their 
responsibility to safeguard the peace process and achieve its 
aims, to ensure a just and equal solution between the 
Palestinian and Israeli peoples," the statement said. 
  The United States called on PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat 
Wednesday to condemn the Afula attack, carried out by a 
19-year-old member of the Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS, 
which is opposed to the peace process.

  [Text] Cairo, 7 Apr (MENA)--The PLO has announced that the 
'Affula incident yesterday confirms the urgent need to achieve 
tangible progress to implement the interim agreement and to 
undertake practical measures to prove the seriousness of the 
peace process. 
  In a statement by an official Palestinian spokesman in Cairo 
today, the PLO expressed its grief over the incident, which left 
several Israeli civilians dead. 
  The organization noted that the series of actions that began 
with the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron and subsequent 
massacres, most notably that in the Jabalyah refugee camp in the 
Gaza Strip, where Israeli military forces have killed PLO 
cadres, confirms the urgent need to establish peace. 
  The spokesman said the PLO extends its condolences to the 
families of the civilian victims and hopes that all the parties 
concerned will assume their responsibility of safeguarding the 
peace process and achieving its goals to ensure a just and 
balanced solution guaranteeing genuine coexistence between the 
Palestinian and Israeli peoples.

<F P=106> [Report by Mohammad Beshkar in Beirut] </F>
  [Text] The Islamic Jihad in Palestine has announced its 
responsibility for the operation carried out by one of the 
Palestinian mujahidin this morning in the occupied city of 
Ashdod, north of the Gaza Strip. A Zionist settler was killed 
and four others were wounded in the attack. A statement by the 
movement obtained by our radio says: 'Ali al-'Amawi, an Islamic 
Jihad member from the al-Shati' camp in Gaza, acting alone, 
attacked a group of armed Zionist settlers in Ashdod this 
morning, killing one and seriously wounding four others. The 
mujahid was martyred by Israeli occupation forces' gunfire 
during the attack. 
  In a telephone contact with him a short time ago, Dr. Fathi 
al-Shiqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad in Palestine, 
stressed the continuation of jihad and military operations 
against the occupation forces and the Zionist settlers. He 
condemned UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and the 
president of the Security Council for rushing to condemn the 
martyrdom-seeking operation in 'Afula, north of occupied 
Palestine, yesterday. He said this proves that the United 
Nations and the Security Council are controlled by the American 
will. Asked about the Islamic Jihad in Palestine's operation 
today, he said: 
  [Begin al-Shiqaqi recording] The operations will continue. 
They reflect our people's protest against and rejection of the 
alleged and [word indistinct] peace agreement between the PLO 
and the Israelis. They stress that our people's option is to 
continue jihad and fight despite all attempts by the United 
States, the Zionist enemy, and the official Palestinian side to 
implement the Oslo agreement, which, again, I stress, makes 
peace for no one but gives another reason for war. [end

  [Text] Cairo, 7 Apr (MENA)--Marwan Kanafani, Palestinian 
president Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, has expressed his surprise 
over Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' statements, in 
which he asks the Palestinian president to personally condemn 
the 'Affula incident. 
  In a statement he made this evening, Kanafani said in answer 
to Peres' statements that it is very strange to hear such a 
request from the Israeli foreign minister--neither he nor 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin expressed any kind of 
regret or condemnation when the Israeli army and intelligence 
deliberately killed six prominent youths from Fatah recently in 
Jabalyah in the Gaza Strip. 
  The Palestinian official added that the contrary was true 
since the Israeli housing minister expressed his and the Israeli 
Government's appreciation for such terrorist acts when he 
emerged from the Israeli cabinet's weekly session to declare the 
cabinet's stance on the incident.

  [Excerpts] A mass memorial ceremony was held in Amman 
yesterday to commemorate and glorify the martyrs of the Hebron 
massacre -- which was perpetrated by Zionist settlers inside 
the holy Ibrahimi mosque in the middle of the blessed month of 
Ramadan -- and to mark the passing of 40 days since the painful 
massacre. 
  A eulogistic speech by brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] 
was 
read on his behalf by brother al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, 
ambassador of the state of Palestine to Jordan. It said: 
  I invite you to stand in one minute's silence to bring 
blessings to the souls of our martyrs and to immortalize their 
revivifying memory while they are in the heaven of immortality 
with the prophets and the true messengers, such good companions. 
[passage omitted] 
  The continuous waves of martyrs are nothing but brilliant 
evidence of the resolve and determination of our people to 
defend their national rights and to bring them to materialize on 
the ground in order to create an independent state with holy 
Jerusalem as its capital, to ensure the return of our people to 
their land, and to achieve a just and durable peace for the 
coming generations of our people and nation in the land of 
Palestine, the land of peace, justice, and freedom and the 
cradle of civilizations. 
  Honorable brothers, we are passing through a critical and 
sensitive stage and we are at a fateful crossroads that requires 
not only that we continually display caution but also that we 
deal with the regional and international facts, variables, and 
emerging developments with all possible wisdom and experience, 
so that in the end we may serve the interests of the struggle of 
our people and our nation. We know very well the balances of 
power, the nature of the adversary with whom we are negotiating, 
and the support the adversary is getting from the world Zionist 
movement and from hegemonist powers in the world. 
  As much as our battle needs solid national unity, which we 
always strive to deepen and reinforce, it also needs full Arab 
and Islamic support, and backing, coordination, and cooperation 
among the brothers. All the achievements accomplished by our 
people through their honest and faithful jihad would not have 
been possible had it not been for their faith, will, and solid 
national resolve, and their militant and national unity. This 
is what we need at this stage, at this difficult stage, more 
than at any other time, especially as we prepare to enter the 
stage of building and creating the foundations of our national 
authority over the cherished liberated parts of our homeland and 
to proceed to build the edifice of our independent state, with 
holy Jerusalem as its capital, in which we will shortly pray 
together, God almighty willing. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Riyad Mansur] </F>
  [Text] The PLO has called on the U.S. Administration and 
the French Government to accurately monitor and control the 
Jewish extremist groups in these two countries. The PLO has 
also strongly rejected calls by Israeli Police Affairs Minister 
Moshe Shahal and the so-called Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert not 
to allow Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat to pray at the 
al-Aqsa Mosque. It said such calls are like throwing sand in 
ones eyes. 
  Bassam Abu-Sharif, political adviser to the Palestinian 
president, stressed to SAWT AL-SHA'B that the Jewish groups in 
the United States and France maintain dangerous links with the 
extremist groups in Israel. This, he said, poses a serious 
threat to the entire peace process. 
  Although Abu-Sharif spoke about the Jewish extremists' 
threats, he also hinted at the threats posed by the extremist 
Palestinian groups which receive support from states opposing 
the peace process, and which, openly, seek to foil and obstruct 
the current political process. 
  In the first Palestinian reaction to calls by some Israelis 
not to allow 'Arafat to enter al-Aqsa Mosque, the Palestinian 
president's political adviser said: Entering Jerusalem and the 
holy places is a right of every Palestinian. He pointed out 
that no one can deprive them of this right. He noted that 
President 'Arafat and the group which will accompany him to the 
liberated lands will perform their religious duties in the holy 
places. 
  He said that the occupation authorities have no right to 
prevent any Palestinian from performing his religious duties 
until the final status of Jerusalem is decided. He said that 
this issue should be guaranteed and safeguarded because 
Jerusalem is the city of the three religions and cannot be 
Judaized. He said that its nature and heritage must be 
maintained. 
  Abu-Sharif expected that matters will go in two directions; 
the first toward entrenching the bases of a comprehensive peace, 
and the second will be embodied by the extremist groups attempts 
to foil, obstruct, and delay the peace process. 
  He called for reaching an understanding on merging some of 
the clauses of the interim period and the final status stage. 
He said that entrenching the peace process requires the 
Palestinian and Israeli sides to work quickly to defuse any 
chance of explosion. He said that any such chance is based in 
the actions by the extremist Palestinians and Jews. He stressed 
that past dreams are over and that a new era has started. 
  The Palestinian president's adviser pointed out that Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who enjoys farsighted strategic 
views, knows what he means, and that Yitzhaq Rabin, as a prime 
minister and defense minister, who also has a lot of experience, 
knows what he means. 
  He stressed that the events that have taken place have 
bypassed the Oslo agreement, and so, the Israeli Government 
should seriously think about synchronizing the settlers' 
withdrawal with the withdrawal of its military forces, or, 
otherwise, the settlers will turn into a party which will not 
only attack the Palestinians, but the Israelis as well. 
  Abu-Sharif reiterated his call for setting up a 
Jordanian-Syrian-Lebanese-Palestinian operations room, whose 
task is to daily follow the peace negotiations affairs. He 
emphasized that a true and effective Arab coordination can 
attain Arab rights and foil Israel's attempts to deal separately 
with each Arab side.

Cairo, and the Israeli attempts to disrupt their implementation, 
a matter which is threatening the peace process in the Middle 
East.

  [Text] AL-KHABAR and AL-WATAN newspapers today published an 
article by the head of the government [Redha Malek] in which he 
gave an analysis of the situation that our country is 
experiencing on all levels. Jamila Mezoued has the details. 
  [Begin Mezoued recording] Mr. Redha Malek said state 
officials, both civilian and military, have continued with 
courage and bravery to carry out their difficult tasks to 
repulse the specter of disorder and establish law and order. 
The head of the government added that recently some new 
promising economic prospects have started to become clear 
because of the agreements that are about to be signed with the 
International Monetary Fund. 
  Mr. Redha Malek said all these compact acts constitute a 
firm 
view by a government that has not lost the initiative; it is 
today required, in the name of the public interest, to leave its 
distinctive marks on the course of events. 
  The head of the government said political pluralism and the 
freedom of expression are some of the main gains Algerian people 
have obtained since the ratification of the 1982 constitution. 
The government will remain, more than any time before, eager to 
preserve and bolster these gains. 
  Mr. Redha Malek added that in this sphere, it was high time 
for the restitution of the rule of law, because when some 
leaders of some political groups expect to achieve political 
interest by turning a blind eye on the terror that is shaking up 
a whole society, then this is ethically unacceptable, but it 
remains that everybody should have a conscience and, and history 
will be his judge. 
  In his article Mr. Redha Malek also says that when some 
openly call for insubordination and rebellion inside 
institutions dealing with order, and for an international 
boycott of our country, they are then obviously dealt with in 
accordance with the laws of the republic. Only the state bears 
the task of defending property and persons, preserving the unity 
of the people, and guaranteeing the harmony of the nation 
throughout the homeland. It is fine, Mr. Redha Malek says, that 
we denounce bribery, favoritism, nepotism, and all scourges. 
This is a salvation and courageous action, a commitment to 
society for the emerging of a political culture devoid of 
illegitimate privileges and settlement of accounts. The tactics 
of securing gains and all the demagogic ways that have been used 
excessively by some people must be fought by the political class 
first if the latter wants to retrieve its credibility. 
  Concerning the role of the press, Mr. Redha Malek says in 
his 
article that the information media play a decisive role, 
sometimes negative and sometimes positive, in changing 
situations. But some journalists and papers, the prime minister 
adds, have not yet arrived at appreciating the exceptional 
situation we are going through, and the degree of the 
complication and danger of the situation in our country. 
  Mr. Redha Malek said that in my capacity as the head of the 
executive body, the laws of the republic will be implemented on 
everybody. The prime minister added that if there were 
criticisms on this issue, they should be put in a clear and 
detailed way. The destructive confusion of issues and the easy 
and unfounded accusations should disappear completely from the 
columns of our press. 
  The article of Mr. Redha Malek added that the appointment of 
Liamine Zeroual as head of state will strongly contribute 
towards the definition of the vision and the consolidation of 
stability and security. If combating terrorism remains the most 
pressing duty of the state, it will not neglect other essential 
duties represented in the renewal of our political system to 
enable it to manage the transitional phase, in the light of a 
critical change, as stated by Liamine Zeroual in his speech in 
Tunisia. Mr. Redha Malek added that today, more than in any 
other times, our country strongly needs its sons. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Qusayy Salih al-Darwish: "Algerian Security </F>
Forces Foil Attempt To Assassinate Kafi"] 
  [Text] Paris -- According to informed sources, former 
Algerian Higher State Council Chairman Ali Kafi was the target 
of an assassination attempt last week, and the security forces 
have arrested two of his guards for complicity in the operation. 
  The sources say that the security forces uncovered the 
operation in time and in doing so prevented any harm to Kafi, 
but observers do not rule out the possibility that the aim was 
to put pressure on the former chairman to force him to leave the 
presidential residence in Zeralda which he refused to leave when 
his term of office ended. 
  The responsible authorities had prepared a villa for Kafi in 
a military residential area in "Palm Beach" because he had 
leased his personal residence to a Spanish company. 
  Meanwhile, President Liamine Zeroual has canceled his 
meeting 
with Dr. Saeed Saadi, leader of the Grouping for Culture and 
Democracy. The cancellation of the meeting, which was scheduled 
to take place yesterday, came in the wake of Saadi's statements 
to the French press criticizing the regime and President Zeroual 
and disclosing the questions he intended to ask President 
Zeroual. After the cancellation, Saeed Saadi intensified his 
attack on the presidency in a statement to the newspaper EL 
WATAN yesterday. 
  President Zeroual's decision to cancel his meeting with 
Saadi 
represented a new step in the regime's way of dealing with the 
forces opposed to dialogue which had enjoyed the regime's 
privileges and criticized it at the same time. 
  Many observers believe that Saadi and his party had for many 
years acted in accordance with the instructions of the Algerian 
authorities. 
  The cancellation of the meeting can be seen as the beginning 
of the crystallization of Zeroual's personal style of running 
the presidency. 
  Some forces are still calling for the formation of militias 
and abandonment of the dialogue idea. The [Islamic] Salvation 
Front [FIS] has claimed that the regime was behind the 
assassination of the two female students who, it said, had veils 
on and were killed to instill fear. In a statement issued 
yesterday, the FIS also said that over the past few days the 
security forces killed 82 civilians in Blida and 120 civilians 
between Mouftah and Sidi Moussa in addition to others in various 
parts of Algeria. 
  Some of the regime's circles are already talking about 
tangible results of the general violent security offensive 
launched by the military forces two weeks ago. They maintain 
that the number of assassinations and victims has dropped 
significantly since the offensive began. 
  That general offensive, however, has failed to put an end to 
violence, not even in the capital where an Army captain was 
killed the day before yesterday by unknown gunmen.

  [Text] The vice foreign minister of China, Mr. Liu Huaqiu, 
said that his country wants to become a contracting party in the 
GATT to globalize its economy. Mr. Liu is participating in the 
ESCAP [Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific] 
conference currently in session in New Delhi. In an exclusive 
interview to Doordarshan correspondent Prabhat Dabral, Mr. Liu 
said that the farmers of his country will welcome the conclusion 
of the Uruguay Round. 
  [Begin recording] [Dabral] What is the immediate provocation 
for you, Mr. Liu, as the country of socialist economy to apply 
for the membership of GATT? 
  [Liu, in Chinese with superimposed translation into English] 
China has all along being carrying out reforms and opening up 
policy and the diverse measures and steps we have taken in 
economic reforms [and] opening up are also in keeping with the 
requirements of GATT. For instance, in the trade sector, as you 
know, trade -- the drive for economic growth -- also leads to 
high world trade and the trade is playing ever-growing role. 
So, China would also upgrade the provision of the GATT in 
trying to play a more active part in international trade. 
  [Dabral] China, like India is also predominantly 
agriculture-based economy. What do you think the farmers of 
China stand to gain from the GATT, especially from the Uruguay 
Round of negotiations or shall we say the Dunkel text? 
  [Liu, in Chinese with superimposed translation into English] 
On one hand, we should protect the interests of Chinese farmers 
by improving their income situation every year. On the other 
hand, we should also bring our agricultural products to the 
international market [words indistinct] buy from and also sell 
into the international market. By so doing, we will push 
China's agricultural sector into the international market, and 
in this way we can also take advanced experience of technology 
from the international market which again [words indistinct] on 
account of agricultural development. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By M.K. Dhar] </F>
  [Text] NEW DELHI, 1 April-- U.S. Deputy Secretary of State 
Strobe Talbott, who is arriving here on 6 April, will be clearly 
told that even though India is interested in knowing the Clinton 
Administration's views on resolving Indo-Pak differences, 
linking of F-16 supply to Pakistan with a grand design of 
nonproliferation in South Asia is unacceptable to it. 
  India feels that the issue of Pakistan's nuclear capability 
and its capping is a bilateral matter between Islamabad and 
Washington. It cannot be expected to make a matching commitment 
to a proposition which strikes at the root of nonproliferation 
and legitimises Pakistan's clandestine nuclear weapons programme. 
  Mr. Talbott, who is expected to meet Prime Minister P.V. 
Narasimha Rao and other Union Ministers and have discussions 
with Foreign Secretary K. Srinivasan and External Affairs 
Ministry officials, is likely to unfold his package to establish 
a verifiable, comprehensive non-proliferation regime in the 
subcontinent by capping nuclear capabilities of both India and 
Pakistan and also suggesting a multilateral dialogue on arms 
control. 
  The incentives he has to offer to India to comply with the 
Clinton Administration's requirements are not known, but what is 
talked about privately refers to raising the threshold on 
technologies that have so far been denied to it. The suggestion 
for a U.S.-sponsored West Asia Type Indo-Pak dialogue on Kashmir 
and other issues has been informally mooted but the Indian 
reaction will be known only when Mr. Talbott spells out his 
proposals in detail. 
  At present, India is unwilling to commit itself to any such 
negotiations without knowing their scope and usefulness. It 
will not accept anything which amounts to compromising its 
principles because on issues, such as, non-proliferation and 
Kashmir it is not easy to reconcile the views held by India and 
Pakistan, which has found a supporter in the Clinton 
Administration for its nuclear adventurist role in South Asia. 
  The Assistant Secretary of State Ms. Robin Raphel, who spent 
five days here, has already tested the temperature and seen the 
disposition of New Delhi, will brief Mr. Talbott on her 
discussions with the Indian leaders and also accompany him on 
his tour of India and Pakistan. Though Ms. Raphel kept a low 
profile during her discussions in New Delhi and avoided raking 
up fresh controversies, she did not yield ground on any aspect 
of the policies that have been laid down for the Clinton 
Administration in relation to India and Pakistan. It is, 
therefore, unlikely that any further pressures from the U.S. 
over the nonproliferation issue will work so long as India's 
legitimate security requirements are not met and its concept of 
complete and universal disarmament is not accepted. 
  The Indian Government believe that the Clinton 
administration 
has already taken the decision to supply 36 F-16 aircraft and an 
unspecified number of P-3 Orion antisubmarine warfare planes 
through one-time exception of the Pressler Amendment which 
currently bars U.S. military aid to Pakistan. In order to get 
the support of the Congress to the move, the administration is 
linking it with a broader South Asia initiative on 
non-proliferation including capping of the nuclear capabilities 
of both India and Pakistan. 
  But, in effect, Washington is back-sliding on its accepted 
policy of non-proliferation in South Asia. It is pre-empting 
the whole purpose of the bilateral dialogue between India and 
Pakistan by proposing a barter. F-16s, as India has pointed 
out, can be easily modified to deliver nuclear weapons as 
Pakistan had done in the case of the aircraft it received prior 
to the Pressler ban. 
  Mr. Talbott will surely be told that India is the biggest 
victim of proliferation in the region and the U.S. has condoned 
acquisition of nuclear capability by Pakistan and is trying to 
formalise it so that Islamabad can indulge in the game of 
adventurism and blackmail. Therefore, the concept of forcing 
India and Pakistan to comply with U.S. non-proliferation goals 
while adding to Islamabad's offensive capability through the 
supply of F-16 and other aircraft, is totally unacceptable to 
India. The supply of F-16s will decisively shift the military 
balance in the region in Pakistan's favour, India does not 
accept the argument that because of its superior ground forces 
it is not facing a real threat from Pakistan as there are 
limitations to deploying forces on a single front. While 
Pakistan will have, in addition to the F16s, M-11 and other 
missiles supplied to it by China deployed against India, New 
Delhi is being strongly advised against deploying the Prithvi 
missiles along its borders. 
  Though Pakistan is theoretically under sanctions over the 
issue of missile supplies from China, it is widely known that 
Beijing has maintained supplies of components of M-11 missiles 
with a range of more than 300 km. Therefore, there are no 
takers for the argument that resumption of American arms supply 
to Pakistan will not change the strategic balance in the 
subcontinent.

  [Text] NEW DELHI, 1 April -- India is far ahead of China 
and Pakistan in making use of nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes and emerging as an advanced country in this field, Dr. 
R. Chidambaram, Chairman, Department of Atomic Energy said here 
today. 
  While China has (?two) operational nuclear power plants and 
Pakistan only one, India has nine operational nuclear power 
plants and generates about 1720 MW of power which is 
approximately three per cent of the total power generation of 
the country, Dr. Chidambaram said in an exclusive interview. 
  He said that the country had developed expertise in all 
stages of the nuclear fuel cycle and had created indigenous 
capabilities in designing construction and operation of nuclear 
power plants, reprocessing of spent fuel, and manufacture of the 
necessary sophisticated equipment. 
  Capabilities had been created right from exploration and 
mining atomic minerals; preparation of high purity nuclear 
materials, such as uranium, thorium, zirconium etc.; production 
of fuel elements for reactors; production of heavy water and 
health and safety instrumentation of nuclear waste management, 
he said. 
  Dr. Chidambaram said that the prime objective of the atomic 
energy programme was development, control and use of atomic 
energy solely for peaceful purposes. These included generation 
of electricity and development of nuclear applications in 
research, agriculture, industry, medicine, and other areas. 
  To achieve this objective, efforts were initiated to build a 
versatile infrastructure for research facilities, trained 
scientific and technical manpower, raw material processing 
centres and the know-how and capability to manufacture nuclear 
components and electronic equipment to support the atomic energy 
programme with a view to making India truly self-reliant, he 
said. 
  As a result of these efforts, Dr. Chidambaram observed that 
India had broken the super power monopoly in this field and the 
country was today in a position to export research reactors and 
heavy water, subject to international safeguards. 
  "Today, nine units of nuclear power plants are in operation 
in the country with a total capacity of 1720 MW. The work in 
respect of Rajasthan Atomic Power Projects Ill and IV, and a 
unit of Kaiga Atomic Power Project in Karnataka, each unit of 
220 MW, would be commissioned soon", Dr. Chidambaram informed. 
  He said that the Tarapur Atomic Power Station, Rajasthan 
Atomic Power Station, Madras Atomic Power Station, Narora Atomic 
Power Station and Unit I of Kakrapar Atomic Power Project were 
presently operational. The second 220 MW unit of Kakrapar 
Atomic Power Project is expected to achieve criticality shortly, 
he added. 
  Dr. Chidambaram admitted that India's nuclear programme 
target of generating 10,000 MW of power by the end of this 
century had been slowed down due to a financial crunch. 
However, he said that such a crisis was being faced by all 
public sector units and the country's nuclear programme was no 
exception. 
  The Nuclear Power Corporation was striving to increase its 
internal resource generation. Today our nuclear power stations 
could generate an internal surplus of about Rs. [rupees] 100 
crore, but with the addition of Rajasthan and Karnataka units 
our internal resource generation would touch almost Rs. 400 
crore by 1997-98, he said. 
  Dr. Chidamabaram was of the view that at some stage going 
public would be necessary, and that there was tremendous scope 
for joint ventures in this field. Referring to low operating 
performance of nuclear power plants, which is lower than 
international standards, Dr. Chidambaram said that difficulties 
were being faced in integrating the nuclear power stations with 
the grid resulting in low operating performance. These problems 
were, however, being sorted out. 
  Referring to the safety aspect of nuclear power plants, Dr. 
Chidambaram said that the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, an 
independent body, oversaw and regulated all activities to 
enforce safety-related aspects of atomic power plants. "The 
guidelines followed are in conformity with international 
standards, such as those prescribed by the International 
Commission on Radiological Protection," he asserted. 
  Dr. Chidambaram said that safety was incorporated in all 
phases of a nuclear power project or activities starting right 
from the selection of site. Safety, well engineered into the 
system as per current international standards, was pursued in 
fabrication of equipment, construction phases and maintained 
during operation phase, with review by multi-tier committees at 
different levels. Plans for emergency preparedness had also been 
implemented, he said. 
  Recently, the standing committee on energy of the Lok Sabha 
in its fourth report on "Nuclear Plan Safety and Spent Fuel 
Management" which was placed in Parliament last month, has held 
that the commitment of the Department of Atomic Energy to safety 
was total. The committee found that care for protection of 
environment was imbibed in the form of regular procedures for 
site design and operations of all plants. It observed that the 
Department of Atomic Energy adhered to site safety features, 
including protection against earth quakes and associated 
phenomena, extreme meteorological phenomena such as cyclones, 
floods etc. and man-induced events such as aircraft crash, fire, 
explosions, and toxic chemical handling. 
  The committee findings revealed that nuclear industry in the 
country had established a satisfactory safety record. There 
have been no fatalities caused by radiation, nor any sigificant 
occupational radiation injuries of any kind detrimental to the 
public or the environment, at any of the Indian nuclear 
facilities. 
  The committee noted that India accorded top priority to 
management of radioactive wastes right from the beginning of the 
Indian nuclear programme.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Sattar Abu-Husayn] </F>
  [Text] Cairo this week received U.S. and German military 
officials, who paid separate visits with a view to increasing 
the number of countries that will participate in the Bright Star 
exercises next year. General Joseph Hoare, commander of the 
U.S. Central Command, arrived in Cairo on a secret visit. He 
was followed by General Klaus Naumann [name as published], 
German chief of staff, whose visit was announced. 
  AL-SHA'B has learned that the U.S. official's talks in Egypt 
dealt with broadening the scope of participation in the Bright 
Star maneuvers to include, in addition to Egypt and the United 
States, Germany, Britain, and France. Following Egypt's 
approval, the German official came to put the final touches on 
what had already been agreed upon regarding his country's 
participation in the maneuvers. Germany hopes to gain from 
these exercises training expertise in the face of the Islamic 
movements in North Africa. 
  According to information, Egypt's approval to increase the 
number of Western states participating in the exercises was 
conditional on the participation of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 
Egypt also wanted the exercise to be general and not directed 
at facing any regional threat, unlike the previous Bright Star 
exercises, which were directed against what was called the 
Libyan threat! 
  Explaining the benefits that the participation of Germany, 
France, Britain, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait in these exercises 
could provide, the Egyptian side claimed that it would stress 
the continued reliance of the Western allies on Egyptian 
facilities! It will also enable Egypt to get better acquainted 
with the combat methods of the advanced states and allow the 
military commanders from the participating states to get 
together, which could convince the United States of the 
importance of Egypt's participation in safeguarding Gulf 
security! This step, officials claim, will prompt the United 
States to supply Egypt with its military needs. 
  AL-SHA'B has learned that Britain's participation in the 
exercises depends on resolving the problems related to the naval 
training protocol signed by Cairo and London. The British 
insist that the British military personnel training on Egyptian 
territory not be subject to Egyptian law and refuses reciprocal 
treatment for Egyptian military on British territory.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, mufti of the </F>
Republic, by Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Aziz; place and date not given] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Pope Shanudah, in an interview with 
AL-'ARABI, has called for a meeting with al-Azhar's grand imam 
to discuss ways to liberate the Arab sanctities in Jerusalem. 
Along the same line, al-Azhar's imam called on Muslims to work 
toward liberating these sanctities. What is your comment? 
  [Tantawi] I support what both the al-Azhar imam and Pope 
Shanudah said in this regard. I am fully prepared to cooperate 
and coordinate with them to discuss ways to regain our 
sanctities in Palestine. I strongly support this call, because 
Jerusalem occupies a special place in our hearts. It is the 
place Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, visited [in his night 
journey]. We all have to work together for its liberation. 
This does not mean that we should ignore the other religions' 
rights in Jerusalem. The Islamic shari'ah reaches out with 
peace to all those who wish to live in peace with us, but God 
has ordered us to defend ourselves if we are attacked or 
oppressed. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What do you think are the ways to liberate 
Jerusalem from the Zionist enemy? 
  [Tantawi] There are several ways and means, some political, 
religious, and economic and some others that relate to our 
Palestinian brothers, who are primarily concerned. If the 
efforts are combined and the intentions are sincere, we will 
regain our right, God willing, because no right is lost if 
someone pursues it. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The U.S. President's recent acknowledgment 
of 
Jerusalem as the capital of the Zionist entity has aroused 
overwhelming Arab and Islamic anger. What is your comment? 
  [Tantawi] First of all, Jerusalem must be Arab and Islamic 
in 
flesh and blood. Neither the United States nor anybody else can 
change Jerusalem's historic status. I support what Dr. Usamah 
al- Baz has stated; namely, that only Muslims and Arabs can 
settle this problem. But I repeat that this does not mean that 
we should deny other religions the right to practice their rites 
in Jerusalem and to have their share, proceeding from the 
Prophet's saying: They are entitled to what we are entitled and 
they owe what we owe. This is precisely the status that 
Jerusalem has lived under for centuries under Arab sovereignty. 
Before it was usurped, it was an Arab holy city in which the 
rights of all religions were safeguarded. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The al-Azhar imam and Pope Shanudah have 
emphasized that the Hebron massacre resulted from the weakness 
of the international institutions and that retribution is 
obligatory. What do you think? 
  [Tantawi] The Hebron massacre is a calamity and constitutes 
one of the meanest acts of treachery. I believe that it must 
not go unpunished, because all heavenly messages endorse 
retribution, which is a necessity, particularly for such an 
appalling crime. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Do you believe that the massacre has exposed 
the falsehood of the alleged peace with the Zionist enemy? 
  [Tantawi] Undoubtedly it has cast a dark shadow on the 
Middle 
East peace process and made it more difficult. At any rate, 
this makes it necessary for us to struggle [mujahadat] with our 
enemies, because we have a right to look after ourselves and 
defend ourselves relentlessly until death. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] There are calls for normalization with 
Israel 
in different ways, such as pilgrimage [to sacred sites], which 
Pope Shanudah has rejected. What do you say about such calls? 
  [Tantawi] First of all, let met tell you that I believe in 
the exchange of benefits among people, because man cannot live 
alone without cooperating with those around him. States, too, 
cannot survive without cooperating with other states. Thus, we 
welcome any exchange of benefits, but this does not mean that we 
must fall prey to deceit or that, under the slogan of narrow 
benefits, we should get involved in things that may harm our 
entity, beliefs, and sanctities by our enemies and that may 
bring evil to our country and religion. Damned are those 
benefits that may lead us to such an abyss. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The Jews claim that they are God's chosen 
people. What do you think of this claim, particularly since 
your doctorate degree was based on the "Israelites in the Koran"? 
  [Tantawi] There is nothing called God's chosen people in the 
Islamic shari'ah, the Koran, or the sunnah [tradition] of the 
Prophet. Faith and goodness are the only criteria for judging 
any people or human group. This is what the Koran has 
emphasized. As to the reference in the Koran that they [the 
Jews] were given preference over all other people, the context 
relates to a specific time and place when the Jews were 
committed to heavenly laws. Later on, no people were so 
strongly vilified in the Koran as the Jews. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How true are reports that Israelis were in 
the Fatwa Office [which passes religious rulings] (during a 
conference on religions attended by university professors, 
physicians, and clerics from the three heavenly religions)? 
  [Tantawi] I stress to you that the matter was nothing more 
than an ordinary conference. I did not know about the 
conference in advance; Dr. Jamal Madi Abu-al-'Azayim, in whom I 
have full confidence, told me about it. I do not see any reason 
why we should discuss and scrutinize the identities of those who 
attended the conference. But I emphasize to you that I did not 
know that those people were among the conferees. When I am 
asked to emphasize this, I do not mean to embarrass anyone; I 
only want to clarify the truth. However, I am fully convinced 
that the Israelis who entered the Fatwa Office by way of the 
conference did not, in any way, harm the office or what it 
symbolizes. If they had tried to do any harm, we would have 
stopped them and struck back more forcefully, and we have the 
means and ways to do it. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Some believe that the conference was an 
attempt to drag the Fatwa Office into the quagmire of 
normalization [of relations with Israel], especially that the 
al-Azhar imam has announced his full rejection of cooperation 
with Israel in any field. 
  [Tantawi] First, I am not with or against anyone; everybody 
is entitled to his opinion. But I can tell you that when the 
Fatwa Office is dragged into normalization or other things as an 
attempt to harm my religion or my country, then I will be 
available to be called to account at any time. But I believe in 
a principle that says: Do not say who visited you, but say what 
you told him. I want to tell you something else: When 
President Anwar al-Sadat visited Israel, why did the Israelis 
not say that those who received him were betrayers because they 
allowed the man to infiltrate Israel? It is not logical to 
raise these accusations because somebody visited us and in the 
context I explained. Accusations of infiltration, treason, and 
so on should not be leveled in this way. In short, I believe 
that the courageous man is the one who faces the enemy, whether 
in the enemy's house or in his own. Retreat is a kind of 
cowardliness that does not find its way to Egypt's mufti. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How do you view the growing violence in 
society, and how do you envision the way out of this full 
national crisis? 
  [Tantawi] Any act that horrifies innocent and peaceful 
people, no matter who perpetrates it, is a criminal and inhuman 
act rejected by religion and the Koran. As to the solution, I 
call for the cohesiveness and solidarity of society and 
individuals in an attempt to establish what is right and abolish 
what is wrong. There should be objectivity, honesty, and 
flexibility. We must proceed from a spirit of love for the 
homeland. If such cohesiveness is displayed, I believe God will 
guide us to the best solution to this problem because God 
certainly rewards those who do good. Security treatment alone 
is not enough; all institutions and bodies must demonstrate 
cohesiveness, as I said. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Many intellectuals and other people 
concerned 
with the phenomenon of violence believe that democracy is the 
main solution to this problem. They are urging further 
democracy. Do you agree with them? 
  [Tantawi] I personally support this demand strongly and 
persistently. I demand further democracy because democracy 
begets more democracy and awareness, justice begets justice, 
good dialogue begets good understanding, and the good word has 
its good impact on enemies and friends. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] This leads us to the so-called national 
dialogue. How does Your Eminence view this dialogue? 
  [Tantawi] I believe dialogue, especially between wise men, 
is 
the best way to persuade. I welcome dialogue as long as it is 
meant as a search for the truth regarding disputed issues. The 
Fatwa Office is open to all people, rulers and ruled, young and 
old, poor and rich for dialogue and discussion on issues with 
religious dimensions within our capabilities. I fully support 
and welcome dialogue over any issue with a view to reaching the 
truth and serving the country. But I do not favor dialogue that 
aims at boastfulness, publicity, stubbornness, and so on. 
Dialogue should be held over issues about which people have 
different views with the purpose of finding the truth; it should 
not be meant for showing off.

  [Text] Lawyer Muntasir al-Zayyat announced at the Lawyers 
Association last week the conditions of the political violence 
groups, better known as the "Islamic Group" and the "al-Jihad 
Group," for ending the acts of violence in Egypt, which 
al-Zayyat described as "reactions" to the authority's violence. 
  Al-Zayyat called for giving the "religious groups" freedom 
to 
express their opinions peacefully, unconditionally releasing all 
members of these groups who are detained, stopping referring 
defendants to military courts, and enabling what he described as 
"Islamic preachers" to practice and express their views through 
all means. 
  Al-Zayyat, a lawyer representing defendants belonging to the 
religious current, claimed that there is no animosity between 
the "Islamic groups" and Copts and that they are not against 
tourism in Egypt. He justified the recent bombings by saying 
that they were meant only to put pressure on the government. 
Al-Zayyat's remarks came in a seminar organized by the Youth 
Committee of the Lawyers Association.

  [Text] Cairo, April 7 (AFP)--A journalist working for an 
opposition fundamentalist newspaper went on trial in a military 
court near Cairo Thursday for writing an article on US arms 
sales to Egypt, sources at the newspaper said. 
  'Abd-al-Sattar Abu-Husayn, a journalist with the AL-SHA'B 
newspaper, was accused of "revealing military secrets and 
publishing information liable to provoke unrest." 
  The sources said Abu-Husayn was summoned by the military 
prosecutor Monday and questioned by military intelligence 
officers without lawyers or union representatives being present. 
  He was held at the Haikstep military base 30 kilometres (19 
miles) north of Cairo and appeared before a military court there 
Thursday. 
  The prosecutor said an article written by Abu-Husayn on 
March 
22 was based on US press allegations that retired Egyptian 
generals received millions of dollars' worth of commissions from 
US companies in exchange for arms contracts. 
  Citing US newspaper reports, Abu-Husayn said one of the 
generals, 'Ali Mansur "has close links with President Husni 
Mubarak."

  [Text] Asyut, Upper Egypt, 4 Apr (MENA)--Three terrorists 
were killed today in a clash with security forces and citizens 
in Asyut. The clash took place on the al-Ma'abidah Island in 
Markaz Manfalut, Asyut Governorate. 
  Several citizens clashed with three people, strangers to the 
island, who had weapons hidden under their clothes. When the 
three noticed that the citizens were in pursuit, they opened 
fire on them. A crowd gathered and chased them, preventing their 
escape. One of the three terrorists was wounded [as received] 
in an exchange of fire with citizens carrying licensed weapons. 
The citizens apprehended the other two terrorists to hand them 
over to the security forces who arrived on the island. When the 
two realized the security forces were approaching, they tried to 
escape, prompting the policemen to shoot them. They died 
instantly. The terrorists were found in possession of an 
automatic rifle and a pistol. The pistol belonged to a 
noncommissioned police officer who was assassinated last year. 
The Manfalut prosecutor started an investigation into the 
incident.

employee in the Modern Clothing Company in Dayrut and a member 
of the organization's military wing, took part in many acts of 
violence in the past two years. A forged identification card 
bearing the name Karam Maurice was found on him. 
  The second terrorist, Muhammad Nadi 'Abd-al-'Al Darwish, is

suspect in the assassination of noncommissioned officer Hilal 
Marzuq; Quraysh carried out the assassination personally. He 
took part in many acts of violence in various areas in Asyut. 
  The official noted that the weapons found with the 
terrorists 
included an automatic rifle, a Hulwan pistol bearing a police 
logo, and a 1.5 kg explosive charge of the same type seized from 
terrorist elements arrested on 30 March. 
  The prosecution has been notified to launch an 
investigation.

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 1 April 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Israeli Center Prepares 365 Studies on Islamists 
  2. Islamists' Activities Highlighted 
  3. Repentant Extremist's Story Refuted 
  4. Labor Party Official on Party Policy, Cultural Conflict 
<H5>  ISRAELI CENTER PREPARES 365 STUDIES ON ISLAMISTS </H5>
  In a 250-word report on page one, AL-SHA'B writes that "the 
Israeli Academic Center in Cairo has prepared about 365 studies 
on Islamic groups in Egypt, and about 2,567 researchers and 
public figures collaborated with the espionage center to prepare 
295 field studies, including one on the Labor Party and its 
questionable relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood." 
<H5>  ISLAMISTS' ACTIVITIES HIGHLIGHTED </H5>
  In a 300-word report, 'Adil al-Bahnasawi writes on pages one 
and seven that the killing of innocent people in al-Ghana'im in 
Asyut Governorate by the security forces has caused "extreme 
anger among the people." The writer adds that "until this 
incident took place last Sunday evening [27 March], al-Ghana'im 
has been outside the circle of this escalating conflict between 
the security forces and the Islamic groups." 
  Another 240-word report by 'Amir 'Id and Khalid Yunis on 
pages one and seven notes that "the Islamists scored a sweeping 
victory and all their candidates won in the pharmacists union 
elections that took place last Tuesday [29 March]." 
<H5>  REPENTANT EXTREMIST'S STORY REFUTED </H5>
  Under the headline "The Story of the Investigation's Agent 
Who has Become a Television Star," AL-SHA'B publishes on pages 
one and seven a 950-word report commenting on the television 
interview with repentant Islamic extremist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi. 
The paper says that according to reports received by AL-SHA'B, 
'Abd-al-Baqi "works for the State Security Investigations 
Service," was "planted among the Islamists to spy on them and 
collect information," and "has never been a leader and has not 
recruited 10,000 people as he claimed, but was merely a member 
in the al-Shawqiyun group." The paper says that it has 
interviewed some of those mentioned by 'Abd-al-Baqi, including 
Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Samawi who "affirmed that 'Adil 'Abd- 
al-Baqi works for the State Security Investigations Service and 
that he befriended him and got married to his sister-in-law to 
spy on him." Shaykh al-Samawi denies that 'Abd-al-Baqi was his 
student in prison or that he instilled in him the idea of 
stealing from the rich to spend on members of the group. He 
adds that when they both got out of prison, 'Abd-al-Baqi came to 
his house to apologize for his ill manners in prison and ask for 
forgiveness and to be accepted as a student, promising he would 
be a loyal and faithful student and would only get married at 
his hands. Shaykh al-Samawi then says: "I was deceived and 
thought that he came with a pure heart." 

<H5>    LABOR PARTY OFFICIAL ON PARTY POLICY, CULTURAL CONFLICT </H5>
  AL-SHA'B features a 3,600-word article on page five by 'Adil 
Husayn, former chief editor of AL-SHA'B and Labor Party 
secretary general, in which he begins by outlining the party's 
dogma. 
  Husayn says: "Under the banner of God is great, we seek to 
mobilize our people against American oppression and the 
strategic alliance between the U.S. Administration and the Jews, 
which seeks to cause strife among Muslims, humiliate us, and 
weaken us militarily, politically, and economically. 
  "The Labor Party, under the banner of God is great, is 
fighting the corrupt and illegal profiteers despite their power 
and high positions. God is stronger and higher. Yes, we fight 
the corrupt who plunder the nation's resources and hand its keys 
to the enemies. 
  "We resist the sale of national public sector companies to 
foreigners and Jews cheaply. We resist injustice, reject 
manifestations of luxury, and object to the displacement and 
impoverishment of workers and people. 
  "We reject attempts to cast doubt on Islam and on those who 
call for adherence to the Islamic shari'ah under the pretext of 
combating extremism and terrorism. We reject the spread of 
despotism, torture, indiscriminate killing, military courts, and 
death sentences en masse. We loudly declare that these methods 
will not end violence but aggravate it. 
  "All citizens and champions of freedom: You must realize 
that if you display indifference and allow the violation of your 
rights and sanctities to become a matter of principle and 
course, things will not stop with those who oppose the regime by 
force. State terrorism will reach anyone who expresses 
opposition in words. The current case against the leaders of 
the Labor Party and the editors of its newspaper is a prelude to 
something worse--all tongues will be cut and full darkness will 
prevail. 
  "The Labor Party is waging a struggle for the sake of God on 
various fronts. We ask the sons of this nation to participate 
with us in this struggle by joining our party and backing our 
policy. We ask them and ourselves to be patient, because God's 
victory is near. 
  "I say to the faithful that we must struggle and prepare the 
means for strength and victory, and then leave the rest to God's 
will. God's victory is certain to us; He does not violate His 
promise. Whether victory comes in our days or at the hands of 
those who come after us, we accept His will. But I wrote once 
and add today that the signs indicate that today's youths will 
witness the day of victory, God willing, if they strengthen 
their determination and intensify their efforts. I am not 
dreaming or imagining; I follow what is going on around us, in 
the Islamic nation and the world, and the facts and developments 
confirm the truth of what I am saying." 
  Husayn then reviews in detail a study by Samuel Huntington 
entitled "Is It a Clash Among Cultures?" which notes that the 
world is no longer composed of states but of seven or eight 
regional cultures. The conflict in the world will continue and 
perhaps intensify, not among states but among these cultures. 
The study explains how the West can deal with these cultures, 
including the Islamic awakening, and maintain its domination. 
  Husayn emphasizes the need for unity of the Islamic nation 
and strengthening of its alliance against the "Western Satan." 
He says unity can only be based on obedience to God. "It is 
against religion and country to accept the enemies' domination 
of our affairs and to befriend them." This is the duty of 
believing governments. "But even if there are weak, corrupt, or 
unbelieving governments, the people's power can force them to 
abide by God's order," he says. 
  The writer concludes that the Islamic nation can achieve its 
goals and face the Western challenge. This, he says, demands 
"patience and the ability to continue the struggle and 
sacrifice." We are on the offensive in all places to raise the 
banner of "there is no God but Allah," and through large 
physical and material sacrifices we will achieve victory. But 
what is Egypt's role in all this? "It is certain that those who 
govern in Egypt have nothing to do with this Islamic awakening. 
In fact they are deliberately trying to smother it." But they 
will fail. "Do what you like. The day of reckoning is coming. 
On our part, we will continue the struggle by legal means to 
remove you, O corrupt and impotent ones, so persons who can 
restore Egypt to its place at the heart of the Islamic 
renaissance will assume control. In this struggle, I do not 
think that trials--or anything of the sort--will deter us. It 
is a small price that we will pay willingly, hoping that God 
will bless us."

  [Text] Defense Minister Aftab Shaban Mirani has said 
Pakistan will continue to support United Nations' peace efforts 
and will continue to give its traditionally unflinching support 
to the UN's active role in the maintenance and promotion of 
world peace and security. Addressing as the special guest at a 
seminar on the UN role as a peacemaking body in Karachi 
yesterday, he said Pakistan supports the process initiated by 
the UN secretary general through his report called the peace 
agenda to strengthen and bolster the actions for peace and 
security. He said arrangements should be made to supply in 
advance arms and equipment for the safety of UN contingents in 
extremely dangerous regions and to provide information on the 
use of equipment by member countries taking part in UN 
operations.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Freezing Kashmir?"] </F>
  [Text] There has been talk for sometime of freezing the 
nuclear programme. But while we are still engaged in trying to 
figure out its implications, another trial balloon, this time of 
"freezing" the Kashmir issue, whatever that means, has gone up. 
In the context of nuclear development a whole new vocabulary of 
"capping", putting the brackes on, "freezing", "not crossing the 
red line", "rolling back", etc, has grown and come to be 
understood. But application of the same vocabulary on human 
endeavour for the achievements of their basic rights, is really 
hard to swallow. The report that Pakistan has been asked by the 
US to "freeze the Kashmir issue", leaves one dismayed. Firstly, 
because unlike its nuclear programme, Paksitan is not its sole 
motivator or controller. There are two other parties -- the 
freedom fighters and the Indian occupation troops -- neither 
under Pakistan's control, who are hardly interested in freezing 
it. The troops will continue their atrocities and the 
freedom-fighters will continue their struggle. Unless Pakistan, 
India and the Kashmiris agree to stop all their activities, 
Pakistan's unilateral halt to its diplomatic offensive would 
mean little. Secondly, the term "freezing" implies that but for 
Pakistan there would be no trouble in Kashmir. This reading of 
the situation, repeatedly projected by India, is believed by all 
that is happening today. Pakistan had, in fact, kept Kashmir 
issue on its back burner for nearly a decade, particularly 
during General Zia's rule. Pakistani leadership had then been 
persuaded by India to believe that the less important 
differences between the two countries needed to be sorted out 
first. That would, it was said, create the right climate of 
confidence-building for solving the major issue of Kashmir. It 
was the people of Kashmir who rose against that apathetic 
approach. The message they sent to both Pakistan and India was 
that they had a voice that needed to be heard. And their voice 
continues to ring loud and clear, even as their blood flows 
freely in the Valley. How can Pakistan, even if it wants to, 
put out a flame that burns in the heart of every Kashmir? 
  Pakistan was asked by the US not to raise the Kashmir issue 
in the UN General Assembly and instead talk to India. Pakistan 
complied. India used that full to crush the Kashmiris with even 
greater brutality. Then it passed a resolution in its 
Parliament to enable it to refile from its own admission of the 
status of Kashmir -- that of a disputed territory. Pakistan was 
again asked by the US (and others) not to raise the Kashmir 
issue at the UNHRC. Again Pakistan complied. India sent in 
more troops in the Valley and started killing more people on 
this side of the LOC. To keep the US beguiled, India first 
despatched its Foreign Secretary and then some non-papers to 
Pakistan. Their central theme was: "back to confidence-building 
measures". Pakistan has been bitten by that bug before. It is 
US's turn to be bitten by it. In a way it is the same approach 
as on the nuclear issue. Ask Pakistan to "cap" first then we 
will see if India follows. Now, ask Pakistan to freeze Kashmir 
first then we will see if India can be restrained from its reign 
of terror there. Someone has to be really naive to fall for 
that line again and again. Pakistan has learnt its lesson. 
Maybe the US will also learn its lesson at India's hands.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah: "Failure of the Meeting of </F>
the Two 'Ali's Increases War Possibilities"] 
  [Text] London -- Pessimism prevails in both Sanaa and Aden 
about the chances of an early settlement of the Yemeni crisis. 
Political observers expect a divisive war between the armed 
forces of the north and the south this month because the talks 
held the day before yesterday in Salalah in the Sultanate of 
Oman failed to resolve the differences between the General 
People's Congress [GPC], led by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
and its ally the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG] on the one hand 
and the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], of which Vice President 
'Ali Salim al-Bid is secretary general, on the other. 
  The YSP, however, has made a point of underscoring the 
importance of the Omani role and the continuation of efforts to 
find a solution to the Yemeni problem. A YSP official source 
has denied that al-Bid played down "the positive and effective 
role played by Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id." The source reaffirmed 
the importance "of the mediation of the brothers in Oman to 
preserve Yemen's unity." 
  News agencies quoted one of the delegation members 
accompanying al-Bid as saying that "the mediation of Sultan 
Qabus brought nothing new and the Yemeni crisis is still 
continuing." He expressed appreciation for the Omani role, of 
which all Yemenis are proud. 
  Yemeni political sources attribute the failure of the 
meeting 
to the "lack of adequate preparation for it" because the Omani 
leadership simply seized the opportunity of President Salih's 
visit to Oman and asked al-Bid to stop over on his way back from 
the United Arab Emirates [UAE] at the end of his visit to 
Abu-Dhabi. Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yusuf 
Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah said that the meeting succeeded in 
achieving some relaxation at the personal level between Salih 
and al-Bid but that this remains to be translated into a 
relaxation between the ruling coalition parties in Yemen. 
  The Omani minister said that the efforts were focused on 
preventing any military confrontations or civil war in Yemen. 
Yemeni sources, however, say that the meeting confirmed the 
conviction of both sides that "any move by one side toward the 
other to ease the crisis would be futile" and that military 
confrontation cannot be avoided. 
  The sources said that the Joint Military Committee has begun 
to terminate its task of separating the northern and southern 
armed forces and that the Jordanian and Omani officers are 
currently considering returning home, having themselves failed 
to accomplish their mission. They confirmed that the two 
parties to the conflict, namely the YSP and the GPC, imported 
$200 million worth of arms and ammunition between them during 
the month of March. The sources also said that the Yemeni 
president left the Salalah meeting angry and threatened to use 
force. 
  The two parties to the conflict are now trading accusations 
about the failure of the Oman meeting. YSP sources say that the 
cause of the failure was the intransigence of President Salih 
and his aids and also of their ally in the ruling coalition 
(meaning the YRG, led by House of Representatives Speaker Shaykh 
'Abdallah al-Ahmar), whereas GPC and YRG sources say that the 
failure to resolve the crisis was a result of disagreement 
within the YSP itself, preventing the party from taking specific 
stands. 
  Although YSP sources deny such a disagreement, it seems that 
meetings such as the ones held in Amman and Salalah have 
minimized the chances of using the Jordanian and Omani cards 
again to settle the crisis. That only leaves the Egyptian card 
with Syrian participation and Gulf support. 
  It is hoped that this card will be used very carefully 
through submission of specific plans for the settlement of the 
crisis acceptable to all Yemeni parties within the framework of 
the state of unity, even if that means applying the federal 
system. The Yemeni president and Shaykh al-Ahmar still oppose 
such a system but may find no alternative to it in the end.

  [Text] The House of Representatives met this morning under 
brother Muhammad [second name indistinct] al-Majid, member of 
the House of Representatives speakership. 
  The house heard and approved the minutes of its previous 
session. The house then discussed the latest military 
developments and repercussions of the crisis, including recent 
events in Dhamar. In light of this, the house delegated the 
Security and Defense Council and some of the brother members of 
the council to make field visits to acquaint themselves with the 
military deterioration in Abyan, Shabwah, [placename 
indistinct], and Dhamar. The committee can request any 
information from the Defense and Interior Ministries or any 
other concerned body. The committee must present its report to 
the house as soon as it expeditiously accomplishes this field 
mission. 
  As for the House of Representative's (?stand) toward the 
crisis and its repercussions, the house issued the following 
decision: 
  As it follows crisis developments, the House of 
Representatives is looking with hope and optimism toward all the 
positive aspects and serious steps to reunite institutions. The 
house views with much pain and regret those negative aspects and 
acts that harm Yemen and our unity. 
  Proceeding from the house's concern about performing its 
duty 
with full responsibility, the house has decided the following: 
  First, to reaffirm the House of Representative's statement 
on 
the crisis issued on 5 November 1993, in terms of adhering to 
national constants, foremost of which is Yemeni unity. The 
house rejects every formula that would go back or encroach on 
this unity. Whoever relinquishes any part of this unity will be 
accused of high treason. 
  The house delegates its permanent committees to follow up 
the 
implementation of the accord document based on its decision 
issued on 27 March 1994, especially the following committees: 
  A. The Defense and Security Committee will follow the 
security and military issue, especially in terms of withdrawing 
military units from the outskirts, deploying them in areas with 
vital targets and the strategic defense requirements of the 
Republic of Yemen, as well as to prevent other forces' 
deployment or movement, except within the framework of the 
process of redeployment and merger according to the accord 
document. The committee will start work today. 
  B. The Financial Affairs Committee will follow up the budget 
and will make sure sovereign revenues reach the Yemeni Central 
Bank. 
  C. The Public Liberties and Human Rights Committee will 
follow up what was delegated to it previously. 
  D. The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee will 
implement the law on procedures to try senior state officials 
based on Articles 101 and 111 of the Constitution. 
  E. The Media Committee will follow up media deterioration. 
  Second, the house delegates the speakership and bloc leaders 
to follow up crisis political developments and to brief the 
house on these developments. 
  Fourth [as heard], the House of Representatives hopes that 
27 
April 1994 will be a day of national salvation in which the 
entire situation becomes stable, all crises and their 
repercussions end, and all government institutions reunite in 
Sanaa, the capital of the country of unity. 
  Fifth, all the state's executive bodies and their leadership 
at all levels should shoulder their responsibilities. The 
crisis cannot be allowed to obstruct work or prevent the 
government from executing its programs and running the state's 
affairs. 
  Sixth, the House of Representatives appreciates the brothers 
and friends who are exerting efforts to mend the rift and 
maintain Yemeni unity. 
  The house will resume its meetings on Saturday [9 April] 
morning, God willing.

    [Editorial Report] Sanaa Republic of Yemen Radio Network in 
Arabic, in a linkup with the Arabic Service of the BBC, at 1505 
GMT on 7 April carries a 55-minute live phone-in program from 
Sanaa with Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of 
the Yemeni Presidential Council. President Salih responds to 
telephoned questions and comments from an international 
audience. The program is moderated by the BBC's Madihah 
al-Madfa'i. 
  Responding to a caller from Tunisia, Salih says that since 
the signing of the accord document in Amman on 20 February he 
has been striving with his coalition partners in the Yemeni 
Socialist Party (YSP) to implement the document. He says he 
regrets his efforts have "met with a lukewarm response from 
certain YSP leaders." 
  Commenting on explosions in Dhamar Governorate "at 2000 
yesterday", Salih calls it a "transparent game," calculated to 
create problems to justify opening indiscriminate fire on 
bystanders and nearby camps, including those of the Republican 
Guard and Public Security forces. The aim, President Salih 
contends, was to "create tension" and bring about the relocation 
of military forces from north to south and vice versa, as 
"envisaged by certain YSP leaders." Salih adds that he "had 
given instructions for military units not to respond with a 
single bullet." He notes with satisfaction that there were no 
casualties, apart from two members of the security forces 
injured trying to subdue a YSP member who attempted to break the 
law. Both he and 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Salih notes, followed 
developments personally and calmed the situation. The military 
committee then moved to the Dhamar Governorate to investigate 
the situation. 
  Responding to a listener from Syria, who voices fears of the 
Yemeni issue being internationalized in a manner similar to the 
Gulf crisis, Salih says every effort is being made to contain 
the crisis, but regrets that some members of the YSP want to see 
the Yemeni crisis turned into a pan-Arab concern. Salih 
stresses, however, that he has no objection to "our brothers in 
the Arab world lending a hand" to the solution of the crisis. 
We are striving, he says, to contain the crisis and keep it 
from internationalization, a prospect he calls "very dangerous." 
  Asked by a listener calling from Yemen to spell out the 
underlying causes of the Yemeni crisis, the president says the 
causes are well known and that they began to emerge after the 27 
April parliamentary elections. He maintains that some YSP 
members, who initially went along with the election returns, 
"began to act so as to bring considerable harm to the Yemeni 
people and national unity." 
  Taking a question from another Tunisian caller, Salih says 
the first days of Yemeni unity may have provided an admirable 
example for the Arab world to follow. But "we feared that our 
unity was bound to be targeted for conspiracies." The question 
was, Salih adds: "Who would implement such a plan?" "We 
believe a conspiracy is being implemented by the very authors of 
the unity." Those who brought harm and caused cracks in 
national Yemeni unity, he regrets, belong in the camp of the 
"makers of this great event." 
  Salih exhorts "our brothers and partners" in the coalition 
government to avert military conflict that will cause 
considerable damage to the national economy and national unity. 
He recalls that Yemenis had a taste of infighting in 1972 and 
again in 1979, in both cases the "winner was the loser." Only 
the enemies of the homeland and Arab unity stand to gain from 
infighting, Salih asserts. 
  Answering another caller from Yemen, President Salih 
describes his meeting with Yemeni leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid in 
Salalah as "positive on a personal plane" but not so in terms of 
the Yemeni crisis, especially since "new conditions running 
counter to the pledge and accord document were put forward." 
The president suggests that the YSP is trying to circumvent the 
Constitution and the accord document, which neither he nor the 
Yemeni people find acceptable. 
  'Abbas Bin-Hamid-al-Din, who identifies himself as a Yemeni 
national living in Cairo, proposes the expansion of the 
Political Forces Dialogue Committee to include men belonging to 
the Hamid-al-Din family, which previously ruled Yemen, to defuse 
the ongoing crisis, Yemeni President Salih says: "I believe 
that the Hamid-al-Din family contributed to the Yemeni crisis, 
because it has left us a burdensome legacy. It is part of this 
crisis. We have continued to pay a price, thanks to the 
policies pursued by the Hamid-al-Din family, and the British 
colonial rule." 
  Responding to a question from a caller in Saudi Arabia 
regarding the need for President Salih and Vice President al-Bid 
to demonstrate flexibility to "avert endless civil wars," Yemeni 
President Salih says: "We, along with all well-intentioned 
people in the homeland, will do our best to resolve and contain 
this crisis so as to safeguard unity. This crisis is the price 
we are paying for this national accomplishment. We, along with 
all patriots and well-intentioned people throughout the Yemeni 
homeland, are determined to safeguard unity." 
  Muhammad al-Bid, a Yemeni national in Riyadh, poses the 
following question to Yemeni President Salih: "Let us say that 
the country is divided, God forbid. Will Yemen relive the 
situation currently experienced by Somalia, which is going 
through immense fighting, chaos, and anarchy?" 
  President Salih answers this question, saying: "We are 
optimistic that no civil wars will erupt. All patriots and 
honorable people inside and outside the homeland are careful to 
prevent the eruption of a civil war. We are doing our utmost to 
avert this eventuality. We will certainly contain this crisis. 
In the first months of the crisis, many provocations took 
place. Those who planned this crisis believed that a war would 
erupt in the initial stages of the crisis. Nonetheless, we have 
endured a lot to thwart these schemes, which seek to bring about 
a civil war, or return the situation to pre-May 20, 1990." 
  Responding to a question by Ahmad Nasir al-Juraydi, a Yemeni 
national from the Central Republic of Africa, Yemeni President 
Salih says: "Security violations have been exaggerated by the 
media. There are some security violations everywhere. Most of 
these are criminal security-related violations. Some of these 
violations are committed by culprits to distort Yemeni unity, 
and tarnish the image of the Yemeni people. However, the Yemeni 
people are keen to safeguard their security and stability. The 
security organs are conducting their duties and pursuing those 
who are committing security violations." 
  Caller 'Abdallah Salih al-Yafi'i from Mecca, Saudi Arabia, 
holds President Salih, Vice President al-Bid, and the entire 
Yemeni command structure responsible for the crisis. President 
Salih responds: "Since the inception of the crisis, we have 
made many concessions to safeguard Yemeni unity. For example, 
we did not show a determination to obtain a share in authority 
commensurate with the results we achieved in the parliamentary 
elections to the House of Representatives. We have abandoned 
some seats, and some pivotal authority positions in favor of our 
brothers within the coalition government, including the prime 
minister's post and a seat on the Presidential Council. These 
are concessions. It is no mistake if we makes concessions to 
one another, and to brothers, to resolve this crisis. We have 
even offered our brothers within the YSP to quit if we are 
deemed one of the causes of the crisis, so that a new leadership 
may be elected, and so that the Yemeni unity may remain intact." 
He mentions a proposal contained in a bill to be submitted to 
the House of Representatives stipulating that the president of 
the Republic may serve only two terms in office. He deems all 
these as concessions benefiting the Yemeni people. 
  Responding to a question posed by 'Abd-al- 'Aziz Salih 
al-Mafqari from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, President Salih says the 
failure to send to court suspects charged in connection with a 
series of explosions and assassinations can be traced to the 
fact that some of them remain at large, while others are being 
interrogated by the Public Prosecution department. He adds: 
"We would like to address our YSP command brothers, saying that 
security agencies and all state bodies must be reactivated so 
that the state, including its defense, security, legislative, 
and executive bodies, may all function as a single team." 
  President Salih adds: "God willing, the pre-May 22 situation 
will not relived. Nor shall we condone infighting. This is a 
political decision that I have made in my capacity as chairman 
of the Yemeni Presidential Council. I have decided that I will 
not allow infighting among the sons of the close-knit Yemeni 
people, regardless of the provocations, and regardless of what 
has happened. Had we been people without any sense of 
responsibility, we would have been dragged to infighting, and to 
a repartitioning of the country, which has been planned. 
However, all these schemes have been thwarted." 
  Answering a question from Farid Ahmad Mubarak Juhayman in 
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, who urges Yemeni President Salih and Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid to tender their resignations so 
others may address Yemeni affairs, President Salih says: "I 
informed brother 'Ali Salim, in Amman, that if the dispute is 
personal, that is, one between the president and his deputy, 
then I was ready to tender my resignation so a replacement might 
be elected by the House of Representatives." 
  President Salih maintains that the root causes of the crisis 
cannot be addressed by the mere resignation of leaders. He 
adds: "If the resignation of the president and his deputy would 
save the Yemeni people, then we would be ready to tender our 
resignations. But, I am afraid that such resignations might 
aggravate and exacerbate the crisis, and lead to a civil war." 
  When asked by a caller from Riyadh about the frustration 
plaguing the Yemeni people because of their sufferings, thanks 
to the ongoing crisis, Yemeni President Salih denies that the 
coalition government is surviving by fabricating and managing 
crises. 
  Answering a question on an alleged British role in the 
Yemeni 
crisis, and whether Britain has given the YSP the green light to 
effect a repartitioning of the country so Britain may benefit 
from oil revenues, given the fact that it has oil prospecting 
firms operating in Yemen, President Salih says: "We do not want 
to make accusations against anybody. We urge all our brothers, 
all our beloved ones in the Arab homeland, in the Islamic world, 
and in friendly states to aid the Yemeni people during the 
ordeal fabricated by some people, the ordeal that has immensely 
harmed our national unity. We will not make any accusations 
unless we have documents to corroborate such accusations. There 
are numerous rumors around, and so are propaganda campaigns 
targeting this or that country. However, we must be in full 
charge of our own affairs. This is better than having our own 
affairs decided by other officials, be they British, Americans, 
other foreigners, or other Arabs. We, Yemenis, are the people 
who must be in full charge of our own affairs." 
  President Salih goes on to say: "This crisis is part of the 
schemes planned by some YSP leaders within the context of the 
so- called cultural plan. The Yemeni crisis is the very 
cultural plan they have spoken of. We have never wished to air 
such words over the media. But, regrettably, this is the 
cultural plan they are promoting to move the emotions of laymen, 
simpletons, and those who do not read between the lines with 
regard to this issue." 
  Responding to a caller from Morocco, President Salih hopes 
that "unity-oriented Arabs" will not turn Yemen into a 
battleground for settling differences that surfaced before and 
during the Gulf crisis. He hopes they will help Yemenis contain 
this crisis. 
  The program concludes at 1600 GMT.

<F P=106> [Report by Amjad Mu'alla] </F>
  [Text] Yemeni Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has 
called on Jordan to continue its good offices to help Yemen 
overcome its crisis, and emphasized that the Yemeni leadership 
is eager to implement the accord document that was signed in 
Amman. 
  In a telephone interview with AL-DUSTUR in Aden yesterday, 
he 
emphasized that Jordan has played, and is still playing, a very 
important role in calming the situation in Yemen, whether 
through its active participation in the joint military committee 
or through its relentless efforts to bring the views of the 
conflicting parties closer together. 
  On the recent meeting between Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah 
Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Salalah, al-'Attas 
said the meeting achieved good results and the president and his 
deputy managed, in their closed meeting, to discuss a host of 
issues concerning the situation in Yemen and reached practical 
solutions for these issues. 
  He added: We hope that this meeting will open the way for 
convening other meetings at the level of Yemeni leadership. The 
Yemeni prime minister emphasized that the meeting between the 
president and his deputy is in itself a national achievement. 
  Answering a question on the possibility of a military 
explosion in Yemen in light of the charges exchanged by the 
parties regarding shipments of weapons to Yemen, al-'Attas 
emphasized that all parties in Yemen do not want the situation 
to reach the point of explosion, and all are prepared to do 
whatever they can to avoid bloodshed. 
  The Yemeni prime minister said the situation is improving in 
Yemen, and stressed that the government meeting, planned to be 
held in Ta'zz today will take place and will discuss 
implementation of decisions made by the previous government 
meeting held in Aden. These decisions focussed on implementation 
of the accord document. 
  He added that the government will adopt a number of other 
decisions to complete the mechanism through which the document 
will be implemented. 
  Meanwhile, AL-DUSTUR made a telephone contact with Ahmad 
Jabir 'Afif, chairman of the Yemeni national dialogue committee, 
in which he emphasized that solving the Yemeni crisis is in the 
hands of the Yemenis, and this can be done through implementing 
the accord document. 
  'Afif said the committee, which was formed from outside the 
ruling coalition parties, unanimously agrees that the accord 
document should be implemented, and that it is useless to go 
anywhere outside Yemen. 
  'Afif criticized the ruling coalition for ignoring the 
national dialogue committee at this stage and for not informing 
the committee of developments. 
  He said that during its today's meeting, the committee will 
discuss the practices of the coalition partners, and will convey 
its view to the coalition leaders. He emphasized that these 
practices have absented the role of the dialogue committee, and 
the committee became unaware of what is going on. He said the 
committee does not know in whose interest it is being absented.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan by </F>
'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad in Baghdad; date not given] 
  [Text] [Muhammad] The economic embargo against Iraq has 
been in force for three years. What are the causes and results 
of this embargo and how are you facing the hardship, such as 
prices and inflation soaring madly? 
  [Ramadan] The unjust embargo imposed on Iraq on 6 August 
1991 
is entering its fourth year, making it the first in the entire 
world. Any embargo launched against any country in the last 
half of this century for any reason does not compare with the 
unjust embargo imposed on Iraq in the name of international 
legitimacy under the hegemony of the United States. The embargo 
is being enforced under stark and direct American threats to the 
nations of the world. No one cared about the humanitarian 
aspect (medicine and food) of this unjust embargo, which is not 
covered by the Security Council resolutions. 
  The way the embargo was implemented and followed up on 
reflected the intentions of those who imposed it, foremost of 
which was the United States. It has become clear that the 
implementation of the embargo has nothing to do with the reason 
they gave; that is, Kuwait. The objective of the blockade, 
obviously, is to stop Iraq's progress, which represents the 
beginning of the Arab nation's progress. Had Iraq's position 
proceeded only from its own interests, the country would not 
have been dealt with so brutally. They know full well that 
Iraq's development will benefit the Arab nation, no matter how 
far they go in promoting borders and regionalism. 
  The embargo will erode and be smashed through the 
capabilities of society, and it will be lifted completely when 
the enemies realize that it is impossible to achieve their 
objectives. In our confrontation, we rely above all on our own 
capabilities. From the first day of the aggression and the 
embargo, and despite their claims that it would be lifted when 
the fighting ended or the reason was removed, we did not trust 
the party who made the decision because it was made for 
conspiratorial purposes and that party planned to maintain it. 
We did not await a decision ending the embargo from the same 
party that imposed it. Yes, today, we are making intensive 
efforts to build our capabilities and to face the basic 
dilemmas. The main planner of the embargo wanted to deprive our 
citizens of fuel, electricity, and water. These are three basic 
things that would exhaust the resistance of any country in a few 
months. But in only a few weeks, our capabilities managed to 
restore fuel, electricity, and water. I do not think that there 
is a country in our region (and I do not say the world, so that 
I will not be accused of exaggeration) where the situation of 
water, electricity, and fuel in terms of price, competence, and 
power, matches that of Iraq, although those facilities were 
deliberately attacked by the colonialist alliance. We began and 
continued to reconstruct everything that was destroyed, not only 
the projects dealing with water, electricity, and fuel. We can 
say today that the building of the economic structure is better 
in Iraq than in any other country in the region. If we compare 
situations in the region's states with that of besieged Iraq, we 
will find that Iraq's is much better. 
  Now that we have overcome many problems and dilemmas, our 
main burden remains food and medicine, which raised inflation 
greatly. This is frequently natural. We cannot say why 
inflation in Iraq today is high; we do not know the reason. We 
cannot say if the reason is a faulty economic structure or the 
wrong economic development policy. 
  Inflation in Iraq is going up as it is in other Arab 
countries that are neither in a state of war nor under an unjust 
blockade; countries that, moreover, claim good relations with 
the entire world and friendship with the world capitalist 
countries and the countries that protect and run international 
funds that provide loans, grants, and aid. Nevertheless, those 
countries face higher inflation rate than Iraq. 
  We managed to provide better living conditions for the 
Iraqis. Our current crisis has a time limit that is mainly 
linked to the promotion of the agricultural sector and the 
provision of most basic foodstuffs, which play a major role in 
inflation. At the same time, we have in mind a host of measures 
and are now implementing them gradually, to prolong the 
steadfastness of the Iraqis against the American international 
conspiracy. We trust that the harmful effects of the economic 
blockade on many countries will start to appear--if they have 
not already appeared. These countries include Turkey, Russia, 
France, and many other countries that began to speak about the 
impact of the blockade on them and about their financial losses 
as a result of implementing the embargo against Iraq. They are 
demanding that this embargo be reconsidered. Of course, had the 
Iraqis not held out and continued building and construction, the 
impact of the blockade on the entire foreign scene would not 
have been felt. Stopping the economy and development in Iraq is 
an extremely serious issue that will negatively affect many 
countries, not only Iraq. We will overcome the blockade, and by 
doing so, we will not be merely passing a crisis but embarking 
on new breakthroughs and progress. 
  [Muhammad] We have seen and sensed many major achievements 
in 
the area of construction, but perhaps the most important one is 
the progress in agricultural development. Why this turn toward 
agriculture? What kind of facilities have you offered to 
citizens? Are you facing any obstacles in this field? 
  [Ramadan] As you know, ancient Iraq was called the land of 
fertility, not only the land of Mesopotamia. This means Iraq is 
distinguished from many countries. No single inch of Iraq is 
unfit for agriculture, and as they say, no single inch 
underground does not contain oil. Iraq is very rich in arable 
land but there are some problems. Some agricultural areas are 
highly salty and need reclamation, others need irrigation 
projects, others need facilities to get water through, and 
others need unconventional irrigation techniques. But in 
principle, all Iraqi lands, including the desert area on the 
Iraqi-Jordanian border, are suitable for agriculture and for the 
growing of grains in particular. 
  I do not say that the February 1968 revolution was not 
concerned with the agricultural sector, but practically the 
revolution did not turn all attention to that sector because of 
the availability of other resources, especially oil, and the 
ease with which many foodstuffs could be imported. We admit 
that we did not push our agricultural sector as strongly as it 
should have been. One of the most important results of the 
blockade and of the Mother of all Battles, therefore, was giving 
top priority to agriculture within the reconstruction process. 
This is why you now find three major dams being constructed at 
the same time with Iraqi resources. Despite the blockade, there 
are a number of large- scale reclamation projects. I tell you 
that at the best times, when Iraq used to receive billions in 
revenue, you could not find three dams under construction at the 
same time. 
  Because there is extensive land reclamation, there are great 
facilities in the ownership of land. We put no restriction on 
the ownership of land. Previously, we said that the owner must 
be a peasant and from the region where the land is located. Now 
we give land and provide several facilities to any Iraqi 
citizen, peasant or not, as soon as he shows readiness to work 
in agriculture. We bear in mind that if the profits of the 
agricultural sector are not good, people will not be interested. 
As you know, 90 percent of the effort in the commercial sector 
is parasitic and nonproductive. Yet, many countries provide 
facilities for commerce, and you find many people getting into 
it and lines of brokers appearing. In agricultural and 
industrial sectors, on the other hand, you find hindrances and 
obstacles. Therefore, we offered many facilities in buying 
lands, seeds, machinery, and fertilizers. People were 
encouraged and responsive, and today we have made major strides 
in this area. In the next two years, when a number of dams and 
reclamation projects currently under implementation are 
completed, Iraq will see a radical and decisive development in 
the area of agriculture. We will not be satisfied with planting 
in only the land around the two rivers; we will plant in desert 
lands, beginning with the oases on the road between al-Anbar and 
Jordan. We insist on this policy even after the lifting of the 
unjust blockade; we must achieve self-sufficiency in food, and 
the agricultural sector must join that of minerals in the field 
of exports. 
  [Muhammad] Intense and complicated talks have been going on 
for seven months between Iraq and the UN special committee 
headed by Rolf Ekeus to look into the economic blockade. These 
talks seem to be facing numerous difficulties that threaten them 
with failure. What are the United Nations' real conditions for 
lifting the blockade on Iraq and what are the difficulties 
facing Rolf Ekeus' committee? What is your assessment of the UN 
plan to export Iraqi oil? 
  [Ramadan] Frankly, if the malicious and conspiratorial 
intentions of the United States, in particular, come to an end, 
you would find no problem between Iraq and the UN committee. 
The situation is obvious, and we have complied with the 
Security Council resolutions although we were disgusted by them. 
Thus, the blockade and problems should have ended long ago but 
the Americans' malicious intentions, provoked by Zionism, 
prevented this from happening. 
  The United States places impediments and obstacles to the 
committee's work to foil its tasks. We do not look forward to 
the lifting of the blockade through the resumption of Iraqi oil 
exports according to the UN-proposed plan, which is another form 
of blockade against Iraq that causes psychological harm to the 
citizens. Yes, we want the blockade to be lifted and oil 
exports to be resumed but only in a manner that does not harm 
our independence and national sovereignty. We want Iraq to sell 
and buy without intervention by any power in its affairs. As 
for the current plan to resume oil exports according to their 
own way, it is rejected because it constitutes a flagrant 
intervention in our affairs and sovereignty. 
  [Muhammad] U.S. aircraft have penetrated Iraqi airspace 
numerous times. What is the truth and aims of these violations? 
Will the Iraqi response in the future be confined to forwarding 
memoranda of denunciation to the United Nations and the Security 
Council as is the case now? 
  [Ramadan] We will examine the situation in the proper time 
and have a response to them, God willing. These violations 
provide new evidence and indications for those far and near to 
know what America exactly wants and whether it sponsors peace or 
terrorism. 
  We say facts indicate that the United States, which claims 
to 
be fighting terrorism, sponsors it everywhere. We assert that 
the U.S. aircrafts' violation of Iraqi airspace is a violation 
of Iraq's sovereignty and independence. I wonder, isn't a state 
that violates the sovereignty of another state a leader and 
advocate of terrorism? Where is international legitimacy, the 
Security Council, and the United Nations and why do we not hear 
their voices? 
  [Muhammad] The situation in northern Iraq is extremely 
ambiguous. What exactly is happening there and what is your 
assessment of the situation now after the establishment of a 
Kurdish government there? 
  [Ramadan] We cannot say that there is a Kurdish state or 
government in the north. The Iraqi Administration, troops, 
organizations, and institutions have withdrawn from the north of 
our own free will. We were certain that the United States and 
the allies wanted to exhaust Iraq's power and capability for 
steadfastness, construction, and development by keeping us busy 
in a war with their agents in the north. They wanted to exhaust 
our power, so we avoided the trap they set for us. Now the real 
identity of the Israeli and U.S. agents in the north has become 
clear to our people there. The presence of these Kurdish agents 
in the north today depends on the presence of U.S. troops in 
Turkey, whose mandate there has been renewed for another six 
months. It is now obvious that the presence of the U.S. troops, 
better known as the "Hammer," is to protect the Kurdish agents 
in the north. The day the U.S. troops leave, the ordinary Kurds 
will kick these agents out of the Iraqi land for good. Let me 
assure you that what is happening now in the north is not a 
permanent situation but part of the series of schemes against 
Iraq. 
  [Muhammad] The foreign media continue to report problems in 
southern Iraq and in the marshes. What exactly is the situation 
there? 
  [Ramadan] The situation in the south and the marshes is 
completely safe. Not only is it normal, it is better than good. 
I invite you to visit the south to see for yourself. (N.B.) 
[newspaper-supplied editorial note] I embarked on a 
journalistic fact-finding mission in southern Iraq for two days, 
during which I was convinced that things there are normal and 
calm. 
  [Muhammad] The human rights organizations, especially 
Amnesty 
International and the Arab Organization for Human Rights, say 
that there are executions, arrests, and violations of human 
rights in Iraq, particularly against the merchants, that the 
Iraqi leadership is behind. They also note that Iraq is yet to 
see any radical improvement in the field of public freedom, 
political pluralism, and real press freedom. What is your 
comment on this? 
  [Ramadan] These organizations are either agents, 
implementing 
suspicious schemes, or ignorant about the facts and the 
situation in Iraq. Iraq has entered a war with all the 
conspiratorial countries in the world, and the war is 
continuing. Up to now, Iraq has not introduced any emergency 
measures, although it is facing an aggression and an unjust 
embargo. However, if there are false tears, concern, and fear 
for the merchants, let me stress to you that we will detain and 
pass the people's sentence against any merchant who tampers with 
or hoards the people's food. In the law of God and humanity, he 
who strips the people of their food must be beheaded. I wonder: 
What merchants do the human rights groups mean? Shall we give 
freedom to merchants who tamper with the people's fate and means 
of livelihood? What do the Arab governments do to merchants who 
tamper with their peoples' means of sustenance? The Arab 
governments, which are part of this aggression and the embargo, 
as well as the unjust merchants are now shedding false tears 
over the execution of the corrupt merchants. We grant honest 
merchants major facilities to work honestly, but we pursue 
whoever tries to starve the people. This is our policy. If 
this policy runs counter to so-called democracy, then we reject 
this democracy because we have a responsibility to the people. 
  As for political pluralism, we have issued a law on it and 
anyone who wants to form a party can come forward. But we want 
parties that think about what to do for Iraq under its current 
circumstances; parties that struggle, bear full responsibility, 
and offer something new, not engage in one-upmanship for power. 
  We issued a law on pluralism before the blockade but no 
party 
has come forward; this is due to Iraq's current circumstances. 
Once the blockade is over, Iraq will witness actual and real 
implementation of the pluralism law, but now we are in a state 
of war. 
  [Muhammad] Currently, there is talk that Arab popular 
movements and organizations are retreating from solidarity with 
Iraq. What is your comment on this and what is currently 
required of the Arab popular movements and organizations in the 
context of their solidarity with Iraq? 
  [Ramadan] The popular movement in the Arab arena is growing 
enormously today. As for the situation at the official level, 
it is wavering, at the best of times, and conspiratorial at 
other times. The official Arab stand is conspiratorial and 
undoubtedly casts its shadow on the popular situation. Had the 
official stand toward Iraq not been so, the popular stand would 
have been different from what it is now and would have 
demonstrated great and true solidarity with us. 
  We are not mistaken about the Arab citizen's beliefs and 
convictions toward us, but the official policies hamper his 
solidarity with us. Hence, we should not accuse the popular 
political organizations and parties of something that is not 
their fault and ignore the official stand and its pressure and 
effects on these organizations and parties. 
  [Muhammad] Our Arab region is experiencing serious and 
crucial developments--foremost of which is the settlement to 
liquidate the Palestinian cause--that cause Iraq's crisis not to 
be placed on the agenda of Arab efforts and moves. How do you 
assess this situation and the Gaza-Jericho accord? 
  [Ramadan] We have a principled and historical view of the 
Palestinian issue linked with the tenet of the Socialist Ba'th 
Party that leads the government and people in Iraq. Iraq's 
stand is obvious and public; that is to say we will not give an 
inch of the Palestinian territories. However, Iraq is currently 
experiencing a historical situation that forces it not to be 
vociferous about the issue; but this will not change our stand a 
bit. 
  Giving dialogues and meetings for the capitulatory 
settlement 
precedence over Iraq's cause or the blockade is something 
natural because the "ramshackle" collection of Arab states 
described as conspiring and wavering are making use of the 
current phase of the Palestinian cause. I wonder what the Arab 
countries have done on the blockade on Iraq? 
  We will never forget that the first forum to beat the war 
drums and declare war on Iraq was the Cairo conference. This 
conference gave a legitimate cover to the UN Security Council 
resolutions. We will also not forget that your party was the 
first that issued a statement denouncing the Cairo conference 
before the Egyptian and Arab public. It is not strange to see 
that there is great interest in carrying out the capitulatory 
political settlement, exploiting for this purpose the current 
poor Arab circumstances, particularly Iraq's circumstances. If 
Iraq's circumstances were different, the Arab situation would be 
very different too. Is it not very strange to find some Arab 
countries speaking of abolishing the Arab economic boycott of 
Israel but not saying anything about abolishing the unjust 
blockade against Iraq? Indeed these countries are demanding that 
this blockade be tightened. This illustrates the extent of the 
current deterioration, complacency, and conspiracy in official 
Arab circles. 
  [Muhammad] What is your opinion of the stance adopted by the 
Palestinian leadership--the PLO--on the Gaza-Jericho agreement? 
  [Ramadan] I do not believe that there is such a thing as a 
Palestinian leadership today; not after all that has happened. 
There is a stance adopted by some individuals who will bear the 
responsibility for what they are doing. If we think of the PLO 
as the Palestinian leadership, then we must remember that more 
than half of the PLO's members are not around anymore. Some 
have resigned, some have adopted completely different positions. 
It is clear that the decisions that are being made now are not 
decisions agreed on during PLO meetings but those made solely by 
the PLO chairman and some other members who do not represent 
that organization. We assure everyone that the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement blocks all the ways to liberate Palestinian land in 
the future. This agreement contradicts the goals of the 
Palestinian cause. We find no future promise in all the 
agreements on Gaza and Jericho. We see in these agreements an 
end of the Palestinian cause as far as the enemies and the 
complacent ones who have tired of the struggle are concerned. 
The Palestinian people, however, will never forget their land 
and sovereignty. 
  [Muhammad] What are the latest developments on the Iraqi- 
Iranian scene? Why have the public and covert negotiations 
between the two countries failed? 
  [Ramadan] We have two unresolved issues with Iran: the POW 
issue, on which nothing new has happened, and the Iraqi planes 
in Iran. Intermediaries are trying to work out the second issue 
but nothing concrete has happened. Unless these two issues are 
settled, we can have no normal relations with Iran. 
  [Muhammad] Are there any new developments regarding the ties 
with Egypt? 
  [Ramadan] After we established interest sections here and in 
Egypt to handle the affairs of our and their citizens, nothing 
new happened. We welcome Egyptian nationals here and protect 
their interests and rights.

  [Text] The Hague -- The environment committee of the 
multilateral Middle East peace negotiations met for one day of 
talks in the Hague today, Thursday. 
  Informed Foreign Ministry sources said Jordan did not send 
an 
official delegation to the session because we are still awaiting 
Washington's decision on the Port of al-'Aqabah blockade, 
anticipated this week. 
  Jordan, sources told AL-RA'Y, sent its ambassador in Rome 
Hasan Abu-Na'imah to the Hague meeting as an observer rather 
than participant.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "'Afula Operation Outshines All Expressions of </F>
Condemnation"] 
  [Text] It was natural that the Palestinian people's 
reaction to the "massacre of the age" perpetrated by Zionsts at 
the Ibrahimi Mosque be commensurate with its savagery. Hence 
the remarkable act of martyrdom effected by a Palestinian youth 
in 'Afula yesterday, 40 days after the Hebron carnage. 
  The Palestinian people's struggle using all means at their 
disposal is a legitimate act sanctioned by all divine and 
temporal laws. It is an action undertaken to uphold stolen 
national rights and to retaliate for the massacres and 
horrendous crimes committed against the Palestinian people over 
decades. Yesterday's reprisal was, therefore, a legitimate act 
of jihad; the Palestinian blood spilled on a daily basis by the 
gunfire of the Israeli occupiers is not as cheap as the enemy 
imagines. Every drop of blood spilled on the land of Palestine 
will kindle the spirit of challenge and heroism and nurture the 
values of courage and martyrdom typical of this great people who 
have endured the ugliest injustice in the modern age. 
  If the decline in Arab fortunes and the exceptional 
circumstances the Arab nation is going through are casting their 
shadow on the Palestinian cause, and have put the Arabs in an 
unenviable position in relation to the Israeli arrogance, the 
downturn is temporary, and may tempt some to think that 
statements of condemnation and denunciation are the only weapons 
we have. The truth, however, is that coercion, injustice, and 
humiliation are bound to erupt into an explosion. Our 
frustrations are something like a layer of ashes over a 
smoldering fire. 
  Jordan has often enough warned about the risks involved in 
Israel's repressive and terroristic tactics in the occupied Arab 
territories and the brazen breaches of the human rights of the 
Palestinians under occupation. His majesty has also sounded a 
note of warning that violence only begets violence. 
  The only way out of the tension gripping the region and the 
Palestinian territory in particular is the institution of a 
just, comprehensive, and enduring peace predicated on the 
land-for-peace formula and UN Security Council Resolutions 242 
and 338. Any agreements that foster injustice and do not meet 
these requirements have no chance. 
  The 'Afula act of martyrdom should sound the alarm to the 
permanent members of the UN Security Council, in particular the 
United States, that they need to pressure Israel to show more 
responsiveness to UN resolutions if it is serious about peace.

  [Text] Amman (INA) -- The Jordanian Arab Socialist Ba'th 
Party- Higher Command has called on the Arab countries involved 
in the settlement with the Zionist entity to stop and 
immediately end the negotiations. 
  In a statement distributed in Amman yesterday, the party 
said 
that reality has proven that these negotiations constitute a 
danger to established Arab national rights. The party called 
for escalating the struggle by all ways and means in order to 
break the back of the aggressors who seek to dominate the Arab 
nation and plunder its resources. 
  The statement also explains that the continuation of the 
unjust blockade, which the United States and its allies have 
imposed on the Iraqi people for more than four years, is only 
aimed at subjugating great Iraq and its brave people to the 
policy of hegemony pursued by the U.S. Administration and its 
followers. 
  The statement refers to the piracy of U.S. fleets in 
inspecting, with various weak excuses and arguments, ships 
heading toward the Jordanian port of al-'Aqabah, whether they 
are at sea or in Arab territorial waters. 
  The statement notes that this situation has created a siege 
on Jordan and has done great harm and damage to its economy and 
to national and pan-Arab interests.

  [Excerpts] At around 1915, the official Lebanese-Spanish 
talks ended. They were chaired on the Lebanese side by Foreign 
Minister Faris Buwayz. [passage omitted] 
  The Spanish side to the talks was chaired by Spanish Foreign 
Minister Javier Solana. [passage omitted] 
  Afterward, Buwayz made the following statement: 
  [Begin recording] [Buwayz] We held a first round of talks 
with the Spanish foreign minister and his delegation. The talks 
touched on the situation in the Middle East, which is high on 
the list of priorities of the foreign minister's visit. We also 
addressed bilateral relations, in particular the economic and 
cultural ties between Lebanon and Spain. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Minister, did Solana brief you on the 
results 
of his meetings in Cairo with President Mubarak and 'Arafat? 
And have you received any indications that the peace process is 
moving forward? 
  [Buwayz] The minister's visit to Lebanon falls within the 
framework of a complete tour of the Middle East region. It 
seems he met Egyptian and Palestinian officials as well as some 
others. I sensed from the minister--and I hope this is 
true--that he is optimistic about the possibility of progress in 
the talks. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] After his meeting with Foreign Minister Faris 
Buwayz, Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said that Lebanon 
is an important country in the region. He stressed the need to 
strengthen ties between Lebanon and Spain. He emphasized his 
country's commitment to the peace process in the Middle East. 
He hoped that the process that was launched from Madrid will 
continue. He said that discussion of the peace process is one 
of the goals of his visit to Lebanon. He noted Spanish-Lebanese 
understanding about reaching a fair solution to the Middle East 
problem. He pointed out that Minister Buwayz broached several 
points and Spain supports Lebanon's position on the peace 
negotiations, particularly implementation of Security Council 
Resolution 425. On the conditions required to make the peace 
process successful, Solana said: There is a working framework 
for negotiations on all tracks. In my view, the Palestinian 
track has achieved success and this result will appear in the 
next few days, which is mine and everyone's wish. I support 
what Minister Buwayz said, that the time factor is important for 
the progress of the negotiations. He said that any slowdown in 
the talks would not be in the interest of moderation or the 
parties concerned, but would open the way for extremists to 
obstruct the peace process in the Middle East. He said: Spain 
and Lebanon support the establishment of peace in the near 
future and we will defend this position.

  [Text] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana today visited 
President Ilyas al-Hirawi, Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih 
Birri, and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri. The discussions 
focused on topical issues, notably the peace talks, 
implementation of Security Council Resolution 425, and bilateral 
relations between Lebanon and Spain. 
  Solana first visited Prime Minister al-Hariri in his office 
in the Government Palace in the presence of Foreign Minister 
Faris Buwayz and the Spanish ambassador to Lebanon. Members of 
both delegations then proceeded to Barbur where they met with 
Speaker Nabih Birri. 
  At noon, Solana, accompanied by Buwayz and the Spanish 
ambassador, proceeded to the Presidential Palace in B'abda and 
met with President al-Hirawi who hosted them at lunch. 
  After these visits, Solana expressed his satisfaction with 
the very useful talks on Lebanese and Spanish positions on 
bilateral ties and the future. He stressed that Spain is 
interested in the peace talks in the Middle East. He said: I 
believe that all parties want to establish peace as soon as 
possible. He said: We hope that peace will be achieved 
quickly, a desire we share with all parties in the region. 
  Regarding pressure that Spain may exert toward 
implementation 
of Resolution 425, Solana said: We believe that all UN 
resolutions, including Resolution 425, must be implemented. He 
pointed out that the visit provided him with an opportunity to 
form a clear picture of Lebanon and the region. He said that 
after his talks with the region's leaders, it can be said that 
the crisis is near its end. He stressed that efforts are 
continuing to achieve a fair peace in the region. He noted that 
the economic situation in Lebanon is improving. 
  On Spain's commitment to support Lebanon's reconstruction, 
Solana said that a group of Spanish investors will arrive in 
Lebanon for talks on ways of translating this cooperation into 
action. 
  Members of the Spanish and Lebanese delegations held a 
second 
round of talks at the Foreign Ministry this morning. The 
Lebanese delegation was led by Foreign Ministry Secretary 
General Zafir al- Hasan and the Spanish delegation by (Mora 
Tenis), director general of the African and Middle East desk in 
the Spanish Foreign Ministry. Ambassador al-Hasan said that the 
meeting focused on working out frameworks of cooperation 
agreements in the economic and cultural fields. Solana and his 
accompanying delegation will conclude their visit to Lebanon at 
1600 today.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Muhammad al-Mashmushi: "The Naked U.S. Truth"] </F>
  [Text] No one would object, particularly in the Arab world, 
if U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher makes his planned 
new tour of the region that the Americans call "the Middle 
East." However, this tour will not be useful if he visits under 
the conditions he himself specified, primarily that he will 
pressure no one--he naturally means Israel--to achieve progress 
on the road to a settlement. 
  Following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and Washington's 
stance on a Security Council resolution on it, let alone the 
constant Arab complaints about Israeli intransigence at the 
negotiating table, Christopher's statement on the tour seems to 
be asking the Arabs whether they want him to come and, 
consequently, if they are ready to make his tour useful. 
  The U.S. secretary is revealing here what no one needs to 
know any longer, although certain Americans and even some Arabs 
are trying to cover it up, as PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat did by 
accusing a "secret organization" of assassinating six 
Palestinians on the day before yesterday. The Yitzhaq Rabin 
government responded by awarding medals to its personnel 
yesterday. The United States as much as Israel is trying to 
make political gains from the daily repression, massacres, and 
individual and collective assassinations taking place in the 
occupied territories as well as even disavowals of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  The Israelis and Americans constantly have their eyes on the 
negotiating table in Washington and what the Arabs can offer 
voluntarily or forcibly in favor of Israel and its strategy in 
the region, once on the pretext of security requirements, fear 
of another holocaust, or the new world order and the need for 
the Arab world to adjust itself with its requirements. 
  The United States does not deny any of these accusations. At 
times, it even boasts about them publicly. An extremely 
significant example, although not directly related to the U.S. 
Administration's stance on a settlement in the region and the 
fluctuations in the talks to confront the Arab stance on the 
Israeli intransigence about the Arab call for land for peace, is 
manifest in the U.S.-Zionist campaign to circulate the Jewish 
theory on which Israel was established--international 
persecution and the Nazi holocaust. The U.S. State Department 
released an official statement in the past few days denouncing a 
decision by the Indonesian and Malaysian Governments banning the 
movie Schindler's List made by a Jewish director who was awarded 
seven Oscars. Washington was not content with an indignant 
official denunciation. It adopted more than the hostile stance 
of releasing a statement that is rare in the history of 
relations among countries. The proof of this is that both 
countries backed down and permitted the film, but only after 
censoring certain sexual and nude scenes. Why? What is the 
reason for this stance? It is easy to say that it is because of 
the Zionist influence and media controlled by Jewish funds. 
However, the truth goes beyond that. The fact is declared 
brazenly that the current U.S. Administration is not American 
as much as it is Zionist regarding the issue of an Arab-Israeli 
settlement. Perhaps Christopher was admitting this naked truth 
when he spoke of his forthcoming tour. It makes no difference 
whether the tour takes place or not. He is telling the Arab 
world that this is the truth of the U.S. policy on a settlement, 
whether it is under the name of "full partner" or "honest 
broker," or any other.

<F P=106> [Report by Sefi Hendler; italicized passages recorded] </F>
  [Text] The Labor faction is now holding an emergency 
session in view of the recent events. Despite the urgency of 
the meeting, the prime minister and defense minister did not 
come here today. The most senior government representative here 
is Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who first addressed himself 
to Yasir 'Arafat's thundering silence after the wave of attacks 
in Israel: 
  [Peres] I hold a grave view of it and regret it. I 
believe he should have reacted. Furthermore, some of the PLO 
leaders have reacted. At the same time it must be absolutely 
clear: Just as we will not hesitate taking every step against 
terrorism, we will not stop, not even for a minute, the 
negotiations for an arrangement in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Regarding the defense aspect, Peres said that a closure will 
be imposed on the territories. He explained that the government 
will take every step necessary to restore security, though he 
believes the attack in 'Afula could not have been prevented. He 
describes here a chronicle of an incident that everyone could 
foresee: 
  [Peres] The truth is that the incident in the Cave of 
the Patriarchs caused a deterioration. We knew that 40 days 
would go by and the retaliation would not be late in coming. 
Every thinking Israeli knew this would happen. We did 
everything we could to face the hardships, but we know that we 
cannot anticipate everything. 
  Peres also referred to voices of the right-wing opposition, 
which in fact could be heard just outside the hall where a 
demonstration is calling for the establishment of a state 
commission of inquiry to investigate the deterioration of the 
security situation. Mr. Peres said: 
  [Peres] Yes. This is an outstanding idea. If it is 
correct, then a commission of inquiry should investigate every 
day of the war of Lebanon. Not a day went by in Lebanon in 
which we did not have a fatality. 
  The Labor faction session is still in progress at the Labor 
headquarters in Tel Aviv, and we will return if more significant 
remarks are made here.

  [Text] There were demonstrations from Qiryat Shemona in 
the north to Elat in the south last night, protesting the recent 
terror attacks and calling on the government to stop peace 
negotiations with the Palestinians. In 'Afula, three policemen 
were lightly injured during a violent protest at the site of 
Wednesday's car-bomb attack. In Jerusalem, two demonstrators 
were arrested, one for throwing a lit torch at a policeman and 
the other for trying to break through police barriers. 
  [Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 8 April carries a related 
report on page A3 by Nadav Shragay, adding that "the 
demonstrations were organized by 70 local headquarters set up 
last year by the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, 
Samaria, and Gaza, together with the right-wing parties, under 
the slogan 'This is not peace; this is terrorism'."]

    [Editorial Report] Writing on page 17 of Tel Aviv YEDI'OT 
AHARONOT in Hebrew on 7 April, Mikhal Goldberg reports on the 
testimonies of Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Barukh 
Goldstein's widow Miryam before the Shamgar commission of 
inquiry on 6 April. 
  "At the outset of his testimony, the prime minister reviewed 
the situation in the territories, specifically referring to the 
conditions in Hebron and in the Cave of the Patriarchs. Among 
other things, he commented on the worship arrangements at the 
site and on the permit given to settlers to enter the cave with 
their weapons. 
  "Another central issue featuring in his testimony was the 
Shin Bet's warnings about actions by Jewish extremists, in view 
of Army officers' contentions during the commission's hearings 
that they had not been forewarned about Jewish terror and the 
Shin Bet's arguments that it had issued hundreds of such 
warnings. 
  "An hour into Rabin's testimony, a phone call was received 
at 
the Supreme Court building: `Beware, all of you leftists. The 
building will blow up within the hour.' Security personnel and 
policemen stationed in the building were put on the alert, and a 
police bomb disposal expert was summoned to the scene. They 
began searching the building and the cars parked in the adjacent 
parking lot. Nevertheless, the building was not evacuated, and 
Rabin proceeded with his testimony. Eventually, it proved to be 
a false alarm." 
  Goldberg goes on to write that Miryam Goldstein gave her 
testimony in camera. "She was smuggled into the building 
through the entrance reserved for the judges," and "the entire 
building was closed to the public in order to preserve the 
utmost secrecy." Goldstein was supposed to testify before the 
commission on 3 April, but she did not show up. "It is not 
clear why she changed her mind," Goldberg writes.

  [Text] David Levi, the chairman of the Jordan Rift Valley 
Regional Council, says that according to an updated map he has 
seen, the boundaries of the Jericho autonomous enclave will be 
larger than what was recently agreed upon with the PLO. The 
town's boundaries have been expanded to include an area of 
several square kilometers to the south. The perimeters of the 
village of al-'Awja' have also been expanded almost up to the 
border fence. Levi told our correspondent Gil Litman that 
construction work on the Jericho bypass road has not yet begun.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Daniyel Ben-Simon: "A General More Than a </F>
Leader"] 
  [Text] Slowly and consistently, Yitzhaq Rabin has been 
losing supporters. Soon he will be marking his second 
anniversary in office, and we will be facing the same man we 
knew before: hesitant, suspicious, devoid of assertive 
leadership, loathe to delegate responsibility to the point of 
obsession, and a military man through and through. These 
problematic qualities are amply reflected in the arrangement 
emerging between Israel and the Palestinians. This is a 
military agreement more than a political one, because it is 
being formulated by generals and not by politicians. 
Supposedly, the imminent withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will 
be the climax of the breathtaking drama on the White House lawn 
on 13 September. Six months have gone by and it turns out that 
people are not happy, neither on our side nor on theirs. Some 
people have been trying hard to spoil the fun. 
  Rabin's reelection as prime minister was one of the most 
mind- boggling manifestations of political recycling in 
contemporary times, and not just in Israel. His first year in 
service only strengthened the impression that here we had a new 
and fresh politician, very different from the prime minister we 
knew almost 20 years ago. Everything was going his way. He 
personally ran the country without neglecting any details. He 
demanded to know everything his cabinet ministers were doing -- 
and justifiably so, considering that he chose them based on 
their qualifications. He closely followed the progress in 
building roads and overpasses, the state of poverty, the 
allocation of resources, the absorption of aliyah, and what not. 
The people liked his style. After years during which Yitzhaq 
Shamir evinced indifference, if not disregard, toward anything 
remotely reeking of socioeconomic issues, Yitzhaq Rabin was 
perceived as a refreshing change. This was reflected in public 
opinion polls, which indicated vast support for his performance. 
  His popularity soared sky high after the signing of the 
agreement between Israel and the PLO in Washington. People 
walked down the streets with a smile in their heart. Except for 
the settlers who continued to mortify themselves and grieve in 
their ghettos, everybody felt elated. The world at large, tired 
of disappointments about peace initiatives gone sour, stared in 
bewilderment at Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's daring and 
determination. Even Menahem Begin, who signed the peace treaty 
with Egypt, did not evince such lavish praise. 
  In the eyes of the world and of many Israelis who saw 
themselves represented by this government, the signing of the 
Declaration of Principles symbolized the first act en route to 
the end of the occupation. What happened, however, is that 
instead of striving for this goal with kid gloves, in good faith 
and with awe, Rabin took peace by storm, as if it was a military 
operation. He shoved politicians and diplomats aside and placed 
the Army's top brass at the most sensitive junctions of the 
peace negotiations. As is known, it is hard for soldiers to 
change their spots overnight. Suddenly they found themselves 
sitting opposite people who until the night before they had laid 
in ambush for. They had a hard time making the change. 
  Rabin even had a harder time of it. He was the man who 
over the last 10 years, except for a brief two-year interval, 
formulated Israel's security policy in the territories. The 
intifadah broke out during his term in office and set the 
territories on fire. Instead of "taking his time to ponder 
over" the dramatic flare-up, he sent thousands of soldiers to 
the territories to quash it at gunpoint. Hundreds had to die, 
thousands had to be wounded and arrested before Rabin realized 
the limitations of force. 
  In his capacity as defense minister, Rabin drew the 
distinction between the PLO inside and outside the territories 
and devised peace initiatives aimed at driving them apart, as if 
they were pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. Only when he became prime 
minister did he realize that this was an imaginary distinction. 
He turned to 'Arafat, as if imbibing in some bitter medicine, 
and only after he came to the conclusion that the PLO was one 
single entity. Even after he signed the agreement, he conveyed 
the impression that he was not really thrilled about the whole 
business. At times he even seemed to regret having signed the 
deal. 
  Israelis who sided with him through thick and thin were 
suddenly confronted with a prime minister who was of two minds, 
who agonized and dragged his feet, was unenthusiastic, hesitant, 
and unassertive. Instead of overseeing the negotiations from the 
comfort of his position, Rabin chose to get involved with the 
minute details, which ranged from the ridiculous to the 
pathetic. At his instructions, his aides spent whole days on 
questions such as the type of security personnel that would be 
stationed at the border terminals in Gaza and Jericho and how 
many meters would separate the Israeli guard from the 
Palestinian one. Not to mention the glass partition at the 
terminal, its thickness, location, and transparency. Not to 
mention the type of electronic gadgetry that would replace 
bodily frisking of people crossing through the terminals. 
  The insistence on details in faraway capitals around the 
globe, coupled with the use of unprecedented firepower in the 
territories, did their bit. The public began losing its 
confidence in peace and in the negotiators. Day in and day out 
the prime minister could be seen grumbling, furious, 
threatening, and bickering about the Palestinian partner. 
Menahem Begin gave back the entire Sinai Peninsula, four times 
the size of Israel, without grumbling or bickering as frequently 
as Rabin. That same Begin was not scared by the right wing's 
threats or of sending his deputy to grovel before the Jewish 
ayatollahs to tone down their halakic edict. That same Begin 
evacuated settlements and was not deterred by allegations of a 
Jewish population transfer. 
  It is at these critical times that an eminent leader is 
needed. Begin was one such leader, inasmuch as the peace with 
Egypt was concerned. He adopted big decisions, and the public 
respected his determination and followed him. Rabin, on the 
other hand, projects the restlessness of a man who is not at 
peace with himself or with his actions. Frustration is the 
antithesis of leadership. His bleak mood radiates to the people 
who despair in the possibility of peace with the Palestinians. 
That is why there are no happy people these days.

<F P=106> [Report by Sana' al-Imam from Damascus] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Iranian parliamentary 
delegation led by Hojjat ol-Eslam Hasan Ruhani, Iranian deputy 
Majles speaker, held several meetings in Damascus with the 
pro-Iran Iraqi opposition factions, such as al- Da'wah Party and 
the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution. Ruhani was 
quoted as saying that those who depend on the United States to 
liberate Iraq will be disappointed because the United States 
wants to control Iraq. 
  Ruhani also held talks with the 10 Palestinian factions that 
oppose the Gaza-Jericho accord. He also held talks in Damascus 
with representatives of the Hizballah and the Islamic resistance 
in Lebanon. Following his meeting with those representatives, 
Ruhani stressed the importance of a united Islamic resistance 
stand, reiterating Iran's readiness to continue to support 
Islamic resistance against Israeli schemes. 
  In a statement to Monte Carlo, Palestinian sources denied 
any 
Iranian financial siege on Hizballah and the Islamic Jihad. 
They stressed that the delay in Iranian financial aid in 
October 1993 was caused by a financial crisis in the Bank of 
Iran. This was communicated to them by the Iranian leadership 
in a written letter. The Palestinian sources said this temporary 
delay completely ended by December 1993.

  [Text] Damascus, April 7, IRNA -- Visiting Vice-Speaker of 
Iran's Majles Hojjat ol-Eslam Hasan Ruhani and Syrian 
Vice-President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam discussed important 
developments in the region as well as international issues and 
matters of mutual interest here today. 
  Deploring the crimes being committed by the Zionist regime, 
Ruhani said that Israel through such practices has proved that 
it was not seeking to attain peace and stability in the region 
or let Palestinians achieve their legitimate rights. The 
Zionist regime, under the increasing pressure from the intifada 
and frustrated in its attempt to suppress the Palestinian 
uprising, has resorted to negotiations to maintain its security 
and get a grip on the region's economic resouces, Ruhani said. 
He stressed that Iran will stand by the Syrian Government and 
nation in their confrontation with the Qods occupying regime. 
As for Tehran-Damascus ties Ruhani epressed pleasure over the 
intimate relations between the two countries and voiced Iran's 
readiness for further expansion of ties in all domains including 
parliamentary and economic areas. 
  Khaddam said that despite the passage of 30 months after the 
start of [word indistinct] Israeli negotiations, there has been 
no progress in the so-called peace talks. He added that it was 
unlikely for Israel and Syria to end hostility in a near future. 
The Zionist regime, he said, was dreaming of taking control of 
the region and materializing its hegemonist goals. Khaddam 
reiterated that nobody should think that the struggle against 
the Zionist regime would end. The Syrian vice president, too, 
welcomed the idea of broadening bilateral ties through 
continuous contacts between Tehran and Damascus. 
  In another development Ruhani met with general secretary of 
the Lebanese Progressive Party Walid Junblatt at Iran's Embassy 
here today where the latter briefed him on the lateut 
developments in Lebanon. Ruhani expressed hope that the 
Lebanese people would manage to bring about solid unity between 
Islamic and nationalistic forces in that country. He called on 
the Lebanese people to neutralize the enemy's plot to sow 
discord among them, assuring them that nations always win over 
aggressors. 
  Ruhani, who is here on a five-day official visit, said that 
Iran will continue to support the Lebanese people in their just 
defence against Zionist crimes. Junblatt stressed that as long 
as southern Lebanon is under Israeli occupation, resistance in 
the occupied territories will continue.

  [Text] Damascus, April 7, IRNA -- Majles Vice-Speaker 
Hojjat ol-Eslam Hasan Ruhani discussed major regional issues and 
international developments with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad 
here today. 
  During the meeting which lasted more than two hours Hoj. 
Ruhani also conveyed a verbal message from President Akbar 
Hashemi- Rafsanjani to his Syrian counterpart. 
  Hoj. Ruhani described the Zionist regime as the "origin of 
the unrests in the sensitive Middle East region" and said this 
regime spoke of peace spuriously in an effort to take advantage 
of the regional resources. 
  "Peace is in contradiction with the very nature of this 
usurper regime," he added. 
  Referring to the massacre of the palestinian worshippers in 
al-Khalil [Hebron], Ruhani regretted that some elements who 
consider themselves as the representatives of the Palestinian 
nation fell into humiliation by signing compromising deals, and 
in fact committed treason against the holy Palestinian ideal. 
He predicted that the Palestinian intifidah and Islamic 
resistance in Lebanon which are supported by Iran and Syria and 
the Islamic ummah at large, would bear fruit, and restore the 
trampled rights of the Palestinian nation. 
  On the hajj pilgrimage, Ruhani said in the wake of the 
agreement signed by the Iranian and Saudi Arabian foreign 
ministers, the non-cooperation of the Saudi officials to provide 
facilities for more Iranian pilgrims is "unjustifiable". 
  President al-Asad in reply said the similarity of the 
Iranian 
and Syrian positions concerning most of the important regional 
issues as well as their resistance against the threats of the 
Zionist regime were the root of the global arrogance hostilities 
against the both countries. On the so-called Middle East peace 
talks President al-Asad said the talks had not so far borne any 
results. "Syria does not hope the talks to end in any just 
results," he added. 
  Stressing that Syria would not overlook the trampled rights 
of the brotherly Palestinian nation under any circumstances, the 
president said his country was not ready to accept the planned 
peace with the Zionist regime even if the talks lasted for 
decades. He noted that Iran and Syria are targets of the 
propaganda attacks by the global arrogance led by the U.S. due 
to their independent and anti-Zionist stances. 
  "The accusations like violation of human rights and 
terrorism 
and the last one, i.e., anti-drug campaign will be removed, if 
we step back from our righteous stances," the president said. 
  Expressing pleasure with the level of Tehran-Damascus 
cooperation, President al-Asad expressed hope that he would 
visit Iran in a near future.

    [Editorial Report] Damascus Syrian Arab Television Network 
in Arabic, in a linkup with Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio 
Network in Arabic at 0900 GMT on 7 April begins a live relay of 
the ceremony marking the 47th anniversary of the Arab Socialist 
Ba'th Party from the Damascus University auditorium. 
  The ceremony begins with a poem by the master of ceremonies 
hailing the Ba'th Party and its leader President Hafiz al-Asad. 
This was followed by a one-minute silence in honor of the late 
Basil al-Asad and martyrs of the Ba'th Party and Arab nation. 
This is followed by the Ba'th Party anthem. 
  Among those present at the ceremony are Mahmud al-Zu'bi, 
prime minister; 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, assistant secretary general 
of the Ba'th Party; 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam, vice president; 
Zuhayr Mashariqah, vice president, ministers; and other top 
government and party officials. 
  At 0910 S'uad Bakkur, chairwoman of the Syrian Women General 
Federation, delivers the speech of the popular organizations and 
trade unions. She refers to the Ba'th Party's struggle for 
Palestine and against colonialism. Speaking about the 
al-Asad-led Corrective Movement, she is interrupted twice by an 
unidentified person reciting poems in a clear Iraqi accent 
hailing the party and al-Asad. The speaker refers to Syria's 
local and Arab achievements during al-Asad's presidency. She 
reiterates the Syrian position on peace and the call for a just 
and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. 
  At 0930 Fayiz Isma'il, member of the National Progressive 
Front's Central Command and secretary general of the Unionists 
Socialists Party delivers the speech of the National Progressive 
Front. He recalls the history of the Ba'th Party and its 
founders and members and their struggle. The speaker is 
interrupted by a poet who recites a poem on pan-Arabism. 
Isma'il then speaks about the unity between Syria and Egypt and 
the plot that foiled that unity. He refers to the Corrective 
Movement and the positive changes introduced by this movement. 
  At 0958 GMT the master of ceremonies recites a short poem on 
the Ba'th Party and the 7th April anniversary. 
  At 1000 GMT 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, who is representing 
President 
al- Asad at the rally, delivers the Ba'th Party speech. He 
begins by speaking about the annual celebration of the party's 
anniversary and conveys the greetings of al-Asad and the Ba'th 
leadership. Al-Ahmar eulogizes the late Basil al-Asad and is 
interrupted by a poet reciting a poem hailing Basil al-Asad. 
  While speaking about Arab unity, al-Ahmar is interrupted by 
the Iraqi poet, who recites a short poem hailing al-Asad and 
criticizing Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, stressing that Saddam 
should quit. Al-Ahmar continues to speak about Arab unity, the 
crisis it is facing, and the Ba'th ideology for attaining this 
unity. 
  He elaborates on the Ba'th Party's struggle and thoughts and 
on the efforts made by President al-Asad to unleash the 
capabilities of the Party and Syria. He refers to political and 
economic pluralism in Syria and the development program in the 
country as well as national unity. 
  He says Syria is working to realize Arab solidarity with the 
aim of restoring the occupied territories and rights, and 
stresses that the right to self-defense and to defend land and 
rights are guaranteed by all laws. 
  Al-Ahmar emphasizes: "As in the past, al-Asad's Syria today 
will not be dissuaded from its pan-Arab role that defends the 
Arab rights by any pressures, false accusations, or unjust 
lists, on which the Zionist lobby insists." He says this lobby 
is trying to harm Syrian-U.S relations and to influence Syrian 
peace positions. He adds "this lobby, and its assistants, are 
annoyed because of Syria's adherence to its Arab rights and 
constants and the diplomatic successes it realized, which were 
clearly manifested in Syria's dealing with the peace process." 
  On the peace process, al-Ahmar reiterates the Syrian call 
for 
a just and comprehensive peace, and refers to the Syrian efforts 
to render this process successful. He says: "Syria does not 
accept that this process be derailed from its specified track, 
and the formula agreed on in Madrid." He says Israel 
maneuvered to obstruct this process in a bid to impose 
capitulation on the Arabs. He is interrupted by a group of young 
men chanting patriotic Palestinian songs. 
  He refers to the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the church 
explosion in Lebanon, which he says were aimed to obstruct the 
peace process. He says "the Security Council Resolution 904 
shows that the whole world began to complain about Israel's 
terrorist behavior." On the church explosion, he says that it 
exposed those who have links with Israel. He is interrupted by 
people chanting slogans hailing Syrian-Lebanese relations and by 
the Iraqi poet who recites a poem hailing al-Asad's position at 
the Geneva summit with President Bill Clinton. Al-Ahmar 
stresses that Syria will not relinquish any Arab right and 
insists on having just and full peace in the region. 
  Speaking about international issues, al-Ahmar notes that the 
end of the Cold War has not brought world peace, and that 
conflicts and wars broke out in several places.

<F P=106> [Speech by 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, assistant secretary general </F>
of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, ASBP, at a ceremony marking 
the ASBP's 47th anniversary, in Damascus on 7 April--live] 
  [Excerpts] Comrades, masses of our struggler nation, 
struggler Ba'thists everywhere. Just as the Earth celebrates 
the blossoms of April, every year our struggler Arab masses 
celebrate the anniversary of the establishment of our great 
party, the ASBP. [passage omitted] 
  Comrades, on the 47th anniversary of the establishment of 
the 
ASBP, I have the honor to convey to you on this great 
anniversary, and through you to all the party's strugglers and 
to all Arab strugglers, the greetings and congratulations of the 
first Ba'thist, the leader of the march of our people and 
nation, struggler comrade President Hafiz al-Asad. [applause] 
At the same time, it pleases me to convey to you greetings and 
congratulations from the party leadership, and its wishes for 
further success on the road to the objectives of the party and 
the masses: Unity, freedom, and socialism. [passage omitted 
reviewing ASBP history, principles, and achievements] 
  Al-Asad's Syria today, with all worthiness, carries pan-Arab 
concerns. It will not allow the loss of Arab rights. It is 
capable of raising the cultural pan-Arab banner that is the 
honorable image of our nation despite the difficult times 
through which this nation is passing. The Geneva summit between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton is considered an event 
that confirmed that Syria's leader, the great Arab leader Hafiz 
al-Asad, [applause] constitutes, before the world, the true 
image and the nation's cultural face, committed to rights, 
pride, and dignity. Within this framework, Syria is working to 
reinforce Arab solidarity based on the ASBP's great pan-Arab 
principles, to bolster the Arabs' role, and to coordinate their 
efforts to liberate their occupied territories, restore their 
usurped rights, and defend themselves in the face of the 
challenges that threaten their present and future in a way that 
proves that they reject humiliation, submission, and 
capitulation to fait accompli. The right to defend oneself, 
land, and rights, is a right recognized by all the world's laws 
and charters. Struggle for liberation is also a right and a 
national duty to every people whose land was occupied and whose 
rights were violated. Al-Asad's Syria, just as it was in the 
past, will not be prevented from playing its pan-Arab role in 
defending Arab rights by any pressure, false accusations, and 
unjust lists on which the Zionist lobby insists. For a long 
time, this lobby has been used to working in the United States 
to drag its administration into creating a rift in Syrian-U.S. 
relations, and to try to disrupt Syria's position toward the 
peace process, especially since this lobby and its henchmen are 
angered by Syria's abidance with Arab rights and constants, and 
by the diplomatic successes it has made, which were clearly 
displayed by Syria's dealing with the peace process through 
adherence to Arab rights, and confrontation of Israel's 
intransigence and crude terrorism. 
  Comrades, brothers: Based on all this, Syria has offered 
great pan-Arab sacrifices to support brothers everywhere. By 
doing so, it had no motives other than the great pan-Arab 
motive, which is entrenched in ASBP ideology and thought which 
was expanded and enriched by the thought of the honest leader 
Hafiz al-Asad and his limitless sacrifices. [applause] It is 
the pan-Arab understanding of the issue of the Arab-Israeli 
conflict, which is the pivot of the activities of al-Asad's 
Syria and its struggle within the framework of achieving a just 
and comprehensive solution to this conflict based on restoring 
the occupied Arab territories and the usurped rights in 
accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions and the land 
for peace principle. Syria joined the peace process in the 
region, which is based on the international legitimacy, more 
than two years ago in order to be a means to achieving clear 
objectives, whose contents were included in UN Security Council 
Resolutions No. 242, 338, and 425, and the land for peace 
formula. It has exerted continuous efforts to contribute to the 
success of this process and to achieve its objectives of 
establishing a just, comprehensive, and honorable peace. 
However, Israel has not stopped, through its maneuverings and 
practices since the outset of the peace process, to obstruct 
this process and to divert it from its basic objectives, as part 
of its plans to impose capitulation on the Arabs. 
  Comrades, Syria does not agree that this process should be 
derailed from its specified track, and the formula agreed on in 
Madrid. Syria has confronted, and is resolutely confronting all 
the Israeli maneuvering, intransigence, and attempts to evade 
the requirements and prerequisites of peace, foremost of which 
are the withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and 
the recognition of the Palestinian Arab people's legitimate 
rights. [applause] Israel is still resorting to the means that 
enable it to divert the peace process from its objective. After 
it dealt separately with the Palestinian side through the Oslo 
agreement in an attempt to strike at Arab coordination and to 
weaken the Arab position, it perpetrated the holy Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre, whose hideousness is beyond any one's 
imagination. It was also behind the massacre perpetrated at the 
Sayyidat al-Najat Church. The objective behind all this is to 
abort peace efforts and to foil the Arabs' efforts to restore 
their rights and territories. The UN Security Council's 
denunciation of the abhorrent holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, 
through its Resolution No. 904, shows that the whole world began 
to complain about Israel's terrorist behavior, and began to 
expose Israel's intransigence and adherence to fascism and 
occupation. This is despite the fact that the resolution itself 
is not commensurate with the hideous nature of the crime. Nor 
does it constitute sufficient deterrence to the terrorist 
behavior of which Israel has been known since the beginning of 
its continuous aggression against the Arabs. 
  Comrades, brothers: The quick pursuit of those who exploded 
the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Lebanon has exposed those 
involved in successive explosions. They are linked with Israel 
and work to execute its schemes. This proves the fraternal 
people of Lebanon are determined to foil Israeli plots to 
reinvolve Lebanon in acts of violence and to disrupt its efforts 
to achieve stability and national accord, and to liberate 
southern Lebanon. These plots use the most hideous and the 
crudest means of terrorism, as we saw at Sayyidat al-Najat 
Church and before, and as we see in what is taking place in 
occupied southern Lebanon everyday. The measures the Lebanese 
Government has taken to confront the conspirators against 
Lebanon's security and stability, and to confront all those who 
would contribute to returning Lebanon to the whirlpool of 
violence and fighting, were received with great satisfaction 
inside and outside Lebanon. These measures, which are backed by 
Syria, have contributed to exposing tools manipulated from 
outside Lebanon in order to implement Israeli schemes. These 
measures have exposed Israel's intentions against Lebanon. They 
prove the march of security and accord in Lebanon is stronger 
than all who want this fraternal country to return to the 
climate of war, violence, and destruction. [applause] 
  Comrades, brothers: The struggle of our zealous kinsfolk in 
the Golan and their valiant confrontation of the occupation 
troops, the valiant Palestinian intifadah in the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip, and the heroic Lebanese resistance in southern 
Lebanon, are all important factors that integrate with Syria's 
struggle to impose the Arab right on an intransigent Israel that 
wants peace with land. As its leader, the great Arab leader 
Hafiz al-Asad [applause] said, Syria will not relinquish a 
single inch of the Golan and the other occupied Arab 
territories. Neither will it give up any Arab rights. Syria is 
confronting all the obstacles Israel places on the road to peace 
with the objective of arriving at a just and comprehensive peace 
in the region that restores full Arab rights and territories to 
their people, and opens the doors of free development and 
progress to the region's peoples, avoiding aggression, hegemony, 
tyranny, and occupation. 
  Comrades, based on the humanitarian dimension of the 
pan-Arab 
movement and the Arab nation's civilization and culture, the 
ASBP established a network of relations with several parties, 
organizations, and liberation movements, to gain the greatest 
possible support for our Arab issues, and to confront the 
world's misleading Zionist media. These relations are part of 
the peoples' common struggle to build a world free of all forms 
of aggression, hegemony, tyranny, and the policy of variable 
standards--a world based on justice, equality, and respect for 
every people's right to opt for their own way of development 
with complete freedom. 
  Developments in the international arena prove the end of 
the Cold War has not brought security, stability, and peace, as 
indicated by the slogans that accompanied its end. The number 
of conflicts, tensions, and civil wars has increased. They have 
escalated in several countries, such as Afghanistan, Somalia, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the former Soviet Republics, and in other 
countries and continents. These countries feel they are left to 
fight, as if they exist outside this world. In fact, the 
policies of hegemony and tyranny, and the hostility to Arabs and 
Muslims, have increased the pains of peoples and made their 
causes a field for external interference and a game for the 
balances of power and interests in the world. 
  Comrades: We stress that world peace, security, and 
stability, are an indivisible whole. It is necessary to 
consider all peoples' interests and aspirations, aside from all 
forms of fascism, Zionism, hegemony, and tyranny, and aside from 
the policies of aggression, nuclear arms, and mass destruction 
weapons stockpiled by those who took the policy of aggression 
and hegemony against peoples as a profession. Taking all 
peoples' interests into consideration is an indispensable 
condition for building a new world order based on democracy in 
international relations, on justice, equality, and mutual 
respect, and on eliminating the current discrimination among the 
world's poor and rich, north, and south. 
  Comrades, based on a rich experience gradually built by the 
party until it grew and became strong, and proceeding from the 
sacrifices and energies of a great leader who is leading the 
contemporary pan- Arab struggle, the honest leader Hafiz al-Asad 
[applause] -- based on all this, we are optimistic about the 
future. On this occasion, the party's 47th anniversary, we 
renew the pledge to pursue the march with a greater 
determination and stronger enthusiasm behind our honest, symbol 
leader Hafiz al-Asad. [applause] A march that is led by Hafiz 
al-Asad has no choice but to go ahead toward further victories 
and achievements. 
  Comrades, on this occasion, on behalf of you, all the 
party's 
strugglers, and all the Arab strugglers, I send heartfelt 
greetings and congratulations to the leader of the march of our 
people and nation, the secretary general of the party, and the 
president of the republic, struggler leader Hafiz al-Asad. 
[applause] Greetings to all the Ba'thist strugglers in the 
entire greater Arab homeland. Greetings to our struggler Arab 
masses, the source of the party's inspiration and the minaret of 
its policies and march. Greetings to our steadfast kinsfolk in 
the heroic Golan. Greetings to the sons of our people, the 
heroes of the heroic Palestinian intifadah, to the valiant 
resistance men in southern Lebanon, and to all Arab strugglers. 
All greetings to the leader of the march of our people, party, 
and nation to victory and liberation, the honest leader, 
struggler comrade Hafiz al-Asad. [applause]

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has again 
declared that Pakistan will never agree to roll back its nuclear 
program. It is our commitment to the people and the government 
will not compromise on the country's nuclear program. The prime 
minister was replying to questions by newsmen in the Parliament 
House today. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said it has been the stand of 
Pakistan that the nuclear issue will not be solved by cornering 
it. The United States should have an even-handed policy toward 
both Pakistan and India and the Pressler Amendment, she added, 
is a veto in the hands of India. About the forthcoming visit of 
the American assistant secretary of state [title as heard], Mr. 
Strobe Talbott, the prime minister said Pakistan wants nuclear 
nonproliferation and has put forward many proposals for nuclear 
nonproliferation in South Asia, but India has rejected all 
these. If any other nation puts forward its own proposals on 
the subject, we are ready to consider them too. We will not 
agree to unilateral capping of nuclear installations, but if the 
Indians do so, Islamabad would also agree to it. Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto said the United States should realize that Pakistanis are 
a proud and honorable nation very conscious of their self 
respect and the government's policy on the nuclear program 
enjoys a national consensus. 
  Replying to a question on the opposition's role on national 
issues, the prime minister urged that the opposition should give 
up its attitude of confrontation and join hands with the 
government on sensitive issues of national importance like 
Kashmir and the nuclear program. She said we should take the 
interest of the country above our personal interest and should 
work for the economic well being of the people. Mr. Benazir 
Bhutto said her government has taken revolutionary measures 
since assumption of power. Recounting these measures, she said 
hers is the first government in the history of Pakistan which 
imposed income tax on agriculture. Load shedding [power cuts] 
has been a problem since many years and her government soon 
after coming into power sanctioned two power projects -- one in 
Hab and other at Ghazi Barotha. We curtailed the deficit 
financing in the country and did not resort to mini budget which 
was very difficult. The results of our policies, the prime 
minister said, will become clear 18 months after our assumption 
of office. 
  Talking about the increase in the base price of wheat, the 
prime minister said 70 percent of the country's population lives 
in rural areas and are farmers. They were not sowing wheat as 
its price was very low resulting in a decline in the country's 
wheat production. The government, therefore, had to import 
wheat. It was a difficult decision and those who have lust for 
power would not have taken this decision. But we take power as 
a noble trust by the people and as a responsibility. These are 
difficult decisions which will benefit the country in the long 
run.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the National Command of the Arab </F>
Socialist Ba'th Party on ocassion of the party's 47th 
anniversary in April] 
  [Text] O sons of our lofty nation, O militant Ba'thists: 
[word indistinct] the 47th anniversary of the founding of your 
party, the ASBP [Arab Socialist Ba'th Party], the masses of the 
Arab nation and its militant pan-Arab and patriotic forces greet 
this anniversary with the honor it deserves and extract from it 
living meanings of the objectives of the contemporary Arab 
revolution. 
  This prominent pan-Arab occasion represents a historic scene 
full of good deeds carried out by generations that raised the 
banner of the Ba'th and followed the path of the founder 
president, may God have mercy on his soul, who illuminated our 
road toward realizing the objectives of the great Ba'th Party 
through his enlightened thought and generous sacrifices. 
  The 47th anniversary embodies the same spirit that prevailed 
at the party's beginning, represented by the steadfastness of 
great Iraq, under the leadership of mujahid comrade Saddam 
Husayn, the symbol of our nation's struggle and the sign of its 
glory and firm stands in defense of pan-Arabism and Islam. The 
faithful people's conviction that the nation deserves its 
affiliation to its deep- rooted history and to gain victory over 
its enemies is becoming stronger. 
  It is an immortal anniversary that takes us back to the 
starting point to become aware of the relation between the 
founding of the party and the nation, and inspire us to carry 
out historic action and embark on a message-bearing role in 
accordance with the party's principles and in continuation of 
its tradition, and shouldering the trust of Arab socialist, 
democratic, and unionist struggle. 
  The founding of the party ushered in the beginning of ripe 
pan- Arab and militant action and transformed it into a popular 
movement capable of contributing to the civilized character of 
the nation through long popular struggle against the factors of 
its [word indistinct] and abandonment of its message-bearing 
role. 
  The Ba'th movement has set the course of resurgence and 
introduced organized and unified Arab action as a way to achieve 
salvation. Since the beginning, the movement found itself 
facing a difficult test and unique experience that require 
seriousness, harmony with its objectives, and ability to work 
for the nation through viewing life as a message and jihad. 
  After 47 years, the answers to the questions posed by Arab 
struggle and its challenges to the party's vanguards and 
organizations will continue to be linked to the readiness of the 
Ba'thists to discuss facts frankly with the people and resort to 
the party's militant principles and moral pillars represented in 
truth, love for the people, unselfishness, and commitment to the 
nation's interest and Party programs. All these principles and 
pillars continue to be standards for evaluating the party's 
march to determine how well this march is in line with the 
principles and to remedy any contradiction with these principles. 
  The Ba'th Party has set its path based on faith in the 
people 
and the justice of the Arab cause, and through a special 
approach and comprehensive vision of the contradictions in the 
Arab situation. the party has worked, in an honest and 
principled manner, to decisively confront this situation in the 
interest of the masses. The close ties with reality and the 
people provided the party with a firm opinion and position, and 
the ability to predict the future and develop the experience in 
order to know the facts of the historic stage and its trends, 
based on the revolutionary Arab ideology. 
  The Ba'th Party has translated its deep-rooted ideology and 
struggle, objective approach, and openness to the Arab and human 
heritages. This gave the party its distinguished nature that 
reflects the movement's characteristics and historic birth. The 
Ba'th Party was founded during a stage full of totalitarian 
ideologies and beliefs and integrated thoughts in the fields of 
arts and social and human sciences, which had the ability to 
influence. They enjoyed frameworks, establishments, and 
political, economic, and cultural influence to the point that 
they almost prevented the emergence of anything new and blocked 
any living expression about the identities of the developing 
peoples as a result of this influence and productivity. 
  The Ba'th has proven its presence by its comprehensive 
ideology. It saved the Arab fate and Arab thought from 
perdition, from imitation, and from being at the wrong end of 
the stick. It emphasized its role as a positive and creative 
movement whose establishment was dictated by the nation's 
circumstances and its ambitious aspirations. This movement 
resulted from the deeply felt spiritual tribulations of the 
nation and from its values of freedom, justice, self-respect, as 
well as its humanitarian approach. 
  The Ba'th did not confine its struggle to ready-made 
ideologies or to rigid concepts that outline the desired Arab 
society. It did not adopt a comprehensive universal outlook, 
but remained committed to its role as a revolutionary and 
faithful pan-Arab movement that will be working for hundreds of 
years. It will not acquiesce to abridged missions, becoming 
just an ideological school, or agree to a diminished size, 
becoming only a movement held captive by improvised positions 
and transient reactions. The Ba'th knows its civilized role and 
the basic components of its effort to pinpoint the historical 
moment through which the modern Arab resurgence is passing. The 
Arab struggle for this resurgence coincides with an imbalance in 
this age's materialistic civilization. This gives their 
struggle a missionary and humanitarian dimension that 
contributes to redressing this civilization and participating in 
the establishment of a new world based on faith and spiritual 
munificence. That is why the anniversary of the party's 
establishment remains a constant call to return to the sources 
of faith. The more time passes, the more the need to widen the 
course of these sources, removing the residues and obstacles of 
the experiment, so they can regain their purity. 
  The Ba'th assumed its role in shaping Arab unionist 
awareness. It led the battle for values and objectives against 
the forces of the fait accompli and the advocates of 
isolationism and regionalism [word indistinct] its nation in 
front of a conspiracy that seeks to return it to the era of 
decline and stagnation. Thus, it assumed the responsibility of 
moving the Arab state of affairs in an upward historical 
direction. It maintained the incandescent flame of the pan-Arab 
movement for half a century as a unionist and humanitarian 
movement. Many unionist movements disappeared in many parts of 
the world, gave up their role and their objectives and submitted 
to international maneuvers and the interests of influential 
countries at the expense of their aspirations and legitimate 
objectives. 
  The secret of the Ba'th's pursuit of its vanguard pan-Arab 
role is its confidence in the nation's capabilities. Struggle 
can unleash the best potentials. This has made it, throughout 
its history, the selfless friend of the Arab masses, waging the 
Arab nation's fierce battles. It produced tangible results and 
transformations for this nation, starting with its participation 
in confronting the usurpation of Palestine, the constant 
confrontation of Zionism and the reactionary alliances and 
regimes, the attainment of the first unity in the modern Arab 
history, the toppling of secessionist anti-Arab regimes deeply 
involved in the conspiracies against unity, and the struggle to 
attain the people's objectives, foremost being oil 
nationalization, tackling issues of minorities, and setting up a 
broad popular movement throughout the Arab homeland devoted to 
championing the pan-Arab cause. 
  Topping the list of the Arab struggle's gains is the Ba'th 
convergence with Iraqi spirit and aspirations, in a historical 
meeting that expressed the depth of Iraq's militant and 
civilized personality, unleashed its heroic potential, and 
placed this militant country, after the success of the glorious 
17-30 July Revolution, at the center of the Arab nation's battle 
against the schemes to liquidate the Arab cause and the 
conspiracies against the future. The Ba'th placed in Iraqi 
hands, conscience, and minds the requisites for the major 
unleashing of forces and the great achievements of a lofty 
people. 
  With its civilized heritage and its unique past and present 
pan- Arab role, not to mention its achievements in the field of 
liberation, its sharp Arab perception, the audacity of its 
Ba'thist vanguards, and the genius of its struggler leader 
Comrade Saddam Husayn, Iraq has renewed its position under the 
Ba'th banner as the focal point and shield protecting the nation 
by freeing its political decision making and its economic, 
scientific, and military achievements, burying the aggression at 
the eastern gate of the Arab homeland in the glorious Saddam's 
al-Qadisiyah. It embodies the brilliant face of resurgence and 
is the proof of the nation's salubrity and the platform from 
which it proceeds to liberate Palestine. From this premise, 
Iraq's becoming the target for the abortion of the plan for Arab 
resurgence reconfirms the importance of the strategic 
imperialist constants in the Arab homeland. Thus, the Mother of 
Battles summed up the importance of Arab security vis- a-vis the 
perils it faces. In essence, it was of a defensive nature, 
although it contained a spirit of rejection and confrontation of 
the despot. It mobilized the nation's comprehensive outlook 
toward the requisites of life, and expressed the commitment of 
the will and the Arab moral and ethical configuration that does 
not accept the prevalence of materialistic concepts and the 
violation of Arab sovereignty and honor. 
  This clairvoyant perception of the values of truth and 
justice has made the Arab nation fully aware of its posture and 
of the inevitability of its victory in the battle of values. 
This perception has made it possible to specify the points of 
weakness among the ranks of the aggressors and to foresee the 
imminent downfall of the powers of hegemony, despite their 
unrestrained whims and the clamor of media disinformation that 
aims at glorifying the sole superpower and embellishing its 
arrogance. 
  Confidence about the future does not reflect unjustified 
optimism. Rather, it is based on a profound understanding of 
the Mother of Battles' repercussions and an ability to inspire 
the masses of the Arab people. This confidence emerged after 
the course of events was monitored, the international situation 
was digested, the balances of power were assessed, and history 
deeply studied. All this tells us that the enemies' course and 
interests are in constant contradiction with human will. More 
importantly, this confidence has provided a clear picture of the 
Arab nation's abilities to be involved in great actions of jihad 
and construction when requirements and factors of progress are 
accompanied by genuine policies. 
  From the outset, it has been clear that the subsidence of 
the 
wave of unilateral control of the fate of the world is a matter 
of time, which will not be long. This is clear despite the 
heavy price paid by humanity, especially the Iraqi people, who 
confronted a military aggression and continue to be subjected to 
an oppressive siege, because of the continued unilateral 
hegemony. 
  O sons of the glorious Arab nation, O Ba'thist strugglers: 
The Ba'th Party has pointed out the modern pan-Arab movement's 
maturity and ability to express its essence and objectives. At 
the same time, the Ba'th Party continued to view pan-Arab issues 
as a militant incentive and an instigator for yearning for an 
Arab awakening. Arab unity was and will be a cultural framework 
capable of maintaining the Arab nation's existence and ability 
to remain at the level of its message. Unity will continue to 
be the Arab nation's chance to achieve progress, improve its 
status, and emphasize its united identity. Unity is not a 
momentary need or a fallacy brought about by transient 
circumstances or by dreamy ideological adventures. Therefore, 
Arab unity is not a slogan raised today, to be forgotten 
tomorrow. In the past, whenever they sensed weakness or 
retrogression among the ranks of the Arab nation, hostile 
foreign powers, reactionary regimes, and advocates of 
parochialism attempted to undermine the idea of unity and waged 
systematic wars against it. All this has one purpose, namely, 
to ensure the role of the usurping Zionist entity as a force 
obstructing Arab advancement. 
  The regional plans aiming at obliterating pan-Arab identity, 
resisting Arab unity, and granting the Zionist entity geographic 
legitimacy and a stronger hegemonic role have proved lame and 
unachievable. Those plans take advantage of the climate of 
retrogression and disintegration and the role of colluding Arab 
regimes to weaken the trend of liberation, democracy, and unity, 
and to distract the masses' attention from their battles and 
real concerns. They offer false, useless solutions that only 
increase the masses' poverty and dependence on foreigners. At 
their best, such solutions can be described as being an 
expression of the state of affairs of the impotent ones, not of 
the Arab nation and its conscience. 
  The failure of regional policies and their role in weakening 
joint Arab action can be responded to only by action in 
accordance with a realistic, militant unionist plan, starting 
with an objective understanding of the phases of the struggle 
for unity and by providing the practical requirements for 
advancement. This plan should replace impotent and deceptive 
plans built on regional and international deals at the expense 
of our people's interests, principles, and future. 
  O masses of our militant people: The Palestinian Arab issue 
has remained a sensitive parameter that signals ebbs and tides 
in our Arab situation. It has been a measure of the situation 
of the masses and the level of their preparedness to wage major 
battles. Since its establishment, our party has viewed this 
issue as the essence of the Arab nation's ordeal and the core of 
the Arab cause. This stand proceeds from the party's realization 
of the extent of the danger posed by the Zionist scheme and the 
Jewish state's role of obstructing the Arabs' natural unity. 
the party's stand also stems from the prominent position of the 
Palestine question in the conscience of the masses and in the 
formulation of the modern pan- Arab consciousness and the Arab 
masses' collective approach to the Palestine question as a 
crucial issue. 
  Since its early beginnings, Palestine has been a basic part 
of the Ba'th Party's struggle. the party has been present on 
the Palestinian scene throughout all the stages of struggle, 
offering known sacrifices that culminated in the Mother of 
Battles and Iraq's glorious stand when the al-Husayn and 
al-'Abbas missiles pounded the usurping entity. The armed 
Palestinian resistance, the valiant intifadah, Iraq's victory in 
the al-Qadisiyah battle, and the momentum provided by the Mother 
of Battles have embodied the course of liberation, the need to 
provide the requirements of balance with the enemy, and revived 
hopes for the historic solution and set it as a strategic 
target. In contrast, the abortion of the will of liberation, 
emptying the Palestine question of its content, and the agent 
Arab regimes' adoption of a course aiming at liquidating the 
Palestine question have provided an atmosphere for maneuvers and 
the adoption of political effort as an alternative that 
disregards the resources of struggle, future chances, and the 
positive factors that can lead to weakening the enemy front and 
rectifying the regional and internal balances of power in our 
nation's interest. 
  And thus involvement in political and informational work in 
approaching the settlement strategy began to assume a more 
clear-cut character. At the same time there was an increasing 
loss of direction and a dilution of principles and enthusiasm 
for liberation, caused by temptations to accommodate the status 
quo under external and Arab pressures. The hardships to which 
the Palestinian Arab people are being subjected are being used 
as a pretext to recognize the Zionist enemy and to go along with 
the scheme to transform the bulk of the land of Palestine into 
disputed territory. 
  Developments unfolding in the Palestinian arena highlight 
two 
contradictory positions -- the position of the intifadah masses 
adhering to the goal of liberation and the fight to get 
recognition for the Palestinian people, and the position of the 
so-called settlement and dealing with [words indistinct] or 
reserve to achieve one strategy. 
  The bloody and outrageous massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque 
redrew part of the picture after a long spell of haziness, 
reminding Arabs and the world of the tragedies and ugliness of 
occupation and the hidden intentions of aggression. It exposed 
the lie of international legitimacy that is being driven into 
the background by the savagery of Zionist terror. An incident 
of this enormity provides fresh evidence of an aggressive nature 
that warrants a determined stand against present challenges and 
a better grasp of the truth about the enemy and the dichotomies 
of the human and moral and cultural aspects of the Arab-Zionist 
conflict. 
  The belittlement of our nation's rights and the Hebron 
massacre's implications furnish proof that coexistence with an 
enemy that denies the most basic conditions of life and 
aggresses against the most cherished sanctities is an 
impossibility. 
  Thus, the wretched attempts at brain-washing and cutting us 
off from our history in order to transform Palestine into a 
bridge for the Zionists to cross into the region are part of the 
culture of what was termed peace and settlement that seeks to 
promote the slogan of absorbing the Zionist entity. Such a 
slogan was bandied about in the past as a test balloon by 
suspect circles and reactionary regimes to sound out the 
reaction of the masses. This slogan was meant to serve sinister 
ends. It has been repeated [words indistinct] supported by a 
variety of factors to trumpet the humanitarian dimension of 
containing the Zionist entity, given our nation's potential 
possession of the edge promoting the notion that the Arab nation 
can afford to accept peace and conciliation with Israel and 
recognize its theft of Palestine today with an eye to winning 
the conflict in the future. This is an oversimplification 
caused by shortsightedness. The Zionist entity's existence is 
an imperialist creation brought about by division, subservience, 
and backwardness. This fact does not fall under the heading of 
a normal exchange of normal relations in the region. Palestine 
is the focal point of a vibrant pan-Arab struggle, and will 
remain so until it retrieves its Arabism. The Palestinian cause 
has assumed its status as a central issue for Arabs by virtue of 
the fact that Palestine was stolen, and due to the very nature 
of the conflict. The political dimension of the issue has 
assumed a special dimension. We should, therefore, refuse to 
marginalize it and thwart the Arab regimes' attempts to ignore 
it. This is despite the importance of other central Arab issues 
that determine the directions of Arab struggle and engage the 
attention of the masses. 
  Our Arab nation views the Palestinian issue as a central 
cause. The conspiracies to liquidate it only underscore the 
importance of working to help it, pursuing the patient struggle 
for liberating Palestine. For this reason, the masses of the 
occupied territories are providing the finest examples of 
courage and heroism and adherence to rights. They are turning 
the chapters of the tragedy of occupation and coercion into fine 
chapters of jihad, just as the uprising of the Arab masses in 
Egypt was an eloquent response to the advocates of normalization 
and a damnation of the regime that imperialism had devoted to 
advance its agenda. 
  These features that throb with the preparations of the Arab 
masses to pursue the struggle are the most conclusive proof that 
the Arab nation has wagered on its own resources and the 
awareness of its children as they counter attempts to sell the 
settlement to our nation. 
  Militant Arab masses; militant Ba'thists: Since the Ba'th 
took its first steps in the struggle, it has undertaken the 
responsibility of instilling the spirit of faith and freedom and 
confidence in the Arab nation. Its militants have pledged 
themselves to a disciplinary line that reinforces in them and 
the Arab masses the feeling of pride in our history and the Arab 
character and a cultural role enemical to shaky allegiances and 
a fascination with the glitter of false modernity. 
  For decades, it has continued to champion a meeting of 
hearts and minds between progressive Arabism and Islam, between 
the Arab character and Islam, to promote communication with 
nations and peoples to advance the causes of mankind. In this 
context, the intellectual, spiritual, cultural, military, and 
political victory scored in the glorious battle of Saddam's 
al-Qadisiyah has provoked the aggression, because the 
colonialist West succumbed to its aggressive instincts and 
reestablished the complexes dwelling within its centuries-old 
memories to nip in the bud the potential for true renaissance 
demonstrated by Muslims and Arabs, to neutralize them by 
crippling the forceful role of Iraq, which embodies the Arabs' 
quest for progress as well as the heroic defense of Arabism and 
Islam. 
  Hence, the jihad waged in the Mother of Battles was the 
epitome of adherence to principles, a manifestation of the 
determination to uphold basic values pertaining to the freedom 
of peoples, and an attempt to promote international relations to 
free them from the spirit of custodianship, and of the 
domination of world colonialism. 
  Our nation's discourse in its jihad mission, manifested in 
addresses by the leader of the faithful grouping, mujahid 
comrade Saddam Husayn, strengthened the people's hope that the 
new wave of domination would subside, that the forces of faith 
and jihad would triumph against brutal powers and tyrannical 
invaders everywhere. 
  In this climate, which was highly significant and in which 
intentions became crystal clear, steadfastness turned into a 
living example, and began to bear fruit. The rejection of and 
opposition to the U.S.-Zionist hegemonic course and its tyranny 
have begun to be felt, particularly after the halo surrounding 
this course began to fade because it does not uphold the values 
of justice and equality, because it opposes the peoples' 
interests and aspirations, because contradictions exist among 
those who enjoy spheres of influence and want to share the 
booty, and because of the emergence of the dynamism of 
scientific and technological advancement, which is bound to 
impact on the international economic situation, thanks to the 
newly-created regional blocs that are increasingly affecting 
international relations by various means. 
  The militant and patient Somali people have set another 
splendid example by vindicating the peoples' rights, as well as 
their ability to resist foreign intervention and the violation 
of national sovereignty. The Somali people have been able to 
make the aggressive Western alliance leave their territory, 
defeated and at a loss, not to mention the grave moral and 
political losses it sustained. 
  Day after day, the attempts and pressure to impose U.S. 
domination subside. These attempts and pressures are no longer 
useful, given the fact that there is less need for U.S. military 
protection in various parts of the world due to the end of the 
Cold War, and because the U.S. role in international investments 
is declining. Consequently, the United States has lost the 
seminal momentum in the world economy that it used to expand its 
influence. 
  Hence, threats to use force and pressure are becoming 
burdensome at a time when such threats cannot serve as a means 
to promote what officials called the new world order, which has 
proven to be a cover for evasion and deception. This has 
prompted some quarters that promoted this order to act against 
it, and to utterly abandon it. 
  The evidence for this is that the international policy 
pursued in the context of the unipolar order is experiencing a 
bottleneck. This is because the game of involving basic values 
and human destiny in international politics has backfired. The 
covers and slogans of democracy, human rights, anti-war 
sentiment, and environmental protection have called into serious 
question the double standards employed, as manifested in the 
successive crises and the marathon race to reclaim colonialist 
influence. This has demonstrated the lack of balance, as well 
as the propaganda content of all the political covers used by 
hegemonic forces. 
  Consequently, the upcoming phase is that of the erosion of 
hegemony after it was used to oppress and punish peoples, and to 
threaten their security and sovereignty with economic boycott, 
aggression, and economic embargoes. At the same time, it is the 
phase in which the rejection of domination and subjugation will 
mature and turn into international rebellion and disobedience. 
What is currently taking place in Russia is a referendum on its 
independent national choices. It is a manifestation of the 
importance of rehabilitating its international role and its 
national pride, which was trampled by the United States and its 
allies. This trampling of pride has become so objectionable 
that the Russian people are being pressured into abandoning all 
components of their sovereignty in return for deceptive and 
sweet promises that have caused Russia to lose its unique 
standing among the international community of nations. Russia 
has almost become subservient. 
  O sons of our glorious Arab nation; O you militant 
Ba'thists: 
On this glorious anniversary, one cannot escape the analogy 
between the phase in which the party was launched and the 
current phase in terms of the need to reestablish an Arab 
consciousness of the rules of the game at this point in time, 
the need to end the state of stagnation, and the need to work to 
reactivate intellectual and militant thought to highlight the 
jihad implications of the Mother of Battles and the spirit of 
heroism epitomized by the unique leadership of leader President 
Saddam Husayn, given the qualitative challenge the Mother of 
Battles posed to the nation, the challenge that is targeting the 
axioms of the pan-Arab struggle. 
  Therefore, Arab strugglers are required to make persistent 
moves to promote their struggle, because this is required by the 
need to rid the potential for renaissance of the burdensome 
negative phenomena which have pushed Arabs backwards. This is a 
must if we are to have a good understanding of the dialectics of 
renaissance and decline, an understanding that enables us to 
cope with the current circumstances and employ proper 
intellectual and aggressive criteria to reach an objective 
assessment of the phenomena of this dialectic. 
  Spontaneous popular vigilance during the Mother of Battles 
was the result of an awareness of Iraq's pan-Arab stand and 
national awakening. Responsibility for maintaining clarity and 
developing the struggle require the consolidation of the masses 
with jihad principles and the enlightenment of the people about 
the objectives of the nation's battle, its historical depth, and 
cultural content. 
  Our nation's fate is to repulse the colonialist foreign 
onslaught, prevent infiltration into national ranks, and stop 
the exacerbation of its contradictions. We must hold fast to 
the principled course in order to remain steadfast in the face 
of old and new plots. 
  The forces of the Arab nation can abort the plots of 
fragmentation and the internationalization of internal problems. 
They can mobilize their potential to lift the blockade of Iraq 
and coordinate their plans and stands to reject hegemony and 
plots of submission. They can maintain their gains with the 
unity of the Arab masses and reinforce democratic and united 
achievements. 
  In light of the Arab masses' struggle, history, and 
objectives, militant action should be revived in national and 
pan-Arab life to restore the shining face and honorable role of 
popular Arab struggle. Our political parties and unions, our 
Arab intellectual and artistic bodies, and all vital 
organizations in the nation are required to wage the decisive 
battle -- each according to their position and capabilities -- 
to maintain the spirit of resistance of the Mother of Battles. 
They are called on to wage an uprising to decide the fate of 
our conflict against occupation and aggression, on the path of 
awakening and cultural rejuvenation. 
  The living nations, which face difficult circumstances and 
wage struggle, look forward to turning events, no matter how 
great they are, into factors of strength for the future. 
  Let all honest good people pool their efforts to prepare the 
factors of steadfastness and confrontation on the basis of 
principled and historical grounds so the achievements of the 
Arab revolution and struggle will be established deep in the 
heart of Arabs and human history. 
  By providing a creative framework to move the masses, and by 
establishing a large-scale militant Arab front in light of a 
faithful future pan-Arab plan, our nation will restore its 
strength and proceed with its jihad to resume its cultural role. 
It will seize the historic initiative through the strength of 
principles and the will of people. 
  On the party's anniversary, Ba'thists call on our nation to 
sharpen their determination, to move toward the integration and 
unity of the Arab struggle strategy, and to develop formulas and 
levels of action to hallmarks of steadfastness and victory and 
to build the new Arab homeland and new Arab individuals who know 
their role and who have faith in their mission. 
  Long live the Arab nation and its steadfast sons in Iraq and 
Palestine in defense of Arab future and rights. Long live the 
Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, the symbol of the nation's unity and 
the inspirer of its generations. Faithful greetings to the 
Ba'th founder and the inspirer of its generations. Greetings of 
love to the mujahid leader Comrade Saddam Husayn, the knight of 
the nation and the leader of its awakening. 
  Glory and immortality to the righteous martyrs of our 
nation; 
the martyrs of Palestine, the Ba'th, the al-Qadisiyah, and the 
Mother of Battles; all the martyrs of its crucial causes. 
  [Signed] The National Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th 
Party, April 1994

  [Excerpt] Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, the president 
of the Republic, has affirmed the cohesion of the internal front 
and its firm stand against all challenges facing the nation's 
march. During his meeting today with the leaders of information 
and press bodies at the general secretariat of the Council of 
Ministers, the president discussed the public's understanding of 
the revolution's programs and his perception of its achievements 
in various fields, particularly with regard to the security 
situation. 
  His excellency said recent attempts to cast doubt on the 
revolution's leadership by some people was due to personal 
reasons or to agents from foreign quarters. Lt. Gen. 'Umar 
al-Bashir said any conspirator who tried to hinder the Sudanese 
people would not be able to achieve his aims, pointing out that 
the revolution is proceeding despite all challenges. 
  The president of the Republic touched on the talks he held 
recently with U.S. envoy Madeleine Albright. He said President 
Clinton's envoy did not touch on anything new in the talks. He 
pointed out that she commented on the situation and the U.S. 
accusations against Sudan with regard to human rights, terrorism 
and relief. We submitted, during the talks, Sudan's stance 
towards the U.S. Administration, he said, adding that the 
contentious issue, in essence, was the issue of Islam. 
  Lt. Gen. al-Bashir described the meeting as the start of a 
serious dialogue between the two countries. He confirmed 
Sudan's desire to continue the dialogue, so that relations 
between Sudan and the United States would be based on a clear 
foundation. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with President 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir by Kamal </F>
Hamid in Nairobi, date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Hamid] Do you expect to attain peace after 
Nairobi's current negotiations? 
  [Al-Bashir] Yes, we have come for this purpose. Our 
delegation is under Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah, chairman of the 
Transitional National Council, who chaired all the previous 
rounds of negotiations. We are convinced of the need to depend 
on what was discussed in the past. We love peace and hate war. 
We are aware that the other side is the same. However, this 
does not prevent the existence of a group whose interests are 
linked with this war. We know of the existence of regional, 
international, and, regrettably, local forces that believe that 
the continuation of the war will realize their desire to remove 
the current government by putting pressure on us and spreading 
rumors. 
  [Hamid] You are speaking of international pressures. Certain 
circles indicate the possibility that you will offer concessions. 
  [Al-Bashir] They are harboring an illusion. We believe in 
God and in fate, whether for good or for worse. We are aware 
that nothing will afflict us unless it is ordained for us. They 
themselves are aware of the false allegations that we attack 
civilians and prevent aid from reaching the affected people, who 
are Sudanese citizens. We gather aid for them from all the 
people and we provide transportation through the Nile as well as 
by railway and by air. All organizations working in this field 
can testify to the truth of this. 
  I reiterate that we have principles. We will not relinquish 
them. These principles have been accepted by our people, who 
realize the size of the external plotting. They have announced 
their readiness to meet every eventuality. In alluding to 
certain local forces, I meant some Sudanese citizens from the 
opposition who reside in hotels abroad. They are pushing 
colonialism in their own country in order to regain the power 
they think belongs to them forever. 
  [Hamid] Did it not occur to you to negotiate with opposition 
figures from the north, who are both inside the country and 
abroad? 
  [Al-Bashir] We negotiate over whatever advances Sudan's 
interests. If you are asking about leaders of the banned 
parties, we have asked them to take an active part in 
shouldering responsibilities. But they have their eyes set on 
power. For evidence, watch their meetings and coordination with 
Western forces that do not wish the country well. Such people 
think that power in the country is a cake to be carved up and 
that being in office should bring with it wealth and control of 
the country's resources. The Ministry of Trade used to be 
coveted, given the privileges it brings with it. This ministry 
had to be divided into two sections. One was for internal trade. 
It was entrusted to the Democratic Unionist Party so party 
members who were in business would exploit it for their own 
benefit. The Ministry of Foreign Trade usually went to the 
Ummah Party and was handled by Mubarak al-Fadil al-Mahdi. All 
the Sudanese will testify to his practices at the ministry. We 
now view government as an exercise in power-sharing and a burden 
rather than a cake. The Ministry of Trade is not important any 
more. We have scrapped the import system licenses altogether 
and the licenses are now handled by commercial banks. We now 
consider the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources and 
Irrigation Ministry to be the most important. This is to 
promote the exploitation of the country's resources and 
self-reliance. We have achieved a good measure of success on 
that front, which has earned us the West's hostility. 
  [Hamid] What is your assessment of the Arab community's 
reaction to the challenges facing Sudan? 
  [Al-Bashir] Regrettably, a unified Arab stand is completely 
absent. However, we still hope that Arab reconciliation will be 
restored and the Arab atmosphere cleared. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih by </F>
Sumayyah Ahmad in Cairo "during the meetings of the Arab Foreign 
Ministers Council at the Arab League headquarters"] 
  [Text] [Ahmad] What are the developments in the south? 
  [Abu-Salih] Let us return to May of last year, when a 
ranking 
Sudanese delegation travelled to Abuja to hold talks with 
Garang, who did not attend the meetings. He sent his deputy 
Musa al-Bashir instead. Despite this move indicating his 
derision and unwillingness to establish peace, we continued 
discussing the basic issues for three weeks. We found a 
solution to around 80 percent of these issues. 
  At the same time, there was another Sudanese delegation 
negotiating in Nairobi with a delegation from the United 
Faction. We made some positive progress. But developments in 
Nigeria then made it difficult to continue negotiations. 
  In September of last year, the (EANGAD) [abbreviation, 
parenthesis as published] group in East Africa proposed 
mediation to form a committee from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda, 
and Kenya. It held many meetings on the presidential or foreign 
ministerial level in the different places. But there was no 
clear objective behind these meetings. We were made to 
understand that negotiations are the objective so that EANGAD 
does not negotiate on their or our behalf. 
  I went to Nairobi last month to confirm our adherence to and 
welcoming of mediation on condition that a negotiating schedule 
be set out, that negotiations be direct, and that there be a 
specific working agenda. The Nairobi meeting was held on 8 
March. President al-Bashir traveled on 17 March and met 
President Moi. We believe this was a good beginning. Agreement 
was reached on a second round of talks on 15 May in accordance 
with the old schedule. We believe we need to build on what has 
been achieved in the past, when agreement was reached on many 
issues. We also believe that future meetings should take place 
to discuss the other problems. 
  [Ahmad] Recently, some proposals were made on the right of 
the south to self-determination. Was this issue discussed in 
the negotiations? 
  [Abu-Salih] Not at all. They proposed some ideas on the 
working agenda, the most important of which was to add a new 
item, the right to self-determination. We rejected this 
totally. They are nothing but a group of rebels forming a 
minority. The reason we do not talk to them is not because they 
carry arms, but because we believe that the solution always lies 
in dialogue. We have no intention of deciding the issue 
militarily, although this is our duty and mission. There is no 
power that can prevent us from being flexible. These people are 
not talking in the name of the south. 
  [Ahmad] You have often pointed out the existence of foreign 
circles supporting the separatists. Who are these circles? 
  [Abu-Salih] There are American and British circles. The two 
governments are not too distant from each other. There are many 
seminars being held in the two countries. The most recent one 
was held in an American research center in October. It called 
for the unity of the factions. Congressmen attended. Another 
seminar was held in the British House of Lords, although none of 
the lords attended. The topic of the seminar was the right to 
self-determination in the south. 
  The archbishop of Canterbury and many other figures and 
officials visited the south without the permission of the 
Sudanese Government. 
  [Ahmad] The Arab foreign ministers issued a resolution at 
the 
end of their recent meeting rejecting every attempt to divide 
Sudan. Is this stance considered enough for Sudan? 
  [Abu-Salih] Undoubtedly, it was a supportive stance, beyond 
our expectations, when the Arab brothers competed to highlight 
and confirm their country's position on the unity of Sudan, 
especially Egypt's stance. We do not wish to polarize the Arab 
nation or seek military or material support. But we wanted to 
warn the foreign sides that there is Arab moral support for the 
unity of Sudan's territory. 
  [Ahmad] This leads us to Sudanese-Egyptian relations. 
  [Abu-Salih] The differences between the two governments are 
not beyond resolving if there is confidence between us. We are 
still waiting for Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa [to come to 
Khartoum]. I do not believe we will need many meetings between 
us. I must point out that Egypt's stance on the south is 
honorable and responsible, without anyone asking it to be so. 
  [Ahmad] How do you explain Sudan's stance opposing Egypt's 
joining the preferential trade agreement for the countries of 
East and South Africa? 
  [Abu-Salih] That is not true. Countries other than Sudan 
objected. I did not attend this meeting. 
  [Ahmad] But Sudan did object? 
  [Abu-Salih] Yes. But two other countries are very close to 
Egypt. I do not wish to discuss this topic. 
  [Ahmad] In what way does expelling Sudan from the IMF affect 
the economy in Sudan? 
  [Abu-Salih] Primarily, the IMF stance on Sudan is a 
political 
stance, not a scientific one.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih </F>
by Muhammad Jamal 'Arafah in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] ['Arafah] Is there concrete 
evidence that Israel is supplying the southern rebels with 
weapons? 
  [Abu-Salih] It is a fact that Israeli weapons are reaching 
the rebels. We have had evidence in the past. Israel has been 
involved in supporting the rebellion since the sixties. All the 
rebels' weapons originate in Israel. The incident in which a 
plane loaded with weapons was headed for Uganda is just one 
aspect of Israel's support for the rebels. 
  ['Arafah] Have you agreed with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa on 
a date for resumption of the talks on Hala'ib? Why have 
negotiations been postponed for so long? 
  [Abu-Salih] We have been waiting for Foreign Minister Musa 
since September. We have sent him an invitation but he has not 
come. I told him this when he visited me (in the hotel). No 
agreement was reached with him on a date. However, we are 
waiting for him at any time. 
  Regarding the postponement of the talks, why don't you ask 
Egypt about this postponement? Why don't you ask Foreign 
Minister Musa this question? We have agreed to proceed in 
accordance with what Presidents Mubarak and al-Bashir agreed 
upon--namely, to draw up a framework for relations between the 
two countries. We have not been negligent and we do not want to 
blame anyone. Therefore, we did not want to submit the issue of 
Hala'ib to the Arab League meetings. We are still waiting for 
'Amr Musa to honor us with a visit! 
  ['Arafah] It has been said that there is U.S. support for 
the rebels in the south. On the other hand, Sudanese Foreign 
Ministry officials have stated that they are convinced that the 
United States does not want to topple the present regime. Is 
there a contradiction in the stand of the United States? 
  [Abu-Salih] We take everyone at their word. The United 
States, according to its ambassador in Khartoum, says it does 
not support the rebels and does not do anything to topple the 
government. Secret actions by other nonofficial U.S. quarters 
(for example intelligence) is another matter! 
  ['Arafah] It has been reiterated that there is a new 
dialogue between the United States and Sudan. For this purpose, 
the U.S. President has appointed a special representative to 
Sudan. He will also send his UN ambassador to Sudan at the end 
of this month. 
  [Abu-Salih] Dialogue with the United States started a long 
time ago. U.S. Secretary Christopher referred to this dialogue 
even though Sudan is included on the list of the states that 
support terrorism. Recently, there has been the impression or 
signals that there is hope that this dialogue will be continued. 
For our part, we have already stated that we need balanced 
relations with the United States. I will meet with President 
Clinton's envoy on 31 March. She will carry a message from 
Clinton to al-Bashir. I believe that this mission will help 
promote dialogue between the two sides. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 7 Apr (MENA)--The Sudanese Ummah Party has 
announced that the Sudanese security agencies rearrested 
al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, leader of the party and former prime 
minister, 24 hours after releasing him, without giving any 
reasons. 
  The party said in a statement in Cairo today that the day 
before yesterday, security authorities asked al-Mahdi about the 
party's activities at home and abroad, his 'Id al-Fitr sermon, 
and his continuing refusal to reconcile with the ruling regime. 
  The statement said: "The arrest reaffirms the confusion and 
tension experienced by the regime after losing every 
justification for survival." 
  The statement appealed to the world community, human rights 
organizations, and Arab and non-Arab media to pressure the 
Sudanese regime to release al-Mahdi and all Sudanese prisoners 
immediately.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] During a meeting on Thursday 
evening between the foreign minister of Yemen and Mr. Velayati, 
our foreign minister, the two parties exchanged views on the 
historical ties between the two countries and regional and 
Islamic issues. They also expressed their interest in expanding 
and strengthening bilateral relations and stressed the need for 
the unity and solidarity of Islamic countries in order to 
neutralize the malicious plans of the enemies of Islam. 
  At the meeting, Mr. Velayati expressed our country's support 
for Yemeni unity and said that a solution for Yemen's problems 
and the existence of a strong and united Yemen are to the 
benefit of peace and stability in the region. He added: Those 
who want to create discord in the united ranks of Muslims have 
no interest in a united Yemen. 
  Our foreign minister, pointing out that alien powers cannot 
guarantee the region's security, stressed: The expansion of 
cooperation among Islamic countries is required for 
strengthening the world of Islam. The Islamic Republic of Iran 
believes that if such a cooperation had been prevalent in the 
Islamic world, the enemies of Islam would not have dared occupy 
Palestine, which is at the heart of the Islamic countries. 
  Mr. Muhammad Salim Basindwah, the Yemeni foreign minister, 
described the Islamic Republic of Iran as an important regional 
power and called for the expansion of bilateral relations.

  [Text] Tehran, April 7, IRNA -- Ayatollah Musavi-Ardabili 
and Ayatollah Azari-Qomi in an interview with a daily here 
Thursday emphasized that the anti-American stance of the Islamic 
revolution in Iran should continue. 
  Ayatollah Musavi-Ardabili, Tehran's substitute Friday prayer 
leader and former chief justice, told the morning daily 'SALAM' 
that those who imagined ties with the U.S. would help them make 
progress, were making a big blunder. Because, he stressed, in 
its relations with other nations, the U.S. adheres to no 
specific objective but its hegemonistic aims. 
  Also commenting on relations with the U.S., Ayatollah 
Azari-Qomi told the daily that it was to the benefit of the 
Islamic Republic and Islam not to have ties with Washington. 
The ayatollah, a theologian at Qom Seminary, further added that 
although the Islamic Republic of Iran had fully severed ties 
with the U.S., still whispers were being heard inside the 
country on the resumption of ties with Washington. "These 
murmurs should be stopped under any circumstances and this could 
be done by the people themselves." 
  Stressing that the slogan 'Down with the U.S.' should have a 
wider dimension, Ayatollah Azari-Qomi called on the press and 
officials to inform the public of the positive outcome of having 
no ties with the U.S.

  [Text] The Islamic Republic of Iran and Syria believe that 
peace talks with the Zionist regime are nothing but a plot and 
no peace awaits the region. This was stated by Majles Deputy 
Speaker Hasan Rowhani, who had gone to Syria at the head of a 
delegation, after his return to Tehran last night. He said that 
his talks with Syrian officials and combatant Palestinian and 
Lebanese groups covered Middle East problems and recent 
developments in the occupied territories. 
  The Majles deputy speaker added that in these talks all the 
combatant Palestinian and Lebanese groups emphasized the fact 
that under current sensitive conditions, arrogance should be 
strongly confronted and the disgrace of compromise with the 
Zionists should not be accepted. He said that talks with these 
groups, which focused on the consolidation and continuation of 
the struggle against world arrogance and the Zionist regime, 
were fruitful. 
  During his visit to Syria, in addition to his discussions 
with the Syrian president and other officials, Rowhani also met 
with some Hizballah deputies in the Lebanese parliament.

    [Editorial Report] Tehran IRIB Television Second Program 
Network in Persian at 1530 GMT carries its regular "Political 
Roundtable" program. The guest in the 50-minute program is 
Hojjat ol-Eslam Mostafa Ha'eri-Fumani, director general of the 
Persian Gulf desk of the Iranian Foreign Ministry. He is 
interviewed by an unidentified correspondent on the topic of the 
stance of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] following the 
recent foreign ministers meeting in Riyadh, and the hajj issue. 
The program follows its usual format of approximately 
five-minute video reports interspersed with questions and 
answers. 
  The first report repeats a Foreign Ministry statement in 
response to the final communique of the GCC summit in Riyadh, 
after which the correspondent asks: 
  "Mr. Fumani, although it was expected of the members of the 
Persian Gulf Cooperation Council [PGCC] to stress, in their 
final statement, the agreeable and positive aspects of relations 
between members and regional countries, we see the final 
statement causing greater tension among regional countries. 
What is your evaluation of this sessions's final statement?" 
  Fumani replies: "In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. As you pointed out, it is a source of astonishment. 
In a situation where the Islamic world, international society, 
and in particular our region -- which is very sensitive -- need 
tranquility and where Islamic countries need cooperative 
thinking, a united vision, and cooperation, we witness meetings 
which are producing results that contradict the needs of Muslim 
people and nations, are more likely to create divisions and 
tensions among nations, and issue statements and acts in line 
with this. 
  "It seems to me that the final statement of the 50th session 
of the foreign ministers of the PGCC cannot be evaluated 
separately. These days we are witnessing acts that tend to 
intensify divisions inside and outside the region. For example, 
PGCC members have had differences and contradictions in the 
past. But their differences have intensified these days. You 
must have witnessed this; it was also in the international 
media. For instance, divisions which erupted between Kuwait 
and Qatar. Or previous differences between Qatar and Saudi 
Arabia which have been again intensified and are well on the 
agenda. In the session of the member countries of the PGCC, a 
significant part of the discussions were on differences among 
themselves. Furthermore, news available here and there and in 
the media indicates that some member countries intensified 
contradictions with their neighbors, such as what we are 
witnessing in Yemen. Well, after a long separation and 
following a desire by the nations of the former South and North 
Yemen as well as the peoples of the region, the two Yemens 
united and moved on the path of unity. But we are now 
witnessing intense differences between the north and the south, 
and we see some regional countries and even some members of the 
PGCC aggravating the difficulties and contradictions between 
these countries. Or things that we possibly see in the 
intensification of domestic differences in Afghanistan -- where 
a selfless and struggling nation managed to bring down its enemy 
and take over the management of the country's affairs. But now 
they are suffering from differences. Some Islamic countries, in 
the region, instead of helping, are intensifying the 
differences. There are the things that we see in the statement 
of the 50th session regarding the Islamic Republic. Issues 
regarding the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf and the 
baseless claims made by one of these countries, the United Arab 
Emirates. Of course this is not the first time that the claims 
have been made, for the case has a 20-year history. It has been 
made four or five times. But it has intensified recently. 
Taking into account the international situation and the 
situation in the Middle East, taking into account the fact that 
some persons outside the region wish to impose a prepared and 
predetermined plan on regional countries; taking into account 
the long struggle against the Zionist enemy in some countries; 
and taking into account the fact that the Islamic world needs 
cooperation and unity; and taking into account the crafty acts 
of the Zionist regime and the killing of Muslims -- the killing 
of innocents at a time of prayer and fasting -- it is necessary 
for Muslims to unite in order to attain their ideals and goals." 
  These remarks are followed by a report on background to the 
GCC and a repeat of a commentary on the GCC's stance toward the 
issue of the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser 
Tunbs. 
  Asked to assess Iran's relations with the PGCC member 
countries, Fumani replies: "Our neighboring countries, 
particularly the states that are situated in the southern 
section of the Persian Gulf, or in other words, members of the 
PGCC, had previously also made wrong a analysis and this is not 
the first time they have fallen for a wrong analysis. During 
the Iraqi war against Iran they made a wrong analysis, thinking 
that Iran was their enemy. I remember that case from the time 
when I was the ambassador to the region, in the United Arab 
Emirates; when we held meetings with them they would say, in a 
friendly way, that we are afraid of Iran and that if Iran 
becomes a powerful regional country it may pose a threat against 
us or our interests." He goes on to say that during the past 15 
years Iran has always supported its neighbors and its foreign 
policy gives priority to its ties with other neighboring and 
Muslims countries. 
  Fumani continues: "During the war that Saddam Husayn waged 
against Iran all of those countries, in one way or the other, 
supported the Ba'thist regime of Saddam, making him powerful in 
order to avert a situation created by their wrong analysis, 
thinking that a powerful Islamic Republic would pose a threat 
against them." He then says that the Persian Gulf littoral 
states realized their mistake when Saddam invaded Kuwait. 
  He continues: Since the second Persian Gulf war we have 
witnessed some changes in the judgement and thinking of those 
countries and in the way they have opted for appropriate 
stances, but at a very slow-moving pace. If we wanted to give 
an assessment of the trend of our ties with the regional 
countries during the last 15 years, we could describe it as a 
developing process and an expanding process. That is the 
expansion of relations. But we have never been satisfied with 
the slow-moving expansion of ties. We believe that regional 
countries, as neighbors of the Islamic Republic, should be able 
to live side by side the Islamic Republic, have a peaceful life, 
live in an atmosphere of understanding and a healthy climate, 
and work alongside each other in a healthy and peaceful 
situation, particularly when it comes to the safeguarding of the 
sensitive waterway of the Persian Gulf, which can serve all 
regional interests. 
  "During the last 15 years the process of our relations with 
those countries has varied. Our relations are better with some 
of those countries. Our relations with some of those countries 
have reached a level where many agreements and memorandums are 
forged and are developing in a satisfactory manner. In future 
we should witness the presence of high-ranking officials from a 
number of those countries in the Islamic Republic. Of course 
Qatar is currently leading the way and its highest official, 
even higher than its Foreign Ministry officials -- the crown 
prince -- has already been to Iran. In future we shall see the 
highest ranking officials of Kuwait and Qatar in the Islamic 
Republic. We shall, God willing, hold meetings with them in a 
friendly and sincere atmosphere which should present a supreme 
model of neighborly and peaceful life to the people of the 
region." 
  The correspondent says: "Mr. Fumani, the majority of the 
PGCC 
members adopt a united stance. But when they meet separately 
with Islamic Republic officials they adopt stances different 
from those taken at the PGCC. What is the reason for that?" 
  Fumani replies: "That is right. That is an issue which we 
also raise with them. Some of those countries, in separate and 
private talks with us, say that we should not attribute the PGCC 
actions to them and that, in fact, their relationship with us is 
a special one. Of course during the 11th and 12th PGCC sessions, 
and particularly the 12th session which was held in Kuwait, 
they reviewed the issue more precisely. A number of those 
countries mentioned that they wanted to have special relations 
with the Islamic Republic and the Council, as a whole, sometimes 
acts in a way which is disturbing to bilateral moves. It was in 
that session that they made the decision to allow every 
individual member to establish separate ties with the Islamic 
Republic, and a number of those countries took further steps in 
that context. Obviously the role of a number of those countries 
-- that play a more influential role in the adoption of their 
collective stances, as you know -- is very effective, and we are 
aware of them." 
  The program is interrupted at 1600 GMt for a seven-minute 
newscast. The program resumes with a report on the dispute with 
Saudi Arabia on the issue of the hajj. An announcer reads the 
following commentary. After the news bulletin, the final report 
repeated Iran's accusation that Saudi Arabia had broken the deal 
with Iran on the number of pilgrim's for this year's hajj, see 
IRTV1 021644, but added that the Saudi authorities had taken the 
decision under pressure from Washington. Fumani's comments on 
the subject were mild compared to previous Iranian 
pronouncements, saying that Iran understood that Saudi Arabia 
could not cope with a massive influx of pilgrims every year. 
[passage omitted] 
  "This year, the Saudi regime -- in violation of previous 
agreements and the results of negotiations between Tehran and 
Riyadh -- has announced that, because of particular 
difficulties, it will accept only 60,000 Iranian pilgrims. 
Therefore, the Saudi regime has once again started to put a 
spanner in the works of the great gathering of the world's 
Muslims. Arabia took this stance at a time when a number of 
events during recent months had strengthened the idea that 
Riyadh, taking into account regional and global realities, had 
reexamined its policies and discovered that an improvement in 
relations with Tehran was an objective and tangible necessity. 
  "A number of political experts, considering these 
developments, believed that Arabian authorities had apparently 
found out that the efforts of Western powers, especially 
America, to prevent an improvement of relations of other 
countries with the Islamic Republic of Iran was only in the 
interest of Washington and would, in practice, be to the 
detriment of regional countries. These experts emphasized that 
Riyadh did not see its anti-Islamic Iran policies to be in its 
interest, and viewed efforts to exclude the most powerful 
country of the region from regional developments as a useless 
effort. 
  "Although a number of events had pointed to the correctness 
of this analysis and the pragmatism of the Saudi rulers in 
certain situations, the recent policies of Arabia show that 
because of certain reasons, including renewed pressure from the 
White House, the Riyadh authorities have not yet reached a clear 
understanding of future regional relations." The announcer goes 
on to state that participation presence in the hajj is the right 
of Iranian Muslims. 
  The announcer then asks Fumani to comment on the hajj issue. 
After discussing the importance of the hajj for Muslims, Fumani 
says: "We have had difficulties over the past 15 years 
concerning the hajj. Considering the large number of people in 
our country who enthusiastically wish to be honored by visiting 
the house of God...[pauses] On the other hand, Saudi Arabian 
officials have always said that the holy places do not have the 
capacity for a large number of pilgrims. Of course, whenever 
there was tension in our relations with Saudi Arabia, it would 
affect the hajj; or vice versa: whenever there was a problem 
over the hajj, it would affect bilateral relations. We have 
always told Saudi Arabia that bilateral relations should be 
separate from the issues of hajj; and that hajj is an 
international Islamic issue, it does not concern one or two 
countries alone." 
  He then says: "Saudi Government officials have always said 
that the house of God does not have the capacity for a flood, 
for a large influx of people. This is, of course, 
understandable." He then reviews the history of the hajj quota 
system, and says that the Saudi authorities are not observing an 
agreement made between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Saudi 
Arabia in Muscat, Oman, in 1993. He says: "The Saudi authorities 
are not abiding by this agreement. Of course, this is still 
unacceptable for the Islamic Republic. At the same time, we do 
understand what Saudi government officials are saying when they 
announce that the holy places do not have the capacity. Of 
course, they in turn must understand the situation of the 
Islamic Republic and abide by their promises and signatures. We 
have announced to the Saudi Government that we are ready to hold 
negotiations." The program ends at 1620 GMT.

  [Text] In a speedy reaction, the UN secretary general and 
the Security Council have condemned the martyrdom-seeking action 
of a revolutionary Muslim Palestinian at 'Afula. 
  The representative of Hamas, the Islamic Resistance 
Movement, 
in Tehran described the stance of the UN Security Council as 
spiteful. He said: This proves that the Palestinian nation 
should not expect sympathy from the United Nations or the 
Security Council, because they have always remained silent in 
the face of the daily murder of Palestinian women and children 
by the Zionists.

  [Text] On Wednesday April 6, a Palestinian youth in a 
martyrdom-seeking act carried out a car-bomb attack against a 
commuter bus in central Afula in northern occupied Palestine. 
At least eight Zionists were killed and more than 60 were 
wounded in the attack. The Islamic movement of HAMAS [Islamic 
Resistance Movement], in a telephone contact with REUTER news 
agency, claimed responsibility for the attack, announcing that 
the attack was carried out in retaliation to the massacre of the 
fasting Muslims in al-Khalil mosque. 
  According to political observers, the act is unprecedented 
in 
its nature since it has been carried out inside the occupied 
territories and therefore, is very significant. 
  Observers say this kind of operation against the usurper 
forces is completely understandable for the world opinion 
because it was predictable in the wake of the horrible crime 
committed by the Zionists in the al-Khalil mosque in which the 
worshipers were gunned down indiscriminately. 
  Though the Israeli security forces had taken precautionary 
measures during the 40-day period after the al-Khalil incident, 
they hardly thought that the Islamic Resistance Movement of 
Palestine would be able to inflict such a severe blow on the 
Zionists inside the occupied territories where security was 
tighter as compared to other regions. 
  Actually the operation proved that the intifadah is not 
restricted to only the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, but the 
struggle against the usurpers is widespread throughout the 
occupied territories and that all Palestinians believe in the 
struggle. 
  By laying down his life on Wednesday, the Palestinian youth 
drove home the point to the Zionists that they cannot spill the 
blood of tens of Palestinians with the support of their Western 
allies and escape from paying the price for the brutal act. 
  There is no doubt that the Western media consider the attack 
as a terrorist action, but for those fighting against the 
Zionist usurpers inside the occupied territories the act of the 
Palestinian youth can never be considered as a terrorist act, 
rather it is considered as a brave act in retaliation to the 
horrible crime of the Zionists in al-Khalil mosque. 
  The usurper regime of al-Qods [Jerusalem] will be well aware 
that the outcome of its suppressive policy and aggression 
against the rights of the Palestinian Muslims would be nothing 
except the retaliatory operations and further, there is no 
doubt, that the continued aggression of the Zionists will not 
only fail to hold the Palestinian Muslims' struggle for 
liberation, but would give it further momentum.

  [Text] In his Friday prayer sermons, Ayatollah Ahmad 
Jannati, the acting Friday imam of Tehran, said that the 
martyrdom-seeking attack by a Palestinian youth was a clear 
example of the uprising of Muslims against the arrogance's 
injustice and oppression. 
  He referred to the compromise plans in connection with the 
Palestinian issue and said: Compromise by claimants to 
leadership of Palestine does not solve any of the Zionist 
regime's problems. 
  In his second sermon, Ayatollah Jannati referred to the 
emphasis by the eminent leader [Khamene'i] on the importance of 
work ethics, the social order, and a serious attitude towards 
work. He said that the lack of such an attitude constituted one 
of the shortcomings of the society, and called for greater 
efforts in this area. 
  He then alluded to the grave responsibilities of the Voice 
and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran as a medium for 
communications. He stressed the need for greater efforts, as 
well as more help for that organization, so as to enable it to 
provide a more valuable service. 
  The acting Friday imam of Tehran then set out to describe 
all 
the pressures exerted by America with the aim of forcing the 
Islamic Republic of Iran to surrender. He stressed once again 
that the Iranian nation would never surrender to tyranny and 
oppression.

<F P=106> [Political commentary: "Clinton's Words--Bigger Than His </F>
Mouth"] 
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton alleged very clearly 
that "Jerusalem is an integral and permanent capital of Israel 
and cannot be divided." 
  These remarks have caused manifestations of hatred and 
abhorrence on the part of the Palestinian political groups that 
have broken away from the PLO. These allegations are the 
political stance of a government that is seeking to project 
itself as a "neutral mediator" to create conditions for what it 
terms "Arab-Israeli peace." These remarks were made when 
Israel's domination of Jerusalem and, in fact, the usurpation of 
Jordan's West Bank have not been officially recognized by the 
United Nations. Thus, the city of Jerusalem-- which is revered 
by followers of all divine religions and has a special sanctity 
and importance--has been described as the indivisible capital of 
the despotic Zionist tyrants. 
  This opinion clearly indicates the dimensions of U.S. 
support 
for the occupationist regime of Palestine and depicts the 
position of Israel as the progeny of the United States. It is 
certain that the Zionists have laid great premium on U.S. 
support for the attainment of their objectives and the 
materialization of their expansionist policies, 
  Therefore, if the Zionists covet the territory of their 
neighboring countries; ensure their existence by the policy of 
terrorism, intimidation, and repression; perpetrate atrocities 
such as the massacre of fasting worshipers in al-Khalil [Hebron] 
without any pretext; and constantly speak from a position of 
superiority and strength in the rounds of talks with the 
spineless Arab regimes, it is because their actions are based on 
the overt support of the Americans. 
  Since the dawn of history, holy Jerusalem has suffered 
numerous incidents of tyranny and suppression by Europeans, 
Americans, and then the Israelis. Today at the height of the 
treasonous indifference of the regional Arab rulers, it is on 
its way to becoming the main power base of the murderers of the 
Palestinian nation. 
  The fact is that Arab governments have played a considerable 
role in paving the way for the current situation. The crisis of 
the oil war and the synchronized stances of the Arabs and 
Zionists during that crisis created the psychological 
circumstances for subsequent sessions aimed at a compromise 
between the Arabs and the Israeli despots. This provided a 
conducive background for the overt and covert closeness between 
the Zionists and Arab echelons and proved to be an important 
weapon for neutralizing the struggles of the Muslim Palestinian 
nation for the liberation of their country from the clutches of 
the despots. 
  Unfortunately, the Islamic world today is riddled by 
dissent, 
discord, and disharmony more than it ever has been. The 
governments ruling over the Islamic countries have been 
alienated from Islam and Islamic values on the one hand, and 
from their own people on the other. 
  This alienation--coupled with the phenomena of an 
inferiority 
complex, underestimating themselves, and bartering themselves 
away-- on the part of the Islamic countries before the Zionists 
has constantly been one of the basic factors for the gradual 
growth of Zionism and the expansion of its political influence 
and domain in the heartland of Islamic territories. 
  The consolidation of the Zionist strategy in occupied 
Palestine and their gradual infiltration into the neighboring 
countries, which was a culmination of the traitorous conferences 
of compromise between Arabs and Israel in the region in the past 
one or two years, is to a large extent the result of this very 
defensiveness, laxity, self-bartering, and erroneous perceptions 
on the part of the rulers and shaykhs of the region. 
  It is certain that for every step the Arab governments take 
backward in the face of the extortionist demands of the United 
States and the government it has spawned in occupied Palestine, 
the Americans and Zionists rush two steps forward in a more 
exacting and audacious manner for greater privileges, and 
describe this policy as "peace." 
  The events of the past two decades in occupied Palestine and 
its borders with all the Islamic countries, which were marked by 
numerous fluctuations, should drive home to the Arab governments 
that the Zionist regime is not to be satisfied with what it can 
grab with its talons. Naturally, dealing with such a wanton 
government can never be a source of peace and stability for the 
zealous Middle East region. 
  The best and most logical stance has been adopted today by 
those inside occupied Palestine and in south Lebanon who--in 
parallel with the proliferation of their Islamic and cultural 
activities--have pitched themselves against the criminal Israeli 
regime. They are the ones who have kept the flame of the 
intifadah alight for so many years under the worst possible 
conditions.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Human Rights Vessel Ran Aground in </F>
Beijing"] 
  [Text] After three days of talks with the PRC leaders in 
which he tried unsuccessfully to impose the U.S. version of 
human rights, the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
departed Beijing. 
  He failed to bring Washington's and Beijing's viewpoints on 
human rights any closer. Contrary to his expectations, the U.S. 
Secretary of State encountered firm and intransigent stances by 
the PRC authorities in the course of his 10 hours of intensive 
talks with them as they rejected his recommendations outright. 
  What is certain is that Christopher visited the PRC in order 
to deliver a final warning to the PRC leaders and to convince 
them to accept Washington's conditions on human rights issues. 
He said: The issue of human rights and the Most Favored Nation 
[MFN] status were the salient features of the talks between the 
two sides. Christopher went to Beijing in order to exert 
pressure on the basis of its chronic ploy, the MFN treaty which 
the United States uses in its tactics to put pressure on the PRC. 
  Ever since the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989, the United 
States has raised the extension of the MFN trade law and linked 
it to progress in the field of human rights. In fact, it is 
really seeking a way to extend it. The PRC has realized by now 
that the United States stands to gain equally if not more from 
the extension of MFN status. According to Li Peng, the PRC 
prime minister, if the United States were to revoke this clause, 
it would lose as much if not more than the PRC, and U.S. 
companies would not be able to enter or remain in the PRC's 
extensive and capacious market. 
  Accordingly, the PRC authorities, in an unprecedented 
action, 
very clearly and firmly stressed to Christopher that they will 
not be pressured by the United States, particularly by 
Washington's viewpoint on human rights and the MFN. 
  It is a fact that the United States is not really concerned 
about the human rights situation in the PRC and merely intends 
to use this ostensibly humanitarian issue to reap political and 
commercial capital from Beijing. The U.S. mass media, which 
acts as the right arm of the White House hierarchy in whipping 
up a propagandistic atmosphere, had embarked on their campaign a 
few days before Christopher commenced his trip and gave 
extensive coverage to the talks between Assistant Secretary of 
State John Shattuck and some opponents of the PRC regime on the 
issue of human rights, including Wei Jingsheng and various 
similar interviews. This was aimed at provoking the 
sensibilities of the PRC authorities so that they would reveal 
an absence of democracy in the PRC. 
  Following the meetings between the U.S. officials and the 
opponents of the PRC government precisely one week before 
Christopher's visit, the PRC security officials summoned Wei 
Jingsheng and Wang Dan and some other dissidents who had been 
released in the past six months; they were released again after 
24 hours. 
  The news coverage by the U.S. satellite networks and the 
swift reaction of the White House authorities, including 
Clinton, against this move by the PRC Government proved that the 
U.S. had acted solely to put the Beijing hierarchy on the 
defensive, especially with regard to human rights issues prior 
to Christopher's visit. 
  Simultaneously, the United States tried to motivate the UN 
Human Rights Commission [UNHRC] in Geneva to make a fuss over 
the human rights situation in the PRC on the eve of 
Christopher's visit to Beijing, thus trying to internationalize 
the PRC's human rights situation and to put the PRC at a 
disadvantage before it came to the negotiating table with the 
U.S. Secretary of State. Washington's plan to use the UNHRC to 
exert pressure on the PRC also met defeat. 
  On the other hand, hardline PRC Prime Minister Li Peng's 
articulate remarks in parliament only a day before Christopher's 
visit with regard to the human rights situation in the PRC and 
the meaningful statement by the PRC foreign minister rejoicing 
at the West's defeat due to the [UN's] failure to approve the 
plan to debate the human rights situation in the PRC portended 
the fruitlessness of Christopher's visit beforehand. 
  However, at his very first round of talks with Christopher, 
the PRC foreign minister, disregarding political considerations, 
openly expressed his rancor and criticism of the meeting between 
the assistant secretary of state for human rights, John 
Shattuck, with Chinese dissidents. On the same day, two 
American journalists were arrested in Beijing for a few hours on 
charges of illegal activity. 
  The PRC security officials also tightened security around 
the 
U.S. Embassy and the residence of Warren Christopher before his 
arrival and kept the comings and goings at these places under 
strict surveillance. 
  The PRC's actions prior to the visit and during it confused 
the U.S., according to a U.S. spokesman. However, it is certain 
the Chinese authorities intended by these actions to show the 
United States categorically that they would not succumb to any 
kind of pressure from it. 
  Even though Christopher explained that his visit was aimed 
at 
insuring that the PRC comprehended the importance of human 
rights from the U.S. viewpoint and in the context of the MFN, 
the Chinese side stated that it had noted the U.S. stance in 
this regard. However, it is obvious that U.S. 
policies--especially with regard to exerting pressure on the 
pretext of human rights in the PRC--ran aground and Warren 
Christopher returned to the United States with nothing to 
rejoice about. 
  During the course of his visit, Christopher handed to the 
PRC 
officials a list of Chinese political prisoners but he did not 
receive an positive response in this regard. The PRC officials 
stressed that their country has an independent legal system and 
it acts according to its own laws. 
  Of course, it may be mentioned that the PRC does have some 
problems related to its adherence to human rights with regard 
some cases involving ethnic minorities. 
  Regardless of the human rights issue, to which the major 
part 
of Christopher's talks with the PRC officials was devoted, this 
visit provided the two countries with an opportunity to discuss 
topics of mutual interest such as trade and military cooperation 
in arms control, especially of missiles, the DPRK's nuclear 
program and other important regional and international issues. 
  In the course of this visit, the two sides signed a 
memorandum of understanding on importing and exporting products 
made by prisoners, which ensures the implementation of the 
agreements reached in 1992. The PRC and the United States agreed 
to resume their military contacts after a hiatus of five years 
and agreed that a joint committee on the arms industry and for 
transforming military industries into civilian industries will 
be set up and its first session will be held in Beijing this 
year. 
  In any case, Christopher's visit to the PRC and the defeat 
of 
his talks with the Chinese officials, especially with regard to 
human rights--the main U.S. lever in pressuring the PRC for the 
past few years--proved that even after more than a year since 
his entry into the White House, Clinton has not been able to 
formulate acceptable diplomacy toward Beijing and that 
Washington-Beijing relations will encounter unforeseen highs and 
lows in the future.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Mr. Clinton! Who Are the Enemies </F>
of Peace in Palestine?"] 
  [Text] We should not permit the enemies of peace to be 
victorious! This was a remark by U.S. President Clinton at the 
conclusion of his talks with the prime minister of the Israeli 
regime at the White House. 
  Regardless of the fact that, in itself, this remark is quite 
correct and logical and, in practice, one should prevent the 
enemies of peace from becoming victorious in Palestine, one must 
first see who are the "enemies of peace." 
  These enemies of peace are none other than the Zionists and 
their supporters. It has become clear to world public opinion 
today that the debacle of the slaughter of the Muslims in 
al-Khalil [Hebron] did not take place without the direct support 
of the Israeli armed forces. The Israeli press and Western 
supporters have also admitted this fact. 
  The slaughter of fasting Muslim worshipers who were 
prostrate 
in the mosque of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) has ripped 
the mask from the visage of the true enemies of Islam and 
revealed their repulsive faces. Are the enemies of peace anyone 
other than those who for many years have usurped the first 
qiblah [direction in which Muslims say their prayers] of the 
Muslims and kill the Muslim youth residing in those areas every 
day? 
  The U.S. President, who is a champion of human rights, 
ignores all these crimes and shamelessly alleges that PLO 
leaders should not permit incidents such as the al-Khalil 
[Hebron] carnage to hinder progress toward peace and not expect 
greater concessions from Israel for resumption of talks! 
  Is support of a criminal not tantamount to being an 
accomplice? The United States is as much responsible for the 
shedding of the blood of innocent Muslims in Palestine as Israel 
is, as it not only prevents their condemnation at international 
forums but encourages this terrorist regime by various kinds of 
economic and political assistance. 
  After many years of psychological war and adverse propaganda 
against those they describe as "enemies of peace," the United 
States and Israel should note that such opinions will not in any 
way affect the determination of the Palestinian Muslims all over 
Palestine for the liberation of dear Jerusalem. 
  Clinton should realize that the era of such efforts to 
deceive the people has ended. How is it possible that the 
greatest criminals in history and their supporters speak of 
peace and consider themselves peace-seekers? The day is not too 
far away when the true enemies of peace, security, and freedom 
will face a disgraceful defeat.

  [Excerpt] Pending the signing of the one-year stand-by 
agreement with the IMF, the financial and monetary authorities 
have announced that the value of the national currency, the 
dinar, will be devalued as from today by 40.17 percent. 
Accordingly, $1 will be equivalent to 36 dinars, compared to 25 
dinars in the past. 
  The loan and monetary council has also announced a tangible 
increase in interests on loans. These corrective measures come 
to confront the current economic stagnation and to ensure 
boosting the economic mechanism in the future. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Mourad Benachnou by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] As I had announced earlier, our 
guest tonight is Economy Minister Mourad Benachnou. Welcome 
minister. The first question I will put to you is the following: 
today the Bank of Algeria announced a 40.17 percent devaluation 
of the dinar as from 10 April. First, what will be the economic 
impact of this devaluation? Second, will this devaluation take 
place in one go or will it be introduced gradually? 
  [Benachnou] First, in the name of God, the Merciful, the 
Compassionate; as you know, the value of a currency depends on 
the law of supply and demand. What is happening in Algeria is 
that revenues in hard currency dropped for several reasons, the 
first one being a decline in oil prices. This required an 
adjustment in the value of the dinar in relation to the hard 
currencies, which are in huge demand but are not in sufficient 
supply. 
  As for the repercussions of the devaluation of the dinar, I 
will say that these will be both positive and negative. First, 
the positive repercussions will include an increase in tax 
revenues for the state as a result of higher oil revenues when 
the latter are converted into dinars. Second, this will enable 
us to give a greater freedom to imports. Third, this 
devaluation will in the near future, God willing, encourage 
exports other than oil. 
  As regards the negative repercussions, the first one will be 
on prices. However, I must point out that the parallel market 
[black market] was ahead of the state as far as the exchange 
rate of the dinar is concerned. You know that in the parallel 
market the dinar is lower than the official rate. 
  [Correspondent] As we have just heard, the International 
Monetary Fund has expressed its full satisfaction. Does this 
mean that the agreement with the IMF has been signed, and if it 
the case, what are the contents of that agreement? 
  [Benachnou] We signed a letter of intent this evening after 
the government discussed and approved the contents of the 
letter. On the whole, the letter of intent sets out the 
economic, financial, and monetary policy the Algerian Government 
intends to follow until the country returns to the path of 
development and to a stability in prices and until it checks 
inflation and boosts investments again so that enough new jobs 
can be created to keep up with the number of youths entering the 
job market every year. 
  The contents of this letter are all built around these 
objectives. By way of illustration, I will now give some of the 
points this letter addresses. The first point is the rate of 
the dinar. We have already talked about this. The second point 
is linked to the lifting of all restrictions on imports to allow 
our economy to be financed effectively and in a way that 
reflects the real requirements of the economy and not decisions 
taken by civil servants sitting in their offices who do not know 
how the economy or companies are run by operators who are 
directly responsible for production. 
  There is also a measure concerning the budget because 
several 
deficiencies we notice in our economy are the result of a lack 
of restraint on the part of the state in terms of expenditure. 
At times this expenditure exceeded the revenues, and 
consequently the state had to borrow money from the Central 
Bank. This in turn led to the inflation Algeria is now 
experiencing. 
  As regards the policy of managing public funds, I can say 
that we will achieve a greater restraint and that this restraint 
will enable us to curb the price rises we are currently facing. 
  This letter addressed another problem, namely the 
restructuring of state-owned companies. We are aware of the 
huge delay in tackling this problem. In any case, the 
state-owned companies contribute to the national income with 60 
percent, but this contribution is well below their capacity. 
These companies have a higher capacity of production, and we 
must give them the means to maximize it in the best way possible 
and with the necessary standard. 
  There are other measures that are purely technical, and this 
may not be the best place to talk about them. However, I must 
stress that this letter will enable us to receive first of all 
$1 billion from the IMF, as its director general announced. We 
will also receive some loans that had been suspended and that 
had been linked to this letter. These loans are coming to us 
from the World Bank, $175 million; Japan, $150 million; the 
European Union, $180 million; and finally the Arab Monetary 
Fund, $100 million. 
  This will be the first tranche. For the second tranche, we 
have started talks with a number of states such as France, 
Spain, Italy, and Belgium and with other institutions to enable 
us to finance our balance of payments to meet the imports 
requirements and the requirements linked to the servicing of our 
foreign debt. 
  As regards the foreign debt, its problem is also linked to 
the signing of this letter of intent. As the IMF director 
general said, and I can only repeat what he said, we will be 
able to enter talks with our creditors when we achieve a 
significant reduction in the servicing of our foreign debt, and 
I mean a very big reduction. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you minister. I hope we will meet 
again for more information on other economic matters. Thank you 
again.

  [Excerpts] A ministerial council was held this morning at 
the Presidency and was chaired by Liamine Zeroual, head of 
state. The meeting was attended by a number of ministers. 
  Following the meeting, the government's official spokesman 
held a news conference in which he explained the issues on the 
agenda of today's meeting. Here now follows the details of this 
news conference: 
  [Begin unidentified official spokesman recording] In the 
name 
of God, the compassionate, and the merciful. The Council of 
Ministers held a meeting today under the chairmanship of Mr. 
Liamine Zeroual, head of state. [passage omitted] 
  On the national economy level, the head of state submitted a 
report on the content of the letter of intent to the IMF that 
the council adopted. It will be sent to the IMF director 
general today. To this effect, the national economy minister 
submitted a report on the situation of the national economy, 
especially the issue of the management of foreign debts. 
Following this report, it became clear that the method that has 
been adopted to manage the foreign debt up until now was not 
suitable, because it did not help the country break the vicious 
circle that our national development was suffering from despite 
all the debt repayments operations undertaken by us in an 
organized way. 
  In addition to this, the current reduction of oil prices and 
the international oil markets situation forced us into a 
situation that gave the impression that we did not repay our 
debts; this is because the income from our exports during the 
year 1994 will not exceed more than $8 billion, whereas the debt 
repayments will reach $9.3 billion. 
  In conclusion, the possibility of our country securing new 
loans from the international market has become difficult because 
our traditional creditors insist on linking link their financial 
cooperation with us with the conclusion of an agreement between 
our country and the IMF. We have been working for the 
preparation of such an agreement with the IMF. Additionally, we 
have begun preparing for negotiations that we will have with 
Paris Club. In these negotiations we have adopted two 
fundamental principles: To protect, as far as possible, the 
scope of movement regarding the economic policy of our country; 
to work, in particular, toward the preservation of the maximum 
abilities to manage the social repercussions caused by the 
reforms of the structural program, and make it acceptable to our 
workers. To this end, the Council of Ministers adopted a number 
of projects during today's meeting. 
  During his interventions at the council's meeting, the head 
of state stressed the following directives: 
  To work toward the consolidation of the Maghreban march, 
which for Algeria represents a strategic choice. To implement 
the resolutions of the Algerian-Tunisian summit and to promote 
and bolster relations between the two countries. At the 
economic level, he stressed the need to use seriousness and 
determination to manage and implement the program of 
restructuring and bolstering the national economy. 
  To work for a fair distribution of the burden caused by the 
economic restructuring operation among all social strata. The 
head of state also underlined the priority enjoyed by the 
following sectors: The hydrocarbons sector which should not 
suffer from any delay regarding investment and prospecting 
operations; the housing sector that represents a pressing social 
priority and warrants fundamental reforms and great attention. 
The farming sector: To better use fertile land, and to embark 
on reforming new land. The sector of small and medium 
enterprises: As it represent the main source for investments and 
the creation of new jobs opportunities. 
  In the field of external trade and distribution, the head of 
state stressed the need to cleanse this sector and to find an 
immediate solution to the phenomenon of the shortage of basic 
commodities in the markets, and to put a decisive end to the 
smuggling operations via our borders that harm the resources of 
the national economy. 
  In parallel with this program, and in order to achieve its 
results, the head of state stressed the need to continue and 
boost the structural reforms of the national economy and to work 
for the liberation of all national initiatives. I thank you.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, April 10 (AFP)--An outlawed 
fundamentalist group said Sunday it had killed a police general, 
who had been at the forefront of the battle against Islamic 
militants, in revenge for human rights abuses in Egyptian 
prisons. 
  Security forces launched a manhunt on Sunday after General 
Ra'uf Khayrat was killed by assailants who hurled a bomb at his 
car in the Egyptian capital. 
  Three people in a car and two on a motorbike raked General 
Khayrat's car with automatic gunfire late Saturday and then 
lobbed the bomb before escaping, witnesses said. 
  The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group] said in a 
statement to AFP it had carried out the attack "to avenge the 
most atrocious violations of human rights which Islamic 
prisoners are subjected to in Egyptian prisons." 
  Khayrat was the number two in the state security services, 
which have been accused by human rights groups of torturing 
suspected militants. 
  His charred body was found in the burnt-out car after the 
attack in the suburb of al-Jizah on Pyramids Avenue, which 
happened as the general was leaving home at the wheel of his 
car, the witnesses said. 
  The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah warned on March 27 that it would 
avenge what it called the "serious violations of human rights in 
Egyptian prisons," where the state security services interrogate 
thousands of suspects. 
  It said it had tracked the general down even though he had 
changed address several times, and used three different cars in 
a bid to outwit possible assailants. [passage omitted] 
  Khayrat was one of the leading officials in charge of the 
fight against militants who launched a terror campaign against 
the government in the spring of 1992. 
  It was the first killing of a police general in Cairo, 
though 
four other police generals have been killed in southern Egypt, a 
hotbed of Muslim fundamentalism. 
  Police launched a massive manhunt in al-Jizah, with officers 
out on patrol and soldiers armed with automatic weapons posted 
on all the main roads and bridges of the capital. 
  The motorbike and car used in the attack were found near the 
general's home. 
  It was the worst attack in Cairo since a failed November 25 
assassination bid against Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi. The 
authorities had since kept Islamic violence mostly confined to 
the south of the country. 
  The Egyptian Human Rights Organisation has accused Khayrat's 
services of systematically torturing suspects in Islamic 
militant attacks. 
  More than 360 people have been killed, including 132 
policemen, since the militants declared war on the secular 
government of President Husni Mubarak in March 1992.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- first 
three paragraphs are AL-MUHARRIR introduction] 
  [Text] Sudanese Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih has 
stressed that he presented to the Arab League Council a detailed 
memorandum on the plot concocted by some western countries aimed 
at dividing Sudan and separating parts of it. He said that 
Sudan is confronting these schemes with firmness and that it 
possesses the power to abort them. 
  Asked by AL-MUHARRIR on the latest developments in the issue 
of Hala'ib between Egypt and Sudan, Abu-Salih said he has met 
with his Egyptian counterpart 'Amr Musa and agreed on continuing 
the dialogue regarding this problem as well as on overcoming the 
obstacles in bilateral relations. He added: We are working 
together to establish distinguished Egyptian-Sudanese relations 
because they are strategic relations. These special relations, 
he added, should be an example and the cornerstone for strong 
Arab relations. 
  The Sudanese foreign minister noted that the two countries 
reached agreement to resume the meetings of the Hala'ib 
committee. He said that Presidents Mubarak and al-Bashir charged 
him and 'Amr Musa with discussing all aspects of bilateral 
relations, reviewing the various problems, and defining ways to 
tackle them. He said that Khartoum will receive the Egyptian 
foreign minister soon to discuss the unresolved problems. 
  [AL-MUHARRIR] Have you noticed any positive response from 
Cairo to overcome these differences? 
  [Abu-Salih] We refused to announce the contents of these 
differences through the media and agreed to discuss them quietly 
at the negotiating table and during the joint bilateral 
meetings. We found a positive response, seriousness, and a 
desire to tackle all these issues. This will be achieved 
through expediting some meetings and holding talks under the 
chairmanship of both ministers. 
  [AL-MUHARRIR] Are you optimistic over the normalization of 
bilateral relations? 
  [Abu-Salih] Yes. We have been optimistic for a long time. 
Bilateral relations only need reinforcement of confidence and 
rebuilding of bridges. 
  [AL-MUHARRIR] What is your assessment of the current 
Sudanese- Arab relations? 
  [Abu-Salih] I would like to stress that Sudan's main concern 
is to develop and strengthen relations with the Arab brothers. 
This is a firm strategy from which we will not deviate. 
Proceeding from this, we support all initiatives aimed at 
achieving strong and stable relations among the Arab countries. 
We also work toward bypassing the current state of 
fragmentation. 
  [AL-MUHARRIR] Once again, who is behind the plot aimed at 
encroaching on the unity of Sudan, particularly in the South? 
  [Abu-Salih] As I said, some western countries are playing 
the 
Southern card in an attempt to divide Sudan. Our people, 
however, supported by our Arab brothers, will foil these schemes 
which are not only aimed against Sudan but against pan-Arab 
security. This constitutes a threat to the entire nation. We 
reject any encroachment on our sovereignty or territorial 
integrity no matter what the price. 
  [AL-MUHARRIR] What are these foreign quarters exactly? 
  [Abu-Salih] America and Britain are not far from what is 
happening. Many symposiums are being held in these two 
countries whose main concern is the situation in southern Sudan. 
They claim that the people there must be granted the right to 
self- determination. We absolutely reject this because in the 
South there are armed rebels who represent only the minority. 
Our task is to hold dialogue with them although they do not 
represent the South.

<F P=106> [By AL-JUMHURIYAH correspondent in Khartoum] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sudanese Culture and Information Minister 
'Abd-al- Basit Sabdarat has said Sudan will never change its 
principled position toward Iraq because Iraq's cause is fair. 
In a statement to the AL-JUMHURIYAH correspondent in Khartoum, 
the Sudanese minister said the economic sanctions on the lofty 
Iraq are eroding, thanks to the great and historic leadership of 
President Saddam Husayn. He said the recent Security Council 
resolution is neither fair nor legal, adding that it is enough 
to say that France, Russia, China, and some other states did not 
approve of the final statement. 
  Sabdarat praised the steadfastness of the Iraqi people in 
the 
face of aggression and blockade, stressing that there is an 
unusual chemistry in the structure of the Iraqi people, whose 
achievements under the siege are greater than under normal 
circumstances. I do not believe any other people under the same 
pressure and siege could have achieved what the Iraqis have 
achieved. The Sudanese information minister said the most 
important achievement of the Iraqi leadership was that it 
prevented any fragmentation of the country, as was planned, and 
that the national structure and unity of Iraq was maintained. 
He added that the most important achievement of the people of 
Iraq is their rallying around the historic leadership of 
President Saddam Husayn. 
  The Sudanese minister said the blockade will collapse now 
that the Iraqis have quickly adapted themselves to the imposed 
conditions and developments and become a great giant through 
their great and historic achievements. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Address by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to the Chamber </F>
of Deputies in Tunis following his taking the constitutional 
oath on his reelection as president of the republic -- live] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate and the 
merciful. Mr. Speaker; deputies; the holding of the first 
session of your respected house, which coincides with the 9 
April anniversary, has more than one significance. [passage 
omitted] 
  As a gesture of a pledge to those pure martyrs, those brave 
people, those militants and those who fought for the goals of 
the country; and as the best greetings and honor that one can 
give them, we should all be at the level of national 
responsibility, and at the level of the trust that the people 
placed in us by electing us. We should place the people's 
interests above all other considerations, and we should work 
continuously to realise their ambitions and aspirations within 
the framework of justice, dignity, solidarity and stability, 
within the principles and the visions laid down in the 7 
November Declaration, which we have been implementing gradually, 
a policy that has resulted in a number of achievements and gains 
for our people. [passage omitted] 
  Your duties, which you will carry out in this chamber, will 
enable you to closely view all things concerned with the 
political, economic and social course of this country. 
  Your participation in the regional assemblies will enable 
you 
to be absolutely informed about the realities of your areas and 
the expectations of the people. In both cases, it will help you 
to follow up the government's activities in all fields and to 
enrich the contents of plans and proposed budgets with your 
contributions and clarifications. [passage omitted] 
  Ladies and gentlemen, because of the differences in your 
party affiliations, the multiparty system -- for the first time 
-- has materialized in the Chamber of Deputies. It was a 
fundamental choice made available by the policies we followed 
since the move for change to establish democracy and pluralism. 
We stressed in the 7 November declaration that our people are 
worthy of a developed political life, truely based on 
multiparties and popular organizations. 
  From this context, we developed laws and institutions in 
line 
with the society's development. Your election took place in the 
shadow of democracy, transparency, civilized behavior and under 
the administration's total neutrality. And so, pluralism has 
found its way into this chamber. [passage omitted] 
  In the new stage we will work on consolidating the 
foundations of a civil society, entrenching democracy, 
strengthening human rights by disseminating its values and 
spreading it, assuring legal guarantees for everyone so that 
they may practise their freedoms in the widest scope given to 
them by law, respond to the requisites of justice, and ensure 
balance and cohesiveness of society. 
  Today, after the people have had their say and have chosen 
their representatives, the influence of every person in the 
political sphere has become apparent to all. There is no scope, 
outside these institutions and organizations, for anyone to 
speak in the name of the people except those who have the right 
to represent them or sectors of society. They, alone, are the 
ones qualified to do this. 
  The state of law, whose foundations we established and 
strengthened, does not solely mean the state's respect for the 
law, but also means respect for it by everyone -- individuals, 
groups, organizations, institutions. We will also stand firm in 
the face of any outlaw employing any slogan. We will also not 
allow anyone who finds excuses in the name of freedom and human 
rights to cause damage to the homeland, distort its reputation 
or harm its relations with brothers and friends. 
  Each citizen has the right to defend his freedom and rights, 
and we will be the first to listen to him, to remove the 
grievances which could be imposed on him, and to enable him to 
obtain his rights in full and preserve his dignity, because we 
consider guaranteeing rights and protecting values to be a duty 
and a responsibility. 
  Our country is organized; it has its own institutions and 
bodies which have the capacity to guarantee all freedoms and 
rights, be it political, civil or humanitarian. 
  It is the responsibility of each quarter, body or 
individual, 
including human rights societies, to work toward respecting the 
law, implement it in all cases and to protect the rights of the 
group and its interests, and not to demand the suspension of the 
laws and search for reasons for infringements, or restrict 
oneself for defending whoever makes vocational errors and 
deliberately breaks the law for a selfish interest or personal 
purpose which he would make an issue for the people and the 
country. 
  Among the practices which simply indicate a feeling of 
inferiority and self-hate, is the initiative of some who issue 
statements directly to the foreign media as though they are 
seeking support against their country or appeal for assistance 
against it. 
  Honorable deputies, ladies and gentlemen. International 
institutions and agencies have praised our success and have 
renewed their readiness to cooperate with us. We have managed 
to clinch the confidence of private monetary institutions, which 
forge no deals except on the basis of the productivity and 
effectiveness of a partner. They have no other considerations. 
These monetary bodies would not do this if they had not found 
credibility and guarantees, seriousness and stability in our 
country, which encouraged them to make such deals. 
  All objective foreign media, for its part, also did not 
hesitate to praise our country's achievements in all fields, 
accomplished day after day. When it does this it balances 
between the positive and negative aspects. We welcome it and 
follow what it writes with interest. 
  We do not care what some foreign media has persisted in 
pursuing in an attempt to harm Tunisia's honor and undermine its 
sovereignty by publishing biased reports containing insults and 
slanders. It has opened its pages to some people who claim they 
belong to the world of journalism, or to some journalists whose 
nostalgia for the colonialist period has not abated and whose 
feelings of animosity and domination have not dwindled. 
  Such newspapers have no place in Tunisia, and doing away 
with 
them is very easy because of the spread of objective newspapers 
and other means of communication. The same is true of some 
nongovernmental organizations which have also not ceased 
claiming that they are mandated -- in the name of human rights 
or freedom of the press -- to discuss our laws, investigate how 
far we have implemented them. Others want to carry out 
referendums and opinion polls, and to publish only what pleases 
them, which is restricted in mentioning the shortcomings, or 
making up these shortcomings if they cannot find any. 
  Our country is not a laboratory or a test field, and is not 
in the custody of anyone. [applause] 
  Some countries deliberately shelter some Tunisian terrorists 
and do not hesitate to enable them to obtain asylum despite the 
decisive evidence and the firm rulings which we presented to 
those countries against those people. Some of these countries 
open their official media channels for thee terrorists and 
present them as victims of human rights and wasted freedoms. 
Those responsible for these actions would only be convinced by 
either of two ways: Either we embark on preplanned courses and 
enter ready made models in which they want to squeeze us and 
become like excellent pupils, with all the belittling aspects 
implied in this formula, or we admit to them that we are 
underdeveloped and our laws are confined and become subject 
matter for their pens and clubs. 
  Every successful person is envied. Were it not that our 
country was distinct, nobody would pay attention to it. Some 
quarters are offended by our success and envy us for it. They 
do not understand how we can carry out the necessary reforms, 
achieve distinguished gains and live in security and stability, 
and how we can succeed and be safe in matters where others have 
not succeeded and become safe despite the differences in the 
conditions and capabilities. 
  What essentially concerns us is our people's trust and their 
rallying around their system, their choices, and our trust in 
ourselves. We derive all this from the purity of our intention, 
the sincerity of our determination, the soundness of the accord 
program we are following, the importance of the gains we are 
achieving and from the prospects which unite between reality and 
the aspirations which we open before our country and people. 
[passage omitted: recalls election campaign and says current 
parliament will work toward achieving the pledges made]

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry issued today a statement in 
which it said Tunisia is following with great concern the grave 
development in the situation in Bosnia due to the savage and 
escalating acts aiming at the unarmed civilian children of this 
country. 
  Tunisia, which had always stood by the causes of right, 
liberation, and justice, strongly condemns the policy of ethnic 
cleansing that blatantly contradict not only the right of the 
peoples to self-determination but also the most basic of human 
values and the most sacred of human rights -- namely the right 
to life. 
  Tunisia, which had blessed the accord concluded in 
Washington 
between the Croats and the Bosnian Muslims, demands an immediate 
end to this campaign and addresses an urgent appeal to the 
international community, particularly to the Security Council, 
to carry out a speedy and decisive action to halt this 
aggression against the innocents and to provide the 
circumstances that ensure security and peace in the region.

  [Text] Military Court investigators in Lebanon have 
interrogated Lebanese Army Sergeant Sharfan Bulus and two former 
members of the disbanded Lebanese Forces accused of plotting to 
kill President Ilyas al-Hirawi. 
  Lebanese judiciary sources say that the Military Court will 
try Ghassan Tuma, head of the Lebanese Forces' security 
apparatus, in absentia. Tuma asked Sergeant Bulus, a bomb 
expert working at the Presidential Palace, about the possibility 
of planting a bomb, the target of which would be the president, 
in a flower vase, a car, or a telephone set, according to the 
same sources.

  [Text] The outskirts of the towns of Kafra and Yatar have 
been coming under shelling since 1530 today from the occupation 
center in Jabal Humayyid. A center belonging to the Nepalese 
contingent in Yatar was hit by machine-gun fire coming from the 
Lahd agents' post in the occupied strip opposite the town. The 
Martyr Husayn Nasir Mahdi group of the Islamic Resistance laid 
an ambush for a Lahdist security convoy on the Bayt Lif road. 
The strugglers showered the convoy's cars with a hail of fire 
from machine guns and artillery. Several artillery shells hit 
the car transporting the security officials. It was burnt out 
immediately and its occupants were either killed or injured.

  [Text] Tyre, April 6 (AFP)--Nine people were wounded, most 
of them civilians, in rocket and artillery attacks on Israel's 
"security zone" in south Lebanon on Wednesday [6 April], 
security officials and an Israeli-backed militia said. 
  The radio of the South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia [Kafr 
Killa 
Voice of the South] said rockets crashed onto the villages of 
Dibil and 'Ayn Ibil, on the border with Israel, wounding seven 
civilians and setting fire to several houses. 
  Earlier, artillery battles between a radical Palestinian 
faction and the Israeli army left a militiaman and an 
anti-Israeli fighter wounded, security officials said. 
  The militiaman was wounded when fighters of the Popular 
Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine fired at an SLA position in Bayt 
Lif, in the western sector of the security zone, they said. 
  The post was attacked by two Sagar shells, six anti-tank 
rockets and automatic weapons fire. 
  The Israeli army retaliated, firing back 20 mortar shells 
and 
10 anti-tank shells, wounding one of the attackers who was 
evacuated from the area, they added. 
  Three hours later six Katyusha rockets hit an SLA position 
in 
Marwahin, 300 metres (330 yards) from the border between Israel 
and Lebanon, sources in the occupied border strip said. 
  The Israeli army retaliated by raining 30 mortar and tank 
shells on five villages just outside the zone known to be 
strongholds of Iranian-backed Hizballah fighters, police said. 
  There were no further reports of civilian casualties.

  [Text] Sidon, Lebanon, April 8 (AFP)--Two radical 
Palestinian factions said they attacked a militia patrol in 
south Lebanon Friday. 
  The Popular and Democratic Fronts for the Liberation of 
Palestine said in a joint statement that they fired on a patrol 
of Israel's proxy South Lebanon Army (SLA) in the west of 
Israel's self-declared security zone. 
  The statement said the factions blew up an armored vehicle, 
killing or wounding its crew. 
  Voice of the South radio said a civilian vehicle had been 
attacked close to Shqif al-Naml without causing any victims. 
  Security services confirmed an SLA patrol had come under 
fire 
but could not give details of any casualties. 
  The two factions are opposed to the Middle East peace 
process 
and the Israel-Palestine Liberation Organisation autonomy accord 
signed in Washington in September.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Policies That Defy Reason"] </F>
  [Text) Hardly a day passes by in the occupied Arab 
territories without many Palestinians falling victim to Israeli 
atrocities and violations of human rights. The killing of 
Palestinians by Israeli soldiers or settlers is a daily reality 
that has become of routine news value to the international 
media, and even less significance to the international community. 
  Only a crime of the enormity of the Hebron massacre draws 
the 
attention of the big powers in the world to the suffering of the 
Palestinian people and Israel's disregard for all international 
norms and human values. This attention fades, though, sooner 
than the blood of Palestinians dries on the ground. 
  Such is not the case with violence against Israelis. The 
killing of any number of Israelis by frustrated Palestinians has 
all world capitals racing to condemn "Arab acts of terrorism" 
and offer support for Israel. 
  The world is serving neither the Palestinians nor the 
Israelis through such exercises in hypocrisy. Nor is Israel 
protecting its future and that of the region by failing to 
address the root causes of violence in the occupied territories. 
  Israel is responsible for the 'Afula bombing as much as it 
is 
responsible for the Hebron massacre. Its policies in the 
occupied territories provided the settlers with the means for 
killing the Palestinians as they prayed in the Ibrahimi Mosque. 
Those same policies left the young Palestinian who carried out 
the 'Afula suicide attack no choice but to give Israelis a taste 
of what their government has been allowing to happen to 
Palestinians for decades. 
  Israeli politicians condemned the Hebron massacre. So should 
Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat condemn the 'Afula bombing 
demands the U.S. and other world powers. The naivety and 
insensitivity of comparing the two unfortunate events are 
appalling, even though the killing of innocent people and 
civilians cannot be condoned by anybody or quarter. 
  Had the international community been genuinely interested in 
ending the bloodshed in the occupied territories, however, it 
would have had taken action to end it long before the 'Afula 
bombing took place. That it could have done by putting enough 
pressure on Israel to remove the injustices to which 
Palestinians are subjected on a daily basis. Instead of 
removing the settlers, admittedly a main obstacle to the 
attainment of peace in the region, Israel threw a blanket curfew 
on the West Bank and Gaza. That deprived Palestinians from even 
providing for their daily needs. The suffering increased and 
retaliatory action became an inevitable response. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman thus 
found himself unable to condemn the 'Afula attack personally. 
By doing so, he might have only infuriated his people whose 
members are being killed by Israelis by the hour. Israel, on 
the other hand, could affoprd to condemn the Hebron massacre 
because it has within its reach tens of other measures to 
appease its citizens. 
  The most the PLO can do in reaction to Israeli atrocities is 
boycott the peace talks, and that it cannot do for long because 
of the pressures that Washington and other world powers would 
put on it. 
  But Israel does not boycott the talks, winning world praise 
for not allowing "rejectionists" to abort the peace process. 
What it does, instead, is put two million Palestinians under 
siege again by closing the West Bank and Gaza totally. The 
negative implications of this act for the peace process far 
exceed those of withdrawing from the negotiation. Yet a few in 
the world community seem to notice; and Israel gets away with 
murder. 
  Thus only Palestinian desperation grows, and the cycle of 
violence continues unabated. When inclination towards peace 
becomes the ultimate causalty we can all be sure that the peace 
process stands to suffer. Just when the Israelis get to realise 
the folly of their policies is the question that we cannot 
answer.

<F P=106> [By Anosh Ahamath] </F>
  [Text] COLOMBO, April 9 (AFP) -- Security was tightened in 
the Sri Lankan capital Saturday after suspected Tamil guerillas 
carried out a bombing campaign aimed at disrupting Sri Lanka's 
booming tourism industry, officials said. 
  Two people died and three were wounded in overnight 
explosions near the Mount Lavinia beach resort, at the deluxe 
Colombo Marriott, Taj Samudra and the three-star Sapphire Hotel, 
officials said. 
  Another bomb went off Saturday morning at the Zoological 
Gardens. Despite the large number of visitors, there were no 
casualties because the blast occurred in an isolated marshy area. 
  No foreigners were wounded in the blasts, police said. 
  K. H. J. Wijayadasa, secretary to President Dingiri Banda 
Wijetunga, said the government believed the attacks were carried 
out by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which is 
fighting for a separate state in the northeast. 
  "From first indications, from the pattern of explosions, it 
looks as if it is a LTTE job," Wijayadasa told reporters shortly 
after inspecting a badly damaged toilet at the Marriott. 
  The bombs went off simultaneously at Marriott, Taj, 
frequented by western tourists, and the Sapphire, which is 
"usually patronised" by minority Tamils from the LTTE stronghold 
of northern Jaffna. 
  Wijayadasa said that two suspected LTTE rebels died when a 
bomb they were carrying exploded prematurely. Another accomplice 
was seriously wounded in the blast, he said. A Tamil couple, 
guests at Sapphire, were also injured. 
  Wijayadasa said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe 
presided over a high-level security meeting at which it was 
decided to tighten security at all hotels in and around Colombo. 
  He said the explosions were aimed at driving out tourists 
from the Indian Ocean island nation. 
  "Obviously, this is aimed at disrupting tourism and causing 
a 
certain element of panic. But I think we have escaped fairly 
unscathed," Wijayadasa said. 
  Francis Keenan, the resident general manager of Marriott, 
which is part of the American Marriott chain, said that there 
had been no panic because the blast occurred inside a toilet 
outside the dining hall. 
  "The guests hardly knew what had happened. They have taken 
it 
in the correct spirit," said Keenan. 
  State Minister for Tourism Gamini Lokuge said he hoped the 
tourism industry would not be affected as a result of the latest 
blasts but said that the authorities have taken "very tight 
security measures" to prevent any harm to foreigners. 
  "I don't think the industry will be affected. To my 
knowledge 
no guest has decided to leave," Lokuge said. 
  Lokuge said the industry anticipated a record 450,000 
tourists to visit the island this year. About 120,000 tourists 
have already arrived in the first three months of the year, he 
said. 
  However, nervous hoteliers and travel agents said they were 
adopting a wait-and-see attitude for the moment. 
  "This is the kind of thing that frightens most tourists. 
They 
are all sensitive to such incidents, especially the Japanese," a 
senior travel agent official said. 
  Sri Lanka's tourism industry took a heavy battering between 
1983 and 1989, when Tamil guerrilla bomb attacks and a separate 
anti- government campaign by extremist Sinhalese forced tourists 
to keep away from the island. 
  But the trade began recovering fast after the military 
crushed the Sinhalese insurgency in 1989.

  [Excerpt] Kuwait, 10 Apr -- Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, first 
deputy prime minister and foreign minister, said today that the 
aim of the ministers' decision to tender their resignations to 
His Highness Shaykh Sa'd al-'Abdallah Al-Salim al-Sabah, heir 
apparent and prime minister, was to give him the opportunity to 
re-form the government as he sees fit. 
  Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad pointed out in an exclusive statement 
to KUNA that this step followed the address the heir apparent 
and prime minister delivered to the Kuwaiti people on Monday 
last. 
  He added that the ministers decided "to give Shaykh Sa'd the 
opportunity to choose whomever he wants to cooperate with, and 
this is his right." [passage omitted] 
  With reference to the National Assembly's call yesterday to 
maintain the presence of six deputies in the forthcoming 
ministerial formation, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said "this is an 
issue for the prime minister." 
  Concerning his assessment of the experience of having six 
National Assembly members participating in the present 
government, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said it was "not an experience 
inasmuch as the Constitution stipulates the presence of at least 
one member from the National Assembly in the ministerial 
formation." 
  He went on to say: "Therefore, the inclusion of the National 
Assembly was a necessity, as otherwise there would be no 
government from the constitutional point of view." [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> ["Special to the ARAB TIMES" by Mahmud 'Abd-al-Qadir and </F>
Sa'ud al-Farhan on news conference by Defense Minister Shaykh 
'Ali al-Sabah in Kuwait on 30 March] 
  [Text] Kuwait City, April 1: Thousands of Iraqi troops 
stationed in the south to crush Marsh Arabs could any moment 
start moving towards Kuwait, Minister of Defense Shaykh 'Ali 
al-Sabah said. The situation, however, is not similar to the 
morning of August 2, 1990, he added. 
  "Iraqi troops in the south (of Iraq) are posing a continuous 
threat to Kuwait. These troops could begin moving any moment 
and we are closely watching its movements and are completely 
ready to repulse any attack on Kuwait. These troops are capable 
of doing something but we are very alert," Shaykh 'Ali told a 
press conference. 
  The meeting took place Wednesday, was delayed for half an 
hour as the Minister was meeting with ambassadors of U.S. UK. 
and France who came to congratulate him for the Assembly's 
approval of the defense budget and discuss other issues. 
  The Minister accused Iraq of attempting to violate the 
Kuwaiti borders. "Firing across the borders against our troops 
was still taking place," affirmed the minister. He declared 
that Kuwait has completed digging the security trench on the 
borders with Iraq. leaving "four gates" as demanded by the 
United Nations. 
  He launched a scathing attack on those who have been 
criticising and opposing Kuwait's arms procurement. "Those have 
been acting out of their self interests," asserted the Minister 
who repeatedly came under fire in the National Assembly for 
allegedly squandering public funds to buy hundreds of millions 
worth of unnecessary arms. MPs alleged wide-ranging misuse of 
funds and kickbacks. A parliamentary committee is looking into 
such allegations. 
  Shaykh 'Ali said he could have easily gotten the KD3.5 
billion [Kuwait dinars] defense budget through, had he approved 
"some personal favours for a number of MPs. 
  The Minister said that the latest Iraqi military moves in 
the 
south are not directed against Kuwait but could be any time. 
"Although these moves are not directed against Kuwait, it does 
not mean Kuwait is safe of Iraqi regime's plots, Iraq is still 
keeping relatively large forces. So, I may tell you now it's 
safe and there is nothing, and Iraqi troops start moving towards 
us the next morning", he said. [sentence as published] 
  "Iraqi troops stationed in the south are capable of doing 
something and the extent of this "thing" can be determined only 
after those troops start moving". 
  The Kuwaiti Defense Minister said Iraqi troops have been in 
the south for over a year now. "They are large troops and it's 
natural that we, and our allies, have been closely monitoring 
them round the clock," he said and added. "So far we have not 
seen a direct threat but the presence of such large number of 
troops and machinery is posing a certain threat to Kuwait". 
  Shaykh 'Ali said Iraqi troops have not made any aggressive 
moves so far as its movements have been confined to south of 
Iraq. He added that defense pacts Kuwait signed with four big 
powers include clauses on how to "organise and regulate 
repulsing an external attack on Kuwait." Under those 
agreements, Kuwaiti armed forces carried out about 100 military 
excercises with the Coalition countries and Russia. "These 
exercises have been intended at applying defensive plans" on how 
to defend the country. 
  He stressed that the position at present is not similar to 
what it was on August 2, 1990, when Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait. 
"But the presence of regular Iraqi army in the south for 
training and crushing the uprising in southern Iraq, is a threat 
to the country. These troops could receive orders to move 
further south, towards Kuwait," he said. "The way Iraqi troops 
are scattered now does not pose an immediate threat on Kuwait 
but this assumption could change. This could be true for now, 
but it could reverse 180 degrees just one hour after this 
meeting. The decision is surely with Saddam Husayn," asserted 
the minister. 
  About the credibility of reports saying that Kuwait and the 
coalition countries have made a deal to carry out a military 
operation to rescue Kuwaiti POWs in Iraq, the minister said no 
deal has been signed with him personally. But he affirmed that 
all government bodies have been working very hard to achieve 
this target. "The Kuwaiti National Committeee for POWs has made 
a very important progress to put international pressure on Iraq 
to release the POWs. But whether or not Iraq would respond, the 
answer is surely with Saddam Husayn," he insisted. 
  He praised the decision taken by the UN Security Council 
members to continue sanctions against Iraqi regime. He said 
this shows these countries are convinced not to ease or lift 
sanctions against Iraqi regime. He said this shows these 
countries are convinced not to ease or lift sanction unless Iraq 
complied with all UN resolutions, especially those relating to 
border demarcation, respect of human rights and release of POWs 
and missing. "Until now, things look promising and satisfactory 
for us." 
  Shaykh 'Ali asserted that Kuwaiti post-liberation arms 
procurement has been based on scientific foundations and 
thorough evaluation and study. "Most of the defense ministry 
critics are inexperienced and their criticism lacked substance 
and facts", he said. Critics, mostly from the National 
Assembly, have based their opposition on the assumption that the 
KD3.5 billion budget was going to be used immediately. People 
should know it's for 12 years. He also denied allegations that 
half of the budget has already been spent. 
  The Defense Minister said that Kuwait has accepted a U.S. 
defense study on formulating a defense strategy in Kuwait. The 
U.S. study was picked up by top Kuwaiti military commanders in 
preference to studies submitted by Britain and France. "We 
explained to our friends in the three countries our position and 
requested a defense strategy to be suitable to us. A highly 
qualified Kuwaiti military team found that the U.S. study was 
the most appropriate. The strategy took into consideration 
Kuwait's financial and human resources," he said. The amounts 
allocated also involve expenses for training. After the 
liberation, as many as 14,000 Kuwaiti military personnel have 
undergone training courses mainly how to handle the advanced 
weapons. 
  Shaykh 'Ali insisted that the Ministry of Defense cannot 
disclose all defense information because "most of it is 
classified." He challenged those who criticise the military 
establishment to prove their allegations. "These very same 
people have criticised the purchase of the Warrior APCs from UK 
after about 90 officers from the Army decided it was the best 
for Kuwait after conducting on spot examinations on the vehicle. 
Commander of the land troops, Brigadier Salim Mas'ud 
recommended the APC and he is the one who is going to use in 
fighting". 
  The Minister urged MPs to "isolate Kuwait's national 
interests from that of their own private interests. Some are 
insisting on us to buy certain arms because of vested 
interests." He defended the military establishments in regard 
to allegations of wide-spread kickbacks and illegal commissions. 
"This has become an exhausted issue that has no sympathy from 
the public. They claim to be having the evidence and we say 
they can send it to the prosecution. In fact, they are still 
demanding information from us," stressed the minister in 
reference to the Assembly's fact-finding panel. 
  He revealed that MP Mubarak al-Duwaylah, one of the most 
outspoken critics of the ministry, has asked him to sack the 
chief of staff and undersecretary of the ministry because "they 
are thieves" as al-Duwaylah stressed. The minister refused. He 
also said that most of the Kuwaiti arms repatriated from Iraq 
have been repaired and used. 
  On the Bedouns, stateless Arabs, the minister said that all 
those who fought to defend Kuwait should be considered Kuwaitis 
even if those happen to be Iraqis. He stressed such persons 
will not be dismissed from the Kuwaiti armed forces. Bedouns in 
the army are granted Kuwaiti passports to travel to certain 
countries. 
  The current Peninsula Shield troops will be the nucleus for 
the proposed 100,000-strong Gulf Army. The troops will have 
three exercises by next year. Shaykh 'Ali also said the 
ministry will shortly submit a new law for conscription which 
may include increasing the duration for conscripts. 
  Commenting on reports speculating a cabinet reshuffle, the 
minister said there has been some "thinking" about improving the 
whole administration including the cabinet. Soon after that the 
thinking changed and it was thought it would be better to leave 
the Cabinet as it is now. "But, the final decision is with the 
Crown Prince and Prime Minister", he stressed. 
  Shaykh 'Ali announced that the Kuwaiti troops in Somalia 
have 
started pulling out despite the fact that the UN wants them to 
stay. The pull out of Kuwaiti troops coincides with pulling 
other troops.

  [Excerpts] Kuwait, 10 Apr -- Zheng Jinggi, Chinese 
ambassador to the State of Kuwait, has expressed his country's 
readiness to exert intensive efforts to protect Kuwait's 
legitimate rights and guarantee peace and security in the Gulf 
region. 
  The Chinese ambassador said in a statement to AL-QABAS, 
published here today, that China "calls for complete respect of 
Kuwait's sovereignty, the actual implementation of the Security 
Council's resolutions in connection with the border demarcation, 
and the release of prisoners, detainees, and missing persons." 
[passage omitted] 
  He praised bilateral relations between his country and 
Kuwait, particularly political, economic, and commercial 
relations, and pointed out that the Kuwaiti fund for Arab 
economic development has offered loans at easy terms for 11 
Chinese agricultural, industrial, and transport development 
projects, and that consultations are underway on six other 
projects. [passage omitted] 
  On the question of human rights in China, the ambassador 
affirmed that "China pays enormous attention to human rights," 
pointing out that "the Chinese people currently enjoy the widest 
democracy and freedom in history." 
  He said "we would like to conduct a dialogue on an equal 
basis on human rights with other countries, including the United 
States," to avoid the emergence of any obstacles which could 
affect the development of natural relations between the two 
countries because of this issue.

  [Text] Doha, April 10 (AFP)--An Israeli delegation is due 
here for the first time next month for talks on Middle East arms 
control, after Qatari foreign ministry sources said Sunday the 
negotiations would last from May 2 to 5. 
  Invitations to attend the talks in Doha have already started 
being sent out to interested countries and institutions to take 
part in the fifth round of talks on weapons non-proliferation, 
sources said. 
  But they refused to discuss any details of Israel's 
involvement in the negotiations, which form one of the five 
working groups set up as part of the multilateral Arab-Israeli 
peace process. 
  Israel is due to attend a meeting in Oman next Sunday to 
discuss water resources in the Middle East. 
  Oman will be the first Gulf monarchy to host a round of 
Middle East peace talks, at which the Israeli delegation is due 
to be led by Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin. 
  Neither Oman or Qatar, like the other Gulf monarchies, have 
any official diplomatic relations with Israel.

  [Text] Riyadh, 7 Apr -- In response to claims by the Yemeni 
paper AL-HIWAR, which stated that Saudi forces had penetrated 
five kilometers inside Yemeni territory, an official source at 
the Ministry of Defense, Aviation and the Inspectorate General 
said: The entire report of this paper is fabricated and has no 
foundation of truth. Yemeni officials themselves are aware of 
the extent of the falsity of the content of the newspaper's 
report. 
  The source added: As regard the other topics created by the 
said paper, they are, in our view, unworthy of any mention or 
consideration. 
  At the end of the statement the source said: While we are 
clarifying the truth to refute these claims, we underline the 
strength of the relations that link the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
and the Yemeni Republic.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Rahman Husayn in Washington] </F>
  [Excerpt] The United States has conveyed urgent information 
to an Arab capital, thus foiling an assassination plot just a 
few days before its implementation. 
  According to the information, a plot targeted Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, along with certain military and 
civilian leaders. The plot was to be linked to the current 
differences between Yemeni leaders, whether this was revealed 
before or after its implementation, in a manner that would pave 
the way for wide- scale fighting--not just a possible clash 
between the north and the south--that would drown the whole of 
Yemen in waves of fighting. 
  The source of the information at the U.S. Department of 
State 
refused to give more details on the plot, but hinted that 
regional quarters were aware of the plan and supported the 
assassination plot, which was due to be carried out during the 
first half of this month. 
  The source declined to reveal whether the Yemeni capital, 
Sanaa, was informed of the details of the plot or if only the 
Arab capital in question was asked to withdraw its support for 
the assassination plot and its sponsorship of those 
masterminding it. 
  The source also refused to draw a link between the current 
military buildup in Yemen and the exchange of accusations 
between the two main parties on one hand, and the assassination 
plot that was exposed on the other. It seems that the Yemeni 
leadership in Sanaa was not directly informed about the plot.

  [Text] Presidential Council Chairman brother Lieutenant 
General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih received at his office yesterday 
evening brothers Safwat al-Sharif, Egyptian minister of 
information and envoy of President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, and 
Rashid 'Abdallah al-Nu'aymi, minister of foreign affairs in the 
United Arab Emirates [UAE] and envoy of His Highness Shaykh 
Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan. 
  The two envoys relayed to the brother president messages 
from 
his brothers His Excellency President Muhammad Husni Mubarak and 
His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan on the two 
countries' joint efforts and endeavors to contain the crisis. 
  The messages affirmed that both Egypt and the UAE are 
committed to promoting and safeguarding Yemeni unity, given that 
it is a pan- Arab gain that must be protected in the interest of 
pan-Arab objectives and enhanced regional security and 
stability. The messages also underscored the need to resort to 
dialogue to resolve all differences in order to safeguard Yemeni 
unity and protect Yemen from mischief, God forbid. 
  The two messages also reiterated that Egypt and the UAE are 
eager to make every possible effort to approximate views, close 
Yemeni ranks, and pool resources to safeguard unity through the 
implementation of the accord document. They also indicated that 
all Arabs support Yemeni unity, and that they will not accept 
anything that could undermine this unity. They added that any 
party that believes otherwise is mistaken. 
  The two messages underlined the importance of halting media 
campaigns, and any step that could lead to infighting or 
violence. They also stressed the need to promote trust in order 
to create the propitious climate for dialogue in order to foster 
unity and safeguard stability in Yemen. 
  For his part, the brother Presidential Council chairman 
highly appreciated the good offices made by the Egyptian and UAE 
brothers, headed by brothers President Muhammad Husni Mubarak 
and His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan. He 
commended the noble pan-Arab positions they have taken to 
support their Yemeni brothers and foster Yemeni unity, which is 
not a gain for only Yemen, but for the entire Arab nation. He 
affirmed that Yemeni unity is the destiny and fate of the Yemeni 
people. He added: We will never abandon this unity, regardless 
of the costs. Any path other than unity will cause a 
catastrophe in Yemen. Such a catastrophe is bound to affect the 
region and the Arab nation. He affirmed his renunciation of 
war, and his adherence to dialogue as the best means of 
addressing the situation and meeting the challenges posed by the 
political crisis and its regrettable repercussions. 
  The brother Presidential Council chairman asked the two 
envoys to relay his greetings to his brothers President Muhammad 
Husni Mubarak and His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al 
Nuhayyan, and to also communicate to them his wishes of 
continued progress and prosperity for the Egyptian and UAE 
peoples.

  [Summary From Poor Reception] The Joint Military Committee 
led by Staff Colonel 'Ali Muhammad Salah, deputy chief of staff 
for operations affairs; and Staff Colonel Muhammad Haytham, 
deputy chief of staff for logistics affairs, has completed 
easing the security and military situation in the city of 
Dhamar. It defused tensions between the units, and returned the 
situation to normal. 
  The Joint Military Committee and the committee designated by 
the House of Representatives today visited the Republican Guard 
and Central Security camps in Dhamar. The two committees met 
with elite commanders and soldiers, who briefed them on the 
reasons for the military developments that led to some problems 
in the governorate. 
  During this visit, Staff Col. Salah and Staff Col. Haytham 
conveyed the greetings of Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme 
commander of the Armed Forces, to those affiliated with these 
units. They said that the two committees visited the 
governorate in order to learn about what happened and about the 
real situation there. They assured everyone that the current 
situation in the governorate is stable thanks to the good ones 
who assisted the Joint Military Committee since the very moment 
it arrived in the governorate. 
  The two colonels also asserted that the situation in the 
governorate is normal now. In his speech, Staff Col. Salah 
explained that we are the sons of one homeland who were trained 
and qualified to be honest guards of this people. He stressed 
that everyone should enjoy self-restraint, particularly under 
the current circumstances of the crisis in order to prevent the 
homeland's enemies from achieving their objectives. These 
enemies do not want stability, peace, and unity for us, he 
added, urging everyone to rise above differences. 
  In other development, the Joint Military Committee and the 
House committee held a meeting at the Dhamar governorate's 
building, which was also attended by the officials in charge of 
local and security authorities. They reviewed the governorate's 
security situation and some problems it is facing. 
  The two colonels made a statement to the Yemeni News Agency, 
SABA'. They emphasized that the security situation in the 
governorate of Dhamar had returned to normal and that the daily 
life of citizens is completely stable. They pointed out that 
the two committees continue to investigate the reasons for what 
happened. They also urged all political forces and leaders to 
adhere to what was agreed. 
  Afterward, the Joint Military Committee visited a camp in 
the 
town of Yarim. It met with the officers and soldiers of the 
camp, and was briefed on the difficulties they are facing.

<F P=106> [Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, head of </F>
the Islamic Propaganda Organization and acting Friday prayers 
leader, in Tehran on 8 April--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] I would like to make a 
friendly reference, on this occasion, to the issue of the Voice 
and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran. During the New Year 
holidays some programs were broadcast and you watched them. A 
number of newspapers wrote about those programs and some of the 
papers, to be fair, were quite honest, God bless them. They 
wrote about the weaknesses of those programs in detail. 
  The Vision [television] should think of ways to perform its 
duty. What is that duty? I have to only refer to it, as time 
is short and I have no other choice. The duty of that 
organization and other publicity organizations is to attract 
people, particularly the young generation, to sense right, 
justice, human qualities, and moral and spiritual issues. That 
is their duty. They should also stop people turning to indecent 
and inhuman acts -- wrong, oppression, treachery, and other 
filthy qualities. What can be done about that? People should 
sit down and think about that, and that is not easy. The nature 
of any person, particularly people who have not been properly 
educated, is toward pleasure. That is very clear. Those people 
follow anyone who better provides that pleasure. That is the 
initial nature of human beings. 
  The duty of those publicity organs is to see which of those 
pleasures are harmful and which are useful. They should sweeten 
the things that, in the first instance, appear to be bitter but 
are, in fact, useful -- just like a mother or a doctor does who 
covers a bitter medicine with sugar so that the child takes it. 
If it is not covered, then the child does not take the 
medicine. When it is covered, the child takes the medicine and 
gets better. That is the way programs should be presented -- 
sugar-coated -- so that what people initially reject, but is 
useful to them, seems appetizing. The same way, they should 
make the things that are harmful to the people taste bitter. 
[passage omitted] 
  It is easy to say these things, but their implementation 
brings a great deal of problems. 
  Now, the dear people who have accepted the new 
responsibilities at the Voice and Vision should work on those 
issues. Spiritual leaders, seminaries, believers, university 
lecturers, and everyone who can help them should offer their 
help so that that valuable service is rendered properly. 
  Another topic of discussion concerns the anniversary of the 
martyrdom of the Martyr Ayatollah Musa Sadr and his esteemed 
sister on 19 Farvardin [8 April]. These two dear ones were 
martyred after enduring torture in the prisons of Baathist Iraq. 
[passage omitted]. 
  Another issue concerns our problems in the political realm. 
A great deal of effort is being taken to force the Islamic 
Republic of Iran to surrender, and there is a plan by the United 
States, which is being clearly displayed in practice, to 
impoverish us financially. This is to say that the United 
States is trying to limit our oil income, which constitutes one 
of our country's sources of income, and, obviously, the more we 
earn from this source, the more developed our country will 
become, and the less we earn the greater the number of problems 
we will face. They are exerting pressures to reduce this income. 
  Their scheme is a dastardly one. In an OPEC meeting, 
everyone, except one member, agrees that oil production should 
be reduced so as to increase the prices. That certain member 
says: No, the production levels should stay unchanged for a 
while. This is despite the fact that the said member country, 
which itself earns its revenues from producing and exporting 
oil, fully understands that it will be harmed by such a policy. 
It also understands that losses will be incurred by other Arab 
countries and in fact all OPEC members. But they still say: Let 
everyone burn with us. This is what the situation is like. The 
said country is prepared to suffer losses, and also let the 
others -- which are after all its allies -- to lose as well. 
  This is how it is. They [not further identified] have 
played, wherever possible, a role similar to the one described 
above. However, we want to tell them something, which we want 
them to hear carefully, with all earplugs removed. We want to 
say that no matter what happens to us, we will never -- never -- 
surrender to America and Israel. This, in effect, means that we 
will never surrender to oppression, injustice, and coercion. 
[crowd chants in support] 
  We have Imam 'Ali in our history; we have Fatimah Zahra in 
our history; we have Ja'far Sadeq in our history; we have the 
martyrs of Karbala in our history. When we have these models, 
surrender does not mean anything to us. What are you going to 
do about it? Okay, you will exert more pressure on us; the 
implementation of our development plans might be delayed for a 
few years, but so what? Our people might be under a bit of 
pressure, that is right; but our people are ready to accept this. 
  If you see once in a while someone saying something, this is 
not the reason--a certain amount of discrimination does take 
place; some injustices take place; a certain amount of desire 
for the high life exists; people see a certain amount of 
wrong-doing from certain people. When the people see these, 
they complain, and they have a right to complain, and their 
complaints should be investigated. However, the fundamental 
issue remains the same. If the Islamic Republic and the 
revolution were to be destroyed under pressure who would accept 
this? Our models in our history have shown us the way. We 
shall eat hunger! We shall protect our faith! [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Tehran IRIB Television Second Program 
Network in Persian at 1441 GMT on 8 April carries the second 
Friday prayer from Qom by Ayatollah Haj Ebrahim Amini, lecturer 
at theological school and member of the Assembly of Experts. The 
sermon lasts 17 minutes. 
  In the second sermon he speaks, in part, about the severing 
of relations with the United States in 1980, which he says is 
now Muslim's number one enemy, and that Tehran will not 
reestablish relations with Washington. 
  He says: "One of the great events of the week is the 1980 
severing of relations with the United States. This severing of 
relations is a source of pride for Islamic Iran. Islamic Iran 
is proud to have such independence of spirit as to be able to 
put the United States aside. It is very happy about this and it 
is not prepared to return to American servitude. Although U.S. 
officials sometimes show courtesy here and there, such 
courtesies are to no avail as long as the United States does not 
end its wicked ways in the world [crowd noise] and as long as it 
does not end its enmity with Islam. The United States has 
really become the biggest enemy of Islam today. Those 
courtesies will bear no fruit and as long as the United States 
is a world Satan, Iranian people are determined not to establish 
any relations with it."

<F P=106> [Editorial by Hoseyn Shari'atmadari: "Which Fact?"] </F>
  [Text] On Friday, 1 April, His Eminence Ayatollah Yazdi, 
the esteemed head of the judiciary and the acting Friday imam of 
Tehran spoke about the Hajj issue in his Friday prayer sermons 
at Tehran University. There he stated some things that were 
"unfamiliar" to the pain-inured ears of his addressees. It was 
thought that his remarks were not "clear" because they were 
"brief." Therefore, it is necessary for him to answer questions 
about the ambiguities that his remarks on Friday raised in the 
minds of his friends and of his enemies, who are always lying in 
ambush with their spiteful analyses and commentaries. In taking 
advantage of the situation, Ayatollah Yazdi should give some 
clear explanations and thus remove all ambiguities. Some of the 
questions that have risen are: 
  A. The esteemed Friday prayer speaker, who is himself a 
high-ranking official, told the high-ranking officials of the 
country: "Bilateral or multilateral issues cannot be solved on a 
unilateral basis. One should never lose sight of this fact and 
solve the matter on a unilateral basis. Concerning the issue of 
hajj, one should accept that the problem is a bilateral 
problem..." 
  Ayatollah Yazdi has not given any explanation about the 
"unilateral solution" he considers to be illogical and also he 
did not say what he means by "bilateral and multilateral 
solutions." Does a bilateral solution mean that the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and the Saudi Government should consult each 
other and exchange views on solving the hajj issue? If that is 
it, then this is something that is done extensively every year, 
and reports concerning these talks are published in the mass 
media. Apparently, such bilateral consultations and talks 
cannot be what Ayatollah Yazdi meant, since in his sermon he 
told the worshipers "of course, you know that the responsible 
officials have been trying to have discussions -- they are 
discussing it...." Therefore, it seems that the "bilateral 
solution" that the head of the judiciary is proposing must be of 
another type. 
  Ayatollah Yazdi said in relation to this: "One should never 
lose sight of one fact that concerning the issue of hajj, one 
should accept that the problem is a bilateral problem." Again 
he does not explain what this "fact"(!) that one should "not 
lose sight of" is, or what the "problem" is which, according to 
him is "bilateral." What everyone knows, and which is extremely 
clear, is that performing the hajj is a definite right of all 
Muslims, and disavowing pagans is an indivisible part of the 
hajj. According to the imam and his successor, "a hajj without 
disavowal is not a hajj," and the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
always demanded and still demands this definite right. 
  Now, in order to remove all ambiguities, His Eminence 
Ayatollah Yazdi should answer the following questions: First of 
all, has the Islamic Republic of Iran asked for more than this 
from the Saudi Government? Secondly, are these two demands not 
the definite and natural rights of Muslims? If the answers to 
these questions are positive--which they are--then the next 
question is: What is the "fact" and the "problem" that the 
esteemed head of the judiciary is worried will be ignored? As 
everyone knows--something of which the Saudi rulers have 
repeatedly stated and that Ayatollah Yazdi is also clearly 
aware--the Saudis' "problem" is the organizing of the 
demonstrations during the Hajj ceremonies for the disavowal of 
pagans. The Saudis have said--and especially last year they 
said it blatantly--that because of U.S. pressures, they cannot 
allow the pilgrims to the House of God to organize these 
demonstrations! They insisted that this "fact"(!) should be 
understood by the officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran!? 
But if the esteemed head of the judiciary does not mean this 
when he refers to a problem(!) and a fact(!) then which 
"problem"(!) and which "fact"(!) is he talking about? 
  B. His Eminence Ayatollah Yazdi knows that after the bloody 
incident in Mecca and the massacre of the innocent pilgrims to 
the House of God by the Saudi Government in 1987 and after a 
three-year interruption in the hajj for Iranians, finally in 
1991 the foreign ministers of the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
Saudi Arabia officially agreed that each year at least 150,000 
Iranian pilgrims would go on the Hajj and organize the disavowal 
of pagans demonstrations in Holy Mecca on the sixth day of Dhu 
al-Hijja. This agreement was implemented in 1991 and 1992. But 
last year, the Saudi Government--despite this official 
agreement--deployed its military force and its armored units and 
APC's as if it was going to war against a gathering of unarmed 
pilgrims who were dressed only in their pilgrim's garb and were 
chanting "God is Great." And they prevented them from 
expressing their disgust with the polytheists of the twentieth 
century and with the modern idols! Therefore, should not the 
esteemed Friday prayer speaker have clearly referred to this 
breach of faith and spoken about the "fact" that the Saudi 
Government has officially trampled on official agreements and 
accords? 
  C. In another part of his second sermon, His Eminence 
Ayatollah Yazdi, strongly criticized the government's decision 
banning holders of passports from visiting Saudi Arabia during 
the Hajj ceremonies without observing formalities and said: 
  "I ask the honorable minister, and the esteemed deputy 
minister: Are you in a position to ban anyone from travelling 
abroad? Is leaving the country in your hands? What is the 
legal basis of your decision?" 
  Naturally the Government adopted this measure on the basis 
of 
interests and of norms and regulations. Instead of asking the 
worshipers, the esteemed speaker at the Friday prayers should 
have asked the officials--and he himself is a high-ranking 
official. As for us, even though we are not really aware of the 
reason for the decision to adopt such a measure, nevertheless we 
clearly consider it a logical decision in conformity with the 
people's interests. 
  Apparently the Saudi Government intends to independently(!) 
grant visas to 20,000 Iranian pilgrims outside the framework of 
the existing and official regulations of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran. The question that arises is: Would it not have been 
better for His Eminence Ayatollah Yazdi to ask the Saudi 
officials that if, according to what they allege, they cannot 
accept more than 60,000 Iranian pilgrims, why are they allowing 
20,000 more to go? And if this allegation is not sincere--and 
it is not--why do they want to reduce the quota of Iranian 
pilgrims? 
  The esteemed speaker at the Friday prayers definitely knows 
that currently, nearly 450,000 have applied for the Hajj. 
Therefore, is it fair for the definite right of these 
people--among them a large number of elderly women and men--to 
be handed over to others, even though they are also anxious to 
go on the Hajj? They have not applied and their names are not 
on the lists; but they can go anyway because of greater 
financial resources. Since the Saudis want to create 
impediments, is it right to take someone else's turn and to 
break the rules? In other words, in addition to the requirement 
of "affordability," as stated in the teachings [of the Koran], 
has "having more money" also been added to the list? 
Affordability for the Hajj applies to everyone who has the 
ability to perform the pilgrimage, and those who have more money 
do not take priority. And if there are limitations on performing 
the Hajj such as the Saudi officials have imposed, then the 
turns of those who "can afford the journey" and have applied and 
waited for years will be given to those who have more money. 
Finally, the esteemed speaker at the Friday prayers, who is 
himself one of the sympathizers and devoted servants of the 
Islamic revolution, should pay more attention to such points....

  [Text] Yemen's Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammad Salim 
Basindwah arrived in Tehran yesterday and was officially 
welcomed by Iran's foreign minister, 'Ali Akbar Velayati. This 
visit's aim is to submit the Yemeni president's message to 
Iran's president, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, to hold talks within 
the framework of mutual relations, as well to exchange views on 
most important regional and international issues. 
  To this end, in a meeting that was held by Iran and Yemen's 
foreign ministers, expansion and strengthening of ties between 
the two countries in political and economic fields, as well as 
the international situation, were discussed. During the talks, 
the two sides stressed unity and solidarity among the Islamic 
countries as (?necessary for combating) plots hatched by the 
enemies of Islam in view of the two countries' common history 
and religion. The two countries also expressed their 
willingness to expand mutual relations. 
  In this connection, Iran's foreign minister, Dr. Velayati 
said: The foreign forces cannot guarantee regional security, 
hence expansion of cooperations among the Islamic countries is 
necessary for strengthening the world of Islam. Dr Velayati 
said: If such a strong cooperation existed in the world of 
Islam, the enemies of Islam would not dare to occupy Palestine 
in the heart of the Islamic countries. 
  In part of his speech, Iran's foreign minister informed the 
Yemeni foreign minister of Iran's support for the reunification 
of Yemen, and described as effective the solving of Yemen's 
problems and the existence of a powerful Yemen in creating 
stability and peace in the region. 
  The realities of political conditions and equations in the 
region and the world are such that these countries have no 
option other than a realistic attitude toward regional issues. 
Such an attitude requires them to move in a direction in which 
expansion of all-sided regional relations, both political and 
economic, should enjoy top priority. At any rate, the 
experiences of the past few years have shown that although the 
regional countries, due to certain problems, have failed to have 
desirable relations, there are valuable chances, a sound and 
logical use of which can strengthen solidarity among the 
regional countries more than ever in the past. 
  In this connection, the Yemeni foreign minister's visit to 
Iran is an effective step that can be assessed within the 
framework of long-term objectives in expanding all-sided 
cooperation. These objectives are expected to receive further 
attention of the two countries' officials and to obtain 
desirable progress during the Yemeni foreign minister's visit to 
Tehran.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Drug Culture"] </F>
  [Text] The United States has produced another list of 
countries that it claims are not cooperating with its anti-drug 
trafficking efforts. Not surprisingly, Iran is included in the 
list, and according to U.S. sources, will not be eligible for 
receiving "U.S. aid" or U.S. support in obtaining loans from the 
World Bank. 
  Iran is using its own resources to fight drug producers and 
smugglers, and the effort is costing the Islamic Republic 
heavily, both in monetary and in human terms. Dozens of Iranian 
security forces members are killed or injured by drug smugglers 
every week, and the country is overstretching its financial 
resources in trying to cut the flow of drugs through its 
territories. This is no easy task since the border between Iran 
and Afghanistan, where most of the contraband is cultivated and 
transported to the U.S. and the European markets, stretches for 
hundreds of miles, and due to its remoteness, is extremely 
difficult to control. 
  Despite U.S. antagonism and Iran's own financial and 
technological limitations, the Islamic Republic continues to do 
its best to combat drug smuggling through its territory. Iran's 
Interior, Minister Mohamad Besharati, today announced the 
completion of a 30 km trench along Iran's eastern border where 
most of the illegal drugs enter Iranian territory. 
  The most important aspect of this issue is the fact that 
according to Western beliefs regarding the free market principle 
of supply and demand, supply will dwindle and vanish if demand 
is eliminated. 
  The voracious appetite of Americans for all kinds of drugs 
is 
a well known fact. Some U.S. administrations have made 
superficial attempts to curtail the use of drugs, but all 
government efforts have been cosmetic and were initiated as 
political ploys for attracting votes just before elections were 
due to be held. The most ludicrous and useless of these 
anti-drug campaigns was launched by the former U.S. first lady, 
Nancy Reagan, who coined the phrase "Just say no" in the naive 
belief that school children will be able to overcome peer 
pressure just by uttering a few meaningless words. 
  Illegal drug cultivation will continue so long as the United 
States and Europe provide such lucrative markets for its 
distribution, and the successful distribution of contraband 
drugs are only possible through the collusion and cooperation of 
the governments of drug consuming nations with drug 
distributors. Under these circumstances, it is hard to believe 
the sincerity and conviction of U.S. and other governments of 
drug consuming nations regarding their antidrug projects. 
  The annual revenue generated by the illegal drug trade in 
the 
West amounts to tens of billions of dollars and it seems 
implausible that the U.S. and other drug-using nations will 
allow this trade to continue without getting a share of its 
income. Also, the social fabric of these societies are 
conducive to the propagation of the drug culture. 
  The United States with its enormous wealth and its 
specialized anti-drug task forces is unable to stem the flow of 
drugs into its territories, and has repeatedly stated that it 
cannot control its borders effectively. If this statement is to 
be believed, then how can the same country expect others who 
lack its sophisticated technology and monetary resources to 
succeed in this campaign without financial and material help 
from world organizations charged with eradicating this 
dehumanizing trade. 
  It seems that the U.S. is, as usual, using any old excuse to 
single out the countries that are opposed to its policies for 
chastisement. On the one hand the United States insists that 
drugs must be eradicated and drug distributors must be punished. 
But on the other hand, through several international 
organizations which it finances, the U.S. condemns countries 
such as the Islamic Republic for executing convicted drug lords 
in accordance with the law of the land. 
  Before the United States passes judgment on other nations 
and 
societies, it will do well to take a look at its own society and 
start to implement social changes that will help its people find 
contentment and satisfaction in the everyday activities of the 
nucleus family rather than by using drugs.

  [Text] Tehran, 7 April, IRNA -- Commander of the Law 
Enforcement Forces and secretary of anti-drug campaign 
headquarters Brigadier General Reza Seyfollahi said here today 
that [words indistinct] claim regarding alleged Iranian flippant 
attitude towards drug trafficking revealed that Washington was 
worried about Iran's success in this area. 
  The U.S. under-secretary of state claimed Tuesday [5 April] 
that Iran and Syria were not serious in their anti-drug campaign. 
  Talking to IRNA, Seyfollahi said that the anti-drug efforts 
by various Iranian organizations particulary the law enforcement 
pesonnel and especially in the border areas with Pakistan and 
Afghanistan, had been admired several times by the international 
organizations. 
  He said that the international drug smugglers conducted by 
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) earned billions of 
dollars for the U.S. annually, however, as a result of Iran's 
vigorous campaign against the transit of drug to Europe and 
America via that Iranian territory, the U.S. Administration has 
suffered huge losses he added. 
  Seyfollahi said the U.S. by raising directed and calculated 
claims [passage indistinct] 
  He noted that the traffickers are generally equipped with 
the 
advanced U.S.-made weapons, and that a big part of the 
international drug trafficking operations are carried out under 
the financial and arms supports of the U.S. 
  "The U.S. and persons like Galindo Pohl who are under the 
influence of U.S., have times and again forwarded the unfounded 
claims that Iran executes political prisoners under the name of 
drug traffickers, in a bid to prevent Iran's decisive measures 
against narcotics."

  [Text] Tehran, 7 April, IRNA -- Some 95,215 kg of narcotics 
were seized by the law enforcement personnel last year, 
according to deputy chief of the force Brigadier General Ansari 
here Thursday. 
  He said that the amount of seizure was 24 percent more than 
the narcotic drugs seized the previous year. Ansari said that 
his forces also succeeded in busting 155 smuggling gangs and 
arresting 14,964 drug dealers. 
  Law enforcement activities over the past few years included 
building of 1,000 km of roads, 70 outposts, 140 watchtowers, 
blocking 20 passes frequented by drug traffickers and digging 38 
km of canals along border strip, he said. 
  Thanks to such measures, Ansari said, drug traffickers have 
been forced to take a longer route in Pakistan and Afghanistan. 
  The general said that 70 members of the law enforcement 
personnel attained martyrdom in 1993 in armed clashes with drug 
smugglers. The official referred to the forthcoming meeting in 
Tehran of Interpol (International Police) due to be held 4-6 
July, saying it [word indistinct] that Interpol considered Iran 
[word indistinct] was an [words indistinct] role in fighting 
drug trafficking effective. 
  He concluded that 20 countries are expected to attend the 
session, which will deal with ways and means of combating drug 
traffickers throughout the region.

  [Text] Mas'ud Rajavi, leader of the Iranian resistance, has 
urged the Iranian people to escalate the struggle against the 
ruling regime in Iran, to pave the way for the liberation army 
to pounce on the regime. 
  Addressing the sons of Iran during a gathering of thousands 
of national liberation army fighters at one of the liberation 
army's camps [in Iraq] on the new Iranian year, Rajavi said: 
"Escalate your protests against the authority. These protests 
will pave the way for the liberation army's major assault. The 
regime is destined to fall." 
  The resistance leader gave an elaborate account of the 
Iranians' tragic economic and social situation under the ruling 
regime because of the $50-million foreign debt and the collapse 
of the rial exchange rate.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Kordestan, as the barricade of freedom, has always 
been a thorn in the side of the ruling regime. From the very 
outset, the Islamic Republic has used all of its hellish 
strength to crush the national-democratic movement of our people 
and has not spared any crime or any violence -- neither 
military, police, nor political -- in this effort. 
Nevertheless, we see how, after 15 years of suppression, the 
Kordestan movement continues to stand strongly and powerfully in 
the struggle against reaction, and that the banner of this 
struggle continues to be in the powerful hands of the Democratic 
Party of Kordestan. 
  The Islamic Republic sees itself at an impasse any way it 
turns and it also is well aware that one day Kordestan will 
explode like a bomb and will shake the unpopular rule of the 
regime. Thus, thinking that it can prevent such a fate, it once 
again wants to send even more forces to Kordestan to further 
militarize this area and to display its military strength in 
this part of our country. 
  However, such a military expedition and such an amassing of 
forces in Kordestan not only does not show the strength of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran but, on the contrary, shows the 
regime's helplessness vis-a-vis the problems of Kordestan and 
the other (?national problems) in the country. 
  The regime is facing many problems because of the reduction 
in oil prices, its lack of credibility stemming from its 
inability to repay its foreign debts, the private sector's 
control over the foreign exchange market, the devaluation of the 
rial, because of the closure of a large number of (?plants and 
factories), and because of [word indistinct] (?shortages). 
Meanwhile, the people's dissatisfaction and aversion are 
growing. Unemployment and high prices are (?threatening) [words 
indistinct], and the regime's isolation on the international 
scenes and the West's pressures on the regime have [words 
indistinct] the ruling regime. 
  It is because of all these things that the Islamic Republic 
has decided to equip its armed forces more than ever and to 
prepare itself to confront possible incidents. The military 
maneuvers that were recently carried out by the law-enforcement 
forces were also because of this. 
  Clearly, there is a powerful popular movement in Kordestan. 
The regime lacks a (?political) base in this region, and 
Kordestan is the weakest link in the chain of the Islamic 
Republic's rule. So now the regime thinks that by a military 
expedition and by accelerating the militarization of Kordestan 
it can (?overcome these problems). However, the experience of 
the past 15 years has shown that supression and violence cannot 
destroy the struggle by the Kurdish masses, but that this 
struggle will become stronger each day. 
  We firmly believe that one day the military and police 
forces 
of the regime will melt like snowmen from the heat of the 
struggles by the Kurdish people. We thus assure the regime's 
officials that this time too, as in the past, they are making a 
mistake in their calculations on the Kordestan problem.

  [Text] Tehran, 9 April, IRNA -- The Iranian Embassy in 
Paris has denied allegations that Iran ever provided any arms to 
the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) of Algeria. 
  In a statement issued on Friday, the Iranian embassy denied 
claims raised by the French daily `LE FIGARO' on Iran's possible 
involvement in arms supply to FIS. 
  According to official reports released here an Israeli-made 
assault rifle has been found in the house of an Algerian 
national in Paris which was searched by the French police. 
  In the past, certain segments of western mass media have 
tried to justify the West's support for the military-installed 
government in Algeria by accusing foreign countries of 
involvement in the Islamic movement of the Algerian people.

  [Text] It took us 15 years to answer society's questions on 
what has come to be known as a "video." It was a question that 
may never have been raised or answered. [as published] After 15 
years, video clubs named cultural products stores and an 
organization affiliated to the Ministry of Culture and Islamic 
Guidance were set up, and a magazine named "Video and Satellite" 
was published. 
  The video had remained an underground phenomenon for 15 
years 
and now, when it is displayed in store windows, it has been 
drained in every possible way. This is why the cultural 
products stores were not greeted very enthusiastically. The 
video films had already exerted their destructive effect before 
they became public. In those days, the video cassettes 
circulated around the clock, from hand to hand, and perhaps this 
is still happening. 
  The interior minister said in an interview: "The cabinet is 
discussing the confiscation of all unauthorized satellite 
antennae from rooftops and the Interior Ministry will take steps 
in this direction shortly." 
  He said: "I give my word that in the next two months, with 
the forts of the law enforcement forces, all the satellite 
antennae in Tehran will be collected." 
  Is this the way to combat the satellite [programs]? Can we 
not perceive the difference in the words and deeds of the 
interior minister? If the satellite programs can be considered 
immoral and contrary to values, why is the magazine "Video and 
Satellite" published? Why are we still acting defensively? 
When the first satellite dish appeared on the rooftop, was it 
so minute that it could not be seen? Now two years later it is 
being decided that since a certain Arab country has announced a 
punishment for having satellite dishes, we should also think on 
the same lines. 
  When is the satellite authorized and when is it 
unauthorized? 
  This commentary should not be considered a case in favor of 
satellite dishes on rooftops, but why was this done so late? 
  The satellite is an international phenomenon and cannot be 
restricted in one region or even on one continent. One must 
view it in the international context and not as a minor issue. 
Satellite technology is progressing by leaps and bounds and 
perhaps by the next year satellite dishes with a diameter of 
only 35 centimeters may flood the regional and domestic market. 
Then what can be done? No promises will be of any use then.

  [Text] Brother President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] 
received yesterday evening Mr. (Larsen), general coordinator of 
the Special Committee for Palestinian police who was accompanied 
by officials in charge of the international presence in Hebron 
from Norway, Denmark, and Italy. 
  The meetings was also attended by brothers Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 
'Abbas], Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, and Hebron Mayor 
Mustafa al- Natshah and the members of its Municipal Council. 
  The practical steps and the mechanisms of the deployment of 
this international presence in Hebron, in implementation of UN 
Security Council's Resolution 904, were discussed during the 
meeting. 
  Brother President Abu-'Ammar stressed the importance of the 
international role in providing protection to our people and 
ending the siege and the curfew that has been imposed on the 
city by the Israeli Army for more than 40 days. He also 
emphasized the importance of the city's return to normal life. 
  The brother president expressed the PLO's eagerness to 
cooperate and coordinate with these forces, particularly as the 
brother mayor is the representative of brother President 
Abu-'Ammar to the joint committee in Hebron in charge of 
cooperation with the international presence.

  [Text] Tunis, 10 Apr (MENA)--Palestinian information 
sources have stated that President Yasir 'Arafat chaired a 
meeting of the Palestinian leadership yesterday and the day 
before yesterday to discuss the deteriorating economic situation 
of the Palestinians due to the Israeli blockade that has been 
imposed on the occupied territories for 45 days. This blockade, 
the sources added, was causing poverty and hunger in the 
territories. 
  The sources said that 'Arafat briefed the participants on 
the 
reports that he had received from Palestinian officials in Gaza 
and Hebron. The reports indicated that poverty and hunger have 
spread due to the Israeli military blockade and the ban on 
130,000 Palestinian workers from reporting to their work inside 
Israel. 
  According to the sources, 'Arafat had taken a number of 
urgent measures to avert further exacerbation of the crisis and 
to foil the Israeli attempt to import workers from abroad to 
replace the Palestinian workers, who are prevented from going to 
their work in Israel. 
  The sources said that, during his meeting with the 
ambassadors of the UN Security Council permanent member states 
in Cairo last week, 'Arafat briefed them on the tragic condition 
of well over two million Palestinians. 'Arafat told the envoys 
that this condition has been caused by Israel's disregard of its 
international commitments and its evasion of implementing the 
articles of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
'Arafat voiced his stern rejection of Israel's extortionist 
policy, according to the sources.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F>
negotiating delegation to the Cairo talks, by Faridah 
al-Shubashi on 8 April; place not given; from the weekly "The 
Event" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Shubashi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the 
Palestinian delegation in Cairo: What is your position, or 
specifically the PLO's position, on the 'Afula and Ashdod 
operations? 
  [Sha'th] We have a clear position, namely, that the peace 
process should end all acts of violence by both parties. All 
PLO factions have committed themselves to this issue. However, 
the problems, violence, and crimes committed by the Israeli 
settlers-- and we have not forgotten the Hebron massacre and, 
afterward, the massacre committed by the Israeli Army itself in 
Gaza--all this creates an atmosphere that escalates violence on 
both sides. In the 'Afula operation, not only Israeli civilians 
were killed, but Palestinians on the same bus were also killed 
or wounded. Consequently, we announced our denunciation and 
severe regret at this operation. We, however, linked it to what 
happened in Hebron and Gaza, and we insist on the fact that the 
way out of this continued escalation is commitment to the dates, 
signing the peace agreement, and creation of a new situation 
that will prevent the settlers' violence and, consequently, ban 
the violence carried out by all parties. 
  [Al-Shubashi] But, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, it seems that the Tel 
Aviv leaders have realized the matter, or understood the 
message. What about the negotiations? In the negotiations with 
the Israelis, have you touched on the recent developments? 
  [Sha'th] No. The Israelis decided to leave the negotiations 
on Wednesday, based on a notification sent in advance to us. 
We, however, did our best to deter them from doing so. We told 
them: How can the agreement be ready for signature on 13 April, 
now that you are leaving the negotiations for three and one-half 
days out of the remaining five days? This makes it impossible 
to sign the agreement on 13 April. We can only view this as 
procrastination. The Israeli delegation insisted on leaving the 
negotiations. This decision was made prior to the 'Afula 
operation. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Can we avoid linking this 
recent Israeli behavior -- namely, not to expedite the 
withdrawal or fulfilling the pledges stipulated by the 
Declaration of Principles -- on the one hand and the state of 
despair prevailing among the Palestinians in the occupied 
Palestinian territory on the other? Furthermore, wouldn't this 
situation create concern over attempts to curb the role of the 
PLO? 
  [Sha'th] In fact, the feeling of anger that prevails in the 
Palestinian arena is caused by Israeli practices carried out by 
settlers. It has become clear that the crimes and massacres by 
settlers have never been hidden from the Israeli Army. The 
inquiry has gradually revealed collusion and disregard in terms 
of controlling the settlers themselves. 
  We also found that the Israeli Army itself follows double 
standards. The violence practiced against the Palestinian 
people by the Israeli Army is not less than the crimes 
perpetrated by settlers. All this, in addition to the 
procrastination in reaching an agreement on the date set in the 
agreement we signed in Washington, create a state of anger and 
complaints in the ranks of our people. 
  Moving ahead toward assuming power, achieving Israeli 
withdrawal, the arrival of the Palestinian force and authority, 
and changing the situation on the ground will create a state of 
satisfaction among our Palestinian people. This was clear in 
Gaza. When Israeli withdrawal began and the groups of deportees 
returned there was a clear and remarkable change among the 
Palestinian masses in Gaza. This is natural. Without this, the 
anger, complaints, violence, and counter-violence will continue 
in our occupied territory. 
  [AL-Shubashi] Dr. Nabil, what is the way to get out of this 
vicious circle represented by Rabin's hesitation, the situation 
in the occupied territory, the frustration of the Palestinian 
people, and the eroding credibility of the PLO and the 
Palestinian leadership represented by President 'Arafat? How 
will the PLO overcome the situation so it will not reach an 
impasse? 
  [Sha'th] The peace, which we began in Madrid, and, then, the 
signing of the accord in Washington, must be implemented on the 
ground to gain support from the Palestinian and Israeli masses. 
We have been trying to end the talks at the set time. It is no 
secret to say that we have worked day and night over the past 
two weeks, particularly following the signing of the Hebron 
agreement, to accomplish the mission on the set date. We have 
prepared detailed plans for the entry of the Palestinian police 
and for Israeli withdrawal, and groups of deportees have 
returned home. 
  There is no doubt that we want the lists of deportees and 
prisoners to include all the sons of our people with all their 
factions. However, those who returned this time were not only 
from the historical political leaders, but also from the heroic 
leaders of the intifadah who have returned to lead the daily 
activities in the Palestinian street to receive the Palestinian 
police and authority and to change the situation on the ground. 
  Therefore, we tried to break this deadlock through intensive 
work on the level of the talks and on the level of the 
Palestinian police so that we enter on the fixed date. I do not 
see any other way to break the deadlock except this one. We 
need Arab and international support to achieve this. In other 
words, the solution lies in accomplishing the preparatory steps 
and entering the homeland as soon as possible. 
  [Al-Shubashi] What is your assessment of Peres' saying that 
Israeli withdrawal would be accomplished at the end of April? 
  [Sha'th] The problem is that we can longer see any respect 
for any set date. If the matter is clear and the agreement this 
time is firm we will have another opinion. We have enough 
flexibility to accept dates that are very close to 13 [April] if 
such dates are decided for purely practical reasons. However, 
we no longer trust these dates. We want these dates to be 
respected in order to accept any new steps for the future. The 
coming date now is 13 April, so we, as well as Minister Peres, 
should support any necessary effort to reach this date. During 
the telephone call which Minister Peres held with [Egyptian] 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, I spoke personally with him at his 
request and at the request of brother Minister 'Amr Musa. Peres 
tried to respond to our call for intensifying the talks and 
agreed on sending the Israeli delegation today, Friday, [8 
April], for at least one day so as not to waste time. The 
delegation will come again on Sunday. A few hours after this 
agreement, the office of Prime Minister Rabin denied this matter 
and claimed that he knows nothing about it and that the Israeli 
delegation cannot go to Egypt on Friday. 
  I believe that many things should be accomplished before 
restoring the credibility of Israeli dates on which they agreed 
with us. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Thank you, Dr. Nabil Sha'th. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, Yasir 'Arafat's special </F>
adviser, by 'Adi Talmor in the studio on 9 April; from the "In 
the Current Situation" program --recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Talmor] Mr. al-Tibi, you 
spoke with Yasir 'Arafat last night, and you have also met him 
in Cairo over the last few days. Is he still silent on the 
issue of terrorism? Has he explained to you why is he 
refraining from publicly denouncing these terrorist acts? 
  [Al-Tibi] Look, I was with the chairman in Cairo before we 
received the news about the murder in 'Afula. At the time 
'Arafat held a meeting with the Spanish foreign minister; there 
were a lot of Spanish, Egyptian, and other foreign journalists 
who wanted to speak to him about other issues, but he left the 
place. He did not want to speak to them. Later he refused to 
meet other journalists, some of them Israelis.... 
  [Talmor, interrupting] Washington, however, is exerting 
great pressure on him. 
  [Al-Tibi continues] After we received the report about the 
murderous attack on innocent civilians in 'Afula we held a 
closed meeting in which we formulated an unequivocal 
statement.... 
  [Talmor, interrupting] Why has 'Arafat himself not denounced 
this attack, as Rabin publicly and firmly did after the Hebron 
massacre. 
  [Al-Tibi] The chairman participated with us in formulating a 
statement, in which we expressed regret.... 
  [Talmor, interrupting] I want to ask again, why is 'Arafat 
afraid to publicly denounce these terrorist acts? 
  [Al-Tibi continues] ...and condolences for the bereaved 
families. This was done on behalf of the chairman, who said in 
the past that innocent people must not be harmed. This 
statement would not have been accepted without the chairman's 
involvement and approval. His position regarding such violence 
and terrorism is known; only a month ago he sharply denounced 
the murder of Mrs. Shoshan. I believe that the PLO statement 
was unequivocal. What the chairman told us on this issue is 
extremely clear and firm. 
  [Talmor] Why, then, does Washington still insist that 
'Arafat publicly denounce these acts? 
  [Al-Tibi] The 'Afula attack is doubtlessly a most terrible 
murder of innocent people. A murder is a murder is a murder. I 
believe this attack must be denounced. 
  [Talmor] I, however, still insist 'Arafat should publicly 
denounce the attack. Some people claim, for example, that he is 
afraid to publicly denounce the attack because of PLO 
rapprochement efforts with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. 
Some people even claim the PLO is coordinating with Hamas, and 
a public denunciation of Hamas terror acts could harm these 
efforts. 
  [Al-Tibi] These claims are utter nonsense. The PLO's and 
'Arafat's stand on violence and terrorism is known and is 
expressed whenever there are such grave incidents. This 
position was also expressed after the murder of Mrs. Shoshan. 
There is absolutely no coordination between the PLO and Hamas 
in this area, and whoever says so does not know what he is 
talking about. This issue does not deserve any further comment. 
  [Talmor] Despite the recent acts of terrorism and the fact 
that it was the PLO that halted the negotiations following the 
Hebron massacre, the Israeli Government yesterday said it wants 
to facilitate the negotiations, while accusing you of delaying 
the talks. What is your reaction to this? 
  [Al-Tibi] It was the Israeli side that suspended the talks 
several days ago, not the Palestinians. They did this due to 
Holocaust Memorial Day. But instead of halting the talks for 
one day only they did it for three days. The claim that the 
Palestinians halted the talks is baseless. It is in our 
interest to end the talks as soon as possible in order to 
immediately receive the authority and power in Gaza and Jericho. 
At this point there are still controversial issues, due to 
obstacles placed by the Israeli delegation on the way to 
achieving an agreement between the two sides -- mainly in 
relation to the deployment of the Palestinian police force; the 
timetable for such a deployment; legal responsibility, and other 
issues I do not want to broach. 
  [Talmor] Do you believe you will be able to control the area 
when you receive the authority? 
  [Al-Tibi] At this point the PLO is still not in control of 
the occupied territories. It is far away from them. The IDF is 
in charge there at the present time. I believe that in future 
the Palestinians will maintain full control of all areas under 
their authority.

  [Text] Brother Marwan Kanafani, adviser to brother 
Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], president of the state of Palestine 
and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, made the following 
statement: 
  It is very strange to hear this kind of logic from Shimon 
Peres, Israeli foreign affairs minister, especially because 
neither he nor Prime Minister Rabin have expressed any kind of 
regret and condemnation when the Israeli army and intelligence 
deliberately assassinated six young leaders from the Fatah 
Movement in Gaza recently. On the contrary, the Israeli housing 
minister expressed his appreciation and that of the government 
and the Israeli army for this kind of terrorist act immediately 
after the weekly meeting of the Israeli cabinet.

  [Text] Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], has said that the 
growing popular Palestinian resistance will wreck the Oslo and 
Cairo agreements. He stressed that it is impossible to coexist 
with the settlements and that there is no alternative to the 
removal of the occupation. Nayif Hawatimah renewed his 
criticism of the Palestinian leadership, which, he said, has 
ceded all the Palestinian people's demands after the Hebron 
massacre. 
  Meanwhile, the unified central leadership of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] and the DFLP 
demanded PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and his team resign. It 
condemned the occupation authorities' decision to close the 
occupied Palestinian territories, deeming it a collective 
detention of the Palestinian people.

<F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>
  [Excerpts] PLO Executive Committee member Sulayman 
al-Najjab has said that he supports political settlement, 
without one- upmanship, despite his reservations about the Oslo 
accord. He added that Israel is to blame for the impasse in the 
Cairo talks, adding that he is against all solutions that 
confiscate the rights of the Palestinian people. [passage 
omitted] 
  In a meeting with local journalists on 9 April, al-Najjab 
said the Rabin government wants Palestinian recognition of the 
status quo and agreement on arrangements that lead to some sort 
of civilian administration linked to a military governor, and 
not a self-rule or Palestinian authority that assumes the powers 
of the Israeli military authority. 
  Al-Najjab added: What is happening now in Gaza and Jericho 
is not an Israeli withdrawal, as some people like to call it. 
It is, in reality, a redeployment of Israeli troops by keeping 
a distance from populated areas while maintaining control over 
the land. 
  He added: We see trucks carrying office equipment and 
cabinets leaving this center or that in Gaza to Qatif settlement 
and in Jericho to 'Aqabat Jabr. "Is the Israeli occupation an 
administrative one?" 
  He pointed out that besieging the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
including 2 million Palestinians, is meant to further isolate 
Jerusalem, cause real starvation for the entire population, 
bring them to their knees, and break their resistance. 
Afterward, the Israelis will ask for a political price for a 
partial lifting of the siege. [passage omitted] 
  Assessing the 'Afula operation, al-Najjab said: Striking at 
civilians does not serve the Palestinian cause. The operation 
has given the Zionists a chance to say that the conflict is a 
racist one and not against the occupation of our land and holy 
places. 
  He said the U.S.-Israeli demand that President 'Arafat 
condemn the operation is simply "hypocrisy." The political 
wisdom of President 'Arafat should have told him to be the first 
to condemn the operation so that they will not use the operation 
to tighten starvation and escalate killing of the Palestinian 
people. 
  Answering a question, al-Najjab said: The relationship 
between the PLO and the United States is characterized by 
"warnings". Whenever there is an impasse in the negotiations 
with the Israelis, 'Arafat receives another U.S. warning. 
Al-Najjab said he had attended several meetings between 
President 'Arafat and the U.S. ambassador in Tunis, which were 
meant only to deliver a warning from the U.S. Administration to 
the Palestinian leadership. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Brothers, our great and militant Palestinian 
people, our glorious Arab nation: Serious questions, usually 
dodged by Israeli leaders, resurfaced following the heroic 
'Afula operation, effected by heroes of the Palestinian 
revolution, which left a heroic martyr bomber dead and close to 
50 Israelis dead or wounded. 
  The first question is: Why all the foot dragging and 
compromising in putting into practice PLO-Israel agreements 
calling for an Israeli withdrawal, deployment of Palestinian 
police, and the transfer of power to Palestinian authorities? 
  The general consensus is that the responsibility [for the 
'Afula operation] must be borne by the Israeli Government 
because it is letting itself be swayed by extremists, settlers, 
and army generals who thrive on war and bloodshed. The result 
has been massacres perpetrated against the Palestinian people at 
the Ibrahimi Mosque, in Hebron itself, in the Jabalyah camp in 
Gaza, and throughout the Palestinian territory where the 
Palestinians are being killed at random. 
  We have been telling the Israelis that violence breeds 
violence and that blood [words indistinct] and that they should 
honor agreements to which they put their signatures and observe 
agreed upon dates. If the Israeli Government had met the 13 
December date for implementation of the accord, much of the 
chaste blood spilled in Hebron, Gaza, Khan Yunus, Janin, 
Tulkarm, and Ramallah would have been spared. However, in 
appeasing terror and terrorists in the settler and military 
communities, the Israeli Government is turning a deaf ear to the 
voice of truth, and the result is a vicious cycle of violence, 
suffering, and blood. 
  Will the 'Afula operation bring the Israeli leadership to 
its 
senses? Will the Israeli leaders understand that killing 
Palestinians cannot but have a price? Will they learn the 
lesson that the protection of human life depends on the 
establishment of peace rather than [words indistinct] and 
procrastination. 
  It is hoped that acts of violence will give pause to all the 
parties and prompt increased determination to reach the kind of 
peace that obtains security for all concerned, saves lives on 
all sides, and assures Palestinian rights, without which peace 
will remain elusive.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Intifadah Enters the Arms Phase"] </F>
  [Text] Tension has been mounting in the occupied Arab 
territories since the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron. 
After the suicide operation carried out by one of the fedayeen 
of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas in 'Afula, in which 
eight Israelis were killed and at least 50 wounded, there have 
been other operations in the cities of the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip throughout the past two days, especially the 
operation carried out in Ashdod by an Islamic Jihad Movement 
fighter in which one Israeli was killed and four others were 
wounded. 
  This escalation occurs as the current Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations on the implementation of the Oslo agreement stumble 
because of Israel's refusal to set a date for the start of the 
withdrawal of its forces from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho 
area, and Israel's timewasting in discussion of minor details. 
Just as the Hebron massacre underlined the importance of 
Palestinian security and the difficulty of coexistence between 
the Palestinians and the armed settlers, the latest fedayeen 
operations against Israelis inside the so-called green line and 
in the Gaza Strip confirm that the Hebrew state will never have 
security and stability so long as it maintains its current 
policy of humiliating the Arab negotiators and trying to 
blackmail them and to have both peace and land. 
  The United States and its current administration is 
responsible for the deteriorating situation in the occupied 
territories because it has, for the past seven months, ignored 
the PLO's appeals for intervention to break the negotiation 
deadlock. 
  President Clinton's administration has allowed Israel to 
persist in its conceit and arrogance in dealing with the 
Palestinians. When the Hebron massacre occurred, it was 
reluctant to condemn Israel and refused to vote in favor of the 
draft resolution calling for the disarmament of the settlers and 
the provision of international protection for the people of the 
West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It is regrettable that the U.S. 
Administration has been putting intense pressure on the PLO over 
the past two days to make it condemn the 'Afula suicide 
operation. It did not exert the same pressure on Israel after 
the Jabalya massacre in which eight people were unjustifiably 
killed by Israeli special units. American officials, in making 
such demands -- which to them are ordinary demands -- on the 
PLO, fail to understand their dangers and their negative, 
perhaps even catastrophic, effects, and that is because they do 
not understand the Arab and, particularly, the Palestinian 
mentality. Any fedayeen operation against Israelis is received 
with applause and satisfaction in the occupied territories, and 
anyone who carries it out is a hero and a martyr who is buried 
in the graveyard of the martyrs and the immortals. 
  Nobody can blame them for that conviction, for they have 
suffered the fire of daily Israeli repression and they face 
Israeli bullets with their chests. Any condemnation of the 
fedayeen operations is seen as a perpetuation of the occupation 
and as a blessing on its settlements and aggressive policies. 
That is why the PLO is very reluctant to give in to U.S. 
demands in this connection. 
  The officials responsible for U.S. policy in the Arab region 
-- and some of them are Jews -- aim to isolate the PLO from its 
people and they aim to foment internal sedition in the occupied 
territories by calling on the PLO to condemn a legitimate act 
such as is carried out by all peoples of the world in the march 
toward independence and liberation. Resistance remains a 
legitimate and necessary element so long as there is occupation, 
and even more so when it is a repressive, colonialist, 
expansionist occupation like the current Israeli occupation of 
Palestinian. 
  What is happening in the occupied territory is a renewal of 
the intifadah and a shift from the war of knives to the war of 
arms and explosives, which is, without doubt, the bloodiest and 
most dangerous war. Israel and the United States are to blame 
for this shift and its consequences because they aborted the 
peace process in the first real test on 13 December when Israel 
was supposed to begin withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the 
Jericho area, and in doing so they gave extremism a golden 
opportunity to overtake moderation and to increase its popular 
following in the occupied territories. That is what Israel 
wanted and what it had planned and continues to plan for because 
it does not want to give up the territory nor to commit itself 
to any peaceful settlement.

  [Text] We have received the following letter from 'Abd-al- 
Rahim Malluh, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], reacting to a news 
report published under the headline "Weapons Seized in Habash's 
Car." The text of the letter follows: 
  Mr. Ra'id Salihah, Editor of AL-BILAD newspaper, 
  Greetings: 
  Issue Number 61, dated 9 March, 1994, of AL-BILAD published 
the following in the center of the front page, under the 
headline "Weapons Seized in Habash's Car:" 
  "The Jordanian version says that during Habash's recent 
visit 
to Jordan, his car was searched and found to contain 
miscellaneous weapons and silencers. Meanwhile, security 
agencies have begun stepping up surveillance at Jordan's border 
points to thwart any gun-smuggling attempts, especially after 
the two movie theater bombings." 
  This report carried by your newspaper is baseless and only 
seeks to discredit comrade Secretary General George Habash. 
  Such rumors are calculated to harm Palestinian-Jordanian 
relations and to resurrect the events of the past [the 
September, 1970 clashes that pitted Palestinian guerrillas 
against the Jordanian military] that sincere attempts have been 
made on all sides to relegate into oblivion. It is fair to say 
that political developments since have helped us all to overcome 
the legacies of the past and have opened the doors wide for 
building Palestinian- Jordanian relations on solid foundations 
inspired by distinguished relations between the two brother 
peoples and their joint confrontation of the Zionist enemy. 
  The charge that George Habash sought to smuggle weapons is 
absolutely baseless, and state agencies in Jordan can confirm 
this. 
  Dr. Habash is a sufficiently credible and self-respecting 
person not to abuse the special privileges offered him by the 
state authorities during his visits to compromise the country's 
security and stability. 
  We cannot make sense out of the connection you made between 
the fabricated report and the movie theater bombings and the 
subsequent measures taken by the Jordanian authorities unless 
the aim is to discredit the PFLP, and George Habash in 
particular, and the factions of the Palestinian revolution in 
general. 
  We have consistently come out against any actions designed 
to 
undermine Jordan's security, including the barbaric bombings of 
the movie houses. 
  For the record, on his last visit here on 23 February, 1994, 
Dr. Habash was not subjected to any searches at the border, and 
was treated with all the respect due a national patriot. 
  [Signed] 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, PFLP Political Bureau member

<F P=106> [Interview with Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the </F>
Islamic Jihad Organization, by Sana' al-Imam in Damascus; date 
not given; from the weekly "The Event" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Shaqaqi] First, this military act [the 7 April 
Ashdod attack] falls in the context of our continuous jihad and 
struggle against the Zionist occupation. It also falls in the 
context of our response to the massacres of our Palestinian 
people, especially the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. It is 
unreasonable for us to see our people being slaughtered in front 
of our very eyes and to remain idle. This act of jihad by us 
also falls in the context of responding to the Oslo agreement. 
We do not agree that it is a plot to liquidate the Palestine 
question. We do not hide our objection to this agreement. We 
do not conceal that we are doing our best to thwart this 
agreement. 
  [Al-Imam] Mr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, Israel may withdraw from 
Gaza 
and Jericho and hand the authority there to the Palestinians or 
the PLO. In case of your continued resistance and military 
operations, do you not fear that inter-Palestinian 
confrontations may take place? 
  [Al-Shaqaqi] First, if it [Israel] really wants to withdraw 
from Gaza, as you are saying, then there will be no need for 
confrontations in the Gaza Strip. This is because there will be 
no Israelis. But if Israelis remain there--army and 
settlements--this means they will not withdraw. Actually, the 
Israelis are redeploying their troops in the Gaza Strip. In 
fact, the future in the Gaza Strip is vague. Nobody, neither 
Rabin nor 'Arafat, can define the picture in Gaza after one or 
two months. However, in any case, the Gaza Strip and Jericho do 
not constitute more than 2 percent of the size of Palestine. 
This leaves 98 percent of Palestine. We will have the right 
to confront the occupation anywhere there. Our jihad and 
struggle will continue in the land occupied in 1948, the West 
Bank, and Jerusalem. We will do our best to escalate this jihad 
and struggle. As for the Gaza Strip, as I said, the situation 
is vague. If there is a real withdrawal, there will be no need 
for our continued fighting. But if there is no real withdrawal, 
then it will be our right to chase the remaining 
occupation--troops and settlers alike. However, I would like to 
emphasize that our struggle and jihad against the Zionist 
occupation does not in any way mean that it will collide with 
any segment of our people. We will not collide with any other 
Palestinian force. We will do our best to avoid being driven to 
such a point. I believe that many options are available to us. 
Such options can spare us such a collision.

<F P=106> [Interview with Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, Hamas representative </F>
in Syria, by Sana' al-Imam, in Damascus; date not given; from 
the weekly "The Event" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mustafa] The purpose of the 'Afula operation was 
to avenge the martyrs of the bloody Ramadan dawn in the Ibrahimi 
Mosque in Hebron. Revenge was inevitable. Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] is confident that 'Arafat will not go back 
on the negotiations. He has burned all his bridges. He will 
not return to the trench of the people, the intifadah, and the 
resistance. The only thing he has left is to pursue the 
conspiracy to the end. It is like a person who falls in deep 
mud; whenever he tries to come out of the mud, he sinks deeper. 
We are really astonished at the U.S. position and that of the 
Security Council and some nations that condemned this great 
operation of martyrdom, carried out for revenge and to deter the 
Zionist usurpers from committing more operations. It took the 
Security Council three weeks to issue a resolution condemning 
the crime of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. On the other hand, it 
was only a matter of hours before it condemned this revenge 
operation, which is part of the resistance against occupation 
and usurpation. Does the Security Council act upon U.S-Zionist 
orders? Is it no longer a council for world peace and world 
peoples? 
  [Al-Imam] Hamas is not satisfied with this operation. It 
has threatened to fire rockets at the homes of settlers in the 
occupied territories. On what basis did Hamas launch these 
threats? Will these threats be carried out? I wonder if Hamas 
really has the weapons required to carry out such threats? 
  [Mustafa] First of all, the Palestinian people, Hamas, and 
all free men, are demanding that the usurper occupiers leave our 
land and go to their original home. They will live in peace 
after the return of four million Palestinians who were made 
homeless by Zionist usurpation. Those Zionist settlers and 
soldiers are practicing killing, terrorism, and deportation. 
They are practicing rape and violating sanctities. This is the 
demand Hamas has made to those settlers. Otherwise, it has 
threatened them with rockets, just like the Zionists launched 
rockets against our people and villages and safe and defenseless 
homes before and during the intifadah. When Hamas declares 
this, it is aware that the Palestinian people know Hamas keeps 
its promises. It has earned its credibility through its 
successive statements and positions. This is not credibility 
won by propaganda and fame. It is true credibility won on the 
battlefield. Therefore, the threats Hamas has launched to fire 
the rocket shells, which God has given it recently, as stated in 
the recent military communique, represent a true announcement. 
This is not cheap propaganda. It is not to win fame. Hamas 
and the al-Qassam Battalions have proven this during the 
intifadah.

  [Text] Cairo, 10 Apr (MENA)--A new round of 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the implementation of 
autonomy in Gaza and Jericho resumed at noon today in Cairo. 
The Palestinian side is chaired by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, 
Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, and 
Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of staff. 
  Responsible Palestinian sources said that this round of 
negotiations, which will continue until the day after tomorrow, 
Tuesday, started with a closed meeting between the heads of the 
Palestinian and the Israeli delegations to set the agenda for 
the talks. Then, the meetings of the Security, Civilian, and 
Legal Affairs Committees started. 
  Responsible Palestinian sources told MENA that the Security 
Affairs Committee will mainly discuss a withdrawal schedule for 
the Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and Jericho region. It 
will also discuss the agenda for the entry of the Palestinian 
police force. The number of men in this force will range between 
9,000 and 10,000 men. This was the reason for the breakdown of 
the negotiations last week. 
  The same sources said that the Palestinian side proposed the 
possibility of the Israeli forces' withdrawal during a period 
ranging between seven days to less than two weeks starting from 
the date the final agreement is signed. 
  The sources added that the two sides will also discuss a 
number of other issues dealing with the security arrangements in 
the autonomy areas, the security of the settlements, and issues 
pertaining to the security zones around these settlements. 
These are all issues that were not finalized during the 
previous rounds of talks. 
  The Palestinian sources added that another issue under 
discussion is the return of Palestinian deportees expelled by 
the Israeli authorities after 1967 on the pretext that they were 
carrying out actions hostile to the Israeli occupation. They 
are estimated at around 2,200 deportees. 
  Israel has already taken back 200 deportees in several 
groups 
since the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles was 
signed in Washington in September 1993. The Palestinian 
negotiators are demanding the return of all deportees to their 
homeland as soon as possible. 
  The Palestinian sources denied that the Palestinian and 
Israeli negotiators have agreed on a timetable for the release 
of Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Israeli jails, 
estimated to number about 10,400 prisoners according to the 
statistics of the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
They also denied that the Palestinians have agreed to exclude 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] detainees from the release 
agreement. They affirmed that the PLO insists on the release of 
all Palestinian detainees. 
  The Palestinian-Israeli Civilian Affairs Committee is due to 
discuss in its meeting today the transfer of authorities, 
services, and utilities to the Palestinian side. An important 
issue under discussion is the transfer of authority over water 
resources. 
  The Israelis have said that this issue was not discussed at 
previous meetings because no Palestinian water experts were 
present. The Palestinians and Israelis agree that considerable 
progress has been made in the discussions of the Civilian 
Affairs Committee over the past several rounds of talks, leaving 
only a few minor points of disagreements. They pointed out, 
however, that an overall agreement in the negotiations cannot be 
attained until the two delegations sort out their security 
differences. 
  The Palestinian sources pointed out that if no progress is 
made in the current round of talks, seen to be revolving in a 
vicious circle, then it will be imperative to hold a meeting of 
high-level officials from both parties to remove the current 
obstacles. Consequently, it is likely that a meeting will be 
held in Cairo next Sunday [17 April] between PLO Executive 
Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas "Abu-Mazin" and Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres. It should be noted that Mahmud 'Abbas 
is currently in Cairo, closely following the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations while holding talks with Egyptian officials. 
'Abbas held a lengthy meeting with the members of the 
Palestinian delegation to agree on the negotiating method in the 
current round of talks. 
  The Palestinian sources announced that the 
Palestinian-Israeli Legal Affairs Committee, one of the 
committees formed by the Gaza- Jericho meetings, will discuss 
today the wording of the general agreement and the legal text of 
the articles already agreed upon by the two delegations.

  [Text] Progress was made in the Cairo negotiations with 
the Palestinians, which continued until very late last night, 
although there is doubt the talks will be concluded by 13 April. 
Our correspondent in Cairo Arye Gus reports that the 
Palestinians are making efforts to reach an agreement by that 
date. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 0400 GMT on 11 April 
adds that "from Tunis we have word that chances are slim for a 
meeting in Bucharest this week between Foreign Minister Peres 
and Yasir 'Arafat."] 
  In the discussions of the civilian affairs committee, 
agreement was reached on archaeology, fuel, and environment 
issues. The team is to discuss the water problems today. There 
is still dispute regarding jurisdiction over temporary residents 
and tourists. 
  The military committee resumed discussions on the deployment 
of the Palestinian police, the foreign observers, and the joint 
patrols. The Palestinians demanded that the closure be lifted 
and that prisoners be released. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 11 April adds 
in 
a related report from Cairo by Udi Segal: "The PLO has asked 
that Israel set a date for signing the Gaza and Jericho 
agreement. The Palestinian delegates in Cairo made it clear 
that until such a date is set, they will not begin the 
deployment of the Palestinian police in Gaza and Jericho, but 
the Israelis refused to set such a date. Furthermore, they made 
it absolutely clear to the Palestinians that 13 April is no 
longer a target date of any kind. 
  ["The Palestinians tried to apply pressure last night and 
force Israel to make some gesture or symbolic move on 13 April, 
but the Israelis stood firm, explaining that no move will be 
made because the PLO has not taken even a single step to show it 
is willing to implement the agreement. Had the Palestinians 
started to deploy their police force and assume some control of 
the territory, we could have considered such a move, an Israeli 
delegate told us late last night. In the meantime, they have 
done nothing of the sort. 
  ["Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the delegation, told 
his Palestinian counterparts last night that the time when the 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will complete its withdrawal from 
Gaza and Jericho depends only on them. Shahaq said: on an 
operational level, we are able to complete the withdrawal, but 
until you take up your positions, we remain in charge."]

  [Text] Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the 
implementation of the self-rule agreement will resume in Cairo 
this morning, just days before the date set for the Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on 13 April. The two sides 
held talks all day yesterday, with chief Palestinian negotiator 
Nabil Sha'th describing the negotiations as positive. But 
Sha'th declined to give any details of progress in the talks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F>
delegation, by Sa'id Mu'addi in Cairo on 11 April; from the 
"With the Midday Events" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] How do you evaluate the first day of 
negotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian sides? 
  [Sha'th] I think many positive things were realized today, 
but we cannot say yet that something has been achieved. As you 
know, we are late, and we wanted and still want to complete our 
work before 13 April, and to sign the agreement as scheduled. 
This led us to call for not delaying the talks and to do what 
has to be done to conclude this agreement. Nevertheless, I say 
that the first day was not bad, and some positive things have 
taken place. 
  [Mu'addi] What subjects were discussed today? 
  [Sha'th] All issues were discussed. We discussed the subject 
of the Palestinian police, its armament, and number. We 
discussed security in the Gaza Strip. In the Legal Committee, 
we discussed issues relating to legal and judicial jurisdiction. 
We also discussed the transfer of civilian powers. We 
discussed the freeing of prisoners. I believe we made important 
progress on the full plan for releasing prisoners. I also 
believe that we made progress regarding civilian powers. 
Perhaps, we will be able before the end of this round to 
announce some specific achievements. We also strongly demanded 
an end to this security blockade that closed the doors before 
our people in the West Bank and Gaza, especially in Jerusalem, 
and threatened their livlihoods and business dealings at a stage 
that cannot tolerate much obstruction. We also discussed the 
need to end the security blockade and curfew in Hebron that 
suffered much after the Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre. Perhaps, we 
will be able to make some achievements in this field too. 
  [Mu'addi] Will the negotiations resume next Sunday? 
  [Sha'th] Yes, we will stay here, and if we fail to conclude 
our talks tomorrow, we will resume the talks next week. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, one final question. When will the 
vanguards of the Palestinian police arrive in the Gaza Strip? 
  [Sha'th] This is one of the subjects that we are discussing. 
I believe that large numbers will start to arrive soon after 
the agreement is signed, and this is what we want to do as soon 
as possible. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian 
delegation, thank you very much. 
  [Sha'th) Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by Mona Salem] </F>
  [Text] Cairo, April 11 (AFP)--The PLO chief negotiator 
acknowledged here Monday that it was now impossible to meet the 
target date for launching Palestinian self-rule with just two 
days to go, despite progress in talks with Israel. 
  "I don't think we can resolve (the outstanding issues) by 
April 13," although there has been "progress Sunday in talks on 
jurisdiction" in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank town of 
Jericho, Nabil Sha'th told AFP. 
  Sha'th said the Israeli delegation had presented new 
proposals for jurisdiction in Gaza and Jericho "which could open 
the way to real progress." 
  Under the Declaration of Principles signed between Israel 
and 
the PLO in September, Israel was to have started its withdrawal 
from the two areas on December 13 and was to complete it by 
April 13. 
  PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat has insisted that Wednesday's 
deadline should be met. 
  In a phone call to US Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 
he urged Washington to step up efforts to ensure the success of 
the talks, warning a failure to meet the target date would harm 
the credibility of the peace process. 
  Talks reopened Sunday in the Egyptian capital after a 
four-day break and are due to continue until Tuesday in a bid to 
wrap up an accord on implementing Palestinian autonomy. 
  Sha'th added there had been progress both on prisoners and 
on 
security matters, including the deployment of a 9,000-strong 
Palestinian police force to take over from the Israeli army when 
it withdraws. 
  Security issues have bogged down over a date and timetable 
for an Israeli pull-out, and the deployment of the Palestinian 
police. 
  He also said the two sides had "come close" to agreement on 
the release of around 10,000 Palestinian prisoners being held in 
Israeli jails. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organisation is demanding the 
release of all prisoners, including Islamic militants. 
  But Israel has refused to free members of militant 
organisations such as the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS) or 
the Islamic Jihad, and those responsible for bloody attacks on 
Israelis. 
  Asked Monday if Islamic militants would be included in an 
agreement, Sha'th said: "All the prisoners are going to be 
scheduled for release one day or another. We represent all the 
Palestinian people." 
  Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin charged that 
Arafat was to blame for the delay in implementing Palestinian 
autonomy. 
  "Israel did not suspend the negotiations after the car-bomb 
attack in Afula unlike Yasir 'Arafat did after the Hebron 
massacre," Rabin told state radio. 
  "That is why we are not to blame for the loss of time in the 
negotiations," he said, after the Palestinians expressed 
exasperation at the failure to launch autonomy on time. 
  Sha'th added that the committee negotiating the transfer of 
civilian matters had on Sunday decided on all the agenda items 
under discussion, except for the thorny issue of water resources.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat by </F>
correspondent del Campo in Tunis on 8 April] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Returning to the international news 
again, we go to Tunisia where the headquarters of the PLO is. 
There, barely an hour ago, a Radio Nacional de Espana special 
correspondent was able to interview the Palestinian leader Yasir 
'Arafat at a crucial moment for the history of the Middle East, 
following the recent explosions of violence, threatening the 
whole peace process. Gloria del Campo is in Tunisia. Good 
evening. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent del Campo] Good evening. I have to say at the 
outset that the interview was with a group of 14 European and 
Japanese journalists, on a mission organized by the United 
Nations to get to know at first hand the Palestinian problem. 
This year, Radio Nacional de Espana represents Spain on this 
mission. 
  Yasir 'Arafat was really pessimistic about the immediate 
application of Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, which 
was to have begun on 13 April, and he insistently accused Israel 
of maneuvering in order not to begin this autonomy. This is 
Yasir 'Arafat: 
  [Begin 'Arafat recording, in English fading into Spanish 
translation] It is not the first maneuvering. If it is the 
first manoeuvring, OK, we can let it go. [end recording] 
  [Del Campo] 'Arafat said that this was not the first 
maneuvering by Israel, but if it was the first they could let it 
go. But 'Arafat, who, incidently, looked very tired -- he had 
just returned from Cairo where the negotiations between Israel 
and the Palestinians are being held -- stressed that Israel has 
suspended the negotiations in Cairo from Wednesday to Sunday 
under the formal pretext of the celebration of the day of the 
Jewish holocaust, but he emphasized that in contrast they have 
not suspended for the same reason the negotations being held in 
Paris with the Palestinians and Israelis on economic issues. 
  Thus, 'Arafat said, the date of 13 April, when, as I was 
saying, Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho was to begin, 
is not going to be met -- in line, incidently, with the 
statements made by the Israeli foreign minister who gives as the 
probable date the end of the month. 
  'Arafat says that after 13 April he will convene the 
Palestinian leadership here in Tunisia to study what is to be 
done and in addition he called on the international community, 
the United States and Russia who are the co-sponsors of the 
Middle East peace process, and also the European Union and 
Japan, to help to resolve this impasse in the negotiations. 
That is all for now. 
  [Announcer] Those were the views expressed less than an hour 
ago by Yasir 'Arafat.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video with Japanese subtitles on </F>
NHK "exclusive" interview with PLO Chairman 'Arafat by NHK 
correspondent Norikazu Hashimoto in Tunis on 8 April; from the 
"NHK News" program -- 'Arafat's remarks processed from English] 
  [Text] Negotiations on the establishment of Palestinian 
self-rule have been deadlocked over a month following the 
slaughter of Palestinians in Israeli-occupied Hebron in 
February. In connection with this, PLO Chairman 'Arafat 
strongly expressed dissatisfaction with the Israeli Government's 
attitude because it is most likely that the withdrawal of the 
Israeli forces will not meet the deadline of 13 April. 
  He made the following remarks in an exclusive interview with 
a NHK reporter accompanying the United Nations' news gathering 
team for Middle Eastern affairs in the evening of 8 April, which 
is the morning of 9 April in Japan. 
  [Begin 'Arafat recording] This means that he [not further 
identified] forgets everything concerning the 13th of April. 
For how long they will continue maneuvering? But I am sorry to 
say that they are continuing their maneuvering to prevent the 
implementation of what had been signed in the White House last 
September. This continuous delay from the Israeli side... 
[pauses] giving the chance for all the extremists from the two 
sides to damage the peace process. And because of this delay, 
our people have lost their candid... [corrects himself], have 
lost their confidence with this peace accord. [end recording] 
  Moreover, PLO Chairman 'Arafat disclosed that to provide a 
breakthrough in such a deadlocked situation, ha has asked for 
cooperation of the nations which are involved in the peace 
talks, including the United States and Russia. 
  [Begin Hashimoto recording] Chairman 'Arafat repeatedly used 
the phrase "the delay by Israeli maneuvering," thus strongly 
criticizing Israel. But it can be said that his remarks reflect 
the Palestinians' irritation and sense of crisis because 
progress -- such as the withdrawal of the Israeli forces -- in 
peace talks has not been clearly seen despite the agreement last 
September on launching negotiations on establishing Palestinian 
self-rule. Digesting schedules one by one toward establishing 
the self-rule government will not only lead to promoting mutual 
trust but also give impetus toward achieving peace. For that 
reason, PLO Chairman 'Arafat is increasingly irritated at the 
continuous delay. [end recording]

  [Text] Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has strongly 
criticized Israeli maneuvers in the peace talks and its 
disregard for the timetables which had been agreed in accordance 
with the declaration of principles signed between the two sides 
on 13 September last. 
  He warned of the dangerous results which could ensue from 
these maneuvers. 
  The Palestinian president expressed this stance when he 
received in Tunis the delegation of the enquiry commission 
representing journalists accredited to the United Nations from 
various countries, which is touring the Middle East.

rehabilitate the Palestinian economy and infrastructure, which 
has been destroyed by the Israelis. Qaddumi was speaking at a

Qaddumi reached agreements with top Vietnamese officials about 
economic cooperation. Vietnam, he added, can help in the area 
of technical expertise and personnel training. 
  Asked to evaluate the chances of the ongoing talks between 
Palestinians and Israelis in Cairo, brother Qaddumi said he was 
neither optimistic nor pessimistic. Calling the talks tough, he 
said the Israelis are delaying [words indistinct] withdrawal 
from the occupied Palestinian territories.

  [Text] Cairo, April 9 (AFP) -- Senior PLO official Mahmud 
'Abbas arrived Saturday in Cairo to add impetus to the 
negotiations with Israel on the launch of self-rule in Gaza and 
Jericho, Palestinian sources said. 
  The sources said 'Abbas, also known as Abu-Mazin, was to 
meet 
Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa as part of efforts to clear 
the obstacles. 'Abbas was a signatory to the September 13 
PLO-Israeli autonomy accord. 
  The PLO executive committee member will stay on in the 
Egyptian capital for the negotiations due to resume here on 
Sunday. 
  He will work to keep an April 13 target for the Israeli army 
to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho, 
to be replaced by a Palestinian police force. 
  The PLO accuses Israel of placing obstacles in the way of 
applying the autonomy accord, which originally was to have been 
launched on December 13. 
  'Abbas was also expected to meet delegates of an 
international observer force to be deployed in the mosque 
massacre town of Hebron, under a March 31 agreement with Israel, 
the sources added. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel last 
Wednesday adjourned negotiations to finalize a deal on an 
Israeli withdrawal. 
  The talks have snagged on a PLO demand that Israel set a 
date 
for the withdrawal before an advance party goes to the 
territories to prepare the ground for the Palestinian police.

  [Text] Cairo, AL-HAYAH -- PLO Executive Committee member 
Jamal al-Surani has said the Palestinian-Israeli Cairo talks on 
implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement will not lead to an 
honest implementation of the Declaration of Principles [DOP]. 
  Al-Surani regretted that the Palestinian negotiator did not 
ask what had become of the original Palestine that was divided 
by Resolution 181. 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH, he added that the Palestinian 
negotiator may get Gaza and the West Bank, a half or a quarter 
of it, and he may get nothing. This is because the United 
States and Israel have a special interpretation of Resolution 
242. They consider that Jerusalem is not an occupied city, that 
the occupied territories are not Palestinian but disputed 
territories, and they view settlements as legitimate. 
  He added: What is going on is not negotiations or peace 
because the crux of the Palestine question, which is the problem 
of refugees was excluded from the Madrid conference. 
  On the Syrian criticism that the Palestinian leadership 
separated the Palestinian-Israeli track from other tracks, 
al-Surani said: Syria has the right to say this, but it has no 
right to separate itself from the Palestine question. When 
Syrian Foreign minister Faruq al-Shar' criticized the 
Palestinian leadership he did so out of pain and bitterness, and 
his objective is the restoration of coordination and not to say 
goodbye to the Palestinians. 
  Al-Surani said: Regrettably, the Palestinian leadership is 
committing the mistake of acting unilaterally, and it should 
reconsider this situation.

<F P=106> [Report by Husayn 'Abd-al-Ghani in Muscat] </F>
  [Text] AL-HAYAH has learned that water experts have held a 
meeting in Muscat. The meeting, which was kept secret by the 
Omani authorities, ended yesterday. 
  Diplomatic sources said that the participation of Israeli 
experts in an official meeting in an Arab country in the Gulf 
for the first time since the establishment of the Jewish state 
was behind the restricted reporting on the meeting. 
  The same sources added that experts from Oman, the United 
Kingdom, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and other 
countries attended the two-day meeting which was sponsored by 
the Omani Foreign Ministry. 
  The discussions dealt with the Omani experiment regarding 
the 
desalination of sea water and a study prepared by the Omanis to 
be presented to the meeting of the water committee affiliated 
with the Middle East peace conference which will be held in 
Muscat on 27 April. 
  The conferees reviewed the four five-year plans implemented 
in Oman in terms of building and developing water desalination 
stations, particularly the major water desalination plant in al- 
Ghabrah in the area of the capital, in which hundreds of 
millions of dollars are invested and which is the main source of 
drinking water for residents of the capital. 
  It appears that the need for further studies, researches, 
and 
working papers emerged during the meeting to crystallize Omani 
and Gulf concern for developing water desalination technology 
and reducing high economic costs.

  [Text] India has cautioned the United States against 
triggering of an arms race in the subcontinent by supplying 
sophisticated aircraft to Pakistan. The Indian side told the 
U.S. deputy secretary of State, Mr. Strobe Talbott, that any 
supply of F-16 aircraft to Islamabad will compel New Delhi to 
take measures in response. This will diversify the much-needed 
resources for the welfare of the people and affect the ongoing 
economic reforms. It was emphatically stated at the talks that 
the U.S. move is of great concern to New Delhi. The Indian side 
said in the public mind there is a U.S. tilt toward Pakistan 
seen as the replay of the cold war attitude. It said that Jammu 
and Kashmir is an integral part of India and territorial 
integrity will not be sacrificed at any cost. On nuclear 
nonproliferation and disarmament, India backs the 1988 action 
plan announced by Rajiv Gandhi which offers several initiatives 
for achieving the goal. On the Washington-backed Pakistan 
proposal for a multilateral fora for nonproliferation, India and 
the U.S. agreed to continue the dialogue on the concept. 
  Mr. Talbott had an hour-long meeting with the prime minister 
today. Mr. Narasimha Rao has accepted in principle President 
Clinton's invitation to visit the United States. The dates of 
the visit will be worked out later by the two sides. 
  Addressing a press conference, Mr. Talbott ruled out supply 
of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan, if Islamabad does not agree to a 
verifiable cap on its nuclear weapons program. He said nuclear 
proliferation is a major issue which needs to be addressed 
immediately. He said the U.S. favors expansion of the UN 
Security Council and India being the largest democracy is a 
clear leader to (?claim) a position in the council. 
  Mr. Talbott has since reached Islamabad on a three-day visit 
to Pakistan.

  [Text] India's ambassador to the United States, Mr. 
Siddhartha Shankar Ray, says that Pakistan continues to 
interfere in the internal affairs of India. He said he has 
collected evidence of this during his two-day visit to Jammu and 
Kashmir. Mr. Ray was talking to newspersons in New Delhi. He 
said the evidence collected relates to the foreign mercenaries 
in Kashmir, foreign arms and ammunition seized, and the location 
of camps where the Pakistan authorities have been training 
terrorists. The ambassador said approximately 44,000 Hindus, 
Sikh, and Muslim families have fled the valley because of the 
militant activities. 
  Mr. Ray said the delivery of more F-16 aircraft to Islamabad 
by Washington will not reduce tension in South Asia nor will it 
promote any dialogue between India and Pakistan. He warned the 
United States that if it does not desist from this course, the 
arms race in the subcontinent will be fueled.

has asserted that India will not succumb to pressure from any 
country to slow down its missile development program. Talking 
to newsmen in Madras today, he said that Prithvi 
[surface-to-surface missile] has been successfully tested and it 
is for the technical experts to decide about its induction into 
the armed forces. 
  Mr. Mallikarjun also expressed concern over the possibility 
of a military imbalance in the region if Washington supplies 
F-16 jets to Pakistan.

  [Text] Top Kashmiri leaders met the prime minister in New 
Delhi last night in a bid to remove bottlenecks impeding the 
political process in the state. The minister of state for home, 
Mr. Rajesh Pilot; the former state chief minister, Dr. Farooq 
Abdullah; the pradesh [state] Congress-I chief, Mr. Ghulam 
Rasool Kar, met Mr. Narasimha Rao soon after their arrival in 
the capital from Srinagar yesterday evening. The Jammu and 
Kashmir governor, General Krishna Rao, who also arrived in New 
Delhi yesterday, is likely to meet the prime minister and other 
central leaders today to apprise them of the situation in the 
state. 
  [Hong Kong AFP in English 1832 GMT on 8 Apr in a New 
Delhi-datelined report adds: `An umbrella group of Kashmiri 
Moslems Friday said it was ready for talks to end the separatist 
violence in the Indian state, where 11 people were killed the 
past few days. 
  `The All Party Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference said it had 
come 
to New Delhi on "an important mission" and was prepared for 
negotiations "without reservation and without prejudice." 
  `Four leaders of the Conference, which includes nearly 30 
groups sympathetic to the Moslem separatist campaign in Kashmir, 
arrived here on their way to Vienna for a meeting between 
Kashmiri leaders of India and Pakistan. 
  `The Conference officials said the release of Kashmiris from 
Indian prisons would "create the right atmosphere for holding a 
free and frank dialogue." 
  `It was not clear whether the leaders would meet with 
government officials here. 
  `The Hurriyat Conference has previously refused to accept 
anything short of independence for Kashmir, a picturesque state 
whose ownership is bitterly contested by arch foes India and 
Pakistan. 
  `On Friday, the Hurriyat Conference leaders held a 
closed-door meeting here with Karan Singh, son of the former 
Hindu king of Kashmir state who agreed to the Indian union in 
1948. 
  `"We exchanged ideas and shared perceptions" with Karan 
Singh, Conference spokesman Maulvi Abbas Ansari said. "Karan 
Singh does owe a duty to the people of Kashmir ... as a genuine 
and forthright seer in politics." 
  `Karan Singh told reporters that the visit of the Moslem 
leaders to the Indian capital was a positive sign. "It shows 
they have realised the importance of negotiations and this 
implies violence cannot solve problems."']

  [Text] In occupied Kashmir, Indian troops continued their 
repressive measures killing and wounding a number of people in 
ruthless military crack down in Srinagar, Baramula, Kupwara, and 
Pulwama. Several innocent civilians were also arrested. In 
all, 10 people were killed in random firing by Indian soldiers 
who also killed six people in indiscriminate firing in Srinagar. 
Mojahedin in retaliatory attacks killed nine soldiers. They 
carried out rocket attack on a battalion headquarters at 
(Manjakot) in Rajouri area killing six Indian soldiers. The 
building of the Battalion headquarters was badly damaged. 
Mojahedin killed another two soldiers when they opened fire on 
rampaging troops during siege and search operations in Pulwama. 
  The leader of the All Parties Hurriyat [Freedom] Conference 
in occupied Kashmir has described the last session of the UN 
Human Rights Commission in Geneva as a great victory for the 
Kashmiri people as Pakistan was able to internationalize the 
Kashmir issue. The Kashmiri leaders, who had come to the Indian 
capital to apprise the U.S. deputy secretary of state and 
members of his delegation about the ground realities in occupied 
Kashmir, rejected India's claim that the deferment of the 
resolution on Kashmir at the human rights conference in Geneva 
was a severe jolt to the Kashmiri movement. In an interview, 
the Hurriyat leaders Professor Abdul Ghani, Justice retired 
Mufti Bahuddin Farooqi, Mr. G.M. Bhatt, Maulavi Abbas Ansari, 
and Mr. G.N. Shahin said top priority for the Kashmiri people is 
to get rid of the yoke of Indian slavery. They praised Pakistan 
for internationalizing the Kashmir problem, saying it was a 
great achievement as Kashmiri people could not do so in Geneva 
without Pakistan. The Hurriyat leaders praised Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto's government for its stand on Kashmir and hoped Pakistan 
would continue its diplomatic, political, and moral support to 
the Kashmiri people.

  [Text] The Jammu and Kashmir governor, General Krishna 
Rao, met the prime minister and the home minister in New Delhi. 
He is understood to have discussed with them measures to 
improve the situation in the state. 
  In Kashmir valley, militants shot dead a former MLA [member 
of legislative assembly], Mr. Ghulam Qadir Mir, last evening at 
his residence at village (Uran) in Pulwama District. An 
associate of late Sheikh Abdullah, Mir is the 11th former 
legislator to be killed by militants in the last four years. 
Meanwhile, two militants have been killed and 16 arrested 
during the last 24 hours. A large quantity of arms and 
ammunition was recovered from them. 
  The Indian ambassador to the United States, Mr. Sidhartha 
Shanker Ray, has said the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to 
India is legal, final, and irrevocable. He said there can be no 
compromise on the matter. Addressing the members of the Jammu 
Bar Association, Mr. Ray said the seizure of over 10,000 weapons 
supplied by Pakistan and the capture of foreign mercenaries is 
clear evidence of Islamabad's continuing support to the 
militants. He said the U.S. Administration is fully aware of 
Islamabad's direct involvement in terrorist activities.

groups this year to gain supremacy in the Pak-sponsored militant

  [Text] New Delhi, 18 March -- Prime Minister P.V. 
Narasimha Rao will visit the United States in May to resolve the 
complexities in Indo-U.S. ties centering on the Kashmir issue 
and the nuclear nonproliferation treaty by holding summit-level 
talks. The Indian ambassador to the United States, Mr. 
Sidharata Shankar Ray, will arrive in New Delhi on 2 April to 
finalize the date for Rao's visit. Earlier, Indian officials 
held that it would not be proper for Rao to visit Washington as 
the Clinton administration was exerting too much pressure on the 
Kashmir and Punjab issues. These officials gained confidence 
after the defeat of the Pakistan-sponsored resolution on Kashmir 
in Geneva and advised Rao to go ahead with his proposed trip to 
the U.S. 
  Apart from exerting pressure on India on the human rights 
situation in Kashmir, the Clinton administration is also raising 
the Punjab issue which New Delhi no longer acknowledges is a 
problem. President Clinton is doing things that have not been 
done by the former U.S. presidents. He is responding to letters 
written by any Sikh militant and has already replied to the 
letters from two of them. Washington is also pressuring New 
Delhi to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and all these 
have become a cause of headache for India. 
  New Delhi's ties with the Democratic Bush administration was 
very cordial but it is not the same with the Clinton 
administration. India did not expect Clinton to become the 
President. India cannot match even somewhat the intense 
Pakistani propaganda in Washington; and the favorite issue is 
human rights for the Democratic senators, who regularly raise a 
hue and cry over the human rights situation in Kashmir, China, 
Iran, and other countries. This issue is the main obstacle that 
has prevented the United States from granting the most favored 
nations status to China. Hence, there is no reason to believe 
they will easily stop raising the human rights question in 
Kashmir. 
  There has been a diplomatic victory in Geneva, but the 
United 
States did not support any side. Indian officials believe that 
had America exerted pressure, it would not have been necessary 
for China or Iran to appear in the field. In that case, 
Pakistan would not have gone so far. The U.S. silence over this 
issue is a cause of worry for India. Solarz is not willing to 
become the U.S. ambassador to India due to pressure from the 
Clinton administration, causing a great setback for India. It 
is well-known that Solarz has a soft spot for India. Under 
these circumstances, the Indian officials feel that Rao should 
go to Washington to express India's feelings. They are 
confident that the talks between President Clinton and Rao would 
be successful like the latter's earlier talks with the British 
prime minister, John Major, and the German chancellor, Helmut 
Kohl. It is for this reason that the Indian ambassador to 
Washington, Sidharta Shankar Ray, has been summoned to New Delhi. 
  Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department has again commented on 
the human rights situation in India. This time the concern has 
been voiced not by Robin Raphel but the Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher before the subcommittee of the U.S. House of 
Representatives over the situation in Punjab and Kashmir. 
According to reports from Washington, in reply to Democratic 
Congressman James P. Moran, Christopher said a clear difference 
of opinion exists between New Delhi and Washington on the two 
issues of human rights and nuclear nonproliferation. He said, 
"In fact, concern over the human rights situation in Kashmir and 
Punjab has not yet been allayed." Christopher also did not 
hesitate to praise India. In his words "the United States has 
traditional and friendly ties with India. We want that this 
relationship to strengthen further. We have very high opinion of 
India. Unlike other friendly countries, U.S.-India ties are not 
totally free of problems. The two spheres where difference of 
opinion exists is human rights and nuclear nonproliferation." 
  The U.S. Secretary of State is confused over India's nuclear 
programs. Referring to India's first underground nuclear test 
in 1974, Christopher said India might have acquired nuclear 
capability in the meantime. This is also applicable in the case 
of Pakistan. The U.S. wants nuclear research programs conducted 
by these two countries for military purposes to be kept within a 
certain limit. Christopher evaded the question on why the ban 
that has been imposed against Pakistan under the Pressler 
Amendment has not been imposed on India also. However, he said 
he would reply to this question later. 
  The complexities regarding the appointment of the U.S. 
ambassador to India has increased. Solarz who had been 
identified as the next U.S. ambassador to India has stepped 
aside realizing the attitude of Clinton administration 
officials. Solarz became aware of this attitude after he held 
talks with the U.S. vice president, Albert Gore, last Thursday 
[10 March] and earlier with the national security adviser, 
Anthony Lake, and his assistant, Sandy Berger. These three 
people hinted to Solarz that his chances of being nominated as 
ambassador were thin. Solarz later withdraw his candidacy. 
  Experts believe that despite the great publicity that Solarz 
did not get the ambassador's job because he is very sympathetic 
to India. Recently, Warren Christopher, announced that Solarz 
would be made ambassador to India. He added that the 
announcement of his appointment had been delayed due to 
procedural formalities. Earlier, Solarz had been accused for his 
alleged involvement in providing visa to a Hong Kong 
businessman. Later, he was acquitted of the charge after an FBI 
inquiry. 
  The middle-level officials of the U.S. State Department are 
against the appointment of Solarz as ambassador as he is close 
to President Clinton.

<F P=106> [Report by Gerhard Bitzan: "Klestil Disappointed With </F>
Syria's Middle East Position] 
  [Excerpts] The Austrian blue helmets on the Golan Heights 
and Syria's role in the Middle East process: These topics 
dominated President Thomas Klestil's state visit to Damascus 
during the weekend. 
  After his talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, Klestil 
indicated that he was disappointed with his position on the 
peace process. "While I was optimistic after my last visit to 
Cairo and the talks there with Mubarak, 'Arafat, and Peres, this 
has since changed." Al-Asad is a realist and he does not expect 
a breakthrough in Israel's peace negotiations with the PLO, he 
said. 
  The return of the Golan Heights is indispensable for Syria; 
at the same time, Damascus strictly opposes secret negotiations 
with Israel and distrusts its desire for peace, Klestil 
reported. He also quoted the Syrians' wish that Austria 
continue the tradition of Kreisky and Waldheim and commit itself 
more in the Middle East. 
  Foreign Minister Mock, who accompanied the president, 
stressed that Austria still plays an important role for the 
region: For example, Vienna was asked in connection with the 
secret negotiations between the PLO and Israel, but finally Oslo 
was chosen as the place for the talks. "Our newspapers would 
immediately have reported on it," Klestil said with a smile. 
  Al-Asad paid tribute to the role of the Austrian blue 
helmets. Should an agreement be achieved between Israel and 
Syria after all, Austria could provide additional troops to 
monitor a demilitarized zone, Klestil suggested. The Austrians 
are experienced in the region, so he can also envisage that the 
government in Vienna would agree to it, he said. 
  On Sunday Klestil was able to satisfy himself of the present 
situation on Golan. [passage omitted] 
  About 460 Austrian blue helmets, who received the visitor 
enthusiastically, are currently stationed in Syria. [passage 
omitted] 
  Despite all the benevolence that was shown to Austria in 
Damascus, economic relations are not developing as desired. 
There are several projects, above all in the sectors of energy 
and medicine, but many have not been concluded because of 
unclear financial questions. Experts in tourism were also part 
of the small economic delegation as there is increasing demand 
for Syria as a tourist destination, but the infrastructure is 
not yet developed well. 
  Today, Monday, the president will travel to Jordan for his 
next state visit. Foreign Minister Mock returned to Vienna on 
Sunday. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: In the wake of the Palestinian 
resistance martyrdom operation in 'Afula, where eight Israelis 
were killed and scores of others were wounded, Israel clamped a 
military siege on Arab citizens in the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. It raised a premeditated hue and cry over the 
'Afula operation in order to cover up two serious crimes it 
recently committed: The holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the 
subsequent Israeli Army killings, and the Zionist special 
forces' execution of six Palestinians in the Jabaliya camp. The 
latter was described by world circles at the time as the most 
serious violation of human rights in the occupied Arab 
territories. Israel also imposed a military siege on our people 
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip under the pretext of providing 
security to its Jewish inhabitants. 
  Security, as all know, cannot be provided under occupation. 
If Israel was really concerned about security, it would have 
accepted the Security Council resolutions governing the peace 
process and it would have negotiated on that basis in a way that 
leads to the withdrawal of its forces and settlers from occupied 
Arab territory and to the establishment of an independent 
Palestinian state where people can live a free and honorable 
life. But Israel does not want to withdraw from the occupied 
territories. The flimsy security pretext it uses to confront 
the world will not stand up to the test. The Israeli occupation 
is a source of danger to the Israelis themselves and the very 
reason of the lack of security. The more the occupation steps 
up its bestial acts, the more resistance escalates and violence 
aggravates. 
  The Arabs have taken part in the Madrid conference and 
presented objective proposals in the Washington talks for the 
sake of establishing a real, just, and comprehensive peace 
because only a just and comprehensive peace based on the 
international community resolutions, charters, and principles 
can provide security and stability in the region and end the 
cycle of violence. Instead of responding to Arab proposals, 
particularly the Syrian ones, Israel continued its maneuvers and 
prevarications in a bid to avoid the principles on which the 
peace process was based. These principles are land for peace, 
namely, full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab 
territories as stipulated by the UN resolutions. 
  The Israeli rulers refuse to admit facts. They turn a blind 
eye to developments and try to delude themselves into believing 
that it is possible to achieve peace through the continuation of 
occupation. If they think so, they will undoubtedly reap further 
bitter fruit. Peace and occupation cannot coexist. There can be 
no peace in the Middle East without full Israeli withdrawal from 
all the occupied territories and without the realization of the 
Palestinian people's real hopes and aspirations, led by freedom, 
dignity, and self- determination. 
  Only a just and comprehensive peace can provide security and 
stability. A just and comprehensive peace should be based on 
specific international resolutions that should be implemented in 
full and lead to Israel's withdrawal from every inch of the 
occupied territories. Otherwise, not one Israeli will enjoy 
peace or security.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] In its editorial today under the headline "Separate 
Deals Do Not Make Peace," the newspaper TISHRIN writes on the 
Israeli practices regarding the peace process in the Middle 
East. TISHRIN says: When Israel goes too far in its insistence 
on separate deals, it proves that it does not want peace. 
Neither does it want the region to enjoy stability and 
tranquility. Israel's proposals of separate deals and 
settlements have become an indivisible part of its true 
objective of evading a just and comprehensive peace. It is 
simply a part of its maneuverings and deception to circumvent 
the Madrid conference's bases and its objective and true formula. 
  TISHRIN adds: The escalation of confrontations in the 
occupied Arab territories is a natural result of the Israeli 
policy based on peddling separate deals. Its weapons in this is 
the Oslo agreement. After signing this agreement on 13 September 
1993, Israel was able to drag the Palestinian side into making 
further concessions and into relinquishing Palestinian rights. 
Israel used this agreement as a pretext to continue its 
terroristic and oppressive measures, and to perpetrate massacres 
against the sons of our people in the occupied Arab territories. 
  TISHRIN holds Israel responsible for the escalation of acts 
of violence in the occupied Arab territories. It says: This 
violence began in a form of terrorism, oppression, repression, 
and killing at the hands of the Israelis and their brutal and 
fascist practices against the Palestinian people. These 
practices have become even more rancorous since the signing of 
the Oslo agreement. They continued in a form of sporadic 
massacres, the biggest of which were the holy Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre and the Jabaliya massacre. 
  TISHRIN adds: All developments indicate that the occupation 
troops, the settlers, and the Israeli terrorist organizations 
threaten to perpetrate new massacres in other places in the 
occupied Arab territories similar to the Hebron massacre. 
  TISHRIN notes that by all standards, Israel's terrorism is 
the source of tension and disturbances in the occupied 
territories and the region. Had Israel been really and truly 
serious about the stability of the situation, it would have 
responded to the requirements of the just and comprehensive 
peace, first and foremost showing readiness to withdraw from the 
occupied Arab territories, recognizing the Madrid formula, and 
implementing it in letter and spirit, especially since it is 
based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the 
principle of land for peace. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: The comprehensiveness of the 
solution, a return to the Madrid bases, the end of the Israeli 
occupation, and the renounciation of separate deals will 
contribute to achieving a true and just peace. 
  In an article under the headline "Peace and Occupation 
Cannot 
Go Together," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH also writes on the 
situation in the occupied Arab territories. It stresses that 
the Israeli occupation troops exploited the comprehensive 
military cordon around the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to 
launch an arrest campaign that has affected some 500 
Palestinians on the pretext that they do not have Israeli work 
permits. 
  AL-THAWRAH says: It is no secret to anyone that the clamor 
the Israelis have been creating since the resistance operation 
in 'Afula, including the imposition of a comprehensive military 
cordon around the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, is 
fabricated and aimed at diverting interest from the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which was perpetrated by the Zionist 
settlers through support from the Israeli occupation forces. 
This clamor has also come in the wake of the crime Israel has 
committed by blowing up the Sayyidat al-Najat Church near 
Beirut, and later the crime which was perpetrated by the 
occupation soldiers themselves at the Jabaliya camp a week ago. 
  AL-THAWRAH says: The Israelis will be making another grave 
mistake if they think or imagine--after all that has happened 
and is happening with acts of resistance and confrontations 
carried out by the Arabs against the Israeli occupation forces 
and settlers in the occupied Arab territories--that they can go 
ahead with the peace process in the Middle East and push it 
toward its specified objective of establishing a just and 
comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the 
Palestine question while they insist on the continued presence 
of the occupation troops and settlers in the occupied Arab 
territories. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: The international community, 
particularly the Middle East peace cosponsors, especially the 
United States, which assumes the responsibility of a full 
partner and an honest broker in the bilateral talks, must tell 
Israel loudly and clearly that the just and comprehensive 
solution to the region's crisis for which the Arabs, 
particularly Syria, are calling for, must guarantee the 
withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces, the departure of 
the Zionist settlers from all the occupied Arab territories, and 
the restoration of the Palestinian people's natural rights. 
Only this solution can bring security and stability to the 
entire region.

  [Text] Gentlemen: After imposing a military siege on the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Israeli Government 
decided to do without the Palestinian work force and bring in 
foreign labor from outside. It is noteworthy that nearly 
100,000 Palestinians worked in various Israeli economic 
installations, especially in tedious fields of work, in return 
for low wages that are not tantamount to the Israelis' wages. 
  Officials in Rabin's government hinted that these measures 
reflect the accelerating deterioration of security conditions 
and the impossibility of coexistence between Palestinians and 
Israelis. Many believed that this reality could prompt Rabin's 
government to continue on the road to a sound peace. However, 
this has not happened. Closing the occupied territories is a 
clear admission that Israel's previous proposals have failed, 
that the agreements it concluded with the Palestinian side did 
not change anything on the ground, and that tension could 
increase. 
  Israeli officials are fully aware that the occupation 
contradicts peace and security and that the Oslo agreement and 
the following agreements and arrangements did not meet the 
minimum demands and ambitions of the Palestinian people. 
  These agreements retained the settlers and the settlements, 
thus keeping the Palestinians in danger. The settlers are 
preparing for new massacres and are not hiding this fact. It is 
natural for the Palestinians to defend themselves and to raise 
their voices to demand real freedom and dignity. Indeed, there 
can be no freedom and dignity with the continuation of the 
occupation and settlements. There can be no freedom and dignity 
under an administrative rule in which the final say is for the 
occupying authority. Moreover, this contradicts the UN Security 
Council's resolutions that stipulate a full Israeli withdrawal 
and the removal of the settlements. 
  If, according to its officials, Israel is first concerned 
about Israelis' security, then the separate Oslo agreement will 
never achieve security for Israel. This is because occupation 
contradicts security and the Oslo agreement did not remove the 
occupation and the settlements. 
  A real, just, and comprehensive peace that uproots 
oppression 
and removes all manifestations of occupation and coercion is the 
only peace that can achieve security. Israel is building new 
walls and high racist barriers by imposing a siege on the 
Palestinian people, by turning the occupied territories into a 
detention center, and by ordering its army to raid houses and 
districts and arrest Arab citizens in a manner that only means 
further security deterioration for Israel. Instead of doing 
this, Israel should confront the roots of the problem and admit 
facts and realities. It should accept the UN Security Council 
resolutions and adhere to the bases and requirements of a just 
and comprehensive peace. 
  Is it not appropriate for Israel to exchange land for peace 
and grant the Palestinian people freedom of self-determination? 
How long will Israel continue to disavow the UN resolutions and 
ignore the fact that the Palestinian people cannot remain the 
prisoners of its tools of repression, that is, its soldiers, 
policemen, and settlers. 
  If Israel is using the impossibility of coexistence and the 
absence of security as a justification for its new repressive 
measures, then why doesn't it withdraw from the occupied 
territories and grant the Palestinians their right to 
self-determination and allow them to build their own future? 
  Do Israeli officials think the struggling Palestinian people 
will submit for one moment to the schemes of occupation, 
Judaization, and settlements? Israel knows the answer, despite 
all its efforts to ignore it -- an answer confirmed by daily 
developments. Unless Israel submits to what developments 
dictate and admits that its first obligation, according to 
international legitimacy, is to withdraw and remove the 
settlements, then we do not think the blessings of peace will 
prevail over this region, which is plagued by the mentality of 
Zionist expansion, aggression, and hegemony.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Today's newspapers devote their commentaries to the 
military siege imposed by the Israeli occupation authorities on 
the occupied Arab territories, thus turning the occupied West 
Bank and Gaza into a closed detention camp. 
  Commenting on the Israeli acts of suppression against Arab 
citizens in the occupied Arab territories, TISHRIN says: The 
Israeli Cabinet has extended indefinitely the military siege 
imposed on the occupied Arab territories, amid circumstances 
asserting that the situation in the occupied territories is 
unbearable and that our people there are experiencing hell 
because of Israel's iron-fist policy and the scheme of 
collective punishment. 
  Some Israeli officials have acknowledged that the increase 
in 
the Israeli military and economic pressure on the occupied 
territories will definitely generate more violence and 
resistance. This will also starve the sons of our people in the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza. The policy of complete closure 
betrays total Israeli inability to face a growing, stepped-up 
Palestinian resistance. 
  TISHRIN adds: There is no doubt that the failure of the 
occupation to provide security to its settlers and forces is yet 
further evidence that Israel is incapable, whatever its methods 
and brutal, suppressive practices, of undermining the 
steadfastness of our people in the face of the Israeli war, 
aggression, and terrorism machine. 
  Israel has repeatedly resorted to such methods. This is not 
the first time the occupation authorities seal off the West Bank 
and Gaza and tighten the siege on them. What is strange, 
however, while observing the serious, explosive developments in 
the occupied territories, is the silence toward this situation 
and the indifference of some international capitals and 
political circles toward what is happening, despite its severity 
and seriousness. This is as if the fate of the Palestinian 
people does not deserve a word of justice against the Israeli 
occupier and as if threatening the very existence of this people 
no longer requires assuming urgent missions to save the life of 
the defenseless sons of Palestine, after the occupation has 
turned their life into unbearable hell because of the Israeli 
suppressive practices. 
  TISHRIN asserts that Israel takes lightly all human values 
and international laws and charters. The paper urges people 
with a living conscience who care about the stability and 
security of the West Bank and Gaza to come to the rescue of 
justice and humanity, lift the injustice and oppression against 
the Palestinian people, and protect its sons who are 
experiencing real massacres and a serious war of starvation. 
  AL-BA'TH comments on Israel's crimes in the occupied Arab 
territories that threaten peace opportunities. Israel has 
turned both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip into closed 
detention camps. It has imposed collective punishment on the 
people of Palestine, thus violating all international norms and 
charters and the Geneva Convention on the protection of human 
rights. 
  The paper asserts that the measures adopted by the 
occupation 
against our people in the occupied territories are not new. The 
record of the occupation is rife with the ugliest kinds of 
crimes. The enemy generals have acknowledged that they are 
fighting a true war in the West Bank and Gaza. 
  AL-BA'TH notes that Israel sheds tears over peace and tries 
to appear before the world as an advocate of peace. This 
approach toward world public opinion is no longer useful to the 
Rabin government, having unmasked its bloody face through a 
series of crimes carried out in the occupied territories in 
broad daylight and under the very gaze of the whole world. 
  Concluding, the paper calls on those who are making serious 
efforts for a just and comprehensive peace to put an end, once 
and for all, to Israel's crimes because spilling Arab blood does 
not serve the peace process, nor make it possible to achieve any 
step forward.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: It is clear that there has been no 
change in the Israeli position on how to deal with the peace 
process, while the U.S. position is still undecided, hesitating 
between following U.S. interests and complying with Israeli 
wishes. The idea of separate deals and secret talks still 
dominates Israeli thinking. Israel's talk about the 
comprehensiveness of negotiations is empty and meaningless. 
This being the situation, it takes us back to the same old 
question: What does resuming or not resuming the bilateral 
talks this month, or next month, or even after that, mean as 
long as nothing has changed in the Israeli way of thinking? 
Perhaps, counting on the U.S. stand to influence the Israeli 
position is not really in harmony with the current state of 
affairs. This is because Washington behaves toward the peace 
process from the position of someone influenced by the Israeli 
stand and not someone who influences that stand. For Israel, 
this is not new. However, what is new is that nothing has 
changed in the U.S. position, just as Israel and its strong 
lobbies in the United States have always wanted it. They want 
the United States to take Israel's side, not even allowing to 
play a neutral role. Neutrality, a balanced position, and the 
role of an honest broker are all unacceptable to Israel, because 
it cannot tolerate seeing Washington in a position that is not 
fully biased toward it, taking into consideration that it relies 
on the U.S. support for its aggressions against Arab land and 
rights. Throughout the Arab dealings with the U.S. peace 
initiative, it has become clear that every time there has been a 
difference between the U.S. position and the Israel position 
over the peace process, even though it may have been for 
considerable reasons in favor of Washington's position and in 
the interest of the peace process, the U.S. position did not 
take long to move back into line with the Tel Aviv rulers' 
position, even though it may have led to a setback in peace 
efforts. 
  Israel's game has been exposed. It is obvious that what it 
wants is to impose an Israeli peace through separate deals with 
each Arab party. It wants a peace that would allow it to 
maintain its military, security, economic, and political 
supremacy in order to eventually have a free hand to control 
this region after the establishment of this so-called peace. 
However, the question is really whether or not Washington is 
still committed to the role of an honest and neutral partner in 
the peace process. This question should be posed in light of 
Washington's pressure on the various Arab parties, through 
various means, forms, methods, and names, which all serve the 
Israeli position. What is really required of the United States 
is that it prove its honesty by pressuring the party that is 
obstructing the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in 
the region; namely, Israel. The importance of an answer to this 
question lies in the possibilities of the Arab parties returning 
to the Washington bilateral talks and the negotiating table at 
the end of this month. Will U.S. efforts actually include the 
signs of honesty that have long been awaited by the Arabs, or 
will the U.S. position continue to swing back and forth within 
the circle of Israeli influence?

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Iraqi Opposition Speaks of Suspect </F>
Iraqi Behavior"] 
  [Text] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Iraqi opposition 
is talking about suspect Iraqi internal and external 
developments. The "Free Iraqi Council," based in London, says 
that the Baghdad Government has leaked rumors claiming that Air 
Force Commander Staff Lieutenant General Muzahim Sa'b Hasan 
al-Tikriti is in Amman for medical reasons, but Arab diplomatic 
sources emphasize that he went to Amman on the direct orders of 
Iraqi President Saddam Husayn to supervise the building of 
"secret" air bases to be used when necessary and, in times of 
despair, for escape because he now fears a coup by the military 
commanders closest to him at any moment. 
  The "Council" also says that there is a mounting campaign of 
condemnation and denunciation in Sanaa and Aden because of the 
Saddam regime's increasing interference in the Yemeni crisis and 
fueling the fire there. It adds that a number of political 
figures and tribal chiefs and some sections of the press have 
expressed anger at the arrival of 20 Iraqi pilots in Sanaa and 
the payment of funds to some tribal chiefs and officers loyal to 
the Iraqi Ba'th party for the purpose of holding Western experts 
working in Yemen as hostages and assassinating supporters of 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and accusing the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP] leadership of doing that in retaliation for the 
assassination of its supporters for which elements loyal to 
President Salih were blamed. 
  A statement issued by the "Council," a copy of which has 
been 
received by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, says that, at the internal level, 
there is growing alarm among most Iraqi merchants, especially 
those who move between Baghdad and Amman, after the death of 
Iraqi businessman al-Hajj 'Abd-al-Latif Bunyah in a road 
accident as he was driving his car to Jordan. Accusing fingers 
have been pointed at the Iraqi intelligence services and aides 
of the Iraqi president's son 'Udayy. 
  It should be recalled that al-Hajj 'Abd-al-latif had loaned 
the Iraqi Government large sums of money and was in competition 
with 'Udayy for the control of the international Coca-Cola 
Company's agency. He also allegedly criticized the Iraqi 
Government's financial policy on more than one occasion.

  [Text] Amman, 8 April (AFP)--Bombs exploded 15 minutes 
apart near Iraqi ministries in Baghdad on Wednesday, an Iraqi 
group said here Friday without reporting casualties. 
  "An explosive device was placed at al-Nidal Street about 100 
meters (300 feet) from the Industry Ministry and another was 
placed near the agriculture and Irrigation Ministry," the Iraqi 
National Congress said in a statement. 
  "The two explosions caused panic among security services and 
coincided with the anniversary of the foundation of the ruling 
(Ba'th) party," said the statement dated from Sulaymaniyah and 
Kurdish-controlled norther Iraq. 
  It said the first occurred at 5:30 a.m. (0130 GMT) and the 
second at 5:45 a.m. (0145 GMT).

  [Text] According to opposition sources in the north, a bomb 
went off early this week at the main mosque in Irbil, causing no 
deaths. 
  A spokesman for the Kurdish Administration has blamed the 
regime of tyrant Saddam for this and other bombings that have 
occurred in northern Iraq. The spokesman said that the aim of 
these bombings is to undermine security and stability in 
northern Iraqi. The spokesman added that security organs in the 
area uncovered a number of subversive attempts planned by the 
regime's agents. The detained agents confessed that the 
authorities of the Ba'thist regime forced them to carry out 
these subversive acts and promised to reward them generously.

group of the Islamic resistance threw three hand grenades at the 
al-Nasiriyah governor's headquarters during his meeting with 
security and intelligence officials. The sources say the 
resulting explosion inflicted material damage on the building, 
wounded a number of its guards, and prompted the governor and 
the regime's henchmen to hide in an underground shelter. 
  In another development, the resistance dealt a destructive 
blow to the district officer's headquarters in al-Nasiriyah on 
the evening of 18 March. Various types of light and medium 
weapons and mortars were used. Our sources confirm that eight 
regime elements were killed and others wounded. Heavy damage 
was inflicted on the building, which the regime uses as a center 
for its mercenaries and criminals who monitor the citizens' 
movements and arrest them.

  [Text] Reports from Iraqi Kurdistan indicate that the 
regime of the tyrant Saddam is in the process of moving hundreds 
of tanks and armored vehicles, thousands of troops, and dozens 
of missiles with a range of 150 km [100 miles] to an area 
bordering Iraqi Kurdistan. The reports add that the regime plans 
to hold large-scale military maneuvers in this area. Military 
planes and helicopters are expected to take part in the drills. 
  According to our sources, 'Ali Hasan Majid, Saddam's defense 
minister and cousin, is in Mosul to supervise the deployment of 
the regime's forces and the military maneuvers.

  [Text] AL-RA'Y AL-'AMM has learned from exclusive sources 
that a ranking Iraqi officer who was very close to Saddam Husayn 
has defected to the United States through Turkey after doubts 
were cast on his role in the attempt to topple the regime that 
was discovered two months ago, following which a number of 
ranking military commanders were executed. 
  These sources said the officer had played a central role in 
preparing for the invasion of Kuwait, and was directly 
responsible for all cash payments and gifts that were given to 
top officials and a large number of journalists in some Arab 
countries in order to extend material and moral support for the 
Iraqi adventure against Kuwait. 
  AL-RA'Y AL-'AMM also learned that the Iraqi officer will 
hold a news conference soon to reveal in figures and names the 
huge sums of money the Iraqi regime had given to some political 
and military officials and journalists shortly before the 
treacherous invasion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf by </F>
radio correspondent Jayda'; place and date not given; from the 
"Today's Guest" program] 
  [Text] [Jayda'] We are pleased to meet with Iraqi Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf. 
  [Al-Sahhaf] I welcome you. 
  [Jayda'] [words indistinct] discussion of lifting the 
embargo from Iraq. To what extent has Iraq responded to the UN 
Security Council resolutions? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] Iraq has responded to the UN Security Council 
resolutions, particularly Resolution 687. This is documented in 
the UN Security Council records. That is why Iraq recently 
asked the UN Security Council in a letter signed by Deputy Prime 
Minister Tariq 'Aziz to fulfill its commitments and implement 
Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 which calls for lifting the 
economic embargo from Iraq. Within the Arab League framework, 
we are supported by the general secretariat and the secretary 
general to maintain the atmopshere that calls for lifting the 
embargo from Iraq and the Iraqi people. We did not submit a 
draft resolution to the Arab League Council because we do not 
want one, two, or three members to come out with harmful 
political objectives, thus showing that the Arabs disagree on 
Iraq's request. We remain satisfied with the general atmopshere 
of support provided by the Arab League secretary general. 
  [Jayda'] Your Excellency, what is the truth behind what is 
being reported on there being Kuwaiti prisoners in Iraq and what 
is Iraq's stand on this issue? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] There are no prisoners in Iraq. We [words 
indistinct] through the International Committee of the Red Cross 
[ICRC]. Others became aware that the issue is one of missing 
people. There are internationally acknowledged procedures and 
rules for following up the issue of missing people, not to 
mention that the ICRC also follows up such issues. In the 
aggression against Iraq, and during the crisis, there were 
missing people. One should search for them, and collect 
information about them. This takes time, and this is not the 
first time that this happens. In all crises, wars, and armed 
conflicts, people are reported missing. The search for them 
continues. As you know, the Americans are still following up 
the issue of those missing in action in Vietnman. This issue is 
similar to the other. They waged an all-out war against Iraq. 
One can say that it was a third world war against Iraq. There 
were victims in this war, and people were reported missing. The 
question is one of missing people. We cooperate in accordance 
with acknowledged procedures to collect any information we might 
obtain during our invesigation, and search to determine the fate 
of these missing people. There are also tens of thousands of 
Iraqis who are reported missing. We will also ask that searches 
be carried out, investigations conducted, and information 
collected on them. 
  [Jayda'] Your Excellency Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, what are 
the dimensions of the Iraq-Gulf relationship in light of opening 
channels with Qatar, Oman, and recently with Bahrain? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] These are the dimensions of an Arab relationship 
between two Arab countries. These are normal dimensions. Iraqi 
relations exist with our brothers in the Gulf, particularly with 
Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain. We seek to promote these relations. 
This is a joint effort and a common desire between us and our 
brothers in these three Arab countries. God willing, these 
normal relations with the brothers will witness broader scopes 
of cooperation and joint action. 
  [Jayda'] Mr. Minister, how does the Kurdish problem affect 
the domestic state of affairs in Iraq, and how true are the 
reports about foreign assistance? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] As a result of the U.S.-led imperialist game in 
northern Iraq, northern Iraq has become an arena for gangs, 
killings, and plundering. They are even stealing electricity 
poles and selling them in Iran. Therefore, great harm has been 
inflicted since 1991 when the U.S. and allied forces interfered 
in northern Iraq and supported gangs there. The harm done to 
the sons of our Kurdish people in Iraq is very great. There are 
epidemics there. Nothing is available there. People in northern 
Iraq are suffering greatly. There is no security. Killings and 
thefts are everywhere. This inflicts great harm on Iraq because 
that part of Iraq, northern Iraq, is a beloved part. It goes 
without saying that there are Arab parties -- we are not 
leveling accusations lightly but on the bases of facts and 
information -- which provide thse gangs with money and weapons. 
  [Jayda'] The question of Arab reconciliation was supposed 
to top the agenda of the meeting of Arab foreign ministers. 
What is Iraq's role in Arab reconciliation? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] You know that the Arab League secretary general 
has put forward an initiative for pan-Arab reconciliation. The 
initiative contains ideas and suggestions. The Arab League 
secretary general asked Arab states to make observations and 
comments on this initiative. As an Arab country that fully 
embraces pan-Arab action and joint Arab action, the initiative 
was given due attention. Thus, we studied it carefully and sent 
our observations to the secretary general. We criticized some 
paragraphs containing points which we thought were inaccurate 
and did not give the question its proper scope and should be 
developed to complete what was missing. On the other hand, we 
supported other paragraphs because we thought they were 
appropriate and correct. Therefore, we presented a mature, 
studied paper as a contribution from Iraq to the secretary 
general, upon his request, so that different views would lead to 
a feasible program that brings about pan-Arab reconciliation. 
  [Jayda'] Mr. Minister, what are the latest developments in 
the relations with the West, particularly Iraqi-French relations? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] You know that diplomatic relations with all 
European states, except Britain and France, remained in place. 
As for Britain and France, after agreeing with them, a section 
to look after interests was opened in their capitals. In turn, 
they have asked the embassies of some countries in Baghdad to 
look after their interests. Thus, relations continued to exist 
through this diplomatic channel. Relations in terms of trade, 
mutual interests, and the economy do not exist because of the 
Iraq embargo. However, I can characterize the relationship 
between Iraq and European nations as follows: Iraq's 
relationship with these countries, as reflected through 
companies, is a good relationship. Hundreds of European 
companies come to Baghdad. However, relations with governments 
exist only through an ordinary diplomatic channel and that is 
all. 
  [Jayda'] Are their any developments in French relations? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] Yes, regarding Iraqi-French relations, there has 
been a positive change in relations between the two countries, 
which was only natural because relations of cooperation and 
mutual interests between Iraq and France are broad and large and 
deserve careful consideration. The two countries have resumed 
coordination and activation of the previous relationship. We 
have covered a considerable distance in this regard, and the 
relationship between Iraq and France is now proceeding in the 
right direction. We hope it will continue along this road until 
it returns to its previous status, if not better. 
  [Jayda'] Mr. Minister, is Iraq willing to normalize 
relations with the United States? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] Even when the president of the United States was 
George Bush himself, who led the brute aggression against Iraq, 
we told the Americans we were willing to talk and to have an 
equal, serious dialogue. This proves that Iraq believes -- and 
we truly believe in this -- that dialogue is not to be held with 
one party alone, excluding others. As long as there are 
possible interests, we believe that the way to serve these 
interests is dialogue. We have no problem with that. We 
continue to call for dialogue, and if the same desire and 
political will are available for the other party, then there 
will be dialogue. This is a natural thing between all countries. 
  [Jayda'] To conclude this conversation, I would like to know 
your assessment of the Arab foreign minister conference in Cairo 
at the Arab League? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] This meeting did not address many substantive 
issues. There were several important issues on the agenda. 
However, these require further consideration and discussion to 
become mature enough and ready to make appropriate decisions on 
them. There were positive discussions that underline a mutual 
desire to see work develop within the Arab League and within 
other frameworks of joint Arab action. We think this approach 
should be promoted and supported to enable it to develop 
further. Regarding some hot issues, the Arab League, as you 
know, has adopted positive positions on these issues, such as 
the crime of the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque and 
support for the Palestinian people. There is active follow-up 
on economic issues. Credit here goes really to the activity of 
the Arab League secretary general and the General Secretariat of 
the Arab League. 
  [Jayda'] Thank you Mr. Minister. 
  [Al-Sahhaf] You are welcome.

  [Text] The National Assembly today held the first session 
of its spring term, which will last two months, under Assembly 
Speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih. 
  The session was started with a reading from the Opening 
Chapter of the Koran to evoke God's mercy on the souls of those 
who are nobler than all of us, namely, Iraq's righteous martyrs, 
who sacrificed their lives in defense of the nation's honor and 
dignity. 
  Then, Assembly Speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih delivered a speech 
reviewing the current Arab and international state of affairs in 
light of the U.S.-Atlantic-Zionist conspiracy that is targeting 
the Iraqi territories, people, and civilization. He said: What 
the United States is doing against the Iraqi people (?does not) 
reflect an arbitrary policy. Rather, this anti-Iraq U.S. 
conduct is the manifestation of an ingrained and deep-seated 
malice dwelling within the psyches of Zionist occupiers. 
  The National Assembly speaker urged Iraqis to double their 
efforts and make further sacrifices to thwart the imperialist 
conspiracy, which is targeting our homeland and nation. He 
added: We must be at the forefront of those advocating harmony, 
unity, solidarity, and affection so that we may bring about an 
awareness of the importance of unity, patriotism, and loyalty to 
the nation, whose values we must uphold. 
  Afterward, the Assembly members listened to a detailed 
report 
read out by Deputy Assembly Speaker Ghanim 'Aziz. The report 
addressed the activities recently carried out by the permanent 
Assembly committees in the political, parliamentary, economic, 
social, legal, health, service, and trade spheres.

  [Excerpt] Baghdad, 8 Apr (INA) -- 'Abd-al-Ghani 
'Abd-al-Ghafur, member of the Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist 
Ba'th Party, has returned to Baghdad after a visit of several 
days to Moscow, where he held talks with Russian Government 
officials and party leaders. 
  In an arrival statement to the Iraqi News Agency, 
'Abd-al-Ghafur said Russian party chiefs are impressed by the 
pace of Iraq's renewal, led by President Saddam Husayn, who has 
turned into a symbol of the fight against imperialist hegemony. 
  'Abd-al-Ghafur said he hoped that when the UN Security 
Council next reviews Iraq's compliance with Paragraph 22 of 
Resolution 687 calling for lifting the sanctions, Russia will 
adopt an even more postitive attitude. Iraq, he noted, had 
fulfilled the obligations stipulated by the council resolutions, 
unfair as they are. 
  Russian Government officials and party leaders emphasized 
that retention of the sanctions hurts not only the Iraqi people 
but Russia as well. They reiterated Russia's willingness to 
maintain excellent relations with Iraq, 'Abd-al-Ghafur added.

  [Text] Nicolas Rodriguez, under secretary of the Cuban 
Foreign Ministry, has said that the economic embargo Iraq is 
facing is the same embargo Cuba has been facing for 32 years. 
  In a statement to AL-THAWRAH, he said that the embargo is an 
expression of a tendency by the superpowers not to respect the 
will of peoples and nations seeking to achieve progress. He 
added that this embargo is beginning to show its negative 
effects on Iraq and Cuba. 
  Assessing Cuban-Iraqi relations, Rodriguez said: Relations 
between our two friendly countries, Cuba and Iraq, are 
deep-rooted and have been continuously developing in various 
fields. We believe that continuing the policy of reinforcing 
relations and improving cooperation between our peoples will 
serve the interests and objectives of both countries. We also 
believe that this cooperation is necessary, useful, and 
important, in light of the difficult circumstances our two 
countries are facing. 
  On the objective of his visit to Iraq and his talks with 
Iraqi officials, the Cuban guest said: My visit to Iraq is 
aimed at furthering cooperation and developing relations of 
friendship between our two countries and peoples, not just under 
the current circumstances, but also in the future. My visit is 
also aimed at getting a broader outlook on the circumstances our 
friends in Iraq are facing. At the same time, I hope to brief 
our friends on the situation in Cuba. 
  I was happy with the talks I held with our friends, the 
officials in Iraq. I was even happier to find that our friends, 
the Iraqi officials, understand the circumstances facing Cuba. 
My talks were brotherly and very fruitful.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Ahmad 'Abd-al-Majid from Baghdad] </F>
  [Text] Iraq will begin a broad diplomatic move in the 
international arena on 14 April. 
  This move, which takes advantage of the new situation 
manifested in the Security Council's periodic discussion of the 
economic blockade on Iraq, is aimed at explaining Baghdad's 
position on a number of issues, including its implementation of 
Security Council resolutions and its response to the resolution 
on long-term monitoring of weapons of mass destruction. The 
adverse effects on the people caused by the blockade in terms of 
food and medicine shortages will also be explained. 
  AL-DUSTUR learned from the Iraqi Foreign Ministry sources 
that a number of ministers, advisers, and diplomats will leave 
Baghdad simultaneously for a number of Arab and foreign 
capitals. Minister of Culture and Information Hamid Yusuf 
Hammadi will visit Jordan, Yemen, Sudan, Djibouti, and Libya. 
Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf will visit Malaysia, 
Indonesia, and India. 
  Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, Iraq's permanent envoy to the UN 
mission in Geneva will tour Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and 
Mauritania. 
  Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Dr. 'Abd-al-Amir al-Anbari 
will visit Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Portugal, and the 
Netherlands. Second Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Wisam 
al-Zahawi will visit Greece, Italy, the Vatican, New Zealand, 
Germany, and Japan. Counselor Wahbi Qurrah Ghuli will visit 
Venezuela and Argentina. The Iraqi foreign minister is scheduled 
to make another tour for the same purpose, but the source 
declined to name the capitals the second tour will include. 
  Meanwhile, Baghdad is witnessing increasing diplomatic 
activities. A Turkish Foreign Ministry undersecretary will 
arrive in Baghdad next Thursday to discuss the Iraqi oil 
pipeline crossing Turkish territory and the possibility of 
selling the oil locked in it since the embargo on Iraqi oil 
exports in August 1990 when the Security Council adopted 
resolutions imposing economic and technological sanctions 
against Baghdad. 
  Romanian Foreign Ministry undersecretary is currently 
visiting Baghdad as envoy of his country to the Iraqi 
leadership, and is carrying a message dealing with the detention 
of Romanian citizens in Iraq after judicial sentences were 
issued against them. 
  Preparations are under way in the Iraqi capital for the 
visit 
of Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati who will hold 
talks on a number of issues between Tehran and Baghdad suspended 
since the cease-fire on 8 August 1988 after an eight-year war. 
Diplomats said Velayati will discuss with Iraqi officials the 
fate of prisoners and the Iraqi planes that took refuge in 
Iranian airports during the second Gulf war that broke out on 17 
January 1991. The number of these planes is 148, including 22 
civilian planes. 
  An Iraqi Foreign Ministry source expects that the Iranian 
official will arrive in Baghdad leading a delegation that 
comprises a number of experts within the next two weeks. 
  The Iraqi envoys' visits to world capitals will prepare for 
the next debate on the oil embargo imposed on Iraq due to take 
place in New York next month. 
  An Indian envoy visited Baghdad last week and conveyed a 
message requesting the release of an Indian citizen who had been 
convicted by Iraqi judges.

<F P=106> [Article by AL-THAWRAH correspondent Basim 'Atiyah] </F>
  [Text] Leader President Saddam Husayn has called for the 
most efficient use of technical, human, and financial resources; 
continuous hard work; and extraordinary efforts to implement the 
Wafa' al-Qa'id River project in order to ensure potable drinking 
water for al-Basrah Governorate. 
  Engineer Ghayyath Khalil al-Hashimi, director at the offices 
of the Higher Committee for Irrigation Projects, has said that 
the leader president's directive called for nonstop work in 
order to expedite this project, noting that the cabinet has also 
taken adequate measures to fulfill the leader's wishes and 
complete the work on time. 
  The river project consists of three main sectors: The first 
begins at kilometer zero at the regulator point in al-Bad'ah and 
ends at kilometer 61.406 at the first pumping station. 
  The second sector begins at kilometer 63.530 in the town of 
al-Nasiriyah and ends at kilometer 120.323 in al-Laqit. 
  The third sector begins in al-Laqit and ends at the last 
station in Basra. 
  The project will ensure potable drinking water for 3 million 
people in the subdistricts of al-Shu'aybah, al-Harithah, Karmat 
'Ali, Safwan, Umm Qasr, al-Zubayr, Abi al-Khasib in Basra, 
al-Nasiriyah, and Suq al-Shuyukh in Dhi Qar. 
  It is worth noting that the technical work for linking

  [Text] The cabinet is getting ready for a prolonged 
closure of the territories. Our political correspondent Shlomo 
Raz reports that the cabinet today decided to keep the closure 
in effect until after Independence Day and to discuss its 
duration and magnitude in its meeting next week. 
  The cabinet also consented to import 18,000 foreign workers: 
15,000 in construction and 3,000 in agriculture. They will 
begin working within three to five weeks and will be issued 
six-month work permits. It was also decided to subsidize the 
employment of 4,000 foreign workers in agriculture, including 
2,000 who are already working in this sector. 
  The cabinet decided to set up a team to examine the plan to 
employ high school students and soldiers in agriculture until 
the foreign workers arrive. The prime minister said in the 
meeting that we should rid ourselves of our dependence on 
laborers from the territories, a dependence which forces us to 
decisions which endanger the security of the citizens.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Rabin told the cabinet that the 
closure of the territories, ordered after last week's wave of 
terror attacks, will continue until further notice. The cabinet 
decided to bring in about 18,000 foreign workers to replace 
Palestinian laborers in Israel and to subsidize 4,000 Israeli 
workers in agriculture. Jack Katzenell gave us this report: 
  [Begin recording] [Katzenell] All the cabinet ministers 
agree that the territories will be closed off at least until 
after Independence Day, and it takes place on Thursday [14 
April]. It is on what happens after then that they disagree. 
Minister of Culture and Communications Shulamit Aloni said the 
acts of a few terrorists do not entitle the government to punish 
nearly 2 million Palestinians. [passage omitted] 
  However, Prime Minister Rabin told the cabinet his long-term 
aim is to reduce Israel's dependence on Palestinian workers not 
only until the agreement with the PLO is implemented but until 
it has proven itself -- in other words, until the number of 
Palestinian terrorist attacks against Israelis has dropped in 
the wake of the establishment of Palestinian autonomy. Economic 
Planning Minister Shim'on Shetrit later told reporters this 
could mean weeks or even years. Minister of Agriculture Ya'aqov 
Tzur said: I believe the closure is for a long time; Housing 
Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer said: I believe there is an 
intention to leave it as it is, even after the implementation of 
the agreement. 
  A number of ministers hinted that the closure would be used 
as a means of pressure against Yasir 'Arafat to get him to speed 
up the negotiations. This view was expressed both by hawks like 
Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer and doves like Labor and Welfare Minister 
Ora Namir. 
  [Namir] I do believe that it will bring the PLO to come as 
soon as possible to Gaza and to Jericho and to take command of 
the security of the people that are living there. In Israel, 
the key to the process of peace is security. 
  [Katzenell] And Prime Minister Rabin told the cabinet that 
the closure will be accompanied by a diplomatic drive to 
complete the negotiations as soon as possible. [end recording]

  [Text] PLO official Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh has called for 
immediate negotiations on the permanent status of the 
territories instead of continuing the talks on Palestinian 
autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  In an interview with correspondents in Tunis, 'Abd-Rabbuh 
said that the agreement between the PLO and Israel was dying and 
the diplomatic process was reaching a dead end. 
  In reaction, political sources in Jerusalem said that it was 
the Israeli Government's policy to honor agreements. Therefore, 
there was no point in discussing the next stage of the 
negotiations between the PLO and Israel before the talks on 
Gaza-Jericho First were completed.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and </F>
Environment Minister Yosi Sarid by correspondent Hezi Makhlev on 
9 April; place not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Makhlev] This evening, the foreign minister 
commented on PLO official Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh's demand to 
immediately start negotiations over the permanent status of the 
territories instead of holding talks over autonomy in the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho. 
  [Peres] I do not accept his view. There is an agreement that 
must be implemented. This is what we will do. Anyone 
attempting to achieve permanent peace today might only create a 
permanent dispute by bringing up unresolvable issues. 
  [Makhlev] Sir, PLO circles are demanding immediate 
negotiations over the permanent status in the territories 
instead of holding talks on autonomy in the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho. 
  [Peres] I do not know what you mean by circles. We are 
conducting negotiations with the PLO leadership and with Mr. 
'Arafat. We are holding talks with him and have not heard any 
such demands at the negotiating table. 
  [Makhlev] Do you plan to meet Mr. 'Arafat after Independence 
Day in order to clarify these issues? 
  [Peres] If necessary, I will meet with him, but nothing has 
been scheduled yet. 
  [Makhlev] Meretz is demanding to limit the closure and to be 
generous in issuing work permits. What is your reaction to this? 
  [Peres] My response is that the place to discuss this issue 
is within the framework of the cabinet. 
  [Makhlev] Environment Minister Yosi Sarid, some of your 
colleagues in Meretz are requesting to ease the closure and to 
be more generous in issuing work permits to laborers from the 
territories. 
  [Sarid] First of all, I would like to say that I support the 
closure; however, I do not think that the government should tie 
its hands now by making definitive decisions on the duration of 
the closure. We know that closures have their limitations which 
we have to take into account. There are humanitarian needs of 
the first degree, and there is no need to make far-reaching 
decisions only to later backtrack from them. Therefore, the 
government should tomorrow evaluate the closure, which I 
support, and examine its duration and limitations.

  [Text] This morning, 10 representatives of the Danish, 
Norwegian, and Italian observers met with Hebron Mayor Mustafa 
al- Natshah in the city. At the end of the meeting, the mayor 
said he hopes the observers will be able to separate the Arab 
residents of Hebron and the settlers. 
  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that Khalid 'Amayirah, 
the chief Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] spokesman, 
attacked the presence of the observers in the city and said this 
is merely a public relations stunt. He warned that if the 
residents of Hebron do not feel a change in their security, the 
force might be in danger. 
  The head of the Norwegian delegation said that his men were 
received warmly in Hebron and that the mayor briefed him on the 
city's problems. He expressed the hope that the observers force 
will be able to start working soon.

  [Text] Hebron, Occupied West Bank, April 11 (AFP)--An 
advance party of foreign observers moved into Hebron on Monday 
[11 April] to protect Palestinians as Israel lifted the closure 
on the West Bank town centre, an AFP correspondent reported. 
  But party leaders said the full deployment of 160 
lightly-armed observers as agreed by Israel and the PLO 
following the February 25 mosque massacre would not take place 
before next week. 
  "This mandate is to return to normalcy and this opening is 
part of it," said Knud Volveg, head of the Norwegian delegation. 
  "We are very happy that the Israelis responded positively to 
the requests we made for opening the city centre," he told 
reporters. 
  But the Tomb of the Patriarchs where a Jewish settler gunned 
down 30 Palestinians was still closed off as it has been since 
the slaughter. 
  Volveg said the team had been given a "cordial reception ... 
[ellipsis as received] managed to get acquainted and establish 
contact." 
  The reconnaissance party included seven Norwegians, five 
Danes and four Italians, escorted by Israeli police and military 
officials and a representative of the foreign ministry. 
  Five Norwegians, three Danes and three Italians were to stay 
behind and set up in the town after meeting Palestinian 
officials. 
  "We are here today on a courtesy visit," said Kjell 
Johansen, 
the head of the Temporary International Presence and former head 
of the Norwegian contingent with UN forces in Sarajevo. 
  "We are examining the options for accommodation," the 
Norwegian policeman said. 
  "I don't expect the deployment for this week," he admitted. 
"We have to get confirmation from the Norwegian government for 
the actual agreement to deploy," he said. 
  "They (Norwegian, Danish and Italian governments) have 
agreed 
to an advanced team but we need agreement for the deployment." 
  The team met Hebron mayor Mustafa al-Natshah, who told 
reporters: "Today the (military) governor of Hebron has opened 
the city. 
  "This is a good sign. We consider it a gift from the 
delegation." 
  "We shall make arrangements on our side to facilitate their 
job," he said. 
  A preparatory group had reconnoitered the terrain from an 
Israeli army helicopter last week and met officials in Israel 
and PLO leaders in Cairo. 
  Under an agreement signed in Cairo on March 31 by Israel and 
the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Denmark will provide 90 
members to the observation team, and Norway and Italy 35 each. 
  The group will be permitted to carry handguns for 
self-defense, and will be known as a Temporary International 
Presence in Hebron (TIPH). 
  Their prime function will be to bring "a sense of security 
to 
the Palestinians of Hebron" after the mosque killings. 
  They will be barred from police work and will be restricted 
to monitoring events in Hebron.

<F P=106> [Report by David Regev] </F>
  [Text] While Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] threatens 
to pursue its attacks against Israel to avenge the Hebron 
massacre, some of its senior members in the Gaza Strip have been 
maintaining a secret channel of communications with senior IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] officers. 
  Over the weekend, IDF sources disclosed that the meetings 
were being held as part of the talks officers have been holding 
with all factions in the Gaza Strip, including the rejectionist 
organizations, in a bid to ascertain the local mood on the eve 
of the IDF's pullout. 
  One such meeting was held last Friday between 45-year-old 
Ahmad Bakr, a prominent Hamas member, and Brigadier General 
Doron Almog, commander of IDF troops in the Gaza Strip. The 
meeting took place a few hours before the murderous attack in 
'Afula. Bakr, a resident of Gaza's al-Shaykh Radwan 
neighborhood, is the director of the Islamic Society in the Gaza 
Strip, a Hamas ideologue, and was one of the 400-odd men 
deported to Lebanon. 
  Bakr told Brig. Gen. Almog that although Hamas opposes the 
autonomy it will not attack it and may even cooperate with its 
elected representatives. Bakr added that Hamas does not plan to 
attack the Palestinian policemen. "They are our brothers and 
cousins, and we will not hurt them," he said. 
  [A report by Fayiz 'Abbas on page 11 of the same paper notes 
that on 9 April the family of Fadiya Shalbi, an Israeli Arab 
woman from the village of Iksal who was killed in the 'Afula 
attack, got a phone call. On the line was a man, who said: "I 
am speaking from Hamas headquarters in the Gaza Strip. I would 
like to express my sorrow and condolences and to apologize to 
you." When asked to identify himself, the man hung up.]

  [Text] A senior military source is quoted by the ITIM news 
agency as confirming that the Israeli Army is preparing for the 
possibility that the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
organization will follow through on its threat to launch missile 
attacks against Israeli targets. Hamas has threatened that 
among the attacks it intends to carry out in advance of 
Independence Day will be missile launchings against targets that 
include Israeli settlements in the territories. The military 
source told ITIM that there is little doubt that Hamas has the 
ability to use missiles, primarily LAW antitank missiles that 
are easy to carry and that are widely used by the Israeli Army.

  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 11 (AFP)--The 
Islamic Resistance Movement [Hamas] Monday [11 April] renewed a 
threat to murder Jewish settlers and said a suicide attack that 
left seven Israelis dead and 45 wounded was only a beginning. 
  A leaflet distributed in Gaza warned that the group's 
military wing, 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, has "decided to hit at 
settlers so they can get a taste of death and leave our land." 
  "The 'Afula operation is only a beginning," it said. 
  A Hamas suicide bomber last Wednesday blew up a bus in 
'Afula. 
  A day after the bombing, Hamas threatened to fire rockets at 
Israeli homes and said the attack was the first of five to come 
on Israeli targets. 
  Meanwhile, the body of a Palestinian man with a bullet hole 
in his head was dumped in the street in Gaza City. Palestinian 
sources said he had been executed by Hamas for collaborating 
with Israeli authorities.

  [Excerpts] Thirty IDF [Israel Defense Forces] infantry and

patrols with the Palestinian police in the Gaza Strip. 
According to Qol Yisra'el's military correspondent, the course 
centers on the jeep patrols which will take place: one vehicle 
with IDF soldiers, the other with Palestinian police. 
  The head of IDF's Southern Command, Major General Matan 
Vilna'i, has called for improved coordination with the 
Palestinians and their future police force in the Strip. He was 
interview by Alan Ben-'Ami: 
  [Begin recording] [Vilna'i] The coordination now is very 
important, but one has to remember that they have to coordinate 
with us and not we are going to coordinate with them. I believe 
that it's good coordination with them. [passage omitted] 
  [Ben-'Ami] How long is it going to take you, from the time 
the agreement is signed, to actually complete the withdrawal? 
What do you estimate? 
  [Vilna'i] It depends on the treaty, on the exact treaty that 
we are going to sign with them. After we see the exact treaty, 
we'll decide what is the time that we need to withdraw. 
  [Ben-'Ami] Can you do it within a matter of hours? 
  [Vilna'i] We can do it from hours to several years. No 
problem. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Eytan Rabin, Aluf Ben, and Shlomo Dror] </F>
  [Excerpt] IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops in the Gaza 
Strip have in the last few days resumed full operation, mainly 
in the refugee camps and the big cities. The undercover units 
have also stepped up their operations in the wake of new 
instructions issued by senior Southern Command officers. 
  The Southern Command expects an increase in the attempts to 
perpetrate terror attacks due to the population's frustration as 
a result of the general closure of the territories and its close 
enforcement in the Gaza Strip. Consequently, it decided to step 
up the IDF's operations in the refugee camps and in the big 
cities. 
  Last Friday, IDF troops operated in the Dayr al-Balah 
refugee 
camp, arresting a Fatah wanted man suspected of murdering a 
70-year-old resident of Kefar Sava in February. [passage 
omitted] 
  [A report by Arye Kiesel and Shim'on Schiffer in Tel Aviv 
YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 10 April on pages 1 and 20 adds: 
"A considerable part of the IDF's regular combat forces is 
currently deployed in the territories to assure a maximum 
enforcement of the closure. 
  ["The training program of many units has been halted to 
enable their transfer to the territories. The troops 
meticulously monitor every road, passage, and footpath leading

  [Text] Jerusalem, 8 April (AFP) -- Four Iraqis crossed the 
border from Jordan into northern Israel on Friday [8 April], 
sparking a major security alert, military officials said. 
  The Iraqis, who were unarmed, gave themselves up and asked 
for political asylum. 
  However when army spotters sighted the men just south of the 
Sea of Galilee the alert was sounded fearing an armed 
infiltration was underway. 
  Half a dozen cases of Iraqis, some army deserters, reaching 
the Israeli border with Jordan have been reported in the last 
two years. All have requested political asylum or to be allowed 
to travel on to a third country.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpt] Israel has completed a comprehensive study on the 
demarcation of the Israeli-Jordanian border to be used as a 
basis in the negotiations with Jordan. The document analyzes 
the problems with the demarcation of the border, which runs from 
Hammat Gader in the north to Elat in the south, through the 
Jordan and al-Yarmukh Rivers and the 'Arava. The 
Israeli-Jordanian border has never been demarcated by mutual 
consent, either on maps on in the field. Its current 
configuration is based on general descriptions dating back to 
the time of the British mandate. The joint agenda of the talks 
stipulates that the border will be demarcated taking these 
descriptions into consideration. 
  The study depicts numerous problems involved in the 
demarcation of the border (which runs through the center of the 
Jordan River and the Dead Sea) due to changes in the river flow 
and the lake's size, and raises questions such as determining 
the sovereignty over small islands in the Jordan River. 
  Jordan has various claims from Israel concerning the 
borders, 
first and foremost, to get back areas in the 'Arava occupied by 
Israel after the Six-Day War. Jordan has been pressuring Israel 
to discuss the demarcation of the border, posing it as a 
condition for progress in the peace talks. Jordan has not yet 
submitted a detailed account of its demands in the framework of 
the Washington talks. 
  A debate about joint development projects in the 'Arava is 
scheduled to be held in the next meeting of the joint Israeli- 
Jordanian-U.S. economic committee. Although Israel and Jordan 
have been discussing joint projects, the Jordanians demand to 
discuss the demarcation of the border first, because those 
projects are slated for the border area. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has instructed the Israeli 
delegation to the talks with Jordan not to discuss the border 
issue before the Jordanians agree to engage in serious 
discussions on the formulation of a peace treaty between the two 
countries. [passage omitted]

  [Gay] Your trip to Oman seems less certain than before, 
since the hosts of the multilateral conference on water asked 
the Israelis to postpone their arrival. 
  [Beilin] It is true, such a request was presented. There 
had been a tendency, even a decision to send the preliminary 
group on 3 April, but they asked to put it off to 10 April. We 
do not know yet whether their demand reflects a desire to change 
the parameters of our participation. We will only know it when 
the preliminary delegation arrives there. If it transpires that 
they want to change the parameters -- namely, to limit our 
participation or deny media attendance, we will insist that the 
Oman encounter be identical to the other multilateral forums in 
every sense. We are definitely not going to agree to any change 
of the talks' parameters. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih </F>
by Muhammad Jamal 'Arafah in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] ['Arafah] Is there concrete 
evidence that Israel is supplying the southern rebels with 
weapons? 
  [Abu-Salih] It is a fact that Israeli weapons are reaching 
the rebels. We have had evidence in the past. Israel has been 
involved in supporting the rebellion since the sixties. All the 
rebels' weapons originate in Israel. The incident in which a 
plane loaded with weapons was headed for Uganda is just one 
aspect of Israel's support for the rebels. 
  ['Arafah] Have you agreed with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa on 
a date for resumption of the talks on Hala'ib? Why have 
negotiations been postponed for so long? 
  [Abu-Salih] We have been waiting for Foreign Minister Musa 
since September. We have sent him an invitation but he has not 
come. I told him this when he visited me (in the hotel). No 
agreement was reached with him on a date. However, we are 
waiting for him at any time. 
  Regarding the postponement of the talks, why don't you ask 
Egypt about this postponement? Why don't you ask Foreign 
Minister Musa this question? We have agreed to proceed in 
accordance with what Presidents Mubarak and al-Bashir agreed 
upon--namely, to draw up a framework for relations between the 
two countries. We have not been negligent and we do not want to 
blame anyone. Therefore, we did not want to submit the issue of 
Hala'ib to the Arab League meetings. We are still waiting for 
'Amr Musa to honor us with a visit! 
  ['Arafah] It has been said that there is U.S. support for 
the rebels in the south. On the other hand, Sudanese Foreign 
Ministry officials have stated that they are convinced that the 
United States does not want to topple the present regime. Is 
there a contradiction in the stand of the United States? 
  [Abu-Salih] We take everyone at their word. The United 
States, according to its ambassador in Khartoum, says it does 
not support the rebels and does not do anything to topple the 
government. Secret actions by other nonofficial U.S. quarters 
(for example intelligence) is another matter! 
  ['Arafah] It has been reiterated that there is a new 
dialogue between the United States and Sudan. For this purpose, 
the U.S. President has appointed a special representative to 
Sudan. He will also send his UN ambassador to Sudan at the end 
of this month. 
  [Abu-Salih] Dialogue with the United States started a long 
time ago. U.S. Secretary Christopher referred to this dialogue 
even though Sudan is included on the list of the states that 
support terrorism. Recently, there has been the impression or 
signals that there is hope that this dialogue will be continued. 
For our part, we have already stated that we need balanced 
relations with the United States. I will meet with President 
Clinton's envoy on 31 March. She will carry a message from 
Clinton to al-Bashir. I believe that this mission will help 
promote dialogue between the two sides. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Speculation among political, spiritual, and 
media circles that the pope's visit to Lebanon would be 
postponed was confirmed today when two statements were issued, 
one by the Vatican and the other at a news conference held by 
Papal Nuncio Pablo Puente in the Vatican Embassy in Harisa at 
noon today. Puente, who returned to Beirut yesterday following 
a brief visit to the Vatican, officially announced that Pope 
John Paul II's visit to Lebanon has been postponed until a date 
to be decided, when conditions are more suited to such a visit 
producing the expected results. [passage omitted] 
  In the first reaction to the postponement of the visit, 
Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, chairman of the Higher 
Islamic Shiite Council, received a message from Papal Nuncio 
Pablo Puente informing him of the postponement of the pope's 
visit to Lebanon. His eminence expressed his regret over the 
postponement of the visit, which had been awaited by Lebanon and 
the Lebanese in view of the pope's position in the hearts of all 
the Lebanese. His eminence added: We hope the circumstances 
will become suitable for the pope to make his visit.

  [Text] [Announcer] Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the 
Yemeni Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], accompanied by Dr. 
'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, member of the YSP Political Bureau and 
secretary of foreign relations, arrived in Amman today on a 
two-day visit to Jordan during which they will meet with His 
Majesty King Husayn and senior officials. The visit comes 
within the framework of their tour of the region. 
  Upon arrival at Amman Civil Airport, Salim Salih Muhammad, 
member of the Yemeni Presidential Council, spoke to reporters 
about his visit Jordan. He said: 
  [Muhammad] First, we carry the greetings of the Yemeni 
people and of their political leadership and parties to His 
Majesty King Husayn and the fraternal Jordanian people. We also 
carry our great appreciation for the efforts exerted by our 
Jordanian brothers and by His Majesty King Husayn, including 
both the efforts that preceded the signing of the accord 
document and the efforts that followed, represented by the great 
role played by fraternal Jordan within the military committee, 
as well as its political efforts aimed at solving the existing 
political crisis. 
  Our current tour comes within the framework of efforts 
to inform our brothers in Jordan and the Arab brothers of the 
nature of the present situation. It also comes within the 
framework of a request for help, especially from fraternal 
Jordan, to overcome problems and certain difficulties we are 
facing. We specifically ask fraternal Jordan to continue this 
role because, in our view, it is a role that does not concern 
the Yemenis alone, but concerns all Arabs. It is an honorable 
pan-Arab role. 
  We reiterate our thanks to fraternal Jordan, to His 
Majesty King Husayn, and to the Jordanian Government. 
  [Announcer] On Yemeni efforts to implement the Yemeni accord 
document, Salim Salih Muhammad said: 
  [Muhammad] The dialogue is still going on. What is 
important to us now is to obstruct the military course -- a 
course that is frightening to us -- and to reinforce the other 
course -- the course of dialogue -- in order to begin 
implementing this document that sets the practical and sound 
solutions to correct the Yemeni situation. Moreover, it is now 
important to us to build the new Yemen, which secures rights and 
duties for all its people. 
  [Announcer] On the presence of other Arab mediation efforts. 
He said: 
  [Muhammad] We do not view mediation efforts as separate 
efforts but as concentrated Arab efforts. Therefore, we welcome 
all our Arab brothers' support for the ongoing efforts inside 
Yemen. At the same time, we particularly welcome the Arab 
efforts represented by the roles played by the two fraternal 
countries, Jordan and Oman. 
  [Announcer] On the practical steps that should be taken in 
order to overcome the crisis in Yemen, Salim Salih Muhammad said: 
  [Muhammad] At the Amman meeting held in this good land 
during the holy month of Ramadan, certain issues were defined in 
terms of beginning to implement the provisions of the accord 
document, starting with the security issue, which worries the 
Yemenis and really needs immediate implementation in order to 
bring things back to normal in Yemen. Afterward, we will get 
into the priorities according to a fixed timetable. This is the 
normal course in order to get the crisis and Yemen out of the 
dark tunnel.

  [Excerpts] Riyadh, 6 Apr (SPA) -- Their excellencies the 
ministers of trade in the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] states 
began the proceedings of the 20th session of the Trade 
Cooperation Committee at the GCC headquarters in Riyadh today. 
  Dr. Sulayman al-Salim, Saudi commerce minister and chairman 
of the current session, delivered a speech at the start of the 
meeting, welcoming the GCC trade ministers and hailing the depth 
of cooperation between the GCC states. [passage omitted] 
  His excellency concluded his speech by saying: 
"International 
changes are aimed at achieving real free trade, particularly now 
that all the difficulties have been overcome and the Uruguay 
Round has ended in success. Endeavors are also under way to 
turn GATT into an international trade organization at the 
meeting due to be held in Marrakesh soon. All this imposes 
challenges on us and obliges us to make huge efforts to achieve 
greater freedom of trade among us; we must remove all procedural 
obstacles in order to pave the way so that we may keep up with 
and adapt to these positive international trends." 
  He also said that he hoped that everyone would cooperate to 
take more national goods off the list of the goods on which 
there is an import ban. He added that he would like to see the 
competent authorities reach a suitable formula to unify tariffs 
within the GCC. After this the commerce minister announced the 
end of the opening session.

<F P=106> [Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, head of </F>
the Islamic Propaganda Organization and acting Friday prayers 
leader, in Tehran on 8 April--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] May God's peace and mercy be upon you all 
[passage omitted] I wish to pass a message on behalf of Imam 
Sadeq to the Islamic world, to all Muslims -- wherever they live 
and whatever sect they follow -- and to everyone who is under 
the enemies' oppression in the East and the West, that you 
should strive to become familiar with the Imams; and if you 
desire salvation you should apply this culture and these 
training methods. You should not be afraid of the enemy, 
shortages, and hardship. You should stand against the enemy. 
Ultimately you shall survive and the enemies will depart. 
[shouts of approval from the congregation] 
  The enemy only thinks of himself. He thinks of lust, wealth, 
status, and mundane matters of this valueless, untrustworthy, 
and disloyal world. Divine tradition will not allow them to 
survive. World creation is not based on this. The creation is 
righteous. We did not create the earth, the heavens and what is 
in between them in vain [Koranic verse]. They are wrong because 
they are moving contrary to the objectives of creation. They 
will, thus, be crushed. You, the Palestinian youth, who went 
and carried out that suicidal action in revenge: First, may God 
join your soul with those of all the immaculate martyrs of 
Islam. [shouts of approval] 
  Second, we are satisfied with what you have done, and may 
God 
give some of the rewards of your deed to us. 
  Third, the enemy should understand what the problem is: When 
a desperate person reaches the end of his rope, this is to what 
he will resort. How can mankind tolerate injustice forever? 
They might tolerate it for a year or two, or 10 or 20 years. 
You have been bullying these people for the past 45 years. You 
have suppressed them for 45 years. They are human beings and 
not sheep to put up with everything until they are slaughtered. 
  God did not create mankind to put up with tyranny. God did 
not create human beings to be feeble. God created mankind to be 
an honor-seeking, a justice-seeking creature in search of the 
truth. These virtues of mankind will work for him eventually. 
But there is a limit to each individual's endurance. There is 
a limit to one's patience. When one runs out of patience, the 
oppressor must expect to see the consequences of his torturous 
deeds. 
  The United States is making a mistake. The United States' 
allies are wrong. Israel is wrong. They are wrong to imagine 
that a handful of weak and vile individuals can solve humanity's 
plight by sitting around a table to sign an accord. The United 
States is committing crimes in the world today. On the one 
hand, when people are killed while saying prayers, they play 
dead in terms of adopting a stance. Their only response was a 
feeble and tasteless move, just to silence their own public. On 
the other hand, when this man took action to avenge the blood of 
those martyrs by punishing them, they could not wait to hold a 
session to condemn this action. Shame on you. They killed 
worshipers inside a mosque during Ramadan, and you did not give 
a damn. Whereas, when this young person sacrificed his own life 
just to demonstrate that we are alive, just to tell you not to 
go on with what you are doing and just to stop tyranny and 
murder, then you sit and condemn him. [shouts of approval from 
congregation] [passage omitted] 
  Our Bosnian brothers and sisters, and our brothers and 
sisters who are the target of repression in Gorazde today -- and 
with the United Nations failing to do its routine work -- they 
should know that they will survive because they are righteous. 
They must learn from history and be a model for the future. 
They should continue to resist as they have done so well until 
now. May God bless them with his victory.
