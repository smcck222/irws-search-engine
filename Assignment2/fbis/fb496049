<F P=106> [Report by Eytan Rabin and Gay Bekhor] </F>
  [Excerpts] Joint Lebanese and Syrian Army units raided 
Hizballah arms caches in the Ba'labakk area two days ago and 
confiscated weapons, equipment, and drugs. Israeli security 
sources believe that such activity, if it continues, could have 
political significance. [passage omitted] 
  The joint raid was directed against arms caches in a 
Hizballah stronghold in the Ba'labakk area. Large amounts of 
weapons, explosives, and drugs were seized. Over the past few 
weeks, the Lebanese Army raided Christian strongholds several 
times and detained several persons. Israeli sources believe 
that the Lebanese Army is trying to demonstrate its control in 
Lebanon and show it is also operating in the northern part of 
the country. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Uri Lubrani, coordinator of </F>
government activities in Lebanon, by Hayim Zissowitz; place not 
given -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Zissowitz] Mr. Lubrani, in his speech in the 
Knesset yesterday, the prime minister said Syria is still not 
evincing enough openness and flexibility to permit a 
breakthrough in the talks on the substance of peace. This also 
relates to Hizballah activity, which Syria is allowing to 
continue. What is Syria's policy in Lebanon? 
  [Lubrani] Syria undoubtedly regards Hizballah activity in 
Lebanon as leverage for gaining advantages on its track. 
  [Zissowitz] A report in HA'ARETZ this morning speaks about a 
joint Syrian-Lebanese military operation against Hizballah arms 
caches in Ba'labakk. 
  [Lubrani] I can only say that from what we know, this 
operation can be considered mere cosmetics. They are trying to 
prove that they are doing something, but I know nothing about 
such a thing in practice. 
  [Zissowitz] Are there any signs that Syria is trying to curb 
Hizballah attacks against Israel? 
  [Lubrani] Occasionally, as a result of U.S. pressure and in 
order to appease the United States, Syria attempts to curb 
Hizballah, even if only for appearances sake. There have been 
two such cases. During the last elections, there was a period 
of one month without any serious Hizballah attacks. Recently, 
in anticipation of the al-Asad-Clinton summit, complete calm was 
restored. Syria can stop Hizballah attacks if it wants to. 
  [Zissowitz] What about the SLA's [South Lebanese Army] 
operations? This organization suffered many casualties in 
battles against Hizballah last weekend. Civilians were also 
killed. Is the SLA's morale flagging? 
  [Lubrani] The SLA is undoubtedly facing a process of 
attrition. Both Hizballah and the rejectionist organizations 
are trying to undermine the SLA and the security zone. The SLA 
is having a hard time dealing with this situation, but it is 
continuing to function and is manning its posts. The SLA is our 
spearhead in maintaining calm along our northern border. 
  [Zissowitz] Is there any truth to the reports that the SLA 
is bitter over the fact that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is 
limiting its ability to react to the terrorists' provocations? 
  [Lubrani] There is some truth to these reports. It is only 
natural, however, that they would prefer to react much more 
firmly to attacks on them. On the other hand, they know that 
our actions are aimed at trying to preserve the understandings 
we reached with the Syrians via the Americans. Most of the 
time, they refrain from reacting, even when they are provoked to 
retaliate. Sometimes such outbursts do occur, such as the 
attack on Sidon last Friday. 
  [Zissowitz] There were reports of a massacre perpetrated by 
the SLA in the village of 'Aramta. 
  [Lubrani] There was no such massacre. It was invented by 
Lebanese and Syrian information circles, who turned Hizballah 
attacks in 'Aramta -- which hit the civilian population 
primarily -- into an SLA attack against the population of this 
village. This is an outright lie. 
  [Zissowitz] Are you completely satisfied with continuing the 
cooperation and coordination between the IDF and SLA? 
  [Lubrani] I have no doubt that the coordination and 
cooperation will continue. There are easy periods and more 
difficult periods. We have already been through such periods. 
We must realize, however, that we are in the midst of a war of 
attrition aimed not only at the SLA but at the IDF as well. The 
SLA is bearing a very heavy load, and we must realize this fact 
and deal with it accordingly. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Let us turn to the Middle East. After having 
ordered the closure of the occupied territories for 10 days 
following the latest round of massacres, the government in 
Jerusalem has decided to allow some 20,000 Palestinians involved 
in social and humanitarian work to be allowed back in. Prime 
Minister Rabin has also announced a plan for the withdrawal of 
Israeli troops from the Golan Heights. Our correspondent 
Giovanni Bocco interviewed Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres: 
  [Begin recording] [Bocco, in English, translating his own 
question into Italian] The Cairo peace negotiations have 
restarted: When do you think an agreement over Gaza and Jericho 
will be reached? 
  [Peres, in English, with correspondent providing Italian 
translation] It appears to me that both ourselves and the PLO 
are respecting the agreements. I believe that the most 
difficult part of the negotiations has been overcome. The 
majority of the workload is behind us. If all goes well, then 
in two or three weeks time we will leave the Gaza Strip. 
  [Bocco] The international observers are arriving in Hebron. 
There are 35 Italians among these observers: What do you think 
about this? 
  [Peres] I believe that this is an important contribution to 
the peace process. The international presence is truly welcome, 
at least on our part, because it is important in bringing normal 
living conditions to Hebron and for preventing acts of violence. 
This welcome extends to the Italian contingent. 
  [Bocco] What do you think of the arrival of the Palestinian 
police force? 
  [Peres] I think that the Palestinians can and must provide 
security measures. They must police themselves. We cannot be 
the policemen of the Palestinians who have every right to have 
their own security force. We are happy that the police force is 
on its way. You cannot imagine how truthful my words are. [end

  [Text] Outgoing Police Commissioner Rafi Peled says there 
is no Palestinian police activity in Jerusalem. Peled was 
reacting to East Jerusalem Arabic press reports submitted to the 
Knesset Internal Affairs Committee by chairman Yehoshu'a Matza. 
Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that according to Peled, 
the pictures that appeared in the newspapers were staged for 
photographers. The commissioner added, however, that the 
activity of Palestinian groups organized for dealing with 
ethical and drug-related matters in Jerusalem has been stopped.

  [Excerpts] The Shamgar Commission of Inquiry today heard 
testimony from three Muslim worshipers, who were in the cave at 
the time of the massacre. The first witness to appear told the 
commission that he had heard shooting after Barukh Goldstein had 
been beaten to the ground by Muslims in the cave. Steve Linde 
has details: 
  [Begin Linde recording] The commission's hearings were 
delayed by about an hour this morning, because the three Muslim 
witnesses due to appear, arrived late. Soldiers apparently held 
them up because they did not have the necessary permits to enter 
Jerusalem from Hebron. 
  In nearly three hours of testimony, Hajj Ahmad Muhammad 
complained about the behavior of Jewish worshipers in the Cave 
of the Patriarchs, and gave a detailed account of the February 
25 massacre. Muhammad said after the morning prayers began, he 
heard two loud explosions, immediately followed by automatic 
fire, at which point all the Muslims in the cave fell to the 
floor. He saw the man with the case and earphones who had 
fired, and saw Muslim worshipers who were standing behind him 
attack him and throw him to the floor. [passage omitted] 
  Muhammad shocked the commission when he testified earlier 
that on the night before the massacre, on the Purim holiday, 
settlers had entered the cave drunk. He also said settlers had 
urinated in the cave, but when pressed by the judges, said he 
had only seen Muslim cleaners washing the floor afterwards. 
Judge Eli'ezer Goldberg noted that the witness had not actually 
seen what he was alleging, and he could not accept that Jews, 
who regarded the cave as holy, would defecate inside. 
  The commission of inquiry has held 30 sessions and heard 
testimony from some 100 witnesses. [end recording] 
  Two lawyers have petitioned the High Court of Justice to 
suspend Judge 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Zu'bi from the Shamgar 
Commission. They say al-Zu'bi was quoted in the media as saying 
settlers are the cruelest element in the territories.

<F P=106> [Address by Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu at the opening </F>
of the Knesset summer session in Jerusalem -- live] 
  [Text] Mr. Chairman, Honorable Knesset, I would like to 
begin by wishing a full and speedy recovery to those wounded in 
yet another terrorist attack which took place today in 
Jerusalem. One attack follows another and terrorism has become 
a daily occurrence. Seeing as we are now opening the Knesset 
summer session, I would like to remind you, Mr. Prime Minister, 
of what you said at the beginning of the last winter session. 
Seven months ago, eight days after signing the Oslo agreement 
with 'Arafat, you stood upon the podium and declared that a new 
era had begun. I am quoting the very words you used to describe 
it: a new era. I continue to quote: Today, we are heading 
toward greater opportunities and better times, toward days which 
will be free of worry and nights which will be free of anxiety. 
When the peace which we so yearn for arrives, our lives will 
change completely and we will no longer have to live by the 
sword. What has happened since then? What has happened is that 
there has never been such a deterioration of personal security 
in every city, town, village, and settlement in this country. 
You, Mr. Prime Minister. You, and not me, mentioned statistics 
before. I heard your statistics. You said that 161 Israeli 
civilians were murdered during the six and a half years of the 
intifadah. Sorry, I was mistaken, the correct number is 151. 
Since the signing of the Oslo agreement, a period of a little 
more than six months, almost 40 Israeli civilians were murdered. 
According to my calculation, Mr. Prime Minister, this means 
that since the signing of the Oslo agreement -- which you signed 
in order to bring about an end to terrorism -- the rate of 
murders and the rate of terrorism has increased fourfold. So do 
not talk to us about days without anxiety. What you have 
brought us with your government's stupid policy is days filled 
with worry and nights consumed by anxiety. The good days you 
promised us have turned into days of bloodshed and terror under 
the shadow of terrorist attacks. Mr. Prime Minister, the 
government has failed in the most important task of every 
Israeli government, which is to protect the life of each 
civilian; and this failure is a direct result of your policy. 
You said that you did not change the rules of engagement for 
IDF soldiers. Okay, I will not argue with you on that point 
although that too is debatable. However, you did the following 
things with regard to the other party. You, not me, released 
thousands of terrorists into the streets. You returned hundreds 
of deportees. We told you not to permit them to return. They 
participated in accelerated courses in assembling car bombs in 
Lebanon, yet you permitted them to return. You pardoned hundreds 
of fugitives and let all the leaders of the intifadah return. 
So what happens when you flood the streets with terrorists? Is 
there really reason to be surprised by the tremendous upsurge in 
terrorism, as indicated by the data you yourself provided? More 
terrorists lead to more terrorism. Did you learn anything from 
this? No, because you are going to continue. We have just been 
told that you are about to release not 4,000, but another 6,000 
prisoners. You talk about a historic process. Mr. Prime 
Minister, you are about to enter history as the prime minister 
who established a 9,000 member Palestinian terrorist army whom 
you are about to arm with helicopters, armored vehicles, and 
machine guns. You call this a security policy? It is a policy 
that undermines security, it is a policy of insanity, of 
disconnection from reality. I call on you to stop this policy 
and bring it to a halt before there is more bloodshed. 
  However, since we are at the opening of a Knesset session 
and I have reminded you of statements you made in the past, let 
me recall other remarks you made at the same session on 21 
September 1993, eight days after the signing of the agreement in 
Washington. You said that you have firmly anchored this 
agreement on three basic tenets. Let me quote the very words 
you used from this podium to describe these three principles. 
One, the PLO has committed to condemn and stop all acts of 
terrorism and violence in Israel, the territories, and 
everywhere else. Two, the PLO has promised to enforce the 
cessation of terrorism and violence on all of its members and 
prosecute anyone who breaks these commitments. Three, the PLO 
has promised to annul all clauses in the Palestinian Covenant 
denying Israel's right to exist and to bring about the official 
abrogation of these clauses. Mr. Prime Minister, what is left 
from all these commitments? You can make as many dismissive 
gestures as you want. Let us see what happened. You said that 
the PLO would stop terrorism. Okay, so we checked the minutes 
again and noted down that on the same occasion on this podium, 
eight days after the signing of the agreement, you said -- and I 
quote: I would like to report that since the signing of the 
Oslo agreement, the PLO has not carried out any attacks. Well, 
Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to tell you that nearly eight 
months have now passed since the signing of the Oslo agreement 
and they have definitely perpetrated attacks. Let us see what 
the PLO has done. First of all, the PLO -- and right now I am 
not talking about people directly under 'Arafat's command, I am 
talking about those who are not under his direct command -- 
these factions carried out nine terrorist attacks. They killed 
five Israelis and wounded eight other people. Okay, they are not 
directly under 'Arafat's command. So let us see what the Fatah 
did. This is much worse, Mr. Prime Minister. When one makes 
use of statistics it is advisable to examine the figures first. 
For example, the Fatah, 'Arafat's own organization, carried out 
37 attacks in which six people were killed and 14 others were 
wounded. I would like to read out the names of Yuval Golan, 
David Dedi, Hayim Weizman, Yitzhaq Rutenberg, Maurice Eisenstadt 
-- who murdered them Mr. Prime Minister? Was it the Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement]? No, it was Fatah. 
  Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the prime minister who 
murdered them? Was it the enemies of peace? No, it was the 
supporters of peace, the Fatah people, the good guys. You 
understand: There are bad guys, who are the Hamas, and good 
guys who are the PLO. There are also even better guys among the 
good guys -- that is Fatah, the cream of the crop. 
  Mr. Prime Minister, the first promise you made to the people 
of Israel that the PLO would halt terrorism was not kept. Now, 
with regard to the second promise that 'Arafat would take steps 
to punish any of his people who continued to carry out attacks, 
thus violating the new policy of putting a stop to terrorism -- 
that was not kept either. No action whatsoever was taken 
against any of these murderers. 'Arafat did not say anything. 
He did not bring them before a court, he did not expel them 
from the organization, he has not even condemned the attacks. 
One can occasionally drag out a condemnation from him much like 
a dentist extracting a tooth from a reluctant patient. That is 
really interesting. Obviously, the second condition that the 
PLO would take steps against terrorists was not kept. Now for 
your third promise: that 'Arafat would annul the Palestinian 
Covenant calling for Israel's destruction. He has not canceled 
the covenant nor does he intend to abrogate it in future. Mr. 
Prime Minister, I heard a senior defense establishment official, 
whom you sent to one of the Knesset committees, say that Israel 
had solid intelligence data that they had no intention of ever 
conceding anything. What are you proposing? Let us examine 
that. Every single one of your assumptions, without exception, 
has crumbled in the face of reality. 
  I understand that this bothers you, Mr. Peres. You wrote a 
book about the new Middle East but what can you do if the old 
Middle East comes back to slap you in the face? I know that 
reality is hard to face. Because when you examine your 
assumptions -- the PLO did not keep its promise to stop 
terrorism; the Palestinian Covenant was not canceled; and no 
punitive steps were ever taken against PLO terrorists -- they 
all crumble in the face of reality. All I am asking for is that 
the prime minister, who, as we have already seen, can take the 
stage at any given moment, come up to the podium and simply 
admit that he was wrong. Let him say: I was wrong and made 
certain assumptions that did not come to pass. It can happen. 
People can make mistakes. 
  Mr. Prime Minister, I heard that you held a telephone 
conversation with 'Arafat two or three days ago. Let me ask you 
exactly what you have to talk to that man about? Do you demand 
that he revoke the Palestinian Covenant and stop Fatah 
terrorism? Do you demand that he enforce these steps? Do you 
ask for this? It is very hard to hear the truth but the people 
already know the truth and no amount of shouting can hide or 
obfuscate it. Mr. Prime Minister, I was also told that during 
yesterday's cabinet session, you flexed a little, puny muscle 
vis a vis the PLO. You said something, you gently chided them 
that people were saying that the Fatah in Gaza is not behaving 
nicely, that it has some sort of cooperation going. Look, I do 
not want to offend the prime minister or the members of the 
cabinet but I do not think that 'Arafat is overly concerned and 
I will tell you why. It is because he sees and knows that every 
one of the basic assumptions that you counted on, every one of 
the promises he gave you are not being kept and you are not 
demanding that he keep them. For him, the entire business is 
pure bunk. To him, you personally as well as the entire Israeli 
Government is nothing but a paper tiger. It has no value. It 
is incapable of demanding or insisting on anything. It can only 
make threats which are meaningless. You do not know how to 
negotiate. Several days ago, I asked a group of Israeli 
businessmen, who are not affiliated with the Likud -- actually 
they are even closer to the Labor party -- whether they would 
entrust negotiations over their private businesses and assets to 
such a government. None of them said yes. Now, Mr. Prime 
Minister, you have discovered something new. Mr. Prime 
Minister, today I heard of your new discovery. You have 
discovered that the PLO is cooperating with Hamas; or rather you 
said that if it cooperates with Hamas then we will have to 
consider taking steps. Have you suddenly discovered this today? 
Did you not know this already? You have a delegation where 
Fatah representatives are constantly and incessantly issuing one 
ultimatum. They are demanding that we release the Hamas 
murderers. A Hamas official appears at the ceremony marking the 
30th anniversary of the Fatah's establishment. Now they meet 
and say that when the Palestinian police, or rather army, is 
established it will not act to prevent attacks against Israeli 
citizens. This is Hamas and Fatah. I hear what they say and 
then I hear your reaction. Who do you threaten? King Husayn. 
Okay, so you threatened Husayn. But I ask you Mr. Prime 
Minister, why do you not demand the same demands of yourself 
that you demand from Husayn. Where is this cooperation between 
these two terrorist organizations, Hamas and Fatah, taking 
place? In Amman, Syria, Baghdad, or Tunisia? No, it is taking 
place here in the territories under your control and 
responsibility. It is taking place here in the Gaza Strip, in 
Judaea and Samaria, and you are doing nothing. You are not even 
condemning it or demanding anything. What you do is threaten 
King Husayn. This is a government which makes threats that 
nobody takes seriously. Everything is collapsing and 
disintegrating. What do you do? What does the prime minister 
do after all his basic assumptions collapse? The third basic 
assumption was that the PLO would defend us against Hamas. The 
prime minister told us several minutes ago and I quote: We will 
not stop the peace train. What peace are you talking about? Do 
you really believe this? This is self-delusion, it is not 
peace. The government is deluding itself and deluding the 
public. It is a process which will lead to an increase in 
terrorism. It is a process of retreat. It is a process of 
retreat which will lead to the establishment of a Palestinian 
state along the 1967 borders. 
  Mr. Prime Minister, you may have a technical majority in 
the Knesset, however, you tour the country occasionally and you 
already know that you do not enjoy the support of a majority of 
the Israeli public. You do not have a majority and that is 
putting it diplomatically [Netanyahu interrupted by prolonged 
heckling]. 
  Mr. Chairman, you have to understand that this government 
believes that its job is to prevent the opposition from voicing 
its opinions. If the government can use its influence in the 
media then great, but if not it can always scream to high 
heaven. But I can hear what Hamas and Fatah said through all 
the government's yelling. They said that not only will they 
cooperate in murdering Jews -- they are not the murderers of 
peace, they are the murderers of Jews -- but they also said 
something else which is more important. They reiterated what 
was once declared by Rafiq al-Natshah, a leading PLO official, 
who said that they shared a joint long-term goal: the 
liberation of all of Palestine. Therefore, from the point of 
view of both Hamas and the PLO, the goal of this process, which 
you insist on calling a peace process, is to establish a 
Palestinian state which serves as an instrument for our 
destruction. The distinction made by the government between 
those Israelis who oppose and Israelis who support peace is not 
only absurd but also patently false. There are no opponents of 
peace among the Israeli people but there are many people who 
oppose a false peace which is only designed to bring about the 
establishment of a Palestinian state, to hand over the Golan 
Heights to the Syrian tyrant, and following these concessions to 
lead to a war which will be far worse than any we have 
experienced until today. If one were to ask what is the most 
fundamental and deepest difference between our approaches it is 
this: The main difference between the left-wing Labor 
government and the Likud is that the left-wing believes that 
peace will be achieved by dwarfing Israel's stature and by its 
capitulation to the dictates of tyrannical regimes and 
terrorists; whereas we believe that peace can only be achieved 
by Israel growing stronger within its present defensive borders. 
We believe that this strengthening must be effected by 
expanding settlement activity, increasing aliyah, and 
bolstering, not weakening, the IDF's ability to meet the 
challenges we may yet be forced to face.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpts] Israel will demand that the understandings 
achieved with Syria in July 1993 as a result of Operation 
Accountability be expanded in a bid to curb Hizballah activity 
in the security zone and minimize friction between Hizballah and 
other terrorist organizations on one hand and the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] and the SLA [South Lebanese Army] on the other. 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will ask Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, who will visit Israel next week, to relay this 
message to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. 
  Among other things, Israel will demand that the ban on 
Hizballah katyusha and mortar attacks be expanded to include the 
security zone as well. The Operation Accountability 
understandings refer only to Israeli territory. 
  In contacts with U.S. officials over the past few days, 
senior Israeli officials made it clear that as a result of the 
war of attrition with Hizballah, the SLA is under a strain so 
great that it is in danger of disintegrating -- a thing which 
Israel cannot tolerate. [passage omitted] 
  Reacting to Israeli warnings, senior Lebanese and Syrian 
officials told the U.S. ambassadors in both countries' capitals 
that Hizballah is maintaining the Operation Accountability 
understandings by limiting its attacks to IDF and SLA military 
targets, while Israel and the SLA are breaching the 
understandings by attacking civilians. 
  Israel briefed the United States in detail about last 
weekend's events in south Lebanon. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Today's guest at the Knesset Foreign Affairs 
and Defense Committee was Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Our 
correspondent Hayim Hecht reports on today's proceedings: 
  [Begin recording] [Hecht] The Golan Heights was the main 
issue discussed at today's session. Opposition members demanded 
that the prime minister disclose the working papers prepared by 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], the Foreign Ministry, and what 
they defined as another government-affiliated body. Yitzhaq 
Rabin said: No working papers, just data collection. 
  [Rabin] Various working papers that were drafted over the 
years have now been put together. These papers do not amount to 
plans but rather are meant to provide the political echelon with 
data in order to reach decisions. This is how all these papers 
should be regarded. Neither the Army nor any other government 
body deals with political issues. Each body is in charge of a 
specific field, but when it comes to issues that are first and 
foremost of a security nature, they follow the guidance of the 
political echelon. They only prepare data, nothing else. 
  [Hecht] Binyamin Netanyahu disclosed information according 
to which the 6,000 Palestinian policemen who will arrive in Gaza 
in the next few days will be permitted to bring their family 
members. Netanyahu claims this amounts to exercising the right 
of return. [passage omitted] 
  [Rabin] I agreed that those who will come from abroad on 
specific dates may bring their immediate relatives with them. 
More than 750,000 Palestinians live in Gaza; I do not think 
another 20,000-30,000 will make any difference. I have no 
problem with their coming to Gaza. 
  [Hecht] Referring to the cooperation between Fatah and Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement], Rabin said he cannot prevent 
Palestinians from talking to each other, but if this talk leads 
to attacks, this will constitute a red line for us. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Eytan Rabin and Gay Bekhor] </F>
  [Excerpts] Joint Lebanese and Syrian Army units raided 
Hizballah arms caches in the Ba'labakk area two days ago and 
confiscated weapons, equipment, and drugs. Israeli security 
sources believe that such activity, if it continues, could have 
political significance. [passage omitted] 
  The joint raid was directed against arms caches in a 
Hizballah stronghold in the Ba'labakk area. Large amounts of 
weapons, explosives, and drugs were seized. Over the past few 
weeks, the Lebanese Army raided Christian strongholds several 
times and detained several persons. Israeli sources believe 
that the Lebanese Army is trying to demonstrate its control in 
Lebanon and show it is also operating in the northern part of 
the country. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Uri Lubrani, coordinator of </F>
government activities in Lebanon, by Hayim Zissowitz; place not 
given -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Zissowitz] Mr. Lubrani, in his speech in the 
Knesset yesterday, the prime minister said Syria is still not 
evincing enough openness and flexibility to permit a 
breakthrough in the talks on the substance of peace. This also 
relates to Hizballah activity, which Syria is allowing to 
continue. What is Syria's policy in Lebanon? 
  [Lubrani] Syria undoubtedly regards Hizballah activity in 
Lebanon as leverage for gaining advantages on its track. 
  [Zissowitz] A report in HA'ARETZ this morning speaks about a 
joint Syrian-Lebanese military operation against Hizballah arms 
caches in Ba'labakk. 
  [Lubrani] I can only say that from what we know, this 
operation can be considered mere cosmetics. They are trying to 
prove that they are doing something, but I know nothing about 
such a thing in practice. 
  [Zissowitz] Are there any signs that Syria is trying to curb 
Hizballah attacks against Israel? 
  [Lubrani] Occasionally, as a result of U.S. pressure and in 
order to appease the United States, Syria attempts to curb 
Hizballah, even if only for appearances sake. There have been 
two such cases. During the last elections, there was a period 
of one month without any serious Hizballah attacks. Recently, 
in anticipation of the al-Asad-Clinton summit, complete calm was 
restored. Syria can stop Hizballah attacks if it wants to. 
  [Zissowitz] What about the SLA's [South Lebanese Army] 
operations? This organization suffered many casualties in 
battles against Hizballah last weekend. Civilians were also 
killed. Is the SLA's morale flagging? 
  [Lubrani] The SLA is undoubtedly facing a process of 
attrition. Both Hizballah and the rejectionist organizations 
are trying to undermine the SLA and the security zone. The SLA 
is having a hard time dealing with this situation, but it is 
continuing to function and is manning its posts. The SLA is our 
spearhead in maintaining calm along our northern border. 
  [Zissowitz] Is there any truth to the reports that the SLA 
is bitter over the fact that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is 
limiting its ability to react to the terrorists' provocations? 
  [Lubrani] There is some truth to these reports. It is only 
natural, however, that they would prefer to react much more 
firmly to attacks on them. On the other hand, they know that 
our actions are aimed at trying to preserve the understandings 
we reached with the Syrians via the Americans. Most of the 
time, they refrain from reacting, even when they are provoked to 
retaliate. Sometimes such outbursts do occur, such as the 
attack on Sidon last Friday. 
  [Zissowitz] There were reports of a massacre perpetrated by 
the SLA in the village of 'Aramta. 
  [Lubrani] There was no such massacre. It was invented by 
Lebanese and Syrian information circles, who turned Hizballah 
attacks in 'Aramta -- which hit the civilian population 
primarily -- into an SLA attack against the population of this 
village. This is an outright lie. 
  [Zissowitz] Are you completely satisfied with continuing the 
cooperation and coordination between the IDF and SLA? 
  [Lubrani] I have no doubt that the coordination and 
cooperation will continue. There are easy periods and more 
difficult periods. We have already been through such periods. 
We must realize, however, that we are in the midst of a war of 
attrition aimed not only at the SLA but at the IDF as well. The 
SLA is bearing a very heavy load, and we must realize this fact 
and deal with it accordingly. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Let us turn to the Middle East. After having 
ordered the closure of the occupied territories for 10 days 
following the latest round of massacres, the government in 
Jerusalem has decided to allow some 20,000 Palestinians involved 
in social and humanitarian work to be allowed back in. Prime 
Minister Rabin has also announced a plan for the withdrawal of 
Israeli troops from the Golan Heights. Our correspondent 
Giovanni Bocco interviewed Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres: 
  [Begin recording] [Bocco, in English, translating his own 
question into Italian] The Cairo peace negotiations have 
restarted: When do you think an agreement over Gaza and Jericho 
will be reached? 
  [Peres, in English, with correspondent providing Italian 
translation] It appears to me that both ourselves and the PLO 
are respecting the agreements. I believe that the most 
difficult part of the negotiations has been overcome. The 
majority of the workload is behind us. If all goes well, then 
in two or three weeks time we will leave the Gaza Strip. 
  [Bocco] The international observers are arriving in Hebron. 
There are 35 Italians among these observers: What do you think 
about this? 
  [Peres] I believe that this is an important contribution to 
the peace process. The international presence is truly welcome, 
at least on our part, because it is important in bringing normal 
living conditions to Hebron and for preventing acts of violence. 
This welcome extends to the Italian contingent. 
  [Bocco] What do you think of the arrival of the Palestinian 
police force? 
  [Peres] I think that the Palestinians can and must provide 
security measures. They must police themselves. We cannot be 
the policemen of the Palestinians who have every right to have 
their own security force. We are happy that the police force is 
on its way. You cannot imagine how truthful my words are. [end

  [Excerpts] The Shamgar Commission of Inquiry today heard 
testimony from three Muslim worshipers, who were in the cave at 
the time of the massacre. The first witness to appear told the 
commission that he had heard shooting after Barukh Goldstein had 
been beaten to the ground by Muslims in the cave. Steve Linde 
has details: 
  [Begin Linde recording] The commission's hearings were 
delayed by about an hour this morning, because the three Muslim 
witnesses due to appear, arrived late. Soldiers apparently held 
them up because they did not have the necessary permits to enter 
Jerusalem from Hebron. 
  In nearly three hours of testimony, Hajj Ahmad Muhammad 
complained about the behavior of Jewish worshipers in the Cave 
of the Patriarchs, and gave a detailed account of the February 
25 massacre. Muhammad said after the morning prayers began, he 
heard two loud explosions, immediately followed by automatic 
fire, at which point all the Muslims in the cave fell to the 
floor. He saw the man with the case and earphones who had 
fired, and saw Muslim worshipers who were standing behind him 
attack him and throw him to the floor. [passage omitted] 
  Muhammad shocked the commission when he testified earlier 
that on the night before the massacre, on the Purim holiday, 
settlers had entered the cave drunk. He also said settlers had 
urinated in the cave, but when pressed by the judges, said he 
had only seen Muslim cleaners washing the floor afterwards. 
Judge Eli'ezer Goldberg noted that the witness had not actually 
seen what he was alleging, and he could not accept that Jews, 
who regarded the cave as holy, would defecate inside. 
  The commission of inquiry has held 30 sessions and heard 
testimony from some 100 witnesses. [end recording] 
  Two lawyers have petitioned the High Court of Justice to 
suspend Judge 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Zu'bi from the Shamgar 
Commission. They say al-Zu'bi was quoted in the media as saying 
settlers are the cruelest element in the territories.

  [Text] New York, United Nations, April 19, IRNA -- The 
Contact Group of the Organization of the Islamic Conference 
(OICCG) here Monday [18 April] called for the lifting of arms 
embargo on Bosnian Muslims and reaffirmation of their inherent 
right of self-defense. 
  In its statement issued after an urgent meeting on the 
situation in Gorazde, the OICCG on Bosnia-Herzegovina criticized 
the United Nations and the Security Council for failing to adopt 
effective measures against Serbs brutalities. 
  It said that the failure in undertaking steps against Serbs 
crimes has put into serious question the credibility of the 
secretariat, the Security Council and the credibility of the 
United Nations as a whole. 
  The statement also said that the OICCG has decided to call 
for an emergency session of the OIC and as a whole and for 
meeting of foreign ministers of the group in New York with a 
view to pursuing potential solutions to the Bosnian crisis which 
have thus far not been employed. 
  The OICCG further reaffirmed its support for the just 
struggles of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina to live in freedom 
and harmony and said it stood ever ready to assist the United 
Nations by way of troops and financial contribution to UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Force].

<F P=106> ["Text" of interview with President Husni Mubarak by </F>
unidentified correspondents from ASHAI SHIMBUM and Ashai 
television; place and date not given--first three paragraphs are 
MENA introduction] 
  [Text] Cairo, 18 Apr (MENA) -- President Husni Mubarak has 
expressed the belief that an agreement will be reached between 
the Palestinians and the Israelis on the implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles by the end of April or the first week 
of May at the latest, noting that the Israeli withdrawal will 
begin immediately after that. 
  In an interview with the Japanese newspaper ASAHI SHIMBUN 
and 
Asahi television, President Mubarak said that Palestinian leader 
Yasir 'Arafat is still the leader who enjoys the respect of the 
Palestinians, and that his leadership has not been shaken. Most 
of the Palestinian people respect the leadership of 'Arafat, who 
has sacrificed a great deal for the sake of his homeland. 
  The text of President Mubarak's interview follows: 
  [ASAHI] Mr. President, the target date for Israel's 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on 13 April has passed. What 
were the obstacles that have caused this delay, and which party 
is to blame for it? Can Your Excellency tell us of any specific 
date for the signing of the final agreement? 
  [Mubarak] The 13th of April has indeed passed, and this is 
due to some obstacles in regard to security measures affecting 
the Palestinians and the Israelis, particularly on the border 
between Gaza and Egypt and between the West Bank and Jordan. 
There are some other problems regarding land and how to deal 
with crimes that could occur in any of these areas. There were 
many problems, but the situation is now improving, and the two 
parties are about to solve many of them. I hope that they will 
reach agreement by the end of this month or the first week of 
May at the latest, and immediately after that the withdrawal 
will begin. 
  Regarding the negotiations, you cannot say that the Israelis 
or the Palestinians are responsible for the delay. Both sides 
are responsible. Let us be frank. The Israelis have the land 
but the Palestinians have nothing. Therefore, concessions must 
be made. Problems and obstacles are expected in the 
negotiations, but they must continue because they are the only 
way to establish peace and to solve the problems. I think that 
the two parties are about to reach a settlement on these 
problems. 
  [ASAHI] Mr. President, it appears that Yasir 'Arafat's 
leadership of the Palestinians is shaky because of the delay in 
implementing the Declaration of Principles. What is your 
assessment of his leadership? 
  [Mubarak] We cannot say that 'Arafat's leadership is shaky. 
I can tell you that the assessments of the foreign agencies and 
those who do not live in the area are not totally correct. 
Sometimes these assessments are wrong because of false 
information given the media by some factions that do not want 
peace to prevail or for problems to be solved. 'Arafat is still 
the leader of the PLO and enjoys the respect of the 
Palestinians. You will hear voices here and there. No one can 
expect all the Palestinians to agree on 'Arafat's leadership. 
There is Hamas and other factions. But the majority of the 
people want peace, and respect the leadership of 'Arafat, who 
has sacrificed a great deal for the sake of his homeland. 
  'Arafat is the one who makes the decisions. There is a 
council that assists him. He discusses all points with the 
council, but he makes the decisions on the basis of the 
discussions with the council, the PLO Executive Committee. 
Therefore, the man is strong. Had there been another man now, I 
do not think it would have been possible to reach a settlement. 
  [ASAHI] You met recently with Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad. What is your assessment of President al-Asad's real 
intentions regarding the peace process with Israel, what are the 
major obstacles hindering peace between Syria and Israel, and 
how optimistic are you about making progress in the 
Syrian-Israeli peace talks? 
  [Mubarak] Although the major problem hindering the 
Syrian-Israeli negotiations is represented by the lack of 
confidence between the two sides, I can frankly say that 
President al-Asad wants to reach a peaceful settlement, recover 
the Golan Heights, and find a very fair agreement. There is no 
way other than negotiations to achieve peace. 
  Every leader is eager to see peace prevail in his country so 
that he can dedicate all his efforts to his people's prosperity 
and provide job opportunities for all so the people can have a 
chance to live and work in peace. The same thing goes for 
Israel. But the lack of confidence I mentioned before raises 
some doubts among the Israelis. Through my contacts with both 
sides, I can see that both want to reach a peaceful settlement 
through negotiations. 
  Let us be realistic. The Golan Heights must be returned 
fully to Syria, otherwise there will be a major obstacle to 
peace, not only with Syria, but with all the other parties as 
well. 
  This issue is important, very important. The Syrians will 
never agree to sign a peace accord unless they regain their 
occupied territories. We did the same thing; we did not 
relinquish an inch of our territories. It is not the leaders 
who say that; the public urge the leaders not to make any 
concessions, not even an inch of land. 
  [ASAHI] Egypt has played an important role in the Middle 
East 
peace process. At present, you play a central role in the peace 
negotiations. What kind of role is Egypt likely to play to 
reach a comprehensive, peaceful settlement in the Middle East? 
  [Mubarak] We are helping on all fronts. Egypt is a major 
state in this region; it is the biggest regional state. It 
regained its occupied lands through negotiations, war, more 
negotiations, and then the International Court of Justice. We 
have much experience in that field and we know how to negotiate. 
Negotiations involving land are very difficult and complicated. 
We are trying to narrow the differences between the Israelis 
and Palestinians, and even between the Israelis and the Syrians 
and between the Israelis and the other parties. 
  As far as the Palestinian problem is concerned, we are 
helping the Palestinians, we support the peace process, and we 
are trying hard to bring the views of the PLO and the Israeli 
Government closer. I believe that what we did brought the 
parties together in Oslo and then in Cairo. The parties are 
holding negotiations in Cairo at present. I hope these 
negotiations will produce an agreement soon. 
  [ASAHI] The problem of the settlements in the occupied 
territories seems to be very hard to solve. How can this 
problem be solved in your view? 
  [Mubarak] This is a very hard and complex question. When the 
second framework of the Camp David accord on the Palestinian 
problem and settlements was signed, the number of settlements 
was 48, all of which were small. There are 180 big settlements 
at present. This will be the major obstacle in the coming phase 
of negotiations for a comprehensive peace settlement. I hope a 
good solution will be found for this problem through 
negotiations. 
  [ASAHI] What kind of solution? 
  [Mubarak] I cannot speak on behalf of either the 
Palestinians 
or the Israelis. We will do our utmost to examine the various 
options and ideas on both sides with the help of the United 
States and others. We will try to narrow the gap between the 
two sides to find a solution to this very complex problem. 
  Had the problem been addressed in 1978 it would have been 
much easier. With 48 small settlements, many could have been 
removed and settlers could have found some other job. But what 
are they going to do now when there are 180 settlements? It is 
a major problem, both for the Palestinians and the Israelis. 
  [ASAHI] What is the Egyptian strategy to expand the peace 
process? 
  [Mubarak] Negotiations are proceeding with the Palestinians 
right now over the first phase. Then there will be a timetable 
for negotiations on the final status of the occupied 
territories. In the meantime, the Israelis are negotiating with 
the Syrians on returning the occupied Golan Heights. There are 
some small problems with Jordan. I believe that all these 
negotiations will eventually reach a final settlement. 
  [ASAHI] Through Egypt's mediation? 
  [Mubarak] I told you from the beginning that Egypt is 
playing 
the role of mediator and that some of Egypt's efforts have not 
been publicized. We do not disclose them to the media. Some 
parties release certain information that we do not want to 
reveal to the media because they might ruin or complicate 
negotiations. We are doing our utmost. 
  [ASAHI] When do you think a comprehensive peace agreement 
will be concluded? 
  [Mubarak] We hope this will happen in 1994. There must be an 
agreement with the Syrians, the Palestinians, and all the 
parties concerned. I hope so. I am very optimistic. 
  [ASAHI] What is your assessment of the situation concerning 
terrorism? 
  [Mubarak] Terrorism exists in Egypt just like it does all 
over the world. It is everywhere right now. 
  As far as Egypt is concerned, we ruled out a dialogue with 
these criminals--I cannot describe them as Muslims. They have 
been criminals since 1981, and in 1992 they started to use force 
to kill civilians. The Egyptian police are not accustomed to 
killing anyone, except in self-defense. When these criminals 
started to attack the police and civilians on the streets here 
and there, the police had to be more effective. The police are 
responsible to public opinion; they have to safeguard domestic 
peace. Therefore, the situation must be under their control. 
We have no concerns in this connection. The problem is that 
these people are being financed by foreign quarters, probably 
Egyptians or persons from other states who used to fight in 
Afghanistan. Many of them are in Yemen at present. 
  [ASAHI] Can you specify the names of these states? 
  [Mubarak] I have told you that I generally do not reveal all 
the information available to me. But everybody knows this all 
over the world. Ask the Jordanians and all the states that have 
terrorism. Terrorism exists in Turkey, in your country, Japan, 
in the United States, Germany, France, Asia, everywhere. 
  [ASAHI] What is the reason for the sudden postponement of 
your visit to Japan? 
  [Mubarak] It was not sudden. The prime minister resigned and 
the government is busy selecting a new prime minister. It is 
not proper to visit Japan at such a time; they have not 
appointed a prime minister. He might be appointed today; and 
the visit was supposed to begin today. I could not have gone 
there while the government was experiencing a change. Your 
parliament will still have to approve the appointment, probably 
on Wednesday. Therefore, I believe that it is difficult. The 
public would ask me why I visited Japan when there was no 
government there. But relations between Egypt and Japan are 
good. The sudden postponement was due to the sudden resignation 
of the prime minister. 
  [ASAHI] Will you visit Japan in the near future? 
  [Mubarak] Certainly. Once the new government takes over we 
will fix another date to visit Japan. 
  [ASAHI] Do you believe that Japan should play a bigger role 
in this region? 
  [Mubarak] I believe that it has a quite significant role in 
this connection. It can at least contribute to the region's 
development. I am talking about the occupied territories in our 
region, including Syria and all the equally-important states. 
  That is how we look to Japan. This kind of contribution is 
very effective in developing the states that will constitute the 
foundation of the modern age after peace has been established. 
I believe that Japan is capable of playing a very significant 
role in developing this part of the world. 
  [ASAHI] The Palestinians and Chairman 'Arafat are frustrated 
by the delay in implementing the agreement, while the Israelis 
are indifferent to that delay. What are your observations on 
this difference in positions? 
  [Mubarak] It is a political game.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the </F>
Political Bureau of Hamas, by Samaih al-Ma'ayitah; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Ma'ayitah] What has prompted the Zionist 
leadership to launch these threats against Jordan and Hamas? 
  [Abu-Marzuq] It is the Movement's basic and strong presence 
among the Palestinian people. The Movement's cadres and 
organizations are in the occupied territories. The presence 
outside these territories is natural, be it in the form of 
supporters, spokesmen, or official spokesmen in the Movement's 
name. It has political and information presence in most states 
of the region. However, as a result of his failure to suppress 
or confront the Movement or stop its armed operations, Rabin 
tried to hold external sides responsible for these actions so 
that the Israelis would not have great room for criticizing his 
policies and exposing his shortcomings and his inability to 
provide peace and security for them. 
  This is not the first time that Rabin has shifted the 
responsibility for his policies on to outside parties. When the 
soldier Toledano was kidnapped, Israel accused the United States 
of sponsoring Hamas leaders and accused Syria of sponsoring the 
Movement. Now it is directing these false accusations against 
Jordan. I must express my astonishment because the U.S. 
Administration supports these allegations and accusations while 
knowing that they are incorrect. The United States responded to 
Israeli's accusations in early 1993 denying the presence of any 
Hamas leaders on its territory and proved that the Movement's 
military operations are planned and executed inside Palestine. 
Here we must emphasize the following: 
  1. The Hamas Movement has confined its battle in Palestine 
as an occupied territory and we have the right to resist with 
all means available to us. The Movement has been committed to 
this. 
  2. Rabin's accusations reveal the enemy's inability to 
confront Hamas and its attempt to instigate our brothers against 
it. 
  3. The 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam battalions have always 
announced their responsibility for their operations inside 
Palestine by various means, such as leaving a leaflet at the 
site of the battle, announcing the operation by graffiti or 
through a loudspeaker, contacting news agencies, or distributing 
leaflets bearing the signature of the battalions. As for 
statements by its representatives abroad, they are merely 
comments and affirmations of the Movement's methods. This also 
happened after the recent operation. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] What is happening demonstrates the state of 
confusion in the Zionist enemy leadership. They cannot find a 
place or a Hamas group to retaliate against as they do in 
Lebanon against the Lebanese and Palestinian resistance. It is 
also a continuation of the series of pressures against Jordan to 
compel it to sign a separate peace agreement. 
  [Abu-Marzuq] Israel does not know where to strike at Hamas 
within its policy of deterrence. The Hamas Movement and 
military apparatus are in Palestine. They directed several 
blows at it in 1989, in late 1990, and in 1993 and were unable 
to limit the Movement's military activities. This created a 
crisis in the Zionist entity and this prompted it to choose 
Jordan as a means to shift responsibility to it. It is worth 
noticing that for the first time, Rabin and his Foreign 
Minister, Peres, appeared at press conference at the same time. 
Rabin's words were very strong in his capacity as minister of 
defense and interior, something which only made his failure 
worse. Peres' expressions were calmer because he knows that 
these threats are part of the political game. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] There are attempts to raise Jordanian fears 
concerning the seriousness of Hamas activity in the Jordanian 
arena. Some people try to substantiate these fears by citing 
the history of Jordan's relationship with PLO factions. Are 
these fears likely to materialize with regard to the Hamas 
Movement? 
  [Abu-Marzuq] We believe that the security and stability of 
any Arab country, particularly Jordan, plays a role in 
supporting Palestinian rights. On the other hand, destabilizing 
any Arab country will have a negative effect on the Palestinian 
cause. We have seen this repeatedly and the result was that 
Arab weakness has adversely affected the Palestine question. 
  We are aware that Jordan is facing difficult circumstances 
and many pressures which we understand. We also assert that 
Jordan's position on the reckless Zionist threats was 
distinguished and deserves thanking. 
  We, from a position of responsibility, will not give our 
enemy an excuse to fish in troubled water and will adopt 
appropriate measures and steps in this connection to safeguard 
Jordan's security and stability. 
  We do not carry out military action from outside. As for the 
statements that talk about the five revenge operations, they 
were contained in statements issued by the ['Izz-al-Din] 
al-Qassam Battalions in Palestine. Other statements only 
reiterated this. 
  We think that there are no grounds whatsoever for these 
fears 
because we are concerned about Jordanian cohesion and the 
security and stability of this country. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] Do you feel that Jordan understands this 
position? 
  [Abu-Marzuq] The Jordanian Government is certain that the 
credibility of the Hamas movement is high and it has never felt 
anything that contravenes this policy. It knows for sure that 
the official spokesman or the Movement's representative in 
Jordan have no connection with any action inside Palestine. 
They know, and everybody else knows, that the Movement and its 
military presence as a whole are inside Palestine. Therefore, 
Jordan is in a strong position to reject these threats because 
it stems from its sincere stand and actual practice. Therefore, 
I think that the Jordanian Government understands the Movement's 
position. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] Is the Movement going to adopt any measures 
in light of the Zionists' threats Zionists to Jordan? 
  [Abu-Marzuq] Basically, we will not allow any justifications 
for the enemy to fish in troubled water. This is in addition to 
some measures that have to do with the Movement itself, which we 
are going to take into consideration in the future, God willing, 
so as not to embarrass Jordan in these difficult circumstances. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] How do you view Jordan's position on the 
recent threats? 
  [Abu-Marzuq] I think that Jordan's reply to Israeli threats 
was strong and characterized by frankness and objectivity. The 
Movement had no official offices to begin with. The government 
officially deals with the PLO. Jordan has not dealt with us as 
representatives of the Palestinian people, and we have not 
claimed to be so. We represent part of the Palestinian people, 
but we do not recognize PLO representation of all the 
Palestinian people. Jordan's position was open and objective and 
it reflects actual reality. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] Given the international, Arab, and 
Palestinian situation, it seems that Hamas is approaching a 
fierce war with the Zionist enemy and its allies, particularly 
in the PLO leadership. It stands alone in confronting the 
Zionist enemy militarily at a time when the rest of the 10 
factions opposing the current settlement process are 
unjustifiably absent. The question is how will Hamas confront 
this fierce war? 
  [Abu-Marzuq] We realize that since the first setback [the 
1948 Arab-Israeli war], the Palestinian people have been facing 
successive plots and making large sacrifices. The Hamas 
Movement is part of these people and derives its strength--after 
depending on Almighty God--from the people's resolve to continue 
their jihad until they attain their hopes and aspirations and 
regain their land. We are aware of the seriousness of the next 
stage and it is the same seriousness the Palestinian people 
faced at various historical stages in Palestine and elsewhere. 
  What is new in this regard is that part of the Palestinian 
people chose another path for reasons with which we differ. 
These differences, however, will not affect the Palestinian 
people's resistance of occupation. I believe that the current 
attempts to resolve the conflict will not be successful because 
they neither deal with the crux of the issue nor remove the 
causes of the conflict. This means the conflict will continue. 
We will not transfer the conflict to the Palestinian arena and 
will continue to deal with this conflict as sons of the 
Palestinian people regardless of differences in opinion. We 
hope they will deal with the Palestinian arena in the same way. 
The Movement will continue its jihad. We, like them, are 
suffering from oppression and imprisonment and we will continue 
to make sacrifices and pay the price of freedom. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] Following the implementation of the full or 
partial autonomy, two facts will emerge: resistance of 
occupation, which will be pursued by Hamas, and the autonomy 
institutions and the Palestinian people's living aspects. How 
will Hamas coexist with these institutions and the living and 
servicing aspects? 
  [Abu-Marzuq] We are part of the Palestinian people and 
cannot 
ignore their interests and causes, which we will continue to 
defend. We will also continue to be an active element in all 
areas of life, including education, economy, and services, 
whether inside or outside the framework of autonomy. 
  As for the political issue, that is, the administrative 
autonomy and normalization, we will certainly not deal with them 
positively. We will not participate in building the institutions 
that do not serve the Palestinian people unless these 
institutions go beyond the designated framework and begin to 
express the Palestinian people's ambitions. The Movement can 
then live up to the stage and serve the Palestinian people 
through the same framework. We will then not create many 
difficulties for those administrations and will be careful to 
direct our efforts toward fighting the enemy. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] Even if the autonomy institutions dealt with 
Hamas as an illegal and outlawed organization? 
  [Abu-Marzuq] I think it is difficult for the autonomy 
institutions to do so. We are part of the Palestinian people, 
not a simple part which can be chased. Consequently, it will be 
difficult for them to take such a step and I do not think they 
will make such a reckless decision. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] The Political Bureau of Hamas issued a 
political statement in which a paragraph reads: "Any peace in 
the region must be based on Israeli withdrawal from the occupied 
territories and holding free elections in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip to elect representatives of the Palestinian people who 
will decide the next steps and the future of the [Palestine] 
question." Does this mean that developing the present formula of 
the settlement will win the approval of the Hamas Movement? 
  [Abu-Marzuq] As a resistance movement, we think that if the 
enemy government wants to end the ordeal it is experiencing, 
then this cannot take place by imposing surrender on the 
Palestinian people. What we are saying is that there could be a 
peace treaty or a truce in order to rescue the region from its 
complex situation and end this crisis. 
  The resolutions of international legitimacy have considered 
the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem occupied 
territories owned by the Palestinian people who live on these 
territories. If they want the resistance to stop this very 
minute, then what is required: 
  1. The withdrawal of the Zionist forces from the West Bank, 
the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem. 
  2. The dismantling of the settlements. 
  3. Compensation for the losses and victims as a result of 
the 
occupation. 
  4. Holding free elections so that the Palestinian people 
will 
elect a leadership that will express the aspirations of the 
Palestinian people and the future of the conflict. If the 
Movement gets elected, then it has its own clear stand toward 
the conflict. However, it it wins a minority of votes, then it 
will express its views freely and we will respect the opinion of 
the elected majority. 
  What we are offering is a way out of the current 
predicament. 
The PLO is negotiating with the Zionist enemy on foundations 
which we do not think are correct. The party that has a right 
to present views regarding the future of the conflict must be an 
elected leadership that represents the Palestinian people. 
  We do not mind seeing the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and 
Jerusalem under the supervision of international troops, 
Palestinian police, or the Arab administrations which had 
previous control over these territories or of which these 
territories were a part before the 1967 aggression. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] Is this a political initiative? 
  [Abu-Marzuq] You can call it this way if you like. You can 
also say this is the Movement's vision to end the predicament, 
if you like. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] "The killing of civilians" is rejected 
internationally. Why did Hamas do this in the 'Afula and Hadera 
operations? 
  [Abu-Marzuq] Over the past years, the al-Qassam Battalions 
have been committed to their right to resisting the occupation 
troops and the settler militias, and they have never violated 
this rule. However, the occupation troops have been killing our 
children, women, and old men. Also, the occupation troops do 
not stop the inhuman practices of the settlers, whose peak was 
the killing of dozens of people at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. This 
crime was not enough for them. A series of other crimes 
followed in the same city, and curfew was imposed on the victim. 
The occupation troops also let the criminal wolves free in the 
land and gave them a free hand to kill the sons of our people, 
to the extent that they did not spare a woman in her third month 
of pregnancy and the baby which she was trying to protect. This 
is in addition to shooting schoolchildren in Bethlehem, injuring 
nine of them. 
  All of this has prompted the battalions to treat the enemy 
the same way, and this is approved by international law and 
divine law until the troops and settlers stop killing the 
unarmed sons of our people. Then, the Battalions will go back 
to their policy of resisting the occupation.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Commerce ministers from 125 countries started a 
four-day meeting in Marrakech, Morocco, which will close with 
the signing of the GATT. This document is over 20,000 pages 
long and considered the most important commercial agreement in 
history. Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche is representing 
Mexico. 
  Moroccan Crown Prince Sidi Mohamed delivered a welcoming 
speech to open the meeting, which will conclude Friday with the 
signing of the final draft of the GATT. The crown prince 
arrived at 1000 sharp, representing his father, Hassan II. More 
than 120 representatives of GATT member countries arrived 
simultaneously at the Marrakech Convention Center to participate 
in the final meetings. The Mexican delegation was among them. 
  Speaking shortly before the plenum, Jaime Serra Puche, 
Mexico's secretary of commerce and industrial development, 
stressed important aspects of our times. He said that 
reciprocal commercial opening and greater competition among 
production plants [plantas] will prompt us to increase the 
scales of production and to redistribute revenue margins. This 
is how the Uruguay Round will promote the creation of new jobs 
and increase the salaries of our workers, he added. 
  [Begin Serra recording] Mexico is convinced that the new 
world commerce organization must focus on three main actions: 
  1. Deepening reciprocal commerce liberalization by 
eliminating barriers and distortions that are still standing in 
various productive sectors. 
  2. Updating and improving the various areas [disciplinas] 
of the multilateral system of commerce to rid them of unilateral 
measures and reverting protectionist trends. 
  3. Ensuring an appropriate interaction between the 
competition policy and commercial measures to fight unfair 
practices. [end recording] 
  Secretary Jaime Serra Puche also advocated respect for the 
environment and protection of labor rights.

<F P=106> [Article by Randah Taqiy-al-Din in Paris] </F>
  [Text] An informed French source has told AL-HAYAH that the 
two French oil companies, Elf Aquitaine and Total, can now sign 
a contract on oil exploration and development in the Iraqi oil 
fields of Nahr 'Umar, Total's area of operations, and Majnun, 
Elf Aquitaine's area of operations, despite the international 
embargo clamped on Iraq. 
  The source added that the contract, after it is signed, will 
only be implemented after the post-embargo phase. He said that 
signing a contract that cannot be immediately implemented does 
not require a political decision but a decision by the two 
companies. 
  The source pointed out that the only obstacle to signature 
now is the fact that negotiations with the Iraqi side have not 
yet ended, especially with regard to the terms of participation 
in exploration and development in the two oil fields. He 
explained that the visit to Paris by an Iraqi oil delegation led 
by Tahir Hammud, the Iraqi deputy oil minister, was confined to 
reviewing technical issues and that no actual negotiations were 
held between the two sides. He said that if the embargo on Iraq 
is lifted, it would take approximately two years before 
production begins in the Nahr 'Umar and Majnun oil fields. He 
described the production capacity of the two oil fields as 
important. 
  It is noteworthy that several French officials were eager to 
reiterate that despite these negotiations and talks no oil 
contract would be signed with Iraq as long as the international 
embargo is valid. 
  In another development, Lee Hamilton, head of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, has 
accused President Bill Clinton's administration of violating the 
economic embargo imposed on Iraq by indirectly purchasing fuel 
from Iraqi oil refineries for use in transportation and heating 
purposes in Kurdish areas in northern Iraq.

<F P=106> [News conference by Information Minister Michel Samahah with </F>
unidentified correspondents at the Presidential Palace in B'abda 
on 19 Apr--recorded] 
  [Text] [Samahah] At the invitation of his excellency the 
president of the Republic, after his agreement with the prime 
minister, the Council of Ministers held an extraordinary meeting 
in the Presidential Palace in B'abda this evening. 
  The Council of Ministers was informed in detail of the 
circumstances surrounding the assassination of Shaykh Talib 
Suhayl in his home. There was an appropriate investigation into 
the crime, evidence was found, and testimony was taken. 
  As shown in the minutes of the meeting between the Iraqi 
charge d'affaires, at his request, with defendants Khalid 'Ulwan 
Khalaf and Muhammad Faris Kadhim in the presence of the Beirut 
police commander and his two aides, the two defendants confessed 
that they committed the crime on orders faxed to them from 
Baghdad. Both of them are active employees of the Iraqi 
Intelligence Directorate. 
  Despite hearing the two defendants' confession that they had 
carried out the crime on the orders of their leaders in Baghdad, 
the Foreign Ministry was notified by the Iraqi charge d'affaires 
that his government objects to lifting the immunity of these two 
employees. 
  In view of his insistence on not handing over the third and 
fourth defendants, who both work for the embassy's intelligence 
service; to avoid the occurrence of such crimes on our 
territories; and out of concern for insuring the safety of 
Lebanese citizens and all those residing in Lebanon, after due 
deliberation the Lebanese Government regrets that this approach 
was taken toward Lebanon now that it has restored peace and 
security. Some parties--including regrettably, an Arab state 
like Iraq--insist on violating all the established rules and 
norms by treating Lebanon as though it was an arena for foreign 
intelligence entities. This violates the Vienna agreement, 
which obliges diplomats to respect the laws of the countries 
where they are accredited. Therefore, the Lebanese Government 
has made the following decisions: 
  1. To sever diplomatic ties with the Iraqi state and to 
order the Foreign Ministry to request the Iraqi charge 
d'affaires and embassy staff to depart this country within 72 
hours; and to reiterate the Lebanese Government's demand to hand 
over all the persons wanted in connection with this crime; 
  2. To ask the justice minister to emphasize the need for 
the competent judicial authorities to follow up on the 
investigations and expose whoever is connected to this crime and 
the activity of this apparatus, be they Lebanese or any other 
nationality. 
  3. Lebanon, which values the fraternal relations with the 
brotherly Iraqi people, rejects any tampering with its 
sovereignty, security and stability, and any violation of 
diplomatic norms. The Lebanese Government will inform Arab and 
international quarters of its decisions in this regard. 
  The cabinet also discussed the rising tension in the south 
as 
a result of the repeated Israeli aggression against the 
defenseless residents of the southern cities and villages. His 
excellency the prime minister reviewed the recent developments 
and the contacts in this regard in a bid to deter Israel's 
aggression. The Cabinet reiterated its full support for the 
southerners and the need to provide all the necessary 
requirements for their steadfastness in the face of this 
aggression, stressing that all facilities will be made available 
to them to enhance their steadfastness and help them remain 
there. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] 
  [Samahah] It is premature to answer this question. However, 
it is clear from the statement that there are some people 
residing in Lebanon who have committed a crime on Lebanese 
territory. A certain state, by issuing certain orders, has 
carried out aggression against Lebanon. 
  [Correspondent] What about the Lebanese community in Iraq 
following the severing of ties? 
  [Samahah] The status of the Lebanese community in Iraq 
should 
be that of a community living in a country that is supposed to 
respect international law and treat those living on its 
territory in accordance with international law and all 
international agreements. 
  [Correspondent] Does the Lebanese Government intend to 
[words 
indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] You can find the answer to this question in our 
statement. We are still calling for the third and fourth 
defendants to be handed over to Lebanese judicial authorities. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] affect the joint 
interests 
of the two countries? 
  [Samahah] Following the aggression that has taken place, I 
believe that the matter has gone beyond concern over the joint 
interests and become a flagrant and direct aggression against 
Lebanon. 
  [Correspondent] How would you describe the situation 
following the attacks on Sidon, the recent escalation, and the 
U.S. message that Lebanon has received? Do you expect an 
escalation? 
  [Samahah] Whenever an Israeli Government faces an internal 
political problem or whenever world public opinion or the 
world's decisionmaking centers tend to sympathize with Arab 
rights, particularly Lebanon's, to regain their territories, the 
situation in the south becomes tense and Israel constantly 
escalates its aggression from the its occupied area in the south 
against the people, land, and property in the liberated 
territory. 
  [Correspondent] Is it true that there was a U.S. warning 
of a possible Israeli attack against the south? 
  [Samahah] The United States tried to explain what is 
happening in the south and to calm the situation through 
contacts with Lebanon and Israel. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] 
  [Samahah] The Lebanese Government's response is very clear. 
We have no responsibility regarding the occupation. We have a 
responsibility to end it. Therefore, we have repeatedly 
demanded that UN Security Council Resolution 425 be implemented. 
When we regain sovereignty over our land in the south and the 
western al-Biqa', the security issue will be resolved. We are 
not the aggressors. Israel is occupying our land, and is 
attacking other parts of Lebanon from the occupied area. Any 
approach to us or any accusation made against us is 
unacceptable. We are not Israel's policemen. The international 
community must serve as a force to bring justice and restore the 
complete rights of Lebanon, the other Arab states, and the 
Palestinian people. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] 
  [Samahah] We are awaiting the outcome of the investigation. 
  [Correspondent] Have you decided which Arab state will care 
for Lebanon's interests in Iraq after the break in relations? 
  [Samahah] No decision has yet been made in this regard. The 
Foreign Ministry will pursue this matter. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, with regard to [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] The officials responsible for these stations are 
fully aware of the controls, what a news report on economic 
activity means, and where the line should be drawn. So far no 
one has committed any violation in this regard. I am confident 
that all the media officials are capable, are aware of the 
seriousness of this period, and are aware of the importance of 
respecting the Council of Minister's decision. Let us cooperate 
to create a serious and secure atmosphere in the country. We 
are surrounded by major concerns at this time, and face grave 
dangers, such as the recent Iraqi attack, what is happening in 
the south, what is happening at home regarding the confiscation 
of large quantities of weapons and ammunition from various 
parties in various parts of Lebanon. 
  This process will continue. We are working on the media law, 
which we hope will not take long. Then matters will return to 
normal with the exercise of all liberties. The exercise of 
liberties goes on today. The Lebanese print media is operating 
normally within the law; and through them all Lebanese can 
express their views. This is in addition to the official media. 
  Our citizens want to be free mentally and psychologically of 
the state of war that has existed until recently and move to a 
state of law and order. They want to exercise their liberties 
and democracy under laws that are prepared by the Government and 
are legislated by the Chamber of Deputies for the good and 
interest of the Lebanese people. The Lebanese Constitution is 
based on respect of freedoms and respect of belief, personal 
freedom, expression. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] 
  [Samahah, in English] The Lebanese Government has just cut 
its diplomatic relations with the Iraq state, and the minister 
of foreign affairs will tell the Iraqi diplomats tomorrow 
morning that they have 72 hours to be out of the Lebanese 
territories. We think that the Iraqi Government giving orders 
to some of its personnel in Lebanon to kill Arab citizens living 
in Lebanon has committed, has perpetrated, an aggression to 
Lebanon from one side, and has violated the Vienna Accord from 
another side. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto by Gaby </F>
Neujahr; place and date not given: "We Do Not Want To Build 
Nuclear Weapons"] 
  [Text] [Neujahr] In the election campaign you promised 
prosperity and economic growth. How do you intend to keep this 
promise? 
  [Bhutto] This is our biggest problem. When I assumed 
office, the economy was in a desolate state. The budget deficit 
was high, the public sector inflated, the social sector 
neglected, and the infrastructure underdeveloped. 
  The top priority is to stimulate the economy. From July to 
December we reduced the trade deficit by $260 million, foreign 
investment increased by 54 percent, and our foreign currency 
reserves rose from $200 million to $1.2 billion. 
  [Neujahr] How do your ambitious plans fit in with a defense 
budget that swallows up 50 percent of the overall budget? 
  [Bhutto] I would like to make one thing clear: Pakistan has 
never put 50 percent of its budget into defense. We have always 
spent between 25 and 27 percent on defense. Over recent years 
the expenditure has even declined a little, in contrast to the 
rising defense budget in India. 
  It is our top priority to improve the people's economic 
situation. 
  [Neujahr] Your relationship with neighboring India continues 
to be tense. Talks to settle the conflict over Kashmir have not 
yet brought a solution. 
  [Bhutto] First of all, India must reduce its policy of 
oppression in the Indian part of Kashmir so as to create a 
favorable climate for the negotiations. 
  If we do not make progress in bilateral negotiations then, 
both countries should consider other ways and mediation by a 
third party. 
  [Neujahr] When the Kashmir conflict escalated in 1990, U.S. 
President Bush was narrowly able to prevent nuclear war between 
India and Pakistan. Does Pakistan want to establish itself as a 
nuclear power? 
  [Bhutto] We do not want to become a nuclear state. We are 
against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, because they 
endanger peace and security. 
  Our nuclear program must be viewed from the proper 
perspective. The use of nuclear energy and the peaceful use of 
nuclear science are important for our economic development. We 
want to use the power of the atom only peacefully and not build 
any weapons. 
  [Neujahr] Will you sign the Nonproliferation Treaty? 
  [Bhutto] We are willing to sign the Nonproliferation Treaty 
together with India. We can accept the safety checks by the IEA 
(International Energy Agency) in all nuclear facilities in 
Pakistan and India. 
  However, we do not accept any conditions that apply only to 
Pakistan and leave out India, which has just been testing 
nuclear weapons. 
  [Neujahr] In 1990 you were driven from office with insults 
and outrage. You were accused of corruption and of abuse of 
office. Have these accusations been clarified? 
  [Bhutto] At that time more than a dozen accusations were 
made against my husband and myself and these were dealt with by 
summary courts. No court found any proof of the accusations. 
Almost all the accusations have been thrown out. 
  [Neujahr] How fragile is your multiparty coalition? 
  [Bhutto] There are no problems, neither rifts nor trenches. 
  [Neujahr] What kind of influence have the fundamentalist 
Islamic parties? 
  [Bhutto] The term "fundamentalist" comes from the West and 
is linked with other associations there. Islam teaches 
tolerance and peaceful coexistence with other religions. 
  We have had religious parties since 1947 but they are of 
little importance in the National Assembly. At the elections in 
1993 the Islamic Front, which consists of Jamaat-e-Islami and 
other religious parties, won only three out of 200 seats. The 
people in Pakistan do not want to entrust these groups with any 
political power.

<F P=106> [Report by Fahd al-Rimawi] </F>
  [Text] The Israeli war machine could not stand long in the 
face of some youths from Palestine whose belief in God and 
strong will made them decide to go for martyrdom. 
  The Zionist Army, armed to the teeth by the most 
sophisticated U.S. weapons and with its most active intelligence 
organs, was helpless. It could not prevent the Hamas Movement 
from transferring its impressive, qualitative operations to the 
heart of Israel in 'Afula, Hadera, Haifa, and God knows where 
else. 
  In only a few days or weeks, the voice of weapons 
overshadowed the hoarse talk about peace. Military and jihad 
action outshone the idle talk of the negotiations and the dozens 
of sessions and meetings that started more than two years ago in 
Madrid and are still revolving in a vicious circle without 
making any progress at all. 
  For all these reasons, the Israeli government, facing the 
threat of collapse under the strikes of Hamas, chose to shift 
its losing battle to the political level and to the Jordanian 
arena. 
  War is a continuation of politics by using other means. The 
opposite holds true. The Rabin government is trying at this 
time to survive and stay in power by reactivating foreign 
operations. These operations will be undertaken by the Mosad to 
liquidate Hamas leaders in Arab states. The Rabin government is 
also trying to export its crisis to the Jordanian arena, which 
is liable to explosion if the government was forced to clash 
with Hamas, which has strong support from Jordan's 
political-Islamic street in general, and the Muslim Brotherhood 
in particular. 
  Information available to Egyptian and PLO security agencies 
indicates clearly that the Mosad's plans to assassinate Hamas 
leaders abroad are now ready for implementation. This prompted 
several Arab and Islamic states, including Jordan, to instate 
heavy security measures to protect the Hamas leaders. Those 
countries have also asked the Hamas leaders to observe maximum 
caution. 
  Despite the fact that Jordan has rejected the Zionist logic 
of threats and responded to the rude threats of Rabin and Peres, 
Interior Minister Salamah Hammad has summoned Muhammad Nazzal, 
Hamas representative in Jordan, and Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah, 
the official spokesman of the Movement, to his office several 
times. He asked them politely, but firmly, to take Jordan's 
circumstances into consideration and halt any political or media 
activity on its territory. 
  The U.S. ambassador in Amman had earlier asked the Jordanian 
government to deport Nazzal and Ghawshah, in response to an 
Israeli desire. The government, however, strongly rejected this 
demand, proceeding from its concern about Jordan's national 
sovereignty and the right to citizenship which Nazzal and 
Ghawshah enjoy, since they bear Jordanian nationality. This is 
in addition to the strong relationship between Jordan and Hamas, 
since the 'Arafat organization snubbed Jordan in favor of a new 
relationship with Israel. 
  AL-MAJD has learned from its own sources that the Interior 
Ministry has seized the passports of Nazzal, Ghawshah, and other 
Hamas members who have Jordanian nationality. However, no one 
at the Hamas office in Amman could confirm or deny the news, in 
reply to several queries by the AL-MAJD to the Hamas office, 
having failed to contact Ghawshah and Nazzal, who are apparently 
denying their presence to avoid answering reporters who are 
following with extreme interest the developments of the 
situation between the government and Hamas.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nabih Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber </F>
of Deputies, by Salim 'Ali Dhiyab, in Amman on 17 April -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Dhiyab] Mr. Speaker, how would you describe your 
meeting with his majesty the king? 
  [Birri] In fact, I have had the honor today, as you know, of 
meeting with his majesty the king. This meeting was amicable, 
open, and deep, in which we discussed most issues and 
developments in the Arab, regional, and international arenas. 
Emphasis was placed on the pressures that sisterly Jordan is 
facing, and the military pressure to which Lebanon is subjected 
in its southern areas and in the western Biqa', and the brutal 
shelling that is taking place daily against our kinsfolk the 
civilians there. His majesty believes--and he is right in 
this--that these pressures are similar, and what is wanted from 
Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon is for them to deal separately with 
Israel and then to sign agreements with the Israeli enemy 
without consulting the other parties. This would wastes what is 
left of Arab rights. His majesty the king is determined and 
insistent in his position, which is the position of just and 
comprehensive peace. He hopes that all Arab countries will 
coordinate and will maintain solidarity, especially between 
Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. 
  [Dhiyab] Mr. Speaker, in light of the size of these 
pressures 
on Jordan and Lebanon, what is required on the Arab level? 
  [Birri] In fact, at a minimum we need a unified Arab 
position 
that supports the cordon states. Regrettably, as you know, the 
Arab situation is divided. What is required is the restoration 
of Arab solidarity by any means, even if this solidarity takes 
the shape of coordination. We will continue to discuss this 
subject in the meetings with his highness the crown prince in 
order to reach a formula for a specific move in this direction.

level. These reports are wholly speculative and baseless. It 
will be recalled, however, that India has always shown readiness 
to resolve all outstanding issues with Pakistan bilaterally

have repeatedly conveyed to Pakistan in the recent months our 
willingness to hold a comprehensive dialogue at the foreign 
secretary level. We are awaiting Pakistan's formal response.

<F P=106> [Address by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at the opening of </F>
the Knesset summer session in Jerusalem -- live] 
  [Text] Honorable Knesset, last week we celebrated the 46th 
anniversary of Israel's establishment and independence. We 
return to routine today, but we can all look back with pride and 
to the future with great hope. They were 46 hard years of 
struggle for a life and the building an economy and society, 
which led to the State of Israel's great achievements. Despite 
flaws, Israel is today one of the most exciting, beautiful 
states, a good place to live. I would like to take the 
opportunity of the opening of the summer session of the Knesset 
to congratulate the citizens on Independence Day. Members of 
the Knesset, this Independence Day was celebrated in the shadow 
of terrorist attacks, including one which took place only a 
short time before the Remembrance Day siren for those who fell 
while fighting in the country's wars. Five citizens and 
soldiers were killed in the explosion caused by a bomb at 
Hadera's central bus station. The bomb was placed by a 
contemptible murderer, a member of Hamas, who apparently chose 
to die with his innocent victims. This assembly and the entire 
country join to mourn with the families of the fallen. We wish 
to console them in their grief. This assembly and the 
government also wish the wounded a speedy recovery. 
  Mr. Speaker, honorable Knesset, last September we embarked 
on 
a new path in an attempt to turn a page in the bloody history 
between Jews, later Israelis, and Palestinians. We decided not 
to settle former accounts; to forget the bloody past and the 
hatred; to try to create a new, better future for both peoples 
whose historic fate has ruled that they live on the same land. 
We came with a desire to make peace, and I must tell the 
members of the Knesset that we also found a readiness for peace 
by the other side, the Palestinians, who have also suffered for 
generations. Neither we nor the Palestinians will receive all 
that we want, since that is the nature of negotiations, that is 
the nature of compromise, that is the nature of peace. 
  The negotiations with the Palestinians on Gaza-Jericho First 
continue, and in my view, we are at an advanced stage. I hope 
that it will be possible to conclude these negotiations within a 
short while. We believe that a short time after the signing of 
the agreement, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the security 
forces will be able to complete their redeployment. In other 
words, in the wake of the Gaza-Jericho First negotiations, the 
attempt to create coexistence and peace with the Palestinians 
will be tested. I tell you that I wait for the moment that as 
the defense minister I will feel freer not to send IDF soldiers 
to patrol Greater Gaza, towns with a population of 250,000 
Palestinians, the refugee camps, Khan Yunus, Rafah, Dayr 
al-Balah. 
  I would like to clarify in the wake of published reports, 
whether true or not, that any agreement or understanding between 
the PLO and Hamas on continued Hamas terror with the PLO's 
approval will preclude any possibility of agreement between 
Israel and the PLO. Members of the Knesset, this government 
promised to make every effort for peace, and plans to continue 
the talks with Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. Toward the end of 
April or early May the bilateral talks in Washington will 
resume, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher will probably 
arrive in the region to prepare the talks and allow us to 
progress toward signing peace treaties between Israel and its 
neighbors. In the peace talks with the Syrians, we have so far 
not found the appropriate level of openness and flexibility that 
would permit a breakthrough and facilitate a real discussion on 
a peace treaty. Our friends the Americans, who so much want to 
see peace in our region, have so far also failed in their 
efforts. At the same time, the government's position is known: 
We are making a great effort that the precedent Israel paid for 
peace with Egypt -- a total withdrawal and the uprooting of all 
signs of an Israeli presence -- will not repeat itself as a 
condition for peace with Syria. Simultaneously, we are 
preparing seriously for the negotiations and preparing for 
various alternatives regarding the nature of peace. These 
preparations include: the depth of withdrawal on the Golan 
Heights; security arrangements, and the phases in which peace is 
implemented. By doing so there will be time to evaluate the 
normalization process before we complete our withdrawal on the 
Golan Heights, and consider what will we demand from our friend 
the United States in the wake of the peace. If and when we 
reach a reasonable agreement with the Syrians, and the agreement 
will require a significant withdrawal, we will hold a national 
referendum, and the people will decide. 
  The negotiations with Lebanon entail negotiations with the 
Syrians since we know that Beirut will not make a move without 
permission from Damascus. Nevertheless, we reiterate our 
proposal to the Beirut authorities. We proposed, that at the 
first stage, the Lebanese Army will deploy up to the northern 
border of the security zone, and for the next six months it must 
prove its ability to maintain total quiet, and total disarming 
of Hizballah in south Lebanon. If that is proven and if total 
quiet reigns along the northern border of the security zone, we 
will open peace negotiations with Lebanon, which I hope will 
last three months. We will be prepared to withdraw up to the 
international border between Israel and Lebanon on three 
conditions: full peace and normalization; adequate security 
arrangements; and of course, our commitment to the SLA [South 
Lebanese Army] and the inhabitants of south Lebanon. In other 
words, the incorporation of the SLA into the Lebanese Army and a 
guarantee that the inhabitants of south Lebanon will not be 
harmed. 
  A solution is possible in the negotiations with Jordan, but 
to my great regret, I get the impression that it will not happen 
prior to an agreement with Syria, the big brother, who is 
keeping a watchful eye. Members of the Knesset, I want to tell 
the truth: For 27 years we have been dominating another people 
against its will. For 27 years, Palestinians in the 
territories, who currently number 1.7 million, get up in the 
morning cultivating fierce hatred against us, as Israelis and 
Jews. Each morning they get up to a hard life, for which we are 
also, but not solely, responsible. We cannot deny, the ongoing 
control over a foreign people who do not want us, exacts a 
painful price, the price of an ongoing confrontation between us 
and them. 
  For six and a half years we have been witnessing the 
Palestinian's popular uprising, the intifadah, against our rule. 
They try to harm us through violence and terror, to cause us 
fatalities, to break our spirit. I would like to present you 
with some data presented to me by the IDF. Since the start of 
the uprising, 217 Israelis have been murdered, of whom 68 
belonged to the security forces and 151 were civilians. That is 
a painful price. I recall the brigade I had the honor of 
commanding in the battle for besieged Jerusalem and the road to 
Jerusalem during the War of Independence. Within six months, 
this brigade, which was one of the 10 brigades which became the 
IDF, lost the same number of people. One of our distinguished 
IDF commanders, Knesset Member Refa'el Eytan, I am certain, 
remembers that. Those were the losses from one brigade, one of 
10 brigades in a population of slightly more than 600,000. 
Nobody's spirit was broken then, nobody rejoiced over the 
bloodshed. 
  The number of our wounded is 7,872, of whom 5,062 belong to 
the security forces, and 2,810 are civilians. Among the 
Palestinians, 1,045 were killed by our forces -- the IDF and the 
security forces -- 69 by Israeli civilians, 922 by other 
Palestinians, 99 for unknown reasons, 21 while handling 
explosives. In total, there have been 2,156 Palestinians 
killed. Wounded Palestinians, according to IDF data, number 
18,967, while I estimate that at least 25,000 were wounded. 
There have been between 120,000 and 140,000 detentions and jail 
sentences. Those are the statistics of the confrontation during 
the past six and a half years. 
  What were the alternatives facing us after 27 years of 
domination -- I do not want to use a different term -- over an 
entity different from us religiously, politically, and 
nationally. The first alternative was to continue the existing 
situation, to make proposals for which there were no other 
partners, and without a partner there is no arrangement. To try 
to perpetrate the domination of another people; to continue the 
path of violence and terrorism ad infinitum; and to freeze the 
political process, to bring about a political stalemate. 
  All the governments of Israel, definitely all those since 
the 
Yom Kippur War, fully understood the dangers inherent in a 
political stalemate. That is why all the governments searched 
for the second alternative, which is to try to find a political 
solution, at first through separation of forces agreements. 
That was also the approach of the government of the late 
Menahem Begin in the peace treaty with Egypt. That was the path 
taken by Yitzhaq Shamir's government in agreeing to the Madrid 
peace conference. We have also taken that path since the Oslo 
deliberations and the signing ceremony in Washington. 
  Peace now appears to be closer than ever before. There is 
a big opportunity to end the wars, the 100 years of terrorism 
and bloodshed, the 100 years of enmity. When we began the 
journey for peace we knew it would be impossible to wipe out 100 
years of hatred with one signature. We knew it would be 
impossible to change concepts and what is learned from birth, we 
knew that the peace would have enemies, we knew there would be 
people and organizations whose entire reason for existence is 
enmity between the peoples and that they will continue to fan it 
as much as they can. On the Palestinian side, the opposition to 
peace is led by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, the Rejectionist 
Front organizations. The emissaries of those organizations 
carried out most of the recent murders and terrorist attacks, 
some on suicide missions. For two or three years we have been 
facing a phenomenon of extremist Islamic terrorism, which 
recalls the Hizballah, which surfaced in Lebanon and perpetrated 
attacks, including suicide missions. We have been seeing it for 
the first time in the past two or three years among the 
Palestinian terrorist organizations. There is no end to the 
targets Hamas and the other terrorist organizations have among 
us. Each Israeli in the territories and inside sovereign Israel, 
including united Jerusalem, each bus, each home, is a target for 
their murderous plans. Since there is no separation between the 
two populations, the current situation creates endless 
possibilities for Hamas and the other organizations. In Judaea, 
Samaria, and the Gaza Strip, 40,000 vehicles, tens of thousands 
of civilians and soldiers travel daily, according to our 
estimates. IDF soldiers have the task of daily safeguarding 
hundreds of Israeli vehicles, mainly buses, along 1,200 km of 
roads. Hundreds of thousands of Jews and Arabs, and thousands 
of vehicles mix daily, one population lives among the other. 
There are also many possibilities to cross from Judaea, 
Samaria, and the Gaza Strip -- less from the Gaza Strip, more 
from Judaea and Samaria -- into Israel. Many hidden and known 
paths lead from the territories into Israel. It is impossible 
to hermetically close the territories to infiltration by 
individuals. We are making all efforts to bring security to the 
citizens of Israel, both Jews and Arabs, within Israel and in 
the territories of Judaea and Samaria, everywhere. I am 
divulging to the Knesset today that a large part of the IDF's 
standing army is currently on security and defense missions for 
Israelis everywhere. There is no restriction on the activities 
of the IDF except that they should act within the law. In this 
situation, the organizations which continue terrorism have 
limitless targets, and perpetrate murderous missions, with 
openly declared aims -- first to murder Israelis, and 
politically to do away with the peace talks, not to permit them 
to continue. 
  At first, the murderers of Hamas and the other 
organizations operated mainly against Israeli citizens and the 
security forces in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. The 
political aims of those murderers were for Israeli settlers in 
Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip harmed by terrorism to 
demonstrate and act against the Israeli Government thereby 
suspending the peace efforts. They apparently concluded their 
efforts were insufficient. We continued with the peace 
negotiations, so Hamas and the other organizations which oppose 
peace have now put most of their efforts into attacks against 
the Israeli population inside sovereign Israel, including united 
Jerusalem. Since 1 January, 1994, 23 Israelis -- both Jews and 
Arabs -- have been murdered. Twenty were killed inside 
sovereign Israel, including united Jerusalem, and three were 
killed in the territories of Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. 
  Members of the Knesset, it is no secret how sensitive we are 
to fatalities, and the murderers of the terrorist organizations 
and the Rejectionist Front are trying to break us through 
attacks with knives, explosives, firing during ambushes, and car 
bombs. They do not have a chance. We experienced knifings 
during the 1930's bloodshed, we experienced car bombs in the War 
of Independence, we experienced bloody attacks on buses in 
Ma'ale 'Aqrabbim, Avivim, and the coastal road, where the most 
murderous terrorist attack in the history of terrorism, took 
place in 1978 when 35 Israelis were killed. Did any of us call 
the Begin government a blood-tainted government for that? No 
way. We experienced the Ma'alot massacre, the Lod airport 
massacre, the attack on Tel Aviv's Savoy hotel, Kefar Yuval, 
Qiryat Shemona, Misgav 'Am, Naharriya. 
  The people of Israel are not frightened off, they do not 
crack. It hurts, but we get back on our feet and go on. Even 
additional terrorist attacks will not stop the peace train. 
[Responding to catcalls from the right-wing opposition] Look 
who sows fear among the people, does not give them strength, 
does not explain the truth: how we faced much tougher 
situations. I regret to say that level of personal danger to 
each of us has increased in the wake of the despicable massacre 
perpetrated by the Jewish murderer from Hebron. Although the 
Arab terrorist organizations had a thousand reasons and excuses 
for harming us, that man came and added to them. 
  Members of the Knesset, we found one of the foci of Hamas 
activity is in Jordan and not Egypt or Tunisia, and even not 
Syria or Lebanon. We are convinced that the Jordanian security 
authorities are aware of that and nevertheless permitted 
information and operational activity from Amman. We therefore 
found it necessary to warn the Jordanian authorities against 
continued Hamas activity from its territory. Israel expects the 
king and his officials to act against the Hamas murderers, who 
will also ultimately attempt to undermine and topple his regime 
and control. 
  We also took a series of measures, including the tightening 
of the closure. We are aware of the hardship incurred by the 
inhabitants of the territories as a result of the closure, as 
well as to Israel's agriculture and building, but we have no 
choice. If we want to save lives we have to take tough measures 
and if the situation calls for it, we will even take even 
tougher measures. The IDF, Shin Bet, Israel Police, and the 
Border Police are conducting a war to the bitter end against all 
those who continue violence and terrorism. There are no 
restrictions on the activity of the security forces against 
terrorism and violence, except of course, that they operate 
within the framework of the law. 
  Members of the Knesset, the Hizballah terrorist organization 
is also partner to the effort to strangle the chance for peace. 
The Lebanese war did not rid us of terrorism in Lebanon. 
Hizballah leads the attacks against the IDF and SLA in the 
security zone, and from time to time, even against targets in 
Israel. IDF and SLA soldiers assure normal life for the 
settlements and residents of the North. 
  Members of the Knesset, I wish to send from this podium a 
greeting from the bottom of my heart to the IDF commanders and 
soldiers, the commanders and officers of the Israel Police and 
the Border Police, and a special greeting to the Shin Bet, which 
takes a large brunt of the tough war against the murderous 
enemies of Israel and peace. 
  Members of the Knesset, that is the current picture. The 
path to peace is paved with our good intentions and the 
terrorist attacks of the enemies of peace. There might be 
difficult conditions and we might not succeed in totally 
preventing terrorist attacks, but peace will win.

<F P=106> [Address by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at the opening of </F>
the Knesset summer session in Jerusalem -- live] 
  [Text] Honorable Knesset, last week we celebrated the 46th 
anniversary of Israel's establishment and independence. We 
return to routine today, but we can all look back with pride and 
to the future with great hope. They were 46 hard years of 
struggle for a life and the building an economy and society, 
which led to the State of Israel's great achievements. Despite 
flaws, Israel is today one of the most exciting, beautiful 
states, a good place to live. I would like to take the 
opportunity of the opening of the summer session of the Knesset 
to congratulate the citizens on Independence Day. Members of 
the Knesset, this Independence Day was celebrated in the shadow 
of terrorist attacks, including one which took place only a 
short time before the Remembrance Day siren for those who fell 
while fighting in the country's wars. Five citizens and 
soldiers were killed in the explosion caused by a bomb at 
Hadera's central bus station. The bomb was placed by a 
contemptible murderer, a member of Hamas, who apparently chose 
to die with his innocent victims. This assembly and the entire 
country join to mourn with the families of the fallen. We wish 
to console them in their grief. This assembly and the 
government also wish the wounded a speedy recovery. 
  Mr. Speaker, honorable Knesset, last September we embarked 
on 
a new path in an attempt to turn a page in the bloody history 
between Jews, later Israelis, and Palestinians. We decided not 
to settle former accounts; to forget the bloody past and the 
hatred; to try to create a new, better future for both peoples 
whose historic fate has ruled that they live on the same land. 
We came with a desire to make peace, and I must tell the 
members of the Knesset that we also found a readiness for peace 
by the other side, the Palestinians, who have also suffered for 
generations. Neither we nor the Palestinians will receive all 
that we want, since that is the nature of negotiations, that is 
the nature of compromise, that is the nature of peace. 
  The negotiations with the Palestinians on Gaza-Jericho First 
continue, and in my view, we are at an advanced stage. I hope 
that it will be possible to conclude these negotiations within a 
short while. We believe that a short time after the signing of 
the agreement, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the security 
forces will be able to complete their redeployment. In other 
words, in the wake of the Gaza-Jericho First negotiations, the 
attempt to create coexistence and peace with the Palestinians 
will be tested. I tell you that I wait for the moment that as 
the defense minister I will feel freer not to send IDF soldiers 
to patrol Greater Gaza, towns with a population of 250,000 
Palestinians, the refugee camps, Khan Yunus, Rafah, Dayr 
al-Balah. 
  I would like to clarify in the wake of published reports, 
whether true or not, that any agreement or understanding between 
the PLO and Hamas on continued Hamas terror with the PLO's 
approval will preclude any possibility of agreement between 
Israel and the PLO. Members of the Knesset, this government 
promised to make every effort for peace, and plans to continue 
the talks with Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. Toward the end of 
April or early May the bilateral talks in Washington will 
resume, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher will probably 
arrive in the region to prepare the talks and allow us to 
progress toward signing peace treaties between Israel and its 
neighbors. In the peace talks with the Syrians, we have so far 
not found the appropriate level of openness and flexibility that 
would permit a breakthrough and facilitate a real discussion on 
a peace treaty. Our friends the Americans, who so much want to 
see peace in our region, have so far also failed in their 
efforts. At the same time, the government's position is known: 
We are making a great effort that the precedent Israel paid for 
peace with Egypt -- a total withdrawal and the uprooting of all 
signs of an Israeli presence -- will not repeat itself as a 
condition for peace with Syria. Simultaneously, we are 
preparing seriously for the negotiations and preparing for 
various alternatives regarding the nature of peace. These 
preparations include: the depth of withdrawal on the Golan 
Heights; security arrangements, and the phases in which peace is 
implemented. By doing so there will be time to evaluate the 
normalization process before we complete our withdrawal on the 
Golan Heights, and consider what will we demand from our friend 
the United States in the wake of the peace. If and when we 
reach a reasonable agreement with the Syrians, and the agreement 
will require a significant withdrawal, we will hold a national 
referendum, and the people will decide. 
  The negotiations with Lebanon entail negotiations with the 
Syrians since we know that Beirut will not make a move without 
permission from Damascus. Nevertheless, we reiterate our 
proposal to the Beirut authorities. We proposed, that at the 
first stage, the Lebanese Army will deploy up to the northern 
border of the security zone, and for the next six months it must 
prove its ability to maintain total quiet, and total disarming 
of Hizballah in south Lebanon. If that is proven and if total 
quiet reigns along the northern border of the security zone, we 
will open peace negotiations with Lebanon, which I hope will 
last three months. We will be prepared to withdraw up to the 
international border between Israel and Lebanon on three 
conditions: full peace and normalization; adequate security 
arrangements; and of course, our commitment to the SLA [South 
Lebanese Army] and the inhabitants of south Lebanon. In other 
words, the incorporation of the SLA into the Lebanese Army and a 
guarantee that the inhabitants of south Lebanon will not be 
harmed. 
  A solution is possible in the negotiations with Jordan, but 
to my great regret, I get the impression that it will not happen 
prior to an agreement with Syria, the big brother, who is 
keeping a watchful eye. Members of the Knesset, I want to tell 
the truth: For 27 years we have been dominating another people 
against its will. For 27 years, Palestinians in the 
territories, who currently number 1.7 million, get up in the 
morning cultivating fierce hatred against us, as Israelis and 
Jews. Each morning they get up to a hard life, for which we are 
also, but not solely, responsible. We cannot deny, the ongoing 
control over a foreign people who do not want us, exacts a 
painful price, the price of an ongoing confrontation between us 
and them. 
  For six and a half years we have been witnessing the 
Palestinian's popular uprising, the intifadah, against our rule. 
They try to harm us through violence and terror, to cause us 
fatalities, to break our spirit. I would like to present you 
with some data presented to me by the IDF. Since the start of 
the uprising, 217 Israelis have been murdered, of whom 68 
belonged to the security forces and 151 were civilians. That is 
a painful price. I recall the brigade I had the honor of 
commanding in the battle for besieged Jerusalem and the road to 
Jerusalem during the War of Independence. Within six months, 
this brigade, which was one of the 10 brigades which became the 
IDF, lost the same number of people. One of our distinguished 
IDF commanders, Knesset Member Refa'el Eytan, I am certain, 
remembers that. Those were the losses from one brigade, one of 
10 brigades in a population of slightly more than 600,000. 
Nobody's spirit was broken then, nobody rejoiced over the 
bloodshed. 
  The number of our wounded is 7,872, of whom 5,062 belong to 
the security forces, and 2,810 are civilians. Among the 
Palestinians, 1,045 were killed by our forces -- the IDF and the 
security forces -- 69 by Israeli civilians, 922 by other 
Palestinians, 99 for unknown reasons, 21 while handling 
explosives. In total, there have been 2,156 Palestinians 
killed. Wounded Palestinians, according to IDF data, number 
18,967, while I estimate that at least 25,000 were wounded. 
There have been between 120,000 and 140,000 detentions and jail 
sentences. Those are the statistics of the confrontation during 
the past six and a half years. 
  What were the alternatives facing us after 27 years of 
domination -- I do not want to use a different term -- over an 
entity different from us religiously, politically, and 
nationally. The first alternative was to continue the existing 
situation, to make proposals for which there were no other 
partners, and without a partner there is no arrangement. To try 
to perpetrate the domination of another people; to continue the 
path of violence and terrorism ad infinitum; and to freeze the 
political process, to bring about a political stalemate. 
  All the governments of Israel, definitely all those since 
the 
Yom Kippur War, fully understood the dangers inherent in a 
political stalemate. That is why all the governments searched 
for the second alternative, which is to try to find a political 
solution, at first through separation of forces agreements. 
That was also the approach of the government of the late 
Menahem Begin in the peace treaty with Egypt. That was the path 
taken by Yitzhaq Shamir's government in agreeing to the Madrid 
peace conference. We have also taken that path since the Oslo 
deliberations and the signing ceremony in Washington. 
  Peace now appears to be closer than ever before. There is 
a big opportunity to end the wars, the 100 years of terrorism 
and bloodshed, the 100 years of enmity. When we began the 
journey for peace we knew it would be impossible to wipe out 100

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry today issued a statement on the 
progress of events in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
tyrannical Serbian conquest there. 
  The statement stressed that Sudan, proceeding from its 
conviction to respect human rights and respect international 
laws and resolutions, did not wish to see a deterioration in 
terms of hostilities in that region. It also does not wish to 
see the mounting suffering inflicted on the patient and 
steadfast Bosnian people on a daily basis, or the obstinacy of 
the Serbian forces, which exploit the UN Security Council's 
resolutions as an umbrella under which to commit further 
atrocities and massacres. 
  The statement once again called on the international 
community to discharge its responsibilities towards a people 
suffering the worst fate ever to befall any people throughout 
the course of history. The Foreign Ministry statement called on 
the international community and the governments of the Arab and 
Islamic states and peace-loving governments, to adopt a more

  [Text] Answering questions by AL-AHALI, Dr. Mansur Khalid, 
political adviser to the southern commander John Garang, said 
that the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement [SPLM] has not 
asked for the intervention of foreign armies in Sudan. However, 
he said that there are logistical problems hindering the 
transport of relief aid, particularly in the areas where 
fighting is raging. There is a need for guarantees to provide 
supplies to these areas. Sudan is not Somalia, he said, but it 
does not differ from Bosnia or Cambodia. A foreign presence to 
guarantee these humanitarian matters could be provided through 
the OAU or the United Nations. He said: We cannot request this 
of the Arab League because it deals with Sudan as if it were not 
part of the Arab nation. 
  Khalid said that Egypt is in constant contact with all 
Sudanese parties and that it has never ceased its contacts. He 
noted that the Egyptian Government can play an effective role in 
the Sudanese problem on the regional and African levels in its 
capacity as an Arab country and chairman of the OAU. 
  Khalid said that the talk about relations between the SPLM 
and Israel does not deserve a reply. He said that the SPLM does 
not need advisers from Israel or any other country, noting that 
Israel has no experience in guerrilla warfare. He said that the 
Sudanese Government's allegation that the SPLM has relations 
with Israel is meaningless and untrue. It says this when 
everyone is seeking Israel's favor. He noted that the parties 
with which the SPLM cooperate are well known and are mostly 
African. John Garang, he said, completed a guerrilla course as 
a Sudanese Army soldier while on scholarship in the United 
States.

  [Text] Cairo, 16 Apr (INA)--Tahir al-Juhaymi, Libyan 
minister of economy and finance, has called on Arab countries to 
release Iraq's frozen assets from their banks in order to 
confront the unfair embargo imposed by an unjust American will. 
  Al-Juhaymi made a press statement to an IRAQI NEWS AGENCY 
correspondent in Cairo on the periphery of a meeting held by 
Arab financial institutions. He said no law in the world allows 
any force to confiscate and freeze other countries' assets, for 
any reason. This represents a strong blow to international 
laws and norms. 
  He described the embargo imposed by the United States and 
its 
allies on Iraq, and the freezing of Iraq's assets, as a negative 
turning point in the history of international relations and the 
United Nations. This is a full-blown confrontation between the 
correct and progressive forces in the world and the incorrect 
and colonialist forces on another. 
  He said the embargo on the Iraqi and Libyan people and the 
continuous killing and starving of their sons before the eyes of 
the world represents the end of international legitimacy and the 
fall of all slogans raised by Western countries and America 
about human rights, democracy, and the so-called new world order. 
  The Libyan economics minister reiterated his country's total 
solidarity with the people and Government of Iraq in waging the 
fateful battle and their efforts to foil the embargo. He said 
he is confident that Iraqi and Libyan victory in the battle will 
inevitably be achieved.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Burayk Suwaysi, official spokesman </F>
of the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform, by Bisharah 
Shirbil in London; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] London -- Burayk Suwaysi, official spokesman of 
the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform [LMCR], has denied 
that his movement is holding any dialogue with the Libyan 
regime. He also denied that the question of dialogue was one of 
the causes of the movement's split from the National Front for 
the Salvation of Libya [NFSL] at the beginning of the month of 
Ramadan. He stressed that the movement wanted "a peaceful 
solution to the Libayn question" but that did not mean 
"forfeiting our right to use all legitimate means, including 
force, for the salvation of our country." 
  In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Suwaysi said that the 
movement's constitutent assembly would be held within months to 
approve the organizational, ideological, and political structure 
and to elect a leadership. [passage omitted] 
  Asked about the movement's willingness for dialogue, Suwaysi 
said: "I say again that when the prerequisites are fulfilled and 
the principles are clear, especially al-Qadhdhafi's recognition 
of the patriotic opposition and his expression of willingness to 
respond to the legitimate national demands of the Libyan people 
and true recourse to the people.... If all that happens, then 
it would be another matter. 
  "We want a peaceful solution to the Libyan question, a 
solution that would spare our country more conflict and 
bloodshed and spare our people more difficulty, but that 
certainly does not mean forfeiting our right to struggle and use 
all legitimate means, including force, for the salvation of our 
country." [passage omitted] 
  On the question of the Libyan National Army joining the 
movement and its announcement that it would remain open to all 
Libyans, and the conflict that that would create with sound 
organized work, Suwaysi said: "Not at all. There is no 
conflict. The Libyan National Army is an integral part of the 
movement and it is open to all Libyans interested in military 
struggle and not necessarily in joining the ideological and 
political organization." 
  Asked about the leadership of the new organization, Suwaysi 
said that "the present leadership is a provisional leadership; 
we have called it the Constituent Committee and thought it best 
not to divulge the names of its members, but it consists of the 
brothers who took the initial practical steps of crystallizing 
the idea of forming the organization." [passage omitted] 
  On the question of unification of the opposition factions, 
Suwaysi emphasized that the movement "seeks cooperation and 
coordination with all patriotic forces and opposition factions 
to fulfill our people's demands because the current challenge in 
Libya requires the pooling of the efforts of all patriotic 
parties, factions, and individuals." [passage omitted] 
  On the question of who finances the new movement, Suwaysi 
said: "We will rely on the Libyan national capabilities and 
resources inside and outside the homeland. All the 
organization's programs and activities will be kept within the 
limits of the national intrinsic capabilities out of faith in 
the principle of an independent national will free from foreign 
and external pressures." [passage omitted] 
  On relations with the United States, Suwaysi believes that 
"they will be the same as relations with any other state, the 
sole aim being to serve the national cause without undermining 
the Libyan people's interests and the independence of national 
decisionmaking." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 19 Apr (MENA)--The Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations resumed today with the objective of implementing 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement. The Palestinian side to the talks 
is chaired by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat's political adviser, and the Israeli side by General 
Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of staff. 
  Dr. Sha'th affirmed that the negotiators will discuss during 
their meeting today the same subjects they started discussing 
yesterday and on which they made no progress. 
  Palestinian sources have affirmed to MENA that the two sides 
are trying to overcome the big obstacles before the 
negotiations, especially in the framework of the two committees, 
the Security Committee and the Legal Affairs Committee. 
Foremost of these issues is legal jurisdiction over the Gaza 
Strip and the Jericho area, as well as control over the 
crossings and the border points and the release of the 
Palestinian detainees who are estimated to be around 10,400 
people, according to the statistics of the International Red 
Cross. 
  Palestinian sources clarified that the Palestinian 
negotiators insist that all Palestinian detainees should be 
released, irrespective of their political affiliation. The 
objective is to guarantee that no split takes place inside the 
Palestinian ranks. On the other hand, the Israeli side insists 
on not releasing any of the Hamas members since some of its 
members recently carried out some suicide attacks on Israelis. 
  The sources said that the Palestinian-Israeli Civilian 
Affairs Committee will today discuss the subject of contacts in 
the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, in addition to providing 
the Palestinian side with a number of wavelengths and 
frequencies to be used by the police and other services. 
  The sources pointed out that in the case where the deep 
differences between the two sides continue over many basic 
issues, the leaderships of the two sides will have to intervene 
to rescue the negotiations from collapse.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F>
delegation to the Cairo talks with the Israelis, by radio 
correspondent 'Umar Zaydani, in Cairo on 18 April; from the 
"With the Midday Events" -- recorded ] 
  [Excerpts] [Zaydani] Dr. Nabil Sha'th last night summed up 
the negotiations which lasted 12 hours between the Israeli and 
Palestinian delegations yesterday. 
  [Begin recording] [Sha'th] Negotiations are continuing with 
all their committees. A large group of experts in various 
fields was added to the Palestinian delegation this week. 
Today, there were some positive developments. They are slow, 
but proceeding persistently regarding the security issues. Some 
progress was made also on the jurisdiction issue. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Zaydani] We understand that the Israeli delegation 
submitted 
to discussion the issue of relations between Fatah and Hamas in 
the Gaza Strip. 
  [Sha'th] For the tenth time, I would like to explain that 
relations between Fatah and Hamas, or between Fatah or any other 
Palestinian organization, is a 100 percent internal issue, and a 
PLO affair only. We want Palestinian national unity. We spare 
no effort to create a framework of Palestinian understanding and 
Palestinian participation when the Palestinian entity sees 
light. However, at the same time, we are very clear, we are 
committed to this agreement and to its full implementation. Our 
desire to have the biggest possible number of Palestinians 
contribute to our decision making does not at all mean we will 
relinquish our commitments to this agreement. [end recording] 
  [Zaydani] Dr. Nabil Sha'th was asked about his opinion of 
measures taken in Amman to the effect that the Hamas Movement is 
an illegal movement in Jordan. 
  [Begin Sha'th recording] I prefer not to comment on this 
issue. I believe all Palestinian factions will eventually find 
their true house within the PLO and on Palestinian territory. 
His Majesty King Husayn reiterated that the PLO is the sole and 
legitimate representative of the Palestinians. The PLO is the 
side that is responsible and must be responsible for protecting 
the entire Palestinian house. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Israel, PLO Strike Communications Deal" by Mona Salem] </F>
  [Text] Cairo, April 19 (AFP)--Israel and the PLO struck a 
deal Tuesday [19 April] on communications systems for Gaza and 
Jericho in another step toward the launch of Palestinian 
autonomy, chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th said. 
  "We have just completed a difficult agreement which took a 
lot of time and (which gives) to the autonomy authority the 
right to obtain the necessary frequencies for the Palestinian 
police," Sha'th said. 
  "An accord was also reached on giving the Palestinians a 
radio station and telephone network," he said without giving 
details. 
  Each side had claimed the right to decide on their own 
frequencies, with Israel wanting to avoid disrupting its 
existing bands, an Israeli negotiator told AFP earlier. 
  The communications accord follows deals last week to set up 
a 
Palestinian police force and release 5,000 prisoners, but PLO 
officials on Tuesday accused Israel of backtracking on the 
prisoner issue. 
  One official who requested anonymity said Israel refused to 
set a date for freeing 1,000 of the prisoners until it received 
a PLO assurance that the Palestinian police "had the situation 
well under control." 
  The official who asked not to be named said the 1,000 were 
all serving long sentences for crimes judged serious by Israel. 
  PLO negotiator Muhammad Dahlan said Israel took a tougher 
line on the prisoners after the Islamic Resistance Movement 
Hamas carried out attacks that killed 12 Israelis this month. 
  Israel "now categorically rejected the release of certain 
Hamas members," said Dahlan, who is in charge of the prisoner 
file. 
  Under last week's accord 2,500 prisoners are to be released 
when Israel and the PLO sign a final accord to launch self-rule 
in the West Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza Strip. 
  An additional 2,500 prisoners would be set free three weeks 
later when limited autonomous powers were transferred to the 
Palestinians. More than 10,000 Palestinians are estimated to be 
in Israeli jails. 
  A PLO negotiator said that Israeli proposals on jurisdiction 
in the self-rule areas still fell short of Palestinian demands. 
The two sides had also to settle the issue of water sharing 
between Israelis and Palestinians. 
  In the Gaza Strip and West Bank, Israeli troops arrested 
about 285 suspected Islamic fundamentalists in a major crackdown 
following a series of revenge attacks for the Hebron massacre, 
Palestinian sources said. 
  The vast majority were suspected of links with Hamas, which 
has claimed the bombings of two buses in which 12 Israelis died, 
and an axe attack on Monday in which five Israelis were hurt. 
  It was the biggest crackdown on fundamentalists since Israel 
arrested hundreds in December 1992 following a wave of killings. 
Israel deported 415 of the fundamentalist suspects to Lebanon 
but allowed them to return last December. 
  The group has threatened to launch five attacks on Israeli 
targets to avenge the massacre of 30 Moslems by a Jewish settler 
in Hebron on February 25.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by correspondent Emile Khaz'al, in Muscat, </F>
to Nawwaf al-Nabbari, in the studio, date not given; from the 
"With the Events" program --recorded] 
  [Text] [Nabbari] Good evening Emile. 
  [Khaz'al] Good evening Nawwaf. 
  [Nabbari] Reports from Muscat say last-minute difficulties 
prevented issuing a final joint statement on the negotiations 
within the Water Affairs Committee. 
  [Khaz'al] Yes, there is a crisis in the Water Affairs 
Committee meetings. A final statement was scheduled to be 
issued at 1400 today, at 1300 Jerusalem time, but the 
journalists were asked to gather again at 2000 Muscat time, 1900 
Jerusalem time, that is one hour from now to hear the final 
statement. At the same time, international telephone lines and 
faxes have been busy for the past four hours between Muscat, 
Amman, Washington, and Tunis in a bid to find an outlet for the 
crisis caused by 'Ali al-Gazzawi, Jordan's representative to the 
Water Affairs Committee, when he rejected the final statement of 
the water committee's fifth round of talks to protest the 
continuation of the inspection of ships heading to the Jordanian 
Port of al-'Aqabah by the U.S-led allies. 
  Head of the U.S. delegation John Herbst who heads this 
committee stemming from the multilateral talks, seeks to 
unanimously approve the final statement, and rejects the 
Jordanian reservations. The Americans want the Jordanians to 
remain an active partner in the multilateral negotiations 
because it is an important party to the peace process. A short 
while ago, the Palestinian delegation cabled PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat in Tunis asking him to intervene with the Jordanian 
Government to abandon its opposition to the final statement, 
because this statement includes great gains to the Palestinians, 
including welcoming the formation the national water authority, 
and implementation of a number of projects in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, proposed by the United States, Israel, Austria, and 
Germany. These projects are able to overcome the water crisis 
from which the West Bank and Gaza Strip still suffer. 
  The Omani delegation did not hide its dissatisfaction with 
the Jordanian position, especially since the Sultanate of Oman 
considers the convening of the Water Affairs Committee in Muscat 
a first-class international gain. The evidence on this is the 
broad international media coverage of the committee meetings in 
Muscat. They expect here that the fraternal and warm relations 
between King Husayn and Sultan Qabus would rescue the 
multilateral negotiations--in other words the prestige of the 
Omani sultan is being tested. Likewise the sea water 
desalination center in Muscat is now in danger. 
  Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Amman, as we knew, is playing 
a role in convincing the Jordanian Government to approve the 
final statement, which includes several proposals on 
implementation of the projects on which it was agreed. 
  A while ago, the Israeli and Palestinian delegations agreed 
that even if Jordan continues to oppose the final statement, all 
joint projects will be implemented, including replacing old 
water networks in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and organizing 
courses on administering and rationalizing water, as Israel 
proposed. The Palestinian and Israeli delegations will ask the 
donor states to finance these projects in spite of Jordan's 
reservations. 
  In other words, there is a crisis in the Water Affairs 
Committee talks in Muscat, contacts are going on, and it is 
expected to reach a solution to this crisis nearly one hour from 
now, at 2000 Muscat time, 1900 Jerusalem time, and the final 
statement is expected then to be announced on the joint projects 
that will be implemented in the water field.

<F P=106> [Interview with Avraham Katz-'Oz, head of the Israeli </F>
delegation to the Omani Water Affairs Committee, by Arye Gus, in 
Muscat on 19 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Katz-'Oz] From Israel's viewpoint it was a very 
successful meeting. We achieved all the aims we set for 
ourselves. If the next meeting takes place in Bahrain or Kuwait, 
as expected, another of the five or six main targets we came 
here with will be met. The Americans also achieved all their 
aims. I believe we have moved from the stage of general 
deliberations by experts to that of starting to implement 
projects in the field. In his concluding remarks, the chairman 
referred to five projects on which work will now begin. One is 
an American project dealing with waste waters from small 
settlements through chemical treatment, and then the reuse of 
the water. That will be a joint project by two groups -- the 
environment group and the water group. 
  [Gus] That was, of course, the start of cooperation with 
Oman. 
  [Katz-'Oz] Not only that, it also found expression in the 
chairman's closing remarks. In other words, it is on record 
that Israel is a member of the steering committee, which will be 
based in Oman, and that Israel will contribute to desalination 
projects using solar energy within the framework of the Omani 
center, which will have a branch in Israel. 
  [Gus] What is next? 
  [Katz-'Oz] We should look at it as part of Israel's overall 
interest in the water group. Together with all the other 
international elements, we are slowly moving toward an overall 
solution of the Middle East's water problems, for the 
Palestinians, Jordanians, and Israelis, outside the existing 
water distribution framework, through the creation of additional 
water for the future. 
  [Gus] Israel did not oppose the establishment of a 
Palestinian national water authority. What caused the reversal 
in the Israeli position? 
  [Katz-'Oz] The Declaration of Principles includes a number 
of authorities to be set up, including land, water, and military 
authorities. As part of that framework, we, of course, did not 
oppose the establishment of the water authority. The bilateral 
working group will deal with the details of how and when it will 
be set up.

  [Text] Israel and Syria are currently studying a draft 
agreement over the Golan Heights. This agreement includes the 
security arrangements for each side. This draft agreement is 
expected to lead to the signing of a peace treaty between 
Damascus and Tel Aviv. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who will be 
coming to the region within a few days, will try to bring the 
viewpoints of Israel and Syria closer by shuttling between the 
two countries. Christopher will also attend the signing ceremony 
of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in Cairo. 
  AL-MANAR has learned from high-level diplomatic sources that 
the draft agreement includes clauses about the issues of 
relations, normalization, and security arrangements. These are: 
  -- Withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Golan Heights will 
take place in three stages. The first stage includes a 
redeployment of Israeli forces. This stage will last two years. 
  -- U.S. forces will be stationed in strategic positions in 
the Golan Heights, and warning stations will be set up there. 
  -- International observers will be deployed [location not 
specified]. 
  -- Settlements in the Golan Heights will be dismantled in 
stages. Their inhabitants will be compensated if joint projects 
with the Syrians are not set up. 
  -- Syria will not have the right to dispatch military 
forces to the Golan Heights but only a police force equipped 
with personal light weapons. 
  -- An exchange of ambassadors between the two sides will 
be announced. 
  -- There will be U.S. supervision to monitor Syria's 
armament. 
  -- Economic agreements between Damascus and Tel Aviv as 
well as joint economic projects in the Golan Heights will be 
concluded. 
  -- Washington will undertake to support the agreement and 
its implementation by providing financial aid to Syria and 
recognizing Syria's special status in Lebanon.

  [Text] Jeddah, 19 Apr (SPA) -- Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid, the 
secretary general of the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO], 
has pointed out the the Islamic world's concern and great pain 
over the massacre of innocent civilians in Gorazde. Dr. Hamid 
al-Ghabid asserted today, in a statement issued by the ICO, that 
he was in a continuous contacts with the Bosnian Government and 
all members of the ICO on the Serbian wanton and horrible 
onslaught against Gorazde, which the United Nations had declared 
as a safe haven in Bosnia. 
  He added that the ICO coordination team at the United 
Nations 
was in continuous session in order to coordinate the ICO moves 
at the UN Security Council. 
  The ICO secretary general has sent, moreover, a message to 
U.S. President Bill Clinton, in which he pointed out the 
Organization's stance and the overwhelming feeling of sadness in 
the Islamic world in view of the international community's 
failure to prevent the massacre of Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Al-Ghabid affirmed that Serbs' unrestrained 
behavior should justify the increase of air strikes as a means 
to deter them.

  [Text] Jerusalem -- The Orient House yesterday issued a 
press statement in which it expressed its concern and 
disappointment over recent Israeli statements and political 
maneuvers aimed at driving a wedge between sectors of the 
Palestinian people. 
  The statement said that Israeli protests and warnings 
relating to coordination between Palestinians who support and 
oppose the peace process and the attempts to discriminate 
between Palestinian prisoners and set preconditions for their 
release are totally rejected and are considered Israeli 
interference in Palestinian internal affairs. 
  The statement said that the PLO, which is recognized even by 
Israel as the responsible party representing the Palestinians, 
has every right to strengthen and enhance relations and ties 
between various sectors of the Palestinian people regardless of 
their political or religious affiliations. 
  The statement added that these efforts by the PLO are an 
internal Palestinian affair and Israel has no right to interfere 
in them. We reject any Israeli attempts to intervene in any 
national dialogue and agreement between Palestinian national 
movements in the occupied territories.

  [Text] Leaders of an Islamic Palestinian organization have 
pointed out that the implementation of self-rule will not 
prevent the organization from exercising its rights to attack 
Zionist forces and settlers with arms in Palestine. The 
organization noted that, since the self-rule will be implemented 
on 2 percent of the Palestinian land only, the leaders seek to 
draw up a new plan that would enable them to evade any 
confrontation with the Palestinian police.

  [Excerpts] Gaza -- Dhiyab al-Lawh, head of Fatah's media 
and educational department in Gaza, yesterday described the 
relationship between Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] as strategic and crucial and something that cannot be 
disregarded or underestimated. He added that the current 
circumstances dictate that this relationship be special as well 
as more solid and harmonious than ever in order to close any 
loopholes that might arise in the future. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-QUDS, al-Lawh stressed that 
Fatah is looking forward to establishing cooperation with all 
forces present in the Palestinian arena -- not only with Hamas 
-- regardless of whether those forces reject or support the 
accord with Israel. 
  Al-Lawh downplayed Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' 
warning against a rapprochement between Fatah and Hamas. He 
said: When we coordinate with Hamas we do not take into account 
what the Israelis say because this sort of coordination is an 
inter-Palestinian affair governed by the Palestinian people's 
supreme interests and not by the Israelis. On elections for an 
expected legislative council, al-Lawh said: They will be 
general elections in which everyone can participate, because it 
is this elected council that will form the Palestinian national 
government. [passage omitted] 
  On the possibility that a security vacuum might be created 
between the Israeli withdrawal and the national authority's 
assumption of power, al-Lawh said: Now I cannot discuss the 
details of the Palestinian security forces' deployment. I can 
say, however, that the Palestinian leadership has taken all 
necessary precautions and made all the necessary preparations to 
provide security and safety for all Palestinians. It will not 
allow the creation of a security vacuum even for one minute.

<F P=106> [Interview with Munir al-Maqdah, a leader of the dissident </F>
Fatah Movement in south Lebanon, by Najwa Marun; place and date 
not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Marun] How do you view the progress of the 
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Al-Maqdah] Israeli withdrawal? What is happening is a 
deployment. Rabin was very explicit when he said that 
"redeployment in Gaza and Jericho by 13 April will need a 
miracle." We feel that even if the Palestinians enter Gaza and 
Jericho under the Israeli thumb to form a beachhead for the Arab 
homeland, this would only last a certain period, not more than a 
year. In the past we said that Yasir 'Arafat had entered a dark 
tunnel but today we say that he is entering Hell. He can 
neither retreat nor advance. As to what is happening in Gaza 
and Jericho, we are against this return. We have stated our 
position on the Oslo agreement and what has followed it. All 
that has happened is treachery. Everyday we hear comments here 
and there that there is progress in the negotiations or a delay. 
Why is this so surprising? The Jews do not honor pledges or 
promises. They will continue to prevaricate for years to come 
and 'Arafat will continue negotiations but he will not even 
"smell" Gaza or Jericho. [passage omitted] 
  [Marun] Are there still contacts between you and those who 
oppose the peace negotiations in the Arab world? 
  [Al-Maqdah] Of course. We have recently stepped up these 
contacts. "Fatah" is large and is everywhere, not only in 
Beirut's streets, as you can see. Fatah is the Fatah of the 
armed struggle, of the Katyusha, and of Dalal al-Mughrabi. 
  [Marun] There is increased talk on the part of the Lebanese 
regime that the time to apply security measures to everyone is 
coming. 
  [Al-Maqdah] The economic and non-economic siege against us 
continues. Threats to remove or absorb the refugee camps are 
intensifying, but we continue the struggle. We will not lay 
down our arms (he said this three times with great 
determination) until they give us our political rights. We are 
not demanding anything more than our political rights so we will 
not be treated like temporary guests, as in Syria. Our rifles 
are for resistance and for the revolution. They are the rifles 
of tens of thousands of martyrs, and not for blowing up 
churches, killing old people and children, or disturbing 
peaceful towns. We have had enough of them telling us who can 
do what and when. Our camps have gates and we welcome anyone 
who visits us. [passage omitted] 
  [Marun] It is known that Syria holds the "Hizballah" card in 
Lebanon. Who is holding the "Palestinian" card? 
  [Al-Maqdah] Our position in the Middle East is bolstered by 
the firm Syrian stand, which does not go along with everything 
the United States wants. The Syrians cannot abandon the 
territories or the principles laid down since 1947, which it has 
followed to this day, especially under President Hafiz al-Asad. 
This man does not tire; he is silent and patient; and he knows 
how to lead the battle in the field. He holds all the Middle 
East cards in his hand, and this reassures us deeply. There is 
not a single Arab country on the map that is not frightened, 
except Syria. Many of the Arab countries have succumbed; only 
Syria stands alone in the arena despite the pressures and 
threats to it. 
  [Marun] Does this mean that Syria is holding your card and 
that is why you are continuing your opposition? 
  [Al-Maqdah] I did not ask anyone's permission when I chose 
to 
oppose [the Oslo agreement]. I was convinced, as were all those 
who agreed with me, that the course pursued by 'Arafat would 
result in Palestine being sold out. I have not met with any 
Syrian officials to this day. We feel the Syrian stand is 
sacred. We have said, and I reiterate, that our rifles are at 
the Syrian army's disposal because time has proved the 
credibility of this stand, which is honorable for the Arab 
nation. [passage omitted] 
  [Marun] How are you living under the siege imposed on you? 
  [Al-Maqdah] We called on our contacts when all the 
humanitarian organizations stopped helping us. The "Palestinian 
Martyrs' Foundation" (an Iranian organization under Tabataba'i) 
was the only one that supplied us with what we needed. It built 
the huge "al-Ma'shuq" hospital in the camp and also gave monthly 
allowances to the martyrs' families. This aid is not limited to 
the Palestinians in Lebanon but also goes to those in the 
occupied territories. [passage omitted] 
  [Marun] What do you think 'Arafat's fate will be? 
  [Al-Maqdah] 'Arafat's traits are unique. Only 'Arafat enjoys 
strong support from European and reactionary Arab countries, and 
all the Palestinian people's funds are in his own name. 
Following the martyrdom of [senior Fatah officials] 
Abu-al-Hawl, Abu-Jihad, and Abu-Iyad, I believe that if 'Arafat 
were killed, Arab regimes from Egypt to Algeria would collapse 
and there would be trouble in Tunisia. All the U.S. desires to 
protect 'Arafat's life, the great Egyptian support for him, and 
the major Western financial support for him would suffer from 
'Arafat's death and not only with regard to the Gaza-Jericho 
plan. I believe that his demise is imminent and our return to 
Palestine is not that far off. "They see it far off but we see 
it close," God willing. 
  [Marun] After what you have just said, if 'Arafat were 
killed, then you would be the first to be accused. 
  [Al-Maqdah] This is a great honor for me. We know well the 
fate of every traitor. 'Arafat's removal means return to the 
Palestinian home, to collective decisions, to Arab coordination, 
to the "Fatah" home, and to the Palestinian charter. There will 
be great and numerous achievements when he disappears. Money 
will be of no use when the day of reckoning comes. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] Under the slogan of "With Bullets We Fight, With 
Rocks We Resist, and With Gliders We Fly to Palestine" the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command 
[PFLP-GC] held a speech rally at al-Yarmuk Camp at 1600 today, 
15 April, on the occasion of the 29th anniversary of the front's 
establishment. 
  The rally was attended by Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of 
the PFLP-GC; Dr. 'Ala'-al-Din 'Abdin, secretary of the Damascus 
Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party; Staff Brigadier 
General Tariq al-Khadra', chief of staff of the Palestinian 
Liberation Army [PLA]; leaders of the Palestinian Forces 
Alliance; leaders and representatives of patriotic parties in 
Lebanon; leaders and representatives of the National Progressive 
Front in Syria; a number of ranking PLA officers; 
representatives of Arab and friendly liberation movements; 
members of the Arab and friendly diplomatic corps; relatives of 
the martyrs and prisoners; and members of the PFLP-GC's 
Political Bureau and Central Committee. [passage omitted] 
  PFLP-GC Secretary General Ahmad Jibril delivered the speech 
of the Palestinian revolution and the PFLP-GC. He began his 
speech by asking: How far have we reached and when will we get 
there? He said: It is the right of our people and the martyrs 
of our revolution and front to ask: How far have we come, and 
what have we accomplished throughout this long militant march. 
  He added: From the very beginning, since 1959, we have laid 
the first stones of the armed struggle. We have said the road 
to the liberation of Palestine is difficult and long and the 
battle against the Zionist enemy is an open one because we are 
not just fighting a Zionist group, but are fighting colonialism 
and its agents, represented by reactionary Arab regimes and the 
renegades and deviants in the PLO leadership. 
  Jibril touched on the issue of independent Palestinian 
decisionmaking and said: Those who have called for this want to 
separate the national cause of the Palestinian people from the 
pan-Arab cause in order to reach what they have now reached. 
The deviations that have occurred, the last of which the Oslo 
Accord, are the natural outcome of this idea, which is aimed at 
isolating the Palestine question from pan-Arabism. He described 
those who have called for independent Palestinian decisionmaking 
as the owners of the separatist veto in the Palestinian 
community. He said: The real Palestinian decisionmaking is the 
decisionmaking of the Arab and Islamic nation and the Muslim 
Arab people. [passage omitted] 
  Ahmad Jibril dealt with the current political situation and 
strongly criticized the visit to Oman and Qatar by the Zionist 
delegation led by Zionist Deputy Foreign Minister [Yosi] Beilin. 
He said: The enemy's penetration into reactionary Arab regimes 
is not new. This time, however, it not only aims to achieve 
public and direct normalization but also to find new cards to 
pressure the forces hostile to the settlement and to give the 
Tunis leadership and 'Arafat a new dose of strength now that 
they have become exposed and fragile before Arab and Palestinian 
public opinion. He said: The Zionist political course at this 
stage aims at dissolving the unified Arab position in order to 
force Syria and Lebanon to accept what Clinton and the others 
seek. 
  Ahmad Jibril says: Today, there is a current called peace 
that has its own way to reach agreements -- in Oslo, Washington, 
Muscat, and tomorrow Bahrain. 
  Jibril says: The 'Arafat-Rabin agreement has been concluded 
in two files -- security and economy. He noted that the 
security file calls for stopping and ending the intifadah 
through 'Arafat's police now that the Zionists have failed in 
confronting the intifadah. He said that 'Arafat's task is now 
to go to Gaza and Jericho to foil and destroy the intifadah 
instead of the Zionists. The Zionists aim at infiltrating the 
Arab world through the economic file. 
  Jibril says: If the Zionists and 'Arafat succeed in stopping 
the intifadah, it means opening the door wide open for 
Jewish-Zionist immigration into Palestine, reinforcing Zionist 
settlements in Palestine, and imposing a siege on the 
Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. 
  Ahmad Jibril said that the heroic intifadah has aborted the 
schemes of 'Arafat and Rabin and will continue to resist them. 
  In his speech Jibril praised the firm and solid stands of 
Syria, Libya, and Iran.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Shaykh Abd el-Baki Saharawi, </F>
founder of the FIS, by Nicolas Beau in Paris; date not given: 
"Algeria's Rulers Will Fall Like Ripened Fruit"] 
  [Text] Shaykh Saharawi is one of the few dignitaries who 
can speak on behalf of the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], of 
which he is a founding member. From the Myrha Street Mosque in 
Paris, he describes the battle plans of "those on the inside" 
and the FIS' government program. 
  In the heart of the 18th district, a very Arab and 
African-looking Parisian area, the Myrha Street Mosque, a 
warehouse undergoing renovations, is the latest retreat of 
Shaykh (master) Abd el-Baki Saharawi. A founder of the FIS, 
this 84-year old preaches every Friday in front of thousands of 
faithful. Since the imprisonment of the FIS' principal leaders 
Abbasi Madani and Ali Belhadj in Algeria in 1990, no one has 
been really qualified to speak on behalf of the FIS. As 
fundamentalist guerrillas control at least four Algerian regions 
(Blida, Bouira, Chlef, Medea), they have their own legitimacy. 
Outside Algeria, however, Saharawi is one of the few who have 
been maintaining ties with "those on the inside." "I have been 
in contact with the mujahidins (freedom fighters)," he simply 
admits. Whenever he speaks about Chebouti, a member of the 
Armed Islamic Movement (MIA) and main guerrilla leader, Shaykh 
Saharawi call him "general Chebouti." "We have had thousands of 
generals whose titles were illegitimate. Why should we not have 
our own military ranking system?" 
  In Paris, people no longer understand the true nature of 
Algeria's ruling group, which is split between the 
"eradicationist" wing, which favors all-out repression, and the 
moderate wing, which advocates dialogue. Shaykh Saharawi is 
unimpressed by such fine distinctions: "Algeria's rulers went 
one step toward democracy by holding elections. We won, but 
they clung to power. It was this caricature of democracy that 
triggered the crisis: The ruling class had become illegitimate." 
  Dialogue? What dialogue? Shaykh Saharawi smiles 
self-righteously: "The Army must return to its barracks; it has 
nothing to do with civilian life. The ruling group tells us: 
`Leave oil, foreign affairs, and the armed forces to us.' But 
such bartering is over, now, it is a thing of the past..." He 
dismisses as irrelevant the three-year transitional period the 
army has been attempting to negotiate with fundamentalist 
leaders: "We give them three months, and that is it." Why 
should they wait any longer? Fundamentalists are convinced that 
they will be in power much sooner, possibly within a month: 
"Mujahidins have already begun to converge in the Algiers area. 
The rulers will fall like ripened fruit." 
  His face suddenly hardening, Shaykh Saharawi pulls out 
pictures of fundamentalists who have been viciously tortured: 
faces butchered with chain saws, limbs cut off. Algeria's 
civil war is now a palpable presence in the quiet mosque. "We 
will not let them have their way," he says curtly, adding: "You 
did not understand me; all we ask the Army is to desist. 
Soldiers have one single purpose: to defend the country..." 
We insist. Is shared power an option? Could there be a 
coalition grouping the Arab-Muslim bloc of the FLN [National 
Liberation Front] and some members of the FFS (Socialist Forces 
Front) led by Kabylia-born Hocine Ait Ahmed? "Why not?" says 
Shaykh Saharawi. "But should the people give us an absolute 
majority, then we shall not share power. When the Right wins in 
France, it governs alone, and Socialism is swept away." 
  The French system is often mentioned by Shaykh Saharawi, who 
was a sergeant in the 7th Regiment of Algerian infantrymen 
during World War II, before becoming union representative in the 
factory for FO [Workers' Force]. However, Western logic has had 
no bearing on his political views: "For us, democracy is only a 
means to an end, it is most definitely not a value." France has 
disappointed him, its options are no longer credible. "It took 
you four centuries to come up with democracy, and not a single 
voice was heard condemning the interruption in the electoral 
process." Not that fundamentalists want to extend their jihad 
to French suburbs. "We do not intend to open a second front in 
France. Before 1962, things were different, we were fighting 
our colonizer. Today's events only affect Algerians." 
  Shaykh Saharawi's political platform is fairly specific: 
"For us, most issues are already discussed and settled in the 
Koran. That which God has decreed remains immutable." Sixty km 
south of Algiers, in the fundamentalist-controlled Blida region, 
no woman goes about unveiled. God's will? "Of course, wearing 
the veil is a Koranic recommendation. Woman is unique for man, 
she must be honored and respected. The prophet wrote this in 
his Hadith (teachings)." Shaykh Saharawi was especially 
appalled by recent television programs which allegedly advised 
women to have sexual intercourse before marrying. "This is pure 
depravation," says the cleric, adding that "all this cannot be 
done overnight; there are no plans to impose Islamic law with 
militiamen and pasdarans, as was the case in Iran. We must 
re-islamize society little by little." 
  All parties will be accepted in this Islamic society, 
provided they are not anti-Islamic. This is the sudden 
admission that spreads doubt in the mind of the Western 
listener. For instance, there is not much of a future for Said 
Saadi's Kabyle party, the RCD (Rally for Culture and Democracy), 
which has been given the most exposure by the French press 
because it provides them with a secular (and deceiving) picture 
of Algeria's society: "Obviously, the RCD will be banned, as it 
does not represent anyone but itself." Shaykh Saharawi has no 
mercy for Algerian intellectuals, who are a daily target of 
terrorists, either: "These are bureaucrats tooting their own 
horn; they condemn recent killings, but they did not say a word 
against the military dictatorship which oppressed the people for 
30 years." 
  Why does this tactful old man, who does not lack a sense of 
humor, advocate a society that runs totally counter to our 
beliefs? How can we understand one another? After all, he 
unequivocally condemned the murders of foreigners, including 
French nationals. But faced with such questions, Shaykh Saharawi 
quickly puts an end to the discussion. "I am a Muslim; you in 
Europe are atheists, laymen, it is only normal that we should 
not understand one another; we must learn to respect one 
another." 
  The whole fundamentalist platform is to be found in a 
16-page 
document written by FIS founders at their organization's 
inception in 1989. Agriculture will be strongly promoted. 
"Algeria used to be the granary of the Mediterranean; feeding 
the people is a priority." Taxes will be replaced by zekat 
(charity), which is more productive. The economy will be 
liberal, except from a number of sectors which will remain 
state-owned (oil, mining). Corruption will be hunted down 
ruthlessly. Shaykh Saharawi insists: "Ruthlessly." Will they 
go as far as cutting off a thief's hand, as provided for by the 
Koran? "When everyone has enough to eat, and no earlier than 
that, we may consider such a punishment." 
  What about the burden of Algeria's foreign debt? "When we 
are in power, we shall see what we can afford to pay..." No 
question of paying for the servicing of the debt, at any rate: 
"We paid already at least four times what was owed; the notion 
of interest is contrary to Islam's precepts." Economics is 
visibly not Shaykh Saharawi's primary concern. The true program 
of this simple and pious man is contained in the following 
Koranic line, which he willingly translates: "God is 
everlasting, ever-living, and he rules the world."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "In statement to AL-MUSLIMUN, Two </F>
Salvation Front Leaders Say: Algerian Crisis Can Only Be 
Resolved by Referring to Islamic Law, People"] 
  [Text] Jeddah, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- In their first press 
statement to a publication since their release from prison, Ali 
Djeddi and Abdelkader Khamkham -- members of the Algerian 
[Islamic] Salvation Front [FIS] who are authorized by their 
leader Abassi Madani, currently in Bleda prison, to make 
statements -- have told our sister [London weekly] AL-MUSLIMUN 
that the only way to resolve the crisis in Algeria is "to refer 
to the Shari'ah and the people." In an interview to be 
published by AL-MUSLIMUN in its next issue, they stressed that 
allowing the people to have their say would result in nothing 
but what is compatible with the Shari'ah. And that would not 
conflict with the principle of freedom of human rights advocated 
by others. 
  On their proposals on how to make a start, Djeddi and 
Khamkham said: "We have not yet reached the stage of proposing 
a solution, and the ground is still not paved. Nevertheless, 
there is still a big hope." 
  On the dangers threatening the course of dialogue, they said 
that "the authorities' deviations must be corrected first, and 
the other side must correct the deviations in some people's 
understanding of Islam. That is the only way to stop the 
bloodshed." On the issuing of certain statements by the two 
sides advocating violence, Djeddi and Khamkham said: "True, 
there are criminal actions. But these can only be eliminated by 
upholding the legitimacy of the Islamic state." 
  On the fear that some groups may get out of control, even 
after matters return to normal, they said: "Then any deviation 
must be denied any legal or polical cover. If we refer to the 
Shari'ah and the people and open the door of hope, no one is 
going to separate from us. If it happens, it will not be very 
serious." 
  On what was said about their pledge to the authorities, 
specifically to President Liamine Zeroual, who met with the 
seven FIS leaders in prison to contribute to calming the 
situation, and what was said about their denial of this pledge, 
Djeddi and Khamkham said: "We did not lie, nor did we deny that 
pledge in our recent statement."

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Apr (MENA)--In its commentary today, the 
newspaper AL-AKHBAR cites a warning by international observers 
in Sarajevo of possible atrocities done under the policy of 
ethnic cleansing by the Serbs in Bosnia, who have attacked 
Goradze's only hospital. Senior Western officials, the paper 
writes, have done nothing to resolve the situation in Bosnia. 
Western rhetoric is nothing but a half-hearted attempt to 
justify a situation that is only as disgraceful as it is 
untenable, the paper states. 
  The tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina proves that the United 
Nations is no improvement on the League of Nations. Actually, 
it is even more impotent than the defunct league. The United 
Nations may have 180 members and a charter that endows it with 
powers the League of Nations never had, but its never assumes 
these powers except to satisfy the desires of some of the major 
powers.

  [Text] Asyut, 19 Apr (MENA)--A terrorist was killed in an 
exchange of gunfire with police forces at the Manfalut bus 
station in Asyut, Upper Egypt, this afternoon. The terrorist, 
Mukhtar Husayn Kamil, is accused of killing Police Sergeant 
Hilal 'Ali Ibrahim. The security agencies earlier learned from 
the terrorist's companions, who had recently surrendered and 
repented, that Kamil frequented the Manfalut bus station. When 
the terrorist felt that the police force were tightening the 
noose around him, he fired at the policemen. The police advised 
him to stop firing but he continued to fire indiscriminantly. 
The policemen were forced to return the fire, killing him 
instantly. He had in his possession a pistol stolen from a 
policeman. He was from from al-Qusiyah and used Manfalut as a 
base for his terrorist acts. He hid in Manfalut after 
assassinating Hilal 'Ali Ibrahim last year. The Manfalut 
Prosecution Office has been notified to begin investigations 
under the supervision of Counsellor Muhammad Mursi Muhammad 
'Ali, public attorney in the prosecution office of north Asyut.

<F P=106> [Report by Jamal 'Abd-al-Rahim] </F>
  [Excerpt] The interrogation of members of the al-Jihad 
Organization's military wing has disclosed that they recently 
returned to Egypt from abroad, where they received training in 
all types of weapons, the preparation and manufacture of bombs 
and explosives, and how to use them to carry out terrorist 
operations against important public figures and senior security 
officials. 
  The investigations also revealed that 'Adil 'Awad Siyam, the 
terrorist who was killed in a fight with policemen on al-Bahr 
al-A'zam street in al-Munib on 4 April, had been assigned by 
fugitive terrorist Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of the al-Jihad 
Organization, to lead the organization's military wing and to 
act as coordinator between the terrorist leaders abroad and in 
Egypt. Dr. al-Zawahiri supplied him with the money to buy 
weapons and ammunition in order to carry out terrorist 
operations. Organization members were to have assassinated UN 
Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali during his visit to Egypt, 
but failed due to a change in his route. They had also planned 
to assassinate Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif. 
  The interrogation of al-Jihad's military wing members also 
indicated that terrorist Siyam had planned the aborted attempt 
on the life of Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. For that 
operation, he rented a house for terrorists Diya'-al-Din Mahmud 
Hafiz, Nazih Subhi Rashid, Ahmad Faruq, and Muhammad Rashad 
'Abd-al-Hamid in the Kafr al-Manfa area in al-Haram. He then 
persuaded terrorist Diya'-al-Din Hafiz to carry out the suicide 
mission, while he personally watched the interior minister's 
motorcade. 
  Members of the organization, including terrorist Muhammad 
'Abd- al-'Alim Khalifah, brother-in-law of terrorist 'Adil 
'Awad, admitted to killing witness Sayyid Ahmad Abu-Yahya and 
three others at his car showroom in Shibin al-Qanatir on 4 
February. He was murdered for reporting to the police on their 
terrorist colleague Sayyid Salah. Salah was sentenced to death 
in connection with the assassination attempt of Prime Minister 
Dr.'Atif Sidqi. They also admitted to placing an explosive 
device at al-Jazirah Youth Center in 1993 so it would detonate 
during a training course of State Security Intelligence 
officers, and to killing their dissident colleague 'Adil Anwar 
in Saray al-Qubbah area. 
  The investigations revealed that terrorist Siyam had been 
using seven stolen cars to move around in and to pass 
instructions to organization members. A report by the criminal 
laboratory identified the weapons found in possession of the 
terrorists as those used in the Shibin al-Qanatir terrorist 
operation, in which Sayyid Abu-Yahya and three others were 
killed and a police officer, who chanced to be in the showroom, 
was injured. The investigations showed that terrorist 'Adil 
Siyam had received funds from abroad, for a receipt from a 
foreign currency transfer in Italy was found. The organization 
members used to disguise themselves in police, armed forces, and 
municipality workers' uniforms to place the explosive devices in 
strategic areas. The investigations revealed that terrorist 
'Adil Siyam and his brother-in-law Muhammad Khalifah had trained 
the terrorists how to prepare explosives. The organization 
members led prosecutors to nine dens in al-Basatin, al-Munib, 
al-Qalubiyah, where weapons and ammunition had been stored, as 
well as an underground tunnel which led to Bilbays in al- 
Sharqiyah Governorate. [passage omitted]

  [Text] It has been learned that members of the al-Jihad 
Organization's military wing have constructed secret underground 
tunnels in al-Sharqiyah Governorate in which they built a number 
of cells. 
  According to information, the organization planned to kidnap 
some figures and lock them up in these cells as hostages to put 
pressure on officials to meet their criminal demands. 
AL-JUMHURIYAH has learned that the tunnels were discovered 
during a search for terrorists. Security men found a big water 
tank. When they removed it, they were surprised to find an 
entrance that leads to the underground tunnels.

  [Text] A decision has been made to provide every repentant 
terrorist with a job. In fact, 25 repentant terrorists have 
been given jobs in Asyut, after it became evident that they were 
qualified and had university or high school diplomas that they 
had earned years ago. 
  Dr. Yusuf Wali, secretary general of the National Democratic 
Party, made this statement. He also added that the party 
leaders in Asyut and Asyut Governor Samih Sa'id have been 
instructed to provide jobs immediately for repentant terrorists 
in the governorates.

<F P=106> [Column by Muhammad al-Ghazali: "This Is Our Religion"] </F>
  [Text] We are fighting on two fronts: That of the 
ungrateful toward Islam and that of the unlearned in Islam. 
Each one is worse than the other. We want to present genuine 
Islam, adding nothing and omitting nothing. Adding means more 
human heresy and superstition and omitting means deleting some 
elements of the revelation that might inhibit its desired impact 
and give heretic tendencies the upper hand over correct 
guidance. At any rate, we will not move an inch from that 
stance. Unsound piety can only be rectified by authentic piety, 
and exceeding the bounds and wastefulness can only be cured by 
moderation. 
  The ungrateful can sometimes pursue detestable courses; they 
might assail guides with their sharp tongues. Abu-Nuwas 
[Abbasid poet] was a drunk. When a cleric advised him to 
abandon this habit, he said: Tell him who claims to be 
knowledgeable that he learned something and missed a lot. 
Ignorant as he was, Abu-Nuwas did not say that God permitted 
drinking or that the Koran has not prohibited drinking, as a 
contemporary man of law has claimed. This saying is very true of 
that man of law: I was one of Satan's soldiers. When I climbed 
up in status, Satan became one of my soldiers. 
  More surprising is that such people are being called to cure 
terrorism and deviousness. I saw on television images of 
individual and couple dancing; these images are damned by chaste 
and straight people. But the actors and actresses taking part 
in these animal-like festivals have been recruited in a campaign 
against the veil and descent clothing using the theory that 
women who display their charms are ethical while others who wear 
long dresses are evil. 
  Can terrorism be fought by actors and actresses? Since when 
does the leadership of social reform grow in such surroundings? 
Where are the thinkers, mentors, and men of knowledge? The 
fire of temptation cannot be extinguished this way; it glows 
further just like fire does when fed with oil. 
  The masses were enraged when these artists talked about 
religion, although they were ignorant about its teachings. This 
is not surprising, since man cannot give what he does not have. 
It is ridiculous that his excellency "Sayyid, the Boy Servant" 
[reference to comedian 'Adil Imam, whose film "The Terrorist" is 
showing in Cairo] should be called to fight terrorism and assist 
the police in their difficult task. 
  If the culture of some religious people is faulty, it is 
established scholars, and not farcical artists, who can correct 
it. If Charlie Chaplin of England managed with his wit and 
movements to make people laugh, could this actor preclude the 
role of literature, philosophy, religion, and major institutions 
in guarding rights and welfare and enhancing the nation's 
message?

<F P=106> ["Calmly" column by Chief Editor Ibrahim Nafi'] </F>
  [Excerpts] The television interview with 'Adil 
'Abd-al-Baqi, one of the former leaders of the al-Shawqiyun 
Group, has provided a good example of the ideology and methods 
used by the terrorist organizations. These organizations are 
raising the banners of religion falsely to achieve their true 
goals, which are the domination and control of the people's 
destinies to seize power by force. 
  The corruption exercised by these groups through Islamic 
legal rulings on murder, plunder, and seizure of unbelievers' 
property to finance their operations [istihlal] represents the 
height of offense against religion, country, law, and public 
order unpracticed by any gangster group in our country before. 
[passage omitted] 
  Frankly and objectively, I say that the terrorist elements 
of 
these new generations are a bad product of the gap between the 
Egyptian media (press and audio-visual) and these youths, their 
aspirations, hopes, and real problems. Most of our media 
concentrates on what is happening in greater Cairo and 
Alexandria and the problems that exist there, without giving 
much attention to the big vacuum in which the new generations 
live and to the need to create bridges of confidence and 
dialogue between these generations and our scholars, thinkers, 
intellectuals, media men, and even politicians and political 
parties whose role has been limited to political contests in the 
press. Not much effort has been made to fill the dreadful 
ideological vacuum that exists among these generations. This 
vacuum is also the result of the defect in the educational 
system. This system requires real revision because it is 
molding unopen minds that do not debate or discuss ideas or 
positions in a rational and critical manner that respects the 
opinion of others. 
  Behind this dreadful ideological vacuum in which Muslim 
legal 
rulings on murder, terrorism, and the seizure of unbelievers' 
property flourish stands the absence of rational, tolerant, 
religious thinking, which has been represented for many decades 
by the al-Azhar and its scholars. [passage omitted] 
  We are facing an illness that requires the efforts of all of 
our scholars and researchers to diagnose the causes of these 
dangerous manifestations. [passage omitted] 
  I think that placing the responsibility for dealing with 
terrorist activity on the shoulders of the security services 
alone is extremely unfair to them, because everyone is called 
upon to do their part in this confrontation. A media role is 
urgently needed to confront the extremist terrorist ideology and 
its sources, which deviate from the principles of religion and 
the consensus of jurisprudence. There is an important and 
required role for the cultural services in this confrontation. 
[passage omitted] 
  According to all indications, there is a need for 
integration 
between the policies of education, culture, and information to 
make it easier for the police forces to carry out their duty 
with competence and efficiency. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Dividing Lines" column by Samir Rajab] </F>
  [Text] What happened yesterday over the regions that are 
under international protection in northern Iraq is very 
embarrassing for the United States, which is trying to appear to 
the whole world as the sole holder of all the keys to modern 
technology. 
  Is it possible that U.S. fighter planes downed U.S. 
helicopters? 
  Frankly, had such an incident taken place in a Third World 
country, the United States would have screamed and shouted, 
cried and mourned over the souls of the victims who are 
worthless and priceless. 
  If the catastrophe had been the fault of a state other than 
the United States, the world would have been up in arms. 
Washington would have called for a Security Council meeting and 
demanded the international community's intervention to punish 
the wrongdoer, even if the mistake had been committed 
unintentionally. 
  There are numerous examples of this kind of U.S. behavior. 
However, because the United States is the one who made the 
mistake, the issue will not go beyond forming a committee that 
will look into the circumstances and justifications of the 
incident. 
  Of course, Britain also reacted calmly to the catastrophe, 
despite the fact that it lost two of its officers working with 
the UN forces. But it is a friendship that cannot be forfeited 
very easily. To put it another way, Britain was afraid of U.S. 
anger if it protested the incident and accused the United States 
of negligence. 
  On the other hand, Iraq quickly issued a statement in which 
it denied involvement in the incident so that it could avert 
further sanctions that might have been imposed on its people, 
but this time for no reason. 
  At any rate, with every passing day there is further 
evidence 
that the aura with which the United States surrounds itself, 
thanks to its famous and distinctive media, does not agree with 
reality. Once again I repeat that had the incident been caused 
by any other country, demonstrations would have erupted in the 
whole world condemning the backward people who fail to use the 
inventions of our age and do not appreciate the value of a life.

  [Text] Cairo, 18 Apr (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR writes that Iraq's 
surprise decision not to consider Kuwait as its 19th province 
raises many questions and even doubts. In a commentary in its 
Tuesday edition, the paper says that many observers think that 
this decision is not prompted by a desire to return to what is 
right nor does it mean that Iraqi President Saddam Husayn has 
repented. The decision has another purpose. It shows the 
failure of the Iraqi regime's repeated attempts to end the UN 
sanctions that have been in effect since the crime of the 
invasion of Kuwait. It also reflects the Iraqi regime's desire 
to bring about the release of its frozen assets in some world 
countries and resume the exportation of Iraqi oil. 
  AL-AKHBAR concludes by saying that irrespective of the 
Baghdad regime's intentions in making this surprise announcement 
regarding its attitude to Kuwait, the departure of Saddam Husayn 
remains the basic condition for the resumption of normal 
relations with Iraq by the majority of the Arab world.

<F P=106> [Article by Ihsan Bakr: "Reconciliation...Before Peace"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Peace with Israel is closer at hand than 
reconciliation between the Arab capitals. The achievement of 
Arab-Israeli reconciliation is closer than inter-Arab 
reconciliation, despite four destructive wars, the occupation of 
five Arab countries, and a 45-year old enmity. 
  This is the bitter truth we are living with. This is the 
painful Arab situation we are experiencing despite all the 
sincere efforts made by several Arab capitals and the persistent 
endeavors of the Arab League secretary general, which no one can 
ignore. 
  The results of the 101st Arab League Foreign Ministers 
Council session and all the statements issued by the foreign 
ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] after concluding 
their meetings in Riyadh indicate very clearly that Arab 
reconciliation has become difficult to achieve. Even clearing 
the Arab atmosphere as a prelude for achieving reconciliation 
will remain a mere "pan-Arab hope" that needs frankness, 
face-to-face meetings, and bold and responsible political 
decisions with which to face the regional and international 
changes. [passage omitted] 
  The GCC foreign ministers' final statement--which was very 
tough on Iraq--means that the Gulf wound has not yet healed. 
The statement also put an end to reports about differences and 
disagreements in the Gulf countries' stance on the Baghdad 
government. It is true that the way Qatar and the Sultanate of 
Oman are dealing with Baghdad is unique. It is also true that 
the United Arab Emirates has repeatedly called for clearing the 
Arab atmosphere. But the six Gulf countries' unanimous approval 
of their final statement means that there has been no change 
toward the Iraqi Government. [passage omitted] 
  In a press statement by Saudi Foreign Minister Sa'ud 
al-Faysal--and we note here the rarity of the Saudi official's 
statements--he stressed that the GCC has one single objective: 
Iraq should implement all UN resolutions. He added that the 
essence of these resolutions is the recognition of Kuwait. He 
reiterated the need to maintain Iraq's unity and sovereignty 
over all its territories and also expressed the GCC countries' 
sympathy for the Iraqi people. 
  The amazing thing is that some of the major countries that 
are permanent members of the Security Council--Russia, China, 
and France --have declared that Iraq has made progress in 
implementing Security Council Resolution 687. Iraq has 
officially announced its acceptance of this resolution. This 
declaration came at the same time that the six Gulf states 
stressed that the Iraqi regime continues to pose a threat to 
their security and stability. The GCC countries then welcomed 
the continued imposition of the embargo on Iraq! 
  No one in the world doubts that the Iraqi regime is 
responsible for the Iraqi people's sufferings now because of its 
invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. All the reports coming 
from Baghdad speak about the tragedies that the Iraqi Arab 
people are facing and the food, medicine, and children's milk 
shortages. 
  No one disagrees with the fact that the international 
treatment of the Gulf crisis was characterized by extreme 
arbitrariness and by U.S. determination to destroy everything on 
Iraq's territory. Iraq withdrew from Kuwait, complied with the 
Security Council resolutions, and then complied with the actions 
to dismantle its army and put an end to its military strength. 
But to continue the international boycott and the constant 
attempt to split Iraq's territories and people is unacceptable 
to any conscience or to any Arab. It appears that the issue is 
not one of implementing the international resolutions but a plot 
to starve the Iraqi people and make that country submit. The 
United States is unsheathing its sword and using its pressures 
against Iraq, but it ignores or forgets that Israel has the 
nuclear power, is daily disregarding the UN resolutions, and is 
violating human rights. Still the United States does not act. 
  The U.S. President is upset when he learns that the Iraqi 
people continue to be an asset to the Arab nation despite the 
tribulations and horrors it has gone through. The U.S. 
President's conscience feels no pain when the reports coming 
from Baghdad tell him that the Iraqi capital's hospitals are 
suffering from acute shortages of medicine and the absence of 
anesthetic necessary for surgery. 
  It is not a defense of Saddam Husayn or his regime but a 
defense of a fraternal Arab people, against whom plots are being 
hatched in the name of international legitimacy while this 
legitimacy disregards all that is happening inside the occupied 
Arab territories and the organized killing of the Bosnian people. 
  The current situation requires an urgent and responsible 
Arab 
action to save a fraternal people, clear the Arab atmosphere, 
and achieve a comprehensive reconciliation. Reconciliation here 
is not for the sake of this or that regime but is a pan-Arab 
necessity imposed by the challenges facing the nation. If the 
danger is threatening the Iraqi state's unity and pan-Arab 
security, then no one in the region can save himself even if he 
seeks the help of the major countries' armies. The Arab world's 
primary and last guarantee stems from within this world, from 
its peoples and regimes. We have no course other than 
solidarity so that the torrent does not sweep over us all. If 
it does, then neither the oil nor the money will help us protect 
the nation's identity and national independence.

  [Text] Suez, 18 Apr (MENA)--Field Marshal Muhammad Husayn 
Tantawi, minister of defense and war production, has stressed 
the importance of continuous military training to upgrade the 
Armed Forces' combat readiness. 
  In remarks made while attending the military exercise 
"Taysir 
13" east of the Suez Canal today, Tantawi praised the skill of 
the 3d Field Army and noted the combat ability of the Egyptian 
soldier. 
  He called for continuing tough training for small and 
medium-size units and for providing the necessary care for 
soldiers to enable them to achieve a high level of physical and 
technical competence and to always be ready to defend Egypt. 
  He said the state and the people are securing modern and 
advanced equipment for the Army to enable it to perform its 
tasks honorably. 
  In the exercise, a mechanized infantry unit of the 3d Army 
crushes an enemy attack in a mountainous region. The unit stops 
the advance of enemy forces, destroys them, restores defensive 
positions, and launches a counterattack. 
  The exercise begins with enemy warplanes attacking the 
positions of the mechanized infantry unit. The Air Force then 
intervenes, confronting enemy planes and forcing them to flee. 
  Reconnaissance units start to gather military information on 
the movements of the two sides. 
  Ground defenses, helicopters, and vehicles equipped with 
antitank missiles confront and destroy the attacking enemy 
tanks. Our forces use mine fields and landslides to hinder the 
enemy advance. Here the competence of the Egyptian antitank 
missile "al-Ahram" appears. The missile is mounted on light 
military vehicles and can destroy enemy tanks far away. 
  In the next phase of "Taysir 13," the 3d Army tanks launch a 
counterattack against enemy positions, inflicting heavy losses 
on them. Electronic war techniques, represented by jamming and 
obstruction, are used. 
  Antichemical-warfare units carry out surveys to make sure 
the 
enemy used no chemical weapons in the battle. 
  The exercise is part of a major training plan currently 
being 
implemented by the 3d Field Army using live ammunition; it 
coincides with the anniversary of the return of dear Sinai to 
Egypt. 
  Mechanized infantry, tank, helicopter, reconnaissance, 
chemical warfare, and Air Force units took part in the exercise. 
  The drill seeks to highlight the ability of commanders to 
make decisions in emergencies and control their forces during 
the battle. It also aims to unify the method of action used by 
the Armed Forces branches in mountainous regions and to train 
tank crews working in the mountains.

  [Text] Cairo, April 19 (MENA)--Public Prosecutor Raja' 
al-'Arabi today asserted the prosecution's abidance by doing its 
role in accordance with legitimacy and supremacy of law without 
ignoring guarantees enjoyed by individuals. 
  This came in a message he sent to the Press Syndicate in 
reply to a note he received of late from Ibrahim Nafi', chairman 
of the Press Syndicate, requesting the prosecution's 
interference to protect guarantees of journalists who were 
arrested recently. 
  The Press Syndicate Board charged that the prosecution had 
violated such guarantees recently. 
  "All the prosecution members are fully aware, and have 
proper 
understanding, of all rulings and laws, including the authority 
of the press and criminal procedures," asserted the chief 
prosecutor. 
  "The prosecution is keen on implementing laws out of its 
responsibility and duties without the need for anyone to draw 
its attention to that," he affirmed.

    [Editorial Report] Cairo AKHBAR AL-YAWM in Arabic on 9 
April carries on its front page a 500-word summary of the 
results of a public opinion poll commissioned by AKHBAR AL-YAWM 
and carried out by the Administrative Development Center of 
Alexandria University's Commerce College. The poll deals with 
Egypt's regional policy, particularly its relations with Israel 
following the Cold War. 
  On pages 3 through 6 the paper carries a 3,000-word report, 
illustrated with graphics, listing the questions and answers in 
the poll. On page 4 the paper writes: 
  "This is the second time--the first was during the vote on a 
third presidential term--that the public opinion unit of the 
Administrative Development Center in the Commerce College of 
Alexandria University and AKHBAR AL-YAWM has cooperated in 
exploring public views on the strategy that Egypt should follow 
in light of new developments taking place during a critical 
juncture in the history of the Middle East." 
  The paper notes that the poll was designed to shed light on 
the public response to an article by Chief Editor Ibrahim Sa'dah 
published on 26 January 1994 under the headline "Welcome to 
Challenge." The article was followed by a debate in the same 
paper among writers assessing the implications of the peace 
process. Sa'dah, the paper recalls, sees a "challenge" in which 
the country has to choose among the following courses: 
  "1. Holding on to the cold peace with Israel until a 
comprehensive, just, and acceptable peace is achieved in the 
Arab region. 
  "2. Turning the cold peace into a warm one and fully and 
promptly normalizing political and economic relations between 
Egypt and Israel, in view of the urgency with which others are 
moving to normalize their relations with Israel in one form or 
another. 
  "3. [Selecting a course lying within] the spectrum defined 
by the two above-mentioned options." 
  The pollsters, the paper explains, sent a three-part 
questionnaire to "a random sampling of 5,000 individuals from 
various parts of the country." 
  To a question in part one of the questionnaire, 4,879 
respondents, or 98 percent, say they read Sa'dah's article. 
Some 3,335 respondents, or 81 percent, say they agree with 
Sa'dah's call for "a new thinking in Egypt's relations with the 
countries in the region, including Israel." 
  To questions in part two of the questionnaire, 3,885 
respondents, or 94 percent, say they are "ready to get over the 
scars of Arab-Israeli relations and transcend the pain of the 
war." Those who are not ready to forget the past number 230, or 
6 percent. 
  Those who believe that "transforming relations between Egypt 
and Israel into warm cooperation is conditional on the signing 
by all parties of the peace agreements" number 3,250. Those who 
do not see a need for such a condition to be made number 865. 
[percentages not given] 
  Some 3,916 respondents, or 95 percent, think that "Egypt's 
relations, communications, and cooperation with the countries of 
the region without exception should be conducted publicly." 
Those who do not share this belief number 199, or 5 percent. 
  Agreeing that "Israel's repeated aggression reflects 
negatively on relations among the countries of the region" are 
3,257 respondents, while 858 disagree. [percentages not given] 
  Some 3,315 respondents, or 81 percent, believe that "the 
emergence of a Palestinian entity in accordance with the recent 
agreement will have a positive effect on relations within the 
region," while 800, or 19 percent, disagree. 
  Those who believe that Egypt should "wait for the features 
of 
the new international order to take clear shape before it 
changes its current policy of maintaining a `cold peace' with 
Israel" number 261, while 3,845 respondents think that Egypt 
should not wait for this to happen. [percentages not given] 
  Disagreeing with Menachem Begin's view that "peace could be 
achieved with Jewish brains and Arab money" are 3,969 
respondents, or 96 percent. Some 146 respondents, or 4 percent, 
agree with Begin. 
  Some 688 respondents, or 17 percent, think that Israel 
"should disavow its `from the Nile to the Euphrates' claim as a 
condition for cooperation and joint efforts." Those who see no 
need for Israel to disavow such a claim number 3,427, or 83 
percent. 
  Agreeing that "the Egyptian role in building a new regional 
peace and security system will diminish" are 154 respondents, 
while 3961 do not believe in a diminished Egyptian regional 
role. [percentages not given] 
  Those who believe that Egypt "has dealt efficiently with the 
challenges of peace so far" number 3,416, or 83 percent. 
  Some 3,586 respondents "believe they have stopped 
classifying 
countries in the region into foes and friends," while 529 still 
adhere to this categorization. [percentages not given] 
  In the third part of the questionnaire, the respondents are 
asked the question: "What are the issues that you believe the 
important dialogue [commentaries written by intellectuals in 
response to Sa'dah's article] has left out?" The respondents 
cite the following issues: 
  "1. The ability of the leaderships in the region to 
understand the new developments and deal with them intelligently 
and prudently. 
  "2. The water problem. 
  "3. Disarmament and regional mutual security arrangements. 
  "4. GATT and its effect on Egypt and the region and the 
interaction of economic relations in the area."

<F P=106> [Dispatch by Sa'id al-Nahdi from Salalah, Oman, on 20 April] </F>
  [Text] President Muhammad Husni Mubarak will resume talks 
with Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id of Oman in Salalah today. Mubarak 
is scheduled to visit China following his visit here. Yesterday 
the Egyptian president and the Omani monarch reviewed the 
situation on the Arab and international scenes. 
  According to well-informed sources, Mubarak and Qabus 
discussed the Yemeni crisis and the Omani monarch's efforts to 
contain it. Sultan Qabus arranged a meeting between Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid in Salalah on 3 April. During that meeting, the two 
Yemeni officials are said to have reconciled their personal 
differences. 
  The same sources say that Mubarak will brief Sultan Qabus on 
the efforts Egypt and the United Arab Emirates made recently to 
contain the differences between the Yemeni sides and ensure the 
implementation of the Pledge and Accord document signed in Amman 
in February. 
  President Mubarak wants to start his mediation from the 
point 
the Omanis end theirs. Egypt and Oman are eager to preserve 
Yemen's unity and stability, according to the same sources.

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has said that 
President Mubarak's visit to the Sultanate of Oman is within the 
framework of consultations on all the issues that concern the 
two countries as well as the Arab nation. He said that Egypt is 
playing a candid and objective role in resolving the Yemeni 
crisis, noting that an Egyptian envoy has conveyed messages from 
President Mubarak to the Yemeni leaders. He said that the envoy 
is holding talks in Sanaa and Aden in a bid to achieve Yemeni 
reconciliation. [passage omitted] 
  At a news conference today, Musa said that President 
Mubarak's visit to the PRC has important political and economic 
dimensions. He pointed out that the PRC is a major power, plays 
an important role in world policy, and has historic ties with 
Egypt. Both countries have ancient civilizations and have had 
close ties in the modern age. Egypt, he noted, was the first 
Arab and African country to recognize the PRC in 1956. He said 
that special ties link President Mubarak and the PRC leadership. 
He said that the PRC's industrial progress prompts both 
countries to expand their cooperation. He noted that efforts 
should be made to increase Egyptian exports to the PRC. He said 
that exports to the PRC do not exceed $5 million, whereas the 
trade volume between the two countries totals $200 million. 
[passage omitted] 
  On the Iraqi information minister's statement that his 
country has given up its claim on Kuwait, Musa said that Iraq 
must make a clear and definite declaration stating that Kuwait 
is an independent and sovereign state and must end all talk of 
its being the 19th governorate or province of Iraq. This is 
Egypt's position, he stated. [passage omitted].

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by Interior Ministry, date not </F>
given] 
  [Excerpts] Riyadh, 18 Apr -- The Interior Ministry has 
issued a statement saying it is aware that individuals coming to 
the Kingdom to perform the pilgrimage are carrying books and 
leaflets for political, propaganda, or ideological aims. The 
following is the text of the statement: 
  [Passage omitted] Every year and in days similar to these, a 
happy occasion hovers over Muslims, when the hearts of believers 
flutter as they go through these days with their hearts full of 
faith. [passage omitted] 
  This Ministry has noticed that brother individuals coming 
here are carrying -- either with good intentions, and that is 
what we believe, God willing, or with a desire to exploit this 
honorable occasion -- books, photographs, and leaflets for 
political, propaganda, or ideological aims which would have an 
effect on some people or directly harm others, contradicting the 
noble aim of the pilgrimage. 
  Accordingly, the Ministry of the Interior, acting on the 
information it has received, draws attention to the fact that 
such things are totally prohibited. The Ministry hopes to give 
pilgrims the chance to perform their rituals with reverence and 
without being distracted from the worship that is the purpose of 
their visit. While stressing this, the ministry hopes that 
everyone will abide by the above and not overstep the rules. 
Anyone breaking the rules will be punished and returned to the 
place he came from. 
  Punishment will be decisive for anyone found carrying 
prohibited material of any kind. The Kingdom's system of 
punishment will be applied without leniency or mercy, because 
this Ministry's responsibility is to protect the safety of 
pilgrims and citizens and to ensure that this Kingdom is an 
oasis of goodness and safety for all those coming to the house 
of God or to visit the Prophet's mosque. 
  While the Ministry stresses the above to all pilgrims, it 
would like at the same time to remind them of Allah's words: 
"For hajj are the months well known. If anyone undertakes that 
duty therein, let there be no obscenity nor wickedness, nor 
wrangling in the hajj. And whatever good ye do, be sure Allah 
knows it. And take provision with you for the journey, but the 
best of provisions is right conduct. So fear Me, O ye that are 
wise." [Koranic verse]

  [Text] Sanaa, 16 Apr (INA) -- Hamid Yusuf Hammadi, minister 
of culture and information, has said Iraq has proven to the 
Security Council, by concrete evidence, that it has fulfilled 
Section C of Security Council Resolution 687. He stressed that 
the Security Council should now implement Paragraph 22 of the 
resolution by immediately lifting the unjust embargo imposed on 
Iraq. 
  At a news conference in Sanaa today, attended by 
correspondents of Arab and foreign press and news agencies in 
Yemen, Hammadi said the UN Special Commission has been 
monitoring Iraq's weapons of mass destruction for over two 
years. Therefore, U.S. and British allegations that Iraq has 
not complied with the monitoring regime are baseless. 
  The minister of culture and information also spoke about 
Iraq's calls for a Middle East free of weapons of mass 
destruction, the last of which was President Saddam Husayn's 
speech on 2 April 1990. He stressed that the presence of weapons 
of mass destruction in the region is not in the interest of its 
peoples because of what these weapons cause in terms of 
terrorism and threats to peace and security in the region. 
  The minister said Iraq's agreement to implement Section C of 
Security Council Resolution 687 is part of the general framework 
asserted by Paragraph 14 of the same resolution which calls on 
the Security Council to make the Middle East a region free of 
those weapons. 
  Hamid Yusuf Hammadi said this demand reflects Iraq's policy 
that had been adopted long before the aggression. On the next 
Security Council review of the Iraq embargo, Hamid Yusuf Hammdi 
said after Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations, the Security 
Council is asked to fulfill its own obligations by lifting the 
embargo imposed on Iraq. 
  He pointed out that Iraq's diplomatic drive is based on 
explaining facts objectively. This has convinced some major 
nations that Iraq has indeed fulfilled its obligations. He 
underlined, in this regard, the objective stance of France, 
Russia, and China and other countries during the recent Security 
Council session on the Iraq embargo. 
  The minister of culture and information added that the 
position of these countries reflected their conviction that Iraq 
has indeed fulfilled its obligations and that the Security 
Council should now lift the embargo. 
  He said the fact that the Security Council has not issued 
its 
traditional statement in its recent meeting is evidence that 
there is a split within the council between the majority, which 
supports lifting the embargo, and the U.S. and British minority. 
  He said a considerable number of countries are now siding 
with Iraq and seek lifting the embargo and resuming economic 
relations with it. He said the Special Commission's 
procrastination by not fixing a date for starting the monitoring 
means there will be no specific date for lifting the embargo. 
  Asked about the aim of his visit to Yemen, Hammadi said he 
communicated a message from President Saddam Husayn to his 
brother President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih outlining the Iraqi 
leadership's perspective on coordination with Arab and friendly 
nations to lift the sanctions decreed by the UN Security Council. 
  The minister compared the starving and destructive impact of 
the sanctions to that of weapons of mass destruction. 
  On the Kurdish issue, the minister said the U.S. 
Administration applies double standards in dealing with the 
Iraqi Kurds, citing the plight of Kurds in neighboring countries 
who are being killed every day. 
  Hammadi dismissed as groundless Kuwait's claims that Iraq 
detains Kuwaiti prisoners. Iraq is not holding a single 
Kuwaiti, the minister emphasized. This issue has now been 
referred to the Arab League and Red Cross, said the minister. 
  He noted that Iraq had proposed that a committee chaired by 
a 
Moroccan and including deputies from the Kuwaiti National 
Assembly and representatives of the Gulf Cooperation Council 
visit Iraq to pursue the case of the people Kuwait contends are 
missing. 
  Hammadi said it was a distortion to link the sanctions to 
the 
issue of Kuwait. Section C of UN Security Council Resolution 
687, he explained, shows the two are unrelated. Linkage is 
being promoted by the United States to keep the sanctions. 
  Keeping the sanctions in place, he said, is causing 
considerable detriment to the economies of many countries. He 
cited the case of Turkey, which has sustained a $20 billion-loss 
in income due to its suspended trade with Iraq and the cutoff of 
Iraqi oil transiting Turkish territory. 
  The minister disclosed that Iraq has access to valuable 
information related to the World Trade Center bombing in New 
York. Iraq stands ready to cooperate with the United States on 
the matter, preferably under the auspices of the American 
Congress, he indicated. 
  On Iraq's effort to repair the damage wrought by the 
aggression, Hammadi said our success in rebuilding 80 percent of 
our facilities within the span of 11 months has thwarted the 
plans of the United States and its allies. Numerous countries, 
like France, have shown an interest in reestablishing commercial 
and diplomatic ties with Iraq, after they became convinced that 
Iraq has fulfilled the obligations stipulated by UN Security 
Council resolutions, said Hammadi.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Hamud Munsir: "General </F>
People's Congress Denies Sanaa Alliance With al-Turabi 
Conference and Brotherhood"] 
  [Excerpt] London, Sanaa -- 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Anasi, head of 
the general department in the Yemeni General People's Congress 
[GPC], has denied reports of the arrival in Sanaa of delegations 
from Arab and international Islamic movements "to discuss an 
alliance formula with the GPC led by Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG]," the 
northern partners in the ruling coalition in Yemen, in the face 
of a so-called "Egyptian alliance with the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP] against extremist organizations." 
  He made this statement following information supplied to 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT by well-informed sources, namely that Sanaa 
received a delegation from the West German-based Muslim 
Brotherhood's international organization based in West Germany 
and a delegation from the Khartoum-based Arab Islamic [Popular] 
Conference [AIPC] led by Dr. Hasan al-Turabi. 
  The sources added that the two delegations met with 
President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and expressed willingness to support Sanaa 
in its dispute with the Aden-based YSP. 
  The sources said that the proposal for the Muslim 
Brotherhood 
international organization to cooperate with the Yemeni 
leadership "is limited to the ideological aspect" and includes 
moving the headquarters of an Islamic studies center and a 
European-based Islamic magazine to Sanaa, in addition to 
appointing Faris al-Saqqaf, member of the YRG Higher Committee, 
as the magazine's chief editor and providing expertise to 
contribute to the battle against the YSP. 
  As for the AIPC's proposal, the sources said that it 
"stresses the need to prepare for a military battle to secure a 
jihad atmosphere that helps to polarize Islamic mujahidin from 
all over the world in order to wage a war against the YSP and 
prevent it from returning to secularism." The sources added 
that AIPC representatives cited in their proposal what they 
termed "Egypt's supply of military and security experts to Aden." 
  Yemeni television's Channel 2, which transmits from Aden, 
has 
launched a media campaign against "extremism in the name of 
Islam." 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT could not get in touch with Faris 
al-Saqqaf 
yesterday evening, as he was busy with the YRG Higher Committee 
meeting. However, 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Anasi pointed out that 
these reports "are part of the media leaks which the YSP has 
begun to use in the framework of a new shift in its media 
rhetoric to manage the Yemeni crisis." Al-'Anasi said that 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, Yemeni vice president and secretary general of the 
YSP, and Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Presidential 
Council and assistant secretary general of the YSP, "said 
recently that they had uncovered a political Islam plan in Yemen 
against the democratic unionist plan -- which is untrue and has 
nothing to do with political reality in Yemen." He expressed 
his amazement at the YSP's use of this card "to win the West 
over against political forces currently allied with it in 
power." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah: "Yemeni `Military' </F>
Establishment Moves Its Office From Moscow to Warsaw"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- Colonel Muhammad al-Shahari, 
representative of the Yemeni Economic Establishment in East 
Europe, is preparing to open a new office in the Polish capital, 
Warsaw, within days, to continue his task of concluding and 
implementing the deals relating to arms purchased by the Yemeni 
leadership in Sanaa. That is, in the context of deploying and 
arming its military forces in anticipation of any military 
action between the northern General People's Congress forces and 
the southern forces belonging to the Socialist Party, as a 
result of the current crisis threatening Yemen's unity. 
  This development in the Yemeni Economic Establishment comes 
after the decision to change its name, removing the word 
"military," and after the closure of its office in Moscow as a 
result of the state of political openness which Russia is 
currently witnessing and in the light of the Russian military 
attache's participation in the proceedings of the joint military 
committee and his direct acquaintance with the true conditions 
there, as a result of which he regularly informs his government 
of the details of what is happening. While Russia is working to 
join the Western states' community and hence is forced to take 
account of numerous considerations in its foreign policy, 
prompting it to sacrifice some arms sales in states experiencing 
a certain crisis, East European states where communism has 
collapsed continue to look for markets, even for a "few dollars" 
to solve their economic problems, even if it is at others' 
expense. The Economic "Military" Establishment's approach has 
not been affected by the clamor provoked by the Polish press and 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT's report about the arms deals concluded with 
the two Polish companies Cenzin and Cenrex to supply the 
northern armed forces with various types of weapons, after this 
was revealed by Muhammad Sharaf, Yemeni charge d'affaires in 
Warsaw, during his contacts with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim 
Basindwah in Sanaa and later in a telephone conversation with 
Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas in Aden -- because these 
deals conflict with the stipulations of the "Pledge and Accord 
Document," seeking to avoid military aggravation of the Yemeni 
crisis. 
  The Polish arms trade with Yemen actually began on 18 
November 1993, namely when Col. 'Abdallah al-Hadrami, director 
general of the Economic (formerly Military) Establishment, paid 
a 24-hour visit to Warsaw. The visit was a surprise to many 
people. Al-Hadrami rejected the charge d'affaires' request to 
attend his meeting with the chairman of Cenzin responsible for 
war production, so as to prevent him from learning details of 
what was going to be discussed, thus doing away with his efforts 
as official representative of the united Republic of Yemen to 
follow up any action concerning the country. It was decided 
that contacts should be made directly with the Yemeni 
establishment, namely through Col. Muhammad al-Shahari, director 
of its Moscow office. [passage omitted] 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT cooperated with a number of Polish 
journalists to uncover details of the deal and managed to obtain 
copies of the letters sent by the companies Cenzin and Cenrex 
and companies of the visa applications. Polish Economic 
Cooperation Ministry and Foreign Ministry sources approved the 
signing and implementation of the military deals, whose value 
ranges between tens of millions and hundreds of millions of 
dollars. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah: "Yemeni Foreign Minister </F>
Returns Socialist Party Diplomats to Sanaa"] 
  [Excerpt] London, Sanaa, Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Yemeni 
Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah has reshuffled staff 
in Yemeni embassies abroad. The reshuffle affects in particular 
diplomats who come from southern Yemen and those who have close 
links with the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], one of the two 
parties to the Yemeni political crisis. The other party to the 
crisis is the General People's Congress [GPC]. 
  The most notable feature of this reshuffle is the return of 
diplomats "who do not enjoy Sanaa's trust" to Yemen. 
  A source close to the YSP rejected this reshuffle, pointing 
out that a number of embassies have not received their expenses 
for many months, in order to force YSP diplomats to return. The 
source warned that, if these embassies do not receive their 
allowances, Aden will allocate to them allowances that guarantee 
the continuation of their work, lest Yemeni diplomacy become a 
partisan tool in the hands of the GPC. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that Yemeni embassies run by a 
southerner occupying the ambassador post usually has at least 
one northerner on whom Sanaa relies in running most affairs and 
contacts, while the head of the diplomatic mission remains just 
a symbol. 
  A well-informed source has said that the recent diplomatic 
reshuffle is a reaction to the crisis caused by Muhammad Sharaf, 
Yemeni charge d'affaires in Warsaw, who provoked a big clamor 
when he revealed a secret arms deal which the Economic Military 
Establishment had concluded with Poland for the northern 
military command. He refused to issue entry visas for Polish 
arms companies' officials to enable them to visit Sanaa and 
complete the negotiations concerning the deal. 
  It is worth mentioning that the Yemeni Foreign Ministry 
granted some Polish officials visas upon their arrival at Sanaa 
airport. Upon his arrival in Warsaw last Sunday, Fu'ad Sawwaf 
Sivjik [as transliterated], sales director of the Polish company 
Cenzin, said that he had signed a contract worth tens of 
millions of dollars to supply the Yemeni Defense Ministry with 
arms, ammunition, and equipment. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Baghdad, 18 Apr (INA)--Ahmad Yahya al-'Imad, member 
of the Standing Committee of the General People's Congress and 
adviser to the Presidential Council in Yemen, has stressed that 
President Saddam Husayn is one of the Arab nation's immortal 
symbols and embodies the Arab nation's hopes and aspirations for 
a bright future. 
  In a statement to INA, al-'Imad said that he conveyed a 
written message from Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to 
his brother President Saddam Husayn on the close bilateral 
relations, the developments of the Yemeni crisis, and the 
efforts being exerted to overcome it. 
  He added that President Saddam Husayn had a distinguished 
role in the realization of the the Yemeni unity, and that his 
excellency is still extremely interested in safeguarding this 
Yemeni Arab achievement. This, he said, is because the failure 
of this unity is a failure for the Arab nation's hopes to 
achieve Arab unity. 
  Ahmad Yahya al-'Imad denounced the continued unjust blockade 
imposed on the children, women, and elderly of Iraq. He pointed 
out that the imposition of this blockade is considered a serious 
violation of the human rights about which U.S. imperialism and 
its allies brag.

Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid met today with Ambassador Nabil Najm, 
Iraq's permanent envoy to the Arab League. 
  Following the meeting, Ambassador Najm said that he briefed 
the Arab League secretary general on the statement made by Mahdi 
Sa'di Salih, the Iraqi National Assembly speaker, in which he 
invited a Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation to visit Iraq to 
discuss all pending issues between the two countries in order to 
serve pan-Arab causes, fulfill the two sides' interests, and end 
the state of conflict and instability in the region. 
  The Iraqi envoy regretted the decision made by the Lebanese 
Government to sever diplomatic relations with Baghdad. He said 
that this decision came at a time when Iraq was eager to 
normalize its Arab ties.

  [Text] Baghdad, 20 Apr (INA)--Iraq has expressed extreme 
regret over Lebanon's decision to sever its diplomatic ties with 
Iraq, describing it as a hasty decision. 
  A spokesman for the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said today that 
having detained diplomatic employees with diplomatic immunity 
under suspicious circumstances and on the basis of unfounded and 
incorrect accusations, the Lebanese Government has violated the 
provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 
1961, particularly Articles 29 and 31 of this convention. The 
Lebanese Government also rejected an Iraqi proposal to set up a 
joint Iraqi-Lebanese committee to supervise the investigations, 
the spokesman noted. 
  The spokesman stressed that those measures also contravene 
the brotherly relations which should prevail between Arab 
countries. 
  Iraq demands the Lebanese Government to immediately release 
the detained diplomats and not to molest other diplomats in any 
way whatsoever. Iraq also urges the Lebanese Government to show 
respect for its obligations in accordance with the Vienna 
Convention and the rules of international dealing. This would 
be by allowing all our embassy employees in Lebanon without 
exception to leave the Lebanese territory, provide protection 
for them and their families, and maintain the embassy building 
and property. 
  The Iraqi Foreign Ministry held the Lebanese Government 
fully 
responsible for its hasty decision of severing diplomatic 
relations with Iraq and for its erroneous behavior toward the 
Iraqi diplomats. 
  The source hoped that circumstances will prevail in Lebanon 
so that the Lebanese brothers will be able to express their true 
position toward Lebanon-loving Iraq and to rectify this grave 
mistake committed by their government.

  [Text] Baghdad, 20 Apr (INA)--AL-THAWRAH has criticized 
some parties' attempts to harm Iraq's relations with Lebanon, 
describing them as an effort to distract the attention of the 
Lebanese people from the enemies of its sovereignty and unity in 
Damascus and Tel Aviv. 
  The paper, which speaks for the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, 
says in an analysis today that no matter how cunning those 
parties are, nobody will be convinced that Lebanon's problem is 
Iraq. Iraq, the paper maintains, has not been sharing the 
occupation of Lebanon with Israel for approximately 20 years. 
Nor has it been imposing on Lebanon its presidents, prime 
ministers, and Arab and foreign policies. Besides, the history 
of the Iraqi Army is not spoiled with the crimes of the invasion 
of Lebanon, nor has this army turned the Lebanese territory into 
a hotbed of terrorism, kidnappings, and extortion. 
  Referring to the level and quality of Iraq's relations with 
Lebanon, the paper says that Iraq's extremely clean official and 
popular relations with Lebanon are known. They have always been 
based on respect for Lebanon's unity, sovereignty, and 
independent options. They have never advocated any tendencies 
that would harm the unity of the Lebanese people and territory. 
This is well known by all Lebanese.

  [Text] Baghdad, Apr 16, INA--Turkish foreign 
undersecretary, Mr. Ozdem Sanberk said Iraq and Turkey mapped 
out a new formula on resuming Iraqi oil flow via the 
Iraqi-Turkish pipeline over the few next months in a 
non-violation move of the UN conditions. 
  'In an exclusive interview to AL-JUMHURIYAH daily published 
today' the Turkish official hoped that reoperation of the 
pipeline which would be technically tested, would not exceed 
this year's end. [sentence as received] 
  Answering a question on his government's reaction towards 
continuity of the current situation in northern Iraq and the 
possibility of creating problems between the two countries, he 
said this matter was jeopardizing the prospective trade exchange 
between Iraq and Turkey and it had to be settled in favor of 
Iraq's national and territorial integrity. 
  Mr. Sanberk, heading the first ever official Turkish 
delegation to visit Iraq since the end of the 30-state 
aggression on Iraq confirmed the Turkish people's rising calls 
for the government to offer all possible backing to Iraq and 
that the Turkish government began to sense now, more than ever 
before, the necessity of boosting bilateral ties, and intensive 
visits by Turkish officials would be conducted over the coming 
days, Mr. Ozdem added. 
  He added that the delegation had taken a clear picture of 
Iraq's current need of spare parts and equipment that could be 
provided by Turkey during and after the blockade. 
  The Turkish official hailed the efforts exerted by Iraqi 
people to reconstruct, within an exceptional period, what had 
been destroyed by the allies bombing campaigns of 1991.

  [Text] Baghdad, 16 Apr (INA) -- Ozdem Sanberk, under 
secretary of the Turkish Foreign Ministry, left Baghdad today 
after a three-day visit to Iraq. 
  In a statement to INA, the Turkish official said the talks 
that he and his delegation held with a number of Iraqi officials 
were positive and friendly because they were based on the 
historical relations binding the two neighboring countries. 
  The Turkish Foreign Ministry official said that an agreement 
has been reached with Iraq that commercial ties must be restored 
to their status before the blockade was imposed. He indicated 
that it has been agreed to make available the requirements for 
the resumption of these relations, and that Turkey has started 
the required steps for the resumption of commercial relations as 
soon as the blockade is lifted. 
  He stressed that Turkey's current role is to help the 
international community lift the blockade imposed on Iraq and 
end the suffering of its people. He stressed that contacts 
between officials from the neighboring countries' Foreign 
Ministries will continue.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "They Came To Die as Martyrs in </F>
Kurdistan] 
  [Text] The downing of two U.S. helicopters yesterday over 
Iraq's Kurdistan by two U.S. fighter planes was the first of its 
kind in Kurdistan. It was a tragic accident that the Kurdish 
people deeply and bitterly regret. The two helicopters were 
carrying UN officials and military personnel from the 
international protection force that was set up by the United 
Nations for the Kurdish people. 
  The U.S. President was deeply distressed when he announced 
the tragedy to the American people and all other nations. The 
Kurdish people's distress is deeper because it has lost a group 
of friends who came from every corner of the earth to give it 
relief, help it live in peace, and also help in rebuilding 
liberated Kurdistan. The Kurdish people do not want their 
friends to die on Kurdistan's soil or in allied and friendly 
planes that fly over Kurdistan. 
  How splendid it was when the U.S. President said that these 
men were performing their duty of providing protection for the 
Kurdish people and died while performing this duty. 
  The incident has military and strategic significance too. 
Regardless of the confusion or technical error that showed the 
two helicopters on the two fighter planes' radar screens as 
hostile targets -- and investigations will of course reveal the 
cause of this technical error -- the incident has an extremely 
important strategic significance; namely, that it is an 
unambiguous signal to the ruling dictatorship in Baghdad 
confirming that the international protection force is always 
vigilant and actively present and that any hostile move against 
the Kurdish people, territories, and air space will be 
immediately crushed. The international protection force 
operating in Kurdistan has firm and clear orders to abort any 
hostile adventure that the regime of death and crime might think 
of mounting against the Kurdish people. 
  We have the right to regard these courageous men, the 
victims 
of humanitarian duty, as martyrs of the peaceful Kurdish people 
who are faithful to their friends. How nice it would be if the 
Kurdistan region's government and parliament were to issue a 
resolution to this effect. How nice it would be if the Kurdish 
parties were to lower their flags in mourning. How nice it 
would be if we were to erect a monument for them and for all our 
friends and allies who had been killed and martyred, a monument 
that would immortalize them and would be an expression of 
gratitude and a memorial to friendship between man and his 
brother.

  [Text] An official Foreign Ministry source has issued the 
following reaction to Iranian Foreign Ministry contentions on 16 
April about the treatment of some Iranians who are residing in 
Iraq: 
  The Iranian regime's claim that Iranian clerics who have 
been 
residing in Iraq for the past 20 months are now in detention is 
baseless. It is an attempt by the Iranian regime to mislead and 
conceal facts from the Iranian public opinion through false 
allegations. 
  The source said that talk about Iraqi citizens is ridiculous 
and illustrates the Iranian regime's insistence on meddling in 
Iraq's internal affairs that runs counter to a sincere desire on 
the part of Iraq to settle pending issues.

editor has denied Tehran radio's report that Iraq has sent 
persons to Iran to carry out acts of sabotage. 
  The editor said these accusations are ridiculous and part of 
a tendentious media campaign against Iraq. 
  Tehran radio today announced that a huge explosion of a 
booby- trapped car occurred in central Tehran today. 
  Some time after this false accusation by the Iranian 
regime's 
organs, REUTER and the international news media said an Islamic 
group opposing the Iranian regime has claimed responsibility for 
the explosion, and that this group's headquarters is in Pakistan.

<F P=106> ["Text" of appeal from Major General Hasan al-Naqib, member </F>
of the presidential council of the Unified Iraqi National 
Congress, to the Iraqi people and armed forces as published by 
the Congress' mouthpiece AL-MU'TAMAR in this week's edition] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. 
O ye who believe, if a wicked person comes to you with any 
news, ascertain the truth, lest ye harm people unwittingly, and 
afterwards become full of repentance for what ye have done. 
[Koranic verse] 
  O patient and struggling Iraqi people. O valiant sons of our 
armed forces. 
  The dictator is daily persisting with his tyranny and the 
[words indistinct] with the genocide, robbery, and disregard for 
all values. A few days ago, Staff General Iyad Fulayyih, the 
Army chief of staff, and some of his field commanders came out 
for three days to boast of the greatest victory achieved by the 
Iraqi Army in its modern history, in the Mother of Battles war 
as Saddam called it during an explanation of [word indistinct]. 
  What drew attention was the state of discomfiture and 
anxiety 
of the chief of staff, whom we know to be resolute and accurate 
when discussing any of his forces' activities in any of the 
pages of fighting [word indistinct] the battles of his master's 
endless battles. This clearly reflected his fear of digressing 
from what his commander in chief has taught him to say. We do 
not want to be unfair to the man, for what can a person do when 
his neck is under the butcher's knife? 
  For the sake of truth and history, we are letting the people 
and Army hear the voice of fairness. We are confident that they 
know more than we the consequences of this war, consequences 
that were brought about by this military thinker who is behind 
these so-called victories which, according to the chief of 
staff, resulted from the accurate planning and follow-up of the 
implementation by the Iraqi Armed Forces' commander in chief. 
  We ask him: What were these victories? What lethal pocket 
had the enemy forces been trapped in where he [Saddam] inflicted 
heavy losses on them and forced them to halt the war 
unilaterally? In which huge tank battle did his armored forces 
win? Was it the capture of the commanders of five divisions and 
hundreds of commanders or brigades and divisions? Were they the 
tank regiments that were taken to the prisoner-of-war camps in 
Tabuk and Hafr al-Batin? Or were they the tens of thousands of 
officers and other ranks who were taken prisoner? Or were they 
the thousands more innocent soldiers who were burned to death by 
the missiles and air attacks? Or were they the thousands who 
are still missing and whose fate remains unknown? Or were they 
the long columns of destroyed and burned-out tanks, equipment, 
and artillery all along the battle lines? Or was it the 
strategic reserves that were destroyed all along the 
communications lines which cost billions of dollars? 
  O great Iraqi people. O honorable sons of our stricken Army. 
A thousand and one questions we ask with pain and bitterness we 
feel as a result of the catastrophe that has befallen the Iraqi 
people, Army, and [word indistinct] and which was planned and 
implemented by Saddam Husayn and his family which is deeply 
involved in crime and which harbors latent hatred for this 
peaceful and safe country. 
  We tell the tyrant that the hour of reckoning has come. We 
appeal to all the honorable [word indistinct], commanders, 
officers, and other ranks and ask them: Until when will the 
tyrant continue to butcher your brothers and sons, violate 
honor, and trample on values and norms with his [word 
indistinct] feet? O zealous sons of al-Rafidayn, since when have 
you been the tool of a tyrannic ruler's oppression? 
  O honorable brothers. The situation has come to a head. The 
eyes of widows, mothers who have lost their sons, and [words 
indistinct] are looking to you. Your brothers in the Unified 
National Iraqi Congress [UNIC] place all their resources at your 
disposal and you will see them with you in the trench of 
steadfastness. Let us proceed together on the road of 
liberation. Do what you have to do and leave the rest to God. 
There is no help except from God. [Koranic verse] God's 
peace, mercy, and blessings be with you. 
  [Signed] Staff Major General Hasan Mustafa al-Naqib, member 
of the UNIC's presidential council.

  [Text] The army command's units in the al-Sulaymaniyah 
governorate have arrested a woman agent of the Iraqi regime's 
intelligence service. At a news conference held by the army 
command in al-Sulaymaniyah, the criminal, 37-year-old Hajar, 
confessed that in December 1993 she detonated an explosive 
device in the hospital for handicapped people run by Handicap 
International. One citizen was martyred and 10 others were 
injured in that explosion, for which she was paid 50,000 dinars 
by the Iraqi regime. 
  The criminal added that she was arrested while she was 
returning to al-Sulaymaniyah from Baghdad on the night of 13-14 
April. She said that she intended to plant time bombs in the 
hospitals run by international humanitarian aid organizations or 
where foreign doctors work in return for $10,000 from the Iraqi 
regime. 
  In other developments, the army command in Irbil has 
announced that yesterday afternoon its units defused a time bomb 
planted in a downtown park.

  [Text] Ankara, 16 Apr (MENA)--'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Rifa'i, 
Syrian ambassador to Turkey, has stressed that his country is 
against the establishment of an independent Kurdish state in 
northern Iraq, and that Syria will engage in methods other than 
diplomacy to prevent this from happening. 
  In an interview with a MENA correspondent in Ankara, 
al-Rifa'i pointed out that Iraq must be united as any other Arab 
country. He noted that although the Syrian and Iraqi 
governments have differences, the establishment of a separate 
state in northern Iraq is another matter. The differences, he 
added, will not prevent Syria from using its means to stand 
alongside the Iraqi people in the face of this conspiracy. He 
also stressed his country will not use the Kurdistan Workers 
Party, which is outlawed in Turkey, as a source of pressure on 
Ankara to reach a water sharing agreement. 
  Al-Rifa'i pointed out that Syria has as much right to the 
water in the Tigris and Euphrates as Turkey does, adding that 
the Syrian Government still wants an agreement among Syria, 
Iraq, and Turkey on the Tigris and Euphrates water, because the 
present situation cannot continue. He said his country is not 
against Turkey's selling water to Israel, but it prefers for 
Ankara to play the water card to put pressure on Israel to 
withdraw from the occupied Arab territories. 
  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said during his 
recent 
visit to Turkey that Israel is a democratic state. Ambassador 
al-Rifa'i said that these remarks are meant to pacify the 
Turkish people and to convince them that Israel is a 
peace-loving country and that it is the Arabs who are rejecting 
peace. 
  The Syrian ambassador stressed that Peres lied, since more 
than 12,000 Palestinian prisoners are locked up in Israeli 
jails. He added that Israel has failed to implement the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement on time.

  This was announced by Lebanese Information Minister Michel 
Samahah at the end of a session held by the Council of Ministers

  [Text] Information Minister Muhammad Salman said today that 
the departure of the colonialists from the homeland was the 
result of rebellions in various parts of the country and our 
people's heroic struggle for a quarter century until they 
regained their freedom and independence. 
  In an educational seminar held for its students, by the 
Higher Institute for Political Science, Salman spoke on the firm 
principles of the Syrian policy under President Hafiz al-Asad's 
historic leadership in terms of domestic construction and 
political and economic multiplicity, and in terms of the Arab 
solidarity and strengthening the Arab people against the 
cultural invasion to which they are being exposed. 
  Salman spoke about the peace process and its repercussions 
and on obstacles that are preventing its progress. He said: 
Syria supported the peace initiative because it emphasized the 
implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. 
Syria's insistence on a comprehensive solution stems from its 
firm pan-Arab principles. This was manifested at the Geneva 
summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and President Bill 
Clinton where Al-Asad represented the Arabs' stand and desires 
and the U.S. Administration announced its intention to realize 
comprehensive peace on all tracks of the conflict. 
  The minister refuted the motives of the tendentious 
campaigns 
of Israel, the Zionist Lobby, and the media that are sympathetic 
to them. He said the aim of these campaigns is to change the 
firm and pan-Arab position of Syria, whose Arab and 
international role has grown under President al-Asad's 
leadership. This has been voiced by the Arab media which are 
daily reiterating that Syria is the symbol of the pan-Arab 
struggle and the honest helmsman of the Arab ship sailing toward 
the future. 
  At the end of the meeting, Salman answered questions by 
students participating in the seminar. 
  Answering a question, Salman said: I hope Rabin's 
announcement on withdrawal from the Golan will be free of land 
mines which we have always encountered in every session of talks 
in which the principle of withdrawal from all the occupied 
territories in exchange for peace was discussed.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] AL-BA'TH says that it is not new for Israel to heap 
accusations on Syria to tarnish its stands. AL-BA'TH says that 
most Israeli accusations are not worth considering or responding 
to. This is because to respond to some of these accusations, 
which are within the context of lies and deception, requires the 
reassertion of unequivocal facts. Such facts cannot be 
obliterated, irrespective of the allegations fabricated by 
Israel. A sample of such accusations is that whenever the 
national Lebanese resistance deals a painful blow to the Zionist 
occupation troops and their agents, Israel starts leveling 
accusations amounting to blatant threats against Syria. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: Although Syria's stands on the peace process 
are constant, principled, and clear, the Rabin government's 
accusations are ready and repetitive, occurring whenever Syria 
makes it clear that it will not respond to Israel's terms and 
peace proposals which guarantee nothing but Israel's interests 
and ambitions. 
  AL-BA'TH stresses that Israel's accusations against the 
resistance in Lebanon are part of the pressures being exercised 
against Lebanon in the course of the peace process. Moreover, 
the scope of such accusations is often expanded to include Syria 
by alluding to alleged Syrian pressures against Lebanon. 
  Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: Facts on the ground will remain 
stronger than any attempt at falsification. Lebanon's right to 
resist the occupation is legitimate. Lebanon needs nobody to 
tell it what to do in this regard or to interfere in its 
affairs. Lebanon is exercising a natural right. It adopts 
stands that maintain its rights and sovereignty, inspired by its 
national and pan-Arab interest. The voices that have joined 
Israel and begun to accuse Syria of interfering in Lebanon's 
affairs are not worth responding to or commenting on. Under its 
legitimate leadership and cohesive national unity, Lebanon will 
remain greater than accusations. It will not be harmed for 
opting for brotherly relations with Syria in the interest of the 
two sisterly countries. 
  TISHRIN comments on Israeli proposals in southern Lebanon 
and 
the future of the Golan Heights. It says: These days, the 
Israelis are talking much about proposals and plans to activate 
the peace process regarding both southern Lebanon and the Golan. 
However, the Israelis have failed to reveal the content of 
their proposals, and whether they are based on full withdrawal, 
or, like previous Israeli proposals, are a new attempt to 
circumvent UN resolutions. 
  TISHRIN stresses that Syria's position in this regard is 
clear and unmistakable. Syria is eager to expedite and activate 
the peace talks. At the same time, Syria adheres to the Madrid 
conference formula and the constants of a just, comprehensive 
peace. Syria will not relinquish one inch of the Golan, nor 
will it ever bargain over its undeniable right to restore it. 
  TISHRIN contends that Syria does not need papers to activate 
the Syrian track. As the Israeli rulers are well aware, Syria's 
stands are based on right, justice, international legitimacy, 
and on the fact that only the full removal of the occupation 
from the Arab territories is the path that will lead to a 
successful, durable peace. As long as Israel is far from that, 
then it is only fair to say that the national Lebanese 
resistance to the Israeli schemes in southern Lebanon and 
confronting the Israeli policy of aggression, expansion, and 
repression is legitimate. This is because resistance targets 
the occupation and seeks to defend southern Lebanon against the 
aggressive Israeli control. 
  TISHRIN stresses that any Israeli talk about partial or 
limited withdrawals and about proposals that do not speak of 
full withdrawal and terminating the occupation of southern 
Lebanon and the Golan are yet another rejected and denounced 
Israeli attempt to maintain the occupation. So are phased 
solutions. The allegation that what is urgent is to arrive at 
security arrangements is an Israeli illusion. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: Israel would be gravely mistaken 
if it believes that it will be able to follow a policy of 
blacking out facts. Withdrawal from the entire occupied 
territories needs no interpretations. It needs only a sincere 
desire to implement the resolutions of the international 
legitimacy. The road to peace starts with full withdrawal. 
Only such a withdrawal will lead to the achievement of peace.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Occupation Is the Cause"] </F>
  [Text] Israel quaked again for the second time in less than 
a week as a result of the Hadera operation carried out in the 
heart of the Zionist entity near Tel Aviv. This proves that 
through measures of repression, terrorism, and siege, the 
Israeli occupation forces cannot guarantee security and 
stability in the 1967 occupied territories or in the 1948 
territories. This shows Israel's propaganda that its plans and 
proposals can guarantee the achievement of peace is mere 
illusion and imagination. Israel is reaping the results and 
effects of its policy of continued occupation. It is reaping 
what it has planted in lies, delusions, and claims. All these 
confirm that partial agreements and separate deals cannot make 
peace or lead to security and peace, but to further disturbances 
and confusion, and to the escalation of violence and bloodshed. 
Developments and facts in the occupied territories prove Israel 
has fallen into the impasse of fragile and destructive 
settlements. It caused the situation to explode due to its 
adherence to occupation and disregard of the just and 
comprehensive solution, and as a result of its maneuverings and 
delusions to circumvent the resolutions of international 
legitimacy. 
  Certainly, the situation can expect to see additional grave 
dangers and damaging repercussions if Israel continues its 
repressive and terroristic policy, and its rejection of the 
pillars of a just and comprehensive peace. This is because 
occupation, or any part of it, is the problem. In fact, it is 
the major obstacle to achieving security and stability in the 
region. Undoubtedly, the full removal of the occupation of the 
Arab territories in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, 
southern Lebanon, and Golan, is the true ground for an 
honorable, lasting, and successful peace. As long as Israel 
continues to avoid this, it will be responsible for the cycle of 
violence, and for the anger, indignation, and explosions in the 
occupied Arab territories. These are impossible to bridle or 
stop by continuing the occupation. 
  Had Israel been really concerned about security and 
stability, it would have immediately managed to learn from and 
to comprehend what is taking place by announcing it is ready to 
withdraw from the occupied Arab territories, to respond 
positively to the requirements of a just and comprehensive 
peace, and to abide by the resolutions of international 
legitimacy, the Madrid formula and principles, particularly the 
land-for-peace principle. However, instead of doing so, it 
maneuvered, cheated, and did its best to drag the Palestinian 
side into making further concessions leading to partial 
agreements and separate secret deals. The result of this was 
that the Oslo agreement's repercussions, and threats to and 
relinquishment of the Palestinian people's rights have reflected 
negatively not only on the Palestinians who signed the 
agreement, but also on Israel itself. This is because the 
Palestinian people discovered in this agreement full 
relinquishment of their national, legitimate, and political 
rights, flagrant violation of their just demands, and full 
liquidation of their cause, for the sake of which they have been 
waging a struggle so it will continue to live as a cause of a 
people striving for liberation and salvation from the yoke of 
occupation, and for living in peace, security, and stability. 
  Therefore, under no circumstances should one ask the victim 
to ignore its killer. After all these sacrifices and 
confrontations, the Palestinian people should not submit or 
yield to capitulatory deals, or accept the continuation of 
occupation. The fact is that all parties have participated in 
the peace process knowing it is comprehensive. Otherwise, the 
Madrid conference would not have been convened. So, we should 
go back to the bases of the Madrid formula, to facts that have 
become axioms, and to established facts stressing the need for a 
just and comprehensive peace, especially since this is the only 
means to prevent disturbances, end setbacks, catastrophes and 
tragedies, uproot the manifestations of violence and 
counteractions, and the causes of terrorism, repression, siege, 
and Israeli occupation.

  [Text] Hims -- The Chinese industrial and trade delegation 
has concluded its talks with members of the Hims Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry as well as the city's industrialists and 
investors with an agreement to establish several industrial 
projects in which the Chinese side will enter as a partner with 
49 percent of the shares of each project. 
  The Chinese delegation arrived in Syria several days ago 
headed by (Wang Shu Hua), deputy minister of industry and 
director of foreign investments, and including several 
economists and directors of major industries in China. The 
delegation held several working meetings and contacts in 
Damascus, Latakia, and Hims during which an agreement was 
reached on several industrial projects as follows: 
  -- A plant for assembling pickups which will be established 
in the Tartus Free Zone, in which the Chinese side will 
contribute 90 percent of the machinery and equipment and will 
receive 49 percent of the project's profits. The Syrian side 
will contribute the remaining costs of equipment in addition to 
providing the land, the building, and the other requirements of 
the project. It will receive 51 percent of the profits. The 
project, which will be under joint Syrian-Chinese management, 
will begin production nine months after obtaining the approvals 
and completing the necessary legal procedures. 
  -- A plant for assembling micro-buses which will also be 
established in the free zone under the same previous terms. 
  -- A plant for assembling electronic products (computers, 
TV sets, VCR's, calculating machines, and so forth). 
  -- A plant for ordinary bicyles to be established in the 
Hims Governorate. 
  -- A plant for metal cans (to cover the needs of mineral 
water and soft drink plants in the countries of the region) with 
a production ranging from 300 to 500 million cans annually. 
  -- A plant for spark plugs with a production of 200 
million annually at a cost of $8.5 million. Its raw materials 
are fully available in Syria. 
  -- Two projects for the production of acrylic threads and 
textile printing to be established in Homs Governorate. 
  -- The Chinese delegation also agreed with the Latakia 
Workers Union and the Ministry of Tourism to establish a hotel 
and a tourist complex in Latakia with Chinese architectural 
design. 
  The chairman of the Hims Chamber of Commerce proposed adding 
four other projects. The Chinese side said it will give its 
approval after studying them in detail. They are projects for 
producing lemon juice, medical and industrial alcohol, glucose, 
and dry ice. 
  TISHRIN observed the great enthusiasm and full readiness of 
the Chinese delegation to carry out any project in Syria. It 
also felt that the delegation is very well informed on the laws 
and climate of investment in Syria and fully understood the 
economic future of the region.

  [Text] Turkey has turned down a political asylum 
application from General Dostam, head of the militia. This 
point has been disclosed in a report of the MUJAHED newspaper, 
Jami'at-e Eslami's [Islamic Society of Afghanistan's] 
publication organ, in its recent issue. The report says that 
after consecutive defeats in Kabul and in northern areas of 
Afghanistan, General Dostam asked for political asylum in 
Turkey, which turned it down. The report adds that he has 
bought a house in Germany in preparation for an escape. A 
Bakhtar Information Agency political commentator in this respect 
writes: General Dostam attempted a coup d'etat on 11th Jadi [1 
January] at the instigation of foreign countries and in 
cooperation with Golboddin Hekmatyar. He now seeks ways of 
escaping. The report says Dostam and Golboddin believed at the 
outset they would do away with the islamic state in two hours. 
But four months later the putschists increasingly receive 
crushing blows.

  [Text] Militias of Golboddin and Dostam killed a number of 
each others men in Kabul as a result of differences on dividing 
up looted goods. Reports received by Bakhtar Information Agency 
say the clashes have mainly occurred between the militias of 
Golboddin and Dostam for the looted goods of Kabul residents. 
As many as three Dostam's militia have been taken prisoner by 
Golboddin's militia, and the prisoners were later killed. 
According to another report, in the course of clashes between 
Haji Zarif's men--who are associated with Golboddin's 
militia--and Dostam's militia, 19 Dostam militiamen were killed 
and three Golboddin militiamen were badly injured. Another 
report says that some days ago a cousin of Zardad, a commander 
of Golboddin's militia, was captured by Dostam's militia, and in 
retaliation, Golboddin's militia killed Sofi Karim, a Dostam 
militia ringleader, in Karta-e Naw area. Reports say the motive 
of the clashes between the militias of Golboddin and Dostam have 
been the dividing up of looted goods and the sale of weapons; 
this has increased their previous differences.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 20 (AFP) -- India has temporarily 
capped its ambitious Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) 
programme, apparently because of a fiscal crunch, a newspaper 
reported Wednesday. 
  The government has indefinitely postponed further trials of 
the "Agni" (Fire) missile, which has a range of 2,500 kilometers 
(1,560 miles), THE HINDUSTAN TIMES said. 
  The temporary capping "is being attributed to a financial 
cruch," it said, but added that the postponment was seen as a 
concession to American concerns about India's missile programme. 
  Indian officials were not available to comment on THE TIMES 
report. 
  The United States has been pressing India to stop 
development 
of the missile which can carry a nuclear or conventional warhead 
or put a payload weighing one tonne in orbit. 
  Washington says Agni, which forms part of India's Integrated 
Missile Development Programme launched [words indistinct] could 
lead to missile proliferation in the region. 
  India, which in 1974 carried out a nuclear test but claimed 
its nuclear programme was entirely peaceful, has described its 
missile programme as a "non-nuclear deterrent." 
  The newspaper said the Defence Research Development 
Organisation (DRDO) had sought some 17 million dollars to 
conduct three more Agni test launches but the government had not 
responded, citing a shortage of funds. 
  "Defence sources claimed that India was not going to abandon 
its strategic missile programme under American pressure, but 
admitted that some delays would now be inevitable," it said. 
  India's missle programme also envisages the development of 
an 
Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile with double the range of 
Agni. It has also developed an array of weapons systems 
including surface- to-air, surface-to-surface, anti-ship and 
anti-tank rockets. 
  THE TIMES added that India had meanwhile finalised a deal to 
buy 30 fourth generation MiG-29M fighter aircraft from Russia, 
apparently in response to a U.S. proposal to sell 38 F-16 jets 
to Pakistan. 
  "There is every possibility that India may start getting the 
MiG-29M even before the U.S. Senate gives the nod for the supply 
of F-16s to Pakistan, "it said. 
  The White House has asked the U.S. Congress for a one-time 
waiver of an amendment barring military sales to Pakistan 
because of its nuclear weapons programme to allow it deliver the 
F-16s. 
  THE TIMES described the MiG-29Ms as "highly sophisticated," 
with all-weather radar system. They are "rated better than the 
F-16s in most respects, except for their armament load 
capacity," it added. 
  India has fought three wars with Pakistan and one with 
China.

  [Text] The opposition in the Rajya Sabha [upper house] made 
a scathing attack on the government for signing the GATT 
agreement. Putting up a strong defense, the treasury benches 
asserted that the country's interests will not be undermined in 
any manner. They also accused the opposition of launching a 
misinformation campaign for political purposes. The GATT issue 
dominated the day's proceedings and the house witnessed noisy 
exchanges and procedural wrangles. The deputy chairperson, Dr. 
Najma Heptulla, allowed a discussion on the suo moto statement 
made by the commerce minister. Mr. Pranab Mukherjee told the 
house that India has only authenticated the final act of the 
Uruguay Round, the outcome of the seven-year-long multilateral 
trade negotiations. Mr. Mukherjee said India and a number of 
developing countries have decided to work out a joint response 
to any attempt to link social policy issues with trade. He also 
stated that the preparatory committee of the World Trade 
Organization will discuss the future agenda, but the decisions 
will be taken by consensus. 
  Initiating the discussion, Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi, BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party], argued it is against the spirit of 
several constitutional provisions and undermines the rights of 
the state governments. Dr. Joshi contended that the country 
stands to lose even in respect of trade-related patents and 
investment measures. Rebutting the allegations, Mr. Jagdish 
Desai, Congress-I, said subsidies for farmers will continue 
unhindered. Asserting that the GATT agreement will help the 
country push up exports in five years, the Congress-I member 
said the fears about the unrestricted entry of multinational 
corporations are unfounded. The discussion remained 
inconclusive. 
  The Lok Sabha [lower house] was adjourned for the day today 
without transacting any business following noisy protests by the 
opposition over the signing of the new GATT accord. Trouble 
began as soon as the house met this morning and continued even 
after its adjournment for one hour. The entire opposition was 
on its seats shouting slogans. The National Front, the Left 
Front, and AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] 
members trooped into the well of the house. Some of them were 
seen waiving copies of a Hindi daily. The opposition leaders, 
including Mr. L.K. Advani and Mr. Somnath Chatterjee, were 
trying to speak but nothing could be heard in the din. The 
deputy speaker, who was in the chair, adjourned the house for 
the day. The house will meet on Thursday morning after the Ram 
Navami holiday tomorrow. 
  The Janata Dal leader, Mr. V.P. Singh, says the government 
should try to get concessions in the new GATT agreement in the 
interests of the nation. Addressing a news conference in 
Parliament House, he said New Delhi should rally the developing 
countries and mobilize public opinion at home for changes in the 
GATT accord. The Janata Dal leader expressed the view that 
parliament should be empowered to ratify such far-reaching 
agreement and it should not be left to the discussion of the 
executive.

  [Text] Developing countries have decided to resist unitedly 
against any attempt by some countries to link social issues with 
the trade policy. Making a suo moto statement in the Rajya 
Sabha today, the commerce minister, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, said 
that some European countries and the United States tried to link 
the extraneous issues with the accord. India, along with some 
other countries, attached greater importance to the matter, like 
restrictive business practices and immigration policies. He 
said none of these issues became the subject of a multilateral 
decision or declaration. The preparatory committee of the WTO 
[World Trade Organization] will discuss whether to include these 
issues in the future agenda of the WTO. Mr. Mukherjee asserted 
any decision on these issues can only be taken by consensus.

  [Text] The government has decided to import edible oil, 
sugar, and cotton under the Open General License. The decision 
was taken at a high-level meeting in New Delhi chaired by the 
prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao. The three commodities 
will now be permitted to be imported at almost zero level duty 
to ensure availability and to check the rising trend in prices. 
The government has already made arrangements for import of 1 
lakh tons of sugar. Of this 40,000 tons is expected to reach 
the country by this month-end. Import of 50,000 tons of edible 
oil has already been cleared. 
  The meeting was attended by the Finance Minister Dr. 
Manmohan 
Singh; the Commerce Minister Mr. Pranab Mukherjee; the 
Agriculture Minister Mr. Mr. Balram Jakhar; the Civil Supplies 
Minister Mr. A.K. Antony; and the minister of state for food,

  [Text] NEW DELHI, 8 April--The Russian Federation is of the 
view that the American offer of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan in 
return for a "verifiable" capping of the latter's fissile 
material production programme could unleash an arms race in 
South Asia. 
  This was stated at a Press conference here today by Mr. 
Aleksandr Panov, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia. He said 
Moscow favours international guarantees rather than "trade-offs" 
of the nature being attempted by Washington to promote its 
non-proliferation objectives. 
  That the U.S. has offered to Islamabad a one-time waiver of 
the Pressler Law to facilitate the supply of the 
deep-penetration jets, was confirmed by Mr. Strobe Talbott, the 
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, before leaving for the Pakistani 
capital this afternoon following discussions in New Delhi. 
Asked whether the American proposal made any sense to him, Mr. 
Panov, who is leading his country's delegation at the ongoing 
50th session of ESCAP, quipped "It makes sense for the U.S. 
industry which is manufacturing the F-16 aircraft. The Russian 
Minister's observations clearly indicated that Moscow's support 
can no longer be taken for granted by Washington on crucial 
international issues. Mr. Panov said though the U.S. was 
contemplating similar trade-offs in the Korean Peninsula, the 
resolution of the nuclear imbroglio there wouldn't be possible 
without the involvement of the Russian Federation. "Our highest 
priority is to strengthen the non-proliferation regimes," he 
observed to add: "We are for international guarantees..." 
  The Minister remarked that in cases where the treaty (NPT) 
or 
regime was already in place, the emphasis should be on its 
compliance. As for South Asia, he suggested that an 
international conference with broad participation could be 
convened. Various CBMs (Confidence Building Measures) and 
procedures for transparency in military activities could also be 
discussed under its umbrella besides non-proliferation. 
  "Your country stands for broader participation (in such a 
conference). We support that," the Minister noted. He said the 
exact number of participants at the conference can be determined 
once there was agreement in principle to hold it. Commenting on 
the U.S. proposal listing Germany, Japan, India and Pakistan 
besides the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, 
Mr. Panov mentioned that Kazakhstan has also evinced interest 
and would like to be part of the exercise. 
  The efforts by the U.S. and the IAEA [International Atomic 
Energy Agency] to resolve bilaterally the nuclear problem in the 
Korean peninsula haven't shown results, the Minister said. He 
offered as an option a multilateral conference with 
representatives of the UN and the IAEA. 
  Mr. Panov disclosed that it has been agreed in principle 
that 
Prime Minister Narasimha Rao would visit Moscow in June, 
possibly mid-June, though the exact dates were yet to be 
finalised. Discussions are currently underway on the "substance" 
of the visit and agreements to be signed. 
  Various possibilities to enhance militancy [as published] 
cooperation between India and Russia were being explored. One 
among them was the supply of MiG 29 aircraft though the parleys 
are at the initial stage, Mr. Panov informed. He said 
agreements on aviation transportation and cooperation in "Space 
Development" were likely during Mr. Rao's visit. 
  Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev's visit to India 
that was postponed due to sudden developments in West Asia, was 
very much on the Indo-Russian agenda and could take place after 
Mr. Rao has been to Moscow.

  [Text] Kandy, April 16, IRNA -- Visiting Iranian Majles 
Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri said here Saturday that U.S. 
presence in the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean was disturbing 
regional peoples. 
  "We feel ourselves duty-bound not to let the U.S. endanger 
the security of the region through its provocative presence," 
Nateq-Nuri told Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Abdulqader Shahul 
Hameed. 
  Nateq-Nuri said that this required more coordination among 
regional countries, a goal which he said, the Islamic Repulic of 
Iran was trying to achieve. 
  The Iranian parliamentarian also voiced Iran's readiness to 
help Sri Lanka overcome its internal problems. 
  Shahul Hameed said that Iran enjoyed special status in the 
international community and that his country praised Tehran's 
international "constructive" role. 
  Referring to the closure of Israeli Embassy in Colombo, 
Shahul Hameed said that Sri Lanka insisted that all occupied 
lands should be returned to their owners and the Palestinian 
people should be given their denied rights. 
  He reiterated that Colombo's stance on Israel depended on 
the 
vindication of the Palestinain people's rights. 
  Iran and Sri Lanka along with other countries in the region 
should expand cooperation in an effort to prevent domination of 
a country by another.

  [Text] Colombo, April 17, IRNA -- Iran's parliament 
(Majles) Speaker Hojjat-ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri left Sri 
Lanka for Malaysia Sunday morning at the end of his three-day 
visit here. 
  While in Sri Lanka, the speaker held talks with the Sri 
Lankan president, his counterpart and a number of Muslim 
personalities in that country. 
  Nateq-Nuri will visit Malaysia at the end of his 
three-nation 
tour which has already brought him to Pakistan and Sri Lanka. 
  Before his departure from Colombo, the speaker met with a 
number of Sri Lankan Shiite and Sunni Muslim scholars and 
writers in which he criticized the indifferent attitude that 
international bodies have adopted towards problems facing 
Muslims in the world. 
  Nateq-Nuri referred to the deplorable situation in Gorazde 
where a large number of people have been subject to Serbs 
attacks in recent days and blamed the biased stance of the 
international communities towards the issue. 
  He said that international bodies and the NATO were not only 
watching the genocide of people in Bosnia-Herzegovina but were 
trying to divert the world's public opinion from the Serbs 
crimes by the means of a few statements. 
  The speaker said that the U.S. and its allies were trying to 
annihilate Muslims throughout the world irrespective of being 
Shiite or Sunni, either living in Iran or in any other part of 
the world. 
  Calling on the Sri Lankan Muslims to maitain unity, 
Nateq-Nuri promised that an Iranian delegation would visit Sri 
Lanka in a near future to study situation of Muslims who have 
become homeless as a result of Tamil Tigers attacks. 
  About 170,000 Sri Lankan Muslims, residing in northern and 
eastern parts of the country, have been rendered homeless by 
Tamil Tigers who oppose the government.

  [Text] Four container loads of chemicals being shipped from 
India to an Egyptian port have been detained in the Colombo 
harbor. According to reliable sources the containers each 
weighing 18 tonnes and carrying phosphorous penta-sulphide, an 
active ingredient in the manufacture of nerve gas outlawed 
worldwide, were on trans-shipments via the Colombo port when 
detained pending investigation. According to a senior port 
official, the shipment was stopped and the containers placed 
under security following instructions by both the Ministries of 
Defense and Foreign Affairs. Three of the containers had 
arrived in Colombo on board a Panamanian vessel (Everbridge) on 
April the 10th, while one had arrived earlier on board the ship 
(Zim Barcelona). The senior defense officials said that the 
containers were detained following information that they 
contained cargo being shipped in violation of international 
agreements. Assistant secretary of defense, Mr. (Mahinder 
Bandasena), said that the ministry has arranged for the cargo to 
be examined, but he declined to divulge who would conduct the 
examination.

  [Text] Colombo, April 15 (AFP) -- President Dingiri Banda 
Wijetunga Friday banned ruling party MP's [members of 
parliament] from travelling abroad and said they should pay more 
attention to their local constituencies in preparation for the 
December presidential polls. 
  Wijetunga told his legislators that they "should devote 
their 
full time and energy to prepare" for the upcoming elections. 
The travel ban will take effect May 1, Wijetunga said in his 
letter released to the press Friday. 
  "I am sure you will appreciate that I have to be very strict 
in this matter, in the interest of the government parliamentary 
group, as well as in the national interest," he told the 125 
legislators of the UNP [United National Party]. 
  The ban followed the UNP's humiliating defeat at a key local 
election last month. Analysts have said that the setback at the 
southern provincial council could trigger a national trend. 
  The UNP came to power in 1977 and has since won every 
election except the May 24 local council vote. The defeat has 
sent shock waves through the UNP, which will field Wijetunga as 
its presidential candidate in the December polls.

  [Text] Appeal Public Attorney Munif 'Uwaydat today 
announced that the Lebanese judiciary has lifted the diplomatic 
immunity of the two Iraqi diplomats accused of assassinating 
Iraqi oppositionist Talib al-Suhayl. He pointed out that now 
that the diplomatic ties between Iraq and Lebanon are severed, 
the two do not enjoy diplomatic immunity. Speaking to reporters 
today, 'Uwaydat added that the two detained defendants will be 
tried by the Lebanese judiciary. 
  [Paris AFP in English at 1317 GMT on 19 April, in a related 
item reports: "The Lebanese Foreign Ministry notified Iraqi 
charge d'affaires 'Awad Fakhri of Lebanon's decision to cut ties 
with Iraq and told him that he had 72 hours to leave Lebanon 
along with the embassy's other diplomats. 
  ["Fakhri said his country still considered that Khalaf and 
Kazim were protected by their immunity, which Baghdad refused to 
lift after a request from Lebanon last week. Baghdad has denied 
any involvement in the murder. 
  ["Lebanon must respect the Vienna convention," which 
regulates diplomatic ties between states, he said after leaving 
the Lebanese Foreign Ministry. He declined to make other 
statements." 
  [The AFP report continues: "Lebanon is also demanding that 
Iraq hand over two other suspects -- embassy guard Hadi Hasan 
who is believed to be the one who pulled the trigger and consul 
'Ali Darwish -- who have sought refuge inside the embassy. 
  ["Police reinforcements have been deployed since last 
Wednesday around the compound in the residential district of 
al-Hazmiyah south of Beirut."]

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry has notified Iraqi Charge 
d'Affaires 'Awad Fakhri of the cabinet's decision to sever 
diplomatic ties with Iraq. Ambassador Zafir al-Hasan 
communicated the decision to Fakhri at 1230 today. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz commented on the 
circumstances surrounding the cabinet's decision at an emergency 
session yesterday to sever ties with Iraq and close the Iraqi 
Embassy in Beirut, in view of the Iraqi Government's refusal to 
hand over certain individuals involved in the assassination of 
Iraqi oppositionist Talib al-Suhayl al-Tamimi. 
  More details from our Foreign Ministry correspondent Khalil 
Fulayhan: 
  [Begin recording] [Fulayhan] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz 
commented on yesterday's cabinet decision to sever diplomatic 
ties with Iraq, close down the Iraqi Embassy in Lebanon, and 
deport its diplomatic staff within 72 hours. Buwayz said: 
  [Buwayz] You may know that a number of people from the Iraqi 
diplomatic mission are involved in the assassination that took 
place in Beirut. A number of those involved in the 
assassination have been arrested, including certain individuals 
who are not members of the Iraqi diplomatic mission. It is a 
clear case of a premeditated crime. 
  On the basis of the above, and with the refusal of the Iraqi 
Government to hand over the remaining culprits and lift 
diplomatic immunity from some of the embassy staff so that 
justice may take its course, the Lebanese Government decided to 
sever diplomatic ties between Lebanon and Iraq and declared the 
members of the Iraqi diplomatic mission personae non grata. The 
government left it to the Lebanese judiciary to decide whether 
diplomatic immunity remains valid in such cases. A number of 
the defendants, we must remember, have confessed that they 
carried out this operation with direct orders from the Iraqi 
intelligence service but without instructions or direct orders 
from the head of their mission in Lebanon. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Your Excellency, who will take 
care of the Lebanese interests in Iraq? 
  [Buwayz] There are diplomatic procedures that apply in this 
case. We in the Foreign Ministry will make a decision in this 
regard soon. 
  [Correspondent] How many Lebanese work in Iraq? Is it 
12,000? 
  [Buwayz] No. The official figure speaks of less than 1,500. 
  [Correspondent] What measures will you take if Iraq refuses 
to lift the immunity of the two other defendants? 
  [Buwayz] As I said, we left it to the Lebanese judiciary to 
decide whether diplomatic immunity remains valid in this case. 
This is a clear case. The defendants have made detailed 
confessions stating that they received orders from the 
Intelligence Service, directly from Baghdad. It is a case of 
flagrant and premeditated murder. 
  [Correspondent] Regarding the duration of the detention, how 
long can you keep the culprits in temporary custody? 
  [Buwayz] Until the investigating magistrate makes the 
appropriate decision in the case. 
  [Correspondent] How about the individuals who are holed up 
in 
the Iraqi Embassy, do you want them [words indistinct]? 
  [Buwayz] No. We have made a clear request for the 
nondiplomatic persons who are currently in the embassy to be 
handed over. 
  [Correspondent] Is there anyone other than the consul and 
.... 
  [Buwayz, interrupting] There are still two people wanted by 
the Lebanese authorities. 
  [Fulayhan] Ambassador Zafir al-Hasan, Foreign Ministry 
secretary general, summoned Iraq's Charge d'Affaires to Lebanon 
'Awad Fakhri today and notified him of the cabinet's decision. 
This is Khalil Fulayhan speaking to you from the Foreign 
Ministry. [end recording]

  [Text] Hizballah issued a statement today saying that the 
participation of an official Zionist delegation in a conference 
on water held in Oman is a serious development that proves the 
Arab regimes' failure to observe the boycott of Israel. The 
statement notes that the willingness to cooperate with the 
Zionist enemy, which engages in the most brutal and criminal 
practices against the Lebanese and Palestinian people, is 
tantamount to encouraging such aggression and acquitting Israel 
of its dreadful crimes. 
  Hizballah warned that such cooperation will undermine all 
chances for regaining the usurped rights.

  [Excerpts] The [Hizballah-backed FM transmitter] "Voice of 
Light" yesterday commemorated the first anniversary of the death 
of its director general, Dr. Hasan al-Qila. The ceremony, which 
was held at the Rawdat al-Shahidayn School, was attended by 
Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah, Deputies Muhammad 
Yaghi and Muhammad Barjawi, Dean of Sciences College Dr. Muhsin 
Jabir, and a number of Hizballah and Islamic resistance 
officials. 
  Yusuf Nur-al-Din, current director general of the Voice of 
Light, delivered a speech in which he underlined the feats of 
the late director general. He criticized the cabinet's decision 
to ban the broadcast of newscasts and political programs. 
[passage omitted] 
  Hasan Nasrallah said that the Voice of Light is not a 
militia 
radio, it is the voice of the honorable resistance. This radio 
has never been a tool to sow sectarian sedition. It is the 
voice of national unity, amity, and knowledge. 
  He added: We regret that on this anniversary we have to 
mourn the loss of part of the freedoms in this country. The 
Voice of Light could be silenced for some time but it will 
certainly come back. This kind of voice can never be silenced, 
and nobody can silence the voice of right and justice. What we 
have heard so far of claims and pretexts concerning the 
procedures against the audio and visual media are not 
convincing. If the Lebanese authority had enough courage to 
dissolve the Lebanese Forces-Israeli party, it can silence the 
voices that are considered Israel's tools. 
  The Hizballah secretary general said that the deliberations 
that took place during the recent cabinet's session were 
theatrical, stressing that such maneuvers could possibly be made 
in other countries but here it is difficult to fool anyone. 
  Nasrallah urged the Lebanese to adopt a unified stance to 
curb this threat and to advise the authorities that the Lebanese 
people cannot accept such procedures that could harm peace.

  [Text] Amman--A vessel carrying Canadian newsprint and 
unprocessed sanitary paper for the Jordanian market Monday 
became the 13th ship denied entry to al-'Aqabah this year by the 
U.S.-led naval force patrolling the Red Sea, shipping officials 
said. 
  The interception comes amid stepped-up contacts by Jordan to 
put an end to the damaging inspection of all al-'Aqabah-bound 
vessels as part of enforcing the 45-month-old international 
sanctions against Iraq. 
  Jordan, which is staying away from formal participation in 
the U.S.-backed Arab-Israeli peace negotiations until the 
blockade of al-'Aqabah is lifted, is exerting efforts with 
France, Britain and other countries in an effort to prevent 
further economic losses caused by the costly delays resulting 
from the Red Sea inspections. 
  It is estimated that Jordan lost $1.2 billion in extra 
charges levied by shipowners on freight to Aqaba because of the 
uncertainties over the fate of Jordan-bound cargo at the mercy 
of the inspectors backed by the U.S. navy. 
  Beyond the economic losses, Jordan has said, that the 
inspections and delays are deliberate harassment aimed at 
pressuring the Kingdom to make sweeping illogical concessions to 
Israel in the peace talks. 
  His Majesty King Husayn reaffirmed this week Jordan's stand 
that the Kingdom's participation in the peace porcess was 
contingent on an end to the siege of Aqaba. He said that while 
Jordan remained committed to a negotiated peace in the Middle 
East, the Kingdom refused to be targetted for pressure and 
mistrust and "humiliated as a people" and still be expected to 
play a positive role in the peace process. 
  The King also said there were "positive" signs that the 
problem was being addressed. Diplomats here believe that U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is reportedly 
expected in the Middle East in the last week of April, might 
bring with him an American answer to a proposal to replace the 
sea-based inspections with on- shore checks at al-'Aqabah by a 
neutral, international agency such as Lloyds Register of London. 
  Reporting on the latest interception, shipping officials 
said 
Monday that the Ikan-Seleyang [name as published], which is 
carrying 4,000 tonnes of paper cargo for Jordan, was intercepted 
Sunday evening by the naval force patrolling the Red Sea. 
  The vessel was boarded and inspected after an overnight wait 
at the Tiran Straits at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba and the 
inspectors ruled that they did not have accessibility to inspect 
not only the Jordan-bound cargo but also others stowed in the 
ship's holds, the officials said. 
  The Ikan Selayang was waiting at the straits as of Monday 
evening while the ship's agents and other concerned parties were 
in touch with the Bahrain headquarters of the U.S. Central 
Command, which is directly in charge of inspecting all 
al-'Aqabah-bound vessels, they said. 
  If the efforts did not succeed to have the ship proceed to 
al-'Aqabah, then it would head for Dubai, where the Jordan bound 
cargo would be unloaded, they said. This would mean another 
ship picking up the cargo from Dubai and ferrying it to 
al-'Aqabah, leading to a full sea-freight to be paid by the 
importers. 
  In turn, the importers will reflect their extra cost on the 
actual market prices of the product, and the consumer will end 
up paying the price for the inspection, the shipping officials 
noted. 
  The Ikan Selayang was the 13th ship to be blocked by the 
U.S.-led inspectors this year, compared with a total of 20 
during 1993. More than 1,700 ships were closely inspected among 
20,000 hailed over the radio and over 8,500 actually boarded, 
but until now no vessel was found to be carrying any 
"contraband" cargo headed for al-'Aqabah in violation of the 
sanctions against Iraq. 
  A ship carrying bagged detergents for Jordan was turned away 
on April 8 by the inspectors. The vessel had to proceed to 
another Red Sea port to rearrange cargo for inspections. It was 
allowed to proceed, and it docked at al-'Aqabah on Sunday, a 
10-day delay resulting in tens of thousands of dollars in losses. 
  "The situation is getting out of hand," said Sufyan 
Muhaysin, 
manager of the Jordan Shipping Agents Association. "Don't think 
the country can take it anymore. The losses are mounting and 
importers are turning away from using al-'Aqabah as much as 
possible in order to avoid the high freight costs." 
  Shipowners apply extra charges of $1,000 per 40-ft. 
container 
and $500 per 20-ft. container and $15 to 20 per tonne of loose 
cargo bound for al-'Aqabah to offset their losses resulting from 
the delays and diversions to other ports. The cost of 
transshipment has to be borne by the importer if the ship was 
forced to offload Jordan-bound cargo at other ports. 
  Mr. Muhaysin said: "We hope Secretary Christopher would 
bring with him a solution to the problem. Otherwise, the 
situation is going to be worse." 
  Following King Husayn's March 28 notice to the five 
permanent 
members of the U.N. Security Council that Jordan was suspending 
participation in the peace process, the various U.S. departments 
involved in policy-making and enforcement were to have met on 
the proposal to move the inpections to the port of al-'Aqabah 
and to authorise Lloyds Register to conduct the inspections. 
  No details have emerged on how Washington was responding to 
the proposal.

  [Excerpt] Amman--The U.S.-led naval force patrolling the 
Red Sea has denied entry to another al-'Aqabah-bound vessel on 
grounds that it was carrying "unauthorised" spare parts for 
Iraq, shipping officials said Tuesday [19 April]. 
  They said the Polish-flag Moniufzko, which had among its 
Jordan-bound cargo 30 tonnes of spare parts for tractors 
imported by the Iraqi government, headed for Port Suez to unload 
the consignment. 
  "The inspectors ruled that the U.N. approval for the spare 
parts dated back to November 1993, and as such it was no longer 
valid," said one of the officials. 
  The parameters that the inspectors apply to determine the 
validity of U.N. approvals were not immediately known. But, 
according to U.N. diplomats, there is little coordination if any 
at all between the inspectors and the U.N. Sanctions Committee. 
  U.N. Security Copuncil Resolution 687 of April 1991 exempts 
food and medicine as well as items related to food and medicine 
from the sanctions the world body imposed on Iraq in August 1990 
following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
  As such, spare parts for tractors are exempt since they are 
used in the agriculture sector to produce food. Exemption 
certificates are issued by the Sanctions Committee, which 
comprises 15 members of the Security Council itself. 
  The absence of coordination between the inspectors and the 
sanctions committee became apparent in several instances when 
the inspectors rejected the committee's certification saying 
they were forgeries. 
  The authenticity of the documents was established in all 
cases, but not before ships carrying cargo covered by them were 
turned away from al-'Aqabah, leading to severe losses to 
importers. 
  The Moniufzko, which is carrying nearly 500 tonnes of 
general 
cargo, most of it in 30 full containers, would return to 
al-'Aqabah after the "suspect" cargo is off-loaded at Port Suez, 
the officials said. 
  The Moniufzko, operated by a Chinese-Polish joint venture, 
was the 14th ship to be intercepted and denied entry to 
al-'Aqabah this year by the enforcers of the sanctions against 
Iraq patrolling the Red Sea. In 1993, they turned away 20 
ships. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Siege on al-'Aqabah Intolerable; We will not </F>
Submit to Pressures"] 
  [Text] Since it has become very clear that the U.S. siege 
on Jordan is both a political and economic siege, it is now 
Jordan's right, as His Majesty King Husayn said in an interview 
with Japanese Television yesterday, to adopt a decisive and just 
stand on this siege. 
  Since the U.S. Administration is practicing such economic 
and 
trade pressures and harassments on Jordan to force it to sign a 
unilateral agreement along with a declaration of principles, to 
normalize relations, and to lift the boycott of Israel--things 
that are harder for Jordan to do than anything else--then Jordan 
will have to freeze or suspend its active role in the peace 
negotiations. 
  The U.S. demands, which, in principle, are Israeli demands, 
totally contradict the constants of the principled Jordanian 
stand. 
  Jordan will not relinquish the constants of its principled 
stand, which, as His Majesty King Husayn said, is represented by 
seeking to realize a future in which a just and comprehensive 
peace prevails and in which the coming generations can exist 
under security, peace, and stability. 
  Jordan is committed to achieving a comprehensive solution on 
all tracks. It will not accept a unilateral agreement with 
Israel. 
  Jordan will not agree to sign a declaration of principles 
before finding solutions to the issues of borders, waters, 
refugees, and evacuees, as well as the issue of holy Jerusalem. 
  In his television interview, his majesty warned that issues 
concerning the siege of al-'Aqabah have reached an intolerable 
situation--one which we are trying to rectify. We are also 
trying to show the world that if this situation constitutes 
pressure, then we will not submit to such pressures. 
  Moreover, Jordan believes that the Arab League alone can 
discuss the issue of lifting the boycott of Israel, which is 
seeking normalization. 
  Since Jordan is committed to Arab League resolutions, it 
cannot respond to the demands of the U.S. Administration. 
Jordan will not accept to split the unified Arab position or 
parting from it even if this is to appease the U.S. 
Administration. 
  Jordan is beginning to interpret the unjust siege imposed on 
it as a hostile and vindictive measure that is totally 
unjustified. 
  However, Jordan, as the U.S. Administration itself knows and 
as His Majesty King Husayn said, will not submit to such 
pressures no matter how harsh they are. Moreover, Jordan will 
not at all accept blackmail. 
  Therefore, it linked the continuation of its active, 
effective, and influential role in the peace process to lifting 
the unjust siege on the Port of al-'Aqabah, removing the harm 
caused to its economy and trade, and stopping the serious losses 
it is suffering. 
  This Jordanian stand has many political meanings and 
dimensions which the U.S. Administration realizes before anyone 
else. This is especially so since Jordan, as the Austrian 
president said, is a basic pillar of the peace process. The 
collapse of this pillar will inevitably lead to the total 
collapse of the U.S.-initiated peace process.

<F P=106> [By Shihadah Abu-Baqar] </F>
  [Excerpt] Amman, PETRA--Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali has stated that Jordan's rejection of a unilateral 
peace deal is not the outcome of a state of weakness. Rather, 
it is the outcome of faith and strong Jordanian convictions that 
a unilateral deal cannot produce a durable peace. Worse still, 
a unilateral peace deal poses more danger than a state of no 
peace at all. 
  The prime minister added: Hence the firm Jordanian position 
and determination that the solution must be comprehensive, just, 
and durable. Besides, the solution must enjoy the support of 
all concerned Arab sides. 
  During a meeting with representatives of publications issued 
by political parties, Dr. al-Majali went on to say: The only 
viable and sustainable option is the peaceful solution that we 
are striving to achieve. Any other solution would remain 
vulnerable and pose greater threats. He indicated that Jordan 
has long been opposed to unilateral deals. That is why it has 
come under various kinds of pressure to make it abandon its 
principled stand toward the issue. 
  In this regard, the prime minister reaffirmed that Jordan's 
steadfastness in the face of pressures and its firm positions in 
this regard have earned it the respect of all, although its 
position might not necessarily be in the interest of all parties. 
  Answering a question on the successive Israeli Government 
attempts to export its crises; that is, on whether there is a 
link between the Israeli attempts to brand Jordan as a terrorist 
state and the blockade enforced against the Port of al-'Aqabah, 
the prime minister said: First, we would like to say that 
Israel's attempts to export its crises are unacceptable. 
However, as is well known, many world parties pursue this 
approach. But the important question in this regard is the 
following: Should we succumb to the Israelis' wishes regarding 
resolving their crises at our expense? 
  The prime minister answered this question, saying: We are 
completely opposed to this. This may be connected to the 
blockade enforced against al-'Aqabah, particularly if one is to 
relate interconnected developments. In general, Israel has 
nothing to do with the blockade enforced against al-'Aqabah. 
However, a connection might be found between the two if one is 
to employ a long-term perspective. 
  In the course of his answers to the questions posed by 
reporters, the prime minister noted that the al-'Aqabah siege is 
part of the Gulf war. The Gulf war elicited the blockade. This 
is how we see things at present. We have withstood the blockade 
enforced against al-'Aqabah for the past three years. If we are 
to make an estimate of the losses we have sustained as a result 
of this, we would say that this blockade has cost us almost $1.2 
billion, a large amount in Jordanian market calculations. It is 
not a trivial matter that can be underrated. 
  The prime minister added: For our part, we have continued 
our efforts to explain this state of affairs through our 
contacts with various world states, such as Britain, France, and 
other states. Our purpose in this regard has been to explain the 
dangers that could be created by this state of affairs. In this 
regard, we have also held intensive contacts with the U.S. 
Administration and the UN Security Council's Sanctions 
Committee. We explained to them the magnitude of our sufferings 
under the blockade. We hope to reach a solution to this problem 
soon. 
  In reply to a question on the progress made in these 
contacts, Dr. al-Majali said: It is widely known that ship 
inspections are currently conducted in high seas. The 
inspection process has something to do with numerous procedures 
regarding the storage of commodities inside ships. Because of 
the complications entailed in this, we have lost 24 shipping 
lines. Thanks to the contacts I have just noted, we have 
received an offer from Lloyds Register, a nonpolitical and 
non-profit international corporation, according to which its 
officials will be stationed in al-'Aqabah. When customs 
officials open cargo containers, Lloyds Register officials could 
examine the cargo to ensure that there are no violations of the 
sanctions. In other words, this would not be a full-blown 
inspection. Besides, such measures would not undermine national 
sovereignty. Of course, they [not further identified] sought to 
bring navy officers and personnel to the port to conduct the 
inspections there. This is unacceptable. We have read reports 
that the government abandoned sovereignty over al-'Aqabah. 
Indeed, this is a regrettable development, because we cannot 
accept anything of the sort. 
  Responding to a question on inter-Arab coordination, and 
whether there is a unified Arab position regarding the next 
phases of the peace process to be conveyed to the U.S. secretary 
of state during his upcoming tour of the region, the prime 
minister said: It is truly regrettable that the events and 
crises which should have made the Arabs more tolerant and more 
cohesive have failed to do so. We feel that the Arab negotiator 
would have been in much a better position had the Arab stands 
been concerted and united. 
  Dr. al-Majali said: Jordan's position is constant. During 
the past and current crisis, Jordan's stand has remained the 
same. This stand will not be changed by any future crises. We 
absolutely believe in the importance of a comprehensive solution 
and of coordination. We work toward that end. But if 
coordination is not realized, this will not be our fault. We 
always offer coordination with our brothers--Palestinians, 
Syrians, Lebanese, and other Arab brothers. Our objective is to 
end the estrangement so that the Arabs have a stronger 
negotiating position and so that we can attain our rights. We 
constantly offer coordination, but we do not have the strength 
or might which would enable us to lead others in this direction. 
  In response to a question on his assessment of 
Jordanian-Palestinian relations, Dr. al-Majali said: Certainly, 
those relations are special, both morally and practically. But 
it is known that the other side has various factions with 
various political orientations. Naturally, our relations should 
be with a specific side. It is unreasonable that relations be 
established with various and different sides. Therefore, we 
have decided that our relations will be with the PLO, which is 
recognized by the Palestinian and Arab people and most world 
states. We exclusively deal with the PLO [among other 
Palestinian factions], exactly as we deal with any other 
sisterly Arab state. 
  The prime minister said: We support the PLO in whatever 
would make it capable of fully restoring its rights. Therefore, 
we hope that the political organization will enter the 
Palestinian territory and that a Palestinian entity will be 
established over the Palestinian territory. We hope that the 
Palestinian people will attain their right to 
self-determination, so that they will be able to decide on 
whatever type of relationship that they would like to have with 
us. Even in the name of patriotism, it is unacceptable that any 
formula for any future relationship be imposed on the 
Palestinian people while they are still under occupation. Just 
like us, they must be given the chance so that we together can 
decide on the formula of this relationship. This is especially 
true since past Arab unity experiences have ended in failure 
because they were imposed from above and were isolated from the 
grassroots. 
  The prime minister continued: Here in Jordan, we are 
sincerely open toward any kind of relationship with the 
Palestinian brothers and other Arab brothers in general. We are 
open to any kind of relationship. We also always seek to have 
strong relations with our brothers. Therefore, we believe that 
under the current circumstances, it is in the interest of the 
brother Palestinians and the Arab-Israeli negotiations in 
general that the Arabs raise the level of coordination among 
them. Otherwise, the future will be more serious than the past. 
  In this vein, Dr. al-Majali said: Apathy, disagreement, and 
disunity mean that the Arab nation will eventually find itself 
in a situation imposed upon it by others. On the other hand, 
accord, concerted stands, and closed ranks are the real 
guarantor of the Arab nation's interests. They provide the 
means with which the dangers of the designs that are being 
concocted against the Arab nation and its coming generations can 
be thwarted. 
  Regarding the issue of Jerusalem within the framework of 
the peace process, Dr. al-Majali said: The brothers in the PLO 
agreed to discuss the issue of Jerusalem in the second phase. I 
believe that Jerusalem is the major problem and, given the 
current state of Arab fragmentation, the results would not 
satisfy people. Hence, I sincerely call for abandoning these 
differences at the present stage because there can be no peace 
without Jerusalem. Arab reconciliation and unity of ranks are 
needed now. 
  Answering a question on the PLO's representation of the 
Palestinian people, the prime minister said: The PLO is 30 
years old now. All Palestinians -- opposition and others -- now 
agree that the PLO represents the Palestinian persona; it is 
like any other government. The Palestinian issue is a major one 
and the Palestinian people exist inside and outside the occupied 
territory. Since it is difficult to hold elections so as to 
elect a Palestinian leadership, it would be in the general 
interest of the Palestinians to postpone differences. Following 
the establishment of a Palestinian entity the Palestinian 
brothers will be able to elect whoever they want. 
  Answering a question on the recent events aimed at 
undermining Jordan's stability and the sides that stand behind 
them, the prime minister said: External sides gave instructions 
or tried to convince certain people that the situation in Jordan 
is not right and that religious duty calls for changing this 
situation. 
  Dr. al-Majali said: Some of those who tried to carry out 
acts that are detrimental to the country's security were trained 
abroad to use arms. Some others are naive people, because the 
person who blows himself up while trying to plant a bomb 
somewhere is a naive person. He said: Those people exploited 
the fact that many sides want to see instability in Jordan for 
many purposes. 
  Asked why the views of the opposition are not highlighted in 
the official media, the prime minister said: The Jordanian 
Government takes into consideration both views. The government 
has its official media and you have your media, and I do not 
believe we intervene in your affairs. 
  To reiterate the government's faith and endeavors to 
highlight conflicting views, the prime minister said that the 
government is determined to work continuously to listen to other 
opinions and even to open the official radio to it. [passage

<F P=106> [Interview with Tahir al-Masri, speaker of the Jordanian </F>
House of Representatives, by Radio Monte Carlo correspondent 
Randah Habib in Amman, date not given; from the weekly "The 
Event" program] 
  [Text] [Habib] Jordan's resumption of its role in the peace 
process hinges on tackling the problem of the embargo clamped on 
al-'Aqabah Port. Why is there this connection, and do you 
believe this is justified? 
  [Al-Masri] Certainly, the Jordanian measure is justified, 
and 
maybe it should have been adopted before this time. This is 
because the losses inflicted on Jordan and the Jordanian economy 
are intolerable. Imposing such an embargo on al-'Aqabah is also 
unjustified. We do not believe such harassment at the Tiran 
Straits and the Port of al-'Aqabah is related only to the 
implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions against 
Iraq. We believe such an issue has other dimensions that might 
be related to the entire peace process. For some time now, 
since right after the end of the Gulf war, we have tried to 
reach an understanding with the U.S. Administration, and other 
concerned governments, about this issue. Jordan was very 
patient, but nothing was achieved. A certain measure had to be 
taken. This measure was the safest, the best, and the most 
logical, namely, to link our resumption of the peace 
negotiations with a solution to this issue. 
  [Habib] Does this mean that if Washington does not respond 
positively to this Jordanian condition, Jordan will withdraw 
completely from the peace talks, as the House of Representatives 
requested? 
  [Al-Masri] Jordan's policy toward peace is still a strategic 
one. I believe the al-'Aqabah issue will be resolved. I 
believe there is now a clear understanding of Jordan's position 
and the reasons behind Jordan's complaints. There are clear and 
strong signs, not only from Washington, but also from several 
Western capitals and from the UN Security Council, indicating 
that such an issue will be resolved soon. Resolving this issue 
will reflect positively on Jordan's stand toward the peace 
process. The peace process is a comprehensive process that is 
related to the entire region, not only to Jordan. I believe all 
the parties, the Arab and the international parties, understand 
the meaning and importance of peace, and the importance of the 
success of the peace talks, and consequently, of resolving the 
problems of the region and Jordan. 
  [Habib] At the outset of talk about the siege on al-'Aqabah, 
you spoke about pressure. Do you believe that through this, the 
United States seeks to drag Jordan into signing a peace treaty 
with Israel? 
  [Al-Masri] It is no secret that the United States, and 
Israel 
as well, wish Arab states would sign treaties or separate 
agreements. It is also not a secret that they would like Jordan 
to be one of the first states to make such a separate step. 
Over the past few weeks, the world listened to His Majesty King 
Husayn's statements in which he clarified Jordan's stand and 
said Jordan cannot conclude a separate deal, and that it does 
not agree to do so. Neither can it accept partial solutions, 
because this will neither be a just nor a comprehensive 
solution. Such ideas were put forth by some U.S. Administration 
officials. However, Jordan's stand is clear. I think it will 
not change. 
  [Habib] In your opinion, what are the alternatives which 
guarantee the implementation of the international embargo 
clamped on Iraq, without making Jordan pay for this embargo? 
  [Al-Masri] We, as Jordan, are not concerned about finding 
alternatives to the UN Security Council's, the international 
community's, or to any other side's embargo on Iraq. We are 
only concerned about the implementation of what is related to 
us. Regarding other things, let others find alternatives and 
solutions to them. At any rate, we comply with this embargo 
satisfactorily. However, the harassments of al-'Aqabah-bound 
ships do not just affect goods for Iraq, although they are 
legitimate goods and get the approval of the Sanctions Committee 
in advance, but also affect Jordanian commodities. There is 
proof and there are statistics that explain that the volume of 
Jordan's imports has not changed a great deal, particularly 
concerning banned imports to Iraq. Jordan's imports have not 
changed, the figures have not changed from what they were before 
the Gulf war. Consequently, it is clear that Jordan's trade 
with Iraq is not as big as those who impose the embargo on 
Jordan claim. 
  [Habib] What is the volume of the losses as a result of the 
embargo? 
  [Al-Masri] Hundreds of millions. I believe these losses 
reached some $2 billion that were primarily sustained by the 
Jordanian consumer. 
  [Habib] King Husayn has said, on behalf of Jordan, that none 
of the parties involved has proved it is up to the 
responsibility of facing the challenges of peace. Amman is 
also interested in this peace operation. To what extent can 
Jordan be held responsible for delaying the attainment of 
definitive agreements with Israel? 
  [Al-Masri] Jordan is one of the parties involved in the 
Arab- 
Israeli conflict. It is true that Jordan has a unique position 
and special leverage regarding the issue and the operation of 
settling the conflict. But, Jordan is only one of the parties 
involved. Therefore, every party should assume its 
responsibilities. As I have said, we believe in a just peace. 
We want to attain peace that recognizes rights, that safeguards 
Palestinian rights, and that will settle all the disagreements 
and the issues between the Arabs and Israel. When such 
disagreements and issues are settled, then Jordan and the other 
Arab parties will become ready to achieve the aspired objective 
of peace. However, it is impermissible to blame Jordan for 
obstructing this. If we want to achieve a just peace, it should 
be a comprehensive peace. Approaching one of the parties and 
bringing pressure to bear on it to attain a separate peace will 
not achieve the aspired goal and will not realize the strategy 
of peace, a peace that should be stable, just, and lasting. 
  [Habib] The 13 April deadline has passed and the Israeli 
Army 
remains in Gaza and Jericho. Palestinian-Israeli negotiations 
foundered. What does Jordan have to say about this? 
  [Al-Masri] Regrettably, the agreements that are being 
reached 
do not hold. Such agreements should be reached after more 
serious and careful study. The Arab-Israeli conflict and the 
settlement of the Palestinian cause on the Palestinian track 
cannot take place through general agreements and on large 
talking points. The agreement should proceed from the base 
upward. This means that understandings in advance should be 
reached on all the issues and disagreements, so the two parties 
will ultimately reach an agreement they will publicize. The 
opposite took place. Agreement was reached on major talking 
points and the agreement on details was left for later. The 
agreement foundered and we reached the present state of affairs. 
I believe that agreements should be respected, and the question 
of the 13 April deadline should have been met. Any delay, 
uncalled for obstacle, or procrastination will affect, and has 
actually affected, the credibility of peace and the possibility 
of moving further toward the other fronts and toward settling 
broader problems. 
  [Habib] Then is this what Jordan avoids by refusing to sign 
a peace treaty with Israel, that is, not to be in the same 
situation? 
  [Al-Masri] Yes, we said that we should agree on all points 
of 
disagreements in accordance with all issues and talking points 
so that we will eventually reach a general agreement that all 
parties speak about. 
  [Habib] What is your position on the violence and 
counterviolence that swept the occupied territories and Israel? 
What do these actions mean? What is their influence on the 
peace process? 
  [Al-Masri] What is taking place in the occupied territories 
is not unexpected. It is impossible to assume that security 
and political settlements will coexist inside and around Arab 
population centers on usurped Arab territories -- not just 
occupied, but usurped and confiscated. We cannot expect the 
situation to continue normally, especially since the citizens 
there see that there are negotiations that do not lead to a 
substantial result. The presence of settlers inside and around 
Arab population centers will surely lead to violence from both 
sides, because the settlers are ideological settlers who believe 
that the land on which they build settlements is theirs, that it 
is the land of greater Israel, which they want to maintain. On 
the other hand, the Palestinians and the Arabs do not accept 
this logic, and they have to reject it. If a citizen has the 
means to defend--whether it is a peaceful or armed means--he 
will use it. This is what is going on in the occupied 
territories. I think this will not stop with the Hebron 
massacre or the bombs and booby-trapped cars. It will continue 
until this situation is corrected, and until there is an 
Israeli recognition that the occupied territories are really 
occupied, without the presence of Israeli enclaves or disguised 
Israeli sovereignty there. Until then, I think violence will 
continue from both parties. 
  As for the influence of this situation on the peace process, 
it has an impact and may obstruct the peace process and place it 
in trouble. It may prolong the process and prolong the pain 
before reaching any understanding--if we can say that the whole 
process will lead to an agreement and understanding. 
  [Habib] What are the alternatives to the peace process? 
  [Al-Masri] The alternatives are frightening and dangerous. 
The only alternative is the escalation of violence, pain, and 
instability in this region at a time when the world and all its 
regions are moving toward, and are concentrating on boosting, 
economic development, and entrenching security and social 
stability. In this case, this region, and probably Africa, will 
be the only explosive regions in this world. 
  [Habib] U.S. assistance to Israel and Egypt remain as they 
are, but the Jordanian share is being reduced. It was announced 
in Washington that only $7 million will be given to Amman. How 
do you interpret the U.S. position? 
  [Al-Masri] I don't think that the subject of 
assistance--whether economic, technical, or even military--is 
important to me or to Jordan. Probably, U.S. assistance in the 
past had some importance, but now I don't think it has any 
importance. Therefore, $7 million, or more, or less, will not 
affect the political line and will not give any lesson or sign. 
Even if this assistance is canceled altogether, it will 
probably be better. 
  [Habib] Don't you say that this meager assistance is one of 
the U.S. ways to pressure Jordan? 
  [Al-Masri] Seven million, even if you double it several 
times, will not affect the Jordanian economy or the course of 
Jordanian policy. Therefore, I don't want to consider this 
measure to be of importance to Jordan. I want to fully ignore 
it.

  [Text] Jordan's chief delegate to Middle East multilateral 
peace talks on water sharing has said Jordan participated in the 
fifth round in Oman as an observer. 
  Dr. Mundhir Haddadin said Jordan's low-key participation was 
to protest the failure of American naval forces to lift the 
blockade of the Port of al-'Aqabah. 
  He said His Majesty King Husayn had made it clear that 
Jordan's participation in the fifth round of water talks would 
be at the observer level if inspections of Jordan-bound ships 
continued. 
  Dr. Haddadin said Jordan would also scale down its 
delegations to other multilateral talks if the blockade on 
al-'Aqabah persisted. He said the fifth round of talks on 
disarmament and regional security would be held in Qatar early 
next month, and talks on refugees and economic development would 
convene in Egypt and Morocco respectively. 
  Forty countries, including Israel, are attending the Oman 
round and Jordan is represented by the adviser to the minister 
of water and irrigation. 
  In the previous four sessions at the water conference, 
Jordan 
had participated with a six-member delegation.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Jordan's Boycott of Negotiations Achieves </F>
Objectives"] 
  [Text] Jordan's absence from the work of the multilateral 
negotiations committees naturally affects the performance of 
these committees and the feasibility of issues under discussion. 
  Any talk about regional cooperation in any field in the 
post-peace phase will be meaningless without Jordan's 
participation for reasons connected with Jordan's position with 
all the meaning that this word implies, be it geographic, 
political, or historical. 
  Therefore, Jordan's stand to boycott the multilateral 
negotiations, on whose results the features of the post-peace 
phase will be drawn up, has started to make its effect felt and 
to drive home the message that methods of pressure and blockade 
on this country to facilitate the negotiating process will be of 
no avail. 
  It is certain that by sending only an observer to the Muscat 
multilaterals, and hinting that the same thing will be done in 
the upcoming negotiations in Doha, Cairo, and Rabat as long as 
the blockade continues on al-'Aqabah Port and the pressure is 
maintained, Jordan is demanding that those who say they want to 
establish a lasting peace and a broad regional cooperation in 
the Middle East reconsider their stands in light of the 
Jordanian position which links a positive Jordanian role in the 
negotiations with fair dealings and justice for both Jordan as 
well as the Palestinian and Arab peoples who came under 
aggression and injustice. 
  It is hoped that U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's 
expected visit to Jordan during his upcoming tour of the region 
will carry with it a change in the U.S. stand on the blockade 
imposed on Jordan's lone maritime lifeline. The United State is 
aware of the extent of Jordan's commitment to its 
responsibilities toward international resolutions and its 
concern to promote the march of regional cooperation and peace 
provided that this is done without any encroachment on its 
national dignity, pan-Arab commitments, and its belief which was 
reiterated on all occasions; namely, that genuine peace is one 
based on justice, that it should be acceptable to people who 
will coexist with and defend it to pursue the interests of their 
future generations and draw benefits from it. 
  Based on such a premise, blockades and pressures will not 
lead to such peace but will make the possibility of realizing it 
remote and will prolong the suffering and pain in which the 
peoples of the region have been living for decades.

  [Text] Amman--Police have arrested the leader and a member 
of a group affiliated with the so-called Arab Afghans after a 
chase and gunfight in Amman, security sources said Saturday [16 
April]. 
  They confirmed a report in the local press that a 
38-year-old 
man identified as the head of the group described as religious 
extremists who sought to undermine national security and a 
member of the faction were detained on Thursday. 
  The sources identified the leader by his initials as W.I. 
and 
said his arrest was a major breakthough in investigations into a 
series of sabotage and attempted sabotage in the country over 
the past few months. 
  A car used by the two was intercepted after a chase and 
gunfight during which a policeman was wounded in the leg, the 
report said. The vehicle yielded an assortment of weapons, it 
said. Investigations were continuing. 
  Friday's arrests raised the number of suspects detained in 
connection with extremist plots in the past few months to 35. 
Twenty-three of them were earlier expected to be put on trial in 
mid-April charged with plotting and carrying out subversion 
through bombings at public places. 
  But, with the new arrests, it is expected all the 35 could 
be 
put on trial together as a single group, the sources said. 
  Most of the suspects have confessed and reenacted the crimes 
and attempted crimes in the presence of prosecutors, security 
official said. 
  The trial was expected to start in mid-April, but 
investigations and gathering of evidence are continuing. "It 
might take some weeks before the cases are sent to court," said 
one source. 
  Details of the charges faced by others and the time of their 
arrests remained sketchy, but the sources affirmed that there 
was enough evidence to prove that most of them had plotted to 
destabilise security and create chaos in the country. 
  It was also not clear whether all the suspects were linked 
with each other. The sources said there appeared to be two or 
three small groups operating independent of each other, possibly 
under orders from a single faction or individual. 
  However, one of the threads that bound all was their 
background as "Arab Afghans"--volunteers who fought with the 
Afghan Mujahedeen against the Soviet occupation of 
Afghanistan--of affiliation with them, according to the sources. 
  Apart from the 23 who are expected to go on trial soon, at 
least 10 others are reported to be members of a shadowy 
organisation calling itself "Jihad Islami Organisation," whose 
leader was arrested on Friday. 
  The group's members had carried out several hold-ups of taxi 
drivers and other places and were planning to rob banks to raise 
funds to buy arms before they were arrested, reports said. 
  Parliament members representing the Islamic Action Front 
(IAF) met with Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali last week 
with an appeal for the release of some of the detainees, whose 
number they put at 73. 
  According to the sources, some of those who fought in 
Afghanistan were detained for interrogation immediately upon 
their return home over the past months. It was not immediately 
clear whether prosecutors had been able to establish any link 
between them and those who were arrested in connection with the 
bombings and attempted attacks in Jordan. 
  IAF officials stressed that they were not intervening on 
behalf of any of those who were found to have been involved in 
subversion, but that many of the detainees were innocent of any 
crime and therefore should be released. 
  Most of the "Arab Afghans" are believed to be ex-members of 
the Muslim Brotherhood who broke away in protest against the 
moderate policies followed by the leadership, experts on 
Jordanian Islamic movements say. 
  "Although they are no longer active members, the Brotherhood 
has no choice but to intervene on their behalf to protect its 
own image with the ranks and file," said an expert and long-time 
observer of the movement. 
  Senior Brotherhood leaders have dismissed as baseless report 
in Europe-based Arabic-language magazines that some of the 
suspects were directly linked to the movement. The Brotherhood 
might even file lawsuits against those magazines for defamation, 
the leaders said.

  [Excerpt] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Well-informed 
security sources in Amman said yesterday that a clash had taken 
place between a Jordanian security patrol and two gunmen 
belonging to the "Afghans" organization. It resulted in their 
arrest and the confiscation of quantities of arms. 
  The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the clash took place 
a few days ago and that a member of the patrol was wounded. It 
was discovered that the two detained men belong to the group of 
10 arrested last week on charges of forming a banned 
organization and planning to carry out terrorist actions inside 
Jordan. The sources said that the clash took place in a suburb 
west of the Jordanian capital, Amman, in Mahalah called Wadi 
al-Sir. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "Arrest of `Brotherhood' Leading </F>
Figures Linked to `Jordanian Afghan' Groups"] 
  [Text] Jordanian security sources yesterday confirmed that 
there were links between the "Jordanian Afghan" groups recently 
arrested in connection with explosions in the Kingdom, and the 
Muslim Brotherhood which is officially active within the 
framework of the Islamic Action Front. 
  The sources told AL-HAYAH that the security authorities 
arrested two leading Muslim Brotherhood figures on suspicion of 
links with the "Jordanian Afghans" groups and seized a quantity 
of arms and explosives in their possession. 
  They said that among those arrested and interrogated were 
'Abd-al-Majid Diyah, who was released on bail, and 'Abdallah 
al-Hashayikah, a leading Muslim Brotherhood figure suspected of 
links with an Afghan group. 
  The same sources said that the security authorities also 
arrested 'Abd-al-Majid al-Majali on suspicion of belonging to an 
Afghan organization after the discovery of explosives at a 
children's nursery run by the Muslim Brotherhood in al-Karak. 
They added that the nursery, which is attached to the city's 
Islamic Center, is managed by Muslim Brotherhood member 'Imad 
al-Sawalimah, who was also arrested. 
  The security sources stressed that "all the arrests, without 
exception, were made on the orders of the attorney general after 
the seizure of large quantities of arms and explosives." They 
added that the number of people detained in connection with the 
explosions in two movie theaters in Amman and al-Zarqa' as well 
as incidents of burglary and planting of devices discovered 
before exploding, has reached 70. Those against whom evidence 
is unearthed will be referred to trial. 
  According to government sources, some of the detainees have 
links with foreign Islamic organizations whose aim is to 
undermine Jordan's security and stability through explosions and 
theassassination of Jordanian figures. Asked about the reasons 
for the arrest of members of Fatah--the Revolutionary Council 
[FRC], they said that members of Abu-Nidal's organization in 
Jordan were arrested after the Lebanese judiciary authorities 
obtained evidence of the organization's complicity in the 
assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah on 28 
January in Beirut, and on the basis of that evidence "the 
organization is now considered a terrorist organization." They 
added that "members who, in the view of the attorney general, 
had close links with the organization were placed under 
precautionary restrictions and the rest were released." 
  The Islamic Action Front issued a statement the day before 
yesterday criticizing the security authorities and accusing them 
of "practices and violations which are worrying to the Jordanian 
public and which have revived the specter of martial law in the 
guise of democracy."

Jordanian Parties Invite Iraqi Ba'th Party To Send Delegation 
From Its Leadership To Visit Amman"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Well-informed sources 
announced yesterday that Jordanian parties have invited the 
Iraqi Ba'th Party Regional Command [BPRC] to visit Jordan at the 
nearest opportunity to hold party, political, and mass dialogues 
and rallies in Jordan. 
  The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Islamic Action 
Front [IAF] party, the Pan-Arab Action Front [PAAF] party, and 
the Jordanian Arab Socialist Ba'th Party [ASBP] handed the 
invitation to Iraqi Ambassador to Jordan Nuri al-Wayyis. 
  The sources confirm that a meeting was held at the Iraqi 
Embassy in Amman last week between the Iraqi ambassador and 
representatives of the three parties. The Iraqi ambassador 
expressed during the meeting his wish that the parties' 
representatives make a gesture and invite the Iraqi BPRC to 
visit Jordan. 
  In the light of that, the Iraqi Ba'th Party is expected to 
accept the invitation. The three parties express clear sympathy 
with Iraq's political stances. The Iraqi Embassy has been eager 
to develop cooperation between these parties and the leadership 
of the Ba'th Party in Iraq. 
  The IAF party and the PAAF party announced in the past the 
establishment of a joint coordination command between them, and 
they now take unified political and party positions on all 
issues raised. The Jordanian ASBP joined them later.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The No's of King Husayn"] </F>
  [Text] For the first time since the Zionist usurpation of 
Jerusalem--the jewel of Arab and Islamic cities--in 1967, Amman 
and Jerusalem yesterday met in a wonderful spiritual meeting 
under the auspices of His Majesty King Husayn, descendant of the 
Hashemites, who has great spiritual and historic memories in his 
heart and mind of the holy city, following the steps of the 
Hashemite family. 
  Yesterday's awe-inspiring historic celebration in Amman and 
Jerusalem on the occasion of completing the third 
Hashemite-sponsored renovation of al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of 
the Rock was an occasion for the Arabs and Muslims to 
contemplate the difficult situation our nation is facing. This 
situation calls on everybody to reconsider the current 
deterioration in relations and seek to restore solidarity and 
reconciliation with the conscience, the mind, and the soul. 
  His Majesty King Husayn's call during the pan-Arab speech he 
delivered on this blessed historic occasion was amazing. He 
called on the nation to rise up to save Jerusalem and stand 
against every siege, oppression, and alienation. 
  Within earshot of all Arabs and Muslims, leader King Husayn 
uttered three no's which sum up the reality of the nation's will 
and reflect the feelings, sentiments, and aspirations of the 
masses in every Arab and Islamic nation. No to any solution 
that does not restore Arab sovereignty over Arab Jerusalem. No 
to any solution that does not secure the historic and legitimate 
rights of the people of Palestine on their chaste national soil. 
And no to any peace that is not acceptable to the future 
generations--a peace that they will not protect and defend. 
  It is no secret to the observer that the three no's His 
Majesty King Husayn uttered are constants of the Jordanian 
policy our country has been following in all its political 
activities since the Israeli occupation of our territories. 
  His Majesty King Husayn's donation to cover the expenses of 
the third Hashemite-sponsored renovation of al-Aqsa Mosque and 
the holy Dome of the Rock and his donation to rebuild the pulpit 
of Salah-al-Din al-Ayyubi stand witness to the great prestige 
the Holy City occupies in the heart and mind of his majesty the 
king and the Hashemite family. As King Husayn said yesterday, 
the Hashemite's association with Jerusalem "stands above the 
fray of political ploys and Earthly greed." Therefore, the 
leader made a new Hashemite pledge when he said: "We will keep 
our pledge and we will continue to defend the nation's rights in 
it so that it will return as an Arab and Islamic city in 
accordance with the international legitimacy."

  [Excerpt] In a wide-scale operation in the territories, 
security forces have rounded up hundreds of Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] activists and operatives. A number of 
weapons were also confiscated in the sweep, which took place 
last night. Alan Ben-'Ami reports: 
  [Begin Ben-'Ami recording] The authorities are being 
tight-lipped about exactly how many people have been arrested 
and who they are. But figures obtained from various sources, 
including Palestinians in the territories, indicate that as many 
as 400 or so people were detained in the round up. A terse 
statement by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] spokesman also said 
that weapons and ammunition were uncovered during the raids on 
towns, villages, and refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. 
  The massive crack-down is being viewed as a severe blow to 
Hamas and its operations, at least temporarily. But security 
sources point out that there are gunmen from the 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam gangs still at large, and they can be expected to 
mount attacks of one sort or another, despite this wide-spread 
move against Hamas members and operatives at various levels. 
Certainly, this is the biggest operation against Hamas in the 
territories since Israel deported more than 400 to Lebanon in 
December 1992. An international outcry resulted and all the 
deported being allowed to eventually return, and some of the 
were among the men picked up in this new crack-down. Most of the 
people arrested are said to be in their late teens or early 
twenties, and to include a number who were directly involved 
with planned terrorist attacks. 
  Hamas has openly boasted that its members were planning a 
total of five attacks against Israelis, with two more still to 
come, following the deadly bombs in 'Afula and Hadera and the ax 
attack on a bus in Jerusalem. Seven Israelis have died and more 
than 80 been injured in those attacks. A number of prominent 
Hamas personalities, including Taysir Tamimi and Jamal 
al-Natshah from Hebron, and Yasir Mansur from Nabulus are 
amongst those arrested. The big wave of arrests follows raids 
last week in which about 70 Hamas activists and operatives were 
picked up. Security sources say more arrests can be expected in 
the days ahead. [end recording] 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says the arrests of those 
responsible for acts of terrorism will continue. Rabin appeared 
today before the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, 
where he also said he supports a greater withdrawal from the 
Golan heights than that being recommended by the Army. David 
Ze'ev reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Ze'ev] As he left the Foreign Affairs 
and Defense Committee, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was asked 
about the arrests of Hamas activists. 
  [Rabin] Let us put it this way: We will fight those who 
continue terror with all the means that are available to us. 
The only limitation is the limitation of the law. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] The international observer contingent will deploy 
in Hebron within a week to 10 days, Jerusalem political circles 
said. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz has learned that 
Israel has received a draft of the observers' presence mandate, 
which defines their activities and addresses the questions of 
their immunity, freedom of movement, and reporting procedures. 
Israel finds the draft acceptable, and the sides are now 
awaiting the response of the PLO.

<F P=106> [Report by Ron Ben-Yishay] </F>
  [Text] IDF [Israel Defense Forces] commanders in the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho are exhibiting hesitant optimism. Even after 
the 'Afula car bomb and its bloody consequences and even after 
the stabbings at the Kissufim roadblock and the shooting at the 
Ashdod Junction, they still believe that reasonable safety can 
be guaranteed for Jews who will live inside and on the border of 
the Palestinian self-rule areas. 
  "The defense system we have devised creates a physical 
barrier between Jews and Arabs, reducing friction to the minimum 
and hindering terrorist attacks. Even suicide attackers will 
have to exert themselves to succeed," said people who will have 
to turn this pledge into reality. These people also believe 
that after a brief adjustment period, the Palestinian police 
force will perform well and will be able to enforce order. 
  As the evacuation clamor intensifies, there is more 
extensive 
coordination with the local chapter of Fatah and there is a 
feeling among the personnel involved that this model exercise 
(launched in preparation for autonomy throughout the 
territories) stands a good chance. It is not a matter of a mere 
gut feeling. The intelligence materiel, as well as the 
periodical talks with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
people, are grounds for the belief that the Islamic Movement 
will also join the arrangement eventually. 
  Moreover, local IDF commanders do not fear that 'Arafat's 
policemen/soldiers will be unable to exercise complete control 
over Hamas and the other rejectionist organizations. They 
believe that such a situation is quite likely during the first 
months after the evacuation, but claim that even if that 
happens, the safety of the Jewish settlements and residents on 
both sides of the Green Line can be safeguarded. The IDF and 
Israel Police redeployment and the security arrangements set 
down in the agreement with the Palestinians make that possible. 
Yet Israel will have to deploy more troops than planned around 
and inside the Strip and around Jericho and will have to bolster 
its intelligence setup. 
  The IDF is also prepared for the worst-case scenario in 
which 
'Arafat and his men either lose control or decide for some 
reason not to adhere to the agreement, for a scenario in which 
the Strip or the Jericho enclave become one big terrorist base. 
"Such an extreme development would mean that the agreement 
between us and the PLO has collapsed," a very senior officer 
says, "and if the agreement no longer exists, Israel will be 
free to act as its sees fit in the defense of the Jewish 
residents and settlements." In this context, "as it sees fit" 
does not necessarily mean the reoccupation of either the Strip 
or the Jericho enclave, although that, too, is possible. It 
means adjusting the measures and the intensity of the reaction 
to the situation in the field. 
  The agreement with the PLO (which has not been finalized and 
signed as yet) stipulates that three lateral roads from Israeli 
territory to the Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip will be 
controlled by the IDF -- not only the roads themselves but also 
several dozen meters (probably 30 meters on each side) on both 
sides of the roads. If the PLO police fail in preventing 
attacks against Israeli vehicles driving on these roads, Israel 
will consider itself free to expand the IDF-controlled territory 
on both sides of these roads to a point from which terrorists 
will be unable to harass people using the roads. Incidentally, 
joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols, under Israeli command, will 
move along these lateral roads, but the bulk of the security 
tasks will be assigned to IDF and Border Police patrols. 
  And another point: Although Gaza Strip residents will be 
allowed to travel to and from the West Bank, they will be 
confined to one or two roads, from which they will not be 
permitted to stray. 
  Another possibility was explored in simulation exercises 
held at the Southern Command before its recommendations on the 
arrangement with the Palestinians were submitted: How will the 
IDF react if Gaza terrorists acquire or improvise light mortars 
or katyushas and use them to fire at Israeli settlements from a 
distance? The proposed solution: Issue a warning and give the 
Palestinian police force a chance to tackle the problem by 
themselves. If 'Arafat's men are either unwilling or unable, 
the IDF (with the political echelons' approval) will not 
hesitate to send its own troops into the Palestinian self-rule 
territory and to take every necessary step. These troops will 
not have to remain there on a permanent basis. As in Lebanon, 
they will conduct their operation and leave the territory; stay 
for a short period and leave; or, in extreme cases, set up a 
permanent outpost. By the way, the undercover units in Gaza and 
in Judaea and Samaria will undergo changes, but the Duvdevan 
unit will continue to operate in Judaea and Samaria. 
  Almost every problem expected to arise during the 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement has a quite 
satisfactory military answer. The main problem is political: 
There is a danger that the experiment will fail for some 
reason, such as an inter-Palestinian bloodbath inside an area 
evacuated by Israel. There is hardly any doubt that in such an 
event, international public opinion will point an accusing 
finger at us, and we will be unable to do anything to stop the 
massacre. Or if Gaza or the Jericho enclave should become a 
terrorist hornet's nest, God forbid, and the IDF will have to 
reconquer the areas. In such an event, too, our statesmen will 
have to work overtime to counter criticism about Israel's having 
violated the agreement and fight demands for anti-Israel 
sanctions, which are certain to be raised at the United Nations. 
Hence, the Palestinian police force's failure is no less our 
problem than it is Chairman Abu-'Ammar's [Yasir 'Arafat]. 
  As already stated, the belief is that this force will 
eventually manage to become the sovereign force in the area. It 
is almost certain that should anything happen in Jericho or in 
the Gaza Strip, the PLO stands a good chance of more-or-less 
prevailing over Hamas and the other "refuseniks." The main 
problem the police force will face -- in the first months, at 
least -- will be the tension between the policemen from abroad 
and the veteran "intifadah fighters," who were part of the scene 
either in the area or in one Ansar or another throughout the 
years. And although they are on the same side, veteran Fatah 
men in the field will also find it difficult to accept an 
unfamiliar general from the Palestine Liberation Army [PLA], an 
army whose three brigades have yet to score an achievement. 
  And there is another problem. The PLA's police training is 
insufficient. It is unfamiliar with the terrain and has 
received no antiterror warfare training. It can be safely 
assumed that in the beginning, Hamas and Islamic Jihad 
youngsters will fool them quite easily. 'Arafat is aware of 
this problem and is therefore trying to man his police force 
with as many Fatah members as possible. The latter -- for 
example, members of the notorious Force 17 (responsible for the 
Nizzanim and Achille Lauro terrorist attacks) -- are better 
trained than the PLA troops. Yet an excessive number of Fatah 
representatives in the police force will create the impression 
that the force is not pan-Palestinian but rather a Fatah branch 
trying to promote -- under Israeli sponsorship -- the 
organization's political goals. 
  If all this is not enough, 'Arafat is appointing two or 
three persons to the same post at a time when a clear chain of 
command is vital. It is not clear why he is behaving this way. 
Perhaps he must appease his many touchy aides who are vital for 
his maintaining control over the organization, or perhaps this 
is a Machiavellian ploy aimed at having his appointees fight 
each other, thus weakening them. The one result, however, is 
incredible confusion. To date, the IDF does not know for sure 
who will be responsible for security in the Gaza Strip and in 
Jericho on 'Arafat's behalf. To be on the safe side, IDF 
officers are holding a dialogue with everybody -- that is, with 
all those who are already in the area. 
  Of all the childhood diseases (so it is hoped) of the 
Palestinian police force, the one that worries the IDF and the 
other security branches most of all is liaison and coordination. 
The joint patrols along previously demarcated roads are not 
such a big problem, because the Palestinian and Israeli 
commanders on the ground can communicate directly. If such a 
patrol is ambushed, for example, it is likely that all its 
members will return the fire. The experience of the recent past 
shows us that former enemies can find a common language, 
especially if they share a common interest. 
  The most difficult mission, however, will be to attain real 
security cooperation and prevent mistakes and regrettable 
mishaps while each side is maintaining its special overt and 
covert operations. For example: What will a Palestinian police 
force do if it recognizes an Israeli intelligence man in the 
area? Or what will soldiers manning an IDF post do if they 
identify Palestinian terrorists preparing for an attack in the 
Palestinian autonomy area, not far from them? 
  The solution proposed by the IDF is to set up coordination 
centers, each one made up of two operations rooms -- one Israeli 
and one Palestinian -- furnished with sophisticated 
communications equipment. These two operations rooms will be 
close to each other, thus enabling quick coordination 24 hours a 
day. This coordination will apply not only to IDF and Border 
Police forces vis-a-vis the Palestinian police force but also to 
the Shin Bet vis-a-vis the Palestinian internal security force. 
Overall security, on the Israeli side, will be in the hands of 
the local IDF commander. There will be two such centers in the 
Gaza Strip: one, located at the Erez checkpoint, for 
coordinating activity in the northern Gaza Strip; the other, in 
Nuriya in the Qatif Bloc near Khan Yunus, for coordinating 
operations in the southern part. In the Jericho enclave, there 
will be one joint operations room. The unfortunate incident in 
Jabalyah last week, in which six Fatah peace supporters were 
killed, apparently made the Palestinians grasp the advantages of 
the method proposed by Israel. 
  Another source for Israeli concern is the weapons -- mainly 
the ammunition -- which will be provided to the Palestinian 
police force. The Palestinians -- particularly those in the 
Gaza Strip -- already have a sizable amount of light weapons. 
There is no shortage of assault rifles, submachine guns, 
pistols, or grenades of all kinds for terrorist acts. The 
terrorists, however, do not have enough ammunition, explosives, 
and long-range weapons such as mortars, heavy machine guns, and 
RPG launchers. 
  Since the IDF will continue to be in charge of the external 
borders of the autonomy, it is likely that the terrorists will 
continue to find it difficult to bring in weapons and ammunition 
from the outside. But at least some of the weapons the 
terrorists lack will be found in the Palestinian police force's 
possession. 
  It will be almost impossible to prevent the transfer of at 
least some of the weapons to the opponents of the peace process. 
Some will probably find their way to the black market, and there 
will probably be a few Palestinian policemen who will decide to 
aid the rejectionist organizations. The IDF has no solution to 
this problem; this issue will rest with the Palestinian police 
commanders and 'Arafat's aides. Well-informed sources promise 
that the Palestinian police force will not have heavy weapons or 
armored vehicles with offensive capabilities. They will have, 
at most, light armored cars equipped with machine guns. 
  The Jewish sector also poses serious problems to the IDF. 
The defense of the settlements in the Gaza Strip will be 
accomplished via the method of enclosed defense. Every bloc of 
settlements will constitute an independently defended area with 
separate headquarters, observation and guard posts, a 
circumferential electronic fence, and security roads. The 
Palestinian police force will not be permitted to enter these 
areas or the roads passing through them. IDF roadblocks along 
these routes will make sure they do not cross. Such roadblocks, 
manned both by IDF soldiers and the Palestinian police, will be 
the locations most prone to attacks, as has already been proved 
by the incident at the Kissufim roadblock, in which a Jew was 
stabbed by his two workers. 
  Another focus for friction involves the Arab workers 
employed 
in the hothouses of the settlements in the Gaza Strip and Jordan 
Valley. Even if vehicle traffic to and from the Green Line is 
banned, such vehicles will still be able to reach the 
roadblocks. An incident similar to the 'Afula car-bomb attack 
can recur at the Erez checkpoint or Kissufim. 
  Israeli settlements bordering on the Gaza Strip will be 
defended by an electronic fence and a security road which will 
be completed in one year. Until then, the area adjacent to the 
Green Line will be prone to infiltrations for purposes of theft 
and terror attacks. 'Afula-style suicide terrorists can still 
enter Israel. It is advisable, therefore, to facilitate the 
erection of this fence. 
  Meanwhile, until the fence is finished, the IDF will provide 
a temporary answer by beefing up its forces along the 
international border. A bypass road is being built near the 
Jericho enclave to provide the Jordan Valley settlements free 
excess from the northern part of the valley to the south and 
from there to Jerusalem and the Dead Sea. According to security 
elements, every settlement in the Jordan Valley -- as opposed to 
the situation in the Strip -- will receive a special "security 
package" designed to meet its particular needs. 
  Fortunately, not many extremist Jewish elements reside 
around 
the Jericho enclave. In the Qatif Bloc and in the settlements 
in the northern part of the Strip, there are some potential 
troublemakers. Some say they number less than 20 people; others 
claim there are more than 30 such troublemakers. The IDF claims 
it makes no difference. The method of defense for the 
settlements and settlers traveling along the roads of the Gaza 
Strip guarantees an almost total separation between the local 
population and the Jewish population. The settlers are not 
supposed to have any contact with the Palestinian police force, 
unless a Jew decides to enter the autonomy area. IDF soldiers 
manning roadblocks will warn these Jews -- settlers or Israelis 
from within the Green Line coming to the Gaza Strip or Jericho 
for business purposes -- that the responsibility is theirs alone 
and will urge them to reconsider. If they identify professional 
Jewish troublemakers, they will probably not be allowed to enter 
the autonomy. 
  The 'Afula car-bomb attack proved again what we already 
know: 
There are no security means or peace arrangements that can stop 
a highly motivated suicide-murderer. The Gaza-Jericho First 
agreement, with its security arrangements, guarantees that the 
number of areas of friction between Israelis and Palestinians 
will be reduced, and this in itself is a significant 
contribution to the security of both sides.

<F P=106> [Report by On Levi] </F>
  [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is completing 
preparations for the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreements. The General Staff believes the agreement will be 
signed on 5 May. 
  The evacuation and redeployment plan can be implemented in 
three different ways. It provides for a speedy evacuation 
lasting only 24 hours, one lasting a week, and a lengthy 
evacuation process that will last for up to three months. The 
Southern Command expressed satisfaction with the speed at which 
the preparations are proceeding and believes that it will be 
ready to carry out the plan on whatever date is determined. 
  The Defense Ministry recently completed contracts with all 
the Gaza Strip settlements for the security forces to enter the 
settlements and use empty structures there. The only Gaza Strip 
settlement with which no agreement has been signed is Netzarim, 
but the Southern Command believes that one will be signed in the 
coming days. 
  Senior Southern Command sources praised the cooperation with 
the Gaza settlement leaders and said that all the obstacles and 
misunderstandings that prevented the Army's entry have been 
removed. 
  Under instruction from Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and 
defense minister, the IDF is currently concentrating its efforts 
on concluding the building of an electronic fence along the 
demarcation line. Eight contractors won a tender to build the 
fence, which is expected to cost 150 million shekels. The IDF 
believes the fence will be completed by early 1995. 
  Until the fence is completed, the IDF is deploying large 
forces along the new lines, and dozens of electronic measures 
have been set up to prevent movement to and from the Gaza Strip 
as long as there is no fence. 
  The Southern Command's engineering units and the IDF 
Logistics Branch are preparing the ground where the forces will 
be deployed once a decision is made to implement the Gaza 
agreement.

    [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 
0705 GMT on 16 April carries a 17-minute recorded report 
compiled by Hayim Hecht on the opposition's alternative to the 
government's peace process in response to Minister Yosi Sarid's 
charges in the Knesset earlier this week that the opposition 
intimidates the people but offers no alternatives. 
  A series of questions was posed to Binyamin Netanyahu, 
Zvulun 
Hammer, Refa'el Eytan, Rehav'am Ze'evi, and Gonen Segev -- 
respectively the leaders of Likud, the NRP (National Religious 
Party), Tzomet, Moledet, and YI'UD (Independent and Democratic 
Israel). 
  Asked whether they would pursue the withdrawal from the Gaza 
Strip if they came to power at this point in time, Netanyahu 
says: "It is too early to tell. Obviously, agreements cannot be 
honored by one side only, while the other side violates them. 
The PLO has actually violated all the commitments it undertook. 
Therefore, I will only be able to answer this question when I 
assume the job of prime minister." 
  Hammer's reply: "It is not easy for a government to violate 
agreements signed by previous governments, but it can halt 
future moves." 
  Eytan's answer: "I would not pull out of the Gaza Strip and 
I would not evacuate settlements. What I would do is give 
municipal autonomy to the Palestinians where they live. I would 
define the urban jurisdiction of Gaza, Rafah, Khan Yunus, and 
other large cities and give them absolute autonomy there; 
namely, to be in charge of internal security in the municipal 
area." 
  Ze'evi notes that "the withdrawal from Gaza will lead to a 
return to Gaza. Gaza cannot be sidestepped, because there is no 
solution for Gaza other than to be annexed to Israel." He goes 
on to say that "the only solution for Gaza, as well as for all 
other parts of western Eretz Yisra'el, is to become parts of the 
State of Israel without annexing its population." 
  In Segev's opinion, "the IDF's withdrawal must be completed 
at this point, if only for one reason: that the Gaza Strip is 
one of the few places on which there is enough consensus that it 
must be evacuated. The settlement of Netzarim, however, is a 
strategic point because the road leading to it separates Gaza 
from the southern part of the Gaza Strip and it is very 
important that we retain this area so as to keep this 
separation." 
  To the question whether the agreement with the PLO would be 
null and void, the Likud leader says: "I said a long time ago 
that this agreement became null and void the moment the PLO 
started to invalidate it; not because I do not like it -- which 
I do not -- but because an agreement that is not binding on the 
PLO is definitely not binding on us." Asked whether he thinks 
the United States would put up with his reneging on the 
agreement with the PLO and on the fact that the PLO would no 
longer be a partner to the dialogue, the Likud leader says: "I 
would not be withdrawing from any agreement. I am simply not 
prepared to honor any agreement unilaterally." 
  Eytan replies: "I cannot abolish an international agreement 
signed by the Israeli Government, but I can definitely reopen 
it." 
  Asked whether 'Arafat and PLO-Tunis would continue to be 
their partners in a dialogue, Netanyahu says: "Our partners 
would be elected in real and democratic elections held under 
meticulous supervision to make sure that people are elected 
legally and rivals are not eliminated. Our partners would be 
people elected from among the local Palestinian population, not 
people imposed by Tunis." 
  Hammer says: "The dialogue with PLO-Tunis is the root of all 
evil. The dialogue with the PLO is a mistake and, consequently, 
the PLO would not be a partner." He goes on to say that 
"although it would not be simple to renege on an international 
agreement, Israel must definitely insist on its demands from the 
other side." 
  Eytan replies: "No, there is nothing to talk about with the 
PLO because the PLO is not a state." 
  Ze'evi retorts: "No way! They are not partners to peace 
because they are not headed toward peace." 
  Segev says: "Being coy does not work any more. Those who 
say that this process can be surgically terminated are either 
being dishonest or are trying to make cheap marginal profits. 
In fact, my plan provides for the application of Israeli 
sovereignty on several areas in Judaea and Samaria. First of 
all, Israeli sovereignty should have been applied at once on all 
the Jewish settlements and the sparsely populated Arab areas 
abutting the Green Line because there is no reason not to." 
  To the question whether IDF (Israel Defense Forces) troops 
would remain in Jabalyah, Netanyahu says: "I have never 
objected to changing the IDF's deployment in Gaza, you never 
heard me say such a thing. I believe we can change our 
deployment and, in the case of Gaza, we can withdraw our troops 
to some other place. However, we cannot have a situation 
whereby our troops are not allowed to enter Gaza, as the 
government agreed to." 
  Eytan says: "In my opinion, the IDF should keep out of the 
refugee camps. If the local population wants to riot, let them 
riot. However, if we get accurate intelligence about a 
terrorist nest inside Jabalyah, we should stage an operation to 
strike at this particular nest. The autonomy would run its own 
affairs in Rafah, for example. It would need us for matters 
outside the municipal boundary, such as transportation, jobs, 
and water." Eytan goes on to say that he would discuss the 
establishment of such a municipal autonomy with "the man or 
council elected in Rafah," even if it is made up of Hamas 
(Islamic Resistance Movement) members. "They may run Rafah 
Hamas-style, but we would not allow terror to get out." 
  Asked how they envision the permanent agreement in Judaea 
and Samaria, Netanyahu says: "The alternative in this case is 
simple. We propose Arab autonomy -- of the Palestinian Arabs in 
Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza -- under Israel's sovereignty. What 
is the difference between the autonomy we propose and the 
government's so-called autonomy? The IDF, and the IDF only -- 
not any army of terrorists -- would guard the borders. The IDF 
would be exclusively responsible for security from the Jordan 
River westward." 
  Hammer replies: "The Jewish settlements could remain where 
they are, and the autonomy would be such that the Arabs would 
rule themselves and we would not rule over another people. I 
think this idea is feasible. Consequently, I think we should 
create a layout of noncontiguous Arab autonomy and contiguous 
blocs of Israeli settlements in whole districts so that they may 
live safely and defend themselves." Asked whether he would 
impose Israeli sovereignty over those blocs, the NRP leader 
says: "I think the arrangement should be such that areas under 
Israeli sovereignty would really be Israeli areas for all 
intents and purposes, whereas the autonomy areas would be 
autonomous areas." Asked how Hebron would fit in such an 
arrangement, he says: "There must be a special arrangement in 
places where Jews live so that they may live fully under Israeli 
sovereignty." 
  Eytan notes that he would "definitely" consider applying 
Israeli sovereignty over Hebron and other areas in Judaea and 
Samaria "because such vagueness calls for international 
intervention." 
  Ze'evi states: "In my opinion, the 1.5 million Palestinians 
living in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza should go to the 21 Arab 
countries whose general territory is 500 times that of Greater 
Israel." 
  Asked how he would go about establishing the strong police 
force stipulated in the Camp David accords, the Likud leader 
says: "According to the Camp David accords, the strong police 
force would not be equipped with machine guns, armored cars, and 
helicopters -- incidentally, most police forces in the world do 
not own such equipment, certainly not in such numbers -- and 
would deal with civilian crimes and infractions. The accords 
say nothing about making such a police force subordinate to some 
kind of Palestinian government or creating what is for all 
intents and purposes a terrorist army." Netanyahu goes on to 
say that the police force he envisions, "would carry guns -- the 
weapons ordinarily carried by policemen -- and would be 
subordinate to Israel. What we are talking about is sovereign 
Israeli rule up to the Jordan River, the IDF being exclusively 
responsible for the area west of the Jordan River, and autonomy 
for the inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza; namely, a 
framework in which they run most areas of their lives through 
their elected representatives, but not areas over which the 
sovereign ruler would be in charge." Asked at which point 
Israeli sovereignty would be enforced on Judaea and Samaria, 
Netanyahu replies: "That is open to negotiation in the 
permanent arrangement period, which we probably would not get 
around to discussing in this term in office." Who would you 
negotiate with, Hecht asks him, and Netanyahu answers: "I would 
negotiate with the aforementioned elected Palestinians, as well 
as with other elements. I believe my proposal would enjoy much 
larger support in the Arab world than is apparent. I think that 
Jordan would favor the solution I am offering -- autonomy rather 
than a state -- and that Syria would also follow suit." Do you 
not think such a turnabout would lead to a prolonged standstill, 
Hecht asks him, and the Likud leader replies: "People say to 
me: Say the Syrians and the Jordanians accepted your proposal 
-- I would like to add that the Saudis would also favor autonomy 
over a Palestinian state, which would be emerging in the heart 
of the Middle East and would also threaten them -- but would the 
Palestinians? I say that the Arabs would accept the autonomy 
arrangement if they realize Israel will not agree to give the 
Palestinians an independent state." 
  Turning to the negotiations with Syria, Hecht asks whether 
these would be based on the premise of a possible Israeli 
withdrawal on the Golan Heights. Netanyahu replies: "I think 
such a question is not at all on the agenda, because the current 
promontory line is the line upon which Yitzhaq Rabin insisted in 
the 1974 disengagement agreements, and for a good reason: it 
provides us with a defensive wall." Asked what he would discuss 
with the Syrians, he says: "I would tell Hafiz al-Asad the 
following: There are issues we can agree and talk about, other 
than the strategic buffer that keeps the peace for me and 
prevents you from going to war with me. For example, I can 
discuss with you Syria's foremost problem, that of water, which 
is going to become a vital issue. I can talk to him about arms 
control, stopping the arms race, and the security arrangements 
we could make. I can talk to Syria about what it wants most: 
to be struck off the list of terror-supporting countries." 
  Hammer says: "The situation calls for a courageous decision. 
The question that everybody must put on the table is: Are you 
prepared to step down from the Golan Heights in exchange for an 
arrangement with the Syrians? I am not." 
  Eytan says he "would ask the Syrians: What would you give us 
in exchange for peace? What price would you pay for the peace 
we would be giving you?" He goes on to note that he would 
"under no circumstances whatsoever discuss a withdrawal on the 
Golan. If the Syrians want peace, let them give us another bit 
of the Golan Heights or of the area under their control." Asked 
whether he is aware of the fact that his positions actually mean 
he would have nothing to discuss with the Syrians, Eytan says: 
"Is our purpose to talk or is it to achieve something? Talking 
is a means to achieve a purpose. The national purpose, as I 
perceive it, is a Greater Israel with the Golan as an 
inseparable part of it in order to safeguard our security." 
  Ze'evi sarcastically replies: "I do not want to demand from 
the Syrians that they withdraw even more." 
  Segev's position: "As far as I am concerned, the Golan 
Heights are taboo. However, seeing that the right wing agreed 
to go to a referendum or to elections over this subject, it will 
be up to the people to decide." 
  Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1000 GMT on 16 April 
adds 
that "opposition leaders have been discussing the establishment 
of a shadow government. Hammer and Eytan say that it is 
imperative that Rabin and his government be confronted by a 
shadow government, whose ministers would comment on current 
affairs and present an alternative policy to the public to 
illustrate the option offered by the right-wing camp. Netanyahu 
noted that the problem with establishing such a shadow 
government is the surplus of good candidates for the job of 
ministers, but he believes the proper formula will be found."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yo'el Marcus: "His Hardest Hour"] </F>
  [Text] Had I been a silver-tongued orator I would have 
said that I have not come to praise Yitzhaq Rabin or to bury 
him, but to defend him. And these days, when facing his 
hardest hour as a national leader, he needs support. Overnight, 
his fortune changed dramatically. Only a year ago, he was 
considered by many the right man, in the right place, at the 
right time, and now he is slowly becoming the national doormat. 
  He is being attacked by politicians on the right and left 
for 
conflicting traits: He is too fast, he is too slow, he is too 
stubborn, he is too lenient, he is too strong, he is too weak. 
With the friends he has he does not need enemies. Shulamit 
Aloni says that he "radiates weakness." Hayim Ramon stabs him 
in the back by creating a split in Labor, Rabin's only fort. 
Yosi Sarid, who bends over backward to act as Rabin's 
spokesman, convinces MAPAM [United Workers Party] to help smash 
Labor's rule of the Histadrut. "My dear friend" Arye Der'i 
prevents SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] from joining the 
coalition. There are ministers whispering about their prime 
minister's "hesitancy and inability to make decisions." And 
there are those among them who confide about his "loss of 
control" and "conceding too much" to 'Arafat. 
  There has been a no less dramatic change in the attitude of 
the man in the street. Wherever he goes, Rabin faces heckling 
and calls of "cheater," "traitor," or "death to Rabin." For the 
first time since he became prime minister, public opinion polls 
show that almost 60 percent are dissatisfied with Rabin's 
performance. For the first time since he came to power, the 
polls show that Netanyahu, and even Peres, would beat him at the 
polls. 
  The procrastination in the negotiations angers what is 
called 
the "Peace Now" camp -- as though the PLO, where disorder 
reigns, has no part in it and it is also Rabin's fault. The 
latest terrorist attacks have been exploited by the "national 
camp" as proof of his weakness -- as though no Jewish blood was 
shed under the Likud. That is how a developing unwritten, and 
definitely unholy, pact between the opposition and those who are 
supposed to be Rabin's supporters and allies in eroding his 
leadership. While Rabin is struggling with the peace front, the 
right wing is becoming more popular, just as his allies are 
stealing the political base on which he depends. 
  I have not come to praise Rabin, but to express concern 
about 
the trend to bury him. Rabin is currently the only politician 
with the experience, and perhaps the ability, to take the big 
leap into the peace era. It is true that he is no Churchill, 
and a thick book listing his mistakes and faults can be written. 
Sometimes he is his own worst enemy, often he shows disdain for 
others, acting like a Johnny-know-it-all, and he justifiably 
gets whacked over the head from time to time for his arrogance 
and mistakes. Nevertheless, he is still the right man, at the 
right place, at the right time for two reasons with which it is 
hard to argue: 
  First, because he has a mixture of personal traits which 
serve well the path he is taking: On the one hand, political 
ripeness, which apparently comes with age, and which led him to 
understand that there is no future to the policy of pure might 
and breaking bones. He chose the path of peace arrangements in 
return for concessions on territories. On the other hand, he 
was and remains "Mr. Defense," which is expressed in his 
insistence that concessions must not harm Israel's security and 
the IDF's preparations for the battlefield of the future, which 
might be fought against far off countries like Iraq and Iran. 
  Whoever claims that giving up territories endangers Israel's 
security will find in Rabin a rare combination of a readiness to 
make concessions and concern for security. To my great regret, 
when we look around we find either those willing to concede all 
-- for whom time is short -- or those who preach security for 
its own sake. And both types are no alternative to Rabin. 
  Second, it is hard to find at present political alternatives 
to the path Rabin has taken. The opposition based on the Likud 
has still not come up with an alternative policy and has not 
cultivated a leader prepared to continue the path of peace. No 
immediate successor to Rabin has emerged inside Labor. It is 
doubtful whether Shim'on Peres, somebody with an outstanding 
political vision, could have brought Labor to power, received 
approval for the Oslo agreement, or talked with 'Arafat, had he 
been prime minister. There is nothing to be done, this nation, 
whether justifiably or not, does not trust Peres. Beyond these 
two "old timers," many political babes can be seen on the 
horizon, but not a single leader who can out perform Rabin right 
now. 
  He is easily miffed, he is indecisive, he is too arrogant, 
he 
is too indulgent, he is too stubborn -- but in the political 
vacuum we are facing, there is no alternative to Yitzhaq Rabin. 
We must nurture him so that nothing happens to him.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Pinhas 'Inbari: "Why Pique the Iranian </F>
Giant?"] 
  [Text] Israel's warning to Jordan regarding Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] activity there came as a surprise. Until 
now, the only Israeli threats to Jordan had come from those 
circles that consider the eastern bank of the Jordan River the 
alternative Palestinian homeland. For example, Ari'el Sharon 
used to take advantage of security incidents on the Jordanian 
border or terror acts planned at the headquarters of Abu-Jihad 
[Khalil al-Wazir] in the Jordanian capital to threaten to 
"bombard the terrorist headquarters in Amman." 
  Has Israel under Peres and Rabin begun to adopt such an 
attitude? The answer is necessarily negative. What, then, 
motivated the surprising Israeli threat to Jordan at a time when 
Jordan is in the midst of restoring its status in the West Bank 
and on the eve of the ceremony inaugurating the Dome of the Rock 
on the Temple Mount? In the not too distant past, Israel 
supported such developments. Has Israel changed its stand, and 
is it no longer interested in an improvement in Jordan's status 
in the territories? 
  The answer to this question, too, is negative. The fact is 
that Israel has helped Jordan rehabilitate its banking system in 
the territories and cooperated with it in frustrating 
Palestinian attempts to set up their own central bank and issue 
their own currency. Israel is coordinating the new arrangements 
at the Cave of the Patriarchs with Jordan, not with the PLO. 
  It may well be that the affair should be taken at face 
value. 
A bleeding Israel could not tolerate a situation in which Hamas 
spokesmen brag about their murderous acts from well-protected 
offices in Amman and even threaten to continue them. 
  And yet, with regard to Israeli-Jordanian cooperation on 
several issues pertaining to the negotiations with the 
Palestinians, it is hard to ignore several unpleasant aspects of 
the relations between the two countries, which culminated in the 
Israeli warning to its eastern neighbor. 
  In general, the rehabilitation of Jordan's status in the 
territories comes at the expense of the Oslo agreements. The 
less glamorous the agreements seem, the stronger Jordan's status 
becomes. 
  Israel has noticed that Jordan has been establishing 
alliances with Palestinian circles that oppose the agreements. 
Amman has become a center of conspiracy and intrigue against 
'Arafat. It is no accident that, for example, when the members 
of the PLO Executive Committee were summoned to Tunis last 
month, they preferred to meet in Jordan, thereby demonstrating 
that 'Arafat did not have a majority to ratify the Cairo 
agreements. Amman also hosted contacts the Palestinian People's 
Party and FIDA [Palestinian Democratic Federation] conducted 
with the Democratic and Popular Fronts for the Liberation of 
Palestine, headed by Habash and Hawatimah. The contacts sought 
to establish a new Palestinian political apparatus to replace 
the alignment of forces that supported the Oslo agreements at 
the outset. 
  The contacts failed, but Israel resented them nonetheless. 
Behind them lies the fact that although Jordan supports the Oslo 
agreements in word, it is very worried by them and is working to 
thwart them in deed. This is the reason for Jordan's 
cooperation with Syria. Israel views the tightening 
Jordan-Syria relations as conflicting with the approach Israel 
would expect Jordan to adopt at this time. 
  Jordan recently considered replacing the government under 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali with a new government headed by Zayd 
al-Rifa'i. Al-Majali has been identified with the Madrid 
Conference and the peace process since its early days, while 
al-Rifa'i, more than any other Jordanian politician, is 
identified with Syria. It can be assumed that one of the 
reasons Husayn eventually decided against turning the domestic 
tables around was U.S. and Israeli pressure. 
  Nevertheless, the pro-Syrian line is beginning to have a 
negative effect on Jordanian policy. For example, in the 
previous round of talks in Washington, Israel expected practical 
discussions on the water issue, while Jordan surprised it by 
raising impossible demands, such as determining the borderline 
at this time. Husayn's demand that the blockade on the 
al-'Aqabah port be lifted as a precondition for Jordan's 
participation in the next round of Washington talks coincides 
with the rapprochement between the Jordanian and the Syrian 
attitudes. At the same time, it seems that the blockade 
business also attests to a Jordanian attempt to counterbalance 
its rapprochement with Syria by reserving the option of striking 
an alliance with Iraq in due time. 
  A very special development in terms of the relations 
between Israel and Jordan is seen in Israel's relations with the 
Gulf emirates. It is worth noting that while Israel sent a 
large delegation to Oman, Jordan sent a small technical 
delegation, practically adopting the Syrian policy of boycotting 
the multilateral talks. This is a major negative development, 
because Jordan played an important role in convincing Oman to 
accept an Israeli delegation. Despite tension between the 
Hashemites and the oil emirates of the Gulf, Jordan and Oman 
have good relations. In principle, Jordan's retreat from the 
peace process according to its original parameters stems from 
its submission to Syrian influence. At the same time, one should 
study Jordan's policy toward the Gulf for signs of Jordanian 
fears of Israeli involvement there. 
  While living under a heavy Iranian threat, the Emirates 
cannot trust Iraq or Saudi Arabia. It is an unknown fact that, 
until the Kuwait crisis, some of the Gulf Emirates trusted 
Jordan as the military force that could, to some extent, help 
them in the face of the Iranian threat. Jordanian officers 
trained and advised the Armies of the Emirates, and several 
Jordanian Army units were stationed in the Gulf. Jordan's role 
there came to an end when it chose to strike an alliance with 
Yemen and Iraq, thus losing the trust of the Emirates. Jordan 
is currently engaged in an effort to bolster its status in the 
Gulf. At the same time, the Israeli connection with the 
Emirates began to take shape. 
  Obviously, the Emirates will seek to examine the extent to 
which the peace process' successful completion can provide them 
with Israeli protection against the Iranian threat. This is 
what lies at the very root of Iran's interest in doing as much 
damage as possible to the peace process: The real struggle is 
over security arrangements in the Gulf. 
  As will be recalled, the Gulf states rejected offers from 
Egypt and Syria to take part in security arrangements because 
they did not trust the two countries. 
  Jordan recently started exploring the option of reviving its 
old status in the Gulf, and along comes Israel as an undesired 
competitor. The way things look now, there appears to be an 
Israeli-Jordanian competition over the Gulf, but this may not 
necessarily lead to a crisis. The fact is that Jordan initially 
supported Israel's participation in the Oman conference. Should 
Israeli-Jordanian relations evolve into a joint confederation 
with the Palestinians, the emirates could be convinced that such 
a confederation is not against them. 
  Meanwhile, matters between Israel and Jordan have taken a 
negative turn, mainly because Israel is displeased with what it 
believes are Jordanian attempts to frustrate the negotiations 
with the PLO. Two negative landmarks are worth mentioning in 
this regard: One is the failure of Foreign Minister Peres' 
talks with King Husayn late last year. Husayn not only failed 
to speed up the talks, as Peres had hoped; he even held them up. 
The second is Jordan's evading pressure from Peres to convene 
the big "new Middle East" economic conference. 
  In November, Jordanian Crown Prince Hasan said in an 
interview to Beirut's AL-SAFIR that he felt humiliated by the 
White House public meeting with Peres, which had been forced on 
him. Peres became convinced that Jordan would not budge without 
Syria, but nevertheless, apparently still recommended putting 
pressure on the Jordanian-Syrian connection in order to remove 
an important bargaining card from al-Asad. 
  Another reference point was Husayn's failure to meet King 
Fahd two months ago when he had reason to believe that the Saudi 
monarch would receive him after the 'Umra pilgrimage, which he 
did not make during the hajj period. King Husayn was upset and 
returned to Amman deeply offended. He is convinced that the 
Americans, at Israel's behest, convinced King Fahd to rejected 
his outstretched hand. 
  Paradoxically, Husayn's humiliation might now promote his 
relations with Fahd. We should recall that the Saudi monarch 
had to settle with King Husayn for the Jordanian's support of 
Saddam during the Kuwaiti crisis. Now that he has offended him, 
Fahd will be better prepared to forgive Husayn. In the 
meantime, however, Husayn feels a need to get back at the United 
States and Israel. 
  The pressures and counter pressures endanger the peace 
process and the internal stability of the states in the region. 
The Israeli threat to Jordan revealed the basic dispute between 
Jordan and Egypt over the Islamic terrorist struggle. 
  We should note that compared to President Mubarak, who has 
come out openly against the Islamic extremists, King Husayn 
tries to appease them although they also threaten his regime. 
  Husayn has on several occasions come out against Islamic 
extremists and said that they are not true Islam, which is an 
enlightened and progressive religion. But the king did not hand 
down to the Jordanian Army orders like those Mubarak gave the 
Egyptian Army in its struggle against the Islamic extremists. 
The different approach by Jordan and Egypt on that matter makes 
it hard for Mubarak because Husayn presents a different example 
of how to treat the Islamic problem. We can assume that Mubarak 
tried to convince Husayn to adopt the Egyptian model of the 
struggle against the religious fanatics, but to no avail. 
  The Israeli threat forces Husayn to face a new challenge, to 
make a decision contrary to his judgment. Therefore, Israel 
must consider whether what is gained by the pressure might not 
be at Jordan's expense, since the struggle based on the Egyptian 
model might break up the Jordan vessel and sink it. 
  Israel is exerting tough pressures on Jordan: On the one 
hand, not to interfere with the implementation of the Oslo 
agreements, and on the other, not to sink too deep into 
al-Asad's strangling embrace. Both Israel and Jordan are 
therefore suddenly finding themselves competing for influence in 
the Persian Gulf, thereby annoying the Iranian giant, waiting on 
the other side of the sea. 
  Israel must not forget that despite the threats to Jordan 
that Iran is the real enemy of the peace process. The dangerous 
connection created between Iran and the Hamas leadership in 
Jordan is the real development but that is a different story.

  [Text] In view of the UN declaration of its inability to 
defend the people of Gorazde, the president of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran has expressed Iran's readiness to send forces 
to the area for defense against the Serbs. 
  Following the intensification of the Serbs' attacks on 
cities 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina and especially on Gorazde, and in reply to 
a written message from Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic to 
our president on the painful predicament of the people in 
Bosnia, Hashemi-Rafsanjani held a telephone conversation with 
the Bosnian president last night and discussed the latest 
situation in the war- stricken areas in Bosnia, especially in 
the occupied city of Gorazde. 
  In this telephone conversation, the president pointed out 
that the people and the government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran fully understand and are concerned about the painful and, 
at the same time, sensitive situation of the defenseless and 
Muslim people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially Gorazde, and 
stated that all the officials and people--from the esteemed 
leader of the Islamic revolution down to the Government and 
people of Iran--are sorrowfully following the bitter and painful 
events in Bosnia, which are taking place before the indifferent 
eyes of the world. 
  He stated that when the United Nations refused the offer by 
the Islamic Republic of Iran to dispatch forces to defend the 
people of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the areas that the UN had 
declared safe havens, the Iranian nation realized that the 
international organizations and countries are not serious in 
their claims to defend the defenseless people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The president added: Now again, since the 
United Nations has overtly declared its inability to defend the 
oppressed Bosnian nation, the Islamic Republic of Iran is ready 
to send forces to the areas under UN supervision to defend the 
rights of the Muslim Bosnians. Iran also welcomes the 
assistance of other countries. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to the Serbs' chemical attacks 
on 
Gorazde and expressed the Islamic Republic's readiness to send 
them defensive equipment, namely masks and antichemical uniforms. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani asked the Bosnian president to convey the 
greetings and sympathies of the Iranian people to the oppressed 
Bosnian people and to consider the Islamic Republic of Iran a 
partner in their affliction and to rest assured that the Iranian 
government and nation will do their best not to desert the 
Bosnian people in their struggle for the vindication of their 
definite rights. 
  Alija Izetbegovic expressed the gratitude of the Bosnian 
Government and people for Iran's humanitarian assistance and 
briefed the president on the latest situation in Gorazde and 
added: Gorazde is still resisting the aggressors. But it is 
under heavy shelling, and the situation in the city is extremely 
difficult and disturbing. He expressed his confidence that the 
people and government of the Islamic Republic of Iran will 
support the oppressed people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as in the 
past.

  [Text] In an interview with the correspondent of the Voice 
and Vision, Brigadier General Afshar, commander of the Basij 
force of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, spoke of the 
expression of readiness by the Islamic Republic of Iran to 
dispatch peacekeeping forces to Bosnia. He added: 
  [Begin recording] [Afshar] Since the beginning of the 
atrocity against the Muslims of Bosnia, sorrow has entered the 
hearts of our popular and Hezbollah forces -- in particular our 
Basij forces -- who have been awaiting the right opportunity to 
be present on the scene of defending the Muslims. 
  The present situation in Gorazde is rather strange 
considering that the United Nations declared the town as a safe 
haven, and we know that if global arrogance wishes, it is 
capable of stopping the Serbs, especially when one considers 
what happened after Iraq's attack on Kuwait. Under the present 
circumstances, that is after the attack by Serbian froces on 
Gorazde, there is increasing pressure on the minds of Muslims, 
in particular on our Basij forces. There have been numerous 
phone calls from our Basij personnel to our barracks and 
headquarters, urging the officials to facilitate their dispatch 
to the area. 
  [Correspondent] In your opinion, how many personnel can the 
Basij force dispatch to Bosnia as part of the UN peacekeeping 
forces? 
  [Afshar] We can meet the demand for any number of forces, 
such as say 10,000 or 20,000, or in fact any number which is 
necessary for Goradze in particular or Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
general. All these forces are of course volunteers. We are, 
moreover, prepared to send these volunteers without expecting to 
receive any payment from international organizations. [end

<F P=106> [Commentary by news research and commentaries group] </F>
  [Text] While global insistence on military intervention to 
prevent the aggressive Serbs' shocking crimes in Gorazde is 
increasing, the United Nations and world powers have refused to 
adopt a serious approach on this problem, which has greatly 
jeopardized world security, and have even abandoned their former 
threats. 
  With the increasing human tragedy of the military fall of 
Gorazde and increased world demands for military intervention 
against the Serbs, new overtures are being made by foreign 
countries involved in the Bosnian crisis to give the Serbs a 
free hand to intensify their aggression. 
  The United Nations has withdrawn its limited forces from the 
oppressed city of Gorazde on various pretexts. There was never 
more than 15 UN soldiers protecting this city, which was 
declared a so-called safe haven by the United Nations, and its 
70,000 inhabitants from the Serbs' immense military power. But 
even these 15 UN soldiers were withdrawn from Gorazde at a time 
of danger, which is exactly the time when they should have 
carried out their duties. 
  The United Nations is now pursuing a policy that the 
presence 
or absence of forces is ineffective, therefore it is better to 
leave Bosnia. Thus, the Serbs have received the initial green 
light from the United Nations for their future crimes. 
  Following this step by the United Nations, which definitely 
stems from the decision by the Western countries and others 
involved in the Bosnian problem, Russia has also stated that it 
will soon end its mediatory role with the Serbs. This stance by 
Russia has of course been adopted within the framework of 
condemning the Serbs. However, when Russia ends its mediatory 
role it will be shunning responsibility for the Serbs' actions 
and will be giving them a free hand to commit other crimes. In 
addition, in closing this channel of contact the possibility of 
inflicting pressure on the Serbs will decrease. 
  Russia is continuing its indirect support for the Serbs and 
has stated that it opposes any type of blind bombing of Serb 
positions. This is at a time when the blind bombing and the 
unrestrained massacre of the Muslims in Gorazde have--according 
to various news agencies--filled the streets of the city with 
the corpses of Bosnian martyrs and wounded. 
  In parallel with the new policy of the United Nations and 
Russia, NATO has also stated that it will not take any military 
step without the approval of NATO members. Thus, the main 
foreign powers involved in the Bosnian crisis have washed their 
hands of world demands for serious action against the Serbs. 
This clearly means that the Serbs have been given a free hand 
and the green light for their crimes. 
  Something that further clarifies the new program of the 
United Nations and the will of the world powers is the brief but 
horrific news about returning the Serbian heavy artillery 
centers around the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo to the Serbs. 
Thus, the United Nations should expect a heavier tragedy than 
that of Gorazde. 
  This also clarifies the fate of the world of Islam, too. If 
the world of Islam does not adopt a serious approach on the 
Gorazde tragedy, the Western countries, the United Nations, and 
the Serbs are ready to create new tragedies. In the midst of 
all these bitter and soul-rending incidents, the Muslims should 
once again realize the fact that in this era of force their only 
alternative to continue to live is to become more powerful.

  [Text] Tehran, April 19, IRNA -- A Persian daily said 
Tuesday that the oppressed nations of the world have no 
alternative but to turn their back to the existing international 
bodies and try to form a centre which could really demonstrate 
the will of the nations. 
  `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' in its editorial commented on the siege 
of Gorazde and criticized the United Nations, the U.S. and the 
majority of European governments for showing green light to the 
Serbs. 
  Turning to the developments in Gorazde, the daily said that 
the aggression took place in the very presence of U.N. Forces 
who were stationed in the town as protectors of peace and 
security but did nothing to prevent the Serbs. 
  It lashed out at the U.N. for not condemning the Serbs for 
their explicit breach of its approvals and stressed that such an 
indifferent attitude further emboldened the Serbs to continue 
their aggression. 
  The criminal Serbs not only did not abide by any war 
regulations and attacked the defenceless people, but even 
deployed chemical weapons which are internationally banned, said 
the paper. 
  It criticized the dual standards shown by the Security 
Council in connection with crisis in Bosnia and said that while 
the Council would hastily issue a statement for the death of a 
Zionist it would fail to show any reaction towards the genocide 
in Gorazde. 
  The daily stressed that this proved once again that the 
Security Council has no desire to enforce its approvals or the 
internationally respected regulations when interests of the 
oppressed nations are at risk. 
  The daily said that the U.S. statesmen, including President 
Bill Clinton, did not interfere in the issue because their 
interests were not involved. It also proved that the new world 
order, masterminded by the U.S., is nothing but giving a wider 
dimension to aggression in order to plunder nations and increase 
Washington's influence. 
  The daily touched on the call by President Alija Izetbegovic 
for the resignation of U.N. Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali and said this was the least measure expected in 
return for the procrastination the world body. 
  The proper measure, said the article, is that the United 
Nations be dissolved since it is a tool in the hands of tyrant 
and oppressive powers who are supporting the criminals. 
  The reality is that the oppressed nations have no way but to 
turn their back to the present international gatherings and try 
to establish a centre that would serve as a real forum for 
demonstrating the will of the nations, the daily noted. 
  The takeover of Gorazde is the cry of death of the United 
Nations, it concluded.

  [Text] Tehran, April 20, IRNA -- Two morning dailies 
criticized U.N.'s ineffectiveness in supporting defenceless 
people in Gorazde and termed the body a U.S. "lackey" whose 
decisions were in conformity with initiatives of 
quasi-superpowers and only served to appease the Serbs. 
  "TEHRAN TIMES" in its editorial referred to the statements 
by 
some U.N. member countries expressing regret over the 
"miserable" U.N. failure in protecting lives of innocent 
civilians in the "safe areas" of Gorazde. 
  The U.N.'s inability to carry out its peacekeeping duties 
also prompted one of its officials to say: "The United Nations 
died on the hills of Gorazde." 
  "The fact that the United Nations is greatly influenced by 
the U.S. is no secret. Evicting Saddam's army from Kuwait, 
which was done mostly through the deployment of American forces, 
removed any doubt in this regard. It proved that what Uncle Sam 
wants from the U.N., Uncle Sam gets from the U.N." 
  Stressing that the U.N. is only a mercenary of the U.S. and 
its allies, the paper said that the only possible conclusion is 
that the Serbs carried out the West's real objective of 
decimating the only Muslim state in Europe and are being 
protected and rewarded by their American and European masters. 
  Commenting on the same subject, "KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL" wrote 
in its editorial that the world's free people expected the U.N. 
to stop "being a pawn in the game of rivalry between the powers 
and quasi- superpowers." 
  The body's passive policy in clear contradiction to the 
active policy adopted vis-a-vis Iraq and Somalia, had rendered 
the U.N. weak and unable to assert its will where the world 
deemed necessary, the article said. 
  Referring to the fact that the U.N. has been created to help 
alleviate the pain and suffering of the toiling humanity, the 
paper noted that the body must strive to do its duty within its 
Charter which calls for the defence of any people that might 
face extermination such as the people of Gorazde. 
  The U.N. as a world body should represent all its members 
and 
should not come under the direct or indirect influence of a few, 
only then would the world experience peace and happiness, 
concluded the paper.

  [Text] United Nations, New York, April 20, IRNA -- Iran's 
deputy foreign minister for international affairs, Mohammad 
Javad Zarif here today called for the establishment of a zone 
free from weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, 
formation of security and cooperation arrangements in the 
Persian Gulf area, and reduction of military expenditures 
including agreement on a ceiling for international arms purchase 
and transfer to each country in the area. 
  Addressing the United Nations Disarmament Commission, he 
also 
called for the establishment of a forum in which concerns and 
suggestions of Persian Gulf states in the area of security and 
armaments could be aired and debated. 
  He also called for the inclusion of new items on illicit 
arms 
trade on the agenda of the commission. 
  He added, "This issue, which has very direct and close links 
to international drug trafficking as well as terrorism, has had 
serious consequences for the security of a number of states 
across the globe. Like terrorism and drug menace, illicit arms 
trade is an international problem, requiring international 
cooperation, and a common approach. The commission can thus 
play a very constructive role by establishing guidelines and 
pointing areas of mutual effort and cooperation." 
  Stressing nuclear disarmament and destruction of existing 
nuclear weapons, he said, "It is also self evident that the most 
effective guarantee against the use of nuclear weapons is 
nuclear disarmament, including destruction of all existing 
nuclear arsenals. Furthermore, the obvious fact that no 
non-proliferation scheme will succeed so long as nuclear 
disarmament is not clearly in perspective should not be 
overlooked." 
  Referring to the collapse of the bipolar world order, he 
said, "States that hold massive stockpiles of nuclear weapons 
have, at least, a moral obligation to explain to the 
international community as to what remains as the logic behind 
maintaining nuclear weapons. The world has the right to know who 
these weapons are intended for and who they are to deter any 
more." 
  "It is quite shocking that no major country possessing 
nuclear weapons really come forward in this regard. At the same 
time, they seek unlimited extension of the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty, making it absolutely clear that even the ultimate goal 
remains non- proliferation rather than eradication of nuclear 
weapon which is indeed the stated objective of the treaty," 
Zarif said. 
  Referring to the discriminations inherent in the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), he said, "Probably the most 
important and fundamental flaw in the international 
non-proliferation regime is the application of double standards 
which has led to selective proliferation of nuclear weapons." 
  This has not only gravely undermined the authority and 
relevance of the NPT, but also had serious ramifications for 
international and regional peace and security, and retarded 
regional initiatives, he added. 
  On Israel's negative role in the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, Zarif said, "In our 
region, the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Israel has foiled 
all efforts for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone 
in the Middle East, despite General Assembly's unanimous and 
continuous endorsement for the past two decades of the idea put 
forward originally by Iran in 1974." 
  Elsewhere on the NPT Zarif said, "The states which are 
renouncing the nuclear option through the NPT must be granted 
full access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes." 
  On the chemical weapons, Zarif said that the arbitrary 
limitations on transfer of material and technology has already 
had its negative effects on discussions to formulate 
verification mechanisms related to the convention on the 
prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of 
bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and their 
destruction. 
  The enthusiasm of many countries to sign the convention will 
give way to reluctance and indifference when the time for 
ratification and implementation arrives, he said. 
  An intrusive verification system may hamper development in 
the field of peaceful use in another very significant area, he 
said, adding that real guarantees and commitments for removal of 
all restrictions as well as transfer of material and related 
technology by the producing countries before considering new 
verification system is necessary.

severity of the verbal attacks on the United States, the mullahs 
in Tehran are preparing to make a new attempt to open the door 
of dialogue with it. Well-informed sources in Tehran said 
yesterday that 'Ali Khamene'i, guide of the Iranian republic, 
has ordered that a special study be conducted on Iranian-U.S. 
relations and the future course which Tehran should take in this 
connection. 
  Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani raised with 'Ali 
Khamene'i the idea of preparing a special report on this issue. 
It is worth mentioning that in his private conversations, 
Rafsanjani supports normalizing relations with Washington. 
  The task of preparing this report has been assigned to three 
people: Ardeshir Larijani [Foreign Ministry adviser]; Sa'id 
Raja'i Khorasani, member of the Majles (Iranian parliament); and 
Mahmud Va'ezi, deputy foreign minister. 
  Khamene'i's and Rafsanjani's joint initiative is aimed at 
moving the issue of relations with Washington out of the circle 
of political debate between the wings of the ruling 
establishment, because competition among the various wings was 
the cause of tension in Iranian-U.S. relations and in relations 
with other states. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, April 19, IRNA -- The English daily `KAYHAN 
INTERNATIONAL' in its editorial Tuesday [19 April] said that the 
U.S. confused military policies show that the U.S. senior 
officials themselves are foggy about the rules governing 
eventualities. 
  The paper referred to the downing of two American 
helicopters 
by two American F-15 jets last Thursday in which 26 American and 
allied personnel were killed in what had been termed a `friendly 
fire' disaster in northern Iraq. 
  It commented that had the helicopters been downed by Iraqi 
aircraft the consequence would have been disastrous and Pentagon 
would have mobilized allied support and "once again we would 
have witnessed a display of American military machismo with 
innocent Iraqi citizens being the target of relentless hellfire 
of the allied war machine." 
  The article said, "It is only when Americans erroneously 
kill 
their compatriots or get killed by the enemy that it becomes an 
eye-opener for U.S. policy makers to review their rules of 
engagements in military operations abroad. The rules defining 
when U.S. forces can attack enemies have now been tightened." 
  After a series of foreign policy and military faux pas, now 
the world sees a Clinton deflated and the American people 
demoralized over Washington's foreign policy. Human errors made 
at the lower levels are a reflection of bigger blunders 
committed by the top brass, concluded the editorial.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The recent indiscriminate Zionist air raids against 
civilian areas in southern Lebanon have caused a new wave of 
angry reactions from Lebanese political and religious circles. 
After the artillery shelling of the coastal city of Sidon, 
Zionist planes raided several areas in the south. Dozens of 
civilians were killed or wounded and a large number of houses 
were destroyed in the raids and the shelling. 
  Despite these recent acts of aggression, which once again 
turned world attention to the developments in southern Lebanon 
and to the brutal Zionist policies there, Washington, in a 
public, biased step toward the usurper entity, called on the 
Lebanese Government to bring the situation under control. The 
U.S. Administration's message to the Lebanese Government 
yesterday, Friday, said Lebanon must take the necessary measures 
to calm the situation in the south and put an end to violence 
there. 
  This, naturally, is not the first time Washington has 
adopted 
such a biased position in favor of Israel, despite all its 
flagrant violations of international law and its blatant 
aggression against Lebanon. Over the past 10 years Washington 
has persisted in its illegitimate support for Israel's 
occupation. The Zionist forces are occupying hundreds of square 
meters of Lebanese territory, deploying thousands of Zionist 
soldiers and officers in that area, which Israel calls a 
security belt. But this is not all: Tel Aviv has repeatedly 
invaded Lebanese territory, and its aggression has reached the 
Lebanese capital itself. 
  The continuation of these acts of aggression deprive the 
Lebanese people of security and stability. Nevertheless, the 
United States insists on its support for this aggressor and 
usurper entity. Not only did the United States fail to condemn 
the Israeli aggression, but it also asked the Lebanese 
Government to apply effective pressure on the Islamic resistance 
movement in south Lebanon, the movement that fights the Zionist 
occupation from inside Lebanese territory. 
  The United States, which gave several warnings to the 
Lebanese Government on this subject, forgot that the 
international public knows that self-defense is a right of any 
nation under foreign occupation. International laws give the 
Lebanese people the right to defend their land. These laws 
condemn Israel and its aggressive and expansionist policies. 
Israel is still disregarding Security Council Resolution 425 
some 15 years after it was issued; the resolution says Israel 
must withdraw from the occupied Lebanese territories.

  [Text] Ankara, April 16, IRNA -- The Iranian Embassy here 
has rejected accusations levelled by the Turkish Daily HURRIYET 
that Iran was selling missiles to Armenia and printing 
counterfeit dollars. 
  HURRIYET in its Tuesday [12 April] issue claimed that 
counterfeit dollars were printed by sophisticated printing 
machines in Iran and Iraq and then taken to Turkish markets. 
  In a statement released Thursday, the embassy said that 
HURRIYET's baseless allegations were aimed at tarnishing the 
image of the Islamic Republic of Iran before the Turkish public 
opinion. 
  The embassy also denied that Iran has sold missiles to 
Armenia.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] In the most recent martyrdom-seeking attempt in 
occupied Palestine, yesterday a Palestinian mujahid in Jerusalem 
attacked a group of Zionists with an ax and seriously wounded 
four of them. Along with this attack, Islamic Resistance 
Movement--Hamas--stated that if the Zionist regime promises to 
completely halt the massacre of Palestinian civilians, the 
movement will review its attacks on the Zionist regime's 
civilian targets. 
  Political observers believe that until recently, the Zionist 
regime acted unilaterally in massacring the oppressed 
Palestinians. However, since the time the Islamic Resistance 
Movement acquired more strength in organizing retaliatory 
attacks and proved this strength, the heads of the Zionist 
regime realized that vulnerability is mutual and that the 
intensification of state terrorism in the occupied territories 
will engulf the usurping Zionist regime as well. 
  Under such conditions, the proposal by Hamas to completely 
halt attacks on civilians is opportune and conveys a significant 
message. Until now the Zionist regime has been able to render 
several million Palestinians homeless in the land of their 
forefathers by resorting to direct military and terrorist 
methods and indirect political-economic pressures; and if the 
Zionist regime abandons this behavior under the pressure of the 
crushing blows by the Palestinian martyr-seekers, the Islamic 
movement in Palestine will have achieved something that Israel 
has never surrendered to since the outset of its usurping 
presence. But if the Zionist regime opposes this proposal--and 
it is more probable that it will--then the aggressive nature of 
this terrorist regime will be further revealed to those whose 
hearts are bent on making peace with it.

  [Text] United Nations, New York, April 19, IRNA -- Iran has 
reported 39 cases of ceasefire violations by Iraq from January 
2-31 to the United Nations. 
  Iran's permanent representative to the United Nations Kamal 
Kharrazi mentioned the cases in a letter to the U.N. Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali Monday. 
  Two cases of the violations have been carried out by the 
Iraqi-based counterrevolutionary agents. 
  The letter said that a group of counterrevolutionaries

and blocking the roads extorted money from passengers of 
vehicles passing through and then fled to Iraq. 
  Another group of counterrevolutionary elements entered the 
country in Ozgaleh region, in west of Iran, on January 18. Due 
to the vigilance of border police, they were forced to flee 
before carrying out any mission. 
  The other 37 cases are violations by Iraqi forces which 
include shooting and firing mortars towards Iranian border 
areas, infiltration into Iran, patrolling in the no man's land, 
building positions, engineering activities, digging canals and

  [Text] Tehran, April 16, IRNA -- Foreign Minister 'Ali 
Akbar Velayati said here today that international cooperation 
among developing countries in an age when different pressure 
levers are being used against them, could serve as a basis for 
expansion bilateral ties and cooperation. 
  Velayati, who made the remark in a meeting with visiting 
vice 
president of Sao Tome and Principe, Habib Travada, hailed Iran's 
ties with African countries as "excellent" and said the Islamic 
republic believes in "real independence" for all countries. 
  He announced Tehran's readiness to expand ties with African 
states and said African countries in view of their bitter 
experience in the past with certain Western countries, pay 
special attention to promotion of ties with independent world 
countries. 
  Travda in return said colonialist and Western countries make 
"mere promises" of commercial assistance to the black continent. 
  He said his government believed certain developing states 
could offer technological help to African countries. 
  Travda was pleased with his visit to Islamic Iran and said 
his country is keen on expanding and cementing ties with Iran. 
  The two sides also explored other areas of bilateral 
economic 
and commercial cooperation, especially in the fields of 
fisheries and culture. 
  The group of islands comprising Sao Tome and Prinicipe, have 
a total area of 964 square kms, and lie in the Gulf of Guinea 
off the southwest coast of Africa. 
  Sao Tome and Principe gained its independence from 
Portuguese 
colonial rule in 1975, and presently has a population of 120,000. 
  Iran established ties with the African country of Sao Tome 
in 
1993.

  [Excerpts] The pre-sermon speaker at the Tehran Friday 
prayers was Dr. Mohammad Javad Larijani, the Tehran Majles 
deputy, who began with congratulating the people on the occasion 
of the New Year and the Day of God, which is 1 April when the 
system of the Islamic Republic was first established. [passage 
omitted] 
  He said: Our legitimate Islamic government is the greatest 
gift and treasure bestowed on us by God Almighty and should 
therefore be cherished. Saying that a legitimate government can 
be harmed by a lack of trust from the people, Dr. Larijani 
stated: Just as the people crowd the polling booths, the 
people's presence on various occasions is a source of strength 
for the system. By the same token, if the people lose their 
trust in a legitimate system, that system is harmed. 
  He added: Currently our enemies are on the wrong path and 
have mobilized all their resources for propaganda. They are 
seeking to magnify our shortcomings and to undermine the 
confidence of the people in the officials and the system. 
  He mentioned that one of the ploys of the enemy was to 
magnify the country's debts, and added: In the middle of last 
year, suddenly extensive propaganda was initiated alleging that 
Iran could not repay its debts and had become insolvent. Some 
European countries to which a repayment of less than 3 billion 
marks was due began demanding their money, even though we had 
purchased goods worth more than 85 billion marks from the same 
countries immediately after the revolution. 
  He continued: The same European countries have not honored 
their commitments to Iran worth $1.5 billion. This propaganda 
regarding Iran's debts is not true. The Islamic Republic of 
Iran is certainly not bankrupt and is one of the strongest 
countries in the region today. 
  Dr. Larijani said: The enemy's propaganda is aimed at 
whipping up an atmosphere of diffidence among the people. 
Therefore, it is the obligation of the people to eliminate the 
conditions that foster such an atmosphere. 
  He then referred to the issues of high prices, 
discrimination, and corrupt practices that inspire mistrust 
among the people and called on officials to tackle these 
problems. On the subject of the price spiral, the Tehran Majles 
deputy stated: The issue of high prices should be viewed in the 
context of the relation between the general income of the people 
and the basket [sabad] of expenditure, which is an extremely 
important matter. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the 
system, the Majles, the government, and all the institutions to 
bring it to a reasonable level. 
  He added: The solution to high prices is for the government 
to create conditions conducive to production. He stressed: The 
people should be involved in important tasks. It is not correct 
for the government to produce and to keep prices at a low level 
artificially. Speaking of the Majles' efforts to reduce prices 
and inflation, the Tehran Majles deputy said: The deputies of 
our dear nation made extensive efforts this year to rein in 
inflation and to present a realistic budget with lower 
government expenditures, which resulted in considerable 
economizing. 
  He added: The deputies have prohibited any rise in gasoline 
prices for 1373 [year beginning 21 March 1994], which was an 
appropriate measure for this year. However, in general, it 
should not be the policy of the government to keep prices at a 
low level artificially. We spend $10 billion from the Treasury 
every year to keep gasoline prices at the current level. If 
this sum is used wisely, we can perform some other major task. 
I do not mean that gasoline prices should be raised tomorrow as 
we have to be sensitive to the basket of the people's essential 
expenditures. We should realize the effects of all price 
changes on the lives of the people. 
  Dr. Larijani emphasized: Regarding our long-term plans, we 
should, on principle, refrain from dipping into the Treasury 
merely to maintain prices at an artificially low level. The 
people will be able to procure their needs with a little effort 
unless prices are exorbitant. 
  He added: Cash is the lifeblood of a country's economy, and 
at times it is expedient that this blood should be thinner and 
at times it should be thicker. [passage omitted] 
  Thus, the remedy is not subsidies from the government. On 
the contrary, the government should release itself from such 
irrelevant matters and merely supervise and guide the people. 
This would encourage better management, which would receive 
support from the people, and there would be no avenues for 
exploitation by middlemen and tricksters who are adept in 
escaping the grip of the law. [passage omitted] 
  Larijani stressed that the use and popularization of 
indigenous products was important, saying: The use and 
publicity of foreign goods should be considered contrary to our 
values, as it is in some of the progressive countries. For 
example, in South Korea, which is one of the advanced countries 
of the world, it is very rare to use a foreign automobile and, 
in fact, there are no repair shops for servicing foreign 
vehicles. 
  The Tehran Majles deputy said: Our people should note that 
if we raise our production ourselves and make our country 
prosper, we will be able to cultivate similar qualities in 
ourselves. We should believe that we can resolve our problems 
and we should realize the value of our influence in the world. 
  He elaborated: We have not gained this influence in the 
world in an easy manner and we should not be negligent on this 
matter. When the PLO and Israel said that they were to settle 
their differences, we opposed these talks because they ignored 
the lawful rights of the oppressed Palestinian people. We were 
ridiculed and asked who were we to do so. However, the Muslim 
Palestinian nation also had something to say, which was exactly 
what we had proclaimed. The whole world had been mobilized to 
support these disgraceful talks, but the slogan of "God is 
great" and the nature of the Palestinian nation's actions proves 
the great influence of our nation and revolution. The fact that 
to this day the Palestinian nation has been able to resist the 
PLO-Israel plot is a great victory for us. 
  What country can counteract a political process that is 
supported by all the belligerents of the world? This is a great 
strength bestowed on us by the almighty, and perhaps we 
ourselves are unaware of this greatness. He continued: The 
strength that the Islamic Republic of Iran enjoys today is 
greater than the power of the bomb and missiles. 
  The head of the Foreign Policy Committee of the Islamic 
Majles then referred to relations between the Islamic Republic 
of Iran and the littoral countries of the Persian Gulf and the 
hajj issue, saying: The Saudi Government should not deprive 
itself of the honor of accepting our pilgrims who wish to 
perform hajj. 
  He said: Iranian pilgrims are jewels in their piety, 
conduct, and performance of the religious ceremonies. It is a 
source of shame for the Saudi Government to say that it will not 
accept a particular number. The Saudi Government should realize 
that the friendship of the Iranian Government and nation is the 
best base for it in the region. The friendship of the Persian 
Gulf countries with the Iranian Government and nation is in the 
best interests of these countries, as we do not covet their oil 
or seek to dominate them. The United States, on the other hand, 
does not have an interest in these governments except for 
dominating them and plundering their oil wealth. 
  He added: The United States is spreading the propaganda that 
it is a supporter of the Persian Gulf governments, especially of 
the Saudi Government. A few months ago, it was revealed that 
the U.S. ambassador in that country was seeking to plot against 
that government. To me it is as clear as day that the United 
States intends to change the Saudi and Kuwaiti Governments in 
the not so distant future. 
  Dr. Larijani said: We want the greatness of Islam and 
honorable and prestigious stances by Islamic countries. We want 
to sever the hands of foreigners from these countries so that 
the oil income of the Muslims is not pillaged. The sale of 
weapons to the Persian Gulf countries is a plot to plunder the 
wealth of the Islamic world, and I do not see any similar 
pillage in any other part of the world. You, Arab countries, can 
have no better friend than Iran. 
  He concluded: I hope that the Saudi officials perceive what 
a great base they have in their vicinity. They should try to 
elicit the affection of our people and our government, and this 
will be the best base for them in the world. He expressed the 
hope that the Iranian pilgrims who wish to perform hajj will be 
permitted to do so regardless of their number.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "One More Offer for Talks?"] </F>
  [Text] According to a special report by a JANG 
correspondent, India has invited Pakistan to hold talks at the 
prime minister level. According to the report, the Foreign 
Office received a proposal a few days ago that the next round of 
India-Pakistan talks be held at the prime minister level instead 
of at the foreign secretary level. Pakistan has welcomed this 
proposal conditionally and said that it is ready for the 
proposed dialogue provided the Kashmir issue is placed on the 
top of the agenda. However, available report indicates that 
India wishes to hold discussions only on the Siachen Glacier 
issue. At the same time, New Delhi has also suggested that 
Pakistan should not move any resolution on the Kashmir issue at 
the September session of the UN General Assembly. 
  Talking to the JANG, the Pakistan foreign secretary rightly 
said that our stand on India-Pakistan dialogue is crystal clear. 
We do not have any objection in principle to the talks, but 
India will have to fulfill four preconditions to create a 
conducive atmosphere for the dialogue. The preconditions are: 
India should reduce the number of troops deployed in Kashmir, 
dismantle all the bunkers built by the Indian forces around the 
Hazratbal Shrine, release all the detained Kashmiri leaders, and 
allow the representatives of the international human rights 
organizations to visit occupied Kashmir. The conditions set by 
Pakistan are very appropriate and practicable and any high-level 
dialogue will be useless if these conditions are not met. 
  In the past, Pakistan accepted many Indian proposals and 
held 
negotiations in a spirit of goodwill, but, as everybody knows, 
all those rounds of discussions remained fruitless solely 
because of India's refusal to create even the slightest 
flexibility in its stand on the Kashmir question. Six rounds of 
foreign minister-level talks were held on the Kashmir issue in 
1962. At that time, India agreed to enter into negotiations on 
Kashmir because it was facing enormous pressure due to its 
border war with China and all the Western countries had also 
asked Pakistan not to create more difficulties for India, which, 
as a quid pro quo, would hold talks with Islamabad to resolve 
the Kashmir dispute. The eyes of the entire Western world were 
set on the rounds of discussions that were being held between 
Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Sardar Swaran Singh, and there was 
pressure on India to make those talks successful and meaningful. 
Even then, India could not adopt the path of justice and 
propriety. Seven more rounds of foreign secretary-level talks 
have been held in the recent past, but all of them have been 
meaningless. After the three-day talks in January 1994, India 
invited Pakistan to hold another round of dialogue, but Pakistan 
had made it clear that, in spite of being a principled supporter 
of negotiations, it could not go on holding fruitless 
discussions. 
  The Foreign Office has thus far not confirmed the receipt of 
any official invitation from India for the prime minister-level 
talks, but if India is really interested in negotiations, then 
it must, first of all, agree to place the Kashmir issue on the 
top of the agenda of such talks. It must also accept the four 
preconditions set by Pakistan to create a congenial atmosphere 
for the talks, because it is not possible for Pakistan to sit 
around a negotiating table with India while New Delhi continues 
its oppression and atrocities against the Kashmiris. India will 
have to give some proof that it is sincere in holding talks and 
is ready to adopt the path of justice. If the Government of 
Pakistan receives any formal invitation from India for a 
dialogue at any level, then it should remain steadfast on the 
aforementioned preconditions and should not engage itself in 
negotiations that are not going to yield any positive results. 
Likewise, Pakistan should also not give any assurances that it 
will not move any resolution on the Kashmir issue at the next UN 
General Assembly session. India's behavior in the past has not 
left any room for any wishful thinking on our part and we should 
not follow a shadow by continuing the process of fruitless 
negotiations.

  [Text] Islamabad -- Despite a clear-cut Government of 
Pakistan policy to control spill over of Afghan refugees in the 
Federal Capital, refugee population here continues to be on the 
rise. 
  While there is not even a single Afghan refugee formally 
registered in Islamabad, over 30,000 Afghans are estimated to 
have moved into the capital city in the last six months alone. 
  Officials in the Interior Ministry believe that at least 
half 
of the refugees who have moved to Pakistan in the past six 
months are now residing in Islamabad. According to one estimate 
over 60,000 crossed over to Pakistan in the last six months. 
  As a matter of rule new Afghan refugees coming to Pakistan 
are not supposed to go beyond Attack, the Punjabi border town 
next to the NWFP [North-west Frontier Province]. They are 
required to get themselves registered at Commissionerate for 
refugees in Peshawar or at the Commissionerate office in Quetta. 
  To discourage the Afghans from coming to and settling in 
Islamabad, the government has apparently also instructed the 
United Nation's High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) not to 
provide any financial assistance to the new refugee population 
through its offices here. 
  But even this has not stopped the inflow of refugees who 
continue to pour in the Federal Capital. 
  These refugees, mostly Kabulites, are literate and 
well-to-do 
compared to those who fled to Pakistan in the early years of the 
Afghan war. Their resources, however, are limited. After 
exhausting the little finances they have, most turn to the UNHCR 
office here for assistance. 
  At the palatial UNHCR office on the Margalla Road the 
refugees are greeted by a blue notice board put on the wall 
outside. It says: "Notice To All Afghan Refugees. This office 
does not provide financial assistance or resettlement services 
to Afghan refugees." 
  Those who are desperate for help, ignore this notice. They 
plead their case with the man at the main gate who invariably 
directs them to the Chief Commissionerate for Afghan Refugees 
(CCAR) here. He hands them small chits which have the CCAR 
address printed on them. 
  From the CCAR refugees are again turned away without help 
since it is only a policy-making office. 
  Officials at the CCAR maintain that they have categorically 
conveyed it to the UNHCR several times that they are not there 
to assist refugees. Despite repeated messages, these officials 
say, the UNHCR continues to "misdirect" the refugees. 
  When contacted the UNHCR spokesman here told this 
correspondent that the office in Islamabad did not give 
financial or material assistance. This, he said, was in 
compliance with the Pakistan Government's policy. However, he 
added, that the Commission helped the refugees in other ways. 
  "We have a Social Service Section that attends to their 
security needs and also provides medical and legal aid to them," 
the spokesman said. 
  Meanwhile, an average three to four Afghans continue to show 
up at the CCAR in Islamabad. 
  "We want help, protection, and assistance," is usually what 
they have to say. "There are days when even a couple dozen turn 
up," notes an official. "The most striking aspect about them is 
that almost all are sophisticated urbanites, men and women, 
holding professional degrees," he adds. 
  These Afghans are concentrated in the rather thickly 
populated G and I sectors, where accommodation is available at 
relatively lower rents. Numerous apartments and flats in G-8 
Markaz, G-9 and G-10 have been taken by the Afghan urbanites, 
many of whom share them with their relatives and friends. Most 
new entrants have also rented out portions in sectors I-8, I-9 
and I-10. 
  In fact many real estate dealers in Islamabad attribute the 
current level of rents in these areas to the large presence of 
Afghans. "There has been a growing demand for flats and 
portions in the G and I sectors by the Afghans specially in the 
last six months," says a property dealer in G-8 Markaz. 
  Only recently the Federal Interior Minister also noted at a 
televised interview by journalists that house rents had gone up 
because of the Afghan refugees, which he believed was a good 
sign. 
  Like most parts of the G-9 and G-10 Markazes, these refugees 
virtually throng the three weekly bazaars -- Mangal [Tuesday], 
Itwaar [Sunday] and Juma [Friday] -- in G-8 Sector. It is there 
that one actually realises what a large number of Afghans dwell 
in the capital city. Buyers as well as sellers, they dominate 
the scene.

  [Text] Islamabad -- Pakistan on Monday warned the Arab 
nationals, who fought in the Afghan war and are now living in 
NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] to immediately leave the 
country or face severe action. 
  The government has sent a letter to all such organisations 
to 
make sure that all Arabs leave by April 18. Those staying here 
after April 18 May be arrested and the organisations still 
employing them may face punitive action. A govt official said 
about 120 such Arab nationals were still in NWFP, about 80 to 70 
in Peshawar. Most of them are from Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia 
and Tunisia. 
  He said those with valid papers had already been allowed to 
stay, but other would have to go. "We can't allow them to use 
Pakistani territory for carrying out terrorist acts against 
other nations," the official said.

  [Text] Pakistan has appealed for an emergency session of 
the UN Security Council [UNSC] to consider the situation as a 
result of the Serb attack on the besieged Muslim town of Gorazde 
in Bosnia. An official press statement issued in Islamabad says 
that, through Pakistani efforts, a group of nonaligned countries 
have presented a draft resolution in the UN Security Council 
demanding the withdrawal of Serb forces from Gorazde. The draft 
resolution calls upon the UN protection force to use all 
available means, including the use of force, to foil the Serb 
aggression against Gorazde. Pakistan hopes that the members of 
the UN Security Council will discharge their obligation to save 
the people of Goradze from the aggression. They should take 
urgent and concrete steps for the security of the population of 
Gorazde and other UN-protected areas. Pakistan has especially 
appealed to the North Atlantic Council [three preceding words in 
English] to immediately order air action against the Serbs. The 
statement says the government and people of Pakistan are deeply 
anguished by the brutal action and aggression by Serb forces 
against the Muslims of Gorazde.

  [Text] Tunis, 19 Apr (MENA)--Palestinian leader Yasir 
'Arafat has expressed his belief that the current round of 
Palestinian-Israeli talks in Cairo will produce an agreement 
between Israel and the PLO toward the end of this week on the 
transfer of authority to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho, in accordance with the Declaration of Principles signed 
by the two sides in Washington. 
  In statements to the Tunisian newspaper AL-RA'I AL-'AMM 
published today, 'Arafat said that the obstacles and hindrances 
that the Israeli Government created for the implementation of 
the Declaration of Principles over the past few months is due to 
its desire to spoil the joy of the Palestinians as they return 
to a part of their homeland which has been under occupation for 
over a quarter of a century. 
  Despite all its procrastination, Yitzhaq Rabin's government 
is unable to face the consequences of failing to implement the 
Oslo agreement, 'Arafat stated. 
  There are four extremist groups [tanzimat mutatarrifah] 
within the Israeli military who are doing everything they can to 
obstruct the implementation of the Declaration of Principles. 
These groups see the Declaration of Principles as being against 
their interests, 'Arafat said. 
  'Arafat said that hectic preparations are under way to bring 
thousands of Palestinian fighters from Tunisia, Yemen, and Sudan 
to Gaza and Jericho. He added that schools, hospitals, and 
other public facilities will be built in Jericho which has 
insufficient supply of such services due to its sparse 
population. 
  'Arafat said that 1,300 Palestinian families are expected to 
arrive in Jericho in the next four months.

  [Text] Cairo, 19 Apr (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has 
described ties between Egypt and China as "historic ones" and 
noted that Egypt was the first Arab and African country to 
recognize the People's Republic of China. 
  In an interview with a Chinese media delegation that 
represented Chinese media organs, President Mubarak said that 
recent international developments in the Middle East and in east 
Asia stress the importance of consultations between Egypt and 
China to have an objective assessment of these developments and 
of searching for fair solutions acceptable to all parties in 
order to enhance world peace and security. 
  President Mubarak stressed that Egyptian-Chinese relations 
are so unique as to distinguish them from bilateral relations 
with a number of other friendly countries, explaining that the 
two countries' cooperation covers many fields of joint activity 
in the economic, cultural, scientific, and other spheres. He 
expressed hope that economic cooperation and trade exchange will 
rise to a still better level. 
  He said that the great leap made by the Chinese economy and 
the important achievement of the Egyptian economy will open 
broad scope and horizons for expanding trade between the two 
countries and for increasing their share in world trade to the 
benefit of the two fraternal peoples. 
  President Mubarak went on to say in the interview that the 
achievement of stability in Egypt and the Middle East creates 
the right climate for giving impetus to the economic growth 
cycle and the attraction of investments. He stressed that Egypt 
has succeeded, through a gradual process, in restoring a large 
part of the Egyptian economy's activities, vitality, and ability 
to produce, export, and create job opportunities for thousands 
of young people. He added: The problems are not over yet but 
the diagnosis was accurate and the treatment was not sudden. 
Signs of health and strength have started to reappear in 
Egypt's economy in the fields of industry, agriculture, and 
reconstruction, and in the improvement in the level of services. 
  President Mubarak explained that Egypt's policy follows an 
active diplomacy with the majority of African countries at the 
political, economic and cultural levels and the exchange of 
visits and delegations. He added that he is following the 
development of this policy with great interest. He said: We 
are contributing, with other countries and international 
organizations, to the search for solutions to problems that 
might appear from time to time in order to achieve security and 
stability in the continent where most peoples are living. 
  President Mubarak stressed that Egypt has firmly abided by 
the strategy of peace based on justice in order to fulfill the 
hopes of the region's peoples after a 50-year-long conflict. He 
said that this strategy began with the historic peace initiative 
of 1977 that aimed to put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict 
and open the door to peaceful coexistence between the 
Palestinians and Israelis. 
  He added that Egypt's policy has pursued this course that 
advocates negotiations and dialogue within the framework of 
legitimacy and the principles of justice and international law 
until it saw its persistent efforts crowned with success at the 
end of 1991, when the peace conference was held in Madrid to 
implement Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the 
principle of land in return for peace. He said that he regards 
the Madrid conference as a historic turning point in the peace 
process and in starting direct negotiations between all the 
Israeli, Arab, and Palestinian parties. 
  He stressed that the Palestinian-Israeli agreement in the 
form of the Declaration of Principles last September was another 
important landmark that brought everybody to the verge of 
reaching a peaceful and acceptable settlement that places the 
Palestinian issue at the threshold of a new era where self-rule 
will be achieved and of transitional measures in preparation for 
the negotiations on the final status of the occupied territories. 
  He said that equally important and serious negotiations have 
been held on the Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian tracks with 
Israel and that this shows that everyone is convinced that 
dialogue and mutual consent and acceptance are the best way to 
reach an agreement. He added: Another important process also 
began in parallel with these negotiations, namely the 
multilateral negotiations on regional cooperation that involves 
the parties to the conflict and other countries, including 
China. These talks cover issues of economic development, 
environment, water, disarmament, and refugees. 
  He noted that all these are important fields to which the 
parties and other world countries concerned with the region's 
stability are paying attention in the hope of attaining security 
and stability and thus bringing about benefits to all the 
peoples of the Middle East and the world. 
  President Mubarak went on to say that Egypt's role, which 
the 
political leadership plans and the diplomatic branch implements, 
has not stopped since the start of the Madrid conference. It 
even started a long time before then because of Egypt's ties 
with all regional and international parties to the conflict. He 
added that Egypt has open channels of communication with all 
these leaders and constantly receives their leaders and 
representatives in order to narrow the gap of differences and 
bring views closer. 
  He said: Within this context, Egypt has received most of the 
leaders concerned with the conflict who are participating in the 
peace process. Talks have also been held in Cairo between the 
Israeli and Palestinian sides, and the Egyptian capital has been 
visited by U.S., European, and other delegations to give impetus 
to the peace process and to reach tangible results as early as 
possible that will put an end to the cycle of violence and 
counter violence, expand the circle of support for peace and 
coexistence in the Middle East, and achieve a dignified and 
secure life for everyone. He stressed that the achievement of 
peace in the Middle East will ultimately be a great historic 
contribution to the establishment of peace and stability in the 
whole world.

<F P=106> [Report on address by Assembly speaker Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Aziz </F>
al-Sa'dun at the National Assembly in Kuwait on 19 
April--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] The National Assembly, chaired by its speaker 
Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Sa'dun, held its regular session this 
morning. The assembly meeting opened with an address by the 
speaker in which he discussed claims by the president of the 
so-called Iraqi National Assembly that the Baghdad regime is not 
holding any Kuwaiti prisoners, hostages or others, and his 
invitation to a delegation from Kuwait's National Assembly to 
visit Iraq to verify this. The following is a recording of the 
speaker's address: 
  [Al-Sa'dun] To begin with, this is not the first time an 
Iraqi official has made such statements; they have said this on 
many occasions. Similar statements were made by the foreign 
minister and other officials. We did not take any notice of 
them and did not try to respond to them because we felt that 
they did not deserve answering. However, the statement made 
this time by the speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly, 
inviting members of the Kuwaiti National Assembly to discuss 
some issues, as he put it, to serve what he described as the 
pan-Arab cause, the interests of both sides, in order to achieve 
stability and put an end to [word indistinct], compels us to 
respond. 
  What also makes us respond to this statement is his belief 
-- 
as came across clearly in the text of his interview with the INA 
- that statements of this kind made by various officials have 
been concealed from the Kuwaiti Parliament by the Kuwaiti 
Government. Because of this, it is necessary to let the speaker 
of the Iraqi National Assemby and the Iraqi regime know the 
truth of the position of the Kuwaiti people, all the Kuwaiti 
people -- government, people, and parliament. 
  The position of the Kuwaiti people was not taken today, but 
during the darkest of circumstances. It was taken when Kuwait 
was occupied, when there were disputes. Yes, let him hear, 
there were disputes between us on how to handle matters, but 
there were no differences on two issues; on the liberation of 
Kuwait when it was occupied and who should govern Kuwait. Let 
him know that clearly. [passage omitted] 
  The stance of the Kuwaiti people toward the Iraqi regime, 
its 
occupation, and its practices was clear. Despite all that the 
Kuwaiti people faced then, not only at the hands of the Iraqi 
regime and its army but also at the hands of some of the people 
[as heard], our people managed to rise above all their wounds. 
Our people managed then, at a people's conference held under 
the patronage of his highness the amir and the chairmanship of 
his highness the heir apparent, at which representatives of all 
sections of Kuwaiti society were present -- our people managed 
at that conference to rise above all their wounds and adopt, 
with a clearly defined stance, Resolution 15 [words indistinct] 
which while condemning the practices of the Iraqi regime made it 
clear that the Kuwaiti people do not harbor any malice or grudge 
against the Iraqi people. Indeed, we said in Resolution 15 that 
part of the suffering faced by the Iraqi people or even all the 
suffering faced by the Iraqi people was caused by the Iraqi 
regime itself. 
  It is astonishing to hear what the Iraqi regime, or the 
speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly, had to say when he 
invited a delegation from the Kuwaiti National Assembly to hold 
talks without involving the Kuwaiti Government, as if there were 
a government on one side and a National Assembly on the other. 
We may have our differences but in the face of these matters we 
are one side: the government, the National Assembly, and the 
system of government in Kuwait all stand on the same side. This 
is what we said then. [applause] [passage omitted] 
  What does he want from such a meeting? His objective -- as 
he said openly --is to enable a delegation from the Kuwaiti 
National Assembly, whom they would invite, to acquaint 
themselves with all the facts that prove that they have no 
Kuwaiti prisoners. The result is already known, as far as he 
[as heard] is concerned: There are no prisoners. This is also 
aimed at helping the Iraqis to achieve their goals in their 
attempts to mislead the international community when they ask 
for a lifting of the blockade, arguing that they have responded 
to all the resolutions of the international community. 
  We challenge -- I personally challenge -- the chairman of 
the Iraqi National Assembly to present to the international 
community evidence that Iraq has responded and accepted 
commitment to all the resolutions of the international 
community. Perhaps continuous pressure from the international 
community would make Iraq submit now. As a result of pressure 
it has indeed submitted to all that concerns the search for 
weapons. It has responded and carried out articles [words 
indistinct] and responded and implemented article [word 
indistinct]. But talk about [words indistinct], who is to blame 
for this? It is the Iraqi regime itself that is to blame, 
because, first, the boycott resolutions did not cover food or 
medicine; second, in addition to all [words indistinct] the 
international community allowed the Iraqi regime to export some 
of its oil so long as it does not exceed [words indistinct]. 
For this reason, Mr. Speaker [as heard], I [word indistinct] 
for these calls and illusions of the Iraqi regime or the 
chairman of the so-called Iraqi National Assembly not to 
continue. We say it here: the Iraqi regime cannot but [words 
indistinct] the problem of prisoners, and particularly Articles 
30 and 31 of Resolution [?687], and especially also the 
implementation of Resolution [word indistinct]. It cannot but 
accept, respect, hand over the prisoners, and not just the 
prisoners, not just the hostages. We are always talking about 
the prisoners and hostages, but [words indistinct]. The 
international resolution speaks about handing over the 
prisoners, the hostages, or the bodies, if any, and also [words 
indistinct]. The remains of the dead and martyrs are of no less 
interest to us than the prisoners themselves. 
  The Iraqi regime, if it really wanted to return to the fold 
of the international community... [pauses] The international 
community did not impose sanctions for nothing. The 
international community imposed sanctions on the Iraqi regime 
for a reason. This reason is the existing aggression, the 
aggression against Kuwait, Iraq's holding of POW's, and its lack 
of respect for international resolutions. Accordingly, if the 
Iraqi regime really wants to lift what it calls the suffering of 
the Iraqi people, it must abide by these resolutions because it 
is the Iraqi regime itself that is responsible for the plight of 
the Iraqi people. 
  Mr. President [as heard], as I said, many statements were 
issued by officials on various occasions which did not make us 
respond to them. To remove any false impressions, however, to 
ensure that such invitations are not repeated, and to make it 
clear to the so-called speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly, 
we tell him that all the invitations have reached us and we have 
listened to them. Despite all this, they have been rejected. 
So that they may not continue misleading the international 
community by saying that invitations have been concealed from 
the Kuwaiti Parliament, we tell him that the invitation has been 
heard and now we want you to hear the Kuwaiti people's rejection 
of this offer. 
  The Iraqi regime has no choice in the POW issue -- and we 
challenge the speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly to deny 
that the POW's are there -- but to abide by Resolution 187 [as 
heard] and to allow international organizations, particularly 
the International Committee of the Red Cross, to have access to 
the POW's instead of inviting a Kuwaiti National Assembly or 
joint Arab delegation. [passage omitted] 
  We challenge the Iraqi regime respond to these files. We 
challenge it to tell us whether each one of these POW's is 
present or missing. Official Iraqi documents were given to the 
Iraqi regime during the days of the occupation of Kuwait giving 
indications on where each prisoner had been taken from, what 
camp he had been put in in Kuwait, and what camp he had been 
transferred to in Iraq. Furthermore, the regime were also given 
documents on where each one of them had been seen for the last 
time. 
  Therefore, the invitation made by the speaker of the 
so-called Iraqi National Assembly is rejected. I suggest to the 
brothers in the national assembly, for things to be clear, to 
ask the brothers in the Foreign Ministry to prepare a clear 
statement on the National Assembly stance which ultimately 
represents that of the Kuwaiti people and everybody in Kuwait: 
government, people, and system vis-a-vis this issue. Thank you 
brother president. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' today received Derek 
William Auret, head of the Africa and Middle East Desk at the 
South African Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  During the meeting, the foreign minister received a message 
to President Hafiz al-Asad from South African President Frederik 
de Klerk. The foreign minister also received another message 
from Mr. (Korreth), head of the judiciary council in South 
Africa [title as heard], in which he invites President Hafiz 
al-Asad to take part in the celebration scheduled to be held on 
10 May 1994 to inaugurate the new South African president. 
  The talks dealt with developments in South Africa after the 
abrogation of the apartheid system and the racial segregation 
laws, and the establishment of a democratic system guaranteeing 
equality for all citizens in accordance with the new 
constitution. The talks also dealt with the Arab-Israeli 
conflict and developments in the peace process. In this regard, 
the two sides' viewpoints were in agreement on achieving a just 
and comprehensive peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict 
based on the implementation of the relevant UN Security Council 
resolutions, and on Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Syrian 
Golan, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and southern Lebanon. 
  Auret said a peaceful solution can be achieved through the 
continuation of the peace talks, and not through acts of 
violence, deportation, and the Israeli authorities' demolishing 
of Palestinian houses in the occupied territories. He stressed 
that the stands of South Africa will be balanced, and that 
henceforth, its old relations with Israel will not be at the 
expense of its new relations with the Arabs. 
  The talks during the meeting also dealt with the future 
prospects of the relations between Syria and South Africa after 
the abrogation of apartheid, and in light of lifting the Arab 
and international embargo on dealing with South Africa. 
  The foreign minister and Mr. Auret expressed their mutual 
concern about establishing good relations between the two 
countries in the political, economic, trade, tourist, and other 
fields. Within this framework, the two sides agreed to resume 
contacts between the two countries until diplomatic relations 
between them are established. 
  Attending the meeting were Raslan 'Allush, assistant to the 
foreign minister, Dr. Hani Habib, director of the Economic 
Department, and Mustafa al-Hajj 'Ali, director of the Africa 
Department at the Foreign Ministry.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>
  [Text] The prime minister's candor in today's session of 
the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee was 
surprising, at least in view of the fact that merely two days 
ago, Rabin was furious at the disclosure of the very existence 
of the General Staff working papers on the Israeli-Syrian 
negotiations. 
  Senior political and military elements told us today: Rabin 
has just confirmed what everybody has known for some time: He 
and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres have accepted the concept of 
a full IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights, including the evacuation of all the settlements. The 
ideal line suggested in the IDF treatise on partial withdrawal 
lies 5 to 8 km away from the mountain ridge line -- the line 
from which the Lake of Tiberias and the Hula Valley can be 
observed. Today Rabin said: I am ready to move west of there 
-- namely, up to the ridge line itself in the first stage and 
probably completely off the Golan Heights in the second stage. 
  Hence, the haggling with the Syrians will be over other 
issues: security arrangements, the manning of the Golan Heights 
early warning stations, and the gradual nature of withdrawal. 
As for acreage, the die has been cast. 
  [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew at 
1700 GMT on 19 April, in a report by political correspondent 
Gadi Sukenik, adds: "There is doubt in Jerusalem that progress 
with Syria is feasible" at this time, because "at this stage, 
Peres and Rabin are not enthusiastic about either a U.S. visit 
or any meaningful progress with Syria. At this stage, they 
would prefer to postpone it until the IDF completes its 
withdrawal, or rather, to turn to the Syrian track only after 
the first stage of the Israel-PLO agreement is implemented." 
Sukenik adds: "Almost every element involved in this issue 
believes that when the process gets down to brass tacks, there 
will be talk of full peace and full, or almost full, withdrawal 
from the Golan."]

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin today told the Knesset 
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that he is ready for a 
greater withdrawal on the Golan than that recommended by the 
IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] General Staff. The prime 
minister's statement was made in reply to a question from 
Knesset Member [MK] Beni Begin. 
  Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the prime 
minister 
stressed that the working paper he received from Major General 
Ilan Biran did not refer to a total IDF withdrawal from the 
Golan. 
  Also at today's Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Committee 
session, Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, 
said the regular troops are in a difficult situation, because 
all the men are tied up in operational activity in Judaea, 
Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. Rabin noted that instead of the 
planned six months of training, the regular troops were barely 
receiving three months, and if the situation continues, the 
level of preparedness will be affected. The prime minister 
added that there are many friction-prone sites in Hebron, which 
are liable to lead to a conflagration. For that reason, the best 
units are tied up in that location. 
  [A related report by Tamar Asalem on Tel Aviv IDF Radio in 
Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 19 April adds: "The prime minister said 
that Jordan may not attend the Washington talks because of the 
naval blockade imposed by the United States on al-'Aqabah. He 
believes, however, that an agreement with Jordan will be 
possible only after one is achieved with Syria. 
  ["Discussing the Syrian issue, the prime minister stated 
that 
there is a principle of international presence on the Golan, but 
he did not specify the nature of the presence. The prime 
minister added that all decisions would be made by the political 
echelons, and all publicized documents merely represent the 
process of data gathering and preparatory work. 
  ["MK Beni Begin told the prime minister that he understood 
that the General Staff recommendations specified a smaller 
withdrawal area than Rabin found acceptable. Rabin's simple 
reply: Yes. There is no argument that in the military sense, 
the present line is better than any line lying farther to the 
west, but our work is based on a certain political reality."]

  [Text] Tehran, April 20, IRNA -- Leader of the Islamic 
Revolution Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i on Wednesday [20 April] in 
an unprecedentedly harsh tone attacked the United Nations and 
its secretary general for their "hideous record" in connection 
with Gorazde. 
  The supreme leader condemned the U.N. and its secretary 
general Butrus Butrus-Ghali for helping the Serbs in massacring 
the defenceless people of Gorazde. 
  "The United Nations has had the worst and ugliest 
performance 
in this test and the secretary-general who is at the helm of the 
U.N. establishments has set the worst precedence for himself 
among Muslims," Ayatollah Khamene'i said. 
  The leader of the Islamic revolution was speaking to 
officials in charge of hajj pilgrimage. 
  "The issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina is so heart-rending that no 
words can describe the magnitude of this catastrophe," Ayatollah 
Khamene'i said. 
  He also lashed out at leaders of arrogant powers for their 
collaboration with the Serbs in victimizing Bosnian Muslims. 
  "Today, the mouthpieces of arrogant powers have been forced 
to admit that Bosnian Muslims are denied any help just because 
they are Muslims... This shows that the disgraceful dictatorial 
system prevailing in the world cannot tolerate to see a Muslim 
country established in the heart of Europe," he said. 
  Ayatollah Khamene'i said that while Serbs have taken 
possession of all weapons and military facilities of the former 
Yugoslav government, the U.N. is preventing Bosnian Muslims from 
getting arms in order to protect themselves under pretext of an 
arms embargo against both sides. 
  The leader of the Islamic revolution said that the United 
Nations, while opposing the despatch of peacekeeping forces to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina by Muslim states, has commissioned its forces 
to assist the Serbs. 
  Ayatollah Khamene'i instructed all committed members of the 
Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps (IRGC), army and basij 
(volunteer forces) to prepare to fulfil their duties as soon as 
obstacles are removed. 
  The leader also called on Iran's Red Crescent Society to 
escalate its efforts to supply the besieged people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with food supplies and other basic goods. 
  Elsewhere in his speech, Ayatollah Khamene'i said the annual 
hajj pilgrimage is the most suitable means of voicing support 
for the Muslims of the world, particularly Bosnian Muslims and 
for delivering from the pagans and criminals. 
  "Deliverance from pagans is the spirit of the hajj and means 
a huge crowd of Muslims who cry out against the savagest enemies 
of humanity and their supporters... Therefore, the presence of 
Muslims in the hajj rituals should be meaningful and 
purposeful," the supreme leader made it clear. 
  "The objective of the large gathering of Muslims in a holy 
site and at a given date is to arouse a feeling of unity and 
grandeur among each and every Muslim and to make decision on the 
fate of the Islamic Ummah (nation)," he said. 
  "Under the present conditions in today's world, Muslims 
should show in one way or the other their interest in the 
matters of expedience relating to the Muslim world and should 
express antipathy towards the enemies of Islam," Ayatollah 
Khamene'i pointed out. 
  The leader, saying the huge assembly of Muslims in the hajj 
has clear objectives and lofty political concepts, noted "Those 
somehow involved in the hajj pilgrimage must not make a 
compromise on this divine ritual for political considerations."

  [Excerpts] The director general of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA], Mr. Hans Blix, at a meeting with the First 
Vice-President, Mr. Hasan Habibi, yesterday, referring to the 
reports of the IAEA teams dispatched to inspect the nuclear 
centers of the Islamic Republic of Iran [IRI] said: The study 
and investigation of the Agency's experts indicate peaceful use 
of atomic energy by Iran; and keeping the region free from 
nuclear weapons will be in the interest of establishing peace 
and tranquillity in the region. 
  Mr. Habibi, agreeing with the remarks made by Mr. Blix, 
described global arrogance as the agent responsible for tension 
all over the world and in the region; and added: Tragedies 
observed in Africa, in the Middle East, the occupied territories 
of Palestine and Bosnia are clear examples of this created 
tension. Mr. Habibi stressed the need for even-handed 
implementation of international regulations in the entire region 
and said: The fact that some governments are, without 
justification, subjected to pressure of biased propaganda from 
every direction, while some others, including the occupiers of 
territories, are exempt from any inspection just because they 
enjoy the support of major and arrogant states, is contrary to 
logic and law and against moves towards peace and tranquillity. 
  The first vice-president went on: The IRI Government is 
strongly opposed to procurement and application of any 
destructive weapons by whatever state; and it believes that the 
propaganda against Iran is waged to deprive it from peaceful 
utilization of atomic energy and to prevent Iran's socioeconomic 
development. [passage omitted] 
  In an interview with our correspondent today, Mr. Blix 
termed 
the outcome of his talks with the Iranian officials as fruitful. 
Referring to the IRI's constructive cooperation with the IAEA, 
he said: So far the IAEA rapporteurs have inspected Iran's 
atomic installations on several occasions; and close cooperation 
of the Iranian officials with this Agency's representatives have 
been positive. 
  Referring to the attitude of the IAEA towards Israel, which 
is one of the largest producers of nuclear weapons in the 
region, the head of the IAEA said: So far, Israel has not agreed 
to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. However, we are 
studying ways to gain information about Israel's nuclear 
installations and facilities. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- 
recorded, in English with superimposed German translation] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] In view of the 
great poverty in your country and the poor economic situation, 
it is difficult to understand why you spend so much money on 
your army. Could you please explain this. Do you perhaps feel 
threatened by India? 
  [Bhutto] We don't like to spend so much money on our army, 
but because of the threat by India we are forced to do so. 
Germany was very lucky in the sense that its defense was taken 
on by others and it could therefore tackle social and economic 
needs. But up to now we have had to survive three wars, and in 
1971 Pakistan was split in two, into Bangladesh and Pakistan. 
It is therefore very important for us to protect our 
territorial integrity. That's why we spend so much money on our 
defense. 
  India has incidentally just raised its defence budget by 20 
percent, and that exerts great pressure on a country such as 
Pakistan. We have therefore proposed many times that the 
outstanding contentious issues between India and Pakistan should 
finally be settled. The most important conflict is the conflict 
over Kashmir. This is what led to the wars between our two 
countries, and if this dispute is resolved, then both India and 
Pakistan can turn to the more productive uses of their resources. 
  [Correspondent] Is there a dialogue between India and 
Pakistan about the Kashmiri conflict at the moment? Can we 
expect a solution soon? 
  [Bhutto] Well, we would like to have a political dialogue 
and 
solve the dispute over Kashmir. We have tried to start a 
dialogue, but as in the case of my predecessors, I have 
unfortunately not succeeded either. When I became prime 
minister the two countries, India and Pakistan, had not talked 
to each other for 18 months and I said, my God, that's an 
incredibly long time. We agreed to conduct talks at foreign 
minister level. I told the foreign ministers, let's not waste 
the opportunity for dialogue, we must end what is going on in 
Kashmir tomorrow. But we were greatly disappointed. Instead of 
the murders ending within 48 hours, 50 people were killed in 
Sopor and even more in Kupwara. We were forced to break off the 
talks because of those murders. But we made it clear to India 
that we are prepared for negotiations again as soon as they take 
measures against the oppression. 
  But we cannot talk just for the same of talking, especially 
not when people are murdered and women are raped. That is the 
worst thing about war. I don't know if it was always the case, 
but now in Bosnia and in Kashmir, we've seen that rape is being 
used as a weapon by the forces of occupation, and that's a 
double crime, a crime not only of aggression, but a crime 
against women too. 
  [Correspondent] Do you need nuclear weapons against India, 
since you obviously have these weapons and this is something 
which is strongly criticized here in the West? 
  [Bhutto] Pakistan has not detonated its nuclear weapons, and 
I believe that people respect Pakistan for this restraint, in 
spite of the fact that we have had three wars with India and 
India itself has detonated nuclear weapons. Pakistan has 
exercised restraint, but we have the technology, and if we 
wanted to we could detonate an atomic weapon. But because we 
back the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and because we are 
not in favor of a nuclear arms race on our subcontinent, we have 
exercised restraint. 
  However, at the same time we cannot pursue a policy of 
unilateral disarmament. We are afraid that India could attack 
us and that we would have no deterrent. After all, India is 
five times as large as we are, as are its army and defense 
expenditure. We have proposed regional talks on the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, but India has refused. We 
have proposed negotiations about our weapons, but India refused 
to accept this as well, and the message I should like to send 
out to the world is that Pakistan is a sensible and responsible 
actor on the world stage, a country which has not detonated its 
nuclear weapons, despite provocation. The world community must 
bring pressure on India to have a meaningful dialogue on 
Kashmir, on nonproliferation and on missiles. 
  [Correspondent] You know that Western investors fear nothing 
more than political instability. What can you promise these 
investors? Is your country so stable that investors have 
nothing to be afraid of? 
  [Bhutto] They don't need to be afraid. Pakistan is a stable 
society. We have a consensus that foreign capital can flow back 
into the country and that companies can indeed be fully owned by 
foreigners. But what has created most confidence in Pakistan's 
industry is our state management, and the fact that we have 
reduced the budget deficit. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Iraqi Opposition Detects </F>
Military Deployments Around Capital With Intensification of 
Sweeps"] 
  [Text] Damascus, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Iraqi 
opposition sources have said that the regime in Baghdad is 
intensifying arrest and sweep campaigns in the capital in a 
calculated escalation in reply to the recent series of 
booby-trapped cart explosions in Baghdad. Opposition sources 
saw military deployments encircling Baghdad and search convoys 
deployed at the capital's approaches and exits in anticipation 
of an explosion in the situation after the escalation of 
operations against the government. 
  In a statement, a copy of which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has 
received, Dr. Hamid al-Bayyati, representative of the "Supreme 
Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq" [SAIRI] in London, 
said: "Arrest campaigns have been stepped up in Baghdad. Our 
sources inside Iraq confirm the continuation of the arrest and 
sweep campaigns launched by the repressive organs. Arrest 
operations have been intensified since the booby-trapped car 
explosions which the capital witnessed recently." 
  The statement issued by the SAIRI support office in London 
said that "most arrest operations centered in Baghdad's new 
areas, al-Hubaybiyah, and the fringes of al-Thawrah, where more 
than 50 people opposed to the regime have been arrested in 
Baghdad al-Jadidah alone. As for al-Thawrah and al-Fudayliyah 
areas, forces of the Republican Guard and special security, 
headed by 'Udayy, Qusayy, and Saddam Kamil [as published], 
encircled them, searching homes and confiscating the personal 
property of families accused of collaborating with the 
opposition, that is, after attacking and harming them by various 
brutal methods." 
  The SAIRI statement pointed to the continued artillery 
bombardment of the marshland in the south. "In the absence of 
international deterrent measures, Saddam's forces continues to 
launch their repressive and devastating operations in the 
marshland area in southern Iraq," according to the statement, 
which cited opposition sources as saying that artillery shells 
continue to affect all the positions situated on the 
al-'Amarah-al-Salam district, like the areas of Abu Sab', Abu 
Karmali, al-Ra'ash, and al-Hashiriyah. This is in addition to 
the search and sweep campaigns. 
  Government forces have also launched an attack on the areas 
of al-Kabibah and Abu Kabrah and on some villages in al-Rifa'i 
area in al-Nasiriyah Governorate, inflicting heavy losses and 
damage on people, their property, and homes in these areas. 
  In Damascus, an official source from the Islamic Action 
Organization in Iraq confirmed that the regime has encircled 
Baghdad using the Armed Forces, deploying search vehicles at the 
capital's approaches and exists in anticipation of an explosion 
in the situation following the increase in the masses' 
indignation and jihad action against the regime early this 
month. The source pointed out that "the security collapse which 
southern cities in particular are witnessing has begun to extend 
to the capital, Baghdad. Public criticism of the regime, its 
elements, and Saddam is now a common phenomenon, even in 
Baghdad," which Saddam considers his safe stronghold. 
  Meanwhile, a statement issued by the Islamic Action 
Organization Information Office has said that Baghdad has for 
some time been experiencing widespread cases of looting at the 
hands of armed gangs run by supporters of the regime to alarm 
people and preoccupy them with defending themselves. 
  The statement says that these cases are distributed 
particularly in the areas situated between Baghdad and 
al-'Aziziyah. Cases of the assassination of the regime's 
supporters among security, police, and intelligence elements 
have increased. They are assassinated by people who are 
indignant at the execution and arrest campaigns. 
  The statement also says that the regime recently executed 40 
people who had been jailed in al-Radwaniyah prison on charges of 
collaborating with the "mujahidin" opposed to the regime. The 
sources which supplied this information confirm that 
al-Radwaniyah prison is now full of prisoners who are being 
exposed to the harshest of physical and mental torture and 
offered bad food.

  [Text] Baghdad, Apr. 20, INA -- Vice-President Taha Yasin 
Ramadan today opened in Baghdad the international symposium on 
woman and human rights in the presence of some 180 women 
dignitaries including several ministers and politicians from 25 
Arab and foreign countries. 
  The symposium, to discuss means of encountering current 
challenges facing women and the dangerous impact of the 
oppressive embargo on Iraq on the basic human rights and family 
and the responsibility of the world community in putting an end 
to this embargo, will also be attended by representatives from 
several regional and international women organizations. 
  Speaking to INA on occasion, Mrs. Manual 'Abd-al-Razzaq, 
chairwoman of the International Federation of Iraqi Women, said 
the symposium will be in prepration to the fourth international 
conference of women and the gathering on nongovernmental 
organizations both to convene in Beijing next year. 
  Mrs. 'Abd-al-Razzaq said the symposium agenda covers several 
viewpoints on the problems facing the women march and activity 
and also includes several scientific studies and researches in 
the social, political, and economic fields. 
  The symposium also has on its agenda objectives of the 
Nairobi strategy focused on equality, development, and peace and 
the challenges facing women in performing their rights and 
participation in development and work. 
  The federation chairwoman added that the symposium will also 
shed light on the legal status of women in Iraq and impact of 
environmental pollution resulting from the American-led 
aggression on Iraq. 
  Addressing the opening session, Vice President Mr. Ramadan 
said the United States and its allies which trade with the 
slogans of human rights maintain strong animosity and hatred to 
the human. They had employed against this human the most brutal 
means of annihiliation, starvation, disease, and death 
represented in the 30-state aggression on Iraq and destroying 
the basic prerequisites of the Iraqi human including schools, 
hospitals, electric, and water systems, and even civilian 
shelters. 
  Mr. Ramadan also referred to the perpetuation of the 
unjustified embargo on Iraq and the U.S.-led invasion of Somalia 
and the crimes being carried out against the Palestinian people 
by the Zionist occupiers. 
  Mr. Ramadan expressed confidence that the symposium would 
reach positive results contributing to realizing aspirations and 
rights of the human, the world over and in the manner of facing 
the challenges of the current critical international situation. 
  Mr. Ramadan said that conditions facing women and children 
in 
Iraq from the U.S. Administration and its allies represent a 
flagrant breaching to the human rights and that that is 
regrettably being done in the name of the United Nations, which 
should boost and protect human rights. He said the symposium 
should focus discussion on this issue and work out urgent 
treatment to this inhumane grave phenomenon. 
  Mr. Ramadan further said that since the imposition of 
sanctions on Iraq in August, 1990, the woman and family in Iraq 
suffered from dangerous conditions that had led to the increase 
of mortality among infants and women because of the severe 
shortages of food and medicines. This embargo has intensified 
the burdens of women in Iraq in addition to her basic tasks of 
the care extended to the family, he pointed out. 
  Mr. Ramadan said the symposium should discuss the social, 
economic, and political challenges facing the woman exercising 
of her rights and reaching practical results so that the woman 
could play her role in defending human rights and not only those 
of woman.

<F P=106> [Article by Chief Editor Salah al-Mukhtar: "What Does the </F>
Flow of Delegations into Iraq Mean?"] 
  [Excerpts] There is a new eye-catching phenomenon in the 
life of our country, bringing happiness into the hearts of the 
Iraqis, who are full love for Iraq and its independence. This 
is because this phenomenon produces new and categorical evidence 
that the front of the hostile forces that have imposed the 
criminal comprehensive blockade is disintegrating. After the 
split which took place at the UN Security Council and led to the 
emergence of a majority supporting Iraq's rightful demand that 
the blockade be lifted, there has been a noticeable increase in 
the flow of Arab and world figures and delegations arriving into 
Iraq, both publicly and officially, making the point that they 
want to assert their support for Iraq and condemnation of the 
blockade. 
  A quick glance at yesterday's press reports on the visiting 
delegations and figures is enough to make us realize the great 
and positive changes which have turned into a phenomenon 
pleasing Iraq and lovers of freedom and disheartening the slaves 
of evil and the Satan occupying the White House. 
  The press reports noted the arrival of two Italian economic 
and parliamentary delegations, a German economic delegation, a 
French media-commercial delegation, two Belgian delegations, a 
Jordanian delegation led by a deputy prime minister, a Romanian 
minister, and Bishop Capucci, who arrived to voice his 
solidarity. [passage omitted] 
  The public flow of delegations and officials and their 
unanimous support for Iraq and the expression of their desire to 
have trade with Iraq has a profound, clear, and significant 
message. It tells us that the world--both states and 
institutions--has become weary of and unprepared to tolerate the 
U.S. excesses anymore. It also shows that the world has freed 
itself of many of the factors of fear and hesitation, taking 
moves to condemn the U.S. colonialism and support Iraq. In this 
vein, the visits to Iraq break the cordon of isolation that the 
United States has imposed with force and terror. 
  This positive phenomenon complements and supports another 
phenomenon, which is the rift in the stands of the UN Security 
Council member states on Iraq. This is because by expressing 
its support for Iraq, the world public opinion offers support 
for the states that have changed their stands and begun to 
demand that the blockade be lifted. Besides, the presence of 
official trade delegations is yet further evidence that 
circumstances are getting ripe for the end of the blockade. In 
the past, foreign companies used to visit Iraq for secret talks 
on future contracts. But now, they are publicly declaring their 
decisions regarding Iraq. 
  What does all that mean? It means, among many other things, 
that the Iraqi people's steadfastness and sacrifices have 
provided a solid basis for the world to review and reconsider 
its stands. This is just the beginning. Bill Clinton, who 
furiously and stupidly watches these developments, should 
prepare his cheek, which is swollen from domestic slaps, for a 
new slap from Iraq, which might make him weep, after he has 
begun to see how the world is gradually siding with Iraq and 
opposing his criminal plans to annihilate the Iraqis. 
  Clinton: Drowned as you are in an ocean of crises and 
scandals, pause for a while and consider your future. The Iraq 
storm is coming, there is no question about it. You are 
vulnerable, and can take no more slaps.

  [Excerpt] Kuwait, 21 Apr -- Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, first 
deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, has 
stressed that there are no political parties in Kuwait and that 
the establishment of parties would not be allowed there. 
  In an interview with AL-ANBA today, Shaykh Sabah said that 
the new government had not been chosen to represent any 
particular trend or orientation, but had been chosen from all 
the sons of Kuwait. 
  He added that what distinguishes Kuwait is that all its sons 
belong to one family and there is no discrimination or 
preference for any of its sons over any other except on the 
basis of his abilities and aptitudes. 
  Al-Sabah said that even if their opinions differ on some 
matters, the opinions of all Kuwaitis ultimately serve the 
interest of Kuwait. 
  He said that the new government faces the challenges of 
implementing the law and extending the rule of law, and will not 
be a government of challenges to persons or trends as some 
people are saying. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ismailia, 20 Apr (MENA) -- Qatari Foreign Minister 
Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani stressed that his country favors 
the Suez Canal as an Arab and international maritime route and 
supports the efforts to increase Egypt's revenue from it. 
  In a telephone call he made today to the Suez Canal 
Authority 
[SCA] chairman, Engineer Muhammad 'Izzat 'Adil, the Qatari 
minister said that Qatar has postponed discussion of a project 
to build a pipeline to carry Qatar's natural gas to Italy 
following a recent offer from the SCA giving a 30.5 percent 
reduction to Qatari gas tankers using the Suez Canal. 
  Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim added that the project to build a 
pipeline to carry Qatari gas to Europe through Israel is merely 
a project, the implementation of which is linked with Israel's 
withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967 and 
does not aim to damage the Suez Canal, because the latter "is 
all the Arabs' canal." 
  The Qatari foreign minister stressed that his country will 
take no step on this project without considering the interests 
of the Arab countries, especially Egypt. He added that Arab and 
foreign media have exaggerated this issue. 
  The Qatari foreign minister's telephone call was made 
following press statements by Engineer Muhammad 'Izzat 'Adil in 
which he expressed his concern about the negative consequences 
of building a pipeline to carry Qatari natural gas to Europe 
through Israel.

  [Text] Doha, 20 Apr (WAKH) -- Dr. Irfan Ljubijankic, 
foreign minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, has criticized the 
performance of the United Nations in Gorazde and its failure to 
take appropriate measures in the besieged enclave. UN values 
have broken down, he said. 
  Speaking on his arrival in Doha this morning, Dr. 
Ljubijankic 
said he was amazed by the UN approach to Bosnia. The United 
Nations, he said, had designated Gorazde as a safe area and 
pledged to protect it against attack. Yet, the shooting down of 
an aircraft by the Serbs has had no reaction. 
  The Bosnian minister said the reaction of the international 
community to what is happening in his country is disgraceful. 
His country was prepared to defend itself, despite an estimated 
200,000 casualties over the past two years. 
  In remarks carried by the QATARI NEWS AGENCY, Ljubijankic 
said Russia's attitude toward the Gorazde siege was disgraceful. 
He said the solutions proposed by Russia are mere tactics to 
buy time for the Serbs to overrun the city. 
  He called on the Muslim world to lend political support to 
Bosnia at the United Nations and other international forums and 
urged the lifting of the international arms embargo on Bosnia. 
  Ljubijankic said that with the exception of certain states, 
Europe was acting stupidly toward the Bosnian question. Europe, 
he said, had nothing to fear from an Islamic state in its midst, 
since Islam has a more significant presence in other European 
nations than in Bosnia.

aggression, particularly in Gorazde.

  [Text] London, Apr. 21, IRNA -- A Saudi opposition group 
said Wednesday [20 April] that following a crackdown on its 
members in Riyadh, it had no option but to move outside the 
country to resume its activities. The Committee for the Defense 
of Legitimate Rights in Saudi Arabia issuing a statement said 
that it was pursuing its mission in London for continuing its 
struggle until justice is established and oppression is 
eliminated in Saudi Arabia. 
  The statement added that the group, which was set up by 
scholars and professors in May 1993, had no choice because "all 
means and methods of free expression and reform became 
impossible" and that it would be "unwise and risky to postpone 
undertaking the initiative." The committee called on the Saudi 
citizens and others eager to support the elimination of 
injustice to cooperate until their goals were accomplished. 
  Repressive measures listed against the group included being 
banned from travelling, dismissal from work, closed down of 
professional practices, imprisonment, torture and threat of 
murder, it added. 
  The committee's statement was signed by the official 
spokesman, Dr. Muhammad al-Mas'ari, who was reported to be 
missing in March. But the group said his disappearance after his 
release from prison last November was a cover to arrange his 
escape to Europe. 
  Scores of the group's members, including al-Mas'ari, a 
physics professor from King Sa'ud University, were arrested last 
year, following the submission of a letter to King Fahd, 
demanding reforms. 
  The statement said that the state's response, although 
violent, convulsive and escalatory, did not alter their 
determination to pursue a peace path for the just cause of 
justice in Saudi Arabia.

<F P=106> [Report by Hamud Munsir: "Yemen: Failure To Withdraw Forces </F>
Threatens `Two 'Alis' Meeting in Cairo"] 
  [Excerpts] Sanaa, Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Yemeni 
joint military committee has failed to reach an agreement on the 
separation of northern and southern forces in the contact areas 
on the former partition border between north and south Yemen. As 
a result, there is a delay in preparing a plan to implement the 
military aspect of the "Pledge and Accord Document," which was 
supposed to be submitted to the Council of Ministers for 
endorsement at its meeting in Sanaa today under the chairmanship 
of First Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Hasan Makki. 
  Sources familiar with the military committee's work have 
said 
that the failure to reach an agreement is attributable to the 
Yemeni Socialist Party's [YSP] insistence that the military 
units belonging to it be withdrawn from northern governorates 
and that the northern units present in southern governorates be 
moved to the north; there are five southern brigades in the 
northern governorates. [passage omitted] 
  The sources added that the proposal to return the forces to 
the governorates to which they belong is one of the clauses in 
the Egyptian mediation initiative between the YSP and the 
General People's Congress [GPC]. This is in addition to the 
proposal to withdraw forces from the former partition border 
which the military committee agreed to implement in yesterday's 
meeting. It has also drawn up a plan to implement it. 
  The military committee's failure to withdraw northern forces 
from the south and southern forces from the north could result 
in delaying the anticipated meeting between President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, secretary general of the GPC, and Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the YSP, in 
Cairo at the end of the month or the beginning of next month, 
because the Egyptian initiative focuses on defusing seats of 
military tension first. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Lieutenant General 'Umar Hasan Ahmad 
al-Bashir this afternoon received Hamid Yusuf Hammadi, personal 
envoy of His Excellency President Saddam Husayn and culture and 
information minister, who relayed to him a personal message from 
the leader president containing the Iraqi leadership's views 
regarding the situation at the UN Security Council, and the 
possible activation of this situation to lift the unfair embargo 
clamped on the Iraqi people. The message also underscores the 
importance of coordination among fraternal and friendly states 
at international forums to bring about this eventuality. 
  During the meeting, Sudanese President 'Umar Hasan Ahmad 
al-Bashir reiterated Sudan's firm pan-Arab support for and 
solidarity with Iraq, which he described as the nation's bulwark 
in its jihad against exploitative enemies, and also in its quest 
for development and progress. 
  Lt. Gen. al-Bashir noted that Sudan has always been, and 
will 
always remain supportive of Iraq in its resistance to 
colonialist powers. He expressed his admiration and 
appreciation of the accomplishments made by the Iraqi mujahidin 
under leader President Saddam Husayn in the course of rebuilding 
what the aggressive evildoers destroyed, drawing on their 
intrinsic resources and national expertise. 
  The personal envoy of the leader president also discussed 
with Lt. Gen. 'Umar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir the means to promote 
and enhance the fraternal bilateral ties in the interest of the 
two peoples and the Arab nation. 
  The meeting was attended by Sudanese Minister of Culture and 
Information 'Abd-al-Basit Sabdarat; Sudanese Minister of 
Presidential Affairs Dr. 'Awad Ahmad al-Jaz; Brigadier General 
'Abd-al-Rahim Muhammad Husayn, secretary general of the 
Presidency of the Republic and minister of interior; and 
'Abd-al-Samad Sumayd 'Ali, Iraqi ambassador to Sudan. 
  Culture and Information Minister Hamid Yusuf Hammadi arrived 
in Khartoum this morning.

  [Text] Culture and Information Minister Hamid Yusuf Hammadi 
held a news conference in Khartoum this afternoon. The news 
conference was attended by chief editors of major Sudanese 
newspapers, television correspondents, and correspondents of 
Arab and foreign news agencies. 
  At the outset of the news conference, the minister addressed 
developments on the situation at the UN Security Council with 
regard to the unfair embargo clamped on Iraq, as well as the 
positions of permanent and nonpermanent members of the Council 
on the issue. He also explained the relationship between Iraq 
and the Special Commission chaired by Ekeus since 1991. 
Furthermore, he reviewed Iraq's fair positions and its 
implementation of Paragraphs 8 and 13 of Section C of UN 
Security Council Resolution 687. He also addressed the evasion 
demonstrated by the Special Commission and inspection teams, the 
media deception, and the political pressures applied by the U.S. 
Administration and the British Government to maintain the 
sanctions. He noted that the U.S. Administration and the 
British Government have become isolated because of these 
positions of theirs. 
  The minister also spoke on his mission in Sudan and several 
other Arab states, which included the communication of personal 
messages from the leader president, may God protect him, to the 
leaders of these countries, explaining the Iraqi position, as 
well as the positions of the UN Special Commission, the U.S. 
Government, and the British Government. He discussed possible 
coordination with fraternal and friendly states to ensure 
compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 687 by the 
council itself. 
  The culture and information minister reviewed with the 
reporters in Khartoum the impact of the unfair embargo, as well 
as the great Iraqi jihad in the course of the reconstruction 
drive currently under way in Iraq. He answered the questions 
they posed. 
  At the end of the news conference, the personal envoy of the 
leader president, may God protect him, met with the heads of the 
Arab diplomatic missions accredited to Sudan at the premises of 
the Iraqi Embassy in Khartoum. He reviewed with them what Iraq 
has implemented of Paragraphs 8 and 13 of Section C of UN 
Security Council Resolution 687, as acknowledged in reports the 
UN Special Commission has submitted in this regard. He also 
explained to the Arab diplomats the developments of the 
situation at the UN Security Council. 
  Moreover, the minister spoke about the invitation National 
Assembly Speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih extended to a delegation of 
the Kuwaiti Parliament to visit Iraq to discuss all outstanding 
issues, including the issue pertaining to missing Kuwaitis, the 
call that reflects a desire to explain the facts to the Kuwaiti 
Parliament, which the Kuwaiti rulers are attempting to 
misrepresent, as they did prior to August 2, 1990. 
  The meeting was attended by Iraqi Ambassador to Sudan 
'Abd-al-Samad Sumayd 'Ali.

  [Text] Mr. 'Abd-al-Basit Sabdarat, minister of culture and 
information, issued a statement today concerning the abduction 
of Sudan's ambassador to Somalia. The statement said an armed 
group, composed of three persons belonging to the Somali 
(Kawadla) tribe, abducted Sudanese Ambassador 'Abd-al-Baqi 
Muhammad Hasan while he was driving home after work on 19 April. 
  Immediately after the incident Sudanese authorities 
conducted 
intensive diplomatic and political maneuvers with all the 
concerned parties in Somalia, in particular, and the Horn of 
Africa, in general. These actions included direct dialogue with 
the abductors, which continued until late last night and carried 
on until this morning. 
  The abductors asked for hard currency in exchange for 
freeing 
the ambassador. According to a statement, the ambassador is 
alive and well and is enjoying good health. The statement also 
reports that he was not harmed in any way. The statement 
continues, saying that the Sudanese authorities will make every 
effort to ensure that the Sudanese ambassador to Somalia is 
returned safely.

<F P=106> [Reports by Nizar Daww-al-Na'im in London, Sulayman Salim in </F>
Nairobi, and Kamal Hamid in Khartoum: "Garang Paves the Way for 
the Declaration of a State by Creating the `New Sudan' Entity"] 
  [Excerpts] The mainstream of the Sudanese People's 
Liberation Movement [SPLM] led by Colonel John Garang has 
declared that the movement's first general congress "has 
announced the birth of a political and administrative entity 
which will from now on be called the New Sudan." In its 
resolutions, the congress defined the New Sudan's territory and 
created military and civilian administrations, a parliament, and 
a judicial system in a step believed to pave the way for the 
declaration of a state in southern Sudan or for the imposition 
of a confederal formula for the country. [passage omitted] 
  A press statement issued by the SPLM, a copy of which was 
received by AL-HAYAH yesterday, said that the movement's 
congress, the first of its kind since since the movement's birth 
in 1983, concluded its work on 11 April in an unnamed venue 
somewhere in "the liberated areas of southern Sudan." It added 
that the congress "announced the birth of a political and 
administrative entity which will from now on be called the New 
Sudan" and that it will consist of "areas south of Kurdufan (in 
the west of the country), south of the Blue Nile (in the east), 
and the three southern districts of the Upper Nile, Equatoria, 
and Bahr al-Ghazal," the regions identified by the movement as 
the "fighting regions," which were known as the "closed regions" 
under British colonialism and from which the northerners were 
banned except by special permit. 
  The congress formed a parliament for the New Sudan and 
called 
it "the National Liberation Council" with a term of five years. 
It also formed an Executive Council similar to a cabinet. It 
elected Garang as speaker of the parliament and chairman of the 
Executive Council and appointed the movement's Chief of Staff 
Commander Silva Kir [as transliterated] as Garang's deputy. 
  The congress decided that the Liberation Council shall 
consist of 182 members "of whom 132 are to be elected by popular 
ballot, 38 are to represent the movement's Army and regular 
forces, and 10, in addition to the speaker and his deputy, are 
to be appointed." 
  The congress authorized the Executive Council to work for 
the 
following: 
  1. Seek to fulfill the right of the people of the New Sudan 
to self-determination by all means including armed struggle. 
  2. Use the New Sudan's resources in the management of the 
war if necessary. 
  3. Separate the civilian administration from the military 
administration. 
  4. Introduce the necessary civilian administration 
structures for the New Sudan. 
  5. Create a judiciary system to be independent from the 
legislative and executive institutions. 
  6. Uphold the rule of law and human rights. 
  7. Grant a general amnesty for individuals who rebelled 
against the movement or committed crimes. 
  Steven Wandu, the movement's spokesman, said that Garang 
assured the congress members that the Executive Council would 
implement the congress resolutions and he announced a general 
amnesty for his opponents and emphasized that "those who return 
would be given their full rights and privileges." Garang 
affirmed that the Council "will do its best to achieve unity of 
the people of the New Sudan." 
  Movement sources say that the announcement of the creation 
of 
a new entity coincides with the movement's call for a confederal 
state in Sudan for a transitional period to be followed by a 
referendum on self-determination. Observers of Sudanese affairs 
see that step as a practical move toward that phase which had 
been expected to materialize in the context of a peace agreement 
defining the jurisdictions of the northern and southern entities 
in the transitional period in accordance with the movement's 
peace plan. 
  Commenting on the announcement of the New Sudan entity, a 
Sudanese Government source has stated that the "aim of such talk 
is to raise the collapsing morale of the rebel soldiers after 
the successive defeats they suffered and the divisions within 
their ranks." That declaration, he said, "might have been 
effective had it been made in 1987 or 1988 when the rebels were 
in control of all southern territories with the exception of the 
three main cities, but it is ridiculous now as the government is 
control of all Sudanese territory with the exception of some 
isolated pockets on the borders with Uganda." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Uthman Mirghani: "Demonstrations Against `High </F>
Prices'; Forces Deployed in Medani"] 
  [Excerpt] London -- Well-informed Sudanese sources have 
said that Medani, the second largest city in Sudan after 
Khartoum, has witnessed widespread demonstrations against high 
prices and living conditions, and that Central Security and Army 
troops have been deployed in the streets to guard the main 
sensitive sites in the city. 
  These domestic developments coincided with reports of the 
abduction of Sudanese Ambassador to Mogadishu 'Abd-al-Baqi 
Muhammad Hasan yesterday by gunmen while he was on his way to 
his office from his residence. 
  With regard to the demonstrations in Medani, south of 
Khartoum, the sources said that the demonstrations started the 
day before yesterday and continued yesterday. University and 
high school students and a number of workers and employees took 
part in the demonstrations. 
  There have been no reports of casualties. However, sources 
told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the demonstrations were noisy and 
violent. 
  Medani has over the past months witnessed widespread 
demonstrations against living conditions, during which 
demonstrators burned some installations, banks, and gas 
stations. The security forces' intervention led to clashes and 
casualties. 
  There have also been reports of demonstrations in al-Qadarif 
city in east Sudan. 
  Meanwhile, the Sudanese Government made contacts with the 
various Somali parties yesterday to secure the release of 
Ambassador 'Abd-al-Baqi Muhammad Hasan, 48, who was abducted by 
three gunmen. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Speech by Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi; date and place not </F>
given--live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] It is my pleasure to be here where you are 
stationed and where you are carrying out pioneering work on the 
frontline, constructing an advanced trench and confrontation 
line and an historic fortress on our Mediterranean, the Arab 
sea, coast. You are fortifying the coast. You are the first 
battalion of the sons of our people to undertake this kind of 
voluntary work. You have left your family, your children, and 
your private work. [passage omitted] 
  We offer this as an example to the rest of the Libyan people 
that our people are capable of carrying out the necessary work 
by relying on inner resources. You have paved the way for the 
Libyan people with this pioneering work and the attendance from 
all parts of the jamahiriyah. [passage omitted] 
  This presence has given comaraderie its true meaning. This 
comaraderie is historic and this group is historic. People get 
to know each other then forget each other, meet and separate, 
forget each other, and memories fade. All except for this 
comaraderie. The page of this comaraderie has not been closed. 
We have decided to leave this page open in order to record in 
it the work we want done by our will, and open to our children 
and grandchildren to record further work on the path of this 
historic comaraderie. [passage omitted] 
  Consequently, this comaraderie has entered the annals of 
history. For my part, I will make a pledge and in honoring this 
pledge to those who have known me or who have been my comrades, 
I will make every effort to prevent any cause for regret that he 
has known me or has been my comrade. I am committed to this 
pledge. I am committed to this. I will try not to let anyone, 
his family, or his children at any time regret knowing this 
person or being his comrade. On the contrary, I want those who 
have known me or who been my comrades to praise God for that 
comaraderie and acquaintance. I want his children, his family, 
and his grandchildren also to praise God for that acquaintance 
and comaraderie -- except for those who have been unfair to 
themselves. This applies equally to comrades from the days of 
study and those who subsequently joined the death convoy 
[qafilat al-mawt] at military college or the army -- except for 
those who have betrayed themselves. 
  Those who betray comaraderie and their comrades or who 
abandon and turn against comaraderie, their guilt is their own. 
This is an historic matter. I am being hard on myself in order 
not to let any comrade suffer regrets about comaraderie. No, 
those who have not been our comrades may regret it and say: I 
wish I knew those people, I wish I were a comrade of those 
people, and I wish I were one of those comrades. As for the 
comrades themselves, I want them and their children to praise 
God for having been comrades and becoming one of the comrades. 
  In fact, we are writing something into our history that is 
regrettably missing; it is now missing in this nation. There is 
nothing but ingratitude, repudiation, hypocrisy, liquidating 
comrades, forgetting the past, and obliterating good memories. 
We have seen these things in Arab revolutions and coups, Arab 
political systems, and Arab political parties. Everything 
around the Arab political arena has produced nothing but 
tragedy, ingratitude, repudiation, liquidation, idolization, and 
oblivion. Those things will be gone with the wind and those 
pages will be closed. Furthermore, they will be thrown into the 
garbage can and into oblivion. 
  With this comaraderie we are giving comaraderie its sacred 
meaning. I believe that this nation needs...[pauses] is morally 
bankrupt and this may be the reason for bankruptcy in other 
areas. [passage omitted] 
  The work you are doing will strengthen the missing morals 
and 
the meaning of loyalty and will give history a meaning. This is 
the comaraderie of men and it is vastly different from all other 
comaraderies which are bad and will lead to perversity, regret, 
and sorrow. One would regret having been a comrade of that 
person. [passage omitted] 
  We feel sorry for those who have been unfair to themselves 
and who have betrayed comaraderie. However, perehaps some 
people think that we are reffering to a particular comrade when 
we talk about those who have betrayed comaraderie. Things like 
that come from those who joined later and those who joined us at 
other stages and for other reasons. However, all those people 
are surprised that those comrades who have remained loyal, 
revolutionary, and sincere for 30 years. None of us 
betrayed...[pauses] None of the comrades...[pauses] We have 
known each other since 1956 and 1959 when we sat down and 
planned the revolution, staged demonstrations, and mobilized the 
vital forces for the people's revolution. None othose comrades 
deviated. 
  The fact is that we should draw a line between this 
historic comaraderie and the military among whom I formed a 
movement within the armed forces to stage a revolution in 1969 
to lead the Libyan people. This is what happened. [passage 
omitted] 
  When people in the military go astray and start having 
fascist aspirations, this is to be expected and should not 
affect our comaraderie at all. When an officer whose rank is 
highter than mine, who took part with me in the movement, two 
months later wanted to turn against the revolution, conspire, or 
do something against it, this has nothing to do with you in my 
assessment. 
  The fascist spirit among the military is well known. It is 
always inclined to tyranny and even conspiracy and so on. 
[passage omitted] 
  As you have seen, all the attempts of the fascists since the 
advent of the revolution have failed. Why is that? Because 
they are facing a people's revolution. They thought that the 
revolution started when Mu'ammar Al-Qadhdhafi started mobilizing 
cadets in the military academy and officers in the armed forces. 
[passage omitted] 
  I found that all those students in the schools were ready, 
for instance, to demonstrate for a Pan-Arab or national cause, 
and I commissioned this or that cell and told them to organize 
for revolution. 
  Now you are spreading this atmosphere among the Libyan 
people. People are now regaining their consciousness. Many of 
them are regaining their consciousness. Even those who 
conspired against the revolution and those whom we pardoned, are 
now saying: Brothers, how wrong we were! [passage omitted] 
  I really praise God that you are all happy with this 
comradeship and that you say: Thank God that we were comrades. 
Your children are happy, your families are happy. Our 
comradeship is a source of pride for you, your children, and 
your families, a source of personal and family honor. [passage 
omitted] 
  You have actually proved that it is not merely a matter of 
shouting slogans or talking, but one of pioneering work. We 
believe that your Libyan brothers will follow in your footsteps 
and affirm that you have opened the way for them. Crowds of 
Libyans will come forward for voluntary work, to fortify the 
coast or to build the railroad. This railroad must be built to 
link the Arab homeland and to serve Arab unity despite the 
circumstances imposed on us, despite the colonialists and those 
who challenge us. 
  We must transform this crisis into positive work and 
transform the disadvantage to an advantage through our will. We 
must defy them and say to them that in the midst of these 
circumstances the more you increase your challenges, the more we 
will pose a challenge; we will do things which we did not do 
when there was no challenge. We will become more stubborn and 
we will defy them with work. 
  The Libyan coast should eventually -- and I cannot set a 
date 
-- be such that they the enemies will exclude it from their 
plans for landing. 
  They are looking for the easy land, the paved land, the 
sandy 
land which will offer no resistance, and they would like to have 
the upper hand. They want profit without loss. They want 
something without loss. We have to show them that the loss will 
stem from thinking of committing an aggression against Libya and 
that the Libyan coast will be their graveyard. 
  Here we are actually digging. As I said earlier, we are not 
only digging trenches and canals in order to use the sea water 
to drown the coast. We are digging a graveyard for the enemy if 
he comes to this land. In fact, my inspection of this region 
today has revealed to me things about which I was talking with 
Muftah and the others. The inspection revealed that there is a 
fertile land, rain falls every year in the region, and there are 
water springs and water wells, like this well here, which are 
the extension of Ayn Tawurgha'. We thought that these lagoons we 
constructed using sea water could become fish farms, and at the 
same time become fortifications for the coast. All this land 
could become farms. We thought that one day modern houses could 
be built -- I mean a house in every area, and the owner of the 
house would have either a fish farm, a vineyard, palm trees, or 
grazing land. This is a region of rich grazing land and we 
could plant vineyards, fig plantations, and so on. We could 
introduce fish farms. 
  Eventually, this place will not only be profit-making. 
Whoever agrees to settle here will be a frontline settler. 
Those who settle in this region will be frontline settlers. 
They will have a permanent and historic bond to settle in this 
region, defend it, exploit it and benefit from it. 
  Anyway, I am happy -- very happy -- to be among my comrades. 
Please convey my greetings to your families. May our 
comradeship continue for ever.

  [Text] Hamas has announced that it would sign a peace 
agreement with the Israelis if they withdrew from the 
territories occupied in 1967 and dismantled the Jewish 
settlements. This position means that Hamas has recognized the 
enemy. Thus, the fighting spirit has died down. There is no 
difference now between this movement and those who have 
recognized the enemy, since they all take the same position when 
they say that Palestine is the territory that was occupied in 
1967. This is a major fallacy that destroys historical facts 
and the constants of the nationalist cause for which the Arab 
nation has confronted the Israeli enemy since he began his 
occupation of the Palestinian land a century ago.

  [Text] The situation is calm in western areas of Kabul and 
development activities continue in the fields of education and 
construction. According to Dr. Abdorrahman, member of the peace 
commission of western Kabul, the sporadic firing occurring in 
the west of Kabul sometimes is the act of irresponsible people, 
and is not to be concerned about. Answering a question, he said 
that the peace commission reassures all residents of Kabul that, 
as in the past, the permanent cease-fire continues to be 
observed in the western areas of Kabul. Dr. Abdorrahman says 
that four saboteurs have been captured by the commission and 
their warmongering action has been prevented. 
  The peace commission of the western areas of Kabul was set 
up 
last year by Jami'at-e Eslami, Hezb-e Wahdat Eslami, Ettehad-e 
Eslami and Harakat-e Eslami, and on top of preventing armed 
clashes, it makes efforts in the field of social services too.

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan: "Libyan Mediation Between </F>
Afghan Factions"] 
  [Text] Peshawar -- A nine-member Libyan committee headed by 
Dr. Mukhtar Ahmad Dayrah, dean of the Da'wah and Religious 
Principles College, has arrived in Peshawar to mediate between 
the warring Afghan factions. Dayrah told AL-HAYAH yesterday 
that the committee stemmed from a conference called for by the 
ulema and mosque preachers in Libya during the month of Ramadan. 
During that conference, four committees were formed to go to 
Islamic hotbeds of tension to help put an end to Muslim 
tragedies. "One committee proceeded to Somalia, a second 
committee went to Bosnia-Herzegovina, a third to the Kurds, and 
a fourth to Afghanistan." 
  On the reasons for the committee's late arrival, he said 
that 
"the U.S. blockade against Libya and visa procedures and 
complications contributed to the delay." 
  The committee chairman denied the existence of any 
preconceived plan. He said: "We are judges and we must hear 
the views of all parties and then give our opinion as to how the 
problem could be solved." He urged all the factions "not to 
waste the gains of 14 years of jihad." He added: "We have 
long-standing relations with the mujahidin. We do not object to 
mediation by any country for the desired peace. Libya is not a 
state neighboring Afghanistan. We have no interests there and we 
do not covet its wealth. All we want is to see peace 
established there." 
  Informed Afghan sources told AL-HAYAH yesterday that Afghan 
President Borhanoddin Rabbani and Prime Minister Golboddin 
Hekmatyar have accepted the Libyan mediation which coincides 
with the work of other Afghan and non-Afghan committees.

during the period of resistance. He also expressed his thanks 
and appreciation for the Great Jamahiriyah's initiative aimed at 
achieving reconciliation among the parties to the conflict,

  [Text] Presided over by esteemed acting Attorney General 
Sayd Abdorrazaq Mosamem, the session of the Consultative Council 
of the attorney general was held today. After a comprehensive 
discussion on issues the following points were approved. 
  1. All jihadi organizations, political parties, political 
and national leaders and personalities of the country are aware 
that foreigners cannot resolve our people's and country's 
problems. The oppressive and ruthless battles of armed 
aggressors also cannot be a solution. Therefore, all of us will 
believe in the following order of God: If you differ in 
anything among yourselves, refer to God and his Apostle, and to 
adhere to what are Islamic principles and laws in the eyes of 
almighty God and Islamic principles are acted upon in the 
country. 
  2. Under Article 42 of the law of courts' jurisdiction and 
organization, and Articles 397 and 399 of the penal law, and 
Article 433 of the law of civil litigation, the resolution of 
the high council of the Supreme Court -- the highest and last 
authority of the judiciary of the country -- dated 18 Hout 1372 
[9 March 1994], which is in keeping with the principles of 
Mohammadan shariya and the laws of the country, on the election 
of the president by the representatives of the people in the 
Settlement and Solution Council is enforceable, and violation 
from it and its nonobservance is considered a crime, which is 
punishable under Article 285 of the penal law. Public 
prosecutors are obliged, in line with their duties, to deal with 
the violator in accordance with the law, in case of violation 
from the resolution of the judiciary, which is based on the 
distinguished religion of Islam. 
  3. The Afghan problem is under serious consideration and 
negotiations by domestic and international bodies. Those views 
and resolutions will be accepted provided they entail the high 
interests of our country and the will of the majority of the 
citizens of the country. Otherwise they will not be acceptable. 
  4. Highway security posts of jihadi forces, the Ministry of 
Defense, the Department of National Security, and police 
officials are reminded to pay serious attention to the 
prevention of trafficking of ancient and historic artifacts and 
to introduce the violators to the attorney general of the 
Islamic state in order that legal steps are taken for their 
prosecution in line with the laws.

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 12 April 
issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Mufti Calls on Rich Muslims To Invest in Their Countries 
  2. Statement Defends al-Azhar Imam as Authority on 
Religion 
  3. Sentences Passed for Criticism of Mufti 
  4. Seminar on Islam's View of Work and Productivity 
  5. Writer Raps West for Honoring Rushdie

  7. Writer on Support for Detainees' Families 
  8. Head of Kosovo's Islamic Shaykhdom Interviewed 
  9. Writer Urges Scholars To Unite To Face Islam's Enemies 
<H5>  MUFTI CALLS ON RICH MUSLIMS TO INVEST IN THEIR COUNTRIES </H5>
  A 140-word report on page 1 of 'AQIDATI carries an exclusive 
statement from the mufti of Egypt, Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, 
calling on rich Muslims to invest their funds in their homelands 
and not abroad. He says that investing money abroad is a sign 
of weak belief and that the faithful should invest their funds 
in their own countries and thus help reduce unemployment and 
increase production. The mufti's comments are in response to 
reports that the investments of Arabs and Muslims abroad total 
$670 billion, of which Egyptians invested $60 billion. 
<H5>  STATEMENT DEFENDS AL-AZHAR IMAM AS AUTHORITY ON RELIGION </H5>
  On page 1, 'AQIDATI carries a 70-word report on a statement 
issued by the Islamic Research Council replying to the 
criticisms leveled against al-Azhar and stressing that the 
al-Azhar imam is the grand imam and ultimate authority on 
religious affairs. On page 2, the newspaper carries the 1,400 
words text of the statement. 
<H5>  SENTENCES PASSED FOR CRITICISM OF MUFTI </H5>
  An 80-word report on page 2 says that the Cairo Criminal 
Court has sentenced in absentia Dr. Sha'ban Isma'il, head of the 
Shari'ah Department at the Islamic Studies College of al-Azhar 
University; Dr. 'Ali al-Salus, a teacher at Qatar University; 
and AL-NUR editor 'Ali Faruq, for criticizing the mufti's edicts 
on bank transactions and the importing of alcoholic drinks. 
They were each given six-month suspended jail sentences and 
fined 200 pounds. 
<H5>  SEMINAR ON ISLAM'S VIEW OF WORK AND PRODUCTIVITY </H5>
  A 2,000-word report on page 4 details the proceedings of a 
seminar held at al-Kharijah town in al-Wadid al-Jadid as part of 
the 'AQIDATI religious convoys that tour the country to explain 
the true tenets of Islam. Most of the seminar dealt with 
Islam's view of work and productivity, and ample Koranic quotes 
are given indicating that Islam advocates work. Saying that the 
issue of work and productivity is topical, Dr. Sabri 
'Abd-al-Ra'uf, dean of the Shari'ah Department at the al-Azhar 
Medical College, says that "Islam does not rely on slogans or 
prayers but on useful work to achieve the fruit of production." 
He then notes that "work and productivity should be based on 
studies, awareness, and full expertise. This is why it is our 
duty to refer to those who possess the message. God Almighty 
says "If ye realize this not, ask of those who possess the 
message." Islam rejects pursuing our lives without plan or 
purpose. We see ideas that are alien to our youths tending to 
turn them into idle hands and tempt some of them to devote 
themselves to prayers alone and to abandon work and 
productivity. Every youngster then turns into a mufti and 
speaks in the name of religion, but religion is not responsible 
for these youths, who do not understand the meaning of religion, 
the cause of religion. Religion does not accept these ideas." 
Questions on proper ways to pray, care for orphans, a wife's 
duty to a drunken husband, and the way of dealing with people in 
workplaces are then answered by the experts panel. 
<H5>  WRITER RAPS WEST FOR HONORING RUSHDIE </H5>
  A 400-word comment by Basyuni al-Halawani in the "With All 
Frankness" column on page 6 comments on the Austrian 
Government's decision to honor Salman Rushdie, British author of 
"The Satanic Verses." After saying that Europe continues its 
blatant hostility to Islam and recalling how Rushdie was 
received by President Clinton in the White House, the writer 
adds that "The U.S. President would have had a different stand 
had Rushdie criticized Christianity or Judaism." He then says 
that the issue now is not Rushdie but the thousands of 
charlatans and mercenaries who regard this renegade as their 
ideal and are daily attacking Islam. Predicting that attacks on 
Islam and its sources, the Koran and the prophet's sayings, will 
increase following the honoring of this renegade, he asks 
whether "the Islamic countries will be content with merely 
reiterating the expressions of condemnation and denunciation? 
Or will they take more positive steps to protect their 
religious sanctities and its shari'ah from these mercenaries?" 
  AL-AZHAR SHAYKH EXPLAINS RIGHTS AND DUTIES 
  A 900-word article by Grand Imam of al-Azhar Shaykh 
Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq on 'AQIDATI's page 7 deals with the 
interpretation of man's rights and duties under secular and 
religious laws. He starts by viewing the secular laws' 
interpretation of human rights and public freedoms, arguing that 
this interpretation means that human rights are more or less 
personal rights that are designed to protect the human being. 
He then presents Islam's view which indicates that man has both 
rights and duties. He adds that religion "indicates that the 
relationship between the ruler and the ruled makes it the duty 
of the ruler to be fair and to manage the affairs of the ruled 
in a legitimate way. It also makes it the duty of the ruled to 
obey the ruler as long as he obeys God and his prophet. The 
congregation has the right to have its interests cared for. The 
principle that religion is not compulsory gives every individual 
the right to his own creed. It is the duty of the state and 
society not to interfere with this freedom unless it is abused 
or threatens the Islamic society's safety, security, and strong 
structure." 
<H5>  WRITER ON SUPPORT FOR DETAINEES' FAMILIES </H5>
  A 400-word comment by Majdi Salim on page 10 comments on the 
testimony of repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi that he saw 
a lawyer handing a 250,000-pound check to a terrorist leader to 
spend on the families of terrorist detainees and prisoners. He 
argues that this should not be criticized, as the families have 
to be taken care of, otherwise the new generation will be angry 
with society. After citing a similar example from the 1960's, he 
concludes that "the state has rejected the notion of collective 
punishment. We should adhere to this, so that we can encircle 
terrorism and eliminate this phenomenon, which is alien to our 
society." 
<H5>  HEAD OF KOSOVO'S ISLAMIC SHAYKHDOM INTERVIEWED </H5>
  A 1,200-word report on an interview with Rajab Boya, head of 
the Islamic shaykhdom of Kosovo, appears on 'AQIDATI's page 20. 
After reviewing the number of Muslims and the areas they live 
in, he details the Serbs' persecution of Kosovo's Muslims and 
the measures taken against them. He then gives his view that 
the turn of Kosovo's Muslims will come once the Serbs have 
finished with Bosnia and that he expects this massacre to be 
worse than the Bosnian one. 
<H5>  WRITER URGES SCHOLARS TO UNITE TO FACE ISLAM'S ENEMIES </H5>
  A 500-word column by Al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf on page 24 
comments on the sentence passed by a Cairo court on two 
university teachers and AL-NUR's editor. The writer says he 
feels regret and sorrow at this ruling, which is not the first 
nor will it be the last as long as there are societies, media, 
different views, and even mistakes. He adds that his sorrow 
does not stem from the ruling itself but from the fact that 
differences between scholars have reached the courts. He says 
that scholars' differences should be confined to their circles 
and within objective limits, otherwise they would threaten 
educational and propagation work. Another point he notes that 
is that differences between scholars and labelling them either 
"the regime's scholars" or "scholars outside authority" have 
somewhat blocked these scholars from the arena and left it 
vacant for those who advocate extremist ideas. He then adds 
that letting "the scholars' differences reach the level of 
conflict and quarrels have opened the door wide for the enemies 
of Islam to promote polarization and attempt to sow sedition and 
deepen the dispute between these scholars." He calls on the 
scholars to put aside their differences and face the dangers 
posed to Islam from outside the land of Islam, as well as from 
inside.

  [Excerpts] 'Adil 'Awad Siyam Shulah, notorious terrorist 
and one of the top leaders of the domestic branch of the 
al-Jihad group, lay dead in a pool of blood following a brief 
shootout on al-Bahr al-A'zam Street in al-Jizah on the night of 
4 April. [passage omitted] 
  The slain terrorist was the deputy of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the 
fugitive al-Jihad commander who lives abroad, and the group's 
top man in charge of organization inside Egypt. As described by 
a senior official in the security organs, he was the most senior 
member inside the country and was worth a thousand ordinary 
members. 
  It was Shulah who planned the attempted assassination of 
Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. He used to follow him daily 
from his house to his Interior Ministry office so as to prepare 
the plan well. It was Shulah who prepared the members who took 
part in the ambush and the one who convinced one of those 
involved in the crime to undertake the suicidal explosion, 
blowing himself to pieces. 'Adil Siyam's control of his aides 
was so awesome that he imprisoned Diya'-al-Din Dawud Mahmud 
Hafiz, who later carried out the suicidal attack on the interior 
minister, in a locked room for 30 consecutive hours to mentally 
prepare him for the crime, only letting him out to perpetrate 
the crime. It was Shulah who planned to attack Prime Minister 
Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, assassinate Information Minister Safwat 
al-Sharif, and UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali during his 
visit to Egypt. His last crime was to plan the assassination of 
the primary witness in Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's case. The witness was 
killed when extremists shot him in the car showroom he owned in 
Shibin al-Qanatir. 
  Notorious terrorist 'Adil lived in the al-Basatin quarter 
but 
moved between dozens of dens in al-Munib, the outskirts of 
al-Qalyubiyah, al-Khankah, Shibin al-Qanatir, and the Bilbays 
desert. He only held an intermediate trade certificate but 
dressed elegantly and wore "RayBan" sunglasses and an elegant 
leather jacket. He spent money freely and drove around in seven 
different cars, all of them stolen. 
  In his various dens security men seized enough explosives to 
blow up an entire city. In two apartments in al-Munib, they 
seized police, officers, and garbage collectors' uniforms, which 
he intended for his group members use when committing terrorist 
crimes. Terrorist 'Adil Siyam's boldness even reached the extent 
of preparing a number of his followers, dressed in municipal 
workers' uniforms, to dig 12 metres across Salah Salim Street at 
a specific spot, which was carefully chosen site for detonating 
explosives in a major operation he was planning. The terrorists 
wearing the municipal workers uniforms did in fact dig up the 
street, lay down electricity cables, and connect them to a 
secret hideout under the street which was to be the center for 
detonating a explosive device to destroy any target that might 
be using that road. Regrettably, no one noticed that those 
digging up the road were terrorists and not municipal workers or 
electricians. 
  The security men also seized an underground factory for 
making explosives in the Bilbays desert. A long tunnel led to a 
spacious hall, where the security men found a number of barrels 
containing acid and chemicals that are used to make explosive 
devices. They also seized 500 grenades that were ready for use. 
  The notorious terrorist was under the security men's close 
observation for a long time. But they preferred to let him stay 
free so as to capture all the members of the organization and 
expose their plans and dens. The security organs did in fact 
arrest 32 persons, including seven hardened criminals who were 
being prepared to carry out suicidal operations similar to the 
attempt to assassinate Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. The 
security organs also discovered the means and ways by which 
these groups were financed from abroad. Most of the remittances 
that 'Adil Siyam received came from Palermo, capital of the 
Italian island of Sicily, to an Egyptian bank. The security 
organs monitored their account numbers and balances. The 
remittances that this terrorist received from Palermo alone in 
the last five weeks totalled $14,000, 4,000 pounds Sterling, and 
a few thousand Egyptian pounds, all of which was seized in his 
dens. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In a report citing Amman Radio and attributed to an 
Iraqi official, MENA said a short while ago that the Iraqi 
authorities have detained a Lebanese diplomat in Baghdad in 
retaliation for the Lebanese Government's measures against the 
Iraqi diplomats who were accused of assassinating Shaykh Talib 
al-Suhayl al-Tamimi. The Iraqi official did not mention the 
name of the Lebanese diplomat. 
  It should be noted that only one diplomat was serving at the 
Lebanese Embassy in Baghdad. He is Charge d'Affaires Sa'd 
Dakhya, who was summoned to Beirut on the second day of the 
crime and before the Council of Ministers made its decision to 
break off diplomatic relations with Baghdad. The Foreign 
Ministry has stated that there are no Lebanese diplomats in Iraq 
at present. 
  Commenting on the Iraqi report, Foreign Minister Faris 
Buwayz 
said a short while ago: I have been informed of the report, but 
we have no Lebanese diplomats in Iraq. 
  Minister Buwayz then left his office at the Foreign Ministry 
for B'abda Palace for a meeting with President Ilyas al-Hirawi 
and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri. 
  It should be noted that there are five locally hired 
Lebanese 
citizens at the Lebanese Embassy in Baghdad who have no 
diplomatic status. They carry special identity cards from the 
Iraqi Foreign Ministry.

  [Excerpts] [Dallul] The cabinet held its weekly session 
under His Excellency Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri at 1700 
today in the Government House. The prime minister began the 
session by highlighting the government's insistence on handing 
over the two Iraqi defendants to the judicial authorities to

He also reviewed the reactions to the decision. The cabinet 
then discussed the items on its agenda. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Did the cabinet discuss the workers' living 
conditions and demonstrations? 
  [Dallul] We are always discussing this issue. The cabinet's 
decision is to ban demonstrations. This decision remains in 
effect and will not be rescinded, because it serves the 
interests of the people and Lebanon. We will confront whatever 
harms Lebanon's interests. We will not let such things pass, 
whatever the consequences.

  [Text] Following the Lebanese Government's decision to 
sever diplomatic relations with Iraq as a result of the killing 
of Shaykh Talib Suhayl al-Tamimi, the following Iraqi diplomats 
were deported at 1015 today: Charge d'Affaires 'Awad Fakhri and 
Attaches Salam 'Ayid Makhul and Samir Ahmad 'Ali Husayn. 
  The Iraqi diplomatic mission arrived at Beirut International 
Airport in an Iraqi Embassy vehicle at 0845 today. The mission 
was immediately escorted with extremely stringent security 
measures by Lebanese security forces. The mission members were 
transported to a Royal Jordanian Airline plane, which was 
scheduled to take off at 0930. But the take-off was delayed 
until 1015. 
  Men from the local and foreign press were not allowed to 
approach or talk to the mission members in view of the stringent 
security measures.

embassy employee Hadi Hassun al-Najm, who had intended to travel 
to Jordan along with the three diplomats, have been handed over 
to the Internal Security Forces. 
  Two arrest warrants had been issued against Consul Darwish 
and employee al-Najm on charges of taking part in the murder of 
Shaykh Talib Suhayl al-Tamimi. Thus the number of Iraqis 
arrested on charges of committing the murder or taking part in 
it rises to four [as heard].

<F P=106> ["On the Road" column by Talal Salman: "Diplomatic Killing </F>
and Sectarian Dialogue"] 
  [Excerpt] A diplomatic identity card is not an indulgence 
or a certificate of good conduct. 
  Killing is killing. Justifying it, as in the case of Shaykh 
Talib Suhayl al-Tamimi, is worse than the killing itself. The 
abhorrence of the crime is not lessened by a heated legal debate 
on diplomatic immunity and how to deal with the crimes committed 
by diplomats. 
  It saddens the Lebanese that the Iraqi regime, after all the 
disasters brought about by its policy of internal oppression and 
its subjection to foreign humiliation, should insist on pursuing 
its opponents with silencer-equipped guns and bombs from 
diplomatic bags while allowing foreign inspection committees to 
raid their presidential palace, besiege the Defense Ministry, 
humiliate the Iraqi Army every minute, and dictate to the tyrant 
his pocket money and his movements on land, sea, and air. 
  It is just as sad for Iraq and the Iraqis as it is for 
Lebanon and the Lebanese (and all Arabs). 
  After all the oppression, coercion, humiliation, starvation, 
and mass killing of Iraqis at home, death squads are formed to 
pursue those who could not bear the humiliation of estrangement 
and went abroad! Has this great people been condemned to mass 
execution? 
  It is futile to blame Saddam Husayn for what he is 
doing--yet 
again, against Lebanon. Surely, his mercy for Lebanon and the 
Lebanese is not greater than his mercy for Iraq and the Iraqis. 
  What is shocking, however, is that there is no authority to 
take our complaints or grievances to in hopes that the oppressor 
will be deterred even morally. Perhaps this is one of the 
things that encourage him to carry on with his oppression. 
  Hence, the responsibility of the Government of Lebanon to 
directly protect people living in this country, using its own 
resources. 
  But this should not be used as an excuse for us not to 
succor 
political refugees, those fleeing the oppression of their 
rulers, or those who seek refuge among us to protect their 
families and, more importantly, to pursue their dream for change 
and their right to a homeland. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Hizballah representatives in the Lebanese Chamber of 
Deputies today accused U.S. Ambassador in Beirut Mark Hambley of 
interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs and insulting the 
sentiments of the Lebanese people. The deputies issued a 
statement pointing to the American ambassador's illogical 
movements and his threats to political trends in Lebanon. The 
statement says the American ambassador's moves violate 
diplomatic norms and aim to stand against the Lebanese Islamic 
and popular resistance against the Zionist occupier. The 
statement also stresses that recent military movements by the 
Zionist entity in south Lebanon are aimed at clearing that 
region of its inhabitants.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Appeal Attorney General Judge Munif </F>
'Uwaydat on 20 April--read by announcer] 
  [Text] Appeal Attorney General Judge Munif 'Uwaydat went to 
the Defense Ministry this afternoon where the investigating 
judge, Joseph Furayhah, is investigating the crime of the 
blowing up of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il. 
After studying the file, it became evident that the 
investigation into the church bombing has solved the following 
crimes: 
  1. The crime of the assassination of Engineer Dany Sham'un 
leader of the National Liberals Party and his family in B'abda 
on 21 October 1990. 
  2. The crime of blowing up the car of Minister Elie Hubayqah 
and the killing of his companion in al-Ashrafiyah in 1991. 
  3. The crime of the assassination of Dr. Ilyas al-Zayik in 
al-Ashrafiyah in 1989. 
  This is in addition to other crimes, which, together with 
the 
church bombing, remain under investigation. 
  The case of the assassination of Dany Sham'un and his family 
was immediately referred to the judicial investigator, Judge 
Munir Hunayn, together with the Appeal Prosecution Office's 
charge of attacks on the state's internal security, which 
resulted in the death of Engineer Sham'un, his wife, and two 
children. Orders for the arrest of the following were issued: 
  Hanna al-'Atiq, Robert Abu-Sa'b, Kamil Karam, Milhim Haddad, 
Marun Ghanim, Tony Musa, Walid Ja'ja', Rafiq Sa'adah, Fadi Sa'b, 
Simon Khiryati, Khalil Wakim, and Ilya Irz, who have been 
referred by Judge Furayhah. All of them belong to the Lebanese 
Forces' intelligence service. 
  The judge also ruled that orders for the arrest in absentia 
of those who were proven to be involved by the investigation 
carried out by Judge Furayhah be issued. They are: Ghassan 
Tuma, Tony 'Ubayd, 'Atif al-Habr, Jean Shahin, Jean Samiyah, 
Farid Sa'adah, Elie 'Awwad alias Juliano, Tony Sim'an, Naja 
al-Qaddum, George al- Fighali, Ilya 'Aqiqi, and Francis 'Aqiqi. 
All of the above belong to the Lebanese Forces' intelligence 
service. 
  Judge 'Uwaydat also issued charges against anyone shown by 
the investigations to be an active player, instigator, or 
participant in these crimes. He also asked that arrest warrants 
be issued for each one of the above wanted by the investigation 
as well as written subpoenas.

<F P=106> [Report by Nasir Shararah] </F>
  [Excerpt] According to well-informed political sources, 
Samir Ja'ja' [commander of the defunct Lebanese Forces] will be 
served with an arrest warrant within two weeks. 
  Legally an arrest warrant is no proof of guilt. But in this 
particular case such a warrant will indicate that the judiciary 
is virtually convinced of Ja'ja''s involvement in the bombing of 
Sayyidat al-Najat Church. 
  The fact that no warrant has been served on Ja'Ja' yet, the 
sources say, does not mean that his name did not come up during 
the investigations or that there are no grounds for indicting 
him. 
  The reason that no such warrant has been issued, the sources 
add, is because of the technical and security peculiarities of 
the case, as well as certain political and psychological 
considerations. 
  While mere suspicion would normally suffice for serving 
arrest warrants, both the judiciary and the Lebanese state are 
hesitant to issue such a warrant in this case without backing it 
with conclusive evidence, according to the same sources.

<F P=106> [Report by Antoine Constantine from Beirut] </F>
  [Text] Eyes turned to Damascus today, where Lebanese 
President Ilyas al-Hirawi has arrived for a summit with his 
Syrian counterpart, Hafiz al-Asad. Beirut observers await with 
extreme interest the practical results of this summit, on more 
than one level. Regionally, the Syrian-Lebanese summit comes 
before U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's expected 
visit to the Middle East and before the new round of bilateral 
talks between the Arabs and Israel. On internal Lebanese 
levels, the Syrian-Lebanese summit follows important 
developments in the Lebanese arena. The most important of these 
developments was the crime of blowing up the Sayyidat al-Najat 
Church and the subsequent political decisions, media and 
security measures, and the launching of legal cases, the most 
recent of which is the decision to try two Iraqis accused of 
killing an Iraqi oppositionist in Beirut. 
  At a time when the Lebanese Government is encountering 
opposition to its decision preventing electronic media from 
transmitting news, and preventing the General Federation of 
Trade Unions from staging demonstrations, the newspaper AL-DIYAR 
cited unnamed sources as saying President al-Hirawi's stand is 
in complete harmony with the Damascus position. He wants news 
and freedom of the press to be restored following his return to 
Beirut. Here, there is a difference between his stand and that 
of Prime Minister Rafiq al- Hariri. The same sources told 
AL-DIYAR that President al-Hirawi is not happy with the 
government as it is, taking into consideration Prime Minister 
al-Hariri's overwhelming majority in it. 
  At any rate, this is not the first time there has been talk 
about a cabinet reshuffle. Despite the talk about difference 
and alliances within the Council of Ministers, concerning major 
decisions the Lebanese Government has proved its consolidation. 
Its rejection of the expected workers' demonstration proves 
this.

  [Text] The Israeli enemy forces have committed another 
crime to add to their bloody record. At 1845 today, Israeli 
artillery located in 'Alman and al-Shumariyah bombarded the 
township of Frun. Hasan Hayik, 35, Dalal Hayik, 25, and Munirah 
Ahmad, 54, were martyred in the bombardment. Ahmad Hasan Hayik 
and Ibrahim Ja'far, 16, were slightly hurt and Muna Hayik was 
critically injured. They were all in the home of Qasim Bazzih, 
which was burned down. 
  The UN Interim Force in Lebanon [UNIFIL] deployed in 
al-Ghanduriyah prevented citizens from entering Frun because the 
town was still being shelled. 
  The Israeli forces also pounded the villages of Qa'qa'iyat 
al- Jisr, Zawtar al-Gharbiyah, and Zawtar al-Sharqiyah and the 
al-Litani River basin. The shelling was accompanied by Israeli 
helicopter flights over the al-Litani River basin.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, in </F>
Bucharest, by Hayim Zissowitz -- live] 
  [Text] [Zissowitz] Mr. Peres, we just spoke with a Gaza 
Strip settler about the issue of jurisdiction, namely: Where 
will Israelis who break the law in the autonomous areas be 
tried? Can you tell us what, if anything, was concluded with 
'Arafat on this issue? 
  [Peres] No, I am unable to tell you, because I would not 
like to issue forecasts before we have seen the written and 
signed documents. 
  [Zissowitz] What is Israel's position on this issue? Will 
it insist that Israelis who violate the law in the autonomous 
areas be tried in Israeli courts? 
  [Peres] The issue is more complicated than that. It depends 
on where the crime is committed and on its nature. It is more 
complicated than it sounds. 
  [Zissowitz] So it is not inconceivable that under certain 
circumstances, an Israeli who breaks the law could be tried by a 
Palestinian court? 
  [Peres] I do not want to get into this. I do not want to 
comment on issues that have not yet been finalized in writing. 
  [Zissowitz] What about Arabs who carry out attacks...? 
  [Peres, interrupting] Look, I do not want to get into the 
issue of jurisdiction, because at this very moment it is being 
discussed, and any rash comment could harm the negotiations. 
  [Zissowitz] Before your departure, you said that the POW and 
MIA issue will be at the top of your agenda. Did you discuss 
this issue with 'Arafat yesterday? 
  [Peres] Certainly. It was the first issue discussed. 
'Arafat reiterated what he termed his word of honor to Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. He reiterated his commitment to this 
promise. To his and to our great regret, since that time he has 
learned nothing new but rather encountered great difficulties. 
He will indeed continue to deal with this issue. 
  [Zissowitz] Zekharya Baumel's father Yona, who is known to 
be a cautious man, said 'Arafat knows more about the MIA's than 
he is willing to divulge in public. Is this your impression, 
too? 
  [Peres] No, I am not sure this is true. I am not sure he 
knows much more than he told the prime minister. 
  [Zissowitz] Will Israel be willing to consider the demand of 
the MIA's parents to delay the release of the Palestinian 
prisoners until more is known about the fate of the Israeli 
MIA's? 
  [Peres] Look, if we knew it was a matter of exerting 
pressure to obtain more information, we would not have hesitated 
to do so. We would have to be convinced, however, that such 
information can indeed be obtained only by exerting pressure. I 
am not convinced this is the case. 
  [Zissowitz] I assume that Yasir 'Arafat raised the demand to 
continue with the release of Palestinian prisoners, including 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] prisoners. Is this true? 
  [Peres] The issue was not presented in such a firm way. The 
Palestinians claim that Yasir 'Arafat is the leader of the 
entire Palestinian people and, as such, cannot discriminate 
between prisoners. I told him that we, too, are the 
representatives of all the Israelis, but an Israeli who is in 
prison is in prison. The fact that we are the representatives 
of all the Israelis does not mean that those who are in prison 
should be released. 
  [Zissowitz] What is Israel's position regarding the release 
of Hamas members? Will Israel insist...? 
  [Peres, interrupting] Our position is that people who say 
that they oppose the agreement and intend to continue carrying 
out terror acts should not be released. This is a very clear 
position. 
  [Zissowitz] Are there any circumstances under which Israel 
would agree to release Hamas members? 
  [Peres] Look, I do not want to get into the negotiations 
over the radio. These are issues that must be examined. Our 
basic position, however, is that people who are committed to the 
path of terrorism will not be released. 
  [Zissowitz] Are you implying that some kind of Hamas 
commitment to end terrorism could change Israel's position? 
  [Peres] Not a commitment, but if they actually change their 
behavior, this would be a different matter. Should Hamas 
declare that it no longer deals in terrorism and that it 
supports the agreement, this would constitute a new situation, 
but I do not believe we have reached this. I think the report 
that came from Jordan is aimed at creating a political 
smokescreen. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 21 April 
carries 
a recorded telephone interview with Foreign Minister Peres by 
Ya'el Dan, conducted on 21 April. Asked about reports on future 
cooperation between the PLO and Hamas, Peres answers: "To the 
best of my knowledge, such cooperation is not on the agenda. 
Apparently a dialogue is being maintained on a local basis, but 
there is no talk of formal and comprehensive cooperation between 
the two organizations."] 
  [Zissowitz] Is there any basis to Nabil Sha'th's statement 
yesterday regarding progress on the prisoners issue? Sha'th 
also said Major General Shahaq returned to Cairo with 
encouraging news from the Palestinians' point of view. 
  [Peres] I think there is a basis to this statement, but I 
must say that the mood in Bucharest is more reserved. I sat 
with 'Arafat for many hours, until late into the night. We had 
to overcome quite a few unjustifiable misunderstandings and 
doubts. There is still some gap between the mood in Cairo and 
that in Bucharest, and we still have to check why this is so. I 
sincerely hope this stems from not being updated on the latest 
news, or perhaps from an incorrect interpretation of this news. 
  [Zissowitz] You said you found 'Arafat troubled. What is he 
worried about? 
  [Peres] He is concerned about what he terms the slow 
progress in the negotiations. I emphasized that Israel is not 
the side responsible for slowing down the rate of progress. I 
told him that even if we conclude the negotiations at the 
beginning of May, the overall delay in the negotiations will not 
amount to more than 20 days. 
  [Zissowitz] Did he ask for any Israeli gestures to 
strengthen his position? 
  [Peres] He did not ask for gestures, but he does have more 
demands. 
  [Zissowitz] Such as? 
  [Peres] I do not want to go into this, because I am in the 
midst of the talks and am unwilling to hold public negotiations. 
  [Zissowitz] Mr. Peres, are there any difficulties that were 
not overcome in the meeting with 'Arafat and which could delay 
the completion of the negotiations? 
  [Peres] There are difficulties that still have to be 
overcome, but I believe this can be done. 
  [Zissowitz] Can you tell us what these difficulties are? 
  [Peres] We have still not finalized the issues of airspace 
and territorial waters. The issue of jurisdiction has still not 
been wrapped up and signed. There is still the issue of the 
council and its powers and the registration of Gaza Strip 
residents. As you know, the residents of Judaea and Samaria, as 
opposed to those of the Gaza Strip, possess Jordanian passports. 
These are issues that still must be dealt with seriously. 
  [Zissowitz] Nabil Sha'th said that the Cairo talks will be 
concluded next week and that after that, all that will remain is 
to prepare for the signing ceremony. Do you share his optimism? 
  [Peres] I share his hope, and I think it is possible. It is 
still only a hope, however, and I am convinced that we, for our 
part, and I believe the Palestinians, too, will exert supreme 
efforts to reach the stage of an honorable conclusion, which 
will actually be a new beginning. 
  [Zissowitz] Are you scheduled to hold more meetings today, 
other than with 'Arafat? 
  [Peres] Yes, this morning we will meet with 'Arafat again. 
We will also meet with the president of Romania, and another 
three or four meetings are planned as well.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Apr (MENA)--The Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations resumed this morning in Cairo. The objective of 
these negotiations is to remove the obstacles that are hindering 
the implementation of the autonomy agreement in Gaza and 
Jericho. Some progress has been made in the Civilian Affairs 
Committee meetings, but the negotiations continue to go around 
in an empty circle. 
  Responsible Palestinian sources said that the obstacles, 
which are considered the responsibility of the Security Affairs 
Committee, consist basically of a matter of phrasing because the 
two delegations are currently writing up the general agreement. 
This is why they have returned to the issues they had discussed 
in the previous negotiations, whether in Taba or in Cairo. 
  The same sources said that the Civilian Affairs and Legal 
Affairs Committees will resume their meetings later today. 
  The Palestinian sources noted that some progress has been 
made in the meetings of the Civilian Affairs Committee. 
Agreement has been reached over transferring the water 
authority, as well as over the basic principles of 
communications and radio frequencies for security and civilian 
purposes. 
  The Palestinian and Israeli negotiators had agreed during 
their negotiations in Taba within the framework of the Civilian 
Affairs Committee to set up two Palestinian television stations. 
MENA has learned that there are basic obstacles facing the 
course of the Security and Legal Affairs Committees. 
  Regarding the Legal Affairs Committee, the Palestinian side 
rejects the paper Israel submitted at the end of the last round 
on the legal jurisdiction of the Palestinian autonomy 
authorities, as well as the definition of who is Israeli and how 
to apply the law on such a person if he commits a crime in the 
Palestinian autonomy areas, and what happens if foreigners 
commit crimes in these areas. 
  The sources added that if Israel does not accept the legal 
jurisdiction of the Palestinian autonomy, this means that in 
practical terms the Palestinian sovereignty over these areas 
becomes null and void. 
  The Palestinian sources pointed out that with respect to the 
Security Affairs Committee, the negotiations continue to revolve 
in an empty circle of arguments and counter-arguments regarding 
the security of the settlements, joint patrols on the lateral 
roads, and the agricultural land around the settlements which 
Israel wants to annex to these settlements under security 
pretexts. This means that the Palestinians will abandon around 
47 percent of their territories and their security 
responsibilities between the autonomy areas in Gaza and Jericho 
on the one hand, and Israel on the other. 
  Palestinian sources in the Security Affairs Committee have 
described the negotiations as complicated. They address all 
issues that are raised in every round. 
  According to the same sources, going back to these issues 
forms part of the framework of formulating the general agreement. 
  The same Palestinian sources said that General Amnon Shahaq, 
Israeli deputy chief of staff and head of the Israeli 
delegation, was forced to leave Cairo yesterday evening for 
Israel to inform Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres of the course of the negotiations 
and the results they have reached so far. This comes before the 
expected meeting on Thursday and Friday in Bucharest between 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres. 
  In another development, sources from the Palestinian 
delegation denied that Israel has gone back on its promise to 
release 5,000 of the 10,400 Palestinian detainees, as was 
announced at the end of last week's round of negotiations. 
  Some sources had mentioned that Israel wants to release only 
4,000 detainees instead of the 5,000. 
  The same sources believe that the Palestinian side is still 
negotiating to release all the Palestinian detainees within a 
general and comprehensive amnesty on Israel's part so that a 
basis of mutual confidence between the Palestinian and the 
Israeli people can be established. 
  The Palestinian sources mentioned that Israel is currently 
refusing to release the Hamas detainees who carried out 
operations against the Israeli authorities after signing the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles on 13 September in 
Washington. They also refuse to release those who have carried 
out operations killing Israelis. 
  On the other hand, other diplomatic sources believe that the 
announcement by Hamas that it is ready to recognize Israel on 
condition that it withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
removes all Israeli settlements, and that it hold real elections 
for the Palestinians, comes after the three operations Hamas 
carried out in Israel in response to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre in Hebron. 
  These sources believe that these operations were a political 
message to start political dialogue with Israel after Hamas has 
realized the importance of taking part in the political process 
from inside the Palestinian political institution, not from 
outside. 
  The same sources said that this proves the honesty and 
soundness of the PLO's political course.

  [Text] Talks between Israel and the Palestinians in Cairo 
are making appreciable headway. From Cairo this report by our 
correspondent to the talks, 'Umar Zaydani: 
  [Begin recording] [Zaydani] The Civilian Committee concluded 
its work, and an agreement is now being drafted before it is 
presented to Amnon Shahaq and Nabil Sha'th for ratification. A 
short while ago, Dr. Sha'th spoke to us: 
  [Sha'th] The Civilian Committee yesterday worked late into 
the night, until 0300, and completed all its work. However, the 
papers on which initital agreement was reached have to be 
ratified by me and General Shahaq, who is in Israel and is 
expected back at 1200. The two sides may be able to finalize 
agreement on the transfer of all civilian powers this afternoon, 
after they introduce the necessary amendments. The Legal 
Committee is moving very slowly, with the jurisdiction 
[al-Wilayah] problem being the main sticking point. As for the 
Civilian Committee, it registered some progress this morning. I 
think it should be possbile for us to deal with some papers that 
have been pending since the past week, and thus move to finalize 
subjects on which agreement is possible, in the hope of 
addressing the tougher issues, like the jurisdiction. 
  [Zaydani] Nabil Sha'th says the Civilian Committee is 
addressing some details, including the entry of the Palestinian 
police force, the withdrawal of the Israeli Defense Force, and 
the crossings between Israel and Gaza and Jericho. 
  [Sha'th] Some of the papers have failed to address certain 
details, like the entry of the Palestinian police and the 
Israeli withdrawal, road zoning, and the crossings between 
Israel and Gaza. I think these points may be finalized this 
evening. 
  [Zaydani] On the water issue, Dr. Sha'th said the 
Palestinians will have exclusive control of water in Gaza and 
Jericho. Water for the settlements will be brought over from 
Israel, Nabil Sha'th says. 
  [Sha'th] The water in Gaza and Jericho will be fully under 
Palestinian control. The drilling of new wells and maintenance 
of existing wells will also fall under the authority of the 
Palestinians. Israel will continue to bring water from Israel 
to the settlements and also to Gaza; we will be charged only the 
cost of the water that we will get from Israel. The water bound 
for the settlements will transit land under our sovereignty. 
The Israeli (Makarot) company will continue to supply the 
settlements with water. The settlement consumption of water 
will not exceed the present ceiling. These are the fundamental 
points. The details will be announced when we sign the paper. 
  [Zaydani] Thus water and its control -- one of the stubborn 
problems that have blocked the path of the negotiations over the 
past few days -- is now out of the way. There remain problems 
to be worked out by the Legal Committee, like the legal 
jurisdiction in the self-rule areas. The Legal Committee is 
making progress. The Security Committee's two subcommittees 
will draw up a timetable for the release of Palestinian 
detainees. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] On at least five separate issues Israel and the 
PLO have now reached agreements at their talks in Cairo. 
[passage omitted] 
  The chief Israeli negotiator, Amnon Shahaq, spent the 
morning 
in Jerusalem, completing a round of consultations before 
returning to Cairo. 
  Under the agreement on water, the Gaza Strip and settlements 
will get their supplies from the Israeli Meqorot Company. The 
Palestinian autonomous authority which is to pay for the water 
it gets from Israel has also undertaken to maintain quality 
standards. Details were given by the chief Palestinian 
negotiator, Nabil Sha'th. 
  Norway and the PLO are trying to persuade the World Bank to 
finance projects in Gaza and Jericho regardless of the progress 
of the peace talks. Palestinian negotiator Sa'ib 'Urayqat and 
Norway's UN ambassador are concentrating their efforts to raise 
funds in the United States for sewage, medical, and other 
projects for the autonomy period. 
  Israel is insisting that industrial concerns in the 
autonomous areas comply with ecology standards. The request, 
originated by Israeli industrialists, was put to the 
Palestinians at the multilateral committee meetings on the 
environment. One of the Israeli concerns is that pollution will 
be caused by the unsupervised flow of sewage into a nearby 
aquifer or a natural underground water reservoir. 
  We have just received a report from Cairo. It is in fact 
Jamil al-Tarifi, the head of the PLO's committee for civilian 
matters. He is speaking to Moti Amir in Cairo about agreements 
the two sides have reached so far: 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Tarifi] We finished the whole 
negotiations at civilian committee, and we already agreed about 
all the papers, and we transfer the whole authorities to the 
Palestinian national authority. 
  [Amir] How many issues? 
  [Al-Tarifi] It's 38 issues, and we already finished it 
yesterday, at 0400 morning. 
  [Amir] Including the water? 
  [Al-Tarifi] Including the water, including everything. 
  [Amir] And you are satisfied about the water? It was a long 
discussion yesterday. 
  [Al-Tarifi] Yes. It's not only the water. Many issues took 
long discussions. The water -- we have the full authority on 
Gaza Strip and Jericho area, and we have the right to 
development our resources and to drilling our wells. In the 
meantime, the wells inside the settlements is under the control 
of Meqorot Company, but we have to know exactly how many wells 
they have. And, we have to know, in monthly basis, how many 
cubic meters they will pump from these wells. [end recording]

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the negotiations with Israel on the 
implementation of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, has announced 
that the Civilian Affairs Committee completed all its work at 
dawn today and that the results will be forwarded to the heads 
of the two delegations for adoption. 
  Sha'th told reporters: We can reach an agreement today after 
introducing some necessary amendments concerning the transfer of 
all civilian powers. This agreement will then be adopted by 
myself, as head of the Palestinian delegation, and by General 
Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation. 
  On the broad lines of the agreement on the transfer of water 
authority, Dr. Sha'th said the agreement stipulates that water 
and its full management in Gaza and Jericho come under 
Palestinian control. This includes the drilling of new wells 
and the management of old ones, he said. 
  He said Israel will continue to supply Gaza and the 
settlements with water. The Palestinians will pay Israel the 
cost of the water they receive, he said, adding: The water that 
will go to the settlements will pass through our territory and 
will be under our jurisdiction but the Israeli company of 
Meqorot will continue to supply the settlers with water. 
  He said the settlements will receive the same amount of 
water 
they are receiving now. These, Sha'th explained, are the main 
points of the agreement but the details of the transfer of water 
authority will be announced when the agreement is signed. 
  Sha'th said the Israelis will have control inside the 
settlements as stated by the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles signed in Washington on 13 September. 
  Noting that water supplies cannot be divided, he said 
information will be exchanged on the use of water, meters, and 
so on. 
  The aim, Sha'th said, is to reach an agreement that 
preserves 
our water resources, endangered during the years of occupation. 
He said the current level of salinity is dangerously high. 
  Sha'th said: I expect that the new Palestinian leadership 
will focus attention on preserving and promoting water resources. 
  Sha'th said the Legal Affairs Committee is making extremely 
slow progress, with the problem of legal jurisdiction still not 
solved. 
  Concerning the Security Affairs Committee, he said, some 
progress has been made and work on some papers that have been 
pending since last week may be completed this afternoon. 
  On the progress made in the Security Affairs Committee, 
Sha'th explained that the negotiators worked out some details 
concerning the Palestinian police, the detailed Israeli 
withdrawal plan, some measures concerning the demarcation of the 
border and the Palestinian self-rule regions, and some measures 
concerning roads, joint patrols, and crossing points between 
Israel and Gaza. He said these issues could be completed this 
evening. 
  Sha'th said there are several civilian and security papers 
as 
well as the 24-point general agreement that serves as an 
introduction to the various issues contained in the appendices. 
He said four out of the 24 points in this agreement remain to 
be dealt with. They include the legal jurisdiction. He 
stressed that the general agreement cannot be completed without 
finishing with the legal jurisdiction issue. 
  Sha'th said he could not speculate on when the negotiations 
would be complete. This, he said, depends on the other side. 
  Muhammad Dahlan, a member of the Palestinian delegation and 
head of the Detainees and Confidence-Building Committee, said an 
initial agreement to release 5,000 detainees in the next stage 
has been reached. He said negotiations will continue to reach a 
final agreement through two subcommittees to release the rest of 
the detainees. 
  But a responsible Palestinian source said Israel fears 
releasing the rest of the detainees in the absence of the 
Palestinian authority and it fears that the release may have a 
negative security impact on the Israelis. 
  Dahlan said that all the Palestinians deported during the 
intifadah will be returned. 
  He said that 54 deportees have already returned, six of them 
yesterday. Eleven more will return to Gaza through Cairo 
tomorrow, Thursday, he said.

  [Text] Cairo, April 20 (AFP)--Israeli and PLO negotiators 
Wednesday [20 April] sought an agreement on the return of all 
Palestinians deported by Israel since the start of the intifadah 
in December 1987, a member of the PLO delegation said. 
  Muhammad Dahlan, in charge of the prisoner file in the 
talks, 
said 11 deportees would return to the occupied territories 
Thursday, following six self-exiled PLO militants who went back 
on Tuesday. 
  The two sides are negotiating a general amnesty for all 
Palestinian militants wanted by Israel, a Palestinian source 
said. 
  Israel has expelled 1,700 Palestinians since the 1967 Middle 
East war and more than 450 have been allowed back. 
  Of the 486 deported since the uprising started in December 
1987, 415 were expelled to south Lebanon for a year in December 
1992, but have been allowed to return. 
  Dahlan said Israel had also reaffirmed its commitment to 
free 
5,000 Palestinian prisoners after the signing of an overall 
autonomy accord. 
  The pledge was in line with an agreement reached last week, 
but the PLO Tuesday accused Israel of refusing to set a date for 
freeing 1,000 of the prisoners. 
  Israel's chief negotiator General Amnon Shahaq returned to 
the talks Wednesday, after a brief trip to Israel where he 
informed Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of the progress of the 
negotiations. 
  Peres is due to meet PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat in Bucharest 
Thursday and said the agenda would depend on progress in Cairo. 
  In addition to discussing the return of deportees and 
prisoner releases, the two sides were also seeking agreement 
Wednesday on water sharing and jurisdiction in the future 
autonomous areas of the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. 
  In the past few days Israel has arrested several hundred 
Islamic fundamentalist suspects in a bid to break up the Hamas 
network and halt bloodshed. 
  Security officials said the crackdown would continue in the 
coming days and offices used by the Islamic Resistance Movement 
Hamas would be closed. 
  Palestinian sources said nearly 500 had been detained since 
last Friday. 
  Police Minister Moshe Shahal told parliament 362 
Palestinians 
had been arrested since Monday in the swoop, which follows the 
killing of 12 Israelis in suicide bombings by Hamas on April 6 
and 13. 
  Dahlan said Israel had adopted a tougher line following the 
attacks. 
  "The Israelis fear that without a Palestinian authority the 
release of detainees will have negative effects on Israeli 
security," he said.

  [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the head of the Palestinian 
delegation to the Cairo talks, says this evening that a 
breakthrough has been achieved in the deliberations of the Legal 
Committee. Progress was also made in the Security Committee on 
three issues which had already been noted down in the draft 
agreement of the two delegations. Dr. Sha'th also expressed his 
belief that next week may be the last week of the talks. He 
told our correspondent in Cairo, Moti Amir that the answers 
brought by Major General Shahaq from Jerusalem today enable the 
sides to make rapid progress in the negotiations. Another 
meeting will take place between Sha'th and Shahaq tonight, in 
which Sha'th will receive a written document containing the 
Israeli proposals. Sha'th says that these proposals are very 
close to the formulation of the Declaration of Principles with 
regard to the jurisdiction powers of the autonomy authorities, 
but he refused to elaborate.

  [Excerpt] Difficulties in the negotiations with the 
Palestinians in Paris: The chief Israeli and PLO delegates to 
the economic talks, Finance Minister Avraham Shohat and 
Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], held another tete-a-tete this 
afternoon in an effort to overcome the outstanding problems. 
Our correspondent Eldad Beck reports from Paris: 
  Both the Israeli and the Palestinian delegations realized 
last night that the fundamental discrepancies between their 
stands on the main unresolved problem -- import regime and 
customs -- are unbridgeable. The sides failed to reach 
compromise despite the vigilant participation in the discussions 
of the two chief delegates, who are again meeting tete-a-tete at 
this very moment. 
  We have learned from the Israeli delegation that the 
negotiating teams are treading water and that the positive 
atmosphere, which prevailed past week, has changed noticeably. 
  In view of the difficulties, and since both sides realize 
they will be unable to reach an agreement this week, the current 
round of talks is expected to end tomorrow as planned. 
  The issue of the import regime and customs got stuck over 
the 
question of whether the sides should reach a basic agreement on 
this matter, working out the details on the basis of this, or 
whether they should start immediately discussing the list of 
products to which import regulations and customs rates will 
apply. The Palestinians are insisting on deciding on their own 
customs for numerous items of equipment for the industrial and 
agricultural development of the territories. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Nadim Kawash] </F>
  [Text] Muscat, April 19 (AFP) -- Delegates on Tuesday [19 
April] ended their most successful round of multilateral Middle 
East negotiations on water, agreeing on five projects to boost 
scarce supplies and establish Israeli-Arab cooperation. 
  The participants from more than 40 countries and 
organisations also approved offers by several industrial states 
to provide technical assistance and training to the region to 
enable it to ease a chronic water shortage. 
  Oman's proposal for setting up a water desalination research 
centre won unanimous approval and a committee would be formed to 
carry out the project. 
  "As a first step to enhancing water supplies, the working 
group approved an Omani proposal for a desalination research and 
technology centre in Muscat," a statement said. 
  Delegates described the water committee's fifth round as the 
most successful since the negotiations began two years ago in 
Vienna as part of the multilateral phase of Middle East talks 
launched in Madrid in 1991. 
  But the final session hit a snag when Jordan, attending as 
an 
observer, threatened to oppose the meeting's decisions if the 
United States did not raise the issue of its boycott at the 
talks. 
  Jordan is boycotting meetings with Israel to press Western 
forces to ease their naval interceptions off the port of Aqaba 
under the UN embargo of Iraq. 
  Delegates said the final session was held up for more than 
six hours as Palestinians and other Arab delegates mediated to 
end the standoff by holding contacts with the US representative 
and Jordan's observer Ali al-Ghazzawi. 
  "Al-Ghazzawi insisted he would deliver a speech demanding 
that the US delegates mention the reason for Jordan's absence 
from the talks," a conference source said. 
  "He threatened to express reservations on the results at the 
meeting and to refer them to the Jordanian government. This 
could mean that the decisions of the meeting were not reached by 
consensus." 
  The sources said the problem was resolved following 
intensive 
contacts between Washington and Amman. 
  The statement said the other four projects covered a US 
proposal for waste water treatment and re-use facilities in the 
region, an Israeli proposal to rehabilitate municipal water 
supply systems, a German study on supply and demand, and a joint 
US-European Union training programme. 
  It said the participants supported the idea of enhancing 
data 
availability in the region and welcomed the announcement of the 
creation of a Palestinian Water Authority (PWA). 
  "The Israeli delegation welcomed the announcement of the PWA 
and expressed an interest in working with the Omani research 
centre on solar energy for desalination," the statement said. 
  It said the participants approved an Israeli proposal to 
rehabilitate and make more efficient municipal water supply 
systems in small-sized committees. Experts from concerned 
parties will be convened to plan the next steps, it added. 
  Delegates at the three-day talks, opened by Omani Minister 
of 
State for Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin-Alawi bin-'Abdallah, [title 
as received] said most of the funds for the projects would be 
provided by Japan and other key industrial nations once the 
agreements were signed. 
  "We are very happy with this meeting," an Israeli delegate 
said. "Results like these will encourage all of us to press on 
with moves to establish confidence and cooperation in the 
region."

<F P=106> [Report by Moti Bassok from Oman] </F>
  [Excerpt] Senior Omani officials yesterday told Deputy 
Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin: "Your visit to Oman shocked our 
elite. The argument here over whether to establish relations 
with you now has become legitimate. The moment there is peace, 
the Gulf states will have deeper and more serious relations with 
Israel than your neighbors, because we do not harbor any 
residual hatred for Israel." 
  The next session of the water talks will apparently be held 
in Kuwait in October. This will be the first time Kuwait hosts 
an official Israeli delegation. 
  The fifth round of the multilateral water talks ended 
yesterday. All the delegations will conduct a tour of Oman today 
and then return to their respective capitals. 
  In a meeting Beilin and senior Omani officials held to sum 
up 
the Israeli visit, the hosts admitted that they had greatly 
feared hosting the Israeli delegation and disclosed that various 
Arab elements had pressured them to change their mind about 
hosting the water talks. The Omani officials said that they had 
feared that Israel would use the visit for propaganda purposes 
and to infiltrate the Arab world. 
  In the beginning they attempted unsuccessfully to lower the 
profile of the visit. Now, on the eve of the country-wide tour, 
they feel much better and their attitude toward Israel has 
changed. Oman has not fallen in love with Israel, but its 
government now realizes that Israelis do not have horns, and 
both countries have joint interests and can cooperate. 
  The local press has also joined in the publicity. Omani 
citizens know that an Israeli delegation is visiting their 
country. The question of whether or not this visit is followed 
up depends to a great deal on the continuation of the peace 
process. In principle, Oman harbors no hatred toward Israel, 
like the Palestinians for example, although Israel is still 
considered an enemy. 
  Dr. Beilin pointed out that in all his meetings, he was 
constantly told that Syria is the key to peace in the Middle 
East and that the Gulf states would immediately establish 
relations with Israel once its problems with Syria were 
resolved. The Omanis also tentatively explored whether Israel 
could further their interests in the White House and on 
Washington's Capitol Hill. Officials in Muscat are concerned 
about a possible erosion in their economic ties with the West 
due to U.S. complaints about human rights violations. 
  Beilin noted that Israeli desalination experts would arrive 
in Muscat and that Omani experts would later conduct a 
reciprocal visit. What is on the agenda is long-term 
cooperation. Oman also seeks Israel's help in training 
professional workers to replace the foreign workers in Oman: 
the Indian managers and the blue-collar Thai workers. 
  Oman expects Israel to help it with marketing its products. 
Today, 95 percent of its exports are shipped through Dubai 
marketing chains. This dependency constitutes a heavy burden on 
Muscat. In the view of Omani officials, Israel, with its 
proven marketing capabilities and experience, can help Oman set 
up independent marketing chains. Oman hopes that Israel will 
assist in developing tourism, a field which has lain dormant so 
far despite its great potential. Jerusalem will also send 
medical and agricultural experts to Oman and help convert local 
industry to several hi-tech branches. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpt] Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, head of the 
Israeli delegation to the talks with Syria, has been holding 
secret talks with Walid al-Mu'allim, Syria's ambassador in 
Washington, with the aim of furthering the peace negotiations 
between the two states. The meetings between the two ambassadors 
were held parallel to the official rounds of talks between the 
two states in Washington and in between rounds. 
  The meetings were attended by senior officials from the U.S. 
State Department dealing with the peace process. Some of the 
meetings were held at the home of Edward Djerejian when he was 
assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs. Dennis 
Ross, head of the American peace team, participated in some of 
the meetings. 
  When Rabinovich took up his post as ambassador in Washington 
in early 1993, Jerusalem hoped he would maintain a secret track 
with his counterpart, Ambassador Mu'allim, who was seen as more 
flexible and possessing more contacts with the Syrian top 
echelon than Muwaffaq al-'Allaf, head of the Syrian delegation 
to the bilateral peace talks. 
  Political sources in Jerusalem said yesterday that they 
believe that the Rabinovich-Mu'allim talks did not make much 
progress since neither received sufficient room to maneuver from 
their masters -- Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad. Nevertheless, the secret track is used 
to transmit messages between Jerusalem and Damascus and to 
assist in clarifying matters in the formal talks. [passage

<F P=106> [Report on interview with PLO Executive Committee Chairman </F>
Yasir 'Arafat by Franca Zambonini on 13 April; place not given: 
"Arafat: I Am Tired But I Will Not Give In"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Zambonini] How are you? 
  ['Arafat] I am tired. I spent a whole night on my feet to 
find out what was happening in Ramallah. [Arafat Ends] 
  At Ramallah a pregnant 18-year old Palestinian woman was 
killed in her kitchen by a stray bullet and a Palestinian 
building was blown up; fortunately there was nobody in it at the 
time. 
  For many years 'Arafat accused the West of enmity toward the 
Palestinians. He would say: "The West thought that Palestine 
was a land without a people that could be given to a people 
without a land in order to lessen its feeling of guilt over the 
Jews massacred by the Nazis." Or: "The West has ascribed to 
Israel all the virtues of the only civilized state in the Middle 
East and to the Palestinian people every kind of wickedness." 
  [Zambonini] What will your Palestine be like when peace 
comes? 
  ['Arafat] A holy land with three religions, divided into two 
states -- the Israeli and the Palestinian -- within a new Middle 
Eastern order. We will be able to start from scratch with 
international aid, by means of a plan similar, on a smaller 
scale, to the Marshall Plan, which rebuilt the defeated nations 
after World War II. If that does not happen, we will lapse into 
chaos, into a Balkanization of the Middle East. History shows 
us that wars start when justice is not implemented. To fail to 
resolve the problems means providing the fanatics and their 
groups with a pretext for violence. 
  [Zambonini] But do you not have the power to curb the 
extremist fringes? 
  ['Arafat] I cannot do anything before I enter Jericho. The 
authority is in Jericho. Today is 13 April. Can I say: This 
is the day of the Israeli withdrawal? No. It should have been. 
Instead, here I am. Yes, it is delays such as these that are 
the cause of the killings. 
  [Zambonini] In Cairo you signed an agreement with the 
Israelis for the establishment of a Palestinian police corps 
comprising 9,000 men armed with automatic rifles. Where are 
they? 
  ['Arafat] The police force exists only in theory, too. Arab 
countries have loaned me 10 Hercules aircraft to transport the 
policemen to the occupied territories, but hitherto not one of 
them has been able to enter. I wanted some of them to go 
immediately to Hebron, where people cannot move about freely and 
have to suffer a curfew because of the presence of 42 settler 
families. Yes, 42 Israeli families are keeping 120,000 
inhabitants of Hebron prisoner. The same applies in Gaza, where 
1 million Palestinians are the hostages of a mere 1,000 
settlers. It is situations such as these that inflame the 
fanatics on both sides, and the Palestinian people and the 
Israeli people are paying the price of their violence. 
Meanwhile, we produce declarations of condemnation instead of 
promptly implementing the agreements reached. It does not take 
courage to make war; it takes courage to make peace. 
  [Zambonini] Do you think that the Vatican could have a role 
to play in the peace talks? 
  ['Arafat] We consulted the pope to advance the peace 
process. 
We maintain contacts and meetings with Vatican representatives 
at all levels. Personally, I had the privilege of meeting with 
Monsignor Jean Louis Tauran, the Vatican foreign minister, and 
that meeting confirmed to me that the Vatican's role as a 
mediator between us is a very influential one. 
  [Zambonini] Do you think that the presence in Hebron of 160 
international observers, including 35 Italians, is useful? 
  ['Arafat] I have full confidence in them and in the task 
that 
has been assigned to them. I wish that there were many more, 
not only in Hebron, but also in Gaza, Jericho, and the rest of 
the territories. I pleaded on bended knee for the West to send 
out the international force envisaged by UN Security Council 
Resolution 904 to protect the Palestinian people during this 
difficult transition period. The United States said "no," as 
did many European nations. So hitherto only three countries have 
sent out observers -- Denmark, Norway, and Italy. Their 
presence, albeit small, is important as a sign of confidence and 
security. 
  [Zambonini] According to the agreements, there will be an 
election four months after the Israelis' withdrawal. Do you 
think that the PLO will be successful? 
  ['Arafat] I feel reassured by previous results. In the 
latest municipal elections 96 of the 116 people elected were on 
the PLO lists. Last month there were three elections on the 
Gaza Strip -- those for the medical, legal, and engineering 
councils -- and we achieved excellent results. Our democracy 
has asserted itself amid a forest of rifles. When at last we 
have peace -- a dream that I pursue without giving in to the 
difficulties -- free elections will be the culmination of a long 
revolutionary path.

have revealed to AL-BAYAN correspondent that Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres has sent a proposal to the PLO leadership 
containing Israel's approval of a declaration of establishing a 
Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip should the PLO agree to 
share subterranean water in the Palestinian territories 
proportional to the size of population, give up the Dead Sea 
bank in full to Israel, relinquish the heights overlooking the 
Jordan Valley in the West Bank, and announce its acceptance of 
Jerusalem as a united city under Israeli control, in addition to 
agreeing to the establishment of a military alliance between the 
Palestinian state and Israel. 
  These Palestinian leaders say that the Palestinian 
leadership 
is studying this proposal, and that a number of senior PLO 
officials support it.

  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 21 (AFP) -- 
The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas claimed responsibility 
Thursday [21 April] for ambushing two Jewish settlers who were 
wounded on the Gaza Strip. 
  Hamas announced in a statement that Wednesday's shooting was 
the "first, swift response against continued Israeli arrests of 
its members." 
  Israel has arrested nearly 500 Islamic fundamentalist 
suspects, according to Palestinian sources, in a bid to break up 
the Hamas network. About 240 were detained on the Gaza Strip 
alone this week. 
  Meanwhile, clashes continued on the strip. Soldiers shot and 
wounded three Palestinians in Gaza City and two more in nearby 
Jabaliya refugee camp, Palestinian sources said. 
  Military officials said two settlers driving a car near the 
Gush Katif settlement were shot by Palestinian gunmen on 
Wednesday evening. 
  "Two of our fighters ambushed a car carrying two settlers 
... 
the bullets of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam were awaiting them and our 
fighters opened fire on them using M-16 guns." 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam is the Hamas military wing. 
  The typed message warned that the operation, carried out by 
the "clandestine unit number 7," will be followed by others 
"with the dawn of every day, until the end of all occupation of 
our land." 
  HAMAS carried out two bus bombings this month killing 12 
Israelis in retaliation for the Hebron massacre of 30 Moslem 
worshippers by a Jewish settler.

  [Text] Gaza -- A prominent Gaza Strip Islamic official 
said on 19 April that Hamas expresses its readiness to negotiate 
with Yitzhaq Rabin's government if the Israelis prove the 
sincerity of their intentions by: abandoning their policy of 
killing innocent people; release all prisoners; lift the 
economic siege; announce the evacuation of settlers from 
settlements; and offer something worth negotiating about. 
  Ahmad Bahr, head of the Gaza Strip Islamic Society, added 
that these negotiations should be carried out under an 
independent Palestinian decision that ensures sovereignty and 
security for the Palestinians alone. The negotiations should 
also take place under international supervision so that it will 
be proven to the entire world that it is Israel which is 
persisting in obstructing any efforts aimed at achieving a 
comprehensive and just peace. 
  Bahr added: These negotiations must proceed within the 
framework of the strategy of Hamas and with the support of its 
leadership and leaders abroad, and be preceded by a truce 
between the Israelis and the Palestinians in order to ascertain 
the sincerity of Israeli intentions. 
  Bahr called on Rabin to change his hard-line and suppressive 
policy in the occupied territories -- a policy that is being 
implemented by the Israeli Army against defenseless civilians 
and which has led Hamas to retaliate in an exceptional way 
against Israeli civilians, as Hamas is not eager to kill 
civilians because this is forbidden by Islam. 
  Bahr believes that the resolution of this conflict lies in 
the hands of the Israelis who daily are committing massacres, 
destroying houses, and violating the human rights of 
Palestinians to live in freedom and peace on their soil and 
homeland.

  [Excerpt] Gaza -- Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, the official in 
charge of Fatah in the Gaza Strip, has said that meetings 
between Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] are 
continuing and will not stop. He stressed that the PLO will not 
accept Israel's interference in Palestinian internal affairs nor 
linking the meetings with the negotiations. 
  In an exclusive interview with AL-NAHAR, al-Agha said that 
the meetings are continuing and will not be halted and that the 
two sides are keen on continuing them because they serve the 
supreme Palestinian interest. 
  Al-Agha added that the aim of the meetings is to create a 
somewhat good relationship and ongoing coordination in order to 
overcome any problems and differences that arise between the two 
sides -- as a service to the Palestinian people. 
  The Palestinian official cautioned the Israeli media, which 
are trying to split the Palestinian rank. He denied the 
existence of any agreement under which Fatah is to carry out 
political action and Hamas military action. Al-Agha stressed 
that Fatah's relationship with Hamas is a crucial Palestinian 
strategy that concerns every Palestinian. The two sides will 
defend this strategy with all their power. 
  Al-Agha rejected Israeli threats against the PLO's 
cooperation with Hamas. He said that the PLO rejects any 
dictate from any party. Al-Agha also rejected Israel's attempt 
to link the continuation of the negotiations with putting an end 
to the meetings with Hamas. He said: This is blackmail that we 
reject and do not accept. No Palestinian will accept it.

<F P=106> [Report by Aharon Klein] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Palestinian general security services is one 
of the issues on which an agreement has been achieved. The 
Palestinian services' jurisdiction will apply throughout the 
territories. This constitutes a crucial -- possibly cardinal -- 
precedent. 
  This sphere of activity is the first in which PLO-Fatah has 
been granted freedom of action outside the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho area. The Palestinians will be able to set up preemptive 
intelligence offices in Nabulus, Tulkarm, Hebron, Ramallah, and 
other cities in the territories. Since both sides have a vested 
interest in the matter, an agreement in this spirit was recently 
attained in the Cairo talks. Although the Palestinians had 
reneged on a previously achieved agreement on the issue, a new 
agreement similar to the previous one has now emerged. 
  The Gaza Strip preemptive intelligence, or rather preemptive 
security (al-amn al-wiqa'i), will be headed by Muhammad Dahlan, 
member of the Palestinian delegation to the Cairo talks. 
'Arafat selected 34-year-old Dahlan, a native Gazan, for this 
pivotal, powerful, and consequential position because of his 
extensive connections with local activists. 
  Dahlan, who was deported at the beginning of 1987, had been 
one of the founders of the Fatah Shabibah [youth movement], and 
he had organized the mass disturbances which preceded the 
intifadah. He maintained his connections with Gaza Strip 
activists throughout the intifadah and while in Tunis. Dahlan 
had been put in charge of the military activities in the Gaza 
Strip, and this capacity plus his connections with the locals 
made him a central and powerful figure close to 'Arafat. 
Dahlan's appointment to the sensitive position undoubtedly 
reflects 'Arafat's full confidence in him. 
  The head of the preemptive intelligence in Judaea and 
Samaria 
will be Jibril al-Rajub. Al-Rajub, 41, a deportee since 1988, 
was born in the village of Dura in the Hebron District. As a 
Fatah activist, he was arrested for terrorist activity and 
served a prison sentence in Israel. He was released in 1986 in 
the framework of the "Jibril deal," immediately after which he 
resumed his Fatah activities, becoming one of Faysal 
al-Husayni's close aides. Al- Rajub cultivated extensive ties 
with local activists, as a result of which he became one of the 
central PLO-Tunis figures and an 'Arafat aide. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Doha--QNA--Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political 
Department, has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
saying that Rabin's present policy obstructs all approaches 
toward peace. 
  Warning Israel against mounting an act of aggression against 
Jordan in view of Rabin's inability to stop the intifadah, 
Qaddumi said that Rabin has been trying to hold Jordan 
responsible for his failure and added that if Israel does not 
withdraw very soon the struggle with the Palestinian forces will 
continue. 
  In a statement to the Qatari newspaper AL-SHARQ published 
yesterday, Qaddumi said that a new reality is now emerging in 
the arena of the Palestinian-Israeli struggle making all the 
Zionist dreams vanish and the greater Israel concept something 
of the past.

  [Text] An unpublicized Fatah Central Committee session 
convened on 17 April in Tunis, was devoted to a discussion of 
the makeup of the national authority due to take over in the 
self-rule areas once Israel withdraws. The meeting, according 
to informed Palestinian sources, also considered the logistics 
for the arrival of the authority's bureaucrats and police 
forces. The PLO is close to naming the members of the national 
authority, which will likely be composed of 18 members. Of 
these, seven will be PLO Executive Committee members, two Fatah 
members, another two diaspora Palestinians, and the balance 
technocrats from the territories occupied since 1967. 'Arafat, 
predict the same sources, will move to Jericho shortly and take 
up residence at the Hisham Palace Hotel, which will also serve 
as offices for the national authority, assuming a mechanism is 
agreed on for the implementation of the Declaration of 
Principles now being hammered out between the PLO and Israel in 
Cairo. 
  Meanwhile, a top Palestinian official disclosed to AL-ASWAQ 
that the configuration of the national authority has virtually 
been completed. The list will now be presented to the sponsors 
of the peace process and the Rabin government for clearance. 
  Over the past few days, the PLO has directed the Political 
Department's staff to be ready to travel for the self-rule areas 
next week. 
  In another development, an official in charge of the 
expellees affairs said the negotiating Palestinian team in Cairo 
yesterday got clearance from the Israelis for the return of 50 
exiles whom the PLO had demanded be allowed back at the first 
round of the Cairo talks. 
  The list has been handed to Yasir 'Arafat who, for unknown 
reasons, preferred to wait a few days before making it public. 
Israel radio said yesterday Israel has okayed the return of 17 
wanted Palestinians, whose repatriation, originally set for last 
Sunday, had been delayed for what was termed as purely technical 
reasons.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Brothers: As the negotiations get progressivly 
tougher, so the reality of Palestinian national will and the 
correctness of Palestinian decisions grows increasingly more 
visible. More importantly, so does the reality of the 
relentless and tireless struggle of the Palestinian people to 
achieve the Palestinian interpretation of the Declaration of 
Principles agreement so as to open the road to a Palestinian 
state. 
  It is out of the question for the negotiating teams to 
bargain away Palestinian rights. If anything, the negotiators 
are being firm and steadfast. This explains why the talks are 
proceeding by fits and starts and failing to reach workable 
solutions. This is because the Palestinian negotiating team is 
refusing to meet the Israeli negotiators' terms and sticking to 
its interpretation of the declaration of principles. Had the 
Palestinian negotiators been compromising and yielding to the 
terms and dictates of the Israeli negotiators, the knot would 
have long been untied and the talks would have proceeded 
smoothly, without experiencing these numerous interruptions. 
Had the Palestinian interlocutors been compromising, the 
negotiations would not have been so tough. 
  It is then high time some people reconsidered their stands 
and thought long and hard about the supreme national interests 
of the Palestinian people and looked at the Palestinian 
negotiators' national struggle in perspective -- the struggle 
that aims at laying the first bricks in the structure of the 
Palestinian state. It is time some people reconsidered their 
position and viewed things from the perspective of Palestinian 
interests and objectives and their ambitions to lead a free, 
dignified, and independent existence. It is high time they 
reconsidered their position and understood that talking to the 
Israelis puts an end neither to the conflict nor to history. 
Talking is a form of the conflict that we must adopt and then 
take whatever responsibilities this option entails. 
  At some point down the road, negotiations are the right 
course of action. Hopefully, some Palestinians will grasp this 
truth and adapt to changing times and the circumstances of the 
Palestinian national struggle. Hopefully, more Palestinians 
will come to grasp this truth and so contribute to a more 
cohesive Palestinian front. We will work to achieve that goal, 
since it is the only guarantee for our people to advance their 
objectives and their yearnings for the inevitable freedom and 
independence.

  [Text] Asyut, April 20 (AFP)--Islamic militants on 
Wednesday [20 April] shot dead a police general and his 
bodyguard in the fundamentalist hotbed of Asyut, police said. 
  Three militants gunned down General Shirin 'Ali Fahmi and 
his 
police bodyguard in a hail of automatic weapons fire which also 
wounded the general's driver. 
  The dying bodyguard managed to fire back and wound one of 
the 
militants, while the other two fled. The shooting occurred as 
Fahmi was leaving his home. 
  The general's wife witnessed the shooting from a balcony, 
tearing off window shutters and throwing them in a vain attempt 
to drive off the killers. 
  Security officials said the wounded gunman, Hasan Khalifah 
'Uthman, was a key member of the outlawed fundamentalist 
organization al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) in the 
region, a hotbed of Islamic militancy. 
  'Uthman, who was hospitalised, was wanted for a series of 
attacks, the most recent being the killing of a policeman in the 
Asyut region last week. 
  In a statement sent to AFP in Cairo, al-Jama'ah claimed 
responsibility for the latest killing and warned that "the 
liquidation of leading officials in the (interior) ministry is a 
cornerstone of our armed campaign." 
  The aim is to make the authorities "respect the rights of 
Muslims" and end their abuse of human rights in Egyptian 
prisons, the group said. 
  Fahmi, appointed police chief in Asyut for one year last 
August, was the second police general murdered this month. On 
April 9, the general leading the battle against Islamic 
militants, Ra'uf Khayrat, was shot dead in Cairo. 
  More than 130 policemen have been killed since Islamic 
militants declared war on the secular government of President 
Husni Mubarak in March 1992. The confrontation has claimed a 
total of more than 360 lives.

<F P=106> ["Special to the JORDAN TIMES" by Natashah Bukhari] </F>
  [Text]--The Islamic Action Front (IAF) and the National 
Action Front (NAF) Saturday urged all Egyptian, Arab and Islamic 
parties to end their "passive attitude" towards the ongoing 
violence in Egypt. 
  "What's going on in Egypt is very danagerous because 
violence 
breeds more violence and deprives people of their stability and 
deepens feelings of hatred among citizens of the same country," 
warned the IAF and the NAF in an open statement to the people of 
Egypt and Egyptian political parties and unions. 
  The two parties agreed that the "destructive" violent crimes 
committed by extremists in Egypt will lead to the destruction of 
Egypt's economy and freeze any development plans in that 
country, rendering it vulnerable and prey to "opportunists' 
claws." 
  "We as Islamists are pained by what is going on, and we call 
upon the Egyptian Government to deny the current situation and 
initiate negotiations with the parties concerned to try and 
contain this problem," said Hamzah Mansur, AIF Lower House 
spokesman in a telephone interview with the Jordan times on 
Sunday. 
  The deputy added that it was the responsibility of all 
Egyptian nationalists to exercise pressure on their government 
to seek the best interest of the people. The Egyptian 
Government, he added, "should have enough common sense to 
realise that it is time to talk to citizens," in order to 
pinpoint the reasons behind these "daily massacres" and study 
the circumstances that prompted the outbreak of violence. 
  In the joint statement, the IAF and NAF accused the Egyptian 
Government of dictatorship. It said the Cairo government does 
not give other parties the freedom to express their opinion or 
move under the country's legal umbrella, which, added the 
statement, causes frustration among the masses. 
  The two parties also accused the U.S. and Israel of 
escalating the violence in Egypt by steering away from that 
country's attempts at reform because they (the U.S. and Israel) 
realise that Egypt is the heart of the Arab World, and 
instability there would obstruct developments in the Arab World. 
  Mr. Mansur said that the IAF and NAF are using the media as 
their means of communication with Egypt's people as, he 
explained, the Egyptian's political parties' situation does not 
allow for immediate contact. 
  He added that if their Saturday statement causes a positive 
response from nationalists and Islamists in Egypt, the IAF and 
NAF will be "more than glad" to offer help by sending a 
delegation to Egypt to assist in establishing bridges of 
communication between conflicting parties there. 
  The IAF and the NAF warned of the seriousness of the 
situation in Egypt and said that it could be "contagious." 
  "Therefore, it is the duty of every devout Muslim and Arab 
to 
do whatever possible to help end this bloodshed in order to 
secure a decent living for the next generations," concluded the 
joint statement.

  [Text] A column by Fahmi Huwaydi that the newspaper 
AL-AHRAM publishes regularly every Tuesday has been banned. The 
banning of the article headlined "Dialogue on the Application of 
the Shari'ah" has come in the wake of the recent campaign 
against the writer, a campaign which has culminated in the 
publication of two articles in the same newspaper by two of 
Huwaydi's colleagues. 
  [The 12 April issue of AL-AHRAM contains no article by Fahmi 
Huwaydi. In the space allocated for this column on page 9, 
there are two articles by Hasan Duh and Ahmad 'Abd-al-Halim. 
Duh's article discusses the issue of the "repentant youth" who 
recently appeared on television. 'Abd-al-Halim's article deals 
with Arab national security. The two articles make no direct or 
indirect mention of Huwaydi.]

<F P=106> ["Throbs" column by Dr. Nu'man Jum'ah] </F>
  [Excerpts] We, the Arabs, live a big tragedy. Arab 
countries are suffering from emptiness, lack of purpose, and 
weakness. Neighboring them is a Zionist entity with a strong and 
cohesive fabric. The juxtaposition of strength with emptiness 
causes cracks and instability on the empty side. 
  Arab countries have despotic and repressive political 
regimes. Their governments have no popular basis. Governments 
that fail to communicate and interact with their peoples remain 
weak and handicapped. More often than not, they end up in 
conflict with their people or some sections of them. Such 
governments must seek protection from the state's regular forces 
and get foreign assistance and protection. Foreigners do not 
provide such things without a price, usually that of restricting 
and controlling the national administration. 
  Once an administration is sold out, the state's relations 
and 
external interests fall under foreign control. The result, as 
we see it, is that all Arab regimes flutter like a leaf in the 
wind or drift like a rudderless boat in high seas, having no 
initiative or direction of their own. They just react and 
respond to disasters after they occur. Most of the time, their 
reactions are too belated and indecisive to rise to the occasion 
and answer the challenges initiated by others. So, we mostly 
end up denouncing, lamenting, and shedding tears. 
  In this same region, we have a neighbor that is strong, 
gritty, and vibrant: the Zionist entity. This entity is a 
democracy in which the people have the final say. The 
government there represents the people, listens to the people, 
and does not defy their will. Such governments are strong 
because they do not exhaust their resources in a conflict with 
their people. They need no regular troops to fortify their 
position with their people. Therefore, their regular forces 
train the guns on their adversaries, the Arabs. 
  The Israeli Government does not need foreign countries to 
support it against its own people. On the contrary, it uses the 
strength, cohesiveness, and support of its people to put 
pressure on foreign countries whose material and political 
support it needs. [passage omitted] 
  This is the scary backdrop to the current ideas of peace, 
normalization, water negotiations, and a Middle East market, all 
of which are vehicles through which Israel will achieve its 
historical dream. What it has failed to achieve by war it will 
achieve by peace. A Zionist empire will spring up between the 
Nile and the Euphrates, one in which the mighty Zionists will be 
masters and the inept, misguided, and dysfunctional Arabs the 
underdogs. 
  It may be said that Egypt is poor and desperate for U.S. 
help 
and that this is why it has to listen to the orders of the U.S. 
Administration. This would explain our role in the Iraq-Iran 
war and then the Gulf war. This would also explain our 
unjustified hostility toward Iran and Sudan, our dealings with 
the Serbs despite their crimes in Bosnia, and our dispatch of 
troops to Somalia to replace U.S. troops. 
  My answer to this is that honest women go hungry rather than 
turn tricks. We can avoid antagonizing America while 
maintaining a measure of independence and freedom of action. 
But this would require a true democracy, a government that 
relies on its people, one that would cut its budget rather than 
seek foreign assistance, and a leadership that awakens the 
latent power of its people rather than resort to totalitarian 
police rule to repress them.

    [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-MUSAWWAR in Arabic on 8 April 
publishes on pages 34-36 an approximately 3,000-word article by 
Dr. Muhammad Nur Farhat under the headline "Al-Azhar and Control 
on Thought." The author discusses al-Azhar's authority to 
license or reject artistic, literary, and intellectual works 
dealing with Islamic affairs against the backdrop of a ruling on 
the subject issued by the State Council's General Assembly for 
Fatwa and Legislation. He expresses fear that this may lead to 
"an institutionalized religious authority imposing hegemony over 
thought." 
  The writer notes that the ruling was issued amid "a 
noticeable rise in the voice of the political Islam trend in all 
its factions." He says: "While representatives of the Islamic 
trend claimed trusteeship over us in our religious affairs, 
accusing whoever they wanted of blasphemy and depriving whoever 
they wanted of God's mercy, the official religious 
establishment, represented by al-Azhar, recently stepped forward 
to announce its right to impose this trusteeship by virtue of, 
first, its legitimacy, and second, its religious knowledge and 
competence." 
  Refuting the legal justification on which the State Council 
based its ruling--namely, protection of society's general order 
of which Islam is a pillar--the writer says: "Our society, 
although Islam is the official religion of the state, is 
actually based on religious pluralism and its Constitution 
guarantees freedom of religion and creed." He adds: "The first 
article of the civil law made Islamic shari'ah a source of law 
after two other sources--legislation and tradition." He says 
explanations and comments from the legal community made it clear 
that "the principles of Islamic shari'ah meant as a source of 
law are those comprehensive principles that fit the social and 
cultural bases of Egyptian society throughout its development." 
  The writer argues that giving al-Azhar exclusive authority 
to 
pass official rulings concerning the concept of general order 
when it comes to Islamic affairs "will lead to extremely serious 
legal consequences if this logic is stretched to its limits." 
He explains: "For example, since Article Two of the 
Constitution states that Islamic shari'ah is the main source of 
legislation, and since al-Azhar, as the State Council's ruling 
contended, is the only party that shall give binding opinions on 
Islamic affairs, it becomes constitutionally necessary to take 
al-Azhar's opinion on all our legislations before they are 
passed. This will turn al-Azhar, thanks to the State Council's 
fatwa [ruling], from a deep-seated religious institute and a 
great establishment for preserving shari'ah into a controller of 
legislative authority in the country." According to this logic, 
the writer adds: "Al-Azhar may also control the judicial 
authority because the idea of general order, on which the fatwa 
was based, is penetrating most of our judicial system." 
  The writer concludes: "If al-Azhar, according to this fatwa, 
takes over the authorities of legislation and the judiciary, the 
thing feared by all nationalists concerned about Egypt's future 
and democracy, even some supporters of the Islamic trend 
themselves, will happen--Egypt, with its executive, legislative, 
and judicial authorities, will turn into a religious state. Its 
decisionmaking will be in the hands of a religious establishment 
with indisputable rulings--something that neither Egypt nor any 
other Islamic country has known throughout its history, except 
during the Ottoman era." 
  Finally, the writer says: "The nature of the binding 
religious control the fatwa is giving to al-Azhar must lead to a 
society closing its doors to culture, thought, and creativity." 
He wonders: "If creative people, under the valid law, can 
complain about the decisions of the [administrative] control, 
how can they complain about decisions on which al-Azhar has 
given a binding opinion? Will complaints in this case mean 
religious disobedience and heresy?"

<F P=106> [Report by Rida Hammad] </F>
  [Text] The Egyptian Human Rights Organization [EHRO] last 
Wednesday issued its second report this year. The report 
revealed numerous violations of the rights of prisoners and 
detainees in Egyptian jails and noted an alarming increase in 
these violations compared to previous periods. The report, 
which monitored the situation in the prisons on the basis of 
testimonies by inmates and detainees, reports by the 
organization's representatives about their visits to the 
prisons, and complaints by the families of prisoners and the 
testimonies of lawyers, said that these violations clearly 
contravene legislation governing the treatment of prisoners. 
  The report said that the security forces do not abide by 
prison laws, particularly those that provide guarantees to the 
inmates. The most significant of these violations is the 
constant presence of State Security Investigations officers, who 
deal with everything that concerns political inmates and monitor 
all visits to them. This is contrary to Article 140 of the 
Criminal Procedures Law, which prohibits the prison commissioner 
from allowing policemen to contact prisoners except with written 
permission from the Public Prosecution Office specifying the 
length of and reason for the visit. Article 79 of Law 396 of 
1956 states: "This ban aims at providing protection to the 
prisoners against an attempt by the police to influence them." 
  The report also referred to the violations of legislative 
provisions by the Public Prosecution Office. The law stipulates 
that officials of the Public Prosecution Office should pay 
periodic visits to the prisons to make sure that they do not 
violate legislative provisions. However, the report notes that 
a large number of detainees who spent various terms in prison 
have testified that they have not been visited even once by 
Public Prosecution officials. This is regarded as extreme 
negligence on the part of the office. 
  As for collective punishment, the EHRO has ascertained that 
the security forces have repeatedly imposed collective 
punishment on inmates on the pretext of safeguarding security 
and hygiene, particularly inside the prisons where detainees or 
convicts from the political Islam groups are held. During these 
campaigns, the security forces used tear gas, batons, and whips, 
which is considered a flagrant violation of prison laws and 
regulations. Collective punishment campaigns were carried out 
frequently in the prisons of Abu Za'bal, al-'Aqrab, al-Marj, and 
al-Hadrah in Alexandria. The most violent of these campaigns 
took place in Abu Za'bal and al-Marj prisons. It began in Abu 
Za'bal on 28 August 1993 with a ban on recreation and visits by 
families or lawyers, the prevention of medical treatment, and 
the confiscation of the personal effects of the inmates. 
  The second raid was carried out the following month in 
which large number of soldiers and special forces were used. 
Violent and various forms of punishment were meted out to the 
prisoners. The forces entered Wings A and B and brought out 
prisoners from their cells and started beating them. Police 
dogs were also unleashed on them and, as a result, six prisoners 
were injured and evacuated to the al-Qasr al-'Ayni Hospital. 
The prisoners immediately went on a 14-day hunger strike during 
which they were punished one by one. This was followed by two 
similar disciplinary raids during which 15 prisoners were 
injured and four others were killed. The second flagrant 
example of collective punishment took place in the al-Marj 
prison when the security forces' raids injured 10 prisoners 
after they were beaten and dragged around. 
  The second violation that prisoners are being subjected to 
is 
bad health care. The report confirms the grave deterioration in 
the prisoners' health as a result of the small number of doctors 
and the shortage of medicine. The EHRO stressed that this 
represents a form of punishment by prison authorities. 
Contagious diseases, such as scabies, have spread in the Abu 
Za'bal prison, in addition to individual cases of serious 
illnesses resulting from inadequate medical care. 
  The order banning visits began with the escalation of what 
they termed "the rioting" in the Abu Za'bal prison last August 
during which three prisoners were killed and 76 others were 
injured. The ban was then extended to many other prisons. 
  The EHRO report also monitored the deteriorating living 
conditions inside the prisons, including the inedible food given 
to them. The report stressed that around 88 percent of the 
prisoners do not rely on prison food but discard it. The report 
also monitored the shortages of beds and covers, in addition to 
the small spaces where prisoners are crammed. 
  At the end of the report, the EHRO made several 
recommendations addressed to the president of the republic, the 
legislative authorities, and the Interior Ministry. The 
recommendations underlined the need to respect the laws and 
rules that govern the prison authority. It also called on the 
public attorney to initiate an immediate investigation into the 
complaints made by groups and individuals about attacks made on 
detainees. It demanded the repeal of some laws that justify 
these measures and the repeal of the president of the republic's 
authority to establish prisons and his sole prerogative to 
define the groups that will be housed in them. 
  The EHRO's first report of 4 August 1991 also detailed the 
bad living conditions in prisons.

  [Text] Tehran, April 20, IRNA -- Majlis Vice-Speaker, 
Hojjat ol-Eslam Hasan Rowhani and Bosnian Ambassador to Tehran, 
Omar Bahman here Wednesday [20 April] called on Islamic states 
to escalate their efforts to end the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Speaking at the meeting, Rowhani held the United Nations and 
the superpowers responsible for the tragic events in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "It was beyond one's imagination that an organization which 
should safeguard the rights and security of nations would act in 
such a way that encourages the aggressor." 
  The United Nations generously handed over to others a large 
part of a country which it has already recognized while the real 
owners of the country have a small portion which is under siege 
of Serbs, he said. 
  Referring to the intolerable situation in Bosnia, Rowhani 
said this is while big powers have all necessary means to stop 
such brutal bloodletting. 
  Rowhani, who chairs Majlis foreign policy committee, also 
referred to Washington's empty warnings of air strikes against 
Serbian forces and armaments. 
  "But," he said, "we saw American officials raise the threat 
of air strike tens of times but after that they spoke in such a 
tone to make Serbs realize that they were not practically 
serious about those threats." 
  Rowhani voiced Iran's readiness to help the defenceless 
people of Bosnia and called on Bosnian ambassador to convey the 
condolence of the Iranian Government and people to the Bosnian 
nation and government for the tragic developments in that 
country. 
  Bahman said in response that what was happening in Bosnia 
and 
Gorazde was an orchestrated conspiracy aimed at wiping out the 
Muslim nation, Islamic culture and history.

  [Text] Tehran, April 20, IRNA -- Thousands of university 
students demonstrated in front of the UN office in Tehran today, 
protesting the silence of the organization, its Security Council 
and other international bodies on the massacre of Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially in Gorazde. 
  The demonstrators carried placards and banners and chanted 
slogans in condemnation of Serbian crimes and UN policies 
towards them during their march towards the UN office. 
  Some of the banners carried by the students read "Serbs are 
committing crimes, Butrus-Ghali and the West are supporting 
them". 
  The marchers expressed their hatred of the UN's negligence 
towards the fate of Bosnian Muslims and of the shameful silence 
of Western countries on the massacre of defenceless women and 
children in an area declared by the UN as a safe haven. 
  In a resolution issued at the end of the rally, the students 
voiced their readiness to be despatched to Bosnia-Herzegovina to 
fight the aggressor Serbs. 
  Denouncing biased stance of the UN and its Security Council 
on the issue, the students called for lifting of the arms 
embargo against Bosnian Muslims. 
  Stressing that a proper response to aggressor Serbs could be 
given through unity of Muslims, the resolution urged all Muslim 
countries to mobilize their forces and resources for this 
purpose. 
  Meanwhile, the ulema of the theological school of Qom staged 
similar demonstration in the streets of the holy city in protest 
at the silence of international circles on the crimes being 
committed by the Serbs in Gorazde. 
  Also today, the Shahid (Martyr) Foundation issued a 
statement, condemning the silence of the UN and its Security 
Council on Serbian crimes in Gorazde. 
  The statement described the carnage of Muslims in Gorazde as 
a proof of the "prejudiced attitudes" of the UN and its Security 
Council.

<F P=106> [Unattibuted commentary] </F>
  [Text] According to dispatches, the Muslim populated city 
of Gorazde located in East Bosnia has been completely overrun by 
the Serbs. Gorazde, which, along with the cities of Sarajevo, 
Maglaj, Srebrenica, Bihac and Zepa, was declared by the UN 
Security Council as a safe area in 1992, has come under the 
aggressor Serbs' occupation. This tragedy has occurred at a 
time when the world community had earlier repeatedly expressed 
its anger and indignation over the continuing crimes of the Serb 
militiamen against the Muslim populated city's women and 
children. 
  Gorazde has fallen because international community lacked 
the 
necessary will for severely dealing with the Serbs. This lack 
of firm will on the part of the world community against the 
Serbs has so emboldened them in perpetuating their crimes that 
even their supporters were compelled, under the pressure of the 
world public opinion, to adopt a propaganda gesture against the 
Serbs. In this gesture the supporters sounded a warning to the 
Serbs not to take advantage being shown by the international 
community. The Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, has warned the 
Serbs to withdraw from Gorazde. The warning comes at a time 
when the United Nations, yesterday, made an official 
announcement on occupation of Gorazde by the Serb militiamen. 
The Russian president has made these comments under the 
conditions when his country, as the Serbs' historic ally, has 
not spared any help to Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs in the 
course of the civil war for fighting against the Muslims. The 
tone of the Russian president is such that the Serbs themselves 
know better than anyone else about the unreal nature such 
utterances. This is because in the absence of the Serbs' 
confidence about Russian backing, the aggressors would not have 
pursued their crimes. 
  Another point observable in this political game played in 
Gorazde relates to the West's connivance in the face of the 
Serbs' crimes and its consent to the fall of the city. 
  Now the world community is faced with this question as to 
why 
the NATO did not adopt, in case of Gorazde, the same attitude 
which it had followed against the Serbs in pulling their heavy 
weapons away from the vicinity of Sarajevo last February. The 
NATO warning to the Serbs was so serious that they not only 
pulled back their heavy weapons from Sarajevo but also signed an 
agreement with the Muslims last March to allow freedom of 
movement in that city. 
  Political observers have analyzed the fall of Gorazde and 
lack of a serious reaction to it by the West and NATO in this 
manner. Occupation of the Muslim populated city of Gorazde, 
which is located in eastern Bosnia along the frontier with 
Serbia, will give the Bosnian Serbs the chance to have control 
over East Bosnia and eventually to merge with Serbia. In other 
words, the West, by consenting to the collapse of Gorazde, is 
trying to somehow resolve the Bosnian problem.

<F P=106> ["Text" of speech by Ayatollah 'Ali Hoseyni Khamene'i, </F>
leader of the Islamic revolution, at meeting with officials from 
the Hajj and Religious Endowments Organization on 20 April; 
place not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the 
Merciful. You are very welcome, my dear brothers and sisters, 
servants of the nation. May almighty God accept your services 
for the hajj, which is one of the most important obligations for 
Muslims. May God assist you and bless you for your efforts and 
enable you to perform and revive your great and lofty 
obligation. I deem it my duty to thank all those working for 
the hajj affairs, particularly those who spend hours of their 
time throughout the year to ensure that this religious 
obligation is performed properly. [passage omitted] 
  The obligation to perform the hajj is truly a unique 
obligation. There is no other obligation similar to the hajj 
among all the Islamic instructions. It is particularly 
important. Its spiritual aspects are highly significant. 
[passage omitted]. The worldly aspects of the hajj are also 
unique. That is, it is an obligation not confined to an 
individual or a nation. It covers the entire Islamic world. 
Almighty God has chosen a period and has invited everyone to 
meet in one place during this period. These are the days of 
[exchanging] knowledge. It would have been possible to invite 
everyone to gather at this place [on various occasions] 
throughout the year. But almighty God has a purpose in inviting 
everyone to come to a particular place for a few days each year. 
This is the basic and important point. 
  It is obvious that God's objective is to enable Muslim 
individuals to meet each other and to feel united. That is, the 
feeling of togetherness, the magnificent feeling of seeing a 
gathering made up of various nations and races. If God had not 
had such a feeling in mind, there would have been no need to 
assign a few days every year for hajj rituals. 
  Well, what is the objective when every nation of the Islamic 
world dispatches some of their people to a particular place on a 
particular day to meet one another? The answer should be clear 
to every Muslim who knows the meaning of Koranic and Islamic 
concepts. Imam Sadeq [the sixth Shi'a imam], peace be upon him, 
has said: What you want to know is in God's book. Almighty God 
invites a congregation comprising all Muslim nations to gather 
during this period. "Then pass on at a quick pace from the 
place, whence it is usual for the multitude" [Koranic verse] 
That is: Move together, come out together, and perform your 
rituals together. 
  What is the objective of this gathering? Why should the 
Muslim people of the world come together? Is the objective just 
to come together, to stare silently at one another, and then to 
return home? So why should they gather in one place? Is the 
objective to gather round and resolve their disputes? What! In 
such a gathering? 
  The close concentration of all Muslim nations in one place, 
and a holy place too, pursues only one objective and can only 
have a single meaning; and that is: They are asked to gather 
round to take a positive step on the fate of the Islamic ummah. 
That is, to do a job. The job will be different when the 
Islamic nations develop. We hope such a day will come. On such 
a day, the elected members of these nations will convene at a 
big majles comprising several thousand people, in that place 
[Mecca] to pass a resolution. The articles of such a resolution 
will then be ratified by the pilgrims, representing various 
states. The resolution will then be communicated to the 
governments and the nations. 
  This would be the best alternative. Unfortunately, this is 
not practical today, because the nations have not made 
sufficient progress in this field yet and the governments are 
not assisting them either. 
  What is the essential task there in Mecca as long as there 
is 
no possibility of taking practical decisions during the hajj 
rituals? The essential task of the nations is to show their 
concern regarding the problems of the Islamic world in whatever 
way they can, to stress their unity, and to show their disavowal 
of the enemies of the Islamic world. This is the least one can 
expect and can perform in hajj rituals as determined by Islam. 
We have not brought the disavowal [part of the rituals] from 
outside to incorporate it into the hajj rituals. This is part 
of the hajj rituals, this is the soul of the hajj rituals, and 
it is the true meaning of this immense gathering. 
  Some individuals enjoy saying repeatedly, in their press, in 
their comments, and when they wish to sting us, that we have 
politicized the hajj rituals. What does it mean, politicizing 
the hajj? If it means that we have incorporated a political 
concept into the hajj rituals, the answer is that for those who 
fail to see this political concept of hajj, we pray that God may 
cure them so that they can see it. How is it possible that 
someone familiar with Islam, familiar with the Koranic verses on 
hajj matters, and familiar with the importance of unity can fail 
to understand that this immense gathering pursues the objective 
of realizing lofty political and divine political concepts 
concerning all Muslims. It is for unity, it is to resolve the 
difficulties of the Islamic world, and it is to unite and bring 
hearts closer. However, if the objective is to make the hajj 
rituals a means of preventing major powers from realizing their 
tyrannic policies, then we accept this. Those who are somehow 
involved in hajj matters should not compromise this beloved 
obligation of the Muslims with international politics. We are in 
favor of this. Anyone who politicizes the hajj with such 
objectives would betray the hajj. 
  The problems of the Islamic world are important. Gentlemen, 
where else can these problems be raised? Where else can the 
Muslims join their united cry against so many dastardly acts 
that the Muslims are subjected to in the world today? Where 
else can they unite their cry to reach the world and reach the 
ears of the treacherous policymakers? Where else, but during 
the hajj rituals? 
  See for yourself what they are doing to Muslims in Europe. 
The events in Bosnia and, especially, the recent week's 
developments in Gorazde, really make you want to cry. Words 
cannot express the gravity and immensity of this tragedy. 
Whatever we say, it is not enough. 
  The leaders of the world's arrogant powers are watching the 
victim that is being slaughtered before them and they are just 
waiting to see when he will pass away. The victim is the 
Muslims of former Yugoslavia. What is their crime? They are 
Muslims. This is not a new idea -- I said it myself in my hajj 
message three years ago -- but then they used to deny it. Now, 
the big mouths of arrogance themselves are saying that they must 
not be helped because they are Muslims. They have been forced 
to admit it. Their crime is that they are Muslims. 
  It is because a Muslim nation, in the heart of Europe -- I 
am 
not saying a Muslim government -- it is not clear that if Bosnia 
had had a government, it would have been a totally Islamic 
government; they had, after all, lived under the weight of a 
communist government for 50 years, more or less -- before that, 
too, they lived under the rule of corrupt Ottomans and the like, 
or under some corrupt European governments, European empires 
such as the Austrian empire, and so on. They could not have 
created an Islamic and a Koranic government overnight after all. 
No one could have expected that. The thing which has so angered 
the world, that is, that global arrogance which has sole mastery 
over the world, with regard to the suffering and defenseless 
Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina is the existence of a country that 
has a Muslim nation. That is what they cannot bear to see. 
This is the situation of Muslims in the world today. 
  In these circumstances, international organizations -- worst 
of all and most despicable of all, the United Nations -- have 
behaved in the most abominable way. I want to tell you this: 
Let the secretary general who stands at the head of the United 
Nations know that he has acquired such a terrible reputation 
among Muslims that he will never be able to clear his name 
again. Muslims can see.... 
  The world's Muslims can see what is happening in Bosnia. 
Muslims came forward and said: Let us go there and help these 
people, since the other side is receiving help anyway. However, 
they were told that such a thing was not possible. The Muslims 
then said: Then let us send them arms. They were again told 
that such a thing was not possible either. On the surface of 
it, of course, the West wants to say that they were not giving 
weapons to any side. Well, of course! One side has already 
inherited all the weapons which used to belong to the former 
state of Yugoslavia, that is, the same state which for many 
years lent military support to the Iraqi regime by giving it 
tanks and other equipment. The Serbs have all these weapons at 
their disposal today. However, the other side, that is, the 
unguarded people of a town and the women and children living 
there, are empty-handed. 
  So what do they mean when they say that we have given no 
arms 
to any of the parties involved? They are deceiving world public 
opinion when they say that they are not helping any party. An 
armed party is standing against an unarmed one, and instead of 
either taking the weapon away from the armed party or giving 
weapons to the unarmed party, you just stand aside and say that 
you are not helping any side. 
  This means in effect that they are just sitting and waiting 
for the fall and demise of the unarmed party. They are in fact 
waiting for the time when the Muslims fall. 
  They said that they would send UN forces. The Islamic 
countries said: Let us go there as part of the UN forces in 
order to act as a shield. They replied: No, not possible! They 
did not allow any one -- not only from the Islamic Republic of 
Iran but from any other Islamic country -- to be sent to the 
area in order to act as a shield. What is the meaning of this? 
This means that they wanted to instruct the soldiers whom they 
sent to the area to go there and back the Serbs. Naturally, 
they could not ask the same from a Muslim soldier, and this is 
why they did not allow Muslims to take part. 
  A disgrace such as this reigns over the order which they 
seek 
to create in the world today. Look at the behavior of the 
United States, the false promises they gave to the Muslims of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the absolute refusal to help, and finally 
the behavior of international organizations and a number of 
European countries and Britain. Muslims remain oppressed in 
Bosnia, just waiting to be massacred. What can the world's 
Muslims do about this? Is there a way better than hajj? 
  What makes the arrogant powers tremble with fear is the 
masses of people, otherwise they do not care one bit when a few 
governments gather in a conference in some corner of the world 
and issue a resolution. They would not care if a hundred 
resolutions are issued. How many resolutions have been issued 
so far against the usurper Zionists? They have been so much hot 
air and have achieved sweet nothing. 
  What really makes the arrogant powers tremble with fear is 
the presence of the masses, and where can this presence 
materialize better than in the hajj? Two million Muslims from 
all Islamic countries will gather there, and if you ask any of 
them about their feelings toward Gorazde, they will say they 
want to go there and defend the oppressed Muslims of the world. 
Would it not be a pity if we were to lose this valuable 
congregation, which is capable of bringing so much blessing and 
saving the lives of so many Muslims? Is this what politicizing 
the hajj means? Is this why they object to the Islamic Republic 
of Iran politicizing the hajj? 
  Disavowal means this: Disavowal means that the people gather 
together there and chant against the executioners who wear 
neckties and well-ironed suits and who sprinkle aftershave over 
themselves, who massacre the people in the most savage way, and 
against those who support them, who rule in their favor in the 
international organizations. This is the meaning of disavowal. 
Can the hajj be complete without this? Is a hajj without 
disavowal a hajj? Let the people who are familiar with the 
Koran and Islam answer this. Let them answer fairly. This is 
what the imam [Khomeyni] meant when he said that a hajj without 
disavowal is not a hajj. This is what he meant. 
  Disavowal is a part of hajj. It is essential to it. And the 
presence of Muslims in the hajj must be a meaningful presence. 
Otherwise, if it were just a question of spirituality and the 
chanting of God's name, people could do it in their own homes. 
"And proclaim the Pilgrimage among men: they will come to thee 
on foot and mounted on every kind of camel, lean on account of 
journeys through deep and distant mountain highways." [Koranic 
verse spoken in Arabic] This would not be necessary. If 
gathering together was not significant, it would not be 
necessary to proclaim the Pilgrimage among men. It would be 
enough to say: Whenever you have the chance during the year, at 
any time, go to Mecca. 
  It is precisely for this reason that they have said that 
everyone must come together. It is because even chanting God's 
name must be done with others; even circling around the Kaaba of 
God must be done with others. [passage omitted] 
  Of course, what others do during the hajj is not our 
business. We simply do what duty requires us to do; we will do 
what we have to do, with God's help. What others do with 
regard to oppressed nations is not our business. Of course, 
when I say what they do is not our business, I mean that the 
inaction of others will not stop us. Of course, we will try, 
just as, thanks to God's help, our government and officials have 
tried to encourage other nations to help the suffering Bosnians. 
If they help, so much the better; otherwise, we will do it 
ourselves. And, God be praised, so far, the various 
organizations of the Islamic Republic and every individual have 
really spared no effort. They have done well. They must do 
even more. 
  At this moment, too, the Red Crescent must do whatever it 
can 
in the hope that it may be able to provide some assistance to 
those beseiged and suffering people in terms of food and basic 
needs. Every faithful and devoted combatant youth, whether from 
the army, the Islamic Revolution Guards' Corps, or the Basij 
must declare their readiness so that, the minute they say we are 
allowed to go there, the minute the way has been cleared, they 
can be off. [Crowd chants] [passage omitted] 
  The nation of Iran severed the thread of fear from the major 
powers, and now it can stand firm and steadfast. This has now 
become a lesson for other nations, as you can see that today the 
youth of the world are chanting in the name of Islam. Everyone 
thought that 15 years since the victory of the Islamic 
revolution and five years since the demise of his holiness the 
imam [Khomeyni], the enthusiasm of Muslim nations toward Iran 
and the Islamic revolution would fade away. This enthusisam, 
however, has clearly increased as each day has gone by. Each 
day the problem that global arrogance faces has become more 
serious. It was not us who did this. It was, in fact, God and 
his will. The Iranian nation, aided by God and divine 
successes, paved the way for this divine triumph. Our nation 
accomplished this by its compassion, its sacrifices, its 
efforts, its blood, its faith, and its unity. 
  You must preserve unity. The enemy is highly intent on 
creating discord among a nation which constantly champions the 
cause of unity. All of you -- various groups, sects, cities, 
and individuals -- must remember this. The enemies would really 
love to be able to say: Here you are then! So this is the same 
Islamic republic which used to talk so much about unity, but is 
now suffering from disunity from within! They would really love 
to see such a situation. However, thanks to God's special 
attention, they have so far not succeeded; and with God's 
assistance and through the vigilance and alertness of you, dear 
nation, they will never succeed in this. [passage omitted]

  [Text] At the opening session of the great Hajj congress of 
1994 this afternoon, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed: 
Hajj has both a religious as well as a political significance. 
If this divine injunction was being properly implemented today, 
the Serbs would not have been able to slaughter the people of 
Gorazde on the eve of the Hajj ceremonies without any fear and 
without paying any attention to this great Islamic gathering at 
Hajj. 
  The president confirmed: The issue of Hajj and the 
expression of disavowal of infidels should not become a source 
of disunity among the Muslims. We believe in and stress the 
issue of carrying out the injunction of disavowal in the same 
way that we regard the unity and cohesion of the Muslims of the 
world as necessary and essential. These two important issues are 
complimentary. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: In view of the critical condition 
of the world and numerous difficulties today, Muslims should 
defend the rights of the Islamic nations in a united manner by 
making use of common means. Hajj ceremonies being performed 
next to the house of God provide the best opportunity for 
achieving this unity. 
  Referring to the obstacles that Saudi officials are creating 
regarding the number of Iranian pilgrims sent to this year's 
Hajj ceremonies, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: We hope that God will 
enable them to make appropriate decisions at the very last hours 
regarding the quantity and quality of the Hajj ceremonies, so 
that they may satisfy our people and other Islamic nations. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani pointed out: We will not do anything 
contrary to the interests and security of Saudi Arabia. The 
holding of the disavowal ceremonies will not be harmful to 
anyone except the infidels and the enemies of Islam. As we 
raise this issue, we wish for the well-being of the nation of 
Saudi Arabia and its government. As far as the Islamic Republic 
of Iran is concerned, there is no difference between the nation 
of Saudi Arabia and its government and the wronged people of 
other Islamic countries. 
  Referring to today's remarks by the esteemed leader 
[Khamene'i] and the guidelines of the late imam [Khomeyni] 
regarding the philosophy behind Hajj ceremonies, 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: With regard to the guidelines and 
instructions of the esteemed leader of the Islamic Revolution 
[Khamene'i]--which we had also repeatedly heard from the tongue 
of his eminence the imam--may God's blessings be upon him, our 
people know their duties and, as in the past, they will act 
according to their divine responsibilities. 
  The president expressed his hope that the leaders of the 
Islamic countries--realizing the true nature of Hajj and by 
making plans and coordinating their activities and adopting an 
appropriate procedure during the great annual Hajj 
ceremonies--will make proper use of the great Hajj gathering to 
solve the problems of the world of Islam.

  [Text] During the opening ceremony of the Great Hajj 
Congress-73 [1373, Iranian year beginning 21 March] held this 
afternoon at the Immaculate Mausoleum of the founder of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin 
Reyshahri, the representative of the Supreme Jurisconsult, and 
the supervisor of the Iranian pilgrims to the House of God, 
spoke on the programs of the congress and the policies of the 
government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, in that respect. 
  Also, in continuation of the congress, Hojjat ol-Eslam val- 
Moslemin Haj Seyyed Ahmad Khomeyni, made some remarks saying: 
The Abrahamite Hajj is the cry of the oppressed Muslims against 
the arrogants of the world. Hajj is also a rallying point for 
the resolution of problems and strengthening of brotherhood 
among Muslims. If Muslims had truly trodden the path of unity 
and equality, today Muslims of the Middle East would not have 
succumbed to the superpowers to such an extent. 
  At the conclusion of the congress a statement was read out 
in 
which the silence of the so-called human rights organizations 
was condemned. The statement says: We, the participants of the 
Great Hajj Congress, announce our sympathy and solidarity with 
the oppressed Muslim nation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and condemn 
the deceitful silence of the UN Security Council and the actual 
collusion of the UN secretary general, and say yes to the call 
of the Guardian of the Cause of the world Muslims and announce 
our readiness for any kind of assistance, including jihad in the 
field of that unequal battle, and call on Islamic nations to 
make their cries heard by the world and turn their decisiveness 
in the holy arena of hajj into a hammer to smash arrogance, 
polytheism, and belief in polytheism.

  [Text] The latest program of the naval forces of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran regarding the manufacture of 
submarines, docks [preceding word in English], the 
reconstruction of vessels, warships and weapons related to 
identifying units below sea level has been announced. 
  Speaking to our correspondent, Captain Mahmud Bidel, the 
head of the research unit and self-sufficiency department of the 
naval forces referred to the exhortations of his eminence, Imam 
Khomeyni (may God be pleased with him) in 1362 [year beginning 
21 March 1983] on the need to attain self-sufficiency in the 
three branches of the armed forces and the corps, said: 
According to the decree of His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, 
the great leader and the commander in chief of the armed forces, 
which he issued at the end of last year, a research unit was 
added to the self-sufficiency department. He added: The 
objectives of this measure were to strengthen the base of the 
country's defense. The naval forces have carried out effective 
work in the field of electronic warfare and have attained 
remarkable success. 
  The head of the research unit and self-sufficiency 
department 
of the naval forces continued: One of the most important tasks 
of this force in the aftermath of the imposed war has been to 
modernize the radar systems of the naval forces and to 
coordinate them with the latest techniques currently being used 
in the world. 
  Referring to the continued military embargo against Iran by 
world powers, Captain Bidel said: The necessary links have been 
forged with the industrial university and with the country's 
industry for the manufacture of the components needed for the 
various units of the Navy. 
  He said: According to my estimates, we saved 765 million 
rials last year on the purchase of various components for 
military equipment. Fortunately, now that we have forged the 
necessary links with the industrial university and the country's 
industry, there has been a 93-percent saving. 
  He added: Last year, the Navy succeeded in manufacturing one 
of the strategic weapons used in the naval fleet's aviation 
division. He referred to the fact that these weapons will help 
in strengthening the projects above sea level and in underwater 
defense which can assist in search, defense, and reconnaissance 
tactics. He said: These weapons were used in the joint 
Iran-Pakistan maneuvers (IR-PAK 94) and amazed the Pakistani 
naval officials and the international observers. 
  Elaborating on the fact that an underwater reconnaissance 
unit of Iran would be ready by the end of this year, Captain 
Bidel said: Armaments related to the identification of 
underwater units and fleet helicopters will be ready by the end 
of this year. Regarding the Hamzeh warship (formerly known as 
the Shahsavar) which had been completed in Azar [22 November-21 
December] last year, he said: Preliminaries for the manufacture 
of submarines that can be used for deep sea diving fitted with 
heavy-duty equipment have been initiated. 
  He added: The renovation of one hovercraft [preceding word 
in English] will be completed by the end of this year and it 
will become operational. Captain Bidel said that an 
astronomical system had been developed by the marine sciences 
academy in Nowshahr in collaboration with the research unit and 
self-sufficiency department of the naval forces and has been put 
into use. He stated that the preliminaries for the utilization 
of this system at the marine sciences academy in Sistan va 
Baluchestan have been completed. 
  He stressed: With the help of this system we can identify 
celestial bodies from inside the submarine. He added that the 
naval forces have attained great success in manufacturing 
underwater communications and said: The research unit and 
self-sufficiency department has set up an inverse engineering 
section, in collaboration with the Sharif industrial university 
and has implemented four projects, including duplication of the 
computers currently being used worldwide. 
  In conclusion, the head of the research unit and the 
self-sufficiency department of the naval forces said that the 
work for the construction of a 150-ton dock has been initiated 
in Bushehr and will become operational on 22 Bahman [11 
February] this [Iranian] year. He said that this dock would be 
able to accommodate small and large vessels for repairs.

  [Text] Tehran, April 20, IRNA -- Deputy Foreign Minister of 
Sudan Yusuf Baradah in his meeting with the First Deputy 
President of Iran Hasan Habibi said today that most of the 
problems faced by the Muslim countries have been imposed by the 
enemies of Islam. 
  "The enemies of Islam fear the awakening of Muslims in 
countries like Iran, Sudan, Algeria and Bosnia, and are 
therefore trying to suppress them by all possible means," 
Baradah pointed out. 
  He lauded the accomplishments of Islamic Iran and said the 
country is indebted to the unity of its people, its leadership 
and dedicated efforts of responsible officials. 
  Baradah who arrived in Tehran on Monday, said the purpose of 
his visit to Iran is become more familiar with the official 
views and positions for further developing of Tehran-Khartoum 
relations. 
  Habibi said in response that one of the ways for fighting 
problems in the Muslim world after steadfastness, and struggle 
and proper programming, is development of relations and exchange 
of views between the officials of Muslim countries. 
  He said the setting up of the Iran-Sudan joint economic 
commission has facilitated bilateral trade relations and 
suggested that the two sides should explore the grounds for 
private investments in the other country.

  [Text] Pakistan says India's assertion not to give up 
nuclear option under any circumstances would intensify the 
nuclear threat in South Asia and neighboring regions. This was 
stated by a Foreign Office spokesman in Islamabad today while 
commenting on a statement made by the Indian prime minister, Mr. 
Narasimha Rao, during his address to the Indian military 
commanders on the 13th of this month. He said Mr. Narasimha 
Rao's statement is clear manifestation of India's intention to 
persist with its nuclear-weapon program. The spokesman said 
when viewed in conjunction with India's reported intention to 
deploy ballistic missiles, the statement arouses the legitimate 
fear that India is about to take steps which will unleash a 
nuclear arms race in South Asia. He said it is no secret that 
India wants to be recognized as nuclear-weapon state to realize 
its image of itself as a great power. The Indian ambition, the 
spokesman said, will inevitably erode the nonproliferation 
regime of the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] which 
recognizes only five nuclear-weapon states. He said all that 
India needs to do to reassure itself about Pakistan's nuclear 
program is to accept one of the several proposals made by 
Pakistan for reciprocal or regional nonproliferation. The 
spokesman said India's stance can only be interpreted as a 
preemptory rejection of the proposal advanced recently by the 
United States about initiating multilateral talks on security in 
South Asia. 
  Commenting on the press reports about resumption of 
bilateral 
talks between India and Pakistan, the spokesman clarified that 
Pakistan has not received any proposal for ministerial or 
summit-level talks between the two countries.

  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres left for 
Bucharest this evening and will meet there tonight with PLO 
leader, Yasir 'Arafat. In their talk the two will try to 
resolve the remaining disagreements. Minister Peres will also 
demand that 'Arafat supply information on the Israeli MIA's and 
captives. Our correspondent Dov Gilhar reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Gilhar] Bucharest is becoming another 
stop of the peace train. Peres has left for an international 
economic conference in Romania, where he will meet with 'Arafat 
in an attempt to overcome the last obstacles in the Cairo talks. 
  [Peres] Besides the MIA's issue, most of the talk will focus 
on how to bring about the conclusion of the negotiations from 
the viewpoint of issues, timetable, and arrangements. 
  [Gilhar] In the wake of the report you heard from Major 
General Shahaq this morning, do you believe it will be possible 
to conclude the negotiations by next weekend? 
  [Peres] I do not know if this will be the case indeed, but 
the impression is that we are at the final stage, and barring 
unexpected developments, we may be able to conclude the 
negotiations within two to three weeks. 
  [Gilhar] In tonight's meeting Peres will also demand to 
receive information on the MIA's issue. Before his departure 
Peres heard a report on significant progress on civilian matters 
at the Cairo talks. The Israeli delegation leaders came from 
Cairo to Jerusalem this morning to brief the foreign minister 
and prime minister on the remaining disputes. Rabin heard from 
Maj. Gen. Shahaq that the talks are delayed over the PLO's 
demands that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] prisoners be 
released and that it exercise legal powers also regarding 
Israelis who move through the autonomy areas. [passage omitted] 
[end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew at 
1700 GMT on 20 April reports on the Cairo talks, adding that 
"several issues have remained unresolved in the deliberations of 
the Security Committee. The problem of the prisoners' release 
has not been solved yet, although an agreed timetable was 
already set for the release of 5,000 prisoners: 2,500 will be 
released upon the signing of the agreement, and the rest will be 
released three weeks after the signing. The Palestinians demand 
that a timetable be set for the release of another 3,500 
prisoners approximately, including Hamas members, but Israel is 
opposed to this." On civilian matters, "three questions remain 
open, and they will be transferred to 'Arafat and Rabin for 
decision: the question of area code for Gaza and Jericho; the 
Palestinian stamp; and the passport."]

  [Excerpts] Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur toured 
Gush 'Etzyon regional council settlements today. Shilo Gal, 
head of the regional council, presented to Gur a detailed plan 
for the annexation of Gush 'Etzyon to Israeli territory in the 
context of the permanent arrangement. Gur said the extent to 
which such a plan conforms with the government's policy must be 
checked. Our correspondent in the territories Golan Yokhpaz 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Yokhpaz] Gal pointed to two large maps 
on the wall. This is the Gush 'Etzyon area, he told Deputy 
Defense Minister Gur. We hereby present to you the plan to link 
Gush 'Etzyon to Israel's territory in the context of the 
permanent arrangement, he said. [passage omitted] 
  Gal proposed to establish a settlement bloc in Gush 'Etzyon, 
made up of two districts linked by a corridor, and link it to 
Israel. For his part, Gur chose not to use the word annexation. 
The plan must conform with the government's resolutions, he 
said, and that is why I do not have a clear answer to give you. 
  [Gur] Nobody mentioned annexation, but talked about adding 
settlements or expanding settlements with new neighborhoods, 
each one of which could be considered a settlement. Therefore, 
we must check very well how much this plan conforms with the 
government's policy. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] A delegation of Muslim heads of local councils and 
clergymen left for Jordan today. Officially, the purpose of 
their visit is to attend the ceremony marking the end of the 
renovation of the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, but knowledgeable 
sources say this is yet another attempt to court Israel's Arabs. 
Our correspondent Yo'el Dar has more details: 
  For many years, all Arab countries ignored their brethren 
living in Israel, especially the Muslims. Israel's Arabs were 
barred from visiting the Arab countries, making the pilgrimage 
to Mecca, and studying at Cairo's al-Azhar University. The Arab 
League, too, refused to recognize Israel's Arabs and treated 
them as agents and collaborators of the Zionists and the State 
of Israel. 
  Recently, however, earnest efforts have been made to court 
representatives of the Israeli Arab community. The PLO-Tunis 
embraced its secular circles, particularly HADASH [Democratic 
Front for Peace and Equality]; Egypt found its way to the heart 
of heads of local councils and activists in Darawshah's party; 
while Jordan and Saudi Arabia took clergymen and conservative 
circles under their wings. 
  A large group of heads of local councils and qadis left for 
Jordan today. The official purpose of their visit is to attend 
the celebrations marking the end of the renovation of al-Aqsa 
Mosque in Jerusalem. However, a look at the composition of the 
delegation shows that its members were not chosen at random and 
that the fact that it headed by a representative of the Islamic 
Movement is no mere coincidence.

  [Text] Knesset Members [MK's] Darawshah and al-Sani' of 
the Arab Democratic Party have asked Prime Minister Rabin to 
remove the closure on the territories. At a meeting with the 
premier this morning they said that the measure was making life 
very difficult for Arab residents and had increased their 
bitterness. The two MK's also reported on their recent visit to 
Damascus. Prime Minister Rabin said he was optimistic about the 
chances of promoting negotiations with Syria, and in this regard 
was awaiting the visit here of U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher at the end of the month.

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Arye Kiesel] </F>
  [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 1994 training year 
"got off on the wrong foot." 
  A senior Army element has said: It is evident even now that 
the training plan is not being carried out, and the crack 
infantry units' training has been "significantly impaired" by 
the operational activities in Hebron and elsewhere in the 
territories. 
  In recent days, top IDF echelons have voiced great concern 
over the fact that dozens of elite infantry companies had been 
taken off the training schedule and dispatched to the 
territories, primarily to protect local Jews. The problem 
encompasses companies from the entire Infantry Corps. 
  Many companies are busy safeguarding the existence of the 
closure on the "divide" between the territories and Israel. 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who has been recently informed 
about damage to the training plan, said yesterday that "the work 
load of the regular troops in the territories is immense." He 
added that this year soldiers and reservists will again share 
the load. 
  A senior military figure said yesterday: "We expected a 
significant decrease in the reserve units' work load, but we 
could not foresee the Hebron massacre and the ensuing wave of 
terror attacks which tied the regular army up in routine 
security tasks at the expense of training. We must ensure the 
regular troops' combat readiness, and therefore, we have to call 
up reservists." 
  Last month, numerous reserve units replaced regular troops 
in 
the territories. Many of these units were called up on short 
notice on speedy call-up procedures. 
  The senior military source added: "Even now I know our 
training plan will be seriously affected, and this must be 
averted despite the IDF's duty to continually take care of 
routine security." 
  To ease the reserve troops' work load, the IDF plans to 
establish guard and security units, but this plan is unlikely to 
ease the infantry and armored units' work load at this stage. 
Thus they will again serve dozens of reserve duty days this 
year, and they will serve them in the territories.

  [Text] Nearly 500 foreign investors and Indian 
entrepreneurs have come together in the capital under a focus 
program to promote direct foreign investments in the small and 
medium industries. A report. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] The program -- India 
Invesmart -- organized jointly by Industry Ministry and the 
United Nations Industrial Development Organization -- UNIDO -- 
is providing a forum for individual business negotiations 
between foreign investors and Indian project sponsors. The five 
priority sectors in this meet are food processing, leather and 
leather products, textiles and ready-made garments, chemicals, 
and metallurgy. Inaugurating the five-day Invesmart, the prime 
minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, called for an interdisciplinary 
approach to industrialization keeping in mind the variety of 
contemporary concerns like environment, employment, and 
resources. 
  [Rao] The fact that most of the identified projects are in 
the small and medium enterprise sector, it is equally important. 
This sector has led the process of economic growth in a number 
of developing countries and moreover in India it is particularly 
important for its relatively greater employment potential. Thus 
it has been the effort of my government to strengthen industries 
in this sector through promotion of competition, efficiency, 
technology upgradation, and enhancement of the export 
capability. 
  [Correspondent] The Secretary General of UNIDO, Mr. Mauricio 
de Mar'iay Campos, took note of India's industrial growth 
potential; some of the contributory factors being India's large 
market and skilled and diversified manpower and its wide 
industrial base. India's investment potential has attracted the 
foreign investors attending this meet, nearly half of them 
coming from major developed countries like France, Germany, 
Italy, UK, and USA. The proposals to be discussed amounted 
total investment of nearly $1,500 million mostly in the small 
and medium scale sector. An open house question hour session 
was held in the afternoon between investors and entrepreneurs on 
the one side and top (?prime) representatives of the government 
and apex industry organizations on the other. Headed by the 
chairman of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, Mr. A.N. 
Verma, the (?panelists) fielded questions ranging from pollution 
control laws to Land Ceiling Act, shareholding rules, and the 
RBI [Reserve Bank of India] regulations. It was clear at the 
end of the day that the government in collaboration with UNIDO 
intended to act as a promoting rather than a regulatory body.

the area of science and technology, and so on. Shri Dinesh 
Singh also mentioned the far-reaching process of economic 
liberalisation taking place in India and offered to share our 
experience in this area. 
  The visiting minister gave an account of recent developments 
in Ukraine and also underlined the importance that his country 
attached to developing relations with India in as many spheres

between the two countries; and an economic and technical 
cooperation agreement.

  [Text] Ukraine has sought India's assistance in setting up 
medium and small-scale industrial complex. Addressing a meeting 
organized by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and 
Industry, FICCI, in New Delhi today, the visiting Ukrainian 
foreign minister, Mr. Anatoliy Zlenko, said his country has many 
heavy industries, but it lacks the know-how to run medium and 
small-scale industries successfully as India does. He said the 
three agreements that have been signed between the two countries 
on economic, scientific, technical, and cultural cooperation 
will go a long way in boosting the traditional ties between the 
two countries. Mr. Zlenko also announced that the Ukrainian 
chambers and FICCI would set up a joint business committee to 
promote business between the two nations. Later, the visiting 
minister called on the president.

<F P=106> [By Brij Bharadwaj] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, 8 April--Further pressure was mounted on 
Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao today when several leaders of 
Jammu and Kashmir, including former Chief Minister and National 
Conference leader Dr. Farooq Abdullah and Pradesh [state] 
Congress chief, Mr. Ghulam Rasool Kar, called on him and sought 
immediate changes in the administrative set up in Jammu and 
Kashmir if the political process in the State was to be 
initiated. 
  The leaders included the Janata Dal chief of Jammu and 
Kashmir, Mr. Abdul Qayaum. It may be mentioned that earlier 
these leaders had refused to accompany Minister of State for 
Internal Security Rajesh Pilot during his Kashmir tour because 
they felt that no purpose will be served unless the 
administrative set up in the State was changed to make it more 
responsive. 
  These leaders had also submitted a memorandum to Prime 
Minister seeking changes in the administrative set up including 
change of Governor and top officials including Chief Secretary 
and senior police officials. The appointment with Prime 
Minister for Kashmiri leaders was fixed yesterday by Minister of 
State for Internal Security Rajesh Pilot who also accompanies 
these leaders. 
  It may be mentioned that while Mr. Pilot has been supporting 
the demand for change, Home Minister S.B. Chavan is opposed to 
any change and feels that the Governor is doing a good job and 
should not be disturbed. The choice before the Prime Minister 
is difficult as both groups are adamant that holding of 
elections in the State which are necessary for restoring 
normalcy will be possible only if the alternative suggested by 
them was accepted. 
  Mr. Pilot is also reported to have felt enthusiastic about 
the surrender of militants before him in Kupwara and large 
response received at the public meeting addressed by him. He is 
reported to have conveyed that in case administrative changes 
are made the militancy can be given a crushing blow. He has 
also suggested that for this purpose a surrender policy should 
be formulated so that militants fed up with insurgency could lay 
down arms. 
  The Minister for Internal Security is also proposing an 
amendment in the Criminal Procedure Code to implement his 
assurance that parents of every person taken into custody will 
be informed within 48 hours after the arrest. This assurance 
was earlier given by the Minister in Jammu and Kashmir, but now 
he wants to enforce it throughout the country. 
  According to reports, the Jammu and Kashmir Governor, K.V. 
Krishna Rao, is also expected here shortly to brief the Central 
leaders. The Home Secretary has also had talks with the State 
officials about the proposed changes in the State. 
  In the meantime, the leader of the Panthers Party and 
convener of the conference of Kashmiri leaders in Vienna Mr. 
Bhim Singh is continuing with preparations even though some 
leaders including former Chief Minister Dr. Farooq Abdullah and 
former Health Minister Karan Singh have expressed their 
inability to attend the conference. 
  The details of the proposed meet were discussed today at a 
lunch meeting which among others was attended by the leader of 
the All Party Hurriyat Conference. They included Professor 
Abdul Ghani Bhat, Justice Bahauddin Farooqi, and Mr. Abbas 
Ansari. According to reports, some leaders from Jammu and 
Ladakh including Mr. P. Namgyal former MP will also be going to 
Vienna to take Part in the meeting. 
  Among the leaders who got in touch with Mr. Singh today 
about 
the meet was former hijacker of Indian Airlines plane Hashim 
Quereshi. According to reports there are also doubts if Pakistan 
Government will allow Sardar Abdul Qayum to go to Vienna to 
attend the conference. There are also differences within the 
Hurriyat Conference on the issue of participation as leaders 
like Syed Ali Shah Gilani of Jamaat-i-Islami, Mr. Abdul Ghani 
Lone of People's Party, and Mr. Shabir Shah of Jammu and Kashmir 
Liberation Front will be unable to attend as they are in custody 
and so far there is no move to release them to enable their 
participation in the conference. 
  PTI adds: The Kashmir All-party Hurriyat Conference 
leadership held discussions with former State Government Karan 
Singh. [sentence as published] 
  The Hurriyat leaders said later "we exchanged ideas and 
shared perceptions" with him. "Dr. Karan Singh does owe a duty 
to people of Jammu and Kashmir not as a son of Maharaja, but as 
a genuine and forthright seer in politics." 
  Confirming the meeting, the former Governor said there had 
been a free and fair exchange of views. "I am not discouraged by 
their views", Dr. Karan Singh added. 
  This also called for release of all detained Kashmiri 
political leader to create a congenial atmosphere for a 
dialogue. "The release of Jamaat leader Syed Ali Shah Gilani, 
People's Conference Chairman, Mr. Abdul Ghani Lone and militant 
chiefs Yasin Malik and Shabir Shah," Prof. Abdul Ghani said, 
would "create the right atmosphere for holding of such a free 
and frank dialogue." 
  The four leaders awaiting clearance of the Central 
Government 
for their proposed visit to the Austrian capital of Vienna for a 
meeting of leaders from both sides of Kashmir asserted that such 
a dialogue would help in solving the Kashmir issue.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Seize The Moment in Kashmir"] </F>
  [Text] Dr. Karan Singh's call for initiating the process 
of reconciliation in Kashmir merits serious consideration. The 
time is propitious. The security forces have made important 
gains in the recent past and the militant groups have been 
pushed onto the defensive. Beginning the process of 
reconciliation assumes greater importance if the Government 
wants to go ahead with its plans for an early election in the 
Valley. Though neither their firepower nor their ability to 
strike has diminished greatly, the militants have now begun to 
talk in terms of not just Kashmiri Muslims but the entire 
community. This is a definite signal and the Jammu and Kashmir 
Liberation Front chief, Mr. Bashir Ahmad Bhat's observations 
about inducting non-Muslims into the Kashmiri struggle are a 
case in point. The Hurriyat leaders are in Delhi on a prolonged 
mission to test the mainstream waters. 
  The contours of the reconciliation will of course have to be 
traced with care. It need not be the much talked about 
"package" of economic goodies that is better left to a popular 
Government which emerges out of the polls. But if the gains 
made in the Valley have to be consolidated, the psychological 
moment has to seized. The fatigue induced by the bloodshed in 
the Valley is showing. The anger of the people with the Indian 
political and security establishment is, no doubt unabated. But 
Pakistan's misadventure at the UN Human Rights Conference at 
Geneva may have opened the eyes of Kashmiris to the real nature 
of Pakistan's interest in prolonging their agony. At the same 
time, there are indications that the strain of living under the 
gun for five long years has begun to tell. To that extent, the 
policy of firmness may have paid off, but to pursue it to the 
exclusion of a political and psychological initiative will be 
counter-productive. 
  What is urgently needed is a willingness on part of the 
Government to think of an amnesty for those incarcerated 
militants against whom there are no specific charges. Excesses 
by security forces have to be accounted for. Interaction 
between the administration and the people has to be tempered 
with greater sensitivity. Such generosity will send a positive 
signal and create an atmosphere of goodwill which, in the 
fullness of time can translate itself into conditions conducive 
for a democratic exercise of people's will. Dr. Karan Singh has 
also called for setting up a separate ministry for Kashmiri 
affairs, apparently in reference to the multiplicity and 
divergence of approaches in the Union Home Ministry. Going by 
past experience, ministries such as the Mr. S.B Chavan's Home 
Ministry, do not solve problems. They are the problem.

  [Text] The home minister has said that the center has no 
intention to destabilize any non-Congress-I government in the 
states. He described the fears expressed in some quarters that 
the Tamil Nadu government would be dismissed as baseless. Mr. 
Chavan made the remarks in the Rajya Sabha during zero hour when 
a Congress-I member, Mr. V. Narayana Swamy, drew the attention 
of the house to the reports in some papers that the center had 
some understanding with the banned LTTE [Liberation Tigers of 
Tamil Eelam] during the prime minister's visit to London last 
month. The home minister said the Tamil Nadu government is 
making irresponsible allegations against the center to shift the 
people's attention from its failure on the law and order front. 
Mr. S.B. Chavan said that the center has no hand whatsover in 
the deteriorating law and order problem in the state. Raising 
the issue during zero hour, Ms. Jayanti Natarajan -- Congress-I, 
alleged that people in the state are living in constant fear 
because of highway robberies and dacoities. This was strongly 
refuted by the AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] 
members who argued that law and order is a state subject and it 
cannot be discussed in the house. However, they staged a 
walkout in protest against the chair allowing the issue being 
raised in the house.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Christopher and al-'Aqabah Siege"] </F>
  [Text] We would have liked to welcome more warmly U.S. 
Secretary of State's statements describing his country's 
relations with Jordan as excellent, and to be more confident 
about the promises and proposals that the U.S. secretary is 
carrying regarding the naval siege imposed on the Port of 
al-'Aqabah. However, what we have heard from the U.S. secretary 
and other U.S. Administration officials on the siege does not 
encourage anyone to be optimistic about this U.S. commodity, 
which no longer has a market in Jordan. Jordan has suffered from 
contradiction between the U.S. words and deeds, and between talk 
and practical moves. 
  Jordan has become fed up with the U.S. double standards, and 
this caused His Majesty King Husayn to openly announce that, 
henceforth, our country's effective participation in the peace 
process depends on how serious the U.S. commitments are 
concerning lifting the unjust siege on Jordan's sole port. 
  Yesterday, the U.S. warships in the Gulf of Aqaba turned 
back 
a ship full of paper imported for the Jordanian press. This 
makes us even more doubtful about these U.S. statements; that 
is, unless the Clinton administration has reconsidered its 
calculations and concluded that it is unreasonable and 
unacceptable to continue sponsoring the peace process on the one 
hand, and imposing a siege on a country that is very strongly 
and honestly committed to the peace process on the other. 
  We hope that Warren Christopher will this time have 
practical 
and acceptable proposals that do not harm Jordan's sovereignty 
and dignity concerning all that is related to the inspection of 
ships heading to the Port of al-'Aqabah. We also hope that the 
U.S. secretary's forthcoming visit to the Middle East will be 
more successful than previous visits and that it will lead to 
the aspired progress toward just and comprehensive peace in the 
region.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Christopher's Tour and al-'Aqabah Blockade"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. Administration is trying these days to 
revive and rescue the peace process from the danger caused by 
Israeli procrastinations. U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's tour due to begin next week is part of these U.S. 
efforts. 
  While Secretary Christopher is preparing for his tour, we 
would like to state an absolute fact, hoping he will take it 
into consideration, this fact is that abstract talk about 
Washington's support for peace efforts in the region no longer 
convinces anyone of the credibility of the U.S. Administration 
or its role as an honest mediator. There are serious doubts 
about the U.S. mediation, and developments of the past few years 
confirm Washington's bias toward Israel. The Arab parties to 
the peace process want to see practical measures on the ground 
and real U.S. intervention to advance the peace process. 
  Secretary Christopher's statements last night call for some 
optimism since he hoped to bring proposals that would help ease 
the results of the siege imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah 
during his upcoming tour. 
  The U.S. Naval piracy peaked with the imposition of the 
siege 
on the Port of al-'Aqabah without any legal justification. 
These arbitrary measures worsened with the banning this week of 
two ships from entering the Port of al-'Aqabah and forcing them 
to go to other ports. Thus, the number of ships turned back by 
the U.S. Navy this month reached six, causing further losses to 
the Jordanian economy. 
  His Majesty King Husayn recently declared Jordan's decisive 
position on this subject when he drew a link between the peace 
process and reconsideration of the blockade imposed on the Port 
of al-'Aqabah by the U.S. Navy, especially since Jordan is 
precisely observing the UN resolutions. 
  This Jordanian decision, which stems from its national and 
pan-Arab interest and from its concern for its national 
sovereignty, should be an alarm that the U.S. Administration 
should hear while it is undoubtedly aware of the Jordanian 
central role in the entire peace process and in the achievement 
of security and stability in the region.

  [Excerpt] Amman--Students at the University of Jordan 
Wednesday staged a peaceful protest against the continuing 
blockade of al-'Aqabah and demanded that the U.S. apply the same 
standards in implementing U.N. resolutions. 
  The protesters also demanded that Jordan, which has 
suspended 
formal participation in the Arab-Israeli peace process pending a 
solution to the siege of its Red Sea port, withdraw from the 
peace process altogether. 
  Nearly 500 students, about half of them young women, took 
part in the one-hour rally within the campus of the university 
organised by the Students Council. 
  Organisers put the number at more than 1,000 and said all 
shades of political thought among the students were represented 
in the rally. But it was clear that the Islamic bloc, which 
scored an overwhelming victory in student elections last month, 
dominated the event. 
  It was the first rally in the Kingdom after His Majesty King 
Husayn said last month Jordan's return to the 29-month-old 
Arab-Israeli peace talks sponsored by the U.S. and Russia hinged 
on an end to the damaging sea-based inspections of all 
al-'Aqabah-bound vessels by the U.S.-led naval force patrolling 
the Red Sea. 
  The warships are enforcing the international sanctions 
against Iraq following its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But 
Jordanian importers and exporters are suffering severely from 
the costly delays caused by diversion of freighters to other 
ports. 
  "No to American double-standards in applying U.N. 
resolutions," "No to American piracy in the Red Sea," "No to 
Rabin's threats against Jordan," and "We will not succumb to 
pressure," were some of the slogans chanted by the students, who 
held aloft portraits of King Husayn and the late King 'Abdullah 
and Jordanian flags. 
  At the head of the rally were leaders of the Students 
Council. Most of the female students wore the veil while many of 
the male protesters held the Holy Koran. 
  The main theme of the protesters was that the U.S. was 
applying double standards in the Middle East. They assailed 
Washington saying that it was very enthusiastic to rigorously 
enforce the U.N.-imposed sanctions against Iraq while dozens of 
Security Council resolutions calling for Israeli compliance 
remained unimplemented. 
  The protesters demanded that it was not enough that Jordan 
had suspended its peace negotiations with Israel but should 
withdraw from the peace process completely. [passage omitted] 
  [Amman AKHBAR AL-USBU' in Arabic of 21 April publishes a 
80-word front-page report on the demonstration staged 
"yesterday" by students of the University of Jordan in which it 
says that "the protesters set fire to U.S. and Israeli flags and 
raised posters supporting His Majesty King Husayn's pan-Arab 
policies and condemning Washington's arrogant policy."]

have sold old aircraft to a Muslim Asian nation just before the 
transaction was to have been closed. The justification cited by 
Washington was that nation's human rights record and its 
connections and relations, according to well-informed sources. 
  The nation in question had agreed to purchase the aircraft 
following contacts made by Jordan. There is no word about the 
size of the unconsummated deal, but the sources said it would 
have been quite substantial.

  [Excerpt] Amman--Jordan on Wednesday [20 April] welcomed 
the willingness of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, to 
accept United Nations resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis for 
peace with Israel. 
  "We acknowledge parties who adhere to the relevant United 
Nations resolution and consider this helpful to the peace 
process," information Minister Jawad al-'Anani told the JORDAN 
TIMES. 
  He said that Jordan has accepted United Nations resolutions 
242 and 338 pertaining to the conflict between Israel and each 
of Jordan, Palestine and Syria and resolutions 425 and 426 
pertaining to Lebanon as the basis for peace. 
  He said that when "more parties" accept the Arab consensus 
that acknowledges these resolutions as the basis for Middle East 
peace, "then this would be helpful to the peace process." 
  A leader of the Islamic group Hamas offered to extend 
recognition and make peace with Israel if the latter agrees to 
full withdrawal from the territories it occupied in 1967 
including east Jerusalem. 
  "What is required is the withdrawal of the Zionist forces 
from the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem, and dismantling (Jewish) 
settlements," Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the Hamas politburo, who 
is based in Damascus told the Islamist weekly al-Sabil in an 
interview published Tuesday. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. al-'Anani was careful not to mention the movement by 
name 
or indicate a Jordanian recognition of the Islamic group as part 
of the Palestinian leadership. 
  His Majesty King Husayn had said this week that Jordan only 
recognises the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the 
people of Palestine and that "the Palestinians can discuss their 
affairs on their own, they can agree or disagree... this does 
not concern us." [passage omitted]

  [Text] An Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, spokesman 
has told AL-BILAD the impounding of the passports of Muhammad 
Nazzal and Ibrahim Ghawshah, respectively the group's 
representative and media spokesman in Jordan, does not mean the 
documents are being literally withheld, as certain media organs 
have interpreted the move. The measure was meant as a 
precautionary step to ensure their safety in Jordan. No 
measures of a disciplinary nature have been taken against Hamas, 
according to the spokesman. 
  Political observers are surprised by recent subdued Hamas 
statements following the recent Israeli threats to Jordan. 
Since then, Hamas has been publicly drawing closer to a line, 
advocated by certain Palestinian factions in 1974, that falls 
short of recognizing Israel inside the green line. Observers 
are surprised by recent Hamas statements indicating the group 
supports peace, but not the way the peace process is being 
conducted. Equally surprising was a Hamas call for the 
Americans to take the whole Palestinian polity into 
consideration, in other words, to initiate a dialogue with it. 
Hamas thinks certain U.S. Administration officials are seeking 
to destroy the bases on which the peace process was launched. 
The observers are amazed Hamas has reduced the American-Arab 
disagreement over Washington's open bias toward Israel to one of 
personal differences. A Jordanian parliamentary deputy said 
this is a serious retreat on the part of Hamas, whose statement 
implies recognition of Israel and is a poor investment of recent 
Hamas-claimed military operations. 
  For its part, Hamas said its position is not new and that it 
calls for an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza and 
elections to choose a leadership for the Palestinian people. It 
will be up to this elected leadership to implement the will of 
the people. 
  Hamas said its most recent statements were not released in 
Amman in order to ease tension and to spare Jordan Israel's 
groundless accusations. Hamas has announced it will stop 
attacks on civilian targets if Israel proves amenable to the 
solution proposed by Hamas. Hamas said this does not amount to a 
retreat but a temporary arrangement that does not imply 
recognition of Israel. Hamas was not forthcoming when asked by 
AL-BILAD about Israel's stand about the equation. The group 
said it proposed a 10-year truce after Israel pulls back to the 
1948 border. In the interim, the two sides would formulate an 
overall conception of a final settlement that does not 
necessarily provide for recognition of Israel's sovereignty over 
Palestine.

  [Excerpts] Over the past few days security agencies have 
released a considerable number of detainees in response to 
pressure from Islamic Action Front [IAF] desputies. The IAF 
deputies met Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali more than a 
week ago and presented him with a memorandum that spelled out 
the IAF's view on the recent wave of arrests, and including a 
list of the detainees. The exact number of those that were 
released is not known. 
  Deputy Hamzah Mansur told AL-BILAD that two al-Ahliyah 
[National] University students were released, as well as 
'Abd-al-Majid Diyah, an IAF leader in Amman's fifth electoral 
district. An al-Rysayfah youth and a University of Jordan 
student were also released. 
  Asked by AL-BILAD whether the Islamic Resistance Movement, 
Hamas, in Jordan, or other Islamic groups, were officially asked 
by the government to keep a low profile in light of the recent 
U.S. and Israeli escalation, Hamzah Mansur said he had not met 
any Hamas representatives in Jordan over the past few days and 
had no idea about any government demand in this connection. 
[passage omitted] 
  Regarding the recent U.S.-Israeli threats, Mansur said U.S. 
decision making is linked with the decisions of the Israeli 
Foreign Ministry. The Zionist administration in Palestine is 
confused and does not know how to act. Imagine its reaction if 
the 'Afula and Hadera operations been launched via the Jordan 
River. 
  Mansur added: If the government wants to say that Hamas has 
no organization on Jordanian territory, this is acceptable. 
However, if our government wants to bridle those who speak 
about our people's suffering and the operations in Palestine, 
then it is wrong, because each Jordanian citizen talks about the 
operations inside Palestine and the suffering of its people. 
  Mansur added: With all due respect to the government, the 
current situation might warrant the government's reconsideration 
of its program and formation. Until this happens, I demand that 
the government think primarily of how to be a truthful image of 
this people, which has a great measure of pride and self-esteem.

  [Excerpts] Amman--Jordan is not aware of any plan to 
resettle Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon and insists on 
their right to return to their homeland or receive compensation 
as stipulated in United Nations Security Council resolutions and 
international law, senior officials said Wednesday [20 April]. 
  Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs and Minister of 
Information Jawad al-'Anani and former minister Marwan Dudin, 
head of the Kingdom's delegation to talks on refugees and 
displaced persons, said they were not aware of the reported 
Lebanese plan. 
  In an interview with Beirut's AL-SAFIR daily on Monday, 
Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz was quoted as saying that 
the purported four-point plan was under "international 
consideration." The Associated Press carried a report on the 
interview. [passage omitted] 
  Both Dr. al-'Anani and Dr. Dudin said that they were not 
aware of any such plan, and if indeed there was one, Jordan was 
not among the countries considering it. 
  "Our position is very clear in all bilateral and 
multilateral 
negotiations on the refugee problem," said Dr. al-'Anani. "We 
insist on the implementation of the relevant U.N. Security 
Council resolutions which give the refugees their right to 
return or receive compensation." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jordan's voice was clear and loud while rejecting 
threats made by terrorist Yitzhaq Rabin, who has a black record 
in dealing with our kinsfolk and people in the areas to the west 
of the river. 
  King Husayn's voice represented this country's position 
while 
he replied strongly to the enemy's allegations, lies, and 
instigations concerning Jordan's relations with so-called 
terrorism. Jordan and its people have been harmed the most by 
the Jews' terrorism, aggression, and brutal arrogance. 
  The government did the same in its analysis of the enemy's 
bankruptcy and failure after the painful jihad attacks launched 
in retaliation for the crimes committed by the enemy's army and 
settlers, who shed Arab and Palestinian blood. 
  The position of our country, whether voiced by King Husayn 
or 
the government statement, emphasized that there is no organized 
Hamas Movement presence on Jordanian land. Hamas, this jihad 
movement that was born, grew, and escalated its struggle in the 
occupied Palestinian territories, developed as a deep 
demonstration of a Palestinian jihad case that soon extended its 
roots deep into the popular Palestinian conscience. This 
Palestinian conscience felt that after long struggle under 
various bases and ideologies, it was in need of activating 
resistance against the occupation in accordance with new bases 
and different plans. 
  This means Hamas is not a rootless plant, but the 
culmination 
of the results of the Palestinian people's struggle in 
particular, and the fruit of an Islamic renaissance plan that 
began to take shape throughout the Islamic world after the 
Islamic nation reached a unique situation of humiliation, denial 
of a role, and estrangement. 
  If Hamas' jihad operations are fully planned and executed in 
the Palestinian territories, as the United States admitted when 
Israel accused Washington of providing refuge to Hamas' leaders 
on its land, these operations are well received by the sons of 
this nation--whether on the beloved land of Jordan, or elsewhere 
in free Arab and Islamic countries. These operations were 
received with a good and spontaneous response that relieves the 
souls of those who had suffered defeats and setbacks over the 
past century, during which the Jews became more monstrous and 
assumed a high status in the records of those who commit crimes, 
racism, aggression, and terrorism. 
  Hamas, which is an indivisible and pedigreed component of 
the living Palestinian people in particular, and the Islamic 
nation in general, has embodied a particular form of jihad that 
is cherished by both Arabs and Muslims. It is hard for any 
political player in the region and the world at large to 
circumvent or overlook this fact, although the PLO was 
officially recognized by the Arabs, the world community, and 
Jews as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian 
people. Had the PLO itself been impressed about its status as 
the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, it 
would not have opened a dialogue with Hamas and its leaders, 
urging them to join the PLO. Had this been the case, foreign 
and Arab governments would not have sought talks and meetings 
with Hamas and Hamas leaders. Even the enemy expedited the 
conclusion of the Oslo accord with the tyrannical PLO leadership 
because it does not want to deal with Hamas. The enemy is well 
aware of the role Hamas has begun to play on the Palestinian 
scene. Likewise, it is well aware of the prestige Hamas now 
enjoys within the Palestinian community. 
  In addition to this, nobody can deny Hamas is influencing 
the 
course of negotiations. It is true Hamas is not involved in 
the negotiations. Nonetheless, it is influencing the 
negotiations. In this regard, suffice it to note the 
unprecedented statement terrorist Rabin made to the effect that 
his government is ready to dismantle settlements in the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip in return for a final arrangement or 
solution with the Palestinians. It is no coincidence that this 
statement by Rabin was made in the aftermath of the Hadera and 
'Afula attacks. Consequently, Hamas operations have indirectly 
and unintentionally contributed to promoting the Palestinian 
negotiating position. Who knows? Had it not been for the 
Palestinian opposition and their jihad operations, the 
Palestinian negotiating team might not have obtained half the 
gains they were promised. In the same vein, were the 
Palestinian negotiators to demonstrate a measure of patience, 
they would be able to force some of their conditions, something 
that could help them regain more Palestinian rights--the very 
rights that are being undermined at the negotiating tables in 
Cairo, Oslo, and Madrid. 
  Given all this, we support the leadership of this beloved 
country that has rejected the enemy's arrogant threats, which 
are nourished by evil U.S. and European powers. We are opposed 
to the constant attempts to apply economic and political 
pressure on Jordan. We stand united and supportive of the 
efforts to confront aggression and defend Jordanian national 
soil and our sacred national unity, as well. We are willing to 
sacrifice our lives to protect the homeland. Likewise, we are 
ready to build a protective shield around the homeland. This is 
a sacred duty we must perform. As for Palestine, and the 
Palestinian revolution, fighting the occupation and the enemy's 
quest for domination, they are our first line of defense. We 
will be the strategic depth of this revolution when war erupts, 
as we have always been. 
  This beloved homeland yesterday celebrated the completion of 
the third Hashemite restoration of the Dome of the Rock and the 
al-Aqsa Mosque, the jewel of Jerusalem, the queen among cities, 
the epitome of Islamic dignity, the place to which our Prophet 
Muhammad, may God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon him, 
made his nocturnal journey, and the third holiest shrine. 
  May Jordan always remain a sanctuary for free men and 
support 
Palestine and the Palestinians. This Hashemite restoration work 
conducted on the holiest shrine in Palestine, which was made 
possible by the donation made by His Majesty King Husayn, is a 
strong reflection of this constantly lofty Jordanian position.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Discussing the atmosphere surrounding U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher's tour of the region, due to begin 
next week, the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: This tour comes after a 
lengthy halt in the Washington peace talks and in the wake of a 
premeditated attempt by Israel to conceal the peace process 
behind a thick wall of blood and fire. Meanwhile, the Israeli 
rulers stabbed the peace process in the back, undermined it, and 
derailed it from the bases set for it. This has created a 
gloomy and disappointing atmosphere, making it hard to be 
optimistic over the possibility of extricating the peace process 
from the difficult situation created by the Tel Aviv rulers. 
  Discussing the U.S. role in the region, the paper says: The 
full partner role, which the United States chose for itself, has 
not changed the situation. This is because the United States is 
evading the requirements of partnership, represented by a call 
for adopting the bases set for the peace process and respecting 
international legitimacy and its resolutions, in addition to 
holding discussions with the parties concerned to achieve and 
confirm this respect, and using all means available to convince 
the parties that reject international legitimacy and its 
resolutions and try to impose their will on others. 
  AL-BA'TH asserts that a stand in favor of international 
legitimacy and its resolutions as well as standing alongside 
justice and peace are not a departure from the full partner role 
or from the role of an honest and effective mediator. 
  Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH stresses that Syria 
cooperated with the United States in order to establish a just 
and comprehensive peace that would be honorable and not 
humiliating--a peace that would secure the rights of all and 
respect international legitimacy without breaching it. The 
paper emphasizes that Syria will continue to support a just and 
comprehensive peace, international legitimacy, and anyone who 
champions these values, principles, and approaches. Syria, 
however, will never be alongside injustice, nor will it accept a 
false peace that would bring humiliation to future generations 
and consecrate the encroachments on our territories and rights. 
  Also discussing U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
tour, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: The Arab parties welcome 
any effective and active U.S. efforts that would contribute to 
removing the numerous obstacles which are still impeding the 
peace process. They even used to call for upgrading the U.S. 
role to a level befitting the full, fair, and honest partner, so 
this partner will have a clear and frank say in determining the 
course of the peace process and preserving the bases and 
principles according to which the disputing parties attended the 
Madrid conference, particularly concerning a comprehensive 
solution and the land-for-peace principle. 
  Discussing the intransigent Israeli positions, AL-THAWRAH 
says: If, during his visit, Christopher plans to provide an 
appropriate atmosphere to unleash the peace process anew, he 
will first face the intransigent Israeli position which is still 
creating obstacles, setting conditions and uttering no's, which 
make it impossible to achieve any real balance in the peace 
process. This is because the Rabin government persistently 
calls for relinquishing the Madrid formula and publicly rejects 
full withdrawal. Moreover, it does not accept any discussion on 
Jerusalem and the settlements, and always seeks to single out 
the Arab parties and peddle partial solutions that would 
squander the peace opportunity, territory, and rights. 
  The paper adds: As part of a disinformation and deception 
campaign, the Rabin government is now calling on Syria to hold 
secret negotiations and conclude a separate solution away from 
other Arab tracks. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Everyone knows that Syria wants 
peace and does its utmost to achieve it. Syria and the entire 
world, however, believe that if peace is not just and 
comprehensive and if it does not regain the entire occupied Arab 
territories, it will not be real and firm, and will not last; it 
will simply be a temporary truce that can end at any moment. 
The United States should take this into account and begin 
devoting its efforts to promoting the negotiations toward 
achieving peace. Such peace will end aggression and occupation 
and will achieve justice and security for all.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] AL-THAWRAH says that the peace process is still 
stalemated on all tracks, even on the one which took a separate 
course within the framework of the so-called Oslo agreement. 
The Tel Aviv rulers' maneuvers and obstructive tactics are the 
main and direct reason for the futility of this process and its 
arrival at a dead end. This Israeli policy is aimed at killing 
the peace chance and imposing the occupation status quo and its 
policy. 
  The paper stresses that after the Madrid conference and the 
convocation of 12 rounds of bilateral talks, it has been 
revealed that Israel is using the political process as a cover 
to continue and intensify settlement and aggression and to 
maintain the occupation. It has also been revealed that it is 
using the political process as a means to extort the Arabs and 
pressure them into ending the boycott and accepting Israel and 
its expansion in the region. Israel also wants to invade the 
markets of the Arab region and share with the Arabs their wealth 
and natural resources without offering them anything in return. 
  AL-THAWRAH says that although the region has entered a new 
cycle of Israeli violence and escalation, thus threatening the 
peace process, U.S. efforts are still much less than required. 
So far, the U.S. behavior is still at odds with the past and 
current U.S. Administrations' assurances and pledges to achieve 
a just, comprehensive peace based on full implementation of UN 
Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, as well as Resolution 
425. It is regrettable that the U.S. role has not gone beyond 
words, statements, and promises to the Arabs. In essence, the 
U.S. Administration maintained a stand of glaring bias toward 
Israel and of liberal support for Israel and its aggressive 
policy and practices. 
  Concluding its article, AL-THAWRAH says that the region does 
not need new shuttle tours or wishes to hold a new round of 
talks following the fashion of its precedents. What is required 
is an international and U.S. action that rises to the level of 
responsibility and the looming danger and removes all obstacles. 
What is required is to implement relevant UN [General Assembly] 
and Security Council resolutions and to make Israel comply with 
all those resolutions. Any attempt to undermine the principle 
of sovereignty and to talk about partial solutions and 
withdrawals are rejected by Syria. Peace is indivisible. 
Unless it is just and comprehensive, no peace can be durable.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: The Israeli Government leaked 
information to the media about draft proposals Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin has received, which were worked out by the Israeli 
Army on the principles of a settlement with Syria. These 
proposals include a host of general principles, but they do not 
address the depth of the withdrawal from the Golan or its 
timetable. 
  The draft proposals speak about peaceful relations, security 
arrangements, and normalization of ties. However, these 
proposals do not include a pledge of full withdrawal. They call 
for open borders, economic relations, a search for water 
resources in the Golan, the demilitarization of areas, the 
disarming of military forces, the creation of warning stations, 
and the deployment of international forces. 
  Information was also leaked that the Israeli Foreign 
Ministry 
has, in turn, prepared a working paper on a settlement with 
Syria. This working paper is independent from that of the Army. 
Yitzhaq Rabin announced that Syria should hold secret contacts 
with Israel because it is impossible to reach peace without such 
contacts. Any observer who follows these drafts and proposals 
can only wonder if Israel is really serious about making peace. 
  Syria presented a document of principles during the sixth 
round of the Washington talks, which was hailed by the 
international community as an objective and balanced paper that 
lays the foundations of firm peace in the region. However, 
Israel refused to discuss the sixth item of the document of 
principles on the exchange of land for peace and the return of 
the Golan. Israel inundated the Washington talks with an 
endless series of security conditions and pretexts, as if the 
Washington talks were held to provide security for Israel alone. 
  The Syrian negotiating team did not succeed--despite the 
many 
rounds and exhaustive efforts--in drawing the Israeli delegation 
to discuss withdrawal from the Golan, although the occupied 
territories are central to the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
  The Israeli settlement paper did not include anything that 
refers to Israel's readiness to withdraw fully from the Golan. 
The Israeli paper revolves around the achievement of great 
gains for Israel -- such as relations, normalization, and 
security arrangements. This confirms that there is no change in 
the Israeli position and that their approach of procrastination 
and maneuvering remains the same. 
  Syria is concerned with a just and comprehensive peace, 
which 
means the restoration of Arab territories and rights and 
providing a chance for stability in the Middle East. Syria is 
not at all concerned with being drawn into Israel's trap or its 
security claims. 
  Israel is only raising these problems and security 
complications in order to announce at the end that occupation of 
part of the Golan is important for its security, although 
occupation did not, and will not, provide security for Israel. 
Just, entrenched, and honorable peace is the only thing that 
will provide security and stability for the region. 
  Obviously, the game of the Israeli working papers -- one 
from 
the Army and the other from the Foreign Ministry -- is merely 
another pretext to escape the obligations of the peace process, 
primarily withdrawal from the Golan and all occupied territories. 
  The Washington talks have extensively addressed all items 
related to peace, particularly security arrangements. However, 
the Israeli side has consistently refused to discuss the 
question of withdrawal. Had Israel truly wanted peace, the 
question would not have taken all these discussions, 
deliberations, and working papers. The Security Council 
resolutions, the Madrid conference foundations, and the U.S. 
initiative all stem from the exchange of land for peace. Is 
Israel ready to return the land, the whole land? This is the 
question that requires a frank answer. Without a frank and 
decisive answer, there is no possibility for realizing peace in 
the region. Syria is not willing to relinquish an inch of its 
territory or any Arab right. Syria is also not willing to 
exchange facts for illusions and to replace the Washington talks 
and the foundations of the Madrid conference with secret talks 
whose only objective is to circumvent the Security Council 
resolutions.

  [Text] TISHRIN comments on the peace process and Israel's 
unserious approach toward this process. The paper emphasizes 
that Syria is serious about the peace process and adds: Syria 
presented a document of principles during the sixth round of the 
Washington talks, which was hailed by the international 
community as a balanced, objective paper that lays the 
foundations of firm peace in the region. 
  The paper speaks about Israel's refusal to discuss the sixth

peace and the return of the Golan. Israel inundated the 
Washington talks with an endless series of security conditions 
and pretexts, as if the Washington talks were held to provide 
security for Israel alone. 
  TISHRIN notes the settlement paper reported by Israel radio, 
stressing that the paper does not refer to Israel's willingness 
to withdraw fully from the Golan. The Israeli paper revolves 
around the achievement of great gains, such as relations, 
normalization and security arrangements. This confirms that 
there is no change in the Israeli position and that the approach

  TISHRIN adds: Obviously, the game of the Israeli working

  TISHRIN concludes by reasserting that Syria is not willing 
to 
relinquish an inch of its territory or any Arab right. Syria is 
also not willing to exchange facts for illusions and to replace 
the Washington talks and the Madrid conference foundations by 
secret talks whose only aim is to circumvent the Security 
Council resolutions. 
  Under the headline "Rejected Call," AL-BA'TH says: News 
reports speak once again about an upcoming tour to the region by 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher late this month. 
Israel is also talking about what it called two papers on a 
settlement with Syria. The head of its government, Rabin, 
stressed the need for secret talks that would pave the way for 
the settlement. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: We can draw several conclusions in this 
regard, primarily the return of the U.S. Administration to the 
Middle East arena in a fresh bid to advance peace efforts by 
fixing a date for resuming bilateral talks. 
  Before moving on to the Israeli position, we must wonder how 
far Christopher will go in his upcoming tour. Will he view 
Rabin's statements as something new? 
  AL-BA'TH concludes: It is too early to pass judgment in this 
regard, since this depends on the way the U.S. secretary will 
deal with the Israeli government.

<F P=106> [From the "We Have a Word" column: "Foreign Investments"] </F>
  [Text] I believe that the real value of Encouragement of 
Investment Law No. 10 of 1991 lies in the fact that it is a 
major turning point and a qualitative leap on the course of 
development, and that it has opened the door wide for economic 
activity by removing all the obstacles that have piled up with 
time and deprived private enterprise of its creative role in the 
service of the homeland. 
  Law No. 10 is a real pillar and solid foundation on which we 
can build the economy -- hence its importance. This is how we 
should understand and comprehend the reasons and motives which 
underline the role and task of this law in drawing the features 
of future economic development. 
  It is our right now, three years after the issuance of that 
law, to reaffirm the very important role of this law and the 
achievements it has made, especially the extremely important 
role of attracting the investment of local and Arab capital in 
projects which will help achieve the aims of development. 
  We have spoken a great deal in the past about the investment 
climate in Syria. We said that it has many advantages, making 
it an ideal climate. We also explained that due to this law and 
this climate, scores of companies have set up businesses in 
Syria under the provisions of this law and benefited from its 
advantages. Now, however, we can also say with full confidence 
that we are on the threshold of a new phase which will witness 
an even greater flow of Arab and foreign investments. 
  We already have some important indicators. More and more 
applications are being submitted by Arab and foreign investors 
who want to set up major projects with the effective 
participation of Syrian businessmen. This steady increase in 
the number of applications and Arab and Foreign investors does 
not only reflect the new suitable investment terms and climate, 
but also the serious desire to expand the base of Arab and 
foreign investment. 
  These excellent conditions have not come out of vacuum. All 
indicators show that the Syrian economy, which is based on 
economic diversification and has given an active role to private 
enterprise, is now a strong and healthy economy. It has managed 
to achieve self-sufficiency in most production fields. It has 
increased production, especially agricultural production, 
manifold, provided the necessary services, broadened the base of 
production, and increased exports. All that was done in record 
time. 
  The average growth, which ranged from 8 to 9 percent in 
recent years; the stability of the Syrian pound against foreign 
currencies; the drop in the rate of inflation which did not 
exceed 8.5 percent last year are clearly significant indicators 
of the high standard of Syrian economic performance. 
  All indicators show that the Syrian economy will continue to 
be strong and healthy in the future. They also show that Arab 
and foreign investments will continue to flow, now that it has 
been decided to attach a special importance to this issue and to 
give it every care and attention.

  [Excerpt] To quench its thirst for killing, the savage 
militia of Golboddin-Dostam-Karmal today once again launched a 
rocket attack on residential areas and public installations in 
Kabul. A responsible security source reported to BIA that by 
firing 25 rockets into the city, the criminal and sold-out 
militia caused the martyrdom of one person and the wounding of 
nine of our oppressed and innocent compatriots. Similarly, as a 
result of the landing of today's rockets four residences were 
destroyed. [passage omitted]

  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? 
  [Buwayz] The issue is a legal one. [Words indistinct] it was 
a political decision that the government had to make. It did 
so. It decided to sever relations and to deport the diplomats 
who are here. As for the judiciary decision, since there is 
immunity in this particular case and in view of the overall 
circumstances of the case, it is up to the court to decide. The 
court, the judiciary, will be the one that will take the Vienna 
Convention and its own interpretations and apply them to this 
case. It will decide either that this case falls within the 
context of the Vienna Convention and, therefore, there is 
immunity or that the circumstances are beyond the Vienna 
Convention and that the Lebanese judiciary is not qualified to 
decide on the issue. The decision is up to the judiciary. 
  [Correspondent] Which judiciary? 
  [Buwayz] By judiciary I mean the court.

  [Excerpt] Bucharest, April 20 (AFP) -- PLO leader Yasir 
'Arafat called on Israel Wednesday [20 April] not to delay the 
implementation of an autonomy accord for the occupied 
territories. 
  Speaking ahead of a meeting here with Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres Thursday, he urged Israeli leaders "not 
to delay what have been agreed, not to delay the implementation 
of what have been agreed before." 
  The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization was 
referring to the April 13 deadline for the accord granting 
limited autonomy in Jericho and the Gaza Strip. 
  "Unfortunately our efforts and our negotiations with Israel 
still face great difficulties, so the date of April 13, when the 
Israeli occupation was supposed to end, has passed," he said. 
  'Arafat said he would meet Peres overnight Wednesday or 
Thursday morning. Peres arrived here late Wednesday. 
  'Arafat, originally scheduled to leave here Friday, will 
instead leave Thursday evening because of "an urgent meeting of 
the executive committee" of the PLO, he said. 
  A meeting to be chaired by the two men has been brought 
forward to Thursday for the same reason, he said. The meeting 
is to discuss Middle East economy and development issues, and 
will be followed by a press conference. 
  'Arafat was speaking to journalists after a meeting with 
Romanian President Ion Iliescu. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tunis, 20 Apr (MENA) -- Informed Palestinian sources 
have stated that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has entrusted Fatah 
Central Committee member Sakhr Habash, alias Abu-Nizar, to 
prepare a list of names of the Palestinian fighters who will 
enter Gaza and Jericho as a police force as well as a list of 
the names of the civilians who will enter the area in the early 
stages as a prelude to an agreement with the Israeli Government 
over these personnel. These sources said that a committee 
chaired by Abu-Nizar has been formed and comprises eight 
members, including Fatah Central Committee member 'Abbas Zaki 
and Fatah Revolutionary Council members. 
  These sources stated that many PLO leaders, cadres, and 
members will move to the temporary self-rule area in Gaza and 
Jericho in the next stage. They noted that this issue was 
recently discussed at a Fatah Central Committee meeting and that 
it was decided that the families of Palestinian fighters and 
civilians would enter Gaza and Jericho. 
  The sources said that 'Arafat notified the Palestinian 
leadership that the national authority would establish schools, 
hospitals, and other vital utilities in the Jericho area because 
it is sparsely populated and lacks such services. This is a 
sign that there is an intention to let the families of most 
Palestinian fighters who will work in the police force enter 
Jericho.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Apr (MENA)--Nine out of a group of 17 
Palestinian deportees arrived in Cairo from Algeria today. They 
were scheduled to return to the occupied territories last week. 
These deportees will be joined by eight others who will arrive 
tomorrow ahead of their return to the occupied territories. 
Deportee Muhammad Abu-Shanab said this group was deported in 
1989 for involvement in the intifadah. He said that despite his 
companions' joy over their return, they will be even happier 
when all the deportees return and all the detainees in Israeli 
jails are released.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Kamal Kharrazi, permanent </F>
representative to the UN, in New York by unidentified 
correspondent in Tehran--live] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Some minutes ago you heard on the 
news that the member countries of the Islamic Conference 
Organization's [ICO] contact group are to meet next week to 
examine the situation in Bosnia. In a telephone call to 
Kharrazi, our country's permanent UN representative, we asked 
him for an interview for the listeners. My colleagues inform me 
that Mr. Kharrazi is on the line: 
  Mr. Kharrazi, greetings and thank you for your cooperation. 
Last night it was announced at the UN Headquarters that the ICO 
contact group members are to meet next Wednesday to examine the 
situation in Gorazde and Bosnia. What is the reason for the 
delay in this meeting, especially in view of the heavy 
responsibility that the Islamic countries have in defending the 
Bosnian Muslims and the Muslims in Gorazde? 
  [Kharrazi] In the name of God, the almighty and merciful. 
You are absolutely right. The responsibility that the Islamic 
countries shoulder in this issue is extremely heavy. I believe 
that not only has the United Nations lost its credibility, but 
the Islamic countries too are losing their credibility because 
the Islamic countries could have done a great deal, especially 
in the form of multifaceted pressures on the Security Council 
and on the United Nations. 
  Now that this proposal has been adopted--and actually the 
decision that the ICO contact group's foreign ministers meet was 
proposed by Iran--once again this opportunity should be seized, 
although this meeting could have taken place sooner. However, 
naturally, a bureaucratic process was needed to call this 
session, the issue of visas, and operational problems. Thus, 
the ICO Secretariat has set Wednesday as the date for the 
session, even though this session could have been convened a few 
days sooner. 
  At any rate, this opportunity should be seized, and we hope 
that with the presence of the ICO contact group's foreign 
ministers, the necessary pressures can be brought to bear on the 
Security Council members and the Security Council can be given 
an ultimatum to end its indifference and to take action; 
otherwise, the Islamic countries will have to decide on their 
own. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you. Concerning the forthcoming 
session of the ICO contact group members, a question: Has the 
possibility been considered of the Islamic countries warning the 
Security Council that if it does not lift the arms embargo on 
Bosnia, they will do it themselves? How close to reality is 
this possibility in your opinion? 
  [Kharrazi] We hope that during this session, the foreign 
ministers will adopt a decisive decision. We should wait and 
see what these foreign ministers on the whole think. The 
atmosphere is extremely ripe and some of the countries are 
completely ready to take serious steps. However, we should wait 
and see what the decision of all the Islamic countries is and, 
God willing, act accordingly. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you. As my last question, many believe 
that as far as the tragedy of the fall of Gorazde is concerned, 
the UN secretary general did not use his authority and that with 
his procrastination he prepared the ground for Gorazde's fall 
with the help of the Western powers. Is this the prevailing 
view in the United Nations as well? 
  [Kharrazi] The same question is being asked by the 
representatives of various countries on whether the secretary 
general acted correctly or if he did not. When the secretary 
general himself is asked this question, his answer is: It is 
true that I have some authority, but I have to apply to the 
Security Council powers and ask for their view and decision. 
Actually, I only execute Security Council decisions and I must 
consult with the Security Council powers. 
  Of course, it is true that this is the Security Council's 
method and that the secretary general serves the Security 
Council and executes its decisions. However, at the same time, 
the secretary general has instruments in hand that he can use to 
inform the people. He can speak to them and express realities 
and his problems and, in short, give a push to the United 
Nations in general and the Security Council in particular. 
  The truth is that the United Nations in general and the 
Security Council in particular have completely lost their 
credibility on the Bosnian problem in general and in the Gorazde 
problem in particular. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Kharrazi, for answering our 
questions and for giving us your time. 
  [Kharrazi] You are welcome.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Apr (MENA)--Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin has praised President Husni Mubarak's role in supporting 
and promoting the Middle East peace process. 
  In a statement to the weekly AL-MUSAWWAR to be published on 
Friday [22 April], Rabin said President Mubarak helped greatly 
to continue the process and remove the obstacles in its way. 
  On the negotiations with Syria, the Israeli prime minister 
said he does not believe peace with Syria can be achieved 
without secret meetings. He pointed out that Israel held talks 
with the PLO in Oslo for six months and that that helped to 
achieve the Declaration of Principles. 
  He added: Our government was the first in Israel to accept 
Resolution 242 as a basis for peace with Syria, entailing 
withdrawal on the Golan [min fawq al-julan]. But Rabin added 
that the geographic scale of the withdrawal cannot be specified 
before Israel knows exactly what the Syrians mean by full peace. 
  Asked about the failure to implement the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement and the reason for the postponement, Rabin said: We 
have not postponed negotiations. We are ready to continue the 
talks indefinitely to reach an agreement that would achieve the 
goals of the transitional stage, overcome opposition by 
particular forces on both sides, achieve security for the 
Israelis, and grant the Palestinian council the authority to 
administer the Palestinian people's affairs. 
  Asked about ways to solve the problem of settlements, Rabin 
said that the agreement is very clear: It provides that all the 
settlements will stay where they are during the transitional 
stage. The PLO signed this agreement and we will discuss the 
settlements issue when we negotiate over the final solution. 
  Asked about negotiations with Jordan and Lebanon, Rabin 
said: 
We believed that we were close to an agreement with Jordan but, 
regrettably, our efforts did not succeed. We have virtually no 
territorial problems with Jordan. He stressed that Israel has 
no territorial problems with Lebanon but there is a security 
problem because the Lebanese Government cannot muster 
sovereignty over all its territory. We do not covet one inch of 
Lebanese territory and all that we hope is that the Lebanese 
Government can disengage the private military organizations. 
  On the possibility of holding a meeting between him and 
Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat, Rabin said: We must 
prepare for such a meeting because if we meet and fail to sign 
an agreement, our failure would cause disappointment and 
frustration and defeat our purpose of reaching an agreement that 
can be implemented.

  [Text] The prime minister has declared in the Rajya Sabha 
that there is no pressure from any quarter on the indigenous 
missile program. Mr. Narasimha also categorically stated that 
India will not be swayed in any manner by what Pakistan does. 
We have our own threat perceptions, and there is no question of 
equating India with Pakistan. 
  Intervening during question hour, the prime minister allayed 
fears that the United States is bringing pressure on the 
government to slow down the missile program. These are 
unnecessary doubts, he said, and added that since there is no 
pressure, the question of slowing down the development and 
induction of various missiles does not arise. Answering a 
supplementary, Mr. Narasimha Rao said many matters came up for 
discussion during the talks, the American deputy secretary of 
state, Mr. Talbott, had with him in New Delhi recently. Both 
sides, he said, agreed that there is no pressure on India and 
there should be none either. 
  Earlier, replying to the main question the minister of state 
for defense, Mr. Mallikarjun, told the members amid thumping of 
desks that the defense scientists have given the country the 
capability to counter any missile threat from Pakistan. He said 
there is no program to make any Intercontinental Ballistic 
Missile--ICBM. He said that Prithvi is expected to be inducted 
into the defense forces during the current financial year and 
Trishul next year. Development work on the medium range 
surface-to-air missile Akash and the third generation antitank 
missile Nag is expected to be completed during 1995-96. 
  After this, both these missiles will enter the phase of 
(?user class) -- production and induction. About Agni, he said, 
with the third test the technology demonstration of the reentry 
phase has been completed. In a written reply, Mr. Mallikarjun 
also informed the house that offers have been received from 
Russia, Israel, France, and Britain for the upgradation of the 
MiG-21 aircraft.

  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has said 
the 45-month-old Iraq embargo has created a major burden for 
Jordan, noting that the United States wants to find a way to 
ease this burden. 
  At a news conference via satellite today, Christopher said 
he 
hopes that, during his upcoming meeting with His Majesty King 
Husayn, he will bring proposals to ease the effects of the naval 
blockade of the Port of al-'Aqabah. 
  He further asserted that he respects Jordan's stand refusing 
to sign a peace treaty with Israel before resolving all 
outstanding issues between the two sides. He characterized 
Jordanian-U.S. relations as excellent. 
  Christopher also praised His Majesty King Husayn's 
statements 
last week, saying he is sure that Jordan does not want to host 
terrorism on its territory or allow its territory to be used to 
propagate terrorism and extremism. 
  The U.S. secretary said his country's position on the status 
of the city of Jerusalem has not changed. He said the question 
of Jerusalem is the most difficult one and should be defined 
within the context of the final stages. 
  Regarding his Middle East tour, scheduled to begin next 
Monday, Christopher asserted that Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad 
and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are determined to make 
progress in the peace negotiations. He said that during his 
tour he will convey messages between the two sides. He said his 
country is not proposing any package deal on peace, noting that 
his mission is only to facilitate negotiations between the 
parties and to talk to them about any messages they want to 
exchange or explain.

  [Text] Diplomatic sources in Cairo have revealed that 
secret negotiations have been going on between Washington and 
Damascus since February toward reaching an agreement on a 
working paper prepared by Washington on its concepts for 
building what it called confidence among the three parties. The 
paper emphasizes the fate of the Palestinian and Iranian 
organizations and of other extremist movements such as the 
Kurdish Workers Party. 
  During the meetings over the past few weeks, the United 
States reviewed a list prepared by the CIA of hundreds of 
leaders and members it claimed to be terrorists. It asked 
Damascus to define its stance on these members either by 
deporting them from Syria, arresting some of them, or handing 
over others to Western countries on terrorist charges that go 
back to the mid sixties. 
  The U.S. Congress asked the U.S. Administration to apply 
pressure on Syria to normalize ties with the Zionists in return 
for striking Syria off the list of countries supporting 
terrorism and to hand over several leaders of organizations 
labelled extremist to stand trial in U.S. federal courts, 
including Ahmad Jibril, Abu-Nidal, and approximately 70 other 
Palestinians.

<F P=106> [Article by Francis Ghiles: "Camdessus Casts a Line to </F>
Algiers"] 
  [Text] Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the 
International Monetary Fund [IMF], has taken a huge gamble. So 
has General Liamine Zeroual, the Algerian head of state. If 
they fail, neither the IMF nor the Algerian army will have 
another chance to save north Africa's largest country from a 
fate which a senior US official likened to one of "creeping 
Afghanisation". 
  Mr Camdessus has asked the board of the IMF to extend a $1bn 
(680m pounds) one-year standby loan to Algeria, which the board 
is expected to approve by the end of the month. He has called 
on Algeria's foreign creditors to follow the IMF and provide the 
country with a further $8bn-$9bn which it will need to pay its 
international way this year. 
  Of this total, $3.5bn would come from the rescheduling of 
the 
principal repayments of debt owed to its sovereign creditors, 
who are due to meet at a Paris Club meeting in mid-May; $1.5bn 
would come from the World Bank, African Development Bank and 
Arab Monetary Fund loans; $1bn from the European Union. and the 
balance from export credits which would be maintained at last 
year's level. 
  Algeria has already been asked to take its medicine. Three 
weeks ago the price of nine staple foodstuffs -- including 
flour, bread and milk were increased by between 25 and 100 
percent. This followed similar rises in the cost of petrol and 
domestic fuel. Other increases are intended to follow. 
  The dinar has been devalued by 40 percent and interest rates 
raised. Measures to liberalise foreign trade are expected this 
week. A later stage in the process will require state companies 
to shed excess labour. 
  Mr Redha Malek, the prime minister since last August, 
announced on Monday he was resigning. Foreign observers do not 
agree on why. It may be that he disagreed with the policy now 
openly pursued by Gen Zeroual of trying to talk to those members 
of the banned fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) who 
do not wish to see their country slide into total anarchy. 
  It may be that the head of state wanted to replace him with 
a 
technocrat who carries no political weight and whose job is that 
of the surgeon, a man who can be disposed of easily if the going 
gets rough. 
  Mr Mokdad Sifi, who is taking over, certainly fits that 
description. He comes from Tebessa, a town close to the 
Tunisian border which has provided many key figures to the 
Direction Generale de la Securite Nationale, the fount of much 
power in Algeria over 30 years. 
  Days before Mr Malek's departure, Mr Camdessus had 
expressed, 
in an interview with Algerian state television, much enthusiasm 
and hope about the process of economic reform upon which he felt 
Algeria was embarking. 
  Many Algerians hope the IMF chief's judgment is better 
vindicated by events than it was after the last agreement with 
the Fund. That accord, signed in June 1991, was followed 
promptly by the dismissal of the then reformist prime minister, 
Mr Mouloud Hamrouche. Mr Camdessus heaped praise on his 
successor, Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, whose policies went on in 
effect to destroy the economic reforms to which the IMF had just 
given its imprimatur. 
  The position today is incomparably worse. Some 4,000 
Algerians have died since elections, which the FIS was poised to 
win, were suspended in January 1992. Fierce repression has not 
prevented large areas of Algeria, including some cities, from 
slipping out of the state's control, notably at night. The 
hardline Islamic Armed Group is committing acts of terror on 
ordinary Algerians and has targeted foreigners, many of whom 
have fled the country. 
  Although this has helped bring Algeria's economy to its 
current state of semi-collapse, a main factor has been the fall 
in world prices of hydrocarbons, which account for 90 per cent 
of the country's foreign income. Foreign debt repayments would, 
in the absence of an agreement with the country's western 
creditors, absorb virtually all Algeria's forecast $9bn income 
this year. 
  As they consider the possible fate of a reform package now 
being put together, the country's foreign creditors are, in the 
words of one senior European banker, "functioning on a wing and 
a prayer". 
  So are 26m Algerians. As one sardonically commented: "The 
difference is that we are risking our lives while western 
countries are only risking their money."

<F P=106> [Article by Hamid Barrada: "Total War"; first paragraph is </F>
JEUNE AFRIQUE introduction] 
  [Text] In Algeria, the policy of dialogue with the 
Islamists has hardly been sketched out, but it is being 
violently combated by the Army. Here is the chronicle of chaos 
in the offing. 
  "We have in our hands all the winning cards for success." 
  So said Algerian Minister of Interior Salim Saadi on 23 
March. Quite obviously, his remarks have more to do with saber 
rattling or the Coue method than they do with an even slightly 
realistic assessment of the situation. Furthermore, to give his 
speech a degree of credibility, he was speaking in Blida, the 
center of Islamic fundamentalism. Prior to his speech, it had 
been necessary to make a three-day sweep of the "city of roses." 
Official result: 100 dead. By what miracle was it expected that 
the inhabitants, whom fear or conviction had led to side with 
the Islamists, would rally to the Army once the minister's 
speech was over? 
  Alain Juppe, the head of French diplomacy, is closer to the 
truth when he talks about "catastrophic deterioration." Losses 
in human life were estimated at about 15 per day at the start of 
this year, but they are much more numerous today. ACHARK 
AL-AWSAT, which, along with AL-HAYAT, another Arabic daily in 
London, provides the best coverage of the war, counted 1,000 
dead in the month of Ramadan alone. The targets are police 
officers, judges, journalists, and women, with deaths being 
announced every day. There are also the anonymous victims of 
reprisals carried out by the "ninjas." According to Amnesty 
International, "the security forces commit murders and carry out 
summary executions every day with complete impunity." 
  For their part, the guerrilla fighters have passed to a more 
advanced stage. One Western diplomat says: "With growing 
boldness, they are carrying out planned operations." It is not 
rare for groups of 120 or 130 fighters to attack Army units 
consisting of barely 40 or 50 soldiers. The demoralization among 
loyalist troops is shown by the mass desertions, particularly 
among conscripts. According to French intelligence reports, the 
ANP [People's National Army] can count on only 40,000 men, 
whereas the Islamic army can muster 10,000! That being the case, 
one can understand why the generals prefer to withdraw to their 
barracks even if it means abandoning entire regions to the enemy 
(see the map, which was originally published in LIBERATION).

are Saida, Tiaret, and Tissemsilt in the west; Blida, Larbaa, 
Baraki, and Dellys near Algiers; and Jijel, Collo, and Mila in 
the northeast.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  The situation is no more brilliant at the political level. 
All hope of settling the crisis has disappeared. That hope 
increased at the end of January, when Liamine Zeroual took over 
as head of state. A former general who is minister of defense as 
well as president, he seemed to be in the best position to seek 
a compromise with the rebellion. And in fact, he was soon 
talking about "serious dialogue" and "leaving no one out." 
Discreet contact was established with the FIS [Islamic Salvation 
Front] leaders in prison, especially Abbassi Madani and Ali 
Benhadj. General Tayeb Deradji, his go-between in those 
contacts, publicly mentioned the possibility of their release: 
"If it can put an end to the violence, why not?" Meanwhile, two 
other Islamic leaders were released. Besides, what was known of 
the FIS attitude was not unreasonable. It wanted the leaders of 
the armed rebellion to be included in the negotiations and asked 
that its leaders be released in order to talk to them. Of 
course, the whole problem would be to agree on a return to the 
electoral process and on the transitional period. But nothing 
seemed impossible, provided that the crisis was dealt with 
politically instead of by the "total security" approach that had 
been in effect for two years. 
  A few days later, the scaffolding had collapsed. President 
Zeroual's policy of dialogue had hardly been sketched out before 
being violently combated within the Armed Forces. The offensive 
began on 8 March. International Women's Day provided the 
occasion for denouncing plans to negotiate with the Islamists. 
Picking up on the fact that "Zeroual" rhymes with "seroual" 
("trousers"), one not-too-subtle banner called upon the 
president not to drop his pants [that is, not to lose his 
nerve]! That slogan was taken up by a daily newspaper close to 
the "eradicators." The funeral of the great dramatist Abdelkader 
Alloula in Oran on 16 March turned into a demonstration against 
"dialogue." In his funeral oration, Prime Minister Redha Malek, 
a supporter of "eradication," agreed completely. Three days 
later, the daily EL WATAN attacked President Zeroual by name. It 
said in substance that his policy lacked military support and 
was a long way from doing so. And that it was leading the 
country into disaster. 
  The article in EL WATAN was a first. The press, whether 
captive or diversified, had never before been seen attacking a 
president who is not only an Army man but also minister of 
defense to boot. It goes without saying that the newspaper was 
not demonstrating journalistic prowess. The explanation is of 
another kind altogether. 
  In the greatest secrecy and for three days running--16, 17, 
and 18 March--the heads of the Armed Forces conferred on the 
strategy to be adopted regarding the Islamic rebellion. Clearly, 
the policy of dialogue advocated by Zeroual was no longer 
supported by everyone. His fiercest opponent, General Mohamed 
Lamari, chief of staff and commander of the special forces, 
seemed to win out. The group broke up without reaching a 
decision. Publicly, however, the president talked about 
dialogue. The riposte came in the columns of EL WATAN. 
  That exchange--also unprecedented--was an extremely serious 
matter. The "military institution"--"the most democratic place 
in Algerian society," according to Remi Leveau--is in the habit 
of settling its differences by consensus. By making them public, 
it was in great danger of settling them by other means. Putting 
it plainly, the cohesion of the Armed Forces was at stake. Steps 
were quickly taken to limit the damage. And again by innovation. 
On 20 March, the general staff published a communique stating 
its support for Zeroual. The prime minister did the same. 
  Paradoxically, those gestures underscored the president's 
weakness, since the fact is that a boss does not need the 
support of his subordinates. Their purpose was to remind people 
that Liamine Zeroual had been made chief of state to carry out 
the policy of the Armed Forces, which now rule out any impulse 
toward negotiation in place of all-out war. To make sure that 
everyone got the point, EL WATAN did it again, followed this 
time by all the publications reflecting "democratic" opinion. 
  What is more, it was learned on 21 March that the chief of 
staff, Major General Mohamed Lamari, had been given signing 
authority by Gen. Liamine Zeroual, minister of defense and chief 
of state, with respect to "all acts and decisions, including 
ministerial orders." One detail missed by commentators was that 
that provision had been part of a presidential decree dated 5 
February. This means that as soon as he took office, and even 
though he continued to head the strategic Ministry of Defense, 
the new president had wasted no time putting someone else in 
charge of that ministry. It is true that Boumediene and Chadli, 
as chiefs of state and ministers of defense, had also signed 
such decrees. But the delegation of authority granted by them to 
the secretary-general of the ministry was purely administrative 
and could be revoked at any time. The circumstances in which 
delegation of authority was granted this time and the 
personality of the man to whom it was delegated show that 
something entirely different is involved: Zeroual is the 
official president and minister of defense, but the military 
strong man is Maj. Gen. Lamari. The fact that such a situation 
is being pointed out--and revealed--at this precise moment shows 
which side the "military institution" is on. 
  That is not all. On the 22d, the big demonstrations held in 
Algiers and other cities turned into a protest movement against 
Zeroual and dialogue. The climax came at a press conference held 
by the minister of interior in Blida the next day: on 23 March. 
Let us remember that date. If, God forbid, Algeria sinks into 
chaos because of a general civil war, Salim Saadi's speech will 
have been largely responsible. He likened the Islamists 
indiscriminately to the Khmer Rouge: "A small group of 
uneducated fanatics who have been joined by delinquents, 
ex-convicts, crooks, drug addicts, and a good many young people 
from families whose conduct during the struggle for liberation 
was not honorable." Okay. But what is to be done with them? Very 
simple: "Apply radical therapy to stamp out for good this evil, 
which is eating away at Algerian society and poisoning its 
existence." Why has the said therapy not worked so far? Simply a 
mistake in dosage, Dr. Saadi replies. "Now that we know the 
correct doses to administer to combat this evil,...." 
  From now on, as another minister of interior said during the 
first Algerian war, the only negotiation is warfare. How did 
Algeria reach such a point? What chance does that 
strategy--which is not a new one--have of succeeding? 
  Part of the answer will be found in the big escape from the 
fortress in Tazult (former Lambese) on 10 March. That breakout 
was undeniably a turning point in the war, if only because it 
provides a more accurate idea of the balance of forces. The 
operation was carried out by the MIA [Armed Islamic Movement], a 
strong presence in the region. But it is not impossible, as some 
sources claim, that it was planned in cooperation with the GIA 
[Armed Islamic Group]. It is estimated that in all, between 450 
and 500 fighters took part. And of those, 150 took the prison by 
storm. With the help of accomplices on the inside, they got in 
almost without firing a shot: only four guards were killed. 
Before the operation, other units had taken control of strategic 
points in the village of Tazult and on the main roads. The 
number of escapees varies depending on one's sources, but it was 
certainly higher than 1,000. A selection process took place: 
Islamic militants--some 700 of them, including 400 sentenced to 
death or life imprisonment--were freed as a matter of priority. 
Common prisoners were allowed to choose. Only about 100 chose to 
run. And they accounted for most of the fugitives killed or 
arrested: 24 and 114, respectively, according to official 
reports. The Islamists were immediately taken by car, truck, or 
bus to various regions. Most of them reached their destinations. 
Vehicles used in the escape were found in Annaba, Skikda, and 
Guelma, three northeastern towns. The operation had lasted one 
hour and 15 minutes. 
  The joint investigation conducted by the Ministries of 
Defense, Interior, and Justice revealed serious dysfunctions. 
Among other things, the general alert was declared in various 
cities at 1915. But in Batna, 40 km from the prison, nothing was 
done until after 2200. And Batna happens to be the home of the 
Armored School (8,000 men) and the rapid intervention forces of 
the police and the Gendarmerie. It was eight hours before the 
first reinforcements, from Khenchela 200 km away, arrived. The 
warden had submitted reports in 1992 asking that a cordon be set 
up outside the prison. Other, more recent, reports dealt with 
preparations for escape. There was no follow-up to any of those 
reports. It is understandable why the tripartite investigating 
committee produced not one but three reports in which each 
ministry tried to cast the blame on the others. 
  Theoretically, it was in order to come up with a calmer 
assessment of the Lambese affair--and of the increasing 
deterioration of the military situation it illustrated--that the 
generals held a conclave in mid-March. Their conclusions 
reflected their search for a scapegoat and their relentless 
pursuit of the same course of action despite the evidence. It is 
not by abandoning the policy of dialogue--which, it hardly needs 
stating, was never begun--that the Islamic rebellion is going to 
be put down. Moreover, total warfare is not something new: the 
Armed Forces have not tried anything else since the start of the 
conflict--with the success that we all can see. 
  The only thing new is the call-up of reservists that was 
announced by Salim Saadi in Blida. He was echoing certain 
statements by "democrats" calling for the organization of armed 
militias. Was he simply boasting? Whatever the case, if such a 
call-up took place, it would do nothing to change the course of 
the war. The number of reservists is estimated at 150,000 men. 
By what miracle would their state of mind be any different than 
that of the conscripts, most of whom flee the war when they do 
not swell the Islamic ranks? It is certain that their 
mobilization would be a gift from heaven for the rebellion.

<F P=106> [Article by al-Tahir Hammad: "Algeria: Belhaj Threatens </F>
Madani With Assassination, GIA (Armed Islamic Group) Splits Into 
Four Groups, Chebouti Plays Belhaj Card Against Madani"] 
  [Text] Algiers--The mass escape from Tazoult prison in the 
Aures Mountains was a powerful blow by the fundamentalists 
against the government in Algeria. The most serious consequence 
of the episode was the possibility that it might ignite the 
silent conflict among government figures, who have begun 
exchanging charges of complicity in helping the fundamentalists 
mount this attack on Algeria's highest security prison. Along 
with the increasing tightening of security, the recent operation 
has threatened to torpedo President Zeroual's efforts at 
dialogue. Moreover, other splits have broken out in the ranks of 
the Islamists and have become so acute that Ali Belhaj has 
threatened Abassi Madani with assassination. What is happening 
behind the scenes with the government and the fundamentalists in 
Algeria? 
  For the first time since Liamine Zeroual assumed power in 
Algeria, signs of splits among government figures have begun to 
appear, particularly between the president and Prime Minister 
Redha Malek. While President Zeroual has announced that the 
security policy followed for the past two years against 
fundamentalist terrorism has limits and does not constitute the 
only solution to the country's crisis, Redha Malek has ruled out 
returning to what preceded the crisis with the fundamentalists. 
Thus he has clearly indicated that he opposes the idea of 
dialogue with the historic leadership of the Islamic Salvation 
Front (FIS), the very dialogue that President Zeroual has 
engaged in both before and after his election. 
  Regarding these efforts at dialogue, informed Algerian 
sources have told AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI that a week before taking 
power President Zeroual visited Blida military prison, where he 
met Shaykh Abassi Madani, the head of the FIS. The same sources 
add that the president is convinced that the dialogue must 
continue and that Algeria can emerge from its crisis only if all 
parties without exception participate. The appointment of the 
chairman of the former dialogue committee, Youssef Khatib, as 
presidential advisor confirms this policy. 
<H5>  Government Figures Divided </H5>
  Opposition to this policy began to appear a few days ago 
inside the government. The prime minister chose a suitable 
opportunity to reveal the existence of this opposition when he 
announced his rejection of any return to what preceded the 
elections. An explanation for this clear position is that Malek, 
who knows the level of progress that the dialogue has made, 
wanted to divulge the content of the dialogue. Informed sources 
state that the head of the FIS, whom the government proposed 
releasing from prison before the Feast of Breaking the Ramadan 
Fast [3 March], refused to accept President Zeroual's condition 
to agree to talk on a personal basis, rather than as head of the 
FIS. Shaykh Abassi Madani stipulated that before he would 
continue talking with the government all FIS-member political 
prisoners should be released before the end of Ramadan and that 
the decree dissolving the FIS should be repealed. He demanded 
that legislative and presidential elections be held in one year, 
not in three years as was approved before Major General Zeroual 
was elected president. 
  Redha Malek's statement was considered a clear response in 
his own name and in the name of his supporters in the military 
establishment to the demands of the FIS leader. The statement 
constituted a warning to the president and to dialogue 
supporters about the danger of accepting these conditions and of 
pushing the dialogue to "undesirable consequences"--to causing a 
split in the military establishment. 
  The tightening of security has greatly contributed to 
revealing the splits in government positions. There have been 
numerous assassinations and terrorist acts. The operation of 
freeing over 1,000 prisoners from Tazoult prison in the Aures 
Mountains increased the tension even more between opponents and 
supporters of dialogue within the government. Some even started 
accusing opponents of having facilitated the Tazoult operation 
in order to impose their conditions and policy on President 
Zeroual's faction. 
  Clearly, everyone agrees that there were official factions 
involved in the prisoners' escape. In particular, about 450 
guards were outside the prison during the operation, and the 
intervention forces nearby in the area did not arrive at the 
prison until eight hours after they were notified. They had been 
notified three hours after the escape took place. 
  The accusations are not restricted to the radical wing of 
the 
army. The latter in turn accuses pro-dialogue factions of 
involvement in several incidents to prove that the security 
policy has failed and that there is no solution but dialogue. 
Such charges focus on senior military intelligence officials 
whom Chief of Staff Mohamed Lamari, the leader of the radicals, 
has been unable to transfer into retirement. He had presented a 
list of about 25 high officers whom he asked to be changed, but 
President Zeroual, who is also minister of defense, rejected the 
request. 
<H5>  Islamist Splits </H5>
  The government's position and the conflict between dialogue 
supporters and opponents are complicated by an increase in 
terrorist operations and by the existence of disagreements and 
divisions within the fundamentalist movement. 
  Algerian sources state that disagreement has emerged 
recently 
between the two leaders of the FIS, Shaykh Abassi Madani and 
Imam Ali Belhaj, who is known to be the leader of the hard-line 
faction. The sources say that Abassi Madani has lost much of his 
influence on the FIS and its base because of his having fallen 
into the trap of dialogue and that it will be impossible for the 
dialogue to produce results unless Ali Belhaj is brought in. 
Some assert that the conditions that Abassi Madani proposed to 
President Zeroual were really those of Belhaj, who pressured 
Madani, prevented him from completing a deal with the 
government, and threatened him with assassination. 
  Clearly, divisions in the fundamentalist movement are 
preventing a political solution to the crisis from being reached 
and thus are encouraging the factions that support military 
action. It should be noted that the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), 
which was led by Djaffar El Afghani (he, along with seven of the 
group's leaders, was killed), has split into four groups. There 
is a group in the capital, led by Abdelkader Hattab (known as 
Mouloud), who has threatened to continue assassinations until 
the government falls. The group controls the Bordj El Bahri 
quarter. Abdelkader Hattab has been accused of having 
assassinated former Prime Minister Kasdi Merbah in August 1993 
and of having assassinated the head of television, Mustapha 
Abada. 
  Then there is the group of Sayeh Attia, the recently elected 
successor to Djaffar El Afghani. The group controls the Media 
area near Algiers. It is considered responsible for the murder 
of 12 Croatians, a governor, and 18 employees of the 
governorate, including the chief of intelligence. The third 
group is led by Khaled Sehili, who with his group controls the 
city of Blida. He is accused of about 150 operations, 
particularly the murder of 400 soldiers. 
  Controlling the popular quarter of Sidi Bel Abbes in the 
capital is a fourth group, led by Kada Benchiha, who is accused 
of the murder of several French and one Briton. A peculiarity of 
this group is that it decapitates its victims after killing them. 
  Attention is now focused on the GIA, which is considered to 
be the FIS's historic military arm. It is led by Abdelkader 
Chebouti, who has links to senior intelligence officers and has 
on a number of occasions been shielded by them so that he should 
not fall into traps set for him by the police and army in a 
number of areas. Chebouti was able to attract the officer Said 
Mekhloufi, who held the post of editor-in-chief of the magazine 
AL-JAYSH. Mekhloufi is now responsible for organizing military 
cells and training groups called "The Islamic Forces." This is 
an organization modeled after the official army and armed with 
machine guns. These groups control the coastal roads west of the 
Algerian capital and south of it, particularly in the Amour 
Mountains. 
  The armed Islamic movement seems to have become active again 
after the death of GIA leader El Afghani. Chebouti is considered 
to be a supporter of Ali Belhaj and holds a position opposing 
FIS leader Shaykh Abassi Madani. 
  He is also an opponent of dialogue with the government. He 
has announced on more than one occasion that he will not stand 
with his hands tied in the face of government attempts to draw 
some leaders into dialogue. He has threatened moderates with the 
severest punishment. 
  The division in the fundamentalist movement and the lack of 
a 
unified leadership undoubtedly complicate the situation, 
particularly the situation of Major General Zeroual, who has set 
all his hope on making the dialogue successful. In the next few 
weeks he is expected to try to change the balance of forces in 
his favor. 
  There is much talk now about the existence of a plan to make 
changes in the government. Perhaps these reports are what led 
Redha Malek to open fire on dialogue supporters within the 
government.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Rosenfeld] </F>
  [Text] Palestinians in the autonomous areas will be able to 
sell gasoline for 15 percent less than the price in Israel as 
part of the economic agreement between Israel and the 
Palestinians. 
  Finance Minister Avraham Shohat said Friday the agreement 
could be concluded at the end of this week's round of 
discussions in Paris, as the sides have already reached 
agreement on most of the issues on the table. 
  At a news conference called to report on the progress 
reached 
in the last round of talks, which concluded last Tuesday, Shohat 
denied that the closure of the territories was designed to put 
pressure on the Palestinians at the negotiating table. 
  However, he admitted that the closure created tension last 
week with the Palestinian delegation, which, in reaction, 
deferred negotiations on labor issues. 
  Shohat reported that the sides have reached final agreement 
on agriculture, energy and industry. The sides have also 
reached a conditional agreement on taxation, which will be 
finalized when they agree on a Value Added Tax (VAT) rate for 
the autonomous areas. Shohat added that there is still 
disagreement on the creation of a Palestinian currency, which 
Israel opposes. 
  Budget Director David Brodet said that the energy agreement 
which allows the Palestinians to sell gasoline for 15 percent 
less than the price in Israel may increase the competition in 
Israel. However, the Palestinians received this concession from 
the Israelis based on commitments by oil-producing countries to 
provide them with below price crude oil. 
  The energy agreement, like the industry agreement, sets the 
industrial, safety and ecological standards on the respective 
products covered. Unlike the industry agreement, the energy 
agreement sets the standards for all the petrochemicals entering 
the autonomous areas. By contrast, the industry agreement only 
sets standards for products that will enter Israel from the 
areas. Industrial products remaining in the areas will not need 
to conform with those standards. 
  The agriculture agreement also allows for free trade between 
the autonomous areas and Israel, with the exception of tomatoes, 
cucumbers, eggs, potatoes and chickens, said Brodet. Those 
products will be subject to quotas which will be gradually 
phased out over a four-year period. 
  Shohat said that discussions on labor relations will take 
place this week. He added that both sides benefit from 
Palestinian labor in Israel, and that Israel will impose neither 
a ceiling nor a floor for Palestinian labor and will retain the 
right to control the workers' entry into the country. 
  Shohat also said that three-quarters of the income tax 
collected from Palestinians working in Israel will be forwarded 
to the autonomous authorities since they will provide the 
workers with services. 
  The only remaining bone of contention on taxation is the 
rate 
of VAT in the autonomous areas. Shohat reported that the 
Palestinians want a VAT of between 15 percent and 16 percent, 
while Israel wants it between 16 percent and 17 percent. 
  The sides have agreed to impose the same duties, with 
exceptions for equipment essential for development of the 
autonomous areas and limited imports from Arab countries. The 
Palestinians will be able to impose whatever income tax rates 
they want. 
  Shohat said that although the economic agreement could be 
concluded this week, the Palestinians will only move based on 
the progress achieved in the political talks in Cairo. He added 
that there are no impediments on Israel's side to sign the 
economic agreement before the political agreement. 
  If the economic agreement is ready before, only the issue of 
coordinating the imposition of duties at Palestinian points of 
entry will be required, Shohat said. 
  Shohat rejected the notion that the closure is being used as 
a means to put pressure on the Palestinian negotiators. As 
proof, he pointed to the NIS [new Israeli shekels] 28 million 
the government is spending in the territories to fund public 
works during the closure. 
  "The closure decision is a decision that derives exclusively 
from security considerations, despite the fact that even with 
the closure terrorist acts occur," said Shohat.

<F P=106> [Report by David Makovsky and news agencies] </F>
  [Text] The Cairo talks on Palestinian self-rule ran into a 
crisis yesterday over the scope of Palestinian jurisdiction in 
Gaza and Jericho, chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th said. 
  The talks in Cairo were also deadlocked on an amnesty for 
Palestinian prisoners and a map out-lining areas of Israeli 
control in the Gaza Strip, sources close to the talks said. 
  Sha'th, asked if there was a crisis over Palestinian 
jurisdiction, said: "Yes, there is. 
  "A major problem remains to be solved... it is the problem 
of 
jurisdiction... It must be solved if there is any seriousness to 
finish these negotiations on time," he told reporters. 
  Sha'th complained that Israel, in demanding legal authority 
over Israelis and foreigners inside future Palestinian areas, 
was ignoring the Declaration of Principles signed by the two 
sides last September. 
  "When we say that there is Palestinian jurisdiction in Gaza 
and Jericho, this means that Palestinian law is the one that 
prevails," he said. 
  Sha'th urged that the rules for law and courts in Gaza and 
Jericho should follow international practices. 
  "If a person commits a crime in London, even if he is 
Belgian 
or French, he is tried in London," he said. "Therefore, it has 
to be the same with us. 
  The PLO negotiator also complained about Israel's arrest 
yesterday of about 400 Palestinians opposed to the peace talks, 
saying the last days of negotiations should not be "used for 
more suffering and detaining and more torment of our people's 
sons." 
  Sha'th did not suggest pulling out of peace talks over the 
legal jurisdiction dispute. He noted agreements were reached 
yesterday in other areas such as broadcasting rights and 
cellular telephones, and said progress was made on water sharing. 
  Israeli delegates did not talk to reporters yesterday about 
the jurisdiction question. Delegation head Maj.-Gen. Amnon 
Shahaq returned to Israel last night to brief Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres on the talks. 
  Another PLO delegate, Muhammad Dahlan, said that the talks 
were also still stymied on the number of Palestinian prisoners 
that Israel would set free and when. 
  Israel has refused to release those who belong to Hamas and 
those convicted of violent crimes. 
  Dahlan maintained that with peace at hand, all those who 
took 
part in the Palestinian struggle should be freed. He pointed 
out that the PLO was negotiating with Hamas to overcome its 
opposition to the peace process and prevent internal battles 
once the Palestinians take over in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Meanwhile, senior Foreign Ministry officials are playing 
down 
expectations in advance of a meeting between Peres and PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Bucharest, to take place either 
tomorrow or Friday. 
  "There will be no Gaza-Jericho signing in Bucharest," a 
senior Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  It is expected, however, that Peres and 'Arafat will discuss 
the issues in dispute in Cairo. Peres is likely to reiterate 
Israel's opposition to PLO-Hamas coordination on issues related 
to violence. 
  In remarks at the Knesset foreign affairs and defense 
committee yesterday, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin reiterated he 
viewed PLO- Hamas cooperation on violence against Israelis as a 
"red line" that would cause the dissolution of the Oslo accords. 
  At the same time, he indicated that he did not oppose 
cooperation between the two in other areas such as social 
welfare, sources present at the meeting said. 
  Foreign Ministry officials also insisted last night that a 
planned meeting between Peres and Jordan's Prime Minister 
'Abd-al- Salam al-Majali will not occur, since al-Majali has 
decided to remain in Amman. 
  On the issue of Jordan, Rabin told MKs [Knesset members] 
that 
the Jordanian decision to confiscate the passports of two Hamas 
militants in Amman demonstrated that King Husayn is "starting to 
take steps" to move against the group.

<F P=106> [Report by John Rettie: "Oppressed of India' Turn on Gandhi"] </F>
  [Text] Delhi -- For the first time since Mahatma Gandhi's 
assassination 46 years ago, his role as the revered and saintly 
"father of the nation" is being challenged by leaders of the 
people he called Harijans or Children of God -- the Untouchables. 
  Now calling themselves Dalits -- the Oppressed -- the 
leaders 
of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which was swept to power in 
the northern state of Uttar Pradesh last year, have denounced 
Gandhi as "the biggest enemy of Dalits". 
  The upper castes who dominate the media, the bureaucracy and 
the armed forces have reacted with outrage. But conscious of 
the new-found voting power of the Dalits, India's Brahmin prime 
minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao, went to Bombay yesterday to 
unveil a statue of their hero, the late Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. 
  "Ambedkar carried out the daunting task of demanding rights 
for the lowest people, but the still more daunting task of 
implementing his ideals remains," Mr Rao said. "Only when caste 
discrimination stops and political parties stop getting mileage 
out of these divisions can we say his dream has come true." 
  Mr Rao was not the only one to cash in on the 103rd 
anniversary of the birth of Ambedkar, the Untouchable who beat 
the system by going to the United States and Britain, becoming a 
brilliant lawyer and drafting India's constitution. 
  The leaders of many states and political parties attended 
public meetings, to be seen garlanding his statues or unveiling 
new ones. 
  The day emphasised what last November's elections had shown 
-- that Dalits are at last demanding their rights. 
  Gandhi, whose trader caste is a sub-group of Vaishnya, third 
on the overall scale, grew up as an orthodox Hindu, although he 
opposed the denigration of Untouchables. For much of his life 
he believed in caste as an orderly system of doing one's duty 
and "following one's father's calling" which would protect India 
from the greed and venality of the West. But as a result of his 
long dispute with Ambedkar, he gradually accepted that the rigid 
caste system was unjust, and he even advocated inter-caste 
marriage. 
  To modern Dalit leaders this change was too little and too 
late. 
  "Our society is still dominated by upper castes who are 
chelas (disciples) of Gandhi" said Ms Mayawati, deputy leader of 
the BSP. 
  "These people treat Gandhi as their god. I don't." 
  She accused him of "gestures smacking of tokenism" when he 
helped Untouchables to clean latrines and shared meals with them 
-- practices which caste Hindus regard as intolerably polluting. 
  "There is a new awakening among the Dalit masses who realise 
that they were misled all these years," she declared. "This 
awakening is bound to result in them becoming more assertive in 
demanding their rights. If they don't get them, they'll fight." 
  The veteran socialist historian, sociologist and one-time MP 
Madhu Limaye said the BSP was making a serious blunder. The 
Dalits' situation was still bad, although, with reserved 
positions for them in parliament, the bureaucracy and the 
forces, "it is much better than in my youth". 
  "Mayawati and others are causing great harm to the Dalits 
because they'll lose the sympathy of millions of Dalits who 
respect Gandhi," he said. 
  While Gandhi has certainly been idolised in the past, even 
by 
many Dalits, the independent country he forged has done little 
for the overwhelming majority of Dalits. 
  The BSP is the engine of their impatience, but whether it 
can 
be the vehicle that will solve their problems, is another 
matter. Mr Limaye thinks not. He accused the BSP leader, 
Kanshi Ram, of dismissing questions about his economic policies 
by saying: "Just give us power, the rest will follow." 
  "A party with no policy for production and creating jobs has 
no future," Mr Limaye declared. "It may not last for more than 
three years."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Death Over Iraq"] </F>
  [Text] President Saddam Husayn's cruel and lawless regime 
yesterday claimed the lives of 26 more Allied servicemen. The 
direct cause of their deaths, in the shooting down over northern 
Iraq of two US helicopters carrying British, French, American, 
and Turkish officers, was that most embarrassing and terrible of 
military accidents known as friendly fire. American aircraft 
monitoring the "no-fly zone north of the 36th parallel 
mistakenly took the two Black Hawks for the Hinds used by the 
Iraqi military. This was an accident that should not have 
happened if established military procedures had been properly 
followed, and the Pentagon's investigation must be swift and 
thorough. 
  But Saddam's brutality towards his own people is the reason 
for the presence in Iraq of the officers, and for the military 
surveillance operation itself. They were on a mission to liaise 
with Kurdish leaders and United Nations officials on ways to 
counter the increased threat from Baghdad to the aptly named 
Operation Provide Comfort. This humanitarian rescue mission was 
launched, at John Major's instigation, in April 1991 when 
Saddam's troops drove nearly two million Iraqi Kurds to what 
would otherwise have been death from exposure and starvation in 
the mountains to which they had been forced to flee. Three years 
after Iraq was chased out of Kuwait, Saddam still poses so 
direct a menace to Iraq's Kurdish citizens that they remain 
heavily dependent on UN assistance, within a "safe haven" which 
has constantly to be monitored by a multinational taskforce. 
  Saddam has subjected this wholly admirable humanitarian 
operation to constant and brutal harassment. He has imposed an 
economic blockade against the north far more savage than the UN 
sanctions against which he inveighs. Iraqi agents constantly 
attempt to project into the safe haven the systematic state 
terror condemned by the UN's special rapporteur on human rights 
in the rest of Iraq as "crimes against humanity". UN guards 
protect relief workers, journalists and human rights monitors 
from ambushes, car-bombs and other forms of armed harassment. 
Since the beginning of March alone, eight UN guards have been 
murdered or wounded by Iraqi agents, in an escalation of attacks 
which supports the US State Department's allegation that Saddam 
has put a bounty of up to 6,000 pounds on the heads of UN 
personnel and other foreigners. 
  The tension has increased since mid-March, when Saddam 
issued 
unspecific threats that Iraq would not "stand with its hands 
tied" and his key aides vowed, rather more specifically, to 
"return the beloved north to the motherland". Since then, the 
three army corps permanently stationed just below the 36th 
parallel have been reinforced by the deployment of three 
divisions of crack Republican Guards to join two already there. 
The Allied military force based at Incirlik in Turkey, which 
polices the no-fly zone imposed in August 1992, has been on 
heightened alert against a repetition of last year's Iraqi 
attacks on Allied aircraft. Saddam has been emboldened by the 
emergence of divisions within the UN Security Council over 
sanctions. Previous decisions to maintain them have been 
routine, but last month's was reached only after three days of 
intense discussion, with Britain and America resisting French, 
Russian and Chinese pressure to ease them. Firmness remains 
vital. Sanctions must not be relaxed until Iraq is in total 
compliance with all relevant UN resolutions. The UN needs at 
least a year to be sure that Iraq cannot manufacture prohibited 
weaponry and is finally co-operating fully with the UN's 
systematic longterm monitoring programme to prevent future 
cheating; but that is not the only issue. Saddam has yet to 
account for hundreds of Kuwaitis and other hostages taken during 
the Gulf War. Above all, in defiance of the UN ceasefire 
resolution and international law, he has renewed his claim to 
Kuwait. For all these reasons, his criminal regime remains as 
clear a threat to international peace as it is to the wellbeing 
of Iraq's terribly persecuted people. There is no case for 
letting vigilance slip.

<F P=106> [Interview with al-Bayyati, "leader of the Iraqi opposition </F>
in exile," by Barbara Stefanelli in London; date not given: "We 
Are Boosting the Challenge; Help Us Overturn the Regime" -- 
first three paragraphs are CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction] 
  [Text] For a few hours at the Iraqi National Council -- in 
its London headquarters -- everything ground to a halt around 
the information received from its own sources: two U.S. 
helicopters brought down over Kurdistan. 
  Had Iraqi President Saddam finally committed a fatal error, 
venting months of rage and powerlessness against "any old" enemy 
target? The leaders of the Council, which brings together the 
six groups opposing the Baghdad regime, were expecting something 
of key importance for the entire country to happen soon, and 
this "something" would open up a breach through which to start 
fighting the president once again. 
  Exiled opposition leader al-Bayyati told me: "We were the 
first to hear about the choppers being shot down and the first 
to spread the news. We were certain that, sooner or later, 
Saddam would go for a surprise action, to break the blockade of 
silence and hunger into which he has been pushed by the UN 
embargo and international isolation. 
  [Stefanelli] So you see the regime's hand behind the 
shooting 
down of the helicopters. 
  [Al-Bayyati] We never received any information or signs 
indicating that. Whatever the reason, it is a sign that the 
tension has risen dramatically in Kurdistan: Even before the 
end of Ramadan two divisions of the Republican Guard, the 
military elite, were deployed and took up positions in the 
Kirkuk and Mosul areas. Some expected the customary brutal 
repression against the Kurds, as has happened at other times of 
crisis in the regime. But no, nothing. However, the danger has 
not gone away: Saddam has entered a terminal phase, 
increasingly alone, not even succeeding in "feeding" the 
traditional caste of privileged people -- in the Army, the 
services, the party -- which forms his power base. Do you 
understand? Trapped in this corner, he will choose to act, to 
strike in one way or another: in the North, the South, over the 
borders. He will not wait for his head to fall under the slow 
guillotine of sanctions. 
  [Stefanelli] Let us just suppose showdown point is reached: 
Driven by desperation, Saddam launches a new attack and the 
international community responds; are you people in opposition 
ready? Are you united, and do you represent a concrete 
alternative? 
  [Al-Bayyati] We are a coalition of groups, we have been 
working together since 1983 and -- more especially -- since the 
war between Saddam Husayn and the international forces. We have 
reached a common agreement, despite the differences remaining 
between the groups represented in our front, an agreement on two 
points: First, freeing ourselves from the current regime. 
Second, implementing democracy. It will be up to the Iraqi 
people to elect the president and parliament. The one who gets 
the majority will govern, the others will go into opposition. 
Classic rules, no problems. But that will come later: Today 
we are moving ahead united, and we will fight against a common 
enemy. 
  [Stefanelli] But how do you intend to fight? Do you have 
weapons? Who is backing you? 
  [Al-Bayyati] We have relations with all the countries in the 
region. Kuwait, for example, has helped us and is continuing to 
do so. Our guerrillas have infiltrated everywhere: in the 
marshes to the south of the country, in Kurdistan where we have 
our headquarters, and also in Baghdad where opposition is 
growing. We are receiving arms and money. Iraqi businessmen 
and companies outside the country are very generous. We are 
receiving political and logistic support from other countries. 
Right now we are strengthening our contacts within the Iraqi 
Army. Certain officers, increasingly higher in rank, have 
deserted to our side and are serving as bridges. We are certain 
that, when the spark is ignited, military and civilians will 
unite against the regime. 
  [Stefanelli] Three years ago the people seemed to be almost 
all on Saddam's side, with the exception of the Kurds and a 
large part of the Shiite community. What consensus can the 
president count on today? 
  [Al-Bayyati] I would say that consensus no longer exists. 
People are hungry and reduced to unbearable poverty. Saddam's 
three traditional circles of allies are shrinking: The Sunnite 
minority, which has so far controlled wealth and power, is no 
longer fully behind him, nor is the clan from Takrit [as 
published], the dictator's birthplace and the heart of the 
regime. But what speaks loudest is the fact that not even his 
family, the closest and most basic circle, is now 100-percent 
behind him. The plots and ensuing reprisals -- the purges which 
have followed one after the other in these three years of Iraqi 
decline -- have split the old power system right across the 
board and for good.
