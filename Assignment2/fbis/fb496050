<F P=106> [Report by Hemi Shalev] </F>
  [Text] A senior official in the Jerusalem Foreign Ministry 
this week sent an extraordinary telegram to the Israeli Embassy 
in Washington, containing strong criticism of the "hesitant" 
foreign policy of the U.S. Administration and negative personal 
comments about senior administration officials. 
  In a comprehensive and secret survey on U.S. foreign policy, 
Eytan Bentzur, the deputy director general of the Foreign 
Ministry, in charge of North America and Disarmament Affairs 
Division, states that "we witness hesitancy with regard to 
handling foreign policy, with determined positions being adopted 
in crises areas only." Bentzur states that the U.S. foreign 
policy "is seen as lacking in vision and determination," 
according to the order of priorities set by President Clinton. 
  William Perry, the new U.S. defense secretary, is described 
by Bentzur as a "second-rate appointment who does not conform 
with the level of the first round of appointments by the 
administration." As for Anthony Lake, the President's national 
security adviser, Bentzur states: "It has been years since the 
United States had a leader of the National Security Council who 
is such an introverted and withdrawn person hesitating to leave 
his mark on anything." 
  Bentzur also strongly attacks Martin Indyk, National 
Security 
Council official in charge of Arab-Israeli affairs, following a 
briefing Indyk gave to Israeli reporters in Washington this 
week, in which he expressed fears about Yasir 'Arafat's power. 
"The briefing was bewildering," Bentzur states, since in 
addition to expressing concern, Indyk also talked of "the fear 
and doubt which has seized large sectors of Israel about the 
chances of the success of the Document of Principles." 
  "The peace team is also giving rise to quite a bit of 
concern," Bentzur continues. "The vision, the determination, 
the resolve, and the creativity" manifest under the leadership 
of the previous secretary of state "is not manifested at this 
stage of the process."

  [Text] Following MA'ARIV's 18 April report on Assistant 
Foreign Ministry Director General Eytan Bentzur's assessments 
regarding of the functioning of the U.S. Administration, the 
foreign minister's bureau sought to clarify that Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres "highly appreciates the efforts of the 
U.S. secretary of state and the American peace team, who have 
greatly contributed to the peace process, and thanks the Clinton 
Administration in general for the warm attitude it has shown 
Israel." 
  The bureau's statement asserted that the Foreign Ministry 
"was not party to the opinions of the senior official with 
regard to the policies of the Administration and the peace team 
and these opinions are merely his own personal views."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Mideast: Observers in Hebron By May, </F>
Italian Diplomats Say"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Tel Aviv, April 17 -- Barring unforeseen 
obstacles, international peacekeepers from Norway, Denmark, and 
Italy may begin deployment in the West Bank city of Hebron by 
the end of April or the beginning of May, according to Italian 
diplomats here. Delegations from the three countries, which in 
March proposed sending observers under a so-called Temporary 
International Presence in Hebron [TIPH], are continuing 
preparations to send 90 Norwegians, 35 Danes and 35 Italians in 
the Israeli-occupied city where tensions have been escalating 
ever since a Jewish settler opened fire on dozens of 
Palestinians as they prayed in the Hebron mosque on February 25. 
  The diplomats told ANSA that the two high-ranking 
Carabinieri 
police officers and Rome Foreign Ministry officials who visited 
Hebron on April 11 have been shuttling between the Palestinian 
city, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem with their counterparts from Norway 
and Denmark in an effort to resolve a series of practical 
problems, such as deciding where the observers will reside. 
  The TIPH members will be carrying only light weapons for 
self-defense and hope to ease tensions between Israeli settlers 
and the armed forces and local residents. 
  A memorandum officially getting the mission under way should 
be signed in Copenhagen some time at the end of next week and 
unless new obstacles are raised, deployment may begin as early 
as the end of the month, the diplomats said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Sarah Honig] </F>
  [Text] Former Health Minister Hayim Ramon will be formally 
expelled from the Labor Party at midweek, it was decided at 
yesterday's session of the Labor Political Bureau, prior to the 
meeting of the Labor ministerial caucus. 
  Along with Ramon, MKs [Knesset Members] 'Amir Peretz and 
Shmu'el Avital will also be expelled for joining Ramon in his 
independent Histadrut [Labor Federation] list, challenging the 
official Labor list. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday for the first time 
put 
his full political weight against Ramon, who was the minister 
closest to him until recently, and who engineered Rabin's own 
1992 electoral victory. 
  By doing so, Rabin staked his own political reputation 
against Ramon's in what is expected to be a bitter, 
no-holds-barred battle by Labor to retain its Histadrut hegemony. 
  Rabin told the political bureau members that there is "no 
room for considering pros and cons and for making political 
calculations. The party constitution could not be clearer. 
Anyone who is a Labor member but nevertheless runs against a 
Labor list in any election, is automatically ousted from the 
party. We are dealing with the basics of democracy." 
  "The party conducts primaries and if some of the members 
don't accept the results of a democratic vote, then they can 
potentially wreck the entire democratic framework. They can 
cause this party to crumble from the inside. There comes a time 
when there are phenomena no party can tolerate. Party members 
cannot both campaign against their own party and at the same 
time continue to belong to it," Rabin argued. 
  Ramon is expected to formally submit his Histadrut list to 
the elections committee tomorrow, though he has until the 
Wednesday deadline to do so. The minute his candidacy is filed, 
procedures in Labor will begin to expel him and his two allies. 
  Yesterday's ministerial caucus and bureau session marked the 
total failure of the party moderates to prevail upon Rabin not 
to ban Ramon, Peretz, and Avital just yet. 
  One argument was that Ramon's list might win, or at least be 
able to form a coalition, which would oust Labor from its 
73-year Histadrut hegemony, in which case it would do well for 
Labor to claim Ramon as one of its own. 
  Another argument was that even if Ramon is expelled from the 
party, he and his friends could still remain in the Knesset 
faction, as the Knesset rules do not address themselves to a 
situation in which a party expels a member, but only to walkout 
scenarios. 
  Rabin was warned that if Ramon is expelled from the Knesset 
faction as well, this could set a precedent for those who oppose 
the government's dovish line in the peace talks. But Rabin, say 
sources, not only refused to be swayed by these arguments, but 
maintained that Ramon must be harshly dealt with as a deterrent 
to other would-be "troublemakers."

  [Text] If the election for prime minister were held today, 
Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu would get 44 percent of the vote 
to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's 38 percent, according to 
Gallup-Israel. Eighteen percent of the respondents were 
undecided. 
  This is the first time since Netanyahu's election as Likud 
party chairman that he topped Rabin. However, in a three-way 
race, in which Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan would also be a 
candidate, Rabin would receive the largest number of votes -- 34 
percent, to Netanyahu's 29 percent and Eytan's 18 percent. 
  The poll, taken in regular intervals since January, shows a 
steady decline in Rabin's popularity, from a peak of 44 percent 
in a three-way race on January 31st, and 49 percent against 
Netanyahu's 34 percent in a two-way match on that date. 
  The sample is country-wide, representing 500-600 Hebrew 
speaking adults. The margin of error is 4 percent.

  [Excerpt] Cairo/Tripoli (DPA) -- According to Western 
diplomats in Tripoli, the Libyan authorities have released the 
bodies of an official of the German Federal Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution [BfV] and his wife after carrying 
out an autopsy. They are now to be brought to Germany as 
quickly as possible, diplomats in the Libyan capital told DPA in 
reply to a telephone inquiry on Wednesday [20 April]. 
  According to the results of the investigations so far, the 
Libyan auth orities assume that the couple fell victim 
to a robbery. However, investigations have not yet been 
concluded. At the moment, there are no indications of any 
connection between the man's violent death and his work as 
section head in Department 6 of the BfV. This department deals 
with foreigner extremism and international terrorism. 
  Robberies of tourists have increased, a Western diplomat 
said. However, it is unclear whether the victims were indeed 
robbed. Money and Eurocheques were found on them. 
  Circles of Western intelligence services operating in the 
Middle East have said that it is extremely unlikely that Mr. 
Becker was engaged in covert investigations in Libya. However, 
one cannot rule out that there was indeed a link between 
Becker's work and the motive for the deed, such as an act of 
revenge. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Rafiq al-Zayn in Beirut] </F>
  [Text] As the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations falter, and 
as the PLO enters a hectic race between peace and war, the 10 
Palestinian factions decided to take the offensive, and worked 
out a scheme to wreck the peace process in cooperation with 
Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Sudan. They began to form a "Palestinian 
Revolutionary Army," which will be based in Tehran. What are 
the details of this scheme, and what are the chances of the 
opposition Palestinian alliance's success in light of Iranian 
efforts to push Hamas as the leader of this alliance? 
  A high-ranking Palestinian delegation representing the 10 
Palestinian factions opposed to the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
arrived in the Libyan capital a few days ago. 
  What was officially announced about the visit was that the 
Palestinian delegation conferred for a long time with Colonel 
Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi on developments in the occupied 
Palestinian territories following the Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre 
and the political situation in the Arab and international arenas. 
  Information obtained by Arab and Western security forces, 
which have been showing special interest in and closely watching 
the movements of the opposition Palestinian factions -- known as 
the Palestinian Alliance -- dubbed the visit one of the "very 
dangerous" activities the opposition has begun to carry out. 
This visit comes in tandem with other secret visits by 
political and security officials to "suspicious" Middle Eastern 
capitals such as Baghdad, Tehran, and Khartoum, as well as 
Tripoli. 
  These security services noted that prominent leaders of the 
Palestinian opposition have been eager to visit countries on a 
common axis; that is, countries that are internationally 
isolated and subjected to siege, countries that want to torpedo 
the peace process, countries that support international 
terrorism and religious extremism, and countries that extend 
assistance to all political and military factions and 
organizations whose objective is to obstruct and abort the peace 
negotiations. 
  In fact, the moves by these Palestinian parties toward 
countries opposed to the peace process--whether their positions 
are based on hostility to the United States and the West or a 
desire to avenge the siege to which Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Sudan 
are subjected--are not really new. 
  During the past few months, Iran has received officials from 
the Palestinian Jihad, Hamas, and the Lebanese Hizballah, and 
tried to form a military front in order to exacerbate the 
security situation in face of the peace process. Iran has also 
increased its financial support and arms supplies to these 
parties. 
  Baghdad has also contacted Palestinian opposition officials 
who were living in Iraq or who are frequent visitors of Baghdad. 
Dr. George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] has recently visited Baghdad. 
  As for Sudan, it opened its camps, run by the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard, to train fundamentalist opposition 
Palestinian group. It also increased its assistance to the 
opposition Palestinian forces in the country before al-Qadhdhafi 
openly invited Abu-Nidal [Sabri al-Banna] and Ahmad Jibril 
[secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine--General Command, PFLP--GC] to visit Tripoli. 
  A few weeks ago, Arab and Western security circles noted a 
qualitative shift in the opposition to the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, represented in a new scheme that takes into 
consideration the political and security changes that have taken 
place on the ground and the new psychological atmosphere that is 
leading toward escalation. 
  The factions of the opposition Palestinian alliance are of 
the opinion that many of the recent developments make it 
possible for them to move to the offensive, or at least prepare 
for it, instead of maintaining a wait-and-see attitude. 
  A number of developments have taken place on various fronts: 
  First: The opposition factions are of the opinion that at 
last they have managed to overcome their differences and to 
agree on a basic level of understanding for joint action. 
Available information indicates that after lengthy meetings, 
the opposition Palestinian factions have developed a unified 
political approach and emerged with agreements and joint 
political objectives. The information also indicates that the 
alliance has agreed on the following tasks: 
  A. The alliance will set up a central command that will 
specify the political objectives and orientation of the alliance 
of Palestinian forces. 
  B. The alliance will hold monthly meetings. Exceptional 
meetings will be held at the request of at least four factions. 
The chairmanship of the meetings will rotate. Decisions will 
be made by consensus. 
  C. Each faction has two representatives. A secretariat will 
be set up, made up of a representative from each faction. The 
secretariat will hold weekly meetings. It will a have permanent 
headquarters. 
  D. The tasks of the alliance on the national level: 
  --To abide by the Palestine National Charter. 
  --To adhere to the Palestinian people's inalienable 
civilian rights. 
  --To hold the Palestine question an Arab and Islamic 
issue. Liberating Palestine is the responsibility of the Arab 
and Islamic nation, especially the Palestinian people. 
  --To adhere to armed struggle and jihad as the main tool 
of struggle for the liberation of Palestine. 
  --To adhere to the unity of the Palestinian people in the 
occupied homeland and the diaspora. 
  --To hold the PLO as a national accomplishment that must 
be maintained. Its institutions must be reconstructed on 
democratic bases. 
  --To recognize that the current PLO leadership does not 
represent the Palestinian people. 
  --To begin action against the 'Arafat-Rabin recognition 
document, which amounts to national treason and which is unfit 
for the Palestinian people. 
  --To adhere to Palestine as the irreplaceable historical 
homeland of the Palestinian people and to resist all alternative 
schemes. 
  --To boycott the institutions and organizations 
responsible for implementing self-rule. 
  --To sever ties with all institutions led or joined by 
'Arafat. 
  --To firmly adhere to the escalation of armed struggle. 
  E. The tasks of the alliance on the Arab-Islamic level: 
  --To emphasize that the Palestine question is the core of 
the Arab-Zionist conflict. 
  --To ensure the responsibility of the Palestinian people 
and the Arab and Islamic masses to counter destructive 
conspiracies. 
  --To work to promote joint Arab and Islamic militant 
relations to resist the hegemony schemes. 
  --To stress the Palestinian people's right to exercise 
their militant responsibilities toward liberation, repatriation, 
and self- determination. 
  F. The tasks of the alliance on the international level: 
  --To recognize that U.S. support for the Zionist entity 
constitutes naked aggression against the Palestinian people. 
  --To bolster cooperation with Islamic, African, and Asian 
states that support the Palestinian struggle. 
  --To form alliances with all forces of liberation and 
progress in the world rejecting U.S. and imperialist hegemony 
and Zionist invasion. 
  --To make known all that pertains to the Palestine 
question and the national struggle in order to win the support 
of world public opinion. 
  Second: The opposition factions believe that it can benefit 
from the very important change that has taken place in the 
atmosphere among Palestinians in the occupied territory and in 
the diaspora. The current support for the Gaza-Jericho accord 
cannot be compared with the enthusiasm that prevailed on 13 
September. In fact, enthusiasm has turned into general 
Palestinian frustration. These factions have realized that the 
stand of the Palestinian people, following the Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre, is not even close to the stand before the massacre. 
The evidence of this is in the calls to halt the talks and in 
the lack of hope that 'Arafat will still be able to save face 
under the Israeli policy of intransigence and the bloody 
repression practiced by the occupation forces each day in which 
many Palestinians are being killed. The fact is, international 
analysts, who support the accord, believe that the peace process 
is now facing the danger of ultimate failure. They also believe 
that the peace process has become a hostage to Palestinian and 
Jewish extremists, who can repeat operations similar to the 
Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. If this happens, it will be difficult 
to save the peace agreement. Which means that the opposition 
must feel that now is the time to deal a deadly blow to the 
peace process. 
  Third: The opposition Palestinian alliance has discovered 
that it is a particularly suitable time to exploit the hostility 
and tension between the United States on one hand and the states 
that are being exposed to blockades and American and Western 
pressure, such as Iran, Iraq, Sudan, and Libya, on the other. 
It seems that these countries have lost hope in peaceful 
normalization with America and Western countries and the lifting 
of the embargoes imposed upon them. Thus, these countries are 
now ready for confrontation through supporting international 
terrorism or exerting pressure by obstructing the peace process 
and undermining, in fact, torpedoing U.S. plans. 
  Confirmed reports indicate that the opposition Palestinian 
alliance has decided to enter the feverish race of war and peace 
using all their potential and on all levels. This alliance has 
recently laid out plans to execute its objectives. These plans 
call for escalating the confrontation in Gaza and the West Bank 
and intensifying military operations against the Israeli 
occupation forces and Jewish settlers to avenge the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre and to torpedo the peace process. This 
escalation will not be confined to the occupied Palestinian 
territory, southern Lebanon will also witness an escalation and 
the national and Palestinian resistance will intensify its 
operations. 
  Information indicates that the scheme of the Palestinian 
opposition includes reorganizing the armed factions to 
reactivate fedayeen operations. These operations will include 
infiltrations into occupied Palestine and other fedayeen 
operations against the occupation forces. The scheme also 
stresses a return to operations abroad, such as striking at 
Israeli and Western institutions and hostage-taking. 
  Observers think that the fact that the agreement of the 
alliance stresses the "importance of forming alliances with all 
forces of liberation and progress worldwide that reject U.S. and 
imperialist hegemony" should be taken seriously. This is 
especially important considering the information about secret 
meetings held in Tehran between extremist Palestinian factions 
and international leftist and terrorist groups and 
organizations. Add to this reports by Western security agencies 
about the arrival of secret groups in their countries and the 
intensive coordination under way between extremist 
fundamentalist movements, particularly from Hizballah, the 
Iranian Revolutionary Guard, the Islamic Jihad and international 
terrorist groups linked to Palestinian and international 
organizations. These organizations include the Japanese Red 
Army, the Italian Red Brigades, the Armenian Secret Army, the 
Irish Republican Army, and the German Red Army. Western 
agencies found out a few days ago that these groups have held a 
secret meeting in Larnaca, Cyprus, in the presence of officials 
from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. These groups outlined a 
scheme to carry out terrorist operations worldwide. 
  Within the framework of the new scheme of the Palestinian 
opposition, AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI has learned that these 
Palestinian opposition factions have embarked on a plan to form 
an entity similar to the former "Palestine Liberation Army," 
which was deployed in several Arab states. Information 
indicates that the Alliance of Palestinian Forces is now 
assembling military cadres and elements. Each one of the 10 
factions will contribute the largest possible number of its 
elements to recruit and organize them within a new liberation 
army that will be called the "Palestinian Revolutionary Army." 
The command of this army will be based in an Arab capital and 
in Tehran. 
  Information indicates that 'Imad al-'Alami, the official in 
charge of the Hamas office in the Iranian capital, has held 
several meetings with Iranian officials at the University of 
Strategic Sciences that belongs to the Iranian Army, including 
Major General Reza Ma'iri and Lieutenant General Sayfillahi 
[name as transliterated], commander of the internal security 
forces. Al- 'Alami discussed with the Iranian officials the 
possibility of Iran supporting this military plan of the 
alliance and extending funds and weapons to it. It has been 
decided that an expanded meeting will be held in Tehran to be 
attended by Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the PFLP-GC; 
Salah Salah, representing the PFLP; Nayif Hawatimah, secretary 
general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
[DFLP], as well as other Palestinian officials from the 
Palestinian al-Biqa' region and certain camps. 
  It has been observed in some Lebanese regions, particularly 
around the al-Biqa' region, that Palestinian organizations have 
started to train cadres to form part of the Palestinian 
Revolutionary Army under the supervision of Palestinian officers 
from certain Arab and Islamic states. 
  But will the opposition Palestinian alliance succeed in its 
new move, or is this move really the creation of transient 
political and military circumstances that will vanish with the 
end of these circumstances? 
  Neutral Palestinian sources told AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI that at 
first, the Palestinian opposition's wagers seem to be logical 
and based on a realistic assessment of the situation, but it is 
shortsighted. These sources believe that the danger of the 
talks being torpedoing will exist as long as Israel, backed by 
the United States, ignores the importance of time factor in the 
negotiations, and refuses to make concessions; something which 
increases frustration among the Palestinians as well as calls 
for military escalation. These sources added: The opposition 
factions have not taken into consideration several basic 
factors. Among these factors is the fact that the failure of 
the peace process will jeopardize the entire region and not only 
the occupied territories. Based on this, there is an 
international determination to achieve peace and to prevent the 
obstruction of negotiations. This was clearly manifested in the 
positions of the other Arab negotiators following the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre. This will restrict the margin of maneuvering 
for the opposition alliance and suggests that the regional 
circumstances will change, and consequently, this will limit 
their movement. However, counting and wagering on states such 
as Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Libya is not a guarantee, especially 
since these states will seek to use the alliance, not because 
they like them or out of support for their scheme, but as a 
means to pressure America and to expedite normalization with it. 
  Before this, though, one should wait to make sure of how 
strong the opposition Palestinian alliance is. Information 
confirms that the recent agreement has come following several 
attempts by Hamas to dominate the Palestinian opposition's 
decisionmaking. This agreement is considered to be a compromise 
solution between the Hamas plan on the one hand, and the rest of 
factions on the other. It seems that the recent meetings have 
witnessed heated discussion due to Hamas' insistence on 
obtaining 40 percent of the seats of proposed executive 
committee. Differences over some side's insistence to form a 
new PLO, and some other sides' proposals to reconstruct the 
current PLO and its charter, have not yet been settled. 
Differences have begun to resurface among the factions, 
particularly between Hamas and the DFLP. It was noticed that 
each of them claim operations against Israel in different ways, 
and publish slanderous statements in the press. 
  Information received by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI indicates that 
differences within the opposition Palestinian alliance will 
erupt in the coming stage. This is in light of the information 
that Iran is currently setting a plan in accordance with which 
Hamas will dominate the alliance politically and militarily, 
taking into consideration that Hamas has opposed the idea that 
George Habash lead the alliance because he is closer the Marxist 
ideology. Information also indicates that Hamas began to act as 
if it were the alliance. It has been observed that its cadres 
and elements have begun to spread in the Palestinian camps in 
southern Lebanon and al- Biqa', and also to spread their 
fundamentalist calls to the effect that the liberation of 
Palestine can only take place through holy jihad.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Saddam Husayn marking the "liberation" </F>
of al-Faw Peninsula during the war with Iran; date and place not 
given--live or recorded] 
  [Text] Many happy returns on this al-Faw anniversary, and 
on other occasions and victories, God willing, for you, your 
people, your families. 
  This is life. It is difficult in terms of its changes and 
circumstances. It is exactly like two pictures of two meetings. 
The first was when the Iranians occupied al-Faw and the second 
is now. We might add a third meeting that came after al-Faw 
liberation. When we view life in terms of these three pictures, 
we will clearly see the meaning of the results, based on 
difficult circumstances, or the difficult changes in the 
difficult march. The history of individuals is the same. In 
their history, people may rise, fall, or succeed, based on basic 
factors, the most important of which are will and wisdom. What 
choice will his resolve and what he thinks is right lead him to? 
Which of the choices drawn in the sands, in military terms, is 
suitable or is required by the results that are based, or should 
be based on it? 
  This is the situation. Peoples and nations pass through 
periods of forgetfulness or weakness due to this forgetfulness. 
Thus, opportunities pass before them in the figurative, or 
theoretical sense, but they do not come to grips with these 
opportunities. Naturally, such a situation will not enable them 
to create opportunities. If opportunities are passing in front 
of them and they do not grab them, then it would be more 
appropriate to say that they are unable to create opportunities. 
  Other peoples, in other circumstances, for other reasons, in 
other conditions, create opportunities, come to grips with them, 
and develop them to their end results [ma'alah]. 
  This also applies to life, the life of man in times of war, 
and even during peace time. But, of course, the war times are 
more difficult. 
  Let us take the two pictures: The news received that the 
enemy had occupied al-Faw, and the picture of summoning the 
commanders and discussing al-Faw's liberation, whether in the 
bilateral meeting with the commanders of the III and VII Army 
Corps, or in the General Command meeting after the comrades had 
arrived from the north at the time -- the late General 'Adnan 
Khayrallah and his comrades. If we take these three pictures, 
or two pictures, and ask each one about his impressions of the 
first, second, and third pictures, we will be able to draw 
correct conclusions about the correct stand at difficult 
circumstances, about correct inferences in difficult times, 
about the ability to remain levelheaded at difficult times. The 
difficult circumstances are relative and they come at war time. 
They affect different individuals in different ways; there are 
degrees. We find them also at times of peace. However, they 
manifest themselves in a relative manner in what an individual 
regards as pressure on his powers and resources, his will, or 
his ability to crystallize a stand at a given time. 
  Al-Faw's lessons are numerous. In every angle, we have more 
than one lesson. We have seen in people pictures inspired in us 
by the three meetings we mentioned about al-Faw. Some said 
al-Faw was lost and would never return, but some were convinced 
that it would return. The enemies were eager to emphasize a 
factor that is not characteristic of Arabs, but was forced upon 
them, namely, that territory taken from the Arabs does not 
return, that Arab armies have no spirit for counterattack or for 
returning to attack in better circumstances to liberate 
territory. Zionism was working in this direction in all its 
activities and with all its resources and influence, not only 
inside the occupied territory in beloved Palestine but wherever 
Zionism existed in the world as well. 
  You are also aware of the skepticism, circumstances, and 
obstacles that attempted to hinder the will of the Arab combat 
troops as they launched their offensive against the occupying 
Zionist entity on the Golan and Suez fronts. Therefore, there 
is no absolute framework for what is possible and what is not 
possible. In all cases, when factors of direct impact are taken 
into account, we must consider willpower to be of paramount 
importance. 
  Let us first determine what is it that you deem possible or 
not possible. Do you just view things as possible or not 
possible? What have you done to make the impossible possible? I 
am not referring to what you should do just technically, but 
also to what you should do spiritually, mentally, and humanly in 
your relations with your own selves and with others. When we 
come into live interaction with all those factors, then the 
impossible becomes a question of relativity, either awaiting 
other factors to ripen as a result of a programmed, intentional 
action, or the emergence of other factors that are unavailable 
at that particular point of time. However, with effort and 
willpower, other factors can be made available. Then, the 
impossible can become possible. 
  When we recall the liberation of al-Faw, which is rightly 
described as the land of sacrifice and the gate of the great 
victory, then you will be able to associate every example we 
have cited with your memories of that battle: The psychological 
situation under certain circumstances, and how it turned under a 
different situation, different circumstances, and in view of 
other possibilities. 
  For the first time, an Arab territory was restored from 
foreign troops, except for the battles of liberation against the 
past traditional colonialists. Those liberation battles were 
different. But, the liberation of al-Faw was the first time in 
modern Arab history that an Arab state liberated its usurped 
territory from another state without political bargains and 
without half-way measures. 
  Was the mastermind of the al-Faw liberation deluded, as some 
said? Did you hire foreign armies? Did you hire or seek the 
assistance of foreign brains? The answer to all those questions 
is clear. 
  Hence, we can say that no army, in a long war, can claim 
that 
the opposite army, under all circumstances, is unable to achieve 
successes on certain fronts. This is because it is always 
possible for an army's superiority to be affected by other 
factors. Such factors, under certain difficult circumstances 
and perhaps lack of alertness, can revert to the interest of the 
enemy. 
  Therefore, under difficult circumstances, commanders should 
not belittle any field action, combat front, or move, no matter 
how small. This is because it is possible that these small 
moves and steps will add up to the final result. However, all 
these factors must not make the commander forget that the final 
and strategic result must be in his interest. This should be 
the basis for dealing with all details on the front. In this 
sense, the front does not have to be exclusively understood as a 
military front. It can be extended to include other domains of 
life, such as politics, economics, and social and security 
affairs. However, this applies more to the front in the 
military sense of the word. 
  What matters is the final result. Commanders may win a 
certain battle, but their final goal should be to win the war. 
  The other lesson is that it is unfair to say that Arabs are 
unable to restore their territory. They are capable of doing so 
-- mentally, emotionally, and psychologically. More aptly, this 
applies to the Iraqis, both Arabs and non-Arabs, for they have 
deep roots in the Arab nation's ancient cultural heritage and 
history. 
  The Arab nation is deep-rooted, and so are the Iraqi 
people. I don't mean deep-rooted in the sense of being ancient. 
I am speaking about virtuous traits being handed down from one 
generation to the next. It is natural that Iraq's patriotism be 
as deep as its history is long. I am not saying it is deeper 
than others' patriotism, because I am not into drawing 
comparisons here, except if others claim their patriotism is 
deeper than that of the Iraqis. To these we would say no. As 
is known, and as we always say, in human terms, each Iraqi is 
equal to any other human being. An Iraqi is equal to an Asian, 
African, European, American, or Australian. However, if anyone 
should say that an individual of his country equals two Iraqis, 
we would say no to him. For us, an Iraqi is equal to 10. If he 
should say that his country's area is greater than that of Iraq 
and so claim the right of attacking us, we would say no to him. 
Iraq is four times the size of your country, and our 20 million 
people are superior to your people. I am not talking about 
people in the abstract sense of the word, because we do not 
differentiate between peoples. What I mean to say is that 
Iraqis are above drawing such comparisons. Even if one 
belonging to a nation of 1 billion people were to boast about 
it, we would tell him that our people number that many. 
However, in view of our judging things from a principled 
standpoint, we view the human value of an Iraqi as being equal 
to that of, say, a Ugandan. One is judged better or worse by 
action and thought. 
  Iraqis and Arabs have been judged unfairly when it was said 
that once they lost territory they were unable to retrieve it. 
However, al-Faw marked the beginning -- the resounding and 
undoubted start. There was a contest of wills there; one of them 
prevailed and the result was the liberation of a city without 
politics or any outside factors coming into play. Victories 
then followed in rapid succession. The goal was to take back 
every inch of territory that had been captured by aggressors. 
Eventually all lost territory was taken back and the will of 
aggression was crushed. The aggressors admitted in a written 
message that they had been vanquished and wished they would not 
have been alive to witness that moment on the front. 
  That is how things turned out. I am not being boastful or 
arrogant. God forbid. I am saying this to underline the 
inherited positive traits of the Iraqi people -- traits that 
react to the deep-rootedness of the Arabs in spiritual and 
civilized terms. 
  In Iraqi folklore, it is said that a true horseman will not 
lose his camel. The al-Faw story is now well known to all 
Iraqis. The Iraqis experienced al-Faw when it was taken away 
from them and then when it was restored. They picture the 
commanders who joined the battle to liberate it. Some of you 
witnessed the occupation and the liberation of al-Faw. Others 
in this great army and your comrades in arms went through the 
same experience. The entire picture may not have been shown on 
television screens as clearly as you experienced it firsthand. 
A fighter may encounter circumstances in which he laughs and 
broods alternately. At times, he may be utterly depressed; at 
other times, he may feel on top of the world. These two states 
of mind may be experienced in the span of just of one hour, half 
an hour, a quarter of an hour, or even 10 or five minutes, 
marking the interval between a telephone call and another from 
the command to his position. However, the time between the 
telephone call which he viewed as upsetting and the one which he 
viewed as comforting is measured by his capacity to grasp the 
reasons why the first call was upsetting and the second 
cheering. The length of the telephone conversation should be 
measured by the extent of his determination to turn the annoying 
state into a comforting one. One cannot instill faith in others 
unless one is faithful oneself, and a commander cannot possibly 
influence his companions unless he can influence himself first. 
What I mean to say is that to the extent that one is 
self-assured, one can effect a breakthrough, achieve victory, 
bring about a good outcome, and ward off evil with sheer 
willpower. 
  Therefore, if we look at the al-Faw battle from a military 
perspective, we can learn several lessons. We can also go in 
depth into the political, social, and psychological aspects of 
this. 
  When we talk about prosperity, I note that all people want 
to 
become prosperous. History, however, does not deal with the 
manifestations of prosperity sought by weak people, but deals 
with prosperous work in a certain era. Work, in accordance with 
the Arab and Islamic concept, means jihad. They do not say how 
many discotheques were built in Baghdad at a certain time, and 
nobody says how many dresses Zubaydah, wife of Harun al-Rashid 
[caliph of Baghdad between 786-809], had. However, they all 
proudly remember how she warned Harun al-Rashid against 
al-Baramikah [an influential family which sought to overthrow 
Harun al-Rashid]. 
  The storehouses of the Muslims in the early age were not 
full 
of rice or vegetable oil, but they are still remembered with 
longing for that time. The are still remembered by all people 
-- rich and poor, full and starving. The humanity of the 
satiated is dead while the stomach of the starving is dead. The 
man with a dead stomach, however, is better than a man without 
humanity. 
  When we say that wellbeing is coming we first mean wellbeing 
of the soul. We believe that wellbeing is coming. We believe 
and know that our comrades and brothers in responsibility 
believe that wellbeing is coming. We believe and know that the 
leadership in Iraq is capable of effecting changes in the 
overall situation if the pressure increases and the situation 
becomes vulnerable. If such a thing were to happen, the 
leadership would also be capable of introducing new factors into 
the picture, factors that could absorb any additional elements 
that might be brought into play by the enemy. 
  Therefore, wellbeing is coming. Wellbeing is coming not 
because the evil ones intend to lift the evil, but because we 
know that the fist that seizes the sword by its blade will be 
forced to ease the grip when the owner of the sword pulls the 
sword forcefully. The enemies of Iraq are like a man seizing 
the sword with its blade and when the owner of the sword pulls 
the sword forcefully, the adversary will find himself compelled 
to either release his grip around the sword or risk losing his 
fingers. In either case, he will have to release the sword. 
  We created a scandal for the enemies of mankind, the likes 
of 
which have never been seen before. We exposed their lies, 
deception, and weakness. Their weakness dominates their power 
because their weakness is ethical, spiritual, and human while 
their strength is based on technology. You saw what technology 
did three days ago? Is this not technological superiority -- 
AWACS planes flying all the time, and fixed radars with two 
planes on their monitors? What did they do? Two of their 
fighter planes hit these two aircraft. You saw the premeditated 
goal. Some suspect radio stations and press statements 
immediately claimed that Iraqi fighter planes had downed the two 
U.S. helicopters. 
  It is likely that if it were not for the fact that there 
were 
other nationals besides the Americans on the planes and the fear 
that the joint inquiry would bring out the facts, they would 
have taken the media allegations as grounds to level charges 
against Iraq as they have done in the past and continue to do 
now. 
  I heard young people around me saying that they hope 
something evil will happen to the aggressors. I say to them 
that whatever you expect or imagine, you cannot concoct what 
Almighty God concocts for the evil ones and infidels. Almighty 
God has something planned that will teach a lesson to all 
mankind, not just the two parties directly involved in this 
thing. 
  After I heard about this incident, I was briefed on a 
memorandum from the Foreign Ministry. They summoned our 
ambassador there in New York. He was summoned by the three 
countries that are in charge of the so-called safehaven in the 
Autonomous Region. They summoned our ambassador and told him: 
We hope there will be no confrontation and we do not intend a 
confrontation or provocation. He asked: What is the subject of 
this meeting then? They said: We want to deploy patrols or a 
patrol from the coordination committee. But what is this 
coordination committee? It was a temporary committee formed at 
their request when their armies deployed in northern Iraq in 
order to avoid confrontation. They said: We will deploy a 
patrol on Zakho-Fa'idah highway. He asked: What is the purpose 
of this patrol? What was in the two planes? Who were inside 
the two planes? What are they going to do? 
  When I read the cable, I then reviewed the incident, and I 
noted that they summoned the ambassador on 14 April and the two 
planes were downed on 14 April. Therefore, the ambassadors 
summoned our ambassador pursuant to the instructions of their 
governments to time an evil act or behavior which we will find 
out. What is the relationship of this with those who were on 
board the planes? 
  These are their practices. They carry out small actions, but 
Iraq is greater than these practices. They still do not 
understand what Iraq is because they understand the language of 
figures. They know how many tanks, planes, and fighters are 
left in Iraq, and how Iraq's economy is doing. 
  In 1968, Iraq's treasury was almost empty, and there was 
extreme poverty, but there was a deep-rooted army with a 
deep-rooted history. But, when we came to power in 1968, this 
army was small and consisted of only five divisions. How many 
division did we have after the Iran-Iraq war ended in a great 
victory? We had 87 divisions. It is man's will that builds 
divisions and operates the economy. Had not we the same oil 
which we have now? Yes, but the Iraqis were then starving. We 
hear now that some Iraqis speak about lacking certain items, but 
I say that the conditions of 90 percent of the Iraqis now under 
the siege is much better than their previous conditions, which 
they talk of now, except for meat and some vegetables. 
  Most of those who are talking the most, particularly those 
who became weak in face of the will of foreigners, are the ones 
who made a fortune in those extraordinary 
circumstances--circumstances of siege and war after the 
revolution of 1968. These people are not doing so under the 
revolution's protection. However, we see that these people, 
whose number is not large, are impatient. What is needed is 
that their neighbors should ask them to be patient as much as 
they have reaped profits. They should remind them of the 
damaged furniture they had when they moved from their previous 
place and settled near them. They should remind them of the 
good furniture they have now. They should urge them to be 
patient and to have a good solid attitude, much same as the 
furniture they have in their houses. They should remember their 
poverty and be patient, and remember that the revolution was 
what brought them the lifestyle they have enjoyed. These people 
are few, and it is our responsibility to advise them because we 
want them good, we do not hate anyone and we should not hate 
anyone. We should feel sympathy even for the ones who are 
executed under the law. This does not mean that we should 
pardon them to continue their evil deeds, but it means that if 
this Iraqi citizen been good, it would have been better for us, 
for his country, and his people. 
  Their neighbors should talk to these few people and urge 
them to be patient. I am saying that the ones who have endured 
the most are those who have a limited income; namely, the 
genuine citizens of Baghdad. I am commending them because they 
deserve to be commended. But the ones who came from outside 
Baghdad and became wealthy after they had been poor will have 
little patience. On the contrary, we see that the patience of a 
genuine citizen of Baghdad -- who lives adjacent to these people 
and who used to cook meat four times a week--is greater than 
that of some of these formerly poor men, who may have once been 
so poor that they only ate meat when their father died. 
Sometimes, these formerly poor men could only afford to recite 
the opening verses of the Koran when their father died if their 
neighbors helped them. 
  This is not a shame. A shame, however, is when the formerly 
poor man does not recall this, thus losing his national memory. 
This is because such a man will lose his ethics if he does not 
realize that he is duty-bound to recall the past, so that he can 
talk to his children and teach them. The children of those whom 
I am taking about now regard themselves as if they were the 
children of al- Jalabi [a famous wealthy Iraqi]. Thus, they 
grumble, do not like anything, do not eat simple meals, and are 
not ready to put on simple clothes. Therefore, they need tough 
advice. You should laud both the genuine citizens of Baghdad 
and their position because their situation is very hard. I know 
these people. Their position, however, is more pure and genuine 
than that of all the people who came to Baghdad from other 
governorates. 
  Did you see the woman from al-Kazimiyah on television 
recently? She said she has three sons who fought in the 
Iran-Iraq war. Did you notice that she proudly talked about her 
sons' history? Did you notice how she is living with her old 
husband in a small house, with an area of 75 square meters, 
along with two married sons, their children, and her third son? 
Did you notice that her words stemmed from conviction, and how 
they made eight soaps out of one soap after adding some sugar 
and water, and that they all eat from the same cooking pot, and 
how they are living. She talked in a way that suggested honesty 
and sincerity to the viewer. The viewer felt that this woman 
was telling the truth. She invited a television photographer, 
who was on her way to work, to drink tea in her home, and that 
is why she talked to you on television. 
  God willing, after a decisive and final victory is 
achieved--and victory is being achieved now, God willing--these 
ones will take pride in every detail of their position. We do 
not want to deprive any Iraqi of proudly recalling his 
circumstances under the blockade and explaining them to his 
children and later to his grandchildren. Do you not recall 
al-Faw in 1986? That's alright. Do you not recall al-Faw in 
1988? Are they not two contradictory pictures? We are now 
inheriting all the glories and positions of the martyrs of 
al-Faw in 1986 and 1988 and with the same pride. Did you not 
feel agonized when you recall our martyrs in al-Faw? Here, I am 
saying that agony still exists in its principled, spiritual, and 
humanitarian sense. In other words, we wish we had not shed a 
single drop of Iraqi blood. This, however, is a law which is as 
old as the times of Adam. This law means that anything of value 
requires a corresponding sacrifice. However, when we recall the 
martyrs now we also recall all the noble meanings of liberation. 
All our martyrs contributed to liberation, whether those who 
fell in 1986 or 1988. May God have much mercy on them, God 
willing. We also take pride in the martyrs' families and in 
their positions. We thank the state, the homeland, and the 
enduring families of martyrs. May God salute the men, the 
martyrs, your army, your families, and you.

  [Excerpt] Baghdad, 21 Apr (INA) -- Deputy Prime Minister 
Tariq 'Aziz has said human rights are being abused by certain 
governments for political purposes to further their own 
interests. 
  'Aziz's remarks were made at the third session of the 
Baghdad 
International Symposium on human and women's rights and ways to 
cope with challenges. He said the sanctions targeting the 
women, children, and the elderly of Iraq amount to a gross 
violation of human rights. The sanctions, he pointed out, were 
passed as a political decision by George Bush under known 
circumstances, and under U.S. control of the United Nations and 
the UN Security Council. 
  'Aziz reviewed the advances Iraq made in the seventies in 
the 
areas of education, health, and social welfare for women and 
children. He emphasized that these advances can be supported by 
statistics and international agencies and were achieved despite 
the iniquitous embargo that has covered all aspects of life. 
  The deputy prime minister called for a rethink of the 
sanctions resolutions that deprive an entire people of food and 
medicine and restrict international trade. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic </F>
Union of Kurdistan, by George Nawfal in Paris on 21 
April--recorded] 
  [Text] [Nawfal] The first question is on your intensive 
talks in France with French officials. Have you come out with 
encouraging results? 
  [Talabani] My meetings with French officials have been 
successful, fruitful, and encouraging. We met with Defense 
Minister Francois Leotard and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and 
discussed with them issued of interest to Iraq and Iraqi 
Kurdistan. The results in my view were very positive. 
  [Nawfal] Have you won practical support? 
  [Talabani] Yes, we realized definite and clear things. For 
instance, Leotard emphasized France's continuing contribution to 
the forces that are protecting the people of Iraqi Kurdistan and 
pledged to continue offering humanitarian, economic aid to the 
Iraqi Kurdistan region. 
  As for Alain Juppe, he emphasized to us France's clear and 
firm policy toward the Kurdish people and the need to give them 
their political and democratic rights within unified Iraq. As 
you are aware, France, like us in the Iraqi Kurdistan Front, 
opposes partitioning Iraq but emphasizes the need for the Kurds 
to enjoy the broadest form possible of self rule for the Kurdish 
people within Iraq. Juppe assured us that France wants Iraq to 
fully abide by all UN Security Council resolutions, especially 
Resolution 688 concerning the Kurdish people's rights, and that 
France will not lift the economic sanction on Iraq unless Iraq 
abides by all international resolutions and unless it agrees to 
allow the Kurdish people to enjoy their legitimate rights within 
a unified Iraq. 
  [Nawfal] We would like to ask you about conditions in Iraqi 
Kurdistan. 
  [Talabani] Conditions in Iraqi Kurdistan are developing and 
improving despite the difficult economic and social problems. 
Despite the presence of 300,000 displaced Kurds from the Karkuk 
area, to which the Iraqi Government refused to allow them to 
return, and despite the presence of tens of thousands of victims 
of the notorious arrest campaign, economic conditions are 
improving because the Kurdish peasants returned to their 
villages and began to rebuild them. The crops will be good this 
year, God willing. The Kurdish people have begun to plant and 
produce. The democratically elected Kurdish administration have 
started to electrify hospitals, schools, and other services. 
Our special security organizations are developing. For 
instance, the sabotage network sent by the Iraqi government to 
assassinate foreign nationals recently has been busted. 
Therefore, several sabotage and assassination networks, which 
the Iraqi government supported with arms and money, have been 
wiped out. 
  [Nawfal] But how can you manage? Are you in control from the 
security viewpoint, despite all the recent events? 
  [Talabani] We are in better control that others. 
  [Nawfal] What do you mean by others? 
  [Talabani] I mean our neighbors, for instance. Compare our 
conditions with Tehran, where they have explosions and booby 
trapped cars every day. With Baghdad, or southern Iraq, where 
they have daily explosions. Of course, I mean that we should 
not be compared with Afghanistan and Somalia. We are very much 
superior in this regard. I mean that even compared to our 
neighbors, the security conditions are improving in Iraqi 
Kurdistan. I do not claim that they are ideal, but I am aware 
of the meaning of the phrase Improving conditions. We hope this 
improvement will increase in the future. But as you know, we in 
the east, even in the European countries, we cannot prevent 
crimes and assassinations and explosions completely. But in 
Iraqi Kurdistan we realized great successes in foiling many 
bombings attempts and the killing of innocent people. 
  [Nawfal] In northern Iraq, you are playing host to 
non-Kurdish Iraqi opposition groups. How do you deal with them? 
  [Talabani] Yes, sir, we in Iraqi Kurdistan have an open, 
democratic society and we are proud of realizing a model 
democracy. Everybody enjoys democratic freedoms--the freedom of 
party work, of the media, and of politics. Because Iraqi 
Kurdistan is part of the Iraqi state, other Iraqi 
brothers--Arabs, Turkomans, and other Iraqi citizens--have the 
right to come to Iraqi Kurdistan and work there. For instance, 
in Iraqi Kurdistan there is the headquarters of the unified 
Iraqi National Congress [INC], which includes many important 
groups of the Iraqi opposition and which is continuing unrest 
for the democratic alternative in Iraq. Our shiite brothers and 
other parties, even the parties that do not belong to the INC, 
have the right to work. We have invited our brothers in the 
Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, the dissident Iraqi regional 
leadership, and the Islamic al-Da'wah Party, who are outside the 
INC to come to Kurdistan and work there. 
  I even would like to give you an exclusive news item. Sharif 
'Ali, who is claiming the throne of Iraq, sent me a letter, 
sometime back, asking to be allowed to open an office in 
Kurdistan. We have agreed to and welcomed this request. We 
would like the Iraqi Movement for Constitutional Monarchy 
[al-harakah al-malakiyah al- dusturiyah fi al-'iraq] to have the 
right to pursue democratic activity in accordance with the 
Koranic verse: So announce the good news to my servants, those 
who listen to the word and follow the best of it. 
  [Nawfal] Thank you for this revelation. Many reports speak 
of contacts between Baghdad and Kurdish groups to hold 
agreements with Baghdad. We do not know how true they are. 
What is your opinion? How true are they? 
  [Talabani] These reports are completely baseless because the 
Iraqi Government does not think seriously of establishing a 
dialogue with the Kurds and the Kurds do not want this. 
  [Nawfal] I mean a group of Kurds, not all of them. 
  [Talabani] These reports are not true. Today I was asked by 
Juppe and I answered ... [pauses] when we emerged together, a 
Turkish reporter asked our opinion of the Turkish attempt to 
mediate between the Kurdish leadership and the Iraqi Government 
because Mr. Sanberk, the Turkish Foreign Ministry under 
secretary, stated upon his return from Baghdad that he proposed 
this to the Iraqi officials who expressed a desire to have a 
dialogue with the Kurds to solve this problem. My answer was 
that Resolution 688 is the correct basis because this resolution 
includes the need for Iraq to abide by the rights, democratic 
freedoms, and human rights for all Iraqi citizens, including the 
Kurds, and asks the Iraqi Government to negotiate and hold a 
dialogue with Iraqi citizens to realize these rights. If the 
Iraqi Government is serious, it must implement this resolution, 
and hold a dialogue with the Iraqi people, including the Kurds, 
to resolve the issues in a peaceful political manner. 
  [Nawfal] Thank you, Mr. Jalal Talabani. 
  [Talabani] Thank you, brother.

  [Text] Baghdad, 22 Apr (INA)--The newspaper AL-THAWRAH has 
urged Arab and friendly countries to be the first ones to break 
the blockade and contribute to its fragmentation in honor of 
their relationship with Iraq and in harmony with the legitimate 
humanitarian aspiration for a world free of problems. 
  In an article today entitled "The New Iraqi Move...the 
Timing 
and the Response," the paper says: A policy of isolation, 
oppression, and inflicting harm does not befit the relations 
that should prevail among states. Peace and justice alone befit 
good neighborliness, understanding, the exchange of legitimate 
interests, and an open ear to all viewpoints without exception. 
  The paper adds: The new Iraqi move stems from clear 
realities 
whose starting point is the fact that Iraq has fulfilled its 
commitments and its political and procedural pledges regarding 
the Security Council resolutions. This was documented in the 
recent Security Council deliberations. The paper explains that 
while reminding the Arab brethren and foreign friends of the 
division in the Security Council, Iraq is looking forward to the 
political conduct that the United Nations should adopt in 
harmony with its goals stipulated in the second article of the 
UN Charter and also in harmony with the world declaration on 
human rights, especially since this blockade has inflicted grave 
damage on the Iraqi people. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds that the blockade has caused many tragedies 
and a great deal of grief for the Iraqi people, which can under 
no circumstances be acceptable and which can only be interpreted 
as seeking to inflict deliberate harm. The paper emphasizes 
that the blockade has inflicted grave damage on the Iraqi 
people, and that international will should rise against this 
situation if it actually respects its own credibility and if it 
really honors the principles of justice and fairness it is 
seeking. Otherwise, remaining silent on what happened will only 
be regarded as encroachment on this credibility and a flagrant 
violation of these principles. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: We can fairly say that there 
has been a measure of Arab and world response to the new Iraqi 
move. The statements made by Arab and foreign leaders after 
their meetings with President Saddam Husayn's envoys expressed 
real understanding of Iraq's proposals, and are a positive sign 
to be added to many positive signs in the international arena. 
These signs indicate that the end to the blockade must come 
soon.

  [Text] Baghdad, 21 Apr (INA)--The newspaper AL-QADISIYAH 
has said that the downing of two U.S. helicopters by U.S. 
aircraft over northern Iraq has revealed the broad rejection of 
the U.S. policies of hegemony, violence, and aggression. 
  In an article today entitled "The Downing of the U.S. 
Helicopters Is First Drops of Rain," the paper adds: Numerous 
facts will certainly be revealed about similar U.S. crimes which 
used to be kept secret or forgotten, now that, after the downing 
of the two U.S. helicopters, the White House can no longer 
conceal these cheap and lowly adventures after they have been 
exposed to the whole world. 
  AL-QADISIYAH adds: Such mistakes will continue to be made 
without any justification apart from the U.S. grudge against 
peoples and the desire to control and dominate them. No wonder, 
therefore, that this topic has drawn the attention of the world 
media. The paper continues: Everyone is aware of the tragedies 
of wars and military interventions led by the United States in 
the world. Everyone recalls, in particular, the U.S. crimes in 
Vietnam, Panama, Nicaragua, Korea, and Iraq as well as the 
distress caused to both the American people and the world as a 
result of the reckless U.S. policy. 
  The paper wonders how the American people feel regarding the 
many U.S. soldiers who died in the U.S. wars, and who are left 
with only memories. The paper concludes that history will 
uncover the folded pages even if they are concealed by the dust 
of years or the smoke of intelligence services and those 
revolving in their orbit.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "In Message From Yemeni Foreign </F>
Ministry to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Sanaa Denies Bias Against 
Socialist Party Diplomats"] 
  [Excerpt] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Yemeni Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah has denied a reshuffle of 
staff -- in particular southern Yemeni diplomats and those who 
have close links with the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. 
  He expressed his regret that "some people should exploit the 
crisis Yemen is experiencing to distort facts and level false 
accusations at others." 
  In a statement AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT received from a Yemeni 
Foreign Ministry official, Basindwah said that "with regard to 
the ministry's delay in sending financial allowances to the 
embassies, this delay is not limited to certain embassies. It 
affects all embassies." 
  This came as a reply to accusations made by some Yemeni 
sources regarding a diplomatic reshuffle aimed at recalling to 
Yemen YSP diplomats or those close to the YSP, and the Foreign 
Ministry's deliberate delay in sending financial allowances to 
the embassies where they work. 
  The foreign minister attributed the delay in sending these 
allowances to "the Central Bank's inability to secure the sums 
decided in hard currency on the specified dates." [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Ma'an Mukhawwal: "Why the Fundamentalist </F>
Movement is Weak in Morocco"] 
  [Text] The bloody events in Algeria have added other things 
to Morocco's concerns, such as the possible spread of the 
conflict to this country. Morocco's official stance has ranged 
from caution to semi-silence, avoiding any involvement in the 
conflict. This is in contrast to the stances of the Moroccan 
political parties. Some of these parties, such as the 
Independence Party, support the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] 
while others, such as the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, 
support the Algerian Government. 
  Undoubtedly, the fundamentalist movement began to grow in a 
serious manner in the sixties and mid-seventies. This does not 
mean that the Moroccan parties did not contain Islamic factions. 
On the contrary, these Islamic factions were able to make their 
words heard within their own parties, such as the faction of 
Shaykh Mohamed Ben-al-'Arabi al-'Alawi in the National Union of 
Popular Forces and the faction of Habib Farkani in the Socialist 
Union of Popular Forces. 
  The religious issue spawned by the growth of the 
fundamentalist movement is influenced by a number of pressing 
factors that come from the very core of society. These factors 
have diminished the political Islamic groups' ability for 
movement, maneuvering, preaching, and guidance. Although 
Morocco, like other Islamic and Arab states, is experiencing a 
conflict between two kinds of logic that barely coexist--the 
logic of the state and the logic of the Islamic call--it has 
sought from the outset to use the call to serve the state. It 
has not done this in a crude way but has made the call one of 
the factors for building the state. 
  The state opened a number of channels through which it 
sought 
to control the call's course by controlling the scholars, who 
were the main activists. It supervised their work, guided them, 
and put them under surveillance. The state established the "Dar 
al-Hadith al- Hasaniyah" in 1964 and entrusted it with taking 
care of higher Islamic studies, which specialize in the science 
of the Koran and Sunna [body of Islamic custom and practice 
based on Prophet Muhammad's words and deeds]. The political 
authority's success in containing the call and controlling its 
work has enabled it to undermine competing and undesirable 
channels. The Scholars Authority was merged into the civil 
service. If the Friday preachers violated the directives of the 
Ministry of Awqaf, the latter would prevent them and even 
dismiss them if necessary. The scholars' role was confined to 
protecting the unity of the nation on the level of religion and 
creed. 
  King Hassan II said: I am afraid for Islam from the Muslims. 
He adds: There is no exaggeration, no excessiveness, and no 
bigotry in religion. No one is a custodian of others. No one 
must dictate to others behavior, ethics, and daily activities of 
society. 
  In the seventies Morocco witnessed extremist leftist 
currents 
that tried the course of political violence but failed. In the 
eighties Islamic extremist groups such as "Fasil al-Jihad" and 
"Katibat Badr" tried to adopt a strategy of violence to bring 
about political change. The security authorities, however, 
succeeded in dismantling them and convicting their members in 
1984 and 1985. Not only did fundamentalism in Morocco fail in 
its armed violence but the call also did not receive an 
attentive ear for several reasons: 
  1. The longevity of the monarchy in Morocco, which dates to 
the eighth century when Idris Bin-'Abdallah sought refuge in 
Morocco after his escape from a massacre during the 'Abbasid 
era. The Aurbah tribe gave him refuge, honored him, and 
established ties of marriage with him. This tribe and others 
chose him as king and recognized his only son, Idris II, as his 
successor. 
  In 1809 [as published] Idris II founded Fes and made it his 
capital. With time, and thanks to the efforts of the 'Alawite 
kings, it became one of the most important centers of Islam. It 
is no coincidence that the monarchy in Morocco is popular and 
Islamic. If it were not for the congruity between monarchy and 
Islam, we would not be able to speak about a Moroccan nation 
that has its prerequisites and unity. King Hassan has 
maintained harmony among the people and has achieved and upheld 
the country's unity despite the existence of multiple tribes and 
divergent views. The state's sole authority controlled the 
remote areas and the interior of the country in a secure, 
legislative, and economic unity encompassing shepherds, farmers, 
merchants, and sailors. 
  2. The Salafiyah [early 20th century movement led by 
reformers wishing to reconcile Muslim traditions with modern 
life and justify Muslim tenets through rational arguments] is 
the backdrop of the Moroccan nationalist movement. Since it 
took shape in the early thirties, the nationalist movement in 
Morocco leaned heavily on Islam in its fight against the 
protectorate [French] authorities. Thanks to its great pioneer, 
Alal el-Fassi, the national movement maintained a healthy 
Islamic attitude, dismissing dogmatic ideas, and denouncing 
misguided practices. 
  The Salafiyah played an important role in the resistance 
against protectorate powers. The national movement did all it 
could to join forces with other groups involved in resisting the 
occupation, including mystic schools and Sufi [Muslim esoteric 
societies usually featuring a guru, initiation rites, and claims 
of psychic powers] movements. All differences were set aside in 
the common cause of achieving reform and liberation. 
  Thus, all the above-mentioned groups joined in one movement 
whose aim was Moroccan nationalism: liberation and independence. 
Mystic traditions blended with the desire for reform, creating 
a sense of flexibility and a clarity of goal that greatly suited 
the simple tenets of Moroccan Sufism. 
  3. The civic code. A collection of laws regulating family 
relations was passed under the aegis of political authorities 
wishing to combine Islamic tenets, traditions, and the teachings 
of Imam Malik [early Muslim legislator] in one body of laws. A 
committee of ulema, judges, and legal experts were put to work 
and finally produced a civic code reminiscent of that of 
Tunisia. In many instances, the code recognizes equality 
between men and women. 
  Despite widespread liberalism in Morocco, there is a certain 
balance between liberalism and Islamic values. Social freedoms 
steer clear of Muslim sensibilities. The port city of Sale, for 
instance, boasts many sidewalk cafes, busy with customers 
whiling away the time in the winter sun, but not one liquor shop. 
  Morocco may be a Third World country that needs assistance, 
but neither its government nor its people are destitute. Its 
agricultural reform plan was a dazzling success. Morocco has 
met its international financial obligations, reinforcing 
confidence in its future. 
  Morocco does not only enjoy political and economic 
stability, 
it also has political parties with a Salafi penchant. These 
parties are always trying to win over the Islamic tide. These 
efforts have robbed the fundamentalists of much of their lure 
and have diminished their political appeal. 
  The fundamentalists have no grassroots support among the 
working classes or any presence to speak of in the countryside. 
Their activists work exclusively in big cities and among 
students. 
  The Moroccans are open minded and moderate by nature. They 
see no contradiction between going to the mosque and adopting 
modern ways. The Moroccan family acts as a safety valve, for it 
greatly influences the cultural and professional lives of its 
members. Family bonds are stronger than political ones in that 
country. 
  For all the above reasons, Moroccan fundamentalism has been 
unable to "strike back" and claim an exclusive mandate in 
matters of faith. Its field of action is confined to things 
political, which puts it in direct competition with other 
parties. Its appeal is ineffective and its record unimpressive. 
For lack of a better cause, Shaykh Abdessalam Yassine, a top 
fundamentalist preacher, advocates a brand of Sufism "that 
cannot be learned by study and earnest reading" or be found 
between the covers of a book. 
  Morocco is a country with challenges on its mind. Shaykh 
Yassine's other-worldly appeal is no help in facing these 
challenges.

  [Text] Lieutenant General 'Umar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir, the 
president of the Republic, has received a personal message from 
Iraqi President Saddam Husayn concerning developments in the UN 
Security Council on the question of lifting the unjust blockade 
imposed on Iraq. 
  This was announced by Iraqi Information Minister Yusuf 
Hammadi, who delivered the message to Lt. Gen. 'Umar al-Bashir, 
at a news conference held this evening at the Hilton Hotel. 
  The Iraqi minister, who is currently visiting the country, 
added that he discussed with Lt. Gen. al-Bashir the possibility 
of cooperation between the friendly and brotherly states to 
achieve the lifting of the blockade. Mr. Hammadi commended 
Sudan's stand of solidarity with Iraq. He pointed out that Lt. 
Gen. al-Bashir had assured him that the unjust blockade was not 
aimed at Iraq only, but at the growth of Arab strength and its 
confrontation with colonialists. It also aimed to exhaust the 
resources of the Arab nation. 
  Mr. Hammadi added that his meeting with Lt. Gen. al-Bashir 
dealt with ways of strengthening brotherly relations between the 
two countries. 
  Concerning the UN Security Council's position on lifting the 
blockade imposed on Iraq, Mr. Hammadi explained that the stand 
adopted by the UN Security Council differed from what it had 
held in the past, and that this was because a split had occurred 
in the viewpoints of the permanent member states. France, 
Russia, and China were in favor of lifting the blockade against 
Iraq, whereas United States and Britain were not. On Gulf-Iraqi 
relations, Mr. Hammadi affirmed a positive trend in his 
country's relations with Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.

<F P=106> [Report by Silvia Aloisi: "Al-Qadhdhafi's Secret Weapon" -- </F>
all Libyan place names as published] 
  [Text] Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's deadly secret is hidden in 
the sandy desert, at Tarhunah, 65 kilometers southeast of 
Tripoli. It is here that the Libyan leader is having an 
enormous installation built for the production of chemical 
weapons, thus complementing the existing production plant at 
Rabta. 
  For years the U.S. secret service had suspected al-Qadhdhafi 
of planning to build a second chemical plant. Rabta 
technological center's Pharma-150 plant was detected by the 
Pentagon in 1988, thanks to photographs taken by the Keyhole 
satellite. It was immediately defined as "the greatest chemical 
weapon production plant in the Third World. It was pointless 
for Tripoli's colonel to deny the facts and say th at the plant 
was only a harmless "pharmaceuticals factory." First Ronald 
Reagan and later George Bush repeatedly threatened to bomb the 
plant unless al-Qadhdhafi agreed to an international inspection. 
The use of force, however, proved unnecessary, since in March 
1990 the Rabta plant was half- destroyed by a mysterious fire, 
which the Libyan authorities attributed to Western-instigated 
sabotage. 
  The Tripoli government has not forgotten American threats 
nor, above all, the allied bombing of Iraqi military 
installations during the Gulf War and, subsequently, in 1993. 
Al-Qadhdhafi's decision to have the suspect plant and materials 
transported to a new secret site was therefore predictable. 
This, in fact, would enable him to open the doors of the 
entirely rebuilt Rabta plant to UN inspectors, as a sign of 
goodwill toward the West. 
  The construction of the new Tarhunah plant was entrusted to 
the Jowfe state-owned enterprise, a bogus company which was set 
up to purchase the necessary equipment for building the plant 
and manufacturing poison gas. The plant, which is scheduled to 
become operational by 1995, will be capable of producing mustard 
gas at the rate of 1,000 metric tons a year, Sarin gas (90 
metric tons), and Soman gas (1,300 metric tons). All of these 
substances are highly toxic to human beings: A small drop is 
enough to kill an individual within a few minutes. 
  Suspicions concerning Tripoli's intentions were aroused by 
the discovery, in England, of a Jowfe purchase order for two 
chemical production installations. The contract, worth half a 
million pounds sterling (approximately 1.2 billion lire), had 
been awarded to the Multinational Engineering Group company, 
which is part of the British APV company. The deal was 
camouflaged by means of a three-way operation: Jowfe contacted 
APV's Malaysian subsidiary APV Hills and Hills, which passed on 
the order to its parent company in London. In addition to the 
equipment, the order included materials for gas production and, 
in particular, pinacolone alcohol, the basic component for the 
production of Soman nerve gas. 
  Other toxic substances were supplied to Jowfe by the Belgian 
company Hassco, based in Ostend. Among them, ethylene oxide, 
used for manufacturing mustard gas and incendiary bombs, and 
dimethylamine, a component of Tabun nerve gas. It is difficult, 
however, to draw up precise accusations since many toxic 
products used for chemical weapons are commonly used as 
fertilizers or pesticides, and are therefore not included in the 
international list of "risk" substances whose export is 
forbidden. Ethylene oxide, for example, is used for the 
production of industrial resins and detergents. 
  However, the nature of the Tarhunah plant, which is 
officially presented as a petrochemical complex, also seems to 
be confirmed by the type of materials bought for its 
construction. Libya is currently subjected to an international 
embargo because of its involvement in the 1988 terrorist action 
against a Pan Am Boeing 747 over Lockerbie. Tripoli is refusing 
to extradite the two Libyan agents who are suspected of having 
planted the bomb in the airliner. However, getting round the UN 
embargo was easy: In fact, the Jowfe company obtained -- from 
Switzerland -- the technical specifications for the construction 
of parallel underground tunnels, 150 meters long, designed by 
the Sauer engineering company of Salzburg (Austria). This type 
of tunnel is commonly used in other secret military 
installations. Furthermore, Libya purchased chemical weapon 
production equipment whose internal components are covered with 
enamel or teflon -- materials that are extremely resistant to 
corrosive toxic substances. A sophisticated Swiss 
air-purification plant -- protected by special fire-resistant 
materials -- and a computerized system enabling instruments to 
function automatically are considered further evidence for the 
military intended use of the Tarhunah complex. 
  Libya did not subscribe to the international convention 
against the proliferation of chemical weapons, which was signed 
in Paris in January 1993, and it has always refused to have its 
chemical installations open to international inspection. The 
Tripoli government supports the position taken by the majority 
of Arab League countries, which make their possible adhesion to 
the convention conditional upon international inspection of 
Israel's secret nuclear installations. In fact, chemical 
weapons are considered the Arab countries' response to the 
Jewish state's nuclear potential. 
  The discovery of the Tarhunah plant may trigger off a new 
crisis between Tripoli's colonel and the West. The Libyan 
Government is already facing trouble on its internal front, 
following the violent anti-regime revolt which broke out last 
March in the small town of Bani Walid -- although al-Qadhdhafi's 
personal power does not seem to be seriously called into 
question. The colonel survived the administrations of his 
long-standing enemies, Reagan and Bush. But Bill Clinton may 
well decide that the moment has come to resume the hostilities.

<F P=106> [Report on joint news conference by Foreign Minister Shim'on </F>
Peres and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Bucharest on 21 April -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] A joint news conference by Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat ended in Bucharest a short 
while ago. The two summed up with satisfaction 24 hours of 
intensive discussions. The following is an excerpt of the news 
conference: 
  [Begin recording] ['Arafat, in English] We are all doing 
our best to find a solution for this conflict. I don't want to 
say conflict, no, but it's a conflict between brothers. I am 
sure of that, especially with his excellency, Mr. Peres, with 
his goodwill, we can push forward the peace process. 
  [Peres] So I think the unhappiness of Yugoslavia is 
different from the unhappiness in the Middle East, and 
furthermore, in Yugoslavia you have an aggressor and you have a 
victim. In the case of the Middle East you have two negotiators 
who are trying to put an end to the conflict. [end recording]

  [Text] In their talks in Bucharest today Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres and PLO leader, Yasir 'Arafat, agreed to establish 
and man three committees which will operate during the overlap 
period between the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal and 
the establishment of autonomy: a committee on routine security, 
a committee on joint patrols, and a committee on the transfer of 
administration powers. 
  Our correspondent Gid'on Kouts reports that Peres and 
'Arafat 
will meet again in an hour for the fourth time. They will then 
decide whether they will meet in Cairo next weekend. The two 
sides apparently set the first week of May as a target date for 
the signing of the agreement. 
  In a speech before the economic forum in Bucharest Minister 
Peres said that the peace process is irreversible. In his 
speech, 'Arafat condemned acts of violence by both sides, saying 
the PLO is committed to democracy and a market economy. He 
again warned that if an agreement is not achieved, balkanization 
of the Middle East is expected. 
  An agreement was achieved in the Paris economic talks 
between 
Israel and the PLO on free tourism traffic between Israel and 
the autonomy. At the same time, our correspondent Yo'av Tocker 
notes that the dispute on customs issues remains.

  [Text] Cairo, 21 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the head of 
the Palestinian delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations designed to implement self-rule in Gaza and 
Jericho, has stated that considerable progress has been made in 
the past two days despite the difficulties encountered at the 
beginning of this round of talks. At a news conference today, he 
said that the next round of talks will begin on Sunday, voicing 
his hope that it will be the "last." 
  Sha'th pointed out that the Security Committee settled 
satisfactorily all pending issues, such as water, regional 
planning, and the electromagnetic field. 
  Regarding the agreement on the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho accord, Sha'th said that only five paragraphs 
remain to be worked out. He noted that this agreement, which is 
considered the key to the detailed agreements, has 24 clauses. 
He said that both the Palestinian and Israeli parties have come 
close to reaching an agreement on the legal jurisdictions that 
meet the Palestinian needs and the contents of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  Dr. Sha'th noted that there are still issues pending on the 
release of Palestinian detainees, noting that there is an 
agreement to release 5,000 detainees. He said that the 
Palestinian delegation will continue negotiations on a timetable 
for the release of the rest of the detainees. 
  Dr. Sha'th stressed that the meeting between Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres in Bucharest today has helped push the negotiations 
forward, noting that he telephoned 'Arafat this morning on this 
issue. He pointed out that the talks he held with the head of 
the Israeli delegation, General Amnon Shahaq, yesterday after 
his return from Israel helped propel the negotiations. He 
expressed hope that PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 
'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, will come to Cairo to be close to the 
negotiations. MENA has learned that Abu-Mazin and Peres will 
arrive in Cairo next week to attend the next round of talks, 
which is likely to be the last. 
  Dr. Sha'th stated that an agreement was reached in principle 
with the Israeli delegation that the first Palestinian flight 
route will be between Gaza and Cairo, noting that an 
international airport will be established in Gaza soon. 
  Dr. Sha'th said he expected the agreement on implementing 
the 
self-rule powers in Gaza and Jericho will be signed in Cairo 
between 2 and 5 May. He noted that 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin 
will arrive in Cairo in the next two days. On the first day 
they will negotiate over the remaining issues, including the 
size of the Jericho area, and will sign the agreement on the 
next day. He stressed that the main issues will not be 
postponed until after the agreement is signed but certain 
secondary and detailed issues will be left until after the 
signing.

  [Text] Cairo, 21 Apr (MENA)--General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli 
deputy chief of staff and head of the Israeli delegation to the 
peace talks, has said that the Palestinian-Israeli round of 
talks that concluded in Cairo today was "positive and fruitful." 
He said that the two sides have come very close to reaching an 
agreement on implementing self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. At a 
news conference today before his departure from Cairo, Shahaq 
said that during this round an agreement was reached on several 
issues but that certain issues have not yet been settled. He 
voiced his hope that next week will be the end of the talks on 
implementing the Palestinian self-rule. He refused to set a 
date for signing the agreement on self-rule, but noted that the 
time is not far away. 
  Gen. Shahaq said that the Civilian Affairs Committee has 
nearly finished numerous issues submitted to it, such as water 
and communications. He noted that certain issues have not yet 
been settled, such as stamps and telephone codes. He pointed 
out that the Security Committee settled a working paper related 
to the Palestinian police, but certain issues remain to be 
worked out. Regarding the Legal Affairs Committee, he voiced his 
hope that progress will be achieved in the work of this 
committee next week. 
  Gen. Shahaq stated that an agreement was reached on the 
legal 
jurisdictions, but he declined to define the points of the 
agreement, noting that certain topics will be postponed to be 
discussed by higher echelons. He noted that the Palestinian and 
Israeli delegations are waiting for the resolutions of the 
Economic Affairs Committee currently meeting in Paris, which has 
not yet finished its work. He said that the resolutions that 
will be reached in Paris will be annexed to the other 
resolutions to work out a general agreement that will be 
implemented in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Gen. Shahaq pointed out that there are still issues on which 
the two sides disagree; they will be postponed until after the 
signing of the executive agreement on Gaza and Jericho. 
  Responding to a question on the Jericho area maps and the 
reservations shown by the Palestinian delegation on this issue, 
Shahaq said that what was signed in the "Cairo agreement" will 
not be broached or negotiated again. 
  Regarding the Palestinian delegation's statement that there 
is an understanding on the release of all Palestinian detainees 
without distinction, Gen. Shahaq said: "This is what the 
Palestinians are saying, not the Israelis." He noted that an 
agreement was reached to release 5,000 out of 8,400 detainees in 
two stages. 
  Regarding the legal jurisdiction and its limits if a 
Palestinian citizen should commit a crime in Israel and flee to 
Gaza, Gen. Shahaq said that in such a case he would be handed 
over to Israel to stand trial. Concluding his news conference, 
Gen. Shahaq pointed out that an agreement was reached on all 
issues related to the crossing points between the self-rule 
areas and Israel. He noted that no agreement has been reached 
regarding the Palestinian authority at sea and in the air, which 
is under the Security Committee.

    [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 
GMT on 21 April reports that "the latest round of Israeli-PLO 
talks ended in Cairo a short while ago. The talks are slated to 
resume at the beginning of next week." Dr. Nabil Sha'th told 
correspondent Moti Amir that "several important understandings 
in the security and civil spheres were achieved this week," and 
that he expects that an agreement on the autonomy's legal powers 
will be achieved next week. 
  "Brigadier General Gadi Zohar, head of the Civilian Affairs 
Committee in the Cairo talks, estimated that the Civil 
Administration would be able to transfer powers in Gaza to the 
Palestinians a few days after the agreement is signed." 
  Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1500 GMT on 21 April, 
reporting on "progress" in the Cairo talks, says that "both 
sides were optimistic that an agreement could be wrapped up by 
next week's end. Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the 
Israeli delegation to the talks, said Israel could not meet the 
PLO's demand for a timetable for the release of all Palestinian 
prisoners before an agreement is signed. He described the 
week's negotiations as extremely fruitful." 
  PLO chief delegate, Nabil Sha'th, was also optimistic, and 
spoke to Qol Yisra'el's Moti Amir about the progress made in 
this week's talks, and his expectations for next week. He said 
the negotiations this week concluded "all the elements of the 
transfer of authority. So, all civilian authorities, or what's 
called civil authorities, including water, zoning, air 
transport, telecommunications, electricity, fuel and gas -- all 
of these issues were concluded during this week. We have been 
able to conclude also several remaining items of the security 
protocol or the security annex, but we remain with few of these 
issues, such as the modalities of joint patrols and crossing 
points, and the passage between Gaza and Jericho, and some 
elements that remain in the issue of visas and the renewal of 
visas. All of these will be, I hope, finished during next week. 
We have decided that next Monday we will be more ready to 
announce the exact date of the signing. We, in all 
probabilities and barring major disagreement or major events, we 
should be concluding everything during next week." Sha'th 
added: "We are going to do our best to conclude next week and 
sign the week after." 
  Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1505 GMT on 21 April 
cites a report by Moti Amir who points to the assessment that "a 
date will be set next week for the signing ceremony on the 
Gaza-Jericho accord which will take place in Cairo and will be 
attended by the prime minister, the PLO head, and President 
Mubarak, the main sponsor of the accord." Amir notes that "the 
conclusion of the negotiations on the Gaza-Jericho accord also 
depends on the negotiations on economic issues taking place in 
Paris." Also, besides the remaining dispute on the legal powers 
of the autonomy's authority, "the two sides are still divided on 
the Gaza Strip's fishing zones, the construction of a port 
there, and the stationing of Palestinian policemen at the border 
crossings in Jericho and Rafah. Handling of some of these 
questions will continue after the agreement is signed. 
  "Brig. Gen. Zohar, head of the Civilian Affairs Committee, 
emphasized that upon signing the agreement with the 
Palestinians, a body will be established to coordinate matters 
between the Palestinian authority and the Israeli authorities." 
Amir adds that "the final draft of the agreement on civilian 
issues will be formulated in Cairo next week, except those few 
issues both sides decided to pass on to the two leaders who will 
sign the Gaza-Jericho accord." 
  In an earlier talk with Moti Amir Maj. Gen. Shahaq stressed 
that about 5,000 prisoners would be released in stages, in 
accordance with criteria agreed upon by the sides. Still, "the 
release will not include Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
members, terrorists who murdered Jews, or terrorists who 
operated after the signing of the Declaration of Principles." 
Understandings will have to be achieved also regarding 
"Palestinians who are persecuted by their brethren for 
collaboration with Israel."

<F P=106> [From the "With the Events" program] </F>
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, a new round of talks concluded 
in Cairo today without reaching agreement on all outstanding 
issues. Meanwhile, some progress has been made by the Civilian 
Affairs Committee. Our colleague 'Umar Zaydani sums up the 
outcome of this round of talks: 
  [Begin recording] [Zaydani] Another round of negotiations 
was 
concluded between Israeli and PLO representatives in Cairo this 
afternoon. This round of talks registered great progress on 
several topics listed on the agenda, according to Major General 
Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation to the talks. The 
topics negotiated by the Civilian Affairs Committee have almost 
been settled. However, some issues, such as the Palestinians' 
demand to have an international telephone zone number, as well 
as issues pertaining to stamps and passports, are yet to be 
decided. They will be decided later, that is, after the 
agreement is signed. 
  [Shahaq, in Hebrew, with superimposed translation into 
Arabic] There is also the issue pertaining to the economic talks 
currently under way in Paris. An agreement has to be reached in 
this regard. We have to know what is happening there in order to 
incorporate the economic agreement into the overall agreement. 
There are hurdles facing the Security Committee and the Legal 
Affairs Committee, although some progress has been made. Some 
points on which agreement has been reached have been initialed. 
With respect to the issues that are still under consideration, 
they concern setting a timetable for the release of Palestinian 
prisoners and detainees. The outstanding issues within these 
committees will be discussed early next week. If things continue 
to proceed as they are doing right now, that is, if progress 
continues to be made, we will soon finalize what needs to 
finalized. 
  [Zaydani] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Another week of negotiations 
between Israel and the PLO has ended. You seem to be close to 
an agreement. What are the outstanding issues at present? 
  [Sha'th] As is well known, we have completed the agreement 
on 
the complete transfer of civilian authorities, including tough 
issues such as water, electronics, radio communications, air 
traffic, etc. Likewise, we have completed the larger part of 
the overall agreement. Nonetheless, agreement is yet to be 
reached on four or five sentences. Some security issues whose 
discussion was postponed until next week will have to be 
decided. An overall deal, also known as a package deal 
[preceding two words in English] will have to be reached on 
them. With regard to the issue of jurisdiction [preceding word 
in English] over territory, the population, and functions, a 
solution to this issue has been reached. Nonetheless, this 
solution needs to be drafted and agreed upon in detail next week. 
  With respect to the issue of the Palestinian deportees, I 
would like to reaffirm that there has been a definite agreement 
to release 5,000 prisoners. However, we want to set up a 
framework for the release of the remaining prisoners next week. 
Such a framework must, at least, establish the bases for 
setting specific timetables for the release of prisoners. I 
believe both sides can agree on this issue next week. Next 
week, we will announce a date for the final signing of the 
agreement. I hope the agreement will be signed during the 
period 2-5 May. 
  [Zaydani] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: With regard to the Palestinian 
prisoners, this issue is of great importance to the residents of 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Will all Palestinian prisoners be 
released? Or does Israel have any reservations on the release 
of some prisoners? 
  [Sha'th] Israel has made public its reservations about the 
release of Hamas prisoners and detainees. These reservations 
were the outcome of the two recent operations carried out in 
'Afula and Hadera. However, I believe this Israeli opposition 
to releasing Hamas prisoners is connected to the outcome and 
impact of these two operations. However, the principle we seek 
to entrench is that of a general amnesty. Moreover, the 
Declaration of Principles provides for a general amnesty. We 
want all parties to be covered by this amnesty. This means we 
should not leave in jail those who resisted or fought during the 
period that preceded the signing of the agreement. This 
requires the setting of timetables. To the best of my 
knowledge, Israeli law stipulates that some categories of 
prisoners cannot be released, but can be handed over to another 
authority. When the Palestinian leadership takes over authority 
in Gaza and Jericho, this law will apply to all residents of 
Gaza and Jericho. When we take over authority in the West Bank, 
this law will also apply to the residents of the West Bank. The 
issue has to be governed by both principles and timetables. 
  [Zaydani] Have the talks been promoted by the fact that 
Abu-Mazin [PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas] is 
currently in Cairo, not to mention the meeting held between 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat in Bucharest? 
  [Sha'th] Undoubtedly, these two developments have had a 
positive effect. The fact that brother Abu-Mazin is around 
enables us to meet with him two or three times a day. He 
received us and the Israeli delegation, that is, the chief 
Israeli negotiators, once. I believe this had a positive 
effect. It goes without saying that the high-level meetings 
held with President 'Arafat can expedite the rapid attainment of 
an agreement. 
  [Zaydani] What about the civil aviation agreements? 
  [Sha'th] We reached an agreement in principle in this regard 
this week. The arrangements or modalities [preceding three 
words in English] for this agreement are yet to be agreed upon. 
I believe the agreement reached in principle in this regard is 
good. It provides for the opening of airports in Gaza and 
Jericho. It also provides for operating commercial and civilian 
planes between Gaza and Jericho, and also between them and 
neighboring capitals; at least, the capitals that are are 
currently bound by ties in the context of peace. In the future, 
when peace prevails in the region, this network of 
communications will spread. That is why we said that the first 
international air route that will be launched will be between 
Gaza airport and Cairo International Airport. 
  [Zaydani] One last question. It seems that the agreement 
will be signed, although some other differences regarding 
passports and stamps are yet to be resolved. 
  [Sha'th] With regard to Palestinian passports, Palestinian 
stamps, the size of the Jericho area, and the presence of 
Palestinian soldiers at the Allenby Bridge will be left to be 
decided by President 'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin when the 
two meet. 
  [Zaydani] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Thank you very much. 
  [Sha'th] You are welcome. [end recording]

  [Summary from poor reception] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, President 
Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser and chief of the Palestinian 
negotiating team to the ongoing Cairo talks, has stressed that 
settlement activities are "a major obstacle" to the peace 
process. Regarding the failure to achieve withdrawal on the 
fixed dates and the frequent stoppage of talks, Dr. Sha'th said 
that peace can be achieved step by step, adding that "peace must 
result in the repatriation of refugees to their country and the 
establishment of a state with Jerusalem as its capital." Sha'th 
said that peace must also results in a strong Palestinian 
economy, noting that "peace provides Israel with peace and 
security" and strengthens its economy without depending on U.S. 
support. 
  The chief Palestinian negotiator also dwelt on the 
developments in the peace process. He said: We are in the first 
phase of the "four-phase" peace process. In this phase, "which 
will last several weeks," withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will 
take place and the Palestinian Political Department will enter 
Gaza and Jericho. The second phase is the deployment of 4,000 
Palestinian police one week after Israeli withdrawal. 
Meanwhile, we will be ready to receive economic aid and work on 
the infrastructure will be launched. During this period, a 
committee will arrange for the return of (?88,000) refugees. 
Dr. Sha'th said that the interim phase should not exceed five 
years. He added that during the third phase, Israeli forces 
will withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza Strip and then a force 
of 15,000 Palestinians will become in charge of security 
affairs. Then, international forces will come in to prepare for 
the election of a "Palestinian legislative council." In the 
fourth phase, more important issues will be discussed such as 
security, settlements, borders, [words indistinct]. 
  Palestinian-Israeli talks resumed in Cairo yesterday with 
the 
aim of removing the obstacles preventing the implementation of 
the self-rule agreement in Gaza and Jericho. Responsible 
Palestinian sources said that the two delegations "are drafting 
a general agreement." The sources added that the Civilian and 
Legal Affairs Committees will resume their meetings later. The 
Palestinian sources said that "progress was achieved" on various 
issues. Palestinian and Israeli negotiators reached agreement, 
during the Taba talks, on setting up the Palestinian radio and 
television station. Reports said there are major obstacles to 
the work of the Security and Civilian Affairs Committees 
following the paper presented by Israel at the end of the 
previous round of talks with regard to the legal jurisdiction of 
the Palestinian self-rule.

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent in Paris Eldad Beck] </F>
  [Text] Until midday today, the Israeli delegates spoke of 
serious difficulties the economic talks were encountering, but 
now Finance Minister Avraham Shohat, who heads the delegation, 
speaks of a possible crisis. According to Shohat, the 
Palestinians presented new demands during this week's talks. He 
has informed chief Palestinian delegate Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad 
Quray'] that these demands are unacceptable and that they are 
liable to result in a very serious crisis in the economic 
negotiations. 
  Shohat asserted that the Palestinians want to expand the 
list 
of products whose customs Israel has consented to reduce. The 
original list has been doubled by the Palestinians, and it now 
includes goods to be imported from countries which do not trade 
with Israel, namely Arab countries. We cannot agree to such 
things, Shohat said; the import regime must be uniform. 
  There is no telling whether the Israeli verbal escalation 
was 
designed to produce psychological pressure on the Palestinians. 
In any event, the negotiations will continue through the night. 
Tomorrow the finance minister will return to Israel to attend 
the 24 April cabinet meeting. He will fly back to Paris 
straight after the meeting. The Israeli delegation will stay in 
the French capital to continue the talks with the Palestinians.

  [Text] The Islamic Research Council, headed by his eminence 
the grand imam of al-Azhar, has issued the following statement 
in response to remarks on al-Azhar by some writers: 
  Praise be to God and prayers and salutations be on God's 
messenger Muhammad and all prophets and messengers. "Our Lord! 
Decide thou between us and our people in truth, for thou art the 
best to decide." [Koranic verse] The Islamic Research Council 
of al-Azhar has examined remarks by some writers about al-Azhar, 
particularly about al-Azhar's examination of [literary and 
artistic] material. The council issues this statement to the 
Egyptian people as a reminder and in eagerness to explain and 
stress the task it is entrusted with. The essence of this task 
is to promote God's religion through wisdom and good advice; as 
Almighty God said, "Let there arise out of you a band of people 
inviting to all that is good, enjoying what is right, and 
forbidding what is wrong: They are the ones to attain 
felicity." [Koranic verse] 
  What is to the credit of our glorious nation is that 
religiousness has been instilled in the Egyptian people's souls 
since history began. The Egyptian people, including all their 
trends and inclinations, are clearly religious and adhere to 
God's teachings. 
  Al-Azhar has always been the place sought by students of 
Islamic knowledge from all parts of the world and from the 
Islamic world east and west in realization of God's command in 
his holy book "If a contingent from every expedition remain 
behind, admonish the people when they return to them that thus 
they may learn to guard themselves against evil." [Koranic 
verses] 
  Al-Azhar's task also is to study Islamic sciences, explain 
the facts of religion to people at home and abroad, and present 
them to the people pure, sound, and void of odious bigotry and 
extremism. This is so because al-Azhar seeks a middle course and 
moderation--a characteristic by which al-Azhar and its 
institutions have been known throughout history--out of the 
conviction that this religion is easy and one should not go to 
extremes. This lays on al-Azhar the duty to convey the message 
of Islam to all nations, defend it, and explain its effect on 
the progress of mankind and civilization. 
  It is the destiny of al-Azhar to be the trusted guardian of 
Islamic values and the cultural heritage of this nation. This 
has become deeply entrenched in the minds of the Egyptian 
people, who flock in alarm to the al-Azhar mosque for advice on 
every issue that concerns their Islamic creed, shari'ah, and 
ethics. These are precisely the Islamic principles legislated 
by the Egyptian Constitutions, laws, and by-laws in Egypt, 
culminating in the declaration that Islam is the state's 
religion, Arabic its official language, and the principles of 
the Islamic shari'ah the main source of legislation. 
  If this were the established rule, and indeed it is, then 
there should not be room for any discordant voices or writers 
with twisted ideology to question al-Azhar's right to caution 
against whatever may contradict the teachings of Islam or exceed 
the limits set by God Almighty in His Koran or in the teachings 
of His prophet, peace be upon him, or that it is the ultimate 
authority in this regard. These voices and writers are not new 
to the scene. For decades they have tried to advocate alien and 
imported ideologies and materialistic philosophies, to 
antagonize the heavenly revelation, and to conspire against 
Islam, only to be defeated and fail on every occasion, thank 
God. Today, once again they have come out into the open, taking 
advantage of the extremists' plots, to undermine Islam in its 
entirety, or rather to strike at religion in general. 
  The noble al-Azhar has always been and continues to be 
against any form of extremism and eager to show the bright image 
of Islam, in a bid to uphold what is right, refute and uproot 
what is wrong, and to promote virtue and prohibit vice, as God 
has ordered, with wisdom and good advice. If some are riding 
the wave of extremism and excess, it is the duty of those who 
are well versed to straighten out their deviation and restore 
them to reason. As for those who cannot tolerate Islam and who 
declare themselves and their writings to be at war against its 
rules and rites, there is no place for them in this arena, for 
they are the ones who make things worse by combating extremism 
with an even more misleading and harmful extremism. 
  Judging by their conduct, it is clear that they hold no 
reverence for Allah. Their boldness against Islam's heritage 
and its sources in the Koran and the prophet's tradition is 
evident to all, beyond any doubt. They fail to realize that in 
drifting away from God's religion there is no distinction 
between deviation to the right or to the left, between adding 
and omitting, and between those who question God's religion and 
those who are ungrateful to it. 
  Being the higher body involved in Islamic research, it is 
the 
Islamic Research Council's duty "to give its views on any 
sectarian, social, or economic problem that comes up," and "to 
follow up on all the studies and researches published on Islam 
and the Islamic heritage inside the country and abroad to 
benefit from whatever authentic views they contain, or to 
counter, correct, or react to them." To attain its goals under 
the powers invested in it, the Council may issue recommendations 
to individuals and groups involved in the field of Islamic 
culture in public and private organizations. 
  It would have been better for the voices and pens that 
contest the Honorable al-Azhar's missions to have followed the 
call to pursue an orthodox line of conduct, in word and deed as 
well as in performance, and avoided sparking off disagreements 
on religious issues. They are well aware that those who follow 
the call are careful to obey God's word and cherish Islam, their 
creed and canon. 
  Accordingly, and since the al-Azhar shaykh is by law "the 
grand imam and the highest opinion on all religion-related 
matters," the Council--supported by its chairman, the grand imam 
of al-Azhar--will continue, along with him, to protect the Koran 
and its tradition, guard the bounds established by Allah, and 
necessarily draw attention to the need to rectify deviations or 
twisted conduct regardless of its kind or source. 
  "For the scum disappears like froth cast out, while that 
which is for the good of mankind remains on Earth." [Koranic 
verse] 
  May Allah guide our steps. God as our witness, we have 
conveyed the message. 
  [Signed] Honorable al-Azhar Shaykh and Chairman of the 
Islamic Research Center Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq

territories and its dismantling of settlements. 
  The paper welcomes the visit, noting that it is the first 
time 'Arafat has met with Hamas leaders, particularly Muhammad 
Nazzal and Ibrahim Ghawshah, to prepare for full reconciliation

  [Text] The Political Bureau of the Islamic Resistance 
Movement, Hamas, has issued an important statement on recent 
developments in light of the political perspective set forth by 
the movement, the various official and media reactions to this 
perspective, and the statements made by the U.S. secretary of 
state, enemy officials, and officials of other states. 
  The statement asserts that the valiant popular resistance 
will be stepped up, and that jihad and military operations 
against the Zionist enemy will continue as long as the Zionist 
enemy continues to occupy our blessed Palestinian territories. 
The pursuit of this approach will continue until the liberation 
of all of our usurped Palestinian territories from the 
Mediterranean to the Jordan River. 
  The statement also underscored that the negotiations between 
the 'Arafat leadership and the Zionist entity are doomed to 
failure, because they were based on consecrating injustice, 
aggression, and occupation. The statement noted that the 
statements and communiques issued by the Political Bureau of the 
Islamic Resistance Movement have not contained what some 
attempted to promote, namely, that the movement recognizes the 
usurpative Zionist entity or accepts UN Security Council 
Resolution 242, or that it has abandoned its own platform as 
well as its noble Islamic constants, which deem Palestine to be 
Islamic territory whose abandonment is forbidden, and over which 
there can be no bargaining. 
  Concluding its statement, the Islamic Resistance Movement 
has 
reiterated that it, along with all sincere elements of our 
people, will persist in the jihad and valiant resistance to the 
savage Zionist enemy along the path of victory and liberation.

  [Text] In Damascus, the Hamas Movement has proposed a truce 
with Israel to find a way out of the Palestinian crisis. In a 
statement issued in Damascus, Hamas Political Bureau chief Musa 
Abu-Marzuq said his proposal is based on the following 
principles: Comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, 
the Gaza Strip, and occupied Jerusalem, and the dismantling of 
all settlements in the occupied territories and the evacuation 
of the settlers. 
  Abu-Marzuq emphasized the need to hold free and fair general 
elections among the Palestinian people in order to elect their 
leadership and representatives. He promised the Hamas Movement 
will respect the views of the majority.

<F P=106> [Report by Pinhas 'Inbari] </F>
  [Text] The 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squads yesterday clarified 
for the first time that they will stop fighting Israel when it 
withdraws from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. This is the 
first time an 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam leaflet has featured such a 
statement. 
  The belligerent leaflet announces that Hamas is not 
intimidated by arrests. On the contrary, the recent spate of 
arrests will inspire it to escalate its struggle. The leaflet 
warns Shin Bet officers that their fate will be similar to that 
of No'am Kohen and Hayim Nahmani. 
  The leaflet goes on to point out, however, that the movement 
will pursue its war on "terrorists Rabin and Baraq" as long as 
even a single Israeli soldier remains in the West Bank and Gaza. 
Until now, the leaflets of the military branch of Hamas have 
always referred to an all-out war, and not to a war until the 
end of occupation.

  [Text] Informed Palestinian sources have told our 
correspondent Yoni Ben-Menahem that Hamas is on the verge of 
announcing a new political program that, for the first time, 
will accept international resolutions. The program is considered 
a new peace initiative. This, out of concern that after 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord, public support for 
the PLO will increase considerably at the expense of Hamas. 
  These sources said that the shift in the position of Hamas 
is 
only in the movement's political level, which was epitomized by 
the statements of Musa Abu-Marzuq, one of Hamas' leaders abroad, 
to the Jordanian weekly AL-SABIL. These sources stressed that 
Hamas' military wing opposes this initiative and considers it to 
be recognition of the State of Israel.

  [Text] Tunis -- Important issues are not leaking out of 
the current negotiations between Israel and the PLO. Topping 
these is the primary and sensitive issue in which Israel 
categorically rejects Yasir 'Arafat's entrance into Jericho and 
Gaza after the Israeli withdrawal and during the transitional 
period. 
  This issue exhausted efforts to achieve progress on the 
other 
levels of negotiations. However, Israel considers this issue 
unquestionable and insists on this stand. As a compromise, the 
PLO asked Egypt to intervene in order to rescue the situation. 
Egypt presented a compromise proposal to establish a temporary 
headquarters for 'Arafat in al-'Arish so he would be close to 
Gaza in order to organize matters and to take the helm of the 
government. 
  AKHBAR AL-USBU' learned from well informed Palestinian 
sources that Israel has now completed defining what it calls the 
yellow area between Gaza and Dayr al-Balah, in which there are 
Israeli settlements, and that this area includes the coast. 
  In another development, Yasir 'Arafat asked the Russian 
leadership to intervene in order to cancel Israel's decision not 
to allow him to enter Gaza and Jericho during the self-rule 
period. The Soviets promised to use all means to cancel the 
Israeli decision.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 22 Apr (INA)--Nabil Sha'th, the 
Palestinian president's adviser, has criticized the evasion by 
the U.S. Administration and other Western countries of their 
pledges to extend needed financial aid to the Palestinian 
self-rule area in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Sha'th told the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY correspondent in Cairo 
yesterday that the United States and other Western countries 
halted the extension of the pledged financial aid to the 
Palestinian side. Expressing regret over this deceitful retreat, 
he said that reality has shown that these pledges were merely 
promises. 
  The Palestinian official asserted that, for its part, the 
Zionist entity has also tried to evade its pledges in the 
Washington agreement on Palestinian self-rule in Jericho and 
Gaza. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Confrontation in Fatah Central </F>
Committee Meeting; Abu-'Ala' Threatens To `Resign' Following 
Hani al-Hasan Accusations"] 
  [Excerpt] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Well-informed 
Palestinian sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the meeting 
held by the Fatah Central Committee on 17 April evening under 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat in the PLO headquarters in 
Tunis, which was attended by Hani al-Hasan after a three-month 
absence, was stormy and tense. The Central Committee members' 
escorts who were outside the meeting room heard the heated 
debates and arguments between Hani al-Hasan on the one hand and 
Ahmad Quray' (Abu-'Ala'), Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin), and Hakam 
Bal'awi on the other. 
  The sources said that Abu-'Ala', director of the PLO 
Economic 
Department and head of the Palestinian delegation to the Paris 
economic negotiations with Israel, lost his nerve, became angry, 
and threatened not to go back to Paris. He violently threw the 
file of the Palestinian-Israeli economic negotiations on the 
table as an indication of his refusal to follow up this issue. 
  According to the same sources, a dispute raged between 
al-Hasan and Quray' after the latter delivered the report on the 
Paris negotiations and the economic situation, stressing the 
importance of the achievements he had made. Al-Hasan's protest 
was at the fact that this report was delivered verbally in a few 
minutes. He pointed out that the head of the Israeli delegation 
to the Paris negotiations "held a television seminar one day 
before our meeting during which he briefed the Israelis on the 
content of the Paris negotiations, highlighting the economic and 
political achievements made by the Israeli side, especially with 
regard to issuing a Palestinian currency, part of whose reserve 
would be deposited in the Israeli Central Bank." 
  Al-Hasan said that "this very serious issue should not be 
discussed in such a manner. The economic agreement with all its 
stipulations should be put on the table and distributed to Fatah 
Central Committee members in order to study it clause by clause." 
  Asked about his opinion of the economic agreement being 
prepared in Paris, he said: "The intifadah aimed to sever the 
economic link and demographic coexistence between the Israelis 
and the Palestinians, while the economic agreement aims to link 
the Palestinian economy with the Israeli economy." 
  In his remarks to Central Committee members, al-Hasan said: 
"Based on the theory `tell me what your economy is, and I will 
tell you what your policy is,' instead of the present 
transitional phase resulting in the handover of the land and 
economy, the economic linkage means that at the end of the 
transitional phase there will be no independence, but, rather, a 
Palestinian entity within an Israeli framework." [passage

<F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Jabbar al-Barghuthi] </F>
  [Text] Ramallah -- Fatah has expressed its profound 
concern over the escalation of Israeli practices against the 
Palestinian people in the occupied territories. This escalation 
has caused the daily fall of martyrs and wounded from the 
bullets of Israeli soldiers at a time when Rabin's government is 
claiming that it is keen on achieving peace and a political 
settlement. 
  A statement issued by Fatah yesterday queried the type of 
peace that Rabin's government is seeking while practicing such a 
systematic policy against the sons of the Palestinian people in 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This week four martyrs, in 
addition to scores of wounded, fell in the Ramallah area alone 
from the bullets of Israeli soldiers. 
  The statement noted that this group of martyrs and wounded 
fell while there is talk about peace and at a time when Rabin's 
government is raising a furor over the murder of some Israelis 
and the United States joins with it in condemning these murders. 
Whereas, everyone bites his tongue and does not talk about the 
daily wounds that our people are sustaining at the hands of the 
occupation forces. Even worse, our peoples's reaction is 
depicted as terrorism while no one describes Israel's practices 
as terrorism. 
  The statement stressed that the countries which are trying 
to 
establish peace in the region should, first and foremost, stop 
Israeli practices and the killings. No one should ask our 
people to capitulate and die daily. This is impossible. 
  The statement called on the world to shoulder its 
responsibility in halting Israeli practices.

<F P=106> [By Samir Hamtu] </F>
  [Text] In the first comment on the "peace initiative" 
proposed by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in Amman, 
professor Khalid al-Hindi, dean of the Islamic University and a 
leader of the Islamic Movement in the Gaza Strip, noted that one 
cannot interpret this initiative as a concession by the Islamic 
Movement. He said that the Islamic rejection of the Oslo accord 
and the peace talks between Israel and the PLO stems from the 
fact that this accord does not respond to the Palestinian 
people's right to freedom, sovereignty, and independence. 
  Al-Hindi added: If the Israeli-PLO initiative had included 
full Israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967, 
including Jerusalem, with a commitment to dismantle the 
settlements, this initiative would not have faced widespread 
opposition in the Palestinian street and from the Islamic 
Movement in the current situation. 
  Al-Hindi pointed out that it can be said that Abu-Marzuq's 
remarks contain new references to international legitimacy. 
Al-Hindi expressed the belief that this initiative does not 
address the issue so clearly as much as it refers to 
international resolutions. He added: The important thing is not 
the Palestinian side's but Israel's recognition of those 
resolutions and its readiness to implement them. The PLO 
recognized and accepted the international resolutions, but 
Israel refused to implement them and forced the PLO to accept 
something less. 
  Al-Hindi noted that the Islamic Movement will not accept to 
undergo the same experience and that everything hinges primarily 
on Israeli readiness in this field. 
  Al-Hindi denied the possibility of the Islamic Movement's 
participation in the self-rule bodies. He said: This issue is 
not relevant. Perhaps there might almost be a consensus to 
refuse participation in any institutions or bodies supervising 
the self-rule administration, especially as the Islamic Movement 
opposes the self-rule plan. 
  On the effect of this initiative on the current talks 
between 
Israel and the PLO, al-Hindi expressed the belief that this 
initiative does not represent a blow to the PLO because Israel 
does not desire a just peace that gives the Palestinian people 
their right to land, freedom, and independence. He added: 
Israel will continue its march with the terms that are suitable 
for it. 
  Al-Hindi expressed the belief that this initiative will not 
deal a blow to the peace process, nor will it speed up the 
realization of the Oslo accord because Israel acts on the basis 
of whatever serves its interests and security. 
  On his expectations from the Israeli side's response to this 
initiative, al-Hindi said: I do not expect a significant 
response from the Israeli side because Israel is not thinking, 
at all, of implementing international resolutions and 
withdrawing. Therefore, we do not expect an effective response 
from the Israeli side since there is agreement to continue the 
talks with the PLO on the terms that Israel imposes from a 
position of strength and in which it does not make any 
concessions. 
  Hamas, through Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of its political bureau 
in Amman, had proposed a peace initiative with Israel that 
contained more flexible and realistic conditions than its 
previous proposals.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Recent Campaign of Detentions"] </F>
  [Text] Israel's rulers did not suffice with instructing 
their negotiating delegation in Cairo to show more intransigence 
toward the issue of Palestinian detainees and prisoners in 
Israeli jails but recently gave their security agencies a free 
hand to detain hundreds of Palestinians in the occupied 
territories. Meanwhile, they have declared their intention to 
continue these detentions under the frequently repeated pretext 
of Israeli security. 
  At a time when the negotiating Palestinian side in Cairo is 
insisting on the release of all Palestinian prisoners -- be they 
for or against a settlement -- in order to save as much face as 
possible and to depict the expected settlement as involving the 
entire Palestinian people, Israel's rulers are intent on 
embarrassing and blackmailing the Palestinian negotiating side 
and showing its weakness. Otherwise, this arbitrary campaign of 
detentions, which is liable to accelerate tension in the 
occupied territories and not vice versa, would not have been 
launched. 
  If all democratic forces in the Arab homeland, Israel, and 
the world are expected to condemn the recent campaign of 
detentions, the Palestinian negotiating side is duty bound to 
draw from this campaign appropriate lessons, perhaps most 
important of which is to stop the slide and deterioration of the 
Palestinian negotiating position.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Questions About the Russia's Credibility"] </F>
  [Text] PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's 
visit to Moscow has again focused attention on Russia's role in 
the peace process -- a role that it has continued to play since 
the collapse of the Soviet Union. One of the most prominent 
features of this role has been Russia's cosponsorship, together 
with the United States, of the peace process from the Madrid 
Conference to this date. 
  Much has been said about the dimensions of the Soviet role, 
and subsequently those of the Russian role. Questions have been 
raised over the last decades about the credibility of this role 
through the harsh experience to which Palestinian-Russian (and 
previously Palestinian-Soviet) relations in particular, and Arab 
relations with Moscow in general, had been subjected. 
Comparisons were made between those relations on one hand, and 
Israeli-U.S. relations on the other. 
  The realities of the new international order, which have 
marginalized to a great extent the effectiveness of the Russian 
role in the world, forced Moscow to reduce its foreign 
preoccupations in the interest of difficult domestic and 
economic problems. Thus, Russia trimmed its responsibilities 
and commitments inherited from the Soviet era and often appeared 
as another Western power that attaches greater importance to its 
own private interests. 
  Despite this, observers are noticing signs of Russia sliding 
from the narrow confines of the new role. Hence, the attempts 
to circumvent this role in Bosnia-Herzegovina and expand its 
basis in the Middle East. In particular, those attempts were 
apparent during the Security Council discussions on the issue of 
international protection for Palestinians following the Hebron 
massacre, and also through Russian initiatives and proposals in 
this sphere, which aroused the annoyance of Israel and the West. 
  Will the slow Russian moves in the Middle East continue in 
such a way as to deviate from the Western lines drawn for Soviet 
policy? Such a development requires intense Palestinian and Arab 
efforts, which do not seem to exist right now. Consequently, 
Russian moves will remain subject to mere Russian realities on 
one hand, and the West's political monopolization on the other. 
This does not herald that a significant change will occur in 
Russian diplomacy, at least not in the foreseeable future.

  [Text] Egypt has warned that the UN could lose its 
credibility in the face of the deteriorating situation in 
Gorazde. Dr. Nabil al-'Arabi, Egypt's permanent delegate to the 
UN, said in a speech to the Security Council last night that the 
UN has two alternatives. Either to adopt the collective security 
measures stipulated under the UN Charter to end the existing 
aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina and force the aggressors 
to withdraw or lift the military embargo imposed on Bosnia. 
  Dr. al-'Arabi noted that the Egyptian delegation had 
repeatedly cautioned the Security Council against the 
consequences of failure to adopt decisive measures to ensure a 
firm and decisive remedy of the deteriorating situation in 
Bosnia. He called on the Security Council members to adopt the 
immediate and necessary measures to put an end to this tragedy, 
which cannot be tolerated. Chief among these measures are for 
the NATO to undertake the immediate military actions needed to 
lift the siege of Gorazde, force the Serbs to withdraw from the 
town, back the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government in its legitimate 
right to self-defense, and lift the military embargo imposed on 
it, he added.

  [Text] Cairo, 22 Apr (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR describes the 
United Nation's claim that it is afraid its military 
intervention against the Serbs would lead to a conflagration in 
other areas of Europe as a feeble excuse to justify its 
nonintervention. 
  In its commentary today, the paper denounces the UN Security 
Council's insistence on not allowing the Bosnian people to 
obtain weapons to defend their lives, entity, and future, 
describing it as an ugly crime. 
  The paper says that the United Nations has left the Serbian 
gangs to carry out their war against the unarmed Bosnian people 
without any serious, genuine attempt to put an end to the 
Serbian aggression, which has been going on for the past two 
years. 
  The paper appeals to the states that defend justice to raise 
the issue at the International Court of Justice after the 
responsible organizations have abandoned the people and failed 
to fulfill their sacred duty.

  [Text] Cairo, April 21, SPA -- Saudi Trade Minister Dr. 
Sulayman al-Salim arrived here Wednesday for an official visit 
to Egypt. He was greeted at the airport by First Economy and 
External Trade Undersecretary Dr. Midhat al-Juwayni and the 
minister plenipotentiary at the Saudi Embassy in Cairo Abu-Bakr 
Rafi'. 
  Upon arrival, Dr. al-Salim said he would discuss with 
Egyptian Economy and External Trade Minister Dr. Mahmud Muhammad 
Bayumi overcoming hurdles to develop bilateral trade relations 
in the light of exempting many commodities of custom duties to 
increase their exchange between the two countries. He said he 
would also discuss with Dr. Bayumi removing obstacles hampering 
trade exchange. Pointing to the Saudi participation in the 
Cairo International Fair, he said the kingdom is keen on 
participating in this annual fair on both the official and 
businessmen levels adding that there are many opportunities for 
trade exchange between the two countries. 
  Dr. al-Salim said the purpose of participating in the Cairo 
International Fair is to become acquainted with Egypt's 
accomplishments in various industries which are beginning to 
meet the domestic needs and appear in Saudi markets as well. He 
said another purpose is to display Saudi industrial products for 
Egyptian visitors of the fair, which provides an opportunity for 
Egyptian and Saudi businessmen to meet. He toured the Saudi 
pavilion at the fairand was briefed on the national products on 
display. 
  He also visited the Egyptian General Investment Authority 
pavilion and was briefed on its contents by pavilion supervisors. 
  Speaking to reporters later in the day, Dr. al-Salim said 
the 
volume of trade between the kingdom and Egypt has tripled over 
the past three years from 400 million to 1,200 million Egyptian 
pounds. He pointed to the huge Saudi investments in Egypt and 
stressed that the Egyptian-Saudi joint commission which convenes 
annually is assigned to remove obstacles hindering the economic 
cooperation between the two sisterly Arab countries. He 
applauded Egyptian economic policies and econimc reform measures 
and gave a brief account of the Saudi economic plans since the 
early seventies, which depend on the diversification of sources 
of revenue. He also pointed in this connection to the state's 
support for the private sector and businessmen and confirmed the 
importance of removing obstacles hindering the movement of 
capital and goods among Arab countries, instead of committing 
themselves to a common market.

  [Excerpt] Cairo--Relations between Egypt and Sudan have 
tensed again following a statement by Sudanese President 'Umar 
Hasan al-Bashir, which Cairo considered harmful to its 
sovereignty and an intentional offense, and a strong Sudanese 
protest against a planned conference in Cairo to which rebel 
leaders from south Sudan have been invited. 
  An Egyptian Foreign Ministry source told AL-SAFIR that the 
Sudanese president's statement to the magazine AL-MULTAQA that 
the Egyptian regime has no clear program concerning the Hala'ib 
region and that it always seeks to obstruct negotiations with 
Sudan is unacceptable. 
  The source quoted al-Bashir as saying that "despite all the 
Egyptian acts and positions against Khartoum, the option of 
fighting our Egyptian brothers contradicts our position and 
policy, which reject the idea of sacred borders. This idea is 
one aspect of Arab weakness." 
  Egypt rejected al-Bashir's statement and sent a cable of 
protest to Khartoum saying it flagrantly harms bilateral 
relations. 
  The cable said Sudan always seeks to create tension between 
the two, whether through words, such as al-Bashir's statement, 
or deeds, such as appointing a Sudanese governor to Hala'ib and 
sending "terrorist elements" to the disputed region. 
  The cable also considered al-Bashir's statement a violation 
of the unsigned agreement reached with Egyptian President Husni 
Mubarak in Cairo. The agreement says differences should not be 
discussed through the media. 
  Egypt's refusal to stop a conference on minorities in the 
Arab world, which the Ibn-Khuldun Center for Political Studies 
intends to organize in Cairo, added to the tension. Sudanese 
Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih on Tuesday asked that the 
conference be prevented from taking place because rebel leaders 
from south Sudan, including John Garang and Rick Mashar, are 
scheduled to attend. 
  Diplomatic sources in Cairo said that on Wednesday, Egyptian 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa sent a verbal message to his Sudanese 
counterpart telling him that Cairo rejects the request. He 
explained that the issue hinges on freedom of political and 
intellectual activity in Egypt and is part of free 
decisionmaking. No individual or state has a right to interfere 
in the sovereignty of another country, he said. 
  The sources cited Musa as saying that Egypt is a politically 
open country and that the south Sudanese rebel leaders were 
invited in their capacity as Sudanese citizens. The aim was not 
to entrench separatism. Cairo's firm and principled position 
against any attempt to divide Sudan is well known, Musa said. 
  AL-SAFIR learned that Khartoum may react by organizing its 
own conference. Egyptian political sources expect such a 
conference to include some Islamist leaders, something over 
which Cairo will not remain silent. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Najwa 'Abd-al-'Aziz] </F>
  [Text] Security authorities and some diplomatic quarters 
are conducting extensive investigations into how the names, 
posts, and movements of some foreign diplomats were leaked to 
the extremist al-Jihad organization members who were recently 
arrested. Interpol is also participating in these 
investigations. 
  The security authorities seized a list of the diplomats 
targeted for assassination along with the members of the 
extremist group, which was led by 'Adil 'Awad, who was killed in 
the al-Munib battle on 14 April. 
  The extremists confessed to receiving instructions from 
their 
leadership abroad to assassinate the foreign diplomats, 
especially Americans and Israelis. 
  The security authorities also discovered the underground 
"cells," which the organization's members had prepared in 
al-Qattamiyah and Bilbays to kidnap the diplomats and detain 
them there. 
  An investigation is underway on how the detainees identified 
the persons mentioned in the assassination list, which was 
seized in one of the organization's hideouts. The investigation 
authorities held face-to-face confrontations with the eight 
defendants.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that his remarks 
on the evacuation of settlements on the Golan Heights in 
exchange for peace also expressed his position in general with 
regard to Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. The prime 
minister spoke after leaving a convention of the Shinuy 
[Democratic Movement for Change] movement, in which he also 
noted that the reports he received from Bucharest and Cairo 
indicate progress in the negotiations with the Palestinians. 
Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Nir] The prime minister said that the 
reports he received yesterday from Foreign Minister Peres in 
Bucharest and Major General Amnon Shahaq in Cairo indicate 
progress. He does not know whether concluding the negotiations 
will take one, two, or five weeks; however, he said, we are 
moving closer to the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First 
agreement. 
  Rabin said his position with regard to the evacuation of 
settlements on the Golan Heights in exchange for peace also 
reflects his position in general with regard to Judaea, Samaria, 
and the Gaza Strip. Rabin asserted that his statements are 
unconnected to the negotiations with Syria; however, when 
referring to the Golan Heights, Rabin used the term Syrian soil. 
  [Rabin] I was asked a question on the issue of evacuating 
settlements. I replied that we would not move settlements out 
of security considerations -- not in the Gaza Strip, not in 
Judaea and Samaria, and not on the Golan Heights. For peace, 
however, we will be prepared to evacuate settlements. There is 
a precedent for this: We evacuated all the settlements from the 
Sinai Peninsula and we tore down Yamit. I believe that these 
actions were justified at the time, and there is no reason not 
to do the same today. At the beginning of my remarks, I 
reiterated that our main struggle in the negotiations with Syria 
is how to avoid repeating the same price we paid for peace with 
Egypt -- in other words, to avoid having to implement a full 
withdrawal from every square inch of Syrian soil we conquered 
and having to uproot every vestige of Israeli presence in the 
territory conquered from Syria. 
  [Nir] Rabin was asked whether there was any connection 
between the timing of his announcement and the negotiations with 
Syria. 
  [Rabin] If you read interviews with me that were conducted 
in the past, you will see that I said that although I would not 
evacuate settlements for security, I would evacuate them in 
exchange for peace. Yesterday, I replied to a question on the 
issue of settlement evacuation which a Golan Heights settler 
happened to ask. My reply reflected my general position with 
regard to the Gaza Strip, Judaea and Samaria, and the Golan 
Heights. 
  [Nir] Rabin was speaking upon leaving a convention of Shinuy 
veterans marking the movement's 20th anniversary. [end

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Rabin Is Being Flexible"] </F>
  [Text] Addressing the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Committee on 19 April, the prime minister and defense minister 
disclosed that the withdrawal recommended by the General Staff 
in the event of a peace agreement with Syria is less extensive 
than the withdrawal he finds acceptable. The IDF's [Israel 
Defense Forces] recommendation has not been made public, but the 
fact the Yitzhaq Rabin does not see eye to eye with the present 
General Staff and that he is prepared to say as much to the 
Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee is curious and 
noteworthy. To what point and what line does Rabin believe the 
IDF can withdraw from the Golan Heights without harming Israel's 
security? 
  It should be remembered that the prime minister promised 
U.S. 
President Bill Clinton last month that Israel would provide 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher with "a peace package," to 
be conveyed to Hafiz al-Asad during Christopher's upcoming visit 
to Damascus. Ever since Israel deviated from the Madrid format 
at the Oslo talks, official Washington has been painstakingly 
avoiding interfering too much in the negotiations between Israel 
and the PLO leadership. Although Clinton welcomed the 
Declaration of Principles, the handling of its implementation 
was entrusted to lower ranks. Conversely, the President and the 
secretary of state have shown great interest in promoting the 
Israel-Syria peace process; Rabin cannot help taking this U.S. 
trend into consideration. 
  Therefore, he tasked Major General Ilan Biran with 
organizing 
the preparatory work for a peace package that will be addressed 
to Syria. The Foreign Ministry, which the prime minister 
avoided in this context, has also lent a hand to the task. Yet 
on 19 April, the prime minister described all these papers as 
materiel ("data") for discussion; he was referring both to the 
papers prepared by the Foreign Ministry and to the document 
produced by Gen. Biran and his advisers. Rabin stressed that 
the final decision will be made by the political echelons; he 
made it clear that as a military man, he would have preferred a 
status quo on the Golan Heights, but, he said, "there is a 
political reality which binds us." In other words: Israel 
cannot evade making a commitment in principle to effect some 
withdrawal. 
  Rabin still speaks of withdrawal "on the Golan," not "from 
the Golan." He did not discard this stand at the Foreign 
Affairs and Defense Committee. Yet he must have sensed that 
with regard to the extent of withdrawal, the Israeli fist should 
not remain as close as it has been to date. The prime minister 
is aware of the weight of the precedent of the peace accord with 
Egypt, and he would like that weight to be reduced, because he 
is not eager to give up conquered land, because he would like to 
avoid confrontation with the settlers, and because he wants to 
demonstrate adherence to the Labor platform advocating 
territorial compromise. Yet he seems to be readier than in the 
past to meet Syria halfway, and his remarks of 19 April seem to 
be sending a signal in al-Asad's direction. 
  Two questions arise in the wake of the revelation that Rabin 
is more flexible than the IDF General Staff: Will Clinton and 
Christopher perceive his attitude as an appropriate recourse to 
persuade al-Asad to meet Israel halfway? And, if the Americans 
are pleased, will the Syrian president be prepared to heed the 
secretary of state's coaxing -- if the latter indeed makes such 
an effort -- and withdraw his demand to receive back the entire 
Golan? 
  Yitzhaq Rabin has marched a step forward. In a sense, he has 
passed the ball over to the Damascus court.

  [Excerpt] Activists working on behalf of keeping the Golan 
Heights under Israeli control say they are launching a giant 
campaign following Prime Minister Rabin's statement yesterday 
that he would be willing to dismantle settlements on the Golan 
Heights in exchange for peace with Syria. On the fallout from 
the preime minister's statement, David Ze'ev: 
  [Begin Ze'ev recording] Golan Heights activists from around

described as a giant demonstration and information campaign. 
Over 100 branches of the Golan movement are preparing for 
intensive activity during the coming weeks, following the prime 
minister's statement yesterday on dismantling Golan settlements. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has tried to 
lower 
expectations for his visit to the Middle East, which he 
announced will start Sunday, but Israel's Deputy Foreign 
Minister Yosi Beilin says the prime minister's statement 
yesterday was one of a series by Israeli officials recently that 
contribute to the possibility of changing the very slow pace of 
negotiations with Syria, as he put it, to something which is 
more intensive than that. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Rabin this morning held 
consultations on what is thought to be the final stage of the 
peace talks. Israeli and PLO leaders have said the talks may be 
completed next week, though this was not certain. If they are, 
the agreement could be signed in Cairo by Rabin and Yasir 
'Arafat in the first week of May. Jack Katzenell reports: 
  [Begin Katzenell recording] Taking part at this morning's 
meeting at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv were Prime Minister 
Rabin, Justice Minister David Liba'i, Environment Minister Yosi 
Sarid, and the Israeli negotiators at the Cairo talks, headed by 
Major General Amnon Shahaq. It emerged that the civilian issues 
being negotiated with the PLO were almost completely settled. 
These have to do with the transfer of power in Gaza and Jericho 
from the Israeli civilian administration to the Palestinian 
authority and many other matters. But certain issues have not 
yet been settled -- for example, the number of Palestinian 
prisoners to be released. The criteria for their release were 
discussed at this morning's meeting. They will not include 
those who have murdered Israelis, and Israel insists that they 
should not include people who committed terrorist acts after 13 
September, when the Oslo agreement was signed. The most 
difficult issue not yet settled is that of jurisdiction. 
  Minister Yosi Sarid said after this morning's meeting that 
no 
Israeli will be tried in a Palestinian court. If an Israeli is 
accused of committing an offense in Gaza or Jericho, he will be 
tried in Israel, Sarid said. If this or any other issue is not 
settled by next week, the Israeli and PLO liaison committee will 
meet in Cairo under the joint chairmanship of Foreign Minister 
Peres and Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas]. [passage omitted] [end

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says a new and 
aggressive type of religious conversion has evolved in the Arab 
world, and its seeds are being felt even in the Israeli Arab 
sector. This is an extreme religious approach whose adherents 
refuse to recognize any non-Islamic political entity. This 
credo motivates the activities of Hamas and other radical 
organizations in the territories. Therefore, an arrangement 
with the PLO is the only possibility. The prime minister made 
these remarks in a meeting with kibbutzim members.

  [Text] The closure on the territories has been eased. 
Some 1,000 Gaza residents were today allowed to enter the Green 
Line boundaries through the Erez roadblock. Our correspondent 
Shlomi Eldar reports that entry permits were granted not only to 
laborers but also to family members of Palestinians who are 
detained in Qezi'ot, as per an agreement reached in negotiations 
between Fatah and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. The IDF 
commander in the Gaza Strip also permitted PLO people to enter 
Israel. They had been allowed free passage in the past, but 
their exit from the Strip was restricted after the imposition of 
the closure.

  [Text] Security forces are carrying out an intensive 
investigation following the discovery near Jerusalem of the body 
of a soldier. He was identified as Shahar Simani, age 20, of 
Ashqelon. The funeral will take place in Ashqelon this 
afternoon. Details from Tzvi Pantanowitz: 
  [Begin Pantanowitz recording] Shahar Simani's body was found 
in a wadi near the Arab village of Bayt Hanina, on the northern 
edges of Jerusalem. He had been stabbed several times in the 
back. A local resident found the body and summoned the police 
around 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon. Police and its special 
criminal investigation unit have been working around the clock 
to try to establish what happened. They say that the soldier 
was killed some 20 hours before the body was found and that he 
obviously struggled fiercely with his captors before he was 
murdered. 
  The alarm was given by Simani's girlfriend, a resident of 
Moshav Massu'ot Yitzhaq near Ashqelon, yesterday morning. She 
said that Simani had telephoned at about 8 PM on Wednesday to 
say he was on his way to her from Beersheba after leaving his 
base in the south, where he was training to be an officer. It 
is thought that he took a bus to the Qastina junction from where 
he may have hitchhiked to Massu'ot Yitzhaq, about 10 km away. 
  Security authorities think he was picked up by hostile 
elements. They are puzzled by the fact that the body was dumped 
so far away and are considering the possibility he was kidnapped 
in a car with Israeli license plates. Security forces have 
noted also that although his personal weapon disappeared, his 
identity tag and Army identity card were not taken -- moves 
common to the actions of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. 
In addition, no terror group has so far claimed responsibility. 
The authorities are seeking witnesses who may have seen Simani 
getting into a car on Wednesday night. 
  Prime Minister Rabin last night said that the soldier had 
been murdered by the enemies of peace, who were continuing to 
strike at Israelis in an attempt to strengthen those in Israel 
who were deluding themselves that halting the peace talks would 
stop the killing. Continued rule over another people would only 
increase terror, Rabin said. With all the pain involved, Israel 
would continue to fight extremist terrorism and to negotiate for 
peace. 
  Shahar Simani, who was completing an officer's course, was 
promoted posthumously to the rank of second lieutenant. [end

<F P=106> [From the "With the Events" program] </F>
  [Text] Representatives of families of Israeli Defense 
Force's POW's and MIA's met with Faysal al-Husayni at the 
headquarters of the Palestinian delegation in east Jerusalem 
today. They handed him a letter to be delivered to the 
Palestinian leadership in Tunis. 
  Ahmad 'Ubaydat attended the meeting. Here are more details 
on this story: 
  [Begin recording] ['Ubaydat] A delegation representing the 
families of Israeli MIA's met with Faysal al-Husani at the 
headquarters of the Palestinian delegation in east Jerusalem 
this afternoon. The delegation was headed by (Yona Bawmel), 
father of MIA soldier (Zakharia). 
  [Bawmel, in Hebrew, with superimposed translation into 
Arabic] The meeting was cordial. I proposed to al-Husayni that 
we embark on joint cooperation in the interests of both sides. 
We hope that there will be joint cooperation between both sides. 
  ['Ubaydat] (Bawmel) handed al-Husayni a memorandum to be 
delivered to the Tunis-headquartered Palestinian leadership. 
The memorandum explains the agonies of the families of MIA's. 
  With regard to al-Husayni, he commented at the end of the 
meeting, saying: 
  [Al-Husayni] Indeed, at this point in time, there is no 
doubt 
that the two peoples are suffering. There are Israeli MIA's, 
whose families are suffering. Likewise, there are Palestinian 
MIA's, whose families are also experiencing agony. This meeting 
was held at the request of the Israelis. A representative of 
the Society in Charge of Locating Palestinian MIA's attended 
this meeting. During this meeting, the Israelis asked us to 
obtain from the PLO the information it could have on Israeli 
MIA's. As far as we are concerned, we appreciate this position. 
We can understand the Israelis' suffering. But, we also 
discussed with the Israeli delegation the fate of the 
Palestinian MIA's, particularly since both sides must work to 
resolve the problem of Israeli and Palestinian MIA's regardless 
of the political problems that could face them. 
  ['Ubaydat] In reply to a question on the meetings held 
between Peres and 'Arafat in Bucharest, al-Husayni said: 
  [Al-Husayni] I hope they will manage to resolve some of the 
problems still obstructing the Cairo talks during these meetings. 
  ['Ubaydat] Several children of Israeli MIA's staged a 
demonstration before the headquarters of the Palestinian 
delegation. They raised placards demanding the release of the 
Israeli MIA's. [end recording]

Dr. Jawad al-'Anani has said several reasons led to Prime 
Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali's decision to cancel his 
visit to Bucharest, where he was due to participate in the Grans 
Montana Forum, in which politicians and businessmen from Europe 
and the Middle East take part. 
  He said the most prominent of these reasons is the 
inauguration of the extraordinary session of the House of 
Representatives, and the rumors that Prime Minister al-Majali 
would meet with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres at the 
sidelines of the forum meetings. Al-'Anani said these reasons 
called for adopting the decision not to go. 
  Meanwhile, Dr. al-'Anani said Jordan was not officially 
informed of the schedule of U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's tour in the region, and Jordan did not ask for 
this schedule. 
  Al-'Anani was answering a question on AFP report that 
Christopher will not stop in Amman and will meet with His 
Majesty King Husayn in London next Monday.

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by the House of Representatives </F>
in Amman on 21 April--read by announcer] 
  [Text] In its session yesterday, the House of 
Representatives discussed the latest political developments, 
represented by the Israeli threats to Jordan and the continuing 
U.S. siege of the Port of al-'Aqabah. The House is of the view 
that the historic speech by His Majesty King Husayn on 
completing the first phase of the third Hashemite restoration of 
the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of Rock has again emphasized 
Jordan's firm pan-Arab policy on the Palestinian cause, the 
peace plan, and Arab and humanitarian issues. The House 
expresses its full support for the Jordanian position on the 
concept of a just peace in the region, based on the rights of 
the Palestinians in their Palestinian homeland and the return of 
Arab sovereignty over Jerusalem, in harmony with international 
legitimacy and human rights. 
  The House of Representatives reiterates its rejection and 
utter denunciation of any Israeli or Western accusations or 
threats under the pretext of supporting what Israel calls 
terrorism, and holds the Israeli Government responsible for the 
results of hindering the peace and stalling the implementation 
of the UN resolutions known the world over, and and 
circumventing these resolutions by exploiting U.S. support for 
it and the weakness of the Arab position and Arab coordination. 
  The House expresses its strong support for the struggle and 
steadfastness of the Palestinian Arab people in their legitimate 
defense of their land and rights and stresses its stand by our 
Palestinian people in their just struggle and jihad, which is 
guaranteed by all international norms and agreements, the Geneva 
Conventions, and human rights charter. 
  The House highly appreciates His Majesty King Husayn's 
personal backing for the restoration of the al-Aqsa Mosque and 
the Dome of the Rock and values his majesty's efforts to 
preserve the Arab city of Jerusalem, the symbol of peace, and 
the Muslim and Christian holy places in it, from any tampering 
whatsoever. The House also expresses its denunciation and 
condemnation of the continuous U.S. aggression against the Arab 
nation, represented by the continuing unjust U.S. blockade on 
the Gulf of Aqaba with the aim of putting all kinds of pressure 
on steadfast Jordan, to deny it the freedom of national choice, 
to compel it to abandon its firm pan-Arab policies, and force it 
to sign a separate peace with Israel in order to serve the 
Israeli and U.S. objectives of controlling the region and its 
wealth. The House voices its denunciation of the U.S. blockade 
against the fraternal people of Iraq and the continuing denial 
of food and medicine to Iraq.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Foreign Secretary's Statements"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said: I 
have proposals to ease the result of the naval blockade imposed 
on the Port of al-'Aqabah. The 45-month embargo on Iraq has 
caused a heavy burden for Jordan. Relations between Jordan and 
the United States are excellent. The U.S. position on Jerusalem 
has not changed. The United States seeks to reach a 
comprehensive peace in the region, and my tour emphasizes this. 
  These are highlights of Christopher's statements, which he 
made at a news conference via satellite broadcast by several 
world capitals. 
  If we want to assess these statements, we cannot but 
describe 
them as positive and consider them points in favor of the U.S. 
policy in the region, that is assuming they were not made just 
for consumption or to prepare for Christopher's upcoming tour of 
the region, which will begin within days, in his capacity as a 
full partner in the current peace negotiations between the Arabs 
and Israel. 
  For the U.S. secretary of state to take note of the fact 
that 
the siege imposed on Iraq and the siege of al-'Aqabah have 
caused a considerable burden for Jordan is something very 
important, but talk and statements are one thing and actual 
implementation is something else. 
  If the United States is serious about what it says, then the 
first thing that it should do is to stop these measures and stop 
all practices that cause any harm to any people in the region. 
  As for the peace process, the United States, which is the 
full partner and main sponsor, should play its role honestly and 
neutrally and without a clear and open bias to the Israeli side 
as the situation is now. Israel still shows disregard for 
international charters and resolutions and is obstructing the 
path of peace in a bid to abort the peace process and preempt 
the negotiations with the Arabs from tackling any issue that 
brings a just and comprehensive peace closer. 
  The United States continues to supply Israel with all means 
of strength, most modern weapons, and all it needs to remain 
superior in the region, continue its deviation, and practice all 
forms of repression, terrorism, killing, and siege on the 
occupied territories, destroying houses, and launching 
aggressions against cities and villages, whether in occupied 
Palestine or south Lebanon. All these practices are carried out 
while the U.S. Administration is aware of them. 
  At any rate, we are going to take Warren Christopher's 
statements seriously, and we hope to see implementation on the 
ground. Only then we will reconsider what is said about the 
U.S. full bias toward Israel.

<F P=106> ["Every Day" column by Tariq Masarwah: "Congratulations"] </F>
  [Text] We would like to congratulate the U.S. Embassy in 
Amman for being able, over the past 48 hours, to impose a 
complete media blackout on the stand of the Jordanian observer 
at the multilateral water talks held in Muscat. The Jordanians 
did not know what really happened there. They only know the 
bits that were broadcast by the Israeli media, which celebrated 
the occasion, and the bits that were broadcast by the BBC, which 
is usually interested in details such as the kinds of fish that 
are threatened with extinction in Iraq's marshlands or the red 
collar of General Garang in southern Sudan. 
  We began by announcing that we will not contribute to the 
peace process so long as the siege imposed on our country 
continues and we ended with sending an observer to Muscat and 
with imposing a complete blackout about what happened in the 
Omani capital. What happened is not far away from the 
Israeli-U.S. game. 
  What is required now is to consolidate both the principle of 
siege and negotiations. What is required now is to achieve 
regional cooperation with Israel before reaching peace. What is 
required is to set up a center for water studies, without 
mentioning the region's water, the rights of the participant 
countries, or Israel's theft of this water. What is required is 
to set up a Palestinian water authority without mentioning its 
powers or the extent of its responsibility for Palestine water 
on the land of Palestine. 
  It is the same game faced by the Jordanian negotiator who 
places the issue of al-Yarmuk River on the negotiating table. 
Meanwhile, the Israeli negotiator pushes away the Jordanian 
negotiator's figures and maps and says in a disgusting way: The 
entire region needs water. So, why do we not think of big 
desalination projects? Why do we not start big projects to draw 
the water of the Turkish rivers Seyhan and Ceyhan ? All this 
means that the al-Yarmuk River is not a subject for discussion, 
that you must accept God's distribution of water, that the 
Jordan Valley must depend on technology and drip irrigation, 
that the Jordan River will be part of the environmental issues, 
and that all these issues will be discussed within the 
multilateral talks. 
  It is the same game. The important thing is the negotiations 
-- negotiations in Washington whose objective is to hold 
negotiations provided that they are secret negotiations. The 
objective also is to hold many negotiations provided that they 
are held in Arab capitals -- in whose hotels and streets Israeli 
officials will walk freely -- and provided that the Israeli 
television carry these talks live to the people who are besieged 
in their houses in villages and cities in the occupied 
territory, to the families of the victims of al-Aqsa and 
al-Ibrahimi Mosques, to the Israeli Defense Forces, and to the 
settlers who shoot indiscriminately and kill pregnant women and 
children at play. 
  It is fine for the Jordanians not to know what their 
observer 
has done in Muscat while satellites bring them the latest summer 
fashions from the well-known Paris fashion houses.

  [Text] Jordanian security authorities have reinforced 
security precautions to protect Iraqi opposition figures 
residing in Amman after the assassination of Shaykh Talib 
al-Suhayl in Beirut. 
  The Jordanian Interior Ministry asked the Iraqi opposition 
in 
Jordan to stop its political and media activities against Iraq 
and to adhere to observed regulations and laws. The Jordanian 
Interior Ministry also decided not to renew the residency of any 
Iraqi opposition after it expires. This is in order to limit 
the activities of the Iraqi opposition and to prevent any future 
tension between Jordanian authorities and the opposition if it 
violates the red lines set by the Jordanian Government. 
  It was learned that although the Jordanian Government 
allowed 
a number of Iraqi opposition members to live in Amman, this does 
not mean they are allowed to practice political and media 
activities. This is especially true because Jordan is a 
democratic country and cannot prevent any Arab citizen from 
living in it as a long as he adheres to the regulations and 
laws. Despite the fact that the opposition is carrying out 
some simple social activities and is sending some faxes here and 
there, this is not the same as allowing the Iraqi opposition to 
work.

  [Text] Today in his Prime Ministry office, Prime Minister 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali received Iraqi Minister of Awqaf 
'Abd-al-Mun'im Salih. The prime minister also received Ghalib 
al-Qirshi, Yemeni minister of awqaf and guidance. The two 
meetings were attended by Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Abbadi, minister 
of awqaf and Islamic affairs. 
  During the two meetings views were exchanged on various 
issues of concern to Arab and Islamic countries. The Iraqi 
Awqaf minister expressed his thanks to the king, people and 
Government of Jordan for their pan-Arab stands and their support 
for various Arab issues that reinforce Arab solidarity. He said 
the Arab and Islamic delegations were eager to take part in the 
Kingdom's celebrations of the third Hashemite-sponsored 
renovation of the holy Dome of the Rock. He said the 
celebration has a deep meaning in terms of everyone's concern 
about the Arabism of Jerusalem. This is important to all. 
Jordan had the privilege of renovating it, despite the 
difficult circumstances it is facing. He said the issue of 
Jerusalem should unite Arabs and Muslims during the current 
circumstances facing the nation. He noted the importance of 
holding meetings among Arabs and Muslims in order to strengthen 
ties and prevent differences. 
  For his part, the Yemeni minister made statements to the 
Jordanian News Agency PETRA noting the importance of exchanging 
views and ideas among the brothers to reach positive results 
that should unite the nation's ranks.

  [Text] His Highness Crown Prince Hasan, the Regent, 
received former Algerian president Ahmed Ben Bella at the Royal 
Hashemite Court today. 
  During the meeting, the two sides discussed prospects of 
Arab 
cooperation and detente as well as efforts to clear the 
atmosphere and bolster inter-Arab relations. 
  President Ben Bella praised continued Jordanian efforts to 
protect the holy places in holy Jerusalem and to maintain the 
Arabism of Jerusalem against the Israeli siege imposed on it and 
Israel's continued efforts to Judaize it. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. 
President, could you give us an idea about your meeting with his 
highness the crown prince this morning? 
  [Ben Bella] I must say that I am not a visitor. I consider 
myself from this country. The crown prince is my brother. 
Frankly, it is a wedding day for me when I visit you. I came 
to take part in the celebrations of the third 
Hashemite-sponsored renovation of the al-Aqsa Mosque in 
Jerusalem. I came to see my brothers and ask about them. We 
are really proud of you all. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, how do you view talk in 
Algeria about prospects of dialogue between the Algerian 
Government and the Islamic Salvation Front? 
  [Ben Bella] It is a serious dialogue and I believe it will 
bear fruit soon, God willing. The situation in Algeria is 
difficult but not in the way it is being exaggerated outside. I 
mean the situation is not easy, but the process of reaching an 
agreement and achieving national reconciliation is going on. 
Many elements, including the new president, are seeking to 
achieve national reconciliation. 
  [Correspondent] The final question, Mr. President. 
Throughout your years of struggle, you always called for better 
inter-Arab relations for a better Arab future. How do you view 
inter-Arab relations now and efforts to clear the Arab 
atmosphere? 
  [Ben Bella] I am satisfied with this. The issue of unity is 
a given. We must unite. The world is uniting. Europe is 
uniting. America even united with Mexico. How can we not unite? 
We must unite. God willing, we will achieve unity even though 
this will take time and even though there are obstacles. 
However, we must unite. To be or not to be. We will unite, 
God willing. 
  [Correspondent] God willing, sir. 
  [Ben Bella] Our conscience is united. Regardless of what 
governments may think, our conscience is united. We must unite, 
God willing. 
  [Correspondent] God willing. Thank you Mr. President. [end

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Positive Signals, Future Hopes"] </F>
  [Text] The reported acceptance by Islamic resistance 
Movement, Hamas, of a negotiated settlement to the Arab-Israeli 
conflict is a welcome development. The apparent shift in the 
movement's strategy was spelled out by one of Hamas's senior 
members, the head of its political bureau, Musa Abu-Marzuq who 
is based in Damascus. It was confirmed yesterday by Hamas 
leaders in the occupied territories. Both Jordan and the U.S. 
received this development warmly. 
  This shift in the hardline Islamist group's thinking, which 
so far advocated a maximalist position, is an omen of goodwill 
not only for the Palestinian-Israeli track of negotiations but 
also for the wider Arab-Israeli Muslim-Western conflict. 
  On the Palestinian-Israeli track, Hamas occupies a leading 
role both in the occupied territories, especially in Gaza, and 
among the Damascus-based Palestinian rejectionists, the 
so-called Alliance of Palestinian Forces that groups 10 factions. 
  If Hamas would join the negotiations that would certainly 
lead to reduced tension in the occupied territories, would 
strengthen Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat's hand both in the Palestinian camp and in his 
quest for an accelerated process and would expose Israeli 
hardliners. What matters now is how Israel and the PLO would 
respond to the Hamas initiative. Any deal with Hamas now, 
either on the Israeli or on PLO behalf, would smoothen 
transition towards Palestinian self-rule and put to rest fears 
of imminent Palestinian infighting. 
  On the Arab front, any involvement of Hamas in the peace 
negotiations would lead to the mitigation of Islamists' 
ideologies especially in Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan. The Muslim 
Brotherhood movements in Egypt and in Jordan can only be 
expected to lend support to their Palestinian brothers. 
Likewise, Lebanon's Shi'ites will be watching to see if their 
fellow Islamists in Palestine would be wrestling Palestinian 
right from the Israelis through negotiations. 
  On the wider Muslim-Western front, Hamas's involvement in 
peace negotiations with Israel and by extension the U.S. will 
open a main channel of communication between Muslims and the 
West that can only lead to an enhanced understanding between the 
two. 
  We see in the development a precious opportunity that should 
be seized by the Palestinians, Arabs, Israelis and Americans. 
In light of that we see the response by the Jordanian 
government and the U.S. administration as positive signs the PLO 
and Israel should emulate.

  [Text] Beirut -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri 
yesterday received Construction and Building Minister Majid 
'Izzu Ruhaybani and the members of his delegation who arrived in 
Beirut yesterday morning. 
  The meeting was attended by Dr. Hasan Yusuf, chairman of the 
Council of the South; and Nasri Khuri, secretary general of the 
Higher Syrian-Lebanese Council. 
  The discussion during the meeting dealt with bilateral ties, 
historical bonds, and existing relations between the two 
fraternal countries and means of strengthening them for the sake 
of their common interests and aims. 
  In a statement to journalists, minister Ruhaybani reaffirmed 
Syria's continued support for Lebanon's national unity, 
reconstruction and struggle to liberate its occupied territory. 
He said that Syria, as directed by President Hafiz al-Asad, is 
always ready, prompted by a fraternal motive, to carry out any 
project needed by Lebanon. 
  The minister pointed to the schools that were built in 
southern Lebanon by Syrian companies in cooperation with the 
Higher Committee in Support of the South, saying: We are ready 
to contribute toward the reconstruction of Lebanon within the 
framework of the existing strong fraternal cooperation between 
the two countries. 
  Ruhaybani and his delegation held a meeting yesterday 
afternoon with Dr. Hasan Yusuf, chairman of the Council of the 
South, and the Council board members during which they discussed 
their joint work in the services projects which are being 
carried out in southern Lebanon through joint financing by the 
Syrian Committee of Solidarity With the People of the South and 
the Council of the South. The discussion also dealt with 
aspects of future cooperation and means of backing the 
steadfastness of the people of southern Lebanon and western 
al-Biqa' in confronting the repeated Israeli attacks. 
  Dr. Hasan Yusuf praised the continuous support given by 
Syria 
under the leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad to the people of 
the South to ensure their steadfastness against the Israeli 
occupation. He said in a statement to the Syrian Arab News 
Agency that the projects which have been carried out in southern 
Lebanon with joint Syrian-Lebanese financing affirm the 
importance of the Syrian role in ensuring the means and 
requirements for the steadfastness of the people of the South 
against Israeli attacks. 
  Dr. Yusuf expressed the southern Lebanese people's thanks to 
President Hafiz al-Asad for ordering the building of schools and 
the reconstruction of houses which were destroyed by the Israeli 
occupation forces through contribution of building materials and 
the expertise of Syrian companies which are carrying these 
projects, including schools, roads, electrification, buildings, 
and so forth. 
  Ruhaybani also met with Muhammad Bassam Murtada, Lebanese 
minister of public works and transport. The discussion dealt 
with Syrian-Lebanese relations and the strengthening of the 
existing fraternal bonds between the two countries and 
supporting the implementation of services projects which are 
being carried out by the Syrian General Construction Company in 
fraternal Lebanon.

  [Text] Beirut -- Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri yesterday 
received Finance Minister Dr. Muhammad Khalid al-Mahayini and 
Transport Minister Dr. Mufid 'Abd-al-Karim in the presence of 
Lebanese Minister of State for Financial Affairs Fu'ad 
al-Sanyurah, Transport Minister 'Umar Misqawi, and Secretary 
General of the Higher Syrian-Lebanese Council Nasri Khuri. 
  Misqawi received the Syrian finance and transport ministers 
and the accompanying delegation which included the directors of 
the two ministries on their arrival at the Syrian-Lebanese 
border post yesterday morning. They were also received by Nasri 
Khuri. 
  Minister Misqawi affirmed that the meeting with the two 
Syrian ministers is a continuation of the meetings taking place 
between the two countries within the framework of the special 
relations between them, especially in the field of transport 
between Lebanon and Syria. 
  Dr. al-Mahayini said the visit is a continuation of the 
meetings between the two fraternal countries in implementation 
of the Treaty of Fraternity, Cooperation, and Coordination, 
which is aimed at unifying systems between the two countries and 
removing all obstacles, especially with regard to transport 
which is the aim of the visit. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim said: We are following up what we have 
begun. We will discuss setting certain rules to control the 
movement of individuals and goods between the two countries. 
  Nasri Khuri also made a statement in which he said: Our 
meeting is aimed at implementing the agreement on the movement 
of goods and individuals, facilitating this process, and 
discussing the fees which will be charged on cars and trucks. 
  Regarding agricultural cooperation between the two 
countries, 
Agricultural and Agrarian Reform Minister As'ad Mustafa said 
that he and Lebanese Agriculture Minister 'Adil Qirtas submitted 
to Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri the results of the 
meetings they held in Damascus and Beirut. 
  In a statement following his meeting with al-Hariri 
yesterday, the minister added: These meetings resulted in the 
signing of three protocols on joint agricultural cooperation 
between the two fraternal countries in the fields of: 1) 
agriculture, both vegetable and animal; 2) agricultural 
quarantine; and 3) veterinary quarantine. We also reviewed the 
subject of the joint marketing company, whose draft agreement is 
almost ready. 
  Minister Mustafa affirmed the importance of these protocols 
in developing relations of mutual cooperation in the interest of 
the one people in the two fraternal countries.

<F P=106> [Press Review] </F>
  [Text] In a commentary entitled "The Israeli Obstacle and 
the U.S. Responsibility," AL-THAWRAH says: U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher will arrive in the region on the day 
after tomorrow on a new tour whose set objective is to secure a 
breakthrough on all tracks of the peace talks. 
  The paper notes that Christopher lacks optimism about the 
outcome of his upcoming tour even before it has begun. The 
commentary speculates that this is due to the current situation 
of the peace process. As the U.S. Administration knows, this 
process is now backed up against an impasse due to its constant 
collision with the Israeli position, which rejects the bases and 
principles of this process as well as the only objective for 
which this process was unleashed; namely, establishing a real 
peace based on the literal implementation of the Madrid formula, 
the relevant UN resolutions, and the land-for-peace principle. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: If we analyze the Israeli position on this 
process, we will find that Israel rejects the Madrid formula and 
bases in order to replace them with another formula that 
conforms to Israel's expansionist objectives after Israel has 
discovered that this formula--which seeks a just and 
comprehensive peace--conflicts with what Israel wants and seeks 
to achieve through the kind of peace it seeks. 
  Noting the Israeli officials' intransigent positions on 
Jerusalem, withdrawal from the Golan, and settlements, the paper 
says: These positions irrevocably confirm that Israel is not 
seeking a balanced and durable peace; it is only seeking a 
partial solution that would maintain its occupation of the Arab 
territories or at least the largest portion of these territories. 
  AL-THAWRAH continues: As long as the set objective of 
Christopher's upcoming regional tour is to secure a breakthrough 
on all tracks of the peace talks, it is better for this tour to 
focus on removing the reasons behind both the stumbling peace 
process and the tense regional situation. Naturally, all these 
are caused by Israel in a bid to ensure success for its 
objectives. 
  Concluding its commentary, the paper urges the U.S. 
Administration to exert the utmost pressures on Israel in order 
to make it yield to international will and legitimacy. 
  In another commentary on the same topic, AL-THAWRAH says: 
Christopher has stated that his tour will remarkably routine, 
that it will be devoid of any U.S. peace plans, and that he does 
not expect it to bring any effective detente. These statements 
remove, in advance, any remaining optimism and dash the hopes 
for a possible circumvention of the current impasse and deadlock 
in the peace process or for activating the talks which have 
stumbled due to Israeli intransigence. 
  The paper adds: Given this new tone, which is in harmony 
with both the U.S. statements and shipments of financial, 
military, and political aid to Israel--which reached a peak 
recently--we must wonder: What interest does peace have in all 
this? What interest does the U.S. people have in keeping the 
region volatile, subject to setbacks, and mortgaged to Israeli 
terrorism and occupation that violates all values and defies all 
international norms and laws and human rights? 
  Concluding its comment, AL-THAWRAH says: As long as U.S. 
political decisionmaking is biased toward Israel, and as long as 
the Security Council resolutions are not implemented, efforts 
will continue to be a waste of time and peace will not be 
achieved if the occupied Arab territories and rights are not 
regained.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will 
begin a new tour of the region within days in a mission aimed at 
advancing the peace process. The U.S. secretary's visit comes 
after a lengthy halt in the Washington peace talks and in the 
wake of a premeditated Israeli attempt to conceal the peace 
process behind a thick wall of blood and fire. Meanwhile, the 
Israeli rulers stabbed the peace process in the back, undermined 
it, and derailed it from the bases set for it. This has created 
a gloomy and disappointing atmosphere, making it hard to be 
optimistic about the possibility of advancing the peace process 
and extricating it from the difficult situation created by the 
Israeli rulers. 
  Perhaps the phrase advancing the peace process has been 
rendered meaningless. It has been repeated so many times 
without any really positive result. U.S. officials have made 
many journeys between Washington and the region in a mission 
they call advancing the peace process, or helping the parties 
overcome difficulties and return to the negotiating table. This 
is because those officials' tours, visits, and talks have not 
gone beyond a mailman's mission. They have not placed the 
wheels of the peace train on the track to the aspired and set 
objective of a just, comprehensive peace. 
  There is a great difference between the mission of advancing 
the peace process and a mailman's mission. There is a great 
difference between the role of a full partner and impartial 
broker on the one hand and the role of a silent partner ignoring 
Israel's evasion of the objectives of the U.S. initiative and 
disavowal of its bases and frameworks. The full-partner role 
the United States has chosen to play has not led to a change in 
the role played by U.S. officials. Thus, it has been revealed 
that the U.S. partner is a partner only in terms of complaining 
about the halt in the negotiations and about the looming 
difficulties and obstacles. Besides, this partner evades the 
requirements of this partnership, represented by the need to 
call for adopting the bases set for the peace process and 
respecting international legitimacy and its resolutions. 
  Moreover, two days ago, a U.S. official called on the Arabs 
to appease Israel, fully normalize relations with it, to end the 
Arab boycott, and to meet other similar requests previously made 
by the Israeli rulers. This shows Washington absolutely adopts 
the requests of one party, and absolutely ignores the requests 
of the other party. It seems the memory of some Washington 
officials is weak. They do not remember, or rather do not want 
to remember, that the party occupying others' territory is 
Israel, that the party confiscating others' rights is Israel, 
that the party that launched aggressive wars is Israel, that the 
party that defied the resolutions of international legitimacy is 
Israel, and that the party that rejected the bases of the peace 
process and conspired against it is Israel. On the other hand, 
the Arabs have been the victims of the Israeli rulers' 
aggression, expansionist policy, and constant threat of using 
weapons, including weapons of mass destruction. In this case, 
we ask: Who is required to prove their good intentions: The 
Arabs or Israel? The Arabs have accepted UN resolutions and 
cooperated with all international initiatives to establish 
peace. The Arabs did all that in a quest for a just, 
comprehensive peace. No peace can be established and last 
unless it is just and comprehensive. However, others should 
know that the desire for peace cannot lead the Arabs to 
capitulate to the law- breaking Israeli rulers. Nor can it lead 
the Arabs to accepting that dictates are imposed on them, as 
wished by Rabin and those who sympathize with him. [passage 
omitted] 
  However, what happened after the Geneva meeting between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton made many parts of the 
world news media pose a legitimate question about whether the 
U.S. Middle East policy is drawn by the elected U.S. President, 
who has adopted the peace process and its bases and called for a 
just, comprehensive peace, or by other parties who want to 
appease Israel at the expense of the Arabs and their rights, 
justice, peace, and international legitimacy. [passage omitted]

AL-BA'TH comments: Dennis Ross, overall U.S. coordinator of the 
Middle East peace talks, will reportedly come to the region 
shortly to set the stage for a tour by U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher. According to some news reports, Christopher 
will try to work out with the parties a date for resuming the 
stalled talks. 
  The Americans had said that, as far as the peace talks were 
concerned, they had nothing new to offer. Arab and foreign 
media have noted that the Americans are backtracking on previous 
positions and even gradually adopting the Israeli line and 
extending financial and military backing to Tel Aviv. Observers 
around the world observe that the U.S. Administration is now 
pushing Israel in the direction of war rather than peace. 
  The paper urges the United States to take a clear-cut 
position on the mechanism of the peace process. Washington, 
AL-BA'TH adds, is aware that while the Arabs have done all they 
could to help the peace process along Israel continues to 
maneuver and temporize. 
  In the overall pan-Arab interests and given that the Arabs 
cannot afford further breaches as the Oslo accord and what is 
taking place in Muscat and what will take place in Doha, Arab 
parties involved in the peace process should commit themselves 
to whatever their coming coordination session recommends. If 
the Arabs really care about their interests and future, the gaps 
through which Israel is infiltrating the Arab world should be 
sealed, AL-BA'TH asserts. 
  We are right to urge all Arabs to sharpen their awareness of 
what is going on around them and be more alert to what is being 
planned against all of us without exception. It is not as if a 
just and comprehensive peace has been attained; indeed, Israel's 
rejectionist disposition diminishes the chances for such peace, 
AL-BA'TH concludes.

  [Text] Tehran, April 21, IRNA -- Thousands of pupils and 
high school students staged demonstrations outside the U.N. 
office in Tehran Thursday, condemning the silence of the U.N., 
its Security Council and other international bodies on the 
massacre of Muslims in Gorazde. Carrying placards and banners 
in condemnation of the crimes of Serbs, the demonstrators 
chanted slogans such as "Serbs are committing crimes, Washington 
is supporting them" and "Death to the Serbs." They also called 
for resignation of the U.N. Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. 
  The students denounced the biased policies and shameful 
silence of western governments as well as the Security Council's 
negligence towards Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Similar demonstrations were held in front of the U.N. office 
by Iranian university students and in the holy city of Qom by 
ulama Wednesday in protest at the cold-blooded massacre of 
Muslims in Gorazde.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Clinton's Fresh Remarks on </F>
Bosnia"] 
  [Text] The U.S. President, Bill Clinton, addressing a press 
conference yesterday, said: We should force the Serbs to pay a 
high price for spilling blood and continuing their violence in 
Gorazde city. He said: The United States has asked NATO to use 
air power for returning peace and safety to other Bosnian 
regions declared as safehavens, including Gorazde, as had been 
done in the case of Sarajevo. 
  Clinton's fresh remarks have come at time when the United 
Nations and the Western governments have come under fire and 
criticism by the international community for the indifference 
vis-a-vis the Serbs' criminal attacks which led to the fall of 
Gorazde. The United Nations and NATO, which have carried out a 
belated and small-scale attack on two Serbian tanks around 
Gorazde during their so-called military operation involving one 
U.S. F-15 fighter plane after the Serb attacks and before the 
fall of Gorazde, actually gave a green light to the Serbs for 
escalating their attacks and capturing Gorazde. The same 
belated attack gave way to softness toward the Serbs in silence, 
coupled with satisfaction, following the protest lodged by the 
Russian Government which contained a clear threat. 
  Now that the international community is questioning the 
United Nations and the Western governments for their deceitful 
and betraying role in the fall of the 65,000-population city of 
Gorazde, the U.S. President, Bill Clinton, by expressing such 
remarks is trying to bring down the wrath and indignation of the 
world community. This is at time when certain pro-Serb elements 
in the U.S. Administration, such as Senator Joseph Biden, cannot 
hide the happiness they derive from the Serb victory. 
  Joseph Biden, the second influential man in the U.S. 
Democrat 
Party, speaking in the Foreign Relations Committee, had called 
for the whole withdrawal of the UN peacekeeping forces from the 
so-called safehavens, saying that let the Serbs and Muslims 
fight each other since war is the only way to reach a solution. 
In his yesterday's press conference, Clinton also said that the 
United States will step up its efforts for imposing sharper 
sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, the supporter of 
Bosnian Serbs. This is at a time when all the signs and 
evidence speak of the fact that Moscow and Washington have 
launched wide-scale efforts to relax international sanction 
against the confederation of Serbia and Montenegro, seeking the 
consents of some of the Western governments in this regard. 
  It should, therefore, be said that Clinton's new remarks 
stand in contradiction with the performance of his 
administration and that the White House tricks cannot lessen the 
degree of the crime of the United States, which culminated into 
the fall of Gorazde and the perpetuation of the genocide of 
Muslims by the Serbs in Bosnia.

  [Text] Tehran, April 21, IRNA -- Initial investigations 
into a bomb explosion in Tehran on Tuesday show that saboteurs 
infiltrating into Iran from Iraq were behind the blast, an 
informed source told IRNA Thursday. Members of Iraq-based 
terrorist Mujahideen Khalq Organization (MKO) have frequently 
used the bases and facilities put at their disposal by the Iraqi 
regime for carrying out terrorist acts inside Iran. 
  "Some clues have been obtained in connection with the bomb 
explosion at the corner of Sa'di and Enqelab streets (in central 
Tehran)," the source said. 
  Some 13 people were injured and five cars destroyed when a 
percussion bomb went off in rush hours Tuesday. A few hours 
after the bomb blast, the terrorist grouplet in a hasty reaction 
contacted the Italian news agency (ANSA), AFP and ASSOCIATED 
PRESS to deny its involvement in the terrorist act. 
  Over the past month, MKO in 23 radio contacts monitored by 
an 
IRNA office near Iran-Iraq border instructed its members to 
carry out sabotage and arson attacks on Iranian soil.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Saddam's Insane Actions as He </F>
Nears the End"] 
  [Excerpts] Iraqi President Saddam Husayn is nearing the 
end of his rule and this is linked directly to the West's 
support for his opponents. Despite their promises, the Western 
countries refrained -- overtly and disastrously -- from 
supporting the uprising of the deprived people against Saddam, 
thus thwarting its success. If the opponents of the Iraqi 
regime were to seriously help them, Saddam's downfall would be 
very near. 
  Commenting on the 'Id al-Fitr address by Saddam Husayn on 
Iraqi television, GUARDIAN correspondent David Hearst wrote that 
Saddam showed clear signs of weakness and exhaustion which, 
according to one of Saddam's advisers, had never been perceived 
before. This unnamed high-level adviser who has joined the 
enemy camp expressed concern that since Saddam can now see the 
end of his tenure approaching, he may well do something insane 
like his attack on Iran or the occupation of Kuwait. 
  Saddam's demented and heretical actions and his sense of the 
approaching end of his power may motivate him to attack the 
Kurd-inhabited safe havens in the north, the oil-rich southern 
areas of Kuwait, or even sensitive regions, including Saudi 
territory. 
  The first scenario would not prove very beneficial for him, 
because of the aerial and military protection by the Western 
countries for the Kurd-inhabited areas. In the event he attacks 
the southern areas, it is possible that he could use them as a 
lever to gain concessions from the Arab countries of the region, 
Kuwait in particular. [passage omitted] 
  Saddam's personal health and poor morale aside, David Hearst 
believes that the UN embargoes against Iraq have undermined the 
administrative and political setup more than the financial and 
economic sectors, which will eventually result in this country's 
foundations degenerating from within. Saddam Husayn referred to 
the economic embargoes more than any other issue in his 'Id 
al-Fitr address. 
  Saddam had hoped to forge better relations once Clinton was 
in power, considering his hostility to former U.S. President 
George Bush. He also hoped to gain U.S. consent for the 
economic sanctions to be reduced. He has failed in this and has 
been forced to look to Russia, the PRC, and France for trade and 
investments. 
  As a result of the current economic pressure the exchange 
rate of the Iraqi dinar, which is officially three dinars to the 
dollar, rose from 80 dinars to the dollar in the open market 
last year to the present 350-to-one. Even the newspaper BABIL, 
which is run by Saddam's son 'Udayy, has predicted that soon the 
dollar will rise to 500 dinars. 
  On the other hand, more than $7.540 billion is being spent 
by 
the Iraqi government for essential goods and foodstuffs for the 
people, and then doled out in meager rations. Iraq gets $1.25 
billion per annum from illegal and covert exports, which it uses 
mainly to buy weapons and advanced military equipment. It is 
said that Iraq has built up its military capability to 80 
percent of what it was before the occupation of Kuwait. 
  In his report, David Hearst concludes that if the city of 
al-Basrah were to be transformed into a safe haven similar to 
the Kurdish-inhabited areas in northern Iraq, Saddam's rule 
would end much sooner. Referring to the deployment of the 
Presidential Guard to the southern areas of Iraq, Hearst 
predicts that an attack on the south and the Persian Gulf region 
is a possibility which Saddam might insanely embark upon as his 
regime approaches its end.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive interview" with Hans Blix, director of the </F>
International Atomic Energy Agency, by unidentified 
correspondent at Tehran's' Mehrabad airport on 20 April -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. Blix, were any major 
achievements accomplished during your talks with the Iranian 
officials? 
  [Blix] Well, I came here to discuss first of all the 
arrangements of verification under a nuclear-weapon-free zone in 
the Middle East. And of course, Iran was one of the first 
countries in the world to endorse this idea and I think we have 
created more understanding for the techniques and the system of 
verification that the agency offers now and the kind of enhanced 
verification system that would be needed under a zone. So I 
think we have accomplished what we hope to do, to spread better 
knowledge. 
  [Correspondent] A few countries, and Israel in particular, 
have not yet signed the Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Does not 
this refusal to sign the treaty threaten the international and 
regional peace and stability? 
  [Blix] Well, I think the ambition should be that all 
countries which do not have nuclear weapons should join a 
nonproliferation treaty, either the NPT or the Tlatelolco Treaty 
for Latin America. We have seen a great deal of progress in the 
past few years. Argentina and Brazil have joined, South Africa 
has joined the Nonproliferation Treaty, Algeria has declared 
that it will join. 
  [Correspondent] And finally, could you tell us about the 
IAEA's efforts to make a nuclear-free world, sir? 
  [Blix] Well, it would be a little presumptuous to say that 
we 
are sort of instrumental in creating a nuclear-weapon-free 
world, but what I can say is that I think there is reason for a 
great deal of optimism at the present time after the end of the 
Cold War. We have seen how the United States and Russia have 
now agreed to reduce their nuclear arsenals from some 65,000 
warheads to 3,000 each. We can expect that there will be a 
treaty which will prohibit the production of nuclear material 
for weapons purposes and which very likely will lead to all the 
nuclear weapon states and India, Pakistan, and Israel submitting 
all their nuclear installations to agency verification. We can 
expect, perhaps within one year, a complete test ban agreement 
so that new nuclear weapons cannot be even tested underground. 
So there is, and added to that then, the possibility of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. I think that we 
are taking giant steps towards a world, not free from nuclear 
weapons, but at least much freer from it than it is now. And for 
a world really free of nuclear weapons I think we must also 
foresee a much stronger United Nations and a much stronger 
security organization and that will not come about in one year 
or perhaps even 10 years, but will take a longer time. But 
there is ground for a lot of optimism at the present time and of 
course for us in the IAEA, although we are not the negotiating 
parties, the verification of all these agreements will be a very 
important factor. And I think we have acquired a lot of 
experience in the many years of this and we stand ready to take 
on these jobs. 
  [Correspondent] Thanks Dr. Blix for joining the IRIB English 
news.

  [Text] Tehran, April 20, IRNA -- Majles Vice-Speaker Hasan 
Rowhani last night blasted big powers' malicious propaganda on 
the use of atomic energy in Iran. 
  Rowhani made the remark in a meeting with the Director 
General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Hans 
Blix who arrived here Monday on a 4-day visit. 
  Rowhani deplored that countries such as Iran which have 
"excellent and positive cooperation" with the agency and its 
inspectors have repeatedly verified the peaceful use of atomic 
energy, continue to suffer from the propaganda pressures of big 
powers. 
  While, he added, those countries which are neither a member 
of the IAEA nor cooperate with, it have remained immune from the 
pressures. 
  Rowhani said Iran has made investments to use atomic energy 
for peaceful purpose and to develop its technology. 
  Due to the existing political pressures, he said, certain 
countries that own the technology refrain from active 
cooperation with Iran and completion of their projects here. 
  Blix for his part referred to Iran's cooperation with the 
agency and said nuclear disarmament in the Middle East and the 
world was among the goals of the agency. 
  He said the regional countries are expected to have serious 
cooperation in this connection. 
  Blix praised the coopertion of Iranian officials with the 
agency as a sign of their feeling responsibility towards 
peaceful use of nuclear technology.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Mr. Hans Blix, director general of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, is currently in Tehran on a visit 
for holding talks on cooperation between the agency and Iran's 
Atomic Energy Organization. During his visit to Tehran, Mr. 
Hans Blix and his team--besides inspecting Iran's nuclear 
facilities and holding talks with Dr. Reza Amrollahi, head of 
Iran's Atomic Energy Organization--also met with Iran's first 
vice president and foreign minister. 
  Periodic visits of the IAEA experts to nuclear installations 
of its member states take place on a regular basis. For this 
reason the trip of Mr. Hans Blix to Tehran too has pursued the 
same goal. The visit of the IAEA experts to Iran is also 
significant because it gives an opportunity to Iran's officials 
to express the views and to confer on important regional and 
international issues related to nuclear energy. For this 
standpoint, during the meeting of the IAEA chief with Iran's 
first vice president and foreign minister, the country's views 
on the need for the peaceful use of nuclear energy were 
reiterated. 
  The Iranian officials, meanwhile, have not missed mentioning 
the point that--notwithstanding the false propaganda of the 
West, especially the U.S., about Iran's nuclear program--it is 
the Israeli regime's indifference toward observing the principle 
of nuclear nonproliferation that is posing a real threat to 
peace and security in the Middle East. At any rate, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran believes that the peaceful use of nuclear 
energy--which in the modern world has various applications in 
the fields of medicine, industry, and research--should be 
recognized as a natural right of all the world countries and 
that nuclear technology should not be allowed to become a 
political tool for putting pressure against any country. 
  Undoubtedly the responsibility that the world bodies, 
especially the IAEA, have in this connection demands that the 
agency should deal with various countries on equal footings 
insofar as nuclear arms control is concerned. This is essential 
because only then one can speak with greater certainty about the 
various countries' cooperation with the IAEA programs and the 
positive reports of the organization experts about countries, 
including Iran--those having continuing cooperation with the 
agency--can be used in the international community in a 
desirable manner.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Military Confused"] </F>
  [Text] On Thursday, two American helicopters were shot down 
by two American F-15 jets killing 26 American and allied 
personnel in what has been termed a `friendly fire' disaster in 
northern Iraq. 
  The incident raises a question. Had the two American 
helicopters been downed by Iraqi aircraft what would have been 
the consequences? Answer--disastrous. By now, Pentagon would 
have mobilized allied support and once again we would have 
witnessed a display of American military machismo with innocent 
Iraqi citizens being the target of relentless hellfire of the 
allied war machine. 
  Though the blunder has shaken up the whole Clinton 
administration, outwardly it has managed to remain calm and 
unperturbed by issuing the usual, monotonous statements of 
"working as quickly as possible to complete the investigation 
into how the accident happened," and offering the perfunctory 
condolences to the families of the victims. 
  It's only when Americans erroneously kill their compatriots 
or get killed by the enemy that it becomes an eye-opener for 
U.S. policy makers to review their rules of engagements in 
military operations abroad. The rules defining when U.S. forces 
can attack enemies have now been tightened. 
  Last year's missile attack on the Iraqi intelligence 
headquarters in Baghdad over the `Bush kill plot' controversy, 
is still fresh in the mind. President Bill Clinton, just a few 
months in office when he ordered the surprise missile attack, 
was bubbling with confidence. Now after a series of foreign 
policy and military faux pas we see a Clinton deflated and the 
American people demoralized over Washington's foreign policy. 
  Human errors made at the lower levels are a reflection of 
bigger blunders committed by the top brass. The American 
military has become overbearing, insufferable and bumptious just 
like its leadership. Its aggressive attitude towards the 
`enemy'--to kill rather than counter--has made even missions, 
supposedly altruistic, into bungling operations, nullifying 
their very purpose. 
  In this case, even presuming that the helicopters had been 
Iraqi, it would not have justified shooting them down, without 
any provocation. During the three years the allied forces have 
been monitoring the no-fly zone, in northern Iraq, no Iraqi 
aircraft have been sighted as far north in the no-fly zone, as 
the U.S. Blackhawks were. 
  When it comes to firing at the enemy, the normal 
international flight procedures and safety rules are completely 
violated. Nay, they don't exist at all for the American 
military forces. Recall how they downed an Iran Air flight to 
Dubai in July 1988 by "erroneously" identifying it an enemy 
aircraft? And in October 1992, the U.S. aircraft carrier 
Saratoga fired a missile at the Turkish destroyer Muavenet, 
killing five Turks including the captain? 
  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry admits that half a 
dozen 
procedures should have been in place to have prevented the 
latest `friendly fire' tragedy, while General John 
Shalikashvili, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff says the 
F-15 pilots were not required to get clearance before firing 
their missiles at the `enemy'. Which all goes to show that the 
top officials themselves are foggy about the rules governing 
such eventualities.

<F P=106> [Editorial by 'Ali Feyzi: "A Political Taboo"] </F>
  [Text] One of the most revolutionary actions after the 
victory of the Islamic revolution was the severance of relations 
with the United States. However, the fact is that we have not 
yet fully realized the importance of this action. What were the 
intended objectives, implications, dimensions, and extent of 
this action? Does the mere severance of diplomatic relations 
survive in isolation, without its perspective within the overall 
concept of domination? Can this conform to the original 
objectives? The breaking of relations should be viewed in all 
its aspects; diplomatic relations cannot be segregated from 
economic and trade relations. Those who blindly insist on the 
continued severance of diplomatic relations are as ignorant as 
those who are covertly striving to patch them up. They do not 
realize the true significance of severing these relations nor 
that the issue cannot be confined to the political arena, for 
that would be a blatant contradiction of its purpose. Now that 
there are no relations between Iran and the United States there 
are irrefutable signs of increased economic relations. Even 
though in most cases direct economic ties have been obstructed, 
the transactions take place through middlemen. Hence, one must 
view the profits and losses of these indirect deals. 
  If we are realistic, we will clearly see that the goods that 
reach us in these deals already cost 10 to 20 percent more and 
the countries that act as intermediaries also take a cut at our 
expense. The American companies do not seem dissatisfied with 
this state of affairs because their third country partners take 
their share from Iran. In the case of countries such as Turkey, 
which is facing major financial difficulties, these indirect 
U.S.-Iran transactions are extremely favorable. 
  Therefore, contrary to Ayatollah Azeri-Qomi's remarks that 
the murmurings of relations with the United States stem from a 
lack of taste on the part of some officials, these murmurings 
are in fact realities resulting from the absence of a specific 
economic policy. 
  In the current circumstances, no one desires diplomatic 
relations with the United States, which maintains policies 
hostile to the Islamic Revolution. However, those who issue 
licenses to facilitate the entry of American products into the 
country will sooner or later find themselves forced to defend 
the forging of diplomatic relations. We must tell these 
gentlemen clearly: It is not possible to continue advertising 
for Coca Cola and General Electric in the most revolutionary 
newspapers while simultaneously defending the severance of 
diplomatic relations. 
  Such a blatant contradiction is detrimental to our national 
interests. The United States does not dominate solely through 
its embassies all over the world. Coca Cola and General 
Electric are their vanguards, and economic and trade domination 
precedes political domination. Those who have turned a blind 
eye to the uncontrolled entry of American commodities into our 
country will sooner or later have to face the reality that 
political relations will consequently become necessary. Has 
adequate attention been paid to this issue? 
  How will it be possible to profess that we do not want 
relations with the United States when a large part of the 
consumer market is controlled by American companies? A dual 
approach to a phenomenon that is intrinsically unitary will not 
resolve the problem. The Islamic Revolution should adhere to 
the concept of not having relations with the United States, but 
in our opinion, the Iranian consumer market, to which the United 
States fervently wants to return, is more important. 
  A glance at the shelves of the markets that have mushroomed 
since the revolution and have sprung up even in the smallest 
cities will show that the most substandard products from various 
parts of the world can be found in these boutiques [preceding 
word in English]. American goods may not be the most prevalent 
in these shopping centers, but they are certainly no fewer than 
those from other countries. A cultural movement can only reach 
fruition when it does not lose sight of its objectives or 
degenerate into a mere cultural quirk. Have our officials and 
our nation embraced the belief that they should not use American 
goods?! Such claims do not appear logical and the converse is 
clearly evident in our society. 
  The dissemination of information in our society is quite 
rudimentary, but even so, it is quite eloquent even at this 
level. If one were to intensively examine the Iranian-German 
talks on the reimbursement of outstanding sums, one would recall 
how vehemently the United States protested to Germany for not 
coordinating with it on exerting pressure on Iran. The United 
States was unable to answer one German official's justification 
of his government's policy. He attributed the situation to the 
pillaging of Iranian foreign exchange by American companies, and 
we maintained our poised silence in this altercation. 
  At the same time, there were rumors all over the world that 
the United States wanted to increase pressure on Iran and urged 
its allies not to conclude agreements with Iran. Current 
developments -- which our Central Bank is proclaiming with much 
fanfare as a major victory for public consumption -- are in fact 
another trap to make us become so indebted that we will have no 
room left to maneuver. The transformation of short-term loans 
to long-term loans is not an art discovered for the first time 
by the authors of our economic adjustments. 
  In any case, it will not make much difference whether a 
debtor country has relations with the United States or not, or 
continues to remain estranged. For as long as we do not 
approach these issues in an honest and realistic manner, 
vacillations in our foreign policies are inevitable, regardless 
of whether anyone is ready to accept them or not.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Failure for Containment"] </F>
  [Text] If the news going around in recent months are any 
indication, there have been changes, if not drastic ones, taking 
place in Iran's credit rating in international financial circles. 
  The breakthrough came with Germany and Japan, Iran's biggest 
trading partners in the industrial world. The two countries 
agreed in March to provide Iran with some $4.6b [billion] in 
credits, reportedly about half of its outstanding debts. 
According to Iran's Central Bank, an Iranian banking delegation 
signed a $2b deal in Tokyo with a Japanese consortium, preceded 
by another one with Germany, two weeks earlier, for $2.6b. 
  The agreements with the above two countries were soon 
followed by two others with Switzerland and Austria in the 
amount of some one billion dollars. The credits are to be used 
for payment of delayed Iranian letters of credit held by 
businessmen in those two countries. 
  A similar agreement covering an $800m [million] credit line 
was signed with Italy not long ago. And based on announcements 
by the Central Bank governor, discussions are underway for 
similar agreements with Spain, France, Belgium and Netherlands. 
  Economic experts both here in Iran and internationally 
regard 
the above agreements, and the ones likely to follow, as major 
success by Iran. If anything, these credits were instrumental 
in halting the growing value of foreign exchange in the Iranian 
money markets. The understanding with Germany and Japan also 
served as a forerunner and it was as a consequence of the 
agreements with these two trading partners, and their confidence 
in Iran's economic stamina, that other similar agreements with 
European partners followed. 
  The willingness by Germany and Japan, as leading industrial 
countries, to grant credits to Iran means that they are wise and 
pursue independent policies, and that they understand the 
delicacy of the Iranian economic situation. Iran's present 
economic crunch produced as a consequence of low crude oil 
prices, and the war can happen to any country, as it did to both 
Japan and Germany following the WWII. 
  The Clinton administration has taken pride in the fact that 
it does not lack a clear foreign policy towards Iran. Having 
identified Iran as a significant threat to America's interests 
in the Persian Gulf region, the administration has tried to deal 
with those threats by isolating Iran regionally, and by cutting 
it off from the world economic and trading systems. Based on 
this containment policy Washington has made efforts to persuade 
its European allies and those in the industrial world to deny 
Iran access to international capital. 
  In view of Washington's hostile policy towards Iran, the 
agreements by Iran with its credit-extending partners can be 
interpreted in two ways: That the US containment policy towards 
Iran has failed, or realization of the fact that putting 
pressure on Iran would not be in the best long term interests of 
US and Iran's trading partners in the industrial world. 
  Agreements with a host of industrial countries led by 
Germany 
and Japan, US closest allies, cannot be interpreted but that the 
US policy towards Iran has failed. Iran is not a tiny Persian 
Gulf country the US would be able to isolate readily. It is an 
important country geopolitically whether they like it or not. 
And if anything such hostile policies as practiced by the US 
towards Iran, alluded to last Wednesday by the leader of the 
Islamic Republic in his meeting with armed forces officials, can 
only serve make Iran more "radical", if it is any now. [sentence 
as published] It also means the industrial countries would not 
hesitate to follow their own interest if serious conflicts with 
Washington emerge. 
  The US containment policy and its consequent pressure on the 
Iranian economy, the brunt of which would be felt by the 
vulnerable masses, can also make the possibility of any eventual 
reconciliation between the two countries even more difficult and 
distant.

<F P=106> [Political commentary: "An Address to the U.S. Secretary of </F>
State"] 
  [Text] While attending the COCOM [Coordinating Committee 
for Multilateral Export Controls] session in The Hague to 
discuss changing the system for controlling military exports, 
U.S. Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security 
Affairs Lynn Davis said Iran had disrupted world security. 
  She said: In view of the collapse of the Eastern communist 
blocs, the United States and its Western allies must pay greater 
attention to the regulations controlling exports of military and 
other advanced equipment to "rebellious" countries including 
Iran! 
  Who is disrupting world security? Which are the "rebellious" 
countries? These are the questions which plague the minds of 
people around the world. 
  The answer is clear. The United States and the domineering 
powers of the world have drawn specific boundaries for the 
purpose of pillaging the countries of the world. Then they 
declare that whoever does not officially recognize these 
boundaries is disrupting world security and is an rebel! 
  Following the demise of the Soviet Union, with the changed 
political geography, these people congregated at the COCOM 
session in order to identify the rebels and those who disrupt 
world security! 
  It is natural for those who have been constantly seeking to 
gorge themselves for the past century to introduce distinctive 
terminology into the political lexicon. They think that 
whatever they believe in will be officially recognized by all 
the people of the world. 
  The people of the world wish to know: Fifty years ago, a 
handful of terrorists came to what is now occupied Palestine, 
killed the people, made them homeless, and established a 
black-hearted dictatorial government. If they were not rebels, 
what were they?! 
  The people of the world ask: In an African country such as 
Algeria, when a democratic government based on the will of the 
people is formed, why does a sinister coup d'etat have the 
support of international despots, while the leaders of the 
people are thrown into dungeons? 
  The people of the world ask: When Muslims are victorious in 
Turkish municipal elections, why is a crisis desk set up in 
Washington? 
  The people of the world ask: Why do we see in the heartland 
of Europe the most shameful violations of human rights? And the 
Serbs are still continuing their aggression under the auspices 
of the Western powers, so why does no one label them as rebels 
or say they are disrupting world security? 
  The people of the world want to know: When a number of 
oppressed people are offering their morning prayers in the 
auspicious month of Ramadan in the al-Khalil mosque and they are 
gunned down with impunity, who is the rebel and who is 
disrupting world security? 
  If, according to the U.S. under secretary for arms control 
and international security affairs, the volume of advanced 
military equipment is the criterion, and its production and 
exports should be controlled, then the United States, Britain, 
France, and others who have the largest nuclear arsenals should 
be declared the greatest threat to world security and the most 
notorious of international rebels.

  [Text] Colonel Mustafa al-Karrubi, member of the Libyan 
leadership council, was received today by President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani, to whom he presented a written message from 
the Libyan leader, Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi. 
  Conveying Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's warm greetings to our 
country's president, Mr. Karrubi said the aim of his trip to 
Iran is to find ways of deepening fraternal relations between 
Iran and Libya and to activate the joint commission in order to 
increase the volume of economic and trade exchanges between the 
two countries. 
  He reported on the political and economic situation in Libya 
and said: The political and economic sanctions imposed on Libya 
by some Western countries are unjust and violate international 
law. 
  For his part, Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed gratitude for the 
Libyan leader's friendly message. He said relations and 
cooperation between the two countries is at a good level and 
emphasized the need to expand them. 
  Referring to the political and economic pressure of world 
arrogance against independence-seeking countries, the president 
said the path of independence and refusal to surrender to the 
bullying which dominates the international order is filled with 
difficulties but leads to desirable results. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani also emphasized the need for a peaceful 
and just solution, through international organizations, to the 
existing differences between Libya and some Western countries.

  [Text] Tabriz, E. Azerbaijan, April 21, IRNA -- Volume of 
Trade exchanges between Iran and Australia reached dlrs. 
[dollars] 400 million last year, Australian Ambassador to Tehran 
Nicolas Warner told IRNA here Wednesday [20 April]. 
  Warner said during the period Iran's non-oil exports to 
Australia stood at dlrs. 25 million, up by 40 percent as 
compared with the amount of the preceding year. The exported 
commodities mainly included dried fruit and carpet, he added. 
  Australia has made some efforts to reduce the negative 
balance in the two countries' trade exchanges through organizing 
trade fairs and seminars for the Iranian exporters in several 
Australian cities. 
  Noting that Iran mainly imported wheat, meat and 
telecommunication equipment from Australia, Warner said his 
country had allocated dlrs. 750 million in credit for the 
Iranian importers in an effort to further consolidate mutual 
industrial and trade cooperation. 
  The ambassador visited this northwestern Iranian city to 
explore the grounds for the promotion of commercial cooperation 
between the provincial units and country.

  [Text] Tehran, April 21, IRNA -- A morning English daily 
here Thursday [21 April] pointed to the escalated attacks by the 
Hamas freedom movement against the Zionists in recent weeks and 
said that Israel should face up to the fact that Hamas is a 
Palestinian reality which aims to blow up the Gaza-Jericho 
"Trojan horse." 
  The only success of the Gaza-Jericho accord is that it has 
changed the nature of the 46 years of anti-Zionist struggle from 
demanding total independence to seeking partial autonomy, said 
the `TEHRAN TIMES' in its editorial. It noted that the armed 
struggle against Israel by Hamas was the result of the world 
community's inability and unwillingness to end the illegal 
presence of Zionists in Palestine. Armed attacks of Hamas are a 
natural and justified reaction to Israel's intransigence, said 
the paper, adding that the Zionists had showen repeatedly that 
the only language they understand "comes from the barrel of a 
gun." 
  The basic stand of Hamas stemed from religious beliefs, and 
war was not considered sacred to Hamas, but was used as a means 
to achieve an end, it noted. 
  The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) "can give away 
the rights of its followers by signing the Gaza-Jericho accord. 
But, by the same token, Hamas has as much right to choose the 
path of its struggle against the Zionist occupiers," it said. 
The daily concluded by saying that Palestinians desired justice 
more than they need peace and Hamas held the view that peace 
without reinstatement of full Palestinians rights, was not 
preferable to war.

<F P=106> [From the "Weekly Political Newsletter" by Dr. Mohammad </F>
Javad Larijani, Tehran Majles deputy and head of the Islamic 
Majles Foreign Affairs Committee: "Stupidity"] 
  [Text] 1. Two important issues were discussed at the 
recent meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] foreign 
ministers. One was how Israel would be permitted entry into the 
region, and the other was what policy these countries would 
adopt toward Iraq. It is interesting to note that the two 
issues are ultimately interrelated! 
  2. The United States is closely following the issue of 
Israel's entry into the region and Israel is also awaiting the 
decision impatiently. During the course of the current talks, 
Israel will only take steps to help it make major gains toward 
an extensive presence in the Arab (and Islamic) world, 
especially in the Persian Gulf region! 
  3. Why should Israel enter the Persian Gulf region? It is 
obvious that the various parties involved would supply different 
answers to this question. For Israel, it is an opening to the 
Arab and Islamic world, in addition to the immense oil 
resources. The people in these regional countries have not 
evolved any cohesive national identity; they are merely 
naturalized in those countries, which were born from the unclean 
womb of British colonialism. Even today, their affairs are 
directed by other hands. This is why entry into this region is 
easier than into Egypt, Syria, Algeria, or similar countries. 
  It was a great achievement for the United States to keep the 
current regime in Iraq in the present disgraceful circumstances. 
Every time the U.S. wishes to intimidate the regional rulers and 
to shovel in their wealth, it just smiles in the direction of 
the Iraqi regime and this immediately instills fear in the 
regional rulers and gives them nightmares. The statement issued 
at the latest GCC foreign ministers' session in Riyadh clearly 
shows their psychological state. 
  In other words, what has transpired in Iraq has not only 
destroyed the longstanding prestige and sovereignty of that 
country, but has also dragged the entire Arab region of the 
Persian Gulf into the jaws of the United States. 
  4. This fragile status quo is fraught with danger, and it 
can very easily get out of control, as in Somalia. Therefore, 
the Zionists are to be brought in in order to help stabilize 
conditions in the region. In other words, the Zionist element 
will have to do the following: 
  First: Prevent all ties between the regional Arab countries 
and Iran. 
  Second: Keep a watchful eye on conditions in Iraq and 
escalate dangerous crises! 
  Third: Plan and direct changes in the regional governments, 
particularly in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab 
Emirates. 
  In my view, this is the minimum that the United States 
expects from Israel. It is obvious that extensive benefits from 
generous "pockets" and unlimited resources of the region will 
accrue to the United States. 
  5. What is the outlook for the future? The Islamic world 
will never accept the Zionist entity. Even if this element is 
forcibly thrust down its throat today, it will be spat out even 
more forcefully tomorrow or in the near future! This trend can 
be easily perceived in the nexus of the deep and extensive 
social and political events currently taking place in the 
Islamic world. 
  If our friends in the Persian Gulf littoral countries are 
prudent and rely on expediency instead of being willful, they 
will realize that paving the way for Israel's ingress into the 
region would be tantamount to striking at their own roots! They 
will not only be consigning the region's resources to 
destruction but their own existence as well! Why have you let 
Zionism dominate the House of God and now strive to pave the way 
further? Regardless of religious considerations, have you even 
thought about preserving your own power?

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Saudi Arabia--a </F>
Danger-Generating Center in the Persian Gulf"] 
  [Text] The news organizations affiliated with Saudi Arabia 
have once again postponed any decision to improve relations with 
Iran and to resolve differences between Abu Dhabi and Iran. 
These organizations, which are mostly under the influence of 
Zionist groups, have once again propounded the perpetual claims 
of the United States and the Zionist regime based on Iran's 
military presence in the strategic regions of the Persian Gulf. 
These claims have been made repeatedly by Western and Zionist 
circles. 
  Despite such claims, Iran has always been in favor of an 
amicable settlement of its differences with its southern 
neighbors, including the United Arab Emirates. 
Goodneighborliness, assistance in adopting a regional policy, 
and the elimination of the danger of domination by foreigners 
are integral and strategic parts of Iran's policy, which is 
being misconstrued by the United States as a lessening of its 
vital interests. 
  In addition to these claims, what contributes to major 
dangers in the Persian Gulf is the presence of deep-rooted 
territorial disputes among the regional Arab countries, which 
stem from their thirst for power, affiliation with arrogant 
powers of the world, and the influence of these arrogant powers. 
Conspicuous examples are Iraq's attack on Iran and later on 
Kuwait. The Persian Gulf region has been transformed into a 
potential center of tension because of Saudi Arabia's extensive 
dependence on the anti-Islamic and antipopular policies of the 
United States. 
  It is under these circumstances that Saudi Arabia has 
embarked on expanding these baseless claims and exacerbating the 
territorial claims that are exactly what the enemies of the 
region and Islam want. 
  According to political experts, countries that strive to 
preserve flash points and expand baseless territorial claims are 
most certainly acting against their own interests. The 
proliferation of artificial crises in the sensitive region of 
the Persian Gulf is the long-term strategy of the greater 
powers, the United States in particular, who wants to 
consolidate its position on this basis. By implementing this 
divisive strategy, the West has managed to transform a 
potentially dangerous union of these countries--which would be 
opposed to Western interests--into a subtle hostility against 
one another. 
  By creating doubts and apprehension among the regional 
countries, the United States is seeking the necessary pretexts 
for its greater presence and more overt interference, which is 
against the interests of countries in the region. This has been 
made possible by the servile Saudi rulers, who are now accusing 
Iran to justify their own actions. It is by realizing this 
tangible fact that Iran should adopt a strategic policy to 
expose these suspicious and dangerous moves and should refrain 
from needlessly pandering to the power- seeking Saudi rulers. 
Unfortunately, we have not developed a clear course of action 
regarding Saudi Arabia's political, discord-generating moves and 
this has resulted in making the Saudi rulers more audacious and 
arrogant than ever before.

  [Text] Monetary and banking regulations for the country's 
free trade zones have been approved, and the import of goods 
that are not illegal will be free without any limitations in the 
free trade zones. This was stated by Alviri, secretary of the 
Supreme Council for Free Trade and Industrial Zones, in an 
exclusive interview with our correspondent. Alviri added: The 
import of goods from the free trade zones to other parts of the 
country will be subject to import-export regulations. 
  He described the monetary and banking regulations that were 
approved by the Supreme Council for Free Trade and Industrial 
Zones yesterday as one of the most important procedural 
regulations of the law on free trade zones. He said: Domestic 
banks as well as domestic and foreign credit establishments can 
be either set or open branches in these zones, while foreign 
banks can only have branches in these zones. 
  The secretary of the Supreme Council for Free Trade and 
Industrial Zones also stated that the Iranian banks should have 
an initial capital of at least 5 billion rials, while foreign 
credit establishments should have at least $4 million to be 
established in these zones. Alviri added: Domestic banks and 
branches of foreign banks can carry out off-shore banking 
activities, which are solely foreign exchange transactions and 
will be exempt from the regulations and laws that apply inside 
the country. 
  Alviri added: The banks in the free trade zones should 
clarify their situation within a period of six months or conform 
their articles of association with the banking and monetary 
regulations that apply to these regions. Commenting on the 
foreign exchange system that will apply in these areas, he said: 
  [Begin Alviri recording] Another noteworthy point is the 
existence of a single-parity rate in the free trade zone. This 
means that we will not have one rate announced by the Central 
Bank and another rate that is the free market rate. There will 
be a single parity rate system. In other words, the foreign 
exchange market in the free trade zones will adjust its rate on 
the basis of supply and demand. This will be the official rate 
inside the free trade zones and the basis on which all the banks 
will carry out their transactions. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Arms Self-Sufficiency"] </F>
  [Text] Since the victory of the Islamic Revolution in 1979, 
the superpowers have incessantly mobilized all their resources 
to weaken and eventually, if possible, to help topple the 
newly-born regime in Iran. 
  At first they used their local agents to disturb the peace 
and tranquility in every corner of this country from Kordestan 
to Gorgan and Khuzestan. Unable to use ethnic differences to 
have them fight against one another because of their Islamic 
sense of brotherhood and equality principle, in which all Muslim 
Iranians believe regardless of their ethnic backgrounds, the 
arrogant powers decided to arm to the teeth the Iraqi army for 
their malicious purposes. 
  Despite the support provided by the West and the former East 
as well as all the rich Arab shaykhdoms of the Persian Gulf, the 
Iraqi regime failed to accomplish its mission. Eight years of 
sacred defense and self-sacrifice by the Iranian combatants, 
foiled the efforts of superpowers to overthrow the Islamic 
regime. 
  Although their plots have been futile so far, however, the 
arrogant powers' conspiracies have not ended and it does not 
seem they will give up any time soon. Indeed, as the leader of 
the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khamene'i, said in his 
Wednesday meeting with the commanders of the Army, Navy and the 
Air Force, the Iranian armed forces should be alert and 
vigilant, because the enemy is "wounded and dangerous". 
  If in 1980 Iraq's excuse for imposing war on Iran was its 
sovereignty claim over Arvand River, who knows, may be one day 
the arrogant powers decide to use the issue of the three Persian 
Gulf islands as an excuse to meddle in the internal affairs of 
the region's countries. 
  The Iraqi-imposed war taught us a lesson to remember. We 
must break the chains of dependency on all fields, in 
particular, in as far as the military technology and training 
are concerned. While the former regime's armed forces heavily 
depended on American and British military advisers and hardware, 
the Islamic Republic Armed Forces are working to become 
self-sufficient in all terms possible. 
  The Iranian news agency IRNA reported Friday that an Iranian 
manufactured tank named Iran Leopard was combat-tested by the 
Self-Sufficiency Jehad Department of the armed forces. The tank 
has been designed in such a way so as to have more maneuvering 
power than those employed by other countries' and costs one 
third its foreign-made counterpart. The good news came at the 
time that the Iranian armed forces are preparing to celebrate 
the Army Day (Monday April 18.) 
  While other countries of the Middle East depend on foreign 
military technology, Iranian armed forces, are doing their best 
to design and manufacture a tank suitable for the country's 
terrain and weather conditions. This is not only a big 
achievement but also a major step forward toward improving 
Iran's defense capabilities.

  [Text] General Sakhi, known as Sakhi Broot, a militia 
general, was killed by Golboddin's militia in Dasht-e Saqawa 
south of Kabul in Logar Province. Security sources reported to 
BIA's correspondent that this professional criminal some days 
ago fought Golboddin's militia over looted goods; as a result of 
which he was killed along with his three bodyguards. The 
general's body still lies in Dasht-e Saqawa and is decomposing. 
No one has come to remove his body. Sakhi Broot some time ago 
stole the carpets of Sayed Abdolqader Jaylani mosque in Sayd Nur 
Mohammad Shah Mena, killed an innocent shepherd in the same 
area, and divided up his sheep among the militia. He was a 
notorious Dostum general and had a hand in many crimes.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Afghan President Sebghatollah </F>
Mojaddedi by Salih Qallab in Peshawar; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Qallab] Do you deal with 
Rabbani now on the basis that he is the president of Afghanistan 
or the leader of an armed faction? 
  [Mojaddedi] I do not deal with Rabbani at all, nor do I 
recognize the government as a legitimate government. 
  When Nawaz Sharif was prime minister of Pakistan, he made 
his 
well-known initiative. So we, representatives of all Afghan 
organizations, met and secured a solution. Then we went to holy 
Mecca and swore on the Koran that we would implement it. Then 
we went to Tehran. When I signed the agreement, I made it a 
condition that Rabbani's presidential term should not last more 
than four months. And I said that legislative elections should 
be held. But Rabbani has abandoned all these obligations and 
imposed himself as president for all this time through his 
organization only and against the will of all the other Afghan 
factions. 
  I would like to say once again that Rabbani's government is 
illegitimate, I do not recognize it, and I cannot deal with it. 
Rabbani tried to offer the organization I lead two ministerial 
posts in his present cabinet but I turned down the offer. 
  [Qallab] If Rabbani's term ends in two and a half months and 
he does not resign, what will happen? 
  [Mojaddedi] There is nothing except war; there is a war 
raging now, and it will continue. 
  [Qallab] There is a cease-fire in Kabul at present? 
  [Mojaddedi] It lasts for an hour or two, a day or two -- 
which is futile. The cease-fire was agreed in Kabul but the war 
has continued in many other provinces. 
  [Qallab] It is clear that Rabbani will not resign, nor will 
Ahmad Shah Mas'ud. So what are you going to do? 
  [Mojaddedi] The war will continue. 
  [Qallab] For how long? 
  [Mojaddedi] Until they are forced to relinquish power. I 
tell you here that they cannot last long, as they are in a weak 
position. They have been moved out completely from the northern 
provinces of the country. They have been eliminated completely. 
Therefore, if they are moved out of the part they control at the 
moment, they will be finished completely. [passage omitted] 
  [Qallab] Whom does Iran support in this war? 
  [Mojaddedi] Iran supports no one. If it supports anyone, it 
will support the Shiite group (al-Wahdah Party). These people 
are poor people and facing numerous problems. 
  [Qallab] Is there any thought of widening the alliance 
between Abdul Rashid Dostam and Hekmatyar? 
  [Mojaddedi] As far as I am concerned, I am in this alliance. 
There is a shura council for these people, and the organization 
I lead is represented in this council. And I support their 
moves. 
  [Qallab] Abdul Rashid Dostam was minister in Najibullah's 
government, so why do you ally yourself with parties that were 
communist? 
  [Mojaddedi] That is wrong. Dostam was in Najibullah's 
government, but he discovered the truth and separated from and 
turned against it. Had it not been for Dostam's stance against 
that government, it would not have been possible to topple it, 
and it would have stayed for 10 more years. [passage omitted] 
  [Qallab] It is said that a large number of "Afghan Arabs" 
have moved to Afghanistan, where they are now in camps to 
rehabilitate them and send them to the Arab countries to create 
conditions like those in Algeria and Egypt. Is that true? 
  [Mojaddedi] That is an issue in which we are very 
interested. In fact, we are embarrassed when anyone asks us 
about it. Because over 15 years -- even though the Soviet 
aggression was very clear -- none of the Afghan factions 
committed any action against diplomatic missions abroad. We did 
not try to bomb any Soviet embassy. Nor did we try to 
assassinate any Soviet ambassador. We fought the Soviet Army 
occupying our country. But we did not commit any terrorist 
operation. 
  Regrettably, immediately after the victory of the Afghan 
revolution some brothers -- and they are known -- opened camps 
for Arab volunteers, trained them, and then sent them back to 
their original country to carry out acts like those you talk 
about, like what is happening in Egypt and Algeria. I saw some 
of these camps with my own eyes. And there are still camps on 
which millions are spent in order to launch terrorist operations 
against Arab and Islamic states. [passage omitted] 
  [Qallab] What is your opinion of what is happening in 
Algeria and Egypt? 
  [Mojaddedi] I said that we do not interfere in others' 
internal affairs. I am against killing innocent people. It has 
nothing to do with Islam at all. I believe the proper thing is 
to focus on the Islamic call [al-da'wah al-islamiyah]. 
  [Qallab] That means that you are against violence in Algeria 
and Egypt? 
  [Mojaddedi] Yes, I am against violence. People should use 
logic and persuasion, not explosives.

Romesh Bhandari, visited the repatriated Chakma refugees at 
Ramgarh in the Khagrachari Hill District Wednesday morning. The 
governor saw for himself the resettlement process and expressed 
his satisfaction. Talking to the refugees, who have been 
resettled after their repatriation from Tripura, he urged them 
to (?persuade) the remaining Chakma refugees now in Tripura to 
return to their homes in Bangladesh and enjoy the facilities 
given by the Bangladesh Government for their resettlement in the 
hill tracts. 
  On his arrival at Ramgarh from Dhaka in the morning, Mr. 
Bhandari was taken to the local Circuit House. The governor met 
the Chakma refugees there and inquired about their resettlement. 
Earlier, high officials briefed the visiting governor of the 
steps taken by the government for the returnees. The chairman 
of the Chakma Refugees Rehabilitation Committee also [words 
indistinct]. Reports say Mr. Bhandari left for Dighinala and 
(Banchori) to see the condition of the resettled Chakma refugees 
there.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "GATT's Patent Proposals May Spell Doom For </F>
Third World Farmers"] 
  [Text] Although, in principle, we have always come out on 
the side of copyright and patent holders, the new GATT patent 
proposals may mean that farmers will not be allowed to plant 
seed unless they paid royalties to one of the patent holding 
companies. By extending patenting laws to the Third World it 
means that companies can control and market crop varieties in 
countries which may have donated the genetic material used to 
breed those varieties. Most of the raw materials for the 
high-yielding seed that is developed in the laboratories of 
Western companies comes from Third World fields but the irony of 
it all is that farmers who have received no reward for parting 
with the raw material that makes manipulation of genes possible, 
may be asked to pay royalties for their use. The UN 
International Trade Commission has estimated that U.S. 
companies, in all sectors, stand to gain USD 61 billion a year 
from developing countries in royalty payments -- if GATT's 
proposed patents regime is approved. 
  At present, Indian law, for example, does not allow 
agricultural and medicinal products to be patented, but all this 
may soon have to change, if the GATT draft is approved by the 
Indian government. But, as multinational seed companies see 
farmer's rights to their own seeds as an obstacle to company 
marketing expansion, they fully expect that, under the GATT 
regulations, India will be forced to introduce such patents, or 
face retaliatory trade measures. 
  But Indian farmers are seen to be fighting back, for they 
have been staging a number of dramatic protests against GATT's 
proposed patenting measures. In August, 1993, for example, 
40,000 farmers carrying neem branches as the symbol of their 
collective indigenous knowledge, demonstrated in the Southern 
Indian state of Karnataka and, in October of the same year, they 
launched the Third World Farmers' Movement Against Transnational 
Corporations at a rally attended by over a million farmers. 
Northern environmentalists are giving all-out support to their 
struggle. 
  W.R. Grace and Co., one of the largest U.S. chemical 
companies, and Cargill, which controls 60 percent of the world 
trade in cereals, are under attack by Indian farmers for the 
threat they represent to their livelihoods. Grace is accused of 
infringing the intellectual property rights of millions of 
Indian peasants by taking out U.S. patents on pesticide products 
derived from the neem tree which has been used in India for 
centuries for a range of medicinal and agricultural purposes. 
Cargill is setting up a hybrid seed-processing complex in 
Karnataka, and has been singled out as one company which would 
flood the Indian market. 
  Third World farmers' groups argue that such a monopoly 
system 
of patents, combined with open access to markets, would only be 
of benefit to large corporate concerns and, in return, the Third 
World will get nothing for the knowledge which led to the 
development of patented products. Indian farmers are, 
therefore, protesting this and are proposing, instead, 
collective patents as an alternative form of intellectual 
property rights which would reward communities for their 
traditional knowledge of the uses of plants and animals. 
  With the recent instruction to grow neem trees in 
Bangladesh, 
a tree which has always been native to this part of the world, 
it would be more than a pity should people find that, after 
planting the trees, they discover their produce has already been 
patented by multi-national companies based in foreign countries 
and, as their intellectual property, we shall also have to pay 
royalties for their use.

  [Text] The commerce minister has refuted the opposition's 
allegation that the government has compromised on the 
sovereignty of the nation by signing the GATT agreement at 
Marrakesh. 
  Giving clarifications on the statements regarding the 
Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations in Rajya Sabha 
today, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee asserted that the interest of the 
farmers and workers will not be affected by this treaty. Not 
satisfied with his clarification, almost the entire opposition 
staged a walkout, alleging that the government has bartered away 
the interests of the nation by signing the treaty. 
  Refuting the charges of the opposition that most of the 
foreign investment has come into the consumer sector, he said 90 
percent of the investment has been made into the core sector. 
Denying the charges that the center did not consult the chief

<F P=106> [Commentary by Anjan Ray] </F>
  [Text] India's decision to resume bilateral talks with the 
United States on opening up the textiles market augurs optimism 
for higher trade. The U.S. announcement on withdrawal of all 
restrictions on imports of hand loom exports from India is a 
major gain for India. India on the other hand has agreed to 
dilute tariff barriers to entry of high-valued U.S. textile 
exports which will go a long way to meeting the American 
sensibilities about the textile trade. For even now, the 
textiles industry is a major source of employment generation in 
that country. In view of the importance of textiles for 
employment of U.S. labor, the United States had for the last 
decade been insisting on more gradual phasing out of the 
controversial Multi-Fiber Agreement -- MFA -- which tended to 
depress imports of textile items into the world's largest 
economy. 
  The MFA had imposed some arbitrary quotas on textiles 
exports 
from the manufacturing countries which India had always 
maintained was the subtraction from the rule-based trading 
regime. MFA is now proposed to be phased out in 10 years. 
Although the details of India's opening up of the textiles 
market to the United States has yet to be worked out, in a sense 
this should be of considerable importance. Currently Indian 
tariff on textile imports is around 85 percent and there are 
some quantitative restrictions besides. Under the commitment 
given now, India will be obliged to bring down the tariff rates 
and remove some of the quantitative restrictions. The areas of 
restrictions will to a large extent determine the possible 
volume of imports from the United States. The withdrawal of 
U.S. restrictions on Indian hand loom imports should certainly 
mean a major step up in activities in some segments of Indian 
hand loom industry. The textiles industry as a whole employs 
about 15 millions in India. The synthetic textile industry is 
capital intensive and, therefore, the employment generation in 
this sector is limited. On the other hand, rough and ready 
estimates indicate that the hand loom sector employs no less 
than 8 to 10 million workers and any increase in exports could 
bring about a significant improvement in their economic 
situation. Indeed, the cotton sector alone is expected to be 
the biggest beneficiary of any increase in exports since it is 
this item that accounts for nearly of the hand loom sector's 
exports. However, the bilateral concession to India on textiles 
is a just a windfall profit and demonstrates the negotiation 
skills of a team which had gone to Marrakesh for signing the 
agreement on completion of the Uruguay round. 
  There are some major differences with the United States over 
the general stand Washington has taken on multilateral issues 
relating to the new order. The United States had been in the 
vanguard of those developed countries which had demanded linking 
of social policy issues with trade policy. In effect, these 
countries are demanding that the labor standards, particularly 
the wage levels in the developing countries, should be taken 
into account in deciding the framework for conducting 
international trade. If these developed countries succeed, this 
would virtually take away the comparative advantage of the 
developing countries in the form of lower wages. The United 
States is advancing all this concern for labor in the name of 
raising standards of living in all countries. Its effect could 
be quite the contrary. The activist policies followed by the 
United States to shut out imports selectively from different 
countries, which it dislikes on some grounds or other, had been 
noticed even by many of the developed countries. In fact, the 
ministerial declaration on the accession to the Dunkel final act 
is carrying an exhortation to the effect that no signatory 
should take unilateral action which could jeopardize the flow of 
trade among the nations. This has obviously been introduced to 
discourage countries like the United States from using trade 
restrictive measures under its various omnibus legislations like 
Super 301 or Special 301 between now and the formation of the 
World Trade Organization.

regret over the distorted projection by Islamabad, an External 
Affairs Ministry spokesman clarified in New Delhi that it is 
neither a group of ambassadors of Islamic countries nor is it in 
the nature of any fact-finding mission.

  [Text] Pakistan has called upon the UN Security Council to 
act quickly to save the victims of Serbian genocide and 
immediate withdrawal of Serbian forces from Gorazde. 
  In an urgent message sent to the UN Secretary General, Dr. 
Butrus Ghali, today from Bonn, the prime minister, Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto, said the agony of Gorazde is infinitely worsening the 
sufferings in Sarajevo. She said we share the anger and despair 
of the Bosnian leadership after the apathy of the UN on the 
world community. She hoped the Security Council will quickly 
approve Pakistan's resolution demanding air strikes against the 
Serbian artillery and withdrawal of Serbian forces from Gorazde. 
The Council must act quickly, she emphasized. 
  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said the world community must 
wake up to the warning bell sounded by the vicious war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. She said Pakistan feels strongly that 
maintaining the unjust arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina 
means to assuming a share in the responsibility for the plight 
of the defenseless people. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said to allow the 
Serbs to succeed in Gorazde will severely and perhaps 
irretrievably erode the credibility of the United Nations and 
compromise its vision of collective security. She said it will 
represent a leap backwards to the law of force and away from our 
aspirations for a world ruled by the forces of law.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto by Wolfgang </F>
Koydl in Germany; date not given: "Our Only Security Is Nuclear 
Technology"] 
  [Text] [Bhutto] The last time I was in Germany was 28 
years ago. However, despite the Wall, the Cold War, and the 
bipolar world I realized even at that time that Germany was a 
country with industrious people who work hard, and would, 
therefore, emerge as an important factor in the world at some 
time. I see that this is happening now. I have come to Germany 
to discuss the international situation with the chancellor, with 
a particular focus on Kashmir and Bosnia. In addition, I talked 
with him about closer cooperation in the field of 
industrialization. I explained the overall situation to him, 
because Pakistan has an agreement with the IMF and the World 
Bank and has now embarked upon a solid economic path. In this 
connection, I expressed my interest in Hermes guarantees to the 
chancellor. You see, German companies have invested so much in 
Russia -- without success. Now they should invest in Pakistan 
-- with far more success. The World Bank has called Pakistan 
one of the seven most important capital markets of the future, 
and there are enormous possibilities, in particular in the 
fields of energy and communications. 
  [Koydl] Let us come to Bosnia. A few weeks ago you visited 
Sarajevo together with your Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller. 
  [Bhutto] The most important thing is to lift the arms 
embargo against the Muslims as soon as possible. For me the 
issue is not so much that Muslims are being killed in Bosnia, 
even though I, personally, find that very painful. Rather, the 
issue is that people are dying there. Above all, it needs to be 
made clear that aggression does not pay off, that the aggression 
of the Serbs does not pay off. Therefore, the embargo against 
Bosnia must be lifted. 
  [Koydl] Regarding a more intensive involvement by German 
industry in Pakistan, one precondition would be that Pakistan 
release more money for civilian development. So far, your 
country has had to spend about 70 percent of its budget on 
national security. One reason for that is the conflict with 
India over Kashmir. 
  [Bhutto] This is correct. One of the reasons why Germany 
was able to grow was that others took care of its security 
needs. We have to do that ourselves. We have waged three wars, 
our country was divided -- eastern Pakistan turned into 
Bangladesh -- all because of Indian aggression. India is our 
neighbor, and because India does not get on well with any of its 
neighboring states, we have had to spend more than we wanted on 
our defense. Therefore, we have suggested to India talks on 
various topics -- from Kashmir to the nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons to missile systems and balanced troop reduction. 
Unfortunately, the entire matter has ended in a stalemate 
because India refuses to discuss seriously the problem of 
Kashmir. 
  [Koydl] In the United States opinion seems to be changing 
regarding the issue of Kashmir. Does the United States not 
support Pakistan's position now? 
  [Bhutto] I do not see this as a change in opinion. The 
United States just describes the legal situation correctly when 
it calls Kashmir a disputed territory. The area is still 
disputed because India has so far prevented the implementation 
of the UN Resolution demanding a referendum for Jammu and 
Kashmir. However, I do not share the view of other states that 
urge us toward a bilateral solution with India. Bilateral talks 
have not shown any results for more than 40 years. Therefore, 
we believe that we should now try multilateral paths or 
mediation by a third party. 
  [Koydl] Who could act as a mediator? 
  [Bhutto] We would be pleased if the United States were to 
act as a mediator. However, we would also be pleased if Germany 
played this role. Any country that has good relations with 
India and Pakistan could take over the role of honest broker. 
  [Koydl] Did you broach potential mediation by Germany in 
your talks with Chancellor Kohl? 
  [Bhutto] The chancellor was very worried about the situation 
on the subcontinent. However, I do not want to give any 
details; it is the business of my foreign minister to present 
this in appropriate diplomatic language. 
  [Koydl] The United States also seems to have given in 
regarding the supply of F-16 combat planes to Pakistan, the 
delivery of which was stopped because of the Pakistani nuclear 
program. 
  [Bhutto] It would be precipitate to speak of giving in. The 
situation is extremely complicated. We can say this much: 
There was a dialogue with the United States, which was supposed 
to sound out how we could improve bilateral relations. We see 
these F-16's as part of a purchasing contract. We paid for 
them. Therefore, we either want the planes or our money back. 
However, the delivery was suspended by a law adopted by 
Congress that prohibits any aid to Pakistan. Therefore, it will 
not be easy to find a way out. However, we believe that the 
Clinton administration is tackling the problem of nuclear 
nonproliferation in a more balanced manner. This administration 
is advocating the reduction and elimination of these weapons at 
the regional level, without picking out just Pakistan. This 
change is to be welcomed. 
  [Koydl] The reason for the problems with the United States 
is the Pakistani nuclear program. Last year your predecessor 
Nawaz Sharif told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: "We do not have any 
nuclear bomb, nor will we build one." Is this statement still 
correct? 
  [Bhutto] Let me put it this way: We could have had a 
nuclear weapon, but we decided against it. It is quite 
different whether one does not have nuclear weapons because one 
cannot build them or whether one does not have any even though 
one could build them. We do not have any nuclear weapons 
because Pakistan is generally committed to a policy of 
nonproliferation. And even though India has detonated a bomb, 
Pakistan has shown enormous restraint by not carrying out a 
nuclear test, not exporting any technology, and not producing 
any fissionable material. We believe that Pakistan's sensible 
and peace-loving attitude in this matter should be recognized 
and rewarded. It is also extremely important for peace and 
security in the world that this is recognized and rewarded. 
  [Koydl] During your visit to North Korea last December you 
defended each nation's right to nuclear technology. 
  [Bhutto] The purpose of my visit to North Korea was not to 
discuss nuclear proliferation or nonproliferation. I visited 
North Korea, which Pakistan has had relations with for a long 
time, because I was in China and, therefore, it was simpler from 
the logistical point of view, to go to North Korea at that time 
than at another time. We discussed many different material 
issues, such as cheap housing construction, but not the 
proliferation of nuclear technology. 
  [Koydl] But your words that any nation has a right to 
nuclear technology were quoted most often. 
  [Bhutto] I am indeed of the opinion that any nation has a 
right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, absolutely. 
I have been someone who is aware of the environment since my 
time as a student. At that time I collected old newspapers and 
recycled them. In particular because I am convinced that the 
treasures of nature must be preserved, I also think that nuclear 
technology, which is clean and environmentally compatible, must 
provide us with electricity. On the other hand, I am strictly 
in favor of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, 
and, therefore, I would like to see a balanced regional 
solution. Pakistan cannot take any unilateral steps on the 
subcontinent, because we have had three wars in the past. It is 
difficult for Pakistan to keep pace with conventional armament 
in India. Therefore, our only security and our only guarantee 
is the nuclear technology that we have acquired -- even if we 
have not developed it to the point to which we could develop it 
and do not intend to do so -- unless our survival were at stake. 
  [Koydl] Then you are clearly in favor of extending the 
Nonproliferation Treaty next year? 
  [Bhutto] On an equal basis. 
  [Koydl] What do you mean by that? 
  [Bhutto] This means that it must not be that some countries 
are included and others are excluded. I want a just solution 
for the Nonproliferation Treaty, not one that is basically 
discriminatory. 
  [Koydl] Could you explain this in a bit more detail. Who 
discriminates against whom? 
  [Bhutto] I am only saying that there should be one nuclear 
policy for all the world and not two different nuclear policies.

  [Text] As the government ordered a massive crackdown on 
Arab nationals, a majority of them has reportedly crossed into 
Afghanistan despite the authorities' claim that the border is 
sealed. 
  An Arab national, when asked to explain his future line of 
action said: "I am here as I pledged to the provincial 
government that I would stay here and not cross into Afghanistan 
but a majority of the Arabs have crossed the border and the 
agencies could not arrest them". 
  It may be mentioned here that April 18 was the deadline 
given 
to the nationals of Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt by the federal 
government. These nationals have appealed to the provincial and 
federal governments to extend the date of their extradition but 
the appeal was refused. 
  In this connection, a meeting was held at the Governor's 
House which was also attended by the commissioner Afghan 
refugees and the home secretary. The meeting decided to launch 
a massive crackdown on the Arab nationals. The task was 
assigned to the special branch but a senior branch official said 
that he had not so far received any directives from any quarter. 
He said that he was busy in a number of other assignments. 
  A provincial government official said that orders would 
definitely be implemented by the federal government and no 
extension in this regard would be possible. He said that 15 
nationals of Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt had left Pakistan for 
their respective countries. The Arabs who had got air tickets 
or exit permits would be allowed to stay till tomorrow (Friday). 
Protection would be provided to the family members of those 
arrested under 14 foreign act. [sentence as published] 
  It is to be noted here that the present government had 
thrice 
given extension to the nationals of three countries. They had 
been here ever since the start of Afghan war. The health and 
construction work in Afghanistan was said be supervised by them.

  [Text] A full regiment, the Rashtriya Rifles, of the Indian 
Armed Forces, which was previously deployed in the Indian 
Punjab, has now been moved to Srinagar so that it can 
participate in crushing the freedom struggle in occupied Kashmir. 
  Meanwhile, nine more people, including four freedom 
fighters, 
one civilian and two Indian soldiers, have been killed in fresh 
clashes at Baramula and other places. Two persons were killed 
while under police custody in Gandarbal. Many people have been 
injured as a result of indiscriminate firing by the Indian 
forces at Batapura in Badgam. The freedom fighters attacked the 
Army patrols in Kundi, Karibamalu, and the Kariba Zohra area of 
Shupiyan, injuring several soldiers.

<F P=106> [Article by Farhatullah Babar: "After Talbott's Visit, What </F>
Next?"] 
  [Text] Following the visit of US Deputy Secretary of State 
to India and Pakistan during which he met both government and 
opposition leaders Mr Talbott at his press conference in 
Islamabad on April 9 and in the joint Pak-US statement the next 
day made some significant observations about breaking the 
nuclear deadlock: continued dialogue through quiet diplomacy; no 
linkage of Kashmir with nuclear issue; agreement to pursue the 
goal of capping then reducing and finally eliminating nuclear 
weapons from South Asia; the new US initiative of enhancing 
"verifiable" capping with bolstering Pakistan's conventional 
defence capability and meeting its security concerns and a 
promise by both sides to continue further discussions on it. 
These are surely positive signs but they also beg the question: 
Where do we go from here? 
  Perhaps we must begin by formulating key strategic questions 
about national security and the nuclear issue and rethink some 
of the basic assumptions underlying theories of our national 
security. This should be done without in anyway suggesting that 
the GHQ [General Headquarters] (which identify threats to 
security and formulates a response) is not aware of the 
imperatives of such an exercise. Nor to throw odium on the 
generals as did the noted Indian columnist Khushwant Singh the 
other day in a newspaper interview "After all a vaila (idle) 
soldier with a gun in his hand has no sense of responsibility". 
  A problem with the military mind set is to militarise the 
realities and perceive national security only in terms of the 
number of army divisions, air force squadrons and naval frigates 
and submarines. It rarely occurs to the brass that if such were 
the dynamics of national security then smaller nations would not 
have existed alongside larger neighbours. For generals, air 
marshals and admirals the response to challenges of national 
security is gun for a gun, bullet for a bullet, bomber for a 
bomber and submarine for a submarine forgetting other vital 
elements of state power such as human development, social 
cohesion, national integration and people's participation in the 
shaping of their destinies. Did the Soviet Union not 
disintegrate because of its criminal neglect of the social and 
human dimensions of survival and development? 
  Related to it is another characteristic peculiar to the 
military mind. A former three star general confided with this 
scribe the other day, "we in the army know only how to spend, 
not how to earn. Wherefrom the money comes, he said, is the 
concern of some Sartaj Aziz or a Mahboobul Haq or a Jaffarey. 
Beg, borrow or steal but give us money for weapons. This is the 
military's logic. That is why the caretaker prime minister Moin 
Qureshi -- a crusadar of human and social development -- once 
said during his brief stint what lengthy discourses would not be 
able to convey. "Curtailing military budget" he warned in 
Peshawar, "would amount to playing with fire". It was no idle 
warning. 
  We must begin to ponder over a few strategic questions. 
Answers to these questions are essential to correct our 
bearings and chart out our future course in a vastly changed 
world when the Berlin Wall has collapsed, a superpower has 
disintegrated, economic rather than military prowess has become 
the determinant of inter state relations and with the end of the 
Cold War, the issues of disarmament and non-proliferation have 
come to the centre stage of international relations. Here are 
the eight basic and fundamental strategic questions: 
  -- FIRST: Will our security be enhanced or undermined by 
open 
acquisition of nuclear weapons and brandishing them too as we 
have been doing in the past? Will our acquisition of nuclear 
weapons deter or provoke India to do likewise and in that event 
whose security would be more undermined -- India's or Pakistan's 
-- keeping in view India's vast scientific, technological and 
nuclear infrastructure and geographical advantages? 
  -- SECOND: Is the overall cost of nuclear weapons 
development 
bearable for a country like Pakistan -- cost not simply in terms 
of fabricating a crude device but also in terms of constantly 
improving and upgrading it, building delivery systems apart from 
the intangible cost iof diplomatic and political isolation, lost 
opportunities of International cooperation in the development of 
nuclear power plants for power generation and the suspension of 
economic and military aid? 
  -- THIRD: Can a weapon of ultimate resort like the nuclear 
weapon be used in any eventuality? Since World War II it has not 
been used. Former US president Nixon has recalled how on five 
different occasions he came close to deciding about using a 
nuclear weapon -- thrice over Vietnam -- but each time after 
debate and reconsideration, decided not to. Should a weapon 
which cannot be used be made at all and that too at such an 
exorbitant cost? 
  -- FOURTH: Does the so called theory of deterrence still 
hold good or it needs reexamination. [sentence as published] 
The post Hiroshima history begs the question: what if a nation 
is not deterred? Vietnam was not deterred by the US. Afghanistan 
could not be deterred by the mighty nuclear arsenal of the USSR. 
And more recently, Iraq was not deterred by US nuclear weapons 
even though it was routed in the end by superior conventional 
military technology. Is there any sound basis for our 
presumption that in case of India, it will be deterred and not 
provoked by a nuclear Pakistan? 
  -- FIFTH: Granted that India is our enemy, is immoral and 
wicked. But is India also so fanatic to expose itself to 
unacceptable damage by starting a nuclear war with Pakistan? 
  -- SIXTH: "In the event of a first strike", claimed General 
Beg recently in Karachi, " India's conventional capability will 
be wiped out". Sounds pleasing to the ears. But what if India 
strikes first, or absorbs the first strike and retaliates? Will 
we be able to withstand it. 
  -- SEVENTH: In spite of universal clamour for a complete ban 
on nuclear testing, Britain and France are reluctant because 
they still consider testing of a nuclear weapon essential for 
inducting it into the war machine as a reliable weapon. This is 
because a battlefield nuclear weapon is vastly different from a 
nuclear device (which may have more propaganda but little 
strategic value). Pakistan's alleged nuclear device remains 
untested. What if it turns out to be a dud and the bluff is 
called? 
  -- EIGHTH: We seek to link the resolution of Kashmir with 
Pakistan's nuclear capability. But Kashmiris are now on their 
own, fighting their own battle of liberation. How can we take 
Kashmiris for granted in a nuclear bargain with the US? What if 
tomorrow the Kashmiris demand the third option of independence 
and reject the Pakistani price? 
  These are only some of the strategic questions and answers 
which are unlikely to come for discussion behind closed doors in 
the GHQ or in the semi-lit corridors of the Foreign Office. 
Answer to them may be found by tearing apart the shroud of 
secretary around theories of national security and initiating an 
open public debate. When Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto told the 
brass at the National Defence College last month the "problems 
of security and development need an integrated approach" she was 
only making an understatement because perhaps she too does not 
want to play with fire. It will be a pity if the nuclear roller 
coasters kept their eyes shut to the realities. They must 
remember that the stern dynamics of nations' survival and 
development seldom pause for pity.

held that on the revival of the Provincial Assembly of the NWFP 
[North-West Frontier Province] on the lapse of the proclamation 
issued by the president, the chief minister and his cabinet will 
stand revived. 
  The court clarified that it would be open to the governor to 
refix the date and time in accordance with Article 130 (5) of 
the Constitution, requiring the chief minister to obtain a vote 
of confidence from the assembly. 
  The two dissenting judges were of the view that the petition 
[by the former chief minister] was not maintainable and would 
therefore stand dismissed.

<F P=106> [Article by Mazhar 'Arif: "The Crow's Nest""] </F>
  [Text] The incident involving two helicopters in Iraqi 
Kurdistan must open the eyes of the world public to the nature 
of the complicated and grave situation in that dear part of Iraq 
under the control of the coalition forces. It should show the 
need for action by all possible political means in order to 
secure the withdrawal of the aggressors from the region and the 
return of the Iraqi Government to Kurdistan to serve our Kurdish 
people, as well as peace and stability in that entire region. 
  Nobody, under the conditions prevailing in Kurdistan, and in 
light of the incident involving the two helicopters, can 
guarantee the avoidance of an actual military confrontation 
between Iraq and the coalition forces. It could happen at any 
time the United States or any other aggressor state fabricates 
an incident similar to the one involving the two helicopters, or 
some other incident, and accuses Iraq of being behind such an 
incident in order to carry out an aggression against it. This 
is especially true during the interim period prior to the next 
UN Security Council meeting, which will decide whether to 
increase or reduce the months of the blockade, which is the best 
description of the current general trend within the Council, 
including the position of three permanent member states that 
requested that the chairman's statement on the Council period 
meetings include reference to Iraq's cooperation with the world 
organization. 
  The systematic U.S. campaign against Iraq since the last 
Security Council meeting, accusing it of violating what is 
termed "human rights" and perpetrating attacks on UN employees 
and observers in Kurdistan despite Iraq's repeated denials of 
these allegations, generally confirms Washington's intentions 
against Iraq; namely, to carry out a new aggression against it 
without going back to the Security Council. They hope to do 
this on the basis that the United States and its collaborators 
are not in need of another resolution from the Security Council 
in this regard since the Council had previously empowered them 
in the session which permitted the 30-state aggression on Iraq 
in 1991 to wage new attacks if Iraq declined to implement the UN 
resolutions according to their own opinions. If for some reason 
the new aggression could not be carried out against Iraq, the 
other solutions would be continuing the blockade and keeping the 
situation as it is in the Iraqi Kurdistan region on the pretext 
of protecting Iraqi Kurds from the Iraqi Army. 
  We must observe the following: 
  1. The first announcement about the shoot down of the two 
U.S. helicopters came from the sources of the renegades. The 
announcement claimed, even before the facts about the incident 
became known, that the two helicopters were shot down by the 
Iraqi Air Force, a deliberate attempt to mix the cards and 
prepare the psychological environment for a military action by 
the United States and another ally against Iraq. This is 
explained by what U.S. officials had kept repeating, several 
hours after the incident, that they were waiting for the 
findings from the Coordination Center in Kurdistan and the 
European Command in Germany before determining the party 
responsible for the incident. 
  2. U.S. officials kept insisting, despite their admission 
that the two helicopters were shot down by two U.S. F-15 fighter 
bombers, that the two helicopters were carrying UN personnel, 
which was denied by the United Nations. The U.S. aim behind this 
was to mislead the world public about the foreign presence in 
Kurdistan and to portray it as a UN presence. This also was 
refuted by the spokesman of the UN secretary general when he 
pointed out that the United Nations had nothing to do with the 
different activities of the United States and its allies in 
Kurdistan. The U.S. reference to UN personnel was intended to 
avert the reaction of the families of the dead Americans, 
especially in the present circumstances when the U.S. Congress 
is locked in a sharp dispute with the waffling U.S. president 
over the Whitewater scandal. So, it was decided to release the 
information on the helicopter incident and the nationalities of 
the dead men to the American people in installments. 
  At any rate, our people and the international community need 
to be extremely alert so as to confront the intrigues and plans 
of the United States, which seeks to greatly harm Iraq by every 
means, both inside and outside the UN Security Council, and to 
do all it can to make people in the United States and abroad 
forget the helictoper incident and to implement new plans 
against Iraq.

  [Text] Self-determination for the former Spanish colony of 
Western Sahara made the news again today in Madrid as the terms 
of the never-met requests of Polisario [Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro] were formulated 
again. 
  Three years after the agreement for a referendum was reached 
at the United Nations, the Sahraoui organization highlights the 
Moroccan trick of carrying out the referendum with an electoral 
role twice as long as the one established by Spain. Over to our 
reporter Maria Jose Castejon: 
  [Castejon] The hope for peace in the Western Sahara that 
began three years ago could well boil down to nothing. The 
former Spanish colony is once again threatened by war if the 
block on the self-determination referendum is not lifted within 
the next three months. In this race against the clock, a 
movement formed by European municipalities, parliamentarians, 
and other nongovernmental organizations, has held a conference 
in Madrid to raise awareness and to put pressure on the United 
Nations so that Morocco abandons its stubborn position that it 
has maintained over the last few years. 
  One of the speakers, Odon Elorza, the mayor of San 
Sebastian, 
believes that the international community should be held 
responsible if war flares up again in the Sahara. [indistinct 
passage omitted] 
  [Castejon] Mohamed Abelaziz, the president of the Sahara 
Arab 
Democratic Republic, who is also head of the Polisario, is at 
the conference. Despite the threat of war, he never stops 
talking about hope. Abelaziz has asked Spain to play a more 
active role because it is well aware of what is happening in the 
Western Sahara. 
  He wants the electoral role drawn up by the Spaniards in 
1974 
to be respected. Its use as the basis for the referendum is the 
main claim of the Polisario. Abelaziz says that the UN 
secretary general's proposal to add to the electoral role is 
unacceptable because it would mean giving Morocco a free hand in 
turning the referendum into a joke by adding hundreds of 
thousands of voters who are not from the Sahara to the role.

  [Text] Bucharest, April 21 (AFP) -- Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres said an accord to launch Palestinian 
self-rule was "very near" as he attempted to clear away the 
remaining obstacles delaying autonomy in Gaza and Jericho in 
talks here Thursday with PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat. 
  Israeli officials said Peres and 'Arafat discussed the 
possibility of a meeting between the PLO leader and Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, but no more details were given. 
  In Cairo, where PLO and Israeli negotiators held further 
talks Thursday, PLO chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said Rabin and 
'Arafat were expected to sign a final accord on the launch of 
Palestinian self-rule in the first week in May. 
  "It will very probably be between Monday, May 2, and 
Wednesday, May 4," Sha'th said. "Rabin and Arafat will meet in 
Cairo over two days." 
  Peres said 'Arafat was "encouraged by the good news" coming 
from the Cairo talks. 
  "We feel we are very near to the conclusion of an agreement" 
on autonomy, Peres said. 
  The PLO and Israel would "try to resume and conclude the 
talks as soon as possible," he said, adding that there were 
"some remaining issues which are being negotiated in Cairo." 
  "Both the Palestinians and us are deeply interested in 
shortening the transition." 
  Peres told Israeli radio differences remained over control 
of 
airspace and territorial waters, jurisdiction in the future 
autonomous areas and the Palestinian autonomy council due to 
oversee five years of interim self-rule leading up to a final 
settlement. 
  After his first meeting with Arafat in the Romanian capital 
Peres also noted differences over economic issues and the 
identity papers Palestinians would carry. 
  Peres and 'Arafat held three sessions of talks, their first 
since a Jewish settler slaughtered 30 Palestinians at a Hebron 
mosque on February 25 leading the PLO to halt the autonomy talks 
for five weeks. They were due to give a joint press conference 
at the end of the day. 
  Romanian officials said they would also have a joint meeting 
with Romanian President Ion Iliescu Thursday, before co-chairing 
a session of the Crans-Montana Forum, an international 
conference on the economic future of the Middle East. 
  Israel was due to begin a troop withdrawal from Gaza and 
Jericho on December 13 and complete it by April 13, but the 
handover was delayed by disagreements over security arrangements 
and the disruption caused by the Hebron massacre. 
  On arrival in Bucharest 'Arafat again deplored the fact that 
the April 13 deadline had not been kept. However, Peres said he 
hoped the pullout would take place "as soon as possible." 
  After his first session of talks with 'Arafat he said he had 
tried to dispel the PLO leader's anxiety about implementation of 
the Declaration of Principles signed in Washington last 
September. 
  'Arafat, originally scheduled to leave Bucharest Friday, 
will 
instead leave Thursday evening because of "an urgent meeting of 
the Executive Committee" of the PLO, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Jalal al-Mashitah: "'Arafat Believes the Problem </F>
Is With the Occupation Not With Hamas"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has 
told AL-HAYAH that negotiations with the Israelis are "useless." 
He said that the Israelis "are quite distant from the so-called 
peace, reconciliation, or settlement." He also attacked the 
U.S. Administration, claiming that "it paid Israel, in advance, 
everything it asked for as a price for peace, and more." He 
stressed that there is no problem with Hamas. "Our problem is 
with the Israelis and the occupation." 
  'Arafat left Moscow yesterday for Bucharest, concluding a 
visit during which he met with President Boris Yeltsin, who said 
that the establishment of peace is one of Russia's "strategic 
priorities." He also promised political support for the 
Palestinians to boost the negotiation process. It is understood 
that he intends to convey 'Arafat's "complaint" to Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin who is due in Moscow next Sunday. 
  Abu-'Ammar ['Arafat] told AL-HAYAH that his visit to Moscow 
was "important, positive, and fruitful. It is the first visit 
by an Arab leader to the Russian Federation after the major 
change that has taken place in that country. We held extensive 
and useful talks with President Boris Yeltsin and his Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev on the grounds that Russia is one of the 
two sponsors of the peace conference and one of the signatories 
of our agreement with the Israelis at the White House. 
Furthermore, Security Council Resolution 904 calls on the two 
sponsors to implement the resolution, and that includes taking 
on the responsibility of sending UN forces to Palestine, 
beginning with Hebron, to protect the Palestinian people." 
  Answering a question, 'Arafat said "I have old links with 
the 
Russian Orthodox Church. I had strong links with the late 
Patriarch Pimen. We discussed many issues with His Holiness 
Aleksiy II, especially the effects of the peace process on the 
position of Jerusalem from the Christian and Islamic angles." 
  On the negotiations on autonomy implementation, he said: 
"Any negotiations with the Israelis are useless because 
Israel's aim is to waste time, maneuver, dither, and 
procrastinate. We are continuing the negotiations but there is 
a limit to patience. I have said that to President Yeltsin and 
I have sent official messages to this effect to U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, the leaders of the permanent members of the 
Security Council, the chairman of the Nonaligned Movement, the 
Islamic summit, and the Arab League to bring all face to face 
with their responsibilities. The aim of this Israeli Government 
is to procrastinate and play for time. It does not want to 
implement anything on the ground, and it bears the 
responsibility for all the consequences of that attitude. Let 
God be my witness that I have told the truth. For our part, we 
have done everything and have been fully flexible but they are 
quite detached from the so-called peace, reconciliation, or 
settlement." 
  Is Israeli intransigence the only reason? He said: "The 
U.S. Administration bears the responsibility, for it has paid 
Israel, in advance and before anything was implemented, 
everything Israel asked for as a price for peace, and more, 
including most advanced aircraft, internationally banned nerve 
gas -- recently seized on a boat near Sri Lanka -- a $10 billion 
loan, and advanced computers. 
  "It has provided economic, financial, and political aid, so 
why do the Israelis not offer anything? Our Arab nation should 
understand this. I consider myself a fedayeen in an advanced 
position in the peace process. God is my witness." 
  Asked whether the Israeli intransigence would lead to 
rapprochement with the other Palestinian factions, particularly 
after statements by Hamas officials that they might accept the 
peace process, 'Arafat replied: "Our problem is with the 
Israelis and the occupation. There are no problems between the 
Palestinian parties. I knew before that my brothers in Hamas 
had a line of accepting it (the peace process) along the road to 
the forthcoming elections, that is if the Israelis allow the 
Palestinian people to hold such elections." 
  Asked what he thought of Israel's deliberate discrimination 
between Hamas detainees and the rest of the Palestinian 
detainees, he said: "The PLO has always worked for the release 
of all the Palestinian detainees from the occupation prisons. 
Actually, that is an important point as far as enhancement of 
the negotiation process is concerned. You may recall that I had 
personally requested the release of Hamas leader Shaykh Ahmad 
Yasin from Israeli prison. There was a promise of that but that 
promise has not yet been fulfilled." 
  On the date of his return to the occupied territory and 
Rabin's assertion that dates are not sacred, the Palestinian 
President said: "If dates are not sacred, then what is sacred? 
As regards my return, I do not see this as a personal issue. I 
speak from a position of responsibility and confront the [peace] 
conference cosponsors with their international, moral, and 
political responsibilities in order to save the peace process 
because the alternative to peace is total chaos in the region 
and Balkanization. [quotation marks as published] 
  He finally emphasized that "there is a need for a united 
Arab 
position to meet the challenges facing the Arab nation and 
resulting from the new world order, to ensure that that new 
order is not at our expense nor at the expense of our nation, 
generations, and wealth."

  [Text] President Husni Mubarak has emphasized the 
importance of the great strides Middle Eastern countries have 
made in economic and social development because this is the 
sound way to enable them to reap the fruits of peace. These 
countries should exert intensive efforts to review their forms 
of economic development. This came in a message President 
Mubarak addressed to the Bucharest International Forum and read 
by People's Assembly Speaker Dr. Fathi Surur. 
  President Mubarak noted that the success of economic 
cooperation in the Middle East will not be confined within the 
boundaries of this region but will have a positive impact on the 
world economy. He said that he does not conceive of such 
cooperation growing amid the economic contradictions buffeting 
the region and the discrepancy in the level of development, as 
well as the difficult economic situation besetting the countries 
of the region. He added: Therefore, we expect the European 
countries to play the role of main partner in this cooperation 
because of the close link between security and prosperity in 
Europe and stability and peace in the Middle East. 
  President Mubarak said that the Middle Eastern countries 
look 
to the big powers to help them overcome their problems, such as 
energy, water, infrastructure, and population. He voiced his 
hope that a comprehensive and fair peace will be achieved to 
serve as a prelude to eliminating numerous hotbeds of tension in 
the world. President Mubarak noted the recent political 
transformations in the Middle east, such as the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, which has had an 
impact on the whole world.

<F P=106> [Report by Shulamit Schmerling on Prime Minister Yitzhaq </F>
Rabin's address at the United Kibbutzim Movement convention in 
Ramat Ef'al on 21 April] 
  [Text] Today the prime minister addressed a sympathetic 
audience: Kibbutz members do not shout slogans characteristic 
of right-wing demonstrations, and their applause is genuine. 
Yet when the discussion touched on the future of the Golan 
Heights, the tone changed. Confronted with very bitter and 
harsh criticism voiced by Golan kibbutzim representatives, who 
said: You are sacrificing us in advance; you are closing down 
the settlements, the prime minister laid his cards on the table, 
stating in no uncertain terms: For the sake of peace, I am 
willing to remove settlements. 
  [Begin Rabin recording] I view the Golan Heights through the 
security prism, first and foremost, no matter whether 
settlements exist there or not. Security, more than any other 
consideration, is my criterion for the Golan. Settlements may 
be removed only for the sake of peace. If we reach the point 
where we need to remove settlements for the sake of peace, I 
have been and will remain in favor of it. And I am not trying 
to whitewash anything or throw up a smoke screen. For me, peace 
is a higher value for Israel's future and security than this or 
that group of settlements. 
  Just this once, let us view the situation in a framework 
befitting the new reality, befitting a big and strong country, 
and not the country we were on the eve of our War of 
Independence, when we had to hold on to every settlement. [end 
recording] 
  The prime minister went on to warn: If the peace processes 
do not make progress this year or by mid-1995 at the latest, we 
will return to the days of tension, political stalemate, and 
great peril. 
  He referred to terror, too. He said, for instance, that 
since 1 January 1994, the terrorist policy of Hamas and the 
other radical organizations changed. They realized that without 
attacks inside the State of Israel, they will not attain their 
objectives. As a result, 23 have been murdered since 1 January, 
20 of them inside Israel.

<F P=106> [Interview with Fawwaz Abu-Tayih, Jordan's ambassador to </F>
Romania, by Yehudit Budek in Bucharest, date not given; from the 
"With the Midday Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Budek] A meeting was expected to take place here between 
[Israeli] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and the Jordanian prime 
minister. Why has the Jordanian prime minister not attended 
this international economic conference? 
  [Abu-Tayih] I do not think a special meeting was scheduled 
to 
take place between the Jordanian prime minister and the Israeli 
prime minister. The two sides are attending an international 
conference that deals, in particular, with economic cooperation 
between West, Central, and East Europe on the one hand and the 
Middle East countries. There are aspects of economic 
cooperation in the post-peace era that concern the countries of 
this region in general. If a bilateral meeting is needed to 
achieve a political purpose there will be other occasions. I 
really do not believe that postponing or canceling the Jordanian 
prime minister's visit has anything to do with this subject. 
There may be other reasons for not attending the conference. 
  [Budek] Do you not think the time is right for such a 
high-level meeting? 
  [Abu-Tayih] I believe that the peace process has been 
launched and there is no going back on it. We have confidence 
in the future. But, everything will take place in due course. 
Accelerating matters might be as detrimental as intentional 
postponment. Everything will take place in due course. The 
peace process was launched, is proceeding, and is based on firm 
principles. We were among the first countries in the region to 
call for peace and work toward it, especially His Majesty King 
Husayn, who is the man of peace in the region. He was among the 
first to make efforts to achieve peace in the region. 
  [Budek] Despite what you are saying we have not noticed any 
progress in relations between Israel and Jordan even in the 
economic field? 
  [Abu-Tayih] It is too early to speak about the economic 
field. However, progress was achieved in the political field. 
We signed a working plan with the Israeli side in Washington 
and a meeting took place between the Jordanian crown prince and 
the Israeli prime minister. Work is being done to achieve 
peace. The economic aspect follows the achievement of a 
peaceful settlement.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: The United States has announced its 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher is coming to the region in 
order to activate the peace process. The word activation is a 
loose enough term. It might mean just going through the 
motions, or might, on the other hand, imply a more significant 
and far-reaching action. Activation can be either the mere 
formality of calling the negotiators back to the conference 
table or a meaningful and purposeful exercise. 
  We do not think the U.S. secretary, who is known for his 
seriousness, would take the trouble to come to the region just 
for the formal activation of the negotiating tracks that have 
been suspended in Washington--that is, the Syrian, Lebanese, and 
Jordanian tracks--or for the sake of securing a new round of 
negotiations that will be added to the previous rounds, as far 
as achieving limited results. 
  We believe the activation required in the peace process and 
on which Secretary Christopher will focus during his tour very 
much depends on how this U.S. effort tells us what the term 
honest and unbiased partner means. 
  We realize Israel does not want the United States to be a 
partner or an unbiased and honest broker. Israel wants the 
United States to be biased toward all its stands. Despite the 
fact that more than two years have passed since the Madrid 
conference, these have prevented the achievement of the aspired 
peace. We, as Arabs, continue to wait for the United States to 
translate its role as an honest and unbiased partner in the 
peace negotiations into pressure on more than just the Arab side 
alone--pressure that sometimes has reached the point of 
cheapness, as happened in the drug list issue--and also pressure 
the Israeli side. Indeed, the Israeli side was encouraged by 
the continuous U.S. and Western support of its aggression, 
occupation of the Arab territories, and disavowal of Arab 
people's rights to continue its intransigence and refuse to 
comply with the bases of the peace process. Without these 
bases, it is hard to imagine the establishment of a just and 
comprehensive peace in this region. 
  Syria has always welcomed and encouraged effective U.S. 
efforts to push the issue of a just and comprehensive peace in 
the region forward. Syria continues to pin hopes on an honest 
and unbiased U.S. role, based on its conviction that there is no 
room, in any way, to depend on Israeli intentions to achieve 
this peace. 
  The obstacles placed by Israel for more than two years of 
negotiations have shown the accuracy and soundness of Syria's 
position that Israel is not serious about peace, which should be 
comprehensive and just in order for it last. 
  What Israeli officials are announcing these days in terms of 
preconditions and rejection of full withdrawal from the occupied 
Arab territories, as stipulated by UN resolutions, reinforces 
the conviction that the Israeli stand shows no signs of hope 
concerning the future of the negotiations. 
  Therefore, the way to achieve an actual and meaningful 
activation of the peace process depends, as we said earlier, on 
the U.S. secretary bringing something new with him. 
  We do not think we are exaggerating when we say a priority 
task for the first sponsor of the peace process is to use its 
influence on the obstructive Israeli side in order to reinforce 
the chances for achieving a just and comprehensive peace.

  [Text] The Bosnian ambassador to Tehran has termed the fall 
of Gorazde a pre-planned Western plot. In an interview with our 
reporter, Mr. Omar Bahman emphasized that the UN and Security 
Council member countries, including Britain, France, and Russia 
were directly responsible for the massacre of Gorazde Muslims. 
  In reference to activities of the UN secretary general, he 
said: Butrus-Ghali and other UN officials are receiving huge 
salaries from the international budget to guard the interests of 
powerful countries. 
  The Bosnian ambassador also called on Islamic countries to 
show greater movement toward solving the Bosnian crisis. Mr. 
Omar Bahman said: Islamic Conference Organization resolutions, 
much like UN resolutions, have remained as paper documents. He 
said that a number of Islamic countries, in particular Arab 
governments, which are similar to Western countries and act to 
deceive public opinion, support Bosnia only in words. 
  Thanking Tehran for its stance, the Bosnian ambassador said: 
The practical support provided by the people and government of 
Iran for the Bosnian nation was an appreciated reality.

<F P=106> [By Nadeem Qadir] </F>
  [Text] Khagrachari, Bangladesh, April 21 (AFP) -- A fragile 
truce threatens to collapse in this rugged district as 
Bangladesh troops and Buddhist rebels trade charges of violating 
a ceasefire signed last year to end a dragging bush war. 
  "The army is still carrying out combing operations," said 
tribal leader Kisha (eds: one name) and cited an incident on 
April 12 when soldiers allegedly beat tribals indiscriminately 
in this frontier district bordering India. 
  "This shows a lack of sincerity" on the part of the troops, 
Kisha added. 
  A Bangladeshi army officer here confirmed that operations to 
flush out the outlawed guerrillas were continuing, but denied 
allegations that soldiers were using repressive measures to 
combat tribal insurgency here. 
  "If we know that insurgents have taken position in a 
village, 
you do not expect us to sit tight," the army officer added. 
  On ceasefire violations, the officer said: "We do not fire 
unless we are fired upon -- we maintain that strictly." 
  He asserted that it was the rebels who violated the 
ceasefire 
frequently in three districts of Bangladesh's Chittagong hill 
tracts. 
  Both Kisha and the officer, however, said insurgency-related 
violence in the sprawling tracts ebbed since the first ceasefire 
offered by the rebels became effective last year and was 
extended several times. 
  Government troops have been fighting Shanti Bahini (Peace 
Brigade) Buddhist rebels in the frontier hill districts of 
Khagrachari, Rangamati and Bandarban for the past 19 years. 
  The bush war has, by an official count, left more than 2,500 
people dead, many of them killed in rebel ambushes and riots 
with Moslem settlers. The unofficial toll is widely believed to 
be much higher. 
  The Bahini, which claims to have 3,000 guerrillas on its 
rolls, have allegedly set up bases in adjoining Tripura state in 
India where some 56,000 tribespeople, mostly from the Buddhist 
Chakma tribe, have taken shelter. 
  The question of repatriation of the Chakmas to the tracts 
here remains embroiled in controversy with New Delhi demanding 
guarantees of safety for the homeless returnees. 
  Bangladesh army sources said during the year-long ceasefire 
the Bahini rebels were responsible for 60 violations. The rebels 
say the soldiers broke the ceasefire 54 times since last May. 
  "(Armed) activities have reduced a lot, but not zeroed... In 
recent days there has been no deaths in military-rebel 
engagements," the army officer said. 
  This pictureseque valley-town, situated 1,300 feet (394 
metres) above sea level, could have been a holiday resort. But 
the dragging insurgency has discourged western or local tourists 
from visiting the region. 
  Security forces patrol the town as well as nearby villages. 
Troops with machineguns are positioned in secured towers atop 
hills here. 
  Residents say life has become easier since the ceasefire, 
which is due to end on May 15, came into effect. 
  "We still feel scared and people are careful not to be out 
of 
homes after evening," said Anup Chakma, a tribesman. 
  Other residents agreed that the fragile ceasefire had given 
everyone a respite from the regular gunbattles and bloodletting 
in this remote zone of Bangladesh.

commitment from Pakistan's side to the United States to set up 
military bases here. 
  In reply to a question by Mian Abdul Waheed, the foreign

  [Text] Kuwait, 23 Apr -- In an interview published here 
today, Kuwaiti Defense Minister Shaykh Ahmad al-Hamud denied 
that there were any current inclinations to reshuffle and change 
some commanders and officers in the Kuwaiti Army. 
  Al-Hamud told AL-ANBA newspaper that he was positively not 
"thinking about that during the current stage when Kuwaiti 
forces needed to concentrate on working and exerting efforts. 
  But he indicated that such measures could be taken in a very 
limited form with the interest in the work in mind and according 
to the needs of the next stage. 
  The defense minister clarified that he would settle the 
issue 
of summoning the ministry's commanders and officers by the 
National Assembly's fact-finding committee when he meets its 
members on Tuesday. 
  Al-Hamud said he would not allow commanders and officers 
from 
the ministry to be "dragged in" at any time without the presence 
of justifications and reasons for such a move, and would not 
allow them to be summoned just to be interrogated as witnesses 
in trivial cases or on suspicion of committing something or 
other. 
  On the other hand, the defense minister said that there had 
been offers by countries and arms factories to provide the 
Kuwaiti Armed Forces with weapons, some of which were advanced. 
These weapons would enter the service of the Kuwaiti Army and 
could be the first to be introduced in the region. He indicated 
that relevant committees in the Kuwaiti Army were studying these 
offers. He said that new arms would be acquired according to 
the needs of the Kuwaiti forces and their various weapons.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Facts Cannot Be Bypassed"] </F>
  [Text] The Baghdad regime is proceeding with its falsehood 
and ignorance. It has not learned from the lessons of the past 
despite their hardness and it does not want to learn from the 
lessons of today despite their facts that cannot be bypassed. 
  Following this regime's failure in its feverish attempts to 
break its isolation in the world and to affect the convictions 
of the international community, which are strengthened by past 
evidence and current practices; and now that this regime's 
procrastination -- designed to evade full compliance with the 
resolutions of international legitimacy -- has been exposed, 
this regime is trying, through its tools and lackeys, to 
undermine Kuwaiti national unity by jumping over facts and 
claiming that it wants to discuss "all unresolved matters" with 
the Kuwaiti National Assembly. 
  We firmly believe the attempt made by the speaker of the 
so-called Iraqi National Assembly does not deviate from Iraq's 
deception and lies. This attempt shows Iraqi arrogance and 
insistence on disavowing Kuwaiti legitimacy, separating the 
state from its constitutional institutions, and bypassing the 
legitimate government representing people's sovereignty over 
their land. It is a stupid and mean booby trap aimed at 
blackmailing national feelings regarding the issue of prisoners. 
Proceeding from its ignorance and failure to understand the 
lessons of the past, the Iraqi regime believes it can drive a 
wedge in national ranks pained by the ordeal of the prisoners in 
Baghdad jails. 
  The Iraqi regime has forgotten, or pretended to forget, that 
Kuwaiti national unity was the rock that shattered the evil 
ambitions of aggression. Had the Iraqi regime an iota of 
awareness or sense it would have opted for the one clear road in 
order to emerge from the swamp of humiliation, siege, and 
isolation. It is the road of international legitimacy's 
resolutions, full, and frank recognition of the sovereignty of 
the State of Kuwait over its territory, straightforward 
recognition of the international borders demarcated by a neutral 
international committee, immediate release of prisoners, and 
readiness to pay compensation to all those who were harmed by 
the criminal aggression. This is the only way.

  [Excerpts] A session of talks was held at al-Mushrif Palace 
this morning between His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al 
Nuhayyan, President of the United Arab Emirates, and his brother 
His Excellency President Muhmmad Husni Mubarak of sisterly 
Egypt. [passage omitted] 
  After the expanded meeting, a meeting confined to the two 
leaders was held. 
  Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has stated that today's 
main session of talks between the two leaders dealt with the 
developments in the Gulf region and Arab developments in 
general, the Middle East peace process, the results of the two 
leaders' mediation to preserve Yemeni unity, the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and bilateral ties in the economic and 
technical fields. 
  In a statement to the EMIRATES NEWS AGENCY, Musa said that 
the two leaders noted their eagerness and efforts to preserve 
Yemeni Unity and implement the Yemeni Pledge and Accord 
Document. He noted that Badr Hammam, the assistant Egyptian 
foreign minister, is now in Sanaa to pursue contacts between 
Yemeni leaders in Sanaa and Aden. 
  Answering a question on whether the talks dealt with 
arrangements to hold a quadrilateral Arab summit in Cairo to 
deal with the Yemeni situation, Musa said that preparations have 
not been made to hold this summit but the idea is still there. 
This summit would require good planning to ensure its success. 
  Musa said that the two leaders expressed great interest in 
developments in Bosnia-Hrezegovina and stressed the need for the 
international community to end the Serb attack against the 
people of Gorazde. Musa praised the NATO ultimatum to attack 
Serb forces unless they withdrew from Gorazde and said that he 
considered this a good move in the right direction if it 
realizes the aim of stopping Serb attacks and establishing peace 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Excerpt of "secret memorandum" obtained by AL-MUHARRIR from </F>
the Yemeni Foreign Ministry, date not given] 
  [Text] AL-MUHARRIR has obtained the text of a secret 
memorandum from the Yemeni Foreign Ministry revealing the true 
dimensions of the conflict, the position of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP], the role of some Saudi businessmen of Yemeni origin 
in fomenting the inter-Yemeni conflict, and its oil objectives. 
The memorandum reveals facts and puts some YSP leaders in the 
prisoner's dock. 
  The following is part of the verbatim text of the 
memorandum, 
a copy of which was made available to AL-MUHARRIR: 
  Apparently, great progress has been made in relations 
between 
the YSP and Saudi Arabia. There is much information about this 
issue. We have included the important parts in our memorandum to 
you No. 91, dated 23 February, following the important visit by 
YSP leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid to Saudi Arabia on his way home 
from Jordan. 
  Pursuant to our instructions, and as is customary in dealing 
with such kind of political developments, a number of our aides 
have held several contacts and meetings with various parties. 
They have reached a conclusion including the following elements: 
  1. The progress made in relations between the YSP and Saudi 
Arabia constitutes a success for the great behind-the-scenes 
action of a number of Saudi businessmen of Yemeni origin from 
the Hadhramaut area. "It should be noted here that the Saudi 
Embassy in Sanaa was not aware of these relations." These men 
are affiliated with rich financial institutions, and have a 
strong desire to invest in the southern parts of Yemen and to 
impose economic control, through their interests, on these 
areas. They have found the current circumstances in Yemen and 
Saudi Arabia an appropriate opportunity. On the one hand, they 
seek to satisfy the royal family in Riyadh by weakening the 
position of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, on whom the Saudi 
regime seeks to take revenge due to his position during the Gulf 
crisis, and later his position on the demarcation of the 
Saudi-Yemeni borders, which the Saudis termed as inflexible and 
unyielding. On the other hand, this wealthy group believes that 
the current YSP leaders constitute the best group of men to deal 
with, especially since they were able to tighten their control 
on the southern areas of Yemen, and engaged in a big conflict 
with President Salih and his aides in Sanaa. 
  2. The thing that contributed to the success of these 
Saudi businessmen's efforts is that their Yemeni origins, 
particularly from Hadhramaut, are congruent with the 
affiliations of the most prominent YSP leaders. YSP leader 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, Prime Minister [Haydar Abu-Bakr] al-'Attas, and 
Aden Governor Salih al- Siyali, who is very close to al-Bid, are 
all from the Hadhramaut region. The Saudi businessmen seek to 
involve the YSP deeper in the current conflict in Yemen even if 
this leads to the separation of the southern areas from the 
country as was the case before the Yemeni unity in Mayo 1990. 
If this turned out to be difficult, then, at least, the 
separation of Hadhramaut would be alright, along with the 
establishment of an independent state in it after annexing the 
al-Mahrah area similar to the other Gulf states, especially 
since the recent exploration of oil has encouraged such 
ambitions. We do not yet have sufficient and confirmed 
information about the YSP leaders' readiness to deal with this 
plan. There are only some signs and unconfirmed information 
about strong inclinations to respond to this plan by both 
al-'Attas and Salih al-Siyali. (It should be taken into 
consideration that in the case of such countries, personal 
inclinations of some strong political leaders can have a great 
impact on the general policy, particularly when there are 
adequate financial capabilities to support these inclinations). 
  3. The Saudi regime is exerting strong pressures and clearly 
encouraging the separation of south Yemen from north Yemen. The 
regime is supported in this regard by some Kuwaiti rulers. The 
reason here is self-explanatory and needs no further 
justification. These parties pin more hopes on the position of 
'Ali Salim al-Bid and his role in achieving the separation plan 
than on the YSP itself. 
  4. It has recently been noticed that undeclared large Saudi 
aid has been flowing to the officials in the southern areas. 
The powerful Aden Governor Salih al-Siyali is the coordinator 
of these relations. He enjoys powers that go beyond the powers 
of any other governor. What attracts many people's attention is 
that al-Siyali spends money lavishly. It has become clear that 
the greatest part of these expenditures does not come from 
government sources; something which proves that the source of 
these funds is the secret Saudi financial aid. 
  5. The group from the southern Hadhramaut region exploits 
its current presence in the YSP leadership to escalate the 
Yemeni crisis in order to separate south Yemen and to establish 
an independent state. This issue has become a source of concern 
for the other YSP leaders some of whom are from northern areas. 
They began to realize that the Hadhramaut group has deceived 
them and involved them in this. For this reason, signs of an 
internal conflict began to appear, a conflict which is expected 
to escalate. Surprises are not ruled out.

  [Text] A northern Yemeni official denied in Sanaa today 
that military reinforcements were sent to the northern 
al-'Amaliqah brigade which is stationed in the south, saying 
planes are transporting only food and medicine to troops 
stationed in the area. 
  The Yemeni official, who asked not to be named, said 
northern 
planes are now assuming this task because supplies for the al- 
'Amaliqah Brigade were cut off by the southern 20th Brigade in 
Mukayris, the point from which these items reached the Abyan 
area north of Aden where the al-'Amaliqah brigade is stationed. 
  The north Yemeni official was responding to a Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] statement issued last night accusing 
northern forces of sending reinforcements to the al-'Amaliqah 
Brigade in the south of the country. The YSP statement said 
seven helicopters carrying arms, military equipment, and troops 
landed at the al-'Amaliqah brigade's military camp and that at 
least 10 tanks and missile carriers were brought to beef up 
northern army positions in the central part of the previous 
border between the two parts of Yemen. 
  On another level, the Yemeni Army today attacked a site 
where 
the Jahm tribal elements have been detaining for one month three 
Netherlands nationals in a mountainous area, 200 km east of 
Sanaa. The Ma'rib district governor left for the site in an 
attempt to release the three captives, who had been working in a 
project to supply the capital with water. The kidnappers are 
trying to force the Yemeni authorities to employ members of the 
Jahm tribe in oil companies and the army.

  [Text] Kabul, April 23 (AFP) -- At least 158 people were 
injured in an overnight battle that erupted in Kabul between 
rival forces fighting for and against President Borhanoddin 
Rabbani, officials said here Saturday [23 April]. 
  Troops exchanged artillery and heavy weapons fire during the 
clash, but government troops said they had "repulsed" renegade 
fighters of Afghan Prime Minister Golboddin Hektmatyar. 
  They also claimed that "heavy casualties" were inflicted on 
the troops of Hekmatyar and Uzbek fighters of militia warlord 
'Abdol Rashid Dostam, the premier's main battle ally. 
  "The attack started at 7 p.m. (1430 GMT) and reached its 
peak 
at 10 p.m. lasting till midnight," a government soldier told AFP 
in the scarred Microrayan housing estate, situated near the 
former diplomatic enclave of Wazir Akbar Khan. 
  Rabbani's troops on Kabul's eastern front said troops of 
Hekmatyar and Dostam's Uzbek warriors attacked them at several 
points. 
  Hekmatyar's Shiite ally, the Hezb-i-Wahdat faction, also 
joined the battle, engaging Rabbani's troops at the city's 
south, the government troops said. 
  Reports of deaths from the clash were not immediately 
available but the Jamhurriat hospital here said three civilians 
died of their injuries while a 10-year-old boy with a bullet 
wound in the chest was in a critical condition. 
  During Friday's fighting a phosphorus shell slammed into the 
International Committee of the Red Cross complex but did not 
explode, but it ignited when Western demining experts were 
extracting the ordnance, relief workers said. 
  A few civilians still residing in the remaining Microrayan 
apartment estate said they spent the night in makeshift shelters 
or in the basements as shells whined overhead and bullets 
scoured homes. 
  Residents in one Microrayon block said only four of the 60 
apartments there were occupied as most residents had fled since 
rival forces turned the residential district into a regular 
battle ground four months ago. 
  Troops of Dostam, Hekmatyar and Rabbani are battling since 
January to take control of Microrayon, a sprawling residential 
enclave built by the former Soviet Union for its Red Army 
officers after it invaded Afghanistan in 1979. 
  Angry Microrayon residents came out of their homes to hurl 
curses at the United Nations, Western nations and the Afghan 
mojahedin for their woes as a lull in the battle set in 
Saturday, witnesses said.

  [Text] Ten members of Golboddin's militia were killed in 
Kabul yesterday when a mine exploded. Eyewitnesses told a 
BAKHTAR INFORMATION AGENCY [BIA] correspondent that Golboddin's 
militia members were killed as they were trying to steal 
equipment and electricity lines from the Breshnakot electricity 
distribution center. The mine had been planted by militia 
members. In addition to the loss of life, the explosion also 
destroyed one of their vehicles. 
  The BIA correspondent says that members of Golboddin's 
militia have previously clashed over the distribution of 
equipment from Breshankot, Jangalak factories, and Afghan 
carpentry (?workshops) and have mined one another's areas. As a 
result, several militia members have been killed and dozens of 
others injured.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 25 (AFP) -- India has not observed 
large-scale movements of Chinese troops into Tibet and the 
situation along the Indo-Tibetan frontier is "absolutely 
normal," a defense ministry spokesman said here Monday [25 
April]. 
  The Indian spokesman dismissed assertions by Tibetan sources 
that up to 30,000 Chinese soldiers had moved into Tibet during 
the past three weeks and that many of them had deployed along 
Tibet's border with India. 
  "We don't have any information like that," the defence 
ministry spokesman said. "The situation (along the border) is 
absolutely normal." 
  Noting that Indian and Chinese officials held a round of 
talks on border questions in Beijing last week, the spokesman 
said "this is the time when these troop numbers should go down. 
  "And we are making quite smooth progress in that regard," he 
added. 
  The London-based Tibet Information Network, citing sources 
in 
the Tibetan government-in-exile based in the Indian hill town of 
Dharamsala, reported Sunday that China had sent some 30,000 
additional troops into Tibet. 
  "The troop movements, the largest reported from the area 
since martial law was lifted from the Tibetan capital in 1990, 
appear to be concentrated around the Tibetan border with India," 
the Network said. 
  Tibetan sources here contacted by AFP said three divisions 
of 
People's Liberation Army soldiers had entered Tibet in the last 
week of March and first week of April. 
  They said many of the troops had moved to the Tibetan region 
bordering the far northeastern Indian states of Arunachal 
Pradesh and Sikkim. 
  The Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, has been based 
in India with some 100,000 of his followers since fleeing his 
homeland following a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959. 
  Indian and Chinese officials meet regularly to discuss ways 
to keep the peace on the border, subject of a dispute that took 
the two countries to a brief but bitter war in 1962.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 24 (AFP) -- The Tibetan settlement 
of Dharamsala in northern India was calm Sunday [24 April], but 
tension remained after the death of an Indian in a street fight 
triggered a burst of rioting, reports said here. 
  The Dalai Lama's government-in-exile issued an appeal to the 
residents of the hill town to maintain "peace and calm during 
this period of tension," a spokesman for the Tibetan spiritual 
leader's office in New Delhi said Sunday. 
  Tibetan refugees were urged not to retaliate against "acts 
of 
violence from anyone" and the Indians in Dharamsala were asked 
to help restore the traditional goodwill between the two 
communities. 
  Tibetan property, including some exile government offices, a 
hospital and library, were damaged and about a dozen people 
injured when angry Indian residents armed with bricks and sticks 
went on the rampage Friday. 
  The attacks were sparked by the death of a 20-year-old 
Indian 
youth in a knife fight Thursday night with a Tibetan refugee, 
who also was injured and hospitalised. 
  Police reinforcements have reached Dharamsala, where the 
authorities imposed a ban on public protests in response to a 
Tibetan request for additional security, the spokesman for the 
Dalai Lama's office said. 
  "Our information is that it is now calm and quiet, but there 
is some tension still," the spokesman said, adding that Indian 
leaders in the region had expressed their regret over the 
rioting. 
  He said the incident which sparked the riots was an 
altercation between two individuals and "no one should take 
steps which will result in communal tension." 
  Dharamsala has been home to the Dalai Lama and the seat of 
his government-in-exile since he fled Tibet in 1959 following an 
abortive anti-Chinese uprising. India is home to about 100,000 
Tibetan exiles. 
  The Tibetan spiritual leader is now on a visit to the United 
States and expected to return May 1. 
  His government-in-exile used Sunday's statement to express 
Tibetan gratitude to India for "coming to our help at this 
critical period in our history." 
  "Tibet and India have had close spiritual and cultural ties 
for centuries," the statement said. "The Dalai Lama has always 
been reminding our people that the relationship between India 
and Tibet is that of a teacher and a disciple."

  [Text] The National Assembly today began discussion on the 
political developments in the NWFP [Northwest Frontier Province] 
suspending all other business on the agenda. The motion to this 
effect was moved by the law minister, Syed Iqbal Haider. 
Initiating the debate, the leader of the opposition, Mr. Nawaz 
Sharif, was critical of the government's action and announced 
that the opposition will boycott the proceedings of the house 
till the measures taken in the NWFP are withdrawn and a special 
committee of the house headed by an opposition member is set up 
to investigate into the Mehran Bank scandal. He then led a 
walkout by the members of the opposition. 
  Taking part in the debate, the law minister, Syed Iqbal 
Haider, explained in detail the circumstance that led to the 
present situation in the NWFP. He said steps taken in the 
provinces have been necessitated to protect and strengthen the 
democratic process, rule of law, and the Constitution. The 
basic issue in the NWFP is who enjoys majority. Only the 
majority has the right to rule the province. The law minister 
said the PDF [People's Democratic Front] emerged as the largest 
parliamentary alliance in the NWFP assembly following the 
October 1993 elections. [Former NWFP Chief Minister] Pir Sabir 
Shah, the law minister pointed out, formed the government in the 
province by purchase of loyalties, but could not satisfy the 
members who supported him. The PDF and independent members 
moved a vote of no-confidence against the chief minister in 
February when he lost the confidence of the majority. The law 
minister said tabling of the no-confidence motion was a 
constitutional step, but Mr. Sabir Shah did not face the motion 
in a democratic and constitutional manner. Syed Iqbal Haider 
said the order of the governor asking the chief minister to 
obtain a vote of confidence was perfectly within the ambit of 
the Constitution. It should have been implemented in a 
democratic way. 
  The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said with the 
election of the new leaders of the house in the NWFP assembly, 
sense of stability has surfaced in Pakistan's politics. The new 
leader of the house was elected following the delivery of 
verdict on the same issue by the Supreme Court and, therefore, 
the process contains no ambiguity, she said, adding the process 
has paved the way for strengthening democratic institutions and 
bringing about stability in the country. Talking to newsmen in 
Islamabad today, the prime minister said the opposition has 
reacted to the development in the NWFP by walking out from the 
provincial assembly. She said this is one of the methods of 
registering protests and it is the right of the opposition to 
protest, but we feel the rule of majorities is an important 
principle in parliamentary form of government. 
  When her attention was drawn toward the opposition's demand 
for constituting a house committee on the affairs of Mehran Bank 
with its chairman from the opposition benches, the prime 
minister said the nation has witnessed massive loot from Taj 
Company, investment companies, cooperatives, corporations, and 
Mehran Bank scandal. She said we are not dealing with the 
matter on individual basis. We have authorized the State bank 
to plug all financial irregularities whether they are committed 
by politicians or by other citizens.

  [Text] President Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto have greeted President Borhanoddin 
Rabbani and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar on the occasion 
of the Islamic Revolution Day of Afghanistan. The president in 
his message said the people of Pakistan are proud that they 
stood shoulder-to-shoulder with their Afghan brethren in the 
difficult time of jihad. They are, however, deeply saddened that 
the fighting in Afghanistan continues. He appealed to the 
Afghan president to jointly take appropriate steps with other 
Afghan leaders so that a cease-fire is enforced immediately and 
the process of conciliation restarted. 
  The prime minister in her message to Engineer Golboddin 
Hekmatyar said that the people of Pakistan are concerned with 
the continued fighting in Afghanistan, which is depriving them 
of the fruits of jihad. She called on the Afghan prime minister 
and other Afghan leaders to settle their differences politically 
by being flexible in approach and contemplation so that peace 
and stability are restored. She assured Pakistan's total support 
and cooperation in this respect.

<F P=106> [Statement by Saharan President Mohamed Abdelaziz in </F>
Algiers, date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] After his participation in the seminar on the 
Western Sahara organized in Madrid, Saharan President Mohamed 
Abdelaziz, on his way back to his country has stopped over at 
Algiers airport, where he made a press statement at the VIP 
hall: 
  [Abdelaziz] Now there are three months, a three months that 
we consider decisive, given by the Security Council as a period 
to try to implement the peace plan. In our view we must not 
miss this opportunity, Morocco must not miss this opportunity, 
and the international community must not miss this opportunity. 
We must exert whatever effort possible to provide the 
opportunity for the implementation of the original peace plan, 
which aims at organizing a free, democratic, and impartial 
referendum to decide the fate of the Saharan people. 
  In our view, an international seminar could be held with the 
participation of neighboring countries -- Algeria, Mauritania, 
the state that was occupying the Western Sahara, Spain, the 
United States, and France in their capacity as members of the 
Security Council and as super powers concerned with security and 
peace in the region of north-west Africa, the two international 
organizations responsible for the implementation of the peace 
plan, in addition to the two parties to the conflict -- Morocco 
and the Polisario [Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El 
Hamra and Rio de Oro] Front. 
  In our view, such a seminar can actually contribute to the 
overcoming of difficulties that obstruct the implementation of 
the peace plan. Because it is not enough to refer the problem 
to the identity committee, which is a technical committee. The 
existing problems are political, and in order to help the 
identity committee, which we will cooperate with, we should 
create the right political conditions and hammer out the 
political difficulties that face it so that it can carry out a 
successful technical work.

  [Excerpt] The provincial federation of the General Union of 
Algerian Workers [UGTA] in Biskra held its fifth congress at the 
university center at the end of this week with the attendance of 
the UGTA secretary general Abdelhak Benhamouda and members of 
the national secretariat. The congress is being held with a 
view to appointing the provincial executive committee and the 
secretariat of the federation. Abdelkarim Benmoufaq reports: 
  [Benmoufaq] The congress was opened by UGTA secretary 
general 
Abdelhak Benhamouda. He delivered a lengthy speech on the 
occasion, in which he dealt with workers' difficulties in light 
of the fall in purchasing power. Soaring prices and a 
deterioration in the country's general situation, he said, has 
negatively effected workers and is a threat to their future. 
  In another development, he pointed out the plots hatched to 
harm the UGTA because it had worried many people because UGTA 
had been able to absorb and bring together workers and bring 
about a qualitative development on many issues that concerned 
the workers' stratum. He also stressed UGTA's determination to 
continue a real and effective trade union struggle now to try to 
protect workers' interests and defend their rights. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by 'Amira Hess and Yosi Torpstein] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Fatah Hawks and Hamas' [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam group have announced their joint 
decision to stop killing collaborators for a period of one 
month, "on condition that during that period all efforts will be 
directed toward dealing with this phenomenon." They also urge 
the collaborators to "cut off their relations with the enemy's 
Shin Bet apparatus." The two groups also forbid all their armed 
and wanted men to intervene in conflicts between families and 
organizations, rather to let special reconciliation committees 
-- or when necessary, the political level -- deal with such 
conflicts. 
  In a jointly signed leaflet disseminated in Gaza two days 
ago 
it is stated that the representatives of both sides have held a 
"historic session" and reached an agreement "aimed at 
strengthening national unity." The leaflet reiterates that this 
is necessary in order to foil Israeli attempts to polarize the 
Palestinian nation. The leaflet details six decisions regarding 
relations between the two groups and their violent treatment of 
various problems and social phenomena: To immediately stop 
mutual recriminations campaigns between Fatah and Hamas, while 
respecting all parties' freedom of expression; to stop all 
bloody feuds (which have recently proliferated between members 
of both organizations); "armed and wanted men from both sides 
are banned from intervening in conflicts between families and 
organizations." 
  The leaflet urges minimizing the number of strikes, limiting 
their scope (for example, to the neighborhood of a victim only), 
and in emergencies to jointly declaring a strike. School 
children are urged not to take advantage of strike days, but 
rather to stick to their studies and oppose those who force them 
to strike. The two groups undertake to stop killing 
collaborators for a period of one month during which they will 
discuss this phenomenon and give the collaborators an 
opportunity to mend their ways. 
  These decisions clearly reflect the growing criticism and 
dissatisfaction in the Gaza Strip concerning the behavior of the 
two groups and the terror they strike in people due to their 
trigger-happy mentality. Declaring a strike as a form of 
mourning has become a power demonstration method vis-a-vis other 
organizations, but this disrupts economic life -- which is 
difficult enough as it is. Despite the explicit instruction to 
continue studies on strike days, many students take advantage of 
this situation to skip school, and there are many complaints 
about the deteriorating level of studies. 
  The intervention of armed fugitives from both organizations 
in various conflicts has already threatened to develop into 
bloody conflicts between the two organizations. In the Gaza 
Strip there is a phenomenon of "piratical confiscation" of 
vacant lots for enlarging houses or building stalls. In Rafah, 
for example, Fatah Hawks more than one month ago demolished a 
building built by Hamas for public ends (a medical center and 
kindergarten). When Hamas people tried to rebuild it, Fatah 
Hawks opened fire, killed one person and wounded approximately 
25. 
  Regarding collaborators, people in Gaza tend to believe that 
people who are murdered by 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam are indeed 
proven collaborators, and that they are not assassinated rashly. 
At the same time, despite the fact that everybody hates the 
collaborators, people are concerned about the ramifications of 
the almost daily killings, about possible "mistakes" and about 
the danger of vendettas. From various comments made by Fatah 
and Hamas people alike, it is clear that they too are concerned 
about the liberty taken by armed fugitives in these issues, 
mainly Fatah Hawks members. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In the Gaza Strip, an agreement has been reached 
between Fatah Hawks cells and the cells of 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam, the military wing of the Hamas movement. The 
agreement has been blessed by the leaders of the two movements. 
On this agreement and its repercussions, Sa'id Mu'addi spoke 
with Rashid Abu-Shibak, a Fatah leader in the Gaza Strip: 
  [Begin recording] [Mu'addi] Mr. Rashid Abu-Shibak, a 
leader of Fatah in the Gaza Strip, what does the Hamas-Fatah 
agreement stipulate? 
  [Abu-Shibak] The agreement is between the Fatah Hawks and 
the 'Izzl-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions. It has six major points. 
The first talks about an immediate halt to defamation campaigns 
between the two factions, while ensuring everybody's right to 
free expression, as well as holding further brotherly dialogue 
between the two factions in the interests of the Palestinian 
masses. The second point speaks about renouncing differences 
and bloody conflicts and steering clear of the use of violence 
as a means to resolve differences. This point also emphasizes 
constructive dialogue between the sons of our people. The third 
point is that as of the date of this agreement, the pursued and 
armed men on both sides shall be forbidden to interfere and 
resolve organizational and family problems. This task will be 
assumed by national and Islamic reconciliation committees. The 
fourth point states that in view of the deteriorating economic 
conditions, it has been decided that a strike in the event of 
the martyrdom of any citizen shall last only one day in his 
vicinity. The rest of the areas will declare mourning but will 
not be on strike. Fifth, male and female students are asked to 
attend classes on strike days, because we do not want our 
students to miss classes. Finally, Fatah and Hamas have decided 
to stop the killing of agents as of the date of this agreement 
for one month and to declare this one-month period as a 
repentance period. These are the points of the agreement. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Abu-Shibak, how did the idea of holding 
dialogue and reaching such an agreement crystallize between the 
two movements? 
  [Abu-Shibak] First of all, the idea of holding dialogue has 
always been one of our traditions in Fatah and also on the part 
of Hamas. Our dialogue with Hamas has never stopped for one 
minute. However, praise be to God, our dialogue has this time 
been crowned by an agreement that will contribute to stopping 
the suffering of our people as much as possible. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Abu-Shibak, Israeli quarters have voiced 
concern over such agreements and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
has said such agreement could affect the Israeli-Palestinian 
agreement. 
  [Abu-Shibak] I do not think the topic addressed by Rabin has 
anything to do with the agreement we are talking about. Our 
agreement with Hamas addresses daily problems and concerns that 
face Palestinian citizens in the Gaza Strip. It has nothing to 
do with a specific political agreement. 
  [Mu'addi] Can we take the agreement between the Fatah Hawks 
and the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam cells to be a forerunner of 
possibly another agreement between the leaders of the two 
movements, Fatah and Hamas, during the self-rule period? 
  [Abu-Shibak] We hope this will be the case. We will seek a 
broader and more inclusive agreement between Fatah and Hamas. 
There is a good chance for such an agreement, particularly 
since we, along with the brothers in the Hamas movement, very 
much want everybody to take part in the forthcoming self-rule 
authority, since this will be for the good of all the 
Palestinian masses in the future. 
  [Mu'addi] Was the agreement blessed by the leaders of Fatah 
and Hamas in the Gaza Strip? 
  [Abu-Shibak] Yes, completely. We stress this agreement and 
consider it an important and positive step toward improving our 
relationship with the brothers in Hamas. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Rashid Abu-Shibak, thank you very much. 
  [Abu-Shibak] You are welcome. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, a prominent Fatah </F>
official in the Gaza Strip, by Amnon Levi -- live] 
  [Text] [Levi] Fatah and Hamas have signed a cooperation 
agreement and disseminated it this weekend in a joint leaflet, 
which deals with collaborators, strikes, and demonstrations. It 
fails, however, to even mention the peace agreement or Israel. 
Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, what is this agreement all about? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] First, this is an internal agreement in the 
Gaza Strip. It is not related to the peace process, but rather 
to the internal relations between the Palestinian people in the 
Gaza Strip. 
  [Levi] It broaches issues which relate to your daily 
affairs, such as the issue of collaborators, does it not? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] Precisely. The leaflet first of all calls for 
a propaganda lull between the two organizations, and this is a 
natural thing. It also calls for halting the assassination of 
people suspected of collaboration -- and this is the important 
thing. I have always struggled against Hamas and the 
rejectionist front organizations -- and within our organization 
as well -- with a view to stop the assassination of people 
suspected of... 
  [Levi, interrupting] How many suspects are being 
assassinated monthly, in your estimation? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] In the Gaza Strip at least 10-15 people are 
killed every month. 
  [Levi] You just find a corpse lying around somewhere in the 
morning? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] We find somebody who has been killed because 
he was suspected of being a collaborator. People are very 
concerned about this. 
  [Levi] What about other issues, such as distribution of 
land? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] Yes, this issue directly relates to Israeli 
rule. When the Israelis announced their intention to withdraw 
soon, people started worrying about what will happen to 
state-owned land. In the past people who took over state-owned 
land were fined. Now people have practically stormed these lots. 
  [Levi] Is this leaflet part of Fatah's efforts to assume 
authority in the Gaza Strip in anticipation of the withdrawal? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] We do not regard Fatah as being in authority, 
but rather the entire Palestinian people. 
  [Levi] This is a nice slogan, but Fatah will be in control. 
  [Abu-Zayidah] We want the entire Palestinian people to rule, 
not Fatah. 
  [Levi] I read in the newspaper that the Palestinians believe 
this agreement is historic. Why is it so important? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] It is important because we are in the midst of 
a critical period of transition. The entire world, including 
the Israelis, believe that once the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
pulls out there will be a massacre in the Gaza Strip and armed 
militia, Lebanese style, will roam the streets. Via this 
leaflet, as well as in meetings held over the last three days, 
we are trying to prove that this will not happen. The 
Palestinian nation is mature and will abide by the peace 
agreement. It will manage to sustain all the internal contrasts. 
  [Levi] Are you aware of the fact that Israelis are concerned 
about a Fatah-Hamas agreement, because we regard Hamas as a 
murderous terror organization? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] I am aware of this. You have a problem in 
this respect, because you think that every Hamas member wants to 
chase you with a knife. The truth is that Hamas represents 30 
percent of the Palestinian people. It is in the interest of 
Fatah, the PLO, and the peace process, that Hamas be included 
rather than excluded from the Palestinian regime. 
  [Levi] How is it, then, that you did not include even one 
clause of support in the peace process, if not in Israel itself? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] We are constantly exerting great efforts to 
keep Hamas close to us. We have not succeeded in terms of what 
you call stopping the armed struggle, because at the present 
time they do not ask us before they carry out attacks. 
  [Levi] This weekend the agreement may be signed, and in two 
or three weeks Gaza could be in your hands. Aside from the 
great joy, are you also afraid? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] I am not afraid, but I hope we will succeed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, a prominent Fatah </F>
official in the Gaza Strip, by Hasan Abu-Zayid; place and date 
not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-Zayid] What are the results of the latest 
Fatah- Hamas meetings? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] First of all, there is confusion between the 
public seminars being held in several places and the 
organizational meetings held on other levels. In any case, 
these contacts are aimed at unifying all Palestinian ranks. The 
aim is to prevent the shedding of Palestinian blood, 
particularly at this transitional phase between the signing and 
implementation of the agreement. There is no doubt that it is in 
the interest of the Palestinian people and the interest of the 
agreement and the peace process to have an agreement between 
Hamas, in particular, and the forthcoming Palestinian authority, 
particularly Fatah, which is a basic part of this authority. 
However, Israel thinks this rapprochement is taking place at 
the expense of the peace process. This is completely wrong. 
  [Abu-Zayid] What about this agreement? How can this 
agreement be interpreted? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] If you mean the agreement signed between the 
Fatah hawks and 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam [battalions], then I can 
say that this agreement is about internal affairs pertaining to 
the Gaza Strip. These affairs have nothing to do with the peace 
process, but with events on the ground. Please note that the 
agreement concerns strike days, the lands supervised by the 
government, internecine fighting, and the killing of agents. It 
is in the national interest of all to control these matters. 
The agreement does not cover support for or rejection of the 
peace process. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Will Hamas members participate in the 
Palestinian 
autonomy in Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] As supporters of the peace process and as a 
forthcoming Palestinian authority, we open all doors and windows 
to Hamas and the Palestinian opposition in order to participate 
in building the Palestinian future. However, there seems to be 
no agreement or firm decision within Hamas itself. There are 
personal opinions on the extent of Palestinian opposition or 
Hamas participation in this authority. For example, they do not 
object to participating in municipal councils or taking part in 
municipal elections. However, some refuse to take part in the 
administrative or legislative council elections of the autonomy. 
In all cases, it is in the interest of the Palestinians as well 
as Hamas to be part of this Palestinian authority. Otherwise, 
let it be a democratic, objective opposition. This is the aim 
of the dialogues and meetings. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Yesterday, you met for the first time with the 
Islamic University students, who are considered part of the 
opposition. What is the significance of this meeting? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] In my opinion, the meeting was extremely 
important. It sent a message to the Israelis and the whole 
world that the Palestinian people enjoy a great awareness and 
sense of responsibility, that they can shoulder their own 
responsibility by themselves, and that there will be no 
bloodbath as soon as the Israeli Army leaves the Strip, as some 
try to depict it. There will be great love, appreciation, and 
respect among the sons of the one people even if they have 
different views. This is the important message of this meeting. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Mr. Sufyan Abu-Zayidah from the Fatah leadership 
in Gaza, thank you very much. 
  [Abu-Zayidah] Thank you.

  [Text] Tunis, 23 Apr (MENA)--A prominent Palestinian source 
from Fatah, the biggest faction within the PLO, has stated that 
the agreement announced yesterday between Fatah and Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] is a "political agreement" that 
seeks to work out a specific formula for Hamas to participate in 
institutions of the future Palestinian national authority. The 
source described it as "more than just an agreement on 
cease-fire and bilateral differences." 
  The source, who took part in the recent round of 
negotiations 
with Hamas leaders in Gaza, added that Hamas had submitted 
proposals for participation in the Palestinian national 
institutions, including the Palestinian police. He pointed out 
that Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat welcomed Hamas' offer 
and willingness to join the national authority, despite its 
earlier opposition to the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles. He noted that 'Arafat had accepted in principle the 
proposals made by Hamas in Gaza. The proposals were also 
approved by Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the movement's [not further 
specified] political bureau. 
  The source stressed that 'Arafat will soon meet Hamas 
leaders 
in an Arab capital, probably Amman, to work out a final 
agreement on Hamas' participation in the Palestinian national 
authority. 'Arafat, the source added, is convinced that Hamas' 
new position represents a practical stand on the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. It shows Hamas' 
desire not to be isolated from the future Palestinian national 
authority's institutions, particularly since other Palestinian 
factions, such as the George Habash-led Palestinian Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine, have expressed a desire to join 
them. 
  The same source said that during in its meeting in Tunis 
under 'Arafat yesterday, Fatah's Central Committee endorsed the 
agreement with Hamas.

<F P=106> [Article by JORDAN TIMES staff reporters P.V. Vivekanand in </F>
Amman and Wafa' 'Amr in Jerusalem] 
  [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, on Friday 
[22 April] denied that it was signalling a shift in its 
fundamental approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict by offering to 
recognise Israel in its 1967 borders and negotiate a peace 
agreement with the Jewish state. 
  The group, in a statement issued by its Damascus-based 
political office, sought to reestablish that its objective was 
the creation of an Islamic state "from the (Mediterranean) Sea 
to the (Jordan) River," and that recent comments made by one of 
its senior leaders were misinterpreted by the media to imply 
that it was willing to abandon its call for the elimination of 
the state of Israel. 
  It appeared that the "clarification" owed its origins to 
differences from within the group's ranks in the occupied West 
Bank and Gaza Strip. 
  Islamist activists and political analysts in the occupied 
territories said Hamas' leaders, fearing political exclusion at 
a time when the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) are 
moving towards Palestinian self-rule in parts of the occupied 
lands, had rushed into making conciliatory statements in a bid 
to ensure their survival. 
  As such, Friday's statement was interpreted as a move to 
reassure those in the occupied territories who in principle 
reject any recognition of Israel, whether 1948 or 1967, by 
reaffirminig that there was no shift at all in the group's 
standing. 
  Several Hamas leaders said although the conciliatory stand 
was aimed at preempting isolation, it was also meant to show the 
Palestinian people that Hamas was capable of achieving better 
negotiating terms and a peace accord more responsive to the 
Palestinians' aspirations that the Israel-PLO autonomy agreement. 
  At the same time, the group's leaders have to take into 
consideration the opposition such a stand sparked among the 
young generation of Palestinians. 
  "Hamas' grassroots, like all the young Palestinian 
generation, are desperate for independence," a leading Hamas 
figure told the JORDAN TIMES in occupied Jerusalem. "Therefore 
any peace proposal suggested by Hamas' high echelon will have to 
take this into consideration." 
  Fatah leaders who have maintained a secret dialogue with 
Hamas affirmed that they were aware of a "change" in the 
Islamist group's stand and welcmed it because it gave an added 
momentum to demands for an independent Palestinian state in the 
territories Israel seized in the 1967 war. 
  Shaykh Ahmad Bahar, an Islamic leader in Gaza, said the 
group 
was "willing to negotiate with Israel to achieve Israeli 
withdrawal from the Palestinian lands it occupied in 1967 on the 
basis of U.N. resolutions. But this does not mean that Hamas 
has departed from its strategic goal of liberating all of 
Palestine." 
  Friday's statement, a copy of which was made available to 
the 
JORDAN TIMES, echoed the same sentiment. It said Hamas was 
committed to "escalating popular resistance and continuing holy 
war as long as the Zionist occupation forces remain in our 
blessed Palestinian land and until the liberation of all the 
occupied land from the sea to the river." 
  It said comments made by Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the 
group's 
politcal bureau, that a peace treaty was possible with Israel if 
it withdrew from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem did 
not imply any "concession to or acceptance of the Zionist enemy." 
  Explaining that the statement was issued to clarify the 
group's stand "in view of the popular and official reactions" to 
Mr. Abu- Marzuq's comments, "Which were not seen in their full 
context or misinterpreted," the group said its "political 
programme" called for: 
  -- Total and complete unconditional Israeli withdrawal from 
the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem; 
  -- The elimination of all settlements and removal of 
settlers 
from these areas; (The statement did not refer to Mr. 
Abu-Marzuq's call for Israeli compensation for the losses 
Palestinians suffered as a result of occupation. 
  -- Fair, full and free elections among the Palestinian 
people 
living inside and outside the occupied territories to elect a 
leadership which will be the sole authority to speak and take 
decisions on behalf of the Palestinian people and represent 
their goals and aspirations. 
  Here was the key departure of the group from what Mr. 
Abu-Marzuq had said. 
  The statement said: "If Hamas manages to win the confidence 
of the Palestinians, it will express and reflect the will of our 
people and mobilize popular forces to achieve the full 
liberation of our land." 
  (Mr. Abu-Marzuq had referred to the possibility of a "peace 
treaty" although he did not say between whom). 
  According to Hamas leaders in the occupied territories, the 
strategy as outlined in Friday's statement helps Hamas secure a 
role in the present political process. Without such a strategy, 
they said, Hamas would be left alone unable to influence the 
course of political developments. 
  Shaykh Bahar said the political leadership of the group 
outside the occupied territories has also taken a decision to 
participate in elections to the self-rule institutions envisaged 
under the Israel- PLO accord, but no decision has been taken on 
how Hamas should tackle the PLO's domination of the autonomy 
arrangements. 
  Shaykh Jamil Hamami, another Islamic leader in the occupied 
territories, said the decision was not acceptable since 
"participation in elections will give legitimacy to the 
self-rule authority." 
  The immediate objective of the group, he reaffirmed, is to 
"foil the self-rule deal itself." 
  Palestinian peace negotiator Frayh Abu-Middayn said Hamas 
had 
demonstrated political flexibility and pragmatism following the 
expulsion of more than 300 of its members in December 1992. 
  He said Hamas' peace overtures were a message directed at 
the 
PLO and not at Israel. 
  "They are telling the PLO we will not sit at the negotiating 
table with Israel. But we will have a share in the cake by 
being accepted as partners by the PLO," Mr. Abu-Middayn said. 
  Political analyst Mahdi 'Abd-al-Hadi argued that reasons 
behind Hamas' new stance were: 
  --If Hamas continued resisting Israeli occupation through 
rejectionist stances, it will be labelled the number one enemy 
to Israel and the U.S., and thus will have to pay a price it 
could not afford. 
  -- If it drew closer to the PLO's political position and 
participated in self-rule institutions, it would facilitate 
implementation of the PLO-Israel accord but without granting it 
legitimacy, and it would isolate the opposition inside the PLO 
against participation in the Palestinian authority.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Brothers: Despite the acceleration of events and 
the ferocity of dispute in the arena of political negotiations 
between the PLO and the Israeli enemy, our Palestinian people 
are confirming, exactly like they have always confirmed, that 
they are stronger than all conspiracies and attempts to 
undermine their internal front. 
  Through their awareness and lengthy experience in 
confronting 
the enemy, the Palestinian people have also confirmed that they 
are always vigilant and capable of replying to enemies' plots, 
so there will only be room for Palestinian freedom and 
independence on the liberated land of Palestine. 
  The Fatah-Hamas agreement on adopting dialogue as the only 
way to resolve political differences as well as prohibiting the 
shedding of Palestinian blood at the hands of Palestinians is 
actually a national achievement by the PLO regarding the 
solidification of the domestic Palestinian position in the face 
of the Israeli position that has persisted in beating the drums 
of Palestinian civil war when occupation ends. It seems as if 
Israeli malice wants to convince the Palestinians that it is 
better for them to live under occupation and relinquish the 
rights to their territories and homeland. 
  However, the recent Fatah-Hamas agreement in the occupied 
Gaza Strip came to deal a back-breaking blow to all enemy 
delusions, allegations, and schemes which primarily aim at 
undermining the domestic Palestinian situation against the 
Palestinian national authority in order to demonstrate that this 
authority lacks eligibility and credibility in administering the 
areas from which the occupation withdraws, and, consequently, it 
would be useless and unnecessary to implement any future 
agreements on expanding both the Palestinian self-rule areas and 
the Palestinian authority's responsibilities. 
  This agreement not only contributes to entrenching and 
consolidating the Palestinian national unity--so it will be a 
rock on which all enemy conspiracies founder--but it also 
stresses the bright sides of the comprehensive Palestinian 
struggle in confronting the enemy and its schemes. This is 
based on emphasizing Palestinian national principles when 
democracy is established and when the first and foremost loyalty 
will be for the homeland and for the interests of its sons, 
without making any room for differences in political viewpoints. 
Such differences would be a loophole through which the enemy 
could penetrate to achieve its objectives and destroy the 
Palestinian national achievements. 
  Furthermore, this agreement is a qualitative step in running 
the conflict with the Zionist enemy. Despite stressing 
continued struggle until the occupation is expelled from all 
occupied Palestinian territories, this agreement has stressed 
the anxiety of the Israeli side by emphasizing both the internal 
stability in the Palestinian self-rule areas and the devotion to 
the social and economic tasks assigned to all sons and groups of 
the people in order to lift the suffering which resulted from 
occupation and its practices. This is because Palestinian 
security cannot be achieved amid unemployment and strikes. 
  Our people, the people of heroism and martyrs, have 
confirmed 
that they are deservedly the people of miracles and that they 
know how to fight their enemies, safeguard their national unity, 
and entrench and accumulate their national achievements until 
independence and great victory are realized.

<F P=106> [By Sakher Abu Eloun] </F>
  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 24 (AFP) -- 
The fruits of the first accord between the armed wings of Fatah 
and Hamas were put on display Sunday [24 April] as the 
fundamentalists invited their erstwhile rivals to a university 
debate. 
  The Islamic Resistance Movement asked Fatah representatives 
to the Islamic university, a fundamentalist stronghold in Gaza 
City, to address 2,000 students on the forthcoming Palestinian 
autonomy and the opposition. 
  "It really is the first time that Hamas has invited us, and 
what is more to this university to speak to their students," 
said Diyab al-Lawh, a Fatah leader in Gaza. 
  "It's a good start to establish relations between the 
national and Islamic movements," he said after the Hawks and 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam announced an official agreement Friday to 
end internecine fighting and to cooperate for autonomy. 
  "However we do not want to talk about a honeymoon because 
that's for marriages and occasionally matrimony ends in 
divorce," he laughed. 
  'Ala' al-Nazli, a 22-year-old student linked to Hamas, 
agreed. "It's the first joint meeting. It was excellent and 
moving. 
  "It expresses the unity to which we aspire. We will hold 
more similar meetings and will maintain our relations with 
Fatah." 
  After warm applause for the arrival of three members of 
Fatah's high committee the debate quickly focused on how the 
9,000 Palestinian policemen will treat those like Hamas who have 
opposed the autonomy deal and the whole peace process. 
  The opposition fears victimization, particularly by the 
7,000 
men of the Palestine Liberation Army who will form the backbone 
of the force and are totally devoted to PLO chairman Yasir 
'Arafat. 
  Political science lecturer 'Atif 'Udwan, who was deported to 
southern Lebanon in 1992 as a Hamas member, questioned the 
impartiality of a police force recruited by the PLO. 
  "Generally in democratic countries, the police does not 
belong to any particular side. Will this be the case or will it 
be an extension of the Israeli police?" he asked 
  Al-Lawh replied: "The Palestinian authority will be elected 
by all Palestinians and the policemen who are due to arrive are 
veteran soldiers who have given their lives to the Palestinian 
cause and I do not think they will become the oppressors. 
  "The police will be clean and impartial." 
  The Israeli government has made no mention of the agreement, 
after warning the PLO that if it reached an understanding with 
the fundamentalists which allowed Hamas to continue its attacks 
on Israelis then the autonomy deal would be off.

  [Text] The heads of most terror organizations in the Gaza 
Strip have met in Gaza over the last two days. The meetings 
included Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], Islamic Jihad, and 
rejectionist organizations members. The meetings were held to 
prepare for the autonomy period. Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan 
reports the meetings were initiated by PLO officials in the Gaza 
Strip. The participants discussed cooperation possibilities 
between the various organizations, with the view of establishing 
a civilian and security cooperation apparatus after the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] withdraws from the area. The meetings 
were held against the background of an agreement reached 
yesterday between 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' military arm, 
and the Fatah Hawks on putting an end to acts of revenge against 
collaborators and stopping the strikes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Hamas: We Will Continue Operations </F>
Against Israel Until the Liberation of Palestine From the Sea to 
the River"] 
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- In two statements, one dated 20 
April and the other 21 April 1994, the Islamic Resistance 
Movement (Hamas) emphasized that its political program does not 
include "forfeiting a single inch of Palestine" nor does it 
include "recognition of the Zionist entity's right to exist on 
our territory." 
  The first statement was an "explanation" of the statements 
made by the chairman of Hamas' Political Bureau and carried by 
some media recently. The second, a more detailed statement, 
declared that Hamas' military operations will continue "against 
the occupying enemy...until the liberation of all our usurped 
Palestinian territory from the sea to the river." 
  Following is the text of the statement issued by Hamas' 
Political Bureau on 21 April 1994 under the heading "An 
Important Statement Issued by Hamas' Political Bureau on the 
Latest Developments": 
  "In the light of the political concept proposed by Hamas and 
in the light of the various official and media reactions to that 
and the statements made by the U.S. secretary of state, enemy 
government officials, and officials of other states, Hamas 
reaffirms the following: 
  "1. Escalation of the valiant popular resistance, jihad, and 
military operations against the occupying enemy will continue as 
long as there is Zionist occupation of our blessed Palestinian 
territory...and until the liberation of all our usurped 
Palestinian territory from the sea to the river. 
  "2. Hamas believes that the current so-called settlement 
negotiations between the PLO leadership and the Zionist enemy 
will fail because they are based on the perpetuation of 
injustice, aggression, and occupation, are held in an atmosphere 
of Zionist hegemony and arrogance and official Palestinian and 
Arab weakness, reflect submission and capitulation to Zionist 
and American terms and diktat, and run contrary to the will of 
our patient masses and their struggling forces. Hamas also 
reaffirms its clear position rejecting the feeble autonomy. 
  "3. Hamas outlined its political concept in a statement 
issued by its Political Bureau and in statements made by the 
chairman of its Political Bureau. It was crystal clear, leaving 
no room for confusion or speculation. Some information media 
reported it ambiguously and partially, giving the impression 
that there has been some change in Hamas' policy, programs, and 
concept of the conflict with the occupying enemy. Some even 
went too far by trying to interpret Hamas' views to mean that 
Hamas was offering an initiative for peace with the occupying 
Zionists or that its views meant recognition of the usurping 
Zionist enemy, and other such erroneous claims and 
interpretations. 
  "4. The Hamas political concept proposed to our people and 
their struggling forces calls for the following: 
  "A. Unconditional withdrawal of the Zionist occupation 
forces from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem. 
  "B. Dismantling and removal of the settlements and 
evacuation of the settlers from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, 
and Jerusalem. 
  "C. Holding free general elections for the Palestinian 
people inside and outside [the occupied territory] to elect the 
people's true leadership and representatives. That elected 
legitimate leadership would be the only party authorized to 
express the will and aspirations of our people and to decide all 
the subsequent steps in our conflict with the occupation. 
  "5. Hamas explained, through statements by the chairman of 
its Political Bureau, that if, after the general elections to 
choose our people's leadership, Hamas and its known political 
program win the confidence of our Palestinian people, then Hamas 
will express the will of the people and will seek to implement 
its program for the mobilization of our people's resources, 
forces, and capabilities and to unite their ranks for the 
liberation of their territory and holy places. If the election 
results prove to be different, then Hamas will respect the view 
of the majority but will adhere to its constant principles and 
program and work for their fulfillment, and it will express its 
views most freely and strongly. 
  "6. The aforementioned statements and declarations did not 
include what some tried to claim was a Hamas recognition of the 
usurping Zionist entity nor did they include acceptance of 
Security Council Resolution 242 or abandonment of Hamas' 
programs and constant genuine Islamic principles which regard 
Palestine as an Islamic territory which must not be given up, 
forfeited, or subjected to bargaining."

  [Text] Damascus, April 23 (AFP) -- The Islamic Resistance 
Movement Hamas said Saturday [23 April] the Israeli army 
arrested more than 2,700 Palestinians in the last two weeks, but 
added its militants would still continue to attack Israelis. 
  These arrests "which affect all those suspected of links to 
Hamas will not prevent more operations by the (armed wing) 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam nor the popular resistance" against 
Israeli occupation, Hamas said in a statement to AFP here. 
  Palestinian sources in the occupied territories have said 
that the Israeli army had arrested more than 500 militants in a 
bid to destroy the group after it launched attacks which claimed 
the lives of 14 Israelis this month. 
  The mass roundup "comes at a time when the enemy government 
prepares to release thousands of prisoners who don't belong to 
Hamas in a bid to divide the Palestinian people," the statement 
said. 
  Israel is to set free around 5,000 prisoners after the 
signing of a final deal to launch delayed Palestinian autonomy 
in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho, which may take 
place in May. 
  Israeli negotiators have rejected requests to set free 
members of Islamic militant groups opposed to peace. 
  Hamas called on the London-based human rights group Amnesty 
International "to pressure the Israeli government into freeing 
immediately the prisoners."

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Zayyat] </F>
  [Excerpt] The PLO leadership has asked Fatah leaders in 
Lebanon to collect and store weapons in the camps of the south 
in preparation for their transfer to Gaza and Jericho under 
Egyptian supervision, an informed Palestinian source disclosed. 
The source noted that prices of weapons on the world market 
have gone up. 
  The source said that Fatah official in Tyre Sultan 
Abu-al-'Aynayn, a supporter of Yasir 'Arafat, began collecting 
weapons in the camps of the region under his supervision. 
  The source said the move is part of an effort to remove 
weapons from the camps to influence the Palestinian forces that 
oppose Gaza-Jericho agreement and paralyze their activity in 
resisting the Israeli occupation of the south. The source noted 
that representatives of factions opposing the PLO policy and 
opposition Fatah leaders led by Colonel Munir al-Maqdah have 
recently held a series of meetings to escalate military action 
against the Israeli occupation forces in the south, and even in 
northern Palestine (Upper Galilee). This was evident in the 
operation carried out jointly by the George Habash-led Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine and al-Maqdah group in 
al-Khardali. Three fighters were killed in the operation. 
  The source described the collection of weapons and their 
transfer to Gaza and Jericho as a new card that will be conceded 
in favor of 'Arafat's capitulatory policy. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Muhammad </F>
al-Hinnawi in Tel Aviv; date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Hinnawi] Have there been contacts between you 
and 'Arafat following the recent acts of violence? Do you 
believe that more acts of reciprocal violence will adversely 
affect the peace process? 
  [Rabin] I believe that the Israeli Government and its prime 
minister and the PLO and its chairman Yasir 'Arafat must pursue 
two parallel courses simultaneously. The first course is to 
focus on the negotiations to reach an agreement on the 
Gaza-Jericho First accord. This, in my opinion, is the best 
response to the enemies of peace from among the Israelis and 
Palestinians. The second course is that when a mistake is made 
either by the Israelis or the Palestinians, such as an act of 
violence or terrorism, especially if it is directed against 
innocent people, we must show [sentence incomplete]. For 
example, the Hebron massacre, which was committed by a mentally 
disturbed Israeli murderer, is as serious as the attack on the 
bus that was carrying innocent Israelis. Both the Palestinian 
and Israeli sides must show that we have reached a point in 
which we are trying to resolve the conflict by negotiations and 
not by violence and terrorism. I myself did not listen to the 
shouts of the demonstrators in Israeli towns after the brutal 
acts which Hamas and Islamic Jihad carried out in Afula and 
Hadera. I explained to the Israeli public that we will continue 
the negotiations without delay or postponement. 
  The PLO suspended the talks with Israel for a month 
following 
the Hebron massacre. A number of Israelis asked me why they 
stopped the talks after the Hebron massacre and we did not halt 
them after the terrorist attacks against us. My answer was that 
I am doing what I believe to be correct. 
  I explained this stand of mine in my telephone conversation 
with Chairman 'Arafat. I believe if we want to give a real 
response to the enemies of peace, we must show them that we can 
reach an agreement and implement it. Any terrorist activity and 
any act of violence against Israeli and Palestinian citizens 
aims at obstructing the attainment and implementation of an 
agreement. In the telephone conversation I explained to 'Arafat 
that we will continue the negotiations as scheduled on Sunday 
despite the terrorist acts. Our delegation will leave for Cairo 
to resume the talks on Monday. You might ask me why the talks 
were postponed from Sunday to Monday. My answer is that the 
postponement was in response to a request from the Palestinian 
side. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] Will an agreement be signed in Cairo between 
the Palestinians and Israel before the end of April and during 
the upcoming tour of the U.S. Secretary of State to the region? 
  [Rabin] In accordance to what was agreed upon in Cairo in 
December, we must take into consideration that if we do not 
prepare well for the upcoming meeting, it will mean failure. 
And failure means frustration and disappointment. Therefore, 
in the last meeting in Cairo we agreed on the following: 
  1. Whatever is agreed upon will be written down and 
initialed. 
  2. Matters on which no agreement is reached will be 
divided into two parts: 
  A. Topics necessary for inclusion in the agreements that 
precede the implementation. 
  B. Topics that we will continue to discuss but that are 
not in existing agreements; these are topics that will not 
prevent us from implementing the agreement. This is how we are 
working. I believe we have reached agreement on most solutions 
and basic points. Anything on which agreement is reached and 
which is signed must not be reopened for discussion. For 
example, the Declaration of Principles that we signed in 
Washington and the Cairo agreement and the maps appended to it 
will not be reopened for discussion. If we do this, we will be 
going around in a vicious circle. We have already wasted a lot 
of time discussing matters on which agreement had been reached 
in the previous two agreements. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] Certain reports say that if no agreement is 
reached by the end of this month, you will implement what was 
actually agreed upon. 
  [Rabin] We must sign an agreement that it is possible to 
implement. In other words, when we hold negotiations over peace 
with an Arab state, the agreement should be clear. Our 
negotiations must revolve around the meaning of peace, the issue 
of borders, the security arrangements, the stages of the 
implementation of the agreement, and whether the various stages 
will overlap in a way similar to what happened with Egypt. 
  But what we are trying to do with the Palestinians is 
peaceful coexistence without division or clear lines, because 
there are no dividing lines. For example, as regards the route 
between Gaza and Jericho and which falls within Israel's 
borders, we must allow the Palestinians to use this route. We 
must, therefore, agree on the security arrangements concerning 
this point. This is more difficult than reaching a peace 
agreement with Jordan, Lebanon, or even Syria. The agreement 
with the Palestinians is a temporary one, for self-rule. We 
have approved many of the Palestinians' demands because we don't 
want to waste time in search of this or that change. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] Did you start any unofficial secret talks with 
Syria as you did with the PLO far from the press and spotlights? 
  [Rabin] As far as I recall, we tried to arrange a quiet 
meeting with the Syrians. But they refused. I believe that 
without a quiet and unannounced meeting, it would be difficult 
to reach an agreement. Recent history explains this. Since 
1977, no agreement has been reached without holding unannounced 
preliminary contacts. Even President Anwar al-Sadat's visit to 
Jerusalem could not have been made had it not been for the 
unpublicized preliminary talks between al-Tuhami [an adviser to 
al-Sadat] and Moshe Dayan in Morocco during the summer of 1977. 
It was a long time before the majority of the Israeli cabinet 
members knew about these talks. The same thing happened with 
the other Arab countries. Let me say frankly, it would have 
been impossible to reach agreement with any Arab state and the 
PLO without the secret talks that preceded the publicized talks. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] Does the long calm on the Syrian front mean 
that 
Syria is fully concerned with peace and that President al-Asad 
is fully prepared for peace? And do you believe that Syria 
could accept something less than Egypt accepted during the 
complete withdrawal from the Egyptian territory? And is it 
conceivable that a government led by you could refuse to sign an 
agreement with Syria similar to that signed between the Likud 
and Egypt? 
  [Rabin] Let me tell you the real difference between the 
Egypt-Israel peace process and the situation between Syria and 
Israel. As regards Egypt, President al-Sadat took an extremely 
courageous step when he came to Israel. He managed to convince 
the Israeli people that there is an Egyptian leader who decided 
not to continue the war and confrontation and to get involved in 
the peace process and negotiations without this changing Egypt's 
view regarding the achievement of peace. 
  President al-Sadat did 80 percent of what was expected from 
the Israeli Government and the prime minister of that time in 
order to convince the Israeli people to pay the price of peace. 
The Israeli people hold the same feelings toward President 
Mubarak, who has for 12 and half years of the 15-year old peace 
between Egypt and Israel been safeguarding and promoting the 
peace process. 
  But President al-Asad has not done even one percent of what 
Egypt has done to establish peace. He did not even declare 
frankly his desire for peace. I agree with you that there are 
no acts of aggression on the Syrian-Israeli front. But had it 
not been for Syria's help, the 10 Palestinian rejectionist 
organizations led by Ahmad Jibril, Hawatimah, Habash, Abu-Musa, 
and others or even Hizballah would not be able to do what they 
are currently doing. Syria talks peace and at the same time 
allows these organizations to attack 'Arafat and the PLO because 
of their negotiations with Israel. Syria is not only hosting 
these organizations, but it also allows them to operate in 
Lebanon. Therefore, although Syria is not directly involved in 
acts of aggression against Israel, it has made it possible for 
them to act. These organizations would have never been able to 
act had it not been for Syria. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] Very well, Mr. Rabin. You said that when 
President Anwar al-Sadat came to Israel he did 80 percent of the 
Israeli Government's work, because he persuaded the Israelis 
that he was serious about peace. What if another Arab leader, 
President Hafiz al-Asad for example, were to visit Israel? 
Perhaps you would later conclude that he failed to impress the 
Israeli public with his seriousness about peace? 
  [Rabin] It is not necessary for al-Asad or anyone else to 
come to Israel. Let me tell you something. Why have I 
insisted that Palestinian-Israeli negotiations take place in 
Cairo and not Washington? To avoid publicity. 
  Another thing. We believe that Egypt has done so much and we 
appreciate that. We appreciate what President Husni Mubarak and 
his government are doing to help the two sides, quietly and 
backstage. 
  When Syria went to the Washington talks, the talks were 
conducted on a relatively small scale. However, every 
journalist expected a statement to come out of every meeting. 
This is not the best way to work things out. The talks should 
begin unofficially, quietly, and away from the media. 
  I would not call for a meeting between me and President 
al-Asad tomorrow. Such a meeting would not be useful without 
quiet preparations. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] Reports speak of rapprochement between Israel 
and a number of Arab countries. Can you clarify the picture for 
us a little? 
  [Rabin] I believe that peace between Egypt and Israel is 
what 
broke the ice between Israel and Arab countries. Undeniably, 
Egypt is the largest and most important Arab country. In my 
modest opinion, Egypt has proved that peace can be achieved and 
maintained. 
  Another thing. When I took over as prime minister, the 
Madrid Conference formula was already in place. We did nothing 
to change that formula, but sought to create another channel. 
  We figured that the two keys to peace in the region are in 
the hands of the Palestinians and the Syrians. Jordan wants to 
be out in front [as published]. Lebanon does not want to do 
anything without Syria's approval. 
  We studied the situation and reached the conclusion that it 
is better to begin with the Palestinians on the basis of two 
conditions; one is mutual recognition and the second is a 
statement of principles. We made a historic change in our 
policy toward the PLO. This change was based on the conditions 
we agreed upon and later the letters of mutual recognition 
appended to the Declaration of Principles. 
  Once we moved toward implementing the Declaration of 
Principles, the ball started rolling. For example, the 
multilateral talks of the Water Committee will begin in Muscat, 
Oman, today. Early next month, the Arms Limitation Committee of 
the multilateral talks will meet in Qatar. This would have been 
unthinkable only a year and half ago. We have begun to see 
change and its continuation depends to a large extent on the 
Palestinians and the Syrians. 
  As for Morocco, it has a large Jewish community. Actually, 
there is unofficial normalization between Morocco and Israel. 
Israeli citizens can go to Morocco to try and improve economic 
ties between the two countries. Israeli tourists are also 
allowed into Morocco. 
  You must not forget that, in 1977, King Hassan helped 
organize a meeting between senior Egyptian and Israeli officials 
in Morocco, a meeting that helped set the peace process in 
motion. Although there are no diplomatic ties between Israel 
and Morocco, relations between us are good. 
  Our relations with Tunisia may not be quite as good as those 
with Morocco. But the mere fact that the PLO leadership is 
located in Tunisia and that many Israelis, particularly 
journalists, go there is a measure of the level of relations 
between the two countries. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] Do you believe that Russia still has a part to 
play in the peace process? 
  [Rabin] Russia is one of the two countries sponsoring the 
peace talks. I will visit Moscow on 24 April to meet President 
Yeltsin. Chairman 'Arafat will also visit Russia to meet Yeltsin 
on 18 and 19 of this month. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] Is there not a possibility of a meeting between 
you and 'Arafat in Moscow? 
  [Rabin] I do not think so. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] Is U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's visit to the region at the end of this month 
linked to the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement? 
  [Rabin] I do not think so. If we can reach an agreement 
during this time, it will be good. Christopher is coming to the 
region basically to give a boost to the multilateral talks. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] I would like to convey to you a message from 
the 
people of Gaza. I was there last week and saw for myself the 
extent of the people's suffering as a result of sealing off the 
Gaza Strip. The people in Gaza say that the recent acts of 
terrorism did not come from Gaza. The Israeli Army and police 
are imposing a security cordon around the city. Supplies of 
medicines and oxygen necessary for surgery have stopped and 
students are not going to their colleges and workers are not 
going to work. Will this continue? 
  [Rabin] This is untrue. I know nothing about the stoppage of 
medicine and oxygen supplies. I gave orders to supply the Gaza 
population with their needs. The territories were sealed only 
for those who come to work in Israel. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] Soldiers order drivers of vehicles carrying 
oxygen and heading for the Gaza Strip to go back. 
  [Rabin] There is absolutely no need for such measures. Even 
in Jerusalem we made special arrangements for doctors, nurses, 
and workers in Palestinian hospitals and Palestinians working 
for international organizations to go to work. All these 
workers obtained licenses enabling them to go to work. The same 
thing applies to Gaza. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] The Palestinians in Gaza are wondering why the 
Israeli Government is taking these measures right before its 
withdrawal and before the Palestinian authority undertakes its 
mission. Are these the good-neighborly relations that Israel is 
talking about? Israel is giving the worst picture of the future 
neighborly relations it is seeking. 
  [Rabin] Yes, but you must not forget that I do not know who 
will carry out the next terrorist operation. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] But you, Mr. Prime Minister, are meting out 
collective punishment that is harming innocent people. 
  [Rabin] I have no option but to continue sealing off the 
occupied areas in order to know what is going on and then to 
decide what I can do. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] Despite the security cordon imposed on the Gaza 
Strip, numerous acts of violence occurred recently. The 
Palestinians in Gaza are wondering about the use of this 
security seal. 
  [Rabin] You do not know the number of operations that have 
been foiled as a result of sealing off the territories. I told 
the Israelis that even after the territories were sealed off we 
could not completely prevent terrorist operations. In 
Jerusalem, for instance, the Palestinians used a vehicle with 
Israeli plates and were able to move in all parts of Israel. In 
certain areas the Israelis and Palestinians are only meters away 
from each other. There are no walls and we do not want walls. I 
would like to tell you as a fact that there are Israeli 
businessmen who have received Palestinian workers in the heart 
of Israel for months without obtaining a permit. We cannot 
search every house. In the two cases involving killing and 
violence, we found out that two Palestinians from Khan Yunus had 
been in Israel since December. The real problem is that the 
situation was so aggravated because of the Hebron massacre that 
certain members of terrorist organizations were aroused to the 
point that they decided in a moment of extreme anger to wield 
knives and hatchets to attack Israelis. Regrettably, no device 
has yet been invented to reveal man's inner intentions.

  [Excerpt] Yesterday Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin put a 
freeze on the accelerated timetable for the completion of the 
talks with the PLO which Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat agreed on during their meetings in 
Bucharest last week. In view of the prime minister's 
reservations, there is doubt that the Peres-'Arafat meeting, 
scheduled for 28 April in Cairo, will indeed take place as 
planned. The final decision regarding the date of that meeting 
has been put off until after Rabin returns from Russia on 28 
April. [passage omitted]

  [Text] At today's cabinet session, the ministers learned 
that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres disagree with regard to several understandings reached in 
the 'Arafat-Peres meetings in Bucharest last week. Foreign 
Minister Peres presented Prime Minister Rabin with the 
understandings this morning at Ben-Gurion Airport and several 
ministers told our correspondent Hayim Hecht that the meeting 
between the two men had been difficult. 
  According to one of the reports, Peres, speaking at today's 
cabinet session, said that the whole thing may not work. 
  After the cabinet meeting, Environment Minister Sarid 
asserted that there was no disagreement between the prime 
minister and the foreign minister. Sarid said that if 
accelerated, the negotiations could be concluded within two 
weeks. Sarid stressed that it had been agreed that no 
Palestinian prisoners with blood on their hands would be 
released. 
  Finance Minister Avraham Shohat told the cabinet of progress 
in narrowing the differences between Israel and the PLO at the 
economic talks in Paris. He stressed that Israel was opposed to 
the Palestinian demand that every time a closure was imposed, 
Israel must fund busy work projects in the territories in order 
to compensate the workers subsequently left unemployed. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1130 GMT on 24 April 
reports 
that "Israel agrees to permit three Palestinian police 
battalions to enter the Gaza Strip and Jericho 24 hours after 
the signing of the autonomy agreement. These battalions 
comprise 1,050 policemen. This was reported by our political 
correspondent Udi Segal." Our correspondent adds that "at 
today's cabinet session, Police Minister Moshe Shahal criticized 
the Army for not including the police in the discussions on 
security arrangements with the Palestinians. Acting Prime 
Minister Shim'on Peres expressed fears that 'Arafat's arrival in 
the territories would not be felt sufficiently and fail to 
herald a change in the eyes of the residents of the 
territories." The report notes that "Peres stressed the need to 
conclude the negotiations rapidly. Several ministers reported 
that the prime minister was adamant in his refusal to make any 
concessions on issues pertaining to the symbols of sovereignty 
sought by the Palestinians, such as stamps, Palestinian 
currency, and passports."

  [Text] Differences of opinion between Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres over 
negotiations with the Palestinians are centered on whether 
Israel must sign the agreement within two weeks. Our 
correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that Minister Peres in his 
talks with Yasir 'Arafat in Romania received the impression that 
if the agreement is not signed within two weeks, then, in his 
words, the whole thing will be a dead letter. Mr. Peres 
believes that the detailed negotiations on security should be 
finalized, the agreement signed, and the remaining issues worked 
out later. Mr. Rabin, on the other hand, believes that before 
the agreement is signed, issues touching on sovereignty, such as 
currency, stamps, and telephone dialing areas, should also be 
worked out. 
  Environment Minister Yosi Sarid said there is no dispute 
between Rabin and Peres. Minister Tzaban said the differences 
refer to the niceties, and Police Minister Shahal believes that 
the issue is a matter of different perspectives. He believes 
the full cabinet must be involved in the deliberations. Under 
the draft agreement Peres brought back from Romania, there will 
be a Peres-'Arafat meeting in Cairo on Thursday [28 April] in 
order to prepare a meeting between the Prime Minister Rabin and 
'Arafat next week. The only issues which will remain unresolved 
at the Rabin-'Arafat will be the size of the Jericho area and 
the location of the Palestinian policeman deployed on the Jordan 
River bridge.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO leader Yasir 
'Arafat will sign the Gaza and Jericho agreement in two weeks. 
This is the Israeli and PLO working assumption at the close of 
a series of Peres-'Arafat meetings, here in Bucharest. At the 
same time, a precise date was not set in order to avoid creating 
yet another sacred date which might eventually be desecrated. 
  Foreign Ministry officials regard the meetings here as an 
important juncture in the political process and the negotiations 
with the PLO. The local press exaggerated in its banner 
headlines describing the meetings as a major landmark in the 
process between Israel and the Palestinians. Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres told us what the target dates are at this point: 
  [Begin recording] [Peres] There are three dates we have 
agreed on: One, is that our delegation, headed by Major General 
Amnon Shahaq, will go to Cairo on 24 April to work with the 
Palestinian delegation all next week. On 25 April we will man 
the three delegations which will deal with coordinating the 
hand-over: the security liaison committee, the committee on 
joint patrols, and the committee on transferring administrative 
powers. The third date we agreed on is 2 May. On that date two 
major committees of the donor countries will meet in Cairo -- 
the committee on police affairs and the committee on current 
expenditure affairs -- without which the Palestinians cannot 
practically begin establishing their own administration. Should 
this be called for by the situation and the need arise, 'Arafat 
and myself will travel to Cairo over the weekend [not further 
specified] to prepare all that is needed for the conclusion of 
the process, the ending of which will be attended by Israel's 
prime minister and the PLO chairman in Cairo. 
  [Segal] In view of your discussions with 'Arafat here, can 
you at this stage estimate whether you will be able to conclude 
all the issues during the coming week and reach the signing 
stage? 
  [Peres] I believe it is possible, though absolutely not 
certain. This is the reason why we avoided fixing dates. We 
did not want to set a date only to later postpone it by a day or 
even an hour. Therefore, some of the dates are rigid while 
others are flexible. 
  [Segal] What is there still left to be concluded in the 
negotiations? 
  [Peres] Our delegation will carry with it a written paper on 
the issue of jurisdiction which will determine who will be tried 
where and for what. We have to conclude the issue of the 
composition of the Palestinian council and its powers. We need 
to conclude the issues of airspace and territorial waters. We 
still need to wrap up the economic issues, as well as the manner 
of the population registration in the form of identity cards or 
some other form of identification. The number of issues still 
pending is not negligible. 
  [Segal] Judging from your meetings with 'Arafat and his men, 
do you believe they are ready to enter the territory of Gaza and 
Jericho despite the problems they know they will encounter when 
they do? 
  [Peres] Bottom line, I would say they are. At the same 
time, they are worried and, to be honest, they also doubt our 
intentions. The doubts are unjustified, but I am only making a 
point. 
  [Segal] What is you view of Yasir 'Arafat after the 
meetings? Can he really control the territory? Can you today 
calm the Israeli public which is afraid and worried -- perhaps 
for good reason since the man has not yet proven himself on the 
ground -- regarding future developments? 
  [Peres] There is no doubt that of all the Palestinian 
leaders, 'Arafat is the most prominent and authoritative. It 
must be said that over the past several years, three or four, 
'Arafat has stepped down from the heights of declarations and 
out of the murderous stake outs onto the realistic grounds of 
negotiations. He will not receive all that he had stated in his 
declarations, although he may go on making them. It does not 
matter. In the end, he will compromise. A man should be judged 
by his deeds, not his words. [end recording] 
  Foreign Minister Peres will return to Israel tonight. Early 
tomorrow morning, he will hold a private meeting with Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin before the latter leaves on an official 
visit to Moscow. As acting prime minister, Peres will return 
straight into the hectic political scene surrounding the 
Histadrut Labor Union elections and, on 28 April, U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher will come to our region, and the 
focus of attention will shift to the Syrian track. 
  We asked Peres: Is there anything new in Rabin's remark that 
Israel will be willing to remove settlements from the Golan 
Heights in return for peace? 
  [Begin recording] [Peres] To some extent I believe there 
is. Still, I prefer a leader who does what he says to a leader 
who does the opposite of what he says. 
  [Segal] Are you referring to the late Menahem Begin? 
  [Peres] I do not feel comfortable with mentioning names, but 
the late Mr. Begin was not the only one. He had partners who 
still live among us. They made sky-high declarations while in 
practice they were left without a grain of Sinai sand under 
their shoes. 
  [Segal] Do you sincerely believe this is the price of peace 
with Syria? 
  [Peres] I would not like to comment on this. Look, we are 
at the very beginning of negotiations. I do not believe we need 
to say today everything that we intend to do. I do not believe 
we should come naked to the negotiations. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said that now, 
following Prime Minister Rabin's statements on the readiness to 
evacuate settlements on the Golan Heights in exchange for peace, 
Syrian President al-Asad had good reason to emit positive 
signals toward Israel. The foreign minister told our 
correspondent Hayim Hecht that the change indicated by Rabin's 
remarks lay in the statement itself and not in its content. The 
foreign minister added that the government realized that Syria 
was always slow to react.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin left for an official 
four-day visit to Moscow several minutes ago. Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres, who together with the rest of the cabinet 
ministers accompanied Rabin to his flight, said that very 
intensive negotiations with the Palestinians were expected this 
week. If everything went well, Peres said, the negotiations may 
be concluded this week. If this does not turn out to be the 
case, the foreign minister added, we will have to find ways to 
accelerate the talks. This was reported by our correspondent 
Yariv Ben-Yehuda from Ben-Gurion airport.

  [Text] The Syrians must finally understand that the prime 
minister is prepared to withdraw from practically the entire 
Golan Heights in exchange for full peace and appropriate 
security arrangements. This is the assessment of political 
circles in the wake of Rabin's recent statements. All this in 
anticipation of another Middle East shuttle by U.S. Secretary of 
State Christopher, a mission which does not raise many hopes. 
Israeli sources believe this is a premature and consequently 
unwarranted shuttle at this stage. The prime minister is 
departing for an official visit to Russia tomorrow. The foreign 
minister, who serve as acting-prime minister, returns tonight 
from Romania following his meetings with 'Arafat. Our political 
correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports: 
  Shim'on Peres, who is returning this evening, will travel to 
Cairo next weekend, where he will meet 'Arafat's deputy 
Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] and try to prepare the ground for a 
Rabin-'Arafat meeting in approximately two weeks -- a meeting in 
which the two may sign the agreement on IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. At the same time, 
more difficulties and delays are still expected to take place. 
  Rabin and Peres would prefer to implement the withdrawal 
from 
Gaza before making decisions on the Syrian track. Warren 
Christopher, however, is unwilling to accept any more delays. 
Christopher and his entourage will travel to the Middle East 
capitals next week and will arrive in Israel next Thursday, from 
where they will continue to Damascus. It is still unclear to 
where they will continue from there. Jerusalem sources express 
wonder about the timing of the trip, during which the signing of 
the agreement with the PLO is not expected to take place. 
Despite the slight expectations for an imminent breakthrough 
with Syria, Yitzhaq Rabin is increasingly clarifying his 
willingness to reach a compromise in the north. Now he is 
explicitly talking about a willingness to evacuate settlements 
and implement a deep withdrawal in exchange for peace. Most 
political circles in Israel are convinced that what Rabin is in 
fact signalling is as follows: Mr. al-Asad, now it is your 
turn. Prove to the Israelis you are heading toward full peace 
and willing to provide full security for Israel. I, for my part, 
will convince the Israelis that in exchange for this it is 
possible to implement a phased withdrawal from practically the 
entire Golan Heights. 
  Meanwhile Rabin will depart tomorrow for a first, four-day 
official visit of an Israeli prime minister to Russia, during 
which he will meet senior Russian leaders and representatives of 
the Jewish community. Rabin is not expected to have an easy 
time on the political level, because the Russians are insisting 
to have a more prominent role in our region -- this without an 
appropriate level of coordination with the United States. 
President Yeltsin is facing nationalist pressures. The new 
Russian power politics increasingly remind Israeli figures of 
the old Soviet Union's methods during its heyday, a period which 
brings back bad memories in Israel.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "In the Lion's Den"] </F>
  [Text] The prime minister's address at the United Kibbutz 
Movement [UKM] Central Committee in Ef'al on 21 April should not 
be seen as only an appendix to his remarks at the Knesset 
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee earlier last week. The 
remark was a pointed and profound expansion of the earlier 
statement. Rabin chose to address the UKM of all forums for a 
good reason; it is tantamount to a lion's den for a person who 
previously said that he does not accept the extent of withdrawal 
on the Golan Heights as recommended by the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] General Staff because it is too slight. 
  Yitzhaq Rabin did not tell the UKM where exactly the line of 
withdrawal he finds acceptable in terms of Israel's security 
needs lies and which takes "the necessitating political reality" 
into account. Rabin stressed that "the government is trying 
with all its might to struggle against repeating the precedent 
set by the Likud, which opposed a compromise (in the Sinai) and 
eventually gave everything back." The sincerity of this promise 
should not be doubted, yet he believed he should make clear the 
limited ability of the government to hold the line: 
"Settlements may be removed for peace, and I am for removing 
settlements for the sake of peace -- which is more important for 
the future of the State of Israel than such or other group of 
settlements." 
  Jerusalem political circles have for a long time maintained 
that al-Asad cannot accept the continued existence of 
settlements on the Golan Heights, even if the IDF totally 
withdraws from it. This assumption is probably based on 
reliable information. The above quoted remarks by the prime 
minister should have dispersed the remaining illusions the UKM 
may have entertained, and this is probably why they were made. 
  Yitzhaq Rabin can be trusted to place the security aspect in 
a prominent place among his consideration, but he does not cling 
to the myth attributing a decisive security weight to 
settlements. Collective memory cultivates the stories of heroism 
of Deganya, Negba, and Yad Mordekhay, while discarding the 
stories of the evacuation of 'Atarot, Neve Ya'aqov, and Bet 
Ha'arava, and the loss of the 'Etzyon Bloc in 1948. Without 
explicitly reminding the UKM members of what happened on the 
Golan Heights in 1973, Rabin taught them a lesson: "Tanks on 
the Golan and a strong air force are the main guarantee that war 
with Syria would be prevented; the truth must be said." 
  Rabin's Ef'al appearance can also be viewed as a move meant 
to assist the U.S. secretary of state on the eve of his Syria 
visit. The secretary should be equipped with evidence that 
Israel is willing to uproot settlements from the Golan Heights. 
Rabin's appearance at the UKM Central Committee was meant to 
encourage the U.S. mediator. The State Department's reaction 
indicates that this goal was achieved. The unanswered question 
remains, however, whether al-Asad would settle for a partial 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, even if it includes the 
evacuation of settlements. 
  It may well be that Rabin made the two gestures in vain, but 
even so, they are not unnecessary. A protest can be made 
against Rabin's statement that "if this year or by mid-1995 no 
progress is made with Syria and the Palestinians, the result 
might be military tension and political freeze." Such a warning 
might encourage al-Asad to insist on a full Israeli withdrawal. 
It appears, however, that Rabin believes that peace with Syria 
is the most solid guarantee against war with Syria, and that we 
should not be intimidated by the high price we might pay for the 
attainment of this goal. 
  Also, there is no telling whether al-Asad would be willing 
to 
make a territorial compromise on the Golan Heights should the 
United States in return eliminate Syria from the list of 
countries which support international terrorism and drug 
trafficking. Much will depend on the amount of pressure the 
secretary of state is willing to exert while in Damascus.

<F P=106> [Report by Shim'on Schiffer and correspondent in Bucharest </F>
Orly Azulay-Katz] 
  [Excerpts] Damascus' official papers yesterday praised 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's remark that he would be willing 
to evacuate settlements from the Golan in the framework of a 
peace agreement. [passage omitted] 
  Last night, Jerusalem received the Syrian reaction to 
Rabin's 
remarks with satisfaction. Political sources view the Syrian 
statements as a reply to Rabin's "public diplomacy" vis-a-vis 
Damascus. [passage omitted] 
  Jerusalem hopes that, during his upcoming visit to the 
region, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will take 
advantage of both countries' reciprocal signals and work to 
promote the arrangement between Syria and Israel. [passage 
omitted] 
  Yesterday in Bucharest, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres told 
YEDI'OT AHARONOT that when he met PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, 
the latter asked: "Why did Rabin say he is willing to remove 
settlements from the Golan in return for peace, and is unwilling 
to evacuate settlers for peace with the Palestinians.?" 
  Peres: "I explained that Rabin's remarks are not solely 
related to the Golan Heights, but to all sectors. We are all in 
favor of the principle of territories for peace, but there is no 
need to deal with evacuating settlements at this time. I was 
very glad to hear that Rabin himself corrected his remarks the 
next day. Otherwise, his statement could have harmed the 
negotiations with the Palestinians." 
  Peres was referring to Rabin's clarification that leaving 
Jewish residents under Syrian sovereignty on the Golan would be 
irresponsible. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sharp reactions to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's 
remarks concerning his willingness to remove Golan settlements 
for the sake of peace have been voiced in the Golan settlements 
and the political establishment. The Golan Heights Settlements 
Committee says the remarks undermine the existence of all the 
settlements in the north and raise a question about the 
country's future. 
  Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu says Rabin's remarks 
attest 
to the total political collapse of a weak prime minister. Rabin 
disavows his commitment to the settlements' continued existence 
and the control of the Golan in the peace era as well, Knesset 
Member [MK] Netanyahu says. 
  The Tzomet faction is demanding that the prime minister 
announce immediate elections in order to allow the people to 
decide whether Golan settlements should be removed. MK Refa'el 
Eytan says that Rabin has apparently been lying to the nation 
for a long time. 
  The National Religious Party says the prime minister is 
forfeiting the Jewish people's assets like a political greenhorn.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has authorized the 
entry of another 4,000 Palestinian laborers from the territories 
to work in Israel. Approximately half of them will be employed 
in industry while the other half will work in agriculture. This 
authorization applies to married Palestinians over the age of 27 
who have worked in Israel for over five years. 
  Our correspondent 'Ofra Nehman notes that with the addition 
of these workers, the number of laborers from the territories 
working in Israel is now equal to the number of those employed 
prior to the decision to impose a full closure.

  [Excerpt] With about a 24-hour delay, Knesset Members 
[MK's] Hayim Ramon, 'Amir Peretz, and Shmu'el Avital today 
received letters expelling them from the Labor party. The 
letters, sent by the Labor headquarters, advised them that under 
the party constitution, they are no longer Labor members. The 
other Labor members included in Ramon's Histadrut elections list 
will receive similar letters after the headquarters check the 
matter with each of them. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 
1600 GMT on 21 April cites the Labor spokesman as saying that 
"the Ramon list includes 25 Labor members, and they will receive 
expulsion letters tonight and tomorrow. MK Ramon has said that 
the list he had submitted to the election committee includes 300 
to 400 Labor members."] 
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin again attacked the 
Ramon list which, he said, is liable to harm the peace process. 
Addressing the United Kibbutzim Movement convention in Ramat 
Ef'al today, the prime minister again warned: Ramon and his 
list will harm the government operation. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ron Ben-Yishay: "Evincing Weakness"] </F>
  [Text] On paper our security and political situation looks 
quite encouraging. Strategic balances being published by the 
most respectable and serious international research institutes 
unequivocally state Israel can successfully confront any 
military threat, which means that its political bargaining power 
is also better than ever. Experts assess this situation will 
continue at least until Iran or Iraq purchase or develop nuclear 
bombs. The military-technical assessment, however, does not 
reflect the real situation, because it fails to take into 
consideration the dangerous erosion since the Six-Day War in the 
Israeli public's stamina during security crises and emergencies. 
  A public's or nation's endurance in emergency situations is 
reflected in its ability to maintain normal life, in a 
greater-than-usual willingness to join the national effort in 
overcoming the crisis, and in high morale. What we witnessed in 
Israel is the exact opposite. 
  The hysterical reaction to every terror attack indicates 
that 
a large proportion of the population -- actively encouraged by 
the opposition -- refuses to recognize the fact that the peace 
process is still not peace itself; that making peace is a 
difficult and lengthy process; that the political and military 
war of attrition being waged against us by the Palestinians and 
Syria during the negotiations process itself, is an inseparable 
part of making peace. 
  The historians who will research this phenomenon will 
probably reach the conclusion that the role of occupier and 
oppressor, forced on us after the Six-Day War, was one of the 
main factors causing us to have no faith in our national cause 
and harming our motivation to fight and suffer for this cause. 
Even those who reject this interpretation will find it hard to 
ignore or deny the symptoms: Instead of the public volunteering 
en masse to the Civil Guard, thus helping foil terrorism, we 
find that school trips are being canceled (even to places where 
there is no danger at all); instead of wide- scale 
demonstrations of national unity and determination, every terror 
attack results in whining, hysterics, and boundless abuse hurled 
at the government. 
  It does not take a military expert to realize that 
Palestinian and Lebanese terrorism is currently receiving a lot 
of positive feedback, a thing which only increases its activity. 
It also does not take a political expert to recognize the 
damage done to Israel's bargaining power in the negotiations. 
  The Likud and the right-wing parties, which encourage these 
demonstrations of national weakness and try to score political 
points from them, are evincing extraordinary shortsightedness. 
The erosion in public endurance will boomerang against them if 
and when they come to power. The same holds true for the 
settlers. Meanwhile, however, it is the government which is 
under pressure -- and those who come under pressure make 
mistakes. The eroding public support and the nearing elections 
are pushing Rabin and Peres into a corner from which they make 
decisions and issue statements which do not always serve 
Israel's vital interests. Rabin's statement on his agreement in 
principle to disband settlements on the Golan Heights is an 
excellent example of a premature concession made under pressure. 
  In war as in peace, he wins who has the higher motivation 
and 
endurance, even if the military balance of power is against him. 
Britain, for example, won World War II thanks to the British 
public's endurance during the German blitz on London; The Afghan 
Mujaheddin organization managed to beat a vastly superior 
Soviet- Afghan army; and let us admit: the Palestinians brought 
us to the negotiating table because they evinced great endurance 
and stamina during the intifadah. The ongoing erosion in the 
Israeli public's endurance harms our ability to achieve 
reasonable peace and security in the negotiations. This 
situation, however, is not irreversible. With the help of an 
intensive information campaign, the government can change the 
national mood and cause the public to show more understanding 
toward its moves and a situation wherein political negotiations 
are being conducted alongside a war of attrition.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Husayn-Christopher Meeting and the Sought </F>
Success"] 
  [Text] There are positive signs in the American position 
indicating that the scheduled meeting between His Majesty King 
Husayn and U.S. Secretary of State Christopher will be a success. 
  The recent statements by President Clinton and Christopher 
on 
the cordial relations between Jordan and Washington and the 
siege of al-'Aqabah show that the U.S. Administration 
understands, or almost understands, the great damage inflicted 
by the embargo on Jordan's economy and trade. 
  Furthermore, there is remarkable U.S. interest in activating 
the peace process and ending the crises on all tracks. 
  We hope the U.S. secretary will bring something new 
regarding 
the U.S. stand vis-a-vis the siege imposed on Jordan. The 
lifting of the siege would rejuvenate Jordanian enthusiasm on 
role its in the peace process, particularly if Israel agrees to 
discuss all unresolved issues, such as water, borders, refugees, 
and Jerusalem. 
  The important thing is to see the U.S. Administration end 
its 
bias toward Israel and work to force Israel to hold negotiations 
based on withdrawal from all occupied Arab territory in 
accordance with Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 
and the land for peace formula. 
  The success of the Husayn-Christopher meeting in London 
today 
will be an important indicator of U.S. interest in activating 
the peace process and rendering it a success on all tracks. 
During his meeting with the U.S. secretary today, King Husayn 
will speak in the name of all cordon states and will reiterate 
the principles of the Arab position with regard to the 
Jordanian, Syrian, and Lebanese tracks on the basis of the 
resolutions of international legitimacy. 
  We hope Secretary Christopher will respond to this position.

<F P=106> [Article by JORDAN TIMES Staff Reporter Ayman al-Safadi] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Jordan and the United States are unlikely to 
resolve their conflict over the U.S.-led naval blockade of 
al-'Aqabah this week despite assurances by U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher that he will present His Majesty King 
Husayn with "some suggestions" to ease the burden on Jordan of 
the sanctions against Iraq, sources said Friday. 
  The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said any 
resolution to the dispute will have to be worked out in the 
Washington-based negotiations of the Jordanian proposal to 
replace the sea-inspections of al-'Aqabah bound shipping with 
onshore inspection by the British company Lloyds Register. But 
negotiators are unlikely to reach a final agreement by Monday 
when Mr. Christopher is scheduled to meet with King Husayn in 
London, the sources said. 
  Jordan made its proposal in January after rejecting a U.S. 
proposal in August to have the international naval forces 
enforcing the embargo on Iraq conduct their inspection in 
al-'Aqabah as an encroachment upon its sovereignty. 
  Sources told the JORDAN TIMES that the United States had 
accepted the Jordanian proposal in principle but bureaucratic 
and technical problems have delayed an agreement. 
  Jordanian officials brushed aside these "pretexts," saying 
the blockade is part of U.S. pressure on Jordan to coerce it 
into signing a separate peace treaty with Israel. They said 
that the Central intelligence Agency (CIA) was opposing any 
easing of the blockade on Jordan as its position is still 
influenced by the Kingdom's stand during the Gulf crisis. 
  King Husayn in March linked Jordan's return to the 
Arab-Israeli peace talks to the lifting of the siege on 
al-'Aqabah. 
  Sources say the King's strong stand on the issue might have 
highlighted the importance of the issue to Jordan among U.S. 
officials who had not seen the significance that the Kingdom 
attached to it. 
  Officials and shipping sources say the blockade, which has 
produced strong anger against the United States among 
Jordanians, has incurred enormous economic losses on the Kingdom 
despite its adherence to the sanctions against Iraq. 
  Officials point to the non-existence of inspection 
operations 
against neighbouring countries which have trade links with Iraq 
as proof that the al-'Aqabah blockade is intended to pressure 
Jordan. 
  "The fact that we are singled out and nobody is interested 
in 
finding out what trade with Iraq goes out from Turkey, Syria and 
Iran is an indelible proof that the purpose is to pressure 
Jordan," Jordanian official said. 
  Jordanian officials said the U.S. has also been exercising 
pressure on Jordan by demanding that the Kingdom take action 
against companies which it alleges are acting as a front for 
Iraq. 
  The official said the U.S. had been using "non-paper 
diplomacy" with Jordan by providing it with lists of companies 
that it claims are working for Iraq and demanding action against 
them. 
  But after investigating these companies, officials said, the 
government found nothing illegal about their operations and 
informed the United States that the Kingdom cannot take any 
action against them because they are violating neither Jordanian 
laws nor the sanctions regime against Iraq. 
  One official said the U.S. has linked a solution to the 
al-'Aqabah siege to a crack down on these companies whose number 
could not be determined. 
  "The U.S. is applying double pressure on Jordan. It is 
applying gunboat diplomacy and non-paper diplomacy," said 
prominent Parliament Member 'Abd al-Karim al-Kabariti. 
  But the U.S. Embassy in Amman denied that there is any link 
between the two situations. 
  "The (U.S.) embassy denies the link between the alleged list 
or lists of Iraqi companies and the discussions between Jordan 
and the United States to alleviate the economic burden" on 
Jordan from the inspection operations in al-'Aqabah, said an 
embassy official. 
  Sources said that some U.S. agencies were not satisfied with 
the mechanism through which Jordan investigated the operations 
of the alleged front companies for Iraq. They added that some 
U.S. departments involved in the negotiations over the 
inspection operations want to see Jordan take action against 
these companies as a proof of the "reliability" in enforcing the 
sanctions against Iraq. 
  But Jordanian officials rejected these explanations, 
insisting that like the siege on al-'Aqabah, demands for action 
against these companies are part of the pressure the U.S. has 
been applying on Jordan to achieve political goals.

  [Text] Al-'Aqabah -- Citizens here question the seriousness 
of the government in rejecting the U.S. blackmail practiced by 
Washington against Jordan through its warships' siege on the 
Jordanian port, which has inflicted huge economic damage on the 
homeland and citizens. 
  Three days after King Husayn's announcement on the issue of 
al-'Aqabah, the U.S. reaction was an escalation in the piracy of 
the U.S. fleet that is besieging the port and preventing many 
ships from reaching it. 
  Instead of hardening the Jordanian stand, which was 
announced 
by his majesty the king and largely supported by the Jordanians, 
we noticed that our government has ignored all this and received 
the U.S. warship "USS John Hancock" and its officers and sailors 
in the port that they are besieging. The officers and sailors 
of this U.S. warship were warmly welcomed by officials and were 
provided with recreation facilities. After relaxing in our 
country, they returned to continue their siege through their 
piracy and arrogance. 
  Popular organizations, trade unions, women's and student's 
federations, and political forces in al-'Aqabah sent a cable to 
the prime minister and to the speakers and members of the 
Parliament on 12 April in which they protested the visit to the 
Port of al-'Aqabah by a U.S. warship. The cable reads: 
  Allowing the enemies of the nation -- whom we are still 
fighting -- to anchor their fleet ships at our ports, land their 
military planes at our airports, and send their troops to our 
country for rest and recreation is a blatant betrayal of our 
citizens' feelings and disregards their honorable pan-Arab 
stands.

<F P=106> ["Special to the JORDAN TIMES" by Ian Atalla] </F>
  [Excerpt] Amman--The United Kingdom feels that the current 
U.N. enforced naval blockade of al-'Aqabah should be modified, 
said British Ambassador to Jordan Peter Hinchcliffe Saturday [23 
April] at the Amman Chamber of Commerce (ACC). 
  "My government has felt for some time that the blockade is 
excessive, and that Jordan is suffering as a result," said Mr. 
Hinchcliffe. "We would like to see a change in the method of 
how the U.N. regulations are enforced." 
  "As well, British exports to Jordan have suffered as a 
result 
of this blockade," Mr. Hinchcliffe said at the ACC meeting with 
a visiting commercial delegation of the South of England 
Exporters Association (SEEA). 
  Mr. Hinchcliffe spoke after ACC President Muhammad 'Asfur 
emphasised to the ambassador and the SEEA delegation Jordanians' 
sense of indignation and frustration towards the blockade, and 
said that since it had begun, "some 1,800 ships have come to 
al-'Aqabah, and not one ship was found in violation of the U.N. 
resolutions." 
  Members of the ACC also said that more ways should be found 
to address the vastly unequal trade balance between the two 
nations. Where England exported JD 127.9 million worth of goods 
and services to Jordan in 1993, according to available 
statistics, Jordanian exports to England totalled a mere JD 2.5 
million in the same period. 
  The ACC suggested an increase in joint venture projects 
between Jordan and Britain to the SEEA delegation as a means 
towards alleviating the current situation, but Mr. 'Asfur 
cautioned that "we have suffered before in such programmes." 
[passage omitted] 
  Mr. Hinchcliffe told the ACC group that Britain was 
currently 
working on drawing up a number of mutual tax agreements with 
Jordan which would add to facilitating trade between the two 
countries. 
  The SEEA delegation arrived in Amman Friday evening after a 
visit to Lebanon, and will stay in Jordan until April 26.

  [Text] Sources at the French Embassy in Amman reiterated 
France's position, which supports and understands the Jordanian 
proposals on stopping naval inspections off the Port of 
al-'Aqabah and moving the inspections into the port while 
maintaining the effectiveness of trade sanctions imposed on Iraq. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-DUSTUR, these sources said 
France supports in principle inspections on land, saying this 
will ease the economic burden on Jordan caused by ship 
inspections in the Red Sea. 
  These sources called for expediting measures to end the 
restrictions imposed on free navigation into the Port of 
al-'Aqabah, and pointed out His Majesty King Husayn's position 
on this subject, which calls for lifting and easing these 
measures before Jordan returns to the negotiations table. 
  The sources emphasized that France has held several contacts 
with Jordan on this issue in its capacity as a country directly 
concerned in this subject, in addition to contacts France has 
conducted with European countries and the United States in order 
to reach an agreement on the ideal way to carry out inspections 
and ease the burden on Jordan.

<F P=106> [Article by the political editor: "Jordan Is A Homeland, Not </F>
An Eggshell; They Are Threatening Us With The Blockade and 
Tomorrow Will Ask Us For More; If We Do Not Resist Now, We Will 
Never Resist"] 
  [Text] Each time, they used to tell us: Our country is 
targeted, in terms of its regime, stability, and political 
entity. However, we are still the most ancient state in Arab 
Asia, according to the modern concept of the state. In a few 
years from now, Jordan's political age will be three-quarters of 
a century. Archaeologists, moreover, have found in 'Ayn Ghazal a 
fine agricultural settlement established around the Amman waters 
more than 6,000 years ago. 
  They used to say Jordan was targeted. We knew our country 
was targeted. However, they told us this to instill fear in our 
hearts and make us silent. This is because it is natural for 
us, when the homeland is in danger, to mobilize the sons of the 
homeland to defend its security, stability, and political 
entity, rather than be afraid and remain silent. 
  For years now, the U.S. blockade has been eating away our 
country. Before Tawfiq Qa'war [president of the Jordanian 
Shipping Agents Association] raised his voice, a colleague of 
ours at AL-RA'Y came to us with photos taken by the captain of a 
ship that was bound for al-'Aqabah with metal pipes on board. 
The photos show clearly how the U.S. Navy was throwing the 
pipes into the sea because the "telephone number of the 
Jordanian importer on the shipping papers was nor legible." The 
captain of the ship, who is a foreigner, gave the pictures to 
the press because he was angry and wanted to enrage the public 
and show the world the vileness of U.S. force. However, our 
government remained silent. 
  When Tariq Masarwah wrote in AL-RA'Y and when Tawfiq Qa'war 
gave a statement to AL-RA'Y on everything that was happening in 
the Gulf of Aqaba, we heard many officials say: "Brothers, our 
country is targeted, so please let us wisely handle this 
question with Washington." 
  Voices of protest got louder and the "wise handling" of the 
affair continued. Christopher then came twice to our country 
and he promised that "the subject will be reviewed." At an 
Amman hotel, Christopher gave us glad tidings about future 
prosperity and affluence once peace is established. When one of 
those who attended the dinner -- during which Christopher gave 
the glad tidings -- raised the question of the al-'Aqabah 
blockade, the eloquent boy said "his government will look at 
this issue with compassion". The problem exacerbated and the 
measures of the blockade doubled after each promise. 
  His majesty the king, known for his legendary patience, 
discussed the question of the blockade with the U.S. President. 
His royal highness the crown prince also raised the question of 
the blockade when he visited the United States. They told us: 
Let him shake hands with a criminal like Shim'on Peres and we 
will ease the burden of Jordan's debts on the economy and we 
will lift the blockade of al-'Aqabah. And so we accepted the 
image of our decent, respectable prince extend his hand to a 
killer for the good of our country. However, nothing happened 
and the blockade was tightened and words of caution also 
increased, such as: Brothers, there is no need for harsh talk 
in the press because our country is targeted. 
  When things came to a head, his majesty the king summoned 
the 
ambassadors of the five permanent Security Council member 
states. He delivered an unequivocal message: We cannot continue 
to participate effectively in the peace process while pressure 
and the blockade are continuing against us. 
  Quickly, those who are "concerned" about Jordan more than 
King Husayn started to explain the king's words and once again 
gave us their magical sentence: Brothers, our country is 
targeted, so let us work quietly. Do you want us to clash with 
the United States? 
  What strange words. The blockade has been in place for more 
than two and one-half years and losses have amounted to a 
billion dollars. How much longer will the people accept the 
seriousness of this quiet, wise approach? 
  The people do not want to fight America. However, they are 
asked to defend their country's interests in the face of the 
tyrant. Washington is using pressure to force us to be the next 
meal, so as to devour us after the Palestinians. The embargo 
against Iraq is a lie. It is no secret that we are with Iraq 
and with the Iraqis who are being starved by the embargo, and 
with the Iraqis who give us oil, while they are in a situation 
which we know very well. Are we exporting to Iraq 
Jordanian-made tanks, missiles, and nuclear reactors? 
  We said to ourselves that the multilateral negotiations on 
water issues will be held in Muscat on 17 April, so why don't we 
show up, especially since these negotiations, in the absence of 
Syria and Lebanon, are no more than an distasteful symposium 
used by Israeli media to show Israelis tell lies in an Arab 
capital, while killing the Arabs of Palestine on the streets and 
in the mosques. Once again, we heard the handy sentence: 
Brothers, our country is targeted. We will send a very 
low-level observer, not a negotiator, maybe a third secretary at 
the embassy. 
  Washington and Tel Aviv do not want a Jordanian negotiator, 
because there are no negotiations. So why don't we declare our 
boycott of the multilaterals and deliver a clear threat to 
boycott the bilaterals? 
  Following his majesty's meeting with the five ambassadors in 
Amman, Washington expedited the meetings of its subcommittee 
that is in charge of the al-'Aqabah blockade. But following the 
clever statement that "interpreted the king's words" and 
"declared the government's support for it" Washington postponed 
the meetings of the subcommittee. It was clear that it would 
drag this question to the Muscat meetings to break his majesty's 
position. 
  This week, we have seen viler U.S. and Israeli behavior. The 
blockade was tightened. Rabin and Peres have warned our country 
because a Hamas statement about the Hadera operation came from 
Amman, just as it was issued from London and from every place 
where there is a fax machine. U.S. newspapers and news 
magazines have started to talk about the smuggling of U.S. 
military technology via Jordan and Jordan's import of 
sophisticated U.S. monitoring equipment that can pick up U.S. 
military contacts in the region. 
  This indecent, off-color talk is full of ill-concocted lies 
that are strangely in harmony with the statements made by those 
"concerned" about Jordan in Amman when they say: Brothers, our 
country is targeted. Brothers, give us a chance to work out 
things quietly, etc. 
  But how are you going to resolve these problems? Has the 
al-'Aqabah blockade been lifted? Do you believe that Hamas is 
in Amman when you see with your own eyes that it is in 'Afula, 
Gaza, and Hadera? Do we have monitoring equipment that can pick 
up the contacts of U.S. fleets and aircraft? If a U.S. firm is 
smuggling technology to Iraq, then do you want to keep it from 
smuggling in Amman? Why don't the Americans themselves prevent 
it? 
  The problem is that U.S. and Israeli pressures have a 
serious 
parallel trend on the local scene. This parallel trend attracts 
groups in banks, markets, and Amman's velvet salons. Those 
people are "concerned" about Jordan, while all of them despise 
Jordan's interests, dignity, and Arabism. The measure they 
adopt is: The financial market has come to a standstill; real 
estate prices are falling; capital is worried, and all such 
off-color, vile talk that turns the concept of a homeland into 
one of a tourist and a hotel. 
  We say: When the homeland is targeted, what is required is 
to sharpen the people's national will to defend their homeland; 
and when Jordan's stability is targeted, then courage, not 
cowardice, is the shield of the homeland and the citizen. 
  When Washington and Tel Aviv threaten our interests and 
destiny, then our reaction should be: No. We should not submit 
and give in. They are threatening us with the blockade because 
they will ask us for more tomorrow. If we do not resist now, we 
will not resist tomorrow. 
  Those who show "concern" laugh when we say: Our people. 
They also laugh when we say: Our national will and the dignity 
of our country. And if they condescend and reply to us, they 
will say without any shame: Brothers, where do you live? Have 
you not seen what happens to those who say no? But when we ask 
them: Can you tell us what happens to those who say yes, they 
turn their faces away. 
  We say: Our country is not an eggshell. It is a true 
homeland that deserves our fighting any party for its good.

<F P=106> [Report by Fahd al-Rimawi] </F>
  [Text] Royal Court Chief al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir returned 
quickly to his palace in al-Hummar [near Amman] when he learned 
that his guests had arrived. The guests were received by his 
friend [former minister] Ibrahim 'Izz-al-Din, while another 
friend, Dhuqan al-Hindawi, member of the Senate, also arrived 
early for the luncheon. 
  Al-Sharif Zayd was late because he was attending the 
celebration on the completion of the al-Aqsa reconstruction 
work, which took place on Monday [18 April]. On the same day, 
the chief of the Royal Court hosted a working luncheon for a 
delegation of the Islamic Action Front [IAF], including Dr. 
Ishaq al-Farhan [secretary general of the IAF], Dr. 
'Abd-al-Latif 'Arabiyat [member of the Senate], and Deputy Dr. 
'Abdallah al-'Akayilah, to discuss the developments between the 
government and the Hamas Movement. 
  Abu-Shakir [Zayd Bin-Shakir] began by saying that the 
confiscation of the passports of [Hamas officials] Muhammad 
Nazzal and Ibrahim Ghawshah is the last measure to be taken by 
the Jordanian Government against Hamas leaders. He added that 
the government has no intention of taking any repressive 
measures, such as the closing down of the Hamas offices or the 
deportation of its leaders from Jordan. 
  Al-Sharif Zayd then hinted that this measure was taken not 
out of a Jordanian conviction, but under Israeli-American 
pressure on the eve of Christopher's shuttle tour of the Middle 
East. He then said: We provided the Hamas leaders with security 
protection in their capacity as Jordanian citizens. 
  Dr. 'Arabiyat, who did not speak much during the luncheon, 
noted that the Israeli-U.S. objective for which they are 
exerting pressure on Jordan and Hamas is to peddle the Oslo 
accord, remove all obstacles on its road, and strike at national 
unity in the Jordanian arena by driving a wedge between the 
government and the Islamic current. 'Arabiyat added: We, in 
both sides, should remain alert and prevent the schemes and 
attempts to drive wedges from affecting our ranks. 
  Dr. 'Abdallah al-'Akayilah spoke more frankly than the 
others. After joking with al-Sharif Zayd more than once, he 
reiterated the strong relationship between the Jordanian rule 
and the Islamic Movement. He then firmly asked that the 
restrictions on Hamas leaders not exceed the confiscation of 
passports and that the confiscation be temporary, until the 
Israeli-U.S. storm calms down. Al-'Akayilah then smartly warned 
against striking at the fundamentalists like Egypt, Algeria, and 
Tunisia. 
  Dr. Ishaq al-Farhan briefly touched on the ideological 
aspect 
of the issue and called for coherence and solidarity, not 
estrangement, between the various forces and currents. He also 
called for coherence and solidarity from top to bottom under 
these delicate Jordanian and Arab conditions. 
  Dr. al-Farhan said: The IAF has begun an effort to close 
ranks and to lay down a political framework that would include 
all nationalists and Islamists in Jordan now that all illusions 
about a contradiction between Arabism and Islam have been 
disproved. 
  Al-Sharif Zayd, who looked strong and confident in his role 
in bridging gaps and running things, and who was pleased with 
the poem presented by Haydar Mahmud [Jordan's ambassador to 
Tunisia] at the Dome of the Rock renovation celebration, told 
his guests at the end of the working luncheon, which lasted four 
hours, that he would brief his majesty the king on what took 
place during the working luncheon and that he intentionally 
invited them to have lunch at his house instead of meeting them 
at his office. He added that he wanted the meeting, which was 
requested by the Islamists, to be separated from protocol and 
journalists so that the relationship between the leaders and the 
Islamic Movement could remain cordial and fraternal and based on 
dialogue and understanding regardless of the different views and 
interpretations.

  [Text] Mashhad (Khorasan), April 22, IRNA -- Doctors at the 
Qaem hospital here have described the condition of Friday prayer 
leader Mohammad Abaei Khorasani, as "satisfactory". Hojjat 
ol-eslam Abaei who substituted as the Friday prayer leader 
today, was shot at by a lone gunman just as he had finished the 
sermon. 
  "Luckily the bullets hit the back of his shoulder and did 
not 
cause him any serious injury," said Dr. Fattahi the Mashhad 
representative to the National Parliament (Majlis) who happens 
to be a specialist surgeon by profession. 
  The terrorist tried to shoot himself and was injured badly 
when faced with the fury of the worshippers. He was immediately 
whisked away by law officials.

  [Text] Tehran, April 24, (IRNA) -- National security 
director general at the Information Ministry, Musavi-Nejad said 
in an interview here today that the terrorist who shot and 
wounded the Mashhad Friday prayer leader had links with the 
"Munafiqeen (Hypcrites) Khalq Outfit" (MKO). 
  He identified the attacker as Ali Houri nick-named "Popi" 
from the Haft Tappeh region of Khuzestan in southwest Iran. 
  Houri after his failed assassination bid against Hojat 
ol-eslam Mohammad Abaei Khorasani just after the latter had 
finished his Friday prayer sermons, tried to shoot himself to 
escape the fury of the worshippers. 
  Musavi-Nejad said the attacker who underwent surgery at Imam 
Redha (AS) hospital had shot himself with the idea of committing 
suicide. 
  Hoj. Abaei Khorasani who was struck by two bullets on the 
back of his shoulder, is recovering at Qaem hospital where he 
was operated upon after the attack. A third bullet fired by the 
attacker missed the prayer leader and injured a theology student. 
  The Information Ministry official asked to comment on the 
motives of the attack, said the MKO because of its nature will 
not abandon its terrorism. Moreover, he said, it has reached a 
deadlock in Iraq. 
  Musavi-Nejad recalled that at the outbreak of the Iraqi war 
(1980-88), the MKO shouted slogans against Saddam Husayn but 
soon, however, it became attached to Saddam Husayn. 
  He said that during the past two years the MKO had conducted 
blasts along the Iran-Iraq border in the name of the masses. He 
said the MKO selected young persons in the country with promises 
and encouraged them to carry out terrorist operations. 
  Musavi said those that cooperate with MKO will be considered 
as being against the security of the country and will be 
prosecuted. 
  Regarding the reason why the MKO is looking for people 
inside 
the country for terrorist operations he said there were many 
reasons. 
  "One of those reasons is, the MKO wants to propagate that it 
has cells inside the country, whereas it is not so. The second 
reason is, the people deceived by the MKO are without previous 
records and if they did anything the MKO can deny their 
terrorist acts," he said. 
  The third reason is that the group has been under pressure 
since its flight from the country and considers this a way for 
its presence. 
  The fourth reason, added Musavi-Nejad, such people are 
considered to be forces at no cost, and the MKO without 
incurring any expenditure exploits them. 
  He said the grouplet is not even willing to pay for the 
costs 
of exit from Iran of its people and they steal the jewelery of 
their mothers or borrow from friends to go abroad. 
  These measures of the MKO, he said, are exactly the 
expectation of Iraq which has always planned subversive 
operations in the Islamic Republic. 
  About the writer of the past regime, Saeedi Sirjani, and his 
fate, the Information Ministry official said, Sirjani was 
arrested along with an accomplice named Mohammad Sadeq Saeed, 
with the nickname Niaz Kermani, for involvement in a drug ring 
and for acts against public decency, and both of them have 
confessed of their acts. 
  The two principal accused persons, he said, have been 
interrogated by the ministers of information for cooperation 
with Savak and for involvement in it. 
  He said both Saeedi and Niaz Kermani had connections with 
Savak, the Shah's notorious secret service, after the triumph of 
the Islamic revolution 
  Musavi-Nejad said the two have already confessed to such 
charges as drug trafficking, making and possessing alcoholic 
beverages, sodomy, conncections with a group of savak-related 
army officers that were involved with the Nowzheh State coup, 
and receipt of [word indistinct] amount of foreign exchanges 
from anti-revolutionary elements in the United States and Europe. 
  He said investigations are under way in that connection.

  [Text] United Nations Hq. (New York), April 22, IRNA -- 
Iran's permanent representative of Iran to the U.N. Kamal 
Kharrazi, last night said if the Security Council had reacted 
"promptly and vigorously" when its first resolution had been 
violated by the Serbs, the Bosnian people would have been spared 
the present catastrophe. 
  Condemning the world body's attitude towards the savage 
attacks on Bosnia-Herzegovina by the Serbs, Kharrazi said at the 
open session of the Security Council that the U.N. failure to 
shoulder its responsibility in the face of continued Serbian 
aggression could not be ignored. "The fact the Council has tied 
the hands of the victims so that they cannot exercise their 
inherent rights of self-defense cannot be be overlooked," he 
said. 
  The Iranian added that in fact the "Serbs have been given 
the 
green light to continue to slaughter the defenseless people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina." Referring to the worsening situation 
particularlly in the besieged city of Gorazde, he said that 
under such circumstances, the Council has only "one option that 
is lift and strike," as all other mechanisms designed to defend 
civilians have failed. 
  "Those who oppose lifting the arms embargo against B-H, are 
certainly responsible, at least partially, for all innocent 
lives perished in the Serbian atrocities," Kharrazi made it 
clear. 
  He said "there is no justification whatsoever, on legal or 
moral grounds, for the continuation of the unjust arms embargo 
against Bosnia." 
  The inaction and indecisiveness of the UN in countering 
aggression coupled with the persistence of certain Council 
members in denying the inherent right of self-defense to the 
Bosnians, has made the Islamic world indignant, and brought 
under serious question the world body's credibility, he said. 
  "Public opinion in the Muslim, and in fact in the world at 
large, has seriously taken the credibility of the U.N. system 
into question and is urging the governments to take practical 
steps in defending their brethren in Bosnia-Herzegovina," added 
Kharrazi. "The Security Council is obliged to proclaim that the 
arms embargo is inapplicable to the republic of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina," he stated. 
  Criticizing the Council's Thursday draft resolution, which 
had called for an immediate cease-fire agreement in B-H and 
Gorazde as well as withdrawal of Serbian forces and their 
weapons from the city, Kharrazi said the document "lacks a clear 
threat" to the Serbs in the event of probable violation of the 
undertakings under the present draft. 
  The resolution has fallen short of addressing the critical 
situation of other declared safe areas as well as other parts of 
B-H, added the Iranian representative noting that paragraph four 
of the resolution was formulated in a such a way that it 
"equates the victim and the aggressor." He said such practice of 
the Council would only encourage the aggressors to continue 
their genocide throughout B-H. Kharrazi referred to the draft's 
call for the intensification of efforts to achieve peaceful 
settlement by the U.N., European Union, the United States and 
the Russian Federation and said that nothing would diminish the 
responsibility of the U.N. and particularly the Security Council 
in reversing the aggression committed by the Serbs.

  [Text] In today's meeting of the Supreme National Security 
Council, which was chaired by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani and 
was attended by all members and high ranking military 
commanders, the latest developments relating to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the tragedy of Gorazde were discussed. 
  The attacks and crimes of the Serbian forces were condemned 
and it was announced that the UN Security Council and countries 
that had given the aggressors a free hand by their indifference 
shared the blame for this immense human tragedy. 
  It was stressed in the meeting that, in view of the lack of 
seriousness shown by the United Nations and NATO regarding the 
defense of regions which had been declared as safe havens in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, our country's Foreign Ministry should act 
with even greater resolve towards strengthening the effective 
cooperation between Islamic countries with a view to lifting the 
arms embargo on Bosnia. 
  It was also decided that the government would set about 
gathering extensive relief aid to help the defenseless people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In view of the guidance issued by the eminent leader 
[Khamene'i], the constructive role that could be played by 
peacekeeping forces from Islamic countries in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
was also underlined.

  [Text] Tehran, April 24, IRNA -- Majles Speaker Hojjat 
ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri here Sunday [24 April] called on 
Islamic countries to lift arms embargo against Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Speaking at today's Majles open session, the speaker 
referred 
to the support of the international bodies, including the U.N. 
and hegemonist powers, for the Serbian crimes and said, "Islamic 
countries, given the unreliability of U.N. Security Council 
resolutions, should lift the arms embargo against Bosnia to 
enable the Muslims in that country to defend themselves." 
  He expressed hope that Islamic countries would not limit 
themselves to uttering words but would also enter the scene of 
action. 
  The speaker referred to his recent talks with Malaysian and 
Pakistani officials and said authorities in the two countries 
held identical views in connection with the double standard of 
the internatiional community on Bosnia and its inaction in 
standing against the Serbs aggressions. 
  He also condemned the failed attempt against the life of 
Hojjat ol-Eslam Abaie, susbstitute Friday prayer leader of 
Mashhad, by terrorist groups and called on the Information 
Ministry to take a serious stance towards the issue. 
  "Those lackey munafiq (hypocrite) elements should know that 
by resorting to such assassination attempts and explosions they 
could not disappoint the ulema and the people to abandon their 
struggle and could not create a state of terror in the society," 
remarked the speaker.

  [Text] Urumiyeh (West Azerbaijan Prov.) April 22, IRNA -- 
Thousands of university and high school students here Friday in 
a massive demonstration condemned the silence of the United 
Nations with respect to the killing of Muslim people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Carrying placards that read slogans against the Serbs and 
the 
West the students shouted readiness to offer help to the Muslim 
people of Gorazde. Many people joined the demonstrating 
students on their way. 
  In part of their resolution the document condemned the 
violation against Muslims and the silence of the United Nations. 
The resolution also voiced the preparedness of students to 
serve as volunteers upon the order of the leadership. 
  Similar rallies were held in other Iranian towns and cities 
after the Friday prayer.

demanded 
immediate measures to end the worsening plight of the beseiged 
people of Goradze. 
  They carried placards reading `Death to the U.S.', and 
`Death 
to the racist Serb savages'. 
  A massive rally was staged in front of the United Nations 
mission in Tehran today after the Friday prayer against the 
situation in Bosnia. 
  On Thursday, students and teachers of Islamic seminaries 
held 
a protest demonstration against the irresponsible attitude of 
the U.N. towards the inhuman crimes of the Serbs.

  [Text] Tehran, April 22, IRNA -- Thousands of Tehranis 
marched to the United Nations office here today after the Friday 
prayer to protest against the world body's inaction to end the 
worsening plight of besieged Bosnian Muslims in Gorazde. 
  At the end of the rally the marchers released a resolution 
condemning the silence of the West and international forums, the 
U.N. in particular. 
  They announced support for the defenceless Muslims of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and said they would use all possible means to 
end the Serbian crimes against humanity. 
  The resolution called on Islamic states to close ranks 
against the genocide of Europe's native Muslim population. 
  It lauded Iran's logical stance on the B-H issue and urged 
the Foreign Ministry to provide necessary grounds for sending of 
Iranian forces to Bosnia. 
  Placards carried by the demonstrators read: "Genocide in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina, U.S. Gift to the New Generations". 
  A large group of women were also seen in the rally. 
  Earlier on Thursday, university students had demonstrated in 
front of the U.N. mission to protest the indifference to the 
massacre of Bosnian Muslims.

  [Text] Tehran, April 23, IRNA -- A rally staged by Tehran 
university students outside the U.N. office here in protest at 
its performance in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Saturday afternoon turned 
violent when the marchers began to throw stones and eggs at the 
office. 
  Some windows of the U.N. office have been broken and riot 
police are now trying to prevent the demonstrators from entering 
the building. 
  In the course of their rally on Tehran streets, thousands of 
students chanted slogans, condemning the silence of the United 
Nations and other international bodies on the massacre of 
Bosnian Muslims. 
  The marchers strongly condemned the double standard policy 
of 
the United Nations and certain Western countries towards 
international issues, calling for a halt to the crimes being 
committed by the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The angry demonstrators also burned the U.S. flag in front 
of 
the U.N. office. 
  The marchers, mostly wearing shroud, announced their 
readiness for a rapid dispatch to Bosnia and helping the brave 
defenders of Gorazde. 
  In a press release the marchers said the only way to end the 
clashes is practical coordination of the Islamic countries for 
the quick dispatch of forces to Bosnia. 
  "What is going on in Bosnia is also in line with the tragic 
policies of the global imperialism and international Zionism 
towards Palestine, Lebanon, Kashmir, Tajikistan and other 
Islamic countries," the marchers said. 
  Meanwhile, Bosnian Ambassador to Tehran Omar Bahman 
appreciated the people for their massive presence in the rally, 
and said resistance of the Bosnian Muslims is indebted to the 
cooperation of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  "The enemy is strong, but we will continue to resist," he 
said, adding that the Bosnian people were victims of a horrible 
crime which was unprecedented in the history. 
  In another development, the Islamic Association of the 
Iranian Students in Moscow condemned the massacre of the 
oppressed people of Gorazde by the racist Serbs, and castigated 
the silence of the international circles and the United Nations 
towards the issue. 
  "If the world continues its silence, and the Muslims world 
does not rise up, the Serbs will totally occupy 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and kill all Muslims in that country with the 
help of the arms of the former Yugoslavia," said the association 
in a statement.

<F P=106> [Second Friday sermon by Ayatollah Mohammad Emami-Kashani in </F>
Tehran on 22 April -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. [passage omitted]. We are coming through days, which 
are the turning points of history. Once upon a time there was an 
international community in the world. Then World War I started. 
After World War II the major powers, which had faced the scourge 
of war, set up the United Nations and the Security Council. 
They told the world that the objective was to respect borders 
and to stop one [country] violating another. How far have the 
United Nations and the Security Council come today? What has 
happened? What are human societies witnessing today? 
  The Security Council, which used to say it wanted to 
maintain 
world security, and the United Nations, which used to say it 
wished to safeguard the rights of all mankind, have become 
supporters of arrogant powers and a witness and observer in the 
arena, where the innocent and defenseless people are rolled into 
dust and blood. This is their fate today. It is lying that it 
cannot do much. This is a lie and all members of mankind should 
understand that it is lying. It is even withdrawing its forces 
from Bosnia and such zones as Gorazde. It says it cannot do 
anything. It is pleading that it is incapable. Whereas when it 
faced the Iraq-Kuwait problem, it promptly condemned [Iraq] and 
called on everyone to go to war. It asked for troops and money. 
On the other hand we saw when a gang of criminal Serbs attacked 
this city, it took the Security Council three months to condemn 
the attack. The United Nations issued a feeble resolution on 
the issue. And now whatever they say is nothing but slogans. 
The only side telling the truth under this blue sky is Iran -- 
the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  This fact is being proven across the world. We -- that is 
the Iranian nation -- realized after the revolution that many 
things are false, including the United Nations and the Security 
Council. But there were many who believed that those are true 
and correct. But what occurred in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in 
Palestine and -- these days -- in the oppressed town of Gorazde, 
was the coup de grace delivered to the hope of all the hopeful 
people. It delivered the coup de grace to all those who hoped 
-- though we were not among them. They realized that the United 
Nations is a lie. 
  What sort of accounting is that? To gather Muslims in a 
mosque and then set fire to the mosque! To rip open the stomach 
of pregnant women just because they are carrying a Muslim child! 
To make a bet on whether the fetus is a girl or a boy and then 
laugh their heads off over the bet! What atrocities they 
perpetrate! 
  The Russian president, Mr. Yeltsin, tells the Serbs to be 
careful so that world sentiments are not moved against them! 
Now, what do they do themselves? What assistance they give! 
What green light does the East and West give them! 
  I say in all truth and earnestness, with what is going on 
now 
-- the crimes that are being committed -- the nations watch. We 
do not watch. The beloved leader of the revolution, may God 
grant him victory, with his precise political stances -- beside 
his enthusiasm for science and religious jurisprudence, his 
piety and truly befitting aspects -- has announced that the 
armed forces must be prepared. The Islamic Republic of Iran has 
not denied [the Bosnian Muslims] anything and will not deny them 
anything. But those who perpetrate crimes and those who watch 
those crimes will all be punished. One can see that coming. 
[passage omitted] 
  We are living under conditions where a great many crimes are 
being committed against humanity. And that is the way the 
United Nations acts! 
  Muslims must think about forming an organization, a united 
nations, a united nations that protects weak countries. Not 
just Muslims -- all countries should free themselves of those 
who do as they please using their power of veto with America in 
their forefront. They commit so many crimes in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Gorazde, Palestine on the other hand, and 
also in other parts. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. President, in his last statements on the 
situation in Bosnia has proposed the plan on safe regions in 
Bosnia to cover the surrounding areas, too. 
  While the international community witnessed how Gorazde was 
occupied by the aggressive Serbs as a safe city in Bosnia 
against the international organization's indifference, the U.S. 
President's statements are more a reaction to public opinion in 
the United States and the world. 
  Gorazde was occupied by the invading Serb Army when the 
international community had called for a decisive measure to put 
an end to Serbian attacks against Gorazde, with its expression 
of disgust toward crimes committed by the Serbs. 
  The West not only did not show any reaction to this Serb's 
invasion of Gorazde but with its silence against these crimes 
expressed its pleasure, too. 
  In the thick of the collapse of Gorazde and the atrocities 
by 
the Serbs in this Muslim inhabited city, political observers 
predicted that the West's silence would place a new dilemma in 
front of the western statesmen. 
  The same observers expressly said that the Serb's victory in 
dominating Gorazde will put this question to the western 
statesmen as to how they want to prevent Serbs later invasions 
in the future. 
  In response to this question the U.S. President has proposed 
to extend NATO air force operation region to the vicinity of 
safe regions in Bosnia in a way to cover Serb supply and 
ammunition depots. 
  The U.S. secretary of defense in explaining the failure or 
success of the plan on the extension of safe regions to the 
vicinity of these region has said: Even if the U.S. presence 
plan is confirmed by the NATO military experts it cannot 
guarantee the security of the safe regions. 
  The U.S. President proposed the said plan while political 
observers in the United States warned the U.S. statesmen by 
saying the Serbs victory in occupying Gorazde has explicitly 
endangered U.S. strategic interests and has brought up this 
possibility that the Serbs extend their invasion as far as 
Croatia and Macedonia. 
  The situation in the tragic collapse of the Muslim-inhabited 
city of Gorazde along with the massacre of human beings in this 
city, has made the world people realize this fact that the West 
shows serious reaction to aggressors only when its strategic 
interests are exposed to threats. 
  In other words, Gorazde collapsed because the collapse of 
this Muslim-inhabited city was not against the West's strategic 
interest. 
  Expansion of Serb invasions against Croatia, in view of 
independence-seeking inclinations among the Serbs in [word 
indistinct] region, will give this chance to the Serb invaders 
to threaten the creation of a confederation of Croatia Republic 
and Muslim-Croat Federation which has been agreed upon. 
  In the meantime, the expansion of Serb aggression against 
Macedonia will [word indistinct] the creation of the greater 
Serbia. 
  Expansion of the Serb invasion has placed the UN before the 
reality that if it had showed serious and decisive reaction 
against violation of the first UN Security Council resolution by 
the Serbs, the Bosnian nation would not be the subject of such 
atrocities today, and the credibility of this world 
organizations would never be harmed as such.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>
  [Text] The NATO ultimatum to the aggressor Serbs has 
expired. Yet, even though they continue their attacks on the 
city of Gorazde and its oppressed residents, the UN emissary in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has announced that Serbs have promised to 
withdraw a few kilometers away from Gorazde and there is no need 
for a NATO attack on Serb positions. 
  Political analysts believe that the United Nations and 
Western countries are turning a blind eye to the Serbian 
atrocities and the announcement of a belated ultimatum by 
NATO--for political and propaganda purposes--highlights the fact 
that no justice can be expected from the current international 
system. It is because of the intrinsically Western bias of this 
system that it has an anti- Islamic stance. The implementation 
of the UN resolutions on Iraq to chastise that country for its 
occupation of Kuwait while turning a blind eye to Serbian 
atrocities in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Zionists in Palestine 
proves that with such policies the West and the United 
Nations--with their leniency toward noncompliance with UN 
resolutions in these regions--not only do not prevent the 
continued humanitarian catastrophes but actually facilitate 
their continuation and proliferation. 
  It is for this reason that the Islamic world should seek an 
alternate measure from the United Nations and the West to halt 
this savage and brutal onslaught. Even though activity outside 
the current international system is very difficult, and the 
subservience of some rulers of Islamic countries to the powers 
of world arrogance detracts from cooperation among Islamic 
countries, the continuation of the present state of affairs is 
not possible, especially when the Islamic world is witnessing a 
human catastrophe daily. 
  Political analysts believe that the Muslim people realize 
the 
above facts now more than ever before because of the sorrowful 
events in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that most Islamic countries 
also understand this reality. In such a climate, planning and 
coordination on the popular and official levels among Islamic 
governments is essential. 
  The upcoming hajj season is one of the most important things 
that can be used to attain such lofty objectives and to impart 
its true meaning to the hajj.

<F P=106> [Commentary by M. Mollazadeh: "NATO's Cosmetic Actions"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The limited strikes by NATO warplanes on some 
less important Serb positions around the city of Gorazde, 
strikes in which it is said that only one Serb tank was 
destroyed, raise the question: Why has NATO resorted to this 
cosmetic action? If we were to glance at the news reports 
concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially Gorazde, the answer 
would not be very difficult to find. Before U.S. airplanes 
overflew their positions, the Serbs had carried out chemical 
bombing of Gorazde and the city was on the verge of collapse. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Muslim people of Gorazde gained nothing from these 
attacks and the danger of a massacre was not mitigated. 
Clearly, the Western mass media carried out extensive 
propaganda on this superficial action, as if to say that it 
actually halted the Serb advance. 
  The Bosnian president welcomed NATO's action but openly 
declared that such limited strikes were carried out too late and 
could not change the course of events. This is worth mulling 
over. A sovereign country such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, a UN 
member, cannot expect support from the greater powers; it is not 
in such a position. [passage omitted] 
  Obviously things will continue as they are, as the Serbs 
will 
not only continue their aggression, but will also try every 
means possible to occupy all the Bosnian areas to which they 
profess historical claims. They will not hesitate to perpetrate 
greater atrocities, such as using banned chemical weapons. 
Unfortunately, the world has closed its eyes to such crimes and 
no sounds of deterrent seem to be emanating from any country. 
  In such circumstances, the Serbs continue their campaign of 
bloody ethnic cleansing against the Bosnian Muslims. 
Undoubtedly, limited, ineffective action will not solve the 
problems of the Muslim defenders of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the 
Bosnian war. 
  With their silence, the international organizations, 
European 
countries, the United States, and Russia have extended their 
tacit consent for the Serbs' atrocities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
which is tantamount to complicity in these crimes. They cannot 
shrug off their responsibility with such superficial actions. 
  Limited operations against the Serbs cannot fool the Bosnian 
Muslims into untimely optimistic conjecture. But since 
conditions are so difficult for them, they cannot ignore even a 
glimmer of hope. 
  There is also the theory that NATO carried out these strikes 
to divert attention from the Serbs' use of chemical weapons 
against the Bosnian Muslims. This is what happened and the 
international mass media directed all its attention to reporting 
on NATO's aerial operations so that people everywhere would have 
less time to ponder the criminal actions of the Serbs and their 
chemical bombing of Gorazde. 
  It is not unlikely that the international community's 
inertia 
and the indifference by Europe and the United States over using 
their troops to halt the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina may result in 
dismembering this country. This will enable the Serbs to 
achieve their goals. If this occurs, there is no knowing where 
the Serbs will stop, because they may covet other remaining 
Muslim territory. The war may spread further in the region and 
may even continue for an unforeseen period. 
  In the circumstances, will the world move toward unbridled 
power for some countries and fail to rein in the lust for power 
of fascist and chauvinist groups? If events in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are to be considered the criterion for 
judgment, you can state with great regret that the world is 
facing bleak prospects.

  [Text] Tehran, April 24, IRNA -- A morning daily here 
Sunday [24 April] referred to the role Russia played in the 
Bosnian tragedy and said if Russia allowed itself to be used as 
an excuse for Western duplicity in Bosnia, it would damage its 
"already fragile relation with Muslim countries." 
  "The United States introduced the Russian trump card exactly 
at the juncture when the world public opinion demanded UN-NATO 
action to end Serbian aggression against Bosnia," wrote "TEHRAN 
TIMES" in its editorial. 
  The United States and its allies, said the article, insist 
that there can be no peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina unless the 
Russians are allowed to participate in NATO's plants to end the 
Serbs atrocities. 
  The West had to find a way of wiggling out this mess without 
accepting any blame and this was where the Russian factor came 
into play, noted the paper. 
  The daily wrote that the U.S. intended to show that Russia 
was an important military power deserving of being included in 
resolving the global conflicts. 
  However, added the paper, when the U.S.-led UN forces 
attacked the Iraqi Army, the opposition of the all powerful 
Soviet Union was totally ignored by the U.S. and its allies. 
  Russia, for its domestic reasons, needed to pretend that it 
was still the same "menacing bear" it used to be before its 
disintegration, said the daily. 
  It added that the Russian officials should realize that by 
promoting the Serbian cause they are playing into the hands of 
the Western "political puppeteers" who plan to sit this war out 
and blame their inaction on Russia's opposition to the use of 
force against the Serbs. 
  The paper noted in conclusion that Russia should realize 
that 
if it continued playing the role of an excuse for the West, it 
would face "irreparable" damages in its relations with Muslim 
countries and their more than one billion collective population.

  [Text] Bushehr--JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI correspondent: We have 
begun to build the Bushehr Power Plant. 
  An informed source at the Bushehr Power Plant said this to 
our correspondent, adding that following initial agreements with 
the Russians a few months ago, their experts began working on 
the first unit of the Bushehr Power Plant early this [Iranian] 
year [beginning 21 March 1994]. This unit is to be completed in 
four years, and will have a 1,000-megawatt output. 
  He added: So far 30,000 tonnes of the power plant's main 
parts have been brought into the country from Germany and are 
being kept in suitable storage areas. About 7,000 tonnes of the 
main parts of the power plant, which have been paid for and 
legally belong to the Islamic Republic of Iran, have been packed 
and sent to ports, and are ready for shipment to Iran, but 
regrettably they are being held up because the German Government 
will not issue an export permit on the basis of empty pretexts. 
  He added that unfortunately there is no information on what 
state these parts are in. 
  The informed source said that fortunately 90 percent of the 
damage inflicted during the imposed war has been repaired by the 
able hands of Iranian experts and the remaining 10 percent is 
currently being repaired. 
  It should be noted that the agreement for the construction 
of 
the Bushehr Power Plant was signed on 10 Tir 1355 [1 July 1976] 
between the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization [IAEO] and 
Kraftwerk Union of Germany for 7.8 billion DM [German marks]. 
On the basis of this agreement, the German company was to build 
a nuclear power plant approximately 18 km southwest of Bushehr, 
consisting of two pressurized light water units, each with an 
output of 3765 thermal megawatts and 1296 megawatts. Of the 
aforementioned amount, Iran has paid 5.8 billion DM. In 
addition, separate agreements for supplying the necessary fuel 
and 200,000 cubic meters of pure water needed by the power plant 
were signed. Thus, a total of 137,394,000 DM and $43 million 
has been paid by the IAEO to Germany. 
  According to the same report, so far progress has been made 
on about 85 percent of the construction works, and about 65 
percent of the mechanical and electrical works in the power 
plant.

  [Text] Bucharest, April 23, IRNA -- Foreign Minister 'Ali 
Akbar Velyati said here Saturday [23 April] that European 
countries are expected to actively participate in the on-going 
efforts towards the development of the Central Asian region. 
  Speaking at the third general session of the Crans-Montana 
Forum, Velayati said such participation will as well serve 
European interests, since it brings the most needed natural 
resources such as natural gas to the doorsteps of the European 
countries. 
  "ECO (Economic Cooperation Organization) and Central Asian 
countries would welcome such a multilateral cooperation," he 
added. 
  Elsewhere, he said completion of trans Asian communication 
network and its connection through iran and Turkey to the Trans 
European Motorway (TEM) will provide a trans Euro-Asian network. 
  "In the meantime, the project of Iran-Turkmenistan gas 
pipeline is designed to transfer Turkmenistan's gas to Europe 
through Iran," Velayati said.

  [Text] Bucharest, April 23, IRNA -- Foreign Minister 'Ali 
Akbar Velayati here today reiterated the full support of the 
Iranian people and government for the oppressed people of Bosnia 
against the aggressor Serbs. 
  He made the remark in a meeting with his Bosnian counterpart 
Haris Siladzic on the sidelines of the Crans-Montana forum here, 
where the two sides also reviewed the latest developments in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina particularly the Gorazde crisis. 
  Informing Velayati on the details of the strong resistance 
of 
the people in Gorazde against the wide-scale Serbian invasion, 
Siladzic said his country was pessimistic towards the "ambiguous 
function" of the international circles. 
  He termed the aid rendered by the Islamic Republic of Iran 
to 
the Bosnia people as "Islamic and brotherly" and appreciated the 
Iranian people and government for their sympathy with the 
Bosnian Muslims.

  [Text] Dr. Velayati, our foreign minister, who went to 
Romania to participate in the World Forum Foundation, returned 
to Tehran at midnight. He said that Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
Serbs' atrocities against the Muslims of that country, 
especially in Gorazde, were the main topics of his discussions 
with the Croatian parliamentary speaker and the foreign 
ministers of Albania, Romania, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In an exclusive interview with our correspondent on the 
World 
Forum Foundation, Dr. Velayati said: 
  [Begin Velayati recording] The forum, which was established 
five years ago, is a nongovernmental international center that 
usually meets once a year in the month of Tir [22 June-22 July] 
at Crans-Montana in Switzerland. In some countries, an 
emergency session is held on request to discuss specific issues 
between the annual sessions. Therefore, this is a new form of 
international gathering that is, as I mentioned, a 
nongovernmental one and is progressing alongside the United 
Nations and other affiliated organizations. 
  The first session of this kind was held in Davos, 
Switzerland 
and the second one was convened in Crans-Montana [as heard]. In 
other parts of the world, similar organizations are being 
established. [end recording]

  [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, and the 
Fatah Hawks--the military wing of the Fatah movement--signed an 
agreement in the occupied areas of Palestine yesterday, Friday, 
to stop all kinds of hostile operations against each other. 
  This agreement, which was welcomed by popular and political 
Palestinian circles, ends the conflict between these two groups 
which had been going on for the past few months, and opens a new 
chapter of fraternal ties between them. Prior to the signing of 
the agreement halting hostilities between Hamas and the Fatah 
Hawks, the Zionist regime officials expressed concern about this 
and threatened the PLO, which is engaged in talks with that 
regime. They described the agreement as a sort of division of 
labor between Hamas and Fatah. 
  The Zionist regime's environment minister, who is playing an 
active role in the PLO-Tel Aviv talks, stated: If the PLO 
believes that it is carrying out a division of labor by this 
action and is giving Hamas permission to carry out anti-Israeli 
operations while engaging in talks itself, it is mistaken. He 
added: If the PLO signs an agreement with Hamas, it cannot sign 
any agreement with Israel. 
  In order to sow further discord in the Fatah and PLO 
ranks--headed by combatants of the Islamic Movement and 'Arafat, 
respectively--the Zionist regime threatened the PLO that in the 
event of continued anti-Zionist operations by Hamas, talks will 
be suspended. Despite the Zionist regime's efforts to the 
contrary, the agreement between the Hamas and Fatah Movements 
opened a new chapter of bilateral relations. This agreement was 
signed when Hamas was able to organize four important 
anti-Zionist operations--in a short period of time--in revenge 
for the blood of the martyred fasting worshipers at the 
al-Ibrahimi shrine in al-Khalil [Hebron]. As a result of these 
operations, 14 Zionists were killed and 77 were wounded. 
  Following the shattering debacle of the al-Khalil carnage, 
Hamas had pledged that it would carry out five operations in 
revenge against the Zionists. So far, it has carried out four 
operations and a fifth one is expected. What imparts greater 
significance to the cessation of hostilities between Hamas and 
Fatah is the approach of the time when the security of the 
Gaza-Jericho autonomous regions is to be delegated to 
Palestinian police. Israel is very optimistic that the 
Zionist-Palestinian confrontation will be transformed into a 
Palestinian-Palestinian war. 
  However, the Palestinian Islamic Movement's sensitivity to 
this issue and its principled attention to confrontation with 
the Zionist regime has resulted in the closing of this path 
before such a calamity takes place. The PLO leaders hope that 
this agreement will result in halting Hamas operations in the 
autonomous Gaza-Jericho regions following the withdrawal, or in 
more precise terms, a rearrangement of the array of 
occupationist forces takes place, so that the struggle is 
transferred to other parts of the usurped territories. 
  It does not seem likely that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad 
Movement believe in any boundaries as regards their anti-Zionist 
operations throughout the occupied territories. This has left 
some ambiguities in the accord but the PLO is well aware that 
without an agreement with Hamas it cannot administer these 
affairs. In any case, the negative reaction of the Zionist 
regime is in itself enough indication of the importance of such 
an agreement for the Palestinians.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] Egyptian President Husni Mubarak arrived in the 
Saudi capital, Riyadh, as part of a regional tour of the Persian 
Gulf and was welcomed by Saudi King Fahd. Before his visit to 
Saudi Arabia, Mubarak visited Oman, the United Arab Emirates, 
and Bahrain and held talks with officials. 
  During the visit, Mubarak is discussing regional and Arab 
problems with the host countries. The Egyptian president and 
the countries' officials still place special emphasis on 
developments in the Persian Gulf and on the process of the Arab 
governments' talks with the Zionist regime. 
  The Egyptian president's visit to Persian Gulf countries is 
noteworthy. First, basically speaking, the Egyptian 
regime--especially during the Mubarak era--focuses special 
attention on the Persian Gulf in its regional policy. This 
interest stems largely from the Egyptian regime's economic 
desires for the Persian Gulf countries' wealth. Thus, this 
regime is always seeking a pretext to expand its relations with 
these countries and to score economic points through these 
relations. 
  After the Persian Gulf war, on the pretext of ensuring the 
security of the Persian Gulf's southern littoral countries, 
Egypt became one of the founders of the Damascus security pact, 
the six-plus-two pact, which failed because of its ambiguous and 
suspicious nature and because it lacked a specific identity. 
Since then, the Egyptian Government has constantly resorted to 
political intervention and propaganda efforts to create security 
tension in the Persian Gulf in a bid to ensure a base for 
itself. But apart from exporting manpower to Saudi Arabia to 
replace the 1.5-million-strong Yemeni manpower, which was ousted 
because of Yemen's political stance in the Persian Gulf, Egypt 
has been unable to achieve much. 
  The second noteworthy point in Mubarak's Persian Gulf tour 
is 
the link between this tour and the Persian Gulf's move to 
welcome the Zionist regime under the guise of multilateral 
sessions, the first of which was held in the Omani capital, 
Muscat, last week. The second such session is to be held in 
Qatar in a few days, while the third is to be held in Bahrain. 
The Egyptian regime is playing the role of middleman for a 
compromise between the occupying Zionist regime and Arab regimes 
and considers itself as having a special mission in this. 
  When the Muslim public is enraged with the direct or 
indirect 
establishment of ties and with publicizing these ties, Mubarak 
considers it his duty to support a compromise. It is noteworthy 
that Mubarak's tour coincides with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's departure for the region to activate the 
slow, heavy wheels of compromise. Some sources say that on the 
first leg of his tour, Christopher will visit the Saudi capital, 
Riyadh, and will hold a joint session on Wednesday morning with 
the foreign ministers of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council. 
  Another point that should not be ignored is the scheduling 
of 
Mubarak's visit, which is being carried out before the 
religious-political Hajj pilgrimage. Last year too the head of 
the Egyptian regime visited southern Persian Gulf states, most 
notably Saudi Arabia. 
  Political observers are considering the negative impacts of 
Mubarak's visit.

  [Text] Washington, April 25, IRNA -- Members of the Iranian 
economic delegation took part in the 50th official ministerial 
meeting of the Group 24 here Sunday. Present in the session 
were ministers of economy and governors of the central banks of 
the developing countries. The participants expressed hope for a 
favorable world economic prospect and discussed various 
financial and economic issues. 
  Governor of the Central Bank of Iran Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli 
who heads the Iranian delegation to the meeting voiced 
developing countries' concern over the recent fluctuations in 
the price of raw materials, oil and gas in particular, and their 
negative impact on the programs for economic adjustment in those 
countries. 
  The Group 24 stressed that although there has been some 
improvement in the balance of payment of certain developing 
countries, the heavy repayment of foreign debts still imposes 
pressure on their financial situation. 
  In this connection, the developing countries called for more 
easy-term financial assistance and urged the industrial 
countries to open their markets to their export commodities. 
The Group 24 also called for the allocation of a new Special 
Drawing Rights (SDR) and underlined its importance in the 
establishment of economic adjustment in their countries. 
  They expressed satisfaction with the successful outcome of 
the Uruguay round and underscored its significance in increasing 
the volume of trade and accelerating world economic growth. 
They also warned against the negative impact of population 
growth on sustainable development of world economy. 
  Referring to the importance of investigation into the issue 
of refugees, the Iranian Central Bank governor reminded the 
necessity of international assistance to eliminate this major 
problem. 
  According to the statistics of the International Monetary 
Fund and the World Bank, due to the presence of foreign refugees 
Iran is shouldering more burden than other countries. The 
staistics showed that about 25 percent of the total world 
refugees are living in Iran.

  [Text] Tehran, April 23, IRNA -- A morning daily here 
Saturday [23 April] commented on the "existing spiraling" 
inflation in the country and said that there would be no social 
justice with a runaway inflation. 
  Referring to the fact that the uncontrolled inflation in 
Iran 
was a serious concern for both government and the people, 
`KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL' said in its editorial that the officials 
are aware that nothing could weaken or erode the achievements of 
the Islamic revolution like a runaway inflation. 
  The damaging aspects of inflation could never be 
underestimated, the paper said, adding that, although material 
progress was not promised, social justice was, and at the heart 
of social justice lies an equitable distribution of resources 
and income. 
  Referring to the measures taken by the government to control 
inflation the paper said that more time was required before they 
could produce results. 
  It added that two points should be taken into consideration 
if remedy was desired: First, the country's economic problems 
"are partially political," secondly, irrespective of the changes 
in government policies, the desired economic performance would 
not be realized unless Iran's plans on privatization and joint 
venture investments have not been materialized.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "An Important Warning"] </F>
  [Text] There were certain segments of His Eminence 
Ayatollah Khamene'i's speech on 13 April that were not carried 
by IRNA. In view of the importance of the warning by the great 
leader, we present the following points: 
  --Remain alert and vigilant in the trenches, because a 
wounded enemy is more furious. 
  --Their struggle gets more serious and fraught with anger 
the 
more unsuccessful they are. 
  --They are trying to tarnish the revolution; this is what is 
going on in the sphere of politics. 
  --Anyone in this country undertaking constructive activity 
or 
entrusted with some task should be alert and vigilant. The 
enemy has not been able to strike, but he has not given up hope. 
  --We should strengthen our strong points. Of course, we do 
have weak points that we should strive to eliminate, too. 
  --You can see that smugglers and other individuals who 
smuggle in videocassettes full of sex, erotic pictures, 
pornographic literature, magazines, or nude and titillating 
photographs are not truly earning their livelihood. I should 
state on the basis of my information that their livelihood comes 
from other sources. They have been assigned to propagate and 
popularize this quagmire of lust and immorality among the 
Iranian people, especially the youths and their families. 
  --Today, there are some who wield their pens in the same 
manner as those they see being favored and paid black money by 
the American CIA, which gives them a few dollars! They go ahead 
and write that the Iranian nation erred when it staged the 
revoluton. In this manner, they denigrate the greatest, most 
courageous, and inspiring action by the Iranian nation and say 
that the Iranian people regret they staged the revolution. May 
the hatred and disgust of the Iranian nation be upon such pens. 
  --We will collar the big powers in all parts of the world, 
as 
they are tyrants who oppose us, and we do not spare tyrants. 
  --We are not the kind of people or government that will 
ignore an aggressor or tyrant so that he can continue his work. 
  --Formerly, when the powers of arrogance came, they did so 
overtly and occupied a country. Today, they use more advanced 
means for dominating and usurping nations and their resources.

  [Text] Cairo, 24 Apr (MENA)--AL-AHRAM states that President 
Husni Mubarak's visit to China was succesful. 
  The paper says Egypt's political gains from the visit are no 
less important than the economic gains. 
  These gains, AL-AHRAM explains, are represented by the two 
countries' complete agreement on regional issues in Asia and the 
Middle East in particular, and international issues in general, 
especially the future of the world in light of the new world 
order, which is now being formed. 
  In its editorial today the paper says that Egyptian-Chinese 
relations have been strong and firm for years. They have never 
cooled and are becoming stronger. The paper adds that Egypt's 
policy under President Mubarak has always been balanced and 
eager to support and promote relations with all nations.

  [Text] Abu Dhabi, 23 Apr (MENA)--Egyptian Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa describes what is happening now in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
as "an international scandal by any standard." He adds that the 
situation in Bosnia has been ignored until it deteriorated to 
this point, while the ethnic cleansing operations continue. 
This, he emphasizes, represents a "serious violation of human 
rights," noting that this constitutes aggression and the murder 
of citizens of a UN member state. 
  Musa, who is accompanying President Mubarak on his visit to 
the United Arab Emirates, made these remarks to a MENA 
correspondent there. 
  With regard to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's 
statement that he is willing to remove settlements from the 
Golan Heights in exchange for peace, Musa says this is a 
"reasonable" offer which is not unprecedented, because 
settlements were previously removed from Sinai. He stresses the 
need for a comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from the occupied 
territories as part of the "full peace" endorsed by the Madrid 
conference for peace in the Middle East and in accordance with 
the "land for peace" principle. Musa reiterates Egypt's backing 
of the Syrian position in the negotiations, which calls for a 
full and comprehensive withdrawal from the Golan in exchange for 
peace. 
  Musa underlines the importance of the Middle East tour U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher will begin on Sunday [24 
April] to discuss the Arab-Israeli negotiation tracks, the most 
important being the Syrian-Israeli track. He notes that the 
first stage of the Palestinian-Israeli track, about the 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, is nearly 
concluded. He hopes the two sides will then move on the next 
stage of the talks.

  [Text] Cairo, 24 Apr (MENA)--Egypt, the current OAU 
chairman, has urged the nationalist forces in South Africa to 
end all acts of violence and prepare for free and honest 
elections that will establish a democratic system in which all 
sides can participate. This was stated by a responsible source 
at the Foreign Ministry on the occasion of the first non-racial 
elections to be held in South Africa on Tuesday. 
  The Egyptian source said that the current stage in which 
democratic changes are taking place in South Africa demands 
extreme vigilance because it is difficult to eliminate the 
legacy of racism and tribalism in a very short time. 
  He added that the elections require the support of all 
local, 
regional, and international political forces to thwart the plans 
of the enemies of democracy. 
  The source affirmed that the democratic changes in South 
Africa are consistent with the views and will of the 
international community. He added that attempts to frustrate 
these changes will fail because they are not in the interest of 
the South African people.

Foreign Ministry under secretary and director of the President's 
Office for Political Affairs, met with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, adviser 
to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the negotiations with Israel. They 
discussed the negotiations and the extent of progress made. The 
Palestinian-Israeli talks will resume in Cairo tomorrow morning. 
  Following the meeting, Dr. al-Baz expressed hope that the 
Palestinians and Israelis would do their best to complete 
discussion of the pending issues during the round of talks that 
will begin Sunday so that the implementation of the Declaration 
of Principles can start and the Palestinian people can feel the 
big change that will take place when a new phase of good 
relations between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples begins. 
  He said the positions of the two sides are quite close, 
which 
makes it possible for the talks to have a "positive and happy 
ending."

  [Text] Cairo, 24 Apr (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR praises the Lebanese 
Government's stance on the recent assassination of the Iraqi 
opposition figure in Beirut, describing it as courageous and 
decisive. 
  The paper says in its editorial today that the Lebanese 
Government first asked the Baghdad Government to lift the 
diplomatic immunity of the perpetrators of the crime so they 
could be brought to trial. When the Iraqi Foreign Ministry 
refused, Lebanon immediately announced the severance of 
diplomatic ties with Iraq. 
  AL-AKHBAR adds that this incident reaffirms the Iraqi 
regime's continued involvement in terrorist acts and President 
Saddam Husayn's insistence on continuing to liquidate his 
opponents abroad. The incident also reaffirms that any attempt 
to improve ties with the Iraqi regime or to have confidence in 
it is useless. 
  In conclusion, the paper says it is regrettable that the 
assassination of the Iraqi opposition figure in Beirut came at a 
time when some have been calling for Arab unity and Arab 
solidarity.

  [Text] Sallum, Egypt, April 22 (AFP) -- Security forces 
have taken measures to block Algerian Moslem militants from 
trying to slip into Egypt in the guise of pilgrims on their way 
to Mecca, officials said Friday. 
  Security forces will escort pilgrims and hold their 
passports 
when they enter Egypt from Libya at Sallum until they leave the 
country at al-Nuwaybi' in the Sinai, officials said. "These 
measures are aimed at preventing Algerian militants infiltrating 
into Egypt," a security official at the Libyan-Egyptian border 
said. The security services had obtained information about 
attempts at cooperation between Egyptian and Algerian 
extremists. "The Algerian militants could take advantage of the 
pilgrimage season to infiltrate into Egypt and renew contacts 
with Egyptian activists," he said. 
  Some 30,000 pilgrims from Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco 
and Mauritania are to start travelling to Saudi Arabia via the 
Egyptian border post at Sallum. The pilgrimage, or hajj, is 
planned for the end of May. Only Libyan pilgrims will be exempt 
from the measures. The governments of Egypt and Algeria are 
both locked in a bloody confrontation with Islamic militants 
bent on their overthrow.

<F P=106> ["Idea" column by Mustafa Amin] </F>
  [Text] People were pleased when the prime minister declared 
that the government would revoke the emergency law as soon as 
terrorism ends. The people will not accept living under this 
law when terrorism is over. This law is dubious and of 
ill-repute, and the people dub it martial law. 
  The prime minister's statement urges people to increase 
their 
resistance to terrorism, because the country does not need more 
problems and the people do not want their movements restricted 
for three years. Why three years? Does this mean the 
government expects terrorism to continue for three more years? 
  Egypt is the first country to have an emergency law in force 
for 13 years. Other countries have declared states of emergency 
for one month. Emergency laws have neither curbed nor prevented 
terrorism. Terrorism has been on the rise. People have started 
to forget what normal life is like, the days when they were 
never tried before military courts or state security courts and 
when the government never detained anyone for more than three 
days. 
  I always believed that freedom, not the emergency law, could 
eliminate terrorism. I recall that all the assassinations in 
Egypt took place under martial law and the emergency law. True, 
people are aware of the prevailing serious situation, but at the 
same time the people believe they can eliminate terrorism while 
they enjoy freedom and a normal life free from oppression and 
despotism. 
  Other countries have been seen more terrorist operations 
than 
our country. Britain, for example, has not declared emergency 
law although bombs explode in London daily. Germany has not 
passed an emergency law despite the daily demonstrations and the 
burning of foreigners' houses. 
  The government claims that it will not repress writers or 
opinions. At the same time, however, we see many journalists 
being tried before the criminal court and other journalists 
being persecuted at dawn, which is reminiscent of the sixties. 
  The prime minister has, however, assured us that the 
emergency law is temporary, not permanent. This would be a 
consolation if true. Let us remember that emergency law was 
never declared for even a day in the United States when 
President Kennedy was assassinated.

  [Text] Cairo, 22 Apr (MENA)--Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi 
has denied that the government is being pressured by the World 
Bank or other financial institutions. He added that the 
government does not take orders from the World Bank or other 
financial institutions. The government's decisions in the area 
of economic reform, he pointed out, are based on the conviction 
that they will serve the interests of the homeland and the 
citizens. He also said that no one could force us to do 
something in which we do not believe. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM published today, the prime 
minister added: We have economic ties with all countries. We 
export, import, and hold open dialogue with all the world's 
countries and economic blocs, including the IMF, the World Bank, 
and the Paris Club. He added that we all benefit through common 
interests, and our cooperation with the World Bank and other 
international institutions must be viewed in the context of 
"common interests" only. 
  Dr. Sidqi touched on the issue of price hikes. He added that 
the state is striving for economic liberalization and for 
keeping the economy free from administrative decisions. This 
does not mean, however, that there will be no state control on 
prices and on the quality of commodities. The proof of this is 
that many contaminated commodities are discovered and rejected, 
and their importers are brought to trial. 
  The prime minister emphasized that for more than two years 
prices have been relatively stable. He said that inflation 
rates are declining noticeably. The rate now has gone down to 
approximately 7 percent, compared with over 25 percent a few 
years ago. This proves that the economic reform policy in Egypt 
is successful. 
  On reports that the government intends to lay off employees 
in the public sector after privatization, Dr. Sidqi reiterated 
that there will be no victims from the public business law and 
that no employees will be laid off unless they want to and, in 
that case, they will get all their rights. 
  On the government's confrontation with corruption, Dr. Sidqi 
said that no society is free from corruption, but this issue has 
been highly exaggerated here. Most cases of corruption are the 
result of rumors or malicious writing. Many of these cases have 
been taken to court and the rulings were decisive. 
  The prime minister was then asked about the delay in 
enacting 
the tenant-landlord law. He noted that the government prefers 
to conduct more studies on this matter and that the results will 
soon be submitted to the People's Assembly, because such a law 
could have negative or positive ramifications for society and it 
should be studied further.

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Musa] </F>
  [Text] A senior security source at the Egyptian Interior 
Ministry has disclosed stunning details about terrorist plans to 
attack public figures and former and current security officials 
with the use of modern techniques obtained from abroad. 
  According to the source, 'Adil Siyam, slain leader of the 
al-Jihad terrorist group, personally supervised the initiation 
of the group's new members. The latter, the source revealed, 
underwent a 30-day period of brainwashing, during which each new 
member was locked in a room and could not leave it until the 
initiation process was over. The initiation was geared toward 
bolstering the members' ability to sustain psychological and 
physical pressure. 
  Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Alim, an accomplice of the slain 
terrorist, 
told investigators that Siyam's death is a terrible blow to the 
group. Siyam was the group's mastermind and the man who held 
all the strings. The group's members obeyed his orders blindly. 
One of Siyam's instructions was that members should commit 
suicide rather than be captured by the police, 'Abd-al-'Alim 
said. 
  According to the same source, police success in cracking the 
terrorist ring came after prolonged monitoring of foreign cash 
transfers received by local terrorist leaders. The State 
Security Intelligence Service has been keeping tabs on checks 
involving considerable dollar and sterling payments to the 
terrorists. 
  A vicious plot against Egypt is being hatched abroad, the 
source said. He added that certain countries are responsible 
for the terrorist operations taking place here. We have 
conclusive evidence about this foreign involvement through the 
confessions of the defendants and the documents seized by the 
security organs. 
  Confessions by members of al-Jihad groups shed light on 
terrorist plans. The terrorists prepared cells in the Bilbays 
area in which they planned to hold any individuals they may 
abduct in order to force the government to release imprisoned 
terrorist leaders. Police have inspected the location of these 
cells in Bilbays' farmland. 
  The terrorists also confessed that they planned to rob 
[al-satw 'ala] a number of key installations, disguised in 
police uniforms that were found in their possession. 
Investigation into the case is continuing under the supervision 
of Public Attorneys Raja' al-'Arabi and 'Abd-al-Sami' 
Sharaf-al-Din.

<F P=106> [Report by Sawsan al-Jayyar, Ibrahim Khalil, 'Abdallah </F>
Kamal, Karim Subhi, and Khalid Dawud] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The Egyptian State Security 
has dealt a strong blow to the terrorists' plans for 1994. 
Behind the success was a major general who learned those plans 
and tactics by heart and knew how to deal with those who tried 
to implement them. As a punishment for his competence, he was 
assassinated five days after the killing of 'Adil 'Awad. 
  Only a few people knew that Major General Ra'uf Khayrat was 
the unknown man behind many of the State Security strikes. 
[passage omitted] 
  The biggest beneficiary [from Khayrat's killing] are the 
Muslim Brotherhood members, who described the assassination as 
the most holy operation since the assassination of President 
al-Sadat. We will not be surprised by this if we know that 
Major General Khayrat was among the keenest watchers of the 
Muslim Brotherhood activities. He considered the group, lying 
dormant until the right moment comes, to be responsible for much 
of what is happening in Egypt. Khayrat, a former aid of Major 
General Fu'ad 'Allam, is of the latter's school, which does not 
distinguish between a moderate extremist and a non-moderate 
extremist. He believed the Muslim Brotherhood is still very 
active, with its secret branches and its members ready for the 
moment when weapons can be brought out, especially since the 
organization has open channels to the outside world. 
  That only a few people knew this fact explains why the 
Muslim 
Brotherhood members were happy at the murder of Ra'uf Khayrat, 
who never took his eyes off them. 
  A few days after the incident, the extremist Islamic Group 
began talking once again about mediation, but this time with the 
support of the Muslim Brotherhood, and under a program that 
included several points: 
  --Granting the Muslim Brotherhood and the extremist groups 
the right to go public. 
  --Stopping military trials and arranging retrials of cases 
in which death sentences were passed. 
  --Releasing all detainees. 
  --Revoking the order to arrest 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman. 
  --Stopping security pursuits against Islamic Group members. 
  This time, the mediation proposal was carried by lawyer 
Muntasir al-Zayyat, and it is said that Mukhtar Nuh, his Muslim 
Brotherhood "counterpart" lawyer, will join him, along with 
'Isam al-'Aryan, Fahmi Huwaydi, and leftist lawyer Nabil 
al-Hilali. 
  But lawyer Muntasir al-Zayyat denied any knowledge of this. 
He said: "Any media coverage of the mediation will spoil it. 
There should be no talk about any efforts until results are 
attained." He explained his proposals at the lawyers congress 
as a "personal view of how to get out of the dark tunnel." In 
return, the interior minister, at his press conference, denied 
any secret contacts and said: "We will not negotiate with 
killers and criminals." 
  When a source from the extremist groups was told that a 
desire for mediation reflects weakness, the source replied: 
"Even if this is true, we must realize that this is only a 
phase, after which the brothers will continue their activity. 
If the request for mediation is understood as a truce, then so 
be it." 
  So, it is indeed an attempt to reach a truce, and it is also 
an attempt to recoup from the blow to the major plan worked out 
by 'Adil 'Awad's organization, especially since the killing of 
Ra'uf Khayrat failed to cause the needed confusion.

    [Editorial Report] Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF in Arabic on 18 
April publishes on pages 18-20 a 3,000-word article by columnist 
'Abd-al-Sattar al-Tawilah responding to the statement issued by 
the Islamic Research Council, headed by al-Azhar's grand imam, 
which denounces secularist writers for casting doubts on 
al-Azhar's authority regarding Islamic affairs. 
  Al-Tawilah, who says he learned of the statement with "both 
astonishment and shock," argues that it "explicitly announces 
support for extremism and the extremists." He says al-Azhar, by 
this statement, "has changed its negative stance to one 
positively favoring the enemies of the nation." Explaining 
this, the writer notes that the al-Azhar statement, in its 
attack against secular intellectuals, says that they fight 
extremism with even more misleading and harmful extremism. 
This, he says, gives the terrorists an excuse to fight this 
more misleading and harmful extremism. 
  Elaborating on this, al-Tawilah states: "All supporters of 
extremism and terrorism justify terrorist criminal acts by 
saying that this or that writer said something against religion, 
hurting the sensitive feelings of those extremist boys and 
angering those who harbor them in the dark. So they decided to 
demolish banks, kill scores of men, women, and children, and 
harm thousands of families." He adds: "The al-Azhar council is 
using the same justification, giving the terrorists the green 
light for further terrorism." 
  Al-Tawilah maintains that Egyptian intellectuals from both 
the left and right have always respected al-Azhar and 
highlighted its role in defending Islam and preserving the 
Islamic heritage. He gives examples of many Egyptian leftist 
writers and thinkers who highlighted the good image of Islam and 
served religion in their literature. The problem, he says, is 
that the intellectuals reject the right of religious authorities 
to decide what can be published and what cannot. "The 
difference lies in the fact that we do not want al-Azhar or 
other religious institutions to impose an executive control over 
our intellectual activity and mental interpretations," he says. 
He adds: "That is, we object to al-Azhar making decisions, but 
accept its making recommendations, giving opinions, and writing 
reports." 
  Concluding, al-Tawilah says: "The attempt to provoke a 
battle between al-Azhar and the Egyptian intellectuals serves 
only the enemies of Islam, foremost of whom are the extremist 
terrorists." 
  In an 1,800-word article on pages 20-21 of the 18 April 
issue 
of Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF, writer Ibrahim 'Isa also accuses 
al-Azhar of supporting terrorism with its statement. The writer 
begins: "What did al-Azhar leave to the extremists? Once you 
differ with the extremists and oppose them you immediately, in a 
blink of an eye, become hostile to Islam, an apostate, an 
atheist, an infidel, or a rebel against religion; and this is 
true if you are against anything that leads, for example, to the 
shedding of your blood, and to them killing you physically and 
morally!" The writer wonders: "If al-Azhar's 11 April 
statement was not terrorism, what then is terrorism?" 
  The writer says that it was the people, not God, that 
established al-Azhar and legislated the laws that gave it its 
important role. Al-Azhar, therefore, is not above criticism. 
"There are no religious institutions in Islam and there is 
nothing like a `grand imam.' We, the people, invented the title 
and put it in our civil law. And we can remove it whenever we 
want; it is not inspired or imposed by God." 
  'Isa then challenges al-Azhar to issue a statement 
explaining 
what it has done to fight extremism, which has continued to grow 
over the past 25 years. He notes that al-Azhar has never 
mentioned extremist material such as 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman's 
books or the audio cassettes containing destructive religious 
ideas and preaching. Insinuating that al-Azhar has suspicious 
links with Saudi Arabia and its religious establishment, the 
writer also wants al-Azhar to issue a statement "explaining in 
detail its position on the Wahhabi thought" [a fundamentalist 
sect dominant in Saudi Arabia] and another "on the Arab oil 
projects that have been established in al- Azhar over the past 
few years, though I hope sincerely that such projects do not 
exist."

    [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-MUSAWWAR in Arabic on 15 April 
publishes a 2,500-word report on an interview with a "repentant 
filmmaker" who became involved with a regional scam that used 
bribes to lure Arab artists into joining the Muslim 
fundamentalist movement. The filmmaker, Anis 'Abd-al-'Ati, is 
interviewed by 'Adil Sa'id. 
  'Abd-al-'Ati says that he studied film direction at the 
Cinema Institute in Cairo from 1981 to 1986. He reveals that he 
made one documentary during his student days that received some 
media notice. Having left the institute without completing his 
studies, 'Abd-al-'Ati traveled abroad in search of work: 
  "After I left the Cinema Institute, I went to Jordan to seek 
my fortune. Then I went to Iraq. There, I thought of making a 
film about Saddam Husayn and calling it 'Knight Faces Persia.' 
I met 'Udayy, Saddam Husayn's son and head of the Olympic 
Committee in Baghdad. I had with me some newspaper cuttings 
about my career. 'Udayy was forthcoming. He made me a gift of a 
Jeep-type vehicle full of books about Saddam Husayn's life and 
career. However, the peace agreement between Iraq and Iran was 
signed and the film project was discarded. I decided to return 
to Egypt." 
  'Abd-al-'Ati then related an aborted attempt in "a 
neighboring Arab country" to find a producer for a film about 
the Palestinian issue. He then traveled to another country, 
which he does not name, and was introduced to several people in 
the advertising and recording business. Among them was Usamah 
Bin-Ladin, the Saudi businessman that Egypt and other countries 
blame for funding the fundamentalist movement and who currently 
lives in Sudan. Another was Salih al-Sharif, who owns al-Muslim 
Recording Company. 'Abd-al-'Ati expresses the belief that 
Bin-Ladin actually "controls" al-Muslim company and that 
al-Sharif is just a "front man." 
  'Abd-al-'Ati, making a 3,000-riyal per month [$600 or $700] 
working for al-Muslim Company, began to follow the strict dress 
code and lifestyle favored by his employers: 
  "Meanwhile, I went regularly to pray and perform religious 
rites with them. I let my beard grow and donned a shorter dress 
[a knee-length shirt-like dress favored by fundamentalists in 
presumed imitation of early Muslims]." 
  'Abd-al-'Ati then met a friend of his employers, a mosque 
preacher, 'Abd-al-'Aziz Hamdan, who asked him to preach in a 
mosque. In his sermon, 'Abd-al-'Ati spun a lie about himself 
being a world-renowned filmmaker persecuted by international 
Zionism. The sermon was recorded and became an immediate hit 
"all over the Gulf, Europe and America." 'Abd-al-'Ati finds it 
"regrettable" that the public fell for this "yarn," but bemoans 
the fact that he "did not receive one cent of the takings." 
  An acquaintance of Bin-Ladin, whom 'Abd-al-'Ati does not 
name, then asked him to approach top Egyptian actors and 
actresses with offers of five to 10 million pounds [$1.5 million 
to $3 million] if they would renounce their careers and lead a 
life of religion. 'Abd-al-'Ati says: "He offered to increase 
the offer if they were ready to reform their ways and renounce 
their careers." 
  The same, unidentified, acquaintance then seeks to involve 
'Abd-al-'Ati in a wider scheme: 
  "He then revealed to me an impressive proselytization effort 
-- Bin-Ladin's official scheme. He asked me to take charge of 
the finances of Islamic groups and to run an office in London 
for this purpose. He wanted me in this job for two reasons: 
First of all, being an Egyptian, this would confuse the public 
as to the identity of the real financiers. Second, they really 
trusted me. 
  "Initially, 250 million [currency not specified] were 
earmarked for that project. From experience, I tell you that 
most of the money came from people who were unaware of how it 
would be used, who thought they were just donating to some 
charity." 
  'Abd-al-'Ati then fell out with the proselytization racket 
because he failed to meet their expectations. In one instance, 
'Abd-al-'Ati refused to meet with Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, 
because of "fear," which he does not explain. In another, he 
declines to get involved in a plan to bomb the Cairo synagogue: 
"I met a man by the name of Muhammad Taha. I still remember 
his face. He asked me to put him in touch with some of my 
acquaintances because he planned to bomb the Cairo synagogue, 
but I refused." 
  Miffed at this lack of enthusiasm, the Bin-Ladin group sent 
'Abd-al-'Ati for further education: 
  "My punishment was tactical. I received orders to move to 
another area [not further specified] for nine months of further 
education in religious matters and to do some soul-searching. 
  "There, I made the acquaintance of 'Abdallah al-Jilali, 
'Abdallah al-Jafir, and Salam al-'Awdah, all of them Bin-Ladin's 
friends. 
  "After the nine months were over, I discovered that I was 
given a one-way exit visa [mughadarah niha'iyah] from the 
country [not further specified]. 
  "Before I left, one of Bin-Ladin's friends asked me to take 
some letters to Afghanistan and Pakistan. I then discovered 
that, with the type of visa I was issued, I could not go back to 
Egypt or stay where I was. When they asked me to go to 
Afghanistan I began to fear for my life. I discovered that I 
was part of a new game and was virtually stateless. 
  "I got the plane tickets after they explained to me the 
circumstances that forced them to terminate my residency. My 
travel itinerary was to take me to Damascus, then Tripoli in 
Libya. From there, I was supposed to go to [Rached] Ghannouchi, 
the extremist leader, in Tunisia. From there I was to go to 
Algeria and then London. 
  "Once in Syria, laden with heavy suitcases and accompanied 
by 
my wife and son, an unexpected thing happened: An air embargo 
was slapped on Libya. I must have been a bit of a spectacle 
with my beard, clothes, and a top-to-toe-covered wife. My only 
option was to go back to Egypt. I was surprised to find that 
the Egyptians let me into the country without any problem." 
  Having entered Egypt unchallenged, 'Abd-al-'Ati somehow 
traveled, also unchallenged, to the "same country" that gave him 
the one-way exit visa. There, he got another job offer: 
  "Back in Egypt, I read all that the papers wrote about me 
and 
was shocked by the magnitude of the problem I had caused. A few 
months later, I returned to the same country with my wife and 
met the same people. They gave me a forged residence permit 
that I still have here in my pocket. 
  "I went to give a lecture at an air base and there I met a 
Sudanese commander named 'Abd-al-Rahim Hammad, who came to 
collect donations. He offered me a job in the media, through 
which I would attack Egypt and get paid $20,000. I learned that 
Bin-Ladin had gone to Sudan." 
  'Abd-al-'Ati does not elaborate on his rift with the 
Bin-Ladin scam. He simply states that he returned to Egypt and 
relates the story of his estrangement with his wife, who went on 
to marry someone else "having stolen the common-law marriage 
certificate, a photocopy of which I still keep." This, 
AL-MUSAWWAR writes, "ends the story of the repentant filmmaker."

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 12 April 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Opposition Condemns Arrest of Islamic Preacher al-Sharif 
  2. Islamic Professor Presents Case Against Mufti Tantawi 
  3. Human Right Organization Reports Torture of Detainees 
  4. Trial of AL-SHA'B Journalists Assailed 
  5. Writers Discuss Dialogue, Urge Muslim Brotherhood 
Recognition 
  6. Youths Urged To Reject Anti-Islamic Policies 
  7. Hamas Attack in 'Afula Praised 
  8. Al-Ghazali Criticizes Muslims' Reaction to Hebron 
Massacre 
<H5>  OPPOSITION CONDEMNS ARREST OF ISLAMIC PREACHER AL-SHARIF </H5>
  An 800-word report by Jamal Imbabi on page two claims that 
"all parties and political forces in the al-Daqahiliyah 
Governorate have condemned the arrest of Islamic preacher Shaykh 
Muhammad al-Sharif and increasing indiscriminate arrests." 
Addressing a seminar organized by the Labor Party Secretariat 
in the governorate, speakers from the Labor Party, the Nasirite 
Arab Democratic Party, and Wafd Party reportedly praise the 
shaykh's distinguished thought and assail the government for its 
undemocratic conduct. Dr. al-Husayni Rayhan, member of the 
Labor Party Executive Committee is cited as strongly attacking 
the call for national dialogue. He says: "What dialogue are 
they talking about when a number of sincere people are arrested 
every day? And they still talk about stability." He adds: 
"The government, which is now talking about terrorism, is 
responsible for creating it because it closed all doors to 
dialogue and change and gave absolute powers to police under the 
shameless emergency law." According to the report, participants 
in the seminar issued several recommendations, with the 
following being the most important: 
  "Releasing the political and Islamic detainees, including 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Sharif. 
  "Stopping indiscriminate arrests of Islamic trends 
supporters. 
  "Implementing political reforms and stopping violence and 
counterviolence. 
  "Setting up a committee from parties and political forces to 
take care of detainees affairs." 
<H5>  ISLAMIC PROFESSOR PRESENTS CASE AGAINST MUFTI TANTAWI </H5>
  In an approximately 1,200-word article on page two, Dr. 
Sha'ban Muhammad Isma'il, head of the Islamic Shari'ah 
Department in al-Azhar University and member of the Higher 
Council for Islamic Affairs, presents his case against Shaykh 
Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, the mufti of the Republic. A court 
ruling had been issued blaming the writer and two others for 
libel against Tantawi. The writer says he had always respected 
and been on good terms with Shaykh Tantawi until the latter 
ruled that bank interest was religiously lawful and, later, that 
it is also religiously lawful to import alcohol to sell to 
tourists and to allow gambling in hotels. The writer says that 
Tantawi "turned from a dignified man into somebody else" when 
the writer contested his rulings and asked him why, before he 
became mufti, he used to say that bank interest was unlawful and 
that now he had changed his mind. The writer notes how Tantawi 
published articles in Egypt and abroad full of "attacks against 
ulema, and especially those who oppose his ideas." He says: "He 
[Tantawi] went so far as to encroach upon his eminence the grand 
al-Azhar imam, the Awqaf minister, and the president of al- 
Azhar university." Because Tantawi passes fatwas [religious 
rulings] without enough knowledge, the writer says, "a number of 
al-Azhar university professors sent a memorandum to his eminence 
the grand al-Azhar imam, in his capacity as the highest Islamic 
authority, because his opinion in religious matters is binding. 
They asked him to work to dismiss the mufti from his post in 
order to preserve the dignity of ulema and to protect the 
homeland from the sedition that has increased due to his fatwas. 
His fatwas violate shari'ah and help widen the gap between the 
youths and the government because the youths--wrongly--think 
that the mufti implements what the government dictates to him." 
<H5>  HUMAN RIGHT ORGANIZATION REPORTS TORTURE </H5>
  The paper publishes on page three an approximately 
2,000-word 
report by the Egyptian Human Rights Organization about the state 
of prisons and how political and Islamist detainees are treated. 
According to the report, prisoners are often subjected to 
torture and collective punishment and are deprived of their 
fundamental rights. "From information it received and 
testimonies it gathered, the organization noticed that the State 
Security intelligence controls all prisons where political 
detainees are kept. Detainees are either tortured in prison or 
taken to the offices of the State Security intelligence in Cairo 
or other security agencies in the governorates to be tortured 
there." The organization became convinced, the report adds, 
that "security agencies have launched repeated campaigns of 
collective punishment against prisoners under the pretext of 
keeping order and maintaining health and hygienic conditions, 
especially in prisons where detainees or convicts from the 
political Islam groups are kept." The report says that security 
forces used tear gas, clubs, whips, and dogs in those campaigns. 
<H5>  TRIAL OF AL-SHA'B JOURNALISTS ASSAILED; CORRUPTION </H5>
HIGHLIGHTED 
  The paper features several articles on the interrogation of 
AL-SH'AB journalists for their campaigns against "corruption" 
and in defense of freedoms. At the end of an approximately 
2,500-word article in which author 'Abd-al-Sattar Abu-Husayn 
describes how he was taken to be interrogated and then to prison 
for an article he had written about corruption in a military 
factory, Abu-Husayn says: "I wanted to tell my story without 
discussing its legal dimensions or the contents of the 
indictment. I only wanted to stress that we will not be 
intimidated by such restrictions, and we will not retreat from 
the gains we made in the field of freedom of the press, which is 
the only field in which we made progress over an entire decade." 
  --A 500-word article by columnist Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus on 
page 12 urges Defense Minister Muhammad Husayn Tantawi to 
investigate "the human rights violations" to which AL-SHA'B 
journalist 'Abd-al- Sattar Abu-Husayn was subjected. The writer 
notes that Abu-Husayn was put in a military jail, was 
interrogated secretly in the absence of the Journalists 
Association or any lawyer, and remained for two days without 
anyone knowing his whereabouts or the charge against him. 
  --In an approximately 3,000 word article on page five, Labor 
Party deputy leader Dr. Muhammad Hilmi Murad discusses the 
legalities of court cases against AL-SHA'B. He maintains that 
the aim of such interrogations is "to frighten writers and 
journalists so that they will abandon their campaign against 
corruption and their exposition of the corrupt." 
  --An approximately 1,300-word article by Muhammad Mutawalli 
'Awad on page six maintains that "the vicious onslaught" against 
the Labor Party is part of "government terrorism" against its 
opponents. Expressing confidence in the fairness of the Egyptian 
judiciary, the writer calls on AL-SHA'B journalists not to fear 
trial. He writes: "They have poured their anger onto the Labor 
Party and the Islamic trend since the Islamic awakening became a 
fact not only in Egypt, but also throughout the Islamic world." 
He adds that the Islamic awakening triumphed even in Turkey, 
which the infidels took as a model of secular civilization. 
"The Islamic trend in Turkey," the writer goes on to say, 
"achieved a dazzling victory in the country's largest cities, 
Ankara and Istanbul. This made the enemies of God's shari'ah 
who were educated at the hands of the West, especially the 
ruling party [in Egypt], go berserk. The ruling party feared 
the inevitable fate that awaits it when free and clean elections 
are held in Egypt, elections that are not controlled by the 
Interior Ministry's computer, the security agents, or bullies. 
The opposition parties, foremost of which is the Islamic trend 
represented by the Labor Party and the Muslim Brotherhood, will 
challenge the National Democratic Party to score even a relative 
success." 
  --A 700-word article by Ahmad al-Suyufi on page two notes 
that almost all AL-SHA'B journalists have been interrogated. 
"We have never known in Egypt's entire history a political 
group that was pursued and brought before this immense number of 
prosecutors and courts in such a way," he says. The writer 
defends AL-SHA'B's policy and says the trials "will not prevent 
us from adhering to our cause; they will not intimidate us, will 
not resolve your crisis, and will not provide support for you." 
  --A related 400-word report by Ashraf Khalil on page one 
says 
that the Freedoms Committee of the Journalists Association has 
called for a sit-in on 14 April "to protest the recent flagrant 
violations of press freedoms." The committee condemned measures 
against the AL-SHA'B military editor 'Abd-al-Sattar Abu-Husayn. 
<H5>  WRITERS DISCUSS DIALOGUE, MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD </H5>
  An approximately 1,500-word article by Chief Editor Majdi 
Ahmad Husayn on pages one and two discusses the upcoming 
national dialogue and conditions for its success. The writer 
says the dialogue must concentrate on political reforms, as this 
is "the real beginning for eliminating violence and terrorism." 
He says participants in the dialogue need to agree on the 
nature and mechanisms of the political system. Husayn also 
stresses the need for "a healthy climate" for the dialogue, such 
as giving the opposition free access to radio and television and 
abolishing the state of emergency in the country. He contends 
that "violence flourished and grew in the lab of the emergency 
law." He adds: "Dealing with the Islamic groups in the logic 
of a continuous state of emergency has made the situation worse. 
Issuing a law on combating terrorism is one thousand times 
better than imposing government terrorism--through the state of 
emergency--on everybody." Calling for the inclusion of all 
political forces in the dialogue, Husayn says: "The opposition 
parties should insist on the representation of the Muslim 
Brotherhood in the dialogue, and the ruling party should 
reconsider its position in this regard." Finally, Husayn urges 
that the issue of corruption be placed high on the agenda of the 
national dialogue. 
  --A related 800-word article by Muhammad Jamal Hishmat on 
page eight says that freedoms should be unleashed so that the 
dialogue can be held among equal parties. The writer argues: 
"The terrorism from which all of us are suffering grew and 
prospered in prisons and detention centers, when freedoms were 
absent, and when the voice of bullets was louder than the voice 
of right, justice, and humanity." 
<H5>  YOUTHS URGED TO REJECT ANTI-ISLAMIC POLICIES </H5>
  An approximately 3,000-word article by Muslim Brotherhood 
figure Ahmad al-Malat addresses the youth, telling them to raise 
the banner of Islam and reject corruption. He discusses the 
problems of the country and maintains that Islam has the 
solution to all of them. Noting that "Egypt is up to its ears in 
usury debts" that greatly burden the nation, al-Malat says that 
the Islamic economic system "can save the country from the chaos 
of debt, and put the state's economy in the hands of the people, 
not in the hands of the IMF or the World Bank." Al-Malat then 
discusses corruption and deviation, saying that while the 
government fails to take measures against the corrupt, it takes 
honorable journalists who expose this corruption to court and 
prison. Turning to other anti-Islamic campaigns, al-Malat says 
that "the Islamic curricula in schools have suffered under the 
pretext of enlightenment, the role of al-Azhar in showing people 
what is good and what is bad for them has been dwarfed, and 
those who falsely claim knowledge have encroached upon ulema." 
Al-Malat then urges youths to read Islamic books and 
literature, to pursue science and knowledge, to propagate the 
message of Islam, and not to "leave the field to the secularists 
and infidels." In an implicit criticism of the government's 
Middle East policy, al-Malat addresses the youths saying: "Do 
not expect good from those governments that have agreed to 
remain idle, evaded their responsibilities, sold out the land 
and honor, and stretched out their hands to God's enemies, 
befriending them while preventing the owners of the usurped land 
from defending their lands, as if they were captives on the land 
of Egypt, unable to bear arms to defend their land and honor. 
It is as though their cause was not ours, and we are trying to 
mediate between a displaced people and those who inherited their 
land, gave it their name, decided that its borders extend from 
the Nile to the Euphrates, and, moreover, declared holy 
Jerusalem as its capital." Speaking of the rulers, al-Malat 
says: "They struck the word jihad from their dictionaries and 
hid it from children's school books." He urges the youths to 
rebel: "Tell them that jihad will continue until the day of 
judgment, and that the youths who sold themselves to God are 
more eager for death than you are for life." He adds: "Tell 
them: We will not accept your humiliating life, we will live on 
the bare minimum, and we will boycott all their industry and 
trade. We will eat what we grow and wear what we make. We will 
remain the soldiers of right, and a new Saladin will emerge from 
among us, avenging wounded Jerusalem so that God's word will 
remain the highest. Conclude whatever treaties the evil in you 
may want to conclude, and run after the mirage of peace that 
will never come, but we will not abide by the treaties you 
conclude and the restrictions with which you chain our people." 
<H5>  HAMAS ATTACK IN 'AFULA PRAISED </H5>
  An approximately 2,000-word article by columnist Mahjub 
'Umar 
praises the attack of Islamic Resistance Movement-Hamas against 
Israelis in 'Afula on 6 April. The writer discusses Israel's 
"repeated massacres" against Palestinians since the 
establishment of Israel and says that the 'Afula attack "came to 
shatter their [the Israelis] self-conceit and instill horror in 
their hearts." He says the attack is a martyrdom-seeking 
operation, with its hero "opening doors to a great future for 
his Arab and Islamic nation and his heroic Palestinian people." 
<H5>  AL-GHAZALI CRITICIZES MUSLIMS' REACTION TO HEBRON MASSACRE </H5>
  In his "This Is Our Religion" 250-word column on page 12, 
Islamic preacher Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali discusses and 
laments the Islamic situation following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre. He notes how the Israelis glorified the attack on 
Muslim worshipers and how the U.S. President wanted to delay a 
Security Council condemnation until after the Arabs agreed to go 
ahead with the peace talks. Commenting on this position by 
President Clinton, al-Ghazali says: "What do you expect from a 
man who sat for two hours chatting with Salman Rushdie in 
support of his freedom of opinion? And what opinion? Insulting 
Muhammad, may peace and prayers be upon him, and his family." 
Al-Ghazali then criticizes Arab writers: "Some of them said 
that the regrettable incident should not stop the peace process! 
The Arabs have come to their knees begging for peace--which is 
actually capitulation." He says Muslims were expected to cancel 
their feasts after the massacre and discuss their plight locally 
and internationally, but "secret forces" wanted them to forget. 
Al-Ghazali concludes: "If media in the Islamic countries 
continue to pursue these treasonous policies, the Islamic world 
will be on its way to loss."

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 15 April 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Labor Party Criticizes Emergency Law Extension 
  2. AL-AHRAM Bans Publication of Fahmi Huwaydi's Column 
  3. Conference on Minorities in the Arab World 
  4. Writer Blames Government for Violenc 
  5. 'Adil Husayn Article Comments on Emergency Law Extension 
  6. Conference in Support of Palestinian People 
  7. Rise of Islamic Influence in Turkey 
  8. Iran Supports Pakistan's Nuclear Program 
  9. Corruption in Egypt 
<H5>  LABOR PARTY CRITICIZES EMERGENCY LAW EXTENSION </H5>
  On pages 1 and 7, AL-SHA'B carries a 350-word report on a 
statement issued by the Labor Party Political Bureau commenting 
on the People's Assembly's extension of the Emergency Law for 
another three years effective 1 June 1994. The statement says 
that "the only justification which the government has made for 
extending the emergency law is fighting terrorism." The 
statement notes, however, that acts of terrorism have actually 
increased and escalated under the emergency law, which goes to 
prove "that this law is one of the reasons for the growth of the 
phenomenon of terrorism in Egypt." The statement adds that one 
of the aims of the Emergency Law is to "weaken the opposition 
forces" in the coming People's Assembly and local councils 
elections. The statement further notes that this law 
"conflicts" with the government's call for a national dialogue. 
<H5>  AL-AHRAM BANS PUBLICATION OF FAHMI HUWAYDI'S COLUMN </H5>
  AL-SHA'B carries a front-page 50-word report that "a column 
by Fahmi Huwaydi that the newspaper AL-AHRAM publishes regularly 
every Tuesday has been banned." The reports adds that the 
banning of the column "Dialogue on the Application of the 
Shar'iah" comes in the wake of the recent campaign against this 
writer, a campaign that has culminated in the publication of two 
articles in Al-ARAM by two of Huwaydi's colleages. 
<H5>  CONFERENCE ON MINORITIES IN THE ARAB WORLD </H5>
  A 250-word report on pages 1 and 7 says Sudan has officially 
asked Egypt to prevent the holding of a conference on 
"Minorities in the Arab World" due to be held in Cairo in May. 
The conference has been called at the urging of the rebel 
leaders in Southern Sudan. A letter reportedly sent by Sudanese 
Foreign Minister Husayn Abu Salih to Egyptian Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa expresses concern over the aims of the conference "in 
light of the foreign plots and designs aimed partitioning Sudan." 
<H5>  WRITER BLAMES GOVERNMENT FOR VIOLENCE </H5>
  A 2,000-word article on page 3 by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im says 
the Egyptian government has resorted to "crude repression" of 
its political opponents while opting for peace in dealing with 
the "criminal Jews." The writer says "Egypt is living through 
the most critical phase of its history," and adds that "for the 
first time we see Egyptians fighting each other and blood being 
spilled everywhere." The writer notes that like all the states 
of the region, Egypt is witnessing "an overwhelming Islamic 
awakening" affecting all aspects of life and that "society is 
gradually turning toward Islam." The writer says the Islamic 
movement in Egypt is the strongest in the region in view of its 
history and long experience. The Islamic movement "aims to 
establish an Islamic state." The writer adds that "despite the 
propaganda campaign against it, the Islamic Group [al-jama'ah 
al-islamiyah] enjoys widespread support in the quarters where it 
is active." 
<H5>  'ADIL HUSAYN ARTICLE COMMENTS ON EMERGENCY LAW EXTENSION </H5>
  A 2,000-word article on page 7 by Labor Party Secretary 
General 'Adil Husayn deals mainly with the People's Assembly's 
extension of the Emergency Law for another three years. Husayn 
wonders why the People's Assembly hurriedly approved this 
extension, given that the current law expires in two months. 
Acknowledging that the extension is a reality and that nothing 
can be done about it, he asks the Government to adhere to the 
provisions of this "black law which, despite its ugliness, does 
not permit the torture of detainees." After noting that torture 
has become widespread and systematic in Egyptian prisons, he 
says "this fascistic torture is not allowed by the Emergency 
Law" and "this continuing detention of the thousands--despite 
court release orders--is a blatant violation of the emergency 
law." Rebutting as "misleading" the government's argument that 
the emergency law is solely intended for use against terrorists 
and does not target ordinary citizens or political opponents, 
Husayn cites the "indiscriminate" arrest of citizens and the 
months-long siege of entire cities. He also cites the arrest 
and intimidation of citizens who attend opposition party 
congresses and rallies. Husayn concludes that the continuation 
of the emergency law since 1981 is not intended to confront 
"armed violence" but to spread "general fear" and "muzzle" the 
opposition. 

<H5>    CONFERENCE IN SUPPORT OF PALESTINIAN PEOPLE </H5>
  A 500-word report by Khalid Yunis on AL-SHA'B's page 4 says 
"The Egyptian Committee in Support of the Palestinian People's 
Struggle" held its second conference at the Lawyers Association 
on 12 April. Addressing the conference, Labor Party's Ibrahim 
Shukri said "Israel was planted in the region" to break the Arab 
and Islamic ranks. He reviewed Israel's "belligerent" practices 
from its destruction of the Iraqi nuclear reactor to its attacks 
on southern Lebanon, noting that Israel enjoys the "absolute 
support" of the United States, which supplies it with the most 
sophisticated weapons. Shukri denounced the Arab governments' 
harassment of the Palestinians regarding their movement and work. 
  Muslim Brotherhood Spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudaybi called "for 
the need to adopt practical steps to support the struggling 
Palestinian people." He noted that the PLO-Israeli Government 
agreement aims at "ending the intifadah at the hands of the 
Palestinian force which will replace the occupation forces." 
Al-Hudaybi noted that Egyptian television played down the 
Hebron massacre while it highlighted the interview with former 
al-Shawqiyun terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi, whom he describes as 
an "intelligence agent." 
<H5>  RISE OF ISLAMIC INFLUENCE IN TURKEY </H5>
  A 250-word report on page 8 says the Islamic Welfare Party 
in 
Turkey has organized a huge demonstration in Istanbul to protest 
the "massacre" of Muslims in Bosnia. The 5,000 demonstrators 
called on the Turkish Government and the Islamic states to sever 
relations with the Yugoslav Federation. They also marched to 
the U.S. Consulate and pelted it with stones. The report notes 
the Welfare Party's victory in the recent municipal elections in 
Ankara, Istanbul, and other Turkish towns. 
<H5>  IRAN SUPPORTS PAKISTAN'S NUCLEAR EFFORTS </H5>
  A 500-word report on page 8 by Ayman 'Ali cites a speech 
that 
Iranian Consultative Assembly Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri 
delivered to the Pakistani Parliament recently. Nateq-Nuri 
said that "the West is trying to put pressure on the Islamic 
states so that they will remain at its mercy." He affirmed 
"Iran's support for Pakistan's nuclear efforts," denounced the 
pressure on Islamabad to abandon its nuclear program, and asked 
"why is Israel not coming under the same pressure?" 
<H5>  CORRUPTION IN EGYPT </H5>
  AL-SHA'B carries a 1250-word report on page 9 which says 
that on 12 April the Youth Committee of the Lawyers Association 
discussed a paper submitted to it by AL-SHA'B Chief Editor Majdi 
Ahmad Husayn on corruption in Egypt. In his paper, Husayn says 
"political corruption" is the most serious because it directly 
affects society and becomes an example to others and a way of 
life. He adds that "when the higher leadership entrusted with 
fighting corruption itself becomes corrupt, society enters a 
vicious circle." As for social corruption, it is manifested by 
the spread of financial and administrative corruption in 
society, which makes it difficult for citizens to earn an honest 
living. Hence, breaking the law becomes a rule of survival. As 
for moral corruption, it is similar to political corruption. 
The state-owned media encourage this corruption, which is 
apparent in the legalizing of alcohol, gambling, houses of 
prostitution, and pornographic films. Husayn attributes the 
spread of political corruption to several factors, the most 
important of which is the absence of real democracy since 1981. 
Consequently, a ruling class has emerged that has no clear 
message and whose only concern is to remain in power. On the 
ways of stopping the wheel of corruption, Husayn calls for the 
passing of a law on prosecuting ministers and strengthening the 
independence of the courts. 
  Muslim Brotherhood Representative Salah 'Abd-al-Maqsud then 
spoke about the importance of education as a way to reform. 
This includes training the "soul to fight vice through hand, 
mouth, and heart." However, he added, it seems that "fighting 
vice by word of mouth" has become every difficult now that the 
press has been muzzled and in view of the restrictions on the 
printing of magazines and publications. 
  Husayn Jabir Muhammad and Muntasir al-Zayyat spoke on behalf 
of the Islamic Group. Muhammad noted that the root cause of 
corruption is the "separation between state and religion and the 
non-application of the Islamic shari'ah." Al-Zayyat referred to 
the importance of upholding morals in addition to legal measures 
to prevent the spread of corruption. 
  Muslim Brotherhood Spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudaybi called on the 
various parties and trends to put aside their differences and 
concentrate on fighting corruption.

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 19 April 
issue of Cairo `AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  Contents: </H5>
  1. Writer Assails Emergency Law, Campaign Against Islamists 
  2. Detainees Allegedly belonging To Muslim Brotherhood 
Released 
  3. British Newspaper's Interview With Shaykh al-Ghazali 
Cited 
  4. Muslim Brotherhood Official Notes 'Plots' Against Islam 
  5. Islamic Conference Warns Of Proselytization Danger 
  6. Islamist Notes Jews' Policy, Claims 
<H5>  WRITER ASSAILS EMERGENCY LAW, CAMPAIGN AGAINST ISLAMISTS </H5>
  AL-SHA'B carries on pages one and three of its 19 April 
issue 
a 2,800-word article by its chief editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn 
strongly attacking the government's extension of the Emergency 
Law and the long-running campaign of arrests and torture, 
especially against Islamists and Labor Party members. 
  He says that, while the government claims no one has been 
affected by the emergency law, Islamic preacher Shaykh Muhammad 
al-Sharif is behind bars with no charges made or reason given 
except that he contradicted the prime minister. In addition, 
"our colleague" 'Abd-al-Sattar is in the military prison, Husayn 
writes. He adds that everyone knows that arrest warrants 
containing no charges have been issued against journalists in 
past years, including against 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im, who was 
subjected to severe torture. Husayn notes that President 
Mubarak has not tried for even one day to rule without the 
Emergency Law, although it would have been in his and the 
country's interest to try to rule for at least one year without 
the Emergency Law. Pointing out that over the past years the 
government has turned toward the use of force instead of 
persuasion, he says incidents of political violence were rare 
before the 1952 revolution, but nowadays terrorist attacks are 
almost daily events. 
  Reviewing the government's policy of "physical liquidation" 
and the campaign against the Islamic Alliance which represents 
"the forces of moderation in the Islamic arena," Husayn says 
that 180 mosques were stormed by police in 1988 and that in 
al-Minya, one mosque was stormed 166 times. He says: "While 
questioning the prime minister and the interior minister at the 
People's Assembly, I emphasized that the use of the iron-fist 
policy against the Islamic resurgence will only aggravate the 
situation; and regrettably this is what has actually happened." 
He notes that the government's policy of force and arrests led 
to the emergence of the Islamic movement al-Shawqiyun and 
prompted al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah's shift toward armed struggle. 
<H5>  DETAINEES ALLEGEDLY BELONGING TO MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD RELEASED </H5>
  An 80-word front-page report in AL-SHA'B says the Higher 
State Security Prosecution has decided to release local council 
members in Dumyat belonging to the Labor Party after a two-month 
detention. The paper adds that the authorities fabricated 
charges against them of belonging to an illegal organization, 
meaning the Muslim Brotherhood. 
<H5>  BRITISH NEWSPAPER'S INTERVIEW WITH SHAYKH AL-GHAZALI CITED </H5>
  In an approximately 800-word report on page 3, AL-SHA'B 
cites 
an article published by the British newspaper THE GUARDIAN on 
the situation in Egypt, decline in tourism, and Egypt' fear of 
Islamic resurgence. The newspaper's writer notes that 
terrorists are not the greatest threat to Mubarak, because the 
policy of shoot to kill and mass arrests have shaken them. But, 
the writer adds, moderate Islamists are the ones who are 
apparently pushing Egypt toward an Islamic state. 
  The article also includes an interview with Shaykh Muhammad 
al-Ghazali. Asked by THE GUARDIAN about his stand on any 
Egyptian Government that fails to fulfill its duty toward Islam, 
al-Ghazali says: "If any government fails to do this, then I 
have the right to call on the people to change that government; 
and this can be done through the ballot boxes." When asked if 
there are free elections in Egypt, he replies: "You should ask 
those who go the polls." Replying to another question, 
al-Ghazali says: "If you Europeans have forsaken your spiritual 
leadership, am I supposed to do the same? My answer is no." He 
adds: "I want my religion to be strong because I want my nation 
to be strong and able to defend itself. We have been defeated 
militarily. We are a defeated nation and the only way for us to 
restore our strength and self-respect is through religion." 

<H5>    MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD OFFICIAL NOTES 'PLOTS' AGAINST ISLAM </H5>
  AL-SHA'B carries on page 5 an approximately 1500-word 
article 
by Deputy Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood Mustafa Mashhur noting 
"foreign plots" against Islam. He says that the conspiracy of 
the "crusader and Zionist alliance against Islam has never been 
stronger than it is today" and that the Islamic world has never 
been weaker than it is today. He adds: "This diabolical 
scheme--coordinated by the Zionists, crusaders, communists, 
Hindus, and other enemies of Islam--might make the world seem 
black in the eyes of Muslims and make them wonder if Islam has 
any future on earth." 
  Mashhur says that some people demand a speedy solution 
because the enemies will not wait but continue their attacks 
every day. They say if we do not find a solution, the enemies 
will destroy the Muslims before they can react. But we say that 
afflictions are grace in the form of calamity, because the early 
Muslims triumphed over their enemies even though they were a 
minority and were surrounded by Jews, Persians, and Romans in 
Mecca and Medina. For example, he says, the Bosnian people were 
completely lost under communism and most of them forgot Islam 
but after the tragedy they reverted to Islam, began to fight 
under the banner of Islam, formed a combatant army, and became 
more aware of Islam and clung to it so that now their plight has 
aroused the feelings of millions of Muslims. 
  He points out: "The enemies' dream of the possibility of 
destroying Islam and the Islamic awakening will not come true, 
God willing. Their very tactics of war consolidate, expand, and 
strengthen the Islamic resurgence." He says that the West has 
shifted from a religion that opposed knowledge to a knowledge 
that fights religion, from a religion without culture to a 
culture without religion, from a religion that exalts the world 
hereafter to a religion inclined toward materialism, and from a 
religion that revered God and disparaged man to one that 
glorifies man and disregards God. Mashhur then argues that 
Islam alone is what rectifies this disorder because it is a 
religion that does not fight knowledge and culture, but has 
produced the enormous scientific progress from which Europe 
learned in its renaissance. Islam is the religion that founded 
the most perfect civilization in history. 
  Under the subhead "The Jews Are Behind Every Corruption and 
Enmity," Mashhur then writes that the Jews are the killers of 
prophets who have been behind "every weird, deviant principle." 
He says they have been behind communism that persecuted and 
killed millions of Muslims in Russia and behind the downfall of 
the Ottoman caliphate and the transformation of Turkey into a 
secular state. Then he notes: "But we see this Islamic 
renaissance and Islamic voice rising again in the skies of 
Turkey." 
  Continuing his criticism of the Jews, Mashhur says the al- 
Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has revealed the Jews' intentions 
toward the Muslims but that the "free and proud Palestinian 
people will not surrender to them." He adds that the Muslims 
will not leave the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem captive to the 
Jews no matter how much material force they possess or how much 
help they gain from hostile powers. "It is the duty of all 
Muslims to liberate the whole of Palestine. A state that has 
been established on oppression cannot be stable or survive", he 
remarks. 
  Mashhur goes on: "When Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
carried out reprisals for the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, we 
saw Rabin strongly criticizing the king of Jordan for allowing 
Hamas to operate from Jordan, and we regret Jordan's compliance 
with his request. It is strange that we should hear that a 
Zionist delegation participated in a conference in Oman to 
discuss water issues and in another conference in Qatar on 
banning nuclear weapons." He adds that the Jews foment sedition 
and disturbances in Islamic countries and that the Jewish lobby 
influences the U.S. Congress and President because of their role 
in his election. He goes on to say: "So the President began to 
act according to their guidance, speak on their behalf, proclaim 
Jerusalem the capital of the Zionist entity, provide them with 
all types of weapons, and allow them to possess nuclear arms 
which he denies to other countries. But the day will come when 
the American people realize the danger and damage they incur 
from supporting this Zionist enemy, which is concerned only in 
its own interest." 
  Concluding his article, Mashhur urges all Muslims to be wary 
and learn from these "predicaments" to distinguish between 
honest people and liars and to follow in the steps of the 
Prophet and his companions by having faith, unity, and cohesion. 
He says they must have faith that "Islam is coming, God 
willing." 
<H5>  ISLAMIC CONFERENCE WARNS OF PROSELYTIZATION DANGER </H5>
  In an approximately 250-word report on page 7, AL-SHA'B says 
the international Islamic conference, held at al-Azhar 
University under the sponsorship of al-Azhar's shaykh, has 
warned of the danger of proselytization movements, especially 
the American ones, in Egypt and other Arab countries. He 
considers such movements to be one of the foreign impediments to 
Islamic action. The report adds that the conference emphasized 
that the "resurgence of Islamic and Arab countries from their 
backwardness is contingent on the application of the Islamic 
shari'ah, which is the basis of their progress and strength." 
<H5>  ISLAMIST NOTES JEWS' POLICY, CLAIMS </H5>
In an approximately 350-word article on page 12, Shaykh 
Muhammad al-Ghazali writes that the Israelis aim to expand 
"whenever they see the Arabs disregard Islam." He says that the 
Jews claim Egypt as their land and say that the land on which 
their ancestors lived must be returned. He then adds: I have 
the right to ask where are the peace plans the Jews offer to the 
Arabs?"

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 19 April 
issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Al-Azhar Rector, Scholars Address Islamic Action 
Conference 
  2. Awqaf Minister, Ulema Answer Students' Questions 
  3. Government Spends 200 Million Pounds on Mosques 
  4. 'AQIDATI Convoy Scholars Explain Islamic Views

Expression 
  6. Writer Slams U.S., UN, NATO Inaction in Gorazde 
  7. Jordanian Scholar Views Islam, Terrorism 
<H5>  AL-AZHAR RECTOR, SCHOLARS ADDRESS ISLAMIC ACTION CONFERENCE </H5>
  An approximately 2,000-word report on pages 1 and 11 reviews 
statements made at the Islamic Action Conference, Present and 
Future, organized by the Islamic Universities League in 
cooperation with the al-Azhar Mosque. Addressing the 
conference, Al-Azhar Mosque rector Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali 
Jad-al-Haqq exhorts Muslims to "discard their dogmatic disputes, 
solve their problems, and build themselves" so they can take 
their place in "the new world order." He notes that divisions 
among Muslims would lead to destructive wars and negatively 
affect Muslim minorities in the world. He wonders if the 
Islamic nation is capable of confronting the "external and 
internal intrigues designed to sow dissension between the 
peoples and their governments." Al-Azhar University Vice 
President Ja'far 'Abd-al-Salam says that what is meant by 
Islamic action involves all deeds, writings, and moves aimed to 
teach the Islamic religion and spread Islam so that it will have 
the upper hand in the Islamic countries. He notes the 
importance of Islamic action in the media, particularly 
satellite media, to "spread true Islam" and dispel the "deviant 
image" of Islam. The media, he says, can do the job that Muslim 
armies did in the early days of Islam to propagate this religion 
worldwide. Dr. Muhammad Kamal, head of the Shari'ah College at 
Alexandria University, warns of the danger of Western 
information media organs, which convey a "distorted image of 
Islam and Muslims and oppose any attempt to correct it." 
Al-Azhar University professor Ibrahim 'Isa calls for an Islamic 
preparation of the education curricula in the Arab and Islamic 
countries. He warns against introducing foreign education 
curricula because non-Islamic curricula would "entrench the 
divisions and disarray" among the Arab and Muslim countries and 
"threaten their identity." 
<H5>  AWQAF MINISTER, ULEMA ANSWER STUDENTS' QUESTIONS </H5>
  A 500-word report on page 2 elaborates on a gathering at the 
Law College in al-Minufiyah University between an enlightenment 
convoy led by Awqaf Minister Mahjub, a number of al-Azhar ulema, 
and some students. Al-Minufiyah Governor Counselor 'Adli Husayn 
says that there are "serious phenomena" in Egypt that need 
debate. He stresses that the youths are living in a time in 
which the cards have been shuffled, noting that the state should 
heed and answer their questions. Responding to a question from 
a student who notes that there are those who maintain that Egypt 
is an atheist state because it does not apply Islam, a 
psychology professor at a Cairo university says that the most 
serious menace is the sedition the extremist factions are trying 
to foment. He says that they "raise the slogan of Islam to 
subvert Egypt and strike at Islam." He urges the students to 
reject the extremists' ideas because their aim is to kindle 
sedition and not to promote Islam. On the stance of the state 
and al-Azhar on hostile trends, al-Azhar Mosque scholar Sayyid 
Sa'ud says al-Azhar is assailed because it refuses to condone 
the extremists's actions. He notes that al-Azhar will not serve 
certain ideology, noting that these extremists realize the 
influence and role of al-Azhar and that is why they assail it. 
<H5>  GOVERNMENT SPENDS 200 MILLION POUNDS ON MOSQUES </H5>
  A 50-word report on page 2 cites Awqaf Minister Mahjub as 
saying that the government this year allocated $200 million 
pounds to build and renovate mosques throughout Egypt. He says 
that the government will spare none of the funds necessary to 
make the mosques look befitting the lofty status of Islam and to 
"purge them of extremism." 

<H5>    'AQIDATI CONVOY SCHOLARS EXPLAIN ISLAMIC VIEWS </H5>
  The paper features an approximately 2,200-word report on 
page 
4 on 'AQIDATI enlightenment convoy's visit to the city of 
al-Dakhilah in al-Wadi al-Jadid. In a seminar attended by a 
large number of the city's inhabitants, al-Azhar scholar Sabri 
'Abd-al-Ra'uf stressed that Islam has "nothing to do with 
terrorism" and that killing innocent people is rejected by 
Islam. The "evil faction" that does this seeks to "destroy the 
homeland," he says. 'AQIDATI Chief Editor al-Sayyid 
'Abd-al-Ra'uf argues that when youths' issues are broached, we 
can find no authority or system better qualified to address all 
aspects of life than Islam. Dr. Haykal says that the "backbone 
of youths" in Egypt are the "al-Azhar youths." They are 
responsible for learning and teaching Islam. They are the 
safety valve of society, who are qualified to dispel the calls 
for extremism that threaten the nation. On women's work, Dr. 
Haykal says that there is no verse in the Koran that bans 
women's work, but, he notes, Islam exhorts women to dress and 
behave decently. Answering a question on the need for the 1 
billion Muslim population to have a befitting standing in the 
world, Dr. Ibrahim al-Matnawi notes that an Islamic awakening is 
currently growing worldwide but "malicious enemies" are trying 
to make it a bloody awakening. He notes that there is great 
hope that the Islamic nation will unify its ranks and regain its 
strength. 
<H5>  WRITER URGES AWQAF TO ALLOW PREACHERS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION </H5>
  In a 500-word comment by Basyuni al-Halawani in the "With 
All 
Frankness" column on page 6, he notes that during President 
Mubarak's era writers began to enjoy without fear a great deal 
of freedom of expression. Certain people criticized the state 
of affairs in the Awqaf Ministry to the minister himself, he 
says, adding that others criticized Egypt's religious symbols 
and establishments. He calls on the Awqaf Ministry to allow 
preachers to express their views freely and creatively and not 
to repeat mundane and banal sermons so that they may "win 
credibility" and fight the wave of extremism with "enlightened 
Islamic thinking." 
<H5>  WRITER SLAMS U.S., UN, NATO INACTION IN GORAZDE </H5>
  In a 550-word comment titled "No Condolences in Gorazde" on 
page 10, Majdi Salim says that the Serbs advanced on Gorazde 
with Russian support, but the United Nations, America, and NATO 
did nothing to stop them. "The Serbs and Russians act, but the 
United States, NATO, and the United Nations just talk, " he 
argues. It seems, he says, that the mission of the UN forces in 
Bosnia is to protect the UN observers and watch the tragedy but 
not to protect Gorazde's 60,000 Muslim population from the 
carnage. 
<H5>  JORDANIAN SCHOLAR VIEWS ISLAM, TERRORISM </H5>
  In a 2,000-word undated interview with Shaykh 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
al-Khayyat, former Jordanian awqaf minister and vice president 
of the Royal Academy of the Islamic Civilization in Jordan, on 
page 20, he answers questions on topical Islamic issues. He 
says that the majority of silent Muslims favor moderation, which 
is advocated by Islam. He notes that Islam has nothing to do 
with the acts done by groups that have "deviated from Islam's 
moderation and tolerance," and have resorted to violence. 
Discussing recent dialogues on religions between Christian and 
Muslim scholars, he says that these dialogues helped to clear 
the image of Islam. He notes that the Vatican instructed the 
clergy to denounce campaigns against Islam, notably Salman 
Rushdie's book "The Satanic Verses." He says that the conflict 
between Islam and Communism ended with the demise of Communism 
and disintegration of the Soviet Union.

  [Text] Amman--Three Iraq diplomats have returned home from 
Beirut after Lebanon broke diplomatic links with their country 
over an assassination of an Iraqi dissident in the Lebanese 
capital. 
  The three, including Charge d'Affaires 'Awad Fakhri, flew to 
Amman aboard a royal Jordanian (RJ) flight Thursday morning. 
Two of their colleagues were arrested by Lebanese police as 
they got out of their diplomatic-plate cars at Beirut airport to 
board the flight. 
  The arrest of the two raised to four the number of Iraqi 
diplomats held in Beirut over the April 12 killing of Shaykh 
Talib 'Ali al-Suhayl, who was reported to have been a key figure 
in a foiled plot against Iraqi President Saddam Husayn last year. 
  Mr. Fakhri had demanded that the Lebanese Government, which 
broke diplomatic ties with Iraq after Baghdad refused to lift 
the diplomatic immunity for the two attaches, Muhammad Kazim and 
Khalid Khalaf release the two diplomats. He also refused to 
hand over another attache, 'Ali Darwish, and guard Hadi Hassan, 
the suspected assassin, who were holed up in the Iraqi embassy 
in Beirut since the day of assassination. 
  A Lebanese-Armenian employee of the embassy, George 
Teredjian, who allegedly drove the assassination team to 
al-Suhayl's apartment in Beirut, has also been detained and 
charged with complicity. 
  It was not immediately clear how the embassy stand-off 
ended, 
given the tough statements that Mr. Fakhri had been issuing 
demanding the release of Mr. Kazim and Mr. Khalaf. 
  But analysts speculated that the Iraqis realised that they 
could be in for a long siege by Lebanese police or be exposed to 
a possible storming of the embassy after Friday, the date set by 
the Beirut government for them to leave the country and thus the 
effective end to diplomatic immunity for the building. 
  They also noted that the Lebanese government had instructed 
its lone diplomat in Baghdad, Sa'd Zakhya, to leave Iraq 
immediately after the arrest of the two Iraqi diplomats in 
Beirut. 
  Mr. Zakhya left Baghdad in the early hours of April 13, 
shortly after the Beirut arrests, and flew out of Amman for the 
Lebanese capital on April 14. 
  Mr. Darwish and Mr. Hassan were arrested as they arrived at 
Beirut airport to board the flight to Amman on Thursday along 
with Charge d'Affaires Fakhri and two other diplomats, whose 
names were not immediately available. But one of them was 
believed to be the Beirut correspondent of the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY 
(INA). 
  Mr. Fakhri and the other two were allowed to board the 
flight. The Associated Press reported that they were carrying 15 
pieces of baggage weighing 350 kilogrammes, including boxes of 
files and electronic appliances. 
  Journalists covering their arrival at Amman airport reported 
tight Iraqi security that prevented from talking to any of the 
three, who were met by the Iraqi ambassador in Jordan, Nuri al- 
Wayyis al-Tikriti and other Iraqi diplomats. 
  A small scuffle broke out as some Iraqi security men sought 
to seize television films of the arrival of the diplomats from 
Lebanon, news agencies reported. The row was settled with 
intervention by Jordanian security forces, who upheld the right 
of the media to cover the event, the reports said. 
  The three who arrived from Beirut were directly driven from 
Amman airport on the 1,000-kilometre trip to Baghdad, the 
Associated Press quoted Iraqi embassy spokesman 'Adil Ibrahim as 
saying. 
  There was no immediate report from Baghdad of the diplomats' 
arrival there. 
  The Iraqi government has denied Lebanese Prosecutor General 
Munir 'Uwaydat that its intelligence apparatus had ordered the 
killing of al-Suhayl, who held Jordanian and Saudi passports and 
was a known opponent of the Ba'thist regime in Baghdad. 
  According to reports in the Lebanese press quoting 
"confessions" by the two attaches arrested immediately after the 
killing, the order for the assassination had come from Baghdad 
over the telex. The operation was allegedly masterminded by Mr. 
Darwish. 
  Charge d'Affaires Fakhri was called in by prosecutors to 
hear 
the confession of the two, the reports said. 
  An Iraqi Foreign Minister spokesman has accused Lebanon of 
violating the 1961 international convention and regulates 
diplomatic immunity. 
  "It has detained diplomats who possess diplomatic 
immunity... 
charging them with baseless accusation," the spokesman said in a 
statement issued on Wednesday.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "New Regional Spread for Iraqi </F>
Intelligence"] 
  [Excerpts] Beirut, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Well-informed 
Iraqi sources have revealed in contacts with Jordan that the 
plan to assassinate Iraqi oppositionist Talib al-Suhayl was 
jointly drawn up by the intelligence center in Baghdad, the 
Iraqi regional intelligence center in Amman, and the Iraqi 
Embassy in Beirut. The plan was part of a new regional spread 
for Iraqi intelligence. 
  The sources said that the intelligence deputy chief, who is 
the Iraqi president's cousin, received an order from Saddam 
Husayn to watch al-Suhayl's movements once he is notified by the 
Iraqi Embassy in Lebanon of al-Suhayl's presence in Beirut, and 
to draw up a plan to assassinate him, whatever the political and 
diplomatic consequences. 
  The intention was to use some Palestinian agents linked to 
Iraqi organs in Lebanon, but the speed with which the Iraqi 
president's order was issued prompted reliance on Iraqi 
intelligence elements who have diplomatic capacities. 
  Iraqi intelligence elements had been watching al-Suhayl's 
movements for nine months, since the uncovering of an attempt to 
overthrow the regime in Baghdad. [passage omitted] 
  The sources believe that al-Suhayl's assassination is a 
message to Jordanian authorities on the one hand and Lebanese 
authorities and the Syrian Government on the other. Al-Suhayl 
had enjoyed Jordan's protection since 1970. He left Jordan 
after receiving murder threats from Iraqi intelligence. The 
Iraqi Government wanted also to ridicule the Lebanese 
authorities' attempts to restore security to Lebanon in 
cooperation with the Syrian Government. Its intention was to 
carry out an operation such that it would be difficult to 
uncover Iraqi diplomats' implication in it. But chance and 
mistakes in implementation led to the exposure of Iraqi organs' 
implication in this operation. [passage omitted] 
  The sources revealed that their information from inside 
Iraqi 
organs confirms that al-Suhayl's assassination is the start of a 
large-scale plan which exploits the relaxation in relations 
between Iraq and a number of states and the increase in the 
number of Iraqi diplomats present in diplomatic capacities 
primarily in Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar, Yemen, Tunisia, Turkey, 
Morocco, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Russia, France, and Italy. 
The number of these has doubled over the past year. Diplomatic 
missions have been supplied with elements from the intelligence 
and the special security organ or relatives of the Iraqi 
president, as is the case in Jordan, Yemen, Italy, Turkey, 
Libya, Morocco, Qatar, Sudan, and the Iraqi mission in Cairo. 
  The sources revealed that the planned assassination 
operations in Lebanon include the targeting of the embassies of 
a number of states hostile to Iraq. There is also coordination 
in Jordan to carry out similar operations in cooperation with 
pro-Iraqi Palestinian organizations, in addition to planning 
kidnapping operations using Iraqi embassy cars, which enjoy 
diplomatic immunity at land border points. 
  The sources said that the Iraqi Airlines and trade missions 
have accommodated a number of intelligence officers posing as 
technicians and commercial employees, as is the case in Tunisia, 
Mauritania, and Jordan. In Jordan, the Land Transporation 
Company, the Iraqi Trade Coordination Establishment in 
al-'Aqabah, and the Trade Section in Amman are used to this end. 
  The sources believe that part of the political and military 
onslaught which the Iraqi president has been threatening since 
Ramadan [February/March] is devoted to the assassination of 
Iraqi oppositionists and diplomats belonging to states that have 
no relations with the Iraqi Government at present -- Arab and 
foreign states. 
  The sources confirmed that they obtained their information 
from elements working in Iraqi organs and Iraqi embassies 
abroad. They declined to reveal another aspect of their 
information at present for practical and security reasons.

  [Excerpts] In front of leader President Saddam Husayn, may 
God preserve him, a delegation of tribal chieftains, notables, 
and men of religion from various sects in the al-Ta'mim 
Governorate took the oath of absolute allegiance to his 
excellency. In their oath, they stressed their devotion to the 
beloved of the people and builder of modern Iraq. They stressed 
their readiness to sacrifice their souls and valuables in 
defense of the soil of this great homeland and its unity and 
sovereignty. 
  Afterward, in a speech delivered by the al-Ta'mim governor, 
the delegation emphasized to his excellency the al-Ta'mim 
population's sincere loyalty and bravery in times of misfortune. 
They stressed they are standing as an impregnable wall against 
the enemies and that they are always ready for sacrifice and 
struggle under our leader and symbol, may God grant him clear 
victory. [passage omitted] 
  The leader president, may he live long, made valuable 
remarks 
in which he stressed the importance of maintaining one's faith 
in the values and heritage of our nation and homeland. He 
emphasized the importance of adherence to virtues, which should 
always constitute the basis for new generations' upbringing. He 
stressed that the prevailing traditions in the city and among 
tribesmen should be respected and maintained. 
  Addressing the attendees, his excellency said: All the 
Iraqis are the children of the same people. Old and recent 
events are part of our history, for which you have offered dear 
sacrifices. You could not have offered such sacrifices had you 
not been convinced of your stand.

    [Editorial Report] Baghdad Republic of Iraq Radio Network 
in Arabic at 2007 GMT on 23 April, as part of its scheduled 2000 
GMT newscast, carries a 24-minute recording of the "text" of a 
speech delivered by Iraqi President Saddam Husayn when he 
received a delegation from the al-Ta'mim Governorate comprised 
of tribal chieftains, notables, and clergymen of various 
denominations, who pronounced the "oath of total allegiance" to 
the Iraqi leader, reiterating their loyalty and allegiance to 
"the people's loved one and the architect of modern Iraq," and 
underscoring their willingness to sacrifices their lives, and 
all that is dear in defense of Iraq and its unity and 
sovereignty. 
  President Saddam Husayn begins his speech by saluting the 
delegation members, saying: "I do not want to address the 
recent past," but notes that "foreigners" want to make sure that 
no other nations become powerful. He says they "do not want to 
see a hill or a mountaintop on the earth they are treading," but 
does not elaborate. He begins to speak about the past in general 
terms, and recognizes the "dear sacrifices" the Iraqis offered 
in this past. He likens the history of nations to that of men. 
He argues that the history of a nation documents the hardships 
they undergo. 
  Elaborating on this, Saddam addresses the al-Ta'mim 
delegation, saying: "The standing of your people and state is 
commensurate with the magnitude of the sacrifices they make in 
defense of right and justice. We have repeatedly said that we 
do not deem ourselves superior to anybody on the globe, given 
our age-old and rich traditions, and our true Islamic religion, 
which holds all human beings equal in their human worth. 
However, if anybody deems himself superior to us, we become 
dutybound to rectify such a transgression. This has been our 
situation from the outset, and will remain so. We do not 
transgress against anybody. But, whoever transgresses against 
us must calculate the consequences. You have long pledged to 
vindicate Karkuk. The attendees are all noble figures 
representing various denominations, faiths, ethnic groups, and 
tribes. You are all the sons of a single people. Karkuk is 
your city, just as Baghdad is yours. Of course, Karkuk is also 
special. Evildoers, and those benefiting from evil, be they 
near or far, are well aware that evil cannot be entrenched, and 
thus become threatening unless Karkuk turns evil. This is an 
established fact of which we were well aware before 1968, when 
the revolution took place. That is why we place Karkuk on an 
equal footing with al-'Azamiyah and al-Karkh. The law enforced 
in al-'Azamiyah and al- Karkh will also be enforced in Karkuk. 
There can be no other law." [applause] 
  Saddam notes the experiences Karkuk has gone through at the 
hands of "unrestrained outlaws," and underscores the need for 
people to learn from past lessons. He urges the delegation 
members to view themselves as a close-knit family, as "sons of a 
single country." He adds: "You have to deem the wrongdoers 
pardoned by the state as part of you. This should remain the 
case unless they remind you of their old mischief. Then, you 
must punish them for the old and new mischief that they carried 
out. Your state cherishes a host of habits, of which you are 
well aware. These habits reflect the values you cherish and the 
principles you uphold." 
  Saddam preaches tolerance among residents of all Iraqi 
governorates. If an Iraqi hailing from Baghdad wants to settle 
in al-Ta'mim, he must cherish the traditions and values the 
al-Ta'mim residents treasure. But if an Iraqi means mischief, 
he must be confronted firmly, Saddam argues. He says that the 
true Iraqi identity is manifested in "good citizenship and 
patriotism." 
  Iraqis, Saddam argues, should respect the views of the 
majority of the people. Saddam acknowledges the possible 
emergence of differing views on national issues, particularly 
with regard to economy. However, he states that there can be no 
various interpretations when patriotic sentiments are at stake. 
He adds that whoever chooses to abandon his patriotic sentiments 
cannot be called an Iraqi. He goes on to say that the Iraqi 
state, just like Iraqi tribes, cherishes certain values, and 
detests others. Freedom, he argues, cannot allow a person to 
engage in mischief against neighbors. 
  Saddam urges his audience to enlighten their children, sons, 
and daughters about the past, and about the misery they 
experienced in the past. He adds that work, dutifulness, and 
conscientiousness have promoted the Iraqis' lot. He goes on to 
say that the pursuit of such an approach establishes a firm 
course on which one can build. He notes that the regime that 
does not pursue a firm course cannot have firm loyalists 
defending it. 
  Saddam notes the problems facing marriageable young women, 
saying: "I have been informed that when some girls are proposed 
to by cousins, relatives, neighbors, or acquaintances, they say 
that they want bridegrooms who are equal to their fathers in 
stature. Well, do you know how your fathers were in the past? 
Your fathers are now almost 50, or 60 years old. You see that 
his house is covered with marble. You must realize that this 
prestige has been achieved after 60 years of efforts. When your 
father was 20-years old, he did not have this property. This 
means that fathers have not enlightened their daughters as to 
their true state of affairs 20 years ago. This spoils 
daughters, because they would have unrealistic aspirations and 
ambitions. They need to get married to new graduates. How can 
these graduates own a house, a car, etcetera? Can ownership be 
realized by anything other than work?" 
  Saddam urges Iraqis to cherish sublime values, contending 
that car ownership should not turn into a form of ostentatious 
behavior. The same goes for camel or cattle ownership, he says. 
  Saddam argues that Iraqis and Arabs always "viewed money as 
a 
means to a higher end." He urges Iraqi parents to enlighten 
their children about the kind of life they led 20 years ago. He 
also notes that "some boys are also exceeding the proper 
bounds." He expresses the conviction that had the boys been 
enlightened by their parents, they would not have "exceeded the 
proper bounds." 
  Saddam adds: "You are the men of al-Ta'mim. Judging by your 
conduct, one can say that the entire population of al-Ta'mim is 
good. We do not have any concern about al-Ta'mim, nor do we 
have any concern about al-Sulaymaniyah, Irbil, or Dahuk. This 
is because normalcy will eventually prevail." [applause] 
  Saddam adds that the situation brought about by external 
factors will become a thing of the past, from which the Iraqis 
can learn lessons. He adds: "We will exercise amnesty when God 
allows us to." Then, the good-natured men and women will take 
charge, he notes. 
  Saddam goes on to say: "We have no fears about Karkuk or 
Baghdad. We are full of faith that this country is as firm as 
God wants it to be, and as God wants the faithful community to 
be." 
  Afterward, Saddam wishes the al-Ta'mim delegation a bright 
future.

<F P=106> ["Last Word" column by Hamid Sa'id] </F>
  [Text] All U.S. statements on Iraq have lost their 
credibility and aroused anger and ridicule at the same time. 
These statements have always been premeditated, hostile, and 
biased. 
  Many -- if not all -- of these statements fail to convince 
those who hear them. It is noted that U.S. officials issue 
judgments that are supposed to be made by the United Nations or 
the Security Council. Those officials, without even taking into 
consideration the formal side, speak about issues which are the 
main responsibilities of international organizations. 
  In the past, U.S. officials used to drop hints for the 
international organizations with their positions and ideas. 
Today, however, they do not bother themselves with this. 
  Examples of this can be seen in the statements by Michael 
McCurry, official spokesman of the U.S. State Department, on the 
killing of the AFP correspondent in Iraq's Kurdistan and the 
wounding of two UN guards in that area. 
  This U.S. spokesman cited information revealing a hellish 
imagination. We listened to an unbelievable story. He said: 
The United Nations has information that the Iraqi Government 
rewards people who are ready to kill workers in the United 
Nations and in humanitarian organizations. He then spoke about 
the value of these rewards and how they were raised at the 
beginning of March. He then said: If giving these rewards 
proves to be true, they represent violations of the UN 
resolutions. In other words, he is not sure whether or not the 
information is true. 
  It is natural to say that the information -- if there is 
such 
information -- is fabricated by their agents in the area, who 
live under their protection and who play a treacherous and 
terrorist role with the weapons they receive from their masters. 
  Since the area is under their protection and is run by their 
agents, they are responsible for all the crimes and violations 
there. Why don't such acts happen with other UN officials 
throughout the rest of Iraq, despite the Iraqis' rancor and 
rejection of their presence, and despite the fact that hundreds 
of reporters visit Iraq and carry out their tasks under the best 
of conditions, provided by the Culture and Information Ministry? 
  Why do the Americans remain silent about the daily killings, 
looting, and robbery carried out by their agents against Iraqi 
Kurds?

  [Text] Baghdad, 23 Apr (INA) -- Tariq 'Aziz, official in 
charge of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Arab Socialist 
Ba'th Party, today received here a Jordanian Islamic Action 
Front delegation. The delegation, which is currently visiting 
the country, is led by 'Abdallah al-'Akayilah. 
  Tariq 'Aziz stressed that thanks to the wisdom of President 
Saddam Husayn and the resolve of the Iraqi people, Iraq has 
managed to rebuild what the evil and arrogant forces have 
destroyed, despite the continuation of the unjust blockade 
against it. He said that when people have sincere and faithful 
leaders with clear objectives, they manage to hold fast and 
attain their objectives. Such is the case in Iraq, he noted. 
He added: Despite all difficulties, we in Iraq are optimistic 
about the future. 
  Al-'Akayilah praised the Iraqi people's steadfastness and 
courage in confronting the aggressors and the iniquitous 
blockade. He said that Iraq has initiated the phenomenon of 
defying the world's arrogant powers, and that Iraq represents 
the Arab nation's ammunition for confronting the serious plot 
targeting Arabism and Islam. 
  The two sides stressed the importance of cooperation and 
coordination between pan-Arabist and Islamic forces and 
movements in the joint struggle against the imperialist and 
Zionist plots and threats.

  [Text] Baghdad, 23 Apr (INA) -- The international symposium 
on human rights for women has emphasized that the international 
community should adhere to an agreement on children's rights and 
avoid discrimination between children. 
  In a statement issued today at the end of its meetings in 
Baghdad, the symposium denounced the serious violations of 
international laws and humanity that are committed against 
children and women, especially during armed conflicts. The 
statement said that discrimination and the unfair treatment of 
women represent basic injustices and violations of the human 
rights accepted by all international charters and norms. 
  The statement condemned using food and medicine as a tool 
for 
political pressures on world peoples to influence their 
political choices and to undermine their right to freely choose 
their future and their political and economic systems away from 
external intervention. 
  The symposium welcomed the UN General Assembly adoption of a 
declaration on ending violence against women in the public and 
private sectors and to stop all forms of trade in women. 
  The symposium emphasized that countries should join the 
agreement on eliminating discrimination against women and abide 
by its rules in their national legislation and in implementation 
of these rules. 
  The symposium recommended giving priority to funds that are 
allotted for covering the needs of women and children over 
repayment of foreign debts when introducing infrastructural 
adaptation measures the World Bank imposes on Third World 
countries. 
  The symposium emphasized its faith in the principles of the 
UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and 
its commitment to the objectives of the Nairobi strategy on 
improving women's conditions by the year 2000 and on equality 
and development. 
  The international symposium on human rights for women, which 
was held in Baghdad on 20-22 April, was attended by 22 Arab and 
foreign countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oil Minister Safa' Hadi Jawad by Ahmad </F>
'Abd-al-Majid in Baghdad; date not given] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-Majid] What is your assessment of the OPEC 
Geneva conference? 
  [Jawad] At a meeting convened in Geneva last month, the 
price-monitoring ministerial committee of OPEC decided to 
maintain the existing production ceiling of 24.52 million 
barrels per day [BPD] until the end of the year. The agreement, 
which Iraq did not sign, led to a deterioration in oil prices on 
world markets, given that the ceiling far outstrips demand for 
OPEC oil. That applies particularly to the second quarter of 
this year, when demand is expected to fall behind the ceiling by 
1 to 2 million BPD. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Why did Saudi Arabia balk at cutting its 
output quota? 
  [Jawad] Saudi Arabia has benefited the most from the cuttoff 
of Iraqi oil from world markets. In the wake of the sanctions, 
Saudi Arabia's production jumped from 5.38 million PBD -- the 
share set for it by the July, 1990 agreement -- to over 8 
million BPD early this year. Although this substantial increase 
in Saudi Arabia's output was accompanied by a real drop in 
prices, notably in late 1993 and early 1994, the Saudis pressed 
ahead with these high production levels, without reference to 
the interests of other OPEC members. 
  The argument advanced by Saudi Arabia was that in the event 
OPEC cut production to boost prices, non-OPEC producers would 
increase theirs and thus neutralize the intended effect of the 
OPEC action. Incidentally, Iraq has called on all producers, 
both within and outside of OPEC, to pursue production policies 
that should raise their income by balancing output and prices in 
the international market. Many producers from outside OPEC have 
shown a willingness to cooperate in restoring balance to the 
market. However, for this to happen such major producers like 
Saudi Arabia must act responsibly. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] With the current downtrend in oil prices on 
the world market, how will Iraq act if the oil embargo is lifted? 
  [Jawad] The downward trend in oil prices is projected to 
persist for the next five months, when they will rally again. 
  We think that lifting the oil embargo on Iraq will 
contribute 
to a boost in prices, since then OPEC will call an extraordinary 
session and adjust its overall production. Iraq's return to the 
oil market will remove a negative factor that has been having an 
impact on the oil prices. Iraq will also play an influential 
and responsible role in formulating OPEC's production policies 
so as to advance the interests of all interested parties and 
stabilize prices. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] When will the Iraqi contract with the 
French companies become effective? 
  [Jawad] Iraq seeks to expand and diversify its relations 
with 
many foreign companies, including French companies. The latest 
talks with the French side and their results are aimed at having 
good relations with oil companies based on the exchange of 
interests between all parties. As for relations with the French 
companies, Iraq hopes that these companies will take the 
necessary steps and prepare for the lifting of the oil embargo 
as soon as possible. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Will Jordan's share of crude oil be 
increased, or will it continue at the same rates? 
  [Jawad] As you know, Iraq has warm fraternal relations with 
Jordan. The present rates of oil supplies to Jordan depend on 
the quantities required by Jordan and allowed by the United 
Nations. The question of maintaining or increasing the present 
rates depends on coordination between the two sides and the 
relevant UN resolutions. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] How true is the report about constructing an 
Iraqi oil pipeline to the Port of al-'Aqabah? 
  [Jawad] Iraq seeks to increase and diversify its oil 
exporting terminals. The idea of an Iraqi oil pipeline to 
al-'Aqabah is aimed at increasing the flexibility of Iraqi oil 
exportation. Several feasibility studies should first be made, 
taking into consideration political developments and the 
required guarantees for the flow of Iraqi oil from the Port of 
al-'Aqabah. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Which are the U.S. companies that negotiated 
with Iraq on investing new oil fields? 
  [Jawad] Several U.S. companies negotiated with Iraq on 
investing new oil fields, as did companies from other countries. 
These negotiations aim to realize the joint interests of all 
parties, also they are in their initial stages, so we cannot 
predict their outcome. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Twenty-two Congress members asked the U.S. 
President to send equipment to extract oil from the northern 
region of Iraq. What is your comment? 
  [Jawad] The attempts to divide Iraq's unity are pitiful and 
are destined to failure. What some agent quarters and Zionism 
are trying to do is to split the national unity. These attempts 
do not aim to realize the interests of the Iraqi people in the 
northern region. Iraq does not need assistance from suspicious 
quarters under the pretext of assisting its sons. Iraq is rich 
with oil, and can provide all its areas with their oil needs. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] What was the most prominent achievement in 
the oil sector despite the circumstances of siege and oil 
embargo? 
  [Jawad] There have been several achievements in the area of 
oil during the siege, but reconstructing the oil sector after 
the wholesale destruction it suffered was the most prominent 
achievement. In order to know the importance of this 
achievement, we recall that the oil sector suffered brutal 
attacks against all its facilities, and that 180 main sites were 
attacked by missiles and air raids. Two thousand five hundred 
air raids were launched against these sites, and 150,000 bombs 
were fired at them. This reduced the refining capacity to only 
3 percent, and the total costs of damage reached $6 billion, 
according to UN estimates. 
  Since the first day of the cease-fire, the people in the 
oil sector exerted exceptional efforts and used innovative means 
to rebuild the destroyed facilities, thus the refineries once 
again became operational. As for the field of oil extraction, 
the oil facilities were badly damaged and nonoperational. 
During the rebuilding stage, oil experts managed to rebuild 
these facilities and restored them to a better status than prior 
to the aggression. Moreover, the pumping stations, pipelines, 
and oil tanks were rebuilt. 
  Many big and important accomplishments could be added to the 
marvelous rebuilding work. These accomplishments were realized 
through personal efforts--accomplishments that had in the past 
been confined to Western expertise. New potentials were added 
in the oil refining sector with a dependence on potentials and 
expertise that in the past were not sufficiently invested. The 
productive efficiency of our oil facilities is now better than 
it was before the aggression. Cadres were introduced to other 
fields of work other than the oil sector, including the 
industrial and agricultural sectors as well as the sugar plant, 
al-Najaf tire factory, and other industrial plants. We also 
actively participated in completing the leader's river, al-'Izz 
River, Taj al-Ma'arik [Crown of Battles] River, and Umm 
al-Ma'arik [Mother of Battles] River. Work is continuing on a 
project to irrigate al-Jazirah, and the sanitation projects in 
al-Ramadi and al-Fallujah. We also made contributions to 
rebuilding bridges such as al-Qurnah tubular bridge, the bridge 
at al-Majidiyah, the suspension bridge, and leader Saddam's 
double-deck bridge. Moreover, our cadres were able to find many 
alternatives to industrial parts that used to be imported from 
outside. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Is there any inclination to export gas to 
Arab countries, including Jordan, in particular, after the 
discovery of gas reserves in the Western desert? 
  [Jawad] Iraq sought to develop all its hydrocarbon 
resources. 
Some time ago, Iraq adopted a policy to stop wasting gas. The 
gas projects in the North and South clearly show Iraq's concern 
about the amounts of gas produced. Of course, plans to utilize 
gas does not only mean using it locally, but also to export it 
to other nearby or faraway countries. Priority will go to 
nearby countries, especially Arab countries, which will receive 
special attention in terms of exporting gas to them. Foremost 
of these countries is Jordan, which will receive its share of 
exported gas as soon as gas projects are completed and once 
outlets and means to export it outside are available. The 
unfair embargo on Iraq is currently a big obstacle to Iraq in 
terms of developing its gas resources and allowing it to export 
its surplus to nearby countries, including Jordan. Of course, 
the fact that there are new gas reserves in the Western desert 
will contribute to Iraq's ability to export to a nearby country 
like Jordan. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] A Turkish official who recently visited 
Baghdad expects Iraq to start exporting oil this year. What do 
you say about that? 
  [Jawad] We are ready to export oil at any time. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] When to be exact? 
  [Jawad] We expect this to take place in 1994. Oil will be 
pumped through the Turkish pipeline next month. Cleaning work 
on this pipeline is currently underway and will require pumping 
a certain amount of oil. This, in practice, means that we will 
resume the export of oil. This issue is of great importance to 
the Turkish side. The halt in exporting Iraqi oil has caused 
unemployment and security problems. The Turks are the ones who 
insist that we quickly finalize this issue. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Have you thought of special security 
measures 
to protect the aforementioned pipeline from acts of sabotage in 
areas controlled by the Kurds? 
  [Jawad] Protection is available and the Turks are capable of 
securing that. It is illogical that they would take a step like 
this without coordinating their stands with the Kurds.

<F P=106> ["Free Opinion" column by Salah al-Mukhtar: "Correspondents </F>
and the Time for National Action"] 
  [Text] Is it enough for the Arab media man, especially the 
correspondent, to demand the lifting of the embargo on Iraq in 
general through his media and then remain silent waiting for the 
consciences of the executioners crouching in the Western 
capitals, especially Washington, to wake up? The experience of 
the past three years and, indeed, all the good calls by 
journalists, politicians, lovers of freedom and humans in the 
Arab homeland and the world to lift the embargo were in vain 
because the consciences of decision makers in the colonialist 
West are dead and do not allow the calls of goodwill, right, and 
humanitarianism to reach their ears. 
  Hence, the correct national and humanitarian stand of the 
Arab correspondent is no longer to just call for lifting the 
embargo. This is especially so after some Arab governments, 
which made their contributions to the crime of the 30-state 
aggression on Iraq and to imposing an embargo on it, began to 
demand, in one way or another, the lifting of the embargo. 
Indeed, Arab correspondents are dutybound to define what is 
required to urge the appropriate side to lift the embargo. 
  What does this specifically mean? The embargo includes many 
forms. Ahead of these is a ban on imports and exports. 
According to the UN Security Council resolutions, this form of 
the embargo allows exporting many commodities, ahead of which is 
foodstuffs, to Iraq. It also allows the return of Iraqi assets, 
which some Arab governments volunteered to freeze in submission 
to U.S. desires, as well as the return of Iraqi equipment kept 
as a trust in Arab countries. The governments of these 
countries decided not to return or even carry out maintenance 
work on this equipment. 
  In order to realize the imbalance in the stands of some Arab 
governments, we must note that foreign governments, including 
European governments, have recently released frozen Iraqi 
assets, and used the proceeds to send shipments of food and 
medicine. They did so because they understand that UN Security 
Council resolutions do not prevent this. These non-Arab 
governments explained their stand by saying: Iraq is carrying 
out its obligations and the UN Security Council resolutions are 
clear and permit dealing with Iraq under certain limitations. 
  However, many Arab governments have not reached in terms of 
their awareness of their interests and humanitarian feelings the 
level reached by European and non-European countries. Indeed, 
these Arab governments buried their pan-Arab affiliation when 
they turned their countries into shackles that impose the 
embargo and perpetuate it. Although the United States did not 
punish the non-Arab countries that are carrying out direct and 
frank trade deals with Iraq under well-known limitations, some 
Arab governments are reiterating a disgusting pretext by saying: 
We cannot deal with Iraq because we fear the U.S. reaction. 
  Thus, it is a pan-Arab, national, and humanitarian duty for 
Arab correspondent to break the embargo imposed against Iraq. 
They should do this by not being content with generalities. 
Rather, they should specifically and publicly tell their 
governments: Your adherence to the embargo directly contributes 
to prolonging the suffering of the Iraqi people, without there 
being any justification or need. U.S. pressure does not justify 
taking a serious step that does much more harm than the case 
would be if U.S. pressures were rejected. This is because an 
Arab stifling another Arab and starving him to death will have 
grave consequences in the future on each Arab country. 
  Within this context, honorable correspondents should subject 
their governments to some acid tests. So, if the government of 
a certain journalist holds Iraqi funds or equipment, then he 
should raise a basic slogan calling for their release and 
mobilizing the masses to pressure his government. 
  If the government of another correspondent plays the role of 
instigator, in public or secret, calling for maintaining the 
Iraq embargo, then he should expose this and not make peace with 
his government until it yields and gives in to the will of the 
people. Finally, all Arab correspondents are required to 
exercise public, concrete pressure on their governments to 
resume trade with Iraq, after UN committees have confirmed 
Iraq's fulfillment of its obligations. In addition to this, the 
justifications for adhering to the embargo no longer exist, 
legally speaking. It is more important to pay special attention 
to this aspect, since the anti-Arab powers, led by the United 
States, are no longer citing legal justifications for the 
embargo, and are citing instead political reasons, such as human 
rights and others. 
  Any truly nationalist and serious Arab government can 
strongly argue the case for its desire to end the embargo. 
International law, pan-Arab interests, and its own interests 
will support its case and necessitate its ending the embargo. 
  Some might wonder: But, Arab governments could resort to 
violence against correspondents. Well, our answer is clear. 
Supporting Iraq, belonging to Arabism, adhering to the right to 
a decent, free life, and defending independence are goals and 
principles that are not safeguarded by words, but by big 
sacrifices. The history of Arabs and humanity tells us that good 
intentions have no value unless they are supported by precious 
sacrifices. 
  Finally, it is necessary to raise a vital question. The 
embargo will definitely come to an end sooner than many people 
expect, so is it appropriate for any Arab, ruler or subject, to 
see that he has not actively contributed to lifting the embargo 
when foreigners are pouring into Iraq asking for forgiveness and 
opening a new chapter? This question is worthy of consideration 
and deliberation in order to draw some lessons, the most 
important of which is that great stands are not adopted by easy 
talk but by effective actions that are accompanied by great 
sacrifices.

  [Text] Baghdad, 24 Apr (INA) -- An Iraqi political writer 
has said that the new world order adopted by the United States 
cannot last. 
  In an article published in BABIL today, Amir al-Hilu cast 
doubt about the ability of the United States to continue its 
hegemony as the sole international power that wants to control 
the world's resources after the disintegration of the Soviet 
Union and the socialist bloc states. 
  He emphasized that the world cannot be run by a single power 
because this conflicts with the interests of countries, whether 
on their national level, or the level of the international blocs. 
  He said the negative impact of the U.S. policy of hegemony 
and undisputed domination has become clear. This policy, which 
depends on the logic of force, has a negative impact on the 
interests of other countries, as demonstrated in its domination 
of the United Nations and the Security Council and the adoption 
of resolutions that serve the U.S. politician without any 
considerations for the interests of other countries. This has 
happened and is happening now, represented in its insistence on 
maintaining the siege against Iraq, the threat to use force 
against Japan, and the intervention in Somali affairs. 
  The article emphasized that political and economic 
developments in today's world, which the U.S. Administration 
said will be stable and secure under the umbrella of its new 
world order, reflect the falseness of these claims because it is 
a chaotic world in which wars and military interventions prevail.

  [Text] Baghdad, Apr. 24 (INA) -- An Iraqi newspaper said 
that the West which shed tears on human rights maintains 
indifference over human rights abuse in Saudi Arabia. 
  The paper AL-THAWRAH, organ of the Arab Ba'th Socialist 
Party, said the imperialist West defends the Saudi regime which 
throws Saudi strugglers from planes or leaves them in the Sahara 
to face horrible death. 
  The paper said that the Western political deception is an 
expression to the savageness of the colonialist mentality and 
disregard of human rights when the affair is not linked with its 
sphere of hegemony. 
  The paper said that human rights standard should be one in 
the world and must conform with the International Declaration of 
Human Rights and the UN charters and its correct and not 
selective applications. 
  The paper stressed that human rights in Saudi are abused 
while suspicious claims and lies are propagated by the American 
State Department against Sudan, Iraq and other countries.

  [Text] Gentlemen: On the eve of the U.S. secretary of 
state's visit to the region, Israeli officials renewed their 
campaign of casting doubts on the peaceful intentions of both 
Syria and Lebanon in an obvious attempt to foil any possible 
outcome of the visit, even before it starts. Yitzhaq Rabin 
claimed Syria has not yet made a strategic decision on peace. 
He accused the Lebanese Government of failing to provide 
security in the southern border areas. Rabin said Israel does 
not covet a single inch of the territories of Lebanon or Jordan, 
without mentioning the occupied Syrian Golan. He said he is 
ready to withdraw his forces from Lebanon if the Lebanese 
Government disarms the national resistance and provides security 
to the Israeli occupation forces for a trial period of six 
months. His third condition was merging the agent militias or 
South Lebanese Army, which was established by Israel, into the 
regular Lebanese Army and assigning the task of security in the 
south to them. 
  The Israeli rulers have over the last two and half years of 
Washington talks failed to drag Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan to 
partial, inequitable agreements as a result of the three 
countries' adherence to the principles of a just and 
comprehensive peace, the Security Council resolutions, and 
international law. In view of this evident failure, the Israeli 
rulers could do nothing but level accusations, intensify 
falsehoods, and reverse facts. Daily events refute Israeli 
officials' claims and condemn their double-standard policy. 
Syria presented objective and balanced proposals for peace in 
the Middle East at the sixth round. These proposals were 
discussed by the Syrian and Israeli delegations throughout the 
subsequent rounds. However, Israel evaded the Syrian paper 
because it called for full withdrawal from the Golan. Likewise, 
Lebanon has throughout the recent rounds sought to obtain an 
Israeli agreement to implement Security Council Resolution No. 
425, but to no avail. Israel insisted on its well-known 
impossible conditions. 
  Israel wants the Arabs to fully recognize it, to fully open 
their borders with it, to establish economic ties with it, and 
to sign treaties with it, but without committing itself to full 
withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. In the same 
manner as it is talking about testing Lebanon's intentions, it 
is also talking about testing Syria's intentions. Testing 
Syrian intentions will continue for several years. As for 
Lebanon, Israel is looking forward to maintaining control of the 
south through its agents, to whom it is extending both salaries 
and weapons. It stipulates that those agents should be 
responsible for security in the south. All this will take place 
after disarming the national resistance and setting the stage 
for Israel's agents to do what they like in the various areas of 
the south. The situation is not different in the case of 
Jordan, for Israel stipulates that a peace treaty should be 
signed and ties be normalized before any commitment to the 
relevant UN resolutions is announced. 
  Israel wants to drag the Arab parties participating in the 
peace process to partial, phased agreements that consecrate the 
Arabs' relinquishment of Security Council resolutions, the 
Madrid conference formula, and the principles of a just and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East, as it did with the 
Palestinian side. While such phased agreements will secure an 
Arab recognition of Israel and open the markets for its 
products, they do not secure an end to occupation or restoration 
of occupied Arab territories. The region will consequently be 
mortgaged to Israel's policies and expansionist schemes. 
  Syria cannot be swayed by delusions nor can it barter the 
Security Council resolutions with ambiguous promises. Peace, in 
Syria's opinion, is possible immediately after Israel's 
withdrawal from the Golan, southern Lebanon, and the rest of the 
occupied territories, and after Israel's compliance with the 
Security Council resolutions. Syria firmly believes inequitable 
agreements are doomed to failure because they do not lead to a 
just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. A firm and 
stable peace should secure justice, fairness, and equality. In 
other words, partial withdrawal cannot lead to peace. What is 
required is the dismantling of all settlements and the full 
departure of the occupation troops. Only then can the desired 
peace prevail in the Middle East.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] The newspaper TISHRIN today addresses the peace 
process and the recent statements Yitzhaq Rabin has made about 
it. The paper notes that progress in the peace process has long 
been contingent upon moves that Israel, rather than the Arab 
sides, must make, contrary to the claims in this regard by the 
Tel Aviv rulers. Syria and the other concerned Arab sides have 
declared their willingness to achieve full, just, and 
comprehensive peace grounded in the relevant UN Security Council 
resolutions, and the principle of trading land for peace. 
  TISHRIN adds: During the sixth round of the Washington 
bilateral talks, Syria submitted constructive and balanced 
proposals to the Israeli negotiators. Had Israel accepted these 
proposals, peace would have been achieved in the region. 
However, the Tel Aviv rulers, who have been pursuing a policy 
of evasion and procrastination, have thwarted all the Washington 
rounds of talks, one after another, by their refusal to address 
the real issue; that is, Israeli withdrawal from the occupied 
territories. 
  TISHRIN goes on to say: As regards the issue of peace, what 
counts is action, rather than words and statements. The Rabin 
government has continued to earmark huge funds for the building 
and expansion of settlements although Rabin acknowledged the 
need to dismantle settlements. What the Rabin government should 
do in this regard is to curb settlement activities. Rabin is 
well aware that peace with Syria is impossible without the 
restoration of the Golan, and that the policy of evasion, 
procrastination, and circumvention of complete withdrawal will 
only obstruct the Washington talks and delay the achievement of 
durable peace in the region. It is insufficient for Rabin to 
make statements here or there. If his intentions are sincere, 
he must translate them into realities on the ground. 
  TISHRIN says: The upcoming tour of the region by U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher is providing Israel with 
an opportunity to rid the Washington talks of the stalemate 
plaguing them. It could do so by reiterating its willingness to 
withdraw from the occupied territories, implement the relevant 
UN Security Council resolutions to the letter, and subscribe to 
the bases and principles of international law. 
  TISHRIN concludes by saying: Observers hope that the Rabin 
statements will be followed by action. They also hope that they 
are not just a part of a maneuver prompted by the U.S. secretary 
of state's tour of the region, which is designed to end the 
stalemate. Moreover, the opportunities for peace are getting 
harder to foster day after day. Likewise, it is impossible to 
make the slightest progress without a drastic change in the 
Israeli position. 
  The newspaper AL-THAWRAH also comments on the Middle East 
peace process and the upcoming tour of the region by U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher. It holds Israel 
responsible for the tense regional situation that prompted the 
U.S. secretary of state to say that he is not expecting any 
striking breakthroughs. 
  AL-THAWRAH wonders: Does this mean that the U.S. stand 
toward Israel's obstruction of the peace talks, as demonstrated 
prior to the Geneva summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton, will be maintained? 
  The paper says: The U.S. sponsorship of the peace process 
must be promoted so it may result in the implementation of the 
relevant international resolutions if the desired peace is to be 
achieved. Peace cannot be built on usurpation and occupation. 
This is what President al-Asad had in mind when he said that 
peace cannot be built at the expense of others' territories. 
What could prompt the Arabs to work for peace if such peace 
were to result in the abandonment of their territories in favor 
of Israel? 
  The paper continues: This is the sound and objective 
argument constantly set forth by President al-Asad, particularly 
at the Geneva summit. That is why President Bill Clinton said 
that Syria is a key regional player that cannot be overlooked, 
and underscored its potential contribution to stability, 
equilibrium, and peace in the region. 
  AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: Israel has wasted two and a 
half years of peace talks, abusing U.S. tolerance, as well as 
the financial, military, and political support it is receiving. 
This has weakened the opportunities for just and comprehensive 
peace. Besides, Israel has provided all Arabs with evidence that 
it is targeting their lives, territories, and resources. That 
is why they have shown greater determination to confront these 
challenges, and to demonstrate greater firmness in their 
adherence to their rights and territories, as well as a 
willingness to make sacrifices to vindicate them.

  [Text] Gentlemen: Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's 
statement about his willingness to dismantle the settlements in 
the Golan is not a new. It does not contain anything new to 
push the stagnant peace process forward. Rabin wants to precede 
Warren Christopher's tour of the region with statements that 
seem to offer concessions compared to previous positions. He 
wants to give the impression that Israel is offering new 
initiatives that require the other side, -- the Arabs, and 
Syria, in particular -- to offer concessions in return. 
  The objectives of Rabin's attempt are obvious. He seeks to 
direct U.S. pressure -- which is supposed to be directed toward 
the party obstructing the peace process, Israel -- toward Arabs 
who have offered everything in order to make the peace process a 
success. 
  Rabin's statement about Israel's willingness to dismantle 
the 
settlements does not respond to what is stipulated in the terms 
of reference of the peace process regarding the need for full 
Israeli withdrawal, dismantling settlements, and evacuating 
settlers from all occupied Arab territories. 
  According to observers, Rabin's statements are just 
maneuvers 
before Christopher's tour. Rabin previously took positions he 
quickly revoked in order to adopt counter positions. 
  After the Israeli Labor party won in the recent elections, 
the international community expected Yitzhaq Rabin to take the 
initiative to freeze settlement building in implementation of 
his electoral promises. However, after he assumed power, Rabin 
came out with a new theory concerning political and security 
settlements. He allocated great amounts of money in favor of 
settlement building, including U.S. loan guarantees. He did so 
despite the fact that he made a commitment to Washington not to 
spend a single dollar from these loan guarantees on expanding 
settlements. 
  Despite Rabin's continuous talk about his willingness to 
bring momentum to the talks with Syria in order to reach a 
settlement, he has aborted practically every chance of making 
minimal progress. He did this when he instructed his 
negotiating delegation not to get into the issue of withdrawal 
from the Golan. Rabin met Syria's true peace intentions with 
the expansion of settlements in the Golan and the building of 
new ones. 
  Peace in the Middle East requires deeds, not words. Syria, 
along with the Arab parties to the Washington talks, build their 
stands based on Israel's deeds, not its words. Arabs have heard 
a lot of Israel's peace claims, but they have not sensed 
anything tangible in the Washington talks and in the occupied 
Arab territories. Indeed, the reverse is true. 
  For its part, Syria presented a paper containing objective 
and balanced principles and proposals since the sixth round. 
This paper was the center of world attention, except, of 
course, in Israel, which sought to block the adoption of the 
Syrian paper because its sixth article discussed full Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan. 
  The Washington talks, which began two and one-half years 
ago, 
have not achieved the desired results despite sincere Arab 
intentions and because all Israeli officials, from all trends, 
have not directed their attention to peace. These officials 
entered a competitive display of extremism and intransigence. 
Settlement building, of course, was part of this competition. 
The whole world community agrees that the policy of settlements 
totally contradicts peace and that peace and settlements cannot 
coexist and that peace and occupation cannot coexist. The UN 
Security Council resolutions are clear and frank. They do not 
permit occupation and settlements and demand their total removal. 
  The Arabs have not moved from the world's stand. Indeed, 
they have called for the implementation of UN Security Council 
resolutions, the removal of settlements, and the exchange of 
land for peace. If Israel had responded to international law 
and efforts, as well as to true Arab intentions and adopted the 
Syrian proposals, peace would be prevailing in the region today. 
  Despite all the Israeli prevarication, there is an 
opportunity today to achieve firm peace in the region, if Israel 
takes the initiative to withdraw from the occupied Arab 
territories and dismantle all settlements there. 
  The question posed by the observers is: Did Rabin's 
statement 
express a substantive change in the Israeli position, or is it 
just a maneuver to mislead the world public opinion that 
discovered the atrocities of the settlers and the dangers they 
pose to the peace process after the holy Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre? 
  The next few days, which will see a new tour by the U.S. 
secretary of state, is guaranteed to expose the reality of the 
Israeli positions. The peace process is in a real predicament 
and the chances to achieve peace are growing narrower and are 
threatening to disappear.

  [Text] Press commentaries today address the U.S. secretary 
of state's upcoming tour of the region, which is aimed at 
activating the peace process and creating an appropriate climate 
for the resumption of the bilateral negotiations. 
  Under the headline "Israeli Deception," the newspaper 
AL-BA'TH says: On the eve of U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's tour of the region, Israeli officials have 
launched an intensive media campaign aimed at misleading the 
world public in general, and the U.S. public in particular. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has said 
that he is willing to consider the dismantling of settlements in 
the occupied Arab territories, although facts on the ground 
belie these claims. For, the Israeli Government has continued 
to Judaize the occupied Arab territories, particularly occupied 
Jerusalem. 
  The paper believes that it is high time the world community, 
which has long been deceived by Zionism, realized that the 
statements and pronouncements made by Israeli officials from 
time to time on a peaceful settlement are totally different than 
their real schemes and practices on the ground. For, had Israel 
been seeking peace as it claims, it would not have pursued a 
policy of procrastination and prevarication over the past two 
and a half years; that is, since the inception of the peace 
talks. This shows that Israel is evading the requirements of 
peace acknowledged by the international community. 
  AL-BA'TH notes that the failure to make any progress in the 
peace talks, which were suspended in the aftermath of the Hebron 
massacre, was not caused by the Arabs, who, as is well known, 
have done a great deal to render the peace process a success. 
Rather, the failure to make progress in the peace talks is 
caused by the Israeli position, which is opposed to the 
implementation of the relevant resolutions of international 
legitimacy, which constitute the terms of reference of the peace 
process. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes by saying that the U.S. side must take 
into account the need to rehabilitate the peace process, and to 
reestablish it on the terms of reference agreed upon -- the 
terms which formed the bases for the convening of the Madrid 
conference. The entire world community, the paper adds, welcomed 
the convocation of the Madrid conference, and regarded it as a 
unique opportunity for the achievement of just and comprehensive 
peace in accordance with the relevant resolutions of 
international legitimacy and the principle of trading land for 
peace. 
  For its part, the newspaper TISHRIN addresses the 
statements Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has made to 
express his willingness to dismantle settlements on the Golan, 
and reiterate that he would avoid complete withdrawal from the 
Golan. The paper says: These statements show that Rabin is 
sidestepping the crux of the peace process; indeed, crux of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict. For, settlements have never been the 
bone of contention between the Arabs and Israelis. Rather, it 
was the occupation of Arab territories that has always been the 
bone of contention between the two communities. 
  The paper adds: When he expressed a willingness to dismantle 
settlements, which were a product of the occupation, Rabin 
attempted to throw dust in our eyes. This is because, at the 
same time, he also underscored his determination to avoid 
complete withdrawal from the Golan, although Rabin, along with 
all Israeli officials, are well aware of Syria's position in 
this regard. Syria's peace stand is rooted in the need for 
complete withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories; namely, 
the Golan, the West Bank, Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, and 
southern Lebanon. 
  TISHRIN goes on to say: Rabin, who is engaged in a fresh 
maneuver with regard to the Golan, deliberately seeks to make 
the peace talks, if they are resumed, revolve in a vicious 
circle, or to render them void of any meaningful content. 
Moreover, Rabin's statements regarding the avoidance of 
complete withdrawal from the Golan are part of a new maneuver 
that Israel is attempting to cover up by declaring a willingness 
to dismantle settlements. These statements also betray a 
flagrant Israeli circumvention of the components of durable and 
viable peace. 
  TISHRIN concludes by saying: These Israeli proposals are 
only aimed at perpetuating the occupation. For, had it been 
serious about the efforts to achieve peace, Israel would not 
have hesitated to subscribe to the requirements of the peace 
process, chief among which are complete withdrawal from the 
occupied territories and the implementation of the relevant 
international legitimacy resolutions, which provide for the 
inadmissibility of the acquisition of others' territories by 
force and call for Israeli troop withdrawals from all occupied 
Arab territories to achieve just and comprehensive peace. 
  The newspaper AL-THAWRAH comments on the same issue, saying: 
On the eve of his upcoming tour of the region, Christopher 
announced that he is not carrying any new ideas or proposals. 
Nonetheless, he has made public his optimism over the possible 
achievement of positive results to help resume and reactivate 
the bilateral negotiations. 
  The paper adds: It is hoped that this optimism is 
well-grounded, and that it will produce tangible developments to 
allow for the resumption of the negotiations, for progress in 
the peace talks, and for the promotion of the peace process. 
The attainment of all this would allow this process to achieve 
its final objective; that is, a just and comprehensive peace 
that upholds the principles of right and justice and nullifies 
all forms of injustice, occupation, and aggression. 
  The paper goes on to say: Eleven rounds of negotiations have 
been held since the convening of the Madrid conference. During 
all these rounds, the Arabs ran into Israeli intransigence and 
determination to conclude partial solutions and separate deals, 
which cannot achieve peace or bring about stability. As a 
matter of fact, such solutions and deals can only consecrate 
injustice, domination, and occupation. 
  The paper says: For now, we cannot see any indication of a 
change in the Israeli position. Likewise, we have not seen any 
positive attitude on the part of the Rabin government indicative 
of an abandonment of its old approaches and concepts, or of an 
acceptance of the principle of complete and full withdrawal; and 
this cannot help achieve peace. 
  Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: The Arabs, 
headed 
by Syria, have not given up hope over the possible emergence of 
a fair and honest U.S. position that would vindicate the values 
of right and justice and show impartiality toward the regional 
conflict. All that we want is to see the United States 
demonstrate fairness and honesty, and play the role of a full 
partner with all honesty and impartiality.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Commenting on U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's tour of the region, TISHRIN says: The U.S. 
secretary of state is scheduled to begin a Middle East tour to 
advance the peace process. No two observers would disagree that 
the peace process has stumbled and that chances of peace are 
gradually narrowing as a result of Israel's intransigence and 
the fact that the U.S. role has been confined to wishes rather 
than using Washington's huge capabilities to force Israel to 
implement Security Council resolutions and withdraw from the 
occupied Arab territories. 
  TISHRIN adds: By virtue of its great responsibilities as a 
major and leading party to the peace process, Syria has made 
every possible effort to make concrete progress. It has also 
contributed actively to saving this process from collapse more 
than once on account of Israel's reckless conduct and practices, 
which are far from the spirit of peace. Syria expected the 
round of talks held following the Geneva summit to yield 
substantive results to achieve a just and comprehensive peace. 
The results of the talks, however, clashed with the same 
Israeli intransigence and the Israeli negotiating team's refusal 
to discuss the question of withdrawal from the occupied Syrian 
Golan. 
  The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre then came to shed light on the 
crimes of the settlers and the risks inherent in the continued 
presence of settlements in the occupied territories. The 
massacre also placed the international community before its 
responsibilities toward the removal of Israeli occupation. 
  As Christopher was preparing to come to the region, the 
rulers of Israel, as usual, released a spurt of statements 
ostensibly stressing efforts to achieve peace, while the 
substance of these statements points to obstructing just peace, 
reshuffling cards, complicating the situation, and confusing 
responsibilities. Syria and the other Arab parties to the 
Washington talks have a simple, clear demand that is in perfect 
harmony with UN resolutions, the principles of international 
law, and the foundations of the Madrid conference. 
  TISHRIN adds: Since the launching of the U.S. peace 
initiative, Syria has made it clear that it will not relinquish 
an iota of its national soil nor any national or pan-Arab right; 
that there can be no compromise on the Golan; and that there is 
no alternative to the return of the Golan in full to its 
motherland and the return of the Syrians who were displaced to 
their homeland. In return, and for over two years, Syria has 
not heard anything from the rulers of Israel except vague hints 
and has only seen evasion of withdrawal. 
  The paper concludes: The U.S. secretary of state's tour will 
be fruitful inasmuch as it places the rulers of Israel before 
the facts of a just and comprehensive solution and employs the 
U.S. weight to establish a just and comprehensive solution. The 
peace process has been going on for far too long and it faces 
the threat of collapse if the Arabs do not see tangible results 
toward regaining all of their occupied territories and usurped 
rights. 
  AL-BA'TH devotes its editorial to the contradiction in 
Rabin's statements. Perhaps, the paper said, the head of the 
Israeli government thought, through the statements he made on 
the eve of Christopher's visit to the region, that he had scored 
a great success in the peace process or that he had fulfilled 
all his obligations, so he left for Moscow having on top of his 
agenda bringing in more Jewish emigrants to settle them in the 
occupied Arab territories. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: If we pause for a second to consider what 
Rabin said about the dismantling of the settlements on the 
occupied Golan, we see that the words he used hide concepts that 
do not serve the peace process in any way. Thus, we quickly 
come to the conclusion that Rabin was only playing on words and 
resorting, as usual, to maneuvers and deception. 
  AL-BA'TH goes on: Rabin chose to make his statements only 
hours before Christopher's tour of the region to sound as if he 
were making concessions on the peace process. He has, however, 
as usual, ignored the fact that what he termed concessions is 
something that contradicts reason and international charters 
because anyone who makes a concession should own whatever it is 
in the first place. Since Israel does not own an inch of the 
territory, it cannot claim to be conceding it. 
  The paper asserts that the question of settlement activity 
has been an obstacle to the peace process in the same way the 
absence of a clear, unequivocal commitment to withdrawal from 
the occupied territories is an obstacle to this process. 
Therefore, we can conclude that Rabin, who spoke at great 
length about the Golan without announcing full withdrawal from 
it, has once again sought to circumvent the aim of Christopher's 
tour by making deceptive, propagandistic statements that do not 
at all change the Israeli position, which still rejects the 
peace process. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes: Hence, the U.S. secretary, who said he 
was not optimistic about his current tour, will meet an adamant 
Israeli position. To break this position, emphasis must be 
placed on the requirements of the peace process and rectifying 
its course through Rabin's commitment to full withdrawal from 
the Golan and consequently translating what he said into action 
on the ground if he truly wants peace.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Major General Amnon Shahaq, head </F>
of the Israeli delegation to the Cairo talks, by Mikha Friedman 
and Ge'ula Even on 22 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Friedman] Earlier this morning, we spoke with Major 
General Amnon Shahaq, deputy chief of staff and head of the 
Israeli delegation to the Cairo talks. In our first question, 
we asked Shahaq to comment on Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' 
assertion in Bucharest that when he and PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat perused the understandings reached in Cairo, they also 
discovered many points of disagreement. 
  [Shahaq] I assume that at least our foreign minister 
discovered nothing new in Bucharest, seeing as we had met before 
his departure and Mr. Peres was briefed in advance on all the 
points discussed in the negotiations and what we had agreed or 
disagreed upon. I can tell you what is happening in Cairo, 
however, and I will also take a moment to comment on the 
committees. These committees were not established to sit in 
Cairo; they have nothing to do in Cairo. These three committees 
were not established on a temporary basis. They are all 
permanent committees which must operate from Gaza and have 
nothing to do with the entrance of any party to the area but 
rather must deal with working procedures inside Gaza, as well as 
coordination and cooperation between those who will enter Gaza 
and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops that will remain 
there. 
  [Friedman] I take this to mean that the committees will be 
responsible for translating the understandings in principle 
reached in the negotiations into practical developments in the 
field? 
  [Shahaq] Not only that. The committees will also be 
responsible for preventing friction and facilitating the best 
level of coexistence possible in the field on the basis of the 
agreements reached in Cairo. 
  [Even] Are they supposed to operate until the final signing 
of the agreement or until the Palestinian authorities enter the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho? 
  [Shahaq] These committees are part of the understandings 
reached in Cairo. The establishment of these committees was 
agreed upon in Cairo, and their job mainly begins from the 
moment the Palestinians assume authority. Clearly, the 
committees will be incapable of operating effectively from the 
first day if they are not situated in the area prior to the 
transfer of authority in order to familiarize themselves with 
the area, with us, and with the joint understandings that were 
reached. We will have to work together for a few days before 
the Palestinian authority can assume its responsibilities so 
that the joint committees, which also feature Israeli 
representatives, will have the opportunity to learn how to work 
together and cope with problems in the field. 
  [Friedman] Major General Shahaq, can you give us any new 
target date this morning for the signing of the agreement 
between Israel and the PLO? Perhaps 5 May, as surmised by an 
Israeli television correspondent last night? 
  [Shahaq] I never had any target dates. According to the 
Oslo agreement, there were certain target dates that we intended 
to meet but failed. Today, I would rather not mention any 
dates, because I simply do not know. If we had a date, I would 
not keep it a secret. There is still work to do. I think that 
the issues we still have to overcome are neither irresolvable 
nor numerous. Therefore, barring the emergence of new obstacles 
or the reopening of issues that we consider closed, and if 
everything continues the way things went this week -- and I see 
no reason for this not to be the case -- the negotiations can be 
concluded in not too long a period. 
  [Even] While you were negotiating with the Palestinians in 
Cairo, the families of the Israeli POW's and MIA's demonstrated 
and waged a hunger strike. They are demanding a linkage between 
information on the fate of their children and their release and 
the release of Palestinian security prisoners held by Israel. 
Do you accept such a linkage between the two issues? 
  [Shahaq] I agree that everything must be done on every 
possible level to resolve the very painful issue of the POW's 
and MIA's. 
  [Friedman] Does Yasir 'Arafat have information on the POW's 
and MIA's that he is not giving us for some reason? 
  [Shahaq] I cannot say if he has any information. I can 
safely assume that Palestinian elements have easier access to 
such information, and I believe they must do everything in their 
power to not only get this information but also relay it to us. 
They must do everything they can to resolve this crucial 
problem. I consider it their obligation under the current 
circumstances. 
  [Friedman] Maj. Gen. Shahaq, Israel continues to reject the 
Palestinian demand to release Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] prisoners as part of the mass prisoner releases 
expected within the framework of the agreement. At the same 
time, Israel conducted mass arrests of hundreds of Hamas 
activists this week, mainly in the Gaza Strip. What is the 
point of these arrests if Israel is pulling out of the area 
completely in several weeks? 
  [Shahaq] One can also ask why Hamas is continuing terrorist 
attacks. Israel will continue to fight Hamas as long as it 
perpetrates terrorism. I believe that a soldier's body was 
discovered only yesterday, after being murdered, to the best of 
my knowledge, by Hamas operatives. Israel is at war with Hamas, 
and this war will continue for as long as necessary. 
  [Even] Did your interlocutors in Cairo read the assessments 
prepared by the director of the Shin Bet according to which the 
Palestinians will start massacring each other as soon as the IDF 
pulls out of Gaza? 
  [Shahaq] I did not hear these assessments. I read about 
them in the newspapers, and I am not sure they are correct. 
  [Friedman] One more question about Israel's agreement with 
the PLO: What is the gap between the signing of the agreement 
in Cairo and the completion of the IDF's withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho? 
  [Shahaq] The interim period between the signing of the 
agreement and the transfer of authority to the Palestinians will 
take three weeks. 
  [Friedman] Thank you very much, Maj. Gen. Shahaq.

  [Excerpts] Dr. Nabil Sha'th and General Amnon Shahaq, the 
heads of the Palestinian and Israeli negotiating delegations, 
have both agreed that progress has been made in the round of 
talks which was concluded in Cairo yesterday. Dr. Sha'th said 
that this round has achieved considerable progress despite the 
difficulty it faced in the beginning. Meanwhile Shahaq said 
that the round was positive and fruitful and that the two sides 
were very close to signing an agreement on the implementation of 
self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
  At their news conferences, they said that the new round 
which 
is to start next Sunday will be that last. While Nabil Sha'th 
expects a final agreement to be signed between 2 and 5 May by 
the Palestinian president, brother Abu Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], 
and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, General Shahaq was 
more reserved and did not give a date for the signing. [passage 
omitted] 
  Shahaq said that the two sides are awaiting the results of 
the meetings of the economic committee in Paris to include them 
in the resolutions which have been finalized in order to reach a 
general agreement. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile the heads of the Palestinian and Israeli 
delegations to the economic talks in Paris have decided to hold 
consultations with their presidents because of the obstacles 
which they cannot overcome through negotiations. Sources in the 
two delegations said that Avraham Shohat, Israeli finance 
minister and head of the Israeli delegation to the economic 
talks, has indeed left Paris this morning for Israel. The 
official spokesman of the Israeli delegation, Eric Gordan, said 
that Shohat will attend next Sunday's Israeli cabinet meeting. 
  Meanwhile, Samir Hulaylah, member of the Israeli delegation, 
said that brother Abu-al-'Ala', director of the PLO's Economic 
Department, will also leave Paris for Tunis where he is to brief 
the PLO leadership on the progress of the economic talks. 
  Shohat and Abu-al-'Ala' are expected to return to Paris on 
Monday afternoon. 
  The two delegations could not reach an agreement on customs 
policy and on matters regarding Palestinian manpower.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 23 Apr (MENA) -- Informed Palestinian 
sources in Cairo expect a tripartite meeting to be held in Cairo 
on 28 April with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, and U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher to agree on a date to implement the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement and eliminate the obstacles hindering 
Palestinian-Israeli talks. 
  The sources told MENA that if the remaining points of 
difference are resolved during the coming round of talks that 
will begin in Cairo tomorrow, Wednesday [as received], a summit 
meeting is expected to be held between 'Arafat and Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo on 2 May. That summit will 
discuss an agreement on the area of Jericho, which was left to 
the two leaders, and the issuance of passports for Palestinians 
in Gaza and Jericho. 
  According to the same sources, the final signing of the 
agreement will be held under the sponsorship of President Husni 
Mubarak on 4 May. The signing will be attended by U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev, and a representative of the Government of Norway 
which sponsored the secret negotiations, in addition to 
representatives from donor states. 
  Peres is expected to arrive in Cairo on Tuesday evening to 
follow up the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations closely, together 
with PLO Executive Committee.

  [Text] Cairo, 24 Apr (MENA) -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the Gaza-Jericho talks, has affirmed 
that the Palestinian side is ready during the current round of 
negotiations to reach an agreement on the outstanding points 
concerning the Gaza-Jericho agreement. He added that agreement 
would depend on whether the Israeli side intends to finalize the 
remaining issues this week. 
  Speaking to reporters today before the start of the 
Palestinian-Israeli round of talks, Sha'th noted that a date for 
signing the documents on implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
cannot be set before we find out what the Israeli delegation is 
bringing with it and whether or not it is really ready to 
finalize the outstanding issues. Sha'th pointed out that among 
the issues still under discussion by the Palestinian and Israeli 
sides are security-related issues such as the legal jurisdiction 
over Gaza and Jericho, and he noted that the two sides had 
previously reached a verbal agreement on this matter. He added: 
We are waiting to see the draft the Israeli delegation is 
bringing regarding this issue. Sha'th pointed out that there 
are some paragraphs in the "general agreement" that need to be 
revised, and the same applies to the question of the release of 
the Palestinian detainees from Israeli prisons. 
  Sha'th noted that should the Palestinian and Israeli sides 
reach an agreement during this week's talks, the date for 
signing the agreement on implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
will be announced next week. He stressed that all this is 
contingent on the intentions of the Israeli side. He referred 
in this regard to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's remarks 
in which he said that the agreement would be signed on 15 May. 
  Sha'th added that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat will 
meet with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Cairo at 
the end of this week. He noted that 'Arafat's meeting with 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres is not confirmed. 
  Sha'th stressed that no one can pressure the Palestinian 
side 
into giving up its rights, even if this means another year of 
negotiations. He added: If the Israeli side is ready to sign 
an agreement next week, the Palestinians are ready too. He 
added: The Israelis must not believe that we are prepared to 
abandon our rights to meet a specific deadline. 
  On the recent agreement between Fatah and Hamas, Sha'th said 
it will open the door for national unity so that a Palestinian 
national authority can be established on Palestinian territory 
and an inter-Palestinian peace can be achieved. 
  Concerning the number of Palestinian detainees to be 
released 
by Israel, Sha'th said that this will be discussed with the 
Israeli delegation in today's meetings.

  [Text] Cairo, 24 Apr (MENA) -- Palestinian-Israeli talks to 
implement the agreement on self-rule in Gaza and Jericho resumed 
in Cairo this afternoon. The talks are chaired by Dr. Nabil 
Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian president Yasir 
'Arafat, and General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of 
staff. The talks were scheduled to begin this morning but were 
delayed several hours because the Israeli delegation arrived in 
Cairo late. 
  Informed Palestinian sources told MENA that the current 
round 
takes on special importance because it will be the last round if 
the two sides agree on the outstanding issues. The sources said 
the most important issues that will be discussed in the context 
of the Security and Legal Affairs Committee is the legal 
jurisdiction in Gaza and Jericho and the release of Palestinian 
detainees in Israeli jails, estimated at approximately 10,000 
according to International Red Cross statistics.

  [Text] The PLO-Israel economic talks have seen some delay. 
They realized progress in tourism but have hit snags on the 
customs and labor force issues. The heads of the two 
delegations left for Tunis and Israel to consult with 'Arafat 
and Rabin respectively and will be back in Paris on 25 April. 
We have asked Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], the head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the Paris talks and who is also the 
head of the PLO Economic Department, about the achievements of 
the talks this week. He said: 
  [Begin recording] [Quray'] In this round we realized 
progress 
in tourism. A paper has been agreed on. We have no big 
problems in this matter. The difficult problem which is still 
unsolved concerns imports and related policies, trade and its 
effect on the overall economic policy. We have agreed on a 
principle which I consider to be important and a gain, namely, 
that there must be an imports policy, a Palestinian customs 
policy regarding a number of commodities that are basic and 
important for development and for the living conditions of the 
Palestinian people in the occupied territory, in terms of 
pricing, customs tariff, permitting imports, and other things, 
with the Arab countries and the world. However, we have hit a 
snag on defining these commodities with Israel. This has been 
and still is a problem. We hope they will reconsider their 
position on it next week. 
  The other topic is the currency and banknotes. Here also the 
talks stopped at a previous problem, namely, the Palestinian 
currency and the Shekel, will it be a legal tender [previous two 
words in English] or a usable currency ['umlat tadawul]. We 
insist on the term usable currency. I can say that these are 
the difficult basic points in these negotiations. When we come 
back we will talk about the other issues. 
  [Correspondent] During this round, you also discussed the 
issue of the Palestinian labor force. What have you achieved in 
this regard? 
  [Quray'] Concerning this point, we raised the issue of the 
suffering and pain of our workers because of the closure of the 
territories and the Palestinian worker's inability to go to 
work, whether in the occupied territory or in Israel, and the 
serious reflections of this situation on the overall peace 
process. We presented this in the previous round and we have 
repeated this in this round and they showed some flexibility in 
this regard. They allowed 5,000 workers to return to work. A 
budget for employment has been allocated for Gaza and the West 
Bank, about $10 million. 
  The fact is that this is just some sort of a sedative, it 
does not solve the problem. Either the employment process is 
organized or new job opportunities for the Palestinian worker 
are created within the national economy. Such a creation is our 
ambition, but it is a very difficult process and will not be 
realized by mere wishful thinking. It needs construction, 
projects, infrastructure, and other things. I am not going to 
discuss economic science here. The feasible issue is for this 
process to be organized with Israel. This is what we are 
considering in the negotiations. It has not been decided yet.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ahmad Quray', PLO's Economic </F>
Department head, in Paris, by Sa'id Mu'addi in the studio; date 
not given; from the "With the Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] In contrast to the headway the political 
talks in Cairo are making, the economic talks in Paris seem to 
be slowing up. Are the differences substantive and of the kind 
that may preclude a final agreement? 
  [Quray'] Slowing up may be too strong a word and would 
suggest there is deliberate foot dragging, which is not the 
case. We are striving to hammer out an agreement. However, 
there are key issues that must be thrashed out. Take, for 
instance, the value added tax, which should not, under any 
circumstances, be as high as that levied in Israel. We 
proposed, and Israel rejected, a compromise of 15 percent. 
There is also the question of the tax deducted from Arab 
workers, which, incidentally, I don't think is an insurmountable 
hurdle, since there seems to be an inclination to reimburse the 
Palestinian authority. There is the more weighty issue of 
import policies. Israel wants to keep the same customs policies 
that are in force now under the occupation regime. We are 
interested in istituting cooperation with Israel, but without 
the continued Israeli domination of the Palestinian economy. 
The Palestinians must enjoy free and independent 
decisionmaking. In this area, we proposed a reasonable formula 
which they have rejected. We drew up a list of goods the 
Palestinian authority would import from the Arab markets, but we 
have not been able to work out an agreement. For us, this is an 
important issue, since we are a part of the Arab world. Our 
strategic heartland is Arab, and so we cannot have a one-way 
relationship with the Arabs, exporting to them without importing 
from them. That was a particularly delicate issue. 
  [Mu'addi] How is it that economic issues are posing a hurdle 
to an agreement, after the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have 
come that far? 
  [Quray'] Important as the other negotiations are, I think 
that, outside the security concerns, economic issues are the 
most important. Security and economics are the mainstay of the 
interim period. If we have kept the media at bay and failed to 
report on our economic talks on a daily basis, this has not been 
to belittle them. I regard the economic talks the more 
important of the two sets of negotiations. We are not talking 
here just about Gaza and Jericho; the talks are about the entire 
interim stage covering the areas of industry, agriculture, 
tourism, finance, and banking. Taken as a whole, these issues 
are highly important and must receive the attention they merit. 
  [Mu'addi] Back to the Cairo talks, is 4 May a definite date 
for signing the Israeli-Palestinian agreement? 
  [Quray'] I cannot be so specific. I think, though, early 
May should see the Declaration of Principles put in place. The 
two sides are determined that this happen. 
  [Mu'addi] Thank you. 
  [Quray'] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ahmad Quray', PLO's Economic Department </F>
head, by unidentified correspondent in Paris; date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] At the end of last week's round of 
economic talks you sounded upbeat. You said the Paris talks 
have progressed. Are you still in the same optimistic mood? 
  [Quray'] Despite the crisis that arose during this round, I 
cannot but be optimistic as I fulfill such a difficult and 
arduous role in the negotiations. The moment I cease to be 
optimistic, I must withdraw from the talks. By their nature, 
negotiations -- in particular, the economic talks -- are 
difficult and arduous. We are dealing with an adversary bent on 
remaining in a dominant position. Then you have the Palestinian 
side striving to get results. The question of optimism or 
pessimism, for me, does not arise. In this round in particular, 
progress was made in the area of tourism, where agreement was 
reached on a paper. There is not much of a problem there for 
us. The tough problem that remains is the question of imports 
and trade and their economic implications. This, despite our 
having agreed on a principle, which I consider to be important 
and a gain; namely, the need for there to be an importation 
policy and a customs tariff policy regulating a number of key 
goods central to development and everyday life of the 
Palestinian people in the occupied territories, in terms of 
pricing, tariffs, import licenses for commercial exchange with 
Arab and other states. We could not agree on what these goods 
will be. We hope the Israelis will rethink their position when 
we meet next week. Another contentious issue was the bank 
notes. The talks bogged down over the Palestinian currency and 
the Israeli shekel -- whether the latter would be legal tender 
or a currency. We insist on it being a currency. These were 
the sticking points. 
  [Correspondent] This round also addressed Palestinian 
manpower. How much progress was made there? 
  [Quray'] We raised the issue from the angle of the hardships 
our workers are suffering due to the closure that has barred the 
Palestinian workers from Israel. That applies as much to the 
laborers who work in the occupied territories as it does to 
those who commute to Israel. We underscored the dangerous 
implications of these measures for the entire peace process. 
They said there will be flexibility on this matter, noting that 
some 5,000 Palestinian workers have been allowed back to their 
jobs and that $10 million worth of funds have been set aside to 
alleviate unemployment in Gaza and the West Bank. But that will 
not solve the problem. The Palestinian workers must be engaged 
in steady employment and job opportunities must be created for 
them in the context of the national Palestinian economy. To 
create jobs in the context of a national Palestinian national 
economy is an ambitious and difficult task that will not 
materialize by wishing it. It takes preparations and the 
building of an infrastructure. 
  [Correspondent] Many Palestinians and some Palestinian 
factions fear that Israel will dominate the Palestinian economy 
after the establishment of self-rule. What do you have to say 
about that fear? 
  [Quray'] Let me say that such a fear is legitimate but does 
not have to be our fate at all, and that Israel may desire such 
a dominance but Israel's desires also do not have to be our 
fate. Therefore, I can say that these economic talks are the 
most important of all the Palestinian-Israeli talks because they 
lay the groundwork for the work of our institutions during the 
transitional stage. Can these institutions achieve a total 
Palestinian economic independence through the Palestinian rights 
they will regain? This is the question. Therefore, I can 
reassure those who voice their concern, which is legitimate, as 
I have said, that our negotiating strategy, if realized, will 
pave the way for economic independence. Let me give an example: 
It is known that during its early days, the occupation 
completely paralyzed the economic movement by closing banks, 
which constitute the lifeline of the Palestinian economy. All 
these banks were replaced by Israeli banks. All Palestinian, 
Arab, Jordanian, or foreign banks were closed. This took place 
in the early days of the 1967 occupation, and Israeli 
institutions replaced them. This is the situation. Therefore, 
the Palestinian negotiator should achieve his strategy by taking 
a first step toward regaining the right to license, monitor, and 
run the banks in accordance with Palestinian economic plan and 
structure. I can assert and proudly say that we have regained 
our right to build a Palestinian monetary and financial 
institution, which has the right to license, monitor, and run 
the banks and issue instructions and legislations regarding 
banking activity in the occupied Palestinian territories. This 
issue is not an easy one. The second issue, frankly speaking, 
is part of our policy and our strategy. It is aimed at 
penetrating the customs wall that has been built around the 
occupied territories since the early days of the occupation, 
represented by the customs policy, exports, and trade exchange 
policy. I also can say that we will not regain our full rights. 
However, we have penetrated that customs wall by securing the 
Palestinian right to import from Arab countries. It is we who 
should define the customs tariff with the Arabs and it is we who 
should define the policies and the specifications, make 
assessments and analysis, and conduct all activity pertaining to 
imports from the Arabs. Thus, this is a penetration in the 
customs wall. The other issue is with the Arab and Islamic 
countries. Israel, as well as other countries, usually imports 
from countries maintaining relations with it. Therefore, the 
penetration took place when we clarified that the occupied 
territories are a Palestinian identity and entity and not part 
of Israel. So, it is we who define the policy of the 
disengagement process. What is important in our strategy is 
that through these negotiations, we should achieve disengagement 
with the Israeli economy, which dominates the Palestinian 
economy. How can we penetrate the customs, gradually achieve 
disengagement, and build new rules for relations based on 
cooperation. There is a very important point, which can only be 
understood by the Palestinian farmer; namely, the principle of 
reciprocity in agricultural exports. It has been previously 
known that the Palestinian market was dominated by the Israeli 
agricultural products, while the Palestinians were not allowed 
to export any of their vegetables or fruits to the Israeli 
market. The new agricultural agreement stipulates the 
Palestinian right to export to the Israeli market. Thousands of 
tonnes of vegetables and fruits are destroyed every year because 
they cannot be marketed. The same also applies to industry. We 
also have the right to reciprocity and to license the industry 
that serves and promotes our economy. 
  [Correspondent] Will there be direct economic ties between 
the Palestinian entity and the outside, meaning Arab countries 
such as Jordan and other countries, without passing through 
Israel, given that the balance of economic and political power 
is in Israel's favor? Does the Palestinian economy enjoy 
freedom and guarantees? 
  [Quray'] Yes. Very lengthy negotiations were held over this 
issue. The Israelis' logic was that the occupied territories 
are still within the framework of the transitional period. That 
is, these occupied territories are not a state and, hence, they 
should be under Israeli control. 
  We categorically rejected this logic. In the end, we reached 
the conclusion that since our relations with the Arabs represent 
our strategic depth, then we should be allowed to define our 
relations with the Arabs and build economic relations with Arab 
countries in all fields according to our own will. This is the 
conclusion we reached. That is not all. The Israelis refused 
that we establish relations even with Islamic countries. We 
also reached agreement on this. Hence, we have the right to 
establish economic relations with whomever we want. However, I 
must be clear. There will still be some limitations on 
everything we want. Phased negotiations and a good and 
efficient institution will eventually lead to the restoration of 
all our rights. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you Abu-'Ala' [Quray'].

  [Text] Jordan will implement significant steps against 
Hamas members on its territory only if Hamas carries out another 
murderous attack in Israel. 
  This has transpired at the end of the talks between Israel 
and Jordan. During the talks, Israel demanded that King Husayn 
immediately put a halt to Hamas activity in Jordan. The 
Jordanian representatives, however, claimed that if they carry 
out the desired steps in the next few days, this would be 
construed as Israeli and U.S. intervention in Jordanian affairs. 
Consequently, they announced that such steps will be 
implemented only once there is sufficient cause -- for example, 
after another attack is carried out in Israel. 
  Israeli sources said that Israel had no choice but to accept 
the Jordanian condition. At the same time, Israel was told that 
Jordan will gradually implement more long-term steps against 
Hamas.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpts] Senior political elements in Jerusalem 
anticipated yesterday that the meeting between U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher and Jordan's King Husayn in London next 
week will result in a formula that will resolve the 
Jordanian-U.S. crisis created by the naval blockade on the port 
of al-'Aqabah. The elements believe that Jordan will attend the 
Washington peace talks, which are due to resume in the coming 
weeks. 
  This week, Israel and Jordan held daily contacts on various 
tracks. Elyaqim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation to 
the talks with Jordan, had several telephone conversations with 
his counterpart Fayiz al-Tarawinah, the chief Jordanian delegate. 
  In these meetings, Israel sought to learn about the 
Jordanian 
stand on the naval blockade issue and to gauge the seriousness 
of Jordan's threat to suspend the peace talks if its 
disagreement with the United States is not resolved. 
  For their part, the Jordanians evinced great interest in the 
progress of the Israeli-PLO economic talks in Paris. They asked 
Israel to consider Jordan's positions in various spheres 
pertaining to the future economic ties between the Palestinian 
autonomy and Jordan. [passage omitted] 
  On another track, a periodic meeting on current problems was 
held at the beginning of this week between Israeli and Jordanian 
elements. One of the issues on the agenda was the infiltration 
of opponents of the Iraqi regime into Israel through Jordanian 
territory. 
  The track of direct, working-level encounters, which was 
established many years ago, gathered substantial momentum after 
the Israel-Jordan peace talks were launched. At present, they 
are incorporated in the political talks. 
  Within this framework, a senior Israeli element met with his 
Jordanian counterpart in Washington several weeks ago. The two 
exchanged views and assessments on the Middle East situation. 
  Jordan is more prepared than the other peace process 
participants to introduce confidence-building measures vis-a-vis 
Israel and to maintain ties with it on several tracks.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Ali al-Salih and Ilyas Nasrallah: "AL-SHARQ </F>
AL-AWSAT Asks About Fate of Palestinian Madrid Delegation"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- A well-informed Palestinian source in 
the occupied territories has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Dr. 
Sa'ib 'Urayqat, present head of the Palestinian delegation to 
the Washington peace negotiations, suspended since the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron, failed to persuade any 
member of the Palestinian delegation that participated in the 
Washington negotiations before the Oslo agreement to join him in 
the latest rounds of negotiations, held in a secret location in 
the U.S. capital in January and February. 
  The source said that most members of the delegation, which 
was headed by Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, differ in practice with 
the present PLO position on the negotiations, and are openly 
opposed to the declaration of principles agreement reached 
following the secret negotiations in the Norwegian capital, 
Oslo, away from the Washington negotiations and without the 
negotiators' knowledge. 
  This position has been confirmed in an exclusive statement 
to 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT by Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi himself. He said: 
"Actually I believe that the task of the declaration of 
principles agreement reached in Oslo ended the responsibility of 
the negotiating delegation in Washington. Yes, the delegation's 
mission ended the moment the Oslo agreement was signed, as our 
first task was to negotiate the transitional phase." 
  'Abd-al-Shafi went on: "I did not participate in the Oslo 
negotiations, nor was I consulted on the Oslo agreement. I 
personally criticized the agreement and believe it is bad. 
Because it did not tackle Israel's claims regarding the 
occupied territories, on the basis of which Israel built the 
settlements. The outcome of the failure to tackle this issue is 
clear in the current negotiations in Cairo. The current 
situation is worrying. And as long as the settlement building 
process is continuing, the possibility of achieving a just peace 
is out of the question." [passage omitted] 
  Asked about his position -- as a former delegate -- on the 
current negotiations in Cairo between the PLO and Israel and the 
agreements they have achieved, Ghassan al-Khatib said: First of 
all, we are not informed officially -- neither as a delegation 
nor as political forces -- of what is happening in Cairo. 
However, I believe that Israel is retrieving in Cairo what it 
offered in Oslo. What is happening there is a victory for the 
Israeli methods which they tried to impose in Washington but 
failed, such as fragmenting the topics under negotiation into 
parts isolated from one another. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Khatib warned that "if the Cairo agreement is 
implemented, 
it contains very dangerous time bombs. This is because of the 
agreement to keep thousands of armed and aggressive settlers, 
allowing them to move freely in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho 
area. This is in addition to the presence of thousands of 
Palestinian policemen, who will be in an unenviable position in 
the event of any attack on Palestinian by a settler. Because it 
will be difficult for them to take a neutral position, and it 
will also be difficult for them to punish the settlers. Hence 
the danger of another Bosnia in the Gaza Strip." 
  Answering the same questions, Dr. [Hanan] 'Ashrawi said over 
the telephone from her home in Ramallah: "There is no longer a 
thing called the delegation to the Washington negotiations, 
because the negotiations are now direct between the PLO and 
Israel." [passage omitted] 
  On the way the negotiations are run at present, 'Ashrawi 
said: "There is Israeli diktat in the negotiations. In my view, 
the peace process is consolidating Israeli terms and priorities, 
including the method of separating the people from the land, the 
employment method instead of geographical jurisdiction, and the 
continued political blackmail. In brief, the peace process has 
lost the foundation on which it was launched." 
  'Ashrawi stressed that she is in favor of correcting the 
course of the process and intervening in a manner that prevents 
sliding into discussing the fine details while ignoring the 
essence. She said that the "form has become more important than 
the substance." She urged reexamining the entire process and the 
way it is run. 
  'Ashrawi attributed the deterioration to world pressures and 
internal Palestinian political considerations, the political 
contradictions produced by the peace process at the Palestinian 
public opinion level, and political orientations in the PLO.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Amr Nasif from Cairo] </F>
  [Excerpt] A major difference of opinion between Egypt and 
Saudi Arabia over the Yemeni crisis has hurt relations between 
Riyadh and Cairo, which an informed Egyptian source has 
described as becoming serious. 
  According to the source, Saudi Arabia has always claimed 
that 
its unique relations with Yemen make it necessary that all 
attempts to find a solution to the problem go through Riyadh. 
The source added that Egypt had remained patient since Saudi 
Arabia rejected any Egyptian intervention when the crisis broke 
out. Saudi Arabia claimed to be confident that the parties in 
Sanaa and Aden were capable of resolving their differences 
without outside intervention. 
  The source added that Egypt responded favorably at first but 
its patience ran out when the crisis became exacerbated in a way 
that, according to Egypt, threatened the region. It said that 
some Egyptian Foreign Ministry experts prepared a study on the 
possible deterioration of the situation in Yemen and came to the 
conclusion that leaving things as they were could make the 
situation worse and make some parties push to take the case to 
the United Nations, which would mean allowing a Western presence 
in Yemen in the name of international legitimacy, a development 
that Egypt regards as detrimental to Arab interests. 
  The source added that Egypt decided to intervene either 
unilaterally or in coordination with the United Arab Emirates 
[UAE], particularly as the evidence convinced it that some Arab 
parties are intent on exacerbating the situation in Yemen and 
impeding any efforts to resolve it. The source said: Egypt 
noticed that the Gulf Cooperation Council did not discuss the 
Yemeni crisis at its recent meeting in Riyadh. Egypt is 
strongly opposed to undermining Yemen and bringing down its 
regime because of its stance during the second Gulf war. 
  The source revealed that another issue, Iraq, has 
intensified 
the crisis between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is 
accusing Egypt of working covertly to improve the atmosphere 
between Baghdad and some Arab and Western capitals and says that 
the Arab League's reconciliation initiative is only a back door 
for returning Iraq to the Arab fold. It added that Saudi Arabia 
brought up this issue with Egypt several times and stressed that 
it adopt the Gulf stance, which is opposition to reconciliation 
with Iraq. 
  The source did not rule out a possible Egyptian move to 
raise 
the level of its diplomatic representation with Iraq as a means 
of pressure. The source expressed the hope that the cloud 
marring Egyptian-Saudi relations would disappear and stressed 
that Saudi Arabia and Egypt need each other. 
  On the other hand, Arab diplomatic circles are pessimistic 
about the prospects of Egyptian-UAE mediation between Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid. These circles expect this mediation to fail for several 
reasons, the most important of which is that the fundamental 
problem lies in the struggle for power and not in implementing 
the "Pledge and Agreement" document. They note that 
implementation of the document will neither strengthen the unity 
nor remove the specter of secession. They add that non-Yemeni 
parties have succeeded in planting fear within the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] and that this fear has been bolstered by 
financial aid that has exceeded $1 billion in cash and military 
aid. These parties, the Arab circles said, gave al-Bid forged 
reports saying that Salih rigged the elections in favor of his 
party so he could appear later as magnanimous when he offered 
the prime ministership, Defense Ministry, and some other 
noninfluential posts to the YSP so that any future legislative 
elections would appear to the people to be honest and objective 
if the lists of the winners or ministers appeared without any 
southern name. 
  The circles say that these non-Yemeni parties have stressed 
to the southern Yemenis that if Egypt's efforts to achieve an 
Arab reconciliation continue, it will only strengthen 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih's position, who in his capacity as president has 
the authority to sign any Yemeni reconciliation with Saudi 
Arabia and the Gulf. The non-Yemeni parties added that this 
would mean the immediate severance of communications between the 
Gulf and Aden and that the Gulf prefers to cooperate with the 
YSP, either through al-Bid's assumption of the presidency of the 
Republic or through the restoration of the south's independence. 
  An informed Arab source said that the Gulf parties that have 
direct ties with intelligence organs there handed al-Bid 
documents and lists of names that reveal that 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih's relatives assassinated some YSP members to pull the rug 
from under the feet of the leadership in the south. It added 
that these parties stressed to al-Bid that some of those who 
carried out these operations were half brothers of President 
Salih on his mother's side. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beirut, 23 Apr (MENA)--Lebanese judicial sources 
today stated that during the preliminary interrogation 
yesterday, Iraqi diplomat Deputy Consul 'Ali Sultan Darwish and 
chief of embassy guards Hadi Hasan confessed fully to the 
assassination of Iraqi opposition member Talib Suhayl al-Tamimi 
in his home in Beirut. 
  The sources said that during the 12-hour interrogation 
yesterday, Hadi Hasan gave a full confession on how the crime 
was planned in coordination with Muhammad Faris Kadhim, chief of 
intelligence at the Iraqi embassy, and defendants Khalid Khalaf, 
'Ali Sultan Darwish, and George Tarjian. 
  According to Hasan, Kadhim had asked him to assassinate 
al-Tamimi at the orders of the Iraqi intelligence in Baghdad, 
after furnishing him with the crime weapon. 
  The sources note that defendant 'Ali Sultan Darwish 
confessed 
to planning and preparing to carry out the crime with his 
colleagues and to hiding weapons, particularly the murder weapon. 
  Darwish said that the Iraqi intelligence in Baghdad had 
issued orders to assassinate al-Tamimi at once as an opponent of 
Saddam Husayn's regime. He confessed to committing the crime 
with his colleagues. 
  The investigating judge has ordered the extension of the 
defendants' remand in solitary confinement, and prevented 
visitors. The number of persons implicated in the case has thus 
risen to five, including three diplomats.

  [Text] Nicosia, 23 Apr (INA)--Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid al-Rafi'i, 
secretary of the Lebanon Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th 
Party and former member of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies, has 
condemned the Lebanese Government's decision to sever diplomatic 
ties with Iraq, describing it as a decision that is lacking in 
patriotic and pan-Arab sentiments, as well as any legal or 
legitimate grounds. 
  In statements carried by Arab and foreign media 
organizations 
in Nicosia, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid al-Rafi'i asserted that the 
Lebanese people cannot but be supportive of Iraq, which has 
strongly nurtured their struggle in the course of their defense 
of their national unity and promoted their steadfastness on 
their national soil to enable them to liberate it from the filth 
of the Zionist enemy. 
  Al-Rafi'i noted that the Lebanese Government's decision to 
sever ties with Iraq is part of a conspiratorial scenario 
targeting both Iraq and Lebanon. 
  Al-Rafi'i urged the nationalist and pan-Arab forces that are 
opposed to the subjugation of the Lebanese political 
decisionmaking process to close their ranks and overlook their 
differences to save Lebanon from the current state of loss and 
thwart the schemes that aim to eliminate its sovereignty. 
  Al-Rafi'i also condemned the campaign of arrests targeting 
nationalist and pan-Arab figures in Lebanon, which is coupled 
with another campaign aimed to muzzle intellectual freedom and 
heavily censor various Lebanese media organizations.

  [Text] Lebanese investigators are still questioning Samir 
Ja'ja', commander of the banned Lebanese Forces militia, about a 
church bombing and the murder of his Christian rival Dani 
Sham'un. Ja'ja''s supporters continue to demonstrate on his 
behalf, prompting the Lebanese Army to deploy more troops in 
east Beirut. 
  Army personnel detained Ja'ja' last night and took him to 
the 
Defense Ministry for questioning. Ja'ja' denied any involvement 
of the banned Lebanese Forces in the church bombing or Sham'un's 
killing. 
  According to Lebanese Defense Ministry sources, Ja'ja' is 
being held in one of the Ministry's offices. He was questioned 
today and is expected to remain in custody until 25 April at 
least. About 300 supporters of Ja'ja' demonstrated today. 
Others congregated in churches to express their loyalty to the 
41-year old militia commander. 
  Other members of the security apparatus of the banned 
Lebanese Forces have also been rounded up. One of them, Fawzi 
al-Rasi, died today of a heart attack while in custody.

  [Text] Following Sunday mass, Maronite Patriarch Sfayr 
received groups of citizens who went to the Maronite 
Patriarchate to consult with him over Lebanese Forces Commander 
Samir Ja'ja' being brought in for questioning. Earlier, they 
tried to break into the Patriarchate but the Army prevented 
them. After consultations with Patriarch Sfayr, they were 
divided into groups, each made up of approximately 60 persons, 
and invited for an audience with the patriarch. Patriarch Sfayr 
told them the following: 
  [Begin Sfayr recording] We know why you came to Bkirki 
today, 
the same reason as some others did the day before yesterday. 
This issue concerns all of us, in fact it concerns all people. 
In today's mass we have called upon all Lebanese, be they 
Muslims or Christians, to pray to God to give the officials, the 
investigators, and the judges the moral courage to reveal the 
truth about what has happened and is happening. We cannot but 
adopt this position. We must consolidate our trust in God first 
and in the Lebanese judiciary second until further notice. But 
we hope that the route through the Lebanese judiciary will be 
the way to reveal the truth and will help all those who want the 
truth reach that end. [applause] 
  I know what you want to tell me. We are doing all we can so 
that the truth can be revealed, for only the truth can save 
those who pursue it. Jesus Christ said: If you know the truth, 
it will free you. This is the position that all of you must 
adopt; that is, to pray to God so that the truth will come out, 
and then we will see what can be done. May God be with you, 
bless you and your children, and guide you to the right path. 
[applause] [end recording]

  [Text] Beirut, 23 Apr (MENA)--Investigations by Lebanese 
judicial and security authorities with 16 members of the 
Abu-Nidal-led Fatah Movement--the Revolutionary Council [FRC] 
arrested a few days ago have revealed that eight of them were 
involved in the assassination a few months ago of Jordanian 
diplomat Na'ib al- Ma'aytah. The number of persons arrested in 
connection with the crime has thus risen to 11, after charges 
were pressed against three others. 
  The Lebanese Army troops on Thursday stormed one of the 
Abu-Nidal group's barracks in al-Rawdah, Western al-Biqa', and 
seized a large amount of weapons, ammunition, vehicles, and 
missiles estimated at 25 truck loads. The army arrested 16 FRC 
members.

  [Text] In a statement it issued today, the General Labor 
Federation reaffirms its call for peaceful demonstrations on 26 
April. The GLC said the government has totally alienated itself 
from the people, opening a wide chasm between itself and the 
overwhelming majority of the Lebanese people. 
  The GLC accused the government of circumventing the demands 
of the working class and its trade union movement and of 
inventing new trade union organizations and platforms to attack 
the GLC. At the same time, the government is trying to appear 
as if it is concerned about the workers' demands.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ilyas Abu-Rizq, chairman of the Lebanese </F>
General Labor Federation, by radio correspondent Antoine 
Constantine in Beirut on 25 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Constantine] Chairman of the General Labor 
Federation: There is a danger of a confrontation between your 
federation and the security forces tomorrow. Can your 
federation be held responsible for the results of the 
demonstration under the current conditions in the country? 
  [Abu-Rizq] The government alone is responsible for such 
dangers because the government's failure to implement the 
agreement it ratified during the cabinet meeting is the cause of 
this demonstration. The government signed an agreement granting 
workers in both the public and private sectors their basic 
rights. However, the government's failure to implement this 
agreement has forced the General Labor Federation to resort to 
its legitimate right to stage demonstrations. This right is 
supported by human rights, the Lebanese Constitution, and 
international laws. The government alone will be responsible 
for anything that might occur during the demonstration or for 
banning the demonstration. If the government does not want to 
see security disturbances it must implement the agreement that 
was reached five months ago. If it does, there will be no 
demonstration. As long as the government fails to implement the 
agreement the demonstration will take place.

<F P=106> [Article by George Bashir: "Resettlement Is Knocking on </F>
Lebanon's Door and Christopher Ignores Beirut in His Tours"] 
  [Text] The possibly that U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher will include Beirut in his tour remains a very weak 
one. Past experiences do not encourage the belief that 
Christopher will drop from his calculations the factors that 
made him fail to visit Beirut in his former tours, particularly 
as the peace negotiations between the Arabs and Israel -- which 
are expected to be held later this month -- are regarded as 
important and will lead to results that reflect the ambitions of 
the Madrid Conference co-sponsors, especially the United States. 
  Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz took a negative 
position in the past that reflected the official and popular 
Lebanese resentment of U.S. Secretary of State James Baker's 
disregard for Lebanon and the Lebanese authorities during his 
shuttle trips in the region. Buwayz refused to meet the U.S. 
secretary of state anywhere other than Beirut. The U.S. 
official was consequently compelled to come to Lebanon and to 
meet with the Lebanese regime's high officials in Zahlah, 
al-Biqa'. 
  Today, as Secretary Christopher prepares for a new tour of 
the region, Lebanon needs another honorable stand similar to the 
previous one. It should refuse to go to the Washington meeting 
to be held this or next month if Secretary Christopher's tour 
does not include Beirut like the other Arab capitals. Lebanon's 
presence in the Washington meeting is fundamental. The Lebanese 
resistance operations against the Israeli presence in the south 
and from there against Israeli territories are upsetting and 
worrying to the Israelis. The peace and security of south 
Lebanon is as important as the peace and security of the 
Galilee. Why does Lebanon not take a stand this time and refuse 
to participate in the next round of peace negotiations in 
Washington if the U.S. does not treat Lebanon like it does the 
other Arab countries taking part in these negotiations? Lebanon 
has a just and reasonable case. 
  The exchange of views between senior Lebanese and U.S. 
officials, especially Secretary Christopher in telephone 
conversations facilitates the negotiating task and the exchange 
of viewpoints between the two sides. But, in the Lebanese 
people's view, this is not enough, because these contacts only 
enable the U.S. side to avoid any reproach every time the U.S. 
secretary of state bypasses the Lebanese capital on his tours. 
  Some people who are pessimistic about the negotiations in 
their pre-final stages are saying that the resettlement is 
imminent. Lebanese and Arab officials are aware of that. The 
Americans are aware of it too. How then will they make Lebanon 
drink the cup of resettlement even though it has already 
rejected this principle of resettlement? All the national 
parties here agree among themselves on the need to stand united 
against any plan that will force Lebanon to accept the 
resettlement of part of the Palestinians on its territories. 
Lebanon's economic, social, and demographic conditions cannot 
tolerate the imposition of half a million new citizens while the 
resources and geographical areas of the other Arab countries, 
especially those who expelled the Palestinians from their 
territories after the Gulf war, are greater than Lebanon's 
resources and its small geographic size. 
  Let us take a new, honorable stand and see what the U.S. 
position will be, especially as Lebanon only wants its fair 
share.

  [Text] The treacherous Israeli shelling of Frun has caused 
a major massacre. Three pregnant women -- Fatimah Hamdun, Muna 
Hayik, and Dalal Hayik -- were injured. Dalal Hayik died while 
undergoing surgery and was buried yesterday with her husband 
Hasan Ahmad Hayik, who was also martyred in the shelling. The 
two other injured women were evacuated to the American 
University of Beirut Hospital where the leg of Muna Hayik was 
amputated. The twins she was carrying died. Fatimah Hamdun's 
fetus also died. 
  Meanwhile, the Israeli attacks on the liberated areas 
continued. The hills of 'Arab Salim came under artillery 
shelling from the occupation forces' positions on the Tallat 
al-Dabshah. The southern quarter of the town also came under 
intensive machine-gun fire.

  [Text] A NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent in al-Nabatiyah 
reports that the Iqlim al-Tuffah heights came under concentrated 
artillery fire from the occupation forces' positions at about 
1930 today. The shelling, which was accompanied by heavy 
machine-gun fire, was directed mainly at Mlita, al-Luwayzah, and 
Jabal Safi. At 2000 the forests of al-Litani were raked by 
bursts of machine-gun fire from positions held by the Agent Lahd 
militia [South Lebanese Army] in 'Alman and al-Shumariyah. 
  The occupation forces this afternoon shelled Qabrikha and 
Tulin with mortars and tank guns, causing heavy material damage. 
The Qabrikha-Majdal Silm road also came under sniper fire from 
the occupation forces' positions in Tallusi. 
  Meanwhile, the Amal Movement has announced that one of its 
groups attacked an enemy mechanized patrol on the 
al-Qantarah-al-Tayyibah road at 1745 today, using rockets and 
automatic weapons. An enemy M-113 armored personnel carrier was 
destroyed and all its occupants were killed or wounded. At the 
same time, another group attacked an infantry patrol on the same 
road, skirmishing with it for 15 minutes and killing or wounding 
some of its members. A third group directed concentrated 82-mm 
mortar fire against al-Qantarah.

group from the Lebanese Resistance Battalions-Amal last night 
attacked a joint ambush manned by the Zionist enemy forces and

position with rockets and machine guns. A 15-minute clash 
ensued during which an unknown number of enemy personnel were 
killed and injured. 
  At the same time, another group shelled the occupation 
forces 
in the Rshaf position with artillery, scoring a direct hit and 
setting it on fire. Losses there are not yet known. 
  The occupation forces immediately opened artillery and heavy 
machine-gun fire on Haddathah and the surrounding area as well

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto held wide-ranging 
talks with German leaders on various issues and informed them 
that bilateral talks between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir 
dispute will not succeed until international pressure is mounted 
on India in this regard. According to Foreign Secretary 
Najmuddin Sheikh, the prime minister informed the German leaders 
that Pakistan is not against bilateral talks, but our 
experiences from previous rounds of talks show that India is 
neither serious nor sincere in finding an acceptable solution to 
the Kashmir dispute. The prime minister said the German leaders 
greatly appreciated Pakistan's efforts to establish peace in 
Bosnia. She held detailed talks with Carl-Dieter Spranger, 
German minister of economic cooperation, on financial assistance 
to Pakistan. The German financial assistance and technical 
expertise will greatly help in overcoming the energy crisis in 
Pakistan. The prime minister stressed the need for changing the 
strategy on providing German economic assistance in order to 
make part of it available for annual development programs which 
will help implement welfare and development programs. The 
German minister informed Benazir Bhutto that his government has 
initiated steps under which a private company will provide [word 
indistinct] protection for German investment in Pakistan. 
  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto returned to Islamabad early 
this morning after her four-day official visit to Germany. When 
she left Berlin for home yesterday evening, she was accorded an 
extremely dignified send-off. [passage omitted] 
  Radio Pakistan's representative says the most important 
objective of the prime minister's visit to Germany was to 
acquire technical and financial assistance for welfare and 
development programs of the present government and to muster 
support and cooperation for Pakistan's stance on regional and 
international issues, including Kashmir, Bosnia, Afghanistan, 
and Tajikistan; there has been considerable success in achieving 
that objective. A high-level delegation of the German 
parliamentary Economic Committee will soon visit Pakistan to 
review development needs. Chancellor Kohl assured Benazir 
Bhutto that this committee and the ministries concerned will 
seriously consider her suggestions in order to give a positive 
response to them as soon as possible. 
  Radio Pakistan representative Yunus Khokar says the visit 
has 
created a better understanding between Germany and Pakistan on 
the Kashmir issue and effectively exposed the human rights 
violations and Indian atrocities in Kashmir, which in turn has 
created sufficient sympathy from the German leaders and people 
to Pakistan's stand on Kashmiri people and the Kashmir issue. 
There was total coordination on the views and stand of the two 
countries on the Bosnian issue and lifting of the arms embargo 
against the Bosnian Government to enable it to defend its people 
against the savage Serb attacks. Germany lauded Pakistan's 
efforts for peace and normalizing the situations in Afghanistan, 
Tajikistan, and Somalia.

  [Text] President Liamine Zeroual this morning received at 
the headquarters of the presidency Mr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, 
Yemeni Socialist Party official in charge of foreign relations 
and special envoy of Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bidh, vice president of 
the Presidential Council of the Republic of Yemen. 
  The meeting was attended by Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah 
Dembri, and Mr. Mihoub Mihoubi, diplomatic adviser and official 
spokesman of the presidency of the Republic. 
  In a statement to the radio about this meeting, the Yemeni 
envoy said: 
  [Begin al-Dali recording] I was asked by brother 'Ali Salim 
al-Bidh, vice president of the Yemeni Presidential Council, to 
make this visit. I have a message related to the situation in 
Yemen and the recent developments it has witnessed, and also to 
the efforts made by Arab brothers in past months to overcome the 
crisis experienced by Yemen. This visit is also related to the 
stance of our brothers in Algeria toward these efforts. In 
fact, we found a very big response, in what we have heard, and a 
great eagerness for security and stability in Yemen, for Yemeni 
unity, and for the implementation of the pledge and accord 
document signed in Amman. [end recording] 
  Asked about the mediation the Arab Maghreb Union, chaired by 
Algeria, will undertake in an effort to solve the difference in 
the leadership of fraternal Yemen, Mr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali 
said: 
  [Begin al-Dali recording] We consider that both in Algeria 
and outside Algeria we have brothers, so we do not use the word 
mediation. However, we consider that the Yemeni issue is 
Algerian, Maghreban, and Arab; consequently, their contribution 
will be a strong one. I would call it a strong contribution, 
not a mediation. 
  We welcome every Arab effort to help Yemen get out of its 
present situation and ensure that it has more guarantees for 
future unity and stability. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Uzi Mahanaymi] </F>
  [Excerpt] In a coordination meeting held in Tunis this 
month between Yasir 'Arafat and his advisers and senior Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] representatives, a framework for 
cooperation between the two dominant Palestinian organizations 
in the territories was worked out. 
  It was decided that Fatah will pursue the negotiations with 
Israel in accordance with the Oslo principles, while the Hamas 
will continue with controlled operations in order to increase 
the pressure on Israel and facilitate the withdrawal process. 
  During this meeting, 'Arafat did not call on Hamas to stop 
the attacks against Israel. Incidentally, the attacks involved 
are the 'Afula and Hadera attacks, which 'Arafat later denounced. 
  The cooperation discussed is not of an operational nature, 
nor does it involve early coordination regarding Hamas 
operations, seeing that Hamas is an independent organization. 
The participants could surmise, however, that as far as 'Arafat 
is concerned, Hamas' approach is also beneficial in terms of 
achieving the goal: namely, removing Israel from the territories. 
  Following the meeting the two organizations worked out 
cooperation frameworks for Gaza, Jericho, and other territories 
Fatah takes over if and when Israel evacuates them. [passage

  [Text] A one month-long cease-fire agreement between the 
Fatah Hawks and 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] military arm, has been reached in the Gaza 
Strip. Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that a leaflet to 
this effect was disseminated in the Gaza Strip today. It states 
that the two sides will halt acts of revenge against 
collaborators in order to enable them to dissociate themselves 
from their support of Israel. The two groups will also put an 
end to mutual acts of hostility and what they term unnecessary 
strikes. It was also decided to set up a committee to 
adjudicate conflicts between the sides during this cease-fire 
period. 
  Our correspondent notes that Fatah leaders in the Strip have 
not reacted to the agreement, but a Palestinian source says it 
was reached with the knowledge of senior leaders in both 
organizations.

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on 22 </F>
April, place not given -- recorded in Hebrew with Arabic 
subtitles] 
  [Text] [Rabin] It is inconceivable that a political party 
[Likud] which had agreed to return everything in exchange for 
peace now claims it is possible to attain peace merely in 
exchange for peace. This is absurd, especially in light of the 
fact that these people are responsible for returning everything 
and uprooting all Israeli presence in order to achieve peace. 
Do they believe that by some hocus pocus we will be able to 
achieve peace with another Arab country by exchanging peace for 
peace? Not even one iota of the Sinai has remained in our 
hands. I will do everything to avoid such a price for peace. 
  [Israel Television in Arabic correspondent Menashe Bakhar] 
Are you preparing Israeli public opinion for painful 
concessions on the Golan Heights in the near future? 
  [Rabin] Look, in the negotiations with Syria, Jordan, and 
Lebanon we are not talking about interim arrangements. The 
letter of invitation to the Madrid conference referred to an 
interim arrangement only in relation to the Palestinians. We 
are not looking for interim arrangements with the Arab states, 
but rather for peace treaties. We have very little territorial 
problems vis-a-vis Jordan and Lebanon. With Syria, on the other 
hand, we have such problems indeed. I have always said that I 
personally, and the Labor Party of which I am a member, are 
ready to make territorial compromises. We have always said so, 
but previously these statements were not concrete, because Syria 
was not prepared to enter peace negotiations. Syria has started 
evincing willingness to enter the path of negotiations only in 
the wake of the changes in the international balance of power, 
the termination of the Cold War, and following the Gulf crisis. 
Generally speaking, I can say that Arab parties enter peace 
negotiations with us only after they reach the conclusion that 
they can get nothing from us by violent measures, whether this 
means all-out war or terrorism. 
  [Unidentified correspondent, in English] Regarding the talks 
in Cairo, there has been a lot of optimism about an agreement in 
early May. What new progress has been made, and what obstacles 
still lie ahead? 
  [Rabin, in English] There is a progress in the negotiations 
in Cairo, less in Paris on the economic issues. Therefore I 
believe that we are moving ahead. We are trying to reach an 
agreement which is acceptable to us as soon as possible. But I 
would not set any clear-cut date. I hope that by mid-May we 
might reach an agreement. The real problem is to reach an 
agreement in details. We need to go through all the details to 
prevent any misunderstandings once it is implemented. The 
implementation will take two or three weeks once the agreement 
will be signed.

  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn will meet with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher at his place of residence 
in London the day after tomorrow, Monday. 
  A responsible Jordanian source has said that the talks 
during 
the meeting will focus on developments in the peace process in 
the Middle East. 
  The source said that His Majesty King Husayn will emphasize 
Jordan's decision to suspend its participation in the peace 
talks if the sea blockade imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah 
continues. 
  The source noted that preliminary information indicates that 
the U.S. Administration intends to take certain measures to 
resolve the problem of the blockade imposed on the Port of 
al-'Aqabah. 
  It is worth mentioning that U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher will this week begin a tour of a number of Middle 
East countries with the objective of reactivating the peace 
process in the region. The tour will include Syria, Egypt, and 
Israel.

leader Hojjat ol-Eslam Abaei was the target of an assassination 
attempt by a terrorist here today. Abaei, who substitutes as

  The terrorist after his failed attempt tried to kill himself 
when faced with angry reaction from the worshippers chanting 
`Death to Munafiq (hypocrite)'.

<F P=106> [Political commentary: "The U.S. Troops' Nightmare!"] </F>
  [Text] The downing of two UN helicopters in northern Iraq 
-- said to have been shot down by U.S. fighter planes by mistake 
-- resulted in the killing of 26 high-level officers of the 
allied forces. 
  This incident has raised questions regarding the U.S. 
military command and their troops who have the most advanced 
tracking and identification equipment. 
  The lack of motivation and interest in military operations, 
and the disordered state of U.S. soldiers in other parts of the 
world are among the causes of such incidents. 
  The U.S. forces have the most advanced equipment at their 
disposal but they are becoming weaker by the day. These 
disasters can be attributed to the Somalia crisis and the 
Persian Gulf war. At present U.S. military capability in various 
operations all over the world is being questioned, and Pentagon 
officials have to respond to official inquiries into such 
disasters. 
  The incompetence of the U.S. forces becomes clearer when 
such 
incidents occur and this will certainly have an adverse impact 
on military relations between the United States and its allied 
countries. 
  The U.S. allies should review their military relations with 
Washington as a matter of course, especially if they wish to 
eliminate, or at least reduce, such incidents. U.S. military 
officials are also under pressure from their own people, who do 
not wish to see their offspring killed for the ideas of these 
officials. 
  In any case, in view of the increasing U.S. military 
intervention around the world, the frequency of such incidents 
will increase proportionately. Such incidents are possible in 
every part of the world where the U.S. troops are deployed.

Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] Contact Group on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on 27 April to discuss the deteriorating 
situation in Gorazde. The contact group comprises the foreign 
ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran, 
Senegal and Malaysia. 
  Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto two days back had 
sent 
a message to the UN secretary general calling for immediate air 
strikes against the Serbian artillery surrounding Gorazde which 
is one of the six safe areas declared by the United Nations. 
The prime minister had also demanded the lifting of the arms 
embargo on Bosnian forces. It is expected that Pakistan will 
strongly present these demands at the ICO foreign ministers 
meeting.

  [Text] Rabat, Apr. 25 (MAP) -- Morocco is amazed at the 
"vigorous and deluding" statements of Algerian ambassador to 
Spain this April 21 during an international conference to 
support the peace plan in the Sahara, a Moroccan official source 
said. 
  The Algerian diplomat's address unveils a total ignorance of 
the stances of each side and of the evolution of the UN 
secretary general's efforts, the source said adding the address 
was all the more amazing as the Algerian Government has 
repeatedly claimed it was observing "restraint" regarding the 
Sahara issue. The Algerian ambassador's statement was all but 
conform to the pledge to restraint [as received], a fact that 
leads us to wonder whether the statement reflects the official 
position of Algeria or only a personal opinion, said the source. 
  The Algerian ambassador had stated that the present deadlock 
in the Sahara issue was due to "hesitations of one of the two 
sides ... while the Polisario [Popular Front for the Liberation 
of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro] has always showed a high 
spirit of maturity." 
  On which basis does the Algerian ambassador make such 
allegations, the Moroccan official source wonders adding that 
seemingly the Algerian diplomat had not even consulted germane 
resolutions of the Security Council and particularly resolution 
907 which gives the secretary general until next June 30 to have 
the Polisario adhere to the compromise on interpretation and 
implementation of eligibility criteria. 
  If the Algerian ambassador had consulted the latest report 
of 
the secretary general, he would have learnt that Morocco has 
accepted a year ago the compromise and consequently the one 
responsible for the deadlock is the Polisario. 
  The Moroccan Government would have wished that participants 
in the conference examine the situation in Bosnia where hundreds 
of innocent victims are killed every day while others are living 
in inhumane and deplorable conditions, the same source said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Gulf's Security is the Responsibility of </F>
its Sons"] 
  [Text] There is no doubt that military exercises enable 
armies to gain large-scale field skills and high combat 
experience, which would not have been gained without hard 
training, direct close contact, and continuous examination of 
the latest military technologies and science. This is what was 
done by some armies in the Gulf, including the Kuwaiti Army, 
following the end of the liberation war. They held land, naval, 
and air maneuvers with the Western alliance states--the United 
States, Britain, and France--as well as naval maneuvers with 
Russia, which is also among the advanced states militarily and 
is a signatory to the military cooperation agreement with 
Kuwait. There is no doubt that the aim of these maneuvers goes 
beyond training and military doctrines to political and economic 
interests. It is not wrong to embark on such cooperation, 
particularly when the parties involved recognize mutual 
interests based on equality and respect for national 
sovereignty. However, despite their importance, these maneuvers 
are not an alternative to the Arab defense order, of which the 
Gulf is an integral part, and will not prevent efforts to build 
a regional security order that is badly needed in the region. 
Otherwise, the maneuvers will become a shackle and a monopoly 
that will lead to subservience. 
  Hence, the Islamic Republic of Iran's call several days ago 
for holding joint maneuvers with Gulf states is important and 
will reinforce military cooperation and deepen the sense of 
joint responsibility toward the region's security, on which the 
Gulf states' political literature always focuses and proposes as 
one of the Gulf desires and as a priority for the region's 
states to reinforce their defense structure. It is, however, 
noticed that this call has not been favorably received, even 
though it may provide an opportunity for us in Kuwait to 
introduce a new strategic dimension in the security cooperation 
and military coordination--a dimension that is justified in 
light of the unity of the security interests, the deep 
historical, and religious ties, and the economic and trade links 
in the past and at present. Iran's firm position on the Iraqi 
regime's invasion of the State of Kuwait, as well as the blood 
we shared in confronting that tyrannical regime, makes it 
necessary for us to establish all forms of cooperation and 
coordination between Kuwait and Iran in particular and between 
the Gulf states and Iran in general. This will breathe life 
into Gulf-Iranian relations and will remove some obstacles 
hampering strategic understanding to protect the Gulf from all 
dangers and ambitions and rise to the level of the big 
challenges threatening the Gulf region.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "We Will Not Tolerate Mistakes That </F>
Affect Our Faith. Kingdom's Relations With Islamic World Are 
Excellent"] 
  [Text] Jeddah, AL-HAYAH -- The Custodian of the Two Holy 
Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz has stressed that his 
government is not prepared to tolerate mistakes related to the 
Islamic faith and that it has no intention of harming any Saudi 
individual through his wealth. He spoke of the "strength of 
Saudi relations with the Islamic states." He said: "We are the 
friends of all within our capabilities and within mutual 
interests." 
  In a comprehensive statement to the media on 22 April during 
his inspection tour of the central station of the prophet's holy 
mosque services in holy Medina, King Fahd said: "In the midst 
of the bliss we are enjoying we should expect that someone would 
come and try to spoil it, but nobody would be able to do that 
because the people and all their institutions are unanimous in 
preventing and deterring these things." 
  He emphasized that divine will, not human capability, was 
behind the completion of his project for the expansion of the 
prophet's holy mosque. He said: "Some people said that the 
project would require 20 or 30 years to complete." He added 
that he had made the decision and assumed the responsibility, 
and the project was completed. He noted that "since the 
beginning of work on the project, God's boons and favors have 
increased for us." He said that oil production and prices have 
increased. 
  In his statement King Fahd said that "God has blessed this 
country. It has had no colonialism and no interference in its 
affairs. It is fortunate that the people of this country 
always, in private and in public, raise their hands to the 
creator of the universe adhering to their true Islamic faith 
that is free from blemishes, everyone doing his duty as dictated 
by God. This a divine bliss and we should thank God for it day 
and night, in good and in bad times, at all times." 
  He added: "We have had innumerable boons. There is no 
better testimony than the facts. The facts speak for 
themselves. Thank God, our relations with the Islamic world are 
excellent. Our relations with the states with which we have 
relations are also excellent. We have no bad relations with 
anyone at all and we owe nobody any favors, except the almighty 
God. That is why we should be grateful to the gracious almighty 
God." 
  The custodian of the two holy mosques added: "Yes, we are 
Muslims, thank God, and we adhere to our Islamic faith in letter 
and spirit, but some things are not related to that." He added: 
"We have human resources in our country today. If we look at 
the students and experts of theology in this country, and those 
entrusted with the affairs of Muslims for the purpose of 
pronouncing Islamic edicts [ifta']...we would find very 
excellent resources and raw material." 
  King Fahd added: "There can be no doubt that the theological 
resources which educate the citizens, the judges, and the 
Shari'ah courts -- the state has nothing to do with and does not 
interfere in any of these things.... We do not want anything 
from anyone. We only want to be friends with everyone. We do 
not want to interfere in problems in any way, not international 
problems, not Arab problems, not African problems, and not Asian 
problems. We want to be friends within the limits of our 
Islamic faith. We cannot, under any circumstance, swallow or 
accept anything that runs contrary to the Islamic faith. Nobody 
except God can impose his will on anyone. I say this because it 
is a fact. It is a fact about this country dating back to the 
fathers and forefathers." 
  He added: "The imams of Islam have long recorded, analyzed, 
and explained this fact. The Koran and the prophet's teachings 
are the constitution of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I do not 
believe that anyone can claim otherwise. We are everyone's 
friends within the boundaries of our capabilities and mutual 
interests. We want nothing but friendship and respect from any 
country in the world. As regards what has taken place in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the form of construction and doing 
one's duty, be it the citizen or the state, the projects speak 
for themselves. We are perhaps the least pretentious and do not 
try to project matters in the media or in a propagandist way, 
but (projects) speak for themselves in a country which 20 or 30 
years ago had no resources. I say that because I was there and 
I know this very well." 
  He added: "Where else do resources come from, if not from 
God. We have the oil. When oil was discovered the war broke out 
and stopped everything. I can say that since 1953, or perhaps 
1955, the oil began yielding an output, not the required output 
but as the years went by that output began to enable the state 
to launch projects." 
  He contined: "I was very happy that God enabled me to make 
these extensions in the Mecca mosque, and in the squares and 
buildings, and to make the roof improvements, and the same 
applies to what we now see in Medina. That will not stop at any 
limit. We will continue the good work in the interest of Islam 
and the Muslims." 
  He said: "The best social system, as they say, is the 
Islamic 
system. It is unmatched. It has gentleness and kindness and it 
has God's words." He added: "We have a wealth of theologians 
who have performed their duties in the best required way, be it 
in the Shari'ah courts, as imams in the holy mosque, in the holy 
Medina, or anywhere else in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia." 
  He continued: "Naturally, amid all these boons and graces we 
are enjoying, we should expect that some would try to undermine 
them but, by God, they would not be able to do so because all 
the people and their institutions are unanimous in their resolve 
to prevent or deter these things by legitimate means. We want 
nothing from anyone. All we want is for the almighty God to 
bless us and forgive the mistakes we unintentionally commit. I 
beseech God to show us the way and to guide us to what would be 
to his satisfaction. These projects we see now, whether in 
Medina, Mecca, or anywhere else in the country, have penetrated 
mountains as roads and reached the mountain peaks in 'Asir, and 
have reached the sea. Some are open roads, others pass through 
mountains. Roads have been built from north to south and east 
to west. And I do not say that that is all we want to do." 
  In conclusion, King Fahd said: All this is a result of 
adherence to the letter and spirit of the Islamic faith. As 
regards mistakes, they have been mentioned in the Koran and in 
the teachings of the prophet, may God's prayers and blessings be 
upon him, and the Orthodox Caliphs. The correct path would not 
have been known if there were no mistakes, but mistakes do not 
last and the state will absolutely not tolerate mistakes related 
to the faith. That will not be tolerated. There is no desire 
to upset anyone or harm him through what he owns. The state has 
never harmed anyone through his wealth. On the contrary, we 
bless everyone and wish them well. We have now seen projects 
which began some years ago and have now reached their peak.... 
They provide the evidence that God has enabled us and ordered 
us to do that work. If I am to be credited for that work, I am 
not alone in that." [closing quotation mark as published]. He 
added: "I am only completing a mission. I hope God will help 
me in any work I undertake in this country in the interest of 
the public provided it does not violate the Islamic faith in any 
way. We want nothing but good for everyone, but we will 
absolutely not let anyone come and change our faith or our 
organization of our Islamic faith because it is all good and it 
is all bliss. We see now that our relations with the world are 
at their best possible because we do not interfere in anyone's 
affairs and do not want anyone to interfere in our affairs."

  [Text] Nicosia, April 25 (AFP) -- Saudi police arrested 
five political rights activists in the northern town of Ha'il at 
the weekend, a London-based Saudi human rights group said Monday 
[25 April]. 
  The Committee for the Defence of Legitimate Rights said the 
five teachers and Muslim clerics supported its calls for 
political reforms in the kingdom, which has no parties and is 
governed according to Islamic principles. 
  A statement from the committee sent to AFP said police also 
arrested the son of Muhammad al-Massari, one of the group's 
founders, on Saturday. 
  Anwar Muhammad al-Massari, 19, was arrested "to put pressure 
on his father," who left Saudi Arabia to relaunch the committee 
in London, the committee said. 
  His father, a physics professor at Riyadh University, was 
arrested in May 1993 with a group of other Saudi intellectuals 
only days after the group was set up. 
  He was held for five months without charge, said the group, 
which is banned in Saudi Arabia and is pressing for freedom of 
speech and association. 
  On Saturday, Arab diplomats in Riyadh said Gulf Arab states 
had reservations about a US document calling on them to 
encourage pluralism and democracy as the basis of future 
relations in the Middle East. 
  The document, presented to the Gulf Cooperation Council 
(GCC) 
in February, said Washington wanted to see participants in the 
multilateral Middle East peace talks "encourage individual and 
collective freedoms and pursue democracy and pluralism." 
  Foreign Ministry officials from GCC members Saudi Arabia, 
Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman met 
in Riyadh on Saturday to discuss the document. 
  Of the six GCC states, only Kuwait has a freely elected 
parliament with various political groups represented. The other 
five have specially-appointed consultative assemblies. 
  US Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to visit Riyadh 
as part of a Middle East tour starting Tuesday [26 April].

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, planning and </F>
development minister, leader of the General People's Congress, 
and former north Yemeni prime minister and foreign minister, by 
Majdi al-Daqqaq in Cairo "a few days ago"] 
  [Text] [Al-Daqqaq] It appears that the situation in Yemen 
now has exceeded all expectations and the crisis has produced a 
new situation. How do you see it? 
  [Al-Iryani] Yes. A crisis of this kind can only bring 
something new. Let me say first that the Pledge and Accord 
Document did not introduce new ideas regarding the principles of 
the state structure. Much of what was contained in it was 
derived from the proposed constitutional amendments that were 
agreed upon between the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and the 
General People's Congress [GPC] and then among the government 
coalition parties. The amendments we agreed upon, particularly 
regarding local government, went further than what we had agreed 
upon in the Pledge and Accord Document. The concerns that the 
parties had regarding laying the foundations for the single 
Yemeni state were considered during the interim period. 
Therefore, they were not the result of the crisis itself. 
  The purpose of initiating the crisis was not to achieve what 
was contained in the document, because it was clear that the 
Pledge and Accord Document does not mean the end for the YSP. 
It had other designs, particularly regarding the issue of the 
single Yemeni state. 
  During the dialogue, the federalism balloon was released, 
and 
the party began exercising the powers of a separate government 
in what was known as the south. It became clear that federalism 
meant clearly the federalism of the (former) north and south. 
  It is certain that the YSP was not thinking about anything 
that applies to the new unified Yemen. Its views were based on 
the old division. Therefore, the Pledge and Accord Document did 
not fulfill the purpose of the party. As far as it was 
concerned, the document was not the end. Had the party viewed 
it as its ultimate objective, it would have ended the crisis. 
Therefore, I think that the party wants to impose its way of 
managing this crisis on the Yemeni people in order to achieve a 
result satisfactory to the party first and foremost. 
  [Al-Daqqaq] Is the focus of the discussion now the return of 
the army to the positions that it held before 22 May 1990? 
  [Al-Iryani] Yes. What we are actually seeing is an attempt 
for a total split. 
  [Al-Daqqaq] Therefore, are we about to witness an imminent 
extensive clash? 
  [Al-Iryani] The brothers in the YSP have clearly declared 
that they will not submit to the numerical majority, and 
constitutional legitimacy is based on the numerical majority. 
That was the rocket with which they destroyed all the 
legislative and executive institutions on the pretext that the 
party will not accept submission to majority rule. In that 
case, there was nothing we could do but to treat the party as a 
rebellious group that does not accept constitutional rules. 
This, of course, would lead to conflict. The YPC's strategy 
has always been to avoid involving the Yemenis in fighting. 
  We have assumed, rightly or wrongly, that the imposition of 
constitutional legitimacy is bound to involve the use of force. 
Therefore, we waived the right to impose constitutional 
legitimacy in order not to resort to force. The YSP exploited 
this emotional weakness of the YPC and its leaders and their 
lack of desire to shed Yemeni blood. In my opinion, had the 
executive and legislative authorities used their constitutional 
right, the party would have been the first to use force. 
  [Al-Daqqaq] How long will that situation continue? Do you 
not agree with me that the whole of Yemen is in a real 
predicament? 
  [Al-Iryani] Let us go back to the Pledge and Accord Document 
which--despite what the YSP says about it is the criterion by 
which we should be bound, now that the people's control over 
their constitutional institutions is held up by the YSP's will. 
  The document has become binding for the party at the local, 
Arab, and world levels. The party could have ruined everything 
before the document was signed. It is hard for it now to 
discredit the document. 
  The document has a provision to prevent the use of force in 
case of a political dispute. It also has a provision that 
prevents the introduction of any change in the military setup as 
well as on building a simple, rather than complex, Yemeni state, 
as the party puts it. 
  If this military aspect of the document is implemented, I 
believe that we can start to emerge from the crisis, not by 
coercing the YSP, but by knowing where its road ends. 
Personally, I cannot know the end of the party's road. That is 
unless it ends up "drawing power from the military" rather than 
from the majority. The party imposes that kind of power, 
because it draws power from the military rather than from the 
majority, which is the modern and civilized democratic principle. 
  [Al-Daqqaq] Have Arab mediation efforts succeeded in 
steering 
the crisis toward a solution? 
  [Al-Iryani] Mediators talk about ways out of the crisis. 
Serious mediation was based on a united Yemeni state. No 
mediator has requested anything different. 
  [Al-Daqqaq] It was said that some mediators have raised the 
idea of withdrawing troops to the positions they held before 
unity. 
  [Al-Iryani] I think that this request seeks to impose 
partition. 
  [Al-Daqqaq] What was the GPC response to that request? 
  [Al-Iryani] Absolute rejection of the principle. I have the 
honor to announce that I was one of the reasons behind stalling 
the "Salalah" meeting, because I rejected the request for 
withdrawing troops. We disagreed on what we would tell the 
people after the president's and vice president's meeting. 
President Salih had told the vice president ('Ali Salim al-Bid) 
that the withdrawal of the northern troops from the south and 
the southern troops from the north was rejected and that if we 
wanted to reassure the people about the military situation we 
would have to implement the provisions of the Pledge and Accord 
Document. When we got together to phrase the statement, Brother 
Yasin Sa'id Nu'man presented the picture indirectly to give the 
impression that we had consented to the principle of withdrawing 
the troops. I refused to issue an unclear statement. 
  The GPC' position is to reject the troops' return to the 
pre-22 May situation. Unity was established upon a certain 
agreement and withdrawing the troops is a violation of that 
agreement, which approved the retention of northern troops in 
the south and southern troops in the north as a safety valve for 
this unity. Withdrawing the troops would be an annulment of 
unity. 
  [Al-Daqqad] Does the YSP insist on that request? 
  [Al-Iryani] Yes. We view this as completely backing down on 
the unity agreement. It is the first true backing down on that 
agreement. 
  [Al-Daqqaq] How true are reports that the GPC has 
reservations on the Egyptian-United Arab Emirates [USE] 
mediation and holding a Yemeni meeting in Cairo? 
  [Al-Iryani] This is totally untrue. I attended the meeting 
between President Salih, Egyptian Minister Safwat al-Sharif, and 
UAE Minister al-Nu'aymi. I believe that mediation is proceeding 
along a good course based on the implementation of the Pledge 
and Accord Document, particularly its military aspects. The 
Congress cannot have any reservations about a mediation that 
pursues that course. 
  As for the tour of Ambassador Badr Hammam [Mubarak's special 
envoy to Yemen], he has received the demands of the YSP, 
basically the withdrawal of troops. We rejected that request. 
Therefore, it was wise of Egypt to quit discussing such 
requests. The new joint mediation is suitable and pursues a 
different course. It did not put forward specific ideas. The 
main question and all efforts revolve around finding a way out 
of the crisis. 
  [Al-Daqqaq] Could there be a peaceful way out of the crisis? 
  [Al-Iryani] Yes. It starts with taking the teeth out of the 
militarized people in the YSP. The YSP accuses the north and the 
GPC of being a militarized society. I can confirm that the YSP 
is handling the crisis through the military and views it from a 
purely military perspective, not from a comprehensive awareness 
of the interests of the Yemeni people. 
  [Al-Daqqaq] Why does the YSP insist on the withdrawal of the 
troops? 
  [Al-Iryani] I have already stated that withdrawing the 
troops 
means a return to partition. I do not like or intend to analyze 
ill will. It is enough for me to see ill will, and the YSP is 
handling the crisis with ill will. 
  [Al-Daqqaq] Do you believe that the crisis has become too 
complicated for anybody to keep up with it and that calls for 
separation and partition have started to be heard here and there? 
  [Al-Iryani] We now hear calls within the YSP that are 
totally 
alien to the concept of the "oneness" of the Yemeni society. 
Within the YSP, you hear people saying that the Yemeni society 
is made up of a northern society and a southern society. If 
they talk about the absence of oneness within the Yemeni 
society, it naturally follows that the northerners will be 
northerners and the southerners will be southerners and this is 
a fact that the YSP must deal with and bear its consequences 
[sentence as published]. 
  [Al-Daqqaq] You keep talking about the YSP in the south. 
What about the GPC in the north? 
  [Al-Iryani] This is not the case at all in the south. The 
southerners in the GPC fully believe in the wholeness of Yemeni 
society. As for the YSP, the issue is no longer that of the 
unity of the homeland, which is something that the YSP has gone 
beyond. It now talks about the duality of the society, which is 
a serious matter. 
  [Al-Daqqaq] Do you agree with me that there is Arab and 
international sympathy with the YSP's stands and views? 
  [Al-Iryani] That was at the beginning, but things have 
become 
clearer now. Their sympathy was based on exterior signs without 
getting to know the ulterior motivations. When the exterior and 
ulterior motivations became one, the international community 
discovered that the YSP's goal is not dialogue or the Pledge and 
Agreement Document. The world community started to discover the 
YSP's real intentions. But I am afraid that exposing the YSP's 
ulterior motives will result in a bloody struggle equal to that 
of the al-Khawarij [early Islamic sect]. 
  [Al-Daqqaq] What is the truth concerning reports about 
Sanaa's purchase of chemical weapons and cluster bombs? 
  [Al-Iryani] These are false allegations that do not warrant 
a 
response. But let me tell you that our brothers in the YSP are 
newcomers to the world of capitalist brokers. They fell easy 
prey to these brokers. Someone came and said to them: We have 
sold cluster bombs to Sanaa and we are willing to sell them to 
you. They were so naive and shallow-minded that they believed 
the broker. I think that they bought, or were about to buy. 
They later said that the north had bought prohibited weapons. 
This is not true. Cluster bombs are not "children's toys" sold 
on the market. We know what they are, who produces them, and 
the restrictions imposed on selling and buying them. If 
anything, such talk reflects irresponsibility, not only at the 
national, but also at the international level. How can they 
talk so simply about a matter that serious? 
  Let me ask; if the fighting is among the Yemenis, which 
Yemeni deserves a cluster bomb? 
  If the fight is with the YSP and its military, it is 
unacceptable to think that they deserve a cluster bomb. Do our 
brothers in the YSP think that we alone deserve these bombs? 
  [Al-Daqqaq] What about terrorism? 
  [Al-Iryani] Let me explain things to you. At the last 
cabinet meeting in Ta'izz, it was agreed to develop a security 
plan covering all cases of terrorism. The interior minister put 
it forward; it was prepared with the YSP's full participation. 
We were surprised to find that the plan covered nine terrorist 
cases only, although the YSP had said that they lost 154 
martyrs. I was the first to object to the report, which was 
incomplete. The party claims to have had 154 martyrs and 
accuses a partner in the ruling process (the Congress) of being 
behind the matter. How then could they approve the report and a 
security plan that covers nine cases only? 
  The surprise was that the interior minister announced before 
everybody that the plan, the report, and the list of cases were 
worked out in coordination with the YSP. It became clear that 
many of the cases were criminally rather than politically 
motivated. How could the party claim that it was up against a 
terrorist campaign when all it cited were nine cases? 
  [Al-Daqqaq] This is on the domestic level. But what about 
the existence of terrorist camps used by the Afghan Arabs? 
  [Al-Iryani] The only camp that the YSP has mentioned is the 
one in the [al-Maraqishah] area. The party announced that it 
took control of this camp and arrested 85 terrorists. So far 
the YSP has not brought any one of them to trial. The talk 
about terrorism is designed to defame Yemen and to prove that 
there are international terrorist forces in Yemen working to 
cause harm to others. 
  [Al-Daqqaq] The conflict is now taking an economic form. 
What do the military movements toward the oil and gas regions 
mean? 
  [Al-Iryani] There are no economic interests. The YSP is 
seeking its own interest and trying to find justifications to 
maintain the crisis. 
  [Al-Daqqaq] Have the differences between the YPC and the 
Reform Party [hizb al-islah], the third partner in the 
government, ended? 
  [Al-Iryani] Differences of opinion usually take place, but 
they are not continuous. I wish the crisis with the YSP were 
like that--agree and disagree. But the YSP is managing the 
crisis on the basis of the principle of reaching disagreement 
and not agreement, particularly with us, the YPC. The party's 
plan in managing the crisis is to close the doors to agreement 
and carry the crisis to the end. 
  [Al-Daqqaq] What can now be done to contain the crisis? 
  [Al-Iryani] There is nothing that can be done except to 
implement the Pledge and Accord Document and deploy the forces 
in a way that would prevent secession and fighting. This is the 
only solution. The forces are deployed in a way that would not 
prevent fighting and could lead to secession. What is needed is 
to redeploy them to prevent fighting and prevent one party from 
seceding. This is what the YPC can offer. 
  [Al-Daqqaq] And politically? 
  [Al-Iryani] President 'Abdallah Salih has often told all 
mediators: "Ask the YSP what its demands are in a united Yemen 
and under a pluralistic system." We in the YPC think that we 
have made big political concessions to satisfy the YSP. But the 
YSP is not satisfied. It took the premiership and nine 
ministerial portfolios. It also has a seat in the presidential 
council. Even on the basis of population, the party has taken 
more seats in the House of Representatives than proportionally 
it deserves. We made all these concessions for the sake of 
unity. We accept them. But we refuse to make concessions for 
the sake of secession.

  [Text] The Iraqi opposition has said that a group of its 
forces attacked the intelligence headquarters of the Iraqi 
regime in the Tuwaytha area of the city of Basrah. 
  A statement from the opposition Supreme Assembly for the 
Islamic Revolution [SAIRI] in Iraq said that the group used 
rocket launchers in their attack, which led to the killing and 
wounding of a number of members of the Iraqi regime's 
intelligence service, in addition to causing extensive damage to 
the building. 
  The statement indicates that the henchmen of the Iraqi 
regime 
carried out extensive searches of the area and a number of 
people were arrested. 
  The SAIRI statement adds that the governor of Baghdad has 
issued a decision to reorganize the so-called popular army.

  [Text] Baghdad, 26 Apr (INA) -- Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the 
UN Special Commission, has described his talks with Iraqi 
officials over the past two days as good and constructive. 
  Ekeus told the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY his talks addressed 
political and technical points. He called the talks a 
professional and ongoing exercise. 
  Asked whether the talks sought to work out a timetable for 
long-term monitoring and the implementation of Paragraph 22 of 
Resolution 687, Ekeus said the subject was discussed in detail. 
  It is up to the UN Security Council to lift the sanctions, 
since such a move is a political decision, Ekeus said. 
  Iraqi officials and the Special Commission, he said, are now 
drafting a joint statement about the result of the latest talks. 
  The IRAQI NEWS AGENCY has learned that subcommittees on both 
sides began holding closed sessions to prepare the statement. 
Rolf Ekeus is due to hold a news conference this afternoon at 
the al-Rashid Hotel where he is staying.

  [Text] Baghdad, 24 Apr (INA) -- The National Assembly held 
a session today under the chairmanship of Deputy Speaker Ghanim 
'Aziz Khadduri. 
  At the beginning of the session, the people's 
representatives 
discussed a report, which the Assembly presented to the annual 
conference of the Arab-European parliamentary dialogue held in 
Paris from 14 to 17 April. Sixteen Arab parliaments and 13 
European parliaments, as well as representatives of the European

  [Text] Baghdad, Apr. 25, INA -- Mayor of Baghdad, Tahir 
Muhammad Hassun, condemned the most brutal attack to which 
Baghdad had exposed by the United States and its allies in 
January 1991. 
  In a statement to the INA, Mr. Hassun slammed the 
continuation of the blockade imposed on the people of Iraq which 
had direct harmful effects on the environment and the public 
health. 
  He dealt with suffering of the municipal units under shadow 
of the blockade, saying these units were facing acute dearth in 
performance after the aggression owing to poor spare parts and 
other necessary equipment and the lack of cadres. 
  He also said that because of the harsh circumstances of the 
blockade and its direct and negative impact, the Baghad 
Municipality had decided to stop implementing a number of 
cultural, touristic and service projects. 
  Mr. Hassun appealed to all peace-loving people and forces 
around the world to understand Iraq's position and cooperate 
with the aim of breaking the unjustifiable blockade.

  [Excerpt] London, AL-HAYAH -- The Kurdistan Democratic 
Party [KDP] has hailed the "strong" relations between its leader 
Mas'ud Barzani and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. 
  AL-HAYAH has received a clarification from the party in 
Salah-al-Din in northern Iraq, which said: 
  "In your 20 April 1994 edition, you published a report under 
the headline "Barzani Sets Three Conditions for Acceptance of 
Damascus Invitation." In the interest of the truth, we wish to 
make the following clarification: 
  "1. Our party's relations with Syria are strong and based on 
mutual respect and understanding, and we attach much importance 
to these relations. 
  "2. President Hafiz al-Asad received Barzani on all his 
previous visits. Barzani's relations with President al-Asad are 
strong and warm. 
  "3. We wish to point out that Barzani would never visit 
Syria on preconditions. Syria is his own country and the gates 
of Damascus were and are still open. There is no need for 
preconditons between brothers." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Baghdad, 23 Apr (INA)--'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur, 
member of the Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party and 
secretary general of the National Progressive and Patriotic 
Front, today received a delegation from the Jordanian Islamic 
Action Front [IAF] under [Jordanian House of Representatives 
member] 'Abdallah al-'Akayilah. 
  Members of the Jordanian delegation expressed high 
appreciation of Iraq's heroic, honorable stand under the brave 
leadership of President Saddam Husayn. They stressed that the 
aggression against Iraq is an aggression against the Arab 
nation, because Iraq is the symbol of the Arab nation's 
awakening and the leader of its struggle for the sake of 
liberation and independence. They stressed the inevitable 
victory of the banner of faith carried by President Saddam 
Husayn. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Mun'im Ahmad Salih, minister of awqaf and 
religious affairs, also received the IAF delegation under 
'Abdallah al-'Akayilah. 
  During the meeting, the minister reviewed the dimensions of 
the unjust blockade imposed on the children, women, and elderly 
of Iraq. He said those who are besieging the Iraqi people are 
exercising double standards and do not hesitate to select 
oppressive resolutions to kill the lively spirit of the free, 
proud Iraqi people. 
  'Abdallah al-'Akayilah praised the militant, nationalist, 
and 
faithful campaign led by mujahid President Saddam Husayn. He 
said this campaign stresses the soundness of the Iraqi course, 
because it provides youth with immunity and explains to them the 
evil aggressive objectives targeting Arabism and Islam.

  [Text] Baghdad, 26 Apr (INA) -- The Arab Socialist Ba'th 
Party [ASBP] and Jordan's Islamic Action Front [IAF] have signed 
an action program to develop their militant ties so as to 
advance the Arab nation's aspirations for liberation and 
advancement. 
  Signed by the foreign relations head at the Iraq Command of 
the ASBP and Dr. 'Abdallah al-'Akayilah, an IAF's Executive 
Bureau member, the agreement calls for drafting a cultural 
program highlighting the Arab nation's identity and message. 
The program calls for extending support to the Arab Popular 
Forces Conference. It also provides for an exchange of visits, 
publications, literature, and expertise in the ideological and 
political spheres in the best interest of the Arab people in the 
two sisterly countries. 
  The IAF delegation left Baghdad this morning, concluding a 
visit of several days to Iraq.

  [Text] On 10 April a delegation of Golboddin's party, led 
by [word indistinct] Arghandiwal, head of the party's finances, 
visited Moscow. [Words indistinct] in an article with the 
headline: War Equipments for Hekmatyar, wrote that the purpose 
of the visit, which was [words indistinct] of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, was ostensibly about the return of seven 
Soviet prisoners of war who are with the armed groups of 
Golboddin. However, the real goal of the delegation was talks 
about the purchase of more weapons and ammunition from Russia. 
  It is reported that this week a group of Afghan Mojahedin 
has 
issued a statement, a section of which says: Russian military 
aid to antistate forces inflames the fire of fighting which has 
been ongoing since the new year. As Golboddin and General 
Dostum have started armed clashes to seize power in Afghanistan, 
a large number of people are of the opinion that the arms and 
ammunition that Golboddin buys from Russia do not stay in 
Afghanistan, but are exported to other parts of the world.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Afghan Foreign Ministry on 25 April] </F>
  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful: 
  The savage attacks of the Serbs started against the Muslim 
and meek people of Bosnia in the aftermath of the fall of the 
communist state of Yugoslavia and the establishment of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. These crimes, which entailed 
much loss of life and property and destruction and damage, have 
no parallel in the contemporary history of the world. The 
recent ruthless aggression in Gorazde has particularly aroused 
waves of hatred in people around the world. 
  Despite the fact that recent savage Serb aggression against 
the defenseless Muslims of Bosnia has been condemned by the 
Security Council, and some resolutions have been passed in 
connection with the cessation of Serb aggression, unfortunately 
no practical steps or effective measures have been taken. The 
[word indistinct] attitude of the Security Council in these 
issues emboldens the Serbs, who carelessly trample on these 
resolutions and continue their crimes. On the other hand, the 
Security Council still insists on the arms embargo on Bosnia and 
deprives the oppressed people of this country of their natural 
right -- i.e., the right of self-defense -- whereas Muslims of 
the world resolutely demand the lifting of the arms embargo on 
the Muslims of Bosnia. 
  Pursuing the basic lines of its foreign policy, the Islamic 
State of Afghanistan condemns any aggression against the Muslims 
in the world, especially against the Muslim people of Bosnia, 
and resolutely campaigns against it. As a long-standing member 
of the United Nations, Afghanistan once again strongly demands 
and supports the urgent and vigorous implementation of Security 
Council resolutions against the Serbs. As an active member of 
the ICO [Islamic Conference Organization], Afghanistan considers 
the role of this organization, in close and direct cooperation 
with the Security Council, valuable. Afghanistan hopes that by 
taking a united stance at the General Assembly special session, 
which is going to be held in the near future on Bosnian 
problems, this organization of Islamic countries, in active and 
joint participation with the United Nations, will attain such 
resolutions as to end this painful historic catastrophe and 
ensure peace in the afflicted country of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Dhaka, April 26 (AFP) -- A dawn-to-dusk strike 
called by Bangladesh's two main opposition parties demanding 
general elections under a neutral government crippled the 
capital city Tuesday [26 April]. 
  Shops, schools, businesses and most offices shut down as 
activists from Sheikh Hasina Wajed's opposition Awami League 
party fanned out to enforce the strike, officials and witnesses 
said. 
  Police stepped up patrols and guarded the office of Prime 
Minister Khaleda Zia's ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party. 
There was no report of violence in the city so far. 
  The Awami League and the Jatiya Party of deposed Bangladesh 
president Hussain Muhammad Ershad called the strike to press the 
government to allow the staging of the next elections under a 
neutral caretaker government. 
  The league, however, has exempted the port city of 
Chittagong 
and southern district of Bhola from the general strike. 
  League MP [member of parliament], Tofael Ahmed, said the 
opposition was "preparing a common structure" for a caretaker 
government for supervising free and fair polls. "We will present 
it soon before the nation," he added. 
  The league, Jatiya Party and the rightwing Jamaat-e-Islami 
have reportedly presented bills to parliament seeking 
constitutional provisions for such a government. 
  Zia's administration has termed the opposition's demand as 
unconstitutional. 
  Zia was elected in 1991 in polls supervised by a caretaker 
government, but the opposition charged her with rigging the 
ballot. 
  Political sources said opposition parties were likely to 
unveil their plan for a caretaker administration later this 
month, and that they were discussing whether to boycott 
parliament's upcoming session scheduled to begin May 4. 
  Zia has previously criticised the opposition-led protests 
saying they hampered her government's development efforts. 
  Wajed said earlier this week that the Awami League will not 
sponsor strikes if the opposition was allowed to air its views 
on state-run television and radio stations. 
  League officials said Tuesday's strike was withdrawn from 
Chittagong and Cox's Bazar sea resort districts for a local 
annual fair. It has been put off in Bhola because Zia was 
scheduled to open an power grid there.

  [Text] Tehran, April 25, IRNA -- Visiting Irish Minister of 
Defence and Marine Affairs David Andrews here Monday [25 April] 
expressed his country's readiness for promotion of scientific 
and economic cooperation with Iran particularly in fishery 
industry. Meeting with Majlis Speaker Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali 
Akbar Nateq-Nuri, Andrews invited the speaker, on behalf of his 
Irish counterpart to pay an official visit to Dublin soon. 
  Andrews said both countries had successful cooperation in 
fields of fishing and manufacturing fishing equipment, hoping 
that Iran could use Ireland's technical expertise by despatching 
students at different educational levels to Ireland. 
  Nateq-Nuri in return said Iran was prepared to exchange 
expertise with Ireland in forestry, fishery, jetty and ship 
construction industry. He also expressed hope that he could 
visit Ireland at a proper time. 
  As for massacre of Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina Nateq-Nuri 
denounced the dual approach of the U.N. Security Council to the 
plight of Bosnian Muslims and once again called for lifting of 
arms embargo against Bosnia. 
  Commenting on Gaza-Jericho compromise deal, the speaker 
called it an unjust agreement seeking to stabilize the 
aggressors in the occupied lands. 
  Meanwhile Andrews discussed issues of mutual interest with 
Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati today and called for 
further expansion of Tehran-Dublin ties in all domains. 
  Velayati in return referring to the ample grounds for 
Tehran-Dublin cooperation welcomed promotion of bilateral 
relations.

  [Text] On the second day of a two-day seminar held to study 
polices of global arrogance in Bosnia and Muslim countries, Mr. 
Rowhani, the first deputy speaker of the Islamic Majles, in a 
speech referring to the political games played by Europe and the 
United States during recent developments in Bosnia, said: 
Thanks to the plots hatched by these countries, Russia was 
dragged into the arena, and in fact they played a political 
trick on Russia. 
  He added: On the whole the West believes that the Serbs 
should not only remain but should not be weakened either. And 
the Muslims should remain in the region too, but as a weak and 
scattered group that has to depend on daily assistance from 
Europe and the United States in all fields. 
  Rowhani described cooperation among Islamic countries as 
very 
significant for the future of the region's Muslims. He went on: 
The Islamic Republic of Iran, in accordance with instructions of 
the esteemed leader and on the basis of its Islamic and 
revolutionary obligation, is determined to provide every 
assistance required and will continue its aid more than ever 
before. 
  In conclusion, the participants issued a resolution asking 
all governments of the Islamic world, and particularly the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, to demonstrate the power of Islam once 
again by imposing sanctions against those who support the Serbs 
overtly and covertly. Also in this resolution the participants 
at the seminar announced readiness for any cooperation -- 
including military, medical, and cultural cooperation -- so as 
to safeguard the entity of the Islamic land of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Tehran, April 26, IRNA -- Majlis Vice-Speaker Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Hasan Rowhani said here Monday [25 April] that 10,000 
Iranian volunteer forces are presently awaiting the U.N. 
approval for being dispatched to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Speaking 
at the two-day seminar on policies of the world arrogance in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and other Islamic states, he remarked that 
despite Iran's readiness, the Iranian forces had not yet been 
allowed to be dispatched to that region. 
  The vice-speaker said that the west was using Russia as an 
excuse to withhold help to Muslims adding that the west was now 
pretending that it was Russia which, as a member of the Security 
Council, would veto decisions of other members made in favor of 
the Muslims. 
  He further said that if the U.S., Britain and France had not 
shown the green light to Russia, the latter would not have been 
in a position to stand against western powers. 
  Stressing that over 200,000 Bosnian Muslims were ready to 
struggle and sacrifice their lives, Rowhani concluded by saying 
that although the U.N. has confirmed that Bosnian Muslims are 
under Serbian aggressions, it has so far failed to provide them 
with defensive means.

  [Text] Tehran, April 24, (IRNA) -- Islamic Revolution 
Guards Corps (IRGC) issuing a statement here today on the eve of 
the 14th anniversary of the aborted U.S. military offensive, 
recalling the memorable failure of American technology at Tabas, 
as "divine assistance". 
  The IRGC denouncing Washington's domineering policies, said 
the operation planned with "savage" precision and carried on 25 
April 1980, miserably floundered in the deserts around Tabas 
(over 600 kms southeast of Tehran) in Khorasan Province, burning 
beyond recognition the aggressors and their aircraft. 
  It was a miracle for which Iran will always remain thankful 
to the almighty. 
  The statement also condemned Washington's tacit support for 
Serb aggressors and their unabated "brutal" attacks on the 
defenceless Bosnian Muslims.
