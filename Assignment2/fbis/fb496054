  [Text] The volume of U.S.-Russian trade in 1993 was $1.2 
billion, which is $395 million less than in 1992. U.S. exports 
to Russia were 74.5 percent of exports to other CIS countries. 
Russia has become the United States' 28th-ranking trade partner 
in terms of U.S. imports. The volume of U.S. investments in the 
Russian economy as of September 1993 was assessed at nearly $500 
million.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaly Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] Moscow does not want to play any "special role" in 
the talks between the Dushanbe Government and the opposition. 
The talks will proceed by the two plus one formula, where two 
are the Tajik factions and one is the U.S. under whose auspices 
the talks are held. 
  According to a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official, 
Russian diplomats will not be present at the talks unless UN 
representatives want them to. "They attend the Wednesday 
session because (Ramiro Perez)-Bollon, UN Secretary General's 
special envoy, invited them. But as early as Thursday the talks 
may continue without them," the diplomat said. 
  He said that Russia had probably played the decisive role at 
the stage of setting the scene for the talks. "This does not 
imply, however, that our role will be as important as that at 
subsequent stages. We in Moscow believe that all the observers, 
Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, 
Pakistan and Iran, have equal rights. We do not intend to 
impose our views. Our goal is peace in Tajikistan and around 
it." 
  The diplomat could not say how long the Moscow round of talk 
will take. "No timetable for the talks has been set but we hope 
that the two sides will achieve significant results in Moscow. 
They seem to be in the right mood for that," he said. 
  The diplomat explained that a comprehensive solution was not 
on the Moscow agenda. "What is important is that the two sides 
have sat for a talk. If they could agree on ending the 
hostilities, the Moscow round would be regarded as a success," 
he noted. 
  According to the diplomat, "the dialog that has started is a 
positive event for the sole reason that it will show who really 
wants a national reconciliation in Tajikistan. It will be an 
acid test which cannot be 
cheated.

<F P=106> [Report by Teymuraz Mamaladze: "Dangerous Fishing in Black </F>
Sea of Disinformation Threatens to Aggravate Russian-Ukrainian 
Relations"] 
  [Text] "Muscle-flexing" is what the mythical observers 
from the ITAR-TASS correspondent's report called the flight to 
Crimea by the Ukrainian defense minister. Variations on the 
theme of "Radetskyy's march" were crowned with a mighty chord -- 
the suggestion that the ground was being sounded out "for the 
introduction in Crimea of a special form of rule whereby the 
Crimean president would be subordinate to a representative of 
the Ukrainian president." 
  Of itself the report is such that it could cause the utmost 
tension not only of sinews but also of all other muscles, 
including the heart: There would be no worse news today for the 
CIS, Europe, and the rest of the world than the specter of 
mounting military confrontation between Russia and Ukraine. 
Reports from Nikolay Semena, our correspondent in Crimea, and 
from the journalists of other mass media and explanations from 
official Kiev allow us to relax a little: The Ukrainian defense 
minister has not visited Crimea and a group of high-ranking 
military officials from that independent state visited the 
peninsula under the plan for inspection visits. Nonetheless, we 
cannot relax completely. 
  Armed conflicts are always preceded and then constantly 
attended by a "war of words." But while on the battle fields 
absolutely standard firearms and heavy weaponry are used, on the 
news agency tapes, in the newspapers, and on television and 
radio weapons of mass destruction are often fired and blown up 
-- weapons known in journalists' jargon as "black propaganda" 
[chernukha]. And the blacker it is the more perfect in the eyes 
of its designers and purveyors and the broader its range. 
  Disinformation as a means of pushing public opinion toward 
approving necessary political decisions and supporting "certain 
steps in a particular direction," and psychological warfare as a 
selection of tools to destabilize and upset interstate relations 
is the subject of a separate conversation. For the time being I 
should like to say the following: All my personal experience of 
work in trouble spots, be it in Abkhazia or South Ossetia, 
attests that disinforming "black propaganda" feeds conflicts 
more powerfully than irresponsible statements, actions, and 
steps by some statesmen and politicians. It kills people more 
surely than an AKM-47 or RPG grenade throwers and it kills them 
in the literal sense -- I do not have the space now to cite the 
examples and names I know. I have frequently held in my hands a 
radio intercept of talks between some "source" and some reporter 
in which the former has given an account of, for instance, 
"atrocities committed by the Georgians" and the latter has shyly 
wondered whom he should quote. "I shall tell you later," the 
"source" has reassured him. 
  I don't want it later, I would like it now. But since that 
is not entirely possible let us restrict ourselves to general 
considerations: Attempts to turn the bluest sea in the world 
and indeed other not entirely happy regions and spheres into a 
black sea of disinformation are fraught with danger.... 
  It remains to ascertain how eagerly public opinion will 
demand similar attempts to aggravate Russian-Ukrainian and not 
just Russian-Ukrainian relations (see the list of CIS 
countries). Specific sociological research methods would be a 
good thing here but for the time being my personal feeling is 
enough: They would not be particularly eager to make this 
demand.

  [Text] Novosibirsk April 7 TASS--The chemical plant in 
Novosibirsk is facing a tough financial situation which can 
affect the implementation of the Ukrainian nuclear disarmament 
programme. 
  The plant is the only enterprise in Russia which produces 
fuel for water-moderated water-cooled reactors which is to be 
shipped to Ukraine in exchange for its nuclear warheads. 
  The first batch of fuel assemblies was shipped to Ukraine in 
the end of March, deputy director general of the plant Vladimir 
Rozhkov told TASS on Thursday. 
  The Finance Ministry had to pay for the fuel nearly 30 
billion roubles, but the enterprise had received no money so far 
and cannot buy a number of accessories necessary for the 
production of nuclear fuel assemblies. 
  Experts of the enterprise warned that reserves will last 
only 
for one month. If production stops many Russian nuclear power 
plants will remain without fuel as well. 
  "A disruption of nuclear fuel shipments to Ukraine is not 
ruled out because the state, which is acting as a contractor, 
does not fulfil its commitments in time", Rozhkov said.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] It appears that the battle between the authorities 
of Ukraine and Crimea has worsened. Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov says the situation that has taken shape on the peninsula 
is due to provocations by the powers that be in Ukraine. 
  [Correspondent Vladimir Plotnikov] Kravchuk's decree 
appointing a representative of the Ukrainian president in Crimea 
has aroused particular opposition. The leadership of Crimea's 
republican movement, Russian Society, [Russkoye Obshchestvo] 
today called on citizens to rally in support of the Crimean 
president. 
  [Begin Crimean President Meshkov recording] [Words 
indistinct] that Ukraine's current leadership is the most 
dangerous, from the point of view of maintaining peace and calm 
in Europe. This leadership has relied on, and unfortunately 
continues to rely on, extreme nationalist forces in Ukraine and 
can only act within a framework designed by the nationalists. 
[end recording] 
  [Plotnikov] It may be by chance, but the war of decrees 
broke 
out on the eve of the second round of elections to the Ukrainian 
and Crimean parliaments. It might be expected that this war 
will help consolidate Meshkov's supporters. Even the autonomous 
republic's Supreme Soviet, with its current composition and 
history of total subservience to Kiev, has spoken against the 
appointment of a representative for Kravchuk in Crimea. [Video

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Karaganov, doctor of history: "Ukraine </F>
as an Apple of Discord"] 
  [Text] It is generally said that election results clarify 
a new lineup of forces, pinpoint a new development vector, and 
so forth. I suppose that the results of elections in Ukraine 
will decide or clarify very little. Everything is clear as it 
is. 
  Ukraine is in a state of half-decay. The information space 
has been disrupted; industry is grinding to a halt; 
transportation links are being scaled down: Fuel is too 
expensive. Living standards are falling rapidly. 
Disintegration has also begun to affect the armed forces. The 
provinces are moving to a subsistence mode, isolating themselves 
from Kiev politically. It would be little exaggeration to say 
that Ukraine is held together only by the wish of the majority 
of regional elites to preserve the attributes of statehood and 
also by Russian natural gas supplies and Ostankino TV 
programs.... 
  We are observing many of these processes also in Russia. 
There are two substantial differences, however. First, in 
Ukraine the situation is exponentially worse. Second, and this 
is the main thing, in Russia reform is under way and there are 
forces ready to continue it. The question is only about the 
pace and methods. In Ukraine, on the other hand, reforms have 
practically never begun in the first place. Moreover, there are 
no visible forces there yet capable of going through with them 
in earnest. 
  I do not agree with the controversial memorandum by the U.S. 
intelligence service or with those in Russia who predict social 
chaos and collapse for Ukraine in the very near future. The 
Ukrainians are just as patient and maybe even more kind-hearted 
than their Russian brothers. Even so -- let me repeat -- I do 
not think that these qualities will last us or them for more 
than one and a half to two years. 
  Neither do I share the malice of some of the Russian 
politicians who are gleefully rubbing their hands and waiting 
for Ukraine to come crawling on its knees. Such malice is 
amoral: The Ukrainians are our brothers, in trouble. Malice is 
out of place also because the social and political 
disintegration of Ukraine is a most serious threat to the 
security of Russia and the people of Russia. The imminent 
migration problem will aggravate, exacerbating unemployment, and 
the increasing drug flow will grow even more. It is terrible to 
think about the consequences of a loss of control over nuclear 
power stations, nuclear weapons, and chemical production 
facilities. 
  It is almost inevitable that Russia will have to start 
pumping colossal resources into Ukraine like into a bottomless 
pit. In this connection I would like to ask the advocates of 
rapid unification: Do they understand that this will lead to a 
sharp fall in living standards in Russia itself? Let these 
well-fed politicians, speaking on behalf of the Russian people, 
ask the Russians themselves: Do they want to donate half of 
their earnings to unification? Especially in view of the fact 
that the price of full unification even with parts of Ukraine 
can be a social upheaval and collapse of Russia. 
  There is yet another danger: An anti-Russian mood is growing 
in the West. There are not a few reasons for that: irritation 
with our state of disarray and a wish to safeguard against it, 
the fear of a revived Russian expansionism, and so forth. 
  If under these conditions Ukraine begins to fall apart, and 
Russia will almost inevitably have to intervene in this process, 
there will be cause for a new round of "cold war." Whereas the 
first "cold war" was a tragedy, the second -- in the early 
eighties -- had elements of a tragicomedy; the third, in all 
likelihood, will be a farce: After all, there is no more 
ideological confrontation, and almost no contradiction between 
the fundamental interests of Russia and the West. Nonetheless, 
it is clear that Russia, with its present weakness, will have to 
pay a high price for it. 
  Is there a chance to avoid the worst-case scenario? I do 
not know. It would be best if Russia and the West by joint 
political efforts forced the Ukrainian leadership to undertake 
reform in exchange for economic aid. Russia would obviously 
gain from Ukraine's economic openness, and the West from its 
political independence. Even if the West does not furnish mass 
assistance, one should insist on a dialogue with it on Ukraine's 
problems: at least to minimize possible damage. 
  Yet there is also another option: to prevent the 
disintegration of Ukraine by demanding the removal of barriers 
and participation in privatization programs and at the same time 
promoting direct links with regions and cities. It is 
beneficial politically: We establish ties with actual people 
and actual interests. It is also beneficial economically: 
Ukrainian goods are relatively cheap. It is beneficial from 
the human point of view: We can help Ukraine survive in these 
difficult years. Moreover, one could hope that people 
articulating the real interests of Ukraine and the Ukrainians 
will be coming to power in Kiev and at the local level. And 
they, these interests, consist in ensuring the closest possible 
union with Russia. 
  The abyss into which Ukraine's leadership has plunged it 
will 
never make it what Russia's foes hoped it would -- its strategic 
counterbalance. The very best on which the advocates of 
Ukrainian statehood can count is to preserve an independent but 
in actual fact economically semidependent state. This is not 
the worst possible option for Russia either. With such a 
pattern of relations with Ukraine as well as with other CIS 
states, we can emerge from the status of a milk cow into a state 
relieved of the burdens of empire, but retaining many of the 
benefits of its former geostrategic and geo-economic, so to 
speak, position. 
  To achieve this (or any other desirable result), however, a 
vigorous, concentrated policy is needed. Which, in my opinion, 
does not exist.

  [Text] Russian Foreign Ministry has no information 
concerning facts of mistreatment with respect to Russian 
diplomats in Pyongyang on the part of the authorities of the 
Korean People's Democratic Republic. A high-ranking Russian 
diplomat made these comments in his interview with Interfax 
regarding the rumors about attacks against employees of the 
Russian Embassy in Pyongyang due to the recent arrest of three 
North-Korean diplomats in Moscow. 
  According to the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
Director 
Sergey Stepashin, the diplomats were caught red-handed trying to 
buy advanced Russian technologies. 
  Interfax interlocutor underlined that Moscow would 
demonstrate adequate reaction in case of "unfriendly actions" 
with respect to Russian diplomats in the DPRK. 
  At the same time he believes that first of all it is 
necessary to investigate the incident with the employees of the 
Korean Embassy. "Given the fact that a tense situation has 
established on the Korean peninsular and Russia is participating 
in its settlement, nobody needs any espionage scandal," said the 
Russian diplomat.

  [Text] Seoul April 6 TASS -- The South Korean Government 
does not intend to grant a political asylum to former North 
Korean workers who fled timber-felling sites in Russia, 
President Kim Yong-sam said at today's meeting with Korean 
industrialists devoted to the results of his recent trip to 
Tokyo and Beijing. 
  An official of the South Korean presidential staff quoted 
the 
president as saying some 90 timber cutters from North Korea had 
applied recently to the South Korean embassy in Moscow and the 
country's consulate in Vladivostok, asking for a political 
asylum. "However, these requests will not be met in order not to 
irritate North Korea", the official said. According to him, Kim 
Yong-sam also stressed that "the government's stand on this 
matter has not changed" and the possibility of North Korean 
workers' resettlement to South Korea is not being considered. 
  According to information of the South Korean Government, 
about 16,000 North Koreans are presently working at 
timber-felling sites in Russia's Khabarovsk territory. They are 
attracted by relatively high wages, as compared with those in 
North Korea. Some 170 North Korean workers have fled Siberian 
labour camps with a view to avoid returning to their native 
land. At the moment, they have to knock about Russia without 
even any passports. Some of them managed to illegally cross the 
border into China, where a lot of ethnic Koreans live at present.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 2 KYODO -- A senior aide to Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin said Saturday [2 April] Russian 
reformist politicians will band to create a new political group 
intent on reinvigorating moves toward democracy. 
  Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the Intelligence Policy 
Committee of the State Duma, said in an interview with Kyodo 
News Service in Tokyo that the new group will help prevent 
Russian democratic forces from being splintered. 
  The State Duma is the 450-member lower house of the Russian 
parliament. 
  The group will consist of Poltoranin, former Deputy Prime 
Minister Yegor Gaydar, former State Secretary Gennadiy Burbulis 
and other reformist politicians, he said. 
  The establishment of the new group will be pushed to help 
accomplish Yeltsin's recent proposal to have the Russian 
parliament adopt a declaration committing all political forces 
to seek to achieve national reconciliation, he said. 
  Poltoranin said he is convinced that Yeltsin will agree to 
join the new group, saying the president is aware that he has 
drawn his political strength chiefly from reformist politicians. 
  "The president is aware that his support base comes from 
reformists and he would end up losing his power if he lost their 
support," he said. 
  Poltoranin dismissed as false propaganda the rumors that the 
health of Yeltsin has deteriorated to a level so bad as to make 
it difficult for him to engage in his presidential duties.

  Speeches at the press conferences have demonstrated an 
expected, but still paradoxical result: the official group was 
characterized by extreme radicalism, while the private one was 
extremely moderate. Both groups outlined a similar range of 
problems facing the present-day Balkans, but offered 
diametrically opposed assessments of the problems and methods to 
resolve them. 
  In the view of Mr. Vengerovskiy's "team," the situation in 
the republics of the former Yugoslavia could not be worse, while 
Mr. Sheynis and "Yabloko" believe that "the tide is turning, 
although it is weak and fragile." The deputy speaker thinks 
that the Yugoslav conflict was provoked by outside forces, while 
his opponent thinks that internal ones are to blame. The State 
Duma's official representatives entitled their statement "On the 
Situation in the Serb Republics," while the unofficial ones 
emphasized that there are no such subjects of international law. 
The former denounced the Russian Foreign Ministry for conniving 
at the UN actions, while the latter praised the Foreign Ministry 
for its recent constructive steps. 
  Speaking about the Serbs' hopes for Russian support, the 
first group focused its attention on the Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia and military assistance provided in the form of 
"Russian volunteers" as opposed to "Muslim and Croat 
mercenaries;" the second group pointed to Russian democrats who 
could support Serbia's peace-loving forces. 
  The officials offered two exotic drafts: the resettlement of 
140,000-200,000 Russians -- "refugees, officers, and warrant 
officers" -- to the Adriatic coast and the deployment of the 
Russian Navy in locations where Croat aggression seems most 
probable. The other group was stingy with drafts. 
  Both groups favored the lifting of sanctions against 
Yugoslavia, but by different methods. Mr. Vengerovskiy proposed 
that they be lifted immediately, that the Serb republics be 
recognized, and that "UN bribe takers," who profit by smuggling 
illicit goods, be spurned. Mr. Sheynis pointed out that a lack 
of joint borders between Yugoslavia and Russia makes it 
impossible to lift the embargo unilaterally, that bypassing the 
United Nations would be irresponsible and counterproductive, but 
that one has to fight for the official lifting of the sanctions 
imposed because the Serbs rejected the Vance-Owen plan, which 
has already been buried by all the conflicting sides. 
  The two missions had different visions of the State Duma's 
role, too. The deputy chairman called on the Duma to head the 
pro-Serb movement in Russia and to revise "legislation that 
regulates the activity of the Russian Government with regard to 
the republics of the former Yugoslavia." The "private" Sheynis 
put forward the modest idea of "influencing public opinion in 
Russia and abroad" and parliamentary hearings on the Yugoslav 
question. 
  The only occasion where Mr. Vengerovskiy sounded softer 
involved his opponent: In his words, Sheynis professed 
universal human values. The opposite side's assessment was 
harsher: In "Yabloko's" opinion, members of the official group 
were characterized by a pre-formed stance, incompetence, and the 
desire to exploit international problems in the domestic 
struggle.

member of the Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, 
met here today with Valentin Kuznetsov, first deputy leader of 
the Russian Communist Party [name and title as received]. 
  During the meeting, 'Abd-al-Ghafur gave a detailed

their insistence on breaking the economic blockade through 
patience, jihad, and continued progress and construction. He 
also pointed to the positive development in Russia's position at 
the Security Council, and stressed the need for Russia to adopt 
more effective positions, and for the Russian parties work 
through the Parliament, the government, and popular bodies to

22 of Resolution 687. 
  Kuznetsov reiterated the Russian Communist Party's position, 
which supports the Iraqi leadership and people. He lauded the

  [Text] The Georgian parliament continued debate on the 
regional peace agreement signed in Moscow on Monday. Debates on 
the same topic the day before had yielded no results. 
  Opposition members have failed to offer any alternative to 
the peace deal, our correspondent reports. 
  At the same time, one opposition member Boris Kakubava has 
made an abortive attempt to bring a motion of no-confidence in 
Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze. 
  In an emotional address to the house, head of the interim 
committee for the state of emergency Jaba Ioseliani called the 
opposition's bluff: "What exactly do you want? If you want 
war, you must say so. But if you want peace, this can be 
achieved by moving step by step, including agreements similar to 
that signed in Moscow."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>
  [Text] Dushanbe 6 April, TASS -- "The people of Tajikistan 
pin their most sincere hopes on the negotiations process, 
expecting it to bring the country civic peace and national 
unity, to end the confrontation and stabilise the situation on 
the Tajik-Afghan border," ITAR-TASS was told by Vice-Chairman of 
the Tajik Council of Ministers Mahmadsaid Ubaydulloyev, who is 
responsible for the work of security structures in the Tajik 
Government. 
  "From the very first days of the restoration of the 
constitutional system in the country, the Tajik leadership was 
ready to open a dialogue with all the constructive opposition 
forces that share the idea of settling all the existing problems 
by political means and building a democratic, secular, 
law-governed state," the vice-premier added. He noted the 
important political role played by members of the Commonwealth 
of Independent States, primarily Russia, and also the United 
Nations in the organisation of the negotiations. 
  Touching on the terms advanced by some representatives of 
the 
opposition, who want for a coalition government to be formed in 
the Republic, the prime minister said that the present 
government was fully legitimate, because it was elected by the 
country's Supreme Soviet. "As a matter of fact," he added, 
"this question, as well as the republic's future state pattern, 
can be decided only by the Tajik people, and not by individual 
groups of leaders." The vice premier did not rule out the 
possibility of a referendum, which could be held for this 
purpose. 
  Ubaydulloyev cautiously commented on the two tough 
statements 
released by the press centre of the Tajik procurator-general's 
office and published by the local press at the end of March. 
They demanded the trial of several leaders of the armed Tajik 
opposition, who were accused of state crimes last spring. Legal 
proceedings were instituted against them. He only said that 
"every citizen of Tajikistan, whether a rank and file person or 
head of the Republic, should answer for his deeds in accordance 
with the national laws if criminal proceedings are instituted 
against him. This is even more correct if we want to build up a 
law-governed state. However, the last dot in this question 
should be put by the people themselves."

<F P=106> [Report by Armen Khanbabyan "Russia Does Not Let </F>
Humanitarian Grain Through to Armenia. Washington Unhappy Over 
Plans To Restore Armenian Atomic Electric Power Station"] 
  [Excerpts] Armenian Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan 
received U.S. Ambassador to Yerevan Harry Gilmore the other day. 
A laconic official communique to this effect said that the 
sides discussed a number of problems of an economic nature, 
including questions related to deliveries to the republic of 
American humanitarian aid in the shape of seed grain, and the 
resumed startup of the Armenian nuclear electric power station 
[AES]. 
  These problems are of paramount importance for the 
republic's 
life while their solution is running into considerable 
difficulties. Back on 21 March, THE NEW YORK TIMES accused 
Russia of the fact that Moscow was to blame for the delay in 
bringing to Armenia nearly 2,000 tonnes of seed grain, the funds 
to buy which had been provided to Yerevan by the United States. 
Under an American-Russian agreement signed two years ago, 
humanitarian freight transit is not subject to customs duties; 
this time, however, Russian customs demanded the payment of 30 
percent of the freight's cost, or $750,000 in customs duties. 
  Moscow seems to be ready to move the grain from Saratov 
where 
it is stuck, but the customs structures remain stubborn -- while 
neither the United States nor Armenia intend to bow to their 
demand because this would create the dangerous precedent of 
turning a humanitarian action into a routine trade deal. 
Incidentally, the grain was bought by Armenia with American 
money in Russia which in itself has made the Russian side a 
considerable profit, and its stubborn desire to get additional 
dividends appears as not very seemly, to put it mildly. Some 
local analysts suppose in this connection that Russia is thus 
trying to put political pressure on Yerevan and Washington. 
Whether this is the case is hard to say but Congressman Richard 
Lehman, a Democrat, has already put a bill before the House of 
Representatives under which the United States is to cut all aid 
to countries obstructing the delivery of American humanitarian 
aid to its destination. [passage omitted] 
  While Washington is trying to give Yerevan the necessary 
help 
in grain supplies, the American side's attitude to the Armenian 
Government's intention to revive the AES is directly the 
opposite. Ambassador Gilmore told Prime Minister Bagratyan that 
in the United States there are many opponents of restarting the 
station. According to the ambassador, their stance is explained 
both by not knowing the real energy supply situation in the 
republic, and the fears that the Armenian side may not be able 
to ensure the reliable physical protection for the facility. 
This apparently means that the men in Washington do not intend 
to help finance the restoration work. In the meantime, 
according to specialists' estimates, the latter would cost $70 
million, signifying that the project cannot do without foreign 
aid anyway. Under the recently signed Armenian-Russian treaty, 
Moscow will help Yerevan restore the AES, but this assistance 
will be mainly of a technical nature. It is up to the 
republic's government to solve the main questions of financing. 
It is with this objective that Sepuh Tashdzhyan, the state 
minister in charge of the power engineering sphere, has gone on 
a foreign tour to visit England and Italy. There is a hope that 
people in Europe will treat Armenia's request with 
understanding. Tashdzhyan will also visit the United States 
where he, as an American citizen and specialist in the field of 
oil and gas production, has many connections in corresponding 
circles. Whereas the Americans would hardly give money for the 
restoration of the AES, in the United States it would in all 
likelihood still be possible to get funds for the program of 
prospecting for oil and gas fields in Armenia. Indeed, if 
commercial deposits of oil and gas are discovered, this would 
spur the movement against restarting the AES in the republic and 
alter the authorities' intentions in this question.

  [Text] On night of April 7 Vladimir Kazimirov, special 
representative of the Russian president and Ambassador at large, 
who is a mediator in the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
conflict, met with President Heydar Aliyev in Baku. The meeting 
was held behind closed doors. There is no information about the 
details of this meeting. 
  On the eve of the meeting Kazimirov reported in his 
interview 
with journalists that the major goal of his present visit to 
Baku is the clarification of the position of the Azerbaijani 
party to the renewed variant of the Russian plan aimed at the 
political settlement of the Karabakh conflict. 
  The Russian plan, in particular, provides for a cease-fire 
and cessation of hostilities to be followed by withdrawal of the 
troops from the territories occupied in the course of 
hostilities, restoration of communications, return of refugees 
to their permanent place of residence, and, at the third stage, 
political negotiations on the legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vaino Reinart, Estonian delegation head at </F>
Russian-Estonian talks, by RIA-NOVOSTI correspondents Igor 
Klyuyev and Aleksandr Veretennikov in Tallinn; date not given: 
"Estonia Is Not About To Agree to Compromises Designed To 
`Perpetuate the Occupation'" -- first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] The 18th round of Russian-Estonian talks opened in 
Moscow yesterday. Ahead of this event Estonian Delegation Head 
Vaino Reinart answered RIA-NOVOSTI correspondents' questions. 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] According to the Estonian press, the 
republic leadership is extremely pessimistic about the chances 
for the 18th round of Russian-Estonian talks. Is that right? 
  [Reinart] Not at all. The Estonian delegation is going to 
Moscow with a calm heart. The somewhat unexpected turn of 
events at the 17th round of talks caused a stormy reaction in 
Europe, which clearly confirmed the correctness of our stance at 
the talks. The demand for the Russian troops to be withdrawn by 
31 August this year won the unequivocal support of NATO, the 
CSCE, the EC, and the United States. At the same time it was 
stressed that the withdrawal must be effected without any 
additional terms being put forward. I hope that Russia too has 
drawn the necessary conclusions from the international reaction 
and chosen a more constructive approach than the one it voiced 
during the last round. 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] It is known that the preparation of a 
general treaty regarding the troop withdrawal, including the 
settlement of matters pertaining to military pensioners, has 
been a stumbling block in the negotiating process. There are 
reports that Estonia is drafting new wordings of some agreements 
that will now be acceptable to the Russian side. Can you 
confirm that? 
  [Reinart] The Estonian delegation has naturally spent all 
this time working on various drafts and we hope that Russia too 
has not abandoned the quest for constructive solutions. The 
main troop withdrawal treaty was ready during the last round and 
I do not really understand why we were not able to initial it. 
I cannot see Russia's proposed changes regarding the text that 
has already been coordinated as anything but Russia's reluctance 
to complete the work on this draft treaty. Estonia's priority 
in this round of talks is to complete the preparation of the 
troop withdrawal treaty as required by the resolutions adopted 
by international organizations. We are of course willing to 
discuss the draft agreement on social guarantees for military 
pensioners and we hope that Russia will give up its demands for 
Estonian legislation to be amended in order to secure decisions 
beneficial to it. 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] The Estonian Government has approved and 
submitted to parliament the draft law on the border whereby 
Estonia's land border is fixed in accordance with the 1920 Tartu 
Peace Treaty. Does this mean that your delegation will raise 
the question of territories during the 18th round of talks? 
  [Reinart] Estonia has not taken any unilateral steps 
regarding the border issue. We believe that such actions will 
not bring us closer to really resolving the problem. In its 
proposals Estonia acts on the principle of international law 
whereby interstate borders are fixed by international treaties. 
The only treaty fixing the border between Estonia and Russia is 
the Tartu Peace Treaty, which is still valid today. Despite the 
Estonian side's repeated requests, Russia is refusing to provide 
legally valid explanations that accord with the principles of 
international law as to why the border should run through an 
area not prescribed by the Tartu Peace Treaty. Russia has also 
responded in the negative to Estonia's suggestion that this 
question be submitted to the International Court of Arbitration 
in The Hague for consideration, which, as you know, only 
examines contentious issues with the consent of both parties. 
If Russia is so convinced of its arguments, I cannot understand 
why it is not willing to resolve this issue on the basis of 
international law. 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Latvian Delegation Head M. Virsis 
described the results of the Russian-Latvian talks as a 
"difficult compromise for both sides." Is Estonia ready for 
such "difficult compromises," will it take its neighbor's 
experience into consideration? 
  [Reinart] Russia has repeatedly said that the example of 
another Baltic country -- Lithuania, from which Russian troops 
were withdrawn without the corresponding treaty's being 
concluded -- does not set a precedent for Estonia and Latvia. 
The corresponding Russian-Estonian and Russian-Latvian draft 
treaties were different from the very outset just as certain 
aspects were also different. Estonia has already made "difficult 
compromises" with Russia by agreeing to the final date for the 
troop withdrawal by 31 August this year. The possibility of a 
certain number of military pensioners obtaining residence 
permits in accordance with Estonian legislation is also a 
compromise. Estonia is not about to agree to any compromises -- 
difficult or easy -- that are designed to perpetuate the 
occupation. We hope that Russia is also prepared to act on the 
basis of the principles of international law when resolving the 
remaining problems.

  [Text] Kiev, 6 Apr--Certain mass media in Russia circulated 
rumors that Defense Minister Vitalyy Radetskyy and a group of 
high-ranking officials of Ukraine's military department 
allegedly paid a secret visit to Crimea. It was also pointed 
out that a Ukrainian special purpose unit arrived in Crimea on a 
"mysterious mission." 
  "Lies, which are persistently circulated by the mass media 
of 
Russia, are carefully directed by someone and are needed by 
someone." This is how the press service of the Defense Ministry 
of Ukraine refuted this information. 
  It is true that Lieutenant General Horin, first deputy chief 
of the general staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces, accompanied by a 
group of officers, made a planned trip to Crimea on 5 April. He 
was working at the headquarters of the naval forces of Ukraine, 
studying the state of affairs, and visiting warships, and he 
returned to Kiev on the same day.

  [Text] Today the Federation Council approved a decree by 
the Russian president on introducing a state of emergency in the 
conflict zone on the territory of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. 
The discussion was held behind closed doors and lasted four 
hours. However, the issue was not settled, and the problem will 
be discussed tomorrow. 
  After the session, Ingush President Ruslan Aushev stated to 
an ITAR-TASS correspondent that he may leave it. He disagrees 
with the approaches used to settle the conflict. North Ossetian

  [Text] Russia plans to maintain about 30 military bases on 
the territory of the former Soviet Union. President Boris 
Yeltsin has issued an official decree on the creation of 30 
bases in accordance with proposals from the Russian ministries 
of defense and foreign affairs. Most of the bases are to be 
located in the CIS, in the 12 former states of the USSR that 
have arisen since the collapse of the Soviet Union, with one 
base in Latvia, at Skrunda. 
  In Latvia and Estonia there is still a contingent of Russian 
troops, about 20,000 men, due to be withdrawn by the end of the 
summer. 
  As Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of staff of the Russian Armed 
Forces, stated, nearly all former Soviet republics have 
expressed the wish to have Russian military bases set up on 
their territories. 
  Aleksandr Rannikh, ambassador of the Russian Federation, was 
summoned to the Latvian Foreign Ministry today and requested to 
present by tomorrow an explanation for the decree signed by 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin on 5 April. (Maris Riekstins), 
secretary of state at the Foreign Ministry, expressed a 
categorical protest at the intention, formulated as a decree, to 
create military bases of the Russian Federation's armed forces 
in the CIS states and the Republic of Latvia, for the purpose of 
ensuring the security of the Russian Federation and the 
countries indicated, as well as trying out new arms and military 
techology; this is in clear contradiction with the agreements 
reached at international talks and the position of (?free) 
Latvia. 
  After the seminar being held by the Cabinet of Ministers on 
the national programs, there is to be an extraordinary session 
of the government at Jurmala this evening, at which an official 
statement from the Latvian Government is due to be adopted 
regarding this decree of Yeltsin's.

  [Text] Unilateral action taken by Russia aimed at setting 
up military bases in Latvia against the will of a sovereign 
state run counter to the principles of international law and 
obligations -- which had been undertaken by Russia as a member 
of the United Nations and a participant of the CSCE -- the 
statement of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry reads. 
  On 5 April, Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed an edict 
according to which approval is given to the proposal by the 
Russian Ministry of Defense to set up Russian military bases on 
the territories of CIS countries and Latvia for testing new 
weapons and military equipment. 
  Lithuania supports in every possible way Latvia's desire to 
have the Russian troops withdrawn from her territory and 
declares that only the Republic of Latvia has the right to 
decide the military basis of what state can be deployed on her 
territory, the statement of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry 
reads.

  [Text] Russia's partnership with NATO "should be different 
in its scale and intensity than with other countries," 
President Yeltsin said in an exclusive interview with INTERFAX. 
He was asked about terms for Russia's acceptance of the 
Partnership for Peace program. 
  In his words, there is a goal "to reach a special agreement 
with NATO, befitting the place and role of Russia in world and 
European affairs, its military power and nuclear status." 
  "In general, we have been acting without haste. We have 
conducted consultations with CIS states, and now we are 
approaching the time when we need to sign a framework document," 
Yeltsin said. 
  Russia, he continued, "has its own concept of cooperation in 
Europe. Its central element: CSCE as a priority common 
regional political forum and the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council as the leading mechanism of military and political 
partnership should coordinate activities of other structures, 
NATO included." 
  Asked by INTERFAX's special correspondent Vyacheslav 
Terekhov, what lessons politicians should learn from that which 
the people of Russia went through last October, Yeltsin stressed 
the need "above all to ban violence and extremism and prevent 
ignoble agitation and disturbances." 
  He believes that all possible efforts to forestall a tragedy 
similar to the events in Moscow on October 3-4 "must be for any 
politician in Russia the supreme goal and a must for both 
himself and his associates -- whatever their convictions may be." 
  "Elections -- that's the way to reach political objectives, 
Yeltsin remarked. [quotation marks as received] Rebellions, 
uprisings, etc. Are outlawed as politically immoral. That's 
the first lesson from the October tragedy." In his opinion, 
this lesson "is just being learned, and with difficulty at 
that." As testimony of this, he referred to the preparation of 
an agreement on civic peace, "which more and more parties and 
organizations have been willing to join." 
  "There is yet another lesson from those somber days -- the 
vital need to consolidate the state. No one must be allowed to 
ruin state buildings, assault TV premises, man armed 
detachments, etc. The state must safeguard its citizens against 
all that," Yeltsin said. "Regrettably, extremism then was curbed 
only at the last moment. And if those efforts had failed -- what 
streams of blood would have flown in Moscow and all over 
Russia?" Yeltsin remarked. 
  In his words, there is now the essential minimum, above all 
the democratically adopted Constitution, to consolidate the 
state. 
  As he noted, the Constitution "has put an end to dual power, 
has offered peaceful and civilized ways to resolve differences 
and has laid the basis for interaction between all sensible 
forces in Russia. "Sentiments in favor of searching for 
agreement are prevalent now, Yeltsin said. I see my task in 
making such concord a realty." 
  Asked about his intention to nominate himself for a new 
presidential term, he described this question as "premature." 
  On his chief task in the coming two years before 
presidential 
elections, Yeltsin said that there was nothing more important 
than to ensure stable relations "between full-fledged efficient 
branches of power -- executive, legislative, and judicial." 
  In his words, there is a new climate of interaction evolving 
with the Federation Council and State Duma alike. "The dialogue 
is developing, Yeltsin noted. I will do all I can so that this 
constructive mood will strengthen, so that parliament can 
complete its entire term, so that the next scheduled elections 
are precisely that kind of elections and that they take place in 
the conditions of stability and a higher political culture." 
  In Yeltsin's view, there is a second task linked to that -- 
to make Russia, "our Federation" more united over these two 
years. Having admitted that work to coordinate federative 
relations has at times been painful and tense, Yeltsin noted 
that "on the whole this process is under control not only 
centrally but regionally." 
  "Over these two years we need to advance in earnest within 
the Commonwealth of Independent States and elsewhere, Yeltsin 
stressed. I do not want to talk in detail at this stage about 
our plans, this is a separate big topic. But I think in two 
years our states will be much closer towards each other. 
  He called economics as third in his list of priorities. "All 
of us are now going through a grueling school. If we recall 
what the last 2-3 years have been, we can say with confidence 
that we have learned something," he said. Noting that only a 
tiny part of the experience gained in Russia through the 
centuries and subsequently destroyed has been returned so far, 
he stressed nonetheless that "this return is going on in 
increments." "The next two years will become exceedingly 
important in this respect, Yeltsin noted. "I hope that in time 
our economy's multiple ills will begin to disappear to the 
relief all of us."

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature no. 66 (556) by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Below is the text of President Yeltsin's interview 
with Interfax news agency. 
  IF: Six months since last October's tragic events, what do 
you think are the main lessons that Russian politicians ought to 
have drawn? 
  YELTSIN: Going back to those days makes me both bitter and 
sad. But this has to be done to prevent such tragedy from being 
repeated. I think that to any Russian politician, this must 
become a supreme goal and the main demand to himself and his 
associates regardless of political leanings. What is needed 
most is an internal ban on violence, extremism, the fuelling of 
vile emotions and social unrest. 
  The only way of achieving political goals is through the 
ballot box. Mutiny or uprising must be outlawed. This is the 
first lesson to be learnt from the October tragedy. I can now 
say that it is being learnt by all of us, albeit with 
difficulty. One indication is the preparation of a civil peace 
pact with more parties and groups willing to join it by the day. 
  One other lesson from those dark days is a vital necessity 
to 
beef up the state. What happened at the time was largely due to 
inadmissible connivance at extremism and political promiscuity 
which must be banished in a healthy state. No one must be 
allowed to attack government offices or siege a TV center or 
form armed units. It is the state's duty to protect civilians 
and ensuring security is its main function. Unfortunately, the 
government had managed to bring an end to the rioting only in 
the last stage. If not, what rivers of blood would have flown 
throughout Moscow and Russia? 
  We now have a minimum of what it takes to consolidate the 
state. First of all, this is a new constitution approved in last 
December's nationwide referendum. The constitution put an end 
to the long- running power struggle by offering civilized ways 
of resolving controversial issues, leading the country out of 
the deadlock of confrontation and laying down the basis for 
cooperation by all sensible forces of Russia. The mood of 
searches for consensus now prevails and my task is to turn it 
into reality. 
  IF: With next presidential elections about two years away, 
what is your main priority in the run up to the vote? Will be 
seeking re-election? 
  YELTSIN: I have already answered that question in part. But 
to follow up, it is most important to try to avert new upheavals 
and prevent the past tragedy from being repeated. Six months 
on, there are indications that the country has shifted to a 
different option -- that of understanding and cooperation with 
confrontational attitudes receding into the backyard of body 
politics. My own task is to help this in every way but above 
all, to arrange stable relations between the government, 
legislature and judiciary. 
  There emerges a new climate of cooperation with the 
Federation Council and State Duma. Though there are some 
hitches, there is also a drive for seeking compromise and 
banishing ultimatums. Dialogue is evolving. I will do my best 
to beef up this newly- emerging creative mood so that the 
parliament works through its term of office and the next 
election comes into its own stead in conditions of internal 
stability and higher standards of political culture. 
  The accompanying task is to try to consolidate the unity of 
Russia and our Federation as a whole. There is a good deal of 
doom and gloom about its possible breakdown, but this will not 
happen. We managed to stop it from plunging into chaos at the 
most complicated moment. The process is now under way of 
evening up federal relations, though with pain and friction 
sometimes because of regional specifics. But it is under 
control both by the center and the regions. We must make a 
serious advance at home in the next two years. And also within 
the CIS. I do not want to speak at length about our plans here, 
this is a big and entirely different theme altogether. But I 
think our states will move closer to each other in the next two 
years. 
  And of course, there is a third important priority, that is 
the country's economy. All of us are learning hard. Looking 
two or three years back, it can be said with a fair amount of 
certainty that we have learnt a few things. By now, we have 
managed to recover only a tiny part of the experience it took 
Russia centuries to gain and which was later destroyed. 
Recovery is under way and its pace will increase in parallel. 
In this sense, the next two years will be crucial. I hope that 
many of the ills of our economy will have gone and all of us 
will feel much relieved. 
  As for the second part of your question, I think it has been 
raised much too early. 
  IF: Opinions vary about the concept, formula and timing of 
Russia's entry of the NATO-sponsored Partnership for Peace [PFP] 
program. What is the president's viewpoint on this? 
  YELTSIN: We have our own concept of European cooperation. 
Its key elements -- the CSCE as a priority regional political 
forum and the Council of North Atlantic Cooperation as a leading 
mechanism of military-political partnership -- will coordinate 
the activity of other structures including NATO's. 
  Russia backed up the NATO plan from the very start. On the 
formula and timing of Russian membership of the Partnership 
plan, I have instructed the defence ministry and other 
government structures to look into the main parameters of 
Russia's political and military cooperation within the framework 
of the Partnership. It stands to reason that in its scope and 
dimension, Russia's partnership with NATO must be entirely 
different from that of other countries. The question is one of 
signing a special agreement with NATO as befits Russia's place 
and role in Europe and internationally and its military might 
and the status of a nuclear power. 
  Overall, we are not in a rush. We have held a series of 
consultations with CIS states and other countries are close to 
sign an outline document.

"Shakhray Satisfied With Memorandum on Accord"] 
  [Text] Sergey Shakhray has told your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent that he received the draft memorandum on civil 
accord drawn up by the presidential administration (during the 
drafting Shakhray himself supervised the work of a section that 
drew up the memorandum's provisions on interethnic and 
inter-regional relations). Shakhray said that he was completely 
satisfied with "the high quality of the document," but he had a 
number of proposals to make regarding the procedure of adopting 
it. Shakhray believes that the ratification of the document 
should not be rushed and that "it would be better to work on it 
for a month or two," than to have it signed by representatives 
of parties representing the same political spectrum. In 
Shakhray's view, "this slowness" in drawing up the document will 
enable, say, Anatoliy Lukyanov and his allies, "who are 
preparing their own draft document on civil accord," to join it. 
Shakhray thinks that the document should be passed to the State 
Duma, adopted by it as a law, and opened for new signatories. 
"Both Rybkin and Yeltsin ought to sign the memorandum not as 
citizens, but as statesmen," Shakhray said.

  [Text] As Interfax reported earlier, on Tuesday evening 
President Yeltsin sent copies of the draft agreement on civic 
peace to the potential signatories. 
  The only difference between that draft and the one prepared 
earlier was the absence of the provision on measures to increase 
wages in accordance with inflation and to ensure their timely 
payment, to check the rise in prices on staple food stuffs, to 
create jobs and to help the regions where the danger of 
unemployment is the greatest. 
  Head of the president's experts Aleksandr Livshyts told 
Interfax on Wednesday that such an amendment had been motivated 
by the need to scrupulously work out this provision. He said 
that the amendment did not mean Yeltsin denied the importance of 
those measures. He said, however, that the initial variant 
sounded rather abstract because it did not say who was 
responsible for implementing them. Livshyts believes that this 
drawback will be done away with in the final draft.

  [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- The State Duma's amnesty 
decision was not called in question either by the collegium of 
the procurator-general's office, or by its former head Aleksey 
Kazannik, because "the procurator's office is not a debating 
club, and its duty is to carry out the parliament's decisions." 
  Nevertheless, Kazannik told a meeting of the Council of the 
Federation here today that he had received a written instruction 
from the president not to carry out the amnesty. Considering 
that Kazannik, as he said, did not have any constitutional 
guarantees in the form of a decision of the Council of the 
Federation, appointing him to the post of procurator-general, he 
decided to resign and announced his decision during a press 
conference at the procurator- general's office on February 26. 
  Kazannik also said that he was asking nothing from the 
Council of the Federation and that he was "satisfied with the 
fact that the Council of the Federation was discussing this 
issue." 
  Kazannik told journalists during a break in the 
deliberations 
of the Council of the Federation, which is to pass a decision on 
the appointment of a procurator-general, that he was hatching 
plans to set up his own party, made up of law-abiding people. 
"If such a party is set up, I would prefer to call it a party 
of concord and national progress," Kazannik said. He told 
journalists also that he was receiving offers from Omsk, 
Yekaterinburg, and Novosibirsk to head various associations. 
Most of them came from intellectuals.

  [Text] "I hope to resume my duties as Russia's prosecutor 
general as the upper house of parliament did not accept my 
resignation," Aleksey Kazannik told Interfax in an interview he 
gave in a Moscow hotel. In his view, this decision made by the 
Federation Council "has not created any new realities or complex 
problems." 
  "I will work. What kind of problem can that be? Because the 
upper house did not endorse the presidential decree on my 
resignation, I remain Russia's prosecutor general and that is 
all there is to it. Under Article 102 of the Constitution this 
issue is to be decided by the upper house. I appreciate the 
Federation Council's respect for the Constitution and the Law. 
This will be the first swallow of the 'legal spring'," Kazannik 
said. 
  "I would have been grateful to the Federation Council even 
if 
it had accepted my resignation," Kazannik continued. "The very 
fact that this issue was discussed in parliament proves that our 
law makers respect the law and legality. People understood that 
it was impossible to live in a legal vacuum." 
  Kazannik said that "when the decision made by the Federation 
Council is formulated, this will be a legal act which cannot be 
resisted. In this way, there will be no question of Aleksey 
Ilyushenko staying in office as an acting prosecutor general." 
  Kazannik recalled that he had been dismissed from the 
prosecutor's office on February 15 by order of an acting 
prosecutor general. "I understood then that the situation was 
awkward and did not even withdraw my job records from the 
prosecutor general's office," he said. 
  "The upper house's decision changes my plans. Now I am not 
thinking of any political parties. I am sure that President 
Yeltsin and I will have good business relations in the framework 
of the Constitution of which he is the guarantor as head of the 
Russian state," Kazannik said. 
  He emphasized that he would concentrate on fighting crime 
when he resumed his duties.

  [Text] Moscow, 6 Apr -- A form of words releasing Aleksey 
Kazannik from the post of Russian procurator general has failed 
to gain a majority of votes. The chairman of the teller's 
commission reported that 68 deputies in the Federation Council 
voted in favor of releasing him, while 74 voted against. 
  According to the standing orders adopted today by the 
Federation Council, the procurator general is deemed to be 
released from his duties if a majority of the total number of 
deputies in the Federation Council votes in favor of that. The 
total number of deputies in the chamber is 174. Voting slips 
were taken by 145 people today. Therefore, over half of the 
total number of deputies did not vote in favor of releasing 
Kazannikov, the members of the teller's commission concluded. 
However, the chamber was unable today to formulate a legally 
satisfactory decision on the issue. It was decided to do that 
tomorrow. The sitting ended at that point.

  [Text] Literally a few minutes before the start of our 
program, the Information Television Agency received a statement 
issued by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, which expresses 
regret that the results of the voting in the Federation Council 
did not make it possible to adopt a final decision on the 
appointment of a procurator general. This outcome, the document 
says, does not mean that the former procurator general will 
return to his post; and thus Aleksey Ilyushenko will remain as 
acting procurator general. The president also considers that the 
Federation Council deputies who have been invested with the 
people's trust will find a suitable way out of the situation 
that has arisen.

  [Text] "Even if the Council of the Federation disagrees 
with the resignation of Aleksey Kazannik from the post of 
Prosecutor General, his duties will be performed by Aleksey 
Ilyushenko appointed to the post by President Yeltsin." This is 
the opinion of the official presidential representative in the 
Federal Assembly, the prominent lawyer Aleksandr Yakovlev. 
  On Wednesday he told Interfax that under the constitution 
the 
Council of the Federation appoints and dismisses the Prosecutor 
General but only candidates proposed by the president. 
Therefore, in Yakovlev's opinion, "common sense prompts that 
the council itself does not have the right to appoint anyone 
acting Prosecutor General, this remains the prerogative of the 
president." 
  Yakovlev recalled that Kazannik resigned of his own free 
will, not as a result of "any unlawful moves by the leadership, 
in this case the president." "Therefore in any case the duties 
of the Prosecutor General will be performed by the person 
appointed by the president," Yakovlev said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 7 TASS -- "Along with urging to step up 
anti-crime struggle, deputies to the Federation Council are 
actually creating obstacles for law-enforcement agencies, 
because in the current situation every lawyer may turn down any 
state prosecutor on the grounds that he was appointed by the 
prosecutor-general, not approved by the Federation Council," 
Georgiy Satarov, President Yeltsin's aide, told ITAR-TASS today. 
He commented on the desire of the upper chamber of the Russian 
parliament to set its resolution on the problem of the Russian 
prosecutor-general against the instructions of the head of state. 
  Satarov explained why Kazannik under no condition can come 
back to the post of prosecutor-general: "There is no legal act 
under which Kazannik could claim his previous post. He was not 
approved by the Federation Council on that post, and the 
president's decree on his resignation was the latest document. 
If the president removed Kazannik from his post by his own free 
will, the Federation Council would have the right to examine 
reasons for the decision taken by the head of state. However, 
Kazannik's resignation was voluntary, and the president only 
accepted it. According to the Constitution the head of state is 
the only one who has the right to submit to the Federation 
Council a candidature to the post of prosecutor-general." 
  President Yeltsin's aide stressed that the April 6 voting at 
the upper chamber of parliament over the acceptance or 
non-acceptance of Kazannik's resignation actually blocked a 
possibility of approving on that post of Aleksey Ilyushenko, 
whose candidature was suggested by the president, because the 
Federation Council linked the approval of the new 
prosecutor-general with the acceptance of the resignation of the 
previous one. 
  According to Satarov, Ilyushenko may be removed from 
discharging the duties of the prosecutor-general only if the 
president officially submits his candidature to the Federation 
Council, and the deputies reject it. Now, however, they cannot 
do it, because the resignation of Kazannik has not been accepted. 
  In his opinion, the only way out of this deadlock is to 
accept the resignation of Kazannik, thus paving the way for the 
functioning of constitutional mechanisms of the appointment of a 
new prosecutor- general. Until that time, "the contradiction 
between the old way of appointing a prosecutor-general and a 
principle of the new Russian Constitution, which cannot be 
settled by legal means, will continue to exist," Satarov said. 
It is not clear, however, whether or not the Federation Council 
will agree to hold another voting on this issue.

Procedure for the Entry Into Force of Federal Laws"; dated 
Moscow, 5 April 1994, and signed by Russian Federation President 
B. Yeltsin] 
  [Text] With a view to implementing the provisions of 
paragraph "e" of Article 84 of the Russian Federation 
Constitution, I decree: 
  1. Federal laws are subject to mandatory publication in the 
newly created information bulletin SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA 
ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII [Collection of Russian Federation 
Legislation]. Federal laws are also published in ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA and are passed on for entry into the data base of 
official legal documents maintained by the "Sistema" scientific 
and technical center for legal information. 
  2. Publication of federal laws in SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA 
ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII and in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA constitutes 
official publication. The texts of official laws distributed in 
machine-readable form by the "Sistema" scientific and technical 
center for legal information are also official. 
  Federal laws can also be published in other printed 
publications and promulgated via television and radio. 
  3. Federal laws enter into force throughout the territory of 
the Russian Federation 10 days after the day of their official 
publication. 
  The date of entry into force of federal laws indicated in 
this paragraph does not apply in instances when a federal law 
stipulates another date for its entry into force. 
  4. Federal laws adopted on matters concerning the 
ratification and denunciation of international treaties are also 
published in the BYULLETEN MEZHDUNARODNYKH DOGOVOROV [Bulletin 
of International Treaties]. 
  5. SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII is 
published weekly and consists of three sections: Federal laws 
are published in Section One, Russian Federation presidential 
edicts and directives in Section Two, and Russian Federation 
Government decrees and directives in Section Three. 
  Sections Two and three are subdivided into two parts: Part 
One contains statutory documents, Part Two contains documents of 
a nonstatutory nature. 
  6. Documents published in SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA 
ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII are placed in entries with corresponding 
sequential numbers. Appendixes to documents are placed in the 
same entries as the documents themselves. 
  7. Further to the Russian Federation President's Directive 
No. 428-rp of 8 August 1992, the duty of publishing and 
distributing SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII is 
placed on the Juridical Literature publishing house under the 
Russian President's Administration and -- in machine-readable 
form -- the "Sistema" scientific and technical center for legal 
information. 
  8. Further to the Russian Federation President's Edict No. 
363 of 4 April 1992 "On Amendments to the Statute on the 
State-Legal Administration of the Russian Federation President," 
the State-Legal Administration of the Russian Federation 
President is to be tasked with monitoring the correctness and 
timeliness of the publication of federal laws. 
  9. The Russian Federation President's Administration is to: 
  found the information bulletin SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA 
ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII instead of the information bulletin 
SOBRANIYE AKTOV PREZIDENTA I PRAVITELSTVA ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII 
[Collection of Russian Federation Presidential and Governmental 
Acts]; 
  approve the editorial council of the newly founded 
bulletin; 
  form an editorial staff for the said information bulletin 
within the structure of the Juridical Literature publishing 
house, making provision for a corresponding increase in the 
publishing house's regulation personnel strength; 
  resolve questions linked with the size of the print run 
and mandatory distribution of the information bulletin. 
  10. The Russian Federation President's Administration is to 
ensure the priority dispatch in full of federal laws and Russian 
presidential edicts and directives to the editorial office of 
the information bulletin SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA ROSSIYSKOY 
FEDERATSII and the "Sistema" scientific and technical center for 
legal information; the Russian Federation Government is to do 
likewise for Russian Federation Government decrees and 
directives. 
  11. The Russian Federation Government is to resolve within 
one month the question of printing facilities for the 
information bulletin SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA ROSSIYSKOY 
FEDERATSII, the allocation of the necessary quantity of paper, 
and also the financing of work to publish and distribute this 
bulletin in accordance with Paragraph 7 of this Edict. 
  12. The Russian Federation Ministry of Communications, 
jointly with the editorial staff of the information bulletin 
SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII, is to determine 
the conditions for the distribution of this publication taking 
account of the rights of 1994 subscribers to SOBRANIYE AKTOV 
PREZIDENTA I PRAVITELSTVA ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII. 
  The Federal Government Communications and Information Agency 
under the Russian Federation president is to determine within 
one month, by agreement with the State-Legal Administration of 
the Russian Federation President, the procedure and conditions 
for the distribution of SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA ROSSIYSKOY 
FEDERATSII in machine-readable form via the system of federal 
government communications and information agencies. 
  13. The Juridical Literature publishing house under the 
Russian Federation President's Administration is to ensure the 
publication through 1 May 1994 of Russian Federation 
presidential and governmental acts adopted through 30 April 1993 
in the SOBRANIYE AKTOV PREZIDENTA I PRAVITELSTVA ROSSIYSKOY 
FEDERATSII and thereupon cease its publication. 
  14. This Edict enters into forces from the moment it is 
published.

  [Text] One of the leaders of Russia's Choice, Boris 
Zolotukhin, said in an interview with Interfax that he has a 
high opinion of the draft agreement reached on Wednesday by the 
leaders of Russia's Choice and the unregistered deputy group 
December 12 Union about possible cooperation. December 12 Union 
is led by Former Vice- Premier and Finance Minister of the 
Russian Federation Boris Fedorov. 
  "We used to vote in the same way in the State Duma without 
previous discussion, but it would be very useful to work out a 
certain mechanism for coordination of positions on the most 
important issues," Zolotukhin pointed out. He believes that 
regular meetings of these deputy groups could become such a 
mechanism for coordination of actions prior to taking important 
decisions in the Duma. 
  Asked by IF's correspondent, Zolotukhin said that similar 
talks with leaders of the Yavlinskiy faction were in their 
preliminary stages. Interfax learned that Russia's Choice will 
be represented by Boris Zolotukhin, the Yavlinskiy bloc Viktor 
Sheynis and December 12 Union by Boris Zamay. A final decision 
on the issue will be taken by Russia's Choice at its meeting on 
April 7.

  [Text] A deputy of the State Duma, Viktor Kobelev, who 
withdrew from the parliamentary faction of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) promised to "destroy" the 
party leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, both as a personality and a 
politician if he continued to use personal insults and libel "as 
the main means for the destruction of his enemies." 
  "I have arguments which allow me to say this," he told a 
news 
conference in Moscow Wednesday. Kobelev, until recently the 
second party leader after Zhirinovskiy, made it clear that the 
arguments related to the financing of the LDPR election campaign. 
  On the eve of the LDPR congress on April 2, Kobelev and two 
more deputies of the same faction, Aleksandr Pronin and 
Vyacheslav Marychev, received telegrams saying that they had 
been expelled from the party and that they could not participate 
in the congress. 
  Another deputy who claimed he withdrew from the party 
faction 
Wednesday, said his step had been provoked by Zhirinovskiy 
himself. Vladimir Borzyuk, the head of the LDPR Orel branch, was 
quoted as saying that he could serve, but not be servile. Still 
another deputy, head of the LDPR branch in Udmurtia, Vladimir 
Novikov, officially announced Wednesday he was withdrawing from 
Zhirinovskiy's faction. The deputies said they still supported 
the LDPR program and charter and considered themselves members 
of the LDPR. 
  Kobelev said they will be followed by other LDPR deputies 
who 
may hold an LDPR congress of their own once they constitute a 
sufficient number. At the same time, Kobelev said it would be 
difficult to work in the parliament outside the faction. He did 
not preclude joining some other faction or deputies' group in 
the State Duma. Among them, he indicated the nationalist 
patriotic Russian Way led by Sergey Baburin and Anatoliy 
Lukyanov, liberal reformist Union of December 12 headed by Boris 
Fedorov, Sergei Shakhray's Party for Russian Unity and Concord 
and the deputies' group New Regional Policy led by Vladimir 
Medvedev.

<F P=106> [Boris Sherman report under the "Warning" rubric: "Agrarian </F>
Faction Leaders Threaten Peasants Strike and Ask Presidential 
Administration Not To Distract Collective Farm Workers From 
Applying Fertilizers"] 
  [Text] A group of leaders of the State Duma's Agrarian 
Party of Russia [APR] faction held a press conference yesterday, 
"On the Disastrous Consequences of the Administrative 
De-Collectivization of Peasants' Farms." The agrarians made a 
series of revealing statements and showed the audience (made up 
primarily of their own faction's deputies, who obligingly 
ensured a quorum at an event organized by their bosses) 
presidential draft edicts "On the Reorganization of Agricultural 
Enterprises..." and "On the Procedure for Reorganizing and 
Downsizing Agricultural Enterprises and Privatizing Land and 
Other Property," and also an analytical memo signed by Petr 
Filippov "On the Urgent Need To Split Joint-Stock Companies and 
Collective Farms into Small Collective Peasants' Farms Before 
Spring Seeding Time." 
  "The Agrarian Party opposes any forcible actions against the 
peasants by the state," APR leader Mikhail Lapshin said, warning 
that "carrying out reform by old, administrative methods from 
above, reform that leads to the fragmentation of collective 
farms into small farms, is particularly dangerous precisely on 
the eve of seeding time," because "it will keep collective farm 
workers under strain" and distract them "from applying 
fertilizers to cereals." 
  In the view of the faction leaders, this coercion was 
spearheaded by the presidential administration and its chief, 
Sergey Filatov, in person. Complaining against him also as the 
mastermind behind the compilation of a "blacklist" of former 
Russian Federation Supreme Soviet deputies who were reported to 
be sympathizing with anti- presidential forces, Mr. Lapshin 
wondered aloud, "Why is it that one and the same building sends 
appeals for civil accord alongside with documents that may 
literally blow up society." 
  Mikhail Lapshin acknowledged that under the circumstances he 
"does not see a place for the peasantry's signature" under the 
Kremlin-proposed accord on civil peace. Moreover, in his 
opinion, "it cannot be ruled out that in mid- or late June the 
Russian peasantry may rise with the sole demand that this 
government should go."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Barsukov] </F>
  [Text] Washington April 7 TASS -- Russian communist leader 
Gennadiy Zyuganov said his party and its allies would do 
everything to achieve national reconciliation and accord in 
Russia. He stressed that it is impossible to stabilise the 
situation in the country without it, he said. 
  Zyuganov noted that, during his latest meetings with 
high-ranking representatives of the administration, he had got 
an impression that the U.S. leadership realised Russia's 
problems and a new policy toward Russia was needed. At the same 
time, the administration underestimates the processes underway 
in Russia, he said. 
  According to Zyuganov, "the situation in Russia is going 
from 
bad to worse as before". The state has become a "communicating 
court" and does not fulfil its functions. The crime rate has 
reached the scale of the post-civil-war period. The power is 
concentrated in the hands of one man, the Russian president, 
whose powers are four times as much as the U.S. President has. 
It lets those who have no powers and play a role of "collective 
baron" "conduct the Russian civil strife". The situation in 
many important spheres in the country is critical. Even missile 
systems do not undergo some necessary operations in time, he 
said. 
  According to the Russian communist leader, any democracy is 
out of the question if there is no bread, water and heating. 
The stabilisation of the situation is the main task requiring 
coordinated efforts, of the international community in 
particular. The further confrontation in Russia will lead to a 
national tragedy. 
  Zyuganov noted that a rather big central-leftist bloc had 
formed in the State Duma which can propose its own programme to 
overcome the crisis in the country.

<F P=106> [Andrey Bagrov report: "Oleg Soskovets Versus SEGODNYA. </F>
First Vice Premier Works as Usual"] 
  [Text] Responding to accusations that First Vice Premier 
Oleg Soskovets had unlawfully bought shares in the Novosibirsk 
tin combine, members of his staff stated yesterday that there is 
no documentary evidence of the charges. In the meantime some 
versions of the appearance of the scandalous information have 
been put forward in government circles. 
  The crux of SEGODNYA's charge against Oleg Soskovets is that 
he allegedly bought shares in the Novosibirsk tin combine which 
are distributed through private subscription. Not being a 
member of the work collective, the vice premier had no right to 
make such a purchase. 
  Yesterday, members of the first vice premier's staff stated 
to a SEGODNYA correspondent that there is no documentary 
confirmation of the fact that shares were bought and that Oleg 
Soskovets has absolutely nothing to do with this affair. 
According to the vice premier's aides, he reacted quite calmly 
to the publication and continues to work "as usual." 
  From the cautious remarks by members of the government 
apparatus, one can put together two versions of the appearance 
of the publication against the vice premier. The first is that 
the publication had been inspired by a side that had suffered in 
some scandal between the tin combine's shareholders. Some 
staffers of the Russian Federation Metallurgy Committee cashed 
in on this dissatisfaction in order to take vengeance on their 
former chief. 
  The second version has to do with the struggle between 
various conceptions of the post-voucher privatization in Russia. 
In this case, charges against Soskovets, according to a theory, 
have primarily a political-economic meaning: They are aimed at 
weakening the first deputy premier's influence in the final 
stage of check privatization and at decreasing his activism in 
working out strategy of the next stage. 
  By the way, the Magnitogorsk metallurgical combine is 
supposed to become a proving ground for privatization methods 
not controlled by Anatoliy Chubays.

Yeltsin signed a decree on Wednesday obliging the government to 
submit a draft law on the basic principles of obligatory 
insurance in Russia to the State Duma by September 1, 1994. The 
draft law will have to define the concept of obligatory 
insurance and its goals. The cabinet has also been instructed 
to prepare and submit draft laws on the procedure for and terms 
of specific forms of obligatory insurance. 
  The move aims at ensuring civil liberties and rights granted

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- Russian counterintelligence 
officers have arrested a defence industry employee who tried to 
trade state secrets to foreigners, said Boris Miroshnikov, 
deputy head of the counterintelligence operations department of 
the Russian Counterintelligence Service. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Miroshnikov 
said 
that the number of such cases has grown lately. People offering 
"spy service" to foreigners justify their behaviour by their 
"desire to be paid according to their intellect." 
  Miroshnikov expressed concern about the fact that foreign 
intelligence services have stepped up their activity in Russia 
under the cover of various foundations and joint ventures. 
Russian business people and industrialists seeking credits or 
equipment for their businesses sometimes sell secrets to foreign 
emissaries or those who act legally and openly under the cover 
of firms and companies, he said. 
  Taking advantage of Russia's weakened administrative and 
legal system, foreign spies penetrate all spheres of activity. 
Their neutralisation forces Russia's counterintelligence to 
look for new ways and methods of intelligence warfare and to 
conduct systematic analytical work. 
  The situation is compounded by the fact that foreign states 
have set up intelligence centres in some republics of the former 
Soviet Union and, in fact, have taken over the local 
intelligence services. They wage active intelligence work 
against Russia, using politically unstable areas, trouble spots, 
the Islamic factor and aggressive nationalism, Miroshnikov 
concluded.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Petrovich Bykov, deputy director of </F>
the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service, by Ye. 
Golubeva; under the "Dossier" rubric of the "Utro" program; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] This is the first time a scientific and practical 
conference being held in our country on individual, public, and 
state security and the Russian special services is open to the 
press. A speech by Sergey Stepashin, director of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS], made it clear the FCS has 
completed its reform for the time being and has begun 
functioning. The FCS's role must grow in combating organized 
crime and its politization, terrorism, and political extremism. 
Apart from purely counterintelligence activities, also put 
forth were the goals of protecting state and commercial secrets 
as well as a certain amount of protection for private 
enterprises participating in the national economy. By the way, 
a representative of the Foreign Intelligence Service announced 
that the question was being examined of channeling information 
beneficial for the country's economy to commercial structures. 
  A concept of national security has not been formed in our 
country. While the national interests of the USSR were often 
obstructed, whether as a concession to its allies' interests or 
in order to fight its opponents, today Russia can have both 
allies, competitors, and opponents. However, our national 
interests must be free from ideology. Today there is an opinion 
in the West that Russia cannot undertake peacekeeping missions 
in conflict zones bordering the territory of the CIS; supposedly 
this will be indicative of imperial deportment. However, Russia 
is a member of the UN and can carry out this mission under UN 
aegis. Second, who outlines the limits of the United States' 
national interests? However, this is rhetorical. Let us talk 
about individual security with Andrey Petrovich Bykov, deputy 
director of the Russian FCS. By the way, confidential sources 
told me that Andrey Petrovich, who is a doctor of technical 
sciences, is also one of the leading experts on defusing 
homemade, non-standard explosive devices of previously unknown 
configurations. 
  [Begin recording] [Golubeva] The subject is individual, 
public, and state security and the special services. For the 
first time, the individual is placed at the forefront . 
  [Bykov] That is because while we have always discussed state 
security as a conceptual problem of guaranteeing the security of 
the Soviet Union, today, as we shift to the building of a new 
rule-of- law democratic society, and since we are about to join 
the world community, we all must observe world standards; that 
includes the special services. All international documents, as 
well as the human rights declaration, view individual security 
as the first priority. It is not completely understood yet how 
individual security can be achieved in our changing state. 
  [Golubeva] What is your opinion? 
  [Bykov] I cannot fully answer this question either. It is 
precisely the goal of today's conference to develop conceptual 
and pragmatic approaches to the everyday activities of the 
special services--and the FCS among them--which would allow us 
to solve this problem of individual, public, and state security 
and the legal activity of the Russian special services. We can 
issue statements on guaranteeing individual security, but we 
still have not developed the mechanism for it. After all, there 
are a lot of problems here-- information, personal, physical, 
and economic security of the individual. There are no legal 
documents today which would fully define the aspects of this 
huge problem, which is not only a state problem but one of the 
individual and society, of every one of us. Using a rather 
vulgar expression, I would even call it street security, among 
other things. 
  [Golubeva] How long will it take to develop the mechanisms 
for protecting the individual in our society? 
  [Bykov] I am a very pragmatic person, so I will refrain from 
categorical prognosis because the country's situation today is 
fairly unstable; the financial, banking, and credit system is 
very unbalanced; and these issues determine to a large extent 
the implementation of all the prerequisites, without which it is 
impossible to talk about personal security. 
  [Golubeva] Are positive relations emerging today between the 
FCS and the government and deputies? 
  [Bykov] The government, State Duma, and Federal Assembly 
reachs an understanding on all principle questions. The same 
applies to the government structure and the president's 
administration. We are corrected on certain issues. This is 
probably an inevitable process, and reaching an accord is always 
a result of work achieved by both sides. 
  [Golubeva] Do you have the right to make corrections? 
  [Bykov] Well, we present our proposals. 
  [Golubeva] Can you confirm these numbers: There were 
135,000 staffers in the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
until the last reform; there are 75,000 today. 
  [Bykov] Yes, that is correct. 
  [Golubeva] Has there been any change in relations between 
the Russian and U.S. special services following the Ames affair? 
  [Bykov] We have witnessed no changes yet in those areas in 
which we cooperate with the U.S. special services. Our contacts 
in fighting international terrorism, the drug trade, and the 
arms trade continue at the same level as before. After all, we 
cooperate with the German special services even though we 
recently exposed their agent. There is no contradiction. 
  [Golubeva] Is there any hope the names of the 20 identified 
spies who worked against Russia will be made known to the public? 
  [Bykov] When the situation is ripe, we will relate it all in 
detail. You understand, they did not work in a vacuum, and 
every case branches off extensively, so it is not proper to tell 
everything at once. 
  [Golubeva] My "Dossier" rubric features six of them; 14 
remain. 
  [Bykov] The time will probably come when all 14 of them 
feature in your file. 
  [Golubeva] Thank you. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Andrey Stepanov report: "The Deputies Have Found a Field </F>
of Miracles (reference to a popular TV quiz program of the same 
name). Now They Only Have To Find the Fools"] 
  [Text] Some citizens think in vain that they can escape 
the consequences of the deputies' activity in their homes. The 
State Duma has already decided on a master plan to stir the 
Fatherland. A law has been drafted whereby the deputies and 
their brothers from the upper chamber of parliament can stay on 
TV screens practically for an unlimited time. 
  This draft can satisfy the most fastidious deputies' tastes. 
For instance, it forbids news programs (ITA, Vesti, Inform-TV) 
to comment on events that have happened in the upper echelons of 
power. News bulletins, regardless of their duration, must 
contain information about absolutely all developments in the 
three branches of state power (Articles 6 and 7). But this is 
not all: Article 9 defines who a news or other (!) program 
journalist may interview, as well as the minimum length of a 
parliamentary report in TV news broadcasts. 
  Yet this part of the brilliant document contains one obvious 
slip: It does not specify which questions journalists may put 
to their interlocutors. The draft contains numerous 
absurdities; for instance, presidential statements may be 
broadcast only with the permission of unspecified "federal power 
bodies" (Article 6, Section 2), while the responsibility for 
disseminating statements by top statesmen is imposed on 
journalists. Although experience shows that this process rather 
depends on the mood of communication workers, power supply 
operators, and so forth. 
  If the draft comprised only the above, it could be taken for 
a toast because its main essence boils down to the fact that 
journalists must provide still better coverage of what they are 
covering already. Nonetheless, the draft includes two more 
types of articles. 
  The press must be delighted with the provisions of Article 
4, 
Section 1, promising to wrest ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI and ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA from Viktor Chernomyrdin's control and launch them along 
the waves of the free market. In addition, the draft promises 
that no officials will be exerting pressure on correspondents, 
and audio and video recordings may be made wherever permitted by 
accreditation rules. 
  The president, by the authors' logic, should gratefully 
support the draft because the deputies, in corresponding 
articles, make believe that they are equally concerned about all 
the branches of power. A careful comparison of the "powers," 
however, fatefully proves to be not in favor of the head of 
state. Under the draft, acts of amnesty adopted by the lower 
chamber of parliament or laws passed by both chambers are 
subject to immediate promulgation. As for the president's 
signing a federal law (whereupon a legislative act comes into 
force), an edict, or an act of pardon, or presentation of 
Russian Federation state awards, and so forth, this should not 
be announced to the citizens. Incidentally, the same kind of 
treatment has been meted out to the judicial branch. To top it 
all: even the mention of the president has been expunged from 
an article on obligatory analytical programs which, by the way, 
are to be inserted into the broadcasting schedule only at the 
discretion of the parliamentary press service. But this must be 
for considerations of economy. 
  And finally, yet another peculiarity. The draft speaks in 
detail about the various types of regular programs on Ostankino, 
Russian, and St. Petersburg TV in which deputies will appear in 
groups or alone. These articles provide for everything except 
the source of financing and, most important, the total air time 
limit that the deputies may claim without cost.

  [Text] Moscow April 7 TASS -- Viktor Linnik, former 
editor-in-chief of the PRAVDA daily, was reinstated in his post 
on Wednesday following a court inquiry. Under the resolution 
passed by the court, Linnik will receive his salary for two 
months during which he was compelled to stay away from work and 
an administrative sanction against him will be lifted. 
  A conflict in the editorial office of the PRAVDA daily 
flared 
up following claims made by Greek partners to founder's rights, 
trade mark and property of the newspaper. Linnik shares the 
position of part of newspaper workers who believe that any 
encroachments on the oldest Russian newspaper are inadmissible. 
The court ruled that a decision to dismiss Linnik was adopted 
at a meeting of journalists in the absence of quorum and 
overruled the decision as invalid. 
  Another court inquiry will be held to establish whether 
Greek 
claims are legitimate.

articles.

"Mysteries of Kremlin" by former Soviet mp Iona Andronov in the 
newspaper "ZAVTRA" (TOMORROW), the successor to the notorious 
"DEN", presented a violation of "the law on the press". 
  The court stated that in accordance with the law the 
government is entitled to issue a corresponding officiial 
warning to the newspaper. Two such warnings within one year are 
enough to close the periodical. 
  The court stated that the publication was "based on absurd 
conjectures" and qualified it as aimed to "destabilize the 
situation in Russia and bar the signing of the memorandum on 
civic peace". 
  The published extracts from the novel by an ardent Yeltsin's 
foe alongside with bitter criticism against the Russian 
president, concentrated on the most delicate theme of the 
present political situation -- the state of health of the 
Russian number one.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Auditors Have Done Their </F>
Calculations. Who Will Shed A Tear?" -- from the "IZVESTIYA-TV" 
section] 
  [Text] In January it became known that the Control 
Administration of the Russian president's administration had 
began an audit of "Ostankino's" financial and economic activity. 
  The presumption of innocence (a sacred juridical principle) 
was crushed by rumors, malicious gossip, and verbal and printed 
extrapolation of the repeatedly surfacing individual criminal 
and semicriminal episodes in "Ostankino's" history. 
  In its very first edition "IZVESTIYA-TV" -- although without 
specific names, with approximate figures, and anonymously (for 
which we were, perhaps fairly, censured) -- peppered the Russian 
State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company ["Ostankino"] 
with accusations of virtually total corruption. 
  Without the slightest hint of malice, we note that the 
rumors, the major premises of the article "`Ostankino': 
Everything for Sale," and the warnings of experts have proved 
to be not without basis. The high-quality and thorough audit 
has revealed violations and has unambiguously exposed financial 
machinations and "slip-ups" reflected in "Ostankino's" losses, 
which run into millions and billions of rubles [R]. Here are 
just a few figures and statistics from the extensive 
documentation on the results of the audit. 
  In 1993 R441 million worth of unpaid advertising was 
broadcast by just five studios. Overall last year the company 
should have received -- according to expert assessments -- at 
least R60 billion from advertising, but received just R11.2 
billion. 
  "Ostankino" concluded contracts that were known to be 
unprofitable with the "Inmac" Joint-Stock Company and a number 
of Western firms (here Yu. Bandura, "Ostankino's" former deputy 
chairman, especially distinguished himself). Manipulations 
manifestly far from altruistic were exposed, involving 
advertising time in the "Aleskandr-shou" program, broadcast 16 
January this year. "Ostankino's" leaders conducted business 
with excessive loyalty -- and clearly to the detriment of the 
company's own interests -- with the "Premyer SV" advertising 
agency, which will cost the company R12.3 billion. 
  In 1993 the volume of broadcasting was reduced by almost 
one-third by comparison with 1991, but the number of studio 
personnel by only 17 percent. And this, while the quality of 
programs fell and in the midst of a financial crisis. 
  Over the past two years "Ostankino" has lost many buildings 
and much equipment, and most importantly of all, the Television 
Technical Center. But perhaps the most terrible loss is its 
loss of prestige, its good reputation in the eyes of the public 
and millions of viewers. 
  We do not know what administrative and juridical measures 
will be taken, but it will be very difficult to recoup the moral 
and professional losses suffered.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Moscow Air Defense District </F>
Command Holds Open Day at Secret Facility"] 
  [Text] The Moscow Air Defense District's main command post 
is situated among new buildings in Moscow's residential district 
of Anino. Quite recently it was a facility surrounded by barbed 
wire, which even some of the commander's deputies were 
prohibited from entering. But after it was visited by the U.S. 
secretary of defense and by FRG, Chinese, Indian, and North 
Korean delegation heads, it was the turn of journalists. 
Admittedly, Russian journalists, not foreign journalists 
contrary to the present tradition. 
  What is the Moscow Air Defense District command post? The 
three-story bunker buried 20 meters in the ground with a 
two-story building on top resembles an officers' club. The 
command post can withstand a direct hit by an atom bomb, and can 
operate on stand-alone for 10 days without depending on the 
city's electricity and water supply networks. 
  According to Lieutenant General Pavel Kuznetsov, Moscow Air 
Defense District chief of staff, the district monitors an air 
space of 1.3 million square km, the territory of 24 Russian 
oblasts, the district's 4,000-km border, and over 140 highly 
important military-state command and control and economic 
facilities, including those where there is a danger of 
radiation. There are eight of them -- nuclear electric power 
stations. It can track and fire on 500 targets in flight at 
once. 
  Although during a conversation with journalists Colonel 
General Anatoliy Kornukov, commander of the Moscow Air Defense 
District, attributed the unusual openness of the district's 
secret installations to the military's sincere desire not to 
keep secrets from their people where there should be none and to 
the traditional meetings with the public on the eve of Air 
Defense Day, there is another reason for the journalists 
visiting the main command post. There has been talk that air 
defense is unnecessary and of the need to cut the already small 
military budget by disbanding the Air Defense Forces. 
  Gen. Korunkov said that no one has any intention of 
disbanding the Air Defense Forces. Strangely enough, it is far 
cheaper to keep them in a state of high combat readiness today 
than to cut them, and the need for them still exists.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Viktor Samoylov, general </F>
director of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, by Lada 
Lyashenko; place, date not given: "Peddling Military Goods"] 
  [Text] Last November the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company 
for the import and export of arms and military hardware was set 
up in accordance with a presidential edict. Our correspondent 
discussed the aims and tasks of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State 
Company with Lieutenant General Viktor Samoylov, general 
director of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company. 
  [Lyashenko] Viktor Ivanovich, what prompted the idea to set 
up this new arms import and export company? 
  [Samoylov] All these organizations [not further identified] 
were simply duplicating each other. The new state company is 
leaving the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations structure, 
but is nonetheless the successor to the organizations you have 
listed. Previously, under the rigid system for managing economic 
activity, foreign exchange revenue from weapons sales was 
distributed by the state itself. The situation then changed, 
enterprises were being floated, and they began acquiring their 
own economic interests. The process of producers entering the 
foreign market began to snowball. 
  But how could this be done without knowing the basic rules 
adopted in the world of the arms trade, without having any idea 
about pricing conditions, the system of credit provision, and 
much else besides -- quite apart from the fact that the arms 
trade business, as a rule, is strictly secret and foreigners are 
not privy to these secrets? But this was not all. Often the 
interests of such businessmen overlap with the interests of our 
state, and buyers played them off against each other in order to 
knock down the price of military goods. Just imagine the 
picture of the Bangladeshi or Malaysian defense ministers, who 
were visited by 24 Russian representatives in the space of a 
year, each claiming the exclusive right to supply Russian 
weapons. 
  [Lyashenko] What specifically will "Rosvooruzheniye" be 
doing? 
  [Samoylov] Primarily, importing and exporting all sorts of 
weapons and military hardware, military property, and 
strategically important raw materials. We are beginning to 
operate in the world market as a powerful financial and 
industrial group with excellent professionals who know not only 
about military hardware but also about economics and marketing 
-- in other words, the entire arms trade mechanism. 
  One fundamentally new task is to invest our own funds and 
those of others in defense-sector enterprises. Organizing our 
work with them on a contractual basis, our company plans to use 
state and commercial credits to develop and produce primarily 
weapons types and military hardware that will be competitive on 
the world market. 
  The largest military-industrial complex enterprises will 
continue to take part in foreign economic activity under 
agreements with "Rosvooruzheniye." 
  [Lyashenko] How will the income be shared out between those 
taking part in the production and sale of military products? 
  [Samoylov] We are developing this mechanism. But, for 
instance, in the United States the bulk of the money raised from 
arms sales goes to reduce the burden of defense expenditure and 
to subsidize defense production. It resolves the problems of 
restructuring the defense complex. 
  [Lyashenko] Viktor Ivanovich, in restructuring the arms 
trade like this, will we not be losing our old and pretty good 
ties on the world market? 
  [Samoylov] "Rosvooruzheniye" has made a very cautious entry 
into the market. The arms trade is a relatively long process -- 
it is not the same as pumping oil down a pipeline. After all, 
the partner state buying our weapons also has to make a 
government-level decision and allocate budget appropriations. 
And it is very difficult to make such important decisions in a 
democratic state with its multiparty system and different views, 
whereby you sometimes need a virtually nationwide referendum to 
decide whether to buy our MiG's or a U.S. aircraft. That is why 
the people representing the vendor country are exceptionally 
important to the purchaser country. And we are doing everything 
to ensure that Russia's prestige in this area is not damaged.

<F P=106> [RIA report under the "In Brief" rubric: "Russian Arms </F>
Export Up"] 
  [Text] The export of Russian arms and military hardware in 
1993 was up 11.7 percent, standing at $2.15 billion. 
Interestingly, the share of products intended for export 
amounted to as little as 5.2 percent of the arms manufactured. 
This was announced by Viktor Glukhikh, chairman of the Russian 
State Committee on the Defense Industry. He admitted that the 
number of arms importing countries had fallen to 26, that is to 
half of what it was at the time of the former USSR in 1990. 
Importantly, Russia has virtually lost an arms market in the 
Baltics, where arms now come from Israel. According to him, 
Moldavia [Moldova] is increasingly orienting itself in its 
imports policy toward Romania, while arms suppliers in China, 
Iran, and Turkey are actively working in the newly formed states 
of Central Asia. 
  Still, Glukhikh thinks that the CIS market should be a 
priority for Russia. There is a considerable quantity of 
weapons there created on the basis of the former Soviet 
standards and arms systems which are being produced in Russia. 
To boost arms exports, the head of the State Committee on the 
Defense Industry thinks, one should arrange for supplies of 
spare parts for military hardware, servicing, repairs, and 
modernization of armaments delivered. These problems will be 
tackled as a package by the recently created "Rosvooruzheniye" 
state company.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Hold the Front Page!" </F>
rubric: "They Beat Our Army on All Fronts"] 
  [Text] The heads of interested ministries have submitted 
their proposals for the next Council of Ministers session, which 
will look at benefits for servicemen. 
  To all appearances, officers and retired servicemen of the 
armed forces will have to part with many benefits. In his 
letter to Chernomyrdin, Deputy Finance Minister Astakhov 
proposes that servicemen be deprived of free medical service 
(that is to say, the network of military outpatient hospitals 
should be closed down), and that compensation for treatment at 
sanatoriums and health resorts and transport fares be abolished. 
At the same time, Astakhov proposes that staffers of the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs entitled to 
retirement pensions but continuing to serve should receive 
additionally an average of 75,000 rubles each. 
  Deputy Minister of Economy Mikhaylov, responding to the same 
request, thinks that benefits for servicemen cannot be available 
in 1994, and he suggests that federal budget possibilities be 
studied once again. Deputy Social Protection Minister Kisilev 
writes to Chernomyrdin that their agency is against the 
mandatory state insurance of servicemen's property, and for 
abolishing reduced prices in trade outlets for military 
personnel. 
  The Finance Ministry also insists that even if servicemen 
are 
to keep their benefits, it should only be done from the Defense 
Ministry's own budget -- which has been considerably reduced 
through the efforts of this same Finance Ministry.

<F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded; from the </F>
"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Experts are already worried about 
the situation on Russian nuclear power stations. For example, 
it has become perfectly clear that the security system for 
strategic sites, which include nuclear power stations, will have 
to be completely rebuilt. Special services employees say that 
since the Ministry of Internal Affairs took over the command of 
the special group Vympel, which specializes in preventing any 
terrorist threat, this subunit has practically ceased to exist 
and there is no one to defend nuclear sites. 
  At the same time there is also many other problems. The 
state owes half a trillion rubles to employees of nuclear 
stations. This has forced them to send picketers to Moscow. 
The leadership of the nuclear industry trade unions says that 
nuclear power stations are experiencing difficulties not only 
with wages: 
  [I. Fomichev, deputy chairman of the Central Committee of 
the 
Nuclear Industry Trade Union] "There is enough fuel for about a 
month." 
  [Correspondent] A threat of stoppages by nuclear power 
stations means not only a loss of 12 percent of electric energy. 
For regions like Chukotka this is a question of life and death. 
Only a law prohibiting strikes on strategic sites stops 
employees of nuclear power stations from going on strike. 
However, new demands have come from provinces on the last day 
of authorized pickets of state institutions in Moscow. 
  [Fomichev] "Unfortunately, because the government continues 
to ignore our problems, the workforce is beginning to put 
forward political demands. Unfortunately the people we voted 
for, the people whose responsibility is to solve these problems, 
are not doing it."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Marina Barinova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- All Russian nuclear power 
stations now face stoppages. Because of various faults nuclear 
reactors at many of them do not operate to full capacity. In 
addition to technical reasons, the work of nine Russian nuclear 
power stations is affected by huge indebtedness to them by 
consumers. It amounts now to over 600 billion roubles. 
Observers believe this urges operators to protest actions such 
as the picketing of the government building conducted today. 
Because of the lack of funds, nuclear fuel cannot be bought. 
Prophylactic work cannot be done on time. Planned recharging 
of reactors with fuel is skipped. So nuclear power plants in 
Russia may turn out of energy producers into major energy 
consumers. 
  Social tension is heightening among the personnel of nuclear 
power plants. Wages have not been paid to them for three of 
four months. Nuclear power plant operators have to resort to 
extreme measures. Five operators of the Kursk nuclear power 
station were recently fasting in protest against non-payment of 
wages. Despite the government decision to conclude collective 
agreements with workers in nuclear power, such an agreement was 
concluded with the personnel of only one of the nine stations, 
the Beloyarsk nuclear power plant. 
  The coordination council for joint actions formed by trade 
unions of nuclear power sent an address to the Russian 
president, government and parliament. The address pointed to 
the need to stabilise the financial situation in the region. 
  So far all Russian nuclear power stations have to work in a 
regime on strict economy. Because of this their output dropped 
by half.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Galkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- Parliamentary hearings on 
the draft law "on 1994 federal budget" was held today at the 
Russian State Duma. First Deputy Russian Minister of Finance 
Vladimir Petrov tried to convince the deputies that the draft 
will help to overcome the economic crisis and start economic 
revival. 
  Petrov described the budget to include 120,000,000,000,000 
rubles worth of revenues and 62,400,000,000,000 rubles worth of 
deficit as realistic and the only correct from among all the 
suggested drafts. The budget is expected to cut the inflation to 
monthly seven-eight per cent at the year end and halve credit 
emission as compared to 1993. 
  Many spending items, including social needs, will remain at 
the 1993 level as compared to the gross domestic product. The 
defence spending is expected to reach 37,100,000,000,000 rubles 
or 5.1 per cent of the gross domestic product. 
  Some 5,000,000,000,000 rubles will be spend on state 
management bodies, which is more than last year. "We came to 
conclusion that the validity of the presidential decree on civil 
service shall be suspended till 1995. The decree's 
implementation would mean 11,000,000,000,000 rubles worth of 
spending on the state machinery," said petrov. 
  The draft budget takes into account the moratorium on 
increased salaries in budget-financed spheres in the second 
quarter of 1994, which would require additional 
2,000,000,000,000 rubles. The government thinks it should 
fulfill all of its previous promises and then start further 
indexation of salaries with due account of the state financial 
position. 
  The first quarter of 1993 brought 8,400,000,000,000 rubles 
worth of revenues to the budget, which is less than it was 
planned. A reason for this is that a number of territories, 
primarily Bashkortostan and the Republic of Sakha dodged the 
payment of taxes to the federal budget. Negotiations with their 
leadership is underway to settle the problem. The first 
quarter's spending amounted to 17,200,000,000,000 rubles.

  [Text] The memorandum on the economic policy of the Russian 
Government and the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is nearly ready 
for signing. The basic indices of this document which will have 
to be sent to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have been 
agreed, CBR Board Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko told INTERFAX. 
He thought that the memorandum could be sent to the IMF before 
the Russian parliament approves the 1994 budget. 
  After analyzing the memorandum the IMF ruling body will 
decide on making the second part, worth $1.5 Bn, of the systemic 
credit available to Moscow. 
  Gerashchenko thought that Russia would have that amount as 
early as in May. The credit will be used to offset the budget 
deficit which is expected to be 62.4 Tn rubles. The credit will 
be distributed through the Russian interbank market.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "FITUR Urges People To Form Columns"] </F>
  [Text] May Day -- the day of working people's solidarity -- 
is approaching. We are greeting it at a difficult time for 
Russia. The overwhelming majority of working people, an appeal 
by the FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia] 
to the country's trade union organizations and labor collectives 
says, are concerned at the unstable socioeconomic and political 
situation, the wholesale slump in production, and the growing 
unemployment. Voices are being heard increasingly loudly 
protesting at the improverishment of vast sections of the 
population and at the very flagrant violation of people's 
constitutional rights in view of the failure to pay wages for 
many months, the reduction of social programs, and the rampant 
crime. 
  The president, parliament, government, and various 
sociopolitical forces are calling for the attainment of 
universal civil accord in Russia as the chief condition for 
extricating the country from the profound economic and social 
crisis. The FITUR supports the idea of civil peace, the appeal 
states, seeing this as a real way to resolve very acute social 
problems. At the same time, expressing the will of working 
people, we demand the adoption of urgent measures to ensure: 
  the ending of the production slump, support for Russian 
entrepreneurship, and the resolution of problems of reciprocal 
nonpayments; 
  guarantees of the full and timely payment of wages; 
  the adoption of a state employment program to avert the 
threat of mass unemployment; 
  citizens' security on a firm legislative basis. 
  The FITUR urges working people actively to support these 
demands and to display the solidarity of working people in the 
struggle for their rights by participating in the May Day events.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Liliya Kuznetsova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 6 Apr -- To stop the increase in the number 
of people in Russia who find themselves beyond the poverty line 
-- this is the main objective of the state social policy in 
1994. Yuriy Yarov, deputy chairman of the Russian Government, 
said this today at a meeting between heads of ministries and 
services of the social bloc and journalists. 
  In his opinion, the fight against hyperinflation and social 
stabilization in society should not be set against each other; 
one should not put financial interests above those common to all 
people, while at the same time one should not forget that 
people's lives cannot be improved without improving the economy 
and reducing inflationary processes. 
  The social policy, Yuriy Yarov said, is the first to be 
affected by a fall in production. Reduced budget revenues have 
resulted in a situation whereby the Finance Ministry's debt to 
the social sphere in 1993 amounted to 228 billion rubles. In 
addition, although last year's debts are being paid off, 
non-payments for the first quarter of 1994 are growing: as of 
today the debt amounts to 500 billion rubles. 
  At the same time, the deputy chairman of the Russian 
Government said that only 12.4 trillion rubles have been 
allocated to resolving all social problems, which is 9.5 percent 
of the budget. In his view, at least 15 per cent of the federal 
budget's assets are necessary just to resolve the most painful 
problems in the sphere.

<F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report under the "Principles" rubric: </F>
"Finance Ministry Promises To Keep an Eye on the Federal Budget. 
The Senate Has To Put Up With It So Far"] 
  [Text] Sergey Dubinin, acting finance minister, who 
presented the Law on Financing the Federal Budget Expenditures 
in the Second Quarter of 1994 to the parliament's upper chamber 
yesterday, said that the 9.4 trillion rubles [R] in Central Bank 
credits "have already been kind of allocated," and that the 
government still sees the established R10.6 trillion as the 
"upper ceiling." 
  The government plans to hold all talks with the regions 
"within the limits of the established volume of the budget;" 
that is, Mr. Dubinin assured, "if someone asks for more money, 
one should understand that we will thus cut someone else's 
funding." 
  The government "still insists," he said, that the regions 
may 
keep 22 percent of tax revenues -- not 35 percent, as local 
authorities demand. At the same time, the acting finance 
minister emphasized, territorial authorities have been given the 
right to impose any taxes "without limitation even on the part 
of the federal parliament." In addition, local authorities will 
be exempt from the obligation to report to the center about 
regional budgets' expenditures. 
  As for "government debts toward last year's credits," Sergey 
Dubinin pointed out that, "legally speaking, nothing but 
obligations under bilateral treaties can be recognized as 
debts." Such include, for instance, the treaty on government 
orders with the Defense Ministry, agreements with workers' 
collectives on the payment of wages, and government agreements 
with coal miners, he said. The government has estimated last 
year's debts of this kind at R4 trillion, of which R3 trillion 
have already been repaid, Dubinin said. The remaining R1 
trillion is expected to be repaid by issuing securities, a 
measure on which an agreement with the Central Bank has already 
been reached, Mr. Dubinin said. 
  During the discussion on the draft law the acting minister 
told the senators that if they fail to adopt the document, which 
was earlier passed by the lower chamber, this would "create an 
extremely difficult situation, because only a lawyer will be 
able to figure out in light of the current Constitution whether 
the government may undertake any financing at all." A bit later 
Sergey Dubinin remarked, however, that if "an extreme situation" 
like that occurs, then "even a decision by the State Duma alone 
may be considered fully sufficient for maintaining the country's 
viability."

  [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- "The Central Bank of Russia 
[CBR] will not protect the rouble's rate against the dollar up 
to the last cent in its reserves," CBR Governor Viktor 
Gerashchenko said in an interview with BUSINESS-TASS after his 
speech on finance and credit policy at a parliamentary hearing 
on the Russian draft budget for 1994, which was held on Tuesday. 
  "I believe that the rouble's rate should be at a level which 
would not force Russian exporters to leave foreign markets," he 
continued. "If they are forced to do so, this will mean that the 
rate is rigged." 
  The governor said that the CBR's hard currency reserves now 
total 4.5 billion dollars. They somewhat dropped due to the 
active policy of pegging up the rouble vis-a-vis the dollar in 
January. The present task is to boost the CBR's hard currency 
reserves to nine billion dollars by the end of the current year. 
  There were some 13,000 billion roubles in circulation in the 
country, as of January 1, 1994. Gerashchenko noted that the 
100,000-rouble bill "should not be put into circulation for the 
time being".

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent R. Safronov; from the "Vesti" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] A number of ministers in charge of social issues, 
led by Yuriy Yarov, deputy chairman of the government, held a 
news conference today. They revealed some very interesting 
facts. For example, Labor Minister Gennadiy Melikyan said that 
the number of people in Russia with incomes below the poverty 
line nearly halved in February. The reason for this is that 
people working in the public sector had a pay rise in that 
month, the child allowance was increased, and pensioners began 
receiving compensation for inflation. 
  However, the current year does not hold any bright prospects 
in store. According to Yuriy Prokofyev, head of the Federal 
Employment Service, the country today has 989,000 registered 
unemployed, which amounts to one percent of the able-bodied 
population. As for the real unemployment figure, currently 
estimated at about 4 million, it could reach 6.5 million by the 
end of the year, accounting for eight percent of the able-bodied 
population. To prevent this category of the population from 
sliding into extreme poverty, public works such as street 
cleaning are to be organized, which will be paid for from the 
federal budget. The 100 percent unemployed will receive an 
unemployment benefit and those who would like to change their 
profession will be offered retraining schemes, with grants 
higher than the unemployment benefit.

  [Text] By the middle of the current year, all oil 
exporters will be determined by the Russian Government. This 
matter was previously dealt with by the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations. This decision has been made by the 
government commission on operational issues. In the opinion of 
experts at the RIKA news agency, the government commission's 
decision is connected with the fact that the state budget 
received just $6.9 billion of the $8.5 billion revenue from 
state oil export quotas. In order to prevent petrodollars 
leaking abroad, a group of authorized banks will soon be 
entrusted with the handling of oil exporters' accounts.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Petrenko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- If the pace of privatisation 
is maintained, more than 70 per cent of Russia's industrial 
enterprises will become private by the middle of the year, 
according to specialists of the Russian State Property 
Management Committee. 
  Paradoxes in Russia are not an exception, but a rule -- 
despite the continuing production decline, enterprises are in no 
hurry to get rid of the redundant employees, appealing to the 
temporary character of current difficulties. 
  While the total production output dropped by 16 per cent in 
Russia in 1993, the number of workers and employees decreased 
only by five per cent. Even the shortage of raw materials, fuel 
and spare parts and overstocked warehouses have failed to 
discourage plants and companies from sacking their employees. 
To retain their workforce, they resort to various ruses, 
including shorter working weeks or unpaid leaves. 
  The leadership of Moscow's Zil automobile plant that halted 
its assembly lines on April 4 laid off workers and employees, 
promising to pay 75 per cent of their leaves. As of the 
beginning of the year over seven per cent of all workforce in 
industry worked part time. 
  However, market relations are beginning to make themselves 
felt. Industries which have already completed the process of 
privatisation are more willing to get rid of the redundant 
labour. In machine engineering and metal working industry the 
number of workers dropped by 800,000 in 1993, in chemical and 
petrochemical industry by 50,000. 
  Another factor is that labour is flowing from the state 
sector to private businesses. Currently, less than 19 million 
people work in Russia's industry. Slightly more than half of 
them work at state enterprises, one third at firms and companies 
with mixed form of ownership and 11 per cent in private business. 
  However, the situation is tend to change rather rapidly. 
Specialists of the Russian State Property Management Committee 
said that if the pace of privatisation is maintained -- over 900 
large and medium-sized enterprises a month -- more than 70 per 
cent of industrial enterprises will become private by the middle 
of the year. They will employ 17 million people.

<F P=106> [Unattributed feature under the general heading: "71 </F>
Percent of 1993 Level. Drop in Production May Mean End to 
Production of Unnecessary Output"] 
  [Text] The statistics regarding the state of our economy 
in March can hardly be cause for optimism. Vice Premier A. 
Shokhin admitted that we have not seen such a slump in 
production throughout the years of reform. 
  One should not doubt the accuracy of the State Committee for 
Statistics' [Goskomstat] figures -- the country's main accounts 
department has been working better and, importantly, more 
honestly. There is certainly a slump, but what has caused it? 
Statistics do not provide the answer to this question and that 
is why it is just as hard to paint a real picture of the 
situation in our economy as it is to say without knowing the 
rate of exchange who is richer -- an Italian with 1 million lire 
or a Turk with 1 million Turkish lire. 
  First it is necessary to compare the figures for the 
production of various categories of output with the demand for 
this output. Undoubtedly, a considerable proportion of the 
decline is due to the fact that production of unnecessary or 
poor-quality output has stopped and been replaced by imports. 
This means that a normal market has begun to operate with a 
manager only buying what he needs. 
  The second reason for the fall in demand is the fact that 
enterprises are resorting to their own internal stocks: 
Previously idle machine tools are being started up, 
dust-covered tires are being supplied from depots, and electric 
motors that are still fit for work are not being scrapped. This 
second inhibitor of demand will quite obviously exhaust itself 
fairly rapidly -- stocks will run out -- and this represents the 
main potential base for the revival of demand and future 
economic growth. 
  A third inhibitor will however also manifest itself here -- 
one that is coming into play even today -- prices. Will 
enterprises have the money to buy equipment that they really 
need and that is of really good quality (the same applies to 
consumer goods for the population)? This question is perhaps 
the most tricky. Today many enterprises are cutting production 
and are inundated with goods that are necessary in theory but 
are failing to find a market owing to their price which 
potential customers consider to be too high. A kind of "trench 
war" is under way -- who will sit the other out? 
  In a normal market economy the vendor is usually the first 
to 
"give in," lowering prices and guaranteeing himself a profit by 
increasing turnover. When this mechanism comes into play in our 
country too, then it will be possible to say that another 
important element of a civilized market has appeared. But at 
the moment we evidently cannot do without vigorous intervention 
on the part of the state. This primarily applies to the rescue 
and recovery of unviable production units. 
  A second highly important lever for state regulation is 
credit policy. We have finally managed to get inflation under 
control -- it has proved possible by targeted efforts to lower 
the rate from 18 percent in January to 8.7 percent in March. It 
is quite likely that the rate will be reduced further in the 
coming months to 5-7 percent. But is that necessary? The 
leadership of the Ministry of the Economy believes that it is 
more advisable to slightly raise the rate of inflation once an 
influx of credit into the most viable sectors and production 
units has been guaranteed. 
  It is not only "bald" statistics that are needed to adopt 
such decisions, but also in-depth analysis of what is behind a 
particular figure. Otherwise decisions are adopted on the basis 
of the following principle under pressure from sectoral 
lobbyists: "Everything is collapsing, let us help." Analysis of 
the economic situation along with the adoption of the 
corresponding decisions must be prompt and efficient. 
<H5>  Production of the Most Important Categories of Industrial </H5>
Output in the First 20 Days of March 1994 
  In the first 20 days of March 1994 the average daily volume 
of production of 13 out of 163 reported categories of output -- 
8 percent of the total -- rose compared with the same period in 
March 1993 (including urban telephone system cables, 
polypropylene, potash fertilizers, asbestos-cement pipes and 
sleeves, cotton fabrics, school books, pencils, full-fat cheeses 
and sheep's milk cheese, and toilet soap), while production of 
145 categories of output, or 89 percent, dropped. 
  During this period in March 1994 no tower cranes with a load 
capacity of eight tonnes or more, no feed-, grain-, and 
flax-harvesting combines, and no mainline electric locomotives 
were manufactured.

  [Excerpt] Moscow, 5 Apr -- The optic fiber communications 
line between Moscow and St. Petersburg which became operational 
today can be described as a breakthrough in Russian 
telecommunications. Mayors Yuriy Luzhkov and Anatoliy Sobchak 
could meet on the screens of monitors defying the distance of 
675 km between them. This unusual video link-up took place 
simultaneously in the capital and the town on the Neva. It 
crowned the efforts of three firms -- "Metrokom," "Raskom," and 
"Makomnet" -- established in Russia by "Andrew Corporation," a 
U.S. company which is a world leader in telecommunications. On 
the Russian side, the partners were the subways of both towns, 
the October [Oktyabrskaya] railway, and the "High-Speed Tracks" 
joint-stock company. 
  The video equipment used for this special news conference 
was 
connected to the sections of the optic fiber network laid down 
in subway tunnels in each town and along the entire October 
railway. The technology transmits simultaneously huge volumes of 
audio, video, and computerized data both within the country and 
to international communications satellites. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Anders Aslund `Debate' article: "A Threat to Europe"] </F>
  [Text] A few months after the frightening outcome of the 
elections in Russia we can stop holding our breath. Things are 
not as bad as they once looked, and once again the prophets of 
doom have been proved wrong. 
  So far the new Russian parliament is working much better 
than 
the old Supreme Soviet. It consists of eleven relatively 
cohesive groups with a degree of party discipline. Businessmen 
are no longer able to buy individual deputies. The parliament's 
power is balanced, because the new constitution has introduced a 
normal distribution of power. 
  The old Supreme Soviet had an overwhelming majority of 
red-browns, but they have only 34 percent of seats in the new 
Duma, and they are respecting the parliamentary rules. 
Zhirinovskiy's closest allies are already beginning to abandon 
him. The four democratic groupings are well represented with 35 
percent of seats. In practice a number of centrist groupings 
are dominant. The system of parliamentary compromises has begun 
to work. 
  Regional leaders have taken their places on the Federation 
Council, the parliament's upper chamber, the trend toward 
dissolution inside Russia has softened considerably since the 
new constitution was adopted. Even stubborn Tatarstan has come 
to an agreement with Moscow. 
  Despite the fact that Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin was not a candidate in the elections, he appears 
today to be the most powerful politician. He has a strong power 
base in the state machine and heavy industry, at the same time 
that he represents the parliamentary center and can play 
democrats against the red-browns. In practice it is not 
President Yeltsin but Chernomyrdin who has come to exercise the 
strong executive power which the constitution gives to the 
president. 
  As is well known the change in the economic system has 
progressed far too slowly in Russia. In addition the democrats 
have failed to get their message to the broad masses of the 
people. That is why the old establishment has been given a 
breathing space in which to recover. Its more progressive wing 
led by Chernomyrdin has now won power. The KGB and other 
sinister sections of the old Soviet establishment have in their 
turn had time to reshape themselves into crime syndicates 
because the process of liberalization has progressed so slowly. 
  Democracy has grown stronger and crime rates have fallen in 
countries where the transition from one system to another has 
been more radical and consistent, such as Poland and the Czech 
Republic or Estonia and Latvia. In addition the social costs of 
the change of system in Russia have been much larger than they 
need have been. 
  Now that the alarm over the elections results has abated, 
what is most surprising is how much has actually been achieved 
through the change of system in Russia. Today Russia has a 
market economy, even though it suffers from some distortions and 
a high degree of lawlessness. Deregulation has largely been 
implemented. More than half of those Russians in work are now 
working in the private sector. The main question is how high 
the level of inflation will be. 
  In January there were many of us who were worried by the 
fact 
that Chernomyrdin sounded as if he intended to abandon all 
policies of stabilization. Now, with hindsight, it seems as if 
he was indulging in some opportunistic hot air, partly to escape 
criticism, and partly to force the liberal deputy prime 
ministers, Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, to resign for 
political reasons. In practice Chernomyrdin has now taken over 
their economic policies. 
  Since October Russia has actually had an extraordinarily 
tight monetary policy, which has forced down inflation to a 
level of 11 percent in February. Since market interest rates 
are at all of 20 percent per month (800 percent per year) Russia 
has the world's highest level of real interest. 
  The budget deficit is still on the large side at 9 percent 
of 
GNP, but IMF chief Michel Camdessus was nevertheless 
sufficiently impressed by the Russian attempts at a policy of 
stabilization to agree -- on certain conditions -- to sign a new 
stabilization agreement with Russia and grant Russia new credits. 
  Today's official targets are to bring inflation down to 7 to 
9 percent per month by the end of the year, against last year's 
average of 20 percent per month. The battle against inflation 
ought to be more ambitious, in order to make possible economic 
recovery, and the excessively hesitant anti-inflation policy 
increases the cost to society. 
  However, the tough monetary policy has begun to bite on 
large 
enterprises which refused for as long as they could to adapt to 
the laws of the market economy. In general bad enterprises with 
no demand for their products do not go bankrupt, nor do they 
fire employees. They simply scale down activities until they 
are almost at a standstill. Salaries fall behind inflation and 
are often paid three to four months late, so employees seek jobs 
with better enterprises if they can. Almost all Russian 
enterprises are now demanding advance payment from each other. 
  However, many enterprises are now experiencing great demand 
and their biggest problem is that they are unable to increase 
their production because of the combination of high inflation 
which undermines their working capital and the high real 
interest rates which mean that they cannot afford to take 
credits. These enterprises are no longer calling for subsidized 
credits but, on the contrary, for a stricter budgetary policy so 
that real levels of interest rates fall. 
  The standard picture of Russia is of a country with 
plummeting living standards, but this picture is false. After a 
large fall in 1992 the recovery began in 1993. It is true that 
official GNP fell by 12 percent in 1993, but remarkably enough 
the population's income rose by all of 9 percent. One 
explanation is that the share of private consumption rose from a 
low of 36 percent in 1992 to 41 percent in 1993, while two 
thirds of the GNP of Western countries goes to private 
consumption. 
  When the share of private consumption is so small, the trend 
of developments in GNP is not that important, but the Russians' 
living standards are likely to rise sharply over the next few 
years because consumption's share of GNP should increase 
considerably. 
  Another explanation is that much of private production 
cannot be measured because of tax evasion, while state 
production was exaggerated under communism. In addition it can 
only be good for living standards if the production of nuclear 
arms, for example, decreases, even if GNP then falls. 
  Also, a properly functioning market produces a much better 
distribution of resources. The most remarkable result is that 
this year Russia looks as if it will be self-sufficient in 
grain, while people were worried about starvation in Russia in 
the winter of 1991/92. Today a large number of import goods 
which raise living standards -- particularly medicines -- have 
penetrate the whole of Russia. 
  Despite everything the Russian economy is on a pretty safe 
track. Swedish businessmen are noticing this. In the first 11 
months of 1993 Sweden's exports to Russia increased by a total 
of 56 percent. Russia is in fact our most rapidly growing 
export market. 
  What has frightened the West most since the Russian 
parliamentary elections is the new Russian foreign policy which 
asserts Russian interests with a ruthlessness that is new and 
also reminiscent of the past. In the most recent edition of the 
periodical, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, former U.S. security adviser 
Zbigniew Brzezinski has criticized the U.S. administration for 
pursuing a foreign policy that is too Russocentric and the 
administration already seems to have changed its foreign policy 
along the lines demanded by Brzezinski. 
  Brzezinski does not oppose the U.S. attempts hitherto to 
support the economic and political stabilization of Russia, but 
he advocates two important complementary policy strands. The 
first is to incorporate the successful central Europe (and this 
should include the Baltic region) into the West. As an American 
Brzezinski advocates NATO membership, but EU [European Union] 
membership is a natural alternative. 
  Brzezinski's other complementary strand is that the central 
objective of a farsighted Western policy in the region should be 
"to consolidate geopolitical pluralism inside the former Soviet 
Union." His central thesis is: "Russia can either be an empire 
or a democracy, but not both." 
  I personally believe that the fears that Russia will engage 
in activity that will destabilize Eastern Europe are 
exaggerated. Russia has had enough of the torment of the former 
Soviet Union and its actions in Bosnia are most likely to teach 
the West the lesson that Russia is a great power with its own 
national interests which intends to play an active role in the 
field of European security policy. Eastern Europe should, 
however, be integrated into Europe if the sort of feeling of 
national security which leads to stability is to be achieved. 
  Russia's policy toward the former Soviet republics, on 
the other hand, gives cause for concern, but there still are 
strong forces in Moscow which are working against attempts to 
reincorporate former Union republics, since this would 
destabilize Russia both politically and economically. 
  A telling example is how a potentially destabilizing 
currency 
union between Russia and Belarus recently came to nothing. The 
more successful the fight against inflation in Russia, the 
stronger grow the anti-imperialist forces in Russia. This is 
why it is important for the rest of the world to support a 
stabilization of the Russian economy. 
  If former Soviet republics collapse, however, it will be 
extraordinarily difficult for a government in Moscow not to 
intervene. It is difficult for the rest of the world to 
criticize Russia's involvement in civil-war-torn Tajikistan and 
it has no alternative to Russian "peacekeeping" forces in the 
Caucasus. 
  Economic destabilization is probably a serious threat. A 
total of nine out of fifteen former Soviet republics suffered 
hyperinflation -- more than 50 percent inflation in any single 
month -- in 1993. Among the other former Soviet republics only 
the three Baltic republics have been more successful 
economically than Russia. Veritable shock therapy as in Estonia 
and Latvia seems to produce the best results, but attempts to 
carry out a radical change of system are the next best thing. 
Things are worst when countries like Ukraine try to carry out a 
gradual change of system. 
  The worst threat to European security is the far-reaching 
destabilization of the Ukrainian economy. In time Ukraine's 
hyperinflation must lead to both social and political 
destabilization, and regardless what government is in power in 
Moscow Russia will be unable to remain an onlooker. This is why 
the collapse of Ukraine could also be a catastrophe for Russia 
and the rest of the world. 
  The central objective for the West's security policy 
should therefore be to work to prevent the collapse of the 
Ukraine. The main problem is that the whole of the Ukrainian 
political leadership with President Leonid Kravchuk at its head 
seems to be totally irresponsible and corrupt, while the 
Ukrainian population is embarrassingly passive. However, the 
Ukrainian parliamentary elections may have made a democratic 
revolution possible. 
  The West's first priority should be to contribute to 
enlightenment in Ukraine and make it clear that it is possible 
to achieve Ukraine's economic salvation through a radical change 
of system. At the same time the West must alleviate the shock 
by making substantial credits available if Ukraine initiates a 
credible change of system.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1425 GMT on 7 April broadcasts a 
15-minute program entitled "The Korean Knot" presented by 
Vitaliy Ilyashenko. The program includes a factual account by 
the correspondent on the crisis around the DPRK's non-observance 
of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. A studio discussion is 
chaired by Ilyashenko with Aleksandr Panov, deputy minister of 
foreign affairs and Professor Anatoliy Torkunov, rector of the 
Institute of International Relations. 
  Panov says that in view of the high troop concentration on 
the border between the Korean states the situation is very 
volatile there. He goes on to call for a multilateral 
international conference on the problem, saying: "We believe 
that we should, that it is right to use the channels in 
existence -- the Security Council, certainly -- but since the 
bilateral variant is not working, let us then go back to the 
idea of a multilateral conference. It should be said that no 
one has yet -- but we have only just put this idea forward -- no 
one has yet, as they say, swept it aside -- even the DPRK, 
although when I explained this initiative to the North Korean 
ambassador in Moscow he already knew about the initiative and 
did not react negatively to it. 
  "Other countries are also studying it. The United States 
have come out and said that in principle they believe that such 
a conference should be well prepared -- and we agree -- and they 
have already put forward a set of positions that should be 
reinforced during the conference. These are the unconditional 
and full return of the DPRK to the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty and inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, 
and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. All of this 
coincides with our policy. But we need to go further. We need 
to give some sort of guarantee to North Korea and ensure the 
non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula and the sovereignty 
of the Korean states and nonintervention in their internal 
affairs. So, there is a complex of measures to go through 
before we can solve this problem." 
  Asked what the treaty between Russia and the DPRK would mean 
in the event of a deterioration in the military situation on the 
Korean peninsula, Panov says: "As the legal successor of the 
Soviet Union, Russia continues to fulfill the commitments of 
that treaty. It has not been denounced and the only thing, of 
course, is that the situation has changed, and therefore we have 
made a statement of which the DPRK has been informed: How we 
interpret the article that stipulates assistance and support for 
the DPRK in the event of an emergency situation of the kind. 
  "It was stated that assistance would be given only in the 
event of an unsanctioned aggression against the DPRK. We 
ourselves will analyze the situation on the basis of our own 
sources of information and how the problems are dealt with. We 
will assess the degree of threat, the degree of aggression and 
its character, and we will operate within our legislation and 
our Constitution, and we will certainly take into account 
Russia's international obligations -- for instance those under 
the International Atomic Energy Agency Treaty and the UN 
Charter. So our position here is quite clear." 
  When the discussion turned to the possibility of UN 
sanctions 
against the DPRK, Panov says: "We believe that matters should 
not be brought to the level of sanctions and that if it is 
impossible to solve this within the framework of the Security 
Council, then there is the option of a conference. That is to 
say, there is quite a way to go before we arrive at sanctions. 
We need to use every option."

<F P=106> [Salim Ayubzod, Igor Rotar report under the "talks" rubric: </F>
"Tajiks Seek Peace in Moscow"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The Tajik Government 
delegation at talks in Moscow that opened on 5 April insists on 
the following provisions: the suspension of hostilities along 
the Tajik-Afghan border, and the return of refugees from 
Afghanistan and CIS countries. Shukur Zukhurov, head of the 
government delegation and minister of labor and population 
employment, who previously would not give any guarantees of 
safety of refugees wishing to go back to Tajikistan, stated in 
his address that the republic's government gives full guarantees 
to all who "wish to return to the republic with the intention of 
rehabilitating the ravaged economy." But right on the heels of 
it Zukhurov added in an interview for a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent that this question would only be resolved through 
joint efforts of the government and the opposition. Zukhurov 
paid special attention in his address to the question of 
guarding the border. "Helped by Russia and the CIS countries, 
Tajikistan will be able to protect itself, but we do not want 
this to be done at the price of young people dying. Which is 
why these talks are so important," Zukhurov declared. 
  Otakhon Latifi, head of the opposition forces delegation and 
chairman of the Coordination Center of Democratic Forces of 
Tajikistan in CIS Countries, underlined right at the start of 
the talks that the opposition had not gone back on their plan 
for the settlement of the conflict, and he thought that the 
border question, like the one about the return of refugees, 
cannot be resolved without political accord. A political 
consensus, according to the opposition, becomes possible in the 
event of the creation of a Council for National Reconciliation 
(with representatives of all regions of the republic taking 
part), a State Council comprising neutral and competent people, 
disarmament and disbandment of all government and opposition 
armed groups and formations, the return of refugees, and the 
holding of free democratic elections. In his interview for a 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, Latifi pointed out that even 
today's Dushanbe leaders, "including in that number Emomali 
Rakhmonov himself, talk about the incompetence of the old 
parliament, whereas electing a new parliament in conditions of a 
breakdown of law and order and the absence from Tajikistan of 
nearly 1 million citizens is a road toward a new impasse." 
[passage omitted] 
  So far Tajikistan's government has been rather evasive in 
its 
reaction to the opposition's demand for the creation of a State 
Council. For example, Makhmadsaid Ubaydullayev, Tajikistan 
Council of Ministers deputy chairman, underlined in an interview 
to ITAR-TASS yesterday that today's government is quite 
legitimate because it was elected by the country's Supreme 
Soviet. On the other hand, in Ubaydullayev's opinion, this 
question, likewise the form of a future state system of the 
republic, can be decided on and chosen only by the people of 
Tajikistan rather than an individual group of people. In this 
sense, the deputy prime minister ruled out the holding of a 
referendum. 
  According to information from trustworthy sources, results 
of 
the current talks are being eagerly awaited not only by tens of 
thousands of refugees, but also by armed opposition groups. 
Conferences of opposition field commanders are taking place 
these days in Talukan (Afghanistan) to discuss further actions. 
Sources maintain that these forces have so far undertaken no 
major offensive against the Tajik-Afghan border. [passage 
omitted] 
  Even if the talks take the most favorable turn, one should 
not forget about the time factor. Both sides are represented at 
today's stage of talks by "second echelons" of the power 
structures. A NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent was told in 
yesterday's telephone conversation by Haji Akbar Turadzhonzoda, 
former head of Tajikistan's Muslims who is now in Teheran, that 
he did not come to Moscow because the government delegation is 
not representative enough. Interestingly, Tajikistan Foreign 
Minister Rashid Alimov is in Moscow as a private individual and 
seems to be secretly in control of the official Dushanbe 
delegation. 
  It is therefore hardly probable that the delegations, in 
their present composition, will score appreciable successes. As 
in all similar conflicts, time is not on the side of those 
advocating compromise -- a further delay in resolving the 
problem may result in the situation finally getting out of 
control and events assuming an uncontrolled, spontaneous nature.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Vladimir Taranov and </F>
Boris Krivoshey] 
  [Text] Moscow April 7 TASS -- The Moscow round of talks 
between the Tajik Government and anti-government opposition is 
proceeding in calm and businesslike atmosphere. Both 
negotiating teams demonstrate a constructive attitude towards 
problems tackled by the talks, spokesman for the Russian Foreign 
Ministry Grigoriy Karasin told a briefing on Thursday. 
  Nobody is under illusion that the current Tajik negotiations 
will immediately disentangle all knots, which is to take 
strained and ponderous efforts. Some recent reports by the mass 
media are based on off-the-record statements and do not tend to 
create a favourable atmosphere at the talks, the Foreign 
Ministry spokesman noted. 
  Participants in the Moscow round of Tajik talks agreed to 
refrain from hasty and comments. Only well-considered official 
reports will be provided to newsmen. Relations with the press 
will be coordinated by Piris-Ballon [name as received], the U.N. 
secretary general's special envoy for peace settlement in 
Tajikistan, Karasin told reporters.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin by Katja </F>
Gloger, Matthias Schepp, and Rolf Schmidt-Holtz; place and date 
not given: "Yeltsin Is the Master of the Situation"] 
  [Text] [STERN] Mr. Prime Minister, it is once again being 
said that your boss is fatally ill. It is said that Boris 
Yeltsin suffers from cirrhosis of the liver. How is he really? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Anyone who wants to test Yeltsin's state of 
health should play tennis with him. This talk about his 
illnesses is simply insulting. The president was on vacation, 
during which he relaxed and also went hunting. 
  [STERN] Meanwhile, rumors of a putsch circulated in Moscow. 
  [Chernomyrdin] This is nonsense. Someone wants to 
destabilize the situation. I do not react to such rumors at 
all. Yeltsin is the master of the situation. He will complete 
his term of office -- until 1996. Then we will have new 
elections. 
  [STERN] During public appearances, however, Yeltsin looks 
sick. And he had to accept the amnesty of his opponents 
Aleksandr Rutskoy and Ruslan Khasbulatov without being able to 
do anything against it. They wanted to overthrow him last 
October. 
  [Chernomyrdin] Once again: Yeltsin is well. Concerning the 
amnesty, one can be of different opinions. As quickly as it was 
done, it got out of control. Here, too, Yeltsin was supposed to 
be presented as someone who no longer holds the reins. This is 
not true. 
  [STERN] The Russians elected communists and right-wing 
extremist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy into parliament in December. 
Does Russia actually want democracy? 
  [Chernomyrdin] The Russians do not want to go back to the 
past, but a good life does not fall from heaven. One has to 
work hard for it. It is the task of my government to establish 
the conditions for it. We must find a feasible path in this 
labyrinth of reforms. Above all, we need a rule-of-law state 
and private property. 
  [STERN] How dangerous is Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Chernomyrdin] The people voted for him because their 
standard of living is going down. They did not vote for 
Zhirinovskiy as a person but against us and our mistakes. 
  [STERN] Could Zhirinovskiy become president? 
  [Chernomyrdin] The worse our economy is the greater are 
Zhirinovskiy's prospects for success. Regardless of how 
Zhirinovskiy is assessed, fascism in Russia does not have a 
chance. It is not Zhirinovskiy who is dangerous but the decline 
of industrial production. The reforms are making too little 
progress. 
  [STERN] And this is said by the man who is criticized as a 
braker of reforms and as an apparachik. 
  [Chernomyrdin] This is claimed by those who do not know 
anything. My task is to make as few mistakes as possible and to 
push the reforms ahead quickly. 
  [STERN] In the West, it is your former Deputy Prime Minister 
Yegor Gaydar who is praised as a reformer and not you. 
  [Chernomyrdin] Gaydar and Boris Fedorov.... 
  [STERN] ...the finance minister who has also resigned... 
  [Chernomyrdin] ...are not the fathers of the reform. These 
guys just like to see themselves in this role. It was and is 
Boris Yeltsin who stands for economic reforms. As finance 
minister, Fedorov could not decide anything without me and 
Yeltsin. Yegor Gaydar was in my cabinet for just three months 
last year. 
  [STERN] As prime minister, you are responsible for the fact 
that today, almost one out of three Russians live in poverty. 
How do you plan to bring Russia to its feet again? 
  [Chernomyrdin] I would feel better if there were a simple 
answer to that. I pity Russia from the bottom of my heart. 
However, there is no standard solution. We cannot simply copy 
Germany or the United States or take over something from a 
textbook. This is the mistake that many so-called reformers 
make. They do not know Russia. 
  [STERN] But under your leadership, industrial production 
declined by 16 percent in 1993. 
  [Chernomyrdin] Yes, at the moment many companies are idle. 
However, things will get even worse: Companies will go 
bankrupt. We need that so that our economy can recover. It 
takes time to convert the powerful military-industrial complex. 
One cannot simply change from tanks to tractors. 
  [STERN] Russian politicians have already been calling for an 
economic state of emergency. 
  [Chernomyrdin] For me, there is only one way -- market 
economy. But we also need industrial policy by the state --- 
not a planned economy. As a former head of a corporation, I 
know very well what the latter did. Centralism was such that I 
felt regularly sick. Going back to that? I do not even dare to 
think of that. I cannot decide in Moscow today how a road 
should be built in Vladivostok on the Pacific coast. Let the 
people think themselves. 
  [STERN] But the call for a strong hand is getting louder and 
louder. 
  [Chernomyrdin] I, too, am against chaos. By the way, market 
economy does not mean chaos. The people in our country have 
always been ruled by a strong hand. First Father Tsar, then the 
communists. For many people that was easy: There was no need 
to think. It is impossible to change people overnight in such a 
way that they are suddenly suitable for the market economy. 
  [STERN] The legacy of the command economy.... 
  [Chernomyrdin] Let us take the example of Germany. It is 
not enough that the east German changes from a Trabant car to a 
Mercedes. He is still different from a west German. He works 
differently. When work is over at six in the evening, some of 
them drop what they are doing and go to a bar. 
  [STERN] Germany is facing Bundestag elections. What would a 
change in government from Kohl to a Social Democrat mean for you? 
  [Chernomyrdin] The German people, whom I value very highly, 
will make the right choice. I respect Mr. Kohl very much. 
Personally, I would welcome it if he remained chancellor." 
  [STERN] Does your reform policy meet with sufficient support 
in the West? 
  [Chernomyrdin] We were promised $24 billion.... 
  [STERN] ...at the international economic summit in Munich in 
1992.... 
  [Chernomyrdin] ...and if we had received this money, we 
would not have suffered such a slump. Then reforms would have 
been easier. All these Western promises of the past years were 
not fulfilled. The Russian people know that. But we are no 
beggars. We are equal partners because our country has enormous 
resources. 
  [STERN] Should Germany help with even more than 80 billion 
marks. 
  [Chernomyrdin] Germany is the key country for us. The 
Germans understand us best. But they are not investing enough. 
I appeal to German entrepreneurs: Do not be afraid of 
investing in Russia. We have gotten through the worst. One can 
earn good money in our country.... 
  [STERN] ...and lose it. Anyone who invests here must bribe 
the corrupt bureaucracy and pay protection money to the Mafia. 
  [Chernomyrdin] This is a big problem. We need extremely 
tough measures against crime. There must finally be order, just 
as in Germany. 
  [STERN] Do you actually still have hope for Russia? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Certainly. Nevertheless, I do not understand 
at all why so many people want to become prime minister. 
Sometimes my life seems to be an absolute nightmare. My 
biggest worry is that time is running out. I am confident, I do 
not sway.

<F P=106> [John Lloyd report: "Russian Investment Surge Boosts </F>
Industrial Shake-Up] 
  [Text] Moscow -- A surge of domestic and foreign 
investment in Russia is boosting the shares of privatised 
companies and giving much-needed momentum to the process of 
industrial restructuring, according to financiers. 
  The flow of foreign funds into the country reached $400m 
(273m pounds) in the first quarter this year, raising hopes of a 
long- awaited breakthrough in investor interest in Russia, 
although some experts are less optimistic. Foreign investment 
totalled $2.9bn last year. 
  The prices of vouchers which Russians use to buy shares in 
privatised companies have been rising steadily and trading in 
shares of some of the "plum" enterprises has been frenetic, say 
financiers. 
  The two-year privatisation programme, due to end in June, is 
now releasing shares of companies in the utility, communication 
and energy sectors, at knock-down prices. 
  They include the Unified Energy System, the world's largest 
integrated power generation company; the Lukoil holding company, 
Russia's largest oil producer and refiner; the Rostelkom 
telephone corporation; and the Primorsk and Novorossisk Shipping 
companies, which dominate the Russian Far East and Black Sea 
maritime routes. 
  Shares in Unified Energy System have risen from an original 
nominal price of Rbsl,000 (70 US cents) when they were sold to 
workers to $2.30 when workers sold their shares in 
over-the-counter trading and to about $8 in the national voucher 
auction, when members of the public bid their vouchers for a 13 
per cent stake in the company. 
  Even so, the valuation of the company was extremely low by 
international standards, according to Mr Boris Jordan, head of 
the Credit Suisse First Boston [CSFB] branch in Moscow -- the 
largest foreign bank engaged in trading shares in Russia and the 
only one with a broker's licence from the Ministry of Finance. 
  "A similar company, producing that number of kilowatts, 
would 
be worth about $49bn in the US, over $30bn in Europe. Here it 
was worth $200m. The world has not yet woken up to the fact 
that Russian assets are so extremely cheap," says Mr Jordan. 
  In this climate, Russian investment funds, many of them 
cash-rich from arbitrage activities, are buying enough shares in 
some companies to control the management board. These funds, 
say CSFB executives, are now sophisticated, knowledgeable and 
eager to restructure the companies under their control. 
  Mr Stephen Jennings, CSFB's investment banking director, 
believes the next three to five years will see widespread change 
in Russia's industrial sector. 
  Set against the new-found enthusiasm of Russian and foreign 
investors for privatised companies are the growing number of 
complaints from foreign business people that rapidly changing 
laws and tax regimes make large deals unattractive, that 
organised crime is penetrating business practices, and that the 
country remains politically and macro-economically unstable.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report No. 14 of 64] </F>
  [Text] According to experts, arms trade was one of the most 
profitable spheres of Soviet foreign trade. In Russia the 
exports and imports of weapons and military equipment have been 
entrusted to the government-owned company Rosvooruzheniye 
recently formed by a decree of President Boris Yeltsin. Our 
reporter Vitaliy Jibuti has interviewed its General Director 
Viktor Samoilov. 
  INTERFAX: Analysts claim that Russia has lost a considerable 
share of the arms markets of the Soviet Union. How true are 
such claims? 
  SAMOILOV: In my opinion only the countries affected by UN 
sanctions are lost. This applies primarily to Libya and Iraq. 
By the way, several capitalist countries received compensation 
from the United Nations and the International Monetary fund for 
severing economic ties with those countries. Only the Soviet 
Union and Russia as its legal successor got nothing after the 
introduction of sanctions. According to my estimates, the 
losses of the Russian Federation amount to $1015 Bn. 
  INTERFAX: Which of the traditional arms markets has Moscow 
retained best? 
  SAMOILOV: The Middle East, India, China, Africa and East 
Europe. However, the difficulty lies in the change in the very 
structure of the arms market. In the past there was no question 
of settlements in hard currency with socialist countries. When 
in 1990 it was decided to switch to settlements in hard 
currency, which I by the way find absolute thoughtless and 
wrong, 1991 was declared the year of payments. As a result the 
Soviet Union and Russia after were left in debt to practically 
all former socialist countries. I think the lack of 
professionalism of the economic leaders of that time the main 
cause for such an imbalance. 
  The matter will have to be settled yet. The Soviet Union 
supplied East Europe with valuable raw materials and 
manufactured goods getting in return mostly green peas and 
tomatoes. As a result the Russian Federation owes its partners 
hundreds of millions of dollars. At the present stage the main 
article with which Russia can pay back its foreign debts, I 
think, is weaponry. 
  INTERFAX: If Russia has kept its traditional arms markets, 
why has trade dropped? 
  SAMOILOV: The volume of trade changed with the change of the 
methods of settlements. Since 1991 Russia has practically 
stopped selling arms for credit. 
  Earlier the Soviet Union supplied arms and military hardware 
mainly on the basis of government agreements and credits. 
Political as well as economic factors were taken into account. 
Credits were given for a minimum of seven years. Often the 
term was 10 or even 20 years. There is even one contract for 43 
years which is still in force. This is the explanation for the 
impressive volume of trade and the recent leadership of Moscow 
in the business. 
  I would want to remark that at the moment the volume of 
American arms trade for cash is practically the same as Russian. 
Last year Moscow imported armaments worth $2 Bn. The the USA 
claims that it sold $30Bn it means credit deliveries as well. 
The credits are usually given at sufficiently advantageous 
terms. Today it is senseless speaking of a return to the old 
volume of Soviet arms trade. This requires a healthy economy 
and solid investments in the industry, because ties should be of 
long-term nature here. 
  Any contract for cooperation in defence is concluded for at 
least 20 or 25 years. It is clear that partners can be 
satisfied with only government contracts. That is why at the 
end of last year the Russian government united several 
organizations trading arms in one, "Rosvooruzheniye". The 
leadership of the company does not wish to keep this 
megacorporation for a long time. As soon as the process of 
forming joint-stock companies in the munitions industry picks 
up speed and structures appear guaranteeing foreign companies 
the observation of contracts for 20 to 25 years in complex types 
of equipment, Rosvooruzheniye is going to give freedom and 
independence in arms trade to them. However, the appearance of 
such Russian companies requires time. 
  At the moment American arms dealers have only one competitor 
- the Russian Federation. The program of arms sales should be 
part of the program of military development and adjusted to the 
program of conversion. That is we should know what plants are 
going to survive in 20 to 25 years, what types of equipment are 
going to remain competitive on condition of their modernization 
during this time. Otherwise Russia risks to lose its markets. 
Individual deals can only keep up the staggering 
military-industrial complex for some time. But such an approach 
is devoid of statesmanship. 
  INTERFAX: What realistic amount of weaponry can Russia 
export this year? 
  SAMOILOV: Trade for cash can be increased by 100 to 150 
percent. If we take trade for credit, in a favorable situation 
the contracts might total $10-15 Bn, but with a delay in 
payments. This is in line with the defence programs of the 
countries that are capable of purchasing Russian weaponry. I 
must say that the figure includes the markets from which 
embargos might be lifted. 
  The figures are realistic because Russia, unlike the Soviet 
Union, is not isolated from the world community. The Russian 
banking and financial systems are integrated in the 
international system. That is why for concluding one deal or 
another Moscow can use first class foreign banks as guarantor. 
Besides, Russian commercial banks are gradually becoming 
stronger, developing into solid financial institutions which can 
be dealt with. I am convinced that if our company offers them a 
well- considered program of crediting some country or another to 
which Russian army goods are going to be sold, Russia banks will 
show interest in that. 
  But today constant complaints on political and economic 
instability in Russia undermine the reliability of domestic arms 
manufacturers and contracts for the delivery of weapons. This 
has also affected the volume of Russian exports. Why should a 
solid client sign a contract with the Russian Federation for the 
delivery of the latest weaponry, if it is not clear who is going 
to control the manufacturing facility tomorrow and whether the 
country is going to stand by its commitments in general? 
  "Rosvooruzheniye" has worked out a program of covering part 
of Russia's foreign debts by deliveries of special equipment. 
The program is designed for two or three years and should bring 
the country over $1 Bn. For the purpose our company has asked a 
government credit to support Russian arms manufacturers. 
  After 1991 the manufacturer has been getting the returns for 
the exports, but not all manufacturers are satisfied with the 
terms of the financial transactions. Many of them do not 
believe in the stability of the Russian government or are 
dissatisfied with the tax system. That is why some companies 
are trying to keep their money in foreign banks. This is an 
understandable desire, I think. 
  "Rosvooruzheniye" guarantees full return of hard currency to 
Russia, the sale of half of it to the state and the return of 
the rubles to the manufacturer.The manufacturer also gets the 
rest of the hard currency, but only in the territory of the 
Russian Federation. 
  I would also want to say that Rosvooruzheniye is interested 
in direct contacts with regions and in the possibility of 
uniting manufacturers into industrial groups that could carry 
out serious economic programs. Our company has set up a 
scientific center that supports such an economic policy. 
Production groups in the military-industrial complex should 
become the main performers of major contracts on military- 
technical cooperation and guarantee their functioning for 20 to 
25 years.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz, April 5, RIA -- The speaker of the 
North Ossetian parliament, Yuriy Biragov, said that the decision 
to hold a second round of talks between the leaders of Northern 
Ossetia and the Ingush Republic in Nalchik on April 3 was a 
major political success, capable of breaking the deadlock in the 
relations between the two conflicting republics within Russia. 
According to the Ossetian parliament leader, personal contacts 
between North Ossetia's President Akhsarbek Galazov and Ingush 
President Ruslan Aushev may have a positive role to play in 
bringing peace to the south of Russia. Mr. Biragov said that 
the Ossetian side would insist on two "fundamental" conditions, 
namely that the Ingush republic abandon all territorial claims 
to Northern Ossetia and declare illegal and unconstitutional any 
attempts to settle the conflict by force. 
  According to the provisional administration in the disputed 
regions of the two republics, its Armed Forces control the 
situation in the state-of-emergency zone and continue to take 
measures to restore law and order there. The confiscation of 
illegal weapons from the population continues. On Monday 
transport police officers and Russian Interior Ministry 
officials discovered two Uzi automatic pistols in a sleeper of 
the Baku-Kislovodsk train, but failed to identify and arrest 
their owners. The investigation of the case continues. 
  A total of 246 submachine-guns, 22 machine-guns, 62 rifles 
and 417 pistols have been confiscated since the imposition of 
the state of emergency in the region.

  [Text] Moscow, April 5, RIA -- In the opinion of Sergey 
Samoylov, acting head of the president's administration 
department for territories, the new fundamental law of the 
republic of Kalmykia -- the Regulations on the Steppes -- 
complies with the Russian Constitution. Although the decision 
passed today by the constitutional conference of Kalmykia on the 
adoption of the regulations is not binding, it will pave the way 
for the forthcoming relevant decision by the Kalmyk parliament. 
  Sergey Samoylov emphasized that valid until now has been the 
constitution of the Kalmyk SSR with some amendments. However, 
the experience of independent development of the republic has 
prompted new changes, i.e. the problems concerning the 
implementation of the concept of economic independence called 
for enacting an updated fundamental law. This circumstance is 
envisaged by the constitution of the Russian federation. Under 
the provisions of the newly- adopted regulations, Kalmykia 
remains a full-fledged national- territorial subject of the 
Russian Federation. The document also lays down the democratic 
norms of establishing state power and human rights, the 
representative of the president's administration pointed out.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin has expressed harsh criticism of the behavior of 
the leading Western industrialized states. In an interview with 
the Hamburg magazine STERN, which is published in its latest 
edition, he said: "If we had received the promised $24 billion, 
we would not have suffered such a slump. Then reforms would 
have been easier. All these Western promises of the past years 
were not fulfilled." 
  "Germany," the Russian prime minister said, "is the key 
country for us. The Germans understand us best. But they are 
not investing enough." He appealed to the German entrepreneurs: 
"Do not be afraid of investing in Russia. We have gotten 
through the worst." Corruption and extortion of protection money 
by the Mafia are "a big problem," Chernomyrdin admitted: "We 
need extremely tough measures against crime. There must finally 
be order -- just as in Germany." 
  In the interview, Chernomyrdin said that rumors about 
President Boris Yeltsin's health are "insulting": "Yeltsin is 
the master of the situation. He will complete his term of 
office -- until 1996." 
  At the Bundestag election in October, the Russian prime 
minister obviously counts on Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In the 
STERN interview he said: "The German people, who I value very 
highly, will make the right choice. I respect Mr. Kohl very 
much. Personally, I would welcome it if he remained chancellor." 
  (The interview was prereleased to DPA in an editorial 
version.)

  [Text] Moscow, April 3 (CTK) -- The leader of Russia's 
extreme nationalist Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, today said that his stance on the Czech Republic's 
joining NATO was "negative." 
  Speaking with journalists during the World Slavonic 
Congress, 
held on his initiative, Zhirinovskiy said that "the Czech 
leadership has the right to make a decision," but "it would be 
better if Slavonic nations became members of the new Eastern 
European community." 
  Unification on the basis of the Slavonic idea will produce 
"a 
better, firmer and juster union" than NATO's expansion would do, 
Zhirinovskiy said. 
  At the congress he said the new community would spread "from 
the Adriatic Sea to the Kurile Islands." 
  Zhirinovskiy told journalists that he would visit the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia "in the nearest future," but did not 
specify. 
  He has been invited to the Czech Republic by the 
parliamentary extreme right Assembly for the 
Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) of Miroslav 
Sladek. 
  The invitation was extended for mid-March, but Zhirinovskiy 
said he would come for a two-day visit on March 20. Following 
strong disagreement with the visit among Czech political parties 
and Interior Minister Jan Ruml's statement that he would do 
everything to prevent the visit, Zhirinovskiy cancelled it 
saying it would be too expensive. 
  Sladek, who was invited to the congress, did not take part. 
Instead he sent a telegram of greetings, the LDP international 
department told journalists. 
  The about 20 foreign guests sitting in the presidium of the 
World Slavonic Congress included Juraj Molnar, deputy chairman 
of the nationalist Slovak National Party (SNS). The SNS along 
with Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (SNS) 
made up the former Slovak Government, dismissed on March 11. 
  Molnar told the congress that "after 1000 years of Hungarian 
yoke and after living with the Czech nation," independent 
Slovakia had realised that it "will not exist unless the Slavs 
are united." 
  Molnar told CTK that he had arrived to the congress mainly 
to 
get acquainted with the LDP leadership. "It is in our interest 
to know what role Slovakia will play in central Europe in case 
of the Liberal Democratic Party's victory in Russia," he said. 
  The guests from Slovakia also included two members of "the 
provisional government of Subcarpathian Rus" which is seeking 
independence from Ukraine. 
  Subcarpathian Rus, historically part of the Austro-Hungarian 
Empire, came under Czechoslovak administration in 1919. A 
treaty of 1945 ceded this easternmost region of Czechoslovakia 
to the Soviet Union.

  [Text] Moscow, March 31 (CTK) -- A delegation of Czech 
economic experts led by Deputy Industry and Trade Minister 
Vaclav Petricek and Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Rudlovcak 
ended its talks here today. 
  The talks focused on the forthcoming visit of Czech Premier 
Vaclav Klaus to the Russian Federation which is expected next 
Monday and Tuesday [4 and 5 April]. 
  In an interview with CTK Petricek said an agreement on 
investment protection was ready for signing. He said Prague and 
Moscow should now discuss possibilities for bringing the current 
drop in their mutual trade to a halt, including lifting trade 
barriers. 
  Regarding Russian debts towards the Czech Republic Rudlovcak 
told CTK that Russia was now in a difficult payment situation 
and considered supplies of Russian goods a basic mechanism for 
repaying its debts. Rudlovcak said the Czech Republic would 
agree with such a solution providing it was regulated in a 
special agreement. Under favorable conditions such a document 
could be drafted by the end of May, he added. 
  Rudlovcak said that during Klaus's expected visit to Moscow 
the principles for such an agreement might be discussed. 
  After the breakup of the Czechoslovak Federation its claims 
against the former Soviet Union were divided between the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia in a two-to-one ratio. The claims worth 
three billion USD ensuing from state loans and trade deficit 
passed to the Czech Republic. Direct claims of Czech 
enterprises against Russian consumers worth about 380 million 
dollars make up an independent part of former Soviet and 
currently Russian debt to the Czech Republic.

  [Text] Moscow, March 30 (CTK) -- An intergovernmental 
protocol on the mutual supply of goods in 1994 was initialed 
today in Moscow by the Russian Ministry for Internal Economic 
Relations [as received] and the Czech Trade and Industry 
Ministry. 
  Among other goods, the document calls for the purchase of 7 
million tons of Russian oil and 6.9 billion cubic meters of 
natural gas. 
  Both countries have agreed that instead of drawing up yearly 
protocols, medium or long-term agreements should be concluded in 
coming years, Deputy Trade and Industry Minister Vaclav Petricek 
said. 
  The Czech delegation in Moscow agreed to cooperate further 
on 
the construction of natural gas works on the basis of 1982 
agreements, according to which the Czech Republic should get 
Russian natural gas in return for Czech supplies and labor. 
  Petricek in Moscow also discussed the possibility of Czech 
participation in the modernization of the natural gas industry 
in Russia and in the construction of a new natural gasline from 
Russia to Germany via Belarus and Poland. Czech firms could 
help build the gasline on Russian and Belarussian territory. 
Further negotiations concerned the possibility of hooking the 
gasline up to the Czech Republic's natural gas distribution 
network.

  [Text] Moscow, April 4 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus 
arrived for a two-day working visit this afternoon. 
  Klaus will meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday 
[5 
April] and also will hold talks with Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. An agreement on support and protection of 
investments is expected to be signed during his visit. 
  Klaus will discuss the payment of Russian debt which amounts 
to some 3 billion USD [U.S. dollars]. 
  After his arrival in Moscow Premier Vaclav Klaus stated 
that he wanted "to try to resolve some issues we have not able 
to settle at lower level." 
  The Russian debt to the Czech Republic is among the issues, 
he added. 
  He said he arrived with some proposals regarding the Russian 
debt. Klaus is to meet President Boris Yeltsin and Premier 
Viktor Chernomyrdin during his two-day visit. 
  Russian media have speculated that Klaus would attempt to 
achieve a more accommodating approach by Russia to the Soviet, 
currently Russian, debt which amounts to 3 billion USD at the 
governmental level and 380 million USD with respect to the 
companies. 
  Before Klaus's visit started Prague and Moscow made it clear 
that a part of the claim could be satisfied by imports of 
Russian goods. Czech representatives have indicated they are 
interested in petrol. 
  A preliminary agreement on export of seven million tons of 
petrol and 6.9 billion cubic metres of gas was signed by the 
relevant ministries last week. However, it is not yet clear 
whether the document will be signed during Klaus's stay.

  [Text] Moscow, April 4 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic is ready 
to expand the free market sphere eastwards, Premier Vaclav Klaus 
stressed during his meeting with students and teachers of the 
Moscow Financial Academy today. 
  "After the experience with Comecon and communist regime one 
cannot expect the Czech Republic to organise some east European 
economic or political system. On the other hand, I am for the 
creation of the free market sphere. I will always support this 
sort of cooperation," said Klaus in fluent Russian. 
  "First, operation is necessary, then follows the fitness 
centre and only afterwards one can attend the Olympic Games. We 
are in the fitness centre, while Russia remains on the surgery 
desk," said Klaus who arrived for a two-day visit to Russia 
today. 
  Asked about the prospects of the Czech-Russian economic 
cooperation, Klaus replied "the word cooperation belongs to the 
past, I care for business." 
  "We were experiencing cooperation for 40 years, and it was 
not useful for either country," he noted. 
  When asked by a student to comment on the economic situation 
in Russia, Klaus answered that as a premier of the foreign state 
he could not afford it. "After some lost elections I will gladly 
deliver a lecture on the issue," he said. 
  Academy leadership proposed today to Klaus to become 
honorary 
professor.

Vaclav Klaus, on a two-day visit to the Russian Federation since 
Monday [4 April], was received by Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin in the Kremlin today. The meeting was attended by 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
  Opening the meeting, Yeltsin stressed that the Russian-Czech 
treaty he and Czech President Vaclav Havel signed last August 
during Yeltsin's official visit to Prague was the basis of 
relations between Russia and the Czech Republic. 
  He said there were problems in Russian-Czech relations. 
"However, we seek to conform with the line of cooperation," he 
added. 
  No details about the half-hour meeting have been announced

  [Text] Moscow, April 5 (CTK) -- Czech Prime Minister 
Vaclav Klaus and his Russian counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin 
signed a Czech-Russian agreement on the support and protection 
of investments in Moscow today. 
  At the same time, they agreed that by the end of May their 
finance ministries would prepare the final agreement on the 
timetable for the liquidation of Russian debts to the Czech 
Republic and the methods to be used. 
  Representatives of the Czech Ministry of Trade and Industry 
and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Trade signed an 
inter-government protocol on mutual supplies of goods this year, 
in the premiers' presence. 
  Chernomyrdin, who earlier spent three and a half hours with 
Klaus at their unofficial "introductory meeting," said after 
today's talks that Russia was "very interested" in Czech 
economic reform. He said the Czech Republic had proceeded in 
its reform "further than all other East European countries." 
"This is not just our opinion but a general one. Russia has 
much to learn from the Czech experience," Chernomyrdin said. 
  He described today's talks as "good and positive." Relations 
between Russia and the Czech Republic would now be formed on a 
new basis," he added. 
  "I believe that we have essentially managed to define the 
main feature of the process regarding the Russian debt. The two 
countries' finance ministries have to prepare a definitive 
document by the end of May in which the dates and the methods of 
its solution will be defined," Klaus said. 
  Russia who has assumed responsibility for the former Soviet 
Union's debts, owes the Czech Republic a total of three billion 
U.S. dollars, to which may be added claims worth almost $400 
million which Czech partners have towards Russian firms. 
  According to a high-ranking Czech diplomat, Moscow, unlike 
in 
the past, today accepted all Russian debts towards the Czech 
Republic. Part of them will apparently be repaid on the 
principles of the Paris Club, the rest by deliveries of goods 
and through Czech participation in Russian privatization. 
  For the first time talks on debts have got moving and have 
proceeded from the level of general talks to the level of 
solving specific problems, the diplomat said. He said the fact 
that Russia has recently come to an approximately similar 
agreement with Hungary was encouraging. 
  Russian supplies of raw energy materials were also the 
subject of discussion, the diplomat said. The Russians 
expressed the desire to conclude a long-term agreement on oil 
supply with the Czech Republic. Klaus accepted the offer, 
adding that the question will for the time being be dealt with 
by experts from the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade and the 
Russian Ministry of Fuels and Energy. 
  According to a protocol on trade exchange signed today, this 
year Russia will deliver to the Czech Republic seven million 
tonnes of oil and 6.9 billion square meters of natural gas at 
world prices.

  [Text] Moscow, April 5 (CTK) -- Premier Vaclav Klaus said 
a positive result of his two-day working visit was agreement 
with his Russian partner on a definitive solution to the 
question of the Russian debt to the Czech Republic. 
  He also voiced his satisfaction with Russia's willingness to 
conclude long-term agreements on supplies of Russian oil and gas. 
  Klaus stressed that Czech-Russian relations could not be 
limited only to the past, regarding the debt, but it was 
necessary to deal with present and future in which the imports 
of gas and petrol were of great importance for the Czech 
Republic. Russia agreed in general with preparing long-term 
agreements on both raw materials, Klaus reported. 
  Klaus welcomed that he had agreed with Russian Premier 
Viktor 
Chernomyrdin on May 30 as the binding, final date by which the 
agreement on the schedule and form of payments of the Russian 
debt would be signed. 
  Klaus admitted that Russia offered to repay a part of its 
debt by means of exports of military equipment. He stressed 
that the Czech Republic was not interested in the purchase of 
new Russian weapons, while only import of spare parts to the 
present military equipment was feasible. 
  "I found the political and economic situation (in Russia) 
was 
a bit more stable than anticipated," noted Klaus.

  [Text] Tunis, March 31, RIA -- Russia informed Yasir 
'Arafat, PLO leader, that it was prepared to take part in the 
international peace-keeping force which guarantees security of 
Palestinians in Hebron, Boris Schiborin, Russian ambassador to 
Tunis, said today. 
  Meanwhile, the PLO leadership continues in emergency session 
in Tunis discussing the unprovoked killing of six Fatah 
officials by Israeli special troops in the Gaza Strip. No final 
decision has been made yet on the incident. 
  RIA learnt from a reliable source in the PLO headquarters 
that the current situation may disrupt the Cairo talks about 
security measures for an unlimited duration. The resumption of 
Palestinian- israeli talks will also be indefinitely postponed. 
There is nothing to discuss as long as the Israeli Government 
cannot control its army, a PLO spokesman said.

  [Text] Damascus, April 2, RIA -- Igor Ivanov, first deputy 
minister of foreign affairs (Russia), on visit to Syria, was 
received by President Hafiz al-Asad today to give him a written 
message from President Yeltsin. He made the following press 
statement after the talk: 
  "The detailed talks proceeded in a friendly atmosphere, 
traditional of Russian-Syrian relations, and concerned the 
entire range of bilateral cooperation issues. The parties 
expressed mutual will to step up contacts with practical content 
based on general understandings in the many fields of 
cooperation. The parties are willing to engage in a close and 
extensive political dialogue on topical international and 
regional problems. Practical steps have been earmarked to 
strengthen the trend for the build-up and effective 
implementation of the bilateral relations potential. 
  "The profound opinion exchange on the whole range of Mideast 
settlement confirmed the shared Russian and Syrian approaches to 
the necessity for dynamic movement toward a lasting, 
comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East, and early 
practical progress at the Syrian-Israeli and other directions of 
the negotiations. 
  "President al-Asad stressed the importance of Russia's role 
as co-chairman of the regional peace process and a great power 
with close historical links with the countries and nations of 
the region. The Russian side confirmed that Moscow views Syria 
as key partner in the context of peacemaking efforts. The 
parties agreed further to engage in regular contacts at all 
levels, and step up interaction on the basic aspects of the 
Mideastern situation. 
  "President al-Asad gratefully received President Yeltsin's 
message, and said that the Russian side's evaluations and 
arguments would serve the cause of strengthening the multi-sided 
Russian-Syrian relations, and guarantee peace and security in 
the Middle East."

  [Text] Khabarovsk, April 6, RIA -- A public committee to 
assist the demarcation of the Russian-Chinese border on the Amur 
and Ussuri Rivers has been established in Khabarovsk territory. 
"We have been forced to establish such an organisation to 
counter the attempts by other states to tear away Russian Far 
Eastern lands," learned Secretary of the Amur Geographic Society 
Valeriy Simakov told a RIA correspondent. "In particular we are 
concerned by the fact of the publication of an atlas of China's 
Heilungkiang Province where as Chinese territories are marked 
the Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy and Tarabarovy Islands, and also by 
their not being included in the plan of demarcation of the 
border." 
  Among the committee members are leading public and political 
figures of the territory, including geographers and historians.

  [Text] Alamaty (Kazakhstan), 1 Apr -- Kazakh President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev granted an interview to MAINICHI SHIMBUN on 
1 April and spoke about his expectations of his upcoming visit 
to Japan, which is scheduled to start on 6 April, as well as 
about his appeals concerning the disasters caused by nuclear 
exposure at the Semipalantinsk nuclear testing center and the 
serious environmental destruction caused by the continued drying 
up of the Aral Sea. 
  According to the president, 527 nuclear tests have been 
conducted at Semipalantinsk since 1949, and there are about half 
a million nuclear exposure victims. Even now, many cases of 
diseases or deaths caused by nuclear exposure are reported 
continuously, and psychological damage such as fear among 
pregnant women has continued. 
  However, the facts about the scale and frequency of nuclear 
tests have been veiled in secrecy. There are many unsolved 
questions, including the future effects of plutonium which has 
been stored in the earth. 
  The president severely criticized nuclear tests in the area 
of Semipalantinsk as "criminal acts committed by the [former] 
Soviet Union." On the other hand, he expressed the hope that 
Japan, which experienced atomic bombings at Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki, will cooperate with his country in the work to aid 
nuclear test victims. 
  The environmental destruction of the Aral Sea began in the 
1960's. Currently, three-quarters of the lake have dried up, 
and many residents have been left in the desert. Moreover, 
because a huge amount of salt has emerged on the surface in this 
area, there is a possibility that this will greatly affect the 
earth as a whole. The president, who has proposed an 
international conference on the Aral Sea issue, called for 
Japan's positive participation. 
  Touching on his idea of creating a Eurasian union, the 
president pointed out: "More than 300 mutual agreements have 
been adopted since the inauguration of the CIS. No practical 
results have been achieved, however." In stating his criticism, 
the president added, "Some CIS members have rejected some of 
these agreements and have interpreted the concepts of agreements 
according to their own interests." He stated that in following 
the good example of the European Union (EU), a new union should 
be formed composed of only those states which are determined to 
abide by all the mutual agreements, while the system of 
admitting quasimembers should be abolished.

Chairman of the Kyrgyz parliament M. Sherimkulov, arrived to 
Yerevan and met the RA [Republic of Armenia] President Levon

Kazimirov, who is also a member of the delegation, yesterday 
informed us that a new revised version of the initiative on 
resolving the conflict was presented to the sides. According to 
the new project, the sides should establish a cease fire in the 
first stage, they should take the troops apart next, and than 
develop mechanisms for preventing further resumption of military 
operations. The next stage of the project plans to withdraw the 
military equipment and troops from the occupied territories, 
lifting the transportation and communications blockade, return 
of refugees. Observers are planned to be placed in the conflict 
zone when all the mentioned is implemented.

  [Text] Stepanakert ("LRAGIR", "AZG" dailies), 03/30/94--The 
Azeri units shelled, using different weaponry, particularly 
Howitzers, mortars and armored infantry carriers, the Armenian 
positions in the Askeranskiy district and at the villages of 
Salakhli-Kengerli, Papravend, Shakbulakh and Novruzlu in the 
Agdamskiy district. The shelling started in the night of March 
29 and repeated at 8-11am in the morning. The Karabakh units 
retaliated in all cases, forcing the enemy to stop shelling. 
  A representative of the RMK [Republic of Mountainous 
Karabakh] Defense Army Political Department Rudolf Martirosyan 
rejected the information spread by the Azeri media on 
mercenaries from Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and the PKK [Kurdish 
Workers Party] groups who are ostensibly fighting at the 
Armenian side. According to the Political Department, such 
misinformation is spread in order to justify the participation 
of Afghan mojahedins, Russian and Ukrainian mercenaries fighting 
in the Azeri army.

  [Text] Yerevan ("Azg", "Hayastani Hanrapetutyun" dailies), 
04/05/94 -- Communications between the Armenian, Georgian and 
Baku dispatchers, the pilots of the flying-by Russian jet and 
the Iranian plane which crashed in Mountainous Karabakh on March 
17 are already available to Armenian authorities. According to 
these recordings, at 7:02 pm Greenwich time the plane was flying 
near Akstafa, contacted Tbilisi and informed they have a 20 km 
deviation and must return back. It nevertheless continued the 
flight and appeared near Dalyar (Ganja). Communications with 
the plane stopped at 7:12. The Azeri anti-air system has been 
controlling the plane when it passed over the Azeri territory. 
  Referring to the communique by the Iranian MFA [Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs], the RA [Republic of Armenia] acting 
presidential press secretary Levon Zurabyan said, there is no 
final explanation to the crash yet. "In addition to this", he 
stressed, "only 3-4 of the 17 stated questions were clarified". 
Meanwhile new questions appeared. It is known, for instance, 
that the airplane entered the Ganja-Mardakert-Stepanakert air 
route 15 minutes later, than it should according to the 
calculations. "It is not clear what the airplane has been doing 
in this period", said Levon Zurabyan. 
  Meanwhile the presidential press secretary again assured 
this 
accident will not affect the Armenian-Iranian relations and 
there should be no unclarified problems between the two 
countries. "Iran didn't take any punishment measures against 
Armenia", Mr. Zurabyan declared, answering questions of 
journalists.

<F P=106> ["Turkey Supplies Ammunition To the Azeri Army" -- ARAGIL </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Stepanakert ("LRAGIR", "AZG" dailies), 04/06/94 -- 
The situation at the RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] 
fronts is unchanged. As on previous days, the sides refrained 
from active military operations. Nevertheless, in spite of some 
pressure decrease, the Azeri units continue shelling the 
Armenian positions. 
  According to the RMK Defense Army headquarters, in the 
evening of April 4 and April 5 night the enemy units, stationed 
at the villages of Akhmedbeyli, Kerimbeyli (Berinbeyli (?) 
"AZG") and Arayatli in the Fizulinskiy district, shelled the 
Karabakh guardpoints at the villages of Mirzajamali and 
Karakhanbeyli. No casualties are reported. During the night 
and in the morning of April 5 the Azeri soldiers in the villages 
of Bashkervend, Afatli and Chemenli in the Agdamskiy district 
shelled, using mortars and large caliber machine- guns, the 
Karabakh defense positions at the villages of Geoytepe, Maksudlu 
and Seyidli. Again, no casualties are reported. The Karabakh 
side refrained from retaliating. Later in the afternoon on 
April 5 the enemy troops, stationed in the northern section of 
the Mardakertskiy district, which is currently controlled by the 
Azeris, particularly from the villages of Hasangaya, Karmiravan 
and Seisulan (Heyzalagh "AZG"), shelled, using different kinds 
of weaponry, the villages of Matagis, Magavuz and Aghabekalend. 
No casualties are reported. 
  According to the RMK military reconnaissance, active 
movements of the enemy manpower and military equipment is 
reported at several sections of the front. The specialists 
believe, these probably mean enemy's preparation to a new 
large-scale offensive. 
  According to a representative of the RMK Defense Army Rudolf 
Martirosyan, the shells recently launched by the Azeris in the 
Agdamskiy district have mostly been made in 1990 in Turkey. 
This is not the first case when the Azeri troops used 
Turkish-made weaponry in military operations. Mr. Martirosyan 
mentioned the recent events in Kelbadzharskiy in this regard: 
the Armenian soldiers found large ammunition stores containing 
Turkish-made shells and mines. In addition to this, the same 
sources report, some 200 "Grey Wolves" are currently fighting at 
some sections of the front. According to Mr. Martirosyan, 
Turkey's active military, political and financial aid to 
Azerbaijan shows once again that Turkey is going to continue 
interfering in the internal affairs of CIS countries.

  [Text] Kiev, April 7 -- Polish Defence Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk was received by President of Ukraine Leonid 
Kravchuk on Thursday, the second day of his visit to Kiev. 
  During the meeting, the two discussed political problems in 
Europe. Both sides stressed the importance of friendly contacts 
between Poland and Ukraine. 
  Earlier in the day, Minister Kolodziejczyk and Deputy Prime 
Minister Valeriy Shmarov agreed that the setting up of a joint 
Polish-Ukrainian bank would make cooperation between the two 
Defence Ministries easier. 
  The two also discussed U.N. peacekeeping missions and the 
"Partnership for Peace" initiative. The Polish side was 
informed that Ukraine is to send more of its soldiers in blue 
helmets to former Yugoslavia in the near future. 
  Ukraine, it was stressed during the meeting, does not intend 
to join any military bloc and thus treats "Partnership for 
Peace" initiative as a factor increasing security in Europe 
allowing for broader cooperation outside military alliances. 
  A group of Polish experts meeting with Ukrainian 
counterparts 
worked on details of technical cooperation. The Polish side is 
interested in missiles while the Ukrainians in small arms. They 
also discussed the possibility of establishing communication 
links between Polish and Ukrainian General Staffs.

  [Text] Kiev, April 2, RIA -- The candidates standing for 
uniting with Russia enjoy the greatest popularity in Ukraine. 
On the eve of the second tour of the parliamentary elections, 
48 percent of the constituents are ready to vote for them. Such 
are the results of the public poll in Ukraine conducted by the 
Democratic Initiatives Centre and the Institute of Sociology of 
the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. 
  A fifth of the polled believe that Ukraine can get out of 
the 
crisis only in a close political and economic union with Russia. 
Nearly every fourth Ukrainian thinks it necessary for the 
republic to join the rouble zone. 
  Twelve percent of the voters pin hopes on the bloc of the 
parties headed by ex-Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma and ex-Vice 
Speaker of the Parliament Vladimir Grinev who advocate the 
restoration of severed contacts with Russia. 
  Seventeen percent of the people do not believe anybody. The 
parties and organisations of Ukrainian nationalists are 
supported by only two percent of the voters.

<F P=106> [Rodrigo Fernandez report: "`Orientation Toward Russia Is </F>
Economic"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- Yevgeniy Saburov, the new head of 
government of the autonomous republic of Crimea, which forms 
part of Ukraine, was born in Yalta 48 years ago and belongs to 
the new batch of politicians who emerged in the final stages of 
perestroyka, but even among them he is an unusual politician: A 
poet, mathematician, and economist, he never belonged to the 
CPSU or joined another party when the Communist monopoly ended. 
An Orthodox believer, he was baptized in 1968, when to profess 
Christianity openly was a challenge to the Soviet regime. In 
the spring of 1991, Saburov was one of the chief ideologists and 
authors of the economic program which served as a basis for 
Boris Yeltsin's election program, when the latter ran as a 
candidate for the Russian presidency. He then became a Russian 
deputy prime minister and economy minister. Following his 
victory in the Crimean presidential election, Yuriy Meshkov 
offered him the premiership, which, to many people's surprise, 
Saburov accepted. According to him, Crimea's love of Russia and 
rejection of Ukraine has more economic than political reasons. 
  The economic situation in Crimea "is catastrophic," Saburov 
asserts, and Ukraine's current "communist leaders" are to blame. 
However, he denies that Crimea wishes to become independent and 
that it is demanding a revision of borders. "That entails the 
danger of bloodshed," he says. "What we do want is economic 
autonomy." Despite the tensions existing between Kiev and 
Simferopol, Saburov does not believe that the political 
situation could deteriorate to the extent of exploding into an 
armed conflict, as has happened elsewhere in the former USSR. 
  "The possibility of armed confrontations is slight, although 
it cannot be guaranteed that they will not occur, since, as 
recent history shows, man has something irrational in his 
behavior. But Crimea is not the Caucasus. The Crimeans have 
their eyes set on Europe, and they wish only to have a good 
living standard," he explains. More than tomorrow's elections 
to the local parliament and referendum, the important thing is 
the elections to the Ukrainian parliament -- also tomorrow -- 
believes Saburov, who also hopes that "the population will vote 
against the Communists." 
<H5>  Agreement Impossible </H5>
  "The current Ukrainian Government is acting very nervously, 
does not know what it wants, and tensions arise for ridiculous 
reasons," he complains. "It is completely impossible to reach 
an agreement with Kiev, because it does not then carry out what 
was agreed," said Saburov, who complains that Ukraine refuses to 
see "the hand which Meshkov has extended to it." 
  The Crimeans are extremely dissatisfied with Kiev's policy, 
since they see it as the cause of their problems. "The Crimean 
population's living standard is very low, but the peninsula's 
potential is very great. We must therefore conclude that 
somebody is to blame for the current situation. The problem is 
that Crimea's economy is bound to Russia. This is an objective 
fact: The sales market for Crimea's output -- goods and services 
-- is Russia," Saburov asserts. In the meantime, Kiev, through 
tariff barriers and a shortsighted taxation policy, has cut 
Crimea off from this market where it used to sell its grain, its 
vegetables, its wine.... The consumers of tourist services were 
also the Russians. "The whole of northern Russia used to spend 
its summer vacation in Crimea." 
  "Therefore, Crimea's orientation toward Russia is not a 
political but an economic matter," he states. 
  Another accusation leveled by the Crimeans against the 
Ukrainian leaders is that they "are still Communists and in fact 
are carrying out no reform," "Now it is usually said that 
wherever the democrats have come to power, the living standard 
is falling. But Ukraine's example shows that the fall in the 
living standard is not a result of the democrats' actions: The 
Ukrainian Government is not democratic and has carried out no 
reforms, but the fall in the living standard has been 
incomparably greater than in Russia," he declares.

  [Text] Moscow, April 5, RIA -- "The signing of 
Georgian-Abkhaz documents in Moscow on Monday laid the basis for 
future full-scale negotiations in Geneva on April 19," said Igor 
Akhba, Abkhazia's plenipotentiary representative in Moscow. In 
the political statement signed in Moscow, the Georgian and 
Abkhaz delegations acknowledged the existence of issues 
"pertaining to the sides' mutual competence" and demanding the 
division of powers, in Geneva, the main problem -- Abkhazia's 
political status, will be tackled. 
  Igor Akhba confirmed that the Abkhaz side was ready to 
deploy 
an international un peace-keeping contingent, above all from 
Russia, on its territory. But, he said, the maintenance of 
security and order on our territory is the internal affair of 
the Abkhaz state and will be decided by means of Abkhaz own 
law-enforcement bodies.

<F P=106> [Interview with Georgian leader and former Soviet Foreign </F>
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze by Giulietto Chiesa in Tbilisi; 
date not given: "Those Were the Days, in the Kremlin With 
Gorbachev"] 
  [Text] A marathon session in parliament, which has lasted 
until the evening, has just ended. It has borne a closer 
resemblance to a brawl than to a debate. I watched him at 
length as he listened: motionless, impassive, taking the floor 
briefly just to clarify a point now and again in his monotonous, 
colorless voice, as if he hoped it would have a pacifying 
effect. It is late evening by the time that, surrounded by a 
group of swaggering youths with bulging jackets and submachine 
guns that do nothing for the line of their double-breasted 
suits, he reaches his office on the fourth floor of the former 
Institute of Marxist Leninism. 
  [Chiesa] Eduard Amvrosyevich Shevardnadze, are you satisfied 
with your parliament? 
  [Shevardnadze] (laughing heartily) We are learning. What do 
you expect? Demagogy rules the day, but you cannot make the 
transition from totalitarianism to democracy without going 
through this stage. 
  [Chiesa] You were a leader in the USSR in 1989, in the days 
of the first relatively democratic parliament in Soviet history. 
Do you see any difference, any progress? 
  [Shevardnadze] There is greater pluralism, but apart from 
that I would not say that we have come much further. 
  [Chiesa] What balance can be drawn from the two years that 
have gone by since your triumphal return to Tbilisi? 
  [Shevardnadze] It is a complicated balance. I am worried 
because we have not solved the main problem, that of the 
territorial integrity of the country. The economic situation is 
extremely serious. As you have seen, we have a very poor 
standard of living. On the other hand, we have managed to avoid 
the worst, civil war on a major scale. 
  [Chiesa] Do you really regard this danger as a thing of the 
past? 
  [Shevardnadze] We shall have serious problems, of course, 
but 
there will not be a civil war. And we have established a lot of 
relations with the outside world; we have emerged from our 
isolation. 
  [Chiesa] The Shevardnadze effect ... 
  [Shevardnadze] No, I have merely made a contribution. It was 
very important that they should recognize us and help us. The 
people here have reached starvation point. If it were not for 
outside aid, from Russia, Kazakhstan, and the European 
countries, we should now be facing the threat of physical 
extinction. 
  [Chiesa] Nevertheless, opposition to you personally in 
parliament is very tough. They accuse you of losing Abkhazia, 
and what besides? 
  [Shevardnadze] A lot of these youngsters just want seats to 
warm. From time to time I am tempted to go home and leave them 
to it. Then I think to myself: They are my people. I cannot 
just abandon them. I would like to make way for the younger 
generation, but they are just the offspring of the city 
intelligentsia. First we have to build a solid foundation for 
those to come. There are now more than 100 parties, all 
microscopic, without power. That is why I decided to promote 
the "Citizens' Union," a movement that sets out to unite the 
responsible forces. Then we shall approve the constitution and 
organize fresh elections. I am also trying to ensure that a 
strong opposition party takes shape ... 
  [Chiesa] A two-party system? 
  [Shevardnadze] Yes, two or three parties, but serious ones. 
  [Chiesa] You are now president of parliament and head of 
state. Are you aiming for a presidential republic? 
  [Shevardnadze] Yes. For strong presidential powers and a 
strong parliament to counterbalance them. 
  [Chiesa] You have your eye on what is happening in Moscow, 
where the only powers, however, are presidential ... 
  [Shevardnadze] Yeltsin wanted a constitution that would 
guarantee the integrity of the state, and he got it. Perhaps he 
failed to deliver democratic guarantees. I shall bear other 
people's mistakes in mind. 
  [Chiesa] You have chosen Yeltsin and the Moscow democrats as 
your allies. What will happen if there is a changing of the 
guard in Moscow? 
  [Shevardnadze] In spite of all the difficulties, Boris 
Yeltsin still has great potential. If he manages to remain in 
office for his full term, I think that people will have time to 
understand democracy better. 
  [Chiesa] Tell me about your trip to the United States, 
where they are trying to remedy the decisions taken over the 
last few years. Did you get the impression that they understand 
what is happening in the former Soviet Union? 
  [Shevardnadze] They are analyzing the situation. I cannot 
say that they understand it fully, but often we ourselves do not 
fully understand what is happening here. I told them that a 
reversion to the cold war between Russia and the United States 
must be prevented at all costs, because it would bring the most 
reactionary forces in Russia onto the scene, and that would be a 
catastrophe. 
  [Chiesa] But I have the impression that there are some 
circles in the United States that want to cut Russia even 
further down to size. 
  [Shevardnadze] Maybe, but I only met sensible people. 
  [Chiesa] Anyway, there is no talk of UN blue helmets in 
Georgia. 
  [Shevardnadze] My view is that the Security Council cannot 
declare itself helpless to act. The secretary general of the 
United nations is a decent politician, but he has little 
understanding of the problems of the Caucasus. The world at 
large has little understanding of them, and when it becomes 
aware of them it will be too late. It is worse than the Balkans 
here. 
  [Chiesa] Anyway, the Americans will not be coming. Bill 
Clinton has made that much clear. Would you agree to Russian 
blue helmets? 
  [Shevardnadze] I have set out three alternative options: 
firstly, the traditional scenario, involving several countries 
including Russia, and it does not matter if Russia accounts for 
30 percent of the peacekeeping force or more; secondly, a 
Russian force under the auspices of the United Nations, although 
I doubt that this will be acceptable to the Security Council, 
and, thirdly, a request for Russian intervention, with observers 
sent by the United Nations. If all three come to nothing, there 
will be a war against Abkhazia. 
  [Chiesa] What about a UN force without Russians? 
  [Shevardnadze] No, it would make for confrontation between 
Russia and the United Nations, and there would be war in any 
case. There can be no final settlement of the dispute without 
Russian involvement. Indeed, I now bitterly acknowledge the 
mistake that I made when Abkhazia attacked and the Russians 
said, "We will send our troops in and reestablish order." I 
rejected their offer because I was convinced that we would be 
able to defend Sukhumi by ourselves. It was a mistake; I should 
have agreed. 
  [Chiesa] Have you ever regretted your decision to come back? 
  [Shevardnadze] I know I was crazy, but I knew what to 
expect. 
This is my country, and I want to share its fate. 
  [Chiesa] They say you have become religious ... 
  [Shevardnadze] I am a believer. I always have been deep 
down, even though communist ideology forbade it. 
  [Chiesa] And how are your relations with Gorbachev? 
  [Shevardnadze] We phone each other, though relatively rarely 
in recent times. I have always respected him. He is a great 
man, a moving force behind all these changes. We have also had 
our disagreements, but that does not diminish his merits. 
  [Chiesa] Of course, he was the one who changed your life. 
  [Shevardnadze] Yes. It came as a surprise. He called me and 
announced that he was going to put my name forward for a high 
foreign policy office, but he did not specify which. I objected 
that I had no experience. What I really thought was that he 
wanted to propose me as secretary to the central committee on 
international policy, but the next day he called me back and 
said distinctly, "We will propose a new office of major 
importance to Andrey Gromyko." I repeated that I thought it 
would be a mistake and that ministries such as defense, foreign 
affairs, and the KGB could be held exclusively by Russians. I 
added that I could not merely play an executive role. But he 
had already spoken to the whole politburo, and the decision had 
in fact already been taken. 
  [Chiesa] With hindsight, how do you judge that decision? 
  [Shevardnadze] I remember that the first time I went to the 
ministry, I was on my own. I had never been there before. I 
told the board: "Gromyko was like a great ship sailing the 
ocean, and in comparison Eduard Shevardnadze was just a dinghy, 
but a dinghy with an engine." They all laughed. That is how I 
began. And difficult decisions were taken, on Afghanistan, on 
tactical missiles, on strategic missiles. In the beginning it 
was easy, then the attacks began and we had to come out 
fighting. But Shevardnadze's handwriting was already clearly 
visible in those decisions. It was rather a thrill to see that 
what you said one day had actually happened the day after. The 
West met us halfway. Those were great, historic times. They 
were the best years of my life.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Kulagin] </F>
  [Text] Almaty 6 April, TASS -- Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev spoke of the need for streamlining the earlier 
government anti-crisis programme and perking up economic reform 
at a meeting on Tuesday with other republican leaders on the eve 
of his visit to Japan. 
  Following the introduction of national currency four and a 
half months ago, the Kazakh leader and the government issued 
over 200 decrees, decisions and instructions of normative and 
executive nature. However, the president claims, there is no 
system and purposefulness in implementing mapped-out measures. 
  Activities of ministries and the government are not 
coordinated enough to draft normative and executive documents 
and to organise their practical implementation. 
  Nazarbayev made some important proposals aimed at 
accelerating the compilation of a programme to step up reforms. 
In the president's opinion, prime attention should be given to 
raising prestige and improving the operation of executive organs 
and state bodies of administration. 
  The president noted that it is necessary to synthesize all 
channels of financial aid from international organisations and 
foreign countries received under the state's auspices by areas, 
economic sectors and social spheres of the republic as well as 
to hammer out the main principles and mechanisms of its use, 
including state structures and other institutions responsible 
for the implementation of projects and the return of credits and 
loans received for their implementation. 
  The president also noted the expediency to compile 
indicative 
five-year plans starting with 1995, to step up support for 
privatisation processes and holding structures giving them 
greater freedom of actions, to promote the development of 
consumer goods production, to boost volumes of processing 
agricultural produce and to restructure the operation of the 
statistical system which orients itself, as before, only on the 
state sector and, therefore, does not give a real picture of the 
republican economy. 
  The president specially stressed that, taking into 
consideration the present situation and still entertaining hopes 
for the integration within the Commonwealth of Independent 
States, the Republic should rely, above all, on its own 
capabilities. Kazakhstan must survive in any case, using its own 
potential. 
  The programme to pep up the economic reform will be adopted 
in April after its improvement. The president also plans this 
month to examine issues of privatisation, adjustment of social 
programmes, housing policy and a drive against crime.

  Japan agreed to grant a 220-million dollar credit to 
Kazakhstan which pledged to continue market reforms, attract 
foreign investments and improve economic legislation. 
  Japan also welcomed that Kazakstan, one of the four former 
Soviet nuclear republics, had joined the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty as a nuclear-free state. The parties 
agreed to cooperate in accelerating the solution of issues 
connected with the elimination of nuclear weapons in Kazakhstan.

  [Text] Tokyo 7 April, TASS -- The Japanese Government will 
soon beging insuring businesses conducting foreign economic 
transactions with Kazakhstan, Japanese Minister of Foreign Trade 
and Industry Hiroshi Kumagai said. 
  The announcement was made during Kumagai's meeting with 
visiting Kazakh Vice-Prime Minister Syzdyk Abishev who is 
accompanying Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev on his 
official visit to Japan. 
  The Japanese-Kazakh project to modernise the metallurgic 
plant in Karaganda will be the first to be insured by Japan. 
There are also plans to extend state insurance to a new oil 
pipeline to be built in Kazakhstan. However, this will become 
possible only if the Kazakh government provides firm guarantees 
of credit payments to Japanese companies. 
  Abishev called on Japan to double investments in the Kazakh 
economy, adding that the Republic has only three joint ventures 
with the participation of Japanese capital. Kumagai expressed 
the hope that Japanese companies will boost investments in 
Kazakhstan if it creates favourable conditions for foreign 
investors.

  [Text] Tokyo 7 April, TASS-KAZTAG -- Japan and Kazakhstan 
are ready to pool efforts to implement Alma-Ata's initiative and 
convene a conference on interaction and confidence-building in 
Asia similar to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev and Japan's 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said during their talks in 
Tokyo on Thursday. 
  Their meeting was held in the official residence of the head 
of the Japanese Government. It covered a wide array of 
political and economic items. As concerns the situation in 
Central Asia, Kazakhstan's president noted that Kazakhstan, 
Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have to pursue a tough domestic 
policy in order to avert the spread of conflicts similar to that 
in Tajikistan throughout the region. As regards the domestic 
situation in Kazakhstan, Nazarbayev described it as politically 
stable. 
  Nazarbayev called for expanding the scale of economic 
integration in Asia as a whole and asked Tokyo to come forth 
with an initiative for the organisation of a common continental 
market. He stressed his country's readiness to serve as a base 
for Tokyo's penetration to Central Asian markets. 
  The president said that he is ready to give Japan preference 
in realizing major economic projects on the territory of his 
republic. For this purpose he suggested that Morihiro Hosokawa 
and himself set up a joint commission to prepare this important 
move. 
  The Japanese prime minister assured Alma-Ata of his 
invariable support for the transformations underway in 
Kazakhstan and said the projects named by Kazakhstan in the 
field of economic cooperation require a detailed study by 
Japan's leadership.

  Speaking to reporters he said his people, like the Japanese, 
had suffered from nuclear weapons. 
  "If Japan faced an open nuclear attack, the (former) USSR 
used the weapons against Kazakhstan in peace time by conducting 
a total of 527 tests" at the Semipalatinsk range, he said, 
adding that over 100 of them were ground and air explosions. 
  Nearly half a million of people of Kazakhstan were affected 
by the blasts, according to Nazarbayev.

  [Text] Presidential spokesman Imankadyr Rysaliyev in a 
statement in Bishkek on Thursday has praised the pace of 
Kyrgystan's [Kyrgyzstan's] economic reforms. 
  He said the rate of inflation in March ran at 5 percent. Low 
inflation and stable currency, he said, are setting conditions 
for economic growth. 
  The statement says if the policy of economic reforms and 
financial austerity is maintained "for the next six months at 
least," good incentives will be created for the inflow of 
foreign investment and Kyrgyzstan is justified in expecting an 
upsurge of economic activity soon. Rysaliyev believes "now is 
the time to think of how to sell what is produced and to avert 
any possible glut in the domestic market."

  [Text] [No dateline as received] Russia will face new 
ordeals in forthcoming months, announced the Russian president 
adviser and politologist Andranik Migranyan, appearing at a 
meeting with professorial staff of the Yerevan University. As 
reports the "HAYASTAN" newspaper today, Migranyan has grounded 
such a perspective on a fact that Russia experiences now an 
economic instability, so that important and cardinal decisions 
are expected in the nearest two months to lead the country out 
of crisis. He told that emergency measures introduction in 
economy and industry is being discussed already for some time in 
the government circles. 
  Migranyan estimated as nearly 40 percent the democrats' 
votes 
in Russian Duma, while there is no yet unity among the rights, 
he said. The politologist negatively characterized the 
Nazarbayev's idea of Eurasian Union, calling this initiative a 
"political bluff". 
  Speaking of the Karabakh problem, Migranyan expressed an 
opinion that the consistent policy of Russia will ultimately 
result in a settlement of conflict. However to reach this 
objective the involved parties shall not assume delirious ideas 
as their starting point, but show instead the readiness for 
compromise.

<F P=106> [Report by NOYAN-TAPAN: "Deserters Should Not Expect a </F>
Peaceful Future"] 
  [Text] The problem of calling up reservists in Armenia for 
a training session was the topic of a television interview given 
by Vazgen Sarkisyan, Republic of Armenia minister of state and 
chairman of the military draft commission. Noting that the 
previous call-up was "a complete success," he touched on the 
problem of desertion. According to him, the names of all 
deserters are known, and if they have not yet been punished it 
is because these are difficult times and everybody is too busy 
to look for them. The time will come, however, when they all 
will face the court. He said that all measures have been taken 
to keep deserters from leaving the territory of the 
republic--"for this contingent, the airport is closed." Interpol 
is involved, and with its help those deserters that have left 
Armenia may be returned. "There is no forgiveness for them; they 
do not have a peaceful future--they will not be able to live, 
work, or study with impunity. Moreover, they will be 
`blacklisted.'" Vazgen Sarkisyan promised that chairmen of rayon 
councils who will not ensure that the call-up process proceeds 
smoothly will themselves be called up for service.

<F P=106> [GOLOS ARMENII report: "Dzhilavyan Has Not Been Arrested"] </F>
  [Text] The editors have received a statement from Moscow 
issued by the press secretariat of the International Armenian 
Assembly [IAA], which reads as follows: 
  "On 30 March ERKIR published a report that IAA President 
Serzh Dzhilavyan had been arrested. 
  "Serzh Dzhilavyan has not been arrested. This morning, 31 
March, press service staff members talked to Serzh Dzhilavyan, 
who was at home at the address published by ERKIR--4 
Michurinskiy Avenue, where Serzh Dzhilavyan allegedly had been 
arrested. 
  "Moreover, on 30 March Serzh Dzhilavyan held a press 
conference in which he made the following statement: `As is 
known, I have handed over to Moscow law enforcement authorities 
the terrorists who, on assignment from the Republic of Armenia 
MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], were supposed to assassinate 
me last fall. Law enforcement officers of various rank and from 
different services spent almost the entire night in my home, 
questioning the suspects and examining their weapons. 
  "`The suspects were taken away, but the weapons for some 
reason were left behind, despite my subsequent numerous 
reminders and insistence that the weapons be removed. 
  "`Now there is no doubt that the Moscow law enforcement 
organs' "forgetfulness" was deliberate at the prompting of the 
Armenian MVD. The weapons were needed in order to organize 
another provocation against me--to accuse me of illegal 
possession of weapons. However, this time, again, it did not 
work. 
  "`I am not so naive as to not understand the purpose of 
these 
provocations. It is the hand of official Yerevan that has 
reached me in Moscow. 
  "`Being an entrepreneur and with preferences leaning toward 
charitable activities, I have tried to stay away from politics. 
I believe, however, that I can no longer remain passive. I 
declare that I consider myself from now on in political 
opposition to the current Armenian authorities and intend to run 
in the presidential elections in the Republic of Armenia.'"

out of Tskhinvali [administrative center of south Ossetia] in 
order to prevent narcotic substances from coming into the 
republic from the northern Caucasus.

<F P=106> [Report by Anatol Awcharenka] </F>
  [Excerpts] My visit to Minsk was extremely positive. This 
is how UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali assessed his 
meetings, negotiations, and talks [in Belarus], speaking at a 
conference with journalists at the National Press Center on 7 
April. In the course of a three-day visit, seven concrete 
issues were discussed at different levels with a Foreign 
Ministry delegation, at the Council of Ministers, and the 
Supreme Soviet. All of these issues are very important and 
urgent for Belarus, but the primary one is the problem stemming 
from the Chernobyl catastrophe. Mr. Butrus-Ghali arrived in our 
country to see what Chernobyl is, in reality. It is no secret 
that some countries are displaying weariness and losing interest 
in Chernobyl's problems. I am sure that the Belarusian side 
managed to provide the secretary general with convincing data 
contained in both the national report on Chernobyl and a special 
memorandum. These documents provide the most recent figures, 
the most current information. [passage omitted] 
  In the course of talks, both sides discussed measures to be 
taken to prevent the world community from reducing its 
involvement in alleviating the consequences of the Chernobyl 
accident. However, as was underlined at a news conference held 
by Belarusian Foreign Minister Pyotr Krawchanka, it will be 
impossible to fully eliminate the aftermath of the accident in 
this century. 
  The Belarusian side can also consider the general 
secretary's 
visit a success because it was attended by the director of the 
Economic Commission for European Affairs. His participation in 
the negotiations was not coincidental. In my opinion, his 
arrival in Belarus demonstrated to our government that the 
United Nations is ready to help Belarus survive its transitional 
phase and integrate into the world, or at least the European 
economy. Mr. Butrus-Ghali suggested that our Republic take part 
in peacekeeping operations in various regions of the world. The 
general secretary said: We would be very grateful to you if 
Belarus could provide at least a small contingent of blue 
helmets. He was told that under current legislation, only the 
Supreme Soviet can decree Belarusian servicemen's participation 
in operations outside the Republic. If the situation were to 
change, we could assist the United Nations in keeping peace 
around the world. 
  The UN and Belarusian delegations also discussed the 
situation of Belarusian ethnic minorities in Latvia and Estonia. 
Mr. Butrus-Ghali treats this problem very seriously, and that 
is why the two sides agreed that the Laotian envoy, who is the 
UN Supreme Commissary, will come to Minsk and receive data on 
this complex problem, which is persistently plaguing us. The 
envoy will then visit the Baltic states to contribute to 
resolving the problem of national minorities, including 
Belarusians, in Latvia and Estonia. [passage omitted] 
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has left for 
Geneva.

<F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM-TASS correspondent Lidiya Peresypkina] </F>
  [Text] Minsk 7 April, TASS -- A ceremony of handing over 
the equipment of the American moth balled military hospital 
worth over 8 million U.S. dollars to Belarus was held at the 9th 
Clinical Hospital in Minsk on Thursday. 
  The Belarusian public learned about this valuable present 
from the U.S. Government to the republic which had badly 
suffered from the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power 
station, during U.S. President Bill Clinton's recent visit to 
Minsk. The President's wife, Hillary Clinton, visited then the 
4th Children's Clinical Hospital in the Belarussian capital, met 
with medical workers and organizers of public health and 
familiarized herself with the needs of Belarussian medical 
institutions. That is why the equipment packed in 130 
containers, 20 tons each, includes unique surgical furniture and 
roentgen apparatuses, refrigerators and microscopes, and special 
beds for patients. Apart from the 9th clinic, this equipment 
will be received by the 4th Children's Clinic, well known to the 
U.S. side, the Research Institute of Radiation Medicine and the 
Minsk first-aid hospital. 
  The U.S. Government has been rendering humanitarian aid to 
Belarus on a regular basis lately which is estimated at over 100 
million U.S. dollars. 
  Still, the handing over of this considerable humanitarian 
cargo is a very important fact for many reasons. First, medical 
workers of the Republic received valuable and unique equipment 
which this country cannot afford to buy. Second, the process of 
the delivery of this humanitarian cargo became a bridge of 
friendship between the two armies as from both sides the cargo 
was dispatched and received by people in a military uniform. In 
addition, during the transportation of the cargo help was 
rendered by marines from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
North Ireland. 
  Some 30 young U.S. servicemen headed by Major-General of the 
Medical Service Michael Scotty, arrived in Belarus and now 
together with their Belarusian colleagues are not only receiving 
the cargo but also training Belarusian medical workers to handle 
the equipment unfamiliar to them. 
  During the ceremony of presenting the humanitarian aid 
General Michael Scotty noted that for the first time during his 
30 years of service he was handing over the Army property not 
for military but for peaceful purposes.

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified BELINFORM correspondent for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Minsk 7 April, TASS -- Belarusian Parliament Speaker 
Mechyslaw Hryb called for restoration of full-fledged economic 
ties with Russia as a way of pulling the former Soviet Republic 
out of the global crisis, of halting output decline and curbing 
inflation. 
  Addressing on Thursday a meeting in Vitebsk with regional 
law-enforcement officers, the parliament chairman came out in 
favour of rebuilding a single industrial, energy, market and 
trade space with Russia, as well as of a single monetary system 
based on the Russian rouble. Hryb noted that Russia was the 
main supplier of energy resources and of a great variety of 
component parts for the Belarusian economy. 
  When asked whether there was any alternative to a treaty 
with 
Russia, the speaker said: "First, we could agree to lift all 
customs barriers and duties, and then go ahead with further 
moves, bearing in mind that both economic and political 
sovereignty of the Belarusian state should be kept intact. This 
means that the Belarusian budget should by no means merge with 
that of Russia, nor the Republic's national bank can be 
absorbed," Hryb stressed.

<F P=106> [Report by Valentin Zhdanko from Minsk under the "Belarus" </F>
rubric: "Mr. Kebich Wants To Be President. He Thinks That the 
End Justifies the Means"] 
  [Text] The number of potential candidates for the 
Republic's presidency is growing by the day, but the most 
probable rivals whose names are set to be included on the ballot 
are three: Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, [former] speaker 
Stanislav Shushkevich, and Aleksandr Lukashenko, director of a 
state-owned farm in Mogilev Oblast, who heads the government 
anticorruption commission. 
  The candidates have already engaged in a struggle that 
sometimes takes on risky forms, with Mr. Kebich setting the 
tone. On the evening of 5 April, Aleksandr Lukashenko's office 
at Government House was sealed. This was done on the pretext 
that the ad hoc anticorruption commission had completed its 
mission and should be dissolved. At the same time, most 
commission members have announced that they are quitting it. 
However, there has been no Supreme Soviet decision on the 
subject. Mr. Lukashenko himself has promised to fight to the 
bitter end and is intent on staying on as commission chairman 
regardless of who its members will be. The incident of sealing 
the main corruption fighter's office was immediately described 
by Aleksandr Lukashenko's supporters as schemes by "a corrupt 
government." 
  Mr. Kebich also made a harsh attack against his other 
dangerous rival, Stanislav Shushkevich. Colonel Zametalin, the 
prime minister's press secretary, issued a statement calling the 
former speaker's candidacy "the most controversial and 
inconsistent one, prone to political flirtation." Mr. 
Shushkevich was accused by the press secretary of "demoralizing 
the Supreme Soviet by having turned it from a legislature into a 
debating society." As an example, he cited the fact that the 
parliament has been unable to pass the Constitution for two 
years. Only upon the arrival of a new speaker was the 
Fundamental Law adopted. 
  None of the candidates has a clear edge at this stage. The 
current prime minister's chances may receive a strong boost, 
however, if the money systems of Belarus and Russia are unified. 
The government is doing its utmost these days to accelerate the 
process.

  [Text] Azerbaijan has reacted positively to a new 
mediation initiative of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly and 
the Republic of Belarus in settling the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
conflict, and hopes that this will make it possible to stop the 
bloodshed. The press secretary of the president of the republic, 
Tofik Abbasov, told this to an AZER-TADZH correspondent. He 
emphasized that Azerbaijan's position remains constructive and 
is fully based on commonly accepted norms of international law 
in keeping with the resolution of the UN Security Council on a 
cease-fire, the withdrawal of all Armenian armed formations from 
occupied territories, and the conduct of peace negotiations. The 
principle of inviolability of borders and territorial integrity 
of states is a political reality, on which the entire system of 
modern international relations is built, and no one will be able 
to ignore this reality through use of violent means.

  [Text] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev today received a 
delegation headed by 'Ali Abdol 'Alizadeh, governor-general of 
East Azerbaijan. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Akif Tevekguloglu] After 
achieving independence, Azerbaijan had the opportunity to expand 
economic, political, and cultural ties with many countries. 
Relations between Azerbaijan and Iran--which are closely related 
historically, religiously, and linguistically--have entered a 
new stage. However, it must be noted that not all the 
opportunities are being used to develop the brotherly and 
friendly ties between Azerbaijan and Iran. 
  In expressing these views during the talks with the guests, 
Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev also noted that there are no 
more obstacles before the Azerbaijani people to develop ties 
with Iran, and the border settlements and cities in both 
countries should play a major role in this task. 
  [Aliyev] Azerbaijani lands bordering on Iran should play an 
important role if the ties between Azerbaijan and Iran are to be 
improved and expanded. Both the Azerbaijani and Iranian border 
regions are important. Undoubtedly, Iran's territory is large 
and it has large provinces in the border regions. Azerbaijan's 
territory is small compared to Iran and most of it borders with 
Iran. However, the border regions both on the Azerbaijani and 
Iranian side are playing a major role in the development of ties 
between us. That is, they occupy an important place. 
  In this regard, East Azerbaijan, the general-governor of 
which is my friend Abdol 'Alizadeh, and hence the city of 
Tabriz, occupy an important place in this. When I was still in 
Nakhichevan and you were in Tabriz, we had the same opinion, and 
in developing and broadening the ties between Nakhichevan and 
with Iran, particularly through Eastern Azerbaijan and Tabriz, 
we were pursuing the aim of developing the ties between Iran and 
Azerbaijan in general. 
  [Tevekguloglu] Speaking on behalf of his delegation, 'Ali 
Abdol 'Alizadeh thanked President Geydar Aliyev for the 
reception. He noted that we deeply feel the profound suffering 
experienced by Azerbaijan and we believe that you are capable of 
extracting the people from the existing grave situation. The 
Iranians are impatiently waiting for your visit. They would be 
extremely pleased to see you in Tehran and Tabriz. 
  The guests then proposed that Baku and Tabriz be formally 
declared sister cities. 
  Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev gladly accepted this 
proposal. 
  Afiaddin Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of the Azerbaijan 
Supreme 
Soviet; State Adviser Vafa Gulizade; and Iranian Ambassador to 
Iran 'Ali Akbar Nahavandian were present at the meeting. [end 
recording] 
  Chairman of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Rasul Guliyev 
today received the visiting Iranian delegation headed by 
Governor-General 'Ali Abdol 'Alizadeh. 
  The chairman of the Supreme Soviet briefed the guests on the 
Azerbaijani president's position on the socio-political 
situation in the Republic, on exceedingly serious problems in 
our Republic arising from Armenia's aggression, and on the need 
to establish peace in the region and condemn the aggressor. 
  Rasul Guliyev noted that the Azerbaijani president is giving 
great importance to the future development of 
Azerbaijani-Iranian ties and pointed out the urgency of using 
all possible means to develop ties between our peoples, who are 
closely tied to one another with historical, religious, and 
cultural roots. 
  He also highly assessed Iran's selfless assistance to the 
Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, which has been placed under a 
blockade by Armenia, and the assistance provided to the refugees 
by the neighboring country. 
  Mr. Abdol 'Alizadeh expressed his views on Iran's positions 
on the Armenian aggression and on future development of ties 
between the two countries. 
  A number of other problems of mutual interest were also 
discussed during the meeting. 
  Iranian Ambassador to Azerbaijan 'Ali Akbar Nahavandian and 
other officials participated in the meeting. 
  The delegation of Iran's East Azerbaijan Province was also 
received today by the Deputy Chairman of the Azerbaijani Supreme 
Soviet Afiaddin Dzhalilov. Representatives of Azerbaijani 
ministries, governmental departments, and firms participated in 
the meeting. 
  Afiaddin Dzhalilov noted that important documents on further 
developing the ties between the two countries were signed during 
Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's visit to Baku some months 
ago. Such visits have a positive effect on the implementation 
of the signed agreements. 
  Mr. Abdol 'Alizadeh, the governor-general of Iran's East 
Azerbaijan Province, said that he was pleased with the 
development of the ties between the two countries. He noted 
that these ties are now entering a new stage and that Iran will 
take important steps in this direction. 
  The Iranian border delegation visited the martyrs mausoleum 
to honor the memory of those martyred for Azerbaijan's 
independence and territorial integrity.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Pavel Bogomolov: "Baku Envoy on </F>
the Thames"] 
  [Text] London, 5 Apr -- Makhmud Mamed Guliyev, Azerbaijan 
ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Britain, has 
presented his credentials to Queen Elizabeth II. The process of 
establishing bilateral diplomatic relations has thus officially 
been completed. Following the embassies of the Russian 
Federation, Ukraine, and Armenia, the embassy of the Caspian 
state becomes the latest full-scale diplomatic mission of the 
CIS countries on the banks of the Thames. 
  Baku is now linked by a weekly direct flight by the 
Azerbaijan Airways company with London's Gatwick Airport. This 
helps to activate bilateral business relations within whose 
framework mutually advantageous agreements and contacts have 
recently been signed between Transcaucasus enterprises, 
associations, and firms, and well known companies like "Kayzer 
[name as transliterated] Engineers," "Morrison Construction," 
"British Telecom," "Datacom," and "GPT." Talks are continuing 
on the forthcoming conclusion of a "deal of the century" aimed

<F P=106> ["Text" of a decree issued by President Geydar Aliyev on 5 </F>
April -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Reaching a turning point in improving the Republic's 
economy through the broad application of market mechanisms and 
broadening mutually beneficial trade and economic relations with 
foreign countries and companies are the main directions of the 
State's economic policy. 
  Considering the need to deepen economic reforms, increase 
productivity in foreign trade and economic relations, promote 
and improve exports, and liberalize the activity of exporting 
establishments, encouraging them to contribute toward improving 
the Republic's foreign currency reserves and export potential, I 
have decided: 
  1. All legally authorized persons be allowed to export 
strategically important products. Considering the income from 
the sale of products abroad and the legal amount to be used from 
that income to improve the Republic's integrated foreign 
currency fund, the sale of the minimum volume of strategically 
important products in return for convertible foreign monetary 
units in 1994 be established and approved. 
  2. Regarding the effort to be made to liberalize the export 
of strategically important products, the volume of domestic need 
for those products in 1994 be established and approved so that 
the demand of the establishments and organizations can be met. 
The producers will be directly responsible for the sale of the 
established amount of strategically important products in return 
for convertible foreign monetary units and for the supply of the 
established amount of products for domestic needs. 
  3. The financial resources to be created through the sale of 
strategic or nonstrategic products be transferred to the 
Republic's integrated foreign currency fund without delay. The 
sale of the Republic's products in return for convertible 
foreign monetary units be effected either on the basis of 
advance payments or in accordance with irrevocable letters of 
credit so that the financial resources to be created through the 
sale of the Republic's products can be used to realize the most 
important social and economic projects and to meet the most 
urgent needs of the people. 
  4. The committee responsible for Azerbaijan's customhouse 
offices be instructed to allow those who will be legally 
authorized to export Azerbaijan's products to export their 
commodities in return for convertible foreign monetary units 
only if they possess documents from pertinent banks confirming 
that the commodities to be exported have either been paid for in 
advance or are covered by letters of credit. 
  5. The state establishments and organizations be instructed 
to sell their products either by putting out contracts for 
bidding or through the Republic's stock markets to guarantee the 
market value of their products. 
  6. The Azerbaijani Council of Ministers draw up and approve 
the new norms and levels of the allocations to be made from the 
funds created through exports and other trade activities to the 
Republic's integrated foreign currency fund within 10 days, 
ensure that, as a rule, the state establishments and 
organizations sell their products either on the basis of 
contracts that will be put out for bidding or through the 
Republic's stock markets so that the prices of products can be 
established in accordance with the demand in the markets, and 
prepare and approve the rules for the reorganization of foreign 
trade within seven days. The Council of Ministers draw up and 
approve a new tariff system for energy consumption to increase 
the Republic's export potential and seriously reduce fuel and 
other forms of energy consumption. Considering the increasing 
rate of inflation, the Council of Ministers rearrange the sale 
prices of fuel and other forms of energy in the Republic once 
every three months so that the productivity of the fuel and 
energy supply complex can be improved. To simplify customhouse 
procedures, obstruct the violation of laws, and establish 
discipline in that field, the Council of Ministers approve the 
listed documents required for exports and imports within seven 
days. It must be noted that those who are legally authorized to 
export or import commodities will not be asked to submit any 
document other than those listed for customhouse procedures. 
  7. The Azerbaijan National Bank be recommended to draw up 
and implement the measures that are required to establish the 
manat's domestic value to allow the money market among the banks 
to function properly. Regarding the need to stimulate exports, 
the Azerbaijan National Bank be recommended to give priority to 
producer establishments, which sell products to foreign 
countries, when exchanging manats for other currencies, 
systematically supervise the foreign currency operations by the 
commercial banks in accordance with the existing laws, and see 
to it that the allocations to be made from the funds, which are 
acquired by the authorized exporters and importers, to the 
Republic's integrated foreign currency fund in accordance with 
the established norms are transferred on time. 
  8. A state committee be established to supervise foreign 
economic relations so that the foreign economic work in the 
Republic can be organized and the productivity of trade 
activities can be increased. That committee be empowered to 
authorize barter agreements for products that are of strategic 
importance to the Republic. Appointments to the state committee 
be as follows: 
  a. First deputy prime minister be chairman. 
  b. Deputy prime minister and minister of economy. 
  c. Minister of finance. 
  d. Minister of foreign economic relations. 
  e. Chairman of the State Committee for Customhouses. 
  f. Director of the State Main Inspectorate for Taxes. 
  g. Chairman of the Azerbaijan National Bank Executive 
Committee. 
  h. Chairman of the Azerbaijan International Shares and 
Commerce Bank [Azerbaijan Sehimdar Komnisya Beynelhak Banki]. 
  The state committee be instructed to study the agreements 
concluded by individual establishments and organizations for 
imports and exports and inform Azerbaijan's president and prime 
minister about the Republic's foreign trade situation at least 
once a month. 
  9. The chairman of the state committee be instructed to draw 
up the rules and regulations of the State Committee for 
Supervision on Foreign Economic Relations and submit them for 
the president's approval within two weeks. 
  10. A provision in paragraph 2 of the decree the president 
issued on 10 January 1994 to improve Azerbaijan's foreign trade 
says that the export of strategically important products be 
subject to the president's approval. That provision be regarded 
as null and void. 
  11. The Azerbaijan Council of Ministers adopt decisions for 
the implementation of this decree. 
  [Signed] Geydar Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan. 
  [Dated] Baku, 5 April 1994

  [Text] As the agency INTERFAX-Ukraine learned, at their 
meeting on 7 April Polish Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejdzyk 
and Ukraine's Vice Premier Valeriy Shmarov discussed the 
possibility of mutual shipments of military equipment and 
weapons. The parties approved the idea to create a 
Ukrainian-Polish bank to finance the programs related to repair 
of military equipment and conversion. 
  On 6 April in Kiev, Polish Defense Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejdzyk met with the Machine Building, Military-Industrial 
Complex, and Conversion Minister Dmitriy Chernenko and discussed 
the possibility of Ukraine's participation in the modernization 
and repair of the Polish-used military equipment. 
  Dmitriy Chernenko reported to INTERFAX-Ukraine that the 
meeting was held on the initiative of the Polish side and 
covered issues related to cooperation between Poland's Defense 
Ministry and Ukraine's Machine Building, Military-Industrial 
Complex, and Conversion Ministry. 
  Currently the Polish Army is primarily armed with the 
military equipment produced in the former USSR. According to 
experts, Poland can now procure about 40 percent this equipment 
from Ukraine. Ukraine also has great know-how in the sphere of 
repairing military equipment and, in particular, aircraft. 
  The parties expressed interest in possible cooperation in 
the 
field of conversion in order to conclude contracts with the 
conversion enterprises in Dnepropetrovsk. 
  On 6 April, Vitaliy Radetskyy and Piotr Kolodziejdzyk, 
Ukrainian and Polish Defense Ministers discussed the possibility 
of joint maneuvers in the bordering regions and cooperation in 
the sphere of air defense. 
  In the course of negotiations in Kiev the parties reached an 
agreement that expert groups of their rspective military 
departments will hold consultations on technical maintenance and 
logistic support. 
  As Radetskyy underlined in his interview with the national 
radio, "today the Ukrainian and Polish Armies are practically 
facing identical tasks."

  [Text] If the Polish-Ukrainian talks provide good results 
on such delicate issues as defense, this testifies to the fact 
that relations between our people and states are based on 
understanding and confidence. This was said by Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk during a meeting with Polish Defense 
Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk. The head of the Ukrainian state 
and the chief of the Polish defense department discussed a wide 
range of issues concerning deepening [word indistinct] 
cooperation, including defense, as well as protecting peace and 
stability in the region. 
  The official visit of the Polish Armed Forces delegation to 
Ukraine continues. Today, the Polish servicemen also met with 
Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, and visited the Kiev 
Military Institute of Administration and Communication and the 
Antonov Scientific Technical Center.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko </F>
by Myroslav Levytskyy: "Ukraine Expects Accord"] 
  [Text] In the busy schedule of Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Anatolyy Zlenko, 21 to 22 March is reserved for an official 
visit to Poland. Before his departure to Warsaw, he gave an 
interview to our correspondent. Minister Zlenko emphasized that 
Ukraine attaches special attention to Poland both in terms of 
politics and diplomacy. For Ukraine, the existence of 
independent Poland is of strategic importance, as is the 
existence of independent Ukraine for Poland. 
  Ukraine expects that the visit to Poland will help it 
achieve 
more understanding in interstate relations, stabilize relations, 
encourage closer cooperation and coordination of efforts on the 
international arena -- both in the system of international 
organizations and regional cooperation. 
  [Levytskyy] The opinion is widely held that Ukrainian-Polish 
economic relations are not developing in an appropriate way. 
  [Zlenko] Over the past two years of Ukrainian-Polish 
relations, a relevant legal base was created and 45 necessary 
agreements were signed, a considerable portion of which are in 
the economic sphere. However, figures for Ukrainian-Polish trade 
do not reflect potential opportunities. The $500 million is far 
from the level that would give either side the feeling of fully 
exploited opportunities and mutually beneficial economic 
cooperation. Economic agreements should receive more attention, 
and we must also create mechanisms for their implementation. 
  [Levytskyy] Still, which of the 45 agreements with Poland 
have already brought tangible results? 
  [Zlenko] Almost all of them work at present, but not at 
their 
full capacity, though. 
  [Levytskyy] In January and in early February, the 
U.S.-devised "Partnership for Peace" initiative received very 
mixed opinions. Now, six weeks after Ukraine became a member of 
the "Partnership," could you point to any concrete advantages 
that membership in this initiative has given Ukraine? 
  [Zlenko] Ukraine was the first CIS country to join this 
program. We did this to hold relevant consultations, acquire 
relevant experience in military and political spheres, and 
finally, to resolve issues of our national security through the 
"Partnership." We are currently preparing a document outlining 
forms and extension of Ukraine's participation in the 
"Partnership." 
  We are working hard on this document. We will determine 
everything that is of any interest for Ukraine, based on our 
possibilities, including economic ones, so that we could 
definitely establish the volume of our cooperation with that 
program. 
  [Levytskyy] But I am curious what price Ukraine will have to 
pay for its participation in the "Partnership?" 
  [Zlenko] This question cannot be answered before we finish 
our document. 
  [Levytskyy] What economic effects will political 
participation in this program have on Ukraine? 
  [Zlenko] The "Partnership" program is first of all military 
and political in nature. But the very fact of cooperation in 
the framework of this program, the fact of agreement, can 
incline our partners to also resolve economic issues. We do not 
link our membership in this program with resolving economic 
problems. We see it in the much broader context. 
  [Levytskyy] Political parties in Poland, Ukraine, and other 
former socialist camp countries are actively discussing the idea 
of creating a political and economic center or an alliance for 
coordination of efforts. Promoters of such an alignment dubbed 
it the "Inter-Sea Area" [Mizhmorya]. Are you familiar with this 
initiative? What do you think about it? 
  [Zlenko] We have an initiative intended to establish a zone 
of stability and security in the Central and Eastern Europe. We 
are working on this idea, and have conducted organizational 
measures -- also with the participation of countries that 
expressed their interest in it. I believe I gave a 
comprehensive answer to your question. We are proceeding from 
the assumption that some kind of security vacuum is emerging in 
Europe which needs to be filled. 
  This initiative could be used to solve all issues based on 
trust and the creation of the political climate so that it could 
serve as a preventive measure. This would allow us to preempt 
events, instead of following them, as is the case in the Balkans. 
  No matter what name this initiative has -- the "Inter-Sea 
Area," "Inter-Ocean Area," or "Between Heaven and the Earth" -- 
it is designed to provide conditions for national security 
guarantees. 
  [Levytskyy] Jacek Kuron and other Polish politicians have 
repeatedly stressed that Ukrainian-Polish relations could only 
get rid of negative tendencies when Polish history is written by 
Ukrainians and vice versa. What is your attitude toward this 
problem? 
  [Zlenko] This problem was discussed during my first visit to 
Poland in 1992. We agreed on the need to write such history. 
We have reached understanding. Unfortunately, this is idea is 
unfolding very slowly. However, it is not dead. Joint 
commissions are actively working on revising history textbooks. 
This work is drawing to a close. 
  [Levytskyy] One more question regarding mutual 
understanding. 
An idea was proposed some time ago to cast Polish television 
programs to Ukraine, and Ukrainian to Poland... 
  [Zlenko] This is an interesting thought. However, it needs 
some work yet. The Ukrainian State Television is putting 
together its programs intended to access other countries. This 
issue needs to be specified so one can develop a clear position 
and know how to implement this idea. 
  [Levytskyy] Some delegations, Polish among them, met with 
representatives of political parties on their visits to Ukraine. 
At present, there are three directions in the Polish Eastern 
policy -- the first one is orientation toward Moscow, the second 
gives priority to cooperation with Ukraine and Belarus, while 
the third option advocates the soonest possible jump into the 
United Europe with no regard to the fate of Eastern neighbors. 
Do you plan to meet with any leaders of political parties? 
  [Zlenko] We orient ourselves toward the Polish official 
policy. Besides, I have plenty of meetings in the government, 
Sejm, and Senate that will give me the picture of current 
trends. But let me stress it again -- we are primarily oriented 
toward the official politics.

  [Text] In the opinion of Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko, relations with Russia are a priority in our 
foreign policy. In an interview with UKRINFORM, the foreign 
minister emphasized that [word indistinct] relations between 
Ukraine and Russia serve not only the interests of our two 
countries, but also Europe in general. The minister also stated 
that the process of fulfilling the tripartite agreements of the 
Ukrainian, U.S., and Russian presidents on our nonnuclear status 
and guarantees for us has already begun. He emphasized, however, 
that all the sides must adhere to their commitments, which will 
ensure fulfillment of the agreements.

  [Text] Moscow 7 April, TASS -- The commanders of nine units 
of the Black Sea Fleet have lately received letters signed by 
leaders of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists who 
threatened them with physical reprisals, the Black Sea Fleet 
press centre said. 
  The press centre described the letters as a form of 
psychological pressure on the Black Sea Fleet Command. 
  Commanders of a training unit of one of the fleet bases were 
warned that "in the event of combat activities or hostilities" 
their unit will be subject to "extermination by sabotage and 
fire." Other letters demand that Russian servicemen leave 
Ukraine under threat of physical revenge. 
  The letters correctly name the numbers of all military units 
and their phone numbers.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX, Prime 
Minister Andrey Sangheli stated that the approval of a new 
government by the parliament not by names, but by the whole list 
testifies to the trust of the executive power in the new 
government which is "capable of pulling Moldavia [Moldova] out 
of the economic crisis." 
  After expressing satisfaction with the government make-up, 
the prime minister said that the government was formed by the 
ruling Agrarian-Democratic Party which will be responsible for 
the situation in all spheres, including the economy. 
  According to Sangheli, the Republic has all necessary 
material and natural resources, the technico-economic potential 
and adequate personnel for overcoming the crisis."It is just 
necessary to understand that market is not an ultimate goal, but 
the way to increase production and improve the well-being of the 
people," he pointed out. 
  The prime minister said that by reducing the administrative 
staff and management structures of the government 30-40 percent 
saving will be reached. 
  IF Note: The new government of Moldavia has three ministries 
and three departments less than the previous one. Now there are 
17 and eight of them respectively. Until recently, the total 
number of administrative personnel was 6,000 people, and their 
maintenance cost 3.2 percent of the state budget. Sangheli will 
have four first deputies. There will also be the new post of 
the state minister for relations with the parliament. 
  The heads of the power ministries retained their posts: 
General Pavel Kryange remained the defense minister, Konstantin 
Antoch -- the interior minister, Vasily Kolmoi -- the security 
minister. The present Moldovan ambassador to Belgium Mikhail 
Popov was appointed as the new foreign minister. The 
nationalist newspaper "Tsara" argues that this appointment was 
made at Moscow's initiative and promises the change of 
Moldavia's foreign policy from Europe to Moscow oriented. 
  According to Sangheli, in about 40 days the government will 
submit to the parliament its program for the near future. The 
prime minister the priorities will be the following: 
  -- Well-thought combination of state control and development 
of market structures. 
  -- Intensive denationalization and reform of enterprises 
through distribution of shares and privatization. 
  -- Agrarian reform with retaining state's influence in the 
agrarian sector and simultaneous development of peasants' farms. 
  -- Reform of industries, support for efficient industries, 
the creation of conditions for investments. 
  -- Anti-inflationary policy, the completion of tax reform, 
the reduction of budget deficit. 
  "Despite the difficulties and bad shortage of funds, the 
government will pay special attention to the social support, the 
creation of state program for the use of labor force, support 
for low-income people, the preservation of the rights to free 
education and health care," Sangheli pointed out. 
  In his opinion, the success of the new government should be 
guaranteed by professionals who have worked in state bodies 
before, including in the government, and in recent year were 
doing business in market and commercial structures. "They 
should ensure the implementation of the new government's 
strategy of reasonable combination of market mechanisms and 
state regulation," the prime minister said. 
  Sangheli expressed confidence that relations between 
Moldavia 
and former Soviet Union republics, now the independent state of 
the Commonwealth, will rise on a qualitatively new level. He 
also does not doubt that in the near future the parliament will 
ratify all agreements signed by President Mircea Snegur within 
the framework of the CIS and the Economic Union which is now 
being created. That, in his opinion, would enable Moldavia to 
cooperate with traditional economic partners on an equal basis. 
  Commenting on the proposal of the Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev about the creation of Euroasian Union, Sangheli said: 
"We have not received any concrete proposals. If we do receive 
them, the parliament and the government will give an adequate 
answer." 
  Commenting on the repeated appointment of Sangheli as the

  [Text] The new Moldovan Government at its first meeting in 
Kishinev [Chisinau] on Thursday ruled to recommend to the 
parliament to ratify the agreement on Moldova's entry the CIS 
and the Economic Union in the near future. 
  Speaking at the meeting, Moldovan President Mircea Snegur 
singled out the main aspects of the Cabinet's activities. 
  "It is not enough for the government to receive certain 
powers from the parliament -- it should be effective, 
functional, take decisions in time, offering draft laws and 
necessary mechanisms and implementing them," the president said. 
  Snegur noted that the re-organization of ministries and 
departments should be carried out "quickly and with a 
considerable reduction of their personnel." 
  Snegur said that another priority is the preparation of a 
Cabinet program for the next two-three years. He said that it 
could be outlined by July 1 and should envisage the acceleration 
of the restructuring and modernization of the national economy, 
privatization and social support of the population.

  [Text] At the 8th round of talks between Russian and 
Moldovan government delegations in Kishinev [Chisinau] on April 
5-6 a draft agreement on the jurisdiction and mutual legal aid 
in terms of the temporary presence of Russian military units in 
MOLDOVA was initialled. The military representatives of the 
delegations signed the documents on determining the schedule of 
the withdrawal of Russian troops and cargoes from MOLDOVA to 
Russia, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin said 
at a briefing in Moscow on Thursday. 
  In his words, "to a large extent, agreement has been reached 
on Russian aviation forces temporarily stationed on Moldovan 
territory, and the use of the Tiraspol aerodrome by the Russian 
Defense Ministry's transport aviation, social guarantees and 
pensions for retired military servicemen and their families, on 
the interaction in inspections of Russian military units 
temporarily stationed in MOLDOVA in accordance with the Treaty 
on Reduction of Armed Forces in Europe and the Vienna document 
of 1992." 
  "The two sides discussed Article 2 regarding the timetable 
for the withdrawal of Russian military units stationed in 
Moldova, however failed so far to overcome the difference on 
this issue," Karasin said. "The two sides exchange new draft 
texts of the article and decided to continue its discussion at 
the next round." 
  The diplomat particularly noted that like in the previous 
round the talks were attended by representatives of Moldova's 
Transdniester region.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 4/4/1994 -- 1,700 soldiers of 
the 27th motorized Division of the Orenburg region serve in the 
Russian peace keeping forces deployed in Dniester, says today an 
article by the military commentator Viktor Litovkin in the 
newspaper IZVESTIA. "16 soldiers had been killed during a year 
and half. During the same period, the peace keeping forces had 
confiscated from people who violated the security regime 38 
guns, five machine guns, seven grenades, seven carbines, 12 
pistols, nine shotguns, 200 grenades and 63,000 cartridges. As 
to weapons that people on the both banks possess on the basis of 
special licenses, both Tiraspol and Chisinau officials do not 
have any data." There are 41 posts in the security zone along 
the Dniester of which 13 are joint, 10 check points, nine posts 
near Tighina (Bender), five near Dubasari and four near the 
village of Chitcani. The 41 Russian offices and 358 soldiers 
serving at these posts have 400 guns and several tens of armored 
vehicles. "Colonel General Col. Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian 
deputy defence minister and responsible for the peace keeping 
forces, stated that no one intends to retain the Russian peace 
keeping forces in Dniester for an undetermined period. 
Moreover, the reduced Russia military budget cannot afford this 
long presence. But, this does not depend on the general's 
wish," says the newspaper.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 7 April, TASS -- Russian troops 
can be withdrawn from Moldova's breakaway Dniester region only 
after appropriate political and international peace guarantees 
are provided to this region, according to Aleksandr Lebed, 
commander of the 14th Russian Army deployed in Moldova. 
Otherwise, "local residents scared by the 1992 war will simply 
not let the Army out, regarding it as a guarantor of peace and 
stability in the Dniester region", he noted, commenting on the 
progress of Russian-Moldovan talks on withdrawal of the 14th 
Army from the former Soviet Republic. 
  According to General Lebed, a sort of military and political 
balance has spontaneously developed in this region of Moldova. 
If Russian troops are pulled out before the crisis is settled, 
it may upset the fragile balance and revive the conflict. The 
commander believes that even after peace guarantees are 
furnished, "the Army should stay in the region for some time to 
make sure that political decisions are being properly 
implemented". However, "no steps have been taken so far to 
settle the conflict between Kishinev and Tiraspol," Lebed 
pointed out. 
  The Russian commander said "the situation in the republic 
has 
radically changed following Moldova's parliamentary elections 
and plebiscite on independence. Dniester authorities were taken 
unawares by these events and are presently searching for new 
decisions. I will judge about Tiraspol's position by whom 
President Igor Smirnov will name to head the negotiating team. 
If these are the same leaders -- Vasiliy Yakovlev or Anna 
Volkova -- there will be no serious dialogue," General Lebed 
stressed. 
  The 14th Army commander believes that Russia's peacekeeping 
role in settling conflicts on CIS borders has good prospects. 
"Russian officers in the Dniester region managed to iron out 
the differences, which could have never been smoothed by 
peacekeepers from third countries. This is just a matter of 
psychology: People who once served in the same Army know one 
another quite well. Very often, they drop official attitudes 
and solve their problems in terms of human relations. This 
proves extremely helpful," he emphasised. 
  General Lebed expressed concern over the current ambiguous 
status of the 14th Russian Army. He said favourable economic 
conditions should be cretaed for the Army's withdrawal. "We 
should offer something to people coming to a new place instead 
of withdrawing them to the open country, as it was in 1988-89," 
the commander pointed out. 
  In today's interview with the Kishinev newspaper 
"MAKLER-TELEGRAF," Lebed denied any involvement into political 
activities in the Dniester region. He said he had stepped down 
as a deputy of the Dniester supreme legislature after Dniester 
militants were sent to Moscow to defend the dissolved Russian 
Parliament. Speaking of last October's events in Moscow, the 
commander confirmed that he had been invited to take part but 
rejected the proposal. Lebed dismissed allegations about his 
unofficial relations with former Vice- President Aleksandr 
Rutskoy and said he had no intention "to play his part in 
Russian politics."

  [Text] For the first time within the CIS framework, the 
drafting of a general concept has started, providing for the 
protection of the external borders of the CIS using the means 
and resources of the entire commonwealth. This has been told to 
an RIA correspondent by General Colonel Andrey Nikolayev, 
Russian Federation Border Troops commander in chief. According 
to him, the concept envisions a system of mutual commitments of 
the [CIS] states in providing security of both their own 
national borders and the borders of other countries. Protection 
of the borders will be maintained in a coordinated manner.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Burbyga and Boris Vinogradov report: "Russian </F>
Border Troops Have Business Over the Border"] 
  [Text] The commanders of the 12 CIS countries' border 
troops have held a council meeting in Odintsovo near Moscow. 
This is the ninth session in the history of the Commconwealth, 
but it is the first time that it has been possible to gather 
together the full complement. 
  In an interview with IZVESTIYA Russia's reprsentative, 
Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev, indicated that the 100-percent 
quorum is evidence of the "partners' maturity" in realizing the 
importance of jointly guarding the CIS' external borders. The 
council participants cited the fact that a political concept is 
needed for cooperation in this field. 
  Regardless of whether the Commonwealth is reorganized into a 
Eurasian Union in the future, border guards must have a clear 
system of mutual commitments in order to ensure the security of 
the whole area. The possibility of each CIS member unilaterally 
introducing relaxed entry visa procedures for other states' 
citizens is precluded. 
  Until now border guards have cooperated on a bilateral 
footing. But in the future the intention is to sign regional 
agreements. Russia, Armenia, and Georgia and Russia, Kazakhstan, 
and Uzbekistan are preparing to sign such agreements. Steps are 
being taken to further strengthen the Tajik-Afghan border with 
the participation of five Commonwealth states. Ukraine and 
Moldavia [Moldova] have expressed a desire to join in the common 
work for the first time. Admittedly, Ukrainian representative 
Valeriy Gubenko did not wait for the council to completely 
finish its work before leaving for home "on official business." 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin received the generals and asked them to 
step up vigilance on the borders in order to protect Russia and 
the other Commonwealth countries from wholesale misfortune -- 
the incursion of illegals from Asia and Africa. The premier 
promised on the government's behalf to afford every assistance 
in providing external borders with equipment. 
  It was decided to man on the "ethnic principle" outposts 
where Russian border guards have hitherto mainly served. New 
recruits will swear loyalty to their independent homeland and at 
the same time swear a "solemn vow" to Russia. Russian officers 
will keep their role as military advisers and technical experts. 
  The recommendations made by the council of commanders will 
be 
presented to the meeting of CIS heads of state and government, 
which is due to start work in Moscow 14 April.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F>
correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy 
Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] In contrast to CIS countries against which Russia 
does not wage any intelligence operations, Russia's Intelligence 
Service treats the Baltic states as any other European 
countries, the press secretary of the Intelligence Service 
Director Tatyana Samolis declared in her interview with Interfax 
on Wednesday. 
  She voiced a supposition that the Federal 
Counterintelligence 
Service Director Sergey Stepashin, who declared at the 
scientific-practical conference in Moscow that the Eastern 
European countries as well as the former Soviet republics "make 
their intelligence activity against Russia more active," 
primarily meant the Baltic states. 
  Samolis underlined that "Russia's tactics with respect to 
the 
Baltic states will be a corresponding one in case Russia's 
interests demand this." 
  At the same time she specially noted that "if Russia does 
not 
wage intelligence operations in CIS countries it does not mean 
that it is not interested in the processes going on there." "In 
1992 eight CIS states signed an agreement prohibiting 
intelligence activity against each other. Nevertheless, Russian 
intelligence follows the situation by all available means, 
including special ones, -- said Samolis. They include 
information collection via the third countries and analysis of 
open sources. For example, we receive part of the information 
about Tajikistan from Afghanistan. Russia's leadership does not 
remain without any analysis of the processes taking place in CIS 
countries."

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS--Today's newspapers highlight 
the results of voting in the Federation Council, the upper house 
of the Russian parliament, on whether to accept the resignation 
of Russia's Prosecutor-General Alexey Kazannik. 
  The Federation Council did not accept Kazannik's resignation 
and formally he still remains at his post. At the same time, 
according to the presidential decree dated February 26, the 
duties of prosecutor-general are being performed by Alexey 
Ilyushenko whose powers were reaffirmed on April 6 by President 
Boris Yeltsin. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the Federation Council vote: "Two 
prosecutors-general are too many for Russia. Through its 
decision, the Federation Council has drawn itself into a 
juridical collision, and an easy and painless way out of it can 
hardly be expected... 
  "Prior to making a new recommendation of a candidate for the 
office of prosecutor-general, the president should again suggest 
that the Federation Council accept Kazannik's resignation. The 
circle closes... 
  "It is clear that the Federation Council will not be able to 
resolve the problem without a thorough juridical analysis of the 
current situation and a search for a compromise solution". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the same subject: "The Federation 
Council does not yield to the presidential team. Next move is 
to be made by the presidential side. The president should 
either recommend Alexey Kazannik to the Federation Council, or 
get to terms with the upper house of parliament in some other 
way". 
  TRUD carries an analytical article headlined "Who is 
Prosecutor- General in Russia?" Turning to the provisions of 
the new Constitution, the newspaper writes: "Since a 
prosecutor-general is appointed by the Federation Council on the 
president's recommendation, it can well be reckoned that the 
president should have presented prosecutor-general's candidacy 
to parliament for approval. This must also be demanded by the 
upper house of parliament. 
  "Neither the former nor the latter had been done in time. 
The president does not recommend Kazannik now because he has 
already accepted his resignation. On the other hand, by 
refusing to accept the resignation, the Federation Council has 
actually `appointed' a prosecutor-general without the 
president's recommendation". 
  Newspapers also give prominence to a draft agreement on 
achieving civil accord in Russia, which President Yeltsin has 
referred to the two houses of parliament, as well as sent it for 
publication and country-wide discussion. 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA runs an article in which it expresses 
doubt 
that the document would be implemented. "Special sections of 
this sizeable document deal with both regional, national and 
socio-economic policies... Obligations are envisioned in all of 
them. But would they be feasible in real life full of 
contradictions?" 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) is more optimistic on the 
subject: 
"The draft agreement inspires hopes, albeit faint and 
indistinct." 
  PRAVDA frontpages statistics on the economic situation in 
the 
country: "In the first quarter of this year, industrial 
production declined by 25 percent. Food production continues to 
shrink. The amounts of milk and meat produced decreased by 
15-18 percent and eggs by six percent. Investment diminished as 
production fell. Investments in the country's economy accounted 
for 75-80 percent of those in the corresponding period last 
year." 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the money incomes of the country's 
top officials. Under the headline "No One Wanted To Fill in a 
Declaration of Income", the newspaper carries an article which 
points to the construction of costly three-storey mansions for 
some ministers, mayors, and deputies. 
  The authors of the article urge Russian parliamentarians to 
pass a law which would make it binding upon top executives of 
the country, and leaders of state-run organisations to fill in 
declarations of income, which could prevent the emergence of 
corruption in the civil service system.

  [Text] TALLINN, Apr 07, BNS - The 18th round of 
Estonian-Russian negotiations April 5-6 in Moscow ended without 
any result, Raul Malk, Estonian Foreign Ministry deputy 
chancellor and a member of the Estonian delegation for the 
talks, said today at a press conference in Tallinn. 
  Malk said only the humanitarian issues working group made 
some progress. The two parties agreed to resume talks at the 
beginning of May. 
  Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation and head of 
the military issues working group, claimed Estonia was prepared 
for increased pressure on Russia's part, considering that Latvia 
and Russia initialed an agreement on social guarantees for 
military pensioners. 
  "The course of the talks didn't alarm us, although the 
Russian party demanded sharply and in the form of an ultimatum 
that Estonia should sign an agreement on military retirees and 
pay Russia 23 million U.S. dollars (to build housing for the 
repatriated military in Russia)," Tiiman said. "Since the texts 
of the initialed Latvian-Russian agreements are available to us, 
we can say Russia made similar demands on us." 
  Tiiman claimed Russia demanded that Estonia should issue 
residence permits to all retirees and "give them apartments in 
perpetuity." 
  Estonia put at the talks the question whether Russia 
considers that Estonia's legislation concerning military 
pensioners is inconsistent with international law, which the 
Russian delegation failed to answer. The Estonian delegation 
plans at the next round of talks to ask Russia to explain the 
legal basis for retiring its officers on Estonia's territory. 
  Russia on Wednesday in Moscow officially backed off from the 
Aug. 31 deadline for the withdrawal of its troops. 
  "Russia itself proposed in November the Aug. 31 deadline. 
Estonia agreed to it after serious deliberation. Now Russia 
deleted the date from the text of the agreement without making a 
new proposal. Thus, instead of the final deadline, there's a gap 
in the text of the agreement. It shows that the work of the 
delegations' military issues working groups has no prospects. I 
don't understand what's the purpose of our meetings," Tiiman 
said. 
  Tiiman told the press Estonia put forward an "entirely new 
idea" for dismantling the Paldiski nuclear reactors, which 
Russia is at present studying. He declined to disclose the 
details of the proposal. 
  Tiiman said the humanitarian issues working group made some 
progress in discussions about the maintenance of military 
graveyards, exchange of prisoners, and citizenship problems. 
Russia expressed willingness to present lists of Russian 
citizens residing in Estonia, he stated. 
  Malk told the press the April 1 incident near Petseri when 
two unidentified persons killed one and wounded two Russian 
border guards cast a cloud on discussions in the border issues 
working group. 
  "The parties agreed that absence of a relevant agreement 
complicates cooperation between the two countries' border 
guards," Malk said. "They discussed an agreement on cooperation 
between border officials, and the Estonian delegation asked for 
an explanation why Russia hasn't as yet ratified the agreement 
on legal cooperation." 
  Malk declared that so far no facts have come to light to 
support the claims that the persons who murdered the Russian 
border guard arrived on Russian-controlled territory from 
Estonia or that they escaped to Estonia after the crime. 
  The economic issues working group reported no progress. The 
questions it discussed included an Estonian-Russian agreement on 
commercial and economic cooperation for 1994, questions of 
ownership, payment of the former Soviet Union's foreign debt, 
and compensation for the gold and foreign currency Russia 
removed from Estonia in 1940. 
  Malk said Russia links economic issues with developments in 
other spheres, and for that reason "there was no progress in 
this group, either." 
  In reply to BNS' question whether Estonia will after the 
failure of the 18th round of talks again consider suspending the 
negotiations, Malk said a relevant political decision must be 
made on the government level. 
  Foreign Minister Juri Luik said today at a press conference 
that Estonian-Russian talks must continue. Europe's support for 
Russia withdrawing its troops from Estonia by Aug. 31 is very 
strong, he said. 
  The foreign minister claimed Russia could pull out its 
troops 
even sooner than by Aug. 31. "There are no real obstacles to it, 
it's only Russia's political incapacity," Luik maintained. He 
added that the western states would react pretty sharply if 
Russia should drag its feet over the troop withdrawal.

<F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>
  [Text] Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Juri Luik, who 
returned from a visit to Brussels on Thursday [7 April], told a 
press conference that despite the failure of the last, 18th 
round of the Estonian-Russian inter-state negotiations in Moscow 
yesterday, Estonia intended to continue the negotiations. 
  On Wednesday, Russia removed the clause in the draft 
Russian- 
Estonian troop withdrawal agreement obligating Russia to pull 
its troops out of Estonia by 31 August 1994, saying the final 
date would reappear in the draft agreement if Estonia altered 
its legislation on military retirees, Estonian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs informed ETA yesterday. In essence this move set 
talks back to last August, before Russia had proposed a final 
withdrawal date, the Ministry said in its statement. 
  "There is always sense in continuing the negotiations," Luik 
said, recalling that already after the 17th round the 
negotiations were almost broken, but stressing that the 
negotiations had to be continued with the aim of 31 August as 
the Russian troop withdrawal deadline. 
  He added that in case of a wish from the Russian side Russia 
could pull out its 2,500 troops from Estonia much quicker than 
August 31. "There are no practical obstacles to troop 
withdrawal, there is only a political inability from the Russian 
side," he said. 
  Ago Tiiman, the secretary of the Estonian delegation at the 
negotiations explained a press conference on Thursday that the 
Russian delegation had made a proposal to grant residence 
permits automatically to all retired Russian military, including 
"the officers that will resign e.g. tomorrow". He said that the 
Russian side demanded that Estonia give the flats used by the 
retirees to their private ownership, saying that a privately 
owned flat could be sold much more favourably by those that 
leave than only the so-called "propiska". 
  Tiiman said that the Russian delegation made its proposals 
in 
"a sharp ultimatum style". As the demands were similar to those 
adopted in the Russian-Latvian agreement, the text of which 
Estonian delegation had at hand, Estonia was prepared to the 
pressure of the Russian side, he added. 
  Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed ETA on 
Thursday 
that 30 House members of the US Congress sent letters on April 4 
to President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
urging the Administration to insist that Russia honor its 
commitment to withdraw from Estonia and Latvia by August 31, 
1994. 
  "If we abandon our insistence that Russia remove its troops 
from the Baltics on schedule, we will only strengthen the 
hard-liners in Russia who wish to expand their influence and 
regain lost territory. The removal of all Russian troops from 
the independent yet fragile Baltic countries is crucial for 
stability, peace and democracy in the Baltics, and for 
continuing good relations between the United States and Russia," 
reads the letter. 
  Russian allegations of human rights violations in Estonia 
and 
Latvia, a claim Moscow uses to justify Russian military 
presence, were rejected in this letter. Signatories also agreed 
that Russian demands for housing, pensions and resident status 
for former Russian officers are "completely unjustified, and are 
simply intended to prolong the Russian occupation of the 
Baltics." 
  Estonian Minister of Population Peeter Olesk told ETA, 
however, that it was to be expected that Russia will "increase 
pressure on Estonia at the final phase of the bilateral 
negotiations" and "dispute Estonia's belonging to European 
states". "Russia has always been interested in destabilizing our 
independence and will not step back on the issue," he said.

  [Text] The future of the Estonian-Russian negotiations is 
vague, head of the Russian delegation Vasily Svirin told the ETA 
yesterday. The 18th round made progress only in some issues 
concerning citizenship, while the problem of the retired 
military remained unsolved, he said. The Estonian side had 
rejected all Russian proposals, Svirin explained. He added that 
the Russian side proposes a complex solution of the Paldiski 
issue, while the Estonian proposals had only concerned the 
removal of the nuclear fuel. The Russian side is ready to 
initial the agreement on Paldiski, Svirin announced.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Estonian Foreign Minister Juri </F>
Luik by Francoise Delstanche in Brussels; date not given: 
"Estonia Expects Firmer Support From The Twelve"] 
  [Text] An ambiguous European attitude is prompting the 
countries of Eastern Europe to come banging on its door. Still 
wary of Russia, Estonia is seeking support from the European 
Union (EU) and wants to set up a free trade zone as from January 
1995. 
  In the wake of the accelerated process of rapprochement 
between the West and the countries that used to be on the other 
side of the Iron Curtain, the Baltic states do not intend to let 
themselves be held to one side. Like other countries in Eastern 
Europe, they are implementing their policy of rapprochement with 
the EU, and the defense and security organizations -- NATO and 
the WEU [Western European Union] -- in parallel. 
  For instance, Estonia, whose foreign minister, Mr. Juri 
Luik, 
was in Brussels this week, has signed up to the Partnership for 
Peace with NATO, and does not intend to let itself be 
outstripped if the WEU actually goes ahead with the creation of 
an associate status for the countries of Central and Eastern 
Europe. What is more, Juri Luik proved optimistic in this 
respect, remarking during an interview with L'ECHO that the WEU 
Secretary General Willem Van Eekelen said he was clearly in 
favor of the Baltic states participating in such a project. 
<H5>  Free Trade </H5>
  Furthermore, the three Baltic states launched negotiations 
with the Twelve last February with a view to creating a 
free-trade zone. This has become essential in the light of the 
possible entry of the Scandinavian countries to the Union -- for 
these countries already have such an agreement with the Baltic 
states. Hence the need to conclude an agreement this summer, so 
that it can be implemented as from 1 January 1995. 
  Have any problems arisen in the context of these 
discussions? 
Not really, affirmed Juri Luik. Things are making quite good 
progress, he believes, even if his country would like more 
extensive free trade -- at least, more extensive free trade than 
the EU is offering at the moment. Estonia, he reiterated, is 
one of the champions of free trade. "That," he explained, "is 
why we do not want to see the others erecting any more barriers 
between us." Compared with the European agreements already in 
force, Priit Kolbre, deputy secretary general for foreign 
affairs in Estonia and his country's main negotiator with the 
EU, emphasized that the EU's current preference for countries 
with EU associate status will be reversed to Estonia's benefit 
because its economy is completely open. However, certain 
sectors that are sensitive from the EU's point of view -- e.g. 
the agriculture and textile sectors -- are still posing problems. 
  Nonetheless, in the eyes of Minister Luik, it is not only an 
economic gesture, but also a political decision aimed at showing 
that free trade is still worth something, even today. "We have 
come a long way," he said, "and we are expecting stronger 
political support from the EU than we are being given at the 
moment." 
  However, the three Baltic states have already set their 
sights even higher and soon want to launch talks on becoming EU 
associates, just like the other countries of Central Europe. 
These negotiations could be finished by the end of the year, 
believes Juri Luik, for the economic part will already have been 
completed within the context of setting up the free trade zone. 
So all that would remain would be the political and 
philosophical part, which he does not believe should create any 
major problems. 

<H5>    Artificial Barriers </H5>
  As for full EU membership, it is still too early to say for 
Estonia. "For the moment we are concentrating on association," 
affirmed Priit Kolbre, who believes that the EU has erected 
artificial barriers by subdividing the countries of Eastern 
Europe into small subgroups, with the Visegrad countries on one 
side, the Baltic states on the other, etc. "Consequently, our 
main objective is to eliminate these barriers and ensure that we 
are given equal treatment," he said, by becoming associates, 
just like everyone else. Only then will the time come to 
discuss membership, a prospect for which Estonia will be ready 
in five years' time, according to Kolbre. 
  Moreover, it is the behavior of the EU member states which 
is 
provoking the current climate of competition between the new 
candidate member states in the East, continued the Estonian 
minister. For it would appear that the Union has not managed 
its policy on enlargement with sufficient clarity, Kolbre 
believes. In this context, he went on, the potential candidates 
are wondering about the risk they are running of seeing the EU 
end its enlargement process for the time being. It is precisely 
this uncertainty that is prompting them to rush so that they can 
be included in the next wave of negotiations. 

<H5>    Unpredictable Russia </H5>
  Juri Luik believes that beyond the pure process of bilateral 
rapprochement, the EU also has a very important role to play 
regarding the relations between the Baltic states and Russia. 
This particularly applies in the context of Russia's commitment 
to withdraw its troops from Estonia by the end of August 1994. 
A promise which could effectively be respected if European 
pressure is kept up, for it should not be forgotten that the 
actual means of withdrawal have not yet been settled. 
  In Tallinn, the Estonian Government is wary of Moscow's 
changes of mood. The Foreign Ministry is underlining the 
ambivalence of the Russian position, which is constantly 
imposing new conditions on the withdrawal of its troops. 
However, that is not the only example. The Russians would still 
like to be given special treatment, laments Priit Kolbre, 
whether in relations with the IMF, NATO, or the Council of 
Europe. It is precisely for that reason that the West should 
set clear limits that are not to be crossed, insists the 
Estonian politician. For, in his view, Moscow is currently 
performing a neat U-turn toward centralism, chauvinism, and 
withdrawal into itself. The last instance of this to date 
comprised the modifications imposed on the Russian customs 
system, which penalize the Baltic states in particular.

  [Text] Brussels, Apr 07, BNS -- Estonia is optimistic it 
will soon have free trade access to the European Union [EU], 
Foreign Minister Juri Luik said Wednesday [6 April]. 
  In Brussels for meetings with EU officials, including the 
union's trade chief, Sir Leon Brittan, Luik said he hoped talks 
on a free trade agreement between the two sides would be sewn up 
in late May. 
  The talks have narrowed their focus down to the sensitive 
areas of agriculture and textiles, he told reporters. 
  Estonia's policy of allowing imports to enter the country 
freely, without tariffs, gives the tiny nation "a very strong 
hand in negotiating with the European Union," Luik said. 
  EU trade talks with the Baltic nations of Latvia and 
Lithuania are progressing more slowly, "but the aim to have 
working agreements in place by Jan. 1, 1995 is still a goal for 
all three states," Luik said. 
  Estonia already has a free trade zone with Finland, which is 
expected to join the union on Jan. 1, along with Austria, Norway 
and Sweden. 
  Luik said Baltic states hope to upgrade their talks with the 
EU soon so they can move beyond trade to political and 
immigration issues. "We hope in autumn that the Baltic states 
might move on to the association agreements," he said. 
  Those agreements ensure regular political dialogue and hold 
out the prospect of eventual EU membership. 
  The EU has signed similar accords with the Czech and Slovak 
Republics, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania. 
  Luik said Baltic governments feel strong support from EU 
states, especially from Germany. 
  "This path needs political courage, both from ourselves and 
from the European Union," he said. 
  He would not guess as to when Baltic states would find their 
place in the union. "It depends more on the EU than on us," he 
said. "We are ready to move at the quickest possible speed." 
  "We don't want the Baltic states to be left behind." Last 
month, the presidents of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia announced 
they would combine diplomatic efforts to gain membership into 
European and international organizations. 
  Since breaking with Moscow in 1991, the three states, with a 
combined population of 7.8 million, have expressed the desire to 
integrate their nations. 
  Luik said coordination so far has been "mostly political," 
adding that there are "clear differences" between their economic 
policies.

  [Text] Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik, who returned 
from an official visit to Brussels, on Thursday [7 April], told 
a press conference at the Tallinn Airport, that the main issue 
of his press conference, yesterday, in Brussels, was that of 
free trade negotiations between Estonia and the European Union. 
  During his two-day visit Luik had meetings with 
West-European 
Union Secretary General Willem van Eekelen, deputy Secretary 
General of NATO Sergio Balanzino and deputy President of the 
European Commission Sir Leon Brittan and he made a speech in the 
European Parliament foreign and security issues committee, 
Estonian Embassy in Brussels told ETA. 
  The relations of the Baltic states with the European Union 
were discussed in the light of current free trade negotiations 
and in connection with the possibility to continue these 
negotiations with the aim of concluding an association agreement 
with EU. Luik stated that taken into consideration the Estonian 
already very free foreign trade policy EU could express more 
benignancy, especially in the areas of trade, agriculture and 
textile. He stated, however, that Estonia will not unilaterally 
avoid limitations on textile and agriculture trade, if EU makes 
no concessions to Estonia. Luik stressed that the association 
agreement negotiations should start directly after the free 
trade agreement was concerted, which could happen as soon as the 
second half of this year. "If we can conclude the free trade 
agreements by January 1, 1995, Estonia will in reality pass the 
Visegrad states and be the first East European state to belong 
to the joint free trade zone with EU," Luik said today. 
  At the meetings in NATO and the West-European Union, 
security 
issues were discussed in connection with preparations to grant 
Central and East-European states a new status in the WEU. Luik 
expressed hope that in case of the new status, no differences 
should be made among the states that participate at the WEU 
consultation forum, a member of which Estonia is, together with 
6 Central- European states, Latvia and Lithuania. The details of 
the new status have to be approved by WEU and consultation 
partners foreign and defence ministers meeting on May 9 in 
Luxembourg.

  [Text] TALLINN, Apr 07, BNS - The 58 Kurds who recently 
arrived illegally in Estonia were taken into the country through 
Narva, not through southeastern Estonia, Border Guard Department 
Director Tarmo Kouts told BNS. 
  Kouts, whom Interior Minister Heiki Arike appointed as head 
of a working group to investigate the incident, held yesterday 
and today talks with Russian border guard officials. 
  "The talks haven't so far brought a definite result," Kouts 
said. "The Russian officials claimed they hadn't as yet been 
authorized to let the Kurds back into Russia, but they didn't 
deny that they ought to receive them." 
  Kouts confirmed that the chief of Russia's Pskov border 
guard 
unit wanted to solve the Kurdish issue on the level of the two 
countries' border guard authorities, without involving the 
foreign ministries. 
  The leader of the Estonian border guards told BNS there was 
no information to confirm allegations that some Estonian 
officials were paid for allowing the Kurds into the country. 
  "The Kurds give contradictory statements and are afraid to 
speak, because they were smuggled into Estonia by the Russian 
mafia and people's lives may be at stake," Kouts explained. 
  He said it is not yet clear what transport the Kurds used. 
  The Interior Ministry told BNS the Kurds claimed to have 
arrived in Estonia Tuesday [5 April] night from Moscow in two 
groups in closed containers. They also said they paid 
go-betweens for being taken into the country. 
  The Kurds were detained on Wednesday in an apartment house 
in 
Tallinn's Kopli district. The group comprised 21 men, 16 women 
and 21 children.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 07, BNS -- Two organizations of 
Estonia's Russian-speaking population warned the government 
yesterday of a "social explosion" if the effective regulations 
for issuing residence and work permits to non-citizens are not 
changed. 
  The Russian Representative Assembly and the Russian 
Community 
are of the opinion that the application of the aliens law, which 
met with an otherwise "positive response," by the executive 
branch of power is a "juridical trap" which deprives most of the 
non-citizens of a number of their rights. 
  The statement notes that at present only temporary residence 
and work permits for a one-year term are issued to persons who 
lived in Estonia before July 1990. The permits don't grant them 
social and economic rights promised upon adoption of the aliens 
law, the statement claims. 
  In the opinion of the Russian organizations, the problem can 
be solved only legislatively. The Russian Representative 
Assembly and the Russian Community have made their proposals for 
this to the government through the minorities' round-table 
conference. 
  The proposals include defining legally the status of persons 
who were born on the Estonian territory or arrived in the 
country before July 1, 1990, and were registered as Estonian 
residents by the authorities of the Estonian SSR; introducing a 
guarantee in the aliens law that permanent residents of Estonia 
will be issued permanent residence permits; and defining the 
exact meaning of "permanent residence and work permit," 
"temporary residence and work permit," "cadre personnel of 
foreign armed forces," and "sufficient legal income" in the 
aliens law. 
  Both Russian organizations announce that, until such 
decisions have been passed, they cannot advise non-citizens to 
apply for residence and work permits.

<F P=106> [From 7 April PAEVALEHT, EESTI SENUMID p 3, 1; "News </F>
Bulletin" No. 66] 
  [Text] Thursday, April 7 -- The general assembly of the 
Association of Estonian Newspapers (EALL) convened yesterday for 
an extra meeting concerning the conflict around the daily RAHVA 
HAAL. The assembly approved a statement recommending that the 
government terminated the publication of the daily in its 
present form as "harmful to the reputation of the Estonian 
printed media". The assembly also offered to mediate between 
the parties of the conflict. 
  The assembly considered it unsuitable for the Ministry of 
Culture chancellor Veiko Jurisson to continue at a responsible 
government post because of the harm done to Estonia's 
international reputation and the financial loss caused to the 
state by his actions. 
  Managing Director of the EALL Mati Eliste pointed out that 
the daily RAHVA HAAL, currently published by the private company 
Hommikuleht, is not being returned to the printing shop for lack 
of buyers and presents a criminal waste of paper and labour. 
The EALL had warned the Estonian Government against inevitable 
conflicts that would follow the attempts to privatise the 
newspaper against the will of the editorial staff, the statement 
read. However, the government had failed to consider the 
warning and the conflict came about as predicted. 
  The EALL also stated that the former editorial staff of the 
RAHVA HAAL should have made more efforts to regulate its 
relations with the state. 
  Chancellor of the Ministry of Culture Veiko Jurisson claimed 
that the negotiations concerning the new editor in chief of the 
RAHVA HAAL are likely to be concluded today. But he declined 
from disclosing the candidates' names.

<F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>
  [Text] Chairman of the board of the scandalous Rahva Haal 
newspaper Veiko Jurisson told ETA that starting Friday [8 
April], the present editor-in-chief of Estonian News Agency 
Peeter Tali will fulfill the responsibilities of the acting 
editor-in-chief of the paper. 
  Tali will continue working at ETA as a consultant. As an 
acting editor-in-chief of Rahva Haal he has all authorities to 
put together the new staff of Rahva Haal, Jurisson said. 
  Peeter Tali (29) has graduated from Tartu University 
department of journalism and has worked for the Edasi\Postimees 
daily and as an editor-in-chief of ETA since last summer. 
  Scandal over the second biggest Estonian daily Rahva Haal 
started already in May last year when Estonian Privatization 
Agency decided to privatize the state-owned newspaper, the 
results of which were disputed at court and the privatization of 
the daily stopped. 
  In October last year the board of the daily was changed with 
majority given to representatives of the government coalition. 
On March 18, the board adopted a decision to change the statutes 
of the company, abolishing the institution of editor-in-chief 
and creating a new institution of publisher-in-chief. Majority 
of the staff of the paper, in protest to the decision, resigned 
and decided to join AS RH, formed by the Rahva Haal staff last 
year to participate at the privatization. Editor-in-chief Toomas 
Leito was dismissed by the board "for loss of trust" and not 
preserving "political balance" of the paper. Toomas Leito told 
ETA that the decisions of the board of RAS Rahva Haal had been 
of "purely political" nature. 
  The former staff of Rahva Haal started to publish their own 
paper Eesti Sunumid. Rahva Haal is published, at present, by RAS 
Rahva Haal in cooperation with AS Hommikuleht, another Estonian 
daily. 
  On Monday, Estonian Ministry of Culture and Education sent a 
letter to the managing director of AS Ajakirjandusmaja, that 
administers the Tallinn Press Building where most of the biggest 
newspapers are located, demanding that in 24 hours "outsiders" 
(meaning the former staff) leave the 5th floor rooms rented to 
RAS Rahva Haal. Phones were cut off and the staff let into the 
rooms only in twos to fetch their private things. 
  World Press Freedom Committee, which includes 36 leading 
journalistic organisations on five continents, sent a letter to 
Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar on Thursday, saying that the 
Committee was dismayed over Estonian government's "forcible 
eviction" from their premises of the editor and staff of the 
newspaper Rahva Haal. 
  "This attack on the journalistic independence of a newspaper 
critical of your administration can only harm the hard won image 
of the new Estonia as a working democracy," Ronald Koven, the 
European representative of the Committee, stated on behalf of 
the organization, adding that it is particularly distressing to 
those who have seen Estonia as a "leading exponent of free 
speech and press freedom in East and Central Europe". 
  The notion of "political balance" invoked to attempt to 
justify governmental dismissal of the editor, cutting off the 
newspaper's telephone lines and threats to prosecute the editor, 
all violate the principles of press freedom, the letter stresses. 
  The committee urges Estonian Prime Minister to refrain from 
placing further obstacles in the way of the staff's publication 
of their newspaper (i.e. Eesti Sunumid) and to proceed with 
speedy privatization of the paper without attempting to maintain 
control indirectly. "The steps taken so far plainly demonstrate 
the threat to a free press of state ownership," the letter says, 
adding that Estonia's democratic credentials are threatened by 
these actions against the press.

  [Text] Moscow, 7 April -- The Russian president's decree, 
"On introducing a state of emergency in parts of the Republic of 
North Ossetia and the Ingush Republic," which extends the state 
of emergency for two more months, was approved by the Federation 
Council today. 
  The situation in the zone of conflict was discussed behind 
closed doors for four hours, however, the issue remained open 
and the problem will be further discussed tomorrow. Vasiliy 
Tarasenko, chairman of the committee for federation affairs and 
regional policy, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that attempts 
had been made to block the approval of the decree on various 
pretexts. In his view, "It is not as much a result of the 
conflict between the two republics as a way to influence 
relations between power structures in general." Unfortunately, 
"Politics and the stirring up of the conflict at the expense of 
people's sufferings interfere" in the problem of approving the 
presidential decree, he remarked.

<F P=106> [Sergey Shakhray article: "Better Fewer but Better. Duma's </F>
Time Limit Dictates That"] 
  [Text] Despite all the disappointments of the last few 
years Russians still expect positive changes from new laws. 
However, people should not harbor excessive illusions about 
everything to do with the parliament's lawmaking activity. 
Since such unwarranted expectations may subsequently form a 
basis for confrontation between society and parliament and a 
source of mutual recriminations between the executive and the 
representative authorities. 
  The Constitution enshrines a complex system for lawmaking in 
the Russian Federation. All draft laws are submitted to the 
State Duma. After they are adopted they are sent to the 
Federation Council for examination or "silent approval." Only a 
few laws are liable to mandatory examination by the Federation 
Council. The latter has the right to approve or reject a law. 
The Duma can "overcome" such a rejection by a two-thirds vote 
and then send the law to the president. The president is also 
entitled to send the law back to the Duma for further 
consideration and thus increase still further the time it takes 
to examine and adopt the said law. Only after all these 
procedures is the law signed by the president and comes into 
force as soon as it is published. 
  Thus months may elapse between the time of the Duma vote and 
the law's coming into force. 
  In view of all these factors let us take a look at the 
Duma's 
work "schedule." Its standing orders envisage that the Duma 
takes a vacation twice a year -- in August-September and for a 
fortnight during the winter. Deputies spend the last week of 
each month working in their own districts. Thus three weeks in 
every month are allocated for work in the Duma proper. In 
December 1995 new members of the State Duma and the Federation 
Council will be elected. Thus, the Duma, which meets for 
plenary sessions twice a week, really has just 96 plenary 
sessions left. That also means that it has time to subject to 
qualified examination, adopt, and bring "to life" no more than 
30 laws. 
  What is more, after the budget has been ratified all newly 
adopted laws can only be enacted as of the new fiscal year, 
1995. That is a reality with which one must come to terms. 
  On the one hand, this procedure guarantees society against 
the adoption of rash and thoughtless decisions. The law is both 
the result of the coordination of interests in the Duma and 
consensus between this chamber, which represents the interests 
of the whole state, and the interests of components of the 
Russian Federation, whose representatives sit in the Federation 
Council. This combination of statewide interests with the 
interests of every component, enshrined in the actual lawmaking 
procedure, is extremely essential. 
  But, on the other hand, this actual procedure imposes a 
number of moral-political obligations on all parties to the 
lawmaking process. In order to ensure that the legislative 
process does not become a "bone of contention" between society 
and parliament and also between the representative and executive 
authorities, a complex system of conciliation procedures now has 
to be thought out and "cranked" into action. Moreover, there 
are problems which require laws to be adopted very rapidly. 
  I think that experts and deputies from both chambers of 
parliament should begin working together at the stage where 
draft laws are prepared by Duma committees and commissions. At 
the same time government experts should be involved in the work 
on the drafts since no law requiring financial outlay can be 
adopted without a ruling from the government. 
  It is necessary to take a calm view of the situation that 
has 
developed in the "sphere of lawmaking," but in order to obtain 
even a minimal result one should now ponder the optimum means of 
organizing the lawmaking process. Therefore the main tasks today 
are as follows. 
  First, it is necessary to precisely decide the list of 30-40 
priority laws relating to the most urgent economic, political, 
and social issues. This does not incidentally mean that the 
Duma should stop the work it has begun in other areas. But 
deputies and the public must realize at the same time that they 
are working on legislative material for the next parliament. 
  Second, many deputies must abandon the illusion that they 
have come to the Duma to write laws "themselves" rather than 
organize this work like all developed countries do. Lawmaking 
is just as complex a matter as any professional activity. The 
legislative process is strictly subordinate to the laws of 
formal logic. It must not allow the adoption of laws that are 
not written in legal language or lack financial validation. The 
laws must also be accompanied by packages of delegatory acts. 
The world has rules whereby a law is simply not examined in the 
absence of a package of delegatory acts and the requisite 
instructions. 
  Third and last, the texts of draft laws should be produced 
by 
professionals and submitted to parliament in 99 percent of cases 
by the government. Deputies should monitor this activity in the 
right sense of the word and voice the group interests of the 
voters. Their task is to "pass" the content of the draft law in 
line with their professional experience and knowledge. They 
have to check whether or not it reflects the urgent requirements 
of society. And in this connection voters should not make 
excessive demands on deputies either. They should not force 
them to immediately "produce" a particular law. There are some 
public illusions on this point too. The former Supreme Soviet 
adopted hundreds of laws like this, whose implementation was 
known in advance to be impossible. No good came of this. While 
creating a semblance of concern for Russia's citizens, these 
acts really deceived voters. 
  The Duma may "devise" the kind of voting machine that puts 
law making on a mass footing. But no political structure in the 
parliament today has an absolute majority and, to be honest, 
that is a boon for Russia. At the moment laws can only appear 
in our country as the result of sociopolitical compromise and 
accord. And that is the best result in the current conditions. 
  Now a few words about the priority laws. In my view the 
following should be part of the compulsory "30." In the 
political sphere -- a law on political parties and laws on 
elections of Russia's parliament and president. In the economic 
sphere -- a new Civil Code, amendments to the legislation on 
enterprises, on joint-stock companies, on the banking system, 
and on taxation. In the social sphere -- a package of laws on 
protection of impoverished groups, including new (or amendments 
to) pension legislation. Lastly, it is very important to amend 
criminal legislation and the legislation on criminal procedure. 
A new Criminal Code and a package of laws on fighting crime are 
needed. 
  That may be everything that the Duma realistically has time 
for during this very short period.

  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- The Liberal Democratic and 
Communist parties of Russia on Friday prevented the State Duma 
from approving the Federal Constitutional bill, "On the 
Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation" in first 
reading. The bill received 247 votes "for", 51 "against", and 
another 87 deputies abstained. The bill fell 53 votes short of 
the two-thirds approval needed in the 450-member State Duma, the 
parliament's lower chamber. 
  Liberal Democratic representatives said they abstained from 
the vote because they believe the regulations concerning the 
nomination and confirmation of candidates for positions on the 
Constitutional Court need to be changed. 
  The bill, prepared in accordance with the Constitution, 
declares that candidates are to be nominated by the president 
and confirmed by the Federation Council, the upper house. The 
Liberal Democratic Party would like to see the candidates 
subject to nation-wide discussion. 
  Deputies from the Communist Party voted against the bill, 
saying that the price for their support was a series of 
important amendments. They think that the Constitutional Court 
should have the power to independently raise the most important 
issues, that the State Duma should be able to propose court 
candidates to the president, that judges should be limited to 
ten years of service on the country's highest court, and that 
all the court's current judges should be re-elected to the 
expanded Constitutional Court. 
  The Communists' demands would automatically necessitate a 
constitutional amendment, since they contradict the basic law, 
Deputy Chairman of the Duma Mikhail Mitikov pointed out. 
  The State Duma committee on legislation and judical-legal 
reform has been ordered to continue work on the bill. Committee 
Chairman Vladimir Isakov announced that there is no "tragedy" in 
the fact that the document, which has already been agreed upon 
by all the branches of power and is supported by a majority of 
the Duma deputies, will have to be refined some more. He 
expressed his assurance that the Duma would be able to reach an 
agreement.

  [Text] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov held a news 
conference today devoted to the latest events in Crimea's 
political and economic life. He negatively commented on the 
introduction of the office of the Ukrainian president's 
representative in Crimea, describing this step as a political 
provocation aimed at hindering the second round of elections for 
the Crimean Supreme Council. Regarding presidential 
representative Valeriy Horbatov, Yuriy Meshkov said in a 
televised interview yesterday that Crimean interests are 
Horbatov's least concern, and that a honest man who cherishes 
these interests will not shake his hand. At the news 
conference, Meshkov added that the Republic of Crimea has lost 
one of its citizens. In a sharp and even offensive tone, 
Meshkov spoke of the Ukrainian leadership, which, in his 
opinion, prevents the Crimea from dealing with its economy, 
provokes confrontation, and creates tensions on the peninsula. 
The presence of military subunits saturated -- as he put it -- 
with nationalistic spirit not only does not guarantee Crimean 
security, but also threatens it. 
  Many questions from journalists concerned relations between 
Yuriy Meshkov and Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Yevhen Saburov. 
Meshkov stated that he corrected Saburov's mistakes by issuing 
another decree. Effective today, the previous low prices for 
bread are reinstated in the Crimea. The Crimean president does 
not share the concern that Saburov might be dismissed, which is 
being voiced behind the scenes.

  [Text] "Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov poses a danger to 
the world as well as Europe because his hasty actions might turn 
the Crimea into a hot spot," Nikolay Mikhalchenko, Ukrainian 
president's chief adviser on domestic issues told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine Thursday. 
  In his words, "if the situation is further destabilized in 
the Crimea, the Ukrainian authorities will do their best to have 
the Constitution of Ukraine respected and observed in the 
Crimea." 
  Mikhalchenko emphasized his absolute confidence that the new 
Ukrainian parliament will confirm the views of the previous one 
on the Crimea. 
  He said that certain people in the Crimea had for months 
been 
trying to provoke a deterioration of Russo-Ukrainian relations. 
  Mikhalchenko emphasized that Ukraine had on every occasion 
responded to specific violations of the Constitution and the 
law, "never precipitating the events. Kiev has done nothing 
that can be described as extremist or provocative." 
  He asked, "How can the Crimea be allowed to do what its 
authorities want while the Crimean president teaches contempt of 
legality to his citizens?"

<F P=106> [UNIAN report on interview with Ukrainian President Leonid </F>
Kravchuk by unidentified journalists: "The USSR Will Never Be 
Reestablished...."] 
  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk visited the 
UNIAN Agency and answered questions by journalists of the 
information agency and representatives of other mass media. 
  [Question] Proceeding from the results of the 27 March 
voting, please try to forecast the results of the second round 
of the Supreme Council elections. What steps will you take if 
less than 126 people's deputies are elected; what will you do if 
the number will range between 126 and 300; and, the third 
variant -- if more than 300 people's deputies are elected? 
  [Kravchuk] These are first elections in Ukraine as an 
independent state. That is why one cannot expect the highest 
level of democracy from them. No serious conflicts took place 
during the elections. There were isolated cases of unethical 
conduct. There were no conflicts involving rallies or strikes. 
  I would like one variant -- that a Supreme Council be 
elected 
and that the new Supreme Council do the following: First, adopt 
constitutional laws without which it is no longer possible to 
live, namely, on local power structures, the range of their 
jurisdiction, and the law on the President in accordance with 
Ukraine's Constitution. If these two laws are adopted, the 
[presidential] elections will be held on 26 June. 
  [Question] Who, in your opinion, can postpone the 
presidential elections: the new Supreme Council or, under 
certain circumstances, this can be done by the president? 
  [Kravchuk] It would be best if the new Supreme Council does 
this, because it would be a legitimate step.... However, in 
order for it to do this, it must be elected -- it is the most 
important problem. 
  [Question] In the opinion of experts, Belarus has embarked 
upon a road that may become the beginning of the renewal of the 
Union. How can this influence Ukraine's position with regard to 
the CIS? 
  [Kravchuk] Let us start with two important theses. First, 
the Soviet Union will never be reestablished. The second thesis 
lies in the fact that the CIS was not created as a Union and it 
is impossible to transform the CIS into the Union on the basis 
of those formative documents that were adopted by us.... It 
took the members of the European Union 35 years to create it, 
whereas we expect to do this by a single decision. It cannot be 
done by a decision. If there are no preconditions, no 
mechanisms will function. In my opinion, we must use the 
potential of the CIS and the potential of relations between 
states. Decisions on next steps must be adopted after asking 
the advice of the people and of the parliaments. 
  [Question] What is your attitude toward the statement by 
Ukraine's people's deputy Leonid Kuchma to the effect that 
people with "clean hands" must make Ukraine's new policy? 
  [Kravchuk] I read that statement. The former prime 
minister, who is presently president of the Ukrainian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, made his analysis proceeding 
from the facts of real life. However, for me, there arises one 
moral problem, more specifically, the answer to the question of 
who has led to this. The person who was also in the government 
and who put in effort to create the present situation is trying 
to shift the blame onto the government, the president, and other 
executive structures. 
  When Leonid Danylovych was "in power," the prices jumped 
tenfold and the correlation between the fund of consumption and 
the fund of accumulation was distorted. The worst cataclysms 
and strikes occurred precisely at that time. If you take the 
decrees adopted by the Kuchma government, those decrees have 
overturned everything. Today, I am signing guarantees for 
foreign firms that want, for example, to built the [oil] 
terminal. After those decrees, they no longer trust our laws. 
It is the most terrible thing to lose the trust of investors.... 
  In one of his recent statements, Leonid Kuchma stated as a 
goal the need to remove Kravchuk's "power party" from the 
leadership. When Vyacheslav Chornovil says such things, I can 
understand it (even though he also belonged to the "power party" 
when he headed the Lvov Oblast Council). However, for Leonid 
Kuchma, the "power party" was the "cradle." The "Pivdenmash" 
Production Association is the state within a state. Such a 
status made it possible to have everything that could be had: 
Kuchma was a member of the Communist Party Central Committee, a 
deputy, a director, and secretary of the Party Committee. Even 
now, Kuchma belongs to the "power party," because he heads the 
Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. Does he 
have a moral right to call for the removal of the "power party?" 
It is not for nothing that people ask: "And pray who are the 
judges?" [quotation from Griboyedov's play] 
  When Kuchma decided to quit the post of prime minister, we 
said that relations between us must remain normal. All of a 
sudden, Leonid Kuchma seems to have forgotten what he was saying 
to me. I did not see such cases anywhere in the world when a 
person who has left his post raises so much ado.... I have 
expressed my point of view, I kept silence [before], but I have 
said it now. If need be, I will say it again. 
  [UNIAN] Commenting upon the statement at the electoral 
station by the Supreme Council chairman Ivan Plyushch to the 
effect that only those people who are not sure of their strength 
are afraid to go to elections, Leonid Kravchuk said: 
  [Kravchuk] You will not succeed in causing me to fall out 
with Ivan Stepanovych [Plyushch]. He and I have shared and 
continue to share the same point of view on constitutional 
processes. When the Supreme Council is elected, it must adopt 
constitutional laws on local power structures and on the 
president....

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by President Leonid Kravchuk from </F>
the Market Reforms Press Center in Kiev by Volodymyr Kuzmenko; 
date not given -- all of Kravchuk's comments are recorded] 
  [Text] [Kuzmenko] So, one of the first questions to the 
president was this: After December 1991, the society of Ukraine 
has suffered many delusions. In connection with this, which one 
of them has proved to be the most harmful? This is how Leonid 
Kravchuk answered: 
  [Kravchuk] Our greatest delusion was the euphoria of a quick 
resolution of any problems posed by life. It seems to me that 
euphoria is a product of little or insufficient knowledge of the 
situation: The less one knows about this or that subject -- 
this, incidentally, is a philosophical interpretation --the 
simpler and (?very much clearer) everything seems to one. So, I 
would like to repeat this, the euphoria of the possibility to 
resolve any problems quickly due to insufficient knowledge or 
information of a distorted nature, is the greatest danger. 
  [Kuzmenko] Quite acute, I think, was a question asking the 
president whether he was not ashamed at Ukrainian Acting Prime 
Minister Yefim Zvyahilskiy's actions. The journalist's opinion 
was that these actions were antimarket. 
  [Kravchuk] I would like to specify one detail. The 
Zvyahilskiy government as such is nonexistent. This is the 
government which was left by Prime Minister Kuchma. This 
government, in its full composition, was not reshuffled. Taking 
into account the situation which took shape on the eve of the 
new elections, we considered it to be inexpedient [to change the 
government]. In other words, as the president, it seemed to me 
that the majority of deputies at first agreed to the fact that 
it would just be inexpedient to form a new government for six 
months, because it is clear that the new parliament would form a 
new government. And this is only natural. 
  I cannot say that I am ashamed of the Zvyahilskiy government 
because, despite the situation, it is exactly now, although with 
difficulty, that the reform began to make its first steps and we 
began to earn some currency to pay Russia for the power sources. 
But the real fact is that the first steps toward reforms, 
toward privatization, toward... [pauses] We are on the eve of 
possible... [pauses] preparation of the monetary reform. This 
is a reality. This is why now one cannot blame the government 
that works... [pauses] that we must be ashamed of it. I would 
not like to discuss and use such categories altogether. Every 
government is doing what it can. It cannot do more than that. 
The next government will probably do more, I am convinced of 
this. 
  [Kuzmenko] Answering the question on a concept of economic 
independence for Ukraine's separate regions, President Kravchuk 
said: 
  [Kravchuk] I adhere to the idea that regions should have the 
broadest possible economic independence. This refers to the 
mobilization of incomes, the administration of incomes, 
budgetary relations, the use of property, if this is the state 
property, the management of the property. Everything which has 
to do with production and social relations... [pauses] and they 
should have appropriate legally approved sources of receipts and 
they should work without the center. 
  As far as political federalization is concerned, I believe 
that this issue is premature. I do not rule out a possibility 
of working out political institutions, too, in future, on the 
basis of working out mechanisms of economic independence. But 
to raise the issue on complete federalization of our, for 
example, state today, immediately... [pauses] Well, first, this 
is objectively impracticable and, second, this could certainly 
affect both the reforms and all other political and economic 
processes, even to endanger the possibility of preserving the 
integrity of the state as such. 
  [Kuzmenko] In the context of this, the Market Reforms Press 
Club's sitting did not abstain from topical questions on the 
subject of Crimea. Explaining his position on this issue, the 
Ukrainian president said: 
  [Kravchuk] I favor the idea of granting the broadest 
possible 
economic powers to Crimea. I had a talk with the president, 
with [word indistinct] Saburov on these issues. I understand 
that it would not be easy to coordinate their economic 
independence with the legislation currently in force in Ukraine. 
However, there is the president's decree on granting relevant 
economic status to Crimea. Such a decree does exist, and 
proceeding from this decree and the law on the delimitation of 
plenary powers between Ukraine and Crimea, I believe that it is 
necessary to conduct a flexible policy here. One can even say 
that we could consider Crimea as a testing ground for economic 
reforms, if they would have been carried out there. 
  As far as other issues are concerned, now noneconomic 
issues are being aggravated. Not a single economic decree has 
been issued in Crimea so far, and no economic decisions have 
been made either. There is a decree on a referendum, we had to 
revoke it; a decree on changing over to Moscow time; and a 
groundless dismissal of Astakhov from the post of the chairman 
of the TV and radio company [of Crimea]. By the way, today I 
rescinded this decree by Meshkov. That is to say, excuse me for 
saying this, there is a political intrigue. There is a gross 
violation of the legislation by the president of Crimea, and not 
only the legislation of Ukraine, but his own legislation, 
according to the principle: There is the president, the people, 
and God. This is a dangerous stand, a dangerous policy. I 
believe that this is just some kind of misunderstanding. Maybe, 
these are the first steps of euphoria. I am waiting for this to 
stop. This cannot last forever. As far as economy is 
concerned, I am ready, and I again say we and the government are 
all ready to consider the issue so that the economy of Crimea 
would work in the interests of the people. 
  [Kuzmenko] Among the questions asked at the meeting, was the 
following: What importance and significance does the president 
attach to private capital in Ukraine's market reforms, and what 
is the role this capital can play in the sphere of the economy 
in the very near future? Here is how Mr. Kravchuk explained it: 
  [Kravchuk] There cannot be a real, civilized market without 
private ownership, without private capital and accordingly 
without banks and without financial structures. I am in favor 
of resolutely going in this direction. Resolutely! 
  What needs to be done, let us say, in terms of privatization 
in the broad sense of the word is the Supreme Council should 
adopt a provision that land together with the facilities can be 
an object of purchase and sale. This is the one thing that 
needs to be done. 
  I issued a directive stating that we were to sell 
incomplete- 
construction together with the land. Immediately, the land code 
was amended stopping it. That is, this is unrealistic until 
there is clarity on this issue, in parliament and executive 
power and at local authorities, that land is an object of 
purchase and sale together with the facilities built on it. 
  [Kuzmenko] The Ukrainian president said that inconsistent, 
irregular progress along the path of reforms was primarily 
caused by the government's ineffective actions. A correspondent 
asked the president a question about the idea of cancelling the 
early presidential election [on 26 June]. This is how Leonid 
Kravchuk commented on this situation: 
  [Kravchuk] I do not wish to alter my point of view. I 
expressed myself in favor of both early parliamentary and 
presidential elections. I am not altering this position. I 
only repeat that one cannot do the electing without knowing who 
to elect. This is why my view is this: The new parliament, I 
once again emphasize, cannot stand aside. It is simply 
impossible to imagine that there already is a new parliament. 
The election is drawing nearer and parliament is not voicing its 
view. It must express itself prior to the election on 
principle. This purely is a parliamentary prerogative. People 
are (?demanding this). 
  The status of the president is to be determined. The main 
parameters of executive power, its plenary and functional 
powers, and cooperation, are to be determined at constitutional 
level. This has to be a constitutional law. It cannot be 
otherwise. And only then, an election is to be appointed. That 
is all. If they manage to have it done by 26 June, the 
presidential election will go ahead on 26 June. But what if 
not? The new parliament all of sudden says: Let the president 
be elected on the basis of the powers that exist today under the 
old law. Well, there will be an election then. What else can 
be done? 
  One should, however, forecast the situation that there will 
be tomorrow. What can this lead to? One can take a purely 
legal stand and say: We adopted and signed [a decree on the 
presidential election], so let us execute it and not a step 
backwards. Can this be done? Yes, it can. But the situation 
has changed in time. Look at what difficulties have arisen in 
the economy and what processes have begun regionally, for 
instance, in Crimea and all. Not to see all this and not to 
take all this into consideration and just to say there should be 
elections for the sake of elections, I cannot. 
  I do not decide. As president, however, I cannot be silent 
and not tell the people what has happened and what can happen. 
I have my personal view, but I do not decide it. The election 
must take place, but with the powers and functions expressly 
determined at constitutional level with the participation of the 
new parliament. Nobody will make me change my mind. If this is 
to be without me, let them decide. After all, I am not blocking 
these processes. 
  [Kuzmenko] It is known that Ukraine is preparing to 
introduce 
its own currency unit. In this connection, the president said 
the transition to the hryvnya would be open and would take 
account of the interests of all Ukrainian citizens. 
  [Kravchuk] There is another problem which is that of the 
hryvnya's stabilization fund. When we settle all the issues 
with the International Monetary Fund [IMF] and manage to clarify 
all those budgetary and other matters, the IMF will grant us a 
stabilization credit. This is very important and it will be 
hard to work without this. 
  I would still like to return to commodity bonds. The 
Supreme Council vetoed them. There were opportune remarks. We 
now have worked this document over and its character now is 
entirely different. We have set up Ukraine's Credit Fund, which 
will specifically deal with attracting credit, including through 
commodity bonds of Ukraine's material resources rather than its 
national ones. It will be entities engaging in economic 
activity that will be responsible for the credit granted, rather 
than the whole of Ukraine, who was granted responsibility for 
it. That is, a clearer and more understandable mechanism has 
been worked out and it should be put into practice because 
credits have to be attracted. This money will primarily be 
invested, because it will have to be returned at a relatively 
low interest rate of up to around 7 percent, which is a normal 
international interest rate.

  [Text] Simferopol [no dateline as received] -- Mykola 
Mykhalchenko, the head of the Ukrainian president's service, who 
is now in Simferopol, held a news conference on 7 April. He 
told journalists that the appointment of the president's 
representative in Crimea was caused not only by the latest 
decrees by Yuriy Meshkov, but also by the resolutions of the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine that stipulate that the 
representation be introduced and a president's representative 
appointed in one month's time. The aim of the appointment is to 
remove opposition between Ukraine and Crimea. 
  Mykola Mykhalchenko reported that the Ukrainian president's 
representative in Crimea will supervise the fulfillment of the 
Constitution of Ukraine on the territory of the Crimea Republic 
and the fulfillment of the law on the delimitation of powers 
between the state power bodies of Ukraine and the Crimea 
Republic. He will be Ukraine's top official in charge of 
foreign political issues and will coordinate the actions by the 
power structures. The head of the Ukrainian president's service 
also pointed out that, in compliance with the law, the president 
and the Supreme Council of Crimea could sign agreements in 
economic and cultural spheres, and establish trade missions. 
However, the law does not envisage that they should perform 
diplomatic functions.

  [Text] "I intend to create a strong center in the 
newly-elected parliament in order to oppose both the right-and 
left-oriented forces," President of the Ukrainian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (UUIE) and Ukraine's ex-premier 
Leonid Kuchma announced at a press conference on 6 March in Lvov. 
  During the first round of voting to the Ukrainian parliament 
Communists gained a substantial success in Eastern Ukraine and 
National Democrats and National Radicals -- in Western Ukraine. 
  The second voting in elections to the parliament will be 
held 
9-10 April. 
  In Kuchma's opinion, Ukraine "has already crossed the 
threshhold beyond which is mass industrial recession." He 
placed the responsibility for this on the government and 
National Bank. 
  As Kuchma said, he will insist "on the need for a single 
economic space without which the republics of the former USSR 
cannot survive."

<F P=106> [Article by PRESSOVA AGENTSIYA NOVIN correspondent G. </F>
Cherniy, special for AKTSENT: "Laxatives for Ukraine"] 
  [Text] The Ukraine Law "On Making Changes and Addition To 
the Ukraine Law `On Liens,'" signed by President of Ukraine L. 
Kravchuk on 25 February, went into effect last week. Now the 
Ukrainian lien law allows a foreign investor, in the event of 
debtor's delinquency or insolvency, to be compensated by real 
estate. 
  At the same time, the latest wording of this law dispelled 
the last doubt regarding the supreme executive authorities' 
plans for state property and the course of privatization in 
Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, Lugansk, and Donetsk Oblasts, whose 
administrations now have the right to decide on the fate of 
mortgage deals. Let us recall: "A state enterprise (as a rule, 
already beached--author's note), to which property is attached 
with right of full economic maintenance, may on its own mortgage 
this property, with the exception of an integrated property 
complex, its structural units, buildings, and structures, which 
may be mortgaged with permission and on terms approved by the 
body authorized to administer corresponding state property." 
  It this good or bad? It is so good that it frightens me. It 
is good because despite completely unfounded resistance on the 
part of the parliament, President L. Kravchuk did find a way to 
attract large investors to Ukraine. After all, in the sphere of 
investment activities Ukraine is hopelessly behind not only 
Russia, but also Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and other newly 
independent states. It may happen that a few years from now 
Ukraine will be studying the phenomenon of growth of, for 
instance, Kazakhstan, in whose economy about $17 billion in 
investment will be attracted this year alone. 
  Meanwhile, in the opinion of Aleksandr Savchenko, executive 
director of a department in the European Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development, large Western investors are kept away from 
Ukraine by inconsistencies in its foreign policy, domestic 
political crisis, and the lack of political will in conducting 
economic reforms. 
  That is why at this point Ukraine is getting either 
insignificant investment in quick-return projects (airports, 
terminals, oil pipelines, hotels, etc.), or large investment in 
which the creditor dictates everything and bureaucrats take 
their share in commissions. One does not have to look far to 
find examples. The Ministry of Health has been buying laxatives 
of the "purgen" type in quantities sufficient to provide relief 
for the whole of Europe for a year. While the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Food during L. Kravchuk's visit to Washington 
bought with seven-year interest-free credit 70,000 tonnes of soy 
at a price exceeding the average by $40-50 per tonne. One should 
not look a gift horse in the mouth. Especially considering that 
if anyone does become constipated, it is bureaucrats on foreign 
junkets--not ordinary folk who are undernourished most of the 
time these days. 
  In short, the birth of the lien law in Ukraine is, on one 
hand, a joyous event. One the other, it is scary because, 
judging by the effectiveness of state regulation, we cannot 
expect fast changes in industry, which means we will have to 
play a handicapped hand against foreign capital. But this is not 
all bad, either: One can avoid compliance even with the 
president of Ukraine's edict, but there is no way to dodge the 
commonly accepted rules of the market game, which the leadership 
of our state fears so much.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Zaporizhzhya Atomic Electric </F>
Power Plant [AES] Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow"] 
  [Text] Last year, Zaporizhzhya atomic engineers alone 
produced 27,567,000 million kilowatt-hours of electric energy. 
Over the last year, the share of the AES's in Ukraine's power 
engineering rose from 29 to 33 percent. 
  However, unfortunately, alongside this, there also are other 
kinds of increase. Over 1993, at the Zaporizhzhya AES, for 
example, there were 79 cases of faulty operation of power units. 
  Among other problems, there is the shortage of funds for 
purchasing nuclear fuel in Russia. As a consequence, the fuel 
could only be purchased for three out of five units, at which 
fuel must be reloaded this year. 
  Specialists of the Zaporizhzhya AES themselves decided to 
tackle the problem of storing the used fuel directly in the 
plant's industrial area. A contract has been concluded between 
the "Zaporizhzhya AES" Production Association and the U.S. 
company "Duke Power" on constructing temporary dry-storage 
depots. Today, this is the safest and the most reliable design.

  [Text] Head of the Yeltsin administration's information 
department Petr Filippov believes that the spectrum of political 
forces involved in fleshing out a civic peace pact must be 
limited. In an interview with Interfax on Thursday, he said it 
made no sense to try to involve such hardline opposition members 
as those granted amnesty recently in work over the draft. 
  "If these people say they will agree to sign pact under 
their 
own terms, there can be no question of consensus with them," 
Filippov said. "I cannot really see how it will be possible to 
sign a peace pact with a party like Barkashov's," he added. 
  The official said that "if there is a certain group of 
people 
who uphold extremist views, this does not mean that society must 
seek a compromise with them." The question is one of opening 
dialogue between the government and a civilized opposition, 
Filippov believes.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Russian Federation Vice President </F>
Aleksandr Rutskoy by Tatyana Romanenkova and Aleksey Vorobyev; 
place, date not given: "...Faith and Hope Should Be Given to 
the Living"] 
  [Excerpts] [PRAVDA] Aleksandr Vladimirovich, it is six 
months since the tragic events in Moscow in October 1993, since 
the barbaric bombardment of the Russian House of Soviets. The 
majority of our fellow citizens have already managed to work out 
who was the criminal during those days and who emerged as the 
fatherland's genuine defender. How would you assess these 
events against the backdrop of our country's history and how 
far, in your view, has the development of our civil society, and 
of democracy in Russia in general, been put back? 
  [Rutskoy] First of all the events of those days are a 
disgrace for us all. A disgrace for the nation. When the 
people stop considering themselves a nation, they become a 
population, a large group of private individuals, a crowd which 
can be manipulated at will and tricked at every turn. On the 
other hand, when people live with self-respect, aware that each 
person is an individual representing a great nation and a 
citizen of a great state, they will never allow such a thing to 
happen. They will simply not permit anyone to exceed their 
authority or that of the Constitution. Unfortunately, this did 
happen here. The citizen's respect for his state was trampled 
on, shot to pieces. People were broken. Therefore, this was, 
alas, nothing but a tragedy for this great nation. [passage 
omitted] 
  [PRAVDA] The idea of an accord is being discussed widely in 
society today. It is noticeable that a few people are 
attempting to use this exclusively for their own mercenary ends, 
and a section of the presidential team sees the signing of such 
an agreement more or less as an oath of loyalty to B. Yeltsin 
personally. Is there nevertheless any chance of some kind of 
national accord in society today? 
  [Rutskoy] We have been talking about civil accord since 
February 1992, when the "Civic Union" was formed. Its original 
slogan was civil accord. In other words, the creation of 
conditions in which each citizen is clearly aware of the 
country's aims, which tasks will be carried out, and what each 
person will get from this. At that time this idea was not 
successfully implemented and we were in many regards not to 
blame for this. 
  Now the president himself has begun to talk about accord. 
However, he is again basing it only on a small circle of 
politicians. But, you see, an accord signed by some leaders or 
other is not a people's accord, a civil accord. This is only 
possible when society is stable. When the people have food and 
housing, and when you and your property are protected. 
  Whereas earlier the reforms could have been adjusted and 
channeled into performing vitally important priority tasks 
affecting the stability of society, now it is already too late. 
Everything which could have been destroyed has been; the country 
and people have been forced to protest. A new policy, a policy 
to extricate the country from this impasse, a policy of reforms 
for the people, is now essential to stop our chaotic state 
descending into criminality. How much longer can we play the 
fool by trifling with this discredited regime and government, 
surely we realize who these people are, what goals they are 
pursuing, and what they are capable of? Surely we realize that 
a government which brought the state and its economy to the 
point of absolute crisis is not capable of overcoming this 
crisis? For the reason that it not only does not know how to do 
this, but is also incapable of doing it. How can we talk about 
adjusting the reforms now? What kind of accord can there be and 
with whom? With those who plundered and ruined the country? 
With those who deprived children of the opportunity to have a 
vacation, who did away with young pioneer camps and sports 
schools, and who forced people to clamber over the rubbish 
heaps? With those who destroyed our science, Army, culture, 
education, and health service? With those who destroyed our 
entire state? 
  [PRAVDA] But what way out of the current serious crisis is 
there then? 
  [Rutskoy] There is much to discuss in this regard, but I 
will limit myself to this. In order to extricate our country 
from the current crisis, it is essential first and foremost to 
create a management system. To evaluate our resources (not the 
mythical aid and credits from foreign states which, 
incidentally, will have to be repaid), work out what are the 
priority tasks for the economy and the social sphere which 
affect society's stability, and develop new market economic 
relations and civilized entrepreneurship in this very direction, 
and not speculation calling it business. 
  The following priorities are obvious to every citizen: food, 
housing, health, education, and spiritual and physical 
development. These issues will and can be resolved; no one will 
go to rallies or strikes, and it will not be necessary to 
indulge in demagoguery about an "accord." The execution of 
these seemingly narrow tasks will have extensive economic 
consequences which will allow us to rescue from the mire not 
only agriculture, the construction industry, medicine, 
education, and sport, but the economy as a whole. We will 
create new forms of management which will work for the 
individual. Therefore, whether we like it or not, a 
concentration of the state's strengths and assets is necessary, 
first and foremost to carry out these very priority tasks. 
  Only then will the people feel that the state exists for 
them, that people have become individuals and not some gullible 
sheep; then labor discipline and responsibility to society and 
the state will appear in each person. You should not harbor any 
illusions that things may change for the better with this 
president and government. Therefore, it is essential to stop 
this pretense about consensuses and agreements and get on with 
things, having replaced the authorities by legal means. 
  [PRAVDA] What lessons have you yourself learned from 
everything that has happened? 
  [Rutskoy] The first lesson is that you should not have blind 
faith, especially in serious politics. Second, it is necessary 
to be more reserved, not to give vent to your emotions. Third, 
I had intended to quit politics, to give it all up. I do after 
all have civilian skills -- I am an artist, an aviation 
engineer, and pilot. I could also work as an entrepreneur. 
  But to leave politics today would be treachery, primarily to 
those people who put their trust in me. I have never suffered 
from delusions of grandeur or striven to get into power, but I 
am sure that it is now simply immoral to quit and abandon 
everything and everybody. 
  I will always remember those who performed their civil duty 
to the very end when they defended the Russian Constitution in 
September-October. I want the Russian people to know that there 
was not a single bandit, "red-brownshirt," or fascist among us. 
They were ordinary people, our fellow citizens, and fate will 
bring us together again on more than one occasion. 
  I appeal to you, in honoring the memory of the fallen -- 
some 
people were also wounded, some survived -- whoever is not 
indifferent about our fatherland's fate, I want to assure you: 
We are all necessary to the homeland, to resurrect this great 
power, this great nation. 
  With faith, hope, and love for the fatherland we will 
achieve 
happiness, the life we deserve, and greatness for our people and 
country.

  [Text] Moscow, April 8 (AFP) -- Former Russian vice 
president Aleksandr Rutskoy has called for early general 
elections, saying this was the only way to establish 
"legitimate" authority in Russia, and said he would run for 
president if asked. "Only early, simultaneous presidential and 
legislative elections can bring legitimate power to the 
country," Rutskoy said in an interview conducted Thursday [7 
April] with AFP. 
  Rutskoy, 47, said it was still to early to speak in detail 
about his plans for becoming a presidential candidate, noting 
that Russia still had no law on presidential elections and that 
no date for the vote had yet been fixed. 
  "It is not enough simply to want to run," Rutskoy stated. 
"But if I am asked to run I believe I would accept because I 
know what to do and how to do it to stop the current chaos and 
assure that Russians have a life worthy of citizens of a great 
country," he said. 
  Rutskoy, who provided written and oral responses to 
questions 
from AFP, denied he favored rebuilding the Soviet Union, but 
called for a "new union" based on the Russian empire as it 
existed prior to 1917, excluding Poland and Finland. "The 
creation of a new, powerful, federal state which would be called 
Russia can be done," Rutskoy stated. 
  He also sharply criticized President Boris Yeltsin's plan 
for 
all the main political forces in the country to sign a pact 
known as the "Agreement on Obtaining Civil Accord" which the 
Kremlin says is needed to curtail extremism in Russian politics. 
  "An accord with whom and for what?" Rutskoy said. "I don't 
want to sign anything with the people who have devastated the 
country and fired on its parliament and its people." 
  The former Afghan war hero, elected vice president in June 
1991 as President Boris Yeltsin's running mate, was dressed 
casually and appeared relaxed during the 40-minute interview, 
conducted in an office in his central Moscow apartment. He said 
he had spent a good deal of time reflecting on the state of 
Russia during the five months he sat in Moscow's high-security 
Lefortovo prison after being jailed for his role in leading the 
October 1993 parliamentary revolt. 
  Referring to the latest spate of rumors on his former boss's 
health, Rutskoy said the country had a right to be kept informed 
on the physical and psychological condition of the head of 
state. "All the more so when you're talking about a nuclear 
power," he stated. 
  Rutskoy repeated his previous criticism of reforms carried 
out over the past two years, saying during that time Russia had 
become "a third-rate, colonial, mafia, totalitarian and corrupt 
state." "The dollar has become the national money and the ruble 
a crumpled candy wrapper," he stated. 
  Rutskoy said his new ideology was based on a combination of 
religious faith and a "national spirit" that had been forgotten 
by many during the seven decades of communist rule and in the 
past two years of democratic change. Implementing this ideology 
"will produce the most important thing: the rebirth of Russian 
power," he stated. 
  Rutskoy has joined a newly-created opposition bloc known as 
"Accord for Russia" which is due to hold its founding congress 
next month and which some analysts view as the organizational 
springboard for his presidential bid. 
  He said he was currently working on two books -- "Collapse 
of 
a Power" and "The Discovery of Faith" -- recounting his personal 
experiences and his views on the events that have rocked his 
country in recent years. "I will make an objective study of 
what has happened to us and how we have found ourselves in this 
shameful situation," he said. "There will also be new 
approaches on building the state and economic reforms" in the 
books, Rutskoy stated. 
  [Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in Russian on 8 April, page 2, 
runs an INTERFAX report under the "Opposition" rubric, which 
adds: "The constituent congress of the "Accord for Russia" 
movement will take place in Moscow on 19 May, said Vasiliy 
Lipitskiy, leader of the `Free Russia' People's Party and a 
State Duma deputy. This date was set 6 April at the meeting of 
the movement's group of activists, attended by former Vice 
President Aleksandr Rutskoy, Constitutional Court Judge Valeriy 
Zorkin, Agrarian Party leader Mikhail Lapshin, Petr Romanov, and 
Amangeldy Tuleyev, as well as Federation Council deputies and 
other signatories of the declaration on setting up the 
movement."]

  [Text] Moscow April 7 TASS -- "Aleksey Ilyushenko remains 
acting procurator-general of the Russian Federation, and Aleksey 
Kazannik is not Russia's chief prosecutor," Yeltsin's aide 
Georgiy Satarov told ITAR-TASS after the Federation Council 
passed a resolution defying Yeltsin's decree dismissing Kazannik 
from the post. 
  He explained that "Aleksey Kazannik is not 
procurator-general 
because his candidature was not presented to the Federation 
Council and was not endorsed in the post in the first place." 
  Commenting on today's decision of the upper chamber, Satarov 
said that "it was not a legal but a political decision. The 
Federation Council interpreted the Constitution, which amounts 
to violating it," he stressed. 
  According to Satarov, the situation reflects a conflict 
between two standards one of which is coming to replace the 
other." One was set by the president's decree 1400 appointing 
Aleksey Kazannik procurator-general, and the other is set in the 
Constitution, under which the procurator general must be 
nominated by the president and confirmed by the Federation 
Council. 
  According to Satarov, Boris Yeltsin accepted Kazannik's 
resignation to resolve the conflict of the two norms and thus 
cleared space for the new constitution." 
  Satarov thinks that this legal uncertainty, which arose in 
the wake of the Federation Council's move today "further 
complicates the struggle against crime and blocks the activity 
of the procurator's office."

  [Text] Moscow April 7 ITAR-TASS -- The press secretary of 
the president of the Russian Federation, Vyacheslav Kostikov 
issued a statement today, which says: 
  "Emotions prevailed over politics in the course of 
discussion 
of the question about the procurator-general in the Federation 
Council. This is characteristic of Russia's fresh state 
institutions. "But real facts exist apart from emotions. 
  "It is a reality that Aleksey I. Kazannik tendered his 
resignation of his own free will. 
  "It is a reality that the president accepted his resignation 
and named a new candidate for the post. 
  "These realities cannot be ignored. 
  "Hence, it is necessary to look for a way out of the 
situation. 
  "A situation of vacuum or double power cannot be allowed to 
emerge in the sphere of prosecutorship. This blocks the entire 
system of prosecuting activity at a time when the country is 
engulfed by a wave of crime. It will be difficult to make clear 
to the people why an impasse appeared in which the Federation 
Council has found itself. The prestige of this body can suffer 
as a result. 
  "The Federation Council cannot be permitted to become the 
initiator of political braking at a moment when Russia has begun 
its movement toward concord. 
  "One would like to believe that the Federation Council will 
act proceeding primarily from the supreme interests of the 
state. The possibilities for this are far from exhaustion."

  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- Former Russian prosecutor 
general Aleksey Kazannik confirmed his resignation on Friday on 
his own will and no pressure was exerted on him, according to 
speaker of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko. 
  "Kazannik adopted the decision on his own initiative", he 
told TASS adding that the former prosecutor asked to be given 
the floor for his statement why [as received] talking to a group 
of deputies. 
  "The essence of his speech was important to me and I 
realised 
that regardless of political colours the essence was correct and 
aimed at achieving civic peace in society", Shumeyko said. "That 
is why we have agreed to give the floor to Kazannik", he added. 
  Shumeyko believes that in a couple of weeks the upper 
chamber 
will return to the issue of the prosecutor general. It will 
accept Kazannik's resignation and will consider the new 
candidate nominated by the president - Aleksey Ilyushenko.

  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS--Alexey Kazannik, the former 
Russian prosecutor general, confirmed his resignation at a 
meeting of the Federation Council on Friday. Speaker of the 
upper chamber Vladimir Shumeyko said that this ends the dispute 
over the prosecutor general. 
  The Federation Council snubbed the Russian president on 
Thursday by reinstating Kazannik as the prosecutor general which 
it could not do as Kazannik was not nominated by Boris Yeltsin. 
According to the Constitution, it is the Federation Council 
which appoints the prosecutor, but the candidate is to be 
nominated by the president. 
  Kazannik resigned after freeing anti-Yeltsin rebels 
according 
to the Duma-proclaimed amnesty and Yeltsin accepted his 
resignation. The president then appointed Alexey Ilyushenko as 
acting prosecutor general. After the Federation Council refused 
to sack Kazannik, Georgiy Satarov, a Yeltsin's aide, said the 
decision did not mean that he would be reinstated. Ilyushenko 
would remain acting prosecutor general, according to him. Most 
observers said the decision of the upper chamber was based on 
political grounds, not on juridical ones.

  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- Former Russian Prosecutor 
General Alexey Kazannik warned on Friday that a dictatorship is 
coming in Russia because the president ignores the constitution 
and laws. He told the Federation Council that he had adopted 
the final decision to resign because "the president and his 
entourage have shown once again that they are not going to abide 
by the constitution, law, the resolutions of the State Duma and 
the Federation council". 
  "Open dictatorship is coming", he said and expressed 
conviction that Russia "will get a true president and an 
independent prosecutor general in the coming years". He praised 
the legislature by saying that "Russia took pains and received 
an independent parliament which respects the constitution". 
  Kazannik said that he is resigning "in order to unite all 
progressive forces of Russia". "I did not want to become a 
source of confrontation between different political forces", he 
told reporters and added that "the president and his 
administration would not have allowed him to work because they 
do not need an independent prosecutor". 
  He denied claims that he simply wanted to return to his 
high-ranking post. "I strived to preserve the Office of the 
Prosecutor General as a single system, to avert political 
repressions, ensure the supremacy of law, protect the rights of 
citizens", he said. Kazannik added that now he intends to 
create a mighty "party of unity and national progress" and will 
begin organising it in the regions because, as he said, he 
"enjoys great support there".

  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- Boris Yeltsin ruled to create 
an expert-analytical council, an analytical centre at the 
president [as received] and an information-technical centre of 
analytical research at the presidential administration in order 
"to improve the analytical and information provision of the 
Russian president and the quality of preparing the decisions of 
the president", the office of the Russian leader said on Friday. 
Marat Guriyev was appointed the head of the new 
information-technical centre. 
  The decision came one day after a scandal caused by a 
resolution of the president which mentioned Latvia among 
possible countries where Russia intends to have its military 
bases. 
  Presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov explained on 
Thursday that Latvia was mentioned in the document because of a 
"technical mistake". However, a source in the presidential 
administration told TASS the restructuring was not linked with 
the "technical mistake" and was a planned reorganisation. The 
source added that Guriyev's appointment was a promotion. 
  Yeltsin also dissolved his analytical centre for general 
policy and the analytical centre for social-economic policy.

  [Text] Moscow, 8 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin has signed an edict on the Russian Federation's 
presidential expert analysis service. The Expert Analysis 
Council and the Analysis Center attached to the Russian 
Federation president as well as the Information Technology 
Center for Analytical Research within the presidential 
administration are being set up in order to improve provision of 
analytical and information services for the Russian Federation 
president.

  [Text] Vice-Premier, Minister for Nationalities and 
Regional Policy of the Russian Federation Sergey Shakhray 
expressed the opinion that he will be in charge of national and 
regional policy in the government, as well as relations with the 
Federal Assembly and the media. He gave an interview to 
INTERFAX after the president issued a decree nominating Shakhray 
the deputy prime minister. Shakhray noted that a final decision 
on the range of his duties will be taken at a meeting of the 
government presidium. 
  Shakhray said that after the new appointment he has no 
intention of losing his deputy mandate. He pointed out that he 
is not working in the ruling structures in the State Duma. "My 
job in the lower chamber of the parliament boils down to 
coordination of activities of the Russian Unity and Accord 
Party's faction," he noted.

<F P=106> [Interview with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, chairman of the </F>
Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin faction in the Duma, by Andrzej Rybak; 
place and date not given: "Weimar in Moscow"] 
  [Text] [Rybak] President Yeltsin is sick, a situation 
increasingly reminiscent of Leonid Brezhnev. Does Russia need a 
new president immediately? 
  [Yavlinskiy] I do not wish to discuss Boris Yeltsin's 
health. There is another reason to hold presidential elections: 
Russia experienced a tragedy in October 1993. Every president 
has the moral duty to face the electorate as soon as possible, 
but Yeltsin has not done so. 
  [Rybak] You are one of the most popular politicians in 
Russia. Are you going to run in the coming presidential 
elections? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Yes, if the elections are held in a legal 
manner. I must show that people of other generations, people 
with different political convictions, can make politics in 
Russia. And: I am going to win these elections. 
  [Rybak] You want to take over a ruined country in which 
national communists are already causing trouble. Can a 
bloodbath still be prevented? 
  [Yavlinskiy] In January, we produced 24 percent less than in 
the previous January. Four thousand enterprises are idle. The 
situation is serious but not hopeless. However, the president 
and the government are behaving as if there were no crisis at 
all. In such a situation, tension is inevitable. But I do not 
want to rush to conclusions. 
  [Rybak] How much more deprivation can the Russians take? 
  [Yavlinskiy] The people's patience has been stretched beyond 
its limits. But one dare not even think about a social 
upheaval. It would plunge the country and the world into an 
unimaginable disaster. 
  [Rybak] The constitution gives Boris Yeltsin enormous power. 
But is he really the master over the situation? 
  [Yavlinskiy] No president can manage such a quantity of 
power, and certainly not our president. The consequence of this 
is that his power apparatus is becoming independent and he is 
under no social control. No one can say who makes the decisions 
or who influences them. Yeltsin is running the country in an 
increasingly authoritarian manner. 
  [Rybak] Is that not extremely dangerous? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Even Hindenburg divided the German Parliament. 
He wanted to put an end to the Weimar Republic conditions. And 
what happened? The situation in Russia today is very similar. 
The birth of fascism is following a roundabout route. 
Democratic chaos followed by authoritarianism and then fascism. 
  [Rybak] Does Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's success mean the 
dawning 
of fascism? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Zhirinovskiy is a warning. 
  [Rybak] A change of course is taking place in Russian 
foreign policy. Is Russia seeking to reestablish its empire? 
  [Yavlinskiy] The borders between Russia and the former 
Soviet republics exist only on paper. They are no longer 
guarded. Therefore there is a great danger that ethnic conflicts 
will spread from these republics into Russia. We must 
counteract them. 
  [Rybak] But the Russian Army is itself fanning unrest. It 
is pursuing its own policy in the former republics! 
  [Yavlinskiy] In Russia, everyone is still pursuing his own 
policy -- the Finance Ministry, the Central Bank, and the 
Economics Ministry. That is why the situation is so chaotic. 
The president is also trying to pursue two separate political 
paths at the same time, a democratic path on the one hand and a 
megalo-Russian one on the other. He wants to please all the 
lobbies, but he is enmeshing himself in contradictions. 
  [Rybak] The latest announcements are rekindling old fears. 
Will Russia again be an evil empire? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Yeltsin is a populist. He was a great democrat 
as long as he believed that democracy was very popular. Now 
that he has seen how popular Zhirinovskiy is, he is trying to 
copy him. That is naive. He will not lure the nationalists this 
way, but he will certainly lose his own supporters. Do you want 
to know what Russian politics is going to look like? Then watch 
Zhirinovskiy. Yeltsin wants to be liked, and he wants to stay in 
power. 
  [Rybak] U.S. economics expert Jeffrey Sachs is accusing the 
West of not having rendered adequate financial support to the 
radical reforms. 
  [Yavlinskiy] Why should the West have done so? I do not 
believe in the current leadership, so I would not give it too 
much money. 
  [Rybak] But Russia might overcome the economic crisis more 
successfully if it receives Western aid. 
  [Yavlinskiy] Last year, $15 billion worth of capital left 
Russia. What is the point of granting credits if they 
immediately go back to the West, only this time into other 
people's pockets? 
  [Rybak] Is Yeltsin right to demand a slowdown of the 
reforms? 
  [Yavlinskiy] No. The reforms must continue at a rapid pace. 
But they must be genuine reforms. Up to now we have been 
dealing with quasi-reforms in Russia. Just imagine that you 
want to travel from Hamburg to Berlin, but you board the train 
to Flensburg instead. You keep on traveling, but you never 
reach Berlin. It makes no difference if the train is traveling 
fast or slow. First you must board the right train and in the 
right direction.

  [Text] Commenting on his decision to leave the Russia's 
Choice faction to journalists on Thursday, deputy of the State 
Duma Gennadiy Burbulis noted that this is "not a departure from 
the democratic movement in general, but a breakthrough to the 
social and professional environment which needs most active and 
concrete support today." 
  Announcing his resignation from the faction on Thursday, 
Burbulis explained his step by his intention to set up a new 
democratic movement. 
  In his opinion, the new movement should include 
representatives from all regions of the Russian Federation who 
"have never been engaged in political activities, but by their 
views and convictions are the most active supporters and 
defenders of the democratic reforms in Russia." 
  Burbulis also noted that "it would be politically wrong for 
him to proclaim a new democratic party or movement now." "Let it 
happen from inside, from regions," Burbulis said. 
  Asked about his attitude to Yegor Gaydar's plans to create a 
new party called Russia's Choice, Burbulis noted that "it is 
already impossible to stop these plans." "Let the new party be 
born," Burbulis said noting that it would not fulfil its 
expectations, 
  Burbulis also noted that he would like to be "kind of a 
bridge" between the party Russia's Choice and the new democratic 
movement which he envisages. 
  [Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 1451 GMT on 7 April 1994 
adds: "Commenting on this move, Russia's Choice Leader Yegor 
Gaydar expressed "deep regret" over it. "Although Gennadiy 
Burbulis's decision will have serious consequences for the 
faction, it should not be dramatized", he noted. Another member 
of the Russia's Choice faction, Stepan Sulakshin, followed suit 
and announced his intention to quit the faction at the same 
meeting."

  [Text] Member of the Russia's Choice (RC) faction in the 
State Duma, Stepan Sulakshin, says he intends to defect to the 
unregistered parliamentary group known as the December 12 Union. 
To be registered, the group must win over six people. 
  In an interview with Interfax, the group's co-chairman 
Yevgeniy Bushmin said two more members of RC -- Rashid 
Ismaghilov and Vladimir Yuzhakov -- are negotiating to switch 
over as well. And, according to Bushmin, one or two members of 
the New Regional Politics group could be expected to join the 
"Decembrists" ranks. Bushmin refused to identify these. 
  Another leader of the December 12 Union group, Irina 
Khakamada, told Interfax she was dissatisfied with the RC's 
decision to show understanding if some of its members sided with 
the Decemebr 12 Union group. In Khakamada's view, the RC could 
have moved to help Decenber 12 devotees by campaigning for their 
official recognition and rights as a group in parliament. 
  On Friday Gennadiy Burbulis also announced his decision to 
leave the Russia's Choice group.

  [Text] The Russia's Choice parliamentary group approved at 
its Thursday meeting the proposal made by Boris Fedorov, the 
leader of the unregistered group December 12 Union, that the two 
groups start closer cooperation on most important issues on the 
agenda of the lower house. 
  Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar also told his supporters 
that the December 12 Union was short of members to be registered 
officially. It had 29 while 35 were needed for official 
registration. The Russia's Choice adopted a decision saying 
that it would not punish its members who voluntarily join the 
December 12 Union. 
  Gleb Yakunin called for a closer bloc between the two 
groups. 
Gaydar supported the idea and said that he would help the 
setting up of a club of democratic deputies. Gaydar also said 
that he had called on Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of another 
pro-democracy faction, to work closer together and that Fedorov 
had done the same.

  [Text] The State Duma Russia's Choice group "received with 
interest and understanding the proposal advanced by Kazakh 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev on the setting up of a Euro-Asian 
union" but was convinced that the formation of such a union was 
impossible without tenacious efforts by legislative and 
executive bodies, politicians and businessmen in the countries 
that might join the union, says the group's statement made 
public Thursday. 
  The statement insisted that to make such a union possible 
"the economic systems of our countries have to converge, customs 
and monetary unions set up and legislations brought into line 
with one another." 
  Russia's Choice did not back the introduction of a 
transnational currency while "the Russian ruble has been fairly 
successfully performing this function" or the setting up of a 
transnational bank. 
  One essential condition for the integration processes to 
succeed, Russia's Choice felt, was that "closer ties between the 
states and formation of unions should not harm the economic 
interests of the Russians."

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] Kozyrev said that numerous politicians felt no 
responsibility for what they were doing to their country. 
"Regrettably, our numerous partners in the West fail to 
understand that some Russian politicians, notably the LDPR 
[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, are more interesting for medical than for 
political science. Western businessmen tend to abandon plans to 
invest in Russia after reading in newspapers what such politicos 
have to say. The net effect is obviously anti-Russian, not 
patriotic," he said. 
  Kozyrev was confident that Zhirinovskiy, a clownish figure, 
would not be elected anywhere again. 
  Kozyrev would like to switch the foreign policy from 
ideology 
and man-made problems inherited from the cold war to everyday 
problems of common people, above all in Russian outlying regions 
which make the core of Russia. 
  In Kozyrev's view, "the state should not harm the regions or 
obstruct their development. There is much talk of unemployment 
while roads deep inside Russia are such that one is afraid of 
riding them. Road construction is the sphere where quite a lot 
of people can be employed."

<F P=106> [Oana Stanciulescu article: "ROMANIA LIBERA Has Obtained a </F>
Sensational Document -- The Study Was Done by Military Experts 
Under the Coordination of the Foreign Intelligence Service: 
Zhirinovskiy's Earthquakes Are Threatening Romania"] 
  [Text] Related to various speculation that is being made in 
connection with the mysterious weapon mentioned by Russian 
ultra- nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Romanian 
experts have reached the conclusion that actually one has to 
deal with a maneuver launched by special Russian bodies intended 
to intoxicate public opinion, and which, owing to lack of 
information, have managed to fool the mass media in the West and 
even in our country. Thus, they went so far as to consider the 
Elipton a sonic weapon, a biological weapon, and even a 
microwave weapon, while the true nature of this 
military-technical system was lost in the general cacophony. 
  Elipton is a weapon system based on gravitational 
interference. After the last catastrophic earthquake that shook 
Yerevan, U.S. military analysts revealed two strange things: 
The catastrophe, which seemed to be a natural one, occurred at 
a "providential" moment to halt Armenia's autonomist tendencies 
and it also offered the Soviet political-military authorities a 
good pretext to liquidate the Armenian nuclear power industry, 
and thus impose an acute energy dependence on that central 
republic; the second element refers to the fact that 
early-warning satellites recorded an orbital "double lightning," 
which preceded, by a very short time, the earthquake. That was 
an unmistakable sign of the detonation of a small-size nuclear 
load, contravening all currently valid international treaties. 
It was easy to draw conclusions: The Soviets have discovered a 
way to trigger earthquakes. Ten months later, using a rocket 
launched from an F-15 fighter-bomber (ASAT system), the United 
States managed to intercept, for the first time, a low-orbit 
satellite. The system was allegedly designed to destroy Soviet 
spy satellites, but actually it was the sole efficient defense 
to counter the use of the Elipton over U.S. territory. However, 
certain rumors had already reached the ears of the mass media -- 
it was the time when many people believed in an imminent and 
catastrophic reactivation of the San Andreas fault, some sources 
even held it possible that "half of California would sink into 
the ocean," as a consequence of a devastating earthquake. 
  The advantages of the Elipton are obvious: It is a discreet 
weapon, and any accusations can be brushed off by saying it is a 
"phantasm," provided that it is used by daylight, so that its 
lightning could be camouflaged by the sun's natural light. 
  It is quite significant that merely three days after 
Zhirinovskiy's extremely allusive statement regarding the 
Elipton, the Geophysical Institute of the Russian Academy 
organized a news conference on the issue of seismic weapons, 
although no one had explicitly talked about such a thing. That 
news conference seems to be rather the result of panic. The 
Russians did not know precisely to what extent Zhirinovskiy, the 
former GRU [Soviet Military Intelligence] agent, had divulged 
about the Elipton, and they assumed that Western journalists 
were at least aware of the exact nature of that weapons system 
and the name of the person coordinating the program, which, as 
it later turned out, was not the case at all. During this news 
conference they claimed that in fact the Elipton does not exist 
at all: "Earthquakes cannot be triggered except in the places 
where nature has already prepared them," said the official 
statement, which, as a matter of fact, was quite precise. The 
statement actually confirmed previous information about the 
existence of the Elipton-type weapon systems and about their 
nature, and it also offered an exact description of the way in 
which they work. The Hammer [as published] triggers earthquakes 
wherever there is accumulated tension in the ground, which can 
be unleashed by a minimal variation of the gravitational 
acceleration. Thus, they can trigger earthquakes -- the 
magnitude of which, it is true, is very difficult to predict -- 
in areas in which over the past 1,000 years there has not been 
any seismic activity at all. 
  The Romanian state is directly vulnerable to weapons such as 
the Hammer or the Hole [as published] that are part of the 
Elipton program. Important industrial centers of our country 
and vital establishments of our defense industry are situated in 
valley areas such as Tara Barsei [central Romania, where the 
Carpathian Mountains turn], in which the triggering of 
catastrophic tornadoes could cause enormous damage to our 
industrial infrastructure. Moreover, owing to the existence of 
the seismic area in Vrancea [northeastern Romania], the possible 
use of Hammer-type weapons there would cause a catastrophe in 
Bucharest, considering the current precarious state of the 
buildings in our capital city. 
  Such weapons might be used in the near future if a 
geopolitical conflict breaks out as a consequence of the 
unification of the Republic of Moldova with Romania or of our 
country's active integration within NATO. No methods are known 
to counter such weapons. However, one could count on warning 
signs offered by attempts to use them, which fail owing to 
insufficient precision.

  [Excerpt] An overall agreement was signed today in Moscow 
by the all-Russia trade union associations, the employers, and 
the government. The document spells out general principles for 
conducting an agreed socio-economic policy in Russia. The 
government, employers, and trade unions sign such agreements 
every year. But this time, our correspondent Andrey Zenkov 
thinks, it contains something unusual. 
  [Begin Zenkov recording] Although a trilateral agreement is 
signed every year, its fate this year gave rise to particular 
concern. And if today, before my very eyes, the agreement had 
not been signed by the labor and agriculture ministers, the 
first deputy economics and finance ministers, two deputy finance 
ministers and a whole collection of other senior officials, I 
would not have had too much faith in the reality of the 
documents myself. 
  Judge for yourselves. Paragraph two of part one envisages an 
agreed settlement and state control of energy prices and fares. 
And paragraph 22 of part three talks about clearing all the 
wage arrears for workers in state-financed sectors in the second 
quarter of this year. Fresh state subsidies worth billions can 
be seen with the naked eye, yet no trace can be detected of any 
compromise moves by the trade unions, for example. Let's say, a 
temporary renunciation of strike action. Anyway, the immediate 
future will give analysts the opportunity to assess the document 
in detail. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Leonid Berres report: "News Briefing at Russian FCS. Main </F>
Threat to Russia Is Inside its Borders"] 
  [Text] A three-day scientific-practical conference 
"Security of the Individual, Society, State, and Russia's 
Special Services" ended yesterday. Its outcome was summed up at 
a news briefing at the central club of the Russian Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS]. Taking part in it were 
Vladimir Rubanov, deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council; 
Vladimir Volokh, deputy head of the Federal Emigration Service 
of Russia; Yuriy Stsepinskiy, deputy head of the FCS analytical 
directorate; and Petr Dmitriyev, scientific director of Moscow 
State University. The news briefing was hosted by Aleksandr 
Mikhaylov, head of the FCS Public Relations Center (PRC). 
  In the course of the conference, its more than 800 
participants heard 98 reports and addresses. The main attention 
was paid to a new conception of Russia's security system and a 
doctrine enabling it. As Yuriy Stsepinskiy stated, "the main 
threat to Russia is inside its borders." Asked by journalists 
if fragmenting the Russian Ministry of Security may weaken the 
country's security, Vladimir Rubanov replied that the 
effectiveness of measures taken had been proven by world 
practice. In the opinion of Aleksandr Mikhaylov, however, the 
operation of new subdivisions, in connection with the 
reorganization, should be efficiently coordinated. 
  Vladimir Volokh dwelled upon the problems of forced 
emigration. According to Federal Emigration Service [FES] 
information, about 2 million forced emigrants from CIS republics 
and another 500,000 from developing countries have entered 
Russia in the past three years. In his opinion, it had been long 
necessary to pass a law on emigration, otherwise Russia's FES 
would "choke." 
  According to Petr Dmitriyev, actions by FCS operatives have 
virtually no legal basis. Therefore, he thought, their 
activities should be regulated by a law "On Special Services" 
whose draft is in the works. 
  Aleksandr Mikhaylov, in his turn, briefed journalists on the 
results of a snap poll of the conference participants. It was 
found during the poll that 66 percent of the respondents are 
satisfied with the activity of the counterintelligence service, 
and 18 percent are not. At the same time, 74 percent of the 
polled think that the fight against corruption and smuggling is 
not being waged at the appropriate level. 
  The PRC head also gave your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent 
some details about the incident involving North Korean diplomats 
held last week by FCS officers as they tried to smuggle from 
Russia two rockets (Mr. Mikhaylov did not specify what sort of 
rockets). In his words, Russia and the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea are not interested in further publicizing this 
affair because it concerns more than relations between two 
countries. This also finds confirmation in the categorical 
refusal of DPRK Embassy personnel to give any comments in this 
regard.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A sensational statement made 
today at No. 4 [street name indistinct] may become the main 
theme of newspaper headlines and TV programs for several weeks. 
Sergey Stepashin, head of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service [FSK], came to St. Petersburg today to hold a regional 
meeting with counterintelligence directorate heads and a closed 
meeting with directors from the military-industrial complex. 
However in an interview for our program he made a fairly clear 
statement on incidents of corruption in the Russian Government. 
  [Begin Stepashin recording] Only yesterday, or rather the 
day 
before yesterday to be precise, I sent a written report to Boris 
Nikolayevich Yeltsin about a very high-ranking official of 
ministerial rank, who is now being investigated. Yes, such work 
is going on. But I want to stress once again that corruption 
and episodes of corruption are fairly sensitive and so there can 
be no haste here. [end recording] 
  Sergey Stepashin, naturally, could not name the minister 
accused of corruption. However, the fact that the president was 
informed immediately shows that we are talking about someone in 
the top ranks of politics. But the meeting with the 
military-industrial complex bosses was not only concerned with 
corruption. Inter alia, we received information that there is a 
sharp increase in recruitment work by foreign intelligence 
services and even a stepping up of activities by the special 
services of our southern neighbors in the CIS. Representations 
have been made to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan about attempts to 
recruit our citizens. Five personnel from the Georgian security 
department were detained by our counterintelligence and handed 
over to the authorities in Tbilisi. So, at the moment, it is 
still too early to talk about a free and open society without 
strong special services.

  [Text] The Russian Prosecutor General's Office has started 
criminal proceedings against Former Security Minister Viktor 
Barannikov and Former First Deputy Interior Minister Andrey 
Dunayev, suspected of taking bribes and abusing their authority, 
and against their wives, suspected of contraband. The 
proceedings were started on April 5 by Deputy Prosecutor General 
Vladimir Kravtsev after he saw records which the Moscow City 
Prosecutor's Office earlier dismissed as giving no grounds for 
criminal action.

<F P=106> [Olga Garbuzova report: "Law on Civil Service. Bureaucrats </F>
To Be Banned From Taking Bribes"] 
  [Text] Nightmares that haunted Chekhov's protagonists will 
apparently soon be understandable for current Russian 
bureaucrats. In accordance with the draft Law on the Civil 
Service in the Russian Federation, which has been drawn up by 
the working group of the State Duma committee on judicial and 
legal reform, examinations and assessments of qualifications 
will be regularly conducted in the civil service. 
  The draft law proposes that the obscure titles of the old 
Russian Table of Ranks, such as "collegiate assessor" or 
"titular counselor," be replaced with less spectacular 
"counselor" and "consultant." The draft's authors have also 
rejected the trappings that had formerly added luster to this 
occupation, such as a civil uniform and strict rules of address: 
there will be no Your Honors or simply Your Excellencies. 
  The draft calls for civil servants to be divided into 
politicians and administrators. The politicians, as is the case 
now, will be elected, and the administrators will be appointed 
via competition. 
  According to the new table of ranks, each administrative 
official will know his place. For them, a number of grades have 
been established: top, chief, leading, senior, and junior 
officials. In order to begin a climb up the career ladder and 
to become a junior official, one needs to have at least 
secondary professional education. It is expected that all top 
and chief officials in Russia must have a degree. All civil 
servants will have special titles conferred on them. For 
starters, a civil service consultant; then a civil service 
counselor; simply a counselor; and a state counselor. A career 
can be crowned with the title of full state counselor first 
class. All titles will have the same number of classes -- from 
one to three. The transfer from one rung to another will entail 
an increase in one's salary by at least 70 percent. 
  For the sake of all that a civil servant will have to 
sacrifice a whole range of rights enjoyed by other citizens. 
Bureaucrats may not engage in entrepreneurial activity. No 
presents, no bribes (referred to in the draft as "financial 
rewards") or other "bones thrown to them" -- even upon 
retirement. Civil servants will be banned from calling strikes 
and accepting foreign orders without the president's permission. 
In order for a civil servant better to realize his 
responsibility, he will swear an oath when entering the civil 
service.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Golyayev report: "`Sokol' in Flight"] </F>
  [Text] The Interdepartmental Comission for Promoting the 
Organization of Industrial Companies and Financial-Industrial 
Groups has approved the project for the "Sokol" 
Financial-Industrial Group, which has been submitted to it, and 
adopted a decision to register it and issue its certificate of 
registration. The project was elaborated on the intiative of 
specialists and leaders from a number of major industrial and 
financial enterprises of the Central Chernozem Zone and other 
economic regions of Russia, and was backed by the 
administrations of Voronezh, Kursk, and Sverdlovsk Oblasts. 
  Projections suggest that, already in its first stage, 
"Sokol" 
will be able to secure a growth in the volume of manufactured 
output from 326 billion rubles [R] last year to R1.27 trillion 
in 1996. The recoupment period of the investment projects will 
be from two to five years. 
  "The creation of the `Sokol' Financial-Industrial Group 
meets 
the fundamental interests of federal industrial policy. This 
policy aims at developing the science and production complex, 
ensuring the competitiveness of Russian-made products, and 
raising economic potential," Igor Shurchkov, chairman of the 
State Committee for Industrial Policy, said. "We wish to use 
the experience of `Sokol' and of the `Uralskiye Zavody' 
Financial-Industrial Group which was set up earlier to prove the 
efficiency and promise of such groups."

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Correspondent P. Korovyakovskiy] Lots of secret 
things have become known in recent years. We now know about 
underground towns, about the bugs in the American Embassy, and 
even about the anti-aircraft system. Probably there is only one 
thing that we do not know much about: What is happening deep 
within the president's administration and how his, frankly 
speaking, large apparatus works and what it is doing. 
  Meanwhile, sociologists believe that it is precisely because 
there is such an information vacuum that the authorities are 
often unable to explain the logic of economic and political 
reforms to the population, and the laws, programs, and 
directives that are prepared. 
  [Begin recording] [P. Filippov, head of the Directorate for 
Information Services, in progress] ...come as a surprise to 
society. There is no stage of previous discussion of them in 
the press or on radio and TV. [end recording] 
  [Korovyakovskiy] The Directorate for Information Services, a 
new structure under the president headed by Petr Filippov, from 
now on intends to regularly inform the press precisely on 
everyday administrative matters. The journalists that were 
invited to today's news conference in the former CPSU building 
were promised access to all the sub-departments of the service 
and to all officials. Petr Filippov promised that those 
officials of the presidential staff that refuse to give an 
interview will be made to do it, but not by using methods 
favored by the former owners of these halls.

<F P=106> [Eduard Gonzalez report: "Another Trial Behind Us. </F>
Izvestiya Publishing House Case Against Russian Government Over"] 
  [Text] It will soon be a year that representatives of the 
Izvestiya Publishing House have been paying occasional visits to 
the Russian Federation Supreme Court of Arbitration. Its 
ruling, as we have already reported, is now legally valid -- 
regarding the lawfulness of the founding of the "IZVESTIYA 
Editorial Office" Joint-Stock Company. However the publishing 
house filed new charges -- this time against the Russian 
Government. Why, they say, did it give the order for the 
joint-stock company to be privatized? 
  Although this question has been discussed on two occasions 
as 
part of the case and two legal bodies have adopted a ruling, a 
court comprising A. Kozlova, T. Yegorova, and I. Podyachev was 
forced to consider it separately. There is nothing you can do 
about it -- that is the plaintiff's procedural right. 
  The interests of the Russian Government were represented by 
P. Mostova, first deputy chairman of the Russian State Committee 
for the Management of State Property, and lawyer B. Maksimov. 
The editorial office's interests were defended by A. 
Rakhmilovich, member of the Moscow City Collegium of Attorneys. 
  The court produced its ruling -- that the proceedings be 
dismissed. The reasons have not yet been given and we do not 
know what they will reveal. But we can guess what the judges 
will quite understandably not say. Namely, only in our 
upside-down back-to-front world can someone who uses state 
property file charges against the owner -- the country's 
government. And the owner has to justify himself instead of 
asking: How do you use state property? 
  Were the owner to ask that question a host of trials would 
sweep across Russia. And not of course in courts of 
arbitration. However, these subjective impressions have nothing 
to do with the trial and its ruling.

But the court is one thing -- and the job is another. V.

relieved Viktor Linnik, who was reinstated in his post by the 
court, of his duties as PRAVDA chief editor. Aleksandr Ilin was

  So Viktor Linnik is giving the orders, while the vast 
majority of PRAVDA workers are producing the newspaper.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 7 TASS -- Russian privatisation chief 
Anatoliy Chubays said that 70 per cent of trading, public 
catering and every-day service facilities have been already 
privatised in Russia. Chubays believes that by the end of the 
year this figure will reach 85-90 per cent. Also 80 per cent of 
20,000 large industrial enterprises subject to privatisation 
have changed hands, he said. 
  Speaking at a closed-door session of the Russian Government 
Presidium on Thursday, the vice-premier said that the 
privatisation voucher has already paid off. As of April 1, 1994 
105 million privatisation vouchers had been collected. That 
leaves about 45 million vouchers to be still collected. A total 
of 650 voucher investment funds have been set up in the country. 
The major result of privatisation is that joint stock companies 
and privatised enterprises remain open to foreign and domestic 
investors, Chubays said. 
  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin noted that the Russian 
Government will not backtrack on the course of reforms, adding, 
however, that "we must be sure that we are going the right way. 
Particularly, we must make sure that privatisation does not turn 
out to be a sham."

<F P=106> [Vyacheslav Bantin (ITAR-TASS) report in the "Forecast" </F>
column: "Boris Fedorov: The Cabinet Has a Chance To Complete 
Financial Stabilization. The ex-Minister Is Ready To Rejoin the 
Government"] 
  [Text] Former finance minister Boris Fedorov in an 
interview with ITAR-TASS stated that thanks to a fall in the 
rate of inflation down to 9.8 percent in February and 8 percent 
in March, the government now has a unique chance to complete 
successfully the many-month efforts toward financial 
stabilization. "The cabinet of ministers has the possibility to 
use the emerging results of the policy conducted by the previous 
government," the State Duma deputy noted. "It is worrying, 
however, that in the last three and a half months the Viktor 
Chernomyrdin government has not undertaken a single step that 
could be described as reformist." 
  If the current government continues such a stance, in the 
next few weeks a retreat from the economic gains achieved will 
become inevitable, Boris Fedorov believes. According to him, 
the first sign of this will be the extension of large financial 
subsidies to state enterprises, in particular the upcoming 
appropriation in April of approximately 3 trillion rubles to 
enterprises in the agricultural sector. Such a move, the former 
Russian Federation finance minister pointed out, will thwart the 
existing possibility to carry though in Russia "the most 
painless financial stabilization in world history." 
  Confirming his prediction that by the end of the year the 
rate of the dollar could rise to 10,000 rubles, Boris Fedorov 
expressed the opinion that Viktor Chernomyrdin's government will 
be able to "last" only until this fall unless it moves from 
passive policy to an active course for reform. "If by that time 
the cabinet of ministers does not undertake real actions, the 
government will at best be reformed," the former Russian finance 
minister said. He expressed readiness to rejoin the government 
"if the requisite powers are granted" to him.

  [Text] Russia has not concluded a single contract to 
purchase grain from abroad since the beginning of this year, 
Russian Vice Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha told a 
conference of representatives of 55 regions who had come to a 
wholesale fair in Sochi, Krasnodar territory. Zaveryukha said 
Russia's current stocks of soft grain will last until the new 
harvest, those of fodder for 1.5 years and those of rice and 
other cereals for two years. 
  In 1993, Russia concluded contracts on the purchase of 16 Mn 
tons of grain, while its imports totalled only 11 Mn tons the 
same year. In 1992, Russia's grain purchases amounted to 26 Mn 
tons. 
  At the same time, Zaveryukha called for stricter control 
over 
the use of stocks of grain and other food staples. In his 
opinion, this is a task for a nation-wide network developed by 
the World Bank, Russian Agriculture and Food Ministry and the 
Finance Ministry which would store information about the current 
state of the stocks, prices of the products and other data.

  [Text] The State Taxation Office of Russia, the Central 
Bank of Russia and the Finance Ministry have issued a ruling 
making it possible to tax and fine the hard currency accounts of 
factories and organizations if their ruble accounts have been 
exhausted. 
  Deputy head of the Taxation Office Nikolay Ivanov told the 
Financial Information Agency that as the payment crisis was 
raging in the country, numerous factories, organizations and 
commercial banks failed to pay taxes or tried to delay the 
payments by keeping their cash in hard currency accounts. 
  This step will enable the Taxation Office to collect 
significant amounts. As of April 1 various organizations owed 
the budget about 5.5 trillion rubles. 
  Ivanov emphasized that the ruling provided for very strict 
penalties for bank officers who failed to carry out the 
procedure. 
  He also said that the Finance Ministry, the Taxation Office 
and the CBR have submitted to the government proposals on 
tighter controls over bank and factory managers as far as rules 
of storing, using and transferring cash were concerned.

  [Text] By its ordinance No. 273 of March 31 the Russian 
government introduced an excise tax on gasoline. The excise 
will be equal to 10 percent of the wholesale price. 
  An informed government expert told the Oil Information 
Agency 
that this step will result in an increase of retail prices of 
gasoline because "any taxation deals a blow to the consumer." 
For this reason numerous experts expect the wholesale prices to 
increase by 15 to 20 percent. 
  Officials of the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry told the 
Oil Information Agency that "an essentially new tax on oil 
refining may affect both the refineries and the consumers." 
  The experts believe that the mechanism of collecting the tax 
would probably be explained in a letter to be sent by the 
Finance Ministry. They said that the decision to impose the 
excise was dictated by a dramatic drop of demand for oil 
products in Russia that was attributable to the payment crisis. 
  First Deputy Finance Minister Andrey Vavilov said that the 
excise tax was one of the steps the government had to take to 
increase the revenue. In an Interfax interview Thursday he 
emphasized that this revenue had been allowed for in drafting 
the 1994 budget. 
  "Direct taxes on manufacturing industries cannot be raised 
any more. Consequently, indirect taxes have to be used. True, 
they will hit the consumer, but they will encourage production." 
  Vavilov said that the excise would result in price rises. He 
also said that the government had submitted to the State Duma a 
package of steps designed to increase the budget revenue without 
increasing taxation. Numerous ordinances had been adopted and 
another set of proposals were under preparation.

<F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report: "Security Council Opposes Prime </F>
Minister's Decision. Viktor Chernomyrdin Cherishes Radioactive 
Memories of the USSR"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the Security Council's Interdepartmental 
Commission on the Environment presented a memo to the council's 
secretary, Oleg Lobov, on the need to revise agreements 
reaffirmed during Viktor Chernomyrdin during his recent visit to 
Hungary. The issue is the possibility of burying radioactive 
wastes of the Hungarian "Paks" nuclear power station in Russia. 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned that the prime minister discussed 
the impending scandal with Boris Yeltsin, too, during their 
meeting in Zavidovo on the evening of 6 April. 
  On 30 March, Viktor Chernomyrdin issued a directive tasking 
the Atomic Energy Ministry, upon agreement with the Foreign 
Ministry and the State Nuclear Supervision Committee, with 
signing a document with the Hungarians whereby Russia would 
"accept for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel of the "Paks" 
nuclear electric power station, with vitrified (that is, 
encapsulated in glass cubes) radioactive wastes of the 
reprocessing to be buried on Russian territory." It has turned 
out, however, that this is only the tip of an iceberg detected 
by environmentalists. In fact, the agreement to accept 
Hungarian radioactive wastes has been prompted not only by the 
desire to earn money. 
  Under the prime minister's directive, the Atomic Energy 
Ministry was to sign a protocol as part of a bilateral treaty 
between the Soviet Union and Hungary, which was concluded back 
in 1966. At the time, when building nuclear power stations 
abroad, Moscow usually undertook to reprocess and to store 
radioactive wastes on its territory. Having declared itself the 
legal successor to the USSR, Russia has effectively taken over 
the obligation. 
  The problem is that on 21 April 1993 Boris Yeltsin signed an 
edict obliging the government to make provisions for the return 
of nuclear wastes reprocessed (vitrified) by Russia to their 
respective owners when negotiating intergovernment agreements on 
the construction and operation of nuclear power stations abroad. 
Moreover, the Law on the Protection of the Environment prohibits 
"radioactive wastes from other states" from being brought into 
Russia "for the purposes of storing or burying." Under the 
documents, Russia has effectively no objections against the 
reprocessing of the wastes, but it refuses to keep them on its 
territory for further storage. The prime minister could hardly 
be unaware of the documents. During the visit, however, he 
preferred to bear in mind only the old treaty that suits Hungary 
alone. This may cost him plenty. According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
information, today the State Duma is also planning to discuss 
the matter of burying Hungarian wastes. 
  The Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission has 
demanded that agreements between Russia and Hungary be brought 
in line with the presidential edict and Russian law. The 
environmentalists' resolve has been boosted by the fact that 
representatives of the Foreign Ministry, the State Nuclear 
Supervision Committee, and the Environmental Protection Ministry 
have voiced disagreement with the draft protocol in response to 
the commission's unofficial requests. They have made no official 
denials, however, that they themselves have been involved in 
drafting the document. Meanwhile, radioactive waste storages in 
Chelyabinsk Oblast at the "Mayak" Production Association, which 
vitrifies nuclear wastes, have long been overfilled. The 
regional authorities' official stance on the "parcel" from 
Hungary is yet unknown -- they also prefer to keep silent.

  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- The agreement to bury nuclear 
waste on the territory of Russia, signed by Premier Chernomyrdin 
in Hungary, is in line with the commitments which Russia, as the 
Soviet Union's successor, has to fulfill, Vyacheslav Kostikov, 
presidential press secretary, told a Kremlin briefing today at 
the request of the Russian president and prime minister. He 
said that the agreement, signed in Hungary, envisaged the 
processing and utilisation of nuclear wastes from atomic power 
plants built to Soviet blueprints in the Hungarian Republic. 
"Russia will avoid concluding such agreements as soon as the 
terms of the existing international contracts expire," Kostikov 
noted.

  [Text] The nuclear warheads of the torpedoes in the 
nuclear-powered submarine Komsomolets that sank exactly five 
years ago in the Norwegian Sea remain intact. Officials in the 
Northern Fleet's press center told Interfax Thursday that 
radiometric and spectrometric sampling of the sea water and 
bottom suggested that there was no plutonium-239 in the spot 
where the submarine had sunk. The cesium-137 content there was 
one ten thousandth of the admissible value for drinking water. 
The gamma radiation at the sea surface ranged from 1.5 to 5 
microRoentgen per hour. 
  The officials also said that the Semyon Dezhnyov research 
ship was taking samples in the area. According to the April 7 
data, the radiation there stayed within background values. 
  The press center head Vladimir Pyzh emphasized that the 
Northern Fleet had never intended to make the state of affairs 
secret and wanted the radiation situation in that area and 
elsewhere where nuclear ships of other countries had sunk to be 
reported impartially. 
  He said that two Soviet and two US submarines had sunk in 
that area. Pyzh added that the Northern Fleet command wanted 
reports and forecasts on what was going on or would happen where 
Komsomolets had sunk to be based on specific tests and accurate 
data.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Komsomolets tragedy 
slightly lifted the veil of secrecy shrouding the loss of 
submarines in the former Union. So, at present, five nuclear 
submarines and 43 nuclear warheads are resting on the bed of the 
world ocean. No doubt, many submariners today remember 
colleagues who failed to return. This day should rightly become 
a national day of commemoration for all sailors who have 
perished.

chemical and biological weapons under the Russian president 
agreed to the transportation and storage of poisonous substances 
in a major populated area. That is why its chief Anatoliy 
Kuntsevich was dismissed by presidential decree." This was the 
explanation of the wording of Kuntsevich's dismissal "for a 
single gross violation of duties" given by the head of state's 
press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov at a briefing in the Kremlin 
today. 
  Moreover, Vyacheslav Kostikov noted that Anatoliy Kuntsevich 
had spent many years working on the creation of chemical weapons 
and "it is difficult for a person to part from his child even if 
the child is dangerous." For this reason, the president's press 
secretary said, the person dealing with the destruction of the 
chemical arsenal should not be one who was involved in its 
creation.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has said that 
only about 180,000 people can realistically be conscripted into 
the armed forces in spring 1994. Speaking at the Defense 
Collegium in Moscow, he said that for the country's defense 
capability to be maintained, a minimum of 700,000 new recruits 
should be inducted into the army and navy. Grachev said the 
clause in the law on defense that says the number of people in 
the armed forces is restricted to one percent of the population 
of Russia should be changed. A million and a half is not an 
army but a military formation capable of undertaking local 
combat activity, the minister believes.

  [Text] Russia plans to complete its program for the 
privatization of military enterprises by the end of 1994, said 
the State Committee for the Defense Industry. 
  According to a report prepared by the committee for 
parliamentary debates, more than 700 enterprises have already 
been privatized of a total of 1,500 subject to 
denationalization. "The pace of privatization in the defense 
industry is constantly increasing," the report says. While 
before 1993 it was decided to privatize 131 enterprises, by the 
beginning of this year the number trebled. Today another 640 are 
undergoing privatization, the report says. 
  It says privatization has been particularly intensive in the 
electronics, aircraft and ship-building industries. The report 
also says the State Committee for the Defense Industry is making 
serious efforts to attract capital to military enterprises. 
Thus, investment projects involving more than 170 enterprises 
are due to be carried out this year, the report says.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Kukanov under the "Regional Elections" </F>
rubric: "Half an Assembly Is Still Not an Organ"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- Forty-eight hours before the 
second round of voting was held 3 April, the city court rejected 
an action brought by St. Petersburg Prosecutor's Office 
appealing against the mayor's decision to extend the 20 March 
election of a new organ of representative power by 24 hours. 
But this does not at all mean that the elections to the city 
assembly are being regarded as valid, because the Prosecutor's 
Office intends to appeal to the Russian Federation Supreme Court 
against the ruling. 
  Without waiting for the preliminary results of the 3 April 
voting, one thing can be said with certainty: The candidates 
elected to the city assembly do not include a single 
representative of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, 
the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, or the "Homeland" or 
"Great Russia" electoral blocs, which gathered under their 
banners orthodox Bolsheviks, Anpilov's communist workers, and 
nationalist-oriented organizations. Back on 20 March the 
politically-aware citizens of the city on the Neva confounded 
sociologists, who had predicted that the main struggle would be 
between Communist, Liberal Democrat, and "Democratic Unity of 
Petersburg" bloc candidates. The last-named got the largest 
number of candidates for deputies' seats -- 18 -- through to the 
second round. 
  Most likely only one-half of the city assembly's 50 seats 
will be occupied as a result of the repeat voting. But half an 
assembly is still not an organ of representative power because, 
according to current legislation, it can be legally constituted 
only if two-thirds, in other words 34, deputies are present. It 
is proposed to elect the missing deputies in fall.

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Vedernikov under the "Regional Elections" </F>
rubric: "Directors Become Legislators"] 
  [Text] Certain central publications have reported that the 
elections in Orenburg Oblast were not valid, but they made a 
mistake in evidently taking on trust the protest of Presidential 
Representative V. Shapovalenko, who stated that the voting 
results in eight districts could not be declared valid. The 
oblast electoral commission did not consider his arguments to be 
convincing and "confirmed" 36 members of the legislative 
assembly out of the 47 needed. (In 11 districts the elections 
were not valid because voters did not turn out.) There is a 
quorum of deputies, and on 12 April the first sitting of the 
oblast legislative assembly will take place, at which the 
standing orders for work will be considered and organizational 
questions will be decided. At the same time the oblast 
electoral commission sent the Russian president a letter giving 
an adverse assessment of his representative's actions, 
considering them to be discrediting the president himself. Who 
exactly will assemble in the hall on Cosmonauts' Day? People 
who have real power in their hands. The slogan of purely 
"party" candidates, who suggested to voters the notion that 
leaders of enterprises have no business being in the legislative 
assembly, did not work. A total of 19 people will represent the 
directors' corps in the assembly. Neither did the call of the 
head of the oblast administration to his colleagues at city and 
rayon level not to run for deputy work. Virtually to a man they 
launched themselves into the election campaign, as a result of 
which 11 of them achieved their objective. The remaining seats 
went to representatives of a new wave -- businessmen. They 
include, for example, V. Shcherbakov, director of "Yuzhnyy 
Ural," the oblast's biggest commercial bank. There will be 
representatives of the press in the deputies' corps -- two 
journalists were elected. 
  Neither did the party principle work. Not a single "Russia's 
Choice" or "Democratic Russia" candidate got through. 
Communists and agrarians, who united in the bloc "Against 
Poverty, Unemployment, and Corruption," had to be content with 
two seats. But those elected included many who, although they do 
not formally belong to this bloc, sympathize with it, as they 
say. Those who did not heed the wish of the head of the oblast 
administration and who were elected to the assembly include 
Orenburg Mayor Gennadiy Donkovtsev, who, to give him his due, is 
in high standing with the city's inhabitants. 
  "Paradoxical as it may seem, I am against the presence of 
administration heads in the assembly," he told journalists. 
"The Executive and Legislative Branches must be separated. 
Otherwise, we end up controlling ourselves. Why did I myself 
fight for a seat in the legislative assembly? Because I saw 
that there would be nobody to protect the interests of the city, 
which accounts for one-fourth of the oblast's population...." 
  The city's mayor assured voters that as a deputy he would do 
everything to ensure that the city's economy is not so 
"turbulent." Well, we will wait and see.

<F P=106> [Interview with A.V. Ivanchenko, first deputy chairman of </F>
the Central Electoral Commission, by Valentin Maslennikov; place 
and date not given: "Under the Burden of Political Assessments"] 
  [Text] The latest wave of election battles in the region -- 
the largest recently -- has swept Russia. In all since the new 
Constitution was adopted elections have already taken place in 
67 krays, oblasts, national okrugs, and large cities, which are 
independent components of the Federation. The first results of 
the first regional democratic elections in our history are 
described by A.V. Ivanchenko, first deputy chairman of the 
Central Electoral Commission. 
  [Ivanchenko] The main result is obvious -- in the absolute 
majority of regions fully empowered organs of representative 
power have been formed by democratic means. Only in a few 
oblasts, in particular Bryansk, Magadan, and Samara Oblasts, 
will by-elections have to be held. 
  [Maslennikov] On familiarizing yourself with our 
correspondents' reports from on the spot and with the items in 
other mass media you cannot help concluding that this wave has 
been particularly scandalous and revealed a mass of 
violations.... 
  [Ivanchenko] An utterly wrong opinion. It is a pity that 
the printed and broadcast media are focusing on scandals and 
"snags." Of course, there were violations -- quite a lot of 
them. And it would have been strange if we had completely 
avoided them, after all, it is all being done for the first 
time. There is nothing to be surprised about here. While there 
are only political assessments of the very important 
sociopolitical campaign that the elections represent, this bias 
at the initial stage is even natural. The "blunders" of all 
kinds are obvious and that is why they are making a din about 
them. But in the majority of regions everything proceeded 
normally. We shall become fully aware of the importance of this 
fact when we start to assess the legal aspect of the work that 
has been done. 
  [Maslennikov] In what does it consist? 
  [Ivanchenko] In the fact that we have for the first time 
actually had real elections in the regions. No one dragged 
anyone to these elections by force. No one tried to turn them 
into a political show. The candidate deputies were nominated 
not "from labor collectives," as used to be the case, but from 
electoral associations and directly from voters through the 
collection of signatures. No one impeded the citizens' free 
expression of their will. 
  The elections are not yet completed but one can already 
boldly say today that a major stage has been traveled on the 
path of the establishment of Russian statehood. Representative 
organs have been created locally and by relying on them the 
components of the Federation will be able to build mutual 
relations in the field of the budget and taxes. 
  [Maslennikov] But are you not idealizing the results of the 
elections? After all, in many regions they were only barely 
valid because of voters' low level of activity. 
  [Ivanchenko] Let's be realists. Is it conceivable at the 
first attempt to do everything at once without hitches or 
glitches? And the representative organs we have acquired 
locally are also far from perfect. But they do exist, and that 
is the main thing. The experience we have accumulated will 
enable us to create for the next elections a base which 
guarantees even more precisely the observance of electoral 
rights at all levels, and we will correspondingly get better 
results. 
  As for the voters' passivity.... An unpleasant but 
entirely explicable element. People's tiredness and 
disillusionment and some people's distrust of the organs it was 
planned to form had an effect. But I think that a far greater 
influence was the inability and in some places the reluctance of 
local administrators to hold the elections in an organized 
manner. This can be seen particularly clearly in the example of 
those oblasts where the deputies' corps has been found to 
include mostly the administrators themselves. These 
shortsighted politicians are clipping their own wings. It will 
be no easier for them to work (yet that is precisely what they 
are counting on) but far harder because in the future they will 
have no one on whom to rely. 
  We have examples of some local administration 
representatives 
making inept use of the mass media and achieving results which 
are the opposite to those intended. Nizhniy Novgorod Governor 
V. Nemtsov was so absurd in supporting his nominee for the post 
of mayor of the oblast center that eventually this nominee was 
obliged to withdraw his candidacy and the elections to the post 
of head of the city administration were not held at all. In 
other words, we are learning democracy. And, unfortunately, we 
are learning from our own mistakes. Hence all our "snags." 
  [Maslennikov] But criminal charges are being brought, in 
Ulyanovsk or Orenburg, for instance. Passions are erupting at 
meetings, as was the case in St. Petersburg.... 
  [Ivanchenko] And I see nothing terrible in that. Since a 
competitive struggle is under way there will be losers. But 
many of us do not know how to lose and start to brandish our 
fists after the fight. We should have thought about it before 
and prepared for the elections in good time. For instance, in 
Orenburg, if the local statute on elections had clearly 
prescribed the procedure for counting votes there would have 
been no conflict with the losing candidates from the "Democratic 
Russia" electoral association. 
  [Maslennikov] So will we continue to learn from bumps and 
bruises? 
  [Ivanchenko] Not only that way. The Central Electoral 
Commission in conjunction with several State Duma committees, 
the Federation Council, the Ministry of Justice, and the 
Ministry Nationalities Affairs and Regional Policy, have 
prepared a draft law on the fundamental guarantees of Russian 
Federation citizens' electoral rights. The negative elements 
which appeared during the elections may have been possible 
because we did not have this law. This legal act will make it 
possible not only to guarantee the rights of citizens at 
elections of all levels but will also make it possible to unify 
voting technology and set up the compilation of electoral lists 
and will provide for the procedure for appealing against illegal 
actions by all participants in elections both to higher-level 
electoral commissions and in court. The new law will give 
freedom to express their will to citizens and parties, for after 
all we still cannot speak seriously of a real multiparty system 
at regional level. 
  [Maslennikov] Where else are elections to be held in the 
immediate future? 
  [Ivanchenko] In April it is planned to hold elections in 
Sverdlovsk Oblast, Chukotsk Autonomous Okrug, and Karelia. let 
us hope that here some lessons of previous rounds will be 
considered and a number of errors will not be repeated. As for 
the definitive assessments, let us not be in a hurry and be too 
categorical. Who will venture now to judge whether good or bad 
representative organs have been elected locally? Life itself 
will show how the reforms will proceed further, what results 
they will bring, and how mutual relations between the federal 
center and the regions will take shape. If these relations are 
not formed then we shall get an opposition force even from 
ideally selected representative organs. And I should like 
primarily to warn against haste in making political assessments 
and to remind you that the transition to democracy is an 
evolutionary rather than a revolutionary process and it cannot 
take place in an instant.

<F P=106> [Report by Irina Kiryanova: "Kuban Will Warm, Feed, </F>
and...Expel. Hunt on for Foreigners in Southern Russia. From 
Near Abroad"] 
  [Text] For several years now Kuban society has been in a 
state close to panic owing to the intensive immigration into the 
kray of refugees from all corners of the former Union. At 
present, the actual number of migrants in the region is put by 
experts at 600,000. It is not surprising that real estate 
prices here are growing faster than anywhere in Russia, and that 
public health conditions have sharply deteriorated. Competition 
for jobs has become tougher, and there is no need to talk about 
crime -- the Russian minister of internal affairs, who recently 
visited Krasnodar, confirmed what everyone already knew --that 
Krasnodar Kray has a steady lead in this area. 
  Another detail of some importance is that in recent years 
the 
Kuban has virtually become a no-man's land or joint rear area 
(quite safe and therefore particularly convenient and 
attractive) for at least three warring states.... 
  Fear of being buried under the debris of other people's 
disasters is forcing the Kuban authorities to take increasingly 
severe administrative measures. As of April last year the 
registration of citizens from the near abroad has been under way 
in the kray. In the space of 12 months the Kuban has expelled 
around 700 unregistered migrants, and the fines levied on 
miscreants total 76 million rubles [R]. Total fines levied on 
illegal migrants have come to R46 million in the first quarter 
of this year alone.... 
  The Kuban authorities used B. Yeltsin's vacation in Sochi to 
try to persuade the president "on the spot" of the need for 
further steps in this direction. As a result, the presidential 
"go-ahead" was given for the introduction of a visa system in 
the kray, and the Kuban governor immediately signed the relevant 
decree. It came into force the other day. 
  Will this turn into a painful offensive against human rights 
in the kray? Mikhail Savva, chief of the kray administration 
for nationalities affairs and migration issues, replied 
categorically in the negative. The decree does not apply to 
Russian citizens at all, much less to "foreigners from far 
away." The decree is aimed at our homegrown "near abroad." 
Movement of these citizens around Russia has hitherto been 
entirely uncontrolled. Paradoxical situations have emerged: 
For instance, one such foreigner, exploiting his absolute 
freedom, committed a crime on Russian territory and went back 
home -- from where it subsequently proved exceptionally 
difficult to extradite him ("Sorry, we're a sovereign 
country..."). 
  As for human rights, Mikhail Savva said, they are being 
trampled not in the kray, but rather in Moscow, which is 
creating such an amazing normative base that the provinces have 
simply been forced to protect themselves. For instance, just 
what are we to make of an open border with Azerbaijan -- which, 
in its turn, has an open border with Iran and Turkey? This 
means one thing -- we have been turned into a cesspit, a sieve, 
a transit lounge.... 
  The kray administration's administration for nationalities 
affairs and migration issues has drawn up a document entitled 
"Description of the Economic Situation and Likely Scenarios for 
the Development of Events in the Caucasus," setting out a 
concept for the kray's "Caucasian" policy. Among the main tasks 
it mentions are to protect the rights of Russians in the 
Caucasus and to reduce the criminal influence exerted on the 
kray by neighboring republics. 
  As for the rumors in the press that certain emergency 
measures will soon be introduced in Krasnodar Kray -- along the 
lines of Tatarstan -- we can only say that deep in the bowels of 
the administration work is indeed being done on a number of 
"hardline" documents within the framework of the latest attempt 
to launch an anticrime offensive. But these documents have no 
direct bearing on the visa regime.

<F P=106> [Report by Tatyana Borisevich under the "Nonpayments and </F>
Family Budget" rubric: "Not Only Is There No Money To Live On, 
There Is None for Funerals Either"] 
  [Text] All through the last few months, Vorkuta has been 
living in a strike regime. The strike at the "Severnaya" pit 
ends, another one begins at the "Komsomolskaya." "Yur-Shor" 
miners come up to the surface, mine constructors refuse to leave 
the coal face. A hunger strike ends in one place and begins in 
another. The center of tension swings like a pendulum. But it 
can be used like a compass to follow who has been given money 
and who has not. Money is usually given after a strike -- 
especially a hunger strike. 
  Money. This is the leash with which the government keeps 
Vorkuta in check, by relaxing or tightening it. But this is for 
the time being. Only recently the miners were demanding only 
money. Now, they are coming out with political slogans. In 
time everything is possible, even including acts of sabotage. 
Threats have already been made. 
  All pits are state-owned. The debtors are, therefore, well 
known. The Russian Government is not allocating subsidies and 
is not setting aside money for the social sphere. Consumers -- 
Cherepovets, Lipetsk, and Moscow -- are not paying for shipped 
coal. There are also factors which are purely Vorkuta's 
miscalculations: unprofitable barter, high cost price, 
financial defects. Pits have no money -- there will not be any 
in the budget either. Therefore, the picture is very confused. 
Sorting it out is as difficult as working out what people who 
have not received wages since last December are living on. 
  While strikes are "paying off" for the miners, after which 
they are paid either an advance of 100,000-200,000 rubles [R] 
each or else their full wage, the situation in the social sphere 
is much worse. The coal sector has on its balance sheet 
two-thirds of Vorkuta's housing, almost 70 kindergartens, and 
other social facilities. All these economic activities require 
R40 billion per month, which should be financed from the Russian 
budget under a separate heading. Since the beginning of the 
year not a penny has gone to Vorkuta under this heading. Mainly 
women work in the social sphere. All well and good if some of 
them have husbands who are miners. The rest are simply doomed. 
  Women's movement activists have recounted how they went 
around visiting families on a holiday. One family had only 
toast on the table, and when the women started treating the 
children to candy the mother's nerves snapped and she became 
hysterical. 
  Announced and unannounced hunger strikes, unemployment, the 
abolition of benefits for medicines for children and pensioners 
-- all this is Vorkuta today. All it needs is a small push and 
an explosion will be inevitable. 
  A school principal relates: "The last time I received money 
was in January. It was R25,000." "How are you surviving?" "At 
first we ate our reserves, now we are eating only groats and we 
have had to sell some things from our home." 
  Here is the testimony of A. Stepanov, chairman of the 
Council 
of Vorkuta Directors: "Not only is there no money to live on, 
there is none for funerals either. We are all hostages." 
  The natural question arises: "How much high-energy Vorkuta 
coal does Russia need? For what quantity of it will Russia 
guarantee payment? Judging by the draft budget, the sector will 
receive one-half of the funds it is demanding. This means that 
the financial reorganization [sanatsiya] of pits is inevitable. 
For example, the program to close the "Khalmer-Yu" pit in 
Vorkuta has now been costed out. Its production capacity is 
410,000 tonnes a year and it has around 2,000 employees. 
Expenditure on closing the pit and social welfare for its 
workers is in excess of R43 billion. This is only for one, 
which is by no means the biggest pit. 
  Both the development of the Pechora coal basin and its 
mothballing are equally heavy burdens for the budget. But 
enough time has already been spent standing at the crossroads.

<F P=106> ["Statement by the President of the Republic of Latvia </F>
Guntis Ulmanis"] 
  [Text] On April 6 of this year, I received an ITAR-TASS 
report that Russian President Boris Yeltsin has agreed to a 
Russian Ministry of Defence proposal to establish Russian 
military bases on Latvian territory. The report states that the 
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with the Russian 
Ministry of Defence and other ministries, is to begin 
negotiations on this issue and to draft the appropriate 
agreements. 
  The obviously contradicts the agreements initialed by the 
government delegations of both states, and raised doubts about 
the true intentions of the Russian Government delegation in the 
process of drafting the agreements. This statement caused 
justified concern for the planned meeting between the presidents 
of Latvian and Russia and the development of potential political 
dialogue. It does not assure domestic and foreign political 
stability, and diminishes trust in Russia as a partner state in 
agreements. The building of Russian military bases on Latvian 
territory would be a real threat to Latvian sovereignty and 
security and would destabilize not only the Baltic region, but 
also Western Europe. 
  Over the last few hours, I have repeatedly attempted to 
contact the commander-in-chief of the Russian North-West 
Military Group General Mayorov and President Yeltsin's 
administration in order to obtain an explanation. As yet, I 
have not received an answer, which points to deliberate evasion 
from providing an explanation. 
  Latvia will never allow the building of a Russian military 
base on its territory. 
  [Signed] Guntis Ulmanis, president of the Republic of 
Latvia.

<F P=106> ["Unofficial translation" of statement issued by the Latvian </F>
Cabinet of Ministers in Jurmala on 6 April] 
  [Text] On April 6, 1994 of this year, the Government of the 
Republic of Latvia received at its disposal decree No. 174 
signed by Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin on April 5, 
in which the Russian Federation President has consented to the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Defence proposal, approved by the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs, concerning the 
establishment of military bases in the territories of the CIS 
and the Republic of Latvia, in order to ensure the security of 
the Russian Federation and the previously mentioned nations, as 
well as to test new armaments and military equipment. The 
Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with 
the Ministry of Defence and other interested Russian Federation 
ministries and departments, has been charged with negotiating 
with the CIS and the Republic of Latvia, and to conclude the 
reached agreements by means of the appropriate documentation. 
  In this connection, the Government of the Republic of Latvia 
states that the substance of the decree by the Russian 
Federation president is in stark contrast with the draft 
agreement on Russian troop withdrawal from the Republic of 
Latvia prepared by the delegations of the Republic of Latvia and 
the Russian Federation, and initialed in Moscow on March 15, 
1994. It can be regarded as an unwillingness by the Russian 
Federation to sign these jointly prepared and initialed draft 
agreements, and subordinate covenants. 
  The Government of the Republic of Latvia categorically 
states 
that it has not agreed to, does not agree to, and will never 
agree to the establishment of Russian Federation military bases, 
or to the testing of new armaments and military equipment in the 
territory of the Republic of Latvia, and rejects the possibility 
of any discussion on these issues. The Russian Federation does 
not have the right to wailfully undertake to guarantee the 
security of the Republic of Latvia. 
  The decree by the Russian president fundamentally changes 
the 
international political and military situation in Eastern 
Europe. The Government of Latvia regards this decree as open 
submission to pressures from Russia's reactionary imperialistic 
circles. 
  That Russia wants to establish its military bases in Latvia 
proves that the goals of specifically these forces were not met 
in the March 15 initialed agreements. They are now attempting 
to make these agreements inconceivable. 
  The fact that these intentions have gained support in the 
Russian Federation president's decree, is a heavy blow to the 
international community's and the Republic of Latvia's ability 
to trust in the course of Russia's foreign policy and the 
foreign policy's compliance to internationally accepted norms. 
  The Government of Latvia is evaluating its further policy in 
relation to Russia and will take commensurate countermeasures to 
any attempts to threaten Latvia's sovereignty. 
  The Government of the Republic of Latvia requests 
explanations from the Russian Federation regarding this decree 
and reserves the right to inform the governments of countries 
around the world and international institutions about the 
changes of Russia's position on the issue of Russia's troop 
withdrawal. 
  The Government of Latvia once again requests that the 
Russian 
Government without delay and unquestioningly withdraw all army 
and military personnel who are located illegally in the 
territory of the Republic of Latvia.

"Russia Does Not Intend To Create Military Bases in Latvia. 
Diplomats Believe Boris Yeltsin Was Given the Wrong Document To 
Sign"] 
  [Text] Aleksandr Rannikh, Russian ambassador to Latvia, 
was summoned to the Baltic state's Foreign Ministry, where he 
was handed a protest concerning military bases on the territory 
of CIS countries and Latvia mentioned in an edict of the Russian 
president. 
  The Latvian Government, after an emergency discussion of the 
Russian document, stated that the Russian president's directive 
is "in sharp conflict with the draft agreements on the 
withdrawal of the army from Latvian territory initialed by the 
two countries' delegations in Moscow 15 March this year." The 
Latvian Cabinet of Ministers suggested that the mention of a 
Russian military base in Latvia, which was not agreed with Riga, 
could be seen as indicating that Russia is reluctant to sign the 
agreed documents. The Latvian Government stated that it "did 
not agree, does not agree, and will never agree to the creation 
of a Russian Federation military base or to the testing of new 
Russian arms and equipment on the territory of the Latvian 
Republic, and rejects the possibility of talks on these 
questions." 
  As is known, the only military facility for which an 
exception was made at the Russian-Latvian talks is the radar 
tracking station in the settlement of Skrunde. Latvia made a 
concession and granted permission for it to remain for several 
years after the withdrawal of the army, until a similar facility 
can be built in Russia. But in the agreement the Skrunde 
station was not referred to as a military base. 
  The Latvian delegation repeatedly came out against that. 
  The Latvian national radicals are doing everything possible 
to retard the signing of the treaty with Russia, including the 
agreement on Skrunde. The mention of a Russian "military base" 
in Latvia in the presidential document prompted a nervous and 
aggrieved reaction in Latvia's top echelon. Riga demanded 
explanations in connection with the Russian president's 
directive.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 07, BNS -- The decision of President 
Boris Yeltsin to set up military bases in Latvia would change 
the political situation, said Indulis Berzins, of the Latvia's 
Way faction. 
  The motion would also and endanger the implementation of 
U.N. 
General Assembly's resolution on the complete and immediate 
withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic states, he said. 
  Certain ruling political forces in Russia dislike the 
anticipated agreement with Latvia because they hope to make an 
advantage of the present situation when there is no formal 
agreement to keep Russian troops in Latvia, Berzins said. 
  Latvia, however, should not sign the initialed agreements on 
troop withdrawal before additional talks between authorized 
state delegations, Berzins added. 
  Berzins claims that the information about "the technical 
mistake" in the text of Yeltsin's resolution "does not and will 
not enhance confidence" unless the Russian president himself 
issues an official statement.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 07, BNS -- President Boris Yeltsin's 
April 5 decision clearly reflects the aggressive intentions of 
Russia's foreign policy to keep Latvia in its sphere of 
influence, the Latvian Saeima (parliament) Homeland and Freedom 
faction said. 
  The reference by Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh to a technical 
mistake is curious from the point of view of international 
relations and only indicates of various understanding of 
political tactics by various Russian leaders, said faction head 
Maris Grinblats. It's not enough to consider that Russia has 
given up its aggressive plans. 
  Grinblats characterized the anticipated signature of the 
agreement on the Skrunda radar functioning and the status of 
military retirees in Latvia as a "political suicide."

  [Text] Riga, Apr 07, BNS -- The decision of President 
Boris Yeltsin to set up military bases in the Commonwealth of 
Independent States countries and Latvia does not evidence of 
fundamentally new policies, Alexander Kirsteins, the head of the 
Latvian parliament Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters 
Thursday [7 April]. 
  Kirsteins said he was surprised by the "theatrical 
performance the Latvian government staged" to protest Yeltsin's 
decision. 
  In Kirsteins' words, Russia has never regarded its radar 
station at Skrunda in Latvia as a military institution but it 
always considered it as a military base. In this context, 
Yeltsin's statement is not surprising. 
  On the other hand, it is characteristic of the Russian 
government to issue inadequate statements to see reaction of 
other countries to them, Kirsteins said. Such statements are 
retracted afterwards, he said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>
  [Text] Riga, 8 Apr -- "Spoken apologies are not enough," 
Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs said in regard to Russia's 
references to an erroneous mention of Latvia in an order by 
Boris Yeltsin on setting up bases on the territory of that 
Baltic state. "In the given situation it will not be possible to 
sign the agreements initialled and additional talks are needed," 
the head of government stressed. "But they can only take place 
after the order in question is recalled at official level." 
  Valdis Birkavs spoke on local television on Thursday 
evening. 
He arrived in the studio after cutting short his attendance at 
a meeting of the governing coalition in the Saeima, and laid out 
the position of the "Latvias Tselsh" faction, which is part of 
the coalition with the Christian Union faction. Birkavs has 
frequently stressed that a treaty on withdrawing troops from 
Latvia is necessary, but "all obscurities should be removed." 
In his words, "if a treaty is not signed, great uncertainty 
will arise given the aggressive aims of Russia expressed in the 
document signed by Mr. Yeltsin." In his opinion, "Russia has 
shown that it does not need a treaty, but for Latvia it is 
necessary." 
  Concern has been caused at the Latvian Foreign Ministry by 
the information that Russia's Foreign Ministry had not taken 
part in the drafting of the document. "If that is the case how 
are the President's orders prepared?" Maris Riekstinsh, Latvian 
Foreign Ministry state secretary asked. "We have not received 
any clarifications and have only the report that a mistake was 
made."

  [Text] RIGA, Apr 07, BNS - Latvian Prime Minster Valdis 
Birkavs downplayed Russia's allegation that the mentioning of 
Latvia among the projected 30 locations for Russian "near 
abroad" military bases was merely "a technical mistake." 
  "Such technical mistakes almost never occur in the world," 
Birkavs told BNS. Consequently, the motion should be a 
deliberate action, he noted. 
  Moreover, the interpretation of the incident does not affect 
the Latvian stance, the premier stressed. 
  "Russia has unveiled plans to establish military bases here. 
Latvia needs additional guarantees from Russia and from other 
countries that the bases will not be set up," Birkavs added. 
  "The issue of deployment of any Russian bases on the 
territory of Latvia is not being raised and does not exist," 
Yeltsin's spokesman, Vecheslav Kostikov, said in a formal 
statement, according to The Associated Press. 
  Birkavs predicted that the incident would show the world 
community how real the threats to the Latvian security are and 
how much the Baltic country needs international security 
guarantees. 
  Simultaneously, Birkavs conceded that no country or 
organization was likely to assume for responsibility for 
Latvia's security in the near future. It is a gradual process in 
which Latvia is trying to integrate by safeguarding its 
security, first of all, itself, the prime minister said. 
  Defense Minister Valdis Birkavs told BNS that Yeltsin's 
resolution was tailored to find out Latvia's views. Russia 
stepped back after it sensed the sharp counter reaction, he 
said. Similar tactics has become traditional for Russia, 
Pavlovskis said. 
  Russia has said several months ago that it, like the United 
States, needs military bases abroad but Latvia was never before 
enclosed in the list of "eligible countries."

<F P=106> [Report by Natalya Vecherskaya, correspondent of the GAZETA </F>
press agency, specially for SEGODNYA, from Riga under the 
"Latvia" rubric: "Saeima May Fail To Ratify Treaty on Army 
Pullout. Opposition Sees Russian Retirees as Republic's 
Potential Enemies"] 
  [Text] The history of the Russian-Latvian treaty on the 
army pullout reminds one of a detective story. Even now that 
the agreement has already been initialed by heads of government 
delegations, a number of questions remain unresolved. One of 
them is whether the treaty will be signed at all. At any rate, 
the radical opposition in the Latvian parliament is not very 
enthusiastic about it and continues to do its utmost to block 
the treaty's ratification. 
  Aleksandr Kirsteins, chief of the Movement for Latvia's 
National Independence parliamentary faction and chairman of the 
parliamentary international affairs committee, explains: "We do 
not oppose the treaty itself. But this is not a single 
document; this is a package of agreements, including the matter 
of the Skrunda radar and the matter of social safety nets for 
retired Russian officers. It is the latter question on which 
our faction disagrees. Russia insists that Latvia should take 
over the social protection of officers who left service before 
22 January 1992. But if we gave in on Skrunda, this does not 
mean at all that now we should accept any terms that Russia is 
trying to impose on us." 
  "The Constitution of the Latvian Republic was reinstated as 
early as 4 May 1990. It is from that day that we have seen 
Russian officers as servicemen of another state. Hence, by 
fulfilling this provision Latvia would directly violate its own 
Constitution. Even if in the period from 4 May 1990 to 22 
January 1992 the army may be considered Soviet, not Russian, 
even then the social safety nets for its officers will be a 
matter of Latvia's bilateral agreements with Russia, Ukraine, 
Belarus, and Kazakhstan, but by no means with Russia alone," he 
claimed. 
  "Moreover, from our point of view, one cannot talk with such 
assurance that all Russian servicemen will automatically remain 
in Latvia. We cannot accept this, either. We cannot confer the 
status of Latvian citizens on officers of a foreign army, that 
is, people who are potentially disloyal to the state. Such 
people number around 50,000 in Latvia, and they are far from 
innocuous lambs. According to our information, these are 
officers who served in special purpose units in Moldova, in the 
Caucasus, in Afghanistan. Why should we need this contingent -- 
from professional assassins to specialists in psychological 
warfare? Let them practice all that in Russia, not in Latvia," 
Mr. Kirsteins said. 
  He also thinks that the reluctance to sign the treaty in its 
present form cannot give Russia a pretext for blackmailing, such 
as: "No treaty, no army pullout." "If Russia is to be a normal, 
democratic state, if it is to cooperate with key European 
countries, it will withdraw its troops even without any 
agreement. If not, no treaty will help." 
  The parliament's majority faction holds a more cautious view 
on the problem. Indulis Berzins from "Latvian Path" said that 
the treaty initialed in Moscow is very much based on compromise: 
"Of course, I do not like some of its provisions. I do not 
think that Russia, either, is pleased with everything." To all 
appearances, "Latvian Path" and its allies will advocate the 
ratification of the treaty. "Let the Saeima decide whether we 
need the treaty or not," Mr. Berzins noted. "But we must 
clearly determine right now who will be responsible if it is not 
signed. Currently it is easy for the opposition to bring 
together rallies and pickets, currently all are heroes. But 
whom will the people hold responsible if the army does not leave 
on 31 August?"

political association was created to participate in the coming 
local governments elections, said Ziedonis Cevers, ex-interior 
minister and president of the Drosiba (Security) foundation. 
  Saimnieks will nominate practical specialists who have

reporters. 
  Cevers himself plans to run for Riga mayor. 
  BNS asked Cevers to name the priorities of Saimnieks' 
economic program but he answered that the association was 
established only recently and its programs are not ready yet. 
  Another leader of the new organization, President of the 
Private Enterprise Association Valdis Krisbergs, told BNS that 
the emphasis should be put on small and medium size business 
development and welfare of people. Krisbergs characterized the 
Latvian capital, Riga, as "the poorest and the most expensive 
city in the world." 
  Other founders of Saimnieks are MPs Eriks Kaza, Ernests 
Jurkans, actor Ivars Kalnins.

  [Text] Albinas Januska, Lithuanian deputy minister of 
foreign affairs, today summoned Nikolay Obertyshev, Russian 
ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary in Lithuania, to 
the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The view of the 
Lithuanian Government on the decree of Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin was explained to the ambassador. He was told that such 
unilateral actions by Russia are unacceptable to Lithuania. 
  The attention of the ambassador was drawn during the meeting 
to the fact that the Russian stand, disseminated by the Russian 
diplomatic missions, attempting to disclaim the annexation of 
the Baltic states in 1940, has no historical or legal 
foundations. Such a stand is contrary to the Lithuanian-Russian 
agreement of 29 July 1991 on the foundations of interstate 
relations, where Russia acknowledged that in 1940 the USSR 
annexed Lithuania. 
  In discussing the return of the Lithuanian Embassy building 
in Paris, Albinas Januska expressed his concern that Russia has 
so far failed to solve this issue.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 07, BNS -- Russia's intentions to 
create military bases in Latvia and countries of the CIS "can 
hurt the fragile agreement between Russia and Latvia on the 
Skrunda radar base," Justas Paleckis, foreign policy adviser to 
the Lithuanian president, said Thursday [7 April]. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree April 5 
suggesting Foreign and Defense ministries to create bases in 
Latvia and the CIS for testing new weapons systems. 
  Paleckis said he hasn't seen the official text of the decree 
yet, but if media reports are precise enough, the Russian 
leader's decision can create tension in Baltic-Russian relations. 
  The presidential adviser said the decree contradicts 
Brazauskas' view that the Baltic coast should be free of arms in 
the future. Paleckis said the idea was mentioned in the 
Lithuanian president's speech at the United Nations last year. 
  Paleckis said military bases in foreign countries is an 
international practice, "but everything depends on historic 
circumstances and agreement between states, while the historic 
circumstances for Russia's military return to the Baltic states 
are unfavorable in this case."

  [Text] The presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have 
urged the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, to state personally 
and publicly that Latvia's inclusion into the countries where 
Russia intends to establish military bases is a mistake, and to 
confirm his previous obligations to withdraw speedily and 
completely the army from Estonia and Latvia. 
  The Baltic presidents also appeal to the international 
community not to stand aside at a time when Russia is hardening 
its policy toward these states. 
  The statement by the Baltic presidents was prepared 
yesterday 
and made public this morning. The three presidents welcome 
reports from Russia that the leaders of that country's 
government acknowledged that a mistake was made in the Boris 
Yeltsin edict of 5 April by including Latvia among the countries 
where Moscow intends to establish military bases. In welcoming 
this news, we notice with concern the consequences of such 
incidents to our countries, our relations with the Russian 
Federation and, on the whole, to the possibilities of all 
countries to work with Moscow's government, the document states. 
  The presidents note that such actions, such as the 5 April 
edict and the Moscow decision on the same day at the 
negotiations with Estonia and Latvia to repudiate matters 
already agreed upon have consequences which reach much further 
than the negotiations between our countries and Russia. 
  Such actions obviously intimidate our nations and, in 
addition, they increase tension in Europe, raising the question 
of the reliability of the Russian Government as a partner in 
negotiations. The Baltic countries have always negotiated with 
the Russian Federation benevolently, and will continue to do so. 
In addition, our governments will do everything in their power 
to reduce the consequences of these ill-fated incidents. But 
our efforts have obvious limits, and therefore we apply to all 
interested countries to help us in our efforts, the statement by 
the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian presidents notes.

  [Text] The dialogue with Russia recently came to a halt and 
all messages sent to Prime Minister Chernomyrdin remain without 
reply, Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius told a news 
conference today, describing relations between Lithuania and 
Russia. 
  He criticized yesterday's statement by Boris Yeltsin on 
Russia's military bases on the territory of other states. 
Russia has started an aggressive economic policy toward the 
Baltic states. The Lithuanian prime minister cited as an 
example a 15 April decision to increase customs duties. Russia 
is introducing strict limitations on the import of some goods. 
Therefore, Adolfas Slezevicius said, we will be compelled to 
discuss and adopt reciprocal measures. 
  Negotiations with Belarus on the delimitation of borders are 
also at a standstill. The Lithuanian prime minister links this 
with the political situation in Belarus. Sea borders with 
Latvia have been agreed in principle, and coordination at 
parliament level between the two countries is now taking place. 
Describing the situation, the prime minister noted that the 
establishment of sea borders both with Russia and with Latvia 
will not be to Lithuania's advantage, but such is the 
geographical situation of our republic. 
  The prime minister announced his forthcoming visit to Kuwait 
this coming weekend. Two agreements are to be signed there -- 
on the protection of investments, and a document on a $50 
million credit. A plan for using these funds already exists. 
Adolfas Slezevicius called the small state of Kuwait one of the 
largest donors in the financial world. If our first experience 
of cooperation is successful, it is possible that we will 
arrange a permanent credit line. 
  Describing documents adopted at a government meting on 
Wednesday, the prime minister noted a decision which regulates 
the mechanism of declaring especially expensive property items. 
A decision was also adopted to double the taxation on wholesale 
imports of alcohol to Lithuania. If in the past a wholesale 
trade license cost 150,000 litas, now it will cost 300,000.

  [Text] Dialog between Lithuania and Russia has been 
virtually suspended, Latvian [as received] Prime Minister 
Adolfas Slezevicius said at a press conference in Vilnius on 
Thursday. 
  In the words of the prime minister, Russia "is conducting an 
aggressive economic policy in relation to the Baltic states." 
The regulation of export and import introduced in the Russian 
Federation on March 15 is "bluntly discriminating", Slezevicius 
said. 
  The Lithuanian premier also said that he had a meeting with 
the head of the Kaliningrad regional administration Yuriy 
Matochkin who in the near future is scheduled to meet with 
Chernomyrdin. Slezevicius asked him to inform the Russian 
premier about Lithuania's position. Its essence is that "if 
Russia has no intention of changing its decision and continues 
the policy aimed at reducing imports, Lithuania will have 
nothing to do but to resort to adequate measures in relation to 
the Kaliningrad region." 
  The Lithuanian premier also noted that Russia is not 
repaying 
its debt for the transit of electricity. "We would not like to 
resort to limiting this transit," Slezevicius said. 
  According to the premier, Lithuanian President Algirdas 
Brazauskas sent a letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
about the problems in relations between the two states.

  [Text] The Lithuanian-Russian dialogue has come to a halt, 
but Lithuania is striving for it -- and above all the contacts 
between the presidents of the two countries -- to be normal. 
This was stated by Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius at a news 
conference today. 
  The prime minister announced that President Algirdas 
Brazauskas yesterday signed a letter to Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin, describing all problems of cooperation. 
Lithuanian-Russian relations have been also discussed at a 
meeting of the foreign policy coordination council chaired by 
the president. 
  Slezevicius also said that his letters and attempts to talk 
to Russian Prime minister Chernomyrdin remain without response. 
As is known, Lithuania is inviting Russia to confirm the note 
on the coming into force of the treaty on the most favorable 
trade regime. The treaty was signed last November in Vilnius, 
but Russia has so far not ratified it. 
  The head of the Lithuanian Government also told the news 
conference that Russia is conducting an aggressive policy toward 
the Baltic states. It was also said at the news conference that 
if Russia does not change its attitude, Lithuania will take the 
same measures as regards the Kaliningrad region.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 07, BNS -- Vytautas Landsbergis, 
leader of the Lithuanian parliament's rightist opposition, 
claimed Russia's plans to create military bases in Latvia are "a 
political aggression resembling Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's (Russian 
ultranationalist) statements." 
  Commenting on the Russian president's recent decree, 
Landsbergis said "Russia's intention to create military bases in 
neighboring countries is a new imperialistic defiance of the 
international community and civilized norms accepted in it," 
Landsbergis said in a statement circulated Thursday [7 April]. 
  The opposition leader expressed regret that the Russian 
president has to assent to demands of the military. "Latvia's 
ascription to a group of states where Russia acts as if at home 
is very dangerous to the international law."

<F P=106> [Guoda Salciute report from the Seimas] </F>
  [Text] Right-wing opposition leader Vytautas Landsbergis, 
speaking at today's news conference, gave a positive assessment 
to the fact that the president has blocked the law on 
agriculture recently passed by the Seimas. According to him, 
such a law would legalize a second land nationalization. But 
this law was not the main topic at the news conference of the 
right-wing opposition leader. 
  Vytautas Landsbergis focused his principal attention on a 
statement adopted by the Homeland Union, the Christian 
Democratic, Nationalist and Freedom factions in the Seimas on 
tension in the national defense structure. One of the examples 
of such tension are searches in the apartments of servicemen, 
which violate the Constitution and provoke people. One of the 
main sources of such tension is the activity of the leading 
group of the present National Security Committee, its chosen 
unlawful way of exceeding the authorizations of parliamentary 
control and carrying out functions of the executive power, 
striving to take over the whole national defense system. He 
also says that lack of confidence in the chairman of the 
National Security Committee is rife and that the composition of 
this committee should be changed. Since the Democratic Labor 
Party leadership is capitulating to these extremists, 
stabilizing actions must be taken by the republic's president, 
he said. 
  To a question on how the composition of the Seimas National 
Security Committee could be changed, Vytautas Landsbergis 
replied: In the usual way, like everything else. And if the 
ruling party does not take such actions, it will bear full 
responsibility for the consequences. 
  Speaking of the collection of signatures by the Social 
Democratic faction under an interpellation to the government, 
the leader of the right-wing opposition said that material 
collected by the Social Democrats is essential for the analysis 
of the government's work, but stressed that the Homeland Union 
favors an interpellation questioning the ruling of the 
Democratic Labor Party and not of the Slezevicius government. 
There are no reserves to form a better Democratic Labor Party 
government, therefore we speak of new elections and not of a 
change of the government, he said. The Homeland Union intends 
to take further steps in solving Lithuania's problems, and these 
steps should be known next week, Landsbergis said. 
  Landsbergis also spoke about the technical errors in the 
documents signed by the Russian president, stressing that this 
was an old tactic of Russian foreign policy: To reflect [as 
heard] and then deny, leaving this reflection in [word 
indistinct]

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 07, BNS -- The Lithuanian state radio 
and TV board decided on Tuesday [5 April] that channel 38 will 
be shared by the Polish TV Polonia and the Vilnius-based 
Baltijos TV. 
  The state-run TV Polonia, which recently replaced Polish 
national TV on the channel, will show its programs every second 
day three times a week. The private Baltijos TV, which is a 
Lithuania-USA joint venture, will have four days on the channel. 
  Gintaras Songaila, Baltijos TV director general, said he 
will 
bring action against the board. In his words, politics is mixed 
up in the board's decision and in its activities in general. 
  Gediminas Ilgunas, chairman of the radio and TV board, 
agrees 
that the decision is not very good. He added, however, that a 
suggestion to divide time on the channel by hours was not 
perfect either. 
  Ilgunas said the dispute over channel 38 started last 
December when the board decided that Polish state TV would 
broadcast for 45 hours a week and the remaining time would be 
rented by way of contest. But Polish TV and Baltijos TV, which 
won the remaining time on the channel in a contest, failed to 
agree on air time, he said. 
  In Ilgunas' words, Polish TV complained that Baltijos TV 
ignores its interests and interrupts its programs whenever it 
wants. 
  "The Poles got what they wanted," Songaila said. He noted 
that his station is able to fully cover time on channel 38. 
  Songaila said the board's decision violates laws regulating 
media activities in Lithuania. According to the existing 
legislation, a media company must be registered in Lithuania and 
the share of foreign capital in it must not exceed a half of its 
stock capital. Why doesn't this apply to TV Polonia, Songaila 
said. 
  But the board has not yet discussed the situation on a 
channel rented by TELE-3, a private TV station that broadcasts 
throughout Lithuania. Liucija Baskauskaite, the station's 
owner, presented document to the board confirming that the 
station paid all bills to communication services. Ilgunas said 
the station's debt reached 165,000 lits in mid-March. 
  The Lithuanian radio and TV transmission center earlier 
submitted a claim for arbitration demanding to cancel its 
contract with TELE-3 because of its debts for transmitter rent. 
The center accused the station of violating other terms of the 
contract. 
  But the state arbitration failed to pass any decision 
Wednesday.

  [Text] Vilnius -- We had thought that the affair of KGB 
agent "Klyuger" was over and done with long ago. In particular, 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA reported that Lithuania's law enforcement 
organs had wound up their investigations into the well-known 
entrepreneur A. Klimaytis [name as transliterated], who had been 
accused of collaborating with the KGB to benefit the USSR. A. 
Klimaytis was a prominent politician and a vigorous supporter of 
the ideas of the Democratic Labor Party, which ultimately became 
the ruling party. In the period of the battle for power A. 
Klimaytis was accused of collaborating with the KGB and was 
arrested. 
  Now comes a new report. K. Milkeraytis [name as 
transliterated], special investigator with the General 
Prosecutor's Investigations Department, has stated at a press 
conference that certain political strata have an interest in 
burying the notorious A. Klimaytis-"Klyuger" affair. 
  It is symptomatic that the bugbear of the KGB has been 
brought out of the closet at precisely this time. 
  "We would not be surprised at the desire of any political 
forces to gain power if it were done by democratic means, if 
those forces were able to concentrate greater intellectual 
potential than the forces currently in power, and if they knew 
better ways to solve Lithuania's problems," a statement from 
political prisoners and dissidents reads. "Unfortunately, this 
cannot be said of the political forces which are currently 
striving to destroy authority and to destabilize all spheres of 
life...."

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 07, BNS - The Lithuanian freighter 
Elatma sank in the North sea under "very suspicious 
circumstances," the ship's captain told Kestutis Miniotas, 
president of the Vortika company that owned the ship, the 
Vilnius-based LIETUVOS AIDAS newspaper said. 
  As previously reported, Elatma sank early Monday [4 April] 
some 80 kilometers off the Dutch coast. All 11 crew were 
rescued by a Belgian navy helicopter. The freighter was 
transporting more than 1,300 tons of ammonium nitrate to France. 
  Miniotas quoted the ship's captain as saying that Elatma 
couldn't have started to take on water because of weather 
conditions or through technical reasons. The captain said the 
ship's hull looked as if an explosion took place inside it. 
  Miniotas said the ship's hull was in good shape and was 
supposed to keep the freighter on float even if water penetrated 
one of its sections. Elatma also had very modern navigation 
equipment, he said. 
  The company set up a special commission to investigate the 
accident and to assess the damage. 
  Elatma, 103 meters long and 12.2 meters wide, now lies 
around 
30 meters deep in a zone where international navigation is very 
intensive. The ship may have to be raised together with the 
freight.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- Press Secretary of the 
Russian president Vyacheslav Kostikov told a briefing here today 
that the Russian-Western "romantic embrace" is over. 
  "I think what has happened is that Russia, Europe and 
America 
have passed the stage of romanticism in post-totalitarian 
diplomacy when both sides embraced each other so tightly that 
national security interests were left aside," he said. 
  "Russia increasingly sees itself as a great power and it has 
started saying this loudly. Europe has understood that Russian 
interests will no longer dissolve in the interests of European 
diplomacy. At the same time, I would not say we are talking 
about a cooling of relations," noted Kostikov. 
  "I think it is good, it is right because it will save us 
from 
disappointments or even mistakes in the future and negotiations 
will have a sound pragmatic basis," he stressed.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin did not receive a 
delegation of U.S. congressmen who were supposed to meet with 
him on Wednesday 6 April. 
  The members of the delegation, headed by the leaders of the 
Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives, say 
that they are more than satisfied with the talk they had with 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  But it has become known from sources behind the scenes that 
the delegation's plans did indeed include: "Meeting with 
Yeltsin -- a meeting which did not take place for reasons not 
stated." 
  It is the first time such a thing has happened in the 
history 
of Russian-U.S. relations. Congressmen from the United States, 
on visting Moscow, regarded a meeting with our top leader as 
something that went almost without saying, and their 
expectations were never disappointed. On the other hand, you 
could count on the fingers of one hand the number of audiences 
granted to our parliamentary leaders by U.S. presidents. 
  Be that as it may, at the press conference at which the 
congressmen summed up their visit to Moscow it was again stated 
that support for reforms is in the long-term interests of both 
America and Russia. 
  In a brief conversation with me, Richard Gephardt, leader of 
the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, was, 
however, rather evasive when asked when we can finally expect 
the lifting of all the restrictions dating back to the Cold War 
period which are hampering the active development of trade and 
economic cooperation between our countries. He reported that a 
legislative initiative will be presented at the current session 
of Congress lifting these restrictions, including the no longer 
relevant Jackson-Vanik amendment, now more than 20 years old. 
But Gephardt's remarks showed no certainty that the initiative 
will be approved at this session. Yet the next congressional 
elections in the United States are due in November, in January 
next year the new Congress will assemble, and anything that has 
been proposed but not approved in the present session will 
automatically be annulled. 
  In other words, it will be necessary to start all over 
again. 
And that is a lengthy process. Incidentally, back in April 
1993, at the Vancouver summit, Clinton solemnly promised our 
president "to tackle in the very near future" all the obstacles 
in the path of the development of our trade and economic 
relations. 
  According to Gephardt, "the Russian parliamentarians could 
learn some things from us." What things, I asked. 
  "We could tell them about the difficulties and 
disappointments we encounter and experience as legislators, 
about how often we are simply not able to do anything because we 
cannot get a majority. This happens in our Congress, where there 
are only two parties, unlike your multiparty parliament. And 
then we simply do nothing. But that is in the nature of 
democracy."

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Sychev under the general heading: </F>
"Russia Does Not Intend To Create Military Bases in Latvia. 
Diplomats Believe Boris Yeltsin Was Given the Wrong Document To 
Sign"] 
  [Text] "The agreements concluded between Russia and 
Lativa, including the agreement on the military facility at 
Skrunde, were approved by President Yeltsin. There have been no 
changes in our position," IZVESTIYA was told by Sergey Zotov, 
special envoy and head of the state delegation to the talks with 
Latvia. 
  "In the interstate agreements that have been initialed, the 
radar station at Skrunde is defined as a `Russian military 
establishment under civilian control,' and it is stated that it 
cannot be 'endowed with the status of a military base,'" Zotov 
said. 
  According to information obtained by IZVESTIYA from various 
sources, the Russian Foreign Ministry does not know how the 
Skrunda radar station found its way into President Yeltsin's 
directive on the creation of military bases on the territory of 
CIS states. Especially since Latvia is not a member of the 
Commonwealth. 
  Diplomats rule out the existence of a political subtext to 
the presidential directive, and are inclined to think it is a 
question of an annoying technical error. In their opinion the 
president was given an old draft to sign, which had been 
circulating around the bureaucracy for a long time. The 
officials responsible for drafting it had not made the necessary 
amendments to the text. 
  People in the president's entourage, judging by Press 
Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov's statement, are also inclined to 
think in terms of a "technical error" causing the furor which is 
threatening to wreck the accords that had been reached. They 
are studying the history of the error and considering how to 
avoid possible negative consequences.

<F P=106> [Report by IZVESTIYA military correspondent Viktor Litovkin </F>
under the general heading: "Russia Does Not Intend To Create 
Military Bases in Latvia. Diplomats Believe Boris Yeltsin Was 
Given the Wrong Document To Sign"] 
  [Text] "All talk of turning our radar station at Skrunde 
into a military base is unfounded," I was told by Yelena 
Agapova, assistant to the Russian defense minister for relations 
with the public and the press. 
  A few days previously, the Defense Ministry Information and 
Press Directorate had refuted an ITAR-TASS report on this 
matter. Chief of General Staff Colonel General Mikhail 
Kolesnikov did not and could not have told the agency's 
correspondent about the transformation of the radar station into 
a military base. Russia had and has no such plans. 
  Nonetheless, statements by Russian Defense Minister Army 
General Pavel Grachev have repeatedly mentioned plans for the 
creation of 28 military bases outside the country's borders. 
Where is it proposed to put them? 
  The locations of some of them are already known, according 
to 
the minister's statements at press conferences: In Georgia, 
where under an interstate agreement -- which alone can serve as 
the legal foundation for such bases -- Russian military bases 
are to be located in Akhalkalaki, Batumi, where there are 
Russian divisions, Tbilisi (the headquarters of the 
Transcaucasus Group of Forces is there), and Poti, where Russian 
Navy ships can be stationed in the port zone. The total number 
of our troops will not exceed 25,000. 
  There are also troops of ours in Armenia, in the garrison of 
Gyumri (formerly Leninakan). They are also there under an 
interstate agreement between Yerevan and Moscow. 
  The locations of the other military bases are not yet known, 
since there are no interstate treaties concerning them. Without 
such treaties all talk of such bases, the military department 
believes, can only act as a basis for political speculation by 
various forces in certain states, as is happening in the case of 
the Skrunde radar station.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Vladimir Taranov and </F>
Boris Krivoshey] 
  [Text] Moscow, 7 April -- The appearance of the document on 
setting up Russian military bases in CIS countries and Latvia 
has come as a surprise to the Russian Foreign Ministry. The 
Russian Foreign Ministry did not take part in agreeing the 
document. Grigoriy Karasin, director of the press and 
information directorate of the Russian Foreign Ministry said 
this at a briefing today. 
  It is necessary to study the contents of the document, he 
said, and then we will give a really qualified assessment of its 
contents through diplomatic channels. The Russian diplomat did 
not rule out that explanations would possibly be provided in a 
different form. 
  Karasin stressed that he was against attaching unnecessary 
sensationalism to the matter. It should be sorted out, we 
should look at the document, at its wording, and who presented 
it, and after that we will promulgate our official point of 
view, he said. 
  According to him, the Russian ambassador in Riga was invited 
to the Latvian Foreign Ministry where he had talks on the 
matter. Military aspects of bilateral relations between Russia 
and Latvia were resolved and are reflected in relevant 
agreements initialed by the two countries. We confirm once 
again, the Russian diplomat said, that we adhere to the 
agreements. We regard Skrunde as a facility and not a military 
base, so there cannot be questions here.

  [Text] At a press conference at the end of his talks with 
Swedish foreign minister Margareta af Ugglas in Pskov, Andrey 
Kozyrev declared that Russia was not interested in having 
military bases in Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia and that "no 
document to this end exists." 
  Kozyrev called for "Latvia signing as soon as possible a 
package of agreements with Russia so that bilateral relations 
could be significantly improved and Russian troops pulled out of 
that republic by August 31." He added, "we also expect Estonia 
which has serious problems with Russia to move towards the 
signing of agreements. The ball is now in the Estonians' court." 
  He said that Russia "would like to resolve the 
Russo-Estonian 
border issue through cooperation but we have had no positive 
signals from the Estonian authorities. 
  The Swedish foreign minister emphasized her country's view 
that the Russian troops had to be pulled out soon and completely 
from the Baltic countries. "We also welcome Russia's desire to 
have appropriate agreements with the Baltic countries. I hope 
that such agreements will be reached with both Latvia and 
Estonia. What is important is that it happens before August 31 
which should become the final deadline for withdrawal of Russian 
troops." 
  In her words, Sweden was prepared to help Russia with 
housing 
for the servicemen leaving the Baltic countries but would like 
specific agreements on troop withdrawal come first.

5 April. [passage omitted]

mistake in the document that allegedly makes possible the 
deployment of a military base in Latvia with a language 
confusion. 
  Kostikov told a briefing here today that the military 
sometimes call a base an object. Thus, the Skrunda Radar 
Station was named a base by mistake instead of an object. 
  "None has planned to build a military base, and the Latvian 
leadership was presented apologies in connection with the 
technical mistake," he said. 
  As for military bases in Commonwealth States, the Russian 
military presence there is intiated by the Commonwealth States 
themselves, stressed the presidential press secretary.

following statement released by the Russian Defence Ministry on 
Thursday: 
  "In connection with the publication in the mass media of 
Order no.174-RP of April 5, 1994 of the president of the Russian 
Federation on Russian military bases on the territory of former 
Soviet republics, the Ministry of Defence of the Russian 
Federation considers it necessary to make the following 
statement. 
  "The Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation has never 
planned and is not planning to establish any military bases on 
the territory of Latvia, nor test there new weapons and military 
hardware. The document prepared by the Ministry of Defence 
together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs mentioned the 
establishment, on the basis of military units of the Russian 
Armed Forces stationed on the territory of former Soviet 
republics, of Russian military bases and facilities in the 
interests of ensuring the security of the Russian Federation and 
those states. It meant not the establishment of a military 
base, but the missile attack warning station in Skrunda, the 
negotiations on which are still underway with the Latvian side. 
The presidential order instructs the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, the Defence Ministry of Russia and other concerned 
ministries and departments to continue the negotiation process 
with the CIS member-states and Latvia on this matter."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Boris Vlasov and </F>
Dmitriy Gorokhov] 
  [Text] Pskov 7 April, TASS -- At a final stage of his stay 
in Pskov, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev visited on 
Thursday the "Kunichna Gora" check point on the Russian-Estonian 
border. 
  Public representatives from the frontier town of Pechory 
handed over to him an address in which they expressed an alarm 
in connection with Estonia's territorial claims on this ancient 
Russian locality and called the leadership to strengthen and 
improve conditions on the border. 
  Andrey Kozyrev called the territorial claims of Tallinn 
unfounded and stressed that Estonia, just as Russia, were 
recognized within the existing borders. Moscow, the foreign 
minister noted, is in the know about these problems and is 
closely watching them. It is necessary to strengthen the 
border, but at the same time there is no need to make it 
"impenetrable." Here, on the spot, Andrey Kozyrev said, an 
optimal regime should be determined and a formula found which 
will suit both sides. 
  The problems of the strengthening of the border and the 
troops withdrawal are exclusively issues of bilateral relations, 
but we are interested that these problems are known and 
understood by our neighbors in the region, the Russian foreign 
minister pointed out. 
  At the same time, Andrey Kozyrev noted, there are also 
problems of the rights of the Russian speaking population in 
Estonia. These issues are not exclusively the subject of the 
Russo-Estonian dispute. After all, there is international law 
and all-European norms which must be observed. We are raising 
this issue very insistently, the Russian foreign minister 
emphasised.

  [Text] Estonian Foreign Ministry's Vice-Chancellor Raul 
Malk described the atmosphere at the 18th round of 
Estonian-Russian talks completed in Moscow on Thursday as 
unfavorable. 
  Speaking a a press conference in Tallinn, he noted that 
Estonia did not expect special results from the talks, because 
the difference over the main issue, the withdrawal of Russian 
troops, was very serious. According to Malk, from the very 
beginning the Russian delegation took an ultimatum position, 
linking the withdrawal of troops to giving residence permits to 
retired military pensioners and putting forward unjustified 
demands. "In essence, there have been no talks on military 
pensioners at all," he said. 
  At the same time, Malk characterized the talks on 
humanitarian issues as "the most fruitful." "This is especially 
evident compared to the previous rounds," he pointed out. 
  Addressing the border issues, Malk said that the prepared 
but 
not ratified agreement on support for border regions "had been 
assigned to history." 
  Malk dismissed allegations of the Russian side that two 
criminals who killed a Russian border guard on 1 April and 
wounded another two had come from Estonian territory and had 
returned there. "All these allegations were not confirmed," he 
said. 
  The delegation's secretary, Ago Tiima, who attended the 
press 
conference also denies press reports about alleged serious 
environmental pollution on the territory of the Russian military 
unit in Viimsi near Tallinn on April 1. He said that eight 
tonnes of mazut leaked into a ditch and the press described it 
as an ecological disaster. 
  Tiiman noted that on Monday the site of the accident was 
visited by officials of the Estonian Environmental Protection 
and Foreign Ministries. "What they saw of course is unpleasant, 
but it is not an ecological disaster," Tiiman said. "It would 
not be such a serious event in the republic if the Russian side 
had informed us at once and in detail about the accident," the 
diplomat said.

  [Text] Russia's Chief Airforce Commander Petr Deinekin says 
no agreement has so far been reached on the transfer to Russia 
of part of the former Soviet Union's strategic bomber aircraft 
deployed in Ukraine. In an interview with INTERFAX on Thursday, 
he put the number of such missile carrying aircraft at 42 
including 19 TU-160's and 23 TU-95 MC's. 
  The two countries are still at odds about the price. Kiev 
wants Russia to write off Rbl 700 Bn of its debt, but Moscow 
agrees to settle for less than a third of that amount. 
  Deinekin said the Russian Defense Ministry could easily 
order 
a new batch of aircraft for Rbl 700 Bn at home. He stressed 
that the Ukrainian bombers had been grounded for quite some time 
because of shortage of fuel and spare parts and extra spending 
would be needed to make them airworthy. 
  He regretted that Moscow's attempts to try to help Ukraine 
to 
denuclearize itself had failed to meet understanding from the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry. At the same time, he hoped further 
talks will be held in an effort to reach compromise.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Koretskiy report in the "Russian-Ukrainian </F>
Strategic Arms Talks" column: "Born to Fly, Without Kerosene 
They Cannot Even Crawl"] 
  [Text] Ukraine is ready to part not only with the nuclear 
weapons located on its territory but also with their delivery 
means. This much is clear from the start of confidential 
negotiations between Moscow and Kiev on the transfer to Russia 
of 42 Tu-95 MS's and Tu-160 strategic bombers that Ukraine 
inherited from the USSR. The fact that the talks are under way 
was yesterday confirmed by an informed source in the Russian 
Defense Ministry. Unlike Minsk and Alma-Ata [Almaty], however, 
which voluntarily ceded to Moscow all of their strategic 
weapons, Kiev intends not only to get rid of unwanted and costly 
to maintain toys, but also to get something in exchange. 
  Out of Ukraine's 42 strategic bombers, 19 are 
top-of-the-line 
Tu-160's (the aircraft was developed in 1975 as a counterbalance 
to the U.S. B-1B; it is inferior in combat load but superior in 
speed). The estimated cost of the Tu-160 is $250 million. The 
remaining 23 aircraft are Tu-95 MS's, second-generation 
strategic bombers. At present Ukraine's heavy aviation is 
located at air bases in Priluki, Uzin, and Ukrainsk. 
  The first reports about Ukraine's intention to sell these 
aircraft to Russia appeared in the Kiev press at the end of 
March. Among the first to raise this issue was the republic's 
Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, who proposed to sell the 
Tu-95 MS's and Tu-160's, "but not for money." He backed up his 
statement by the fact that "Ukraine's air space is too cramped 
for this class of aircraft." However, the explanation for the 
"generosity" of Mr. Radetskyy, who for more than two years has 
been reluctant to part with heavy aviation in spite of the 
cramped air space, is trivial. In the context of an energy 
crisis the average annual flying time in the Ukrainian Air Force 
does not exceed 35 to 40 hours. Meanwhile analogous figures in 
the U.S., FRG, and Dutch Air Forces are 160-180 hours, and in 
the USSR they were between 130 and 150 hours. Ukrainian Air 
Force simulators, on the other hand, do not give the pilots the 
full sensation of flight. 
  The reason for Kiev's "submission" is the defection of 
complete combat crews to Russia and the impossibility of 
maintaining the Tu's in combat readiness. The wish to obtain in 
exchange "components for front and army aircraft and also fuel," 
however, as expressed by Mr. Radetskyy, will hardly meet with 
Moscow's understanding. Just like an alternative proposal to 
exchange the bombers for Tu-134 and Tu- 154 civil aircraft in a 
1:3 proportion. 
  As a source in the Russian Defense Ministry told 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent, Moscow views as the most 
acceptable "settlement" option the use of the heavy aircraft to 
cover Kiev's indebtedness on natural gas supplies. Because the 
talks began only two or three days ago, however, it is too soon 
to talk about any variant of a deal on strategic aviation. As 
for the "gas" option, Gazprom has not yet given its consent. 
Indeed, why would it want strategic bombers? 
  Kiev's aspiration to relieve itself of an unbearable burden 
is understandable. What is not is why Moscow has engaged in 
this strange horse trading. After all, the redeployment of 
Tu-95's and Tu-160's to Russia will call for their subsequent 
conversion as "non-nuclear" (so that the START II provisions on 
strategic aviation are observed), which will demand substantial 
expenses not envisioned in the budget. It would be easy to 
invite Kiev, "in a brotherly manner," simply to give the planes 
away for free. Even so, the Russian Defense Ministry has made 
it clear that so far they are not going to pay for this 
hardware. Actually, there is nothing to pay with. 
<H5>  The Strategic Component of the Russian and U.S. Air Forces </H5>
  Russia (CIS): 
  52 Tu-95 K aircraft. Capable of carrying up to eight 
cruise missiles to a distance of up to 12,800 km. 
  63 Tu-95 MS aircraft. Capable of carrying up to 16 cruise 
missiles to a distance of up to 18,000 km. Before February 
1994, 40 aircraft of this class were located on the territory of 
Kazakhstan and 23 are still based in Ukraine. 
  23 to 25 Tu-160 aircraft (exact number unknown). Capable 
of carrying 12 cruise missiles to a distance of up to 11,000 km; 
19 aircraft of this class are based in Priluki. The last such 
aircraft was manufactured by the Kazan aircraft plant in August 
1992. 
  The United States: 
  95 B-52H Stratofortress aircraft. Capable of carrying up 
to 20 cruise missiles to a distance of up to 16,000 km. 
  95 B-1B Lancer aircraft. Capable of carrying up to 16 
dumb [svobodnopadayushchiye] bombs to a distance of up to 19,800 
km. 
  20 B-2 Northrop ("Stealth") aircraft. Capable of carrying 
between eight and 16 cruise missiles to a distance of up to 
11,000 km. The first five aircraft of this class were to be 
adopted by the U.S. Air Force for service in December 1993.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Strategic Bomber Accord With Ukraine </F>
Not Reached"] 
  [Text] Petr Deynekin, commander-in-chief of the Russian 
Federation Air Force, has intimated that no "mutually acceptable 
agreement" on the turning over to Russia of strategic bombers 
stationed on Ukraine's territory has been reached so far. 
According to him, the stumbling block at the talks is the 
"astronomical" sum the Ukrainian side is asking for the transfer 
of the bombers. Ukraine wishes to pay around 700 billion rubles 
of its debt to Russia in 42 aircraft. In the Russian side's 
view, the figure should be some 200 billion rubles.

  [Text] Moscow, 7 Apr -- The Russian State Customs Committee 
has exempted from duty deliveries of 2,000 tonnes of seed grain 
purchased with U.S. government funds and being sent from Russia 
to Armenia. By forgoing customs duties to the value of 
$750,000, Russia has thus participated in a joint humanitarian 
act with the United States. This was stated at a briefing today 
by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the press and information 
department of the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  The Russian diplomat noted that there is some perplexity 
over 
claims by some mass media analysts that Russia intends to 
prevent the passage to Armenia of humanitarian grain in order to 
put political pressure on Yerevan and Washington.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kuleshov report: "Yuriy Shafranik Will Help Build </F>
Turkmenia-Iran-Turkey-Europe Gas Pipeline"] 
  [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] -- An international conference 
in Ashkhabad regarding the organization of oil and gas exports 
from Turkmenia [Turkmenistan], in which government delegations 
from Russia, Iran, Turkey, and Kazakhstan and representatives of 
U.S. and Argentine business circles took part, has decided the 
route of a gas pipeline linking Turkmenia, Iran, Turkey, and 
Europe. An agreement has also been signed between the Turkmen 
and Russian Governments on cooperation in developing the fuel 
and energy complexes. 
  With Russian Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik's 
participation in this meeting any suspicion that Russia would 
shun the development of Turkmenia's fuel and energy complexes, 
primarily the laying of a transcontinental gas pipeline from 
Turkmenia to Europe, has been dispelled. Two years ago, after 
signing the bilateral agreement on friendship and cooperation 
between Turkmenistan and Russia, President Boris Yeltsin told 
journalists: 
  "Turkmenia and Russia today have the richest stocks of 
natural gas in the CIS. However, the supply of gas can be 
increased. We discussed this issue with Saparmurad Niyazov and 
have come to the conclusion that cooperation in this sphere is 
of mutual benefit. Russia is willing to invest the necessary 
funds in the construction of a gas pipeline, which will make it 
possible to transport Turkmen gas to Europe...." 
  This was reaffirmed by Yuriy Shafranik today: "We will try 
to help Turkmenia. Cooperation will enable our states to 
cooperate on the European market in the future without 
infringing one another's interests." 
  Representatives of the Turkmen, Iranian, Russian, and 
Turkish 
Governments agreed to set up an interstate council chaired by 
President Niyazov with regard to organizing oil and gas exports 
from Turkmenia to world markets. 
  The draft documents will be examined at a meeting of the 
council members in Tehran 1 July this year.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F>
correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy 
Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Russia's Foreign Ministry has closely followed the 
development of events in and around Gorazde, where clashes 
between Bosnian Serbs and Muslims flared up once again, a 
high-ranking Russian diplomat told Interfax on Thursday. 
  According to him, Bosnian Serbs reacted to Muslim acts of 
provocation in the area of Gorazde "inadequately." "The Serbs 
made a four-kilometer incursion from the disengagement line, and 
invaded several villages, whose Muslim population took shelter 
in the city of Gorazde which is controlled by Muslim units," the 
diplomat said. 
  As he said, the situation is aggravated by the circumstance 
that in Gorazde the Muslims are holding about 50 Serb prisoners 
of war, whom the field commanders of Bosnian Serbs are seeking 
to free at any cost. 
  On Friday, the official from Russia's Foreign Ministry said, 
high-ranking representatives of Bosnian Serbs and Muslims are to 
meet in Sarajevo's airport to discuss the possible ways to reach 
a settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole, and in Gorazde in 
particular. 
  According to Interfax's interviewee, the formula that helped 
to ease tensions in and around another Bosnian city, Srebrenica, 
could be used in the area of Gorazde. "Stipulated in an 
agreement reached between Bonian Serbs, Muslims and the command 
of the U.N. protection forces, the formula provides for 
withdrawing the armed units of both sides from the line of 
confrontation, demilitarizing the "buffer" zone and deploying 
U.N. peace-keeping forces there," he said. 
  This week-end or early next week the special envoy of the 
Russian president, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, may 
make a trip to the Balkans, the diplomat said. "We are working 
in two directions -- Bosnia and Krajina. It's not surprising 
therefore that the program of his trip includes Zagreb and 
Belgrade," he added. 
  According to Interfax's interviewee, in Moscow on Wednesday 
Churkin conferred with one of the leaders of Bosnian Serbs, 
Momcilo Krajisnik, and discussed with him the situation that had 
emerged in the wake of the Washington agreements signed to form 
a Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina,and subsequently 
establish a confederation between it and Croatia. "The two men 
discussed the role Bosnian Serbs could play under these 
agreements. Russia wants the lawful rights of the third nation 
making up the state of Bosnia- Herzegovina -- Bosnian Serbs -- 
to be observed," he stressed. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of 
the 
Russian president, will fly to Belgrade Sunday, April 10 to meet 
with Serbia's leaders, Grigoriy Karasin, a spokesman for the 
Russian Foreign Ministry, said at a briefing in Moscow Thursday. 
  Karasin added that Churkin would meet with Croatian leaders 
in Zagreb Monday and the next day would attend talks on the 
economic issues of the settlement that would be held in the 
Russian embassy to Croatia. 
  Karasin did not rule out the possibility that Churkin would 
also visit Sarajevo.

  [Text] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin has 
urged the Russia's Choice parliamentary group to support the 
government's decision to join NATO's Partnership for Peace 
program. 
  Russia's membership in the program would "determine a model 
on the basis of which relations between Russia and the West will 
be built in future" and would mean that Russia had opted for 
cooperation instead of isolation, Churkin said at a meeting of 
the group, to which he was invited to give the Foreign 
Ministry's position on the current developments in the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Parliament this week put on its agenda a motion for lifting 
economic sanctions against rump Yugoslavia, Croatia's Serb 
Krajina and the Serb Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The motion 
was made by the parliamentary group of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's 
nationalist Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  Asked whether the LDP group's pro-Serb line had any impact 
on 
the Foreign Ministry's position, Churkin said the ministry "has 
had to pursue its political line under considerable political 
pressure since the times of the former Supreme Soviet." But 
internal political struggles have no effect on the ministry's 
course, which enables Russia to make active efforts to settle 
the Yugoslav crisis "together with the world community and 
without conflicting with the world community," Churkin said. 
  He said unconditional support for Serbia would mean support 
for Serb extremism, which would be "dangerous for the entire 
Serb people." All parties to the conflict are southern Slavs, 
so Russia is not interested in the Serbs alone, Churkin said. 
Besides, Russia is a "multinational and multireligious state," 
something the Foreign Ministry took into account when sending an 
additional contingent for the Sarajevo peacekeeping force. Part 
of the contingent were members of Muslim communities in Russia, 
he said.

  [Text] Moscow, 7 Apr (TANJUG) -- The sanctions against 
Yugoslavia have become meaningless and should be abolished as 
soon as possible. This is the main conclusion reached during 
the talks in Moscow this evening between Ivan Rybkin, chairman 
of the Russian State Duma, and members of the Yugoslav Assembly 
delegation led by Radoman Bozovic, speaker of the Chamber of 
Citizens. 
  The delegation arrived in Moscow today at the invitation of 
the Russian parliament. This is the first official visit of the 
Yugoslav parliamentary delegation to a foreign country -- at the 
invitation of partners -- since the introduction of the 
sanctions against Yugoslavia. 
  The Yugoslav delegation includes: Borisav Jovic, Milan 
Komnenic, Milan Gajovic and Milan Rochen, Yugoslav charge 
d'affaires in Moscow. 
  The talks focused on parliamentary cooperation, the 
situation 
in the two countries and in former Yugoslavia, as well as on 
possibilities for ending the conflict and abolishing the 
sanctions. 
  In a statement for Yugoslav reporters after the meeting, 
Ivan 
Rybkin said the sanctions against Yugoslavia are unacceptable -- 
this being his personal opinion and the opinion of the majority 
of Russian deputies. In his words it is first necessary to 
secure peace and this is the order of things which must be 
respected. Rybkin said that the conflict must be resolved in a 
peaceful way and that many international factors are involved in 
this process. 
  In his statement for the journalists Radoman Bozovic said 
that the Russian State Duma is the place where the essence of 
the Yugoslav crisis and the pointlessness of the sanctions are 
best understood. He added that only a just peace can be 
permanent and stable. He is convinced that the sanctions are 
not only pointless but also that they fail to help resolve the 
crisis in Yugoslavia -- they are harmful and suit the advocates 
of war. 
  We were pleased to hear, Bozovic said, that all deputies' 
groups share this opinion and that they have influence on the 
Russian Government and the international public concerning the 
sanctions, which are punishing a nation and encouraging those 
who favor continuing the war. 
  The Yugoslav parliamentary delegation, which will spend 
several days in Moscow, will resume talks with Russian officials 
tomorrow.

  [Text] Moscow, 7 Apr--A protocol signed by the Governments 
of the Russian Federation and the Hungarian Republic provides 
for the construction of an AES [Nuclear Electric Power Station] 
in Hungary. 
  "In accordance with the protocol, Russia will also supply 
Hungary with nuclear fuel," Georgiy Kaurov, head of the Russian 
Ministry of Atomic Energy's [Minatom] Information and Public 
Relations Department, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
"Furthermore, our organizations will begin to receive nuclear 
fuel exhausted at the Paks AES after a five-year interval at the 
station. We cannot refuse to accept it. That would mean 
breaking obligations and undermining Russia's international 
reputation as a reliable partner." 
  "Let me explain", Kaurov added. "Russia receives exhausted 
fuel and not radioactive waste from Hungary. The two things are 
not at all the same. During processing, useful components are 
given off that are used as repeat fuel for an AES. Russia's 
Minatom enterprises have highly effective and ecologically sound 
processing technology for nuclear fuel. I would also point out 
that the protocol guarantees a stable hard currency income that 
allows resources to be channelled into rehabilitating polluted 
sites and implementing programs for handling radioactive waste."

  [Text] Pskov 7 April, TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev met on Thursday with his Swedish counterpart 
Margaretha af Ugglas in the town of Pskov to consider 
possiblities of revitalizing the economy of Russia's 
northwestern region. 
  The Pskov region attracted the attention of Swedish 
businessmen by its rich natural resources and developed 
industry. They also hope to benefit considerably by taking part 
in rehabilitation of the region's ailing agrarian sector. 
  After discussing ways of improving the Pskov region's 
economy 
by joint efforts and seeing the sights of the old Russian town, 
Mrs. af Ugglas left for Sweden. 
  Meanwhile, her Russian counterpart visited the Pechora 
segment of the Russian-Estonian border, where he was informed 
about the construction of border facilities and about the 
current situation on the border which has been deteriorating 
with every passing day. 
  Senior officials of the regional administration told the 
Russian foreign minister that they would like to improve ties 
with the Baltic republics rather than to tighten a border 
regime. Nevertheless, Kozyrev said, it would be better to 
reinforce the border with technical means than with bodies of 
Russian soldiers. 
  On Thursday night, the Russian foreign minister flew off 
back 
to Moscow.

  [Text] Moscow April 7 TASS -- "The invigoration of Russia's 
role in the Middle East and recent intensive contacts by Russian 
diplomacy in that region of the world are connected with the 
critical situation into which it has been plunged by the tragic 
events in Hebron that claimed the lives of dozens of 
Palestinians," the Russian President's Envoy to the Middle East 
Viktor Posuvalyuk said. 
  Speaking at a news briefing at the Foreign Ministry Press 
Centre in Moscow on Thursday, Posuvalyuk said that some Russian 
and foreign media reports have distorted the reasons for 
Moscow's growing role in the Middle East. He stressed that its 
main aim is to save the peace process and facilitate the 
resumption of the PLO-Israeli and Arab-Israeli talks. 
  The envoy said considerable progress has been reached in 
this 
sphere. Palestinians and Israelis resumed talks in Cairo. Work 
is underway to prepare talks between Israel and Arabs. He 
denied that the peace process has acquired some element of 
competitiveness with the United States. The Middle East theme 
will continue to dominate our foreign policy, he added. 
  He admitted that there have been disruptions in the work of 
the co-sponsors of the Middle East peace process, but they were 
not caused by malicious intent of either side. This is a new 
business on which no textbooks have been written yet. The 
co-sponsors must act extremely carefully while looking for ways 
of reaching peace between Arabs and Israelis, he said. 
  Posuvalyuk did not deny that the U.S. and Russia are 
pursuing 
their own interests in the region, but added that this should 
not affect their efforts to help restore peace in the Middle 
East. 
  He said that Russian and American officials will hold 
consultations in Washington to attain a greater degree of 
coordination in their joint work.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Tyssovskiy] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- Viktor Posuvalyuk, the 
Russian president's special envoy, tackling problems linked with 
the settlement of the Middle East issue, told Russian and 
foreign journalists at the press centre of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry here today about the results of his recent trips to 
Syria, Jordan and Israel. 
  "The Near East is really near for us, Russians," he said. 
"This explains, in particular, the recent intensity of Russian 
diplomatic contacts in the region. During his visit to 
Damascus, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov handed to 
President Hafiz Al-Asad a message from Boris Yeltsin. We 
regard Syria's role in the Middle East peace process as a key 
factor, without which any contacts between the parties to the 
dragged out conflict would be one-sided, to say the least. 
Al-Asad's personal authority as a political leader is very 
high. Moscow's ties with Damascus are traditional and our 
attraction to each other remains very strong even though our 
relations had made little headway in the recent period." 
  Posuvalyuk stressed that the new Russo-Syrian relations were 
not beginning from scratch and that they had a rich background. 
He laid stress on the continuing dialogue and the development 
of economic relations that are based on new principles. 
"Al-Asad," the presidential envoy said, "agreed with us that the 
present level of relations did not meet the expectations of the 
two countries and that they should be further developed in all 
directions." 
  The diplomat said that the Syrian president welcomed 
Russia's 
active role in the effort to settle the Middle East problem. 
The views of the two countries on the approaches to this 
problem are similar. They believe that they should be based on 
the principle: Territories in exchange for peace". 
  Posuvalyuk met King Husayn of Jordan and Crown Prince Hassan 
in Amman. "It is gratifying," he said, "That the Jordanian 
leadership also assesses correctly the Russian policy in the 
Middle East. Jordan has made more progress in talks with Israel 
than the other Arab states. But the peace process calls for 
synchronous progress and King Husayn is well aware of it. He is 
fully dedicated to the achievement of an all-embracing 
settlement. 
  The presidential envoy met Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and 
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres during his visit to Israel. They 
assured the Russian representative that they were ready to exert 
every effort to resume the talks on Palestinian autonomy on the 
basis of the "Gaza-Jericho-today" plan. "During our talks," 
Posuvalyuk said, "we arrived at the conclusion that Russia's 
vigorous efforts in the Middle East are conducive for the peace 
process, and the Israeli side welcomed them. We also discussed 
preparations for Rabin's visit to Moscow." 
  Posuvalyuk especially stressed the importance of this visit 
and also of Yasir 'Arafat's trip to Moscow on April 19. "The 
Moscow meetings of the two leaders, who are displaying political 
wisdom and perspicacity, should be regarded as new links in the 
chain of events contributing to the peace process," he said.

  [Text] "With deep bitterness and indignation," Moscow 
received the reports on the attack on Israeli citizens in the 
city of 'Afula. "We harshly condemn this terrorist act, which 
led to human victims and express our condolences to the families 
of those killed," the head of the information and press 
department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Grigory Karasin, 
told a briefing in Moscow Thursday. 
  Karasin said "the event again raises the need to immediately 
carry out the measures to ensure the safety of Palestinian 
civilians in the occupied territories agreed on at the 
Palestinian-Israeli talks." 
  "Russia proceeds from the fact that this terrorist act 
should 
not distract Palestinians and Israelis from their main goal, 
this being to continue negotiations on the temporary 
introduction of Palestinian self-government on the occupied 
territories in accordance with the Declaration of Principles," 
Karasin was quoted as saying. "Once again, we call on both 
sides to show the maximum restraint, self-control and political 
will to achieve mutually acceptable agreements within the 
framework of the Middle East peace process."

  [Text] Moscow 7 April, TASS -- Iraqi delegation headed by 
Adnan Abdul Majid Alexander-Ani [name as received], adviser to 
the Iraqi president in the rank of a minister, ended its talks 
in Moscow on Thursday on the resumption of trade and economic, 
and scientific-technical cooperation between Russia and Iraq 
after the U.N. Security Council lifts its sanctions in respect 
of this country. 
  The Iraqi delegation met with representatives of several 
Russian ministries and departments. In the course of the talks 
both sides discussed a number of issues connected with the 
development of mutual ties in such branches as the oil and gas 
industry, electric power engineering, metallurgy, production of 
chemical goods, irrigation and agriculture, construction and 
reconstruction of terminals, as well as the expansion of trade 
at the post-sanction period. 
  Both sides reached an agreement about sending Russian 
experts 
to Iraq to specify and agree on a list of concrete objects and 
technical data. 
  In addition, the two sides agreed to hold in Moscow the 
first 
meeting of the Russo-Iraqi Commission on Trade, and Economic and 
Scientific-Technical Cooperation.

  [Text] Viktor Ivanovich Danilov-Danilyan, Russian minister 
of protection of the environment and natural resources, held 
talks with Japanese Ambassador to Russia Koji Watanabe on 4 
April. In the talks, the minister stated that a decision on 
dumping of liquid radioactive wastes into the sea should be made 
only by the Russian Government, and that the Maritime Kray 
administration has no authority to independently decide on the 
issue. Minister Danilov- Danilyan made the remarks in response 
to Ambassador Watanabe's concern over Japanese media reports 
that the Maritime Kray administration seems to be preparing to 
authorize additional dumping of liquid radioactive wastes into 
the Sea of Japan. 
  In proposing that Japan provide financial and technological 
assistance to Russia at an opportune time, Minister 
Danilov-Danilyan stated that it would be possible for Russia to 
completely prevent the dumping of liquid radioactive wastes into 
the sea if it can construct temporary tanks for storing the 
radioactive wastes in the maritime region with Japanese 
cooperation. In the meeting with Ambassador Watanabe on 4 
April, Minister Danilov-Danilyan highly appraised Japan's 
cooperative position in the field of dealing with nuclear 
wastes. Moreover, the minister assured that Russia would 
conduct a thorough environmental survey at storage tanks for 
liquid radioactive wastes as well as facilities for solidifying 
these wastes.

  He stressed that these relations will continue to develop on 
the basis of the Tokyo declaration signed after the

  The Tokyo declaration outlined the strategic perspective for

  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- "Russia backs the recent 
steps of the South African Government to enforce law and order. 
But these measures may prove insufficient without a long-term 
political agreement," a representative of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry stated at the ministry's press centre here today. 
  The developments in the Republic of South Africa are now in 
the focus of world public opinion: less than three weeks are 
left before the first universal parliamentary elections in the 
country. "All the world regards this event as a turning point in 
the history of South Africa, as a landmark after which the 
country will become a full- fledged member of the community of 
democratic states," the representative noted. 
  "In the meantime, the election campaign has brought the 
situation to a head in several parts of South Africa," the 
diplomat stated. "The political forces that are unable to win 
popularity among the electorate are becoming increasingly 
aggressive. They intend to boycott the elections and to prevent 
normal voting on the territories under their control," he added. 
The diplomat believes that "such a tactic actually leads to a 
break-up of the Republic of South Africa and threatens the 
society by an open armed confrontation frought with 
unpredictible consequences for the country an the entire region". 
  The representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry expressed 
the hope that the meeting among leaders of the conflicting 
sides, scheduled for saturday, would be constructive. The 
Russian Foreign Ministry expects "the meeting to adopt a firm 
commitment of all its participants to contribute by every means 
at their disposal to the free expression of the will of the 
South African electors on the entire territory of the country".

  [Text] Moscow, April 5, RIA -- "Yeltsin was his old self 
again," said Dr. Bella Denisenko, head of the parliamentary 
health committee, after he received spokesmen of Russia's Choice 
parliamentary group yesterday. "He was eager to cooperate with 
all reformers, especially Russia's Choice Party, currently in 
the making [as received] on our group's basis." 
  Information of MPs back from their constituencies shocked 
the 
president. He heard about local election returns forged, 
statistics held back, bosses' arbitrary action, and a new ruling 
class emerging from among executive and legislative officers. 
Russia's Choice thinks the president ought to be more choosy 
with official appointments. 
  Despite all latest rumours, Dr. Denisenko found Mr. Yeltsin 
in the best of health.

  [Text] Mikhail Poltoranin, democratic reformist member of 
the lower house of the Russian Federal Assembly and former vice 
premier of Russia, who came to Japan at the invitation of the 
Japan-Russia Parliamentary Union on 29 March, gave an exclusive 
interview to MAINICHI SHIMBUN at a hotel in Tokyo on 30 March. 
  Poltoranin stressed the significant influence that the draft 
"National Reconciliation Agreement" proposed by President Boris 
Yeltsin, which he and other parliamentarians drew up on 28 
March, will have on the stability of the Russian political 
situation. He indicated that in case the conservatives refuse 
to support the agreement, there is a possibility the 
presidential election may be advanced to late 1994 or early 1995. 
  The "National Reconciliation Agreement" was drawn up by 
Poltoranin and other representatives of the Parliament and the 
government. It is a document that designates the order of 
priority of current issues to be resolved by Russia in social, 
economic, and international affairs. According to Poltoranin, 
the agreement states that "Russian society will aim at achieving 
stability gradually." It also provides for a temporary freeze 
on the proposed advance presidential and parliamentary 
elections. While the document is not legally binding, the 
concurrence and signatures of the president, the speakers of 
both houses of parliament, the federal government [as 
published], the chairman of the Supreme Court, and 
representatives of all political blocs in the Federal Assembly 
are being sought. The president wants to stabilize the 
political situation with this document. 
  After the draft of the "Agreement" has been completed, 
supporters of the president are working on persuading all 
parties and factions, including the conservative forces 
advocating the overthrow of the president, to sign the document. 
Poltoranin said, "If we are unable to obtain the signatures of 
all parties and factions, there is a possibility that the 
presidential election may be advanced to late this year, or 
early next year." 
  Poltoranin is a close aide to Yeltsin. He was concurrently 
vice premier from February 1992. He ran for a seat in the lower 
house in the December 1993 elections and was elected.

  [Text] Moscow, April 5, RIA -- Speaking at the opening 
session of the talks between the official Tajik leaders and the 
opposition on the internal settlement, Russia's Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev said Russia regards its assistance in promoting 
the settlement of the political crisis in Tajikistan both as 
moral duty and the effort which corresponds to Russia's national 
interests. In the opinion of the top Russian diplomat, the 
talks will gradually gain significance, and called on the 
negotiators to prevent an outbreak of a new conflict in 
Tajikistan. He noted that Russia will shape its relations with 
respect to both parties proceeding from the progress of the 
talks.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Attempts To Halt Emigration in </F>
Kirghizia"] 
  [Text] The Kirghiz Government has formulated a program to 
reduce the level of emigration. 
  It contains a package of documents aimed at creating the 
requisite legislative base for emigration based on international 
legal norms as well as proposals to create joint ventures and 
production units, interstate investment funds, and a balanced 
cadre policy. The package also includes documents examining the 
full-fledged use of Russian within the system of public 
education, science, technology, and culture. A considerable 
part of the program is devoted to tightening up administrative 
and criminal liability for fueling interethnic enmity. What is 
more, special measures have been formulated to avert a "brain 
drain."

  At the same time, he noted that "alien strategic units 
cannot 
be stationed in Belarus, because that would run contrary to 
Belarus' aspiration to neutrality and non-nuclear status." 
  In the opinion of Valeriy Pavlov, "the present of Russian 
aviation bases or air-defense units in Belarus would help 
Belarussian colleagues to maintain "good condition," to get 
familiarized with the latest examples of equipment and arms and 
to resolve social problems." 
  Valeriy Pavlov noted that "all options of the presence of 
foreign military bases in Belarus will be thoroughly studied."

  [Text] Baku (April 6) TURAN--"The aim of my visit to Baku 
remains unchanged: to work on an agreement proposal concerning 
the resolution to the conflict", said Vladimir Kazimirov, 
special representative to the Russian President on 
Nagorno-Karabakh, during his arrival to the Azerbaijani capital 
during an interview with a TURAN correspondent. 
  According to Kazimirov the peacemaking mission will attempt 
to clarify positions regarding the Russian peace plan. 
Kazimirov noted that because of poor weather he could not 
arrive in Khankendi [Stepanakert] during his past visit. "The 
short meeting with several leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh was held 
half way between Yerevan and Stepanakert, somewhere on the 
border of Azerbaijan", said Kazimirov. 
  "The peacemaking and mediation missions must be conducted 
stage by stage, neither side wants its concessions to be 
announced publicly prematurely, and there has been no concession 
from the opposite side. That is why we should not hurry," said 
Kazimirov. 
  As has been earlier announced, Kazimirov arrived in Baku a 
week ago accompanied by members of the CIS Interparliamentary 
delegation in order to introduce the peace plan prepared by 
Russia and presented to the Azeri and Armenian sides. The major 
points of the plan provide for a cease-fire, the withdrawal from 
all occupied territories and a revision of the status of 
Nagorno-Karabakh.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 4/4/1994 -- Moldovan Parliament 
has approved today the structure and nominal composition of the 
government proposed by the Premier Andrei Sangheli. The new 
government will encompass 18 ministers, including the minister 
of state and minister of relations with the Parliament, instead 
of the 20 working now. According to Sangheli, the 
restructuration of the government will lead to the reduction in 
the state apparatus by 30-40 percent; it has now 5,000-6,000 
people for whose maintenance 3.2 percent of the budget means are 
used. Of four vice-premiers, three were entitled: Valentin 
Cunev, Ion Gutu, and Valeriu Bulgaru. As ministers were 
elected: Valeriu Bobutac (minister of economics); Valeriu Chitan 
(minister of finance); Ceslav Ciobanu (minister of 
privatization); Grigore Trifoi (minister of industry), Vitalie 
Gorincioi, (minister of agriculture); Ion Casian (minister of 
information and telecommunication); Dumitru Nedelcu (minister 
of social protection); Timofei Mosneaga (minister of health 
protection); Pavel Gaugas (minister of education); Vasile 
Sturza (minister of justice); Pavel Creanga (minister of 
defence); Constantin Antoci (minister of interior); Vasile 
Calmoi (minister of national security); Mihai Popov (minister 
of foreign affairs); Vasile Iov (minister of transport and 
road-works); Mihai Severovan (minister of utilities); Mihail 
Cibotaru (minister of culture); Gheorghe Gusac (minister of 
state); Victor Puscas (minister of relations with Parliament). 
During the debates the Christian-Democratic Popular Front of 
Moldova Alliance (FPCD) faction proposed to transform the 
minister of national security in a Department of Border Guards 
and an Information Service. This proposal was not supported by 
the parliamentary majority. The deputies decided that the 
premier will present the program of restructuring the Ministries 
of Security and Interior. The new composition of the government 
was passed with 83 votes for, eight against and one abstained. 
The faction of the Block of Peasants and Intellectuals (BTI) 
declared that they will not vote.

half of 1994, is also the CIS chairman, having held appropriate 
consultations, accepted the suggestion by CIS Executive 
Secretary Ivan Karatchenya regarding the date of the planned 
conference of the Council of the Heads of State and Government. 
The conference, as we have already reported, will be held on 15 
April in Moscow. Boris Yeltsin confirmed the agenda of the 
conference. The latter includes the issues of the 
implementation of the treaty on forming the economic union and 
those of military-political cooperation. Aside from these, the

  [Text] Tallinn April 7 TASS -- Estonian President Lennart 
Meri, State Assembly Chairman Ulo Nugis and Prime Minister Mart 
Laar signed on Thursday a statement saying: "At the 18th round 
of Russian-Estonian talks, which has just finished, the Russian 
side linked the deadline for complete withdrawal of Russian 
troops (August 31, 1994) to the conditions that had been already 
settled during previous rounds, thus casting doubt on the very 
deadline of troop withdrawal approved by the international 
community. 
  Estonia cannot agree to new terms, but is still ready to 
negotiate with Russia with a view to benevolently surmount all 
difficulties. However, the Estonian republic regards President 
Boris Yeltsin's order #174 of April 5, providing for creation of 
new military bases not only in CIS member-countries but also in 
the Latvian republic, as Russia's departure from its earlier 
commitments, as well as from international agreements and 
principles. 
  With this in view, the Estonian Foreign Ministry and 
Estonia's representatives abroad are instructed to do their 
utmost in persuading foreign leaders to recall Russia that it 
should unconditionally adhere to its international commitments 
and to pull out promptly and in the proper order its troops from 
Latvia and Estonia, which has been repeatedly called for by 
numerous international documents. 
  Unfortunately, certain political circles in Moscow are quite 
likely to use this situation to engineer provocations against 
Estonia and Latvia. But such attempts are doomed to failure. 
Estonia will resolutely counteract pressure from Russia. The 
Estonian people will go ahead with creating new values on its 
straight way back to Europe".

  [Text] Simferopol 7 April, TASS -- "Kiev continues to 
prevent us from tackling the economy in earnest and pushes for 
confrontation," Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov told a news 
conference in Simferopol on Thursday. 
  Speaking about his attitude towards Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk's decision to appoint his representative in the 
Crimea, Meshkov said "this happened at the most difficult stage 
of the establishment of the Crimea's statehood, on the eve of 
the elections to the parliament." 
  "But we will do everything possible in order that elections 
go off successfully on 10 April," he added. He said that the 
Crimea has lost Valeriy Gorbatov, who has been appointed 
Kravchuk's representative in the Crimea, as its citizen. 
  Meshkov also spoke about the results of his trip to Cyprus 
where he had reached an agreement to open a Cypriot trade office 
in the Crimea. Documents to this effect will be signed during 
Cypriot leaders' visit to the Crimea.

  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin will 
see doctors in Barcelona during his upcoming visit to Spain next 
week, but it is not clear whether the president wants to undergo 
a medical check-up or just thank the doctors who had cured him 
after an air accident in 1990. 
  Presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kosikov told reporters on 
Friday that Yeltsin will see the doctors who operated on his 
back hurt when the plane made an emergency landing. 
  "I cannot say whether it will be a consultation or a gesture 
of gratitude to them", Kostikov said. The doctors had examined 
the Russian president in Moscow last September. Kostikov said 
that in Barcelona Yeltsin also plans to visit Olympic sites.

<F P=106> [Europa Press report: "Barcelona Hospital Denies That </F>
Yeltsin Has Cirrhosis"] 
  [Text] Barcelona -- Barcelona Hospital medical director 
Carles Humet has stated that he has no evidence that Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin is suffering from cirrhosis of the 
liver, and added that although he will be coming to Barcelona on 
his coming official visit to Spain, he does not intend to 
undergo a medical checkup at that hospital. 
  Boris Yeltsin was twice treated for back pain by a medical 
team from that hospital -- first at the Barcelona Hospital and 
later in Moscow. Dr. Humet stated that he does not deem it 
necessary for Yeltsin to be given a medical checkup in 
Barcelona, "since the doctors treating him in Moscow are 
sufficiently competent." Humet added that "we know that he is 
coming to Barcelona, but there are no plans for him to have a 
medical checkup. He has not requested this, and we do not 
believe that it is necessary. Moreover, it makes no sense to 
plan a visit so far in advance." The doctor stressed: "We have 
been denying this (the checkup) for days. Now is not the time 
to start speculating whether or not he will come." 
  The Barcelona Hospital medical director added that Boris 
Yeltsin has asked to see personally some of the doctors who 
treated him, but not for medical reasons -- just out of 
friendship. 
  With respect to the reports published about the possibility 
that Yeltsin is suffering from cirrhosis of the liver, Humet 
said that "we have no evidence that he has cirrhosis. At least, 
the last time we visited him (in September 1993), he did not 
have cirrhosis." 
  Humet added that if Boris Yeltsin had any problem with his 
back or liver, "he would not wish to be treated in Barcelona, 
because greater publicity would be given to the matter here, and 
everybody would know about it. Moreover, he can be treated in 
Moscow with the same guarantees." 
  The first time that Boris Yeltsin was treated at the 
Barcelona Hospital was around three years ago, during a visit by 
the Russian president to Barcelona. Yeltsin felt unwell, and 
was taken to that hospital, where he underwent an operation for 
a slipped disk. The second occasion was in Moscow at the 
beginning of September 1993, when Yeltsin again felt discomfort 
and pain in the lumbar region, and was treated by the same 
medical team, which went to the Russian capital, although this 
time an operation was not necessary. 
  In addition, the Russian Consulate in Barcelona has neither 
confirmed nor denied the possibility that Boris Yeltsin will 
undergo a medical checkup in Barcelona.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Russian Federation President </F>
Boris Yeltsin by unidentified RIA-NOVOSTI correspondent, 
"especially for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA": "Boris Yeltsin: To 
Achieve Accord"] 
  [Text] Russia's President Boris Yeltsin has given an 
exclusive interview to an RIA-NOVOSTI correspondent: 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Boris Nikolayevich, how is the work on 
the Agreement progressing? 
  [Yeltsin] The work on the Agreement on Civil Peace is 
entering its final stage. Its concept, its basic provisions, 
and the mechanism for its implementation have been agreed. 
Representatives of diverse political streams have been 
participating in the document's preparation, and right from the 
very first stage at that. Representatives of State Duma 
factions are playing an active part. The draft has now been 
released to the mass media and each citizen can see it for 
himself. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] What, in your opinion, will our country 
gain from the signing of this Agreement? 
  [Yeltsin] First of all, it should mark Russia's entry in a 
period of political stability. 
  This is extremely important now. The situation in our 
country remains complex, and our own experience shows that it 
can be easily destabilized. We face a multitude of problems and 
we need to find a solution to each and every one of them, we 
need to find mutual understanding. If the Agreement 
materializes, we will acquire guidelines as to how this should 
be done. 
  Society will acquire clear-cut criteria to appraise the 
actions of all political forces, including the extremist forces. 
This will act as a powerful restraint on those who preach the 
principle of "all is allowed." 
  It is, of course, by no means easy to prepare a strong 
document -- which is exactly what Russia needs now. Especially 
in a country like ours, where the ideology of struggle dominated 
for many years on end. The importance of the work on the 
Agreement is that much greater. I will do everything to 
complete it so as to achieve accord in society. I will meet 
with various political forces, parliamentary factions and 
committees, and public figures primarily because the Agreement 
on Civil Peace is a condition governing the subsequent steps 
toward strengthening Russian statehood, as outlined in the 
Message. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] When do you think the Agreement will be 
ready? 
  [Yeltsin] I expect that the work will be finished by the end 
of April. It is scheduled for signing 28 April.

  [Text] On Wednesday the State Duma faction Russia's Choice 
and the unregistered deputies group Union of December 12 reached 
a preliminary agreement to coordinate their activity on issues 
submitted to the Federal Assembly's lower chamber for 
discussion, Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar reported to 
Interfax. In his words, they have reached the same preliminary 
agreement with the faction Yabloko. 
  Gaydar reported that during his meeting with the leader of 
the Union of December 12 group Boris Fedorov and other members 
of this deputies group they discussed the issue regarding 
"creation of a coordinating mechanism which would allow to 
coordinate their positions beforehand." The meeting of the 
Russia's Choice faction scheduled for Thursday, to quote Gaydar, 
will finally fix this agreement. Gaydar also pointed out that 
the representatives of the Union of December 12 group again 
raised the issue concerning rendering assistance to them with 
people. This issue concerns that fact that the Union of 
December 12 group needs six more people to be registered; now 
there are 29 members in the group instead of 35 in accordance 
with the State Duma's regulations. Gaydar believes that the 
Russia's Choice meeting will find a positive resolution to this 
issue. 
  Meanwhile, in his interview with Interfax leader of the 
Union 
of December 12, Fedorov, refuted Gaydar's assertion stating that 
members of the group asked him to help in staffing the group. 
"We raised the issue so that Russia's Choice did not hinder its 
members who expressed their wish to join the Union of December 
12 group by different means," stressed Fedorov. 
  Fedorov also pointed out that they had reached an agreement 
with Russia's Choice "to jointly discuss the tactics on the 
agenda of the State Duma "without any mutual obligations and 
without creation of any blocs or coalitions." He reaffirmed 
that such an agreement had been already reached with the Yabloko 
faction.

  [Text] A co-chairman of the All-Tatar Public Center (ATPC), 
Rashat Safin, told a news conference Thursday that the ATPC 
intended to launch a new stage of its struggle for the national 
liberation of the Tatar people and sovereignty of the Republic, 
following changes in the political situation inside Tatarstan 
such as the signing of a power-sharing treaty with Russia and 
the recent elections to the National Assembly. 
  The ATPC believes that the treaty runs counter to the Tatar 
Constitution, while the 13 March elections showed numerous 
violations of democratic principles and human rights. Under 
such circumstances, the ATPC will become a constructive 
opposition to join the political struggle for power. Until 
recently, the movement concentrated on developing a mechanism 
for consolidating the nation and stood aloof from the republic's 
internal problems. 
  According to Safin, Tatarstan took the moral lead in Russian 
reform as it struggled for the status of a member of a real 
federation. However, the treaty reiterated that Russia was a 
unitary state, and many republics had to follow suit, thus 
harming Russia as a whole. 
  Positively assessing the fact that such a treaty was signed, 
the movement pointed out that in fact the document secured the 
old relations between the center and a raw-material-producing 
appendage and did not envision equal rights. 
  The ATPC demanded that the Tatar Supreme Soviet assign 
international status to the treaty and hold parliamentary 
hearings on the issue. The movement insisted on the 
denunciation of intergovernmental economic agreements which 
enslave Tatarstan, according to the ATPC. 
  The movement said it had no confidence in Tatar President 
Mintimer Shaymiyev, Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev, Prime 
Minister Mukhammat Sabirov and the whole of government. The 
ATPC supported early parliamentary elections and changes in the 
personnel policy which was rife with nepotism.

  [Text] Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs declared that 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's order on creation of military 
bases on the territory of CIS states and Latvia makes conclusion 
of the Russian-Latvian agreement on troop withdrawal impossible. 
Birkavs declared this at a briefing staged after a special 
sitting of the Latvian Cabinet of Ministers on Wednesday in Riga 
which considered this order issued by Yeltsin. 
  As it was reported earlier a package of interstate 
agreements 
determining the date for troop withdrawal from Latvia, namely 
August 31, 1994 and several additional provisions, including the 
one concerning Russia holding on to the early-warning radar in 
Skrunda for 5.5 years, is being prepared now to be signed by 
Latvian and Russian presidents. At the briefing, Birkavs 
pointed out that the initialled agreements do not stipulate that 
this site would have the status of a military base. 
  The official statement of the Latvian Cabinet says that "the 
Latvian government has never agreed and will never agree to 
create Russian military bases on Latvian territory and to test 
new armaments and military equipment on its territory, it also 
rules out the possibility of any negotiations on these issues." 
  Birkavs added that the order of the Russian president 
appeared "under the influence of Russia's conservative circles 
whose goals coincide with the interests of Latvia's national 
radical circles -- to prevent conclusion of the Russian-Latvian 
treaty."

  [Text] Russian Ambassador in Latvia Aleksandr Rannikh 
extended in Riga Thursday Moscow's official apologies due to the 
"misunderstanding" around President Yeltsin's order to create 
military bases outside the Russian Federation. 
  Earlier the news media said that by his order Yeltsin backed 
the initiative by the Russian Defense Ministry on the creation 
of military bases in the CIS countries and Latvia. 
  Addressing on the same day a briefing in Riga, the Russian 
Ambassador admitted that there was "a technical mistake" which 
was detrimental to the Russian-Latvian relations and made 
difficult the political dialogue. 
  Rannikh said that he had doubt about the origin of the 
document. He said that the Russian Embassy in Riga did not 
receive the official report from Moscow that the document was 
signed and was in force. 
  He believes that Latvia's negative reaction to the document 
was caused by the tense situation caused by preparations being 
under way for the signing of the Latvian-Russian agreements on 
the Russian troop pull-out. 
  Rannikh also confirmed that all problems associated with the 
pull-out and the conditions of the temporary deployment and 
status of the radar station in Skrunda were solved and the 
documents were initialed by the chief negotiators of the two 
countries on March 15. 
  According to the agreement, the Russian radar in Skrunda is 
a 
Russian military facility which is under the civilian control 
and cannot be regarded as a military base.

  [Text] "Only the Latvian Republic can decided whose 
military bases can be stationed on its territory," says a 
message distributed by the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry on 
Wednesday evening after the publication of the Russian 
president's order on the creation of Russian military bases on 
the territories of CIS states and the Latvian Republic "to 
ensure security of the Russian Federation and the above 
mentioned states and to test new armaments and military 
equipment." 
  On April 6 a source in the Kremlin reported to Interfax that 
the wording about the creation of a military base in Latvia "is 
the result of an inappropriate phrase which was included into 
one of the documents of the Defense Ministry and then appeared 
in a corresponding order of the Russian president." 
  The message of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry underlined 
that "unilateral actions by Russia aimed at the creation of 
military bases in the Latvian Republic despite the will of this 
sovereign state contradicts the principles of international law 
and international obligations taken by Russia as a member of the 
UN and CSCE."

  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- Russia is getting ready to 
sign a framework document on its participation in NATO's 
Partnership for Peace [PFP] program after April 20, Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told member of the EC Commission 
Hans Van der Broek here today. 
  The documents are being finalized with due account of 
Russian 
peculiarities as a nuclear power. 
  The sides focused today on preparation of an agreement 
between Russia and the European Union. There are two problems 
to be solved. The first one, banks, has been settled at the 
experts' level. The other is more complicated as it concerns 
sales of nuclear fuel. Moscow is not satisfied with the quotas 
envisaged by the draft agreement. 
  The sides basically agree that it is time to finish 
preparations and sign the agreement.

joining the NATO Partnership for Peace [PFP] to joining the G-7 
group of industrial nations, presidency spokesman Viacheslav 
Kostikov said. 
  "If we are invited into the political and military

  [Text] Russia has granted Turkey's request to bring the 
annual volume of natural gas supplies up to 10.5 billion cubic 
meters by 1998. 2.5 billion cubic meters of this volume are to 
be used by the heat-and-power plant to be built in Turkey under 
Russian project. In addition, the two sides began to consider a 
project for building Turkey's first nuclear-power plant with 
Russia's direct participation. This might involve equipment 
supplies worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
  These and other issues concerning business cooperation 
between Russia and Turkey were discussed in detail at the 
session held on Tuesday and Wednesday in Moscow by the joint 
intergovernmental commission on trade and economic cooperation. 
The session was chaired by Russia's Minister for external 
economic relations, Oleg Davydov, and by the Turkish Minister 
for construction and population centers, Onur Kumbaracibasi. 
  The Turkish minister informed participants in the session of 
his country's willingness to increase the worth of its requests 
for the purchases of special property in Russia to 600 million 
dollars. However this can happen only if Russia agrees to supply 
Turkey with 260-million-dollar worth of helicopters and other 
military equipment to repay Russia's debt to Turkey which 
amounts to 320 million dollars. 
  As Interfax learned from a reliable source close to 
government circles, a tentative agreement on such supplies has 
been reached. However initially their volume will be somewhat 
lower -- 60 million dollars. 
  Participants in the session paid great attention to the ways 
to expand bilateral cooperation in the area of conversion, 
investment and power engineering. They noted with satisfaction 
that the turnover between the two countries grew rapidly and 
reached 2 billion dollars last year. 
  Speaking at the ceremony of signing the final documents, 
Russia's Minister for external economic relations, Oleg Davydov, 
said that in the current year the volume of Russian-Turkish 
trade may more than double and surpass the level reached in 
Russia's trade with the USA.

  [Text] Moscow April 9 (TASS) -- KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA 
publishes today an interview with Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev, who said: "If Rutskoy or Zhirinovskiy (former 
vice president of Russia and the leader of the Liberal 
Democratic Party) become president, Russia will not survive... 
I do not see any accord on this matter... What is the essence 
of it? Should we reach accord on observing the constitution? 
The whole nation voted for the constitution. But those who 
called for violence in Russia should be kept in prison. As long 
as Zhirinovskiy does not give up his openly fascist slogans, as 
long as Rutskoy does not give up hope for actually repeating in 
Russia the Yugoslav model, I shall never be in agreement with 
them." 
  ROSSIYSKIE VESTI carries an article by Anatoliy Sliva, 
deputy 
to the State Duma and chairman of the committee for local 
self-government. "Russia will be neither democratic, nor 
law-governed, nor social state, if we do not ensure real local 
self-government, real people's power... The complexity of the 
problem consists in the fact that it is in the focus of various 
interests, some of which contradict each other, including those 
which are hampering the formation of real self-government." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article, entitled "After 
Predicting the Establishment of a Dictatorial Regime, Alexey 
Kazannik Tenders Resignation for the Second Time." It analyses 
the reasons for that step, taken by the former 
prosecutor-general of Russia. The newspaper quotes an interview 
with Kazannik, the whole of which will be published in the next 
issue. He said: "After my dramatic resignation I saw for myself 
that President Boris Yeltsin needs a fully controllable, 
(?puppet) prosecutor-general, who will fulfil any, even illegal 
orders, and not only of the president, but also of some clerks 
from his administration." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA publishes an article about Russia's 
Middle East policy, which says: "Moscow's activity in the Middle 
East is described as one of the reasons for the correction of 
Washington's foreign political course. However, the Russian 
Foreign Ministry believes that the participation in the 
settlement of Middle East problems is the most natural thing for 
Russia, and refutes both accusations of the attempts to get 
political dividends and the element of competitiveness between 
Moscow and Washington in the Middle East." 
  "Russia has become a sort of Mecca for illegal migrants," 
Yuriy Arkhipov, head of the external migration department of the 
Federal Migration Service, said in an interview with 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. "From the legal point of view, it is not 
refugees who come to Russia, but people claiming the status of a 
refugee. They can get it only after a corresponding procedure, 
which presupposes an appeal to migration services. Foreigners 
who have not undergone that procedure cannot be regarded as 
refugees are are living on the territory of the country 
illegally. According to law-enforcement agencies, there are 
about half a million of immigrants from foreign countries, and 
their number continues to grow." 
  TRUD carries one more article about the causes of the crash 
of the A-310 plane near Novokuznetsk. "Valeriy Ekskuzyan, 
director-general of the Rossiyskie Avialinii air company, 
expressed disagreement with the preliminary conclusions of the 
government commission. He stressed that the commission's 
statement about the presence of third persons in the cabin is 
groundless. Some senior officials from the Russian Ministry of 
transport share his view. They say there is no indication to the 
incompetent operaration of the plane, which could cause its 
crash," the newspaper writes. 
  A decree of President Yeltsin and a corresponding order of 
the defence minister have actually given a new shape to the 
anti-aircraft defence troops: in the future they will become a 
basis for the creation of Russia's air and space defence, Air 
Force Colonel General Viktor Prudnikov, commander-in-chief of 
the anti-aircraft defence troops, said in an interview with 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA published today. This will be a natural thing 
to do, because the air and space defence spheres are so closely 
connected with each other that they have long been regarded as a 
single whole, Prudnikov said. The principle of the formation of 
the anti-aircraft defence system will also be changed. It will 
become entirely different and will be based on a territorial 
principle. Anti-aircraft defence zones and districts will be 
created within the time limit set by the defence minister. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with Vyacheslav 
Bulavkin, director-general of the Technomash production 
amalgamation, which is the chief enterprises in the sphere of 
rocket and space technologies. "Everyday life continually brings 
to my mind one and the same alarming thought: what will be the 
first to come -- the realisation by the government and the 
legislators of the importance of the Russian defence industry, 
in which an enormous scientific and technological potential is 
concentrated and millions of people are working, or a social 
explosion? Experiments should not be staged on a live 
organism..." 
  PRAVDA publishes an article by Valeriy Zorkin, ex-chairman 
of 
the Constitutional Court, who writes: "The efficiency of power 
itself is the most important problem today, because order 
cannot be restored in the country without it. Strict discipline 
in the state apparatus and the curbing of the corruption of 
bureaucrats should become the first steps towards an agreement 
on national harmony, towards the consent of society to the 
taking of anti-crisis measures by these very power structures 
... National harmony is possible only on the basis of changing 
a catastrophic course, imposed by radical `democrats'". Echoing 
Zorkin, Chairman of the Russian Christian Democratic Movement 
Viktor Aksyuchits said in an interview with PRAVDA: "Personal, 
group ambitions should not get an upper hand over common 
interest -- those of the nation and the state. In any case, a 
chance for reaching accord should not be missed." 
  The NEVSKOE VREMYA newspaper writes that cases of "housing 
racket" are becoming more frequent in St. Petersburg. As a 
rule, criminals steal keys, penetrate a flat and force its 
owners, using violence, to sign documents for unequal exchange 
or the sale of the apartment. The worsening of the crime 
situation in the country is influencing the situation in the 
armed forces, the St. Petersburg-based newspaper NA STRAZHE 
RODINY writes. It was reported at a session of the military 
council of the Leningrad military district that several attacks 
on sentries had taken place in the district during the past 
year. Several cases of stealing arms and ammunition and leaving 
one's unit without permission were also registered.

  [Excerpts] Moscow April 11 TASS -- Russian independent 
television analytical programme Itogi focussed on stabilisation 
of relations between the country's executive and legislative 
branches of power last week. 
  The fundamental meaning of the concept of national accord 
consists in establishing specific rules of the game between the 
political leaders represented in the bodies of state authority. 
The short-term aim is to reach stabilisation of relations 
between the president and the two chambers of the parliament. 
The latest clash between the two branches of power occurred 
over the Federation Council's decision not to release Aleksey 
Kazannik of his duties as Russia's chief prosecutor, as decreed 
by Yeltsin earlier. The results of the vote on the decree 
revealed that for the first time since it was established, the 
Federation Council declared its independent role, dispelling the 
image of a pro-president chamber, the Itogi host said. Some 
people regarded the incident as another clash between the 
legislature and the executive. The president's representative 
in the chamber Aleksandr Yakovlev expressed the hope that the 
upper chamber would return to the question again, and Aleksey 
Ilyushenko will remain the acting chief prosecutor until then. 
  Commenting on the situation, the presidential aide Grigoriy 
Satarov said in an interview with Itogi that many 
interpretations were prompted by political concerns. The 
vestiges of the old confrontation between the president and his 
extreme opponents were instrumental in this case, he said. A 
small part of the political forces is not interested in 
political and economic stabilisation which would be a poor 
background for them in the forthcoming elections. In appraising 
the chances of the parliament's approval of the presidential 
draft accord on civic peace in Russia, Grigoriy Satarov said the 
chances are fairly high and he did not see any serious obstacles 
to the approval of the document before the proposed deadline, 
April 28. [passage omitted] 
  Itogi interviewed lower chamber speaker Ivan Rybkin, an 
ardent supporter of the national conciliation concept. As 
concerns the approval of the presidential call for peace and 
concord in society, Ivan Rybkin stressed that there are forces 
in the Duma which can rally in order to achieve peace, concord 
and success of reforms. About his own political future, Ivan 
Rybkin declared he had never thought about running in the 
presidential elections in 1996. "But when I see many of those 
who nominate themselves for presidency, I know firmly after many 
years here that it is a heavy burden to bear and I understand 
that many of them will be simply crushed by this burden, the 
presidential duties, in the very first days. They should be 
more circumspecting and abstain from such actions the burden is 
too heavy and it is not for every man to bear". The realisation 
of the idea of national concord presupposes a definite 
representation of all major political forces of Russia in the 
parliament, the host said. Paradoxically, the radical 
reformers, who controlled much of the power in Russia until 
recently are probably experiencing the most difficulties in the 
State Duma. Last week the Russia's Choice coalition lost one of 
its leading figures -- Gennadiy Burbulis left the ranks of the 
faction of which he was one of the founding fathers. Burbulis 
said in this connection that the country has radically changed 
lately and Russian society needs new political approaches, and 
added that he was planning to create a new political party for 
representatives of the private capital, who were not welcomed to 
Russia's Choice. 
  Commenting on the promotion of the presidium leader Sergey 
Shakhray to vice-premiership, Itogi stressed that Shakhray's 
party, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, now has two 
vice-premiers in the government, more than any other political 
coalition. [passage omitted]

"Belorussia's Foreign Ministry Asks UN Secretary General for 
Support. Minsk Worried at Position of Ethnic Minority in Latvia 
and Estonia"] 
  [Text] Before UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's visit, 
which ended 7 April, Belarus authorities preferred to solve 
bilaterally the problems of ethnic Belarusians finding 
themselves outside their own country, and scored certain 
successes in that. 
  For example, agreements with Lithuania, where the Belarusian 
community is especially large, are already working: national 
schools have been opened in Vilnius and in a Belarusian village 
there. The Belarusian language is now heard on Lithuanian 
radio, and a Belarusian newspaper appears in Lithuania's 
capital. The interests of Lithuanians who live in Belarus are 
being served in a similar way. 
  The problems of Belarusians in Latvia, and especially in 
Estonia, have a somewhat different nature. The matter is that 
the Slavic population along Lithuania's southeastern border has 
been there for centuries and has preserved its culture and 
language. Lithuanian Belarusians had no problem acquiring 
citizenship. Latvia and Estonia are a different matter. There, 
Belarusians encounter the same difficulties as do all 
non-Latvians and non-Estonians. 
  Until recently, the Belarus side had been trying to resolve 
the arising difficulties through bilateral talks, in particular 
during the recent visit to Minsk by Latvian Prime Minister 
Birkans. All the more unexpected was the news heard from 
Foreign Minister Petr Kravchenko that, during his discussions 
with Mr. Butrus-Ghali, considerable attention was devoted to the 
topic of the Belarusian ethnic minority in Baltic countries. 
The UN leader promised cooperation in solving this problem and 
voiced the intention to send, at Belarus' request, a special UN 
human rights mission to the Baltic countries. 
  Local observers think in this connection that such an 
initiative of Minsk officials is the result of private 
"consultations" held by Belarus diplomats with their Russian 
counterparts.

  [Text] The Chief of the National Security Agency under the 
Belarussian [Belarusian] government Major-General Valeriy Pavlov 
told INTERFAX Minsk had not yet voiced its view of the Russian 
plans to build bases in Commonwealth republics. 
  But, Pavlov said the deployment of strategic units of a 
foreign army in Belarus was out of question as it would 
contradict the Belarussian decision to be a neutral and 
nuclear-free country. 
  In Pavlov's view, the deployment in Belarus of Russian air 
bases or antiaircraft units would keep Belarussian armymen in 
good shape. The Belarussians would familiarize with advanced 
know-how and be able to resolve their social problems. 
  According to Pavlov, Minsk would study in detail every 
scenario for the creation of foreign army bases in Belarus.

  [Text] Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich did not 
rule out the possibility that Belarusians would be polled on 
economic integration with Russia on 23 June when the 
presidential elections are held. 
  In an exclusive INTERFAX interview in Minsk Friday Kebich 
said that he had initially proposed such a move at the meeting 
of the government presidium Tuesday, 5 April and the idea was 
supported by all cabinet members. 
  Kebich said that, according to sociological research, an 
absolute majority of Belarusian citizens supported a union with 
Russia. 
  Kebich said that Belarus was a stable country and the 
economic union treaty that had been ratified by parliament 
contributed to the stability. He thought, however, that a poll 
would indirectly enhance the long-term stability of that treaty, 
whatever the political situation in the country.

  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau], 8 Apr -- Moldovan Prime 
Minister Andrei Sangheli has stated that his country intends to 
participate only in economic cooperation within the context of 
the CIS, and therefore has not signed any agreements relating to 
military-political cooperation. 
  At a news conference in Kishinev today, the head of the 
Cabinet of Ministers rejected the view that following the 
Moldavan Parliament's ratification today of the agreements 
signed by President Mircea Snegur on joining the CIS and the 
economic union, rivers of gas will flow into the Republic from 
Russia. We advocate equal cooperation with all countries. No 
one is giving us anything for nothing today, either from Russia 
or from Romania, the prime minister stressed. 
  Cooperation within the CIS and the economic union, in his 
view, make it possible to put on a civilized level the close 
ties between the former union republics, and to avoid the hard 
knocks caused when they were unjustifiably broken.

  During the meeting they examined a number of issues related 
to the resuming of negotiations intended to establish the 
juridical status of the Dniester region under the new 
sociopolitical circumstances. 
  The parties reached the conclusion that the process of 
negotiations will be mediated by the CSCE missions, as well as 
those of the Russian Federation. They agreed to bolster mutual 
activity intended to reestablish ties and cooperation in all 
domains of economic life. They also discussed other problems 
currently hindering the normal progress of negotiations.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 7/4/1994 -- "The time of 
unfounded promises and declarations and political confrontation 
that split up the precedent governments has gone," stated today 
President Mircea Snegur during the first session of the new 
Moldovan Government. He mentioned that Moldova is in a very 
complicated situation which is decisive for the future of the 
reforms. The president insisted on the need to stop the 
economic decline, to stabilize the situation and to lay the 
foundation for the economic take-off that would lead to the 
consolidation of the statehood. Snegur emphasized that the 
reorganization of the ministries and departments [words 
indistinct] and promoted with consistency according to the 
Memorandum signed with the IMF. Referring to the activity 
program of the new Government, Premier Andrei Sangheli inferred 
weight to the social protection and in particular medical care. 
The government examined and proposed for parliamentary debates 
the draft decision on ratifying the agreement "Regarding the 
Creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States" with the 
amendments imposed by the Moldovan legislation and the treaty 
"Regarding the Creation of the Economic Union." Vice-Premier 
Valentin Cunev mentioned that amendments to the agreement have 
to do with preserving Moldova's independence, meaning that 
Moldova will not adhere to military agreements, creation of a 
joint army and ruble zone.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 9/4/1994 -- The Moldovan 
Parliament ratified on 8 April 1994, with a majority of votes 
(80 pros and 18 cons) the Agreement on Creating the CIS and the 
Agreement on Creating the CIS Economic Union. [Parliament 
Speaker] Petru Lucinschi proposed to examine this issue 
reminding that these agreements were examined by the former 
parliament and that only 4 votes lacked to their ratification. 
That is why the former parliamentary presidium took into 
account all economic problems and restrictions caused by Russia 
and asked the president to sign all the agreements of joining 
the CIS and CIS Economic Union to Moldova's benefit. A number 
of 17 deputies have opposed on 8 April the proposal to examine 
the agreements. The faction of Peasants and Intellectuals 
noticed that the parliamentary regulations are violated. 
According to it, the documents to be adopted have to be 
presented three days beforehand for their examination. PDAM 
[Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova -- ruling party] 
representatives and in particular Andrei Diaconu, retorted that 
the problem is well known and was examined on August 4th, and 
therefore it would not be reasonable to start a new discussion. 
Valeriu Matei, from the faction of Peasants and Intellectuals, 
stated that the documents have a series of stipulations 
contradicting Moldova's current policy and several legislative 
documents. Dumitru Motpan, PDAM leader and vice speaker of 
parliament, replied that the commissions that should ensure the 
fulfillment of the regulations is only being created. He said 
that this problem had been examined for two years and the delay 
in ratifying the CIS agreements would represent a blockage. 
Dumitru Diacov presented the notification of the Parliamentary 
Commission of Foreign Relations regarding these documents. He 
argued that Moldova should join the CIS and mentioned that seven 
of the nine members of the commission were in favor of 
ratification, while the other two representing the FPCDM 
[Christian- Democratic Popular Front -- opposition] Alliance 
and the Bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals opposed it. Premier 
Andrei Sangheli made a report noting that the CIS agreements 
should be ratified as soon as possible. He added that after the 
former parliament rejected them, serious damage was caused to 
Moldovan economy. In 1993, this sum amounted to 40 billion 
rubles. Sangheli asserted that the government in its 7 April 
session agreed to the ratification of the CIS agreements. 
During the debates, Vlad Clubreacov, from the FPCDM faction, 
mentioned "the disastrous economic consequences of ratifying the 
CIS agreements and the danger to which Moldova's independence is 
unjustifiably exposed." He said that "it is strictly necessary 
that beside the two agreements presented to us, we should have 
at our disposal over 200 agreements signed by Moldovan 
officials. The agreements are only partial and insufficient 
information, which disguise the real purposes of the previous 
agreements." Vasile Nedelciuc, faction of Peasants and 
Intellectuals, analyzed several economic articles of the 
agreements. He pointed out that Moldova has other alternatives, 
including the ones in the West, which could help overcome the 
current difficulties. He said that joining the CIS would 
negatively influence many areas. One of the consequences is 
that the legislation must be adjusted to the conditions of the 
CIS economic community. Speaker Petru Lucinschi said that the 
decision to join the CIS is not made forever and with new 
realities coming in power it could be revised. At present, when 
there is no other alternative but the Eastern market, parliament 
welcomes the adherence to the CIS.

  [Text] State Secretary of the self-proclaimed 
Transdniestrian Republic, Valeriy Litskay, was satisfied with 
the fact that the Moldovan parliament had ratified the agreement 
within the scope of the CIS and the Economic Union. He 
suggested in an interview with INTERFAX that this would help 
renew the talks between Kishinev [Chisinau] and Tiraspol at a 
completely new level. 
  The Gagauz leaders shared this opinion. They approved of the 
ratification of the agreement by the Moldovan parliament at the 
session of the Gagauz parliament in Kamrat today. 
  President of the self-proclaimed Gagauz Republic, Stepan 
Topal, said in an interview with INTERFAX on the telephone that 
the Gagauz leaders had been seeking ratification of these 
documents for the last two years. He suggested that the 
Agrarian Democratic Party and the Socialist party currently in 
power in Moldova and their moves, including the agreement's 
ratification, had laid a good foundation for the renewal of the 
Moldovan-Gagauz talks at a new level. 
  The Gagauz parliament approved the activities by the 
commission for renewal of the talks with Kishinev on the status 
of the regions with a largely Gagauz population and recommended 
that the commission work even more energetically.

<F P=106> [Report by Svetlana Gamova: "Opposition Calls Moldavia's </F>
New Government Pro-Moscow"] 
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] -- Some 3 percent of the 
Republic's budget has annually been spent on 6,000 state 
officials. Moldavia's [Moldova's] Agrarian Democratic Party, 
which forms the government, considered it costly for the small 
state to have 20 ministries and 10 state departments with overly 
inflated staffs. The state apparatus is being cut by 40 percent. 
  Two departments have been crossed off the list, including 
the 
department dealing with the functioning of the state language -- 
the only one of its kind in the CIS. 
  For the People's Front opposition this means that it is 
totally excluded from state structures. Andrei Sangheli is 
still prime minister. He enjoys prestige among the population 
of the Left Bank and the south of the Republic, and is also well 
received in Russian Government offices. 
  The 16 confirmed ministers include only one "interloper" -- 
Vasile Iovv [surname as transliterated], former trade 
representative in Russia, who made it on the Socialist Party 
lists. The other ministers are either members of the Agrarian 
Party or have sworn loyalty to it. 
  Foreign Minister Mihai Popov, a graduate of the Diplomatic 
Academy, worked in the former USSR Embassy in Bucharest. He was 
recently ambassador to Belgium. The nationalist newspaper TSARA 
[name as transliterated] saw the appointment of the new head of 
the foreign policy department as Moscow's doing and KGB 
intrigue, forecasting a switch from the Moldavian Foreign 
Ministry's former "European orientation" to a patently 
pro-Moscow orientation. It is being said in parliamentary 
lobbies that the new minister is Parliament Speaker Petru 
Lucinschi's minion; Lucinschi knows him from working with him 
for several years. 
  The People's Front, considering the new membership of the 
government to be pro-Moscow, refused to take part in the ballot, 
but that had no effect on the result: The list of Cabinet 
members was passed, and with the current disposition of forces 
(20 opposition votes to 84) it is quite possible to predict the 
same outcome for parliamentary decisions in the future.

  [Text] Talking to the leader of the CSCE Moldovan mission 
Richard Samuel in Kishinev [Chisinau], Moldovan President Mircea 
Snegur pointed to the need for continued CSCE activities in his 
republic. 
  According to Snegur, Kishinev [Chisinau] and Tiraspol based 
dialog on the CSCE Moldovan mission's advice for stability in 
Transdniestria. 
  The multi-party elections of 27 March, said Snegur, and the 
victory, in the elections, of a centrist-oriented party, made 
the solution of the Transdniestrian problem possible. 
  Snegur and Richard Samuel met in the runup to next week's 
session of the CSCE's standing council which is to concentrate 
on the extension of the Moldovan mission's mandate.

  [Text] Moldovan Deputy Defense Minister Brigadier General 
Tudor Dabija told INTERFAX that Russia would never be allowed to 
have army bases in Moldova. In Dabija's view, Yeltsin's decision 
to create army bases in Commonwealth republics was out of 
keeping with the Moldovan military doctrine. 
  The Moldovan and Russian military could negotiate only one 
issue, Dabija said, the full withdrawal of Russia's 14th Army 
from Moldovan soil. 
  On 7 April, however, the eighth round of Russian-Moldovan 
negotiations was held in Kishinev [Chisinau]. A draft agreement 
was initialled on the legal status and reciprocal legal aid in 
cases related to the temporary presence of Russian Army units on 
Moldovan territory. 
  The Moldovan and Russian delegations signed a few other 
documents to decide how they would schedule Russian troop 
withdrawal and the removal of Russian army property from Moldova. 
  They failed to agree on deadlines for the Russian troop 
withdrawal, but agreed to meet again in May.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 9/4/1994 -- "We made a big 
mistake to believe in the summer of 1992 that the new 14th 
[Russian] Army commander [General Aleksandr Lebed] is a man who 
realizes the situation in the Republic," stated to magazine 
KOMMERSANT MOLDOVIY (BUSINESSMAN OF MOLDOVA) Vadim Shevtsov, 
chairman of the Dniester Republic's Security Committee. 
According to Shevtsov, Lebed is carrying out a task assigned to 
him by certain Russian political groups. He mentioned that 
Lebed did not stop the military conflict, but rather kept the 
14th Army in barracks in a moment when he was most likely to 
take the Dniester side. "At first we had good relations with 
Lebed," stated Shevtsov, "but I gave them up when he proposed to 
me to take part in the dismissal of the [Dniester] government." 
He did not consider the Lebed-Bergman opposition to be a 
serious threat, but he called it destructive. In connection 
with the 14th Army's withdrawal Shevtsov said that if it takes 
place then "merely the army's general staff will leave the 
Dniester region taking its flag." Shevtsov also stated that 
after the PDAM [Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova -- ruling 
party] won the elections "the reunification of the [Dniester 
River] right and left banks" is likely to occur. "The 
proclamation of our Republic was not a goal in itself, but 
rather a strong need. In case it loses its actuality there will 
be no longer need for it. Life itself will make us be 
together." Moldova should provide strong guarantees established 
by the Constitution, said Shevtsov.

  [Text] Tokyo 8 April, TASS -- The West "should help Russia 
in the process of reforms, democratisation and stabilisation, 
nor for remarks by concrete politicians," President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan told a news conference here on Friday. 
[sentence as received] 
  Both Moscow and all its neighbours in the east and west are 
interested in the success of Russian transformations, emphasised 
Nazarbayev, who is currentlty in Japan on an official visit. 
  Nazarbayev believes that there is nothing surprising in the 
complex processes taking place in the former Soviet Union. The 
majority of current problems have been brought about by the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union's economic system and 
break-up of the common ruble area, and should have been foreseen 
by politicians who were busy producing a Commonwealth of 
Independent States in Belovezhskaya Pushcha forest, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo 8 April, KAZTAG-TASS -- Kazakhstan's President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev announced today that his words about the 
creation of a Euro-Asian community similar to the European Union 
to replace the former Soviet Union was "just an idea aired and 
not a formal official proposal." 
  He was responding to a question from ITAR-TASS and KAZTAG 
correspondent at a press conference devoted to the results of 
his visit to Japan. 
  Nonetheless the president said he would works towards the 
materialization of his idea. 
  Nazarbayev said he had always been of the opinion that the 
present structure of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a 
supra-state within the framework of the dissolved Soviet Union 
is not exactly what is needed. At a meeting with Moscow 
University students during his recent visit to Russia he "voiced 
the idea deliberately." 
  "I now watch with interest the reaction of the leaders of 
the 
commonwealth member countries to my initiative," he said. 
  Nazarbayev did not say whether he is going to raise the 
question about the Euro-Asian union at the forthcoming 
commonwealth summit.

<F P=106> [From the SNARK "Press Digest"] </F>
  [Text] Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev's idea 
about the Eurasian Union is published in "GA" [GOLOS ARMENII] 
under the heading "In Big-Policy Corridors". 
  In the authors' opinion, Boris Yeltsin accepts "coolly" the 
idea and "will never come forward with integrational banner." 
  Democrats stand behind Yeltsin, write the authors, are "the 
pragmatic people who do not conceal their view that Russia needs 
no poor relatives, while the former Soviet republics...only in a 
few years were ruined to such an extent that they reached and 
overrun in that sense many African states". 
  Ambiguous situation has been created when Yeltsin does not 
explicitly support Nazarbayev's idea, meanwhile, there may hide 
much danger in such a passivity. 
  It is this very ambiguity that creates the situation today 
when Russia on one hand stands as a leader of at least economic 
union reconstruction, while on the other hand no particular 
steps are made in this direction. Should however one other 
republic make conclusions from this tendency and try to solve 
its own destiny, Russia will immediately raise the brows and 
undertake the measures to punish the guilty, write "GA" analysts. 
  With reference to certain observers' opinion "GA" claims 
that even if the integrational processes go more intensively, 
one may speak at a first phase only of three Slavic states' 
union, plus possibly Kazakhstan. The paper observes that 
Nazarbayev's idea was as yet backed only by Kyrgyzstan, and the 
leaders of Transcaucasus preferred not to appear on that topic.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Golovnin] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, 8 Apr -- Kazakhstan President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev today said he was most concerned that there was a 
danger that the Russian population might leave the country. 
  Replying to questions at a news conference in Tokyo, he said 
Kazakhstan does not have a refugees' problem yet. However, 
Nazarbayev said, "collapse of empires never goes quietly," and 
people are concerned since they can see bloodshed in Tajikistan 
and the Caucasus. Politicians, he said, should have foreseen 
this when they were signing the Belovezhskaya Pushcha agreement 
and when "against our will, the ruble zone was being destroyed." 
  An economic crisis can be observed throughout the former 
USSR 
at present, the quality of life worsens, and on the eve of the 
elections on 12 December many politicians had nothing better to 
do than "to use the Russian theme since there was nothing else 
they could talk about." However, concern for common people and 
politicizing are different matters, the president stressed. 
  The Russian-speaking population in Kazakhstan enjoys all the 
rights and even have opportunities not available in other 
countries on the territory of the former USSR. "Russians, 
Germans, and Ukrainians are our citizens, citizens of 
Kazakhstan, and I know it will be worse for them if they leave," 
Nazarbayev said.

  [Text] Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev has 
completed his visit to Japan. The main purpose of the visit was 
to obtain prearranged credits and to sell his country's 
resources to business circles. In his opinion, this has been 
achieved. As he told ITAR-TASS on his arrival on 6 April, 
Alma-Ata [Almaty] did not set any other tasks. Calling for 
cooperation in the future, Nursultan Nazarbayev, well known for 
his passion for hunting, realized that a bird in the hand is 
worth two in the bush. That is why the securing of Japanese 
promises on credits for $220 million in aid of reforms and 12.88 
trillion yen for the development of the infrastructure were 
described as the main successes of the visit.

  [Text] Kazakhstan's Deputy Foreign Minister Bulat 
Nurgaliyev told INTERFAX that the Kazakh-Russian treaty on 
friendship, cooperation and reciprocal aid, signed on 23 May 
1992, made it possible for Russia to use army bases in 
Kazakhstan and for Kazakhstan -- to use army bases in Russia. 
  According to Nurgaliyev, Article 4 of the Russian-Kazakh 
treaty provides for the joint use, in mutual interests and on 
mutual agreement, of army bases, shooting ranges and other 
defensive facilities on their territories, as well as the use of 
defensive facilities on each other's territory. 
  Now that it was ratified by both the Kazakh and Russian 
legislatures, the treaty prevailed over the national 
legislations. Nurgaliyev felt there was nothing new or 
controversial in Yeltsin's order on Russian military bases 
outside Russia. 
  Nurgaliyev failed to see as unacceptable long-term strategic 
deployment of units under the Russian flag in Kazakhstan. If no 
Russian troops remained on Kazakh territory, he said, it would 
be more difficult for his republic to keep up its defensive 
potential. 
  In Nurgaliyev's view, Kazakhstan and Russia shared strategic 
interests in the field of defense and agreement would soon be 
reached on the Sary-Shagan and Emba missile ranges (near the 
Balkhash lake and the city of Aktyubinsk, respectively).

head of the refugees affairs department of the Tajik Ministry of 
Labor and Employment, told the Khovar news agency that he and 
Deputy Foreign Minister Mirzoyev represented Tajikistan at the 
talks. Also present were Zainulobiddinov, consul of the Russian 
Federation in Mazar-e Sharif, Afghanistan; (?Irgachev),

  Participants in the talks unanimously decided that the

and political situation in Tajikistan is returning to normal and 
that refugees can return to their permanent places of residence 
without any problems. 
  The UNHCR representative at the talks said that Tajik 
refugees returning home from the Sakhi camp are being given 
three months of food rations. The same humanitarian assistance 
applies to refugees who returning home from Konduz Province in 
Afghanistan.

  [Text] Dushanbe April 7 TASS -- The Russian frontier check 
point Nizhnyy Pyandzh, through which refugees were coming from 
Afghanistan, was brought under missile fire at 09.20 [0520 GMT] 
today from the Afghan territory. 
  According to Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin, 
commander 
of the frontier guard troops in Tajikistan, the fire came from a 
suburb of the port of Sherkhan-Bender, where some 1,000 Tajiks 
are concentrated. Missiles were fired from the control zone of 
the 54th and 55th Infantry Divisions of Afghanistan under the 
command of Kazi Kabir and Amir Chugai. 
  No casualties were reported. One of the missiles exploded 50 
metres away from the check point. 
  Russian frontier guards did not open reply fire and did not 
respond to the provocation. According to General Chechulin, 
"The purpose of the action was to force us to open reply fire at 
the refugee bases and disrupt talks between the Tajik 
authorities and the opposition in Moscow." 
  Reinforcement -- more artillery pieces and tanks -- came to 
the check point.

  [Text] Continuing provocations at the Tajik-Afghan border 
are aimed at frustrating the inter-Tajik talks being held in 
Moscow. The statement was made by the chief of the information 
department of the Tajik Foreign Ministry Zafar Saidov at a 
briefing in Dushanbe. 
  He believes that the process of the return of Tajik refugees 
to their homeland is becoming steady. However, this does not 
suit the interests of the armed Tajik opposition and its 
militants are trying to frustrate the process. Saidov said that 
the check point of the Russian border guard troops, was shelled 
in the morning of April 7, from the vicinity of the port of 
Sherkhan (Afghanistan) where about 700 refugees are amassed 
waiting to return to their homeland. 
  Saidov said that the Russian border guards showed restraint 
and did not retaliate. This is another manifestation of who 
wants to restore peace in Tajikistan and who does not, he added.

  [Text] Tajikistan has sent an official note to Afghanistan 
demanding that the recent incidents on the Tajik-Afghan border 
be investigated and the responsible be punished, a highly placed 
official in the Tajik Foreign Ministry, Zafar Saydov, said at a 
briefing in Dushanbe on Friday. 
  Saydov told journalists about the artillery shooting against 
the Russian border post in the Khatlon Region from Afghan 
territory on April 7. Moreover, he added that a Russian armored 
carrier had been blown up by an anti-tank mine. A border 
officer had been killed. 
  Saydov said he had reliable information proving that these 
actions had been planned before hand and had been carried out 
from Afghan territory. Over the first three months of this year 
several facilities, including the Russian border defenses have 
been subjected to fire from Afghan territory over forty times. 
Casualties and significant material damage have been reported. 
  The Tajik Foreign Ministry's note demanded that appropriate 
strict measures be used against illegal Tajik armed units acting 
on Afghan territory in order to halt their activities, Saydov 
stressed.

  [Text] Dushanbe, April 11 (AFP)--Gunmen using submachine 
guns fired Monday on the home here of Tajikistan's Foreign 
Minister Rashid Alimov, who is away in Moscow negotiating with 
the Central Asian state's Islamic-based opposition, authorities 
said. They said security forces cordoned off the district after 
the attack that did not claim any victims. 
  A senior ministry official said the minister had good reason 
to be concerned about safety, since influential sectors of the 
neo-communist regime objected to the parley with the opposition. 
Alimov was foremost among government members in following up a 
Russian suggestion for peace talks with the opposition, which 
has mounted raids from neighbouring Afghanistan since the 
neo-communist takeover in 1992. 
  Victims of the raids have included Tajikistan's deputy prime 
minister Muzabsho Nazarshoyev who was killed here March 11 and 
Alimov's brother-in-law who was murdered in January.

  [Text] Turkmenistan stopped the supply of its gas to 
Azerbaijan as of 10:00 of April 7. Until that time the rate of 
supply was 8 Mn cubic meters a day. Officials of the Azerigaz 
state-owned company told Interfax that the cause was that 
Azerbaijan had not pay the $50 Mn it owed for supplies in the 
first quarter of the year. That amount had to be paid with oil 
products, machinery and consumer goods. The Azeri government 
has not, however, set the export quotas. 
  Turkmenistan was supposed to supply to Azerbaijan 3 Bn cubic 
meters of gas evaluated as $240 Mn. Since the beginning of the 
year 956 Mn cubic meters have been supplied and partly paid for 
in kind.

  [Text] Ashgabat, 11 April -- Turkmenistan has partially 
resumed the supply of gas to Azerbaijan in response to 
assurances from the Azerbaijani side that supplies of petroleum 
products, equipment for oilfields, and engineering products to 
Turkmenistan - envisaged under an agreement between the two 
countries - will be resumed within a ten-day period. 
  To date, Azerbaijan owes Turkmenistan 74 million dollars for 
gas supplies and is now being forced to take urgent steps to 
avoid the economic sanctions stipulated in the 
inter-governmental agreement.

  [Text] Russia is ready to initiate the lifting of 
international sanctions against former Yugoslavia after a 
settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina is signed, Political 
Advisor of the Russian Foreign Minister, Galina Sidorova told 
Interfax. Sidorova said Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
had met Chairman of the parliament of the United Republic of 
Yugoslavia, Radoman Bozovic, today in Moscow and had made 
Moscow's position known. "The sanctions were imposed due to the 
specific situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the situation 
changes, the need for sanctions disappears," Sidorova said. 
  Sidorova suggested that this new opportunity must be used to 
settle the conflict in ex-Yugoslavia. She believes that the 
Serbs should participate in the agreement recently signed by 
Bosnian Moslems and Croats. "Russia will agree with any 
decision acceptable for all Bosnian parties. However, it is 
obvious that no settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina will work 
without the participation of the Serbs." She spoke for an 
urgent agreement on a cease-fire between Bosnian Serbs and 
Moslems at the talks begun today in Sarajevo. "The sooner it 
happens, the more chances there will be for the success of the 
political dialogue," Sidorova stressed. 
  Bozovic emphasized the important role of the Russian 
diplomacy on Balkans. He said the recent positive changes were 
due to Russia's activities. Bozovic stressed that he had met 
many Russian parliamentarians representing different political 
blocs and factions. Practically all of them spoke for lifting 
sanctions against Belgrade. These sanctions are 
counter-productive and can only do harm, Bozovic said.

<F P=106> [Report by RIA-Novosti correspondent Sergey Gryzunov] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] We have learned from 
well-informed diplomatic sources that Russia repeatedly warned 
the Bosnian Serb leadership about the danger of stepping up 
their activities in eastern Bosnia. The last of these warnings 
was made just a few hours before the air strike. In response, 
the Russian embassy in Belgrade received firm promises that 
there would be no aggravation of the situation. But literally a 
few hours later Serb detachments mounted an offensive on Gorazde 
and occupied its southern part. As a result, the airplanes were 
forced to intervene after the lives of UN observers came under 
threat. [passage omitted] 
  After Russian diplomacy averted the bombing of Serb 
positions 
in Sarajevo, a dangerous confidence in their own impunity 
manifested itself among the Bosnian Serb leaders, generals, and 
soldiers. The withdrawal of heavy weapons was presented by 
local propaganda as a Serb victory, and the fact that NATO did 
not mount air strikes was seen as a sign of weakness and 
hesitation. But now the Rubicon has been crossed. A 
fundamentally new situation has arisen, in which the Russian 
president's special envoy Vitaliy Churkin will have to use all 
his influence and skill to continue his peace-brokering mission 
and the talks. 
  He has now begun a meeting with Serb President Slobodan 
Milosevic, during which Moscow's views on what happened in 
eastern Bosnia will probably be set forth.

  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- Russian leftist leader Sergey 
Baburin said on Friday that sanctions against Yugoslavia should 
be scrapped. Baburin, a rather influential member of the current 
and last parliaments, leader of the pro-Communist Russian 
National Union, was speaking to reporters after his return from 
Sarajevo, Belgrade and serb Krajina. 
  "It is necessary to boost the efforts of the Russian 
Government, parliament and Foreign Ministry to lift the U.N. 
sanctions against the Union Republic of Yugoslavia and fight for 
a halt to Russia's participation in these sanctions", Baburin 
said, adding that Russia should become more active with its 
humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). 
  Baburin backed the idea of sending more Russian 
peace-keepers 
to Sarajevo, but rejected the idea of sending Turkish units to 
the conflict zone under the aegis of the United Nations. "There 
is a threat of Islamic domination, even of a rebirth of 
fundamentalism (in the Balkans)", he noted.

  [Text] A group of Russian deputies who have just returned 
from a trip to Yugoslavia intends to seek changes in the 
procedure for delivering humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia even 
before the economic sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro are 
lifted. The deputies demanded that the permission required to 
deliver aid be replaced with a simple notice of delivery. This 
statement was made by the leader of the deputies' group Russian 
Way, Sergey Baburin, at a news conference Friday. The 
delegation included mostly deputies from the Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia, Agrarian Party, Russian Communist Party and 
groups Russian Way and New Regional Policy. 
  Baburin pointed out that changing the procedure for 
delivering humanitarian aid would enable Russia to intensify aid 
to the people of Serbia without waiting for the lifting of the 
sanctions. In their statement, the deputies pointed to the need 
to intensify the activities of the Russian government and the 
parliament to lift U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia. 
  As has already been reported, the issue was included in the 
agenda of the State Duma's session this week. It was proposed 
to recommend to the Russian president and government to decide 
on Russia's participation in the sanctions, boost humanitarian 
aid to Yugoslavia, including oil and gas supplies, and intensify 
bilateral economic cooperation. 
  Deputy Viktor Veshnyakov of the Liberal Democratic Party 
faction supposed Russia should be ready to enter the Yugoslav 
market, including that of defense systems, immediately after the 
sanctions are lifted.

  [Text] Moscow, 11 Apr -- The Russian Federation servicemen 
carrying out peacekeeping tasks in the Sarajevo area suffered no 
injuries in the air raids by two NATO bombers that on the 
evening of 10 April carried out strikes against Serb positions 
near the Bosnian town of Gorazde. Colonel-General Yevgeniy 
Podkolzin, commander of the air assault troops, informed the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent of this today, citing the morning report 
from commanders of both peacekeeping battalions fulfilling tasks 
in the Balkans. 
  Yevgeniy Podkolzin was very adverse in his response to the 
NATO generals' decision to inflict strikes against civilian 
targets located far from the front line, which have caused to 
casualties. "The Russian Federation soldiers in this conflict 
see their task to be to bring peace to people, not to resort to 
such extreme measures", the commander of the air assault troops 
stressed.

  [Text] Belgrade April 11 TASS -- Muslims were the first to 
initiate combat activities in Gorazde, however leader of Bosnian 
Serbs Radovan Karadzic ordered to stop any shelling of the town 
upon a Russian request, Russian Special Envoy to former 
Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin told TASS on Monday. 
  He explained that after NATO air strikes new reports about 
Serbian attacks on Gorazde appeared. He then discussed the 
issue at talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic who, in 
his turn, contacted Karadzic and the latter ordered to cease 
fire. 
  Churkin believes that the fighting near Gorazde testifies 
that neither the Serbian nor Muslim military can be well 
controlled. "It is to be remembered that it were the Muslims who 
were the first to begin combat activities in Gorazde despite the 
fact that the region was proclaimed a safety zone by the UN", 
the Russian envoy stressed. 
  In general the situation has become critical after NATO air 
strikes, according to Churkin. "A new element has appeared - the 
interference of the United Nations into the Bosnian conflict. 
There is a tendency of moving to a greater confrontation", he 
said and added that the major task is to avert the tendency and 
conclude a ceasefire agreement. 
  Upon a request of Milosevic, Churkin is now heading to Pale, 
the capital of Bosnian Serbs, to "try and bring together the 
fragments of the Bosnian peaceful settlement". 
  After the NATO air strikes Bosnian Serbs announced they stop 
any cooperation with the UN forces. "However, during our meeting 
with President Milosevic today an understanding was reached that 
the process could not go uncontrolled, that it is necessary to 
reach a ceasefire agreement which the sides failed to do over 
the last days", he said. 
  "The talk is about an armistice along the whole of the 
frontline", the Russian envoy said. 
  Churkin regretted that neither UN nor NATO had consulted 
Russia before the air strikes although they had enough time for 
that. However, Bosnian Serbs did not consult Russia either. 
They responded to all Russian requests that they had no plans 
regarding Gorazde and that there was no necessity for Russia to 
resort to serious actions to normalise the situation in the 
town, according to the Russian envoy. 
  "All sides could have exerted efforts so that Russia did 
mediate. But this was not done", Churkin said. He did not rule 
out that NATO may resume air strikes on Bosnian Serbs. "At 
present no possible combat actions can be ruled out", he 
stressed.

  [Text] Moscow April 11 TASS -- The Russian Foreign Ministry 
released the following statement on Monday: 
  "According to the information the Russian Foreign Ministry 
has at the moment, in the evening of April 10 NATO aviation, 
which, according to U.N. Security Council decisions, was 
exercising control in the no-fly zone in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
delivered bomb strikes on Bosnian Serbs' artillery positions 
which shelled Gorazde and where, apart from civilians, U.N. and 
international red cross workers were staying. The U.N. 
secretary-general's envoy to the former Yugoslavia Yasushi 
Akashi discussed with Butrus-Ghali the possibility of using 
aviation to protect U.N. personnel in retaliation to artillery 
shelling of safe havens, including Gorazde, as envisaged by U.N. 
Security Council resolutions. 
  "These violations cannot be tolerated. However, neither one 
must support provocations to which the Muslim side resorts, of 
which U.N. officials have repeatedly reported. In its statement 
of April 6, 1994 the U.N. Security Council demanded an end to 
the provocation from either side. 
  "Unfortunately, Russia was informed about the decision to 
use 
aviation retrospectively. We expect full information from the 
U.N. leadership about what happened. 
  "As a direct and active participant in the Bosnian 
settlement 
Russia stands for the prevention of escalation of this conflict 
and for invigoration on the part of the international community 
of efforts aimed at showing all sides the road to peace."

  [Text] Belgrade, 11 Apr, (TANJUG) --Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic today received the Russian president's 
special envoy Vitaliy Churkin who arrived in Belgrade last night 
in the context of preparations for further negotiations between 
the Republic of Serb Krajina and Croatia. 
  NATO's military operation against the Serbs in Bosnia last 
night has obviously brought about a change to the agenda for the 
talks between Milosevic and Churkin, as well as a change in the 
timetable of the Russian envoy's visit. Instead of travelling to 
Zagreb, as he initially planned, Churkin will pay an urgent 
visit to Pale. 
  Following his two hour talks with President Milosevic, 
Churkin described the latest situation in Bosnia in the wake of 
NATO's military operation as a very serious one, stressing that 
the peace process has been pushed down a dangerous ravine. 
  In Churkin's words, at the moment Moscow's diplomatic 
efforts 
are being invested in such a way whereby the tragic experience 
in Gorazde will not be repeated anywhere else in Bosnia. In 
this context he told reporters that he was immediately setting 
off for Pale where he will talk to representatives of the Serb 
republic. He did not rule out contacts with other sides, 
including the Americans too. 
  The Russian envoy said that President Milosevic today had 
asked him to try and help in order to have this present 
dangerous situation overcome. We are aware of the problems 
arising between the Bosnian Serbs and UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Force]. I nevertheless believe that we can help in restarting 
the negotiating process. 
  In Churkin's opinion, it is now of crucial importance to 
reach a firm agreement on the cessation of hostilities across 
the entire territory of Bosnia, including Gorazde. 
  One of the questions addressed to Churkin was whether NATO 
had consulted Moscow before attacking the Serb positions around 
Gorazde. No, we were not informed about the attack, Churkin 
said. He added that Moscow had certain objections about the 
level of communication between all factors involved in the 
Bosnian conflict. He said that Moscow had received assurances 
from the Bosnian Serbs that nothing serious would happen in 
Gorazde. He stressed that if Russia had been more involved and 
better informed about the situation around Gorazde, certain 
things would not have happened, obviously hinting to last 
night's NATO attack. 
  In the Russian envoy's opinion, NATO's military action will 
have no influence on the relations between Moscow and 
Washington. He said that Russia and the United States are 
working together to solve the Bosnian conflict, that sometimes 
they had different approaches, but that was not a reason to give 
up on joint action. Churkin expressed hope that, by working 
together, Moscow and Washington could achieve a lot in order to 
bring the situation, which is now exceptionally dangerous, back 
to normal. 
  Asked whether NATO's consultation with Moscow about 
yesterday's action would have been necessary, Churkin said yes. 
He believes that not only consultations between NATO and Moscow 
would have been necessary, but that it was particularly 
important that UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali should have 
informed Russia about what was going on around Gorazde. 
  However, Butrus-Ghali did not do that, and Churkin sees the 
great speed in the development of the situation around Gorazde 
as the only justification for that. In the end, stressing the 
necessity of better communication between the crucial players in 
the Bosnian conflict, Churkin said that he hoped that NATO would 
learn a lesson from yesterday's action and not do that again.

  [Text] The leadership of the Russian Defense Ministry did 
not consider the question of suspending the airlift to the 
former Yugoslavia of an additional contingent of Russian 
peace-keepers due to the NATO air strike against Serb positions 
in the area of Gorazde, INTERFAX was told by the spokesman for 
the Defense Ministry Vladimir Kosarev. 
  He said that a Ukrainian infantry company of the 
peace-keeping contingent is stationed in the vicinity of Gorazde 
where earlier NATO forces bombed the Bosnian Serb positions. 
The spokesman said that there are no casualties among the 
Ukrainian servicemen. 
  Earlier the Federation Council decided to send to the former 
Yugoslavia an additional 300 Russian servicemen to raise the 
number of the Russian contingent to 1500 people.

that similar actions "destabilize the situation in the Balkans, 
internationalize the conflict, which is the internal affair of 
the state structures formed on the basis of the former republics 
of Yugoslavia." 
  The statement says that the world wars of the 20th Century 
were unleashed in the Balkans and adds that the "Russian people 
support their Serb brothers." 
  Liberal Democratic party chairman Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is 
currently in Strasburg where the Russian parliamentary 
delegation takes part in the parliamentary assembly of the 
Council of Europe.

  [Text] At the end of the evening sitting of the State Duma 
Friday, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
(LDPR), Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, made a statement on behalf of his 
faction. He said that it was against any contacts with NATO as 
well as Russia's joining the program Partnership for Peace and 
the Council of European. 
  Zhirinovskiy said that before a Russian parliamentary 
delegation left for Strasbourg, the State Duma should take a 
vote on what kind of position it should take there. "The 
delegation to Strasbourg must have powers," he said. 
  Zhirinovskiy pointed out that the LDPR was against any 
military exercises which involved the participation of foreign 
troops on Russian territory. The Russian military taking part 
in such exercises together with Americans would lose their 
shoulder stripes if another regime came to power, he was quoted 
as saying. 
  Zhirinovskiy called on the deputies to take a stance in the 
wake of the initiative by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev 
on Kazakhstan's joining Russia and Belarus in the united ruble 
zone and demanded the resignation of a number of ministers. 
However, he did not indicate to whom he was referring. 
  As a sign of protest, the deputies of Russia's Choice left 
the hall as soon as Parliamentary Speaker Ivan Rybkin allowed 
Zhirinovskiy to take the floor. For his part, Zhirinovskiy 
asked the health care minister to prescribe them some medicine, 
because the faction of Russia's Choice had been clinically dead 
for the last four months, he said.

  [Text] Moscow, April 8 (AFP) -- A senior defense official 
said Friday that U.S. and Russian troops would hold joint 
exercises in Russia later this year, but the announcement 
sparked an angry outcry from hardline lawmakers. 
  "American troops will never set foot on Russian territory," 
ultranationalist deputy Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said shortly after 
Deputy Defense Minister Georgi Kondratyev announced the planned 
exercises to the State Duma. 
  "Officers who think they can get an extra star from 
organizing this kind of exercise should remember that the regime 
here will change one day and they will lose everything," 
Zhirinovskiy stated. 
  Kondratyev said the joint exercises, agreed to during the 
Russian-U.S. summit in January, would be held in July in the 
southern Urals region of Orenburg and would be conducted by the 
27th Motorized Division of the Russian Army and the U.S. 3d 
Mechanized Infantry Division. A total of 250 soldiers from each 
country, most of them officers, were to take part in the 
exercises, Kondratyev said, adding that they would focus on 
exploring ways Russian and U.S. troops could coordinate work in 
peacekeeping operations. The Russian side would be equipped 
with 10 armoured vehicles and 23 cars while the U.S. 
participants would have only 35 cars, he stated. 
  Kondratyev stressed that the U.S. Government would pay all 
expenses for its troops, estimated at two million dollars, and 
noted that the U.S. troops would arrive supplied with all the 
food needed for the exercises. Russian expenses for the 
exercises would be about 100 million rubles (55,000 dollars), he 
said. 
  Zhirinovskiy and other hardline deputies however denounced 
the plan and one, Alexander Mikhailov, called on the Duma to 
appeal to President Boris Yeltsin and to the government to 
cancel the exercises. "Who will keep an eye on the Americans 
and who will guarantee us that they will not start recruiting 
spies in the heart of Russia!" said Alexander Nevzorov, another 
hardline nationalist and former television commentator.

  [Text] Moscow April 11 TASS -- The main command of the 
Russian Navy resolutely protested against the seizure by 
Ukrainian commandos of a unit of the Black Sea Fleet stationed 
near Odessa. 
  "Such actions can be interpreted only as political 
irresponsibility and deliberate ignoring of the 
Russian-Ukrainian agreements reached in Yalta and Massandra", 
the press service of the Navy told TASS on Monday qualifying the 
events as "provocative". 
  "The actions of the Ukrainian side are provocative in 
essence 
and form, are a flagrant violation of the reached agreements and 
create an explosive situation on the Black Sea Fleet", the press 
service said. 
  120 Ukrainian commandos from a special task force seized 
late 
on Sunday a division of the Black Sea Fleet, including its coast 
facilities, the communication centre, the premises containing 
secret documents and weapons. Commander of the unit Captain 
First Rank Oleg Feoktistov and Commander of the coast units 
Captain Second Rank Dmitriy Starikov were arrested, handcuffed 
and taken to the military commandant's office. Chief of staff 
Captain Second Rank Aleksandr Zelenko was also arrested. 
Navymen and members of their families were beaten during the 
attack. 
  "Who could have ordered such actions against a military unit 
making part of the Black Sea Fleet which is subordinated to the 
presidents of Russia and Ukraine?", the press service asked and 
added that most indignation is caused by brutalities of 
Ukrainian commandos towards family members of navymen.

  [Text] Moscow April 9 (TASS) -- "Ukrainian border guards 
were overexcited with patriotism," Head of the Black Sea Fleet 
Press Center Andrey Grachev told ITAR-TASS here today, 
commenting on the Odessa conflict of Russian seamen with 
Ukrainian border guards. 
  In his words, the Russian Cheleken military vessel arrived 
in 
Odessa to load hydrographic equipment and carry it to 
Sevastopol. However, last night Ukrainian border guards tried to 
prevent this and even placed armed guards near the ship. Their 
actions almost provoked a serious conflict. 
  In the opinion of Grachev, Ukrainian military are 
responsible 
for the attempt to hamper the planned transportation of Russian 
property for repairs. He stressed that the Russian hydrographic 
vessel which has a military crew shall not be liable for customs 
and border inspection. There are no documents to prohibit such 
actions in the Black Sea Fleet's operational zone.

  [Text] The Russian Customs Committee arrested the account 
of the major Russian state enterprise "Rosneft" demanding 
payment of customs duties worth more than 148 billion rubles for 
supplies of 2.6 million tonnes of oil to Ukraine. 
  As the Oil Information Agency learned in the Russian Customs 
Committee, its leadership is not yet prepared to comment on the 
incident, "because we understand that we create a precedent of 
persecuting a state enterprise which fulfils orders of the 
government." 
  At the same time, representatives of West Siberian oil and 
gas enterprises told the agency's correspondent that they do not 
rule out the possibility of appealing to the Russian President's 
Administration's Control Department following the facts "of 
absurd attempts to take the money for export of oil which we 
must supply under intergovernment agreements to those who do not 
pay for it." Out of the total amount of payment for this lot of 
Russian oil (225 billion rubles) Kiev paid less than half. 
  A well-informed source in "Rosneft" said in an interview 
with 
the Oil Information Agency that Russian oil and gas enterprises 
received an additional export quota for supplies in the summer 
of 1993 of 2.6 million tonnes of oil to Ukraine in connection 
with "the need to supply this oil anywhere, in order just to 
unload pipelines." He said that Kiev and Moscow acted in the 
framework of the Russian-Ukrainian intergovernment agreement 
envisaging tough terms of payment for Russian fuel supplied to 
Ukraine. "Rosneft's duty was to conclude contracts with oil 
plants concerning technical organization of supplies and control 
payments by the Ukrainian side. 
  Kiev in turn promised to attract foreign investors for 
paying 
Russia up to $50 million a month and to purchase up to 20 
billion rubles on hard currency exchange to pay for oil 
supplies. However, despite efforts by Russian organizations, 
the full debt has not been repaid. 
  Russian government experts note the weakening of Russia's 
positions on the world and domestic oil markets caused by a fall 
in oil prices and non-payments crisis. In their opinion, 
attempts to increase financial pressure on fuel and energy 
complex enterprises may cause a sharp decline in the extraction 
of oil and other fuels, as well as a sharp reduction of oil and 
gas exports.

  [Text] Moscow April 11 TASS -- Fighters of the Russian 
airforce forced to land an Israeli "Gulfstream-159" plane flying 
from Tbilisi, Georgia, to Tel Aviv after it had violated the 
rules of crossing the Russian border and using the national 
airspace, spokesman of the Russian Air Defence Leonid Shirobokov 
told TASS on Monday. 
  The incident occurred on Saturday when the plane entered the 
Russian airspace to the south-east of the city of Mineralnye 
Vody without a preliminary request and permission from 
authorities. 
  The plane ignored the demands of Russian authorities to 
return back to the airport of departure and continued the 
flight. Russian airforce fighters then intercepted the plane 
and forced it to land in Adler, the airport of Sochi.

  [Text] Latvia will not accept Moscow's clarifications about 
President Yeltsin's decree 174 of April 5 because of its 
sovereignty being put under threat, Latvian Embassy officials 
told Interfax. They referred to Friday's statement that Latvian 
ambassador Janis Peters made to Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vitaliy Churkin. 
  President Yeltsin on Thursday issued a decree supporting 
proposals by the defence and foreign ministries to set up 
Russian military bases in other CIS states and Latvia. 
Officials of both ministries later spoke of "technical 
mistakes" being made in drafting the paper and Russian 
Ambassador to Riga Aleksandr Rannikh made a formal apology to 
the Latvian Foreign Ministry. 
  Latvian Embassy officials said Churkin had suggested that 
the 
two countries should maintain their relations as usual working 
on the assumption that the Yeltsin decree did not exist. He was 
also quoted as having promised a thorough investigation into the 
origin of the paper "which is out of line with bilateral 
agreements, already initialled."

about military bases in the CIS which had appeared in the press, 
but said the document is being drafted. 
  The document is being drafted and positions of CIS countries 
and of the "near abroad" will be (undoubtedly) taken into 
consideration, Kozyrev said after talks with his Columbian 
counterpart Nohemi Sanin Posada de Rubio. The "near abroad" 
includes all former Soviet republics. 
  "The issue of deploying Russian military bases will be 
discussed only with those countries which display such an 
interest", the Russian foreign minister said.

  [Text] Moscow, 9 April -- "The technical error that 
appeared in the Russian president's instruction of 5 April will 
undoubtedly be subject to serious investigation within the 
presidential structures responsible for preparation of this 
document," Sergey Kravchenko, deputy head of the Russian 
president's administration, stated today in the Kremlin in an 
exclusive interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
  He explained that instead of the words "military 
installation," which can be understood as a technical facility, 
a term "military base" has crept in, which radically changes the 
meaning of the document. 
  Sergey Kravchenko said that "a special commission for 
investigation into the circumstances surrounding this case will 
be set up in the next few days." In his view, it can be set up 
"by the president himself or the head of his administration." 
The deputy head of the Russian president's administration did 
not rule out the possibility of "this being not just a technical 
mistake but a political action aimed at disrupting the meeting 
between the Russian and Latvian heads of state."

<F P=106> [Vladimir Yanchenkov report: "Vyacheslav Kostikov Briefing"] </F>
  [Text] At a routine Kremlin briefing yesterday Vyacheslav 
Kostikov, the Russian president's press secretary, briefed 
Russian and foreign journalists on the program for Boris 
Yeltsin's forthcoming official visit to Spain. He noted that 
Russia has long-standing political, cultural, and international 
links with this state. Seven documents will be signed -- the 
most important being a treaty of friendship and cooperation 
between the two countries. It is worth noting, Kostikov said, 
that it has been decided to sign these documents in the Moncloa 
Palace, where the agreement on civil consensus in Spain was once 
signed. This fact, the press secretary believes, forms a kind 
of bridge between international actions and our current domestic 
problems. 
  Vyacheslav Kostikov went on to answer numerous questions 
from 
journalists on Russia's international and domestic policy. 
Explaining the situation within the Russian Federal Assembly 
Federation Council in connection with the discussion of the 
question of former General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik, the 
press secretary expressed disappointment at what had happened, 
but does not think that the Federation Council intended to seek 
a confrontation with the president. Unfortunately, emotions 
prevailed, and the Federation Council itself will have to find a 
way out of this involved situation. 
  Answering a question about State Duma deputies' attitudes 
toward the signing of NATO's "Partnership For Peace" program, 
the press secretary noted that our position is to avoid any 
confrontation between the president and the State Duma on this 
issue. NATO's "Partnership For Peace" program, Vyacheslav 
Kostikov believes, presupposes extensive cooperation both in 
politics and in the military sphere, but one of the most 
important elements of big-time politics -- the economy -- cannot 
be hived off. Russia, as is well known, would like to join the 
G-7. Why not link these problems? If we are being invited to 
engage in partnership on an equal basis in the political and 
military spheres, then it would probably be logical to extend 
this approach to the economy as well. 
  The briefing also touched on the question of G. Burbulis' 
departure from the "Russia's Choice" parliamentary faction. Of 
course, Vyacheslav Kostikov said, it is disappointing that the 
trailblazers of Russian democracy are leaving "Russia's Choice" 
-- where the forces of democracy are concentrated. When asked 
by this ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent why the president's 
instructions on restoring order on the North Caucasus Railroad 
-- where robbery and theft from trains traveling from Chechnya 
continue -- are not being fulfilled, the press secretary replied 
that the question was a fair one, that corresponding 
instructions had been issued to the Defense Ministry, and that 
the military should be approached for further explanations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev on board a </F>
Tu-134 by Nikolay Dolgopolov; date, precise location not given: 
"Conversation with Minister Kozyrev in the Heavens"] 
  [Excerpts] People in the West -- and, above all, at home 
-- have all been amazed at how Kozyrev has changed. There are 
far fewer rumors about his resigning and more and more talk 
about his and Russia's political firmness. What is the reason 
for this change in the foreign minister's image and in Russia's 
foreign policy course? Our long discussion took place on board 
a Tu-134, and, surprisingly, Kozyrev had left his usual 
diplomatic restraint back on the ground. [Passage omitted] 
  [Dolgopolov] We have now, touch wood, removed the threat of 
nuclear war. I have a different question. Today our Russian 
diplomatic service and you as its main repository have a new 
image -- a fairly aggressive one. I did not board this aircraft 
to praise you. But over the last few months things have been 
more successful for Russia in this field. Let us recall poor 
Yugoslavia at least. What is the reason for the turnaround? 
And how do those Americans who, I bet, are unaccustomed to 
seeing you as a determined man, react to these changes? Is 
there a grain of truth in my observations? 
  [Kozyrev] Certainly. Russia will never become a 
second-rate, insignificant country. We will put straight anyone 
who does not understand that right away. Russia must be a 
great, global power. But I must point out that diplomacy and 
indeed policy as a whole never arise out of nothing. They 
derive strength from society and are shaped by the state. But 
we have a new Russian state system, it has already found its 
level. And diplomacy is accordingly acquiring a different 
voice. This is very easy to talk about now, whereas back in 
1991 we had to speak loudly and energetically. People forget one 
thing: Our huge state had after all broken up then. And our 
newly formed country was faced initially not with the question 
of having a loud voice but of having a voice at all and 
remaining within the international system. No one said that the 
Russian Federation is the rightful heir of the Soviet Union's 
legacy. I admit to you that in those conditions the task of 
practicing the diplomacy of the least possible losses is a 
highly complex one. That is roughly what we did in 1991, when 
the Union ceased to exist, and in 1992. Never mind the 
luxuries, all we wanted to do was stay alive. 
  And we survived. What is more we joined all the 
international organizations to which the USSR was just not 
admitted. Everything comes to him who waits. That is why 
Russian diplomacy is growing stronger now. As a professional I 
am surprised by the fact that at this time a host of people has 
emerged who are yelling: But I was defending my doctor's thesis 
back then, in the second year at the institute. However, you 
must not forget that the Soviet Union was a very unique state. 
It bore a kind of mark of Cain. Although it is our homeland 
and we do of course take pride in a lot of its heritage, the 
country was not entirely normal. You see what our diplomacy has 
had to come through. Everything's time comes. I want Russian 
statehood to grow stronger. And we need a firm authority. The 
firmer authority in Russia.... 
  [Dolgopolov] ...Excuse me, do you mean firm internal 
authority? 
  [Kozyrev] Yes, precisely that, then we will use even firmer 
language on the international arena. 
  [Dolgopolov] Andrey Vladimirovich, about the Americans. Are 
they conscious of this? 
  [Kozyrev] Of course they are. You know there is a 
two-pronged reaction. Anyone has some desire, a natural 
temptation to establish relations that are as suitable for 
themselves as possible. They have seen that we are normal 
people and will not fuel the nuclear threat. And of course the 
Americans want us to remain normal politicians. But like a poor 
relation. You are a good guy, so follow us. You used to be bad 
and did everything in an inhuman way. I must say that there is 
a grain of truth in this, although not 100 percent. A definite 
stereotype has developed: Since you are being good, follow us. 
But we are now saying: Yes, we have become good. But you will 
have to follow us on these issues. That may be causing them 
some discomfort in the United States: how, why? 
  Russia cannot of course, however, give in to euphoria or 
hysterics. But nor should the Americans think that we as a 
great power will always follow the United States without fail. 
Nothing of the sort! There are issues on which, and I do not 
rule this out, we may follow their lead. But in areas where it 
is natural they will have to follow Russia's lead. And in some 
spheres we will act together. 
  [Dolgopolov] Whom do you personally find it easier to deal 
with -- Christopher or his predecessors? 
  [Kozyrev] Let's not get onto that. 
  [Dolgopolov] It strikes me that even the Americans have 
realized that Russia is not a poor relative, if only because of 
the diplomatic success in Yugoslavia. Will there be a new 
flourish following the coming visit to Moscow by two sworn 
hard-liners -- Comrade `Arafat of the PLO and Mr. Rabin of 
Israel? Can we hope that the Near East problem will be solved 
after all? 
  [Kozyrev] At any rate we do not plan to withdraw from the 
Near East. You see, we have taken part in this process from the 
very outset -- in conjunction with the Americans, naturally, as 
co-sponsors.... 
  [Dolgopolov] That's a difficult word. 
  [Kozyrev] Co-sponsors? We have been like Siamese twins. 
The States once proposed a new format to us -- we agreed to 
always speak with a single voice. If Russia said something, it 
meant that the United States would do the same (and vice versa, 
of course) -- that was roughly the understanding. Our American 
partners started approaching this issue, as it were, in a new 
way. They began coming up with their own initiatives. 
Admittedly, they were always aimed in the same direction. But 
when we asked them several times why these initiatives had not 
been coordinated with us in some considerable detail, they 
replied: "Why should we coordinate details on this!" 
  And let me tell you something frankly. After a couple of 
answers like that we told them: "OK, since that's your idea of 
partnership, maybe it suits us too." Then it was "so long, 
Siamese twins." We are still people pulling the cart in the 
same direction. We will just each be doing so in our own way. 
And we too have started speaking with our own voice and taking 
our own initiatives. We and the United States have common goals 
-- only a peace settlement will do, nothing else. But our steps 
will be completely independent. We are no longer twins but 
people doing the same job but by different means. Recently in 
Vladivostok I mentioned this bluntly to Christopher: If you 
want to have very close cooperation anywhere, let's discuss it. 
In other areas it might indeed not be advisable to speak with a 
single voice. We can each do it in our own way -- and, 
naturally, head in the same direction. But it should not be the 
case that the United States has, as it were, free partnership, 
while Russia has close partnership. If you have the freedom to 
come up with your own initiatives on a specific issue, then we 
have exactly the same freedom. Let there be equal opportunities 
and commitments. If we agree once again to operate somewhere as 
Siamese twins and if it is in our common interests, then that is 
possible too. 
  [Dolgopolov] I really get the feeling that in certain parts 
of the world our interests are interlinked. Take North Korea -- 
which the Americans claim already has an atom bomb. But isn't 
the United States being too tough on the Koreans? There's no 
visible sign of even normal diplomacy. The sons of Kim Il-song 
have their backs to the wall, and no escape is obvious. 
  [Excerpts] [Kozyrev] That is why we came up with a new 
initiative the other day. It has two simple, clear elements 
which reflect the interests both of us and, I am sure, of all 
other normal states. The first is to prevent the 
nonproliferation regime from being undermined. 
  And the second. It has proved really impossible to solve the 
problem on a U.S.-DPRK basis alone -- there has just been 
further deterioration and tension. I won't say who is right and 
who is wrong. But the fact is that this is the situation. So 
we have proposed convening an international conference to 
discuss and resolve this problem. The participants would be the 
states in direct proximity and with real interests. These would 
be Russia -- the events are almost as if they are happening in 
the near abroad, right in our back yard. China. The United 
States -- for the simple reason that the Koreans are demanding 
certain decisions from the States. And the two Koreas and Japan. 
  [Dolgopolov] Andrey Vladimirovich, we ourselves also have 
plenty of difficult problems in the far, or -- as you might 
interpret it -- near abroad. Just take the protracted dispute 
with Japan over the northern territories. First there are 
reports that our border guards have been quietly withdrawn. 
Then the president's press secretary explains that it is not 
the border guards who are being withdrawn, just obsolete 
equipment. Hata recently visited Moscow. So just what is going 
on? 
  [Kozyrev] A clear-cut formula was reached during Yeltsin's 
visit to Tokyo -- the northern territories issue does exist. 
Unfortunately, we have inherited an unregulated border from the 
USSR. The treaty which would fix the border does not exist. It 
is in both our interest and that of the Japanese to work on this 
issue. But although this was a stumbling block to the 
development of any kind of relations for 45 years following the 
war, this is now no longer the case -- as the Hata visit 
confirmed. Admittedly, nothing revolutionary has happened -- 
and may not happen for a long time to come. It is a highly 
complex matter. But there is no cause for despair, we must keep 
on trying. This does not mean that they should make 
concessions, or that we are obliged to either. We have to work 
on this for as long as it takes. 
  [Dolgopolov] Now a word about another visit which strangely 
became a talking point. 
  [Kozyrev] You're talking about Nixon's visit? 
  [Dolgopolov] I know that you did not meet with him, but what 
happened? How do you view Yeltsin's appearance against the 
backdrop of the Kremlin wall, where he treated the old 
ex-president extremely severely? Nixon, who is 81 years old, 
has definite influence with Republicans in the United States, 
and it was not just anyone but Democrat Bill Clinton who sent 
him to our country. 
  [Kozyrev] I will tell you everything I know about this. I 
am aware of the external aspects and some of the internal 
aspects. It is like the theater: The Americans simply have 
poor producers. The whole scene may have been badly planned. A 
good, well-known actor appears -- Nixon. But the producer makes 
a major error: The actor appears at quite the wrong moment. He 
turns up in the wrong play, using his lines in a different 
dialogue at the wrong moment. The audience laughs. And someone 
gets angry. The irritation begins. This is what happened to 
Nixon. This was the first time in all his recent visits that he 
did not address me, for instance. 
  [Dolgopolov] Are you friendly with him? 
  [Kozyrev] Very. It must be said that he was undertaking an 
interesting mission. He has found his niche. He came here with 
a similar objective under Gorbachev in 1991. And even then he 
tracked me down at the Russian Foreign Ministry -- in a wretched 
small building with a collapsing floor. We organized everything 
normally for him. "Gorbymania" was at its height in the United 
States. And on his return he decided to say that "Gorbymania" 
only ruled in the West, while the situation was effectively the 
reverse in the USSR. And he also told the United States about 
Yeltsin the real political figure. So neither I nor Boris 
Nikolayevich have anything but respect for Nixon. He is a major 
political figure. And visits by people of that level must be 
organized by professionals. A foreign minister should not have 
to learn about a former president's visit in the newspapers. 
  [Dolgopolov] So who did organize it? 
  [Kozyrev] I do not want to say who did this. The people who 
did it know who they are. But it was not that they were 
unprofessional in what they did, but deliberately overturned 
everything. Absolutely! Everything was topsy-turvy so that the 
main hero became the main villain. He did not meet Boris 
Nikolayevich. But the president learned that Nixon had gone to 
see Rutskoy, Zhirinovskiy, everyone. I cannot understand it, no 
one has ever behaved like that. Impromptu moves are well 
prepared for any visit by a politician who is in any way 
respectable. I hope everyone is aware of this. But impromptu 
moves for the sake of it are a mistake. Nixon's visit involved 
a series of political mistakes. I don't think he himself had 
anything to do with it. I think he was told that the program 
had been worked out and prepared as always. He does not have to 
go into every detail. There is a certain apparatus to handle 
this. But Nixon found himself in a very surprising situation. 
Imagine: You get up early one morning, go to your bathroom in 
your robe, clean your teeth, and suddenly there is someone else 
there, albeit a friend, but someone whom you did not invite. 
And you say in amazement: "Why couldn't you call me and tell 
me you were coming? Aren't we good friends?" And Boris 
Nikolayevich was right to say that he had not been treated as 
befits the president of Russia. 
  [Dolgopolov] You mentioned that Nixon met with 
Zhirinovskiy. And Vladimir Volfovich tried to a certain extent 
to pass himself off as your colleague -- he was dying to head 
the Duma International Affairs Committee. 
  [Kozyrev] He's dying to be head of state. 
  [Dolgopolov] Would you shake his hand? 
  [Kozyrev] No. 
  [Dolgopolov] Or acknowledge him? 
  [Kozyrev] I have no truck with fascists. 
  [Dolgopolov] What then is your attitude to the Duma's rather 
surprising amnesty law? 
  [Kozyrev] To my mind, the decision to release everybody was 
by no means right. 
  [Dolgopolov] But a memorandum of accord has already been 
prepared.... 
  [Kozyrev] ...The talk of a universal accord is abstract. If 
the concept has something else in mind other than the 
Constitution -- an agreement with the fascists, for instance -- 
I do not understand it and will have no part of it. If it means 
agreement with the party of war that Rutskoy leads, I will tell 
you bluntly -- Rutskoy means war. 
  [Dolgopolov] ...Aren't you being a bit hard on the former 
vice president? 
  [Kozyrev] ...There is civil, cold, and maybe even hot war in 
the world. Let me tell you straightaway -- if Rutskoy or 
Zhirinovskiy becomes president, Russia will not survive. I 
would repeat that I am giving you my personal view. I can see 
no agreement on this. What would it consist of? Of observing 
the Constitution? The entire people voted for that. But those 
who called on Russia to take up the sword should be kept in 
jail. Until such time as Zhirinovskiy abandons his blatantly 
fascist slogans and Rutskoy his gamble on, essentially, a rerun 
of the Yugoslavia situation in Russia, I can have no agreement 
with them. 
  [Dolgopolov] One more difficult question before we land, 
Andrey Vladimirovich. 
  [Kozyrev] Go ahead. Although it's time to fasten your seat 
belt. 
  [Dolgopolov] It's about a problem which for some reason is 
of concern to almost everyone. Just what is the Foreign 
Ministry's personnel policy? For instance, who appoints 
ambassadors -- you or the Kremlin? Sometimes when you see 
people emerge in diplomatic posts you have to wonder: Just what 
is so-and-so -- not a career diplomat but a recycled political 
figure -- going to be doing abroad? 
  [Kozyrev] There has not been a single appointment that has 
not been coordinated with me. Sometimes the initiative may come 
from Boris Nikolayevich. Or somebody else might say -- 
so-and-so's a good man, he'd do well in such-and-such a posting. 
Yes, there are times when people are suggested. There are 
times when it is suggested to them. Sometimes they ask 
themselves. Admittedly they'll later say in public that they 
weren't asked, that they were virtually forced into it. I know 
pretty much exactly who asked and who didn't. 
  [Dolgopolov] But people do ask.... 
  [Kozyrev] Yes, there are non-career diplomats who ask for 
postings themselves. 
  [Dolgopolov] I should explain to readers that the word 
"non-career" means people who previously had no connection with 
the Foreign Ministry or diplomacy, but who have nonetheless 
received important postings far from home. 
  [Kozyrev] That's about the size of it. Now to turn to Boris 
Nikolayevich's role. He is the president, and under the 
Constitution he appoints the ambassadors. It is the Foreign 
Ministry Collegium which decides whom to recommend. But I would 
reiterate that there has not been a single ambassador posted by 
Boris Nikolayevich without our consent. We will now be 
consulting with parliament -- with four committees from the two 
chambers. 
  [Dolgopolov] My last question. There has now been a certain 
renewal among the top Foreign Ministry leadership. You have new 
deputies and even first deputies. Are you not worried that some 
of them -- former ambassador to Spain Igor Ivanov, for instance 
-- may be dealing with problems that are entirely new to them? 
He has been and still is a Europe specialist, but is now 
conducting highly difficult talks on the Near East. 
  [Kozyrev] Are you sure the job should definitely be done by 
an Arabist? We work on the basis of their experience, advice, 
and recommendations. But a first deputy minister, who makes 
policy and conducts talks, should have political experience and 
very high professional standards. I'm a supporter of teamwork. 
And I want people to know who works at the Foreign Ministry. 
There's Vitaliy Ivanovich Churkin -- he handles Yugoslavia. I 
am pleased for his -- our -- success. I have no inferiority 
complex at all. Boris Nikolayevich Pastukhov handles Georgia. 
Ivanov deals with the Near East.... These are all top-notch, 
experienced people. Each in their own post. 
  [Dolgopolov] We are landing, Andrey Vladimirovich. You 
yourself will realize that not everything we have discussed can 
be included in the interview. This isn't the West -- our 
newspapers are just eight pages long. So -- thank you, and we 
will try to include the most interesting parts of our talk. You 
yourself said that people should know about those who work at 
the Foreign Ministry. So now they will.

  [Text] The press center of the Baltic Fleet has described 
as completely untrue reports in some of the media that the 
command of the Baltic Fleet's Tallinn base has illegally sold to 
local commercial bodies a number of out-of-service hover landing 
craft containing sources of radioactive radiation. 
  The fact of the matter is that, after receiving permission 
from higher authority, the command of Tallinn naval base agreed 
in February 1993 to hand over two redundant minesweepers for 
scrapping and subsequent sale to the Estonian (Bankir) company. 
The terms of the agreement have been observed by both sides. 
There were no sources of radioactive radiation on the 
minesweepers. Moreover, ships of the type in question are not 
designed to carry such installations.

  [Text] The Hague April 11 ITAR-TASS -- The session of the 
preparatory commission for the establishment of an international 
organisation in charge of monitoring the ban on chemical weapons 
heard a statement of the Russian delegate today. The statement 
stresses that much work has been done since the convention on 
chemical weapons was opened for signing more than a year ago. 
The work mainly concentrated on working out and coordinating 
mechanisms of implementing the convention. 
  However, according to the Russian view, much has yet to be 
done to fulfil the mandate of the preparatory commission. Few 
of the twenty-three tasks set for the commission by the Paris 
resolution are close to completion, and nearly one half of the 
total number have not yet been proper considered. 
  Moreover, the statement says, we are alarmed by the attempts 
made from time to time in the course of the preparatory 
commission's work to revise the essence of certain clauses, as 
well as to enforce interpretations of the text, which was taken 
for granted at the moment of signing. In particular, this 
concerns the correlation of the national constitutional norms 
and the granting of access to chemical installations to 
inspectors at their request, the uncertainties in the 
understanding of the key definitions, such as "chemical weapons" 
and "a facility producing chemical weapons." In addition, 
Russia, which will have to bear the cost of eliminating and 
controlling its own stocks of chemical weapons, cannot agree to 
some of the proposals concerning the distribution of costs among 
all member-stations. 
  When signing the text of the convention on January 13, 1933 
in Paris, Russia which has a stock of chemical weapons with the 
total weight of the toxic substances totalling 40,k000 tonnes, 
was well aware of the scale of the obligations it assumed. 
However, proceeding from an understanding that the convention 
is a major step towards global disarmament and the strengthening 
of international security, and reflects a compromise reached as 
a result of difficult many-year negotiations, Russia was among 
the first to sign this international agreement. When signing 
the convention, Russia stressed that the realisation of the 
obligations under the convention will be contiguous with a 
number of economic difficulties. This implied the lessening of 
Russia's spending on international supervision and verification 
and elaboration of economically-acceptable procedures of 
conversion of the former facilities producing chemical weapons 
to peaceful uses. Russia counted on the possibility of a 
favourable solution of these problems. 
  During the parliamentary hearings about the participation of 
the Russian Federation in international agreements on the 
elimination of chemical weapons, some committees of the State 
Duma noted the need for the final clarification of the situation 
concerning the cost of the realisation of the convention. 
Questions about Russia's spending, as well as about the vague 
idea about the final text of the convention and the uniform 
interpretation of its key terms, the amount of basic obligations 
which determine the scope of the convention will inevitably 
arise when the document is submitted for ratification by the 
Russian Parliament and will in fact predetermine the result of 
its consideration. Unfortunately, in the past year, the 
preparatory commission has failed to examine the procedure of 
payments for the verification activity and the conversion of 
chemical weapon plants to peaceful production, and no decisions 
on these matters have been made up to date. 
  Russia draws everyone's attention to the fact that the 
enforcement of the convention on chemical weapons in 1995 will 
be hampered by the failure to solve the above problems as soon 
as possible. This is necessary to allow the states that signed 
the convention to obtain a full idea about all aspects of 
implementing the convention at the stage of its ratification, 
the statement said.

  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- An agreement on principles of 
relations between the Russian Federation and Colombia was signed 
on Friday by the two countries' ministers of foreign affairs 
Andrey Kozyrev and Nohemi Sanin Posada de Rubio. The signing 
took place in the Russian Foreign Ministry's mansion in downtown 
Moscow within the framework of bilateral talks conducted by the 
Colombian minister in Russia. The agreement which the two 
ministers signed today is the first document of its kind in 
relations between Russia and Latin American countries. 
  The agreement is most important for Russia's global and 
bilateral relations with the countries of the Latin American 
continent, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said after 
the signing. The Colombia minister of foreign affairs for her 
part stressed the fact that Colombia opens a new page in 
relations between Russia and Latin American countries. She 
expressed the hope that her country would soon become a stable 
partner of Russia's in a variety of sphere, including 
scientific, technological, cultural and trade cooperation.

  [Text] Moscow, 8 Apr -- Answering questions from 
journalists, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said he and 
Colombian Foreign Minister Nohemi Sanin Posada de Rubio 
discussed the Cuban question during their talks today. 
  Andrey Kozyrev declared that Russia supports the 
normalization of relations between countries in global terms, 
and advocates the development of democratic processes and 
progressive economic reforms, particularly in Cuba. He pointed 
out: We consider that the reestablishment of diplomatic 
relations between Colombia and Cuba will help consolidate 
democracy and stability on the South American Continent. At the 
same time, our position is that all relics of the "Cold War" 
must be eradicated throughout the world. We oppose all 
manifestations of extremism, which has an ideological basis, and 
we are in favor of consistent political solutions to existing 
differences of opinion. 
  The Colombian minister gave a positive assessment of 
Russia's 
position and declared that her country would welcome the Russian 
Federation to the Nonaligned Movement, where its voice would 
play an important role in strengthening peace throughout the 
world and eliminating ideological confrontation.

  [Text] Russia has been meeting its commitments on the 
supplies of cryogenic rocket boosters to India. The deal, whose 
terms in line with the Missile Technology Control Regime, MTCR, 
were made public at the end of last year, has been officially 
endorsed by the Russian cabinet, a Vice-Chairman of Glavkosmos, 
Russia's major space research establishment, has said in an 
interview with Interfax. 
  In line with new terms, Russia is to deliver at least four 
cryogenic boosters to India for its SLV-3 rockets. This is 
twice more than envisaged by the contract signed by Glavkosmos 
in 1991. Lifted up by a Russian booster, SLV-3 will be able to 
put loads in orbit about 36,000 kilometers above the earth. 
  As the General Director of Russia's Space Agency Yuriy 
Koptev 
has told Interfax, supplies of ready-made cryogenic blocks are 
within MTCR, which Russia wished to join by signing a memorandum 
of intent in Washington on September 2, 1993. 
  In Koptev's words, two additional blocks will be shipped to 
India to compensate for Russia's failure to meet the initial 
commitments, concerning the supply of technologies in bypass of 
MTCR. 
  Koptev declared that Russia had kept virtually intact the 
volume of financing, totalling $300 million, envisaged by the 
contract. India is to get the first booster next year.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi April 11 TASS -- Russia plans to begin 
before the end of this year the building of a maintenance centre 
in India to service Soviet and Russian-made airplanes of the MiG 
series that are being used by the Indian armed forces. 
  The Indian EXPRESS newspaper reported, citing sources in the 
Indian Defence Ministry, that the centre will be built jointly 
by the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and the Moscow 
Aircraft-Producing Association (MAPO) as a pilot project in the 
country, which will provide services to other countries whose 
armed forces use the MiG planes, from the MiG-21 to the MiG-29, 
primarily in Southeast Asia. 
  Commenting on this report at a request from ITAR-TASS, an 
informed Russian source in New Delhi, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, confirmed that an agreement on the building of a 
maintenance centre has been signed between HAL and MAPO. The 
realisation of this agreement will be a subject of negotiations 
between a high-ranking delegation from the Ministry of the 
Aircraft Industry of the Russian Federation, which is due to 
arrive in India in the middle of April, and Indian authorities. 
  According to the same source, Indian press reports about the 
interests shown in the construction of the enterprise by the 
airforces of Malaysia, Vietnam and some Arab countries are 
premature. According to the source, they are rather interested 
in developing their own potential in this direction. 
  Nonetheless, undoubtedly, the idea of creating a maintenance 
centre marks not only a new step in the development of 
military-technical cooperation between Moscow and New Delhi, but 
will reduce the acute shortage of spare parts which the Indian 
airforce needs badly. The press blames the shortage on Russia 
which is not quite fair, according to Sergey Anishchenko, the 
local representative of the Russian state company 
Rosvooruzheniye (Russian Armaments). 
  "Despite numerous claims, it is not understandable why the 
Indian side delays the consideration and signing of contractual 
documents with Russia," Anishchenko said in an interview with 
ITAR-TASS. "In some cases the procrastination lasted up to one 
year. Sometimes when signing contracts our partners 
unilaterally annul up to 30-40 per cent of their own official 
bids". 
  Along with this Sergey Anishchenko expressed the hope that 
Rosvooruzheniye remains a highly qualified partner capable of 
solving adequately and promptly all problems in the interests of 
strengthening the Indian armed forces.

the Far East with the Japanese side," Russian Minister for 
Nuclear Power Engineering Viktor Mikhailov told ITAR-TASS here 
today. In his words, the plant will be built in the area of 
Komsomolsk-on-Amur. It will be a reactor with a relatively low 
electric capacity of 200-300 megawatts. The minister said the 
agreement is estimated at 600-700 million U.S. dollars.

  [Text] The chairman off the Defense and Internal Affairs 
commission of the Armenian parliament Ghevork Bagdasaryan told 
an Interfax reporter that Armenia saw no reason for worry about 
Russian military presence because, in line with a bilateral 
treaty of 1992, a Russian Army Group, with headquarters in 
Yerevan, had already been deployed in the republic. According 
to Bagdasaryan, Armenia's borders with Iran and Turkey were 
controlled exclusively by Russian troops. 
  The treaty of 1992 was ratified by Moscow in 1993 but 
remains 
to be ratified by the Armenian parliament. A number of Armenian 
legislators would like to rewrite some parts off that document. 
They raise objections to the articles on preferential treatment 
for Russian servicemen and the creation of troop deployment 
areas in their republic.

  [Text] Baku (April 8) TURAN--"Democratic Congress is deeply 
concerned about return of Russian troops in Azerbaijan", says 
the statement distributed yesterday in Baku. 
  The statement says that the return of Russian troops will 
not 
help to settle the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. 
  Democratic Congress considers that the priority in the 
settlement of the conflict should be given to the UNO and the 
CSCE organizations, but not to the efforts of one state. 
Democratic Congress mentions that Azerbaijan's conservative 
forces can make use of the return of Russian troops and it can 
lead to tragic consequences. Democratic Congress says that it 
will use all democratic means to prevent the return of Russian 
troops in Azerbaijan. 
  The statement was distributed due to resolution of Russian 
President concerning the creation of military bases of the 
Russian army on the territory of the CIS. Earlier Russian 
Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, said that Russia intends to 
create one military base in Azerbaijan as well. 
  Democratic Congress was founded on March 23 by the 
opposition 
parties of the country. It includes Democratic Party, the 
Popular [People's] Front, "Ana Torpag" party and the party of 
Nation's Freedom.

  [Text] A knowledgeable aide to Azeri President Heydar 
Aliyev said there were neither Russian troops nor Russian 
military facilities in Azerbaijan, so there was no reason for 
Baku to respond to President Yeltsin's order for the creation of 
Russian army bases in Commonwealth republics. 
  According to the source, discussion continued of issues 
related to the use of the Gabalinskaya radar station still 
manned by Russians. Discussion focused on the possible lease of 
the radar station in northern Azerbaijan to the Russian 
military. The source stressed that the Gabalinskaya radar 
station was not an army base but a military facility.

<F P=106> [Report by Georgiy Bovt, Stanislav Tarasov in the "Russia in </F>
the Karabakh Settlement" column: "Azerbaijan May Leave the CIS"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] As a source in Geydar 
Aliyev's entourage told KOMMERSANT-DAILY yesterday, it is not 
ruled out that at the upcoming meeting of CIS leaders the 
republic's delegation will announce its withdrawal from the 
Commonwealth. The cause for this may be disagreements on issues 
which Moscow deems key to a settlement in Karabakh and in the 
region as a whole: about the deployment of Russian troops on 
the line disengaging the Armenians and the Azerbaijanis and on 
the closure of CIS external borders (notably between Azerbaijan 
and Iran). Yet today even the remnants of the semi-demolished 
Azeri opposition are at one with Aliyev's slogan, "No Russian 
troops in the republic!" Especially after the noisy hearings on 
"investigation into the intrusion of Soviet troops in Baku" in 
January 1990. Baku is even more negative on the plans to create 
Russian military bases abroad. 
  Meanwhile, speaking a recent conference of border troop 
commanders in the city of Odintsovo, Andrey Nikolayev, 
commander-in-chief of the Russian Border Guard Troops, expressed 
special concern over the situation at the Azerbaijan section of 
the CIS borders. In Moscow's opinion, Baku does not observe the 
provisions of the Commonwealth Declaration on Border Protection, 
while the republic has long turned into a "sieve" through which 
not only foreign spies but also drugs and arms are getting into 
Russia. At the present moment Baku is considering a draft 
bilateral agreement on border protection presented by Russia (it 
is to expand into a multilateral agreement, with the 
participation of Armenia and Georgia). In all likelihood, the 
draft, which provides for the presence of Russian troops in 
Azerbaijan, will be met with a decisive "sovereign `no,'" timed 
to coincide with the CIS summit. 
  Baku may be just blackmailing Moscow on the chance that it 
will take fright and let up the pressure. Yet another option is 
also possible: Aliyev, faced with the threat of introduction of 
Russian troops, will have nothing more to lose. Moreover, his 
advanced age and deteriorating health (KOMMERSANT-DAILY has 
learned that for this reason he cannot come to the summit but 
instead will send along parliament speaker Rasul Guliyev, who is 
tipped in Baku as successor to the president), can move Aliyev 
to consider that it is time to start thinking of how to go down 
in history as a dedicated fighter for Azerbaijan's sovereignty.

  [Text] All speculations about Azerbaijan's plans to 
withdraw from the CIS, to be announced during the CIS summit on 
April 15, are unfounded, an informed source in the Azerbaijani 
president staff told Interfax, commenting on an article in the 
Moscow newspaper Kommersant (April 8, 1994). 
  "The authors seem to be engaged in wishful thinking. In 
actual fact, Baku's policies differ cardinally form what is said 
in the article. We are planning to work for putting into 
operation the CIS mechanism of curbing external and internal 
aggressors," he said.

<F P=106> ["Azeri Foreign Minister Gasanov Sees Soviet Roots in </F>
Eurasian Union" -- TURAN headline] 
  [Text] Baku (April 9) TURAN -- "If the information spread 
by mass media is correct, then this alliance is not advantageous 
for Azerbaijan", said the Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan, Gasan 
Gasanov during an interview with the newsdaily "MILLET". 
  He further stated that this notion is reminiscent of a 
return 
to the old Soviet structure. "Azerbaijan is an independent state 
and I support complete independence of Azerbaijan and I believe 
that having joined the CIS, the republic's sovereignty has not 
been defied,"said Gasanov. 
  In addition, Gasanov said that he does not exclude the 
possibility that Nazarbayev's proposal could have been 
misrepresented in the media, "Azerbaijan's official position in 
regard to the Eurasian notion can be put forth only after we 
have seen and reviewed Nazarbayev's proposal and idea." 
  As to whether the Russian army would return to Azerbaijan, 
Gasanov noted that "this decision may be solved only by the 
Parliament of Azerbaijan". According to Gasanov, "any 
politician who will deal with matters, alone, must be answerable 
to the people, constitution and the Parliament."

  [Text] As we reported already, Turkmenistan stopped 
supplying gas to Azerbaijan as of 1130 yesterday. 
  [Begin correspondent Nermine Elikhanbeyli recording] After 
having received many warnings, Azerbaijan has finally faced the 
facts. Turkmenistan stopped the natural gas supply to our 
Republic because it wasn't paid for. 
  An Azerbaijani delegation visited Turkmenistan and concluded 
an interstate agreement in February this year envisaging the 
supply of 3 billion cubic meters of gas for 1994. During the 
first quarter of the year, some $50 million of natural gas was 
supplied. According to a clearing agreement, in exchange for 
the gas, our Republic was supposed to send tools used in the oil 
industry, fuel, cooling equipment condensers, and other 
products. But Azerbaijan failed to fulfill its obligation. 
  The state firm Azerigas reported that because the Republic's 
Council of Ministers has adopted no relevant decision, the firm 
is unable to obtain credit and the needed goods. The Council of 
Ministers Finance Department reported that a relevant draft bill 
is being prepared and will be submitted for the approval of the 
prime minister in the coming days. 
  We must realize that we must unfailingly abide by agreements 
if we want to be seen among the ranks of the respectable states. 
We want to note another aspect of this problem. In Baku alone, 
industry owes 2 billion manats and households 9 million manats 
to Azerigas. Failure to pay for the used gas is compounding 
this problem. 
  We would also like to highlight another factor: With its 
60-million population, neighboring Turkey uses only 6 to 8 
billion cubic meters of gas per year, whereas Azerbaijan's 7 
million residents use between 12-14 billion cubic meters of gas. 
Apparently, no one can compete with our wastefulness. [end

  [Text] Baku (April 9) TURAN -- Azerbaijan's Ministry of 
Justice registered a new political party, "Boz Gurd" (Gray 
Wolf). The Chairman of the Party, Bakhtiyar Akhmedov, said that 
the name of the party is an ancient Turkish symbol, which shows 
the unity and integrity of the state. "Our party has nothing in 
common with nationalist party functioning in Turkey". According 
to Akhmedov, "Boz Gurd" is an opposition party but does support 
a political struggle during wartime conditions. 
  "Boz Gurd" calls for new parliamentary elections in the 
country.

  [Text] Baku (April 9) TURAN -- It was announced yesterday 
in the Milli Majlis that in 1993 the State's budget deficit 
totalled 25.1 billion manats, despite the fact that it was not 
supposed to reach 11.7 billion manats. 
  Fikret Yusifov, Deputy Minister of Finance, stated that the 
reason for the high deficit is due to the negative development 
in the economy, the fall in productivity and heightened 
financial crisis. 
  The deputies from the PFA [People's Front of Azerbaijan], 
the 
Musavat party and the National Independence Party urged that the 
government accelerate activities in order to curb the inflation 
and balance prices in the country with the low salaries. 
Discussions about the deficit are to continue next week.

  [Text] Aleksandr Kavsadze, who chairs the Georgian 
parliament's Ethnic Relations and Human Rights Committee, 
expressed the hope that the Moscow agreements of April 4 on 
political settlement in Abkhazia and return of the refugees 
would be honored. 
  He told journalists in Tbilisi Friday, however, that 
unexpected events might take place if the security guarantees 
for the refugees were full implemented. 
  Kavsadze said that this agreement, like the earlier ones, 
could be wrecked but emphasized the need "to try to succeed 
jointly. You don't stop when you go in darkness, torch in hand, 
just because the torch may go out." 
  The Georgian parliament's Deputy Chairman Vakhtang 
Rcheulishvili said that future documents on Abkhazia had to be a 
detailed blueprint for the political structure of the autonomous 
republic. He called for equal rights to be given to all the 
citizens. "If the Georgian and Abkhazian populations are not 
convinced that these rights are guaranteed, there will be no 
peace," he emphasized. 
  Rcheulishvili said that those who had fought on the 
Abkhazian 
side, notably North Caucasian nationals, and seized houses 
belonging to Georgian families "are automatically regarded is 
illegal residents there."

  [Text] Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze told 
parliament Friday that he would take over the talks on the 
settlement of the Abkhazian conflict. He called on the deputies 
not to weaken the position of the Georgian side in the talks by 
continuous fault finding. "If parliament thinks that my action 
is wrong, let us have a vote of confidence," he said. He also 
said that he would probably attend the CIS summit in Moscow next 
week. 
  The Georgian parliament did not approve Tamaz Kvachantiradze 
as education minister. Tedo Ninidze was approved as justice 
minister when Shevardnadze nominated him for a second time.

  [Text] Sochi April 10 TASS -- The first meeting of the 
commission for voluntary return of refugees and displaced 
persons to Abkhazia ended late on Saturday night in Sochi. The 
meeting was held in accordance with the four-side agreement 
signed in Moscow on April 4. A statement adopted at the meeting 
stated the discussion of a program of the commission work, 
including the activities of experts on specific issues. 
  The sides agreed that a mission of the U.N. High Commission 
for Refugees [UNHCR] will come on a working visit to the 
Abkhazian Gali region and areas of temporary accommodation of 
displaced persons "in order to prepare the arrangements on the 
return of refugees and displaced persons". The visit will be 
held before the second meeting of the commission scheduled for 
April 26. 
  The sides confirmed their readiness to abide by principles 
and provisions of the Moscow agreement on voluntary return of 
refugees and displaced persons, proceeding from the fact that 
the return of refugees will be related to the deployment of 
peace-making forces. At the same time, the sides believes that 
preparations for the return of refugees and displaced persons 
must begin immediately. 
  The statement was signed by head of the Georgian State 
committee for Refugees Valeriy Vashakidze, first deputy chairman

  [Text] According to the CONTACT news agency, Georgian head 
of state Eduard Shevardnadze met Muhammad Valavi, the head of 
the International Monetary Fund mission, and experts of the 
mission today, 8 April. The meeting was attended by Deputy 
Prime Minister Teimuraz Bassilia, Finance Minister Davit 
Iakobidze and National Bank President Nodar Javakhishvili. 
  In a way it was a summing-up meeting because the mission has 
completed the first, initial stage of its work in Georgia. 
Mission members have had meetings with members of the Georgian 
Government and representatives of various spheres. They have 
familiarized themselves with the economic situation in the 
country. 
  The head of the IMF mission said that the situation in 
Georgia is far more complicated than he had expected. He 
emphasized difficulties in the financial and credit spheres, 
difficulties due to the local and national budget deficit, and 
impetuous devaluation of coupons. In his opinion, steps to make 
the credit system stricter and to privatize the agricultural 
sector should be considered of primary importance because these 
are areas that are capable of creating the most positive effect. 
  There have been a lot of cases of hyperinflation in the 
world 
but the people have regarded this rationally. Normally, the 
population understands the difficulties of the country and makes 
them part of their life. The head of state said that we [the 
Georgian population] are well aware of the difficult situation 
in the country. The country's economy is paralyzed, and because 
of the combat operations carried out during the past two years 
transport is virtually useless. The Georgian head of state said 
that the Georgian party would certainly implement 
recommendations suggested by the IMF. 
  In conclusion, the head of the mission said that the current 
situation in Georgia is not hopeless and it is necessary that 
the first steps be taken. He also said he was happy that 
progress had been achieved at the Abkhazian-Georgian 
negotiations and hoped this would become a basis for the 
stabilization of the economic and political situation in Georgia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Security Minister Igor Giorgadze by Davit </F>
Gvelesiani; place and date not given: "Give Me a Foothold 
and...."] 
  [Text] Life today is so bad for the republic's 
population that nobody remembers if life has ever been good. 
They "console themselves" with the thought that the refugees 
and those people made homeless are in a worse position than 
themselves. A person could overcome the economic difficulties 
if it were not for the pillage and robbery, murders, terrorist 
acts, and so forth. One gets the impression that 
apparently nobody is any longer capable of establishing the 
peace and order that people long for. However, the republic's 
Security Minister Igor Giorgadze does not share this pessimistic 
view. 
  [Gvelesiani] Batono [Georgian polite form of address] 
minister, you were in western Georgia for almost one month. 
What was the purpose of such a long trip? 
  [Giorgadze] In accordance with the instructions from the 
head of state, I was entrusted with forming a brigade and going 
to western Georgia in order to familiarize myself with current 
processes there and implement effective measures aimed at 
discharging the extremely serious crime situation. 
  From 20 February until 14 March, we were in Poti together 
with the operational brigade, which was carrying out extremely 
complex and labor-intensive work. Accompanying me were special 
units from the Ministry of Security that were conducting 
operations aimed at exposing and seeking reconciliation with 
armed groups. These were not punitive operations. We held 
talks with leaders of armed groups that fought on the side of 
the ex-president and that, until now, have been hiding in the 
forests. It is superfluous to speak about a general 
reconciliation since all those who have been robbing and 
intimidating the peaceful population have committed criminal 
offenses and therefore have to be brought to account before the 
law. The fact that there no longer exists the fear of the 
revival of "Zviadism" in its armed form can be viewed as the 
biggest achievement. We can confidently say today that the fear 
of a new civil war in western Georgia has been eliminated. I 
believe this is due to the work of employees of the Ministry of 
Security and others. 
  For 24 days we held talks with three armed groups. It is 
true that we were unable to achieve reconciliation with all of 
the 160 persons united in these groups. However, the talks are 
continuing and they require prudence, patience, and time. 
Certain members of the law enforcement bodies have themselves 
complicated our work; it has turned out that they have been 
demanding fairly large sums for "reconciliation" from those 
people who have been coming out of the forests with their 
submachine guns. In addition to weapons that have been 
surrendered voluntarily, we have managed to confiscate a large 
quantity of firearms. We have retrieved stolen trucks and 
equipment. However, this is the material side of the trip, 
which I consider to be less important. The main thing is that 
people have declared their trust in our department, and this has 
the greatest social and political importance. 
  [Gvelesiani] The incident that occurred between the heads of 
the two power ministries alarmed the entire republic [bomb blast 
at the Ministry of Security building on 25 December 1993, 
physical confrontations between security and defense ministry 
personnel, including ministers over loss of Abkhazia, disruption 
of signing of military agreement at Ashgabat CIS summit]. How 
has it ended? 
  [Giorgadze] Reason prevailed in the conflict that arose 
between me and the defense minister. The government commission 
has not yet completed its work. I believe it will establish who 
was wrong and who was right. For me, this question was of the 
greatest importance in order to prevent a further aggravation of 
the conflict. This was an unprecedented event in the history of 
the state. If the situation is not cleared up, it could be 
interpreted as an attempted coup. The damage suffered by the 
Ministry of Security is very great. It amounts to 18 billion 
coupons; two employees were seriously wounded and cars belonging 
to the ministry were destroyed during the explosion. I think we 
managed to avoid further complications arising from the conflict 
when armored vehicles and armed persons were brought out onto 
the street in order to seize the counterintelligence building. 
Everything ended in little bloodshed. 
  [Gvelesiani] Batono Igor, the violations in the banking and 
credit and financial system, the misappropriation of 
humanitarian aid, and the removal of raw materials of strategic 
importance from the state leads us to believe that a powerful 
mafia is operating in Georgia. 
  [Giorgadze] For almost two years now, there has been talk 
about violations in the credit and financial system; several 
commissions have been formed and are working; suspects have been 
arrested but, as can be seen, the major criminals have remained 
free, as not a single serious violation in the banking sphere 
has been cleared up. 
  On instructions from the head of state, our ministry became 
interested in this matter. On the basis of investigative 
materials, we arrested the vice-president of the National Bank. 
Given the reaction that this fact has caused among a number of 
senior officials, it can be supposed that we are dealing with 
serious violations whose successful investigation will expose 
all those who sacrificed the country's interests for their own 
gain. 
  The Ministry of Security has been entrusted with forming an 
independent economic service that will be able to control and 
examine violations in the economic and credit systems. However, 
at the moment, we do not have sufficient funds for this. It is 
certain that existing mafia groups have found support both in 
state bodies of administration and in executive power. 
Therefore, the struggle against them and their exposure will 
take a long time. This is a serious problem and the Ministry of 
Security alone will not be able to cope with it. 
  [Gvelesiani] Does the fear exist that Georgia will become a 
transit country for drugs? 
  [Giorgadze] Unfortunately, this process is already under way 
and the international narcotics business, which trades in 
illegal arms and narcotic substances, is interested in our 
territory. The point is that, whereas before, the narcotics 
route from Asia to Europe bypassed the USSR, it now runs as 
follows: eastern Asia -- Pakistan -- Afghanistan -- Central 
Asia -- Azerbaijan -- Georgia. Therefore, Georgia unhesitatingly 
took part in the international conference held in Istanbul on 
the initiative of the Black Sea countries and devoted to the 
problems of the struggle against the narcotics business and 
terrorism. Work in this direction is intensively under way. My 
deputy and a special group are currently in Bucharest, where a 
meeting of special services is continuing at which the latest 
means and methods in the struggle against the drugs mafia are 
being perfected. Incidentally, a sizable amount of drugs has 
already been smuggled via Georgia to Europe. The absence of 
borders and strict customs controls and appropriate legislation 
are complicating our work very much. 
  [Gvelesiani] The view is being spread here and supported by 
high-ranking officials in the power structures that Georgia is 
unable to restore order by itself and, therefore, is calling on 
an external force for help. 
  [Giorgadze] I do not share such a view. Georgia can 
certainly establish order in its own land. This is borne out by 
the recent intensification of the struggle against the criminal 
world and the subsequent positive results that have been 
achieved. 
  The Ministry of Security just like its predecessor -- the 
Intelligence and Information Bureau, was not tasked with acting 
upon information received. One got the impression that we could 
only obtain information while some "distant uncle" would 
establish order for us. Now, the situation is different. Those 
special divisions that make up the power structures of the 
Ministry of Security are well trained and well disciplined and 
composed of young men trained to carry out special operations; I 
believe it is possible to train similar groups in the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs as well. In my view, the power structures 
currently existing in the Ministry of Security should also exist 
in the future in Georgian military formations in the form of 
special subunits. The correct selection of professional cadres 
will enable us to form and train such special subunits in all 
the power ministries that will be able to restore order in the 
country in the shortest period of time. We need more than just 
the desire to do this. We need to create the appropriate 
legislation, material and technical base, and means for this. 
Then, we will no longer be reliant on external help but will be 
able to act entirely on our own. 
  [Gvelesiani] When will the security service's archives be 
made public? 
  [Giorgadze] After Gamsakhurdia became head of state, 
"interest" in the security service's archives exceeded all 
bounds. There were gross violations of the law. I believe we 
should now form a parliamentary commission that will investigate 
and determine how unique material, which was stored for tens of 
years in the security service, was destroyed. Those documents, 
which presented in an "unembellished" form the activities of 
persons in the government, were removed and destroyed. Certain 
unconscientious employees in the security service have used 
archive materials to build their political careers and there 
were also cases of archive materials being sold. There occurred 
a series of serious violations that have to be exposed as a 
matter of urgency. 
  The archives are now again in a sorrowful state; we do not 
have the appropriate storage cases and repository that ensures 
the protection of unique materials. As can be seen, we are 
unable to appreciate what the Ministry of Security archives mean 
for the country's security. There is the experience of other 
countries where, after a certain period of time has elapsed, 
secret documents become available to the public but only if they 
do not compromise the interests of the state. In Great Britain, 
when the time arrived to make public a certain number of 
documents, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher opposed this and 
postponed this measure for, I think, 30 years as the publication 
of this material did not accord with the country's interests. 
  One can say without exaggeration that certain materials in 
our archives could cause another civil war in Georgia. 
Therefore, we should be very careful with archive materials. I 
would like to ask Parliament: True, there are many very serious 
problems to be resolved in the country, but a legislative base 
should be elaborated in the shortest period of time that would 
enable the Ministry of Security and the entire state security 
system to function normally. The existence of laws would settle 
many questions and also strictly define the problem of the 
safekeeping of materials in the archives. 
  [Gvelesiani] Batono minister, the public is alarmed by the 
terrorist acts that are being aimed at certain individuals or 
formations. While pointing out the high professional level of 
the crimes that have been committed, the leaders of political 
parties are clearly pointing the finger at the Ministry of 
Security. The inability to solve these crimes strengthens 
suspicions.... 
  [Giorgadze] It is naive to think about an improvement in the 
criminal situation when there is a huge amount of weapons and 
explosive materials in the hands of the population; against the 
background of the existing chaos in the banking system, we are 
now facing the consequences of the wave of violence perpetrated 
by persons who have become unbelievably rich as a result of 
illegal commercial operations and mafia clans. Groups that have 
been deceived or swindled are settling scores with one another, 
dividing spheres of influence, are often unable to agree with 
one another.... Nothing new or special is happening in Georgia. 
This is a characteristic feature of any capitalist system and 
is being strengthened here with the formation of a free market 
economy. 
  As for those leaders of political parties who often travel 
abroad, they know very well that the problem of terrorism exists 
on a world scale and, in a number of countries, it has been 
raised to the rank of state policy. Therefore, such a naive 
approach to a most important question is embarrassing, as is 
heaping blame on the security service. 
  You often hear the security service being reproached on 
account of its "inaction" -- not a single terrorist crime has 
been solved. I am ready to deliver a report on the work carried 
out to the relevant commission. Provided you do not claim that 
I am trying to justify myself, I would like to give you a few 
examples concerning terrorist acts carried out in Great Britain. 
Between 20 December 1993 and 29 January of this year (in 
London) and between 15 December 1993 and 4 February of this year 
in Northern Ireland, more than 20 explosions took place, causing 
damage to buildings, the subway, houses, and shopping centers. 
There were victims among the law-abiding population. Not one 
of these crimes has been solved! It is also significant that 
this has been taking place in a democratic country that has a 
400-year-old parliamentary tradition, the strongest 
investigative and special services in the world, and a police 
force equipped with the most modern equipment. 
  In our conditions, it is particularly difficult to solve 
terrorist crimes since, apart from our not having the necessary 
equipment, our work is being complicated by other factors. I 
will give you some concrete facts. A terrorist act was 
committed against the "Mkhedrioni" ["Horsemen" -- a legally 
sanctioned armed formation recently incorporated into the Rescue 
Corps] leaders Zaza Vepkhvadze and Gia Svanadze. Our 
investigators were not permitted onto the scene of the crime; 
following an explosion in Rustavi, Temur Talakhadze, the leader 
of the "Mkhedrioni" branch in Rustavi, was killed. The scene of 
the crime was sealed off and we were not allowed there either. 
We were granted access several hours after the event but could 
not find any incriminating materials or other material evidence. 
The same thing happened following the explosion at [Deputy 
Defense Minister] Nikoloz Kekelidze's apartment. Ministry of 
Security employees were only allowed in after the second 
explosion (at that time the heads of the Ministry of Defense 
were examining the scene of the crime). We were able to set 
about our work some 12 hours after the terrorist act had been 
committed. Naturally, we found that all evidence had again been 
destroyed and the scene of the crime had been tidied up. 
  In spite of the aforementioned or other objective or 
subjective reasons, the greater part of these crimes are in the 
process of being solved. At the moment I cannot say any more 
about this. However, we hope that the investigations will soon 
be over and the criminals will be brought to justice. 
Therefore, it is possible to make complaints provided they have 
some substance. We will accept any kind of criticism but 
neither the Ministry of Security nor any self-respecting 
professional will accept something that is undeserved. 
  [Gvelesiani] Batono minister, to what extent is it possible 
to forecast the next terrorist act? 
  [Giorgadze] It is possible to forecast the targets of 
terrorist acts but I believe that making such forecasts is an 
unenviable and ignoble activity. At the same time, it is highly 
risky as the opposing side can use these forecasts to their 
advantage. 
  It is possible that such acts will continue. We know of 
high-ranking officials who accumulated vast wealth during the 
[civil] war. It is expected that they will redistribute spheres 
of influence, which does not exclude the use of violent methods. 
I am convinced that these persons, who, for several days were 
locked up, hungry and thirsty, in "safes," will definitely try 
to pay their opponents back for this. Yes, there have been such 
cases. Those who reckon that the other side has cheated them of 
thousands or millions of dollars, will try to retrieve these 
huge sums by violent means. In clarifying their relations, 
neither side will refrain from shedding blood. 
  [Gvelesiani] Are these terrorist acts perhaps politically 
motivated? 
  [Giorgadze] This also cannot be excluded as there have been 
cases of terrorist acts committed against various political 
parties. There have been explosions at some of their 
headquarters; buildings have been damaged; there have been no 
victims although this has possibly been due to pure chance. 
Incidentally, a political battle implies the use of terrorist 
methods -- in an uncivilized society, of course. 
  I have often said and emphasize once more: In order to 
establish order in the country and put a halt to the wave of 
violence perpetrated by criminal bands, the power ministries 
must have the very latest equipment and, in order to train 
specialists, the state must spend sizable sums of money. 
Otherwise, no one will put a stop to the anarchy and disorder. 
We will not be able to restore the economy without the 
involvement of foreign partners who, precisely on account of the 
criminal situation, are refraining from making any investments. 
  Therefore, I ask the head of state, Parliament, the 
government, and the republic's population to invest immediately 
the necessary funds into strengthening the Ministry of Security. 
  Our salvation is in our own hands!

  [Text] Georgia's Chief-of-General Staff General Guram 
Nikolaishvili says that regardless of all its problems that 
within two or three years, Georgia will have an army with an 
adequate fighting capacity. 
  In Friday's appearance on Georgian television Nikolaishvili 
reported good progress in the efforts to build a national army. 
The top executives of the Georgian Defense Ministry have 
drafted and approved a national military doctrine which will be 
very soon presented for endorsement to the Georgian parliament. 
  According to Nikolaishvili, the Georgian armed forces number 
up to 20,000 men. Instead of calling up reserves, the Georgian 
army practices regular army drafts. Nikolaishvili said up to 
300,000 men in the 18 to 25 age bracket had never served in the 
army. Up to ten army bases were under construction in the 
republic, he added. 
  The army's one big problem was the officers. Nikolaishvili 
explained it by financial limitations. He said a Georgian army 
officer earned an equivalent of 4,000 Russian Rubles a month.

  [Text] Tbilisi 9 April -- An Iberia news agency 
correspondent reports that representatives of the Round Table 
political bloc [supporters of former President Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia] gathered near the Philharmonic Concert Hall today 
at 1300 hours and attempted to hold an unauthorized rally. The 
police dispersed the gathered. Several people were arrested. 
Some of the ralliers marched peacefully towards Rustaveli 
Prospekt to lay flowers at the memorial to those killed on 9 
April [day in 1989 Soviet troops dispersed a peaceful rally 
killing 20 people]. By 1400 hours about 2,000 supporters of the 
former Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia approached the 
House of Government with the intention of holding a rally there. 
The area in front of the Government House was guarded by some 
500 policemen led by Gela Lanchava. 
  The ralliers then went to the Mtatsminda Pantheon and paid 
homage to Merab Kostava.

  [Text] On 9 April, Anatoliy Kovalyov, counsellor-minister 
of the Russian Embassy in Kiev, was summoned to the Ukrainian 
Foreign Affairs Ministry. A note of protest was handed to him 
in connection with the illegitimate actions of the Russian 
survey vessel Cheleken in the vicinity of Odessa. On the night 
of 8-9 April, in gross violation of international law, it 
resorted to violence with the threat of arms and illegally 
seized hydrographic and navigational equipment belonging to 
Ukraine. The fact that people's lives were endangered is 
grounds to qualify these actions of the command of the Russian 
vessel as an international terrorist act. It was only due to 
the balanced stand of the Ukrainian guard that bloodshed was 
prevented. The irony of this bandit action deserves special 
attention. It was carried out on the eve of the celebrations in 
connection with the 50th anniversary of Odessa's liberation from 
the German fascist invaders. 
  The Ukrainian side demands that the seized property of 
Ukraine be returned immediately and those guilty be severely 
punished.

  [Text] Moscow April 11 TASS -- Commander of the Black Sea 
Fleet Admiral Eduard Baltin has described as "actions of 
uncontrollable gangs" the act of provocation which occurred in 
Odessa on Sunday night, when some 120 Ukrainian commandoes 
stormed the Black Sea Fleet's local conservation division. 
  According to Andrey Grachev, the chief of the Black Sea 
Fleet 
press centre, the storming was conducted from 21:00 to 23:00 
[1700 to 1900 GMT] on [10] April. The Ukrainian storm troopers 
arrested Russsian officers Oleg Feoktistov, Dmitriy Starikov and 
Aleksandr Zelyonka. According to the source, the Russian naval 
officers were handcuffed, although their only "offence" was that 
they remained loyal to the oath of allegiance they gave once. 
The other officers and midshipmen of the division were blocked 
by Ukrainian commandoes inside the division base. 
  Grachev said the Ukrainian Navy commander Vladimir 
Beskorovainy was aboard the commandship Slavutich in Odessa at 
the time and his complicity in the action was, according to 
Grachev, beyond doubt.

  [Text] Moscow April 11 TASS -- There are wounded among the 
personnel and children of Russian sailors as a result of an 
assault of the Conservation Division of the Black Sea Fleet, 
deployed in Odessa, by the Ukrainian Special Task Force in the 
evening of April 10. Windows were smashed in the premises of 
the unit, the civilians working there were beaten up and 
transported to the populated locality of Chabana, suburb of 
Odessa, ITAR-TASS learned today in the morning from Andrey 
Grachev, head of the press centre of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  According to Grachev, the room where the division's weapons 
were kept, as well as premises of the secret and financial 
services, were sealed and are now being guarded by the Ukrainian 
Special Task Force. 
  Commander of the Black Sea Fleet Eduard Baltin described the 
incident as "actions of uncontrollable gangs". Russian sailors 
cannot understand how Ukrainian soldiers can be so malicious and 
cruel to their Slavonic brothers. They displayed utmost cruelty 
during the capture of the division of the Black Sea Fleet.

  [Excerpts] Odessa, 11 Apr -- According to the Black Sea 
Fleet press center, about 120 Ukrainian naval servicemen stormed 
the Odessa conservation division of the Black Sea fleet between 
2100 and 2300 on 10 April. [passage omitted] 
  Sources close to Ukraine's Navy headquarters said the action 
was a response to the unlawful conduct by the Black Sea Fleet 
Command Conservation Division 318 and the command of the 
Cheleken hydrographic vessel. The Black Sea Fleet press center 
report on the course of the aforementioned incidents is 
therefore biased and will only aggravate the tension.

  [Text] Sevastopol April 11 TASS -- All facilities of the 
Black Sea Fleet seized by Ukrainian servicemen in Odessa had 
been freed as of 16:00 Monday, a high ranking Black Sea Fleet 
officer quoted Ukrainian Defence Ministry officials as saying. 
  First Deputy Commander of the Black Sea Fleet Vitaliy 
Larionov told ITAR-TASS on Monday that this information is now 
being checked. Black Sea Fleet leaders are still awaiting a 
report from the commander of a squadron of reserve ships seized 
in Odessa. He and his colleagues are also expected to be 
released. 
  Larionov described the incidents in Odessa as unexpected, 
particularly because they occurred when Odessa was celebrating 
the 50th anniversary of its liberation from the Nazi and because 
civilians, including women and children, had been affected. 
Several were injured. 
  "Our task is to ensure calm in the Crimea and Ukraine. We 
are not going to brandish arms, but we must protect our officers 
and their families," Larionov continued. "We could have taken 
more decisive measures, but we decided against it for the 
benefit of Russia and Ukraine as we remembered that the Black 
Sea Fleet is subordinated to both."

  [Excerpts] On 10 and 11 April, Russian mass media reported 
on unusual incidents in Odessa -- an incident with the 
hydrographic ship the Cheleken, and an assault by a Ukrainian 
special task force on a Black Sea Fleet division. [passage 
omitted] We have a live connection with our Odessa correspondent 
Leonid Denysko. 
  [Denysko] A couple of hours ago, First Rank Captain 
Volodymyr Orlov, senior naval chief of the Ukrainian Navy Odessa 
garrison, and First Rank Captain Mykola Arkhypov, Odessa Border 
Ship Brigade commander, held a news conference. There was an 
urgent need to deny the next lie [word indistinct] regarding the 
incident in the port and the events that followed. The reports 
cited a few minutes ago make people feel ill at ease. One has 
the impression that there is shooting in Odessa, that people are 
being handcuffed and abducted. What happened in reality? The 
hydrographic ship Cheleken belonging to the Black Sea Fleet 
shipped foodstuffs for the military contingent in Odessa. Before 
the return journey on the evening of 8 April, the cargo deck was 
loaded with alleged navigation equipment. Given that the ship, 
for some reason, was sailing under the Russian flag, the senior 
naval chief on legal grounds requested that the shipping 
documents be presented. He wanted to know whether there was a 
permit to ship property from Ukrainian territory, and where and 
to whom it was being shipped. The captain of the ship stated 
that Cheleken was Russian territory and that he would not allow 
any inspection. He ordered the crew to cast off. Unarmed 
border guards sealed off the moor. Soon, a group of sailors 
armed with assault rifles arrived at the [word indistinct] 
Odessa Harbor from the 318th Black Sea Fleet Conservation 
Division. They were ordered to secure the ship's departure. 
Cheleken cast off and, threatening an accident, sailed off 
toward the external roadstead. A cutter approached it. Using 
light signals, loudspeakers, and the radio, border guards 
ordered the violators to return to the moor to sort out all the 
circumstances. There was no response. Only due to border 
guards' patience a collision was averted. Escorted by another 
cutter, Cheleken arrived from Sevastopol [as heard] at 1540 
hours on 9 April. 
  To investigate the incident the Military Prosecutor's Office 
subpoenaed the direct culprits, Black Sea Fleet officers 
Feoktistov, Zelenko, and Starkov. They had no individual arms 
so how can anybody speak about disarming those officers? No 
force was used against them. After a talk, Zelenko and Starkov 
were permitted to leave the Prosecutor's Office. However 
Feoktistov, had to be put to bed, because having taken a drop 
too much, he was talking gibberish. Thus, he became the only, so 
to say, victim or hostage in the incident. Regarding any shots, 
there was only a holiday salvo: On 10 April, the hero city of 
Odessa was celebrating the golden anniversary of its liberation. 
It is very sad that this arrogant provocation occurred at such 
a sacred time. Representatives of the 318th division were also 
invited to the news conference, but never showed up. However 
sailors Maltsev, Osadchyy, and Latyshev told reporters that they 
were gotten up by an alarm, given assault rifles and ammunition, 
and ordered to act firmly. Asked by correspondents whether they 
would have opened fire, Latyshev answered: We would not shoot 
at our countrymen. Given that almost 70 percent of the 318th 
Division's personnel voiced their desire to serve Ukraine, an 
order has been issued to transform the division into the 1st 
Brigade for the Protection of the Water Region, subordinated to 
the Ukrainian Navy. ITAR-TASS correspondent in Ukraine Yefim 
Shvartsman and Ostankino reporter Yuriy Kolyvanov who were 
present at the news conference, officially stated that they did 
not send any reports to Moscow regarding those events. This is 
not for the first time that dangerous lies were circulated. 
This means that someone wants to raise a storm in the Black Sea 
Fleet, and to cause a quarrel between the two friendly nations. 
Captains Orlov and Arkhypov asserted that Ukrainian laws had 
not been violated; the situation is under control, regular 
service continues on the ships and in the units.

  [Text] This is Radio Ukraine World Service. Poland's 
Defense Minister Mr. Kolodziejczyk is on an official visit to 
Kiev. He met Ukraine's defense minister, Army General Vitaliy 
Radetskyy. After the conversation, held in a businesslike 
manner, journalist Marat Pohorelov invited both leaders to the 
microphone. 
  [Begin recording] [Pohorelov] Mr. Minister, if this is not a 
secret, what issues have you discussed with the Ukrainian 
defense minister, and what is your vision of the prospects for 
cooperation between Ukraine and Poland in the military sphere? 
  [Kolodziejczyk in Polish with superimposed Ukrainian 
translation] Very serious issues were considered. We met to 
discuss bilateral cooperation between our neighboring states and 
our armies. We were discussing Partnership for Peace and 
exchange of experience between Poland and Ukraine in the field 
of the armed forces. Other issues were discussed during our 
meeting; for example, the political situation in Europe, 
security both on the continent and in our region. We also 
touched upon other issues that our experts will deal with in 
greater detail. This refers to joint exercises in the border 
areas, the antiaircraft defense system, relations between our 
general staffs, and many other issues. 
  [Radetskyy] The meeting with the Polish defense minister was 
planned according to a preliminary agreement; the more so that 
the Polish defense minister has just been appointed. He is a 
(?former) militaryman; an admiral, he graduated from the Academy 
in Leningrad and the Academy of the General Staff. It is very 
easy to talk with him about the problems facing both the Polish 
Army and the Ukrainian Army today. Actually, they are similar. 
  We agreed that our expert groups will work out issues of 
technical, logistical support, [words indistinct] in the 
military industrial complex. 
  I briefed Poland's defense minister on the current state of 
affairs in Crimea and on how this problem is being tackled 
there. The problems facing Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet today 
are complicated. But they need to be solved, to be solved 
consistently. We favor this, but [words indistinct] on the side 
of Russia. 
  [Pohorelov] On the same day, Mr. Kolodziejczyk laid flowers 
at the grave of the Unknown Soldier, met the leaders of 
Ukraine's military-industrial complex, and visited the museum of 
the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945. [end recording]

  [Text] A joint news conference by the defense ministers of 
Ukraine and the Republic of Poland took place in Kiev. Vasyl 
Kukurichka has more details. 
  [Kukurichka] As is known, the Polish National Defense 
Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk was on an official visit in Ukraine 
from 6-8 April. At a joint news conference for Ukrainian and 
foreign correspondents, Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy 
Radetskyy summed up the results of the visit by the high guest 
from the neighboring state. 
  [Begin Radetskyy recording] Mr. Kolodziejczyk visited 
Ukraine 
for the first time ever in his capacity as leader of the 
military department of the Republic of Poland. But contacts 
between our defense ministries at such a level already have a 
certain history. This is the best proof of the fact that 
relations in the military sphere between Ukraine and Poland are 
developing dynamically and fruitfully. 
  The two neighbors have much in common. They have a common 
history and struggle for independence. Today, they share a 
mutual understanding in approaches toward issues of security in 
Europe and the world in general. This is the aspiration to 
democracy, a balanced stand in relation to acceding to new 
European structures, participation in peacemaking forces, and so 
on. 
  A significant number of Poles reside in Ukraine and 
Ukrainians in Poland, which, of course, is nearly the most 
important factor, among others, of the mutual interest in 
developing relations. 
  We regard the Republic of Poland in the new Europe as our 
strategic partner. [word indistinct] that in Warsaw they have 
similar views of Ukraine. For example, President Lech Walesa 
declared that a free Poland is impossible without an independent 
Ukraine. I am pleased to point out that military contacts 
occupy one of the important places in the development of 
relations between our states. They were initiated as far back 
as last year, when the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and the 
Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of Poland signed an 
agreement on cooperation in the military sphere. 
  I believe that the current visit to Ukraine by my 
counterpart 
was fruitful. Throughout the three days the minister had useful 
meetings: with Ukraine's President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk, 
at the Cabinet of Ministers, at the Defense Ministry, at the 
Foreign Affairs Ministry, and at the Ministry of 
Machine-Building, Military-Industrial Complex, and Conversion. 
  There were a number of conversations equally important for 
both our states. Also, the Polish defense minister familiarized 
himself with certain aspects of military construction and 
military personnel training during his visit to the Kiev 
Military Institute of Control and Communication. Having looked 
round the Antonov scientific and technical aviation center, my 
counterpart had an opportunity to familiarize himself with the 
scientific potential of our country. 
  During the visit, we considered quite a few important 
issues, 
from broadening and deepening bilateral military contacts, to 
our states' participation in creating a European security 
system. The latter is important because our states are situated 
in the heart of Europe, therefore stability on the European 
continent and in general depend in full measure on stability in 
this region. 
  Poland and Ukraine were among the first to join the 
Partnership for Peace program. This shows that we are striving 
for sincere goodneighborly relations with all countries 
participating in this project. 
  And the program proposed by the U.S. President makes it 
possible to establish mutually advantageous relations between 
independent states. The minister and I exchanged opinions on 
the partnership program. And I want to emphasize that our views 
regarding their significance and prospects for implementing them 
on the whole coincide. This concerns such issues as joint 
participation in peacemaking operations, standardization of 
armaments, determining military measures and (?forces) with 
regard to participation in this program, tactics, and so on. 
  In general, we are putting a considerably deeper content 
into 
the Partnership for Peace program and view it as a principle of 
European security (?at levels of) mutual relations between 
neighboring states, of regional security, for example in the 
central-eastern part of the continent, and of general security 
as a way of creating a new structure of European security. On 
the whole, the implementation of the Partnership for Peace 
program will, in our view, make it possible to create additional 
conditions to achieve full disarmament and strengthen peace on 
our planet. 
  As far as the prospects for cooperation between the military 
departments of Ukraine and Poland are concerned, they encompasss 
a number of issues. The cooperation plan for this year 
envisages the exchange of delegations and of experience in 
developing armed forces and training of military specialists. 
Work in the field of military equipment is also envisaged. I 
think that during the Kiev meetings with the minister we have 
further deepened relations between our ministries and between 
our countries as a whole. So if military bridges are being made 
and strengthened, this testifies to the healthy and openhearted 
relations between the states. 
  So, may I express my (?certainty) that friendly interest and 
mutual respect will dominate in future relations between Ukraine 
and the Poland. [end recording] 
  [Kukurichka] In his turn, Polish Defense Minister 
Kolodziejczyk noted: 
  [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording, in Polish with superimposed 
Ukrainian translation] I want to emphasize once again that the 
fundamental principle of Poland's foreign policy is to have the 
closest possible relations with neighboring states. Ukraine is 
a very important neighbor for us, if only because our joint 
border is over 500 kilometers long. Your state possesses huge 
intellectual potential, the Ukrainian land contains the 
inexhaustible wealth of useful minerals, and your industry has 
mastered the most complex technologies. [end recording] 
  [Kukurichka] In the opinion of Poland's defense minister, 
relations between our states our good. He confirmed that 
cooperation with Ukraine in the field of modernizing military 
equipment, repairing fighting vehicles and providing them with 
spare parts is of special interest to Poland. Ukraine's and 
Poland's defense ministers replied to a number of questions from 
journalists. This is Vasyl Kukurichka, Radio Ukraine World 
Service.

  [Text] Kiev, As UNIAN reported earlier, Ukraine's Foreign 
Minister Anatoliy Zlenko was in Turkey on 7 April on a one-day 
official visit. In the opinion of Ukraine's Foreign Ministry 
officials, the visit was quite successful. Ways to intensify 
bilateral economic relations were discussed. According to the 
Foreign Ministry, the two sides attach particularly great 
importance to the interaction within the Black Sea Economic 
Cooperation framework, especially the fulfilment of bilateral 
and multilateral cooperation projects in investments, first of 
all in the sphere of infrastructure modernization and 
integration in sea, automobile, and air transport. 
  Turkey is looking for access to the Ukrainian market and 
proposes cooperation in such spheres as metallurgy and metal 
work, food processing, ship-building, carriage and bus 
construction, textiles, sewn goods, cellulose and paper, mining, 
coal, chemical and petrochemical industries.

  [Text] Kiev, 6 Apr -- The working visit to Hungary by Oleh 
Slepichev, Ukraine's minister for foreign economic relations and 
cochairman of the Ukrainian-Hungarian intergovernmental 
commission for issues of trade and economic and 
scientific-technical cooperation, is continuing. During his 
meeting with his Hungarian counterpart, Vela Kadar, the 
ministers discussed their countries' economies, primarily in the 
area of foreign economic links. The two ministers noted that 
the volume of trade turnover between Ukraine and Hungary has 
decreased slightly despite the substantial fall in industrial 
production and the decrease in the volume of Ukrainian exports 
as a whole. The ministers exchanged opinions on the possibility 
of setting up joint working groups to elaborate individual 
directions of cooperation and accelerate the elaboration and 
signing of agreements on cooperation in the field of transport. 
Measures to avoid dual taxation were also examined. 
  During the meeting the two ministers signed a protocol on 
mutual deliveries of goods and provision of services in 1994. 
Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs reports that the next 
session of the bilateral commission is planned for 
August-September this year.

  [Text] Russia may have army bases in former Soviet 
republics only under formal lease agreements. The republics 
where it will have bases are to retain ownership of the leased 
territory and property. A worker on the staff of Ukrainian 
President Kravchuk said that in an interview with Interfax. The 
man preferred to remain unidentified. 
  The Kravchuk Administration felt the naval facilities of 
Sevastopol could be leased to Russia but must still be regarded 
as Ukrainian naval facilities on lease to Russia. If they were 
regarded as Russian property, said the unidentified 
Administration spokesman, the situation would compare to that 
around the Guantanamo base in Cuba. 
  In the meantime, chief Aleksandr Kluban of the Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry's press service told Interfax-Ukraine that the 
deployment of Russian armymen outside Russia was not Ukraine's 
headache. He said Russia had so far made no such proposition to 
his republic.

<F P=106> [By UKRINFORM-TASS correspondent Viktor Kovalenko] </F>
  [Text] Kiev April 8 TASS -- A team of U.S. energetics 
experts, led by Deputy Secretary William White, is exploring the 
possibility of promoting American-Ukrainian cooperation in the 
effective uses of the coal-burning, nuclear and other branches 
of the power industry. 
  White noted on Thurday evening that the purpose of this work 
was to render Ukrainian scientists broader scientific and 
financial support. In his opinion, ways should be sought to 
make up for the 17-19 megawatts that are still being generated 
by the Chernobyl atomic power plant and which account for about 
seven per cent of the total quantity of electricity generated in 
Ukraine. White also pins hopes on cooperation between the 
Ukrainian and American nuclear laboratories in ensuring the 
safety of nuclear power plants, on exchanges of experience in 
the use of alternative sources of electric power. 
  "Today we are thinking how to stop the still working power 
units of the Chernobyl atomic power plant. The turning point 
came when the United States joined our effort to resolve 
Ukraine's power problems," Ukrainian Vice-Premier Valeriy 
Shmarov said during a meeting with White. 
  Shmarov stressed that Ukrainian power engineering 
specialists 
had completed the needed calculations and were ready to hold 
consultations with American colleagues on the commissioning of 
new generating units at the Khmelnitsk and Rovno nuclear power 
plants by 1998 in order to be able to close down the Chernobyl 
plant without any losses. Ukraine also has some technologies 
for raising the effectiveness of coal combustion at thermal 
power plants, but lacks the necessary money to implement them. 
  The question of the exchange of Ukrainian nuclear warheads 
for Russian nuclear fuel was also discussed during the meeting. 
White said that the 60 million U.S. dollars, earmarked to pay 
Ukraine for the nuclear weapons withdrawn to Russia, had already 
been remitted to the corresponding bank account. 
  The sides have agreed to sign joint documents after the 
American experts complete their work and to set up an expert 
commission to draw up proposals for the thrifty use of electric 
power and the needed investments, and a document on cooperation 
in solving problems linked with the Chernobyl atomic power plant.

  [By UKRINFORM correspondent Sergey Kravchenko] 
  [Text] Kiev April 8 -- Deputy head of the Ukrainian 
Environmental Ministry's Nuclear and Radiation Safety department 
Konstantin Rudya categorically refuted today press reports 
claiming Ukrainian extraction and processing of uranium is not 
controlled. 
  "Some would like to force Ukraine out from the uranium 
market 
and make an impression things do not go smoothly in this 
sphere," he said. "In fact, the branch has its problems both in 
Ukraine, Russia, Estonia and other former Soviet republics, the 
problems which were inherited from the semi-classified Soviet 
Ministry of Medium Machine-Building." Rudya stressed the 
republic is correcting the past mistakes. For instance, it is 
creating a system of early warning radiation control and much 
better decontaminates the environment, dumps and tailing dumps 
in the areas of uranium workings.

together with other materials, will be submitted on April 21 in 
The Hague to Van der Stoel, CSCE high commissioner for national 
minorities. They will become a basis for drafting a programme 
of work with the Crimea and specific directions of the

member of the Presidential Council of Russia, told ITAR-TASS 
today. He is now on a working visit in the Crimea as a member 
of the CSCE expert group. 
  Speaking about Russia's policy with regard to the Crimea, 
Payn said that a new conceptual framework, under which the 
Russian-speaking population in the former USSR republics should 
be given assistance, is set forth in President Yeltsin's address 
to the Federal Assembly. "The Crimea is a source of concern for 
Russia as a potential conflict area. Russia is also concerned 
over the fact that Russians and representatives of the nations, 
historically linked with Russia, are living there. The problem 
of the Black Sea Fleet, which is important both for Russia and 
the Crimea, will also be tackled," Payn said.

  [Text] Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Yeveniy Saburov 
believes that Crimea could become a real bridge between Ukraine 
and Russia, but for this to happen good will on the part of 
Crimea has to be accompanied by the willingness of the two 
states. In Saburov's opinion, confrontation between Ukraine and 
Russia is doomed since it has no economic basis. At the same 
time, Russia's friendly attitude to solving Crimea's economic 
problems inspires confidence, the deputy prime minister said at 
a press conference in Simferopol.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Department of Legal Information at </F>
Ukraine's Ministry of Justice and UKRINFORM: "A Warning by 
Ukraine's Ministry of Justice"; date not given] 
  [Text] On 5 January 1993, Ukraine's Ministry of Justice 
registered the World Jewish Agency "Sokhnut" as a public 
organization whose main goal is to assist Ukraine's Jewish 
population in reviving its culture and traditions. 
  Despite the fact that the Agency's statutes clearly define 
the trends of its activity as studying the history of the Jewish 
people, providing assistance in holding Jewish national 
holidays, developing ties with the state of Israel and Jewish 
communities of other countries, the Agency and its head are 
carrying out active work aimed at illegally boosting the 
emigration to Israel, under the pretext of education purposes, 
of the most intelligent, gifted, and physically fit boys and 
girls aged between 15 and 17, so that they would subsequently 
adopt Israeli citizenship and Judaism. We believe that this is 
interference in our state's internal affairs by Sokhnut, since 
the education of Ukraine citizens abroad is regulated by 
interstate agreements or bilateral agreements between 
educational institutions that are only concluded through 
coordination with the appropriate power structures. So far, 
there are no such agreements between Ukraine and Israel. 
  Such activity developed by Sokhnut extends far beyond its 
statutes and is in violation of Ukraine's Constitution and 
Ukraine's law "On Public Associations." 
  In addition, in accordance with information provided by the 
chief of the State Tax Inspectorate in the Kiev City State 
Administration, in violation of the requirements specified by 
Article 24 of Ukraine's law "On Public Associations", Sokhnut is 
not, to this day, registered by the State Tax Inspectorate and 
is evading taxes in foreign currency. It conducts its financial 
operations through small enterprises, in particular, through the 
small enterprise "The Green Theater." 
  On the basis of the above and proceeding from Article 29 of 
Ukraine's law "On Public Associations," Ukraine's Ministry of 
Justice, as a legalizing body, is issuing a warning to the 
Agency for the violations of the law committed by Sokhnut. 
Should such illegal activity continue, the Ministry of Justice 
will consider taking stricter measures, as stipulated by current 
legislation, against the Agency to the extent that it may be 
forced to disband (to be abolished).

  [Text] On 5 April, a group of officers under the 
leadership of Hennadiy Hurin, first deputy chief of Ukraine's 
Ministry of Defense General Staff, visited the Crimea. The aim 
of the visit was to check, as scheduled, the state of affairs 
and to study problems in Ukraine's military units. On that day, 
Hennadiy Hurin visited the headquarters of Ukraine's Naval 
Forces in Sevastopol and ships of the Ukrainian Fleet. The 
group of officers also included Ukrainian presidential adviser 
for military issues Major General Volodymyr Petepko, who visited 
commander of the Black Sea Fleet Admiral E. Baltin in a naval 
hospital. 
  On the same day, Ukraine's first deputy minister of internal 
affairs Colonel General Valentyn Nedryhaylo also visited the 
Crimea. He headed a group of the ministry's officials that 
arrived in order to render assistance in the operational work on 
combating crime. 
  Both the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Internal 
Affairs 
of Ukraine rejected the assumption by a number of mass media on 
Ukraine's alleged flexing its muscles in the absence of 
President Yu. Meshkov [who was on a visit to Cyprus at the time].

  [Text] Sevastopol April 11 TASS - The command of the 
Ukrainian Navy has issued an appeal to the Crimean leadership, 
urging to "protect the military from political games." The 
document said that "Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov is counting 
on the Black Sea Fleet in putting into effect the results of the 
survey, held in the Crimean Peninsula on March 27." The command 
of the Ukrainian Navy is concerned over a possible drawing of 
the armed forces into the implementation of the reform in the 
Crimea. The appeal stressed that the Black Sea Fleet is 
subordinated to the Ukrainian and Russian presidents and that 
citizens of the two fraternal countries are serving there.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol April 8 TASS -- Not counting the Balkans, 
the Crimea is the most militarized place in Europe now, 
according to Valery Kuznetsov, military aide to the Crimean 
president. 
  In a conversation with ITAR-TASS on Friday, Kuznetsov 
pointed 
out that, besides the Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's naval 
forces, around 50 thousand Ukrainian soldiers and officers are 
concentrated on the peninsula. The amount of military personnel 
located here was twice as small before the dissolution of the 
Soviet Union. 
  The presidential aide expressed his doubts in the necessity 
of maintaining such powerful military forces in the Crimea. 
Referring to operational information, Kuznetsov noted that the 
Ukrainian Defence Ministry "plans to increase its military 
presence in the Crimea". 
  The recent sudden visit of Ukraine's military leaders to the 
peninsula caused sharp indignation in the area and a sharp 
retaliatory statement from Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov. 
Similar steps by Kiev, Kuznetsov declared, are not only "a form 
of pressure, but possible training before future actions 
intended to change the situation in the Crimea".

  [Text] Kiev, 8 Apr -- The press service of the Ukrainian 
president and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine today issued a 
statement. It says: 
  In his recent address on Crimean television and at a news 
conference, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov used assessments and 
allegations that deny the expediency and lawfulness of setting 
up a mission of the Ukrainian president in the Republic of 
Crimea. 
  In this connection the press service of the Ukrainian 
president and the Cabinet of Ministers thinks it is necessary to 
remember that the mission of the Ukrainian president in Crimea 
was set up in accordance with the resolution of the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council of 24 February 1994: On the status of the 
Autonomous Republic of Crimea under the existing Constitution 
and legislation of Ukraine, and the resolution of the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council of 17 December 1992: On the procedure of 
putting into force the Ukrainian law on the mission of the 
Ukrainian president in the Republic of Crimea. 
  The setting up of the president's mission in Crimea is not a 
political act, as it is being interpreted by some, but a normal 
legal process of forming appropriate power structures in 
accordance with the Constitutions of Ukraine and Crimea, which 
are intended to ensure cooperation between the bodies of state 
power in Crimea and the central bodies of state executive power 
in Ukraine. 
  Attempts to present the normal process of improving the ties 
between the Ukrainian and Crimean power structures in a 
distorted way do not help at all in creating the businesslike 
atmosphere and stability necessary for economic transformations 
in this Ukrainian region. 
  The press service stresses that by their actions the Crimean 
president and his entourage are not only not assisting in 
developing friendly and goodneighborly relations between Ukraine 
and Russia but are also even trying to bring elements of 
misunderstanding in them.

  [Text] The president of the Ukrainian Autonomous Republic 
of Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov, said, "I haven't had any meetings with 
the envoy of the Ukrainian president to Ukraine, Valeriy 
Gorbatov, and hope I won't as long the Republic of Crimea 
exists." 
  Meshkov said to reporters on Sunday that the situation in 
Crimea might be destabilized before the convocation of the 
republic's legislature, elections to which are underway on 
Sunday along with those to the Ukrainian parliament. "Such 
attempts are being made by the Kiev leadership but have 
fortunately been unsuccessful so far," he said. 
  Meshkov took no part in either round of the Ukrainian 
parliamentary elections (at the first round, he took his ballot 
paper away with him and urged all other Crimean electors to do 
the same). On April 10, he only participated in the Crimean 
elections. 
  Asked about the "war of laws" between Ukraine and Crimea, he 
said, "It isn't a war of laws but Kiev's attempts to make it 
impossible for us to solve our economic problems." "It is my 
strong hope that those who take power in Ukraine will simply be 
reasonable people. That's enough for Crimea," he said.

  [Text] Simferopol, 11 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The Russia Bloc, 
which supports the strengthening of the peninsula's links with 
the Russian Federation, has won an overwhelming victory in the 
elections to the Crimean Supreme Soviet. The second round of 
voting was held on Sunday. 
  Viktor Alsufyev, chairman of the republic's Central 
Electoral 
Commission, said at a news conference in Simferopol this morning 
that 54 out of the 94 seats in the parliament went to the Russia 
Bloc. Four seats remain vacant. 
  Yuriy Meshkov, president of the Republic of Crimea, said in 
an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent that the Russia 
Bloc's victory is confirmation of support for the aims and tasks 
declared by the electoral bloc. 
  The first session of the new Crimean parliament will be held 
May 10. 
  It was also announced at a news conference that the 
inhabitants of Crimea have taken part in elections to the 
Ukrainian Supreme Soviet. Eleven deputies from Crimea out of 23 
were elected.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pilat report under the "Crimea" rubric: "Who Is </F>
More Dangerous for Europe? Tomorrow is the Second Round of 
Parliamentary Elections on the Peninsula"] 
  [Text] Republic of Crimea President Yuriy Meshkov has held 
a press conference in Simferopol. He announced he had had to 
cut short his trip to Cyprus owing to a sharply worsened 
situation in Crimea. First and foremost, Meshkov underlined, 
was the appointment by Ukraine's president of a representative 
to the Republic of Crimea. "One can only regret," Meshkov 
underlined, "there is at the helm of the Ukrainian state at the 
moment the most dangerous government from the point of view of 
continued peace and stability in Europe." 
  Yuriy Meshkov told the journalists that he had repealed the 
Crimean government's decree on raising the prices of bread by a 
factor of 2.3. Crimean Vice Premier Yevgeniy Saburov, in his 
turn, said to the journalists that "if the president puts spokes 
in our wheels, I would be obliged to relinquish the position and 
return to Moscow." More so, the vice premier underlined, 
because already "part of my team has left Crimea because working 
here is not a simple thing." 
  Mykola Myhalchenko, the Ukraine president's adviser, also 
held a press conference in Simferopol. In particular, he said: 
"If Meshkov is stating that today's Ukrainian leadership is 
dangerous for Europe, I would like him to take a look at 
himself. On the contrary, he (Meshkov -- A.P.) is terribly 
dangerous not only for Europe but also for the entire world. 
His ill-advised actions may result in a situation where Crimea 
will become a world hot spot." Myhalchenko said that the Ukraine 
president's representative in the Republic of Crimea would 
oversee the observance of the Constitution and laws of Ukraine 
on the peninsula, in accordance with Ukrainian law. 
  A meeting in support of the president of the Republic of 
Crimea was planned in Simferopol's Lenin Square on 8 April. It 
did not take place because of pouring rain. The further 
situation on the peninsula largely depends on the result of the 
second round of parliamentary elections scheduled for 10 April.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Environmental Protection Yuriy </F>
Kostenko by Oleksandra Oksanchuk; place and date not given: 
"Nuclear Lobby Begins `Rebuilding Communism;'" -- first 
paragraph is VECHIRNIY KYYIV introduction] 
  [Text] The edict by the Ukrainian president from 23 
February "On Urgent Measures To Develop Nuclear Power Industry, 
To Set Up Nuclear Fuel Cycle in Ukraine," which VECHIRNIY KYYIV 
has already reported on, generated many responses and questions 
by our readers. How unsafe will the development of nuclear power 
plants be? The Chernobyl tragedy is still our current problem, 
it has not fallen into oblivion. We asked Minister of 
Environmental Protection Yuriy Kostenko to comment on this issue. 
  [Kostenko] First, I state that this presidential edict was 
adopted without any cooperation with the ministries and 
departments -- the Ministries of Health and Environmental 
Protection, the State Committee for Problems of Consequences of 
the Chernobyl Catastrophe, and the State Committee for Control 
Over Nuclear Power Industry -- which are responsible for the 
state of the nuclear, radiological, and ecological safety. This 
edict is a vivid example of how the executive power -- our 
president -- violates the Ukrainian legislation and is under the 
nuclear lobby's thumb. The edict itself is absolutely 
inexpedient from both economical and ecological viewpoints. 
  I will begin with the economy. A lot is being written and 
said about the nuclear power industry being much cheaper than 
the electric one. As practice shows, electrical energy produced 
by U.S. nuclear power plants is 1.5 times more expensive than 
the energy produced by thermal power stations. Why? In the 
first place, high demands concerning nuclear safety considerably 
increase the costs and main expenses. In the second place, 
companies which own nuclear power plants participate in special 
funds for establishing nuclear waste sites. Third, each nuclear 
plant should be closed down and neutralized after having worked 
to the end of its operating life. To implement these 
conditions, a special fund should be established which will have 
to include tariffs for electric energy costs. Finally, any 
state which has nuclear power plants should establish a national 
nuclear waste site which is an extremely expensive undertaking. 
In the United States, costs for carrying out scientific 
research for drafting criteria for establishing such waste sites 
stood at over $1.5 billion, while building costs of the nuclear 
waste site were estimated at more than $6 billion. 
  One more important point. According to the concept of the 
development of the nuclear power industry in Ukraine, we are 
planning to begin using "KANDU" nuclear reactors produced in 
Canada. They are safer than Russian ones. In addition, they can 
use the natural uranium and we can stop buying the concentrated 
uranium in Russia. Why should we build imperfect reactors? Is 
this advantageous for someone? 
  [Oksanchuk] However, deliveries of Russian nuclear fuel to 
Ukraine is one of the conditions for our disarmament, one of the 
provisions of a tripartite Moscow agreement. Currently, only we 
are keeping to this agreement.... 
  [Kostenko] This is the thing. Although we have delivered 120 
warheads to Russia, we are still waiting for Russian deliveries 
of the concentrated uranium. When the Supreme Soviet discussed 
disarmament issues, the matter of establishing a joint 
enterprise for dismantling armaments and the further use of the 
concentrated uranium for the nuclear power industry was raised. 
This would have been more advantageous for Ukraine than 
obtaining nuclear fuel from Russia. For example, the costs of 
an enterprise -- which "General Electric" promised to build with 
us -- to dismantle ammunition and transform the highly 
concentrated uranium to the low concentrated variety would have 
stood at $25-35 billion. The United States' financial support 
for our disarmament could have been used for this purpose. 
Therefore, it would have cost nothing for Ukraine to set up 
such a joint enterprise. If the Ukrainian nuclear power 
industry begins operating "KANDU" reactors, we will have enough 
nuclear fuel -- extracted from warheads -- for over 150-200 
years. Currently, we give back everything and receive only 
partial compensation which will cover our demands for only 
three-five years. 
  In my opinion, no economic crisis can justify the operation 
of the second Chernobyl reactor. God forbid the next accident! 
Otherwise, this portion of the Ukrainian soil will forever 
become a radiological cemetery. 
  In Zaporozhie, where the sixth nuclear reactor will be put 
into operation soon, the nuclear power plant is located close to 
the thermal electric plant. Discharges from the thermal 
electric plant mix with an enormous quantity of steam discharged 
from the nuclear power plant and cause oxide rains. This region 
which is very important in the production of agricultural 
products is experiencing a serious ecological crisis because 
oxide rains devastate everything. It is necessary to estimate 
what is cheaper -- operating a nuclear plant or producing high 
quality agricultural products. 
  The Rovno nuclear power plant was probably built on 
karstenite cavities. Expenses to underpin the foundation of 
this nuclear plant have already exceeded the planned expenses of 
this site by 40 percent. 
  The aforementioned presidential edict also includes a clause 
which foresees putting into operation a new block at the South 
Ukrainian nuclear power plant. To put it into operation, a big 
reservoir should be built because the low water in the Yuzhnyy 
Bug River does not allow the effective cooling of the reactor. 
This reservoir will cover large territories. This situation 
has already been discussed twice by sessions of ecological 
experts: The first one was held in the time of the former USSR; 
the second one -- recently, by our ministry. Both inspections 
stated the inexpediency of setting up one more reservoir because 
picturesque landscapes will be covered with water and the 
ecological balance will be disturbed. In general, all this can 
lead to the death of the river. The situation will likely 
resemble that of the Dnieper cascade, where reservoirs turned 
into stinking bogs. 
  Therefore, I state that the implementation of this edict 
will 
have one result: Ukraine will be economically ruined and the 
ecological situation in the Republic will be greatly aggravated; 
if we continue operating our nuclear power plants, the 
consequences can become really unpredictable. 
  [Oksanchuk] You opposed and are opposing our president. 
However, I will vote for you and my next question is as follows: 
If my Supreme Council candidate cannot do anything now when he 
is a minister, what will he do in the Supreme Council? 
  [Kostenko] I am sincere: I owe everything that I have done 
within the ministry only to my deputy status. I have always 
opposed anti-ecological decisions. (A minister who opposes the 
government is not welcome there.) Do you remember the situation 
when Lanovyy began opposing the president, and was immediately 
dismissed? I used my deputy status to oppose the passing of the 
anti-ecological law by the government. However, there are 
limits to everything. Currently, it is difficult to speak about 
any results when the state management of the environmental 
protection branch has not undergone any reforms. Reforms will 
be possible when the Supreme Council adopts corresponding 
decisions. Therefore, I am running in the elections because the 
office of the minister does not enable me to proceed with 
ecological reforms. I am pinning my hopes on the new Supreme 
Council which -- if our people make the appropriate choice -- 
will first and foremost think about the future strong and 
independent Ukraine with clean fresh winds and water, green 
forests, and a healthy population.
