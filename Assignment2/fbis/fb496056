<F P=106> [Sergey Tsekhmistrenko report: "Russia and NATO Bomb </F>
Strikes in Bosnia. The Slap in the Face From Partners May Cost 
the `Partnership' Plenty"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The events in Bosnia may 
seriously affect the future of Russian-NATO relations within the 
"Partnership for Peace" program. Although officials at the 
Russian Foreign Ministry have assured your KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
correspondent that Russia's signing of the "Partnership for 
Peace" will take place on the date agreed earlier, neither can 
one rule out a different option. Since the events in 
Yugoslavia, to all appearances, are becoming yet again a factor 
in Russia's domestic political struggle, there is a high degree 
of probability that the Kremlin may opt to postpone the signing. 
Otherwise it risks turning into too comfortable a target for 
the opposition, which is always ready to raise an outcry over 
"the sellout of Russia's national interests." It is not a 
coincidence that even the voice of the most steadfast proponent 
of "Partnership for Peace" -- Andrey Kozyrev -- has acquired new 
undertones. After talks with Javier Solana, chief of the 
Spanish Foreign Ministry, Kozyrev stated that Russia -- as a 
great military and nuclear power -- lays claim to a special role 
within the "Partnership." All the more so because, the minister 
said, Moscow is inclined to see the NATO initiative as just one 
of a number of programs, not the most important one at that, in 
the process of creating a single Europe.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Karpov report in the "Balkans" column: "NATO Hits </F>
the Serbs. Leaving Russia to Reconcile Them With the Muslims 
and the Croats"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The strategic line of Russian 
diplomacy from the very start of the Balkan crisis has been 
based on the postulate, "there are no innocents, all are 
guilty," boiling down to a very simple but at the same time most 
effective "pressure on all sides" formula. It is hard to 
believe that such an approach was shared by the West. Because 
in that event things might not have reached the point of air 
strikes. It would have been fairly easy: The United States and 
the FRG, which have certain influence with the Croats and 
Muslims, exert the same pressure on them as Russia on the Serbs, 
and the issue is settled. In fact, however, something totally 
different happens. Why should the Muslims sit down at the 
negotiation table if they can simply wait until the Serbs are 
showered with bombs, abandon their positions, liberating the 
"vital space" for the enemy, after whose incorporation to the 
territories that are already under its control the subject of 
negotiations itself will disappear? Judging by the statement of 
a Bosnian leader, Ganic, who suggested that after the strikes 
against the Serb positions fire should be moved to their rear 
areas, depots, and communications, the Muslims understand this 
very well. Russia too could be shown its "real place." 
  The latter task, incidentally, is now being tackled by 
anyone 
willing. Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana missed no 
chance, in the course of the Russian Federation president's 
visit to Madrid, to express his satisfaction with the actions by 
NATO aviation, although it is difficult to believe that he is 
unaware of Yeltsin's reaction to Kozyrev's statement in Madrid 
on this issue. 
  The West is apparently little concerned also about the 
internal political complications arising from its actions both 
for the Bosnian Serbs and for Russia. In both countries the 
hawks' feathers have stood on end. It is one thing to hold 
debates with Radovan Karadzic and quite another with Ratko 
Mladic; with professional Russian diplomats or, say, 
"geopoliticians" from the Duma committee of the same name. 
  In addition to Christopher's statements that the United 
States and the Russian Federation have the same goals in Bosnia, 
now even protestations of the West's interest in the success of 
Russia's reform appear dubious. According to PRES leader and 
Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray, subjected to NATO bombing were 
"not so much Serb positions in the conflict zone as the internal 
political situation in Russia." In his opinion, decisionmaking 
in circumvention of it is "a slap in the face of the Russian 
Federation" and, indirectly, "a strike against Russian reforms, 
and a very telling one," which has benefited "the 
national-patriots." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Part" of statement by Grigoriy Karasin, director of </F>
information and press department of Russian Foreign Ministry, at 
news conference in Foreign Ministry press center on 12 April -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Ukraine: A statement by the government of the 
Russian Federation. In the past few days the Ukrainian 
authorities have carried out a series of provocative acts 
against facilities and servicemen of the Black Sea Fleet, which 
have threatened to escalate into armed clashes. 
  On 8 April the Ukrainian authorities used armed force in an 
attempt to take over in the port of Odessa the Black Sea Fleet's 
hydrographic vessel Cheleken, which was carrying out scheduled 
work to service navigational equipment in the Black Sea. In 
order to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, the ship's 
commander showed the Ukrainian representatives the required 
ship's documents. No infringement was indentified. 
  Nonetheless, the Ukrainian side forcefully attempted to 
detain the vessel and to prevent the Cheleken from entering 
Sevastopol. On the night of 10-11 April a unit of Ukrainian 
servicemen numbering up to 120 men seized by force the 318th 
Division of Black Sea Fleet reserve vessels, their shore base, 
communications unit, weapons, and property. The commanders of 
the division, Captain Feyoktistov and Commander Starikov, were 
arrested and taken in handcuffs to the commandant's office. 
  The personnel of the shore station were immediately taken to 
the village of (Chubanka), 10 km from Odessa. Some of the 
personnel of the vessels and members of their families were kept 
isolated on the territory of the division's garrison. During 
the action the servicemen and civilians were subjected to taunts 
and beatings. 
  This action by the Ukrainian authorities is a gross 
violation 
of the understandings between the president of Russia and the 
president of Ukraine on refraining from unilateral actions in 
respect of the Black Sea Fleet until the problem of the Black 
Sea Fleet, all agreements between Russia and Ukraine on this 
issue, and the flouting of the norms of international law, 
including human rights, are resolved. 
  There is no doubt about the provocative nature of these 
actions. The government of the Russian Federation is making an 
emphatic protest to the government of Ukraine in connection with 
such actions and demands the immediate release of the Black Sea 
Fleet servicemen and family members, as well as immediate 
restoration of the status quo in respect of the fleet's 
installations prior to these provocative actions. It demands 
that an investigation be launched and all necessary measures 
taken against the culprits. 
  The government of the Russian Federation stresses that 
Russia's course in respect of Ukraine has been and remains a 
course of friendship and cooperation. 
  May I add to what has been said in the statement that what 
has happened in Odessa is certainly an example of crude, perhaps 
even shameful, methods of resolving things. All the more so 
since we are talking about the one Black Sea Fleet, which is 
under the joint command of Russia and Ukraine. The Russian side 
has as a matter of urgency sent Admiral Feliks Gromov and 
special envoy Yuriy Dubinin to Ukraine with the aim of looking 
into what happened on the spot, with the involvement of the 
Ukrainian side. 
  A whole series of questions arises over this incident. 
First, why did this happen just now? Second, who stands to 
gain from aggravating relations and increasing suspicion between 
Ukraine and Russia? We are convinced of the need for a joint, 
constructive approach to dealing with all the issues which have 
arisen. This is what is demanded by the long-term interests of 
inter-state relations between Russia and Ukraine.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Snoshchekov] </F>
  [Text] Strasbourg April 12 TASS -- A raid on Russian naval 
ships in Odessa should not be viewed as a sign of the conflict 
between Russia and Ukraine. Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of 
Russia's Federation Council, told this a news conference here. 
He stressed that the events had "manifested the will of some 
politicians to capitalise on some differencies between the two 
states in the interests of their own career." 
  The events in Odessa have been above all a manifestation of 
Ukraine's political problems and should not be classed with 
interstate relations, Shumeyko said. He believes that they are 
connected with political manoeuvres of one of Ukrainian groups 
that are ready to go any lengths to prevent a rapprochement 
between Ukraine and Russia. "In any case the incident should be 
approached with calm. There is no need to aggravate the 
situation. The way out will be found," said the speaker of the 
upper house of the Russian Parliament. 
  Shumeyko is staying in Strasbourg at the invitation of the 
Council of Europe at the head of a Russian parliamentary 
delegation that participates in a regular session of the 
parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe.

<F P=106> [Teymuraz Mamaladze report: "Black Sea Fleet Incident Could </F>
Escalate Into Armed Conflict"] 
  [Text] The much-loved naval game of tug-of-war has 
currently taken on threatening overtones in Crimea and the Black 
Sea Fleet. The style of the reporting on the attempted detention 
of the hydrographic vessel Cheleken would have been reminiscent 
of a pirate novel -- had not means been used which were not even 
dreamed of in the days of the "Jolly Roger." The missile-armed 
Su-15 ground-attack aircraft scrambled by the Ukrainian Air 
Defense forces and the high-speed cutters of the Ukrainian 
Border Guards which tracked the ship belong more to a modern 
armed conflict -- which is all the more likely because a Black 
Sea Fleet battle group came out to escort the Cheleken. 
  This time, it seems, God was merciful, or some naval 
official 
had second thoughts. Talks began in Kiev. It blew over. Will 
it blow over the next time, when it is not a taut rope but 
someone's nerves that crack? 
  This protracted Black Sea tug-of-war contest, in which the 
"teams" are battling for the prize of the property and status of 
the Black Sea Fleet units, is accompanied by an exhausting war 
of nerves, largely provoked by the sides' press centers and the 
mass media. Those who claim that unchecked and often concocted 
information (disinformation) works like a slow-burning fuse are 
absolutely right. As Emil Pain, member of the Presidential 
Council, stated in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, 
the appearance in the mass media of Black Sea Fleet situation 
reports that often fail to accord with reality excessively 
aggravates the situation. The demand that any report from the 
region be carefully checked out is undoubtedly correct. The 
trouble, though, is that the speed at which "disinformation" can 
be verified may not coincide with the firing speed of multiple 
rocket launchers. 
  The sides are disseminating mutually exclusive versions of 
events. It seems as though these versions, numbered with 
different figures and painted in different national colors, are 
becoming a kind of infection typical of this time of conflict. 
The news fabric is being woven out of scraps, each of which has 
its own message at odds with the others. Public opinion is 
disoriented. These clashing versions are striking the spark that 
may cause the explosion, after which people will no longer ask 
who gave the order. Before that happens, we should ask who is 
fabricating these explosive reports and to what end. 
  The incident of the Cheleken and the 318th Division of ships 
of the Black Sea Fleet reserve prompts us for the umpteenth time 
to consider the existence of a shadowy influence on big-time 
politics. After all, it is quite obvious that this latest 
"contest" was organized in circumvention and behind the backs of 
the top "referees" -- the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, and 
their agreement to refrain from unilateral action over the Black 
Sea Fleet. People have tried to cut down with the ax of shadowy 
schemes what was written with the pen in Yalta and Massandra. 
As one learned expert on the question has written, there still 
exists -- aside from the patent, obvious, and even specially 
presented picture of political life -- another, hidden intrigue 
of events that is inaccessible to the public gaze and controls. 
  Which in this instance is deadly dangerous. In this 
connection, here is another statement from a man to whom the 
dangerous games over the Black Sea Fleet are of interest since 
they pose a most serious threat to general peace: "A conflict 
between Russia and Ukraine could make events in Bosnia look like 
a Sunday-school picnic." (Richard Nixon).

  [Text] The press center of the Black Sea Fleet has informed 
Interfax about the details of Saturday night's attack by a 
Ukrainian special force on a naval group of conservation ships 
stationed in Odessa. 
  At 22:45 seven Ural trucks carrying Ukrainian paratroopers 
stopped near the Potemkin stairway. 
  They broke the window of the checkpoint, entered the 
territory of the facility and opened the gate. Thirty one 
sailors were detained and 25 persons were taken to Chabanka near 
Odessa. 
  According to the head of the press center Andrey Grachev, 
the 
Ukrainian paratroopers looted the facility taking away personal 
and naval property. 
  Later the Ukrainian Defense Ministry issued an ultimatum: 
officers who fail to take an oath of allegiance to Ukraine by 
20:00 on April 12 will be expelled to any other CIS member- 
country. 
  Grachev also said that at the moment a Black Sea Fleet unit 
in Nikolayev is being besieged. On Monday evening a KRAZ truck 
with the markings of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and soldiers in 
camouflage suits attempted to enter an intelligence unit of the 
fleet. 
  In Grachev's opinion a similarly difficult situation might 
emerge in Izmail garrison where river boats of the Black Sea 
Fleet are stationed. The Deputy Commander of the Odessa 
Military District Lieutenant-General Chernyarenko arrived there 
on Tuesday. After his arrival naval commanders met with a 
representative of the Ukrainian security force and the city 
administration. The local administration was warned that in the 
event of any steps by Black Sea sailors adequate measures would 
be taken. 
  The head of the press center said the three naval officers 
arrested in Odessa were released: the commander of the group 
Oleg Feoktistov, the commander of the base Dmitriy Starikov and 
the chief of staff of the naval group Aleksandr Zelenko.

<F P=106> ["Own correspondent" report under the general headline: "We </F>
Must Not Become Hostages to Expediency. This Is Not in Russia's 
and Ukraine's Interests"] 
  [Text] In the view of Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy 
commander in chief of the Russian Federation Navy, the Odessa 
events amount to "a state armed action aimed against Russia." 
If logic is to be followed, Ukraine, which is trying to justify 
the actions of special purpose unit members, should long have 
commanded "Halt," the admiral noted. Events are unfolding 
further, however; the Black Sea Division has been proclaimed 
"Ukrainian," and by the time Adm. Feliks Gromov, commander in 
chief of the Ukrainian Navy, comes to Odessa, Ukrainian flags 
will be hoisted along with other trappings of "the 
nationalization" of a Russian military unit. This "state 
hooliganism" has also discredited even the date of Odessa's 
liberation, and efforts to seize the hydrographic ship have 
disrupted the navigation security system in the Black Sea, Adm. 
Kasatonov stressed. Arrests and harassment of Russian officers, 
and the sight of children wounded by splinters of broken glass 
were characterized by Igor Kasatonov as "an unprecedented 
action, in which the attacking side just waited for the Russian 
side to fire the first shot."

  [Text] Moscow, April 12 (AFP) -- Ukraine agreed Tuesday 
[12 April] to pay its huge debt for gas deliveries with cash 
payments and by offering Russia part ownership of pipelines and 
other facilities on its territory, officials said here. 
  The head of the Russia's giant Gazprom company, Rem 
Vyakhirev, said following talks here with an Ukrainian 
delegation that Kiev would pay 600 million dollars by June. 
  Ukrainian Deputy Premier Valentin Landik said that Kiev 
would 
privatise gas pipelines, port facilities in Odessa and other 
installations to allow Gazprom to buy stock in the 
newly-privatised companies. 
  Details of the plan have yet to be hammered out and the two 
sides agreed to establish working groups to determine how the 
shared ownership would be implemented. 
  "I guarantee deliveries for the summer," Vyakhirev said, 
adding: "We'll have to wait and see what happens for this 
winter." 
  Russia and Ukraine have been at odds over payment for gas 
deliveries, and the dispute forced Moscow to drastically cut the 
gas flow to Ukraine in March. 
  Gazprom has maintained that part ownership of the pipelines 
would allow it to better control deliveries to its European 
clients including France, Italy and Germany.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Lyudmila Aleksandrova, </F>
Nikita Yermakov, Yuriy Sizov, Vladimir Shekhovtsov] 
  [Text] Madrid April 12 TASS -- "The grateful nation to 
those who gave their lives for Spain." "The aches of the 
victims of the shooting of May 2, 1808 are buried in this field 
where their blood was spilt," read the signs on the obelisk in 
Madrid's Lealtad Square. Russian President Boris Yeltsin, on an 
official visit here, placed a wreath at this historic monument 
on Tuesday morning. 
  The monument was erected to commemorate the shooting in 1808 
of Madrid people rebelling against French invaders. At the base 
of the obelisk there is an urn with the ashes of heroes. The 
obelisk is framed with statues symbolising loyalty, courage, 
virtue and patriotism. 
  The next stage of the programme of the Russian president in 
Madrid was a visit to the Madrid minicipal council. Inspecting 
the guard of honour of the mounted municipal police, Boris 
Yeltsin, accompanied by Mayor of Madrid Jose Alvarez del 
Mansano, entered the building which was housing municipal 
authorities from mid-17th century. The edifice built in a 
severe style with the use of granite, bricks and tiles was 
later decorated in barocco style. 
  After members of the municipal council were presented to the 
head of the Russian state, the guest made an entry in the golden 
book. The mayor of Madrid presented Boris Yeltsin with the 
golden key to the Spanish capital. 
  Expressing gratitude for this gift, Boris Yeltsin said he 
was 
deeply moved by the fact that ordinary people in Spain wish 
success to Russia in its democratic transformations. "This is 
the best evidence that the striving of Russian and Spanish 
politicians to strenthen relations between the two countries 
will be given support of the people," he said. 
  The president favoured the development of Russo-Spanish ties 
in every direction so that "there should be less cool formalism 
and more life and specific useful deeds in it. Both Spanish and 
Russian people will feel cramped by official formalities." 
Boris Yeltsin said "the style of Russo-Spanish cooperation will 
be determined by hospitality, profound mutual sympathy and 
hospitality." 
  He assessed the presentation of the key to Madrid to him as 
a 
symbol of confidence and friendship to the Russian people and an 
evidence of the intention to develop and deepen cooperation with 
Russia. "Accept my assurances that Russians have the same 
feelings for the Spanish people," Boris Yeltsin said. 
  The palace of Cortez where the Congress of Deputies of the 
Spanish Parliament works is situated close to the municipal 
council. The Congress of Deputies is housed in a modest gray 
building. Its walls have witnessed much in a century and a half 
of the building's existence. Relatively recently, on February 
23, 1981, shots fired by military putschists sounded there. 
They tried to take the country back to its former course. The 
attempt at restoring the former regime proved futile.... 
  President of the Congress of Deputies Felix Pons and 
President of the Senate Juan Jose Laborda met the Russian 
president at the gala main entrance and invited him to the 
building. After the presentation of members of the presidiums 
of both houses and of leaders of the parliamentary groups, Boris 
Yeltsin was presented with medals of the Congress of Deputies

Nikita Yermakov, Yuriy Sizov and Vladimir Shekhovtsov] 
  [Text] Madrid April 12 TASS -- There is a certain 
renaissance in the Russian-Spanish relations, Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin told representatives of the two Spanish parliament 
chambers here today. The meeting was held at the Congress of 
Deputies. 
  In the opinion of Yeltsin, intensive bilateral contacts are 
very important as they enable Russia to learn the unique Spanish 
experience of peaceful transition from dictatorship to 
democracy. That transition required profound changes in 
political, social and spiritual life of Spain, it was "a painful 
but wholesome process of revival of the Spanish dignity," said 
the president. 
  The current Russian processes are somewhat similar, he 
noted. 
"Practically every citizen of our state feels how tenacious is 
the past and vices. Russia has covered the first, most 
difficult part of this path," said Yeltsin. 
  When elaborating the new Russian constitution that was 
adopted in universal voting, the Spanish Constitution and its 
experience of the 1970s in the achievement of national 
reconciliation and accord were attentively studied, said the 
president. The Moncloa pact enabled Spain to avoid a collapse, 
create an atmosphere of civilized interaction between major 
political forces and become the basis of stabilization and 
consolidation of civic peace. 
  "Russia needs this as well. We are working to achieve 
interaction between state bodies, political parties and 
movements, public organizations, all influential forces of 
Russia," said Yeltsin. 
  The president stressed the need to develop Russian-Spanish 
inter-parliamentary relations. In his opinion, it should be not 
only exchange of high-ranking parliamentary delegations but also 
contacts of deputies, members of committees and commissions and 
experts. 
  The Russian foreign policy and the Russian approach to 
cooperation with Spain are based on sound patriotism, said 
Yeltsin. "It will do good for the countries and their peoples. 
There is another important aspect -- unification of our efforts 
to solve uneasy problems of modern world," said the president. 
These are, primarily, joint initiatives to settle conflicts 
that alarm Europe and the whole world. 
  In his turn, President of the Spanish Congress of Deputies 
Felix Pons Irazazabal [name as received] said Spain is watching 
with great interest political, social and economic 
transformations in Russia and formation of Russian democratic 
structures and market economy. He expressed the assurance the 
reforms carried out by President Boris Yeltsin will result in 
stability, consolidated democracy and economic improvement. 
  He called for consolidation of Spanish-Russian relations and 
close contacts between the two parliaments.

  [Text] Madrid April 12 TASS -- Asked by ITAR-TASS about the 
significance of the Russian-Spanish treaty on friendship and 
cooperation, Felipe Gonzales said the document is interesting on 
three reasons. 
  Firstly, it continues the Russian-Spanish treaty of 1812. 
Secondly, it establishes legal and political conditions for the 
implementation of other agreements, including those on the 
environmental protection, economy, finances, industries and 
scientific cooperation, which will help to deepen the 
Russian-Spanish relations. Thirdly, the treaty plans meetings 
of Russian and Spanish foreign ministers no less than twice a 
year and a summit no less than once a year. 
  In his turn, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Russia has 
had abnormal relations with Spain. Two big nations with huge 
possibilities had a goods turnover smaller than that with other 
European states. In his opinion, a reason for this situation 
was the absence of a fundamental document - the treaty on 
friendship and cooperation. "The cooperation will now swiftly 
develop," said Yeltsin. 
  Asked about prospects for signing the Russian agreement on 
civic accord, the president said he wants the document to be 
signed on April 28. This idea is basically supported by the 
leadership of the State Duma, the Federation Council, the 
government, the majority of parties and public movements. 
  "That is why, I think the majority will sign the document on 
April 28. Then it will be open for signing to all those 
wishing," stressed Boris Yeltsin.

<F P=106> [Video report from Madrid by correspondent Sergey Dorenko on </F>
news conference given by Russian President Boris Yeltsin on 12 
April, including recorded extracts of Yeltsin remarks -- from 
the "Vesti" program] 
  [Text] [Dorenko] Today President Yeltsin and Felipe 
Gonzalez, chairman of the Spanish Government, summed up the 
results of the Russian president's official visit. Gonzalez 
thanked the visitor for interesting talks and reminded him that 
the new treaty on friendship and cooperation between Russia and 
Spain is a direct successor of the similar treaty of 1812. The 
Russian president said that our ties should be expanded on the 
basis of the treaty. 
  [Yeltsin] On the whole, we used to have abnormal relations. 
Two big states with enormous possibilities have a general trade 
turnover not exceeding 2 percent. This figure is smaller than 
in any other European country. Why is it so? It is Spain, 
after all. 
  [Dorenko] Staying in a NATO member-country, the president, 
naturally, could not fail to discuss the aggravation of our 
relations with the NATO bloc after the Bosnia bombings. 
  [Addressing Yeltsin at news conference] Boris Nikolayevich, 
at the moment you are on NATO's south flank. If NATO continues 
to bomb the Serbs while neglecting Russia's proposals, can 
Russia put pressure not only on the Serbs? Can Russia make 
others heed its views? 
  [Yeltsin] Yes, I think you have worded your question in a 
very correct way. I already voiced my displeasure to Mr. 
Clinton the day before yesterday and have told the Spanish 
leaders here that to sign the Partnership for Peace document 
while there is a kind of discrimination against Russia [changes 
thought], for instance, we are still unable to sign an economic 
agreement with the EEC. We have been eyeing this agreement for 
a whole year but we still cannot sign it. 
  Have we got any any resources for changing the situation? 
I think we have. We were the first to take the correct view as 
regards influence on the Serbs. I am sure, nevertheless -- and 
we have just been discussing it; the chairman, Mr. Gonzalez, 
also agrees -- that the end there must come only through 
political negotiation and not through force. The task there 
cannot be accomplished by means of force. That will be an 
everlasting war. When all's said and done, everyone should 
understand that. If things worsen now, the blame will rest with 
those who took the decision on those three bombing strikes. The 
blame will rest with them. 
  I consider that the statement is very tough and, it must be 
said, serious, including for the President of the United States 
and for NATO. I think that it will change the situation. 
  The main thing now in the situation of Yugoslavia after 
these 
three bombing strikes is to hold the Serbs back from greater 
confrontation and greater military action. And we are now 
making such efforts. Our Deputy Foreign Minister Churkin is now 
constantly with Milosevic. If necessary, Foreign Minister 
Kozyrev will fly there the day after tomorrow to restrain the 
Serbs from greater confrontation. If it proves possible to 
restrain them and to switch once again to the negotiating track, 
to the political level, the level of negotiation, that means 
there will be no more bombing. 
  As regards the linkage with this European, NATO document, 
Partnership for Peace, well, we are not so far making any direct 
linkage. But neither are we in any hurry to sign. 
  [Dorenko] The president said that for him Spain was an 
experiment in civic accord. And here is what Boris Yeltsin had 
to say about the Memorandum on Civic Accord in Russia: 
  [Yeltsin] We intend to sign it on 28 April, and so far we 
are 
not changing this date. Leaders of the State Duma, the 
Federation Council, and the government, as well as most 
political parties and public movements support the memorandum, 
although it is yet to be examined officially. Therefore I 
believe most of them will sign it on 28 April, and after that 
this document will be open for signing by anyone wishing to sign 
it. 
  [Dorenko] And now the president's sensational response to 
questions about the state of his health: Yeltsin invites all 
journalists to attend his medical examination. 
  [Yeltsin] I could wish everyone such health as I have at my 
age. A man who plays a rigorous game of tennis regularly for 
one and a half hours at a time, with professional tennis players 
for partners, a man who swims in the Black Sea in March, with 
the water temperature down just to four degrees -- can such a 
man be of poor health? A man who works 16-18 hours a day, 
practically without weekends -- you can only envy this. The 
communists, of course, are constantly spreading rumors. They 
would like to put me in a bad mood, make up stories -- but all 
this is not serious. Recently, when I read and heard about this 
I said to my doctors: Let us carry out the full one-day medical 
examination this year, in a clinic, witnessed by all the 
journalists wishing to attend. Let as send my blood tests to 
any laboratory, let them investigate how much of what I have in 
my urine, in my [words indistinct due to audience laughter]. So 
that, through all the stages of these clinical tests not just 
Russia but the whole world will know what do I have inside me. 
  And so, I can assure you -- I am not going to Barcelona for 
treatment. This is a planned visit. I will simply meet my 
doctors somewhere in their surgery -- just to thank them once 
again for the splendid operation they performed on me when I had 
some trouble with my spine after a plane crash. It was a 
splendid operation -- hardly anyone in the world could perform 
such an operation as they did. Therefore I will just thank them 
because I am not suffering any after-effects whatsoever. 
  [Dorenko] Tonight the president will meet with 200 Spanish 
entrepreneurs. Tomorrow he will visit Barcelona and return to 
Moscow. All the fresh information you may find in the Russian 
Television Vesti news bulletin.

Nikita Yermakov, Yuriy Sizov, and Vladimir Shekhovtsov] 
  [Text] Madrid April 13 TASS -- "It is not an easy thing to 
establish cooperation with Russia now, but it is a promising 
venture," said Russian President Boris Yeltsin at a meeting with 
members of the Spanish business community on Tuesday. 
  He noted that Russia was reviewing its attitude to the 
international trade system and mechanisms regulating its 
activities, "taking into account, among other things, our 
accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a 
full member". 
  According to the president, this move will meet the 
interests 
of both Russia and GATT member states. Its participation in 
GATT will help to strengthen the multilateral trade system and 
to create stable conditions for the access of foreign goods to 
the vast Russian market. 
  Yeltsin said that the Russian Government is now engaged in 
drafting a new foreign economic legislation. He said that "it 
provides for using the most favoured nation regime, granting the 
national regime to goods from other countries, cutting and 
liberalising customs tariffs as the main instrument of foreign 
trade regulation as well as slashing and repealing later quotas 
and licencing of exports". 
  As a result of talks with GATT, the Russian leader 
continued, 
the sides drafted a memorandum on Russia's foreign trade regime, 
signed a joint declaration on the main principles of relations 
between Russia and the European Community. 
  "Our firm line is to simplify capital investments in 
Russia," 
he stressed. Preferential tax and customs regime will be 
established for foreign investors in many cases. 
  Yeltsin called equality and responsible interaction with the 
EC as a priority area of Russia's economic cooperation with the 
outside world. The main thing here is to complete work as soon 
as possible on an agreement on partnership and cooperation 
between Russia and the EC, he underlined. 
  The agreement will also give an impetus to stepping up trade 
and economic relations with Spain. 
  The question of guarantees occupies a prominent place in 
establishing mutually advantageous cooperation, the president 
continued. The Russian company on investment insurance, 
recently registered abroad, is an important instrument for 
tackling this problem. 
  It was established to insure foreign investors from 
political 
risks. 
  Russian legislation in the sphere of investments will be 
also 
improved, the Russian leader noted. He informed the gathering 
that a Russian-Spanish conference on investments will be held in 
Madrid and Barcelona in May. The Russian round of the 
conference is planned to be held in Moscow in July. 
  "Russia should be both advantageous and predictable trading 
partner," Yeltsin underlined. 
  According to the president, the scale and areas of 
Russian-Spanish economic cooperation are much lower than 
possibilities of the two countries. 
  Spanish firms could participate more actively in setting up 
small and medium enterprises and industrial cooperative 
societies in Russia and could be more active in establishing 
joint ventures, the president said in conclusion.

  [Text] Strasbourg April 13 TASS -- "The first time I came 
to Strasbourg, I said that Russia does not need the Council of 
Europe [CE], and the latter does not need us. But now I have 
familiarised myself with the work of this organisation's 
commissions and committees and feel the vital need for us to 
join the Council of Europe," Deputy Speaker of the Russian 
Parliament Upper Chamber Ramazan Abdulatipov who participates in 
a regular session of the Council of Europe, said in an interview 
with ITAR-TASS here on Wednesday. 
  "On entering the council, we shall get a chance to borrow 
legislative experience of European countries and to check our 
legislation at the same time," he stressed. 
  "Europe has democracy," Abdulatipov continued, "but has no 
(absolute) freedom, while we have (absolute) freedom and no 
democracy. Our `democracy' often makes a flabbergasting 
impression on the West." 
  On entering the Council of Europe, Abdulatipov explained, 
Russian society will limit itself in freedom, the freedom to 
offend and destroy others, to commit lawlessness and suffer from 
bureaucratic omnipotence. Democracy should be strictly governed 
by appropriate laws mandatory for all, he stressed. 
  "The borders of freedom for every man in the West are 
clearly 
delimited, as are borders of private property", Abdulatipov 
noted. But people in the West clearly see not only limits of 
freedom and property but also limits of responsibility. 
  The understanding of this principle is especially important 
for the Russian society, deputy speaker underlined. 
  According to Abdulatipov, the main difference between Europe 
and Russia is that human rights legislation in Western countries 
is built on "the atomistic theory of personality" when the need 
for self-affirmation of an individual is stressed. 
  On the other hand, Russia has developed community traditions 
and it is difficult and not always necessary to wrest people 
from them. 
  Russian legislation should take into account national 
traditions and peculiar features, lacking in the West, said 
Abdulatipov. Therefore, when the Council of Europe envoys come 
to Russia to draw the final conclusions on the possibility of 
admitting it to this organisation, they will have to take into 
account that some inconsistencies with Western legislative 
standards may meet Russian realities of life to a great extent.

  [Text] Moscow April 12 TASS -- "The documents on 
unification of Russian and Belarusian monetary systems signed 
here today are primarily important for the two peoples, we 
removed many obstacles that hampered bilateral relations," 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told correspondents 
here today upon the completion of the document signing ceremony. 
  He said this is the first time two Commonwealth states 
reached such a high decree of integration. 
  In his turn, Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich 
said 
the document on unification of monetary systems was signed by 
the Russian and Belarusian premiers, as well as the chairman of 
the Russian Central Bank. In his words, the chairman of the 
Belarusian National Bank did not sign the treaty as, in his 
opinion, an article of the document runs counter to the national 
legislation. 
  "Belarus is to make the last step -- to introduce 
corresponding changes in the current constitution and other 
legislative acts," said Kebich. The Belarusian prime minister 
stressed the document will start working already now despite the 
fact changes have not been introduced in the legislation. 
  In his opinion, changes can be introduced in the Belarusian 
constitution through a plebiscite or a referendum. He said 
there are no other obstacles on the way of the document. 
  Kebich stressed the two premiers signed the "document on an 
equal basis and proved Belarus do not want to live at somebody's 
expense". 
  Asked about the functioning of the Belarusian National Bank 
and the Russian Central Bank, Chernomyrdin said the documents 
provide for regulation of all credit-monetary policy on the 
common Russian-Belarusian financial space by the only body of 
the Russian Central Bank.

  [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry believes the incident 
caused by a mistake in the presidential resolution on deploying 
Russian military bases in CIS states and Latvia is settled. 
Considering this, the Russian side has not cancelled plans 
Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis' visit to Moscow, and the 
preparation for the visit is going on, a spokesman for the 
ministry, Grigoriy Karasin, told a briefing in Moscow Tuesday in 
an answer to an Interfax question. 
  Karasin pointed out that Latvia had been given the necessary 
explanations by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and 
Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov in the wake of 
the incident. "We can officially denounce this resolution which 
emerged as a result of a technical mistake. However, we do not 
understand Latvia's dissatisfaction with the explanations 
already given," Karasin was quoted as saying. 
  As has already been reported, the Latvian Foreign Ministry 
believes that neither Russo-Latvian summit, nor contacts on the 
level of state delegations are possible until the Russian 
president himself makes a formal denunciation of the resolution. 
  Karasin called on the Latvian leadership to "start making 
real politics instead of fanning up an incident which has 
already been settled."

  [Text] Paris April 13 TASS -- "Fulfilling French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe's personal instruction, French Ambassador 
to the Council of Europe Michel Lennuyeux-Commene officially 
notified Chairman of the Russian Liberal-Democratic Party 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on Tuesday about the impermissibility of 
several of his pronouncements," official representative of the 
French Foreign Ministry Catherine Colonna told ITAR-TASS here 
today. 
  According to Colonna, the official notification was prompted 
by Zhirinovskiy's pronouncements at the Charles de Gaulle 
Airport in Paris and also in Strasbourg. It referred primarily 
to statements made outside the Palace of Europe, where a session 
of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe is now 
under way. Zhirinovskiy came to France to take part in this 
forum. "It is strange to hear such pronouncement from an 
official representative, who should worthily represent his 
country abroad. The Liberal-Democratic Party leader has already 
provoked several incidents since he appeared on French soil," 
Colonna stated. 
  "Zhirinovskiy was told once again that his visa to France 
was 
of a limited nature," Colonna noted. "The French ambassador had 
officially addressed the Liberal-Democratic Party leader, who is 
deputy of the State Duma and member of the Russian parliamentary 
delegation. Zhirinovskiy's claim that he knew nothing about any 
official notification of the french Foreign Ministry is untrue," 
Colonna noted. 
  The non-government Movement Against Racism and for 
International Friendship asked the Human Rights Commission of 
the European parliament to assess Zhirinovskiy's pronouncements 
at the session of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of 
Europe in Strasbourg. A communique issued here by the movement 
expresses its astonishment that the commission "did not try to 
oppose Zhirinovskiy's invitation to Strasbourg" at the time when 
Germany, Bulgaria and France still regard the Russian 
ultra-nationalist leader as a persona non-grata. 
  Chairman of the ultra-rightist National Front Jean-Marie Le 
Pen told a press conference in Paris: "We regret the stand 
assumed by the French Government and believe it is incorrect and 
dangerous to treat a foreign political leader in this way. A 
Russian politician, who is learning the art of democracy, should 
not be condemned."

  [Text] Washington April 13 TASS -- "High-ranking U.S. 
officials are displaying much interest in the continuation of 
Russia's diplomatic efforts in the Middle East and are stressing 
the importance of coordinating actions with us," ITAR-TASS was 
told by Russian envoy to the Middle East talks Viktor Posuvalyuk 
after his consultations with U.S. counterparts. 
  "Much attention during the consultations was devoted to the 
presentation and comparison of the Russian and American national 
interests in the region. In spite of some understandable and 
inevitable differences, we are nevertheless guided by the belief 
that we have a common task to do -- to bring the peace process 
to a happy end, which will contribute decisively to stability in 
the Middle East," Posuvalyuk noted. 
  "The consultations focused both on the Israeli-Palestinian 
talks on self-government in the Gaza Strip and in the Jericho 
area, now under way in Cairo, and on some other directions, 
particularly the Syrian-Israeli relations," he added. "The sides 
have agreed that we should not copy each other's course, but 
should make use of our own means in the pursuit of our common 
goal. We have traditional contacts with Damascus and a definite 
reserve of confidence, which we are striving to exploit in order 
to strengthen bilateral relations and promote the Syrian-Israeli 
dialogue." 
  "Both co-chairmen of the Middle East process are interested 
in the early success of the Cairo talks. We expect them to be 
rounded off by the signing of an agreement already at the end of 
this month. It would have been premature to speak now about an 
early breakthrough in the Israeli-Syrian direction, which is the 
key and very difficult area. But this does not mean that we 
intend to sit on our hands. The visits of PLO chairman Yasir 
'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to Moscow, 
which are to begin on April 19 and 24, are among the most 
important events of the foreseeable future. In addition to 
bilateral relations, accent will be laid on the discussion of 
the situation at the Middle East talks, on Russia's role as 
co-chairman of the peace process," Posuvalyuk stated.

  [Text] Gennadiy Burbulis, president of the Humanitarian and 
Political Center "Strategy," said at a meeting with the public 
in the Central House of Cinematographers that the capture of the 
Kuril Islands was an aggression by Stalin. 
  In his view, Russians should come to terms with the need to 
give these islands back to Japan, sooner or later. 
  In his view, none of the democratic politicians are an 
attractive or constructively uniting figure for the 1996 
presidential elections. For this reason Boris Yeltsin could run 
for reelection under the proviso, however, that he "shows in no 
uncertain terms where his social support lies, seeks support 
from specific organizational/political structures and sheds the 
role, adopted over recent years, of charismatic leader of the 
nation who is supposed to be fully aware of what is going on in 
the nation and can rely on its support at any time." 
  Burbulis said that Boris Yeltsin had a realistic chance to 
become a strong president, a head of state. For his part, 
Burbulis would work for creating a base of support for the 
president. 
  In Burbulis's words, "today Yeltsin remains a major source 
of 
stability in the country and we, while reproaching him justly, 
must give him sufficient backing for our own good." 
  Burbulis said that while the formation of a political party 
by Yegor Gaydar was a historically legitimate idea he also 
believed that this idea led nowhere. 
  He explained that the new party would rely too much on the 
confrontation and denunciation that had worked in the past.

  [Text] Birobidzhan April 13 TASS -- A five-kilometre border 
zone has been imposed along the Russian-Chinese frontier in 
Russia's far eastern Jewish Autonomous Region. 
  Access to the zone is available to local residents and 
people 
with a special permit. Foreign citizens also need to register 
in local departments of the Interior Ministry. 
  The new order of entry to the zone was set up by the 
regional 
administration in accordance with the law on the state frontier 
of the Russian Federation. 
  The border zone has turned recently into a place with high 
criminal activities. A lot of people rushed to the area to 
collect wild hemp used for drug production, to steal 
agricultural products, vehicles and so on. Frontier guards have 
stopped quite a few attempt to smuggle goods by Chinese citizens 
across the Amur River.

  [Text] The CIS Coordinating and Consultative Committee and 
the CIS Council of Foreign and Defense Ministers are holding 
meetings in Moscow today. Traditionally, such events are held 
on the eve of meetings of the CIS heads of state and government. 
In addition to general issues, the delegations arriving at the 
meeting intend to solve their own problems. For instance, the 
Moldavian [Moldovan] delegation plans to sign a number of 
agreements, except military ones. That country is very 
interested in setting up a free economic zone, re-exporting 
goods, and solving the issues of a payment union. Tajikistan 
plans to discuss additional measures to stabilize the situation 
on the Tajik-Afghan border. Kazakhstan's delegation is expected 
in Moscow today, but without President Nazarbayev, to all 
appearances. The agenda of the meeting includes a problem 
raised by Kyrgyzstan. It deals with ensuring the rights of 
those belonging to national, ethnic, language, and religious 
minorities. In addition, President Askar Akayev is to speak 
about the natural disasters in the republic. Russia has given 
the largest amount of aid to the areas hit by landslides.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] According to Interfax sources, the forthcoming CIS 
summit will concentrate on the implementation of the economic 
union treaty. The discussion will begin with the draft 
agreement on Ukraine's membership in the economic union as an 
associated member. 
  The CIS leaders will also consider two cardinally important 
economic documents. The first one is the draft agreement on the 
inter-state economic committee -- a permanent executive and 
coordinating body accountable to the Council of the Heads of 
State and to the Council of the Heads of Government. 
  The second one is the agreement on the creation of a free 
trade zone, providing for a gradual annulment of customs duties, 
taxes and non-tariff limitations. The free trade zone is viewed 
as a transition to a customs union which is to become the 
subject of a separate agreement. 
  The CIS leaders are also expected to discuss a new version 
of 
the provision on the Council of the CIS Defense Ministers, given 
changes in military-cooperation bodies. IF Note: The councils 
of the CIS defense and foreign ministers are to discuss matters 
pertaining to the Collective Security Council, and adopt a 
declaration on this body dealing with financial, 
personnel-related and functional question. The Collective 
Security Council was created in 1993 by the CIS heads of state 
and includes the countries which have signed the collective 
security agreement: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. 
Moldova, Turkmenistan and Ukraine did not sign the collective 
security agreement. 
  A special accent will be put on the problems facing 
Tajikistan. The foreign and defense ministers are to propose 
additional measures to stabilize the situation on the 
Tajik-Afghan border. 
  The Council of the CIS border-troop commanders is to present 
a report on Russia's talks with the Central Asian and 
Transcaucasian states on cooperation in the protection of the 
borders with third countries. 
  The CIS leaders are to sign a memorandum on cooperation 
between Russia, Ukraine and Belarus in protecting these 
countries' borders. IF Note: the draft memorandum says that 
the protection of the borders with the countries which are not 
members of the CIS is these countries' common concern and is not 
aimed at any third countries. This measure is to help Russia, 
Ukraine and Belarus to regulate migration processes and combat 
terrorism, drug trafficking and other trans-border crimes. 
  Commander of the Russian border troops General Andrey 
Nikolayev told Interfax that support given to the Russian 
initiative was a welcome fact. He also announced that Ukraine 
had initialled this document and expressed hope that other CIS 
countries would join it. He noted, however, that the memorandum 
was an outline document and did not contain any specific 
measures or figures. 
  A comprehensive CIS agreement on border issues should be 
gradually drafted, he said, because on their own the CIS 
countries cannot cope with the problem of border protection.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 14 (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's newspapers 
pay attention to the treaty on pooling the Russian and 
Belarusian monetary systems which was signed on Tuesday. The 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes in this connection that 
"Russia's national interests lie, apart from all else, in secure 
and quiet borders. [no end quotes as received] 
  The newspaper notes that under the present conditions when 
the border runs near Smolensk, a situation will be disquieting 
if Belarus is not our friend, let alone enemy. "Any vacuum will 
be filled up at once. Russia should think about its own 
interests. 
  "Belarus will find a way to determine its bearings. It has 
people and structures oriented on Russia. It is with them that 
we shall cooperate. Opponents of reintegration do not sleep 
either. According to the logic of events, they shall make the 
next move." 
  In the opinion of the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper, "we can 
say now with satisfaction that political wisdom of Russian and 
Belarusian leaders is taking the upper hand over considerations 
of secondary importance". 
  The TRUD newspaper stresses that "the signing on Tuesday of 
the treaty on pooling the Russian and Belarusian monetary 
systems is possibly one of the greatest sensations". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA features an article by member of the 
Russian academy of sciences Georgiy Arbatov on Soviet-American 
relations where he notes: "It would be wiser for the United 
States to appraise prospects for relations with Russia not from 
the viewpoint of who occupies what post in the Russian 
Government, of how great inflation or budget deficit is 
(although this can be important for taking a decision on 
credits). 
  "Other things are much more important for policy-makers: 
What 
is happening to the Armed Forces, what policy Russia pursues 
towards the former Soviet republics, what happens to the 
development of democracy and freedom of speech in Russia, how 
open our policy is, what progress is achieved in fulfilling 
disarmament treaties signed with the United States, what 
prospects are for their ratification, etc. 
  "Sure, responsibility for the future of our relations rests 
on both sides." 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an interview with Admiral Igor 
Kasatonov, first deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy. 
Commenting on the events at the base of moth-balled ships of the 
Black Sea Fleet in the Odessa port (Ukraine), admiral stresses: 
"The fact that a Russian officer was handcuffed and beaten up (I 
have in mind Captain Feoktistov and his deputies) is a crude 
violation of human rights and rights of servicemen. "These acts 
run counter to all Russian-Ukrainian agreements. I'm surpised 
that Russian sailors had enough patience not to make a single 
shot. However, some people were clearly waiting for these 
shots." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA features an interview with Moscow Mayor 
Yuriy Luzhkov who claims that "everything Anatoliy Chubays (eds: 
Chubays is responsible for the country-wide privatisation 
programme) is doing, leads the country to its collapse". 
  At the same time, he states that he "has sincere relations 
with President Yeltsin. And I would like to say the following 
thing: I'm loyal to the president. No undercurrents. In future 
too. I do not change sides". 
  The same newspaper runs an interview with former first 
deputy 
chairman of the Soviet KGB Viktor Glushko, describing his 
viewpoint on the abortive state coup in Russia in August 1991. 
  A sensational theft took place at the grand hotel Evropa in 
St. Petersburg, reports the SANKT-PETERBURGSKIE VEDOMOSTI 
newspaper. British national Luizidis Miltas fell victim of 
robbers. 
  They stole his attache case from his suit with 15,000 U.S. 
dollars, six million roubles, a credit card, his firm's seal and 
commercial contracts with Central Asian countries. The Briton 
assessed the value of documents at 17 million dollars. 
  In his opinion, the hotel security service did not take 
adequate measures to prevent the theft. The security service of 
the five- star hotel informed militia of the incident nearly 
three hours later, although the theft was reported at once.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Glazovskaya] </F>
  [Text] Ashgabat 13 April, TASS -- President Saparmurad 
Niyazov of Turkmenistan reiterated that he viewed the functional 
status of the Commonwealth of Independent States as that of a 
coordinating and consultative body. This view will determine 
the Turkmen delegation's attitude towards all items on the 
agenda of the upcoming CIS summit in Moscow, Niyazov told the 
Republic's government last night. 
  In today's exclusive interview with TASS, the Turkmen 
president detailed his approach to the problem of CIS 
functioning, ruling out the possibility of any sub-national 
ruling body. "I am strongly convinced that any alliance of 
states is possible only on a voluntary basis, with economic 
autonomy of member-countries preserved," Niyazov noted. 
"However, this cannot happen overnight but calls for a certain 
period of time which is not to be speeded up by various utopian 
conceptions," he emphasised. 
  The Turkmen leader believes that some advance movement 
towards a new model of the Commonwealth does exist, irrespective 
of the will of all sorts of politicians who "invent new slogans 
instead of going ahead with a laborious negotiating process." 
Recently, in particular at the latest CIS summit in Ashgabat, 
decisions of great importance were made, which are to give a 
concrete shape to the alliance and to pave the way for further 
advance movement, Niyazov stressed. 
  Collective decisionmaking and implementation of these 
decisions is "alpha and omega of the CIS," according to the 
Turkmen president. 
  For further development of the CIS as a new international 
community, member-states should gradually and patiently move 
towards civilized relations and to search for variants 
acceptable to everybody.

surrounded a convoy of lorries of Russian border guards near the

negotiations to end this conflict peacefully.

  [Text] Dushanbe 13 April, TASS -- A conflict caused by an 
incident in the Darvas direction of the Tajik-Afghan border on 
12 April, when a detachment of Pamir militants blocked the 
passage for a Russian motorized convoy, was settled at 1530 
local time Wednesday as a result of talks, ITAR-TASS learned 
from Russian military sources. 
  This provocation was aimed at seizing ammunition carried by 
convoy trucks. Russian border guards managed to block both 
initiators of this action and militants of another group who 
came to their rescue. As a result of a dialogue which continued 
for several hours the road was cleared. 
  According to Russian servicemen, this incident was brought 
to 
the notice of the authorities of the Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous 
region in the hope that they will give an adequate response.

  [Text] Tajikistan leader Emomali Rakhmonov, at the 
forthcoming Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) summit, 
plans to propose restoring and strengthening economic ties 
between Tajikistan and other CIS countries, above all Russia, 
his aide Saidmurod Pattoyev said. 
  Pattoyev told INTERFAX on Wednesday that, before the summit, 
to be held in Moscow, Rakhmonov hopes to meet Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin to discuss the possibility of Tajikistan's joining 
the ruble zone and of strengthening the Tajik-Afghan border. 
  The Tajik leadership hopes to receive assistance to restore 
and stabilize the Republic's economy, ruined by the civil war, 
Pattoyev said. 
  He said Rakhmonov was very interested in Kazakhstan 
President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev's proposal for a Eurasian Union, a 
community of former Soviet republics closer than the CIS. But 
the Tajik leader would make no statements on it before he made a 
detailed study of it, Pattoyev said.

  [Text] The collective peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan 
were established in accordance with a decision taken last 
September by the heads of five CIS states. In October they 
arrived in Tajikistan. By their very presence in various parts 
of the Republic, and especially the first joint exercises they 
held, they have cooled many hotheads who want to change the 
constitutional order in the Republic by unlawful means and to 
destabilize the situation. The crime rate has also improved 
markedly. 
  Unfortunately not all states that signed the collective 
security treaty have fulfilled their peacekeeping obligations. 
The military contingent from Kazakhstan has not arrived in 
Tajikistan at all. The Kyrgyz force has merely staked out its 
presence. The mandate of the peacekeeping forces is about to 
expire. So, what will happen next? 
  [Begin recording of Colonel General Boris Pyankov, commander 
in chief of CIS Joint Armed Forces] The need for them to remain 
here until at least the end of 1994 is obvious because, 
unfortunately, there are potential forces, groupings, groups, 
gangs, and formations, certain forces that are striving to 
breach the peace here, to destabilize the entire situation. [end

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and 
others] 
  [Text] Dushanbe demonstrates "satisfaction" with the 
situation at the negotiations between Tajikistan's leadership 
and Tajik opposition underway in Moscow. On Tuesday the parties 
adopted a joint statement on the necessity "to abstain from any 
actions able to aggravate the negotiating process" and 
"compiled" the agenda; this fact gives the ground for "a 
restrained optimism." Tajikistan's Foreign Minister Rashid 
Olimov voiced this statement in his interview with INTERFAX on 
Wednesday. 
  In his words, "the warming-up" has concluded at the 
negotiations and "the major process" has started. "We hope for 
a breakthrough. Tajikistan's political leadership shows 
appropriate good will to solve all issues constructively," said 
Olimov. 
  He indicated that Tajikistan's Government "has neither 
started nor initiated hostilities." "We expect that the armed 
opposition will demonstrate sound sense and will respond to good 
will," said Olimov. 
  As he said, three major problems are covered in the 
coordinated agenda of the negotiations. "These are cessation of 
hostilities, granting of an additional impulse to the 
repatriation of refugees, and participation of all `Tajiks' in 
the constitutional process within the Republic irrespective of 
their political adherences. We hope for a constructive talk of 
these partners on these issues. Further negotiations will be 
devoted to this," said Olimov. 
  He disagreed with the opinion that the delegations of the 
parties at the negotiations in Moscow "are inappropriately 
represented." "In any case, Tajikistan's governmental delegation 
has all necessary authorities and its composition corresponds to 
the frameworks of the preliminary agreements. As far as the 
opposition's delegation is concerned, it will participate in the 
negotiations in a reduced composition," said Olimov. 
  At the same time he underlined that "it is not so important 
for Tajikistan's leadership who sits opposite but how the 
responsibility for the reached results will be implemented." "We 
do not need negotiations for the sake of negotiations. The main 
thing is that Tajikistan's citizens should feel themselves 
secure," stressed Olimov. 
  Olimov highly appreciated activity of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry and of the special representative of the UN General 
Secretary Ramiro Piriz-Ballon in establishing the inter-Tajik 
dialogue. "As the hostess of the first round of the negotiations 
Russia has done its utmost so that they would be held in the 
atmosphere of constructiveness and the search for mutually 
acceptable decisions," said Olimov. 
  As he said, it's early to speak about the time and place of 
the next round of the negotiations.

  [Excerpts] Saveliy Timofeyevich Pachin, head of the 
Aktyubinsk oblast administration, held a news conference 
yesterday. Sabit Suleymenov, our own correspondent in 
Aktyubinsk, is in the studio there. [passage omitted] 
  [Suleymenov] As is known, of late President Nazarbayev has 
visited the Russian Federation and Japan. These visits were 
reported in the media. Mr. Pachin accompanied the president on 
both visits and he touched upon some of the results of these 
visits. [passage omitted] 
  Journalists asked many questions because the president has 
not held a detailed news conference on all these issues yet. We 
have heard many rumors about this Eurasian union. As far as I 
understand it, the population is not very optimistic about the 
feasibility of this idea although the nonindigenous population 
separated from their historical motherland quite welcome the 
idea. Ethnic Kazakhs do not welcome the idea at all because we 
have just liberated ourselves from the old imperial policy. All 
young states and their indigenous population oppose this idea, 
because Russia still thinks in terms of the old imperialist 
policy. 
  When Mr. Pachin spoke about other agreements discussed with 
Russians, he went into detail on those issues that concern our 
oblast. For instance, he met Russian Economy Minister Shokhin 
and the heads of Orenburg, Chelyabinsk, Samara, and Volgograd 
oblasts and concluded agreements with them on behalf of the 
oblast. 
  For instance, our Aktyubinsk oil production complex delivers 
its products to Orsk refinery, which poses a great problem. We 
give our oil away and then cannot get petrol or fuel. Now an 
agreement is signed. From now on Aktyubinsk will give its oil 
and get petrol and fuel, which is especially important in view 
of the spring sowing campaign. 
  Second, it is an open secret that we have the Kempirsay 
lithium deposit and mine. We have always worked there together 
with Russia. Now preliminary work is being done to set up a 
joint venture with Russia. This rayon also has a coal mine, and 
another joint venture with Russia is already operational there. 
Joint Kazakh-Russian coal development will be further 
invigorated. This is another piece of good news. 
  As far as the Japanese visit is concerned, the journalists 
were interested in possibilities of developing Kazakh-Japanese 
business relations. Of course, these issues have been widely 
covered in the media, but there are some particularly 
interesting aspects. The Japanese are investing their capital 
in all the biggest projects which are currently under way in the 
republic. [passage omitted] In West Kazakhstan, which is rich in 
oil, problems of oil prospecting, recovery, and refinery need a 
great deal of elaboration and the Japanese will participate in 
building the West Kumkol main pipeline. They will invest in the 
oil industry in West Kazakhstan, we were told. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The friendly association of Siberian Cossacks in 
Kazakhstan has forwarded a protest to President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev due to the "soft genocide" with respect to the 
Cossacks living on the territory of this Republic and violation 
of Russian-speaking population rights pursued by the Kazakh 
leadership. 
  The document states that the republic denies the fact of 
existence of a multi-million Cossack population in Kazakhstan. 
The arrest of Boris Suprunuyk, one of the leaders of the 
Russian community in North Kazakhstan who repeatedly spoke 
against the infringement of the rights of the Russian-speaking 
population in Kazakhstan was the major premise of this statement. 
  The document underlined that the Cossacks are ready to hold 
a 
dialogue with the authorities regarding the provisions of 
registration of the Cossack communities and granting an official 
status of a public organization to Cossacks, however, "the 
Republic associates the notion Cossacks with separatism." 
  The statement, in particular, reports that during the 
celebration of a Moslem holiday in the Cossack villages of 
Pokatilovka and Topolevka in the Taldy-Kurgan region the Kazakh 
nationalists destroyed the house of one of the leaders of the 
Cossacks threatening to cut all Cossacks. The interior forces 
blocked these populated centers and nobody was allowed to the 
place of this incident. 
  In order to learn the details of this incident a delegation 
of Cossacks headed for these Cossack villages from Taldy-Kurgan, 
but the employees of the State Road Inspectorate detained them 
explaining this by the need to verify their documents and then 
arrested them for 10 days. 
  On 5 April another 25-strong group of Cossacks again 
endeavored to go to these Cossack villages in order to 
investigate the circumstances of this incident. However, they 
were met by a reinforced militia post and accompanied to the 
city of Sarkand in the Taldy-Kurgan region. On their way to 
Sarkand as many as 50 Kazakh nationalists, 20 mounted and 30 
foot people made an attempt to seize the bus with the Cossacks. 
Some of the attackers had hunter guns. The Cossacks were 
detained in the city, several of them were arrested for seven-10 
days and accused of the organization of an unauthorized meeting. 
  The board of the friendly association and the council of the 
Atamans of the Siberian Cossacks believe that these actions of 
the Taldy-Kurgan region's administration deliberately provoke 
further aggravation of inter-ethnic relations between Russian 
Cossacks and Kazakhs. 
  The statement contains a demand to the Kazakh president, as 
the guarantor of rights and freedoms of the Republic's citizens, 
to adopt urgent measures in order to prevent any demonstrations 
of nationalism and lawlessness with respect to Cossacks and to 
punish the guilty.

  [Text] Tiraspol BASAPRESS, 12/4/1994 -- The 
Chisinau-Tiraspol negotiations reached a new level, one that 
tries to solve economic problems and avoid political ones, told 
BASAPRESS Aleksandr Caraman, the vice president of the 
self-proclaimed Dniester Republic. Referring to the 9 April 
meeting between [Igor] Smirnov and President [Mircea] Snegur, 
Caraman said that if they had discussed merely political issues, 
the negotiations could have failed. He also explained that 
experts of both sides are now elaborating different ways of 
establishing economic relations between the two banks [of the 
Dniester River], especially the cooperation between the banking 
networks, bilateral payment of goods, gas supplies, and so on. 
The Tiraspol leader also assessed that the ratification by the 
Chisinau Parliament of the agreement on [Moldova's] joining the 
CIS will make easier relations between Tiraspol and Chisinau. 
"The dizziness of independence parades is over. Politicians 
have understood that survival will be impossible if we stay 
separate," said Caraman. Referring to the [Ilie] Ilascu case 
[person held prisoner by the Tiraspol authorities], Caraman 
declared that his fate is in the hands of the people [certain 
persons]. "Ilascu or his relatives will have to write a pardon 
demand. If they do not, even Smirnov cannot have the right to 
help him," Caraman said.

  [Text] Stepanakert, April 13 (SNARK)--In connection with 
latest bombardments of the Karabakh towns and villages the 
Government of Nagorno-Karabakh made today an official statement. 
  The statement says that with the connivance of the world 
community the Azerbaijani authorities go on with the war against 
the civil population of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  This morning, the statement mentions, the Azerbaijani war 
planes again and again bombed the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh - 
Stepanakert. As a result of bombardment there are victims, the 
houses were ruined. The war planes also bombed the other 
settlements of Nagorno-Karabakh. Victims also reported. 
  Azerbaijani military aircraft is going on with barbarous 
bombardments. Meanwhile the Azerbaijani leader Geydar Aliyev 
makes cynic appeals to the Armenian population of 
Nagorno-Karabakh to stop the bloodshed assuring the security for 
the Karabakh Armenians. Twice in a period of three days the 
Azerbaijani war planes bombed the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh -- 
the Azerbaijani authorities showed the real truth of their 
false statements. 
  The document the Karabakh Government issued states the 
Karabakh authorities made the Karabakh troops undertake all the 
measures to defend the civil population. Besides, the Karabakh 
side reserves the right to retaliate. 
  The document says the Azerbaijani side is responsible for 
the 
escalation of the tension in the region.

  [Text] Despite substantial losses in men and materiel, the 
Azerbaijani Army subunits are not desisting from attempts to 
break through the defensive line of the Karabakh forces north 
and northeast of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR]. 
  NKR Army headquarters has reported that the Azerbaijani 
formations, supported by air power and armored cars, have been 
attacking Karabakh positions in Mardakertskiy Rayon since this 
morning. 
  In repulsing all the enemy attacks, the Karabakh forces 
launched counterattacks in certain sectors of the front and 
occupied a number of advantageous positions. 
  The NKR air defense forces shot down an Azerbaijani attack 
plane during the battles. Details are being determined. 
  After getting reinforcements, the Azerbaijani troops 
launched 
an offensive against Agdam on the same day. However, they were 
forced to withdraw to their initial positions after suffering 
losses. 
  Having failed on the fronts, the Azerbaijani Army has again 
chosen to launch air attacks against the peaceful settlements of 
the Republic. The Azerbaijani Air Force dropped bombs on the 
residential quarters of the capital of the NKR at 0635 this 
morning. Five residents were killed and nine were injured during 
the raid, mostly women and children. 
  Frederick (Doneli) and Henri [last name indistinct] from the 
French state television and two independent reporters [names 
indistinct] from the United States, who (?were) in the city, are 
ready to confirm the bombing of Stepanakert.

  [Text] Russia continues to stand for the territorial 
integrity of Georgia, but believes that the interests of the 
multi-ethnic population of Abkhazia should be taken into 
account. The point was made by a personal envoy of the Russian 
president, Boris Pastukhov, when he returned to Moscow from 
Tbilisi on Wednesday. 
  In Tbilisi he was received by the Georgian head of state 
Eduard Shevardnadze. The two sides discussed the settlement of 
the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. 
  Pastukhov told Interfax that the main thing at the present 
stage is to guarantee a lasting ceasefire and the beginning of 
the return of refugees because otherwise it is impossible to 
resolve other problems. 
  The diplomat said that unfortunately the probability of the 
resumption of hostilities in Abkhazia is still great. He 
admitted that there are armed groups in the conflict zone from 
Russia but not representing Russia as well as from several other 
countries. 
  Speaking of the need to send a peace-keeping force to the 
conflict zone Pastukhov said Moscow would never oppose the 
deployment of peace-keepers, if the UN Security Council passed 
an appropriate decision. In his opinion there can be different 
options, but in any case a peace-keeping operation requires 
considerable spending. 
  "It is impossible to uphold peace with bayonets, fundamental 
agreements are necessary to prevent the resumption of 
hostilities and they must be observed", Pastukhov emphasized.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>
  [Text] Geneva April 13 TASS -- U.N. and Russian experts 
reconvened in Geneva on Wednesday to discuss military aspects of 
a possible peace-keeping operation in the zone of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. 
  The talks attended by representatives of Georgia, Abkhazia, 
Russia and the United Nations focused on determining the areas 
for deploying U.N. peace-keepers. 
  U.N. secretary-general special envoy Edouard Brunner told 
ITAR- TASS that the U.N. and Russian diplomats are studying 
proposals made by the Georgian and Abkhazian delegations on 
Tuesday. 
  Georgia suggests deploying peace-keepers along the entire 
perimeter of the war zone, including along the Psou and Inguri 
rivers, at mountain summits, along the sea coast and at Sukhumi 
and Bombara airports, as well as in places of location of 
Russian border troops carrying out radar control of the sea. 
  It stressed that U.N. troops' aim will be to prevent 
possible 
resumption of hostilities and check arms shipments and personnel 
reinforcements to the war zone. 
  However, Abkhazia believes that U.N. forces should be placed 
along the Inguri river dividing the warring sides to disengage 
them and prevent penetration of troops into the 6-10 kilometer 
wide demilitarised zone on both sides of the river. 
  Georgian Interior Ministry Commander Vladimir Chikovani told 
ITAR-TASS that his delegation disagrees with Abkhazia's 
proposals. He noted that the deployment of U.N. peace-keepers 
along the Inguri river will not ensure safe return of refugees 
because after passing the "corridor" they will find themselves 
in Abkhazian-controlled territory. In his view, arms supply 
routes can be blocked only if U.N. troops are placed along the 
whole perimeter of the war zone. 
  The talks continue and may take a day longer than was 
planned. Much will depend on the conclusions and proposals of 
U.N. and Russian experts. The group has no power to make 
decisions on deployment of U.N. peace-keeping forces. However, 
its suggestions will be conveyed to U.N. secretary-general who 
will then present them to the U.N. Security Council.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 12 Apr -- In an interview with an IBERIA 
correspondent, Giorgiy Chanturia, chairman of the Georgian 
National Democratic Party [NDP], said an analysis of political 
life in Georgia shows that the forces ruling Georgia, including 
the head of state, have no political will. Eduard Shevardnadze 
only acts as a passive observer of events. As a result, the 
country's political course keeps changing, swinging from 
pro-American to pro-Russian and back, which is ruinous for the 
country. 
  Giorgiy Chanturia said the head of state was committed to a 
doomed policy of personnel balancing in the state structures. 
The notorious incident involving the chief of the Tbilisi 
police directorate, Davit Zeikidze, was a result of that policy. 
The two enemies ended up working in the same system -- the 
Interior Ministry. 
  Giorgiy Chanturia described Shevardnadze's policy as a 
policy 
of the past, saying that Shevardnadze had a choice of either 
being with the mafia or not. Since he lacked political will, he 
had, in fact, become the mafia's hostage. 
  On the issue of the opposition, the NDP leader said it had 
no 
political will either; however, there were definitely some 
outstanding figures in it. The West was now relying mostly on 
three forces in Georgia -- the NDP, the Republican Party, and 
the People's Front, among which, according to Chanturia, the NDP 
had the priority. 
  On the South Ossetian problem, Giorgiy Chanturia said the 
issue was a nuisance for the Georgian parliament, whose deputies 
were involved primarily in buying property abroad and 
accumulating wealth at home. The coolness of their attitude 
towards that issue was demonstrated, for example, by their trust 
in the quadripartite agreement on the settlement of the 
Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. The Abkhaz side had cheated Georgia 
before and would do so again, concluded G. Chanturia.

  [Text] "The government concluded a treaty on the 
unification of the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems in 
violation of the Constitution," stated People's Deputy 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka during a news conference on 13 April. 
"They will soon raise a question about the Supreme Soviet 
changing the basic law. However, they should be dismissed from 
their posts for violating the Constitution." 
  A. Lukashenka is sure that the amendments to the 
Constitution, stemming from the just-signed treaty, will not be 
adopted by the Supreme Soviet. This will give ground for the 
government to blame parliament for being unwilling to cooperate 
in the process of integration between Russia and Belarus. In 
his opinion, the document signed on 12 April is (?worse) than 
that signed in September 1993. First of all, this document does 
not resolve the primary issue -- common prices for energy 
resources in both countries. "Such a ruble zone is devoid of 
all sense, because Belarusian goods on the Russian market will 
not be competitive due to their much higher prices," Lukashenka 
noted. In his opinion, the signing of the treaty on the 
unification of the monetary systems will somewhat add to 
Kebich's chances of winning the presidential elections, but 
there is still enough time for people "to sober up and see who 
is who." 
  Touching upon the upcoming presidential elections, 
Lukashenka 
stated that recently "a pressure on those supporting Lukashenka 
has begun." This pressure is exerted "primarily by the 
government and Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb." 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka reported that the group supporting him 
today numbers some 1,000 people; the majority of them are young 
people, veterans of the Afghan war, and representatives of 
working collectives.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mechyslaw Hryb, chairman of Belarusian </F>
Supreme Soviet, by Valeriy Kovalev under "Interlocutor of the 
Day" rubric; place and date not given: "We Are Interested in 
Union With Russia. We Do Not Conceal This Fact"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Visiting Card </H5>
  Mechyslaw Ivanavich Hryb, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of 
the Republic of Belarus. He was born in the village of Savichi, 
Dyatlovskiy Rayon, Grodno Oblast, in 193? [precise date 
illegible]. His father died at the front in 1945. He graduated 
from the Lvov Fire Technical School of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. Later he graduated by correspondence from the law 
faculty of the Belarusian State University and worked in 
internal affairs organs. His last post before being elected a 
deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus in 1990 
was as chief of Vitebsk Internal Affairs Administration. In 
parliament he headed the Standing Commission on National 
Security, Defense, and the Fight Against Crime. 
  He was elected to his present post 28 January 1994. He is a 
lieutenant general in the reserve. 
  [Kovalev] Mechyslaw Ivanavich, your election to the post of 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belorusia [Belarus] came as a 
surprise to many people. Moreover, you won in a contest with 
two other aspirants who had, as they say, a clear advantage.... 
  [Hryb] Quite honestly, the voting results came as a surprise 
to me too. I was not burning with a desire to take up the post 
of Supreme Soviet chairman, realizing perfectly well what a 
heavy burden this would prove to be, given the situation that 
had taken shape in the Republic. When my candidacy was proposed 
at a session of the Supreme Soviet Presidium, I refused 
categorically at first. But members of the Presidium persuaded 
me to run, and my deputy colleagues supported me by voting for 
me. After that there was no getting out of it, and I had to get 
down to work.... 
  [Kovalev] It has to be thought that you are familiar with 
the views of certain of the mass media on your election. In 
particular, IZVESTIYA viewed the replacement of the Belorusian 
parliament's leadership as a "quiet," procommunist, nomenklatura 
coup.... 
  [Hryb] These are nothing but journalists' fabrications. We 
have had no coups -- neither quiet nor noisy. The majority of 
the deputies simply elected in a legal, constitutional manner 
the person whom they evidently trust more. In all parliaments 
in the world a representative of the majority is elected 
speaker, not one of the minority. If he suddenly stops 
expressing the opinion of this majority, someone is elected in 
his place. Then again, any coup, if one really takes place, 
pursues the aim of changing the former course. But we still 
abide by all the previously concluded treaties and agreements, 
and we still intend to build a market economy and a democratic 
state. It is only to be regretted that individual journalists 
invent something that does not, in fact, exist. 
  [Kovalev] All the same, Mechyslaw Ivanavich, how would you 
define your position in the political spectrum? 
  [Hryb] I am not now a member of any parties, movements, or 
factions. I adhere to a firm principle: Party membership and 
excessive political blinkeredness might affect the objectivity 
of judgments and decisionmaking by the state's top official. I 
am ready to cooperate -- I say this sincerely -- with 
representatives of any trends, ranging from extreme 
right-wingers to extreme left-wingers, if they have an equally 
sincere wish to work in the name of the Republic's interests. 
My aim is to find accord and to reach a consensus, although I 
realize that it is a supercomplex task to unite left- and 
right-wingers, but it is possible and necessary to seek a 
compromise when resolving individual questions -- within the 
bounds of what is reasonable, of course. 
  [Kovalev] The adoption of the Republic's new Constitution 
was, to a certain extent, confirmation of the correctness of 
your position. Contrary to predictions, the constitutional 
process, which had long been marking time, has gotten moving. 
Although, as far as I know, both the parliamentary opposition 
--the Belorusian People's Front -- and the communists' faction 
had serious objections to many points in the Fundamental Law.... 
  [Hryb] Yes, there were many disagreements -- fundamental 
ones, too. It is probably immodest to view this as being to the 
personal credit of the Supreme Soviet chairman, and yet I 
believe that I succeeded in convincing the majority of deputies 
that there must be no more delay: The Republic cannot go on 
living without clarity in the state system. 
  [Kovalev] The new Constitution is a very long document, and 
it is hard to evaluate it in a few words. And yet.... 
  [Hryb] I believe that we have adopted a normal democratic 
constitution of a normal democratic state. It was worked on for 
more than two-and-a-half years. During that time it underwent 
more than one expert juridical appraisal, including abroad, when 
it was confirmed that it complies with international legal 
norms. Human rights take pride of place in the Constitution, 
the state system of Belorusia as a sovereign, unitary, social, 
legal power is clearly defined, and the powers of the 
legislature, the executive, and the judiciary are separated. I 
believe it is destined to have a long life. Of course, certain 
changes might be made -- there are no limits to perfection -- 
but it will hardly be necessary to alter the spirit of the 
Fundamental Law cardinally. It accords with the interests of our 
society and with the aims we have set ourselves. 
  [Kovalev] However, significant and important an event for 
Belorussia the adoption of the new Constitution was, it does 
not, alas, push into the background the many very acute problems 
which the country has encountered. What, in your view, is the 
root of the troubles? Why does the Republic, which always stood 
firmly on its feet, now find itself in such a complex situation? 
  [Hryb] The main reason is obvious: the breakup of the former 
Union. Name just one Republic where people are prospering 
today. There are difficulties everywhere, problems everywhere. 
Therefore, I find it hard to agree with the assertion by the 
former speaker of our parliament, who declared recently that he 
was proud of his involvement in signing the agreement at 
Viskuli. I believe, however, that, since the Soviet Union was 
fated to die, it was necessary to do everything possible to make 
that process less dramatic and less painful. To go our separate 
ways with the smallest losses in the economy, to maintain ties, 
to adopt clear pledges, not to try to survive at the expense of 
others. Unfortunately, it all happened according to the worst 
scenario. We have what we have. But what is the point in 
grieving? We must seek the way out of the present situation. 
Nobody will do this for us. 
  [Kovalev] On what do you pin hopes of a better future for 
the Republic? 
  [Hryb] Above all, on our people, who are sensible, 
competent, calm, industrious, and patient. I very much hope 
that they will not have to resolve all their problems on their 
own. We do not conceal our vital interest in union with Russia. 
Our countries are very closely linked in all spheres, and our 
peoples have regarded each other as brothers from time 
immemorial. Even if we take a purely pragmatic look at our 
ties, then -- and this is a fact -- more than 70 percent of all 
the industrial output produced in Belorussia is delivered to the 
east. Who, now or in the very near future, could take Russia's 
place as our trading partner? 
  [Kovalev] But Belorusian national radicals are being heard 
to say that such a one-sided orientation threatens a loss of 
sovereignty for the Republic and its transformation into a 
virtual colony of Russia.... 
  [Hryb] This talk is groundless. Let us investigate. Does 
the Russian leadership really impose political terms on us? No, 
we are talking of an economic union, of which there are many in 
the world. Incidentally, those who believe that integration is 
advantageous to our country alone are mistaken. Pardon me, but 
Russia is also interested in Belorusia in terms of many 
parameters. True, we hardly have any of our own energy sources, 
and we have few raw materials, but we are in an advantageous 
strategic, geopolitical position, and there is transit of gas, 
oil, and huge freight flows via our territory. Russia needs the 
output of our enterprises, including defense output. So we are 
not poor relations, and we build our ties with our eastern 
neighbor on an equitable, mutually advantageous basis. 
Regarding political unification, which allegedly threatens our 
sovereignty, there have been and are no top-level talks on this 
topic. Russia does not encroach upon Belorusia's independence 
-- I state this unequivocally. The precise conclusion of an 
economic union between our states is now on the agenda. The 
unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belorusia must 
be the first step toward this. Unfortunately, this is a very 
protracted matter. 
  Finally, it is necessary to decide: What is to be done 
now? If it is not possible to sign the treaty in its entirety, 
let us bring it into force in sections, on which the sides have 
already reached accord. For example, on lifting customs 
barriers and on tax policy, if this does not work, it means that 
it is necessary to draw up a new text of the agreement. Just 
one thing is inadmissible: to sit idly by and watch the 
destruction of the age-old ties between our peoples. Our 
descendants will never forgive us for that. 
  [Kovalev] Mechyslaw Ivanavich, with the adoption of the new 
Constitution the first presidential election clearly looms 
ahead. Who, in your view, might win it? 
  [Hryb] I believe that the candidate for those forces which 
represent the majority in the present parliament is most likely 
to win. I will refrain from a more specific prognosis, for the 
official registration of candidates is still to come. 
  [Kovalev] Do you intend to run for the presidency? 
  [Hryb] I have not yet decided. I must give serious thought 
to everything and weigh it up -- it is too crucial a step. 
  [Kovalev] Do you not exclude the possibility that a 
representative of the Belorussian People's Front might attain 
presidential power? You will agree that in that case 
Belorusia's foreign policy priorities might undergo serious 
changes -- the opposition has never concealed its anti-Russian 
sentiments.... 
  [Hryb] I do not believe that this will happen. Any 
realistically thinking politician must reckon with the fact that 
the majority of the republic's population pins its hopes of a 
better life on Russia. Therefore, attempts by any of the 
contenders to play the anti-Russian card during the election 
campaign are doomed to fail. The people will not support such a 
politician -- I am sure of this. 
  [Kovalev] Before being elected to the post of Supreme Soviet 
chairman you headed the parliamentary Commission on National 
Security, Defense, and the Fight Against Crime. You are now ex 
officio chairman of the Republic's Security Council and supreme 
commander in chief of the Armed Forces. How would you rate the 
condition of the national army today? 
  [Hryb] In my view we have succeeded in creating perfectly 
battle-worthy armed forces. Their reduction and reorganization 
have taken place and are taking place strictly according to 
plan. The process of reforming the army will be virtually 
complete by 1 January 1995, and it will attain its optimum 
strength of approximately 100,000. This does not mean, however, 
that there are no problems in military organizational 
development. The chief problem is the shortage of funds to buy 
hardware, arms, fuels and lubricants, spare parts, ammunition, 
and much besides that the troops need. The situation is 
complicated by the fact that the enterprises that exist on the 
Republic's territory are now able to meet only approximately 3 
percent of hardware and armament requirements and to repair just 
2 percent of the more than 4,000 existing models of these. In 
this connection the question of close cooperation with other 
countries -- with Russia above all -- in the military sphere is 
once again thrown into sharp relief. This is the very reason 
why I always advocated Belorussia's subscribing to the CIS 
Collective Security Treaty. 
  And yet, despite the considerable difficulties, I hope that 
we will succeed in maintaining the combat potential of the 
Belorusian Armed Forces at the proper level. Even under the 
present complex conditions we have not allowed the curtailment 
of the training process in the armed forces. Measures are being 
taken to enhance the prestige of military service and 
servicemen's social protection. Work has begun on creating a 
military academy in the interests of resolving the Army's 
personnel problems. 
  [Kovalev] But approximately 25,000 servicemen of Russia's 
Strategic Forces are also stationed on the Republic's 
territory.... 
  [Hryb] I am sure that Russian officers and soldiers do not 
feel out of place on Belorusian soil. None of us will ever call 
them occupiers. Incidentally, we are not raising the question 
of an accelerated Russian troop withdrawal -- here everything is 
proceeding according to the agreed schedule, with due regard for 
the wishes of the Russian side. The Belorusian Ministry of 
Defense has established good, comradely ties with colleagues in 
the Russian military department. I hope that this will continue 
to be the case. 
  I would like to take this opportunity to send very best 
wishes to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's readers and to the editorial 
collective. Your newspaper seeks to provide objective and 
balanced coverage of events occurring in our Republic and in its 
Armed Forces. This is valued highly nowadays.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] The heads of Belarusian and Russian Governments 
signed a package of eight documents Tuesday [12 April] leading 
to the setting up of a monetary union of the two countries. The 
most important of them is the treaty on the merger of their 
monetary systems and on the functioning of the joint monetary 
system. 
  Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich told journalists that the 
treaty did not infringe on the interests of either country. He 
emphasized that it was a treaty of equal partners. 
  Kebich admitted that the National Bank of Belarus did not 
quite approve of the documents. One of the articles of the 
treaty is inconsistent with the country's Constitution saying 
that only the National Bank had the right to print money and 
issue credits. Kebich said that this article would be amended 
accordingly. 
  Kebich said that if two-thirds of the Belarusian parliament 
did not approve the Moscow agreements, the government might call 
a referendum on the issue. In his words, the signing of the 
package marked the end of a marathon. 
  IF Note: Kebich wants the referendum to be held 
simultaneously with the June 23 presidential elections. He told 
INTERFAX that, according to sociological polls, a majority of 
the country's population supported a monetary union with Russia. 
Kebich is said to stand a good chance of winning the 
presidential race. 
  A high ranking government expert told INTERFAX that the 
treaty would have a significant impact on the presidential 
elections. He thought that the attitude towards the merger of 
the monetary systems would be the dividing line in the 
elections. He thought that a favorable political environment 
was necessary for the merger. 
  The expert did not rule out the possibility that in the 
aftermath of the presidential elections the new political 
leaders of Belarus would make a political statement on the 
merger. 
  IF Note: The merger will proceed in stages. At the first 
stage which would start on 1 May 1994 Russia will lift customs 
duties in trading with Belarus. Minsk will reciprocate with 
lifting the payment of all kinds of transit duties on Russian 
goods and will let Russia use strategic military bases on 
Belarusian soil. At the second stage, which is expected to 
start after the presidential elections in Belarus, the assets 
and liabilities of the Central Banks of Russia (CBR) and the 
National Bank of Belarus will be merged. Only the CBR will 
operate as a bank of issuance. Within certain limits Belarusian 
citizens will be able to exchange the national currency for 
Russian rubles.

  [Text] The chairman of the Popular Movement of Belarus 
[NDB], Syarhey Haydukevich, has publicized a statement relating 
to the NATO air attacks on Serbian positions in the area of 
Gorazde. The statement reads: "The Popular Movement is 
indignant at the flagrant aggression launched by the U.S. 
military against fraternal Slavic Serbia under the UN banner. 
We lodge a resolute protest against this action, which 
threatens the entire world with catastrophe." The NDB demands a 
stop to "the destruction of the proud and fraternal-to-us 
Serbian people," as well as lifting of the economic blockade on 
the Socialist [as received] Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, 
which brings about "incalculable losses to Belarusian economy 
and trade." The NDB also demands that the Belarusian Government 
establish diplomatic relations with the Socialist Federative 
Republic of Yugoslavia, and that Belarusian representatives to 
the United Nations introduce a resolution banning the use of 
armed forces in crisis spots around the world.

<F P=106> [Interview with Alyaksandr Pawlavich Hretski, deputy </F>
chairman of the Department of Prices, by unidentified reporter; 
place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Now I will speak about the issue which 
concerns us all. This key issue is prices for products. We 
would like them to drop, especially at the time when [words 
indistinct] the minimum wage grew twice, including some other 
payments from the state budget. However, prices for 
agricultural products do not even compensate for production 
costs. This is the subject of our talk with Alyaksandr 
Pawlavich Hretski, deputy chairman of the Department of Prices. 
  [Hretski] Since January 1992, all industrial output, public 
works and services have been issued to the agricultural sector 
free of charge. These prices are constantly growing. First and 
foremost, this is connected with our Republic using enormous 
amounts of gas, electricity, oil, metal, grain, and other raw 
materials which are being chiefly imported from Russia and other 
states. Naturally, (?we) cannot set the prices for these 
products. For example, in 1993, the price for one tonne of oil 
increased from 27,500 rubles [R] to R450,000; of 1,000 cubic 
meters of natural gas -- from R16,600 to R116,700; and of one 
tonne of grain -- from R96,000 to some R2 million. As a result, 
the 1993 index of price increases for material and technical 
resources consumed by the agricultural sector stood at 3,776 
percent. Prices for mineral fertilizers increased by 3,928 
percent, electricity -- by 9,211 percent, fuel --by 3,554 
percent, and wheeled tractors -- by 3,381 percent. As for 
agricultural produce being sold at prices set by the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Foodstuffs, their level increased by only 1,229 
percent in 1993, representing 178 percent of the nonparity of 
prices [nieparitet tsen] or R964.6 billion. 
  [Reporter] The government is doing everything to protect the 
population. 
  [Hretski] The government adopted a range of measures aimed 
at 
improving this situation in 1993. These steps include lowering 
prices for material and technical resources delivered to the 
agricultural sector. In addition, the agricultural sector was 
supplied with electricity and oil at lower prices than the 
industrial sector. Purchase prices were regularly increased. 
Nevertheless, the results of 1993 show that our agricultural 
sector did not receive almost R400 billion in compensation. Due 
to this, the profitability of agricultural production in 1993 
stood at only 3.3 percent. The profitability of meat production 
stood at 4.8 percent, in particular, production of pork at 13.6 
percent, beef at 0.7 percent, and poultry at 6.7 percent. Milk 
profitability was reduced by 6.2 percent. To my regret, this 
tendency has remained the same this year. As of 1 April 1994, 
the total sum of price increases for resources that are 
delivered to the agricultural sector stood at R4.3 trillion. 
Prices for oil products increased by R1.374 billion. Oil 
products, mineral fertilizers, and the increase in wages for 
workers of the agricultural sector account for the biggest 
proportion of these increases. In this regard, the increase in 
purchase prices for agricultural products became inevitable. 
For example, on 6 April, purchase prices for all kinds of meat 
were increased by 30 percent, for milk -- by 40 percent. 
However, this permitted only R2 trillion in compensation, or 
46.3 percent of costs in the agricultural sector. The remaining 
sum was transferred to crop production and [word indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] This cannot help but affect retail prices. 
  [Hretski] Of course. Such increases in purchase prices for 
meat and milk cannot but affect retail prices for products 
traded at free prices. For example, prices for meat -- poultry, 
beef, pork, sausages -- have already increased. Retail prices 
for dairy products are still untouched. To do this, prices for 
vodka were raised by R2,000 per bottle. Indeed, we receive 
complaints from our citizens that it is impossible to buy dairy 
products because they are being smuggled abroad. In my opinion, 
the increase in prices for these products with corresponding 
social protection measures would have been justified. 
  Summarizing my report, I would like to urge the working 
collectives of our industrial enterprises to decrease prices for 
produce, which is being delivered to the agricultural sector. 
This will return a hundredfold when we have cheaper 
agricultural products on our table.

  [Text] [Announcer] The news from Tashkent is connected with 
bank notes: 
  [Ganiyeva] A new decision by the cabinet has been published 
in Uzbekistan. The decision stipulates that bank notes issued 
by the Central Bank of Russia will no longer be accepted for any 
form of payment anywhere in the Republic from 15 April onward. 
However, commercial organizations and enterprises, as well as 
private individuals, will be allowed to sell goods and services 
for freely convertible currency. Exchange rates between the sum 
coupon, the national currency, and foreign currencies will be 
fixed in regular auctions at the Uzbek currency exchange, 
bearing in mind the need to maintain parity between prices on 
the domestic and foreign markets. 
  In order to establish a gold and hard currency reserve in 
the 
country, all enterprises, irrespective of their form of 
ownership, will now be obliged to sell the Central Bank 30 
percent of their hard currency earnings. From 1 May, all 
Uzbekistan's settlements with CIS countries will be transacted 
solely through clearing or in freely convertible currency.

  [Text] Legal suits demanding 1.5 Bn [billion] rubles in 
total for the protection of honor and dignity were brought by 
the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy against Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, St. 
Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak, the State Duma deputy Yegor 
Gaydar, and retired KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin, 
Zhirinovskiy's lawyer Sergey Belyak reported to Interfax on 
Wednesday. 
  In his words, the statements of these people addressed to 
Zhirinovskiy "touching upon his honor and dignity and inflicting 
moral damage" are the major reason for these claims. In 
particular, during the pre-election campaign Gaydar compared 
Zhirinovskiy with Adolf Hitler. In addition, there were 
assertions that Zhirinovskiy "is an agent of special forces and 
the work of the KGB." 
  As Belyak reported, the greatest sum, totaling 500 Mn 
[million] rubles is requested from Yegor Gaydar. According to 
Belyak, Zhirinovskiy explains this by the fact that "such 
statements made many electors "afraid of his candidacy." The 
rest are proposed to pay 300 Mn rubles each. In addition, the 
newspaper KURANTY which published several statement which 
allegedly belonged to Zhirinovskiy was being sued for 100 Mn 
rubles. 
  In his conversation with our Interfax correspondent Belyak 
inidicated that "such great sums" are explained "by the 
infectiousness of a bad example," to quote Zhirinovskiy. He 
pointed to Aleksandr Rutskoy who also brought claims against his 
political opponents. "The need of appropriate monetary funds to 
repair the office" is the major reason for "the moral damage's 
compensation" because Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
"refused to render any material aid on this issue," said Belyak.

  [Text] As of today, the deputies' group The Union of 12 
December has lengthened its name and become the 
Liberal-Democratic Union [Liberalno-Demokraticheskiy Soyuz]. 
Explaining this decision, Boris Fedorov, the leader of the 
union, told our correspondent: We are liberal and we are 
democrats. We have simply taken a long time to see who we are 
in the political spectrum. Many options were discussed, and we 
decided that this one is the most appropriate. Incidentally, 
the Russia's Choice had similar discussions, but they became 
frightened. We believe that if we are liberal democrats, we 
should not hide it. All we are doing is returning the true 
meaning to the title of liberal democrats.

  [Text] "The crisis in the Russian economy and society has 
reached its apogee and the country is approaching a period of 
instability," leader of the Russian National Assembly Aleksandr 
Sterligov declared at a press conference on Wednesday in Moscow. 
  In his opinion, "one cannot rule out social cataclysms in 
the 
near future." Under this situation, Sterligov indicated, the 
RNC deems it possible to create a Russian Power Union bloc as an 
association of the opposition "which could participate in the 
presidential elections if they take place." In his words, in 
the near future the RNC intends to create "a national council -- 
a kind of council of the Elders -- which would proceed with the 
consultations with different opposition forces to coordinate 
their positions and to form a single bloc." "We addressed 
Varennikov, Achalov, and Starodubtsev with a proposal to form 
such a council," said Sterligov. 
  As he said, "one should agree to the president's idea on 
national accord, however, this accord cannot be reached as a 
result of adopting one act." "Public recognition of serious 
mistakes on the part of the president and his circles and their 
resignation could be a step on the way to national accord in 
society," stressed Sterligov. 
  He indicated that "for their part, the opposition forces 
could publicly take pledges to ensure stability in society and 
to rule out any political persecutions." "Russia must reject the 
present system of elections which has recognized its bankruptcy 
and start formation of a power structure at a `Zemstvo 
Assembly'," declared Sterligov. 
  As he said, "the first `Zemstvo Assembly' should be convened 
in 1996 instead of elections scheduled for this time." Sterligov 
pointed out that delegations of Russia's territories and regions 
representing different strata of the population would be able to 
elect new power structures and, probably, abolish the institute 
of the presidency.

  [Text] Today, passions raged outside the U.S. embassy in 
Moscow. Members of the Liberal Democratic Party and other 
citizens picketed the embassy to protest against NATO's bombing 
in Bosnia. Red and St. Andrew's flags fluttered over the crowd, 
while the U.S. flag was torn up by the pickets, and despite 
attempts by the militia to save the United States' national 
symbol, the remnants were burnt. Previously, there had already 
been demonstrative burnings outside the embassy. On Tuesday, a 
$1 bill was the victim of fire. 
  The POSTFACTUM agency has reported new information about 
today's protest. According to it, the law and order bodies 
arrested (Zhukov), a representative of the Russian-Serbian 
Friendship Society; and (Kosimov), the first deputy chairman of 
the Russian National Assembly, was beaten up.

  [Text] Dissatisfied with the mild statement of the State 
Duma on the situation in Bosnia, approximately 20 radically 
inclined deputies -- Aleksandr Nevzorov, Anatoliy Lukyanov from 
the Russian Way group, Vyacheslav Marychev of the Liberal 
Democratic Party, and others -- decided to hand in their own 
appeal to the U.S. ambassador in Russia on Wednesday evening. 
Expressed in it is, and I am quoting: profound indignation at 
the barbaric bombing by NATO aircraft approved by President Bill 
Clinton. The statement also contains the demand, and I am 
quoting again, that: The illegal operation be investigated 
immediately and NATO troops be withdrawn at once from the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Now about the television air time situation. The 
Russian Finance Ministry, in the person of Acting Minister 
Sergey Dubinin, and the Communications Ministry, in the person 
of Vladimir Bulgak, are forming an interesting alliance. These 
two official representatives of the Cabinet of Ministers are 
considering reducing the amount of television broadcasting to 20 
percent. Does this mean that our blue screens will be mostly 
silent? 
  What is interesting is that Western television companies 
from 
time to time tell us that they are being offered spare air time. 
In general, it is not too hard to guess where the remaining 
spare air time will go and who will be offering it. It remains 
for us to rely on the common sense of the Russian president and 
prime minister, who should understand that deprived of 
television, they will lose control of the country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Melnikov, head of the Central Bank of </F>
Russia's Main Administration for Currency Regulation, by 
Vladimir Kucherenko; date, place not given: "`Fantastic' 
Deposits in the Land of Fools. What Is Behind Promises of 
Fantastic Interest Rates"] 
  [Text] We are literally hypnotized by the advertising of 
various banks and firms. They attract our money by promising 
staggering interest rates of 40, 50, and 60 percent in hard 
currency -- no Western banker can promise that! We spoke about 
this to Viktor Melnikov, head of the Central Bank of Russia's 
[CBR] Main Administration for Currency Regulation. 
  [Melnikov] I think that you can obtain megahigh profit 
ratios in Russia by using money in deals that go beyond the 
confines of banking legislation. In particular, this may 
involve trading operations via dummy firms. This is an 
extremely risky business: You can either become fabulously rich 
or lose everything. Reputable banks that top the ratings do not 
do this, nor do they promise investors crazy profits. 
  [Kucherenko] However, everyone is now complaining that it is 
not profitable to export from the country: Prices in Russia are 
close to world levels. What is the reason for these interest 
rates then? 
  [Melnikov] You cannot even imagine how many organizations 
have now won the right not to pay taxes and to export goods 
dutyfree. Control over the use of these concessions is, 
moreover, extremely lax. It is generally public or charitable 
structures that are the fortunate ones. And we do not know 
whether this trade benefits the disabled, for instance, or 
whether it is an overused cover for commercial enterprises which 
can quite easily make high profits if they do not pay duty and 
tax. [Melnikov ends] 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA File: The presidential administration's 
Control Administration noted 20 January that the government does 
not have information about how export quotas and concessions 
granted to organizations and enterprises are used. A curious 
example was cited. The Moscow Branch of the Children's 
Foundation gave its concessions to the "Silk Route" firm to 
conclude a purchase deal -- in return for 1 percent commission. 
  [Kucherenko] There is the opinion that it was not the banks 
but structures involved in financial operations without banking 
licenses that started the race to see "who could provide the 
higher interest rate." GMM and Tibet, for instance. In the 
opinion of CBR Deputy Chairman D. Tulin, these structures 
operate on the principle of the "pyramid game": They pay 
stupendous interest rates on hard-currency deposits by 
attracting more and more money from the gullible. 
  [Melnikov] There is regrettably a naive belief in miracles 
in our society, the belief that you can bury five gold coins in 
a field and get 100 times that amount in the morning. As long 
as there is a social breeding ground for all manner of "miracle 
workers," there will always be a handful of smart operators 
ready to offer the means to fabulous wealth. But all these 
"miracle workers" mainly operate with the far from rich ordinary 
population. The banks on the other hand prefer their clients to 
be a little more sound. Everything will evidently change when 
the inflated structures burst and a load of people lose their 
money irretrievably. 
  [Kucherenko] But people should not be educated at such a 
terrible price! There is the Law "On Currency Regulation," 
which prohibits involvement in currency operations without 
licenses. 
  [Melnikov] The point is that our laws are still extremely 
lax and imperfect. Britain's banking legislation for instance 
fills over 70 volumes and regulates literally every move that 
bankers make. Everything has been done to protect the client 
against fraud. If you try that here you immediately get a 
reputation for opposing the free market economy and supporting 
administrative-edict methods. 
  You say that licenses are needed. The Law on Currency 
Regulation mainly acts as a framework, countless instructions 
are needed for it. We have managed to write a whole series of 
them, each one taking five to six months. 
  [Kucherenko] But can charges not be filed against a 
particular company for its advertising? Is it not a fact that 
the procedure for conducting currency operations is being 
breached? 
  [Melnikov] We have no legal documents pertaining to 
advertising, and whole pages of newspapers are crammed full of 
illegal announcements. For instance: "I am opening offshore 
companies on the Cayman Islands without a CBR license." That is 
a typical breach of procedure, commonplace smuggling of capital 
offshore in order to evade taxation. But we only have to resort 
to the courts and they will demand that an operational 
investigation be conducted: Do prove to us, with documents and 
other material evidence, that this firm has opened offshore 
offices for this or that client. We do not have the resources 
for that. 
  Take GMM, which moves depositors' money without a license, 
i.e. is engaged in illegal actions. In this situation I think 
that law-enforcement bodies, primarily the prosecutor's office, 
should put a halt to the activity of a transgressor regardless 
of the latter's jurisdiction. GMM is a Dutch firm, but it is 
operating on our market and violating our laws. 
  [Kucherenko] What about Tibet, is it a foreign resident? 
  [Melnikov] We cannot do the work of the tax police! God 
willing, by the end of the year we will somehow have to write 
instructions regarding the Law on Currency Regulation. A 
tremendous amount of work is needed to give Russia a statutory 
banking base. Today a situation reigns in financial affairs 
that makes foreigners despair. Unlike our country, in the 
United States you cannot put more than $10,000 in an account 
without providing documentary confirmation that this money has 
been earned legally. 
  Actual financial control in the Russian Federation is 
divided 
between the Finance Ministry's Auditing Administration, 
ourselves, the tax police, the Federal Service for 
Currency-Export Controls, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
It is hard to coordinate the work. Many structures are still 
only just being formed and, organizationally, are extremely 
weak. Yet banking, tax, and currency legislation are 
simultaneously being violated at every turn. It would be 
sensible to look at the experience of the Italians, who, 
afflicted as they are by the mafia and corruption, have combined 
all control and financial organs in the Guardia di Finanza. 
Were we to set up something of the sort based on the tax 
police, for instance, many establishments would inevitably fall 
within this structure's purview. 
  But we are doing something even now. We recently checked the 
work of currency exchange points in Moscow. Abuses were 
discovered at one bank ("Stayl" -- author's note). And the CBR 
suspended its license for hard currency transactions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ex-Finance Minister Boris Fedorov by Yelena </F>
Levina; date and place not stated: "Boris Fedorov Believes 
Dollar Will Be Worth 10,000 Rubles"] 
  [Text] [Levina] Boris Grigoryevich, after some spasmodic 
leaps, the rate of exchange for the dollar has risen quite 
smoothly. Last year, your forecasts turned out to be by far the 
closest to what actually happened. How do you evaluate the 
prospects for and the situation with the regulation of the rate 
of exchange by the Central Bank today? 
  [Fedorov] I think the rate of exchange would now be, maybe, 
3,000 rubles [R] to the dollar but for attempts to restrain it. 
But the reserves for restraint are almost exhausted. If we get 
the $1.5 billion from the West on which the talks with 
[International Monetary Fund Managing Director] M. Camdessus 
centered, then, of course, they will be thrown onto the market. 
And this will retard the process further. But I am sticking to 
the forecast I made in December: It is perfectly feasible that 
the exchange rate may be R10,000 to the dollar by the end of the 
year. 
  By restraining the exchange rate the Central Bank has, so to 
speak, gone against its own nature. Now it is even letting the 
premier down in some respects. Because a certain amount of 
credit, for instance, has been held back deliberately. In 
reality, there are between 2 and 3 trillion in liquid money on 
the market, and if you reduce the volume of credit issued, then 
this is sufficient to affect the rate of exchange. But any 
forecasts are made on the assumption that the Central Bank and 
the government will not fix the rate. 
  [Levina] Do you consider this realistic? 
  [Fedorov] I think it is doubtful, because this would be a 
blatant deviation from market principles. But now, as you can 
see, those in the upper echelons are trying with all their might 
to show that the reforms are continuing, and that there will be 
no deviation. And as soon as they fix prices, the exchange 
rate, or drastically cut, say, interest rates, or remove 
something or other from commercial banks, it will be impossible 
to preserve the image of reformers. But nevertheless, 
Chernomyrdin is somehow trying to maneuver between two 
rockfaces: nodding approval to one side, and not moving too far 
away from those on the other. But, as we know, a person cannot 
be in two places at once.... 
  [Levina] And what can be said about the crux of the question 
on the liquidation of commercial banks? 
  [Fedorov] Ultimately, roughly one-half of all banks will 
disappear or merge with others, and this is a fact. After all, 
even today many major banks survive only at the expense of state 
funds. A huge quantity of preferential credits and subsidies is 
released via commercial banks, and this keeps them afloat. A 
whole series of very well-known banks are actually giants with 
feet of clay -- and these are banks which are particularly 
friendly with the Central Bank. 
  But those on less friendly terms with the Central Bank are 
far stronger, because they have drummed up real business, they 
have a genuine clientele, stable resource sources. 
  Take, for instance, the "Stolichnyy" Bank -- it is fiercely 
unpopular with the Central Bank. The "Stolichnyy" managers may 
or may not be likable, but the fact is that this bank will not 
go under because it is engaged in specific financial business. 
  And there are other banks which deal in specific business 
and have their own reliable sources. But those banks -- even 
very respectable and famous ones -- with a balance sheet showing 
between 75 and 80 percent centralized resources will be the 
first to go under because they are not competitive. This even 
concerns certain banks in, say, the oil and gas industry. But, 
I hear you cry, this is where all the state money and resources 
are, surely? But I get the feeling that some of them are 
breathing their last. While oil workers had a lot of money -- 
they prospered. But when the need arises to do business, to 
seek out depositors -- then they are weak. 
  [Levina] Right now, at a time when the discussion of the 
budget is under way, everybody is concerned by one question: 
Will the same type of monstrous inflation witnessed last year 
continue in 1994? Why are such diverse figures cited on this 
score in official documents? 
  [Fedorov] When a situation emerges whereby on virtually the 
very same day the president says inflation will be between 3 and 
5 percent by the end of the year and the premier says it will be 
between 7 and 9 percent (while at the same time naming 
percentages of 10, 14, and 15 in various speeches), this means 
that they have lost their bearings and there is no clear policy. 
  In principle, were we to set ourselves a limit of 3 percent, 
this could be done without any problems. This does not require 
any new discoveries, and no IMF will ever tell us anything new, 
no matter who's in charge there. Everything the IMF knows, we 
know ourselves. 
  [Levina] So what is the problem? 
  [Fedorov] This is a question of political will, and that 
alone. It is quite possible to stop the printing presses for a 
month. But this is painful. Likewise, it is perfectly feasible 
to cease emissions for six months. It is essential to look at 
which expenditure is inefficient. A great deal of it! And I 
have repeatedly suggested halting the issue of government 
decrees such as, for instance, the one on setting up an 
organizing committee to mark the 300th anniversary of a small 
boat belonging to Peter the Great. There is no need to spend 
millions on this nowadays! 
  But there are dozens of these decrees. They represent the 
whim of useless administrative bodies. From government bodies 
downward. Why are there so many departments? Or what does the 
so-called center for information science policy under the 
government do? Of the 1,000 people making up the government 
apparatus, I believe that 700 could be pruned. And why are 
there 10 telephones on every bureaucrat's desk? You know, this 
means at least five types of specialist communications 
facilities. What for? There is a very great deal of 
unnecessary expenditure in our country. Resources are 
squandered with frightening gusto. 
  In the last six months I have made repeated representations 
to Chernomyrdin to tear apart the expenditure base of the budget 
with an iron hand, and I brought him a list of 60 senseless 
decrees which ought to be abolished in view of the huge and 
unnecessary expenditure entailed by them. He referred them 
repeatedly to the government for examination, and discussions 
were organized. On several occasions the premier even took up a 
pen to sign something, but was then unable to do it. As a 
result, everything boiled down to the suspension of just one law 
on land, which was highly offensive and "cost" 100 trillion.... 
  [Levina] Tell me, how are planned volumes of emissions 
determined in practice? 
  [Fedorov] There is a very specific correlation: The 
percentage growth of emissions in the next quarter must be lower 
than the rate of inflation in the previous quarter. Now, 
however, we are officially preparing for the second quarter with 
a growth in emissions which is not lower but higher than 
previous-quarter inflation. That is, the spiral is twisting 
toward even greater inflation.... 
  [Levina] Why? 
  [Fedorov] There are solid lobby interests in parliament. 
Each group is fighting to increase expenditure on a particular 
budget item. 
  And for some reason, nobody senses that by increasing the 
deficit you are making the country's position worse. 
  [Levina] Does the Central Bank have too few powers? 
  [Fedorov] On the contrary. In our country the Central Bank 
even has somewhat more powers than should really be available to 
any normal Central Bank. It deals with payment transactions and 
sundry other things, and if it were to be given the chance to 
offer credits directly too -- well, then there would be a lot of 
very happy people there. The oversight of banks is their 
favorite job. Because the psychology of old State Bank staffers 
-- to engage in small, specific matters -- is irrepressible. 
  [Levina] What, in your view, should the Central Bank be 
doing in principle? 
  [Fedorov] In any country the department of the Central Bank 
involves itself in two things: First, economic analysis, on the 
basis of which it gives the center a signal to rectify monetary 
and credit policy. Second, cash in hand. In some places the 
oversight function also exists. But this differs from country 
to country. But just you try to ask the following question of a 
Central Bank representative in any region of our country: "How 
do you analyze the economic situation in the region?" 
  And he will immediately begin to complain to you about the 
sowing campaign, the railroads, the problems besetting 
enterprises, and that his ceiling is low and credits cannot be 
issued. And then it becomes clear: That is not what I would 
call a Central Bank. 
  But without this, without the precisely and intelligently 
calculated guidelines and a firm political will to reduce the 
budget deficit, inflation and impoverishment cannot be halted.

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- Following prolonged 
discussions, the State Property Committee established procedure 
and time (April) for selling shares of a Russian joint stock 
society, Gazprom. The committee announced the number of shares 
to be sold -- 28.7 per cent from the authorised capital 
totalling 236.7 billion roubles. 
  The state seeks not to release Gazprom from its hold at the 
first stage of privatisation and retains 40 per cent of shares 
for three years. The society has already sold 15 per cent of 
stocks to gas industry workers according to a closed 
subscription: they were purchased by nearly 270,000 people. 
  It is necessary now to sell the largest block of shares 
which 
will be sold at 60 regional auctions. Each auction will sell 
blocks of shares, the size of which will be proportionate to the 
value of the industry's fixed assets on a given territory. 
There is another distinguishing feature of auctions. Their 
participants will consist of physical persons having permanent 
residence registration on a given territory. 
  Tyumen region residents will buy the greatest number of 
Gazprom stocks: 17 million shares worth 1,000 roubles each. 
This is 7.15 per cent from the authorised capital. Another 5.7 
per cent of stocks will be floated in the Yamal-Nenets national 
area. The labour and shares floating division of the Gazprom 
society compiled a map of a kind: a list of regions indicating 
the value of Gazprom fixed assets on their territories. 
  The Orenburg region with its gas fields and gas-processing 
amalgamations trails the Sverdlovsk and Perm regions as to the 
value of fixed assets. This is despite the fact that gas is not 
produced there. The last cities on the list are Moscow and St. 
Petersburg consuming the greatest quantities of gas but having 
no production facilities of the society on their territories.

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- "There is no such compound 
as `red mercury' in nature, it is not used in the ministry's 
atomic energy enterprises, and is not used in the construction 
of nuclear weapons", ITAR-TASS was told on Thursday by Georgiy 
Kaurov, head of the public relations department of the Russian 
Atomic Ministry. 
  He said that scientists and specialists from the Atomic 
Ministry had already made similar statements many times. 
Apparently, it would not hurt to make one more: Russia does 
carry out research in the field of thermonuclear synthesis of 
heavy hydrogen isotopes, however, such research has absolutely 
nothing in common with "red mercury". 
  Kaurov announced that in the ministry's opinion, Wednesday's 
report by the REUTER news agency that Russia has a "miniature 
neutron bomb", developed by Russian scientists on the basis of 
"red mercury", and the English television film about the 
"Russians' discovery" are cheap efforts to create a sensation 
and have political undertones.

  [Text] Last month, the British SUNDAY TIMES came up with 
allegations that Russia is developing biological weapons. The 
Russian Defense Ministry has strongly denied the allegations. 
Nevertheless, THE WASHINGTON POST has issued the same statement 
again recently. Vladislav Kozyakov comments: 
  What is surprising is that the authors of the publications 
about a biological weapons program allegedly under way in Russia 
refer to the White House, sources which in their turn quote 
statements by some anonymous defectors from Russia. And, 
moreover, the authors contradict each other. For one, an 
anonymous author says in THE WASHINGTON POST that he has got all 
the necessary evidence that the program exists, while another 
author states in the same newspaper that there is no evidence to 
prove the charges and therefore it can be only non-military 
equipment that should be dismantled as well. 
  Hence, a question arises -- what are the reasons for 
spreading such unfounded accusations concerning the Russian 
policy in the American mass media, with reference to the 
administration's officials? An agreement is in effect between 
Russia, the United States, and Britain on mutual visits to 
biological facilities of the three countries. Russian experts 
visited several facilities of the kind in the United States in 
February-March this year. British and American experts carried 
out similar inspections in Russia in 1992, last October, and 
last January. They were allowed to visit any laboratories and 
talk with employees and take pictures as well. And Western 
experts revealed no claims as to the observance of the 1972 
convention banning biological weapons. 
  As for visiting American biological facilities, Russian 
experts faced serious obstacles. For one, they were not allowed 
into a number of laboratories and one building of a former plant 
of the Pasar firm, producing biological weapons. Certain 
restrictions were posed on them to take pictures and they were 
also denied to make biological tests. One of the facilities was 
opened for inspection only after the Russian Embassy interfered. 
Besides, experts from Russia found out that the Pasar firm not 
only preserved but was modernizing the equipment designed 
earlier to produce biological warfare formulas. Information to 
that effect has been published in the Moscow-based newspaper 
IZVESTIYA. 
  Apparently there is only one way to provide strict 
observance 
of the 1972 convention banning biological weapons. The sides 
should work out a more effective control mechanism over the 
convention's implementation. Russia, for its part, intends to 
help promote the idea at the forthcoming session of the 
preparatory committee dealing with the control measures to 
observe the convention. Will the Western countries be ready for 
a stricter control system?

  [Text] Mirny, Arkhangelsk region April 13 TASS -- The 
setting up of a unique system of control for missile flights at 
the command post of the range has been completed, ITAR-TASS was 
told by General Nikolay Yudin, chief of staff of the state range 
of strategic rocket forces in the Arkhangelsk region. 
  He said the range has become a major scientific center in 
Russia. Officers manning the command post are candidates of 
technical sciences. A computer system for flight control has 
been created at the initiative of one of them, 
Lieutenant-Colonel Yashchenko. 
  From 1992 the range has been serving the task of insurance 
and monitoring of the observance of treaty-governed obligations 
between Russia and the United States for the exchange of 
telemetric information on missile launchings, General Yudin 
said. The Russian Strategic Rocket Forces now have at their 
disposal a unique and Russia's only experimental base for 
testing all kinds of missiles, for processing and analysys of 
the information strictly in accordance with the treaty on 
strategic offensive arms. 
  As is known, a large group of journalists arrived at the 
secret garrison in Mirny on April 11. The journalists were 
given an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the latest 
equipment, specifically with the pilot sample of the missile 
complex Topol which will be adopted for service in several 
years. The arrival of journalists coincided with the 
celebration of Cosmonautics Day. It is broadly celebrated in 
Mirny as much has been done here for space exploration. "We keep 
no secrets from the Russian and world public, but our openness 
does not lower our sense of responsibility for Russia's 
security. Russia can be confident on its security," General 
Yuriy Zhuravlev, chief of the range, told repoters.

of food products alone amounts to 60 billion rubles. 
Nevertheless, the financial administration of the Russian

shrugs off the numerous appeals -- from the Pacific Fleet among 
others -- for payments for provisions delivered on credit. 
According to a report of the Pacific Fleet press service, the

financing of military units to obtain the barest necessities. 
However, both the Russian Government and the Ministry of

that parties represented in the Riigikogu will receive state 
funding proportional to the number of seats. 
  The draft law on auxiliary police was referred to the third

  [Text] Tallinn, April 12 -- Leaders of two Estonian 
private TV-companies -- EVTV and RTV, Viktor Siilats and Mart 
Siimann told a press conference on Tuesday [12 April] that an 
agreement had been concluded between them to use the former 
Ostankino TV-channel on the basis of equality, and said that 
broadcasts will be started on April 18. 
  RTV will have its broadcasting time on Mondays, Wednesdays, 
Fridays and Sundays from 18.00 to 24.00 and RTV on Tuesdays, 
Thursdays and Saturdays from 17.10-24.00 and on Sunday from 
9.00. The leaders said that at the beginning the companies will 
remain independent corporate bodies, at least till autumn, after 
which a possible joining can be discussed. At the beginning 
both companies have their independent programmes with some 
possible joint programmes. 
  The two TV-companies had their own TV-channels which, 
however, did not cover the whole territory of Estonia for 
technical reasons. After Ostankino TV broadcasts were stopped on 
March 28 because of a debt of 2.5 million kroons of the Russian 
TV company to the Estonian Broadcast Transmission Centre, the 
channel was allocated to RTV and EVTV at their application.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 12, BNS -- The government intends to 
take stringent measures to put a stop to the rising inflation, 
including forced bankruptcy of companies that are in arrears 
with payments into the state coffers, Prime Minister Mart Laar 
said at a press conference today. 
  The government hopes to curb inflation by reducing the 
amount 
of cash in circulation through calling in debts to the state and 
by promoting privatization and the development of the stock 
market in the country, Laar said. 
  Most debts stem from non-payment of the social and the sick 
benefit taxes, the premier noted. 
  The 8.9-percent rise in inflation last month was primarily 
caused by the local governments' price policy and the jump in 
the amount of cash in circulation which occurred in the last 
quarter of 1993, Laar claimed. 
  The premier voiced the opinion that inflation would have 
been 
between 3 and 4 percent in March if only the price hike in foods 
and manufactured goods were taken into account. 
  According to the Statistics Department, food prices rose 
last 
month by 5.3 percent, and dairy products shot up by as much as 
13.3 percent. 
  If the local governments again put up the rent and public 
transport rates in April, inflation may not stop, Laar said. 
  "At a meeting with World Bank representatives yesterday we 
discussed the problem of inflation and I can say that neither 
the World Bank nor the International Monetary Fund see any cause 
for concern in the rising inflation in Estonia," the premier 
stated. 
  The inflation rate will probably drop in the second half of 
the year, Laar said.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 12, BNS -- The Estonian Government 
decided at its session today to establish a special regime in 
the northwest Estonian Pakri peninsula where Paldiski is 
situated. The regime will be in force during the dismantling of 
nuclear reactors at the former Russian naval training center in 
the town and the removal of nuclear fuel from Estonia. 
  The safety regulations allow people to enter the peninsula 
only through special checkpoints and restrict their movement in 
the territory. People who neither live nor work in the area 
need special licenses issued either by the Paldiski commandant 
or the Harjumaa police to enter the peninsula. In case of need, 
the Interior Ministry is allowed to restrict or entirely close 
traffic in Pakri. 
  The government charged the Police Department with stepping 
up 
control in the peninsula to find out the people who have no 
permits for staying in the area. 
  The Cabinet's order appoints Juri Tikk, special 
representative of the government in Paldiski, as coordinator of 
activities of the agencies involved. 
  Tikk told BNS in an earlier interview the first stage of 
dismantling the Paldiski reactors, which involves the removal of 
nuclear fuel from the reactors and from Estonia, would probably 
begin after April 10. The operation takes place in three stages 
and will take about three years to complete.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 12, BNS -- Estonia has done, is doing 
and will do everything it can to apprehend the men who killed a 
Russian border guard, Tarmo Kouts, director general of the 
Border Guard Department, told BNS. 
  A Russian border guard was shot dead and two wounded on 
April 
1 in a skirmish near the Pechory (Petseri) railway station on 
the Russian side of the temporary borderline. The two 
assailants fled. 
  The tracker dog brought to the scene failed to pick up the 
assailants' trail, so it is not known whether they came from or 
fled to Estonia. 
  The two wounded border guards said the assailants spoke 
Russian without a foreign accent and claimed to be former 
Russian servicemen. The shots were fired from a TT pistol. 
  Kouts said Estonia has done everything it could and 
everything "Russia asked for" to find the assailants. 
  "Russia hasn't lately informed us about the results of their 
investigations, although we know they continue looking for the 
men," Kouts told BNS. "We've been checking out our own theories, 
and we've established a certain circle of people we'll go over 
with a fine-tooth comb."

  [Text] TALLINN, Apr 13, BNS - Estonia should fill the gap 
in the European joint security system, Enn Tupp, the head of the 
Defense Ministry defense policy department, said at a press 
conference today. 
  Tupp attached great importance to the adoption of the law on 
service in the defense forces. He said it's a good law, but that 
now several lower-level legal acts need to be passed. 
  The law on peacetime national defense is waiting to be 
adopted and in May the government will probably pass to the 
parliament a bill on national defense in wartime, the Defense 
Ministry official noted. He added that legislation on compulsory 
duties in wartime, military career, and military police must be 
adopted. 
  Under defense policy, a national defense doctrine must be 
worked out and the share of defense expenditures in the budget 
established, Tupp told reporters.

  [Text] TALLINN, Apr 13, BNS -- "I believe Russia will 
withdraw its troops from Estonia by Aug. 31," Enn Tupp, head of 
the Estonian Defense Ministry defense policy department, told 
BNS at a press conference today. 
  Tupp claimed the troop pullout cannot be stopped. Jyri Kork, 
head of the defense forces general staff information department, 
added that every week from 30 to 40 Russian military personnel 
leave Estonia. 
  The Russian military staying in Estonia are a political toy, 
just like the Skrunda radar facility in Latvia, Tupp noted. 
  The Russian delegation to the Estonian-Russian troop 
withdrawal talks announced April 6 that Russia is not going to 
pull out its troops from Estonia by the Aug. 31, 1994, deadline. 
Russia also officially revoked the clause in the draft agreement 
that established Aug. 31 as the withdrawal deadline.

No. 71] 
  [Text] Head of the Defence Ministry section of defence 
policy Enn Tupp announced that Estonia needs a political 
document determining Estonia's military doctrine and the use of 
funds allocated for defence needs. 
  The document on the basics of national defence, formulated 
more than a year ago, is superficial and somewhat naive, Tupp 
said. He added that the first stage of introducing total 
defence was completed with the passing of the law on 
conscription. A draft law on peacetime defence is currently 
debated by the Riigikogu [parliament] and the draft law on 
wartime defence is to reach the parliament in a month. 
  Tupp discussed further Estonia's defence capability, 
stressing that a direct aggression is unlikely in the near 
future, but that the Defence Forces must be capable of 
countering any minor conflicts. He stressed the importance of 
training the reserves and also predicted that Russia will 
complete the troops withdrawal by August 31, despite the 
invalidation of the corresponding item in the draft agreement. 
"The Russian military here are a political plaything, rather 
like the Skrunda radar station in Latvia," he said. Head of the 
ministry information section Jyri Kork added that approximately 
30-40 Russian military are leaving Estonia every week. 
  Kork also discussed the strength of the Defence Forces, 
announcing that approximately 450 men out of full complement of 
800 are present in each infantry battalion. However, only one 
third to a half of the officers' posts are currently occupied.

<F P=106> [Rebroadcast of Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev's </F>
address to nation on 12 April--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] Esteemed compatriots, sisters and brothers, 
citizens of the Azerbaijani Republic, the intensification of 
Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan in recent days, and the 
situation engendered by the escalation of the Armenian Armed 
Forces' attacks against Azerbaijani land forced me to come to 
the Azerbaijani television station tonight. My aim is to inform 
you on the prevailing situation and to express some of my views 
on this situation. 
  As you know, the Azerbaijani state and its leadership aim at 
putting an end to the ongoing war between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan, and for this purpose is trying to achieve a certain 
agreement by holding peace talks. We have taken many steps in 
this direction. We are always trying to make use of the 
possibilities of the international organizations. We accept the 
big powers' initiatives and try to benefit from them. We have 
established contacts with the Armenian Republic and are holding 
talks with them. Recently we accepted the mediation initiative 
of the Russian state, and through the Russian Foreign and 
Defense Ministries we have given our consent to a certain 
agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  I do not intend now to analyze all the processes in recent 
months for you. However, I want to single out some facts. As 
you know, during the CIS meeting in Ashgabat on 24 December last 
year, I met with Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and held 
detailed talks with him and made proposals to end the ongoing 
war between Azerbaijan and Armenia. We held a broad exchange of 
views. At that very same CIS meeting, I made an extensive 
statement on Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan over the 
last few years, invited the CIS leaders to intervene in this 
problem, and declared that war between the CIS states is 
abnormal and that therefore the head of each state should 
express his own stance on this matter. Later on, the Russian 
Foreign Ministry became active. We received the representative 
of the Russian Foreign Ministry on various occasions, examined 
different draft agreements, submitted our proposals, and tried 
to achieve an agreement by making certain compromises. However, 
even these did not produce any results. Finally, the defense 
ministers of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Russia met in Moscow on 18 
February and a protocol was signed between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan on a cease-fire and holding peace talks. We also 
accepted this for the simple reason that we have always worked, 
and are still working, for the peaceful resolution of the 
conflict. According to that protocol, the cease-fire in the 
Karabakh zone and on all the fronts was to go into effect 
between Azerbaijan and Armenia as of 1 March. This was to be 
followed by talks, the withdrawal of Armenia's Armed Forces from 
the occupied Azerbaijani lands, and a major agreement. However, 
the Armenian side undermined even this agreement. It started to 
launch constant attacks against our positions as of 2 March. 
Thus, this agreement also produced no result. The chairmen of 
the Azerbaijani and Armenian parliaments met in Kazakh on 12 
March. They held talks. We were hoping that these agreements 
would produce a result. However, later on the Armenian side did 
not abide by these agreements and continued with its attacks 
against the Azerbaijani lands and Army positions. These attacks 
by Armenia's Armed Forces continued until the end of March. 
However, I can state with great satisfaction and pride that the 
Azerbaijani Army, Army units, our military units and fighters 
have checked all these attacks and Armenia's Armed Forces 
suffered enormous losses and were forced to withdraw without 
achieving anything in Fizulinskiy Rayon, against which they had 
mostly directed their attacks. 
  Despite all this, we continued favoring peace talks, and 
almost a week ago Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian Foreign 
Ministry's representative, plenipotentiary ambassador, and the 
representative of the Russian president, visited Baku and held 
talks with us and presented us with a new draft agreement.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov held a meeting with 
ambassadors accredited to our republic in connection with the 
latest intensification of the Armenian attacks. Our colleague 
Menzere Sadiqova reports: 
  [Sadiqova] At a meeting in Baku with the representatives of 
the embassies and missions of 15 countries and the UN, as well 
international organizations such as the Red Cross and Doctors 
Without Borders, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov gave 
a briefing on the extraordinary situation that has emerged at 
the fronts. In this context he referred to the Azerbaijan 
president's televised address yesterday and touched upon the new 
positions set out in that address. 
  Gasan Gasanov noted that the new wave of powerful Armenian 
attacks above all results from the impunity enjoyed by the 
Armenian Republic. The countries of the world have so far not 
imposed any military, political, economic, or even the least 
moral sanctions against the Armenian aggressors, who have been 
occupying Azerbaijani territory for the past six years. 
Instead, the Armenian Republic receives both arms and 
humanitarian assistance from abroad. 
  The minister pointed out that giving humanitarian assistance 
to an aggressor state is an unprecedented event in international 
practice. The Armenian Republic is the first state ever to 
receive humanitarian assistance from foreign countries while 
engaging in military aggression. In an attempt to mislead the 
international community, the Armenian leaders often assert that 
the war is being waged by Daghlyk-Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh]. 
If so, which country or countries are providing the most modern 
weapons, heavy artillery, and fuel to Daghlyk-Karabakh? In 
refutation of this duplicitous Armenian policy, the Azerbaijani 
foreign minister produced substantial proof. Speaking to the 
international community, he firmly condemned attempts by certain 
forces to force Azerbaijan to its knees and noted that history 
has repeatedly shown that it is not possible to suppress the 
people's will. 
  Noting that foreign countries have adopted a passive stance 
toward the aggression of the Armenian Republic and its 
occupation of more than 20 percent of Azerbaijani territory, 
Gasan Gasanov explained that the intensification of the Armenian 
attacks is linked to the end of winter. If we recall the events 
of the last three or four years, we see that Armenia has usually 
seized Azerbaijani territory between April and September. 
  In an all-around assessment of the Azerbaijani president's 
televised address, Gasan Gasanov once again clarified our 
state's peace-loving position regarding the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
conflict. Referring to yesterday's presidential address, he 
emphasized that if the war is ended we will unconditionally 
guarantee the security of the Armenian population of 
Daghlyk-Karabakh. 
  After Gasanov's statement, the diplomats were invited to ask 
questions, but none of them wanted to ask anything or make a 
statement, because the situation in our republic is well known 
to foreign diplomats. 
  Relevant documents were distributed to the guests after the 
meeting. We hope that these foreign diplomats will report back 
to their countries on the issues raised today during the 
Azerbaijani foreign minister's meeting with them, and that when 
the international community gets this objective information on 
the real situation in Azerbaijan it will finally move to 
restrain the aggressor Armenian state. For this to happen, the 
efforts of the foreign diplomats must coincide with the 
political interests of the countries they represent. 
  Gasan Gasanov held a news conference today on the subjects 
discussed at the meeting. He noted that the big powers' failure 
to brand Armenia as an aggressor and the free hand given them as 
a result has been encouraging the Armenians, who have the 
impression that they can achieve their goals sooner if they 
occupy more Azerbaijani territory. Having disregarded the 
peace-making efforts of prestigious international organizations 
and (?various) groups, the Armenians--who usually have military 
successes during summer--have now launched a new campaign of 
aggression. We must use all our diplomatic means and sanctions 
should be implemented to halt the aggressor. 
  It became obvious at the news conference that the latest 
attacks have wreaked destruction in Geranboyskiy and Terterskiy 
Rayons; and in addition to the fighters, civilians have also 
been harmed. 
  Gasan Gasanov answered reporters' questions on (?current 
affairs). Though there were not many reporters, the news 
conference was held in a lively atmosphere.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva and Viktor </F>
Shulman] 
  [Text] Baku April 13 TASS -- Armenian troops continued 
their offensive in the direction of the Terter district of 
Azerbaijan located several dozen kilometers north of 
Nagorno-Karabakh on Wednesday. 
  The Azerbaijani Defence Ministry said that the offensive was 
preceded by artillery shelling. Armenians are using Grad 
missile launchers to shell the district centre which has a 
population of 20,000 people, it said. 
  The Azerbaijani Army rebuffed the offensive near the town of 
Gyulistan in the neighbouring Geiraboy district. Armenian 
troops were reported stepping up activity in the Agdam district. 
  Earlier today Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh traded 
charges, 
accusing each other of continuing the bloody war over the 
disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijani Foreign 
Minister Gasan Gasanov said that the unpunishment of Armenia and 
its aggressive actions, as well as the passivity of the 
international community may lead to the occupation of new 
territories of Azerbaijan and unpredictability of the 
development of the situation in the region. He said Azerbaijani 
President Geydar Aliyev's address to the nation and the world 
made on republican television on Tuesday testifies to the 
"constructive position of the republic and its desire to settle 
the conflict by peaceful means." 
  "The leadership of Azerbaijan, taking advantage of the 
connivance of the international community, continues the war 
against the civilians of Nagorno-Karabakh," a statement issued 
by the government of Nagorno-Karabakh said on Wednesday. 
  "Barbaric bombing of towns and villages is accompanied by 
cynical televised addresses by Azerbaijani President Geydar 
Aliyev to the Armenian population of Karabakh, urging them to 
stop the bloodshed and assuring them of (Azerbaijan's) readiness 
to ensure their safety," the statement said. Nagorno-Karabakh 
leaders warned they will reserve the right to take adequate 
measures against Azerbaijani towns, adding that all 
responsibility will rest with the Azerbaijani side.

  [Text] The Armenian Army's offensive against Geranboyskiy 
[Shaumyanovskiy], Terterskiy, and Agdamskiy Rayons have been 
continuing for the last four days. Our units fighting in 
Geranboyskiy Rayon last night and in the early morning of 13 
April succeeded in inflicting heavy blows on the enemy, in 
ousting the enemy from Gulistan in Geranboyskiy Rayon and from 
Talish in Terterskiy Rayon, and in recovering their former 
positions. 
  After an artillery barrage at 0600 today, the enemy launched 
a new offensive against Terterskiy Rayon. The city of Terter is 
still being shelled by Grad launchers. Zangishaly, Mekhrizli, 
and Sarydzhaly in Agdamskiy Rayon have been coming under 
artillery shelling since 0630 this morning. The bloody battles 
are continuing uninterrupted in the Terterskiy and Agdamskiy 
sectors of the front. A large number of enemy troops were 
killed during the fighting.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevinc Abdullayeva and Viktor </F>
Shulman] 
  [Text] Baku, 13 Apr -- Azerbaijan's Foreign Minister Hasan 
Hasanov branded as fiction media reports to the effect that 
Azerbaijan will be declaring at the Moscow meeting that it is 
leaving the CIS. Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent about the likelihood of such a step, the minister 
said at a news conference today that "Azerbaijan attaches great 
importance to the development of all-round contacts with the CIS 
states, regarding it as a priority in the republic's 
foreign-policy activities." 
  Hasan Hasanov told journalists that, at the Moscow summit, 
"Azerbaijani President Gaydar Aliyev may make a special 
statement." According to the minister, in the statement 
"relevant assessments of the current situation in the 
Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict area will be given." A sharp 
deterioration in it ensued, according to Hasanov, four days ago, 
"following the latest offensive undertaken by the Armenian armed 
formations outside Nagorno-Karabakh in the western and 
southwestern regions of Azerbaijan." 
  The head of the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry commended 
Russia's new efforts to resolve the Karabakh problem. Without 
going into details, the minister merely declared that 
"Azerbaijan has, in principle, approved the draft agreement on a 
cessation of hostilities submitted by the Russian side, but has 
borne in mind its comments and proposals." It was also stressed 
yet again that the leadership of Azerbaijan holds firm to the 
view that the conflict can only be resolved by political means.

<F P=106> [Report by Aydyn Mekhtiyev under the "Azerbaijan" rubric: </F>
"Gyandzha Under Threat. Republic's Second-Largest City 
Threatened by Major Armenian Offensive"] 
  [Text] According to an Azerbaijan Defense Ministry report, 
in the past few days Armenian troops have launched a large-scale 
offensive in northeastern Nagorno-Karabakh, involving a great 
number of tanks and armored personnel carriers. Although the 
Defense Ministry still claims that the Azerbaijani troops have 
been able to withstand the onslaught of the Armenian forces, 
your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent has learned from 
confidential sources that the Armenian troops have advanced a 
few kilometers toward the district capital of Geranboy (Shaumyan 
-- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA) adjoining the Agderin (Mardakert -- 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA) district of Nagorno- Karabakh. It is well 
known that the Geranboy district, which was recaptured by 
Azerbaijan in a successful offensive in summer 1992, is 
strategically important as a town located in direct proximity to 
Azerbaijan's second-largest city, Gyandzha. The district's 
possible capture by Armenian troops would, therefore, pose a 
real threat to Gyandzha. 
  Observers in Baku point to the fact that the Armenian 
troops' 
offensive on the Gyandzha axis was launched right after Armenian 
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan paid a visit to Moscow 8 April in 
an atmosphere of strictest secrecy. According to reports from 
sources in the Azerbaijan leadership, during his talks with 
Russian leaders Ter-Petrosyan spoke about the possibility of 
exerting military pressure on Baku so that it will soften its 
stance on Russia's peace plan for Nagorno-Karabakh. The plan, 
which, among other things, calls for Russian troops to be 
brought to Azerbaijan as peacekeeping forces, was spurned by the 
Baku authorities as violating the republic's sovereignty. In 
addition, Baku was somewhat worried by Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's edict on setting up Russian military bases on the CIS 
countries' territory. Azerbaijan Defense Minister Mamedrafi 
Mamedov has stated that "none of external forces will manage to 
impose on Azerbaijan the deployment of foreign bases on the 
republic's territory." 
  Thus, on the eve of the meeting of the Council of CIS Heads 
of State, scheduled to take place in Moscow 15 April, a fairly 
critical situation is coming about in relations between Baku and 
Yerevan, and a certain tension is felt in Russian-Azerbaijani 
relations. To all appearances, Azerbaijani leader Geydar Aliyev 
will try to draw his CIS partners' attention to the stepping up 
of hostilities on Azerbaijani territory by the Armenian troops.

  [Text] President Guntis Ulmanis has sent a letter to Saeima 
Speaker Anatolijs Gorbunovs, in which he revokes his request to 
convene an extraordinary plenary session [of the parliament] on 
15 April. According to a letter circulated by the presidential 
office, it is being done because Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's order on military bases has not been repealed at a 
level requested by Latvia. 
  Ulmanis points out in the letter that because of this, his 
meeting with the Russian president is impossible in the nearest 
future. At the moment the signing of the initialled agreements 
in their present form is not possible either. The Latvian 
president considers that discussions with the governing 
coalition are evidence that there is no unanimity among the 
deputies on the issue of the initialled agreements. 
  I consider that the above-mentioned circumstances are 
substantial for the Saeima presidium to satisfy my request, the 
end of the letter reads. In connection with the fact that the 
state president has revoked, and the prime minister cancelled 
the request to convene the Saeima extraordinary session on 15 
April this year, the Saeima presidium has stated that there is 
no longer a legal basis for the convention of such an 
extraordinary session.

Shishlin] 
  [Text] A spokesman for President Guntis Ulmanis 
administration told INTERFAX Wednesday that his visit to Moscow 
scheduled for April 20 was postponed for an indefinite period. 
The spokesman did not suggest any reason for the postponement. 
  However, Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs made it clear 
addressing a briefing in Riga Tuesday, the reason is the 
dissatisfaction of the Latvian side by the explanations 
suggested by Russian officials for the Russian president's 
decision on the creation of military bases. 
  (INTERFAX Note: The decision of April 5 spread by the media 
said about Russia's intention to create military bases in the 
CIS countries and Latvia. Later the document was disavowed by 
representatives of the foreign and defense ministries and the 
Russian presidential structures as a consequences of a 
"technical mistake" or even "provocation") 
  The Latvian leadership insists that Boris Yeltsin personally 
disavow the decision which, by Riga's estimates, comes into 
force on April 13. Birkavs said that so far the Latvian 
government announces a "moratorium" for the negotiations with 
Russia on the conditions of the Russian troops pull-out and 
preparations for the signing of relevant treaties. The prime 
minister also said there is no need in the current situation to 
hold on April 15 a special session of the Latvian parliament 
which is to debate the package of Latvian-Russian agreements. 
  He also said that unless the Russian president withdraw the 
above document, Latvia will continue negotiations in no way. If 
so, Birkavs said, "Latvia will channel its entire activities 
towards the West" to obtain Latvia's stance on the swift and 
complete withdrawal of the Russian troops and the repatriation 
of the retired officers. 
  Birkavs said that the first step in this direction had been 
made by President Ulmanis who left Sunday for a tour of Denmark, 
France and Britain. 
  Birkavs said that Latvia should make the maximal use of the 
situation that shaped up after Yeltsin's decision was made 
public, and through further talks to achieve that Russia meet 
some additional demands, for example, on repatriation of the 
retired officers. 
  Prime Minister Birkavs will meet April 15 his Estonian 
counterpart Mart Laar to, what he described as "work out a 
common position at the talks with Russia on the troops pull-out."

  [Text] Riga April 13 TASS -- An emergency session of the 
Latvian parliament scheduled on Friday, was canceled today. The 
session was to be held on the initiative of the Latvian 
president and prime minister who insisted that draft agreements 
on the withdrawal of troops reached with Russia be discussed 
before the documents are signed. However, both Latvian top 
officials gave up their proposal in connection with Boris 
Yeltsin's order on the creation of a military base in Latvia. 
  A request to cancel an emergency session of the Latvian 
parliament was sent by Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis from 
Paris, where he is currently staying on a visit. Ulmanis' 
letter says that in view of the fact that Yeltsin's order has 
not been withdrawn in a form demanded by Latvia, the signing of 
earlier initialed agreements in their present form is impossible. 
  Ulmanis believes that a meeting with Boris Yeltsin in the 
near future is impossible either. This was announced to the 
general secretary of the European Council by Latvian Foreign 
Minister Georgs Andrejevs. In his letter the Latvian foreign 
minister pointed out that the Russian president's order was 
regarded in Latvia as a threat to its sovereignty.

<F P=106> [Article by Nellija Locmele: "Fighting Organized Crime </F>
Becomes a Priority"] 
  [Text] Riga, 6 Apr -- The parliamentary Commission for 
Defense and Interior Affairs has accepted a plan to counter 
organized crime, which will be deemed a priority in the overall 
fight against crime. The problem of ensuring a "green light" for 
this drive is to be resolved by the National Security Council 
and the Cabinet of Ministers, DIENA was told by Odisejs 
Kostanda, a member of Defense Commission. He also said that the 
commission will see to it that this prioritization is accepted 
at the highest level of state policy. 
  To implement this policy, it will be necessary to introduce 
several changes to legislative acts, and create a material and 
technical basis for the fight against organized crime. The 
Cabinet of Ministers will have to adopt proposals to reorganize 
the police. Eventually, it is envisioned that a special 
department for fighting crime and narcotics, a prosecutor's 
office, and a separate court structure will be introduced. 
  At present, Latvian law does not contain a definition of 
"organized crime," therefore neither the Prosecutor's Office nor 
the Ministry of Interior Affairs can supply precise data on 
results of the fight against this phenomenon. It is also 
difficult to estimate the true scale of organized crime, because 
only one quarter of all reported crimes are solved -- last year, 
that figure was 27.9 percent.

  [Text] RIGA, Apr 13, BNS - Latvia's foreign debt equalled 
242.98 million U.S. dollars by April 1, Finance Ministry's 
Foreign Economic Relations Department Director Guntis Urlovskis 
said at a briefing Wednesday [13 April]. The total sum of the 
received foreign credits (the paid back credits are not counted) 
also is included in Latvia's foreign debt. 
  Urlovskis said that, at the moment, Latvia has signed credit 
agreements for 493 million U.S. dollars in total. Latvia also 
has drafted credit agreements with the European Union for 40 
million ECU, with Norway for 6.3 million USD, with Switzerland 
for 8.6 million U.S. dollars, and with Austria for 32 million 
Austrian schillings. Latvia plans to receive credits from 
Denmark for 6.3 million U.S. dollars and from Iceland for 2.1 
million U.S. dollars. 
  Urlovskis said that the credits are issued in Latvia 
according to Latvian Cabinet's regulations on usage of foreign 
credits given to Latvian Government, adopted February 1994. A 
special governmental committee controls the issuing of foreign 
credits. 
  Urlovskis said that the Finance Ministry has drafted 
regulations on the choosing of auditor firms which could control 
the usage of foreign credits, given to Latvian enterprises.

<F P=106> [Article by Nellija Locmele: "Government Has To Decide How </F>
To Make a Profit on Latvian Oil"] 
  [Text] Riga, 5 Apr -- Today, the Saeima [parliament] 
Commission for Economy, Agriculture and Regional Policy met with 
officials of the Amoco Overseas Exploration Company, along with 
representatives of the Ministries of Economy, Foreign Affairs, 
and Environment Protection, and a group of geologists. The aim 
of the meeting was to promote the concluding of a contract 
between the Latvian Government and Amoco, granting the latter 
drilling rights on Baltic sea territory belonging to Latvia, 
where, according to geologists, oil can be found. 
  Provided the contract is signed, Latvia will be entitled to 
a 
part of Amoco's profits from selling the extracted oil. In 
addition, the company will train Latvian geologists over a 
period of five years. As DIENA was told by Aristids Lambergs, 
member of the Economy Commission, there will be no expense for 
Latvia; it is only a question of agreeing upon profits. If an 
agreement is not signed, the company will drill on Swedish 
territory, which would mean no profits for Latvia at all. 
According to geologists, the oil deposit is like an underground 
barrel straddling the Latvian and Swedish border, and it can be 
reached by drilling on either side of the border. Amoco has 
already signed a contract with Sweden. 
  The signing of a contract with Latvia is being impeded by 
the 
fact that until now the sea border between Latvia and Lithuania 
has not been delineated. There are oil deposits situated where 
the two borders meet, and Lithuania may be able to make claims 
as well, depending on what the two governments decide. 
Actually, Latvia has found the demands of Lithuania 
unacceptable, but a compromise can be expected in a short time, 
nonetheless. 
  Due to the preliminary agreement signed by the Latvian 
Government and Amoco in 1993, the term for granting the license 
is 2 July of this year. The Latvian Government established a 
commission today which is to resolve problems connected with the 
above mentioned contract. According to the company's proposal, 
the license must be confirmed by parliament. A. Lambergs 
emphasized that the Commission for Economy regards this project 
as useful and important for Latvia. Amoco is a U.S. company 
which extracts oil around the globe, and is the sixth largest 
company of its kind in the world.

  [Text] RIGA, Apr 13, BNS - As many as 101,648 people, or 
5.9 percent of the country's able-bodied population, were 
without job on April 12, according to figures from the State 
Employment Service. The State Statistics Committee calculates 
the joblessness at 6.6 percent of economically active residents. 
  From all persons looking for jobs, 87,953 have registered 
themselves as unemployed, 36,751 receive allowances and 31,627 
have been seeking job for long time, the Employment Service 
said. In Riga, the unemployment runs at 3.5 percent while in 
some rural districts it hits 12 percent and more. 
  The Cabinet considered the effect of unemployment on the 
interior stability and looked through proposals to improve the 
situation during its Tuesday [12 April] session. Labor Minister 
Andris Berzins briefed reporters that the government planned to 
support the development of small and medium size business in 
rural districts, where the unemployment is most severely felt, 
by channeling foreign investments and credits to the countryside.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 13, BNS -- American military experts 
see a number of positive changes in Lithuania's national defense 
system and think the improvement is partly a result of the 
successful implementation of the U.S. Military-to-Military 
Contacts Program in Lithuania. 
  Such contacts cost the United States around 100,000 dollars 
a 
month, but Brig. Gen. Thomas Lennon, deputy director of the 
program in 13 world countries, said he is certain that money is 
not spent uselessly in Lithuania. The general arrived in 
Vilnius Monday [11 April]. 
  On Tuesday, Lennon met with the U.S. ambassador to 
Lithuania, 
Darryl Johnson, and Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas 
Linkevicius. At a press conference, Lennon said he is satisfied 
with the work of a joint U.S.-Lithuanian military contacts 
group. He emphasized that the Military-to-Military program is a 
mutual exchange of ideas and experience, but not an attempt to 
press on American views. 
  Lennon said 85 projects ranging a full spectrum of national 
defense activities were carried out in Lithuania since last May. 
  Lithuanians and Americans acquainted each other with their 
defense structures, civil defense, military communication 
systems, military medicine and engineering. The 
Military-to-Military program will be continued in Lithuania next 
year, although initially it was intended for half year or a 
year. Lennon said the program will continue in Lithuania 
because "the interest of the United States is supporting your 
democratic transformations."

  [Text] VILNIUS, Apr 13, BNS - Lithuanian Defense Minister 
Linas Linkevicius says he does not intend to resign yet, 
although conditions for work are "difficult." In an interview 
with the leftist TIESA newspaper, Linkevicius, who is a member 
of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP], said 
some of LDDP members have prejudices against national defense. 
  "I see ill-favored criticism in this, although I earlier 
thought that I am criticized well-wishing," the minister said. 
  Linkevicius recently announced his decision to leave the 
parliament's National Security Committee, which is dominated by 
LDDP members.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Council of the Movement for National </F>
Progress "On the Situation in the National Defense System"] 
  [Text] It has been already more than half a year that the 
national defense system of the Republic of Lithuania has been 
destroyed methodically. This process was begun and is being 
vigorously continued by the Seimas [parliament] National 
Security Committee. Some responsibility for these actions and 
their effects also falls on the Lithuanian Democratic Labor 
Party [LDDP] and its faction in the Seimas, because their 
members, constituting the core of the National Security 
Committee, determine its destructive activities. One must state 
that the blatant press campaign discrediting the national 
defense system was begun by this committee which is continuing 
to incite it. Newspapers carry misleading statistics about the 
situation in various areas of the national defense system, the 
rate of accidents and deaths in the Army, without comparing them 
with analogous figures in the interior system. We do not intend 
to belittle the accomplishments of the National Security 
Committee in disclosing the current disorder in the defense 
system -- instances of occasional abuse of one's powers, 
nonstatutory relations, poor nutrition, substandard living and 
sanitary conditions, mismanagement, financial violations, and 
chaos on the border. We believe, however, that the prevalent 
style in this committee is that of supervision and criticism, 
while its members imagine that they know everything about the 
national defense system. One must state that their criticism is 
not benevolent, and there are no constructive proposals on how 
to improve the current situation. Members of the National 
Security Committee have forgotten that their primary duty is to 
immediately impose order in the legal basis of the national 
defense system. Thus far, the Seimas has adopted neither a 
national security concept nor laws regulating young men's 
conscription to the active national defense service or a 
military statute, while the National Security Committee has 
shown no hurry to speed up their adoption. The fact that the 
National Defense Ministry budget was reduced on the initiative 
of this committee was particularly negative. It is extremely 
dangerous that the cut in finances for the national defense 
system and its ruthless criticism cause tension and 
dissatisfaction in the Army. Those who want to sustain tensions 
in the Army by trying to use it for the implementation of their 
political interests, take perfect advantage of these moods. It 
is not accidental that they are interested in the illegal 
activities of separate officers of the Volunteer National 
Defense Service [SKAT] and justify them by all means. We 
believe that direct responsibility for the delay in effective 
SKAT reform in preventing any chances for abuse rests with the 
National Security Committee. It is highly surprising that the 
committee hinders the national defense minister in every 
possible way, who seeks to preserve our Army's authority, 
concord, and peace, as well as the prestige of Lithuania's 
national defense system among Western states. 
  The Council of the Movement for National Progress 
categorically speaks out against the destruction of the national 
defense prestige, of the moral authority in the Army and the 
volunteer service, and the factual removal of Lithuania's 
defense system. We claim that all of this is currently being 
done by the Seimas National Security Committee. We appeal to 
the LDDP leadership and urge it to prevent this situation with 
practical deeds rather than declarations. We also appeal to the 
LDDP faction in the Seimas that it review the activities of its 
members who belong to the National Security Committee. We 
appeal to the leadership of the Lithuanian Seimas and its 
deputies requesting them to reform the National Security 
Committee and replace its leaders. We also appeal to A. 
Brazauskas, president of the Republic of Lithuania, so that he 
devote more attention to the national defense system, 
particularly to officers, begin supervising the Lithuanian Army, 
and prevent its thoughtless and dangerous destruction by his 
authority. The destruction of the national defense system that 
has not been fully formed can seriously harm the restoration of 
Lithuania's independence and its joining the ranks of democratic 
states.

  [Text] VILNIUS, Apr 13, BNS - The Lithuanian parliament on 
Tuesday [12 April] passed several amendments to the temporary 
law on the individual income tax, which was reduced to 33 
percent. 
  The amendments were adopted as a counterbalance to the 
value-added tax that comes into effect May 1. Experts suppose 
that the individual income tax will drop by an average of 7 to 8 
lits, while annual budget receipts should decrease by around 
100,000 lits. Smaller income taxes should compensate for the 
price-leap that is expected after the value-added tax is 
introduced. Prices are expected to jump by around 6 to 10 
percent. 
  The amended law provides not only for the reduction of the 
individual income tax, but also for a higher nontaxable income 
minimum. The amendments are temporary because a law on the 
general income tax has already been submitted to the parliament 
for consideration. The new tax will presumably come into effect 
next year. 
  On Tuesday, the parliament also fully approved the law on 
excises. The lawmakers changed their earlier decision not to 
impose excises on coffee and electricity.

  [Text] VILNIUS, April 13, ELTA -- "The new Lithuanian 
foreign policy in solving problems between Lithuania and Russia 
presents danger for Lithuania," the former Defence Minister 
Audrius Butkevicius said. 
  Butkevicius said that "Lithuania has never had any 
obligations to Russia as far as the withdrawal of Russian army 
is concerned." 
  Meanwhile, Lithuanian Government and General Prosecutor's 
Office publicized a joint statement which said that "Lithuania 
has carried out all the obligations to Russia by building houses 
for Russian officers in Kaliningrad enclave." According to 
Butkevicius, the houses in Kaliningrad enclave were built by the 
firm which had been chosen by Russian Defence Ministry and 
Baltic Military Navy. Butkevicius noted that it made possible to 
avoid the obligations to Russia.

  [Text] Vilnius, April 12, ELTA -- Chairman of social 
democratic party Aloyzas Sakalas and Deputy Chairman Vytenis 
Andriukaitis told a news conference on Tuesday [12 April] about 
the non-confidence to government which had been initiated by 
social democrats. 
  As it is already known, last week the social democrat 
faction 
started gathering signatures of the members of Seimas 
[parliament] in order to make a statement. Social democrats 
need signatures of 29 parliamentarians to begin the 
consideration of the non-confidence vote for Slezevicius 
government. 
  It was mentioned at the news conference that social 
democrtas 
had 20 signatures. Their activities were approved by National 
Union, democrats, centrists and some independent members of 
Seimas. Social democrats did not receive the support from 
conservatives, political prisoners and deportees and christian 
democrats. 
  Social democrats said at the news conference that 
non-confidence vote is to be given for the whole governemnt for 
the first time in Lithuania. They publicized a document of 40 
pages with the analysis of the government activities, which they 
called the substantiation of the non-confidence. 
  According social democrats, the governemnt should be changed 
because it had not carried out its obligations and duties. The 
government was also accused of poor state property and other 
reforms.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 12, BNS - Only two potential 
candidates submitted their applications to the Chief Election 
Commission [CEC] for participation in a by-election to the 
Lithuanian parliament. 
  Liudvikas Sabutis, member of the previous parliament, 
nominated by the Conservative Party, and Albinas Visockas, 
leader of the recently founded extreme-leftist Socialist Party, 
intend to compete for a vacant seat left by President Algirdas 
Brazauskas. 
  Although the Socialist Party is not yet officially 
registered, this is unlikely to prevent Visockas from being 
registered as a candidate because he collected the necessary 
1,000 signatures in his support. The CEC is scheduled to 
discuss registration of candidates Thursday. 
  The by-election in the Kaisiadorys district, where 
Brazauskas 
was elected to the parliament, is scheduled for May 15. This 
will be the third attempt to elect an MP in this district. 
  During earlier by-elections in the same district last summer 
and fall, none of the candidates received the necessary amount 
of votes. Sabutis held the lead in fall, but nevertheless failed 
to enter the parliament.

  [Text] The opposition in the Lithuanian Seimas 
[parliament] has circulated a statement on the registration of 
the newly founded Socialist Party. According to its founders, 
the new organization is a "party dedicated to working people" 
seeking to restore communist ideas. 
  In the opposition's opinion, before the new party is 
registered, it is necessary to establish the relations of its 
members with the subunit of the USSR Communist Party, which 
functioned illegally in Lithuania. 
  Representatives of the Lithuanian Ministry of Justice have 
reported that the rules for registering political organizations 
do not envision such a procedure. They have also said that thus 
far they have not received any official application from the 
Socialist Party requesting legalization.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 13, BNS -- Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas expressed grave concern about the extent of 
smuggling through Lithuanian territory. 
  At a meeting of the coordinative group for struggle against 
organized crime and corruption Tuesday [12 April], Brazauskas 
said criminals are able to freely cross the country's borders 
and to smuggle goods. 
  The president said the introduction of stickers for sealing 
legally imported liquor and tobacco products was "a farce" 
because the stickers can be easily forged. "Enough defaming 
Lithuania," Brazauskas said. 
  The meeting, devoted to smuggling problems, was attended by 
the leadership of the parliament, the Supreme Court, ministries 
of Defense and Justice, National Security Service, the Customs 
Department, the Border Defense Service, as well as officials 
from Ministries of Foreign Affairs and the Interior. 
  The meeting's participants said liquor and tobacco are 
currently the principal contraband goods, but metals, drugs, 
weapons, radioactive substances and even helicopters and planes 
are smuggled, as well. 
  Officials attributed the unsuccessful struggle against 
smugglers to imperfection of the legislation regulating 
activities of customs and border services. The meeting's 
participants also pointed to the lack of employees and the 
absence of a unified information network. 
  Jurgis Jurgelis, director of the National Security Service, 
emphasized that corruption "has reached such an extent in our 
society that we are starting to be known as barbarians." 
  President Brazauskas promised to work out recommendatory 
"formulas" for the institutions concerned and to hear reports 
about the work done at the next meeting.

<F P=106> [Report by Ceslovas Skarzinskas: "Some Crimes Have </F>
Declined, While Others Have Increased"] 
  [Excerpts] Yesterday's plenary meeting of the Interior 
Ministry Collegium was attended by President A. Brazauskas, 
Prime Minister A. Slezevicius, Seimas [parliament] Deputy 
Chairman E. Bickauskas, Prosecutor General A. Paulauskas, 
Justice Minister J. Prapiestis, Supreme Court Chairman M. Losys, 
V. Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas National Security 
Committee, many state officials, and leaders of police stations 
in towns and regions. 
  The criminal situation in Lithuania is complicated. The 
police have registered 12,848 crimes over the first three months 
of this year alone. Interior Minister R. Vaitekunas expressed 
his delight with the fact that the crime rate in the first 
quarter of this year has dropped by 18.8 percent in comparison 
with the same period last year. The situation is stabilizing. 
However, the number of grave crimes increased in the beginning 
of this year and reached a total of 2,239. The only consolation 
is that a large number of these crimes -- 44.5 percent -- have 
been solved. Criminals have used firearms 105 times this year. 
It is difficult to predict what will happen in Lithuania now 
that the official permit to buy firearms for self-defense came 
into effect on 1 April. 
  Incidentally, the rate of thefts of personal, state, and 
stockholders' property has declined. 
  Minister Vaitekunas' assessment of the law on preventive 
detention was very positive. It may be this law that helped 
disclose a larger number of grave crimes. For example, 75 
people have been detained under this law this year. However, 
there is no place to hold detained people. Currently, there are 
1,400 suspects in confinement cells. Jails are overcrowded with 
prisoners. The meeting addressed the expansion of new 
confinement facilities. [passage omitted] 
  The last speaker to address the meeting was President A. 
Brazauskas, who assessed the work of the Interior Ministry 
favorably. After the restoration of independence, there were 
attempts to politicize the ministry. The president said that 
free market relations triggered corruption and led to a number 
of other problems in the country. 
  The president placed emphasis on economic crimes. "We," said 
A. Brazauskas, "collect only about 60 percent of taxes from 
organizations. Private firms employ 55 percent of the 
population. Do they settle their accounts with the state? It is 
necessary to apply police measures here." 
  Among other economic crimes, the president mentioned the 
"Sekunde" bank, which deceived 14,000 depositors. He also 
criticized self-governments that engage in politics instead of 
dealing with municipal problems. They should be a serious help 
for the police. Participants in the meeting also discussed 
contraband, border defense, and bribery. 
  Successful attempts to suppress the surge of crime will 
depend on joint and resolute actions of all judicial 
institutions. This idea was voiced by all the speakers.

  [Excerpt] The Lithuanian budget is in a very difficult 
state, according to Vice Minister of Finance Reinoldijus 
Sarkinas. This has happened because the wages for the officials 
at some organizations, maintained from the budget, have not been 
included in good time. Lithuanian TV forecasts that the payment 
of wages will be late in May, too. 
  According to Sarkinas, the situation in the fulfillment of 
the budget became especially bad during the first three months 
of this year. For example, in December 1993 the national budget 
received revenue in sum of 385 million litas, whereas in 
February and March only 285 million litas were received in each 
month. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 13 April, TASS -- Russian Ambassador at Large 
Yuriy Dubinin and Russian Navy Commander Admiral Feliks Gromov 
failed to reach Odessa on Wednesday where they planned to probe 
into the recent incidents. 
  Dubinin and Gromov are currently staying in Sevastopol as 
the 
Ukrainian side refused to allow them to enter Odessa, the Black 
Sea Fleet press centre quoted both men as saying at a joint news 
conference in Sevastopol on Wednesday. 
  "While one side is studying the situation on the spot the 
other has been denied such a possibility, it is extremely hard 
to establish the truth," Gromov said. 
  At the same time, he said that the research ship Cheleken 
which brought radar equipment from Odessa to Sevastopol did not 
violate Russian-Ukrainian agreements. However, the incidents in 
Odessa, including the seizure of a Black Sea Fleet reserve unit, 
"violate the spirit and the letter of the Massandra and other 
agreements," he added. 
  He stressed that a Navy personnel department official has 
been sent to Odessa to find out the composition of the unit, how 
many sailors have taken the Ukrainian oath of allegiance, 
conditions of life and work in the unit and other circumstances. 
  The participants in the press conference said that the 
incidents will be discussed at the upcoming round of 
Russian-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea Fleet due to take place 
in Moscow at the end of April. 
  Gromov believes "it is necessary to do everything possible 
in 
order not to whip up tension in the fleet." He said the Russian 
Navy is determined to "resolve all disputes over the fleet on a 
legal basis within the context of strengthening state relations 
between the Slavic states." 
  He expressed the hope that the forthcoming talks will 
facilitate the implementation of the previously reached 
agreements to hand over Ukraine's part of the fleet to the 
Russian Navy. He regretted that since September 1993 Russia has 
been financing the fleet alone, although under the agreement 
Ukraine is supposed to cover 50 per cent of the expenses. 
Moreover, Ukraine has imposed customs duties, fines and even 
tax on land on the Black Sea Fleet, while exempting its own 
Armed Forces. "If the Black Sea Fleet is fully financed by the 
Russian Federation, it should become Russian," Gromov concluded.

  [Excerpt] The issue of the Black Sea Fleet is to be 
resolved in the spirit of the Massandra protocol. A provisional 
understanding to this effect has been reached in Kiev at the 
meeting of the Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk with a 
Russian delegation which included, among other participants, 
Yuriy Dubinin, a special envoy of the Russian Foreign Ministry, 
and the commander in chief of the Russian Navy, Admiral Feliks 
Gromov. I would like to remind you that under the Massandra 
document the Ukrainian part of the Black Sea Fleet is to be 
handed over to Russia as a part payment towards Ukraine's debt 
for the Russian energy resources. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Viktoria Mstislavsakaya </F>
for TASS] 
  [Text] Odessa 13 April, TASS -- A total of 39 officers and 
warrant officers of the 318th Division of the Black Sea Fleet 
swore allegiance to Ukraine. Now, they will serve in a newly 
formed division of naval border guard ships belonging to the 
Ukrainian Navy. 
  Apart from the newcomers, the new division of the Ukrainian 
Navy includes the entire 46th Hydro-Region, consisting of two 
hydrographers, eight boats, a radio-technical unit and auxiliary 
services. This is presumed to be the result of a recent 
incident involving the "Cheleken" hydrographer, which was barred 
from leaving the sea port of Odessa. 
  Commander of the Western Naval Region of the Ukrainian Navy, 
Captain First rank Dmitriy Ukrainets, told a correspondent of 
the UKRINFORM news agency that the main cause of the incident in 
Odessa was an attempt to rob the ship. "The problem of the 
division of the fleet, its property and equipment has not been 
finally resolved yet, and some `anxious servicemen' are trying 
to grab as much as possible" Ukrainets said.

  [Text] An assembly of Black Sea Fleet officers has 
condemned "the openly confrontational actions by Ukrainian 
servicemen with respect to Black Sea Fleet units in Odessa." 
The officers took as a basis a resolution where they stated 
their complete lack of confidence in the Ukrainian Defense 
Ministry and personally Ukrainian Naval Forces Commander Rear 
Admiral Vladimir Bezkorovainy. 
  The officers hoped that the Ukrainian president would not 
approve the actions by the Ukrainian servicemen who attacked 
Black Sea Fleet units in Odessa and would take corresponding 
measures against the organizers of the large-scale provocation 
in Odessa. 
  The officers said the conflict was "pushing them to respond 
in kind." They recalled that the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's 
unilateral attempts to seize a fireboat in May 1993 triggered 
off an outbreak of indignation in the entire fleet which 
resulted in hoisting historical St.Andrew's crosses on 226 
vessels. The officers were quoted as saying that "there were 
neither common sense in the actions by the Ukrainian Defense 
Ministry, nor reasons that would prevent Black Sea Fleet from 
voicing their protest in this way," i.e. hoist Russian St. 
Andrew's crosses once again. 
  The chairman of the committee coordinating the activities of 
officers' assemblies in the entire Black Sea Fleet, Valeriy 
Volodin, told the meeting that there had been no contact with 
the fleet's units stationed in Odessa for five days. The Army 
telephone exchange is at a standstill. 
  The wives of Odessa navymen had been calling via public 
telephone networks to say the Ukrainian command was still 
applying pressure upon the personnel of the vessel conservation 
group and the hydrographic unit. Representatives of the Russian 
command and the Black Sea Fleet had not been admitted to the 
territory of the unit. 
  Interfax learned that many of the officers supported a 
proposal to withdraw Ukrainian troops from Crimea. In addition, 
some proposed not to admit the Ukrainian vessel Slavutich to the 
main base of the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol until the issue 
was solved.

Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky; Edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Well-informed sources in the Ukrainian cabinet have 
informed INTERFAX that President Leonid Kravchuk is planning to 
discuss with President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow on Friday [15 
April] the incident involving a Russian hydrographic ship and 
the detention of Black Sea Fleet officers by a Ukrainian special 
force in Odessa. IF Note: The possibility of a special 
Ukrainian-Russian summit was reportedly discussed during a 
Monday telephone conversation between Kravchuk and the Russian 
Prime-Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. On 10 April some 120 
Ukrainian troops stormed a group of conservation ships of the 
Black Sea Fleet in Odessa. Several naval officers were 
detained. Later they were released at the demand of the Russian 
government. 
  A high-ranking Ukrainian government expert has told the 
press 
in Kiev that the leaders of the two countries will hopefully 
find a way out of the present situation. He said Ukraine 
continues to insist on resolving the problem on the basis of 
Yalta, Zavidovo and Massandra agreements. (In Zavidovo it was 
agreed that the fleet would be equally divided between Ukraine 
and Russia while the Massandra protocol implied the surrender of 
the entire fleet to Russia -- INTERFAX.) 
  The expert said it is impossible to drag out the solution of 
the situation any longer. He hoped that both sides will have 
enough common sense to prevent an open armed conflict. 
  He said that during the Tuesday talks in Kiev with a Russian 
delegation that included the Chief Commander of the Russian Navy 
Feliks Gromov and the ambassador at large Yuriy Dubinin no 
decisions were made. 
  The expert believes that the aggravation of the conflict 
benefits "pro-imperial" forces in the Russian leadership. He 
said that there are people in the Russian presidential council, 
in particular Sergey Karaganov and Andranik Migranian, who want 
to strip Ukraine of its independence.

  [Text] The Black Sea Fleet ships stationed in Sevastopol, 
for instance the Admiral Golovko rocket cruiser, are being 
urgently supplied with armaments. This was announced to 
INTERFAX-Ukraine by Chief of the Ukrainian Navy press center, 
Nikolay Savchenko. He said the ships were prepared for military 
action. 
  Savchenko also announced that several Ukrainian fleet ships, 
for instance the Getman Sagaidachny patrol ship and the Lutsk 
antisubmarine cruiser had not been supplied with electric power 
from the land. The Black See Fleet's command explained this by 
nonpayment for electric power already delivered. However, the 
Ukrainian Navy financial service said Kiev had no debts.

  [Text] This afternoon, Ukrainian servicemen seized one 
large and one medium amphibious vessels of the 318th vessel 
conservation group of the Black Sea Fleet stationed in Odessa. 
The press office of the Black Sea Fleet told Interfax that the 
Ukrainians also seized the group's training camp and hoisted 
Ukrainian national flags there. 
  The families of 18 officers and warrant officers, including 
the group's chief of staff, Second Captain Aleksandr Zelenko, 
and the commander of a coastal base, Second Captain Dmitriy 
Starikov, who refused to take an oath to Ukraine were expelled 
out of their apartments on the same day. 
  According to the press office, the navymen and their 
families 
are sitting on their suitcases on the street waiting for 
evacuation to Sevastopol. 
  In the meantime, Kiev stated it was forming its first coast 
guards brigade on the basis of the 318th vessel conservation 
division of the Black Sea Fleet which was dissolved after an 
incident with the hydrographic vessel Cheleken. Ukrainian 
Defense Minister appointed Second Captain Mikhail Marchenko as 
the commander of the brigade on 10 April. 
  The press office of the Odessa military district said that 
22 
out of 34 warrant officers and four out of 11 officers of the 
318th group had already taken an oath to Ukraine. 
  The Odessa military district commander, Lieutenant General 
Vladimir Shkitchenko, told the former 318th group's command on 
12 April on behalf of the Ukrainian defense minister that he 
guaranteed "those officers who do not want to serve in the 
Ukrainian navy the possibility to leave for any other place 
without any obstacles." 
  "The seeing-off ceremony for the navymen leaving for another 
place of service will be organized with the adequate military 
honors," the Odessa military district press office assured 
Interfax. "The officers and warrant officers will be paid their 
salaries until the last days of their service in the Odessa 
garrison." 
  In the meantime, the press office head, Vyacheslav Voronkov, 
told INTERFAX that the Ukrainian Navy took under control the 
Nikolayev and Odessa hydrographic districts on 11 April in 
accordance with an order by the Ukrainian defense minister. 
  In particular, the Ukrainian navy created its first 
hydrographic district headed by Third Captain Nikolay Zakharov 
on the basis of the former Black Sea Fleet's 46th hydrographic 
district. The new Ukrainian unit includes 11 servicemen, 
including 10 officers and one warrant officer. As many as seven 
of them have already taken an oath to Ukraine.

  [Text] This is a report by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
of Ukraine. 
  On 13 April Ostankino TV carried information to the effect 
that an agreement on solving the Black Sea Fleet issues on the 
basis of the Massandra protocol was allegedly reached during the 
negotiations in Kiev. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
reports that this does not comply with reality. Ukraine 
proceeds from the necessity of a comprehensive approach toward 
the Black Sea Fleet issue, with regard to the provisions of the 
Dagomys, Yalta, and Zavidovo agreements, as well as the 
Massandra protocol. 
  Besides, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine points 
out that the Ostankino report about the visit by the 
representatives of the Russian Government to Odessa also fails 
to correspond to reality. Contrary to the agreements reached in 
Kiev, Russian Navy Commander in Chief Feliks Gromov undermined 
the meeting with the command and the officers' personnel of the 
Black Sea Fleet to be held jointly with the Ukrainian side. Such 
reports and actions, underlines the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
show who is really standing in the way of a just solution to the 
Black Sea Fleet issue.

  [Text] Sevastopol, 13 Apr -- Over 300 delegates from 
military units, establishments, and services of the main base of 
the Black Sea Fleet and the fleet's garrisons gathered today in 
the Sailors' Club for an officers' meeting. There were no 
representatives of the command at the meeting; it was organized 
and conducted by the leaders of the fleet's Council of Officers' 
Meetings. The officers discussed the situation connected with 
the events in Odessa. 
  The meeting passed a resolution expressing no-confidence in 
the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and in Vice Admiral Vladimir 
Beskaravaynyy, commander of the Ukrainian Navy. The meeting 
again called the attention of the presidents of Ukraine and 
Russia to the need to speed up the adoption of a decision on the 
Black Sea Fleet. The resolution called on the newly-elected 
Crimean Supreme Soviet to examine whether it is expedient to 
have the many military formations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces 
on the territory of the republic. The resolution also appealed 
to the deputies of the town soviets of Odessa, Sevastopol, 
Ochakov, Izmail, and Nikolayev to discuss the Odessa events and 
give their assessment of them. The officers' meeting was very 
stormy and showed that the officers by no means believe that 
they should refrain from interfering in political processes.

  [Text] Problems of the Black Sea Fleet are going to be 
resolved in the spirit of the Massandra protocol. A preliminary 
understanding to this end was reached last Tuesday in Kiev at 
the meeting of President Leonid Kravchuk and a Russian 
delegation, which included among others ambassador Yuriy Dubinin 
and the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy Admiral Feliks 
Gromov. This was reported to the press on Wednesday in 
Sevastopol by Admiral Gromov who came to the Crimea together 
with Dubinin to study the situation involving the fleet. 
  Under the Massandra protocol the Ukrainian part of the fleet 
should be surrendered to Russia as a form of payment for 
Ukrainian debts for Russian fuel and energy supplies. 
  However, according to well-informed sources in the staff of 
the fleet, the essence of the protocol is going to be slightly 
changed. Russia will be getting only the part of the fleet 
stationed in Sevastopol together with the infrastructure of the 
city. Ukraine will keep the other naval facilities and ships 
located and stationed in Ukraine and Crimea. 
  Dubinin described the meeting with Kravchuk as constructive. 
He said that immediately after returning to Moscow the Russian 
delegation is going to submit a detailed report about its visit 
to Kiev and Sevastopol to the president and prime minister. 
Dubinin and Gromov hope that the information about the meeting 
with Kravchuk and the report as a whole will help ease the 
tension caused by the latest incidents related to the fleet and 
resolve the fleet problem as a whole. 
  Gromov regretted the refusal of the Ukrainian authorities to 
permit the Russian delegation to Odessa where it intended to 
sort out the difficulties. He stressed that it is quite 
difficult to establish the truth and added that he did not see 
anything wrong in the steps taken by the Cheleken ship. Last 
Saturday the ship took navigation equipment from Odessa to 
Sevastopol. 
  "That is why I think the conflict was to a certain extent 
provoked by the actions of Ukrainian naval representatives who 
came to detain the hydrographic vessel," Gromov said. According 
to him, the seizure of the conservation ships in Odessa was a 
direct violation of all agreements between Russia and Ukraine.

  [Text] Kiev 13 April, UKRINFORM-TASS -- The first shipment 
of nuclear fuel cassettes has arrived from Russia at Europe's 
largest nuclear power station in Zaporizhzhe, Ukraine. It is a 
compensation for the nuclear warheads Ukraine has dismantled. 
  This means that practical implementation has begun of the 
measures envisioned in the trilateral statement signed by the 
presidents of Russia, Ukraine, and the United States in Moscow 
in January. According to specialists, the fuel delivered to the 
Zaporizhzhe nuclear power station will suffice to keep one of 
five power-generating units operating for a year and give 
Ukraine 5.5 to 6 billion kW hours of cheap electricity.

  [Text] Kiev 13 April, TASS -- We are greatly concerned over 
the fact that NATO had to launch air strikes against Bosnian 
Serb positions and view them as the last resort. However, we 
understand that NATO was forced to resort to this drastic 
measure, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told a 
briefing on Wednesday. 
  "We are above all concerned over the failed attempts to 
solve 
the conflict in this region by political means," he noted. "We 
believe there is a possibility of going ahead with political 
dialogue, which successfully got under way in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina," the foreign minister stressed. "In my 
opinion, a positive solution to it is quite possible. We see to 
it that the situation remain under control, since a lot of U.N. 
peacekeeping forces are deployed in this region, including our 
Ukrainian battalion. I think we are doing our utmost to prevent 
any unpredictable developments there, the more so as the 
situation is under control of U.N. troops and NATO forces. I 
believe the conflict will be avoided," Zlenko emphasised.

  [Text] Kiev, 12 Apr -- As the main center for public 
relations of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs has 
reported, the decision by President Meshkov of Crimea to dismiss 
Major General Oleksandr Plyuta, the minister of internal 
affairs, and the appointment of Valeriy Kuznetsov, a former 
military general, in his place, is another step that will 
exacerbate the political situation on the peninsula and 
undermine friendly relations between Russia and Ukraine. 
  "The violation of legal norms on the part of the state 
structures of the autonomous Republic with regard to the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs' leadership and attempts to resolve 
the problem through uncivilized methods are causing tension in 
the militia's activity. All this could lead to adverse 
consequences," the statement from the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs reads. "On the basis of the Ukrainian `Law on the 
Militia' dated 20 December 1990, the militia of our state is a 
single system of organs that are part of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs structure and are subordinate to it in their 
activities. With the exception of rayon and municipal branches, 
the leadership of internal affairs bodies is appointed 
personally by the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine. 
  "Such cadre changes, therefore, are exclusively of a 
political nature, do not contribute to the strengthening of 
lawfulness in the state, and lead to confrontation in society. 
It is all the more dangerous when it concerns armed formations 
-- subdivisions of the militia which have a duty to protect the 
law, honor, life, and property interests of citizens." 
  The statement stresses: "The abovementioned decrees of the 
Crimean president concerning changes to the leadership of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of the autonomous republic should 
be repealed in so far as they do not conform with current 
Ukrainian legislation." 
  The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine has called on 
the 
president, the Supreme Council, the government, the populace, 
and the officials of the internal affairs bodies of the Republic 
of Crimea to show awareness, public consciousness, restraint, 
and respect for the current Constitution of Ukraine.

  [Text] Simferopol [no date as received] -- The Crimean 
president's press service circulated a statement on 12 April 
saying: "Kiev is trying to deprive the president and government 
of Crimea of real power levers, take the militia, the Security 
Service, communications, television and radio out of our 
control, cram the peninsula with troops and military technology, 
lower the Republic's status to that of an oblast, and smother 
the Crimeans' will for independent and responsible 
decisionmaking." The statement said the appointment of Ukraine's 
presidential representative is regarded as an attempt to sow 
seeds of discord in Crimea. The press service called on all 
enterprise and organization managers to obey the decisions of 
the president, Supreme Council, and government of Crimea 
"without entering into contact with the illegally appointed 
Ukraine's presidential representative in Crimea." The citizens 
of Crimea are invited to express their attitude to this power 
institution. In Yuriy Meshkov's opinion, Ukraine's moves are 
aimed at preventing him from pursuing economic reforms and fully 
restoring the Crimean Constitution. 
  A rally was held on the same day in support of Crimean 
President Meshkov, and in the evening tents were set up by the 
building of the Crimean Supreme Council at the initiative of 
Russian Society leader Anatoliy Los and Oleksandr Kanafyev. 
Crimea's political leaders said they were ready to take up arms 
to defend Yuriy Meshkov and Crimea's state independence and 
called on the people of Simferopol to bring warm clothes and 
join the vigil at the tents. Some of the speakers said two 
planes were due to arrive in Simferopol from Kiev carrying the 
special task force, and no one knew what would happen; therefore 
it was necessary to keep calm and resist the Ukrainian 
leadership's provocations. 
  The night by the building of the Crimean Supreme Council 
went 
by uneventfully. Organizers did not say when the tents would be 
taken down but promised they would be there as long as 
necessary.

  [Text] A report by the Main Public Relations Center of the 
Internal Affairs Ministry of Ukraine qualifies the decrees by 
the president of Crimea on the dismissal of Oleksandr Plyuta, 
the internal affairs minister of the autonomy, and the 
appointment of Former Military General Valeriy Kuznetsov to his 
post as yet another step toward aggravating the situation on the 
peninsula. 
  The document, in particular, points out that yet another 
attempt was made to involve the law enforcement bodies in 
political battles, Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry in 
particular. All this may lead to negative consequences. 
  On the strength of the law of Ukraine on militia, the report 
also says, the militia of our state is a single system of bodies 
that are part of the structure of the Internal Affairs Ministry 
of Ukraine and whose activities are subordinated to it. The 
leading personnel of the interior bodies, excluding rayon and 
city departments, are appointed by the internal affairs minister 
of Ukraine personally. Therefore, underlines the Main Public 
Relations Center, such a personnel reshuffling has exclusively 
political essence, it does not promote consolidation of 
lawfulness in the state and leads to confrontation in society. 
  The above decrees by the president of the Crimea Republic on 
changes in the leadership of the Internal Affairs Ministry of 
the autonomous republic must be cancelled as such that do not 
comply with the legislation currently in force in Ukraine.

  [Text] A press group of the Crimean Security Service has 
circulated the following report: On 11 April, the president of 
the autonomy, Yuriy Meshkov, notified Crimean Security Service 
personnel of the decrees that terminated the plenary powers of 
its head, Major-General Ivan Kolomytsev, and appointed Volodymyr 
Lepikhov, who was transferred from the armed forces to the 
reserve 18 months ago in the same rank of Major-General, to this 
post. 
  On the same day, the Crimean Security Service received a 
telegram from the leader of the Security Service of Ukraine, 
Yevhen Marchuk, in which the above decrees are qualified as 
running contrary to the constitutions and the laws of Ukraine 
and Crimea, which regulate the order of appointments to and 
dismissals from this post. 
  At the same time, Ivan Kolomytsev was told to continue 
fulfilling the duties with which he was charged. At present, 
the personnel of the Security Service are carrying out planned 
operational-procedural activity on guaranteeing security and 
maintaining civil peace and accord in Crimea. 
  The press group summarizes this by indicating that the 
situation brought about by Yuriy Meshkov's decrees is fraught 
with the threat to the inviolability of the principle of 
lawfulness in the formation and activities of the security 
service bodies and the implementation of constitutional powers 
by this service. 
  The press group expresses the hope that the precedent, which 
occurred exceptionally on the principles of legality, law and 
order, and respect of the rights and freedoms of every citizen, 
will be solved.

  [Text] [Announcer] The press center of Ukraine's Cabinet of 
Ministers has circulated a statement for the media concerning 
the activities of Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma 
which our colleague Anatoliy Komirenko will read for you. 
  [Begin Komirenko recording] Leonid Kuchma, a recent prime 
minister, now president of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists 
and Entrepreneurs, has been remarkably active lately. Numerous 
press interviews by the former prime minister have appeared in 
Ukraine and neighboring countries, in which, using more slogans 
than facts, he embarks on a search for scapegoats for the 
present difficult economic situation in Ukraine. 
  In his latest press appearances, he puts the blame on the 
so-called "Party of Power," the present government. Strangely 
enough, in none of his appearances does Leonid Kuchma associate 
himself with this party, although only six months ago he was one 
of the top state officials who determined the country's 
political and economic course, and therefore, commanded 
considerable powers to overcome the crisis. 
  Taking the office of prime minister in Autumn 1992, Leonid 
Kuchma declared his readiness to take upon himself 
responsibility for the state of affairs in the economy. In 
order to cure it, his government was granted the widest of 
powers. Incidentally, despite the complexity of the situation, 
the objective opportunities for a comprehensive reform in the 
Ukrainian economy then were tangibly better than now. But did 
Leonid Kuchma take advantage of them? The answer is evident 
from the results of economic management in 1993, when it was 
Kuchma who headed the government: A complete imbalance of 
macroeconomic parameters that is having an extremely negative 
effect on the present state of the economy, a 100-fold retail 
price rise twice exceeding the rate of wage increase. The wage 
share in a product's cost price has shrunk almost two-fold. If 
one should also take into account the devaluation of the 
population's savings, one can safely say that last year every 
resident of Ukraine became much poorer than he was before Prime 
Minister Leonid Kuchma took office. One should be reminded that 
at his initiative the indexation of the population's incomes, as 
well as the publication of price indexes for consumer goods, 
were terminated. The former prime minister is currently passing 
himself for a mouthpiece of producers' interests. But how did 
they fare under his leadership? 
  During the time Leonid Kuchma was government head, taxes 
grew 
significantly and huge excise taxes were introduced. All this 
befell the producer as a heavy burden and undermined 
entrepreneurship. Creditor's indebtedness among enterprises has 
grown 62 times over the past year, as a result of which the most 
severe crisis of payments got under way, whose consequences are 
reflected today in full measure in a decline of production, 
overdue wages payments, and other disorders. The growth in the 
budget profits was ensured not by the economy's incomes, but by 
monetary emission. 
  In his time, holding the high post, Leonid Kuchma accused 
the 
National Bank of the karbovanets collapse, however, with the 
17-fold growth in emission last year, the exchange rate of the 
Ukrainian currency per dollar fell 36 times. As a whole, with 
the three-fold devaluation of the dollar in Ukraine taken into 
account, the purchasing capacity of the karbovanets decreased 
100 times. This is not the fault of the National Bank but the 
result of the absolutely unbalanced foreign economic and 
currency policy by the Kuchma government, which caused the 
outflow of money and capitals from Ukraine. 
  Legal relations in the state were significantly affected by 
the hasty decree-making activity by Leonid Kuchma. The 
abrogation or amendment of many enactments and their separate 
provisions brought more confusion into legislation than order. 
It is in the times that Leonid Kuchma headed the government, 
that they began to impose a thesis on Ukraine's feebleness upon 
society and disbelief in our state's ability to get out of the 
crisis situation. 
  Obviously, Leonid Kuchma's personal inability to fulfill his 
numerous promises to restore order in Ukraine and raise people's 
living standards was far from playing the least important role 
in this. 
  To a great extent the miscalculations made by the Kuchma 
team 
conditioned the worsening of the economic situation in the 
Crimea Republic, resulting in the formation of anti-Ukrainian 
sentiments there. Firstly, a ban on the export of agricultural 
produce, grown on subsidiary plots of land, to Russia and other 
countries, which were traditional markets to sell that produce, 
affected Crimea more than other regions of the country. 
  A cunning blow against one of Crimea's leading industries -- 
wine-making -- was the introduction of high excise duties for 
its products, at the same time, with the abolition of excise 
duties for imported, often low-quality, beverages. As a result 
of this arbitrary rule, the viability of world-famous Crimean 
wines was artificially undermined, which led to a decline in 
their production. Finally, the third blow against the Crimean 
economy was the decisions preventing the development of lease 
relations that had gained wide popularity, particularly in 
Crimea. 
  One's attention is caught by Leonid Kuchma's attempt to 
gamble on such a topical issue as Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. 
In one of his latest interviews, he is threatening, with a 
multitude of economic and environmental consequences involved, 
to implement the trilateral statement by the presidents of 
Ukraine, Russia, and the United States. But it is Leonid 
Kuchma's signature that was put under the Massandra Protocol of 
3 September 1993 on the withdrawal of all nuclear warheads from 
Ukraine in the course of 24 months! So, when did he really 
defend state interests? Last autumn in Crimea, or during his 
interviews this spring? 
  Leonid Kuchma puts most of the blame on those members of 
government whom he personally invited to join his cabinet. 
Although, it is they who now have to put out the fire of the 
crisis which they could not do last year, working under the 
former prime minister's leadership. Perhaps, one should not pay 
attention to all this. All sorts of things can be heard and 
read at a time of a great public and political campaign, like 
the recent and upcoming elections to the top state institutions. 
However, the arguments and slogans used by Leonid Kuchma more 
often than not mislead entrepreneurs and citizens in Ukraine and 
those states whose papers publish his interviews. Take, for 
example, the accusation against the present state leadership of 
choosing the road of self-isolation. The reality proves 
different. In actual fact, Ukraine is now following the road of 
consolidating its state independence, at the same time, 
establishing mutually beneficial economic and political 
cooperation with the countries of both the West and East. 
  Suffice it to say that 35 various economic agreements have 
been concluded with Russia alone, 28 agreements with Belarus, 25 
agreements with Kazakhstan, 23 agreements with Kyrgyzstan, 16 
agreements with Uzbekistan, and 13 agreements with Turkmenistan. 
At the latest meeting of the heads of state and government of 
the CIS countries alone, which took place in Ashgabat in 
December 1993, Ukraine's representatives signed about 20 
bilateral documents, the majority of which dealt with economy. 
  Ukraine, as a cofounder of the Parliamentary Assembly of the 
Black Sea Economic Cooperation [PACZES], is working out draft 
agreements on a significant expansion of mutually advantageous 
contacts with the PACZES countries: Turkey, Romania, Armenia, 
Azerbaijan, Albania, Georgia, and Russia. 
  Greece, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Poland expressed their wish 
to join PACZES. Recently Ukraine, by the way, the first among 
the CIS countries, initialled the agreement on partnership and 
cooperation with the European Union which lifts restrictions on 
our trade relations with the EEC countries. Such a balanced 
policy will promote the stabilization of Ukraine's economy. And 
if it were not for the consequences of numerous incompetent 
decisions made by the Leonid Kuchma government in the first half 
of 1993, which the present-day government has to overcome and 
the fruit of which all the citizens of Ukraine have to reap, the 
economic situation could have been stabilized much sooner. 
  The Cabinet of Ministers is working on the implementation of 
a program aimed at overcoming the crisis phenomena in economy 
and improving people's living conditions in 1994. It is exactly 
this that the government of Ukraine regards to be its duty.

statement by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine in connection

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM-TASS] </F>
  [Text] Kiev 13 April, TASS -- The press service of the 
Crimean Security Department issued a statement on Wednesday 
denouncing Kiev's response to the latest appointment of a new 
department head decreed by the Crimean president. 
  "The latest steps by Kiev hinder the fulfilment by the 
Crimean Security Department its constitutional duties and 
infringe moral losses to its personnel," the statement said. 
  On Monday, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov dismissed Kiev's 
appointee Major-General Ivan Kolymtsev from the post of the 
local security chief and replaced him by his own protege, 
Retired Major-General Vladimir Lepikhov. 
  Security bosses in Kiev responded instantly with an angry 
message signed by Yevgueny Marchuk, head of the republican 
Security Service. The message commanded Kolymtsev to ignore 
Meshkov's decree and continue to run the office and qualified 
Meshkov's decree as unconstitutional. 
  The UKRINFORM report did not specify which of the two 
generals exactly runs the department today, but at least "all 
scheduled operations to safeguard security and civil accord on 
the Peninsula are being conducted normally", the press service 
stated.

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Pikhovshek, Vybor, under the rubric </F>
"Whom We Elect": "Ivan Stepanovich Versus Leonid Makarovich"] 
  [Text] Against the background of Leonid Kravchuk's 
continuous statements regarding the "chaos in which the new 
Ukrainian parliament will be elected," and the 
"inappropriateness of holding presidential elections in the 
environment of instability in society," the almost demonstrative 
silence of Ivan Plyushch, the parliament speaker and Kravchuk's 
main potential rival in the elections, looks quite telling. An 
interesting trend is emerging: The more convincingly L.M. 
maintains that "parliamentary elections" will not take place 
(and the hypnotic persistence with which he keeps repeating it 
begins to border on a call to boycott the elections), the more 
Central Executive Committee Chairman Ivan Yemets and GOLOS 
UKRAINY--both subordinate to Kravchuk--print documents on the 
upcoming presidential elections. 
  It appears that Ivan Plyushch is indeed the obstacle against 
which Kravchuk's hopes to ward off the new parliament's work ran 
aground. The president's game plan is becoming increasingly 
transparent by the day: to stall under any pretext--even, as 
some people on Grushevskiy Street maintain, by resorting to 
presidential rule--his own reelection; and it is only possible 
to impose such rule by provoking the population to 
nonparticipation in the elections on a massive scale. That 
Kravchuk's contention regarding a "power vacuum in the state" 
is, to put it mildly, somewhat exaggerated seems to be clear to 
everyone but the president: The old Supreme Council, in 
accordance with current legislation, retains its powers until 
the first session of the new Supreme Council. Therefore, the 
president's words may be interpreted in a purely human context, 
as an awareness as to how much a person may not want successful 
elections to the parliament, from which one may expect 
anything--for instance, reaffirming the June elections or a 
decision that Ukraine will be a parliamentary Republic 
altogether. 
  The conflict between the two parts of the nomenklatura has 
reached its apogee. Ivan Stepanovich made an effort in advance 
to ensure that Kravchuk would not have substantial influence on 
the conduct of elections by, among other things, placing his own 
people in charge of electoral commissions at all levels. "The 
subsequent course of events," says a man who works on the 
speaker's staff and is knowledgeable about the rules of 
nomenklatura games, "was not difficult to foresee. Kravchuk's 
people added a great number of candidates in the districts in 
order to confuse the voters and thus get the elections 
postponed." It appears that the only factor that works for 
Kravchuk in carrying out his plan is the weather, since sunny 
days may prompt practical Ukrainians to tend to more practical 
matters than politics--for instance, vegetable gardens. There 
are some signs, however, that Plyushch's people have considered 
this possibility, too. "Ivan Stepanovich is also a skillful 
apparatchik," says my interlocutor, "and some preparations have 
been made in this respect, too" (meaning apparently the decision 
to hold the elections on any day before 10 April of this 
year--ed.). That is, as long as Plyushch can influence the 
course of elections, there is still hope that they will take 
place after all. 
  There is another substantial factor that now has been added 
to the fight for parliament seats and possibly for the right to 
be the president. The speaker's chances to claim the presidency 
are currently higher than ever. It is quite possible that his 
plans for the future presidency are the main reason why the 
Supreme Council never adopted the package of laws defining the 
functions and substantially limiting the rights of a "popularly 
elected" one. 
  Undoubtedly, in today's Ukraine Ivan Plyushch is the man who 
in real terms and to considerable degree shapes the political 
situation. He has a phenomenal memory, incredible capacity for 
work, and his skill in manipulating parliament is amazing. There 
have been practically no instances of the Supreme Council 
approving something contrary to the speaker's wish, or not 
approving something when Ivan Plyushch wanted it approved. He is 
very set in his views, and it is extraordinarily difficult to 
convince him that the opposite point of view may be the correct 
one. Only once did he admit openly at a presidium meeting that 
giving L. Kuchma's government the right to issue legislative 
acts had been a tremendous mistake on the part of himself, the 
speaker. It was easy to see with the naked eye, however, how 
hard it was for Ivan Plyushch to bring himself to admit this. 
  One can say almost with certainty that in the near future 
the 
determinant influence in Ukrainian political life will be that 
of the relations, mutual counteraction, and tactical compromises 
between the parliamentary and executive nomenklatura groups 
headed by L. Kravchuk and I. Plyushch. 
  Comparing their chances, one observes first and foremost 
that 
the president is playing for "maintaining" the situation on the 
current level, and as is known, he who stays in place loses more 
often. Ivan Plyushch, however, is very interesting now in his 
silent importance--the eloquent silence of a man who is 
stubbornly climbing to the pinnacle of power.

  [Text] Moscow, 13 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- A representative from 
the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs today released the 
following statement: 
  Moscow is following the development of events in the former 
Yugoslavia and around it with concern and responsibility. The 
NATO air strikes of 10 and 11 April have substantially 
aggravated the military and political situation. The Russian 
side repeatedly warned of this. The international community 
must now act urgently to save the situation. Russia's resolve 
to continue its initiatives in this direction has been confirmed 
by its president and foreign minister, the Russian president's 
special representative is working actively in the region. 
  We are worried that the statements made in support of the 
act 
of force in Gorazde, by many Western leaders, could lead to 
reliance on force in Bosnian and in world affairs in general. 
Reports have already appeared about discussions in NATO 
headquarters of new ultimatums to the Serbs, by-passing the 
United Nations. We do not accept this policy and would put in 
its place a policy of genuine partnership and cooperation -- not 
just in words but in action, for the sake of stability and 
security. 
  So we insist on an unconditional observation of the 
procedures approved by the UN Security Council for bringing 
aircraft into action in Bosnia, which stipulate consultations 
with the UN Secretary General and members of the Security 
Council. 
  We still expect exhaustive reports from the UN Secretariat 
General about what happened in the Gorazde region. The 
appropriate instructions have been given to our representative 
at the United Nations. 
  According to information confirmed by the UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] leadership, the events in Gorazde began with 
provocative activities on the part of Muslim armed formations, 
which met with an incommensurate response from the Bosnian 
Serbs. The Muslim provocations are continuing even now. The 
UNPROFOR headquarters in Sarajevo confirms that on 11 April the 
Muslims attacked the Serb-held village of Lapsiza north of Pale, 
and on 12 April they mortared Serb positions around Gorazde. 
  Bellicose pronouncements by the Bosnian Serbs about their 
intention to shoot down all aircraft overflying their positions 
are also a cause for concern. 
  We again appeal to all parties to refrain from any 
provocative activities, as the UN Security Council has demanded 
at Russia's initiative. At the same time all countries 
committed to a settlement of the crisis and the world community 
as a whole must get the Bosnian parties to behave in precisely 
this way and to return to the negotiating table in order to 
achieve a durable and comprehensive cease-fire. Opportunities 
for this do still exist. 
  For its part Russia is doing its utmost to promote the 
earliest possible settlement.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and 
others] 
  [Text] In the opinion of Russia the NATO air strikes 
against the positions of Bosnian Serbs in Gorazde were 
unjustified. The statement was made on Wednesday in an 
exclusive interview with Interfax by Deputy Foreign Minister 
Sergey Lavrov who is the senior official at the ministry now 
that Andrey Kozyrev is in Spain accompanying President Yeltsin. 
  Lavrov said that in the military sense the NATO air strikes 
did not give anything, and in the political sense they sharply 
worsened the situation. Besides, it should be found out whether 
the NATO action caused human losses. 
  Lavrov spoke of the unproductiveness of regarding Russia as 
an inferior partner of NATO. "This was proved by the situation 
in Sarajevo and now though somewhat differently by Gorazde", he 
said. 
  According to the deputy minister, the situation must be 
saved 
after the NATO air attacks. This can be done only through 
concerted efforts, he said. 
  Lavrov stressed that last Monday the UN Security Council 
held 
a session called for by Russia to discuss the situation. "The 
first report of the Security Council secretariat about the 
developments in Gorazde was submitted. It was clearly 
fragmentary and incomplete. We were not satisfied with it and we 
expect exhaustive information", the diplomat said. 
  According to him, the Security Council met again on Tuesday. 
"At the initiative of Russia it adopted a call to Bosnian 
Muslims to stop the shelling. Russia again demanded information 
from the secretariat about the way the procedure required by 
Security Council resolutions was applied and what concrete 
targets were attacked", Lavrov said. Besides, Russia suggested 
that the Security Council take steps to implement the April 6 
declaration concerning a safe zone in Gorazde which implies the 
demilitarization of the area, the sending of a UN force, the 
withdrawal of Serbian artillery and the disarmament of Muslim 
armed groups. 
  He recalled that last June the Security Council passed a 
number of resolutions permitting the use of force in 
ex-Yugoslavia to prevent attacks on peace-keepers and the UN 
personnel and violations of the no-flight zone over 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. In such cases the UN secretary general can 
request interested countries and regional organizations to 
support the UN force and resist the violations. The procedure of 
using force proposed by the secretary general in his report on 
July 14, 1993 was approved. Lavrov stressed that under the 
resolution the secretary general can made a decision on the use 
of force after consulting Security Council members. The report 
was discussed by the Security Council and approved in the first 
clause of resolution No. 844. 
  According to Lavrov, the procedure providing for compulsory 
consultations with Security Council members was the main 
condition of Russia's approval of the resolution. "The 
resolution must be observed. This equally applies to countries 
that are targets of tough sanctions and Security Council 
members, the secretary general, the secretariat. We are 
bringing the idea home to our partners in the Security Council 
and the secretary general", the diplomat said. 
  The deputy minister said that a high-ranking official from 
the Russian mission in Geneva Valeriy Loshchinin met there with 
Butrus- Ghali and "told him everything". "We did not get 
exhaustive answers to our concerns", he said. 
  Asked whether Russia is going to submit the draft of a more 
binding Security Council resolution Lavrov said that the whole 
gamut of sentiments at the council should be taken into account. 
Many Security Council members, in particular non-aligned 
countries, view the Serbs as the only aggressors and constantly 
call for one-sided actions against them. Lately only Russia 
with the feeble support of two or three countries has been 
resisting resolutions that would declare a Security Council 
ultimatum to Serbs throughout Bosnia, lift the Security Council 
embargo on arms supplies to the Muslims and expel Serbs from all 
international organizations. 
  According to Lavrov, Russia is not turning a blind eye on 
the 
fact that before the air attacks the Serbs violated Security 
Council resolutions. "According to some reports, 30 people were 
killed and 100 wounded in the Serbian shelling. This must be 
double-checked. We demand that the Serbs stop such actions. But 
they should not be attacked alone. It is clear that the current 
situation around Gorazde was provoked by the Muslims while the 
Serbs reacted inadequately. If the world community chooses one 
side as the scapegoat, this will lead to what President Yeltsin 
has described as an eternal war", Lavrov said. 
  Asked whether Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev would go to 
ex- 
Yugoslavia -- a fact not ruled out by President Yeltsin in his 
speech in Madrid -- Lavrov said that Moscow would want to get 
detailed reports from the Russian presidential envoy in the 
conflict zone Vitaliy Churkin first. "Churkin is engaged in 
virtually round- the-clock negotiations with the conflicting 
sides and the United Nations. Unfortunately, it is not always 
possible to be in touch with him as he constantly moves from one 
place to another", the diplomat said. 
  Moscow is alarmed by the fact that the support of many 
Western leaders for the use of force in Gorazde might lead to 
reliance on force in Bosnian and international affairs in 
general. The feeling is expressed in a statement of a Russian 
Foreign Ministry spokesman circulated in Moscow on Wednesday. 
  He said the NATO headquarters is reportedly discussing new 
ultimatums to the Serbs in circumvention of the United Nations. 
"This road is unacceptable for us, instead we pursue a policy of 
true partnership and practical cooperation for the sake of 
stability and security", the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.

  [Text] Brussels April 13 (TASS) -- A NATO official said on 
Wednesday that the North Atlantic Alliance is not making any 
plans for Bosnia behind Moscow's back. 
  He told ITAR-TASS that NATO leaders held a meeting today and 
expressed satisfaction with the results of air raids on Sunday 
[10 April] and Monday which were carried out in accordance with 
U.N. Security Council Resolution 836. 
  He said NATO leaders did not discuss Moscow's reaction to 
air 
raids or prospects for Russia's accession to the Partnership for 
Peace programme. They reiterated NATO's readiness to provide 
aviation support if U.N. forces come under attack in Bosnia 
again. 
  The official did not rule out the possibility that the date 
of signing the Partnership for Peace agreement by Russia set for 
April 21 may be changed because there has been no official 
confirmation from Russia yet. He expressed that hope that it 
will happen as soon as possible. 
  The official noted that NATO acted as an executor of the 
U.N. 
will and all complaints and protests should be directed to the 
United Nations which bears all responsibility for the action. 
He confirmed NATO's intention to act in close contact with 
Russia in order to restore peace in the former Yugoslavia, 
adding that the Partnership for Peace programme could provide a 
good foundation for such cooperation.

  [Text] The commander-in-chief of Russia's Air Force said 
NATO's air strikes in the Gorazde area had aggravated the 
situation in Bosnia. 
  General Petr Deinekin told Interfax on Wednesday that 
Russian 
military experts had predicted that air attacks in Bosnia would 
produce no positive results, the warring sides there not being 
properly separated. 
  He cited data according to which the U.S. aircraft, F-16's 
in 
the first raid and F/A-18's in the second, had used 300-kg bombs 
with laser homing heads, able to hit human targets at a distance 
of up to 30 meters. 
  Citing information obtained by the Russian Air Force high 
command, Deinekin said that on April 10 the American planes were 
planning to raid armored units, but, seeing none, bombed an 
artillery command post instead. He said the second strike, made 
on April 11, was a failure since only one of the three dropped 
bombs exploded. 
  Commenting on the Bosnian Serb command's statement that NATO 
aircraft making new raids would be downed, the general said the 
Serb forces positioned in the Gorazde area had no air defenses 
or fighter planes. He said the Americans had used an AWACS 
control system during the raids.

  [Text] Moscow April 13 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin said that economic sanctions against Serbia 
and Montenegro would not be lifted until peace is not ensured in 
Bosnia. [sentence as received] 
  "Lifting of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia should be 
preceeded by a ceasefire from all the conflicting sides (in 
Bosnia)," he told TASS on Wednesday. 
  "Russia stood and stands on one position -- all settlement 
problems in Bosnia can be solved only at the negotiating table. 
Nothing can be done by military force," he said and added that 
Russia does not accept "power methods." 
  The prime minister stressed that in general Russia stands 
for 
the lifting of sanctions againt Yugoslavia. "I do not 
understand why peoples have to suffer, and not those forces 
which profit from the conflict." 
  However, he added that for the time being it is impossible 
to 
lift the sanctions completely. "Foreign economic relations will 
be impeded by combat activities," according to the prime 
minister. 
  The situation in former Yugoslavia will most evidently be 
discussed at the CIS summit in Moscow on Friday. "The example 
of former Yugoslavia makes us see what a split of the country 
can result in. The example shows what we can get on the 
territory of the former USSR," Chernomyrdin stressed.

  [Text] Russia's position has always been and will continue 
to be the following: the armed conflict in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina can be resolved "not by force, but only at the 
political negotiation table," Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin said after talks with the Tajik government 
delegation on Wednesday. 
  The premier believes that an unlimited amount of time can be 
spent finding out who of the opposing sides "is to blame or not 
to blame" in the escalation of the conflict in the Balkans," and 
whether attacks of American planes on positions of the Bosnian 
Serbs in the region of Gorazde have been coordinated or not. 
But it is absolutely clear that in the world "there are forces 
who need all this and whose ambitions are the reason why this 
all happens." 
  Chernomyrdin noted that Russia's position remains the same: 
"an immediate end of bloodshed without the use of force." 
Otherwise, he thinks, sanctions against Yugoslavia "will not be 
lifted," although "the people who are reaping all these fruits 
of political intrigues have nothing to do with this." 
  The premier is convinced that the sanctions imposed by the 
UN 
will not be lifted "not because Russia wants or does not want 
this," but because the countries neighboring to Yugoslavia "will 
not let cargoes of any of the warring sides through their 
territories in order not to fan the Balkan fire, and they will 
be right to do so."

  [Text] Moscow April 13 TASS -- The Russia's Choice bloc 
issued a statement on Wednesday, following NATO air raids on 
Bosnian Serb positions near the town of Gorazde. 
  "The process of peaceful settlement on the long-suffering 
land of Bosnia-Herzegovina is going through another period of 
hardships. Bloody events in the U.N.-proclaimed `safe area of 
Gorazde' cause deep sorrow and concern. It is necessary to act 
decisively in order to put an end to deaths and sufferings of 
innocent people, to violence, terror and any provocations, no 
matter who inspires them," the statement said. 
  It stressed that the "safety of Gorazde is provided for by 
respective resolutions of the U.N. Security Council and they 
must be unswervingly fulfilled." The statement described as 
alarming the fact that the decision on bombing "was adopted 
without proper consultations corresponding to the seriousness of 
the moment with the leadership of the Russian Federation." 
  "Russia as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council 
cannot stay away from such responsible decisions and should not 
associate itself with coercive actions for which it did not give 
its consent," the document said. 
  In a separate statement the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia (LDPR) denounced the air strikes in much stronger terms. 
"NATO bombs kill orthodox brethren and sisters," it said. The 
party also lashed out at U.N. Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, saying he has "forgotten the goals of his 
organisation and its charter." "Especially outrageous is that 
air raids are called a `U.N. Peace-keeping operation," the 
statement said.

  [Text] The air strikes on Serbian positions demonstrated 
how little American diplomacy respects Russia. The statement 
was made at a Wednesday news conference in Moscow by the leader 
of the opposition Russian National Assembly Aleksandr Sterligov. 
  "The USA has actually begun building a new world order 
through the use of force and we regard this as a dangerous step 
that might pave the way to a war against the Slavic world", 
Sterligov said. 
  According to him, in this situation the Serbs will not be 
left alone, because steps would be made to organize the sending 
of volunteers to Serbia. He added that if the war in Serbia was 
not stopped, it would spread to Russia. 
  Sterligov spoke against the coming joint Russian-American 
military exercises in the Urals this summer. He said the 
purpose of the exercises is to encourage separatists to split 
Russia as well as to spy on the capability of the remnants of 
the Russian army to guarantee the security of the country. 
  "Americans want to consolidate their hold on our territory, 
set up bases and begin the creeping occupation of Russia", 
Sterligov said. 
  He stressed that the Russian National Assembly is ready to 
form public committees of resistance to the appearance of 
Western troops in Russia. "In this respect we have found full 
understanding with Cossack organizations and groups of Afghan 
war veterans", Sterligov announced. 
  He said his organization together with Cossacks and Afghan 
veteranss would launch a campaign of resistance to the 
exercises, if the Federal Assembly does not cancel them.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr -- The stabilization of the 
situation around Gorazde is perhaps the most important thing 
that was achieved during the two days of talks in Sarajevo, 
Vitaliy Churkin, special representative of the Russian 
president, said in an interview to the ITAR-TASS correspondent 
after his return to Belgrade. 
  There have been no intensive combat actions in the Gorazde 
region for over 24 hours now, he continued. True, the Muslims 
did make two attempts to provoke the Serbian side into opening 
fire but the UN forces' observers cut short these attempts. 
  I now have assurances from Radovan Karadzic that the Serbian 
forces do not intend to make any further attacks or to open fire 
on Gorazde, of course, on condition that the Muslim side does 
not provoke them. 
  After my talks in Pale and Sarajevo I have come away with 
the 
conviction that the Serbian side does not intend to throw down a 
challenge to the international community. Its stance makes it 
possible to move the negotiating process forward, although 
resolute steps are needed on its part to move forward toward 
peace in Bosnia, and, consequently, toward the removal of the 
sanctions against Yugoslavia, that is how the Russian deputy 
foreign minister assessed the results of his meetings in 
Sarajevo with the leadership of the Bosnian sides, the command 
of the UN forces, Charles Redman, the special representative of 
the U.S. President, David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the 
cochairmen of the Geneva peace conference, and also his latest 
conversation with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. 
  I handed over to Milosevic and Karadzic our proposals that 
would facilitate the establishment of peace in Bosnia and 
progress on the question of sanctions; we will be awaiting their 
reply to them. 
  V. Churkin refuted reports that representatives of the UN 
forces were arrested and detained by the Bosnian Serbs. It is 
just a matter of restricting their movements, which was a 
reaction to the air strikes by the NATO air forces, he said. 
Indeed, only vehicles of the Russian battalion of "blue 
helmets" are freely allowed through the Serbian part of Sarajevo. 
  This reaction was also expressed in the refusal by the 
Serbian side to hold talks with the command of the UN forces. 
I, however, told the people I was talking to that to ignore the 
United Nations was not in their interests. But I have no 
grounds to insist that they change their stance after everything 
that has happened. 
  The Russian diplomat said that he will remain in Belgrade 
for 
now.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the </F>
Russian president, by Sergey Sidorov, under "Russia's Interests" 
rubric; date and place not given: "Vitaliy Churkin: We Need a 
Stable Europe"] 
  [Text] [Sidorov] Russia has viewed its interests in the 
Balkans differently at different times. For example, in the 
days of the Ottoman empire it advocated the protection of the 
Christian peoples, who needed support in their national 
liberation struggle. Later, during World War I, the Russian 
emperor accomplished a special Christian exploit by standing up 
for fraternal Serbia -- in many ways a suicidal step. In World 
War II Yugoslavia was our ally. But in the cold war era our 
interests were better served by a neutral Yugoslavia, which made 
it easier to organize strategic defense in the southwest sector. 
As the Russian president's special envoy who deals directly 
with the questions of Yugoslavia, how would you express Russia's 
present-day interest in the Balkans? 
  [Churkin] In the first place it seems to me that Russia, as 
a great European power, has an interest in a stable Europe. But 
there cannot be a stable, peaceful Europe without stability in 
the Balkans. That is axiomatic and it stems from the historical 
experience which you spoke about. In addition, the war in 
former Yugoslavia is crippling the whole region because economic 
and cultural ties are breaking down and normal political 
cooperation has stopped. The fact is that because of the 
traditional ties that we have with the Serbs and with other 
peoples of this region, Russia can play a role in a settlement. 
Furthermore, the world has finally come to realize recently 
that without Russia there can be no settlement in the Balkans at 
all. Here, it seems to me, we have traveled a complex path in 
the development of our diplomatic line: Moscow has moved from 
what was to some extent an anti-Serb position to a more complex 
maneuver in which it began to use its channels of communication 
with the Serbs so as to encourage their constructive approaches 
to a political settlement.... 
  We also have economic interests and opportunities. We now 
have quite good economic ties with Croatia. Just look at how 
many different firms from the former Yugoslavia there are in 
Moscow. Croatian, Bosnian, and Serbian firms -- despite all the 
sanctions-related difficulties those firms are still in Russia. 
So I think that our interest is manifold -- political, 
economic, and psychological. 
  [Sidorov] Henry Kissinger, the former U.S. secretary of 
state, was once asked the secret of his diplomatic skill. He 
said it was that he always told the truth. This sounds 
paradoxical -- diplomats usually employ a lot of flowery 
language for just one purpose -- to hide what they are really 
thinking. Tell us the truth, how does the West understand the 
thesis that the settlement in the Balkans is impossible without 
Russia, and how do you understand it? 
  [Churkin] You have asked quite a complex question. It is 
hard for me to say how the West views this. I proceed from the 
premise that the Americans, for example, have stated to us 
authoritatively at the very highest level that they do not see 
the possibility of settling this conflict without Russia. 
Furthermore, these declarations have been backed up by 
practical actions. The result of those actions is that we are 
in constant contact with the U.S. representative, Redman, 
virtually every day. We discuss the strategy and tactics of 
future actions. When in the past couple of weeks we put forward 
the initiative of holding meetings with the Krajina Serbs and 
the Croatians to conclude a cease-fire agreement, which took 
place in our embassy in Zagreb 30 March, the Americans were 
involved in this. And they did their part of the work 
honorably. Even though this was a purely Russian initiative. 
So, based on the principle of truthfulness, I would put the 
question plainly in these terms: Russia must take a most active 
part in the Yugoslav settlement. Otherwise it will not be 
possible to bring the sides together and reach the agreement 
everyone needs. 
  [Sidorov] It is obvious that without the solution of the 
Serbian national question there will be no real settlement and 
peace in the Balkans. 
  [Churkin] I entirely agree with you, of course. 
  [Sidorov] The West, in my view, has its own concept of the 
settlement. In a certain sense the United States openly 
supported the historic striving of the Croats and Muslims for 
self-determination. Is Russia ready to support the Serbs living 
outside Serbia and Montenegro in their legitimate striving for 
self-determination? 
  [Churkin] First I would like to draw attention to the 
following fact. The United States put forward the concept of a 
Croatian-Muslim federation and a confederation between it and 
Croatia based on the sovereign rights of the Croatians and 
Muslims. But this does not mean the creation of an ethnically 
pure Croatian or Muslim state. On the contrary, this concept is 
based on a mix of Croatians and Muslims within the framework of 
a federation inside a single state. Plus a definite linkup 
[pristegivaniye] through a confederation with Croatia. What are 
we ready to do and what have we already achieved in the light of 
these proposals from the Americans? We have achieved 
recognition of the fact that the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
cannot be resolved unless it is taken into account that in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina there are three peoples capable of forming a 
state [gosudarstvoobrazuyushchiy narod], each of which, 
including the Serbs, has its own sovereign rights and can make 
its own sovereign decisions. There is also the understanding 
that the solution of the problems of the regions of Croatia 
which the United Nations is protecting and the Serbs inhabit is 
also impossible without full regard for their rights. 
  [Sidorov] It is very difficult to try to understand what is 
happening outside the historical context or if you do not know 
how the conflict began. After all, it has long been known that 
it was not the Serbs who began the "ethnic cleansing" itself. 
  [Churkin] It is curious that each side has a completely 
opposing view on absolutely all questions, including history. 
But there is something that I would like to stress now. The 
world community, I am sure, will never accept that national 
problems be resolved by the forcible expulsion of the 
representatives of other nationalities. Unfortunately, all the 
peoples of the former Yugoslavia embroiled in the conflict did 
not understand sufficiently that it is necessary to take into 
account the national interests of other peoples. That is what 
ultimately led to the conflict. 
  [Sidorov] There are several internal causes of the conflict. 
But the Balkans have always been a sphere of interests of the 
great powers. Stability emerged there when they found a balance 
of those interests. In my opinion, the Serbs, Croats, and 
Muslims would have reached agreement long ago if there had not 
been outside interference. Let us take the policy of united 
Germany. Its interest was shown, among other things, in the 
fact that former FRG Foreign Minister H.-D. Genscher did his 
utmost to secure the recognition of Croatia from the members of 
the EC. Even though nine Community members opposed the 
premature recognition of Croatia, where hostilities were in 
progress. This was how "international recognition" of the 
forcible breakup of Yugoslavia began. Russia sided with the EC 
at that time. You surely were right when you said that this was 
more an anti-Serb position in Russian policy, which is generally 
speaking uncharacteristic of our relations with that people. 
After all, this was the destruction of the state in which the 
Serbian question and indeed other questions had been 
historically resolved. It was destroyed in the name of 
supporting the self-determination of the national republics. 
  [Churkin] No, I did not say that with regard to this 
specific question. What I said generally was that we were 
pursuing a more subtle policy. But let us examine this issue. 
It is a very important question. I hold the completely 
opposite viewpoint. It is that no matter how hard we -- the 
intermediaries, peacemakers, call it what you will -- try, until 
the sides themselves agree, until they decide that the time has 
come to make peace and reach agreement, there will be no peace. 
And no one can help them there. 
  Now about Genscher and Germany's role. My view of matters is 
this. I would not disagree if you said to me that Germany 
wanted to see Croatia and Slovenia as independent states. They 
have their own historic ties. But it would be an exaggeration 
to say that Germany's position and the sentiments there were the 
prime cause of the breakup of Yugoslavia. The decision on 
recognition, even it was a mistake, as events subsequently 
showed, was motivated by the desire to prevent the spread of 
war. But what happened was the complete opposite, as can be 
seen particularly clearly in the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It 
seems to me that one lesson for the international community must 
be that it should have shown a certain modesty. There are 
international conflicts which cannot be prevented or settled 
merely by the authority of the international community. It is 
necessary to begin by understanding the logic of what is going 
on and not to immediately try to impose some kind of decisions. 
  [Sidorov] But yet the international community, as you call 
it in general terms, even though it consists of specific states 
with specific interests, and despite the warnings of many 
politicians, is recognizing Croatia, followed by 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. And then, to the roar of the guns, it 
seemed to say as an aside: This was a misunderstanding. It 
seems strange to me that Western diplomats could make so many 
mistakes. Is there not some other factor in evidence here? 
Perhaps the geopolitical cataclysms of the period of the 
disintegration of the USSR encouraged the temptation to 
"capture" spheres of influence in the Balkans, too? 
  [Churkin] Well, clearly this was influential. Admittedly, I 
do not know whether we should seek some evil design here. This 
is simply how things coincided. As the experts attest, people 
began talking about the danger of the disintegration of 
Yugoslavia back in 1980. In other words, it all began earlier 
over there. Probably if at that time we had not been so absorbed 
with our own internal problems we could have played a more 
energetic role in the international arena. And perhaps if we 
had acted jointly with others we could have alleviated or even 
prevented some things. But this is all hypothetical and, as we 
know, the hypothetical does not exist in history. 
  [Sidorov] Do you never get the impression that the war in 
Bosnia has nevertheless served someone's external interests? A 
unique, controllable crisis has arisen against the background of 
which various peace plans have appeared only to disappear. 
While essentially what we have is the division of Bosnia in two 
-- between the Serbs and the Croats. 
  [Churkin] I do think so. I can say this because I have 
conversed on this topic with Muslims, with Izetbegovic and 
Silajdzic. There are politicians who have not deemed feasible 
or correct any solution which would lead to the creation of a 
Muslim state, albeit a small one, in Bosnia. This concerns even 
plans for a union out of the three republics. Even here they 
have seen the specter of the emergence of a Muslim state, 
fearing that the union would subsequently collapse while the 
state remained. On the other hand, there are very many 
questions which are intertwined here. But it is difficult for me 
to imagine a rational, cool decision by the world community that 
it is necessary to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina in two, as this 
creates an extremely dangerous precedent of national demarcation 
as a result of war. As far as the most promising ways of 
securing a political solution in Bosnia and Herzegovina are 
concerned, however, it seems to me that what we could have is 
the creation of a union in Bosnia and Herzegovina consisting of 
two parts -- a Muslim-Croat federation and a Serb republic, or 
that part could be called something else. With the capital in 
Sarajevo. Here each part of the union will possess pretty 
extensive rights, but the territorial integrity of the state 
will nevertheless be preserved. 
  [Sidorov] I would like to return to what we started with -- 
Russia's role in the Yugoslav settlement. As I see it, former 
Yugoslavia was a bipolar country. At the one pole you had 
Slovenia and Croatia, which gravitated toward the West, and at 
the other Serbia and Montenegro, traditional representatives of 
Eastern Christian culture. Such a state could exist as a 
single, stable formation only when you had a geopolitical 
balance between East and West. When people began talking about 
the need for Russia to be more active in the Balkans, I thought 
perhaps the West had realized that the world needs a distinctive 
role by Moscow which would restore some kind of balance in 
Europe. But, you know, you can only get a balance when Russia 
speaks in its own voice. Let the Americans play the banjo, 
while the Russians play the balalaika. It's a fine instrument, 
after all. 
  [Churkin] I simply have to agree with what you have said. 
But here a host of questions can harbor a host of subtexts. I 
will not enter into interpretation, because those who loudly 
demand, say, the restoration of the Warsaw Pact or the Soviet 
Union sometimes start exploiting the logic of discussion. That 
is history. What happened happened because of certain 
historical causes. This has undoubtedly had negative 
consequences. And both we ourselves and to some extent 
Yugoslavia too have suffered from this. But we are returning to 
major international affairs undoubtedly because in a certain 
sense the period of maturation of Russian foreign policy is 
complete. It has been very difficult for us, because it would 
be fundamentally wrong to suppose that Russia is the same as the 
former Soviet Union, only smaller. A new geopolitical 
situation, a very complex, multidirectional play of forces had 
arisen. And time was needed to grasp our position in the world, 
to sense our potential, to curb the chaotic processes under way 
on our borders, and to get a precise idea of the approaches of 
our partners -- not only Western partners but our Eastern 
partners too -- toward the new Russia. And then to adopt 
clearer stances in affairs which go beyond the crises happening 
literally on Russia's borders.

<F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, political scientist and </F>
State Duma deputy, under the "Three Authors" rubric: "Echo of 
Bosnian Bombings"] 
  [Text] The NATO rocket strikes at Serb positions in Bosnia 
provoke a number of perplexing questions. Who made the decision 
on the air strike, by whom and how was it sanctioned? If this 
had been demanded by British General Rose, commander of the UN 
forces, why was it approved over the phone (!) by UN secretary 
general envoy Yasushi Akashi, a Japanese, who was in... Paris? 
Was the sanction not received from Butrus-Ghali himself? Why 
such a hurry at all in making so responsible a decision with 
such dangerous possible consequences? 
  Just a few days ago, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry; 
General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chief of 
Staff; and indeed, Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
admitted: Air strikes serve no purpose because they may disrupt 
talks on a general peaceful settlement in Bosnia. Could that 
have been precisely someone's purpose? 
  True, by this "retribution strike" President Clinton seems 
to 
have refuted the accusations of being indecisive and 
inefficient, which he has been increasingly subjected to from 
his critics in the United States. Clinton thereby has avenged, 
as it were, the failure of the American operation in Somalia. 
Now he states: "We have risen to the occasion." A rather 
doubtful statement. 
  Amazingly, Moscow had not been even informed in advance 
about 
the planned bombing. What can account for such an attitude of 
Clinton to President Yeltsin, who once already opened to the 
Americans the way out of the impasse by his well-known peace 
initiative on Sarajevo, precluding their involvement in the 
Balkan war? Or is it that all means of demonstrating American 
leadership are good, and why think of the consequences? 
  And these consequences are rather serious. The American 
bombing hit at Yeltsin's trump card -- cooperation with the 
West, the United States. How would the U.S. President's failure 
to honor the Russian-American understanding on mutual 
consultations in similar situations be interpreted? It is 
obvious that President Clinton is rather unceremoniously edging 
Russia out of solving the Balkan problems that are so painful 
for us. To a Russian, all this recalls Nozdrev [Gogol's 
character in "Dead Souls"] who, pointing at his own and his 
neighbor's field, said: "This is mine" and added: "Everything 
behind the woods (read: across the ocean) is also all mine." 
  Washington's moves undoubtedly compromise Russia's 
cooperation with the West and add grist for the 
national-radicals opposed to Yeltsin. One can imagine the zeal 
with which Mr. Zhirinovskiy will now descend upon American and, 
for that matter, Russian foreign policy: American rockets for 
him are a godsend! And what will Russian representatives feel 
when they sign the "Partnership for Peace" with NATO to the echo 
of the bombings? Or maybe the events are interlinked so as to 
derail the signing, to push Russia aside? 
  The disregard for the agreed on consultations with Security 
Council permanent members in advance of UN military operations 
arouses a sense of protest. As indeed does the statement on the 
NATO bombings coming "automatically" on instructions from UN 
commanders in Bosnia, hence once again bypassing the Security 
Council. Can one actually identify the United Nations with the 
North Atlantic Treaty Alliance? 
  The bombings may be expected to weaken sharply the positions 
of such relatively moderate Serb politicians as Milosevic and 
Karadzic. Until recently, they managed somehow to contain the 
"implacable" in their ranks, for instance General Mladic, the 
Bosnian Serbs commander. Now they will have to radicalize their 
stance. 
  Apropos Mladic. A year or so ago, meeting him in Pale, I 
tried to persuade him to stop shelling the beleaguered towns. 
"Is there any military reason for such shellings?" "No," he 
replied without batting an eye. "Why then you do it? Can't you 
see you are sapping your own prestige in the world?" "We'll 
think." High time for the Serb radicals also to reach the 
conclusion that continued bloodshed in Bosnia is against the 
genuine interests of the Serbs themselves. 
  Now it is extremely sad that civilians once again suffer 
from 
the bombings. Such is the result of American military 
operations be it in Bosnia, Panama, or Somalia: They are 
ostensibly undertaken to protect people but as a result it is 
innocent civilians who die, and often on a greater scale than 
before the interference. 
  One may hope that in the critical situation that has taken 
shape, the Russian state will demonstrate its dignity and 
intention to protect its interests, and Russian diplomacy will 
demonstrate its skill in gluing together the broken pots. To 
all appearances, gluing them together now would be much harder.

<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "NATO Resolve and Serb Stubbornness </F>
Put Russian Diplomacy in Difficult Position"] 
  [Text] Despite Moscow's resolute objections, NATO aircraft 
have followed up their first strike against Bosnian Serb 
positions in the Gorazde area with another. In an interview 
with news agencies NATO spokesmen did not rule out the 
possibility of new bombing raids -- in the event of the Serbs 
failing to stop their shelling of the besieged Muslim enclave. 
  For their part, the Bosnian Serb leaders have also taken a 
hard-line stance. Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the 
self-proclaimed Serb Republic parliament, threatened retaliatory 
"political and military measures," hinting that the Serbs would 
continue their offensive against Gorazde. 
  Russian diplomacy finds itself in an unpleasant position. 
Events are taking a most undesirable turn for Moscow. For as 
long as stress was laid on peace talks, Russia successfully 
played the role of intermediary in the Bosnian settlement, 
winning one diplomatic victory after another. But as soon as 
hostilities commenced between the Serbs and NATO, the world has 
seen for itself that the Kremlin's ability to influence the 
development of the situation is very limited. 
  The Russian protests have had no impact. "Our reaction was 
entirely appropriate for the circumstances," U.S. President Bill 
Clinton said in a phone call to Boris Yeltsin. New Zealand's 
Colin Keating, who is chairing the UN Security Council this 
month, rejected a Russian proposal to urgently convene the 
Council. NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, responding to 
criticism from [Russian Federation Foreign Minister] Andrey 
Kozyrev, said that the preliminary consultations with Moscow on 
which the Russian minister had insisted would have taken too 
much time and would not have allowed the main task -- of 
protecting the UN personnel threatened by the Serb guns -- to 
have been resolved. Our Paris correspondent Yuriy Kovalenko 
reports that Woerner warned the Serbs against any retaliatory 
strikes, noting that NATO has so far used just two aircraft to 
bomb the Serb positions, but that more major operations could be 
carried out if necessary. 
  If this happens, relations between Russia and the West will 
be put to a new test. But, if things reach serious crisis 
point, President Yeltsin attaches too great an importance to 
ties with the United States and West Europe to put them at risk 
over the inflexibility of the Bosnian Serbs. 
  All the more so as the Serbs' actions over the past few days 
have caused poorly concealed irritation in Moscow. Despite all 
the Kremlin's efforts to persuade the Serbs to compromise and to 
make them at least end the shelling of Gorazde, they preferred 
to go on playing with fire. The NATO strikes were therefore 
inevitable, and Russian mediation was useless. This was 
something that was stated with some bitterness in a TV interview 
by Yeltsin's special representative Vitaliy Churkin, pinning on 
the Serbs a considerable amount of the responsibility for the 
deterioration in the situation. 
  Russian diplomats were also very disappointed at the 
behavior 
of Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the "Serb Republic." Meeting 
with Churkin, he assured him that he had ordered an end to the 
bombardment of the Muslim enclave. Despite this, the shelling 
continues, which gives NATO an excuse for a new strike -- 
entirely in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 836, 
which declared Gorazde a "safe haven." 
  This resolution, passed 4 June 1993, was adopted unanimously 
by the Security Council members (including Russia and China). 
This removes most of the arguments from the Russian diplomats 
who are contesting NATO's action. 
  Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Foreign Ministry's 
Information and Press Department, told IZVESTIYA that, for 
Russia, protecting the "blue helmets" is no idle question, since 
there are Russian peacekeeping forces in Bosnia too. But, as he 
put it, Moscow will not put up with the role of a junior partner 
who is informed only when people want to hear a "yes." Russia 
insists on the complete cessation of hostilities in the Gorazde 
area, including air strikes. Kozyrev has set out this position 
in a phone call with the U.S. secretary of state.

<F P=106> [Maksim Chikin report: "Ending on Health. On Last Day of </F>
Spanish Visit Boris Nikolayevich Spoke of Bosnia, Civic 
Consensus, and His Own Health"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Apart from the seven documents signed by 
the Russian leadership in Spain, the leadership was also 
enriched with theoretical knowledge about the achievement of 
civic peace in the country. The fact is that in October 1977, 
two years after Franco's death, the so-called "Moncloa Pact" -- 
an agreement reminiscent of the "Agreement on Civic Peace" that 
is in preparation in Russia -- was signed in Spain. In the 
document all Spain's political parties, trade unions, 
entrepreneurs, and, naturally, its government agreed that it was 
time to build democracy peacefully in the country. The 101-page 
document was closely studied by the Russian president. Boris 
Yeltsin spent several hours with Spanish Premier Gonzalez to 
learn all the details of this consensus. 
  As for the practical application of foreign experience, the 
Russian president made the following comment at a press 
conference: "We intend to sign the document 28 April and so far 
we are not backtracking from that. It is supported by the 
leadership of the State Duma and the Federation Council, the 
government, most parties and social movements, and so forth. I 
think that most will sign on the 28th, and the document will 
later be open for signing by those who want to do so." 
  It so happened that the state visit to Spain was held in the 
context of Bosnia. On Tuesday Boris Yeltsin reiterated that the 
"decision to carry out bombing raids was irresponsible, and full 
responsibility for the possible consequences will lie with those 
who made this decision." From Russia's standpoint, the outcome 
of the conflict should be settled solely by negotiations. This 
is what Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, who is 
currently in the former Yugoslavia, is trying to achieve. The 
Russian president stated that, if necessary, he is prepared to 
urgently send Foreign Minister Kozyrev there too. 
  The third and final day of the visit was spent in Barcelona 
and was full of different official events. Yeltsin met with 
Spanish doctors, whom he again thanked for their brilliant 
operation in 1990 after his aircraft's unsuccessful landing in 
Barcelona. In general the problem of the Russian president's 
health was not sidestepped. The newspapers have been 
enthusiastically picking up on this topic. B. Yeltsin said 
literally the following on the subject: 
  "I would like everyone my age to have the same health as I 
have. Can someone who always plays a really hard game of tennis 
for 90 minutes (and with partners who are masters and 
meritorious masters of sport), someone who swims in the Black 
Sea in March when the water temperature is four degrees, have 
poor health? Someone who works 16-18 hours a day with hardly 
any days off.... That's something to be envied. 
  "The other day I told my doctors -- let's do an all-day 
checkup this year, with any journalist present who wants to be. 
In any laboratory...they can do blood tests...do anything they 
want, you understand, to see how strong I am, how.... And we

<F P=106> [Vladimir Vernikov and Vasiliy Kononenko report: "Boris </F>
Yeltsin Makes Tempting Proposal to Madrid Businessmen. Spanish 
Scent Big Money"] 
  [Text] Madrid-Barcelona -- The Bosnia crisis could not 
spoil the atmosphere of the Russian-Spanish dialogue in Madrid. 
B. Yeltsin and Premier F. Gonzalez called it very successful 
and interesting. 
  Boris Yeltsin advised that so far Russia and Spain have been 
trading very badly -- Spain accounts for just 2 percent of 
Russia's foreign trade turnover. In a frank and categorical way 
he attempted to win over around 200 top Spanish businessmen with 
whom he held a business lunch at the Ritz Hotel. The president 
announced that the government is currently drawing up new 
foreign economic legislation which will envisage, in particular, 
the granting of most-favored status to foreign investors and the 
creation of conditions for delivering goods to the Russian 
market similar to those which exist for Russian producers. 
Admittedly, despite the well-known pressure on him in Russia, 
he did not reject the use of import tariffs as an instrument for 
regulating foreign trade. 
  The businessmen listened with interest to the president's 
promise to provide guarantees for investors against any 
political surprises. Certain specific proposals were also 
voiced -- to modernize several oil refineries and even to get 
involved in opening up oil fields in Udmurtia and Krasnoyarsk 
Kray. The Spanish scented big money in these proposals. 
  They have all been beaten to the punch by Pedro Balvye [name 
as transliterated], president of the Campofrio meat processing 
concern. Having taken a chance on investing in Russia several 
years ago, this concern is now not only operating successfully 
in Moscow but is even building another major plant. Visiting a 
Campofrio enterprise near Madrid, Boris Yeltsin was clearly 
surprised in one shop to see large hams going round on a 
mechanical carousel. Many Russian tourists even think that 
these popular smoked hams, to be found in every Spanish bar and 
restaurant looking as natural as if they had been painted by 
Rubens, are plaster casts. The journalists were waiting for the 
tasting, and were speculating on which wine the president would 
choose to accompany the ham. But they were disappointed -- he 
did not touch anything. 
  At a press conference an Italian journalist asked Boris 
Yeltsin about his health. The president replied: 
  "I would like everyone my age to have the same health as I 
have. I play tennis, swim in the Black Sea in March when the 
water temperature is four degrees, and work 16-18 hours a day 
with hardly any days off. I would like to make the following 
offer to those who try to upset me by talking about my health: 
I am prepared to undergo an all-day checkup [dispanserizatsiya] 
with journalists present. Let the doctors do their examinations 
and produce their analyses, and then everyone will know my state 
of health."

  [Text] In an interview with Interfax and RIA news agencies 
on Wednesday evening President Boris Yeltsin summed up the main 
results of his first official visit to Spain. 
  "The main thing is that the visit was fruitful. The 
foundation for active cooperation between Russia and Spain was 
laid", the president said. He pointed to the significance of 
the friendship and cooperation treaty as well as several other 
key agreements signed in Madrid. 
  He also attached great importance to personal relations with 
the Spanish leaders and politicians, which he described as very 
good. 
  "I felt that Spaniards were as attracted to Russia as 
Russians to Spain. Nothing separates us, while Europe, European 
affairs, common security and concerns about economic stability 
in both Russia and Spain unite use", Yeltsin said. 
  The president spoke of the importance of the Spanish 
experience of the transition from dictatorship to democracy. He 
said Russians should draw useful conclusions from this 
experience. 
  Yeltsin again spoke for signing a cooperation agreement 
between Russia and the European Union in the nearest future. 
  On Russia's membership in the NATO Partnership for Peace 
program Yeltsin said the country will gradually prepare for 
signing such an agreement, but will not hurry.

  [Excerpts] Today Barcelona welcomed Boris Yeltsin who 
completed the official part of his visit to Spain yesterday. 
[passage omitted] Boris Yeltsin briefly answered journalists's 
questions. 
  [Begin Yeltsin recording] Foundations have been laid down 
for 
cooperation between us that I think will develop very actively 
in the future, now that a treaty has been signed, together with 
a number of important agreements. I consider my personal 
contacts with the King, the government chairman, the chairman of 
Catalonia, and other politicians a matter of no small 
importance. This was a good contact on a human level. There is 
nothing to divide us. We are united by Europe, the European 
issues we have in common, the questions of security common to 
all of us, and of course the issue of economic stability both in 
Russia and in Spain. There is a lot we can learn here, and I 
was interested to hear about the Spanish experience of the 
transitional period, which we too are currently going through. 
There are some lessons we can learn from it, and this will be 
beneficial to Russians and to Russia itself. [end recording] 
  The Russian president's plane is expected to land in Moscow 
very shortly.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Apr -- The Russian Foreign Ministry has 
expressed regret that the Russian delegation sent to Ukraine in 
connection with the recent incidents around the Black Sea Fleet 
was not given the opportunity of visiting Odessa. This was said 
at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry's information and press department. 
  He said "the Russian delegation proposed visiting Odessa 
together with Ukrainian representatives." According to G. 
Karasin, "the Russian side made this proposal in the belief that 
a joint visit to Odessa by Russian and Ukrainian representatives 
and their possible meetings and conversations with people could 
have been received with satisfaction and understanding by public 
opinion both in Russia and Ukraine and would have helped ease 
the tension which has arisen following the recent incidents 
around the Black Sea Fleet in Odessa." Such a joint working 
visit would undoubtedly have been in the spirit of cooperation 
and friendship between our peoples, the Russian Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said.

  [Text] Son Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to Russia, made a 
skeptical assessment of Moscow's proposal calling on Pyongyang 
to participate in the international meeting to discuss the 
situation on the Korean peninsula. 
  He, in an interview with reporters in Moscow, said he doubts 
whether the meeting is necessary when the majority of parties 
that will participate in the meeting are pro-U.S. He also 
pointed out that participating in the meeting would place the 
DPRK in a very difficult position. 
  Ambassador Son said he sees the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula as a matter between Pyongyang and Washington. If the 
issue is internationalized, (?finding a solution to the nuclear 
problem would be even more difficult), he added.

Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow April 13 TASS -- "Russia has taken a flexible 
stance on ways of settlement of the nuclear problem on the 
Korean Peninsula. The most important thing for the Russian 
diplomacy is that the problem be resolved," said Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov in an interview with ITAR-TASS 
on Wednesday. 
  "Our position presupposes that this problem can be resolved 
both at bilateral talks and in the framework of the U.N. 
Security Council, but even if this yields no results, 
possibilities of an international conference should be used," 
Panov said. 
  According to Panov, a Russia-suggested idea of holding an 
international conference on problems of ensuring security and a 
nuclear-free status of the Korean Peninsula is being rejected 
neither by China, nor by Japan or South Korea. As for North 
Korea, at the present stage, Pyongyang is coming out for the 
settlement of the nuclear problem only at bilateral talks with 
the United States, Panov said. 
  The Russian diplomat pointed out that Russia cannot agree 
with statements that an international conference will 
procrastinate the negotiating process. It is bilateral talks 
that impede the solution of the problem, he said. 
  "One cannot say that this is a bilateral problem only. It 
concerns the whole world community once at issue is North 
Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
Moreover, this problem mostly concerns countries located in 
close proximity to the Korean Peninsula," the Russian diplomat 
said. 
  He spoke on problems of the Korean Peninsula in connection 
with talks between heads of the Russian and South Korean foreign 
ministries scheduled on Thursday, which would be attended by 
South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu who arrived in Moscow 
today.

for its interest in the problem of the Korean Peninsula and its 
concern in this matter", Han Sung-chu, the foreign minister of 
the Korean Republic, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent at 
Sheremetyevo-2 airport today. Replying to a question about 
Seoul's attitude to Moscow's proposal to hold an international 
conference on questions of ensuring the security and 
nuclear-free status of the Korean Peninsula, he said that the 
Republic of Korea will continue consultations on the conference 
with Russia and other interested sides. 
  Han Sung-chu arrived in Moscow today on a visit, during the 
course of which on Thursday [14 April] he will be holding talks 
with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, and meet the 
leadership of the Russian Federal Assembly. 
  At the talks with the head of Russia's foreign political 
department, Han Sung-chu noted, questions of the preparations 
for the visit of Kim Yong-sam, the president of the Republic of 
Korea, to Russia in June will be discussed. Various subjects, 
including how to solve the nuclear problem of the DPRK, will be 
examined. "We will also examine questions of cooperation 
between our two countries in the economic and diplomatic 
spheres," the South Korean minister said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Grigoriy Arslanov and </F>
Vyacheslav Tomilin] 
  [Text] Beijing April 14 TASS -- The Russian Defence 
Ministry attaches prime importance to the development of 
relations with the Armed Forces of China. We remember that we 
are linked by the common border stretching for 4.5 thousand 
kilometers. My generation remembers periods of confrontation, 
including military, particularly in border areas. Russia and 
China have worked out a common position -- relations between the 
two countries and their armies must become good-neighbourly and 
fraternal in character -- Russia's Chief of Staff 
Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov said in an interview with 
ITAR-TASS today. 
  During his visit to China, which ended today, General 
Kolesnikov had talks with his Chinese counterpart Zhang Wannian 
and Deputy Chairman of the Central Military Council of the 
Chinese People's Republic Liu Huanqin. 
  In the course of the talks, General Kolesnikov said, "The 
two 
neighbours conducted a frank exchange of views. We stick to the 
policy of further rapprochement between the armies of the two 
countries and regard China as an equal partner. We have what to 
share [as received] with China, including in the 
military-technical sphere", he said. General Kolesnikov 
explained that he means deliveries of different kinds of 
armaments and military equipment, in which China is interested 
and sending Russian military specialists to China to help 
partners in making proper use of the deliveries, and the 
training of Chinese officers in Russian higher schools, up to 
the General Staff Academy. China expressed the desire to 
continue negotiations on further interaction along all these 
lines on a regular and planned basis. 
  General Kolesnikov said he had a frank exchange of views 
with 
Chinese colleagues about the Korean peninsula nuclear problem. 
"Our viewpoints are quite close. Russia and China, two of the 
officially recognised five nuclear powers, are categorically 
against any proliferation of nuclear technologies", he said. 
  According to the Russian general, the situation in Northeast 
Asia is further complicated by "the unfairly tough pressure" 
that is being brought to bear on Pyongyang by international 
organisations, including the United Nations and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, as well as the United 
States. On the other hand, he said, North Korea is sticking to 
"a tough and inflexible stand". Both sides should be more 
yielding if they want a solution that would suit all, General 
Kolesnikov said. 
  As concerns his impressions from visiting Beijing and 
Shanghai, General Kolesnikov stressed that radical economic 
reforms are being carried out in China in conditions of 
political stability, and the country looks "like one large 
construction site".

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksandr Romanov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 13 Apr -- We are proceeding on the basis 
that the Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy and Tarabarovy islands near 
Khabarovsk are Russian. This is the position that our 
representatives have been expounding and defending at the talks 
with the Chinese side on border issues, the ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was told today by a senior Russian Foreign 
Ministry staff member. Moreover they have been and remain de 
facto under our control. The border talks with China, he said, 
are not hampering this territory being under our jurisdiction. 
  The high-ranking Russian Foreign Ministry staff member 
elucidated the situation in connection with a report that a 
public committee to promote and consolidate the Russian status 
of these islands has been set up in Khabarovsk. The committee 
has sent an appeal to Federal Assembly deputies proposing that a 
demand be made that the Russian Foreign Ministry should 
"officially and precisely express the position of the Russian 
state on the immutable Russian status of the islands." 
  The diplomat said the position of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry had been determined in accordance with the government's 
instructions for holding talks on demarcating the border with 
the People's Republic of China. The talks have been under way 
for 30 years now. They made it possible for the first time in 
the history of relations between the two countries in May 1991 
to sign the agreement between the USSR and the PRC on the 
eastern section of the Soviet-Chinese state border. The 
document was ratified by the Russian and Chinese parliaments and 
afterwards signed by the Russian president and the PRC chairman. 
It therefore has the force of a treaty. 
  At present the line of the border between Russia and China, 
which extends for 4,300 km, has been more than 98 percent agreed 
upon, excluding two sectors -- the islands near Khabarovsk and 
the Bolshoy island on the river Argun in Chita Oblast. As for 
the Chinese maps, which designate these islands as PRC 
territory, that is a matter for the Chinese side. Russia's 
representatives at the border talks have repeatedly mentioned 
these cartographical inaccuracies, but for quite understandable 
reasons we cannot make the Chinese designate the aforementioned 
islands as ours on their maps. Naturally on Russian maps they 
are shown belonging to the territory of Russia. 
  By mutual agreement of the sides the border talks are 
strictly confidential. This is so work involving 
representatives of the Foreign Ministry, Defense Ministry and 
other departments may proceed in a calm atmosphere. The fact 
that the inhabitants of the Amur valley are insufficiently 
well-informed on these issues is to be explained precisely by 
this circumstance. According to the senior Russian Foreign 
Ministry staff member, a certain amount of concern locally has 
been produced by reports in the Japanese press claiming that the 
islands near Khabarovsk have already been handed over to China, 
which in no way corresponds to reality.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 13 Apr -- Intergovernmental Russian-Tajik 
talks ended today with the signing of two agreements -- on 
Russian participation in completing the construction of the 
Rogun GES [hydroelectric power station] and on a Russian loan to 
Tajikistan of 80 billion rubles to be advanced during 1994. The 
delegations from the two countries were headed by Prime 
Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin and Abdulmadjid Samadov. 
  Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent, the 
chairman of the Tajik Council of Ministers disclosed that 
economic relations between the two countries were discussed 
during the talks. 
  The nature of these relations is currently determined to a 
great extent by the economic situation in our republic and the 
need to resolve tasks involved in the unification of the Tajik 
and Russian monetary systems, he said. Samadov added that the 
80 billion rubles loan would be spent largely on repayment of 
debts to Russian suppliers of goods. 
  Referring to today's announcement that the President of 
Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev would not be attending the CIS 
summit on 15 April in Moscow, Chernomyrdin said that he has not 
yet been informed officially of this. As for Nazarbayev's idea 
of creating a Euro-Asian union, Chernomyrdin believes that at 
the moment there is no substance to this idea. At all events, 
the prime minister said, I do not know what lies behind this 
proposal. 
  The head of the Russian Government agreed that the leaders 
of 
many CIS countries were unhappy with the present state of 
cooperation within the Commonwealth, which, as Chernomyrdin put 
it, now needs to be intensified. We must move on to action 
rather than words, he said.

  [Text] The agreement on the unification of the Russian and 
Belarusian monetary systems, signed by the prime ministers on 
Tuesday, differs from the original draft, leader of the Russia's 
Choice faction Yegor Gaydar told Interfax in an exclusive 
interview. 
  He said that among the most essential amendments was the 
integration of the National Bank of Belarus with Russia's 
Central Bank. 
  This circumstance gives hope for a better regulation of 
Russian-Belarusian monetary relations and is expected to enhance 
the efficiency of this document, said Gaydar. However, the 
agreement does not specify during what period the National Bank 
of Belarus will become a branch of the Central Bank, he 
continued. 
  He expressed deep concern about the decision on exchanging 
the Belarusian citizens' deposits and cash. According to the 
agreement, every Belarusian citizen is to exchange 200,000 
Belarusian coupons at the 1:1 rate, so the total sum to be 
exchanged at such a rate will amount to two trillion rubles. 
  As the worth of the Belarusian coupon will be artificially 
increased, and given the difference between the worth of the 
cash and non-cash Belarusian coupon, large-scale manipulations 
of cash in both countries are likely to take place, said Gaydar. 
  Before the agreement goes into force and is ratified by the 
Russian and Belarusian parliaments, fantastic opportunities will 
emerge for financial machinations involving sums worth billions 
of dollars, he went on to say. 
  He pointed out that the agreement makes the economy hostage 
to political games, especially on the eve of parliamentary 
elections in Belarus.

<F P=106> [Sergey Knyazkov report under the "Postscriptum Events and </F>
Comments" rubric: "Shooting on Baltic Practice Ranges May Drag 
Out. The Signing by Presidents of Russia and Latvia of Accords 
on Russian Troops Withdrawal From This Baltic Country Is 
Postponed"] 
  [Text] The Defense Ministry of Estonia has announced that 
servicemen of the 114th Motorized Rifle Division of the Russian 
Armed Forces stationed in Tallinn conducted on 7 April practice 
firing on the Manchiku range on Tallinn's outskirts without 
permission from the Estonian authorities. Representatives of 
the Estonian Armed Forces were not invited to the range to 
observe the firing practice. 
  "Yes, we do hold combat training sessions," Guards Colonel 
Yevgeniy Lazebin, the division's chief of staff, said, 
confirming the information. "It is not being done spontaneously 
but rather in line with approved plans and schedules. 
Servicemen perform firing drills using submachine guns, and 
practice grenade throwing which, incidentally, is done once 
every six months. Since we have not handed over the range to 
Estonia, it is being used for regular training sessions of which 
we are not supposed to notify the Estonian side," Lazebin 
underlined. 
  It is not accidental that KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has to explain in 
such detail what appears to be a fairly banal situation 
involving servicemen of the Northwestern Group of Forces. It so 
happened that precisely the same situation that took shape two 
weeks earlier in Latvia led to a protest note by the Foreign 
Ministry of the Republic of Latvia. It maintained that during a 
16 March firing practice, unsanctioned by local authorities, on 
the firing range of the Russian military unit stationed in 
Stopinskaya Volost of Riga Rayon, an incident took place between 
Latvian militia members and Russian servicemen. Alas, this 
information, too, needs some explaining. Col. Igor Golin, chief 
of the Northwestern Group of Forces press center, explained that 
the practice firing was carried out on a planned basis and had 
been agreed with the local authorities -- not by Russian 
servicemen at all, but by civilians: militarized guards hired 
on contract to guard the Russian military unit's storages. 
  The Baltic states' desire to part with the Russian army as 
soon as possible is to be appreciated. And for as long as it 
remains in Latvia and Estonia, combat training will continue 
there. It may even drag out because both in the Baltics and in 
Russia there are many forces wishing to derail the dialogue 
between Russia and the Baltic countries. As Sergey 
Krasavchenko, deputy head of the Russian president's staff, has 
stated to ITAR-TASS, "the error (in the Russian Federation 
president's directive No. 174 on the creation of military bases 
in CIS states and the Latvian Republic. -- Note by S.K.) was not 
technical but a political action aimed at derailing the meeting 
between the heads of Russia and Latvia. The aim has, 
unfortunately, been reached -- Guntis Ulmanis has canceled the 
visit to Moscow planned for 20 April.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Kovalenko: "Russia Will Cross the Council </F>
of Europe Threshold in Early 1995"] 
  [Text] Strasbourg -- The difficult process of Russia's 
entry into the Council of Europe, which has dragged on for two 
long years, finally reached its concluding stage today. Now 
Russia will apparently join this prestigious organization, 
bringing together 32 states, at the very beginning of 1995. 
This was stated in Strasbourg by Miguel Martinez, president of 
the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly. 
  Observers present at the Russian parliamentary elections 
deemed them "free and democratic." The holding of elections, 
together with the adoption of the new Constitution, removed any 
doubts and objections concerning Russia's admission. 
  Moscow has signed a number of key agreements and conventions 
of the Council of Europe and has become actively involved in its 
activities. Full membership of the organization, Federation 
Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko said at a Parliamentary 
Assembly session, will help improve Russian legislation and will 
provide powerful support in the building of democracy. It will 
give Russia access to European programs in the spheres of human 
rights, culture, education, information, and ecology. Finally, 
by joining the Council, V. Shumeyko stressed, our country will 
be able to participate effectively in the shaping of European 
policy in all these areas.

  [Text] In a broadcast on the Russian Kaliningrad region 
state television, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian 
Liberal Democratic Party, said that there are real possibilities 
for changing state borders in East Europe. 
  The Baltic News Service reports that, in the opinion of 
Zhirinovskiy, the German-Polish, Polish-Ukrainian and 
Lithuanian-Russian borders should be revised. He stated that 
Russia and Germany have always been the main powers in Europe, 
therefore their requirements should be satisfied first of all. 
Asked about the further fate of the Kaliningrad region, the 
Russian national radical stated that it has to become a bridge 
between Russia and Germany. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has stated more than once that the 
Baltic states must belong to the Russian empire, and he promised 
to bury radioactive waste near the Lithuanian border.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Sergey Babkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 13 TASS -- "Russia is destined to play 
an important role in the promotion of the Middle East 
settlement," ITAR-TASS was told today by Amin Barakat, 
ambassador of the Palestinian state to Russia, in connection 
with Yasir 'Arafat's visit to the Russian Federation, expected 
to begin on April 19. 
  Speaking about the goals of Palestinian President 'Arafat's 
trip to the Russian capital, the ambassador said that this would 
be his first visit to the Russian Federation. In the course of 
talks with Russian officials, 'Arafat will discuss the deadlines 
for the establishment of Palestinian autonomy and for the 
withdrawal of Israeli troops from territories where Palestinian 
self-government is to be proclaimed. He also said that 'Arafat 
had addressed a message to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The 
document calls on Russia to exert influence on Israel in order 
to make it fulfil the terms of the "Gaza-Jericho-First" 
agreement, in accordance with which Palestinian self-government 
is to be established in the Gaza Strip and in the area around 
Jericho (the Western Bank). The second purpose of the visit is 
to discuss bilateral relations in the political and economic 
spheres. A Russo-Palestinian agreement on cooperation in these 
spheres is expected to be concluded. 
  Asked what the Palestinian leadership expected from Russia 
in 
the process of the Mideast settlement, Barakat said: Russia's 
role is clear. It is a member of the U.N. Security Council and 
co-chairman of the Madrid peace conference, and one of the 
initiators of the "Gaza-Jericho-First" agreement, signed in 
Washington last year. In my opinion, Russia will play an 
important role in the further promotion of the settlement 
process at the stage when it helped, together with the Palestine 
side, to break the deadlock in this process. 
  The ambassador expressed the hope that Russia, which is a 
great country with a huge potential, would help Palestine to 
estabish its national statehood. 
  Touching on problems, interfering with the early fulfilment 
of the Palestine-Israeli "Gaza-Jericho-First" agreement, the 
ambassador said that representatives of the two sides were now 
discussing in Cairo the details of its implementation, linked 
with the Israeli withdrawal from the territories that are to be 
transferred to Palestinian self-government, with the security 
measures that are to be taken there, and also with the transfer 
of powers to the Palestinian national authorities after the 
withdrawal of the Israeli Army. He noted that Israel was trying 
to misinterpret the formulations of the agreement at the Cairo 
talks. "Instead of deciding how Israel is to withdraw from those 
territories, the talks are again being focused on individual 
provisions of the agreement," the Palestinian ambassador noted. 
"We shall continue the negotiations without renouncing our 
vision of autonomy, which will eventually develop into a 
Palestinian state," he added.

  [Text] Moscow April 13 TASS -- "The Russian Foreign 
Ministry is not planning to close down the Russian Embassy in 
Rwanda for the time being," Leonid Safonov, head of the Africa 
Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, told ITAR-TASS 
today. He also said that the staff members of the Russian 
Embassy and of the "Aeroflot" office, who were evacuated 
together with their families from Rwanda to Burundi, would 
return to Moscow on April 15. Only the ambassador and 2 or 3 
members of the embassy will remain in Kigali. 
  Twenty-two Russian citizens were evacuated from Rwanda on 
April 12. The Russian Foreign Ministry decided not to risk the 
lives of its representatives there. The Russian ambassador in 
Rwanda was instructed to get in touch with Russian women, 
married to Rwanda citizens and wishing to leave the country. 
"However, most of them preferred to stay in Rwanda," Safonov 
stated. There are now 15 such Russian women in Rwanda. There 
are also 10 Russian employees of the United Nations in the 
country.

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Mogil: There Is Money. We Await the </F>
Elections"] 
  [Text] In order to report on the trip to the Central 
Election Commission in Moscow and answer questions that had 
accumulated during their absence, Chairman of the Kray Election 
Commission S. Knyazev and Ye. Khrustalev assembled journalists 
in the White House the day before yesterday. 
  It appears from what they said that the decision of the 
governor of the kray concerning delaying the elections to the 
kray Duma until autumn made sense to the Central Election 
Commission. They also did not fail to pay attention to the 
financial needs of Maritime Kray regarding the conduct of 
elections. The necessary amount of money was released. Thus, 
the kray election commission was able to return half a billion 
rubles [R] to the kray budget, from where the money was borrowed 
to finance the initial stages of the election campaign, and 
which the governor also promised to release for social programs. 
  S. Knyazev dispelled the concerns of journalists about the 
safekeeping of the money allocated for the elections postponed 
until autumn. But so that the millions will be safer, he will 
probably even cancel a trip to Moscow, where on 20 April the 
Supreme Court plans to examine an appeal filed by Messrs 
Gilgenberg, Kandarakov, and Isayev concerning the, in their 
opinion, improper cutting up of electoral districts. According 
to the law, the complaint can be examined even in the absence of 
representatives of the kray election commission. 
  As for the Supreme Court finding on the essence of the 
complaint, the delay of the elections to a later date only 
contributes to objectivity. In the words of S. Knyazev, such a 
subjective factor as an already elected kray Duma would 
complicate the work of justice. 
  Mentioning that we all walk under God, the visitors 
explained 
the situation regarding the candidates for deputy who are 
already registered. This is how matters stand: If 55 days 
before the scheduled date of the elections there are less than 
two candidates for deputy in any electoral district for any 
reason whatsoever, a prenomination mandatory collection of 
signatures will be held as before. 
  It was decided not to change the composition of the kray and 
district election commissions. They will continue their work.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Boris Yefimovich Nemtsov, governor of </F>
Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast and Federation Council deputy, by Inna 
Yermilova; from the "Utro" program--live] 
  [Text] [Yermilova] I am very happy to introduce Boris 
Yefimovich Nemtsov, governor of Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast and 
deputy of the Federation Council, who is the guest of our 
program today. We know that for the past year and a half, you 
have been preparing a decree on land reform in Nizhniy Novgorod 
Oblast, and today I would like to find out what this program 
represents, what progress has been made in general, and what the 
prospects are? 
  [Nemtsov] Yes indeed. Last spring we began working on a 
program for reorganizing the kolkhozes and sovkhozes in Nizhniy 
Novgorod Oblast. So we worked on it for a year and finally the 
work was completed, and during the Prime Minister's visit to 
Nizhniy Novgorod we demonstrated the program's potential. After 
that, on 10 March, the Prime Minister declared that on the basis 
of this work, an overall national program of land reform could 
be announced within 10 days. This was a very big honor for us, 
the people of Nizhniy Novgorod... 
  [Yermilova, interrupts] In other words, it was convincing. 
  [Nemtsov] As far as I know, the Prime Minister was very 
pleased with it and the fact that a draft Government decree has 
been drawn up -- I hope it will be signed in the next few days 
-- speaks for itself. Viktor Stepanovich [Chernomyrdin] did 
what he promised, although he was 10 days late. But that is not 
important. But I would like to... 
  [Yermilova, interrupts] Well, I wish you success and hope 
the decree will be signed as soon as possible. 
  [Nemtsov] The most important thing is for Viktor Stepanovich 
to sign it. In fact the program looks fairly straight forward, 
and I would simply like to outline its basic principles. The 
most important principle, in our view, is that the peasants 
themselves should choose how to work, whether to work separately 
as farmers, in cooperatives, or in joint stock associations. 
This is their problem. We as bureaucrats should not interfere 
with this. On the basis of this principle we proposed the 
following scheme: Every peasant, including pensioners, who 
worked in an agricultural establishment [khozyaystvo] will 
receive a certificate like this... 
  [Yermilova interrupts] Let us show it. [holds up 
certificate]. 
  [Nemtsov] It is a certificate of entitlement to a portion of 
the land, and a similar certificate will be issued for the right 
to a share of the property. After receiving these certificates, 
the peasants have the right to do what they want with them. 
They can invest a certificate in a new partnership in the form 
of founding capital, they can sell it, they can bequeath it, or 
give it away as a gift. So what happens in practice is that 
leaders, whom you can always find in an agricultural 
establishment, organize powerful partnerships around themselves, 
while babushkas who relinquish their certificates receive 
certain advantages. For instance, they may request a daily 
delivery of three liters of milk in exchange for their 
certificates. 
  [Yermilova] This really happens? 
  [Nemtsov] Yes it does. An agreement on the delivery of 
milk, or possibly the repair of a roof, or deliveries of wood is 
drawn up. 
  [Yermilova] But who will do this, surely this would require 
a large team of people who would do nothing else? 
  [Nemtsov] No, this will not be their only job, first of all 
they will... 
  [Yermilova interrupts] But who will deliver the milk? 
  [Nemtsov] A new partnership which will be engaged in milk 
production will take care of this. After the partnership has 
been formed, its leader will submit a request to the 
privatization commission asking it to consider the possibility 
of purchasing the given portion of land and the property, such 
as a tractor, warehouse, and so forth. Now the question of who 
gets what is solved in a rather interesting way. If, for 
instance, two partnerships or two individuals aspire to the same 
piece of land, then an auction is held. Besides, payment is 
made with these certificates -- not money, not dollars, only 
these certificates. The one who gives the greatest number of 
certificates for the land will get it. The same will be done 
with property. For instance, if there are several prospective 
clients for a tractor, it will go to the one who provides the 
most certificates. 
  [Yermilova] So the idea is that citizens should give up 
their certificates to those whom they trust -- those who know 
how to work and love working on the land. 
  [Nemtsov] What we have in mind is that citizens will 
determine for themselves what they will do with their 
certificates. Experience has shown that they will give them to 
the most promising people who will be able to organize the work, 
who as owners of this land and property will be capable of 
working efficiently and making profits, thereby fulfilling their 
obligations to, say, the babushkas, right? 
  [Yermilova] Yes. 
  [Nemtsov] Now we already have this kind of experience, and 
in fact, one agricultural establishment, the Pravdinskoye 
establishment in Balakhninskiy Rayon, has been reorganized and 
nine establishments have appeared in its place -- two farming 
partnerships that produce milk, maintenance workshops, and so 
forth. Besides, there were no rows and no fighting as usually 
happens when people argue about who gets what. None of that 
occurred because everything was done in an open and honest way. 
So the main principle, the freedom of choice, was adhered to. 
It is a principle which never existed in old Russia when the 
land issue was being worked out. 
  [Yermilova] Even in the time of Stolypin? 
  [Nemtsov] Yes, even in the time of Stolypin, because 
Stolypin sometimes broke up communes by force and people simply 
left for (?remote regions). They were coerced. In fact, the 
Stolypin reform was carried out by the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. Stolypin was the minister of internal affairs at one 
time. Of course, he was also the governor of Saratov, but when 
he was the governor, he was not involved in any reforms. He 
only took on the reforms when he became a big boss in St. 
Petersburg. 
  [Yermilova] Boris Yefimovich, how do the people in Nizhniy 
Novgorod themselves view this idea? Have you made any kind of 
analysis of this issue? 
  [Nemtsov] You know, we are carrying out our enormous 
preparatory work with people. For instance, very many people 
have no idea what to do with their certificates. So babushkas 
are putting them under their pillows, and until things have been 
explained to them... 
  [Yermilova interrupts] And they wait for some special 
moment. 
  [Nemtsov] They are either waiting for some moment or for an 
explanation about what they can do with them. When they learn 
about their unusual opportunities, they promptly become the 
major supporters of reforms. So the polls which we held in 
agricultural establishments showed that most people support this 
idea and consider it to be most constructive. 
  [Yermilova] I think the idea is simply grand. 
  [Nemtsov] It is particularly supported by two categories of 
people: first of all the pensioners who have nothing -- all of a 
sudden they have an opportunity to acquire something. The 
second rather surprising circumstance is that the idea of 
reorganization is supported by leaders. You often hear: Those 
red kolkhozniks, those kolkhoz chairmen ruin everything. 
Nothing of the sort. It turns out that they are the greatest 
supporters of this idea because they are tired of forcing 
drunkards and idlers to work. Secondly, because they are sick 
and tired of everyone being judged equally, and thirdly, because 
they want to see a return on the work that they have undertaken 
so that they can exist in a normal way -- so that they can live 
on their earnings, spending as much as they have earned. 
  So the leader is interested in these reforms because they 
rid 
him of drunks and idlers. For instance, if an alcoholic comes 
to him and says he wants to work in his agricultural 
establishment, the chairman can say: You know, dear fellow, no 
thanks, go find work somewhere else. I will not employ you. 
Or: I will take you, but only on the condition that I can fire 
you at any moment. 
  [Yermilova interrupts] In other words: You have a choice, 
quit drinking and start working. 
  [Nemtsov] Yes, stop drinking and start working. You know 
there is hope, which is not often mentioned, for raising 
discipline in production. Well, our agricultural enterprise 
leaders nurture this hope, and it can be realized. The most 
important aim of this program is to make agriculture efficient. 
As soon as laborers show concern, as soon as we can get rid of 
idlers and drunkards, people will become active and will start 
working. In my opinion, this is the most essential circumstance 
setting this program apart from all previous ones. We are not 
coercing people into becoming farmers. They choose for 
themselves. We do not tell them which method of production is 
the best -- they can choose it themselves. Thirdly, as a result 
of this reorganization, we rid ourselves of a ballast which 
weighs us down and really impoverishes Russia. 
  [Yermilova] Boris Yefimovich, I have lots of questions to 
ask you. I would like to talk about industrial loans and about 
telephone loans, but we do not have the opportunity to do this 
today. So I would like you to promise to reappear in our 
program's studio again soon. Now, if I may, a short final 
question. You are a young, presentable, handsome, and 
unattached person. Does this help you or hinder you in your 
work? 
  [Nemtsov] This helps me without a doubt. I do not entirely 
agree with what you just said, but it helps me. At least, I 
think it is highly fortunate to have the energy and 
opportunities to implement your ideas. 
  [Yermilova] Thank you. All the best and good luck with this 
project and decree. I hope it will be adopted soon. I would 
like to remind our viewers that Boris Yefimovich Nemtsov, 
governor of Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast and deputy of the Federation 
Council, was the guest of the "Utro" program. Thank you. 
  [Nemtsov] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by Y. Mishina: "This Has Never Been the Case"] </F>
  [Text] For the first time in history, 1993 saw a natural 
decline in the number of people in the oblast. The birthrate 
dropped by 13 percent, while the death rate increased by 22 
percent compared with 1992. The number of births plunged to an 
unprecedented figure -- 8.9 births per 10,000 inhabitants. 
Meanwhile, the death ratio rose to 13 to three. According to 
specialists from the Committee for Employment and Social Issues 
at the Oblast Administration, the unfavorable changes in the 
residents' age that have occurred over the past few years are 
responsible for the declining birthrate. Another reason is the 
drop in the number of women of reproductive age (between 20 and 
29) as a result of the demographic wave caused by World War II, 
as well as of the family conditions of the adult population -- 
the larger part of those who have always been single or who are 
divorced. Other factors that are having an increased influence 
on the demographic process, in particular, on the natural 
population growth, are the critical economic situation, the drop 
in living standards, and residents' uncertainty over the future.

<F P=106> [Yekaterina Achalova report: "Central Electoral Commission </F>
Holds Meeting. Referendum Results in Amur Oblast To Be 
Determined One More Time"] 
  [Text] It became clear after yesterday's meeting of the 
Central Electoral Commission that a certain revision of the 
December constitutional referendum results in the near future is 
inevitable. The meeting, which was chaired by Nikolay Ryabov, 
decided to dissolve the district commission in Amur Oblast for 
falsifying the referendum protocols. 
  An investigation has shown that electoral commission 
officials in Amur Oblast acted on a large scale. Erasures and 
corrections in the "For" and "Against" columns have been found 
in 21 protocols, and it has been established for certain that in 
11 of them the results of the voting were falsified. Central 
Electoral Commission officials refused to tell KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
in which columns of the protocols the number of votes was 
deliberately increased or reduced. The very fact that it was 
passed over in silence, however, tells a lot. Having discussed 
the situation in Amur Oblast, the Central Electoral Commission 
decided to dissolve the local district commission. A new 
commission will be set up in its stead to count once again the 
number of votes cast at the referendum. 
  The Central Electoral Commission meeting also discussed the 
judicial practice of considering complaints against 
irregularities that occurred in the course of the Federal 
Assembly elections. The commission thinks in particular that 
the case involving Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's personal seat, which 
he won in the Shchelkovskiy district, was "a watershed." It 
should be recalled that the district court deemed the elections 
to be invalid, but the oblast court revoked the ruling. The 
Central Electoral Commission was satisfied with the outcome, 
because it alone can declare elections invalid. Having 
considered the results of regional elections, which have given 
administration officials one-third of regional parliament seats, 
the Central Electoral Commission concluded that the separation 
of powers is still proceeding poorly in Russia.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Karlov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 13 TASS -- "Grave indications of 
serious medical aftermaths, caused by the irradiation of human 
beings, have appeared eight years after the Chernobyl disaster," 
ITAR-TASS was told today by staff members of the Medical 
Radiology Research Centre of the Russian Academy of Medical 
Sciences. 
  As many as 517 people, afflicted by radiation, were found in 
58 Russian cities, including Novgorod, Izhevsk, Elista, Kurgan, 
Novosibirsk, Omsk, and Khabarovsk. But the Chernobyl zone of 
contamination remains most threatening. It embraces 17 regions 
of Russia with a total population of more than two millions. 
Some children were found to be suffering form cancer of the 
thyroid gland in those areas. In normal conditions there are 
only a few cases of this ailment per million of children. 
Today, the incidence of this terrible disease has increased 
more than 20-fold in Gomel and Bryansk regions. Specialists 
forecast a sharp growth of this disease in Kaluga, Tula, and 
Oryol regions. 
  But Chernobyl is not the only danger zone in Russia. The 
second vast area of contamination is the southern part of the 
Urals. Several accidents there have contaminated with 
strontium-90 radionuclides an area of 2,000 square kilometres, 
inhabited by 300,000 people. 125,000 more people were 
irradiated by discharges of radioactive wastes into local rivers. 
  The third territory is in the southern part of Siberia, 
contaminated by the fallout of nuclear tests on the 
Semipalatinsk testing ground, where 467 nuclear devices were 
touched off in the course of fourteen years. Loyal to their 
"internationalist duty", Soviet servicemen carried out nuclear 
bomb tests only on days when the wind was blowing from China 
towards Altay territory, Kemerovo, Orenburg, and Novosibirsk 
regions. The population of those areas is now consuming 
contaminated meat and milk. Due to the deteriorating economic 
situation, people are beginning to fish and hunt intensively in 
contaminated woods. They are also consuming wild mushrooms and 
berries, picked in contaminated forests and meadows. 
  New methods of measuring the "average doses" of irradiation 
were developed during the period that has elapsed since the 
Chernobyl disaster. Measuring "average" doses in populated 
localities is the same as measuring the "average temperature" of 
patients in a hospital ward. Even in populated localities, 
where the "average dose" is normal, there will always be people 
with large doses of irradiation, making up the principal risk 
group. 
  Millions of people have suffered through the fault of the 
state. This is why the state must fulfil its commitment to lower 
to the maximum the consequences of contamination. But the 
Finance Ministry is now planning to sharply reduce or stop the 
allocation of funds for the Chernobyl programme. This will 
accelerate the already looming extinction of the nation's gene 
pool.

"Hostages Released"] 
  [Text] According to a report from Nazran, on 12 April 
Vladimir Lozovoy, chief of the Provisional Administration on the 
territory of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, who left for the site 
of an incident -- Vladikavkaz's Promyshlennyy District (which is 
located outside the state of emergency area and to which the 
authority of the Provisional Administration chief, consequently, 
does not apply) -- involving a motorcade from Ingushetia, was 
injured in a clash with an agitated mob. Neither the 
Provisional Administration chief's press center in Vladikavkaz 
nor the North Ossetian authorities have confirmed this 
information. [Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY in Russian on 14 April, 
page 14, in a Mikhail Lashch report on the incident, adds: 
"After Vladimir Lozovoy and his deputy, General Shapovalov, came 
to the site of the incident, people in the crowd who were not 
permitting the buses through started throwing stones at them. 
General Georgiy Kantemirov, North Ossetia internal affairs 
minister, who was present there, did not intervene in the 
proceedings. Mr. Lozovoy sustained a slight injury."] On the 
contrary, it has transpired there that a Russian military unit 
was blocked in Nazran. As for Ingush hostages who, according to 
reports from Nazran, were held by an Ossetian special purpose 
military unit, Vladikavkaz has said that all Ingush citizens 
were released by the evening of 12 April. This matter was 
attended to personally by Soslan Sikoyev, commandant of the 
North Ossetian capital. Meanwhile, the presidents of both 
republics, who have scheduled a meeting for 15 April in Nalchik, 
have confirmed their readiness to continue talks. Earlier, 
groups of experts left the North Ossetian and Ingush capitals 
for Kabardino-Balkaria to make preparations for the presidents' 
summit.

  [Text] The Ossetian-Ingush talks at the level of working 
groups of the two republics' experts were renewed in Nalchik 
(the capital of Kabardino Balkaria). Head of the Ossetian 
negotiation, Georgiy Jikgayev, told Interfax that a draft treaty 
on implementation of the Russian president's decree on return of 
refugees and displaced persons to their homes on North Ossetian 
and Ingush territory was being coordinated at the meeting of the 
experts. 
  The document had been adopted in general at the first round 
of the talks with the participation of Ossetian President 
Akhsarbek Galazov and Ingush President Ruslan Aushev in Nalchik 
in early April. Jikgayev was certain that experts would manage 
to work out a single draft document which the two presidents 
would discuss at their summit in Nalchik on April 14.

12 on the territory of North Ossetia, the second round of the 
North Ossetian-Ingushi talks started in Nalchik on Thursday. 
The delegations are led by Akhsarbek Galazov and Ruslan Aushev. 
  Before the talks the head of the interim authority Vladimir 
Lozovoy read out a government telegram signed by Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin. It says that the Cabinet worked out and 
approved measures to carry out the Russian president's decree on 
the return of refugees. Chernomyrdin expressed hope that both 
sides will find success in their talks. 
  The delegations started discussing the draft treaty between 
the two republics "On the Principles, Measures and Terms for the 
Implementation of the Russian President's Decree for the Return 
of the Refugees and Displaced People to the North Ossetia and 
the Ingushi Republic."

<F P=106> [Article by Ayaz Khasanov: "TOTs Intends To Come to Power"] </F>
  [Text] As IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA has reported, the cochairmen 
of the Tatar Social Center [TOTs] held a news conference in 
Kazan on the subject "The Future of the National Movement." 
  One of the leaders of the TOTs, Maro Shamsutdinov, 
acquainted 
journalists with the decisions of the last plenum of the social 
center, which openly proclaimed a new objective--coming to 
power. Moreover, it was emphasized: only by constitutional 
means. Up to the present TOTs had not put forth such a slogan, 
and has generally not engaged in the struggle for power. It 
also endeavored to resolve questions of the federalization of 
Russia. In the opinion of the organizers of the news conference 
there has been no real federalism in the Russian Federation, 
there is none, and it seems there will not be any; it has 
remained a unitary state. 
  For this reason, the leaders of the national movement cannot 
concur with the fact of the signing of the treaty between 
Tatarstan and Russia, which preserves the centralized 
distribution of a planned economy. But what is dangerous, TOTs 
members think, is not the treaty, which actually is more of a 
political nature, but intergovernmental agreements that are 
reinforced by the treaty. TOTs cannot agree at all with the 12 
agreements in which the direct implementation of the treaty is 
laid out. And it does not share the position of the Supreme 
Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan, which remains silent when 
the executive organs sign an interstate treaty. Early elections 
to parliament, TOTs representatives think, are simply necessary 
inasmuch as the legislative organ is not coping with its 
functions. 
  In the opinion of the leaders of the national movement, the 
formation of a new personnel policy plays a not unimportant 
role. Up to now this question is being resolved in secrecy. But 
what is needed, first and foremost, is the appointment of heads 
of administration through elections. Otherwise they will remain 
officials with unlimited authority over which there is no 
control. 
  The TOTs leaders intend also to engage in the destatization 
of the mass media, as they are convinced that they are strictly 
subordinated today to the power structures. 
  Regarding the question of a split in the leadership of the 
national movement, Rashat Safin informed journalists of the 
decision of the plenum to declare a moratorium on criticism and 
fighting among themselves. "For the sake of the nation's 
interests, we must be together, especially since our views have 
never differed on the main thing."

statement adopted by the State Duma, the lower house of Russia's 
new parliament, on Wednesday said. The statement said that 
Russian parliamentarians "demand immediate convocation of the 
U.N. Security Council to discuss the situation, following NATO's 
military interference in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
adoption of measures to prevent escalation of this explosive 
situation." 
  Deputies called on all warring sides to immediately end the 
bloodshed and start negotiations on a comprehensive ceasefire 
agreement. 
  The statement stressed the need for urgent deployment of 
U.N. 
forces in the Gorazde area and adoption of measures to prevent 
provocations on any side. 
  Duma deputies urged the Russian Foreign Ministry to "work 
out 
an active position to set up an effective mechanism of 
implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions in order to 
ward off the use of force in the future bypassing Russia." 
Deputies rejected amendments to the statement proposed by 
several factions, including recommendations to the Russian 
Government, urging it to submit proposals to the Security 
Council to lift economic sanctions on Yugoslavia or to refrain 
from signing the Partnership for Peace programme.

  [Text] Moscow, 13 Apr -- Today, the State Duma adopted in 
their first reading a series of laws that should facilitate a 
more effective struggle against crime. These were federal laws 
"On the state protection of judges and employees of the law 
enforcing and monitoring bodies," "On the state protection of 
victims, witnesses, and other individuals assisting in criminal 
proceedings," and also "on the tabling of amendments and 
additions to the RSFSR criminal and criminal procedure code." 
  According to Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the Duma Committee 
for Security, who was presenting the draft laws to the deputies, 
the need for a speedy adoption of these laws was brought about 
by the acute situation with regard to crime in the country and 
the fact that the existing laws dealing with the battle against 
crime were insufficient and consequently ineffective. 
  In particular, Viktor Ilyukhin noted, the adoption of the 
law 
"On the state protection of judges and employees of the law 
enforcing and monitoring bodies" will allow the lives, health, 
and property of this category of citizens and their families and 
friends to be protected. The Duma committee chairman also 
stressed that the adoption of the law "On the state protection 
of victims, witnesses, and other individuals assisting in 
criminal proceedings" will permit the safety and social 
protection of these citizens to be guaranteed, so that the 
necessary conditions for the battle against crime might be 
created, and justice might be appropriately done in criminal 
cases. 
  The laws were adopted in their first reading without 
discussion since, in the parliamentarians' opinion, society had 
an acute need for their speedy adoption. All remarks and 
additions to the above laws which Duma deputies table in the 
immediate future will be taken into account during consideration 
of the laws in their second reading.

  [Text] Moscow, 13 Apr -- A federal law "On the status of a 
Federation Council deputy and the status of a State Duma deputy 
of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation" was adopted 
today as a whole by the State Duma. This law defines the 
rights, obligations, and responsibility of Federation Council 
and State Duma deputies of the first convocation, and envisages 
the basic legal and social guarantees of the work of elected 
deputies. 
  The law notes, among other things, that Federation Council 
and State Duma deputies enjoy immunity in the course of the 
whole of their term of office. They cannot be subjected to 
criminal or administrative responsibility submitted in legal 
form, detained, arrested, or subjected to search or 
interrogation without the consent of the appropriate Federal 
Assembly chamber -- apart from instances of their detention at 
the scene of a crime -- or subjected to personal inspection, 
with the exception of instances where this is provided for by a 
federal law to ensure the security of other persons. 
  A deputy's immunity extends to his place of domicile and 
work, his luggage, his private and company transport, his 
correspondence, the means of communications for his personal 
use, and also documents belonging to him. 
  A Russian Federation Federal Assembly deputy may not be 
subjected to criminal and administrative proceedings for a view 
or a position expressed during voting, including at the time of 
the expiry of his term of office. This situation does not 
extend to instances where a deputy has made public insults or 
committed slander and other violations, the responsibility for 
which is covered by federal legislation.

federal law "On the procedure for coverage by the state media of 
the activities of state power bodies" in its first reading. 
According to Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the Duma committee 
for information policy and communications, who presented the 
bill to deputies, this law regulates relations on dissemination 
by the state media of material and reports on the activities of 
Russia's state power bodies and its components and at the same 
time guarantees media activities are independent of state bodies. 
  Mikhail Poltoranin noted that the law regulates the 
publication of material on the activities of the Russian 
president, the Federal Assembly, the Russian Government and 
administrations, and representative bodies of Russian components. 
  Poltoranin stressed that the law also examines problems 
relating to the coverage of the activities of state power bodies 
by state radio and television; television and radio companies 
prepare material to be broadcast as part of news and 
news-cum-educational programs in conjunction with the press 
services of the federal bodies of state power. Procedures for 
recording and storing audio and audiovisual material are also 
regulated, and a list of events is specified, for which the 
channels of the state electronic media must give airtime.

<F P=106> [Ruslan Ignatyev report on interviews with State Duma First </F>
Deputy Chairman Mikhail Mityukov and State Duma Security 
Committee Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin; place and date of interviews 
not given] 
  [Text] At a recent meeting with representatives of the 
"Russia's Choice" faction, the Russian Federation president 
reported that he had sent 41 draft laws to the State Duma for 
consideration. But this drew the response that not a single 
draft law had been received by parliament. Where exactly are 
they? Your special correspondent put this question to Mikhail 
Mityukov, first deputy chairman of the State Duma. 
  [Mityukov] All we have received is a list of priority 
legislative acts scheduled for implementation in the first 
quarter of 1994. These lists were sent from both the government 
apparatus and the president's administration. But we have still 
not received the texts themselves. True, we can find three 
draft laws from the government on which the State Duma is 
working. 
  [Ignatyev] What do you think, where exactly are the draft 
laws sent by the president right now? 
  [Mityukov] They are in the Russian Federation president's 
State-Legal Administration.... [Mityukov ends] 
  Maybe the draft laws went to State Duma committees? The 
editorial office approached Security Committee Chairman Viktor 
Ilyukhin for an explanation. 
  [Ilyukhin] Of the 60 draft laws included on the list of 
priority legislative acts by the Russian Federation Government 
(letter No. 0085 p-P-36 of 4 February 1994), the State Duma has 
received only three draft laws. As regards the president's 
administration, not a single one of the 54 draft laws scheduled 
for consideration in parliament as of 5 April 1994 (letter No. 
PR-266 of 4 March 1994) has been submitted. [Ilyukhin ends] 
  In our quest for draft laws requiring urgent consideration 
we 
telephoned the Russian Government apparatus' department for 
collaboration with federal organs of representative power and 
public organizations. The reply we got from there was that it 
was impossible to give the exact number of draft laws sent to 
the State Duma because it receives legislative acts via various 
channels. Only Ruslan Orekhov, chief of the Russian Federation 
president's State-Legal Administration can throw some light on 
the situation that has developed. But owing to a lack of time 
he communicated via an aide that he would be not able to give 
the newspaper any time for several days. 
<H5>  ...Meanwhile </H5>
  The "Yuridicheskaya Literatura" Publishing House will start 
publishing a single collection of Russian legislative acts in 
the near future in accordance with the president's edict on the 
procedure for publishing federal laws and bringing them into 
force. The weekly collection will include laws, presidential 
edicts, and government decrees. In addition, they will also be 
officially published in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, Sergey Filatov 
reported.

  [Text] The Government of Kyrgyzstan has adopted a decree on 
the state and preservation of state property by Kyrgyzstan's 
industrial works, enterprises, agriculture, and transport. It 
says: Under the conditions of introducing market reforms and 
enterprises gaining their economic independence financial 
discipline has fallen down in the Republic and the number of 
economic crimes has increased. Ministries and departments are 
not exercising control over the preservation of state property. 
Embezzlement, misappropriation, and shortages are [word 
indistinct] widespread. This is the result of the shortcomings 
in the work of the city administrations. 
  With the aim of eliminating these shortcomings, the State 
Financial Inspectorate under the Government of Kyrgyzstan has 
been invested with powers to carry out regular checks of the 
interdepartmental financial control bodies, and the results of 
the checks are to be submitted for consideration by the 
government of the Republic.

  [Text] A treaty on the unification of the Belarusian and 
Russian monetary systems and the conditions for operating a 
common monetary system, including a package of related 
agreements, were signed in Moscow on 12 April. These documents 
provide that all credit and monetary policy in the common 
Russian-Belarusian zone will be determined by one body -- the 
Central Bank of Russia. This provision comes into conflict with 
the Belarusian Constitution, which entrusts the Belarusian 
National Bank with all functions of determining credit and 
monetary policy on Belarusian territory. This was pointed out by 
Belarusian National Bank Chairman Stanislaw Bahdankevich, who 
signed [as received] the mentioned treaty with appropriate 
remarks. In addition to him, the treaty was signed by Russian 
Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, as well as Prime 
Ministers Vyacheslaw Kebich and Viktor Chernomyrdin. According 
to V. Kebich, it is necessary to introduce appropriate 
amendments to the Belarusian Constitution and other legislative 
acts to make the final step toward unification. He believes 
that this can be done by means of a referendum. Most probably, 
this referendum can be held along with Belarusian presidential 
elections on 23 June. 
  Under the provisions of the Moscow documents, the 
unification 
of monetary systems will proceed in two stages. In particular, 
from 1 May 1994, trade customs duties will be lifted, the 
transit of Russian shipments through Belarus will be free of 
charge, and Russia will lease Belarusian facilities, which are 
occupied by Russian strategic forces, free of charge. 
  The second stage -- the actual exchange of Belarusian 
National Bank tenders for Russian rubles -- should be preceded 
by the Belarusian people expressing their political will 
regarding the unification of the two monetary systems. A 
one-to-one exchange rate will implemented with respect to every 
person for a sum not to exceed 200,000 Belarusian rubles in cash 
and 1 million Belarusian rubles in bank deposits and deposit 
certificates as of 1 April 1994. Belarusian rubles over the 
mentioned sum will be exchanged according to a rate determined 
by the national committees of statistics comparing baskets of 
consumer goods, as well as according to the cross-rate in 
dollars. With regard to legal entities, their assets and 
liabilities will be exchanged according to the cross-rate, as 
well. 
  Beginning from the time of the actual unification of the 
monetary systems of Belarus and Russia, trade between both 
countries will be implemented with the use of the mechanism for 
regulating prices, which is being used on the internal market. 
As of 1 July, Belarus will begin receiving credits valued at 
200 billion Russian rubles. 
  The bilateral agreements, which were signed at the same 
time, 
are an integral part of the treaty on monetary unification. 
They include an agreement on a single mechanism for controlling 
budget systems; an agreement on trade and economic relations in 
the first stage of monetary unification; and protocols on the 
introduction of single procedures and tariff regulations in 
trade, on a system of free trade without confiscations and 
restrictions, and on the conditions and procedures for using 
temporary restrictions in mutual trade. An agreement on certain 
conditions for maintaining military units and formations on 
Belarusian territory was also signed. 
  "We removed many obstacles which curbed relations between 
our 
countries," Viktor Chernomyrdin told journalists after the 
signing ceremony. The Russian prime minister emphasized that it 
is the first time two states within the CIS economic union have 
achieved such a close level of cooperation.

<F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report under the "Document" rubric: "Law </F>
on Electoral Rights To Be Passed to President One of These Days. 
Central Electoral Commission Expects To Push it Though State 
Duma Before Summer Recess"] 
  [Text] Nikolay Ryabov, chairman of the Central Electoral 
Commission [CEC], has said that one of these days he will submit 
to the president the draft law "On the Main Guarantees of the 
Electoral Rights of Russian Federation Citizens," drawn up by 
CEC experts. The document will reaffirm the "framework" 
provisions regulating the conduct of elections, which under the 
new Constitution should be "specified" in local election 
statutes in each Federation component. The CEC chief recalled 
that in the absence of "federal legal guidelines" regional 
elections were held from December to April only on the basis of 
local enforceable enactments. The draft law, its authors say, 
will guarantee the right to appeal in court against the 
violation of electoral rights, a right which was not set forth 
in some local "electoral codes." This version, however, also 
merely mentions the responsibility of violators, but lacks a 
specific mechanism of punishing them. What Nikolay Ryabov sees 
as the "key" provision of the new law is the solution to the 
question of the Central Electoral Commission's funding: 
according to the draft, a separate line in the government 
budget will be introduced to finance the CEC. Ryabov explained 
that "the government has suggested that it itself should give us 
money, as it gives it to any ministry, but we refused, seeing 
this as a matter decisive for the commission's independence." 
  CEC members will be appointed by all branches of power: the 
CEC chairman, by the president; his deputy and six commission 
members, by the Federation Council; and the CEC secretary and 
the other six members, by the State Duma. Local electoral 
commissions will be formed under the new law "on a parity basis" 
by regional representative and executive branches of power. 
  The draft stipulates "equal terms" and "equal rights" in the 
nomination of candidates by electoral associations. The term 
"electoral association" itself is defined in the draft as "a 
public association, the charter of which envisions participation 
in elections, created and registered in accordance with law not 
later than six months before the announced date of the 
respective elections." 
  "Independent" candidates will be required under a provision 
of the draft law to state their party affiliation publicly. 
According to Mr. Ryabov, this was done taking into account the 
lessons of the recent local elections "so as activists of a 
certain hue, who have already been branded three times, will no 
longer be able to pass for lambs." 
  The final draft of the law will be presented today to the 
roundtable at the Central Electoral Commission, to which State 
Duma and Federation Council deputies, leaders of political 
parties, and influential public figures have been invited. 
  According to Aleksandr Ivanchenko, deputy chairman of the 
Central Electoral Commission, the draft was approved in general 
by senior officials at the presidential administration. Nikolay 
Ryabov hopes that the president himself will also approve the 
document and will sponsor it at the State Duma as his own 
legislative initiative. Afterward, the CEC chief thinks, the 
State Duma will have to pass the law "On the Main Guarantees of 
the Electoral Rights of Russian Federation Citizens" even before 
its summer recess.

  [Text] TALLINN, Apr 13, BNS -- Maj. Aare Evisalu, chief of 
control center, and Maj. Edgar Aaro, head of service department 
of the Estonian border guard, met today with Gen. Viktor 
Kostenko, commander of Russian border guard's Pskov unit, to 
discuss the strengthening of border regime on the temporary 
borderline between the two countries and the issue of illegal 
immigrants, including Kurds. 
  Evisalu told BNS the two parties agreed in principle on 
simplifying border crossing regulations for the people living on 
both sides of the southeast Estonian border. 
  "We didn't sign any documents, since the decision officially 
rests with the Estonian and the Russian governments," Evisalu 
said. 
  Officials from the Narva cordon of the Estonian border guard 
and Russia's Ivangorod cordon continue tomorrow talks to resolve 
the fate of the Kurds detained in Estonia. 
  "Kostenko agreed that the return of the Kurds to Russia 
should be solved at border guard, not foreign ministry, level," 
the Estonian officer said. 
  Today's meeting also touched on the April 1 incident when 
two 
unidentified Russian-speaking assailants killed one and wounded 
two Russian border guards near the Pechory railway station on 
the Russian side of the border. 
  "I asked Kostenko about his opinion on an article in the 
April 5 issue of the Russian IZVESTIA newspaper, which claimed 
that the assailants came from and fled to Estonia," Evisalu told 
BNS. "Kostenko said it was one of the (Russian side's) working 
hypotheses, which facts haven't corroborated so far, and that 
the article was a piece of journalistic fantasy."

<F P=106> [Address to nation by Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev; </F>
place not given--live, broadcast in progress] 
  [Text] Vladimir Kazimirov [Russian envoy to the Karabakh 
talks] visited Baku and held talks with us and presented a new 
draft agreement to us. After discussing this draft, we gave our 
own proposals and views and indicated that in principle we are 
inclined to sign such an agreement, provided that our proposals 
and conditions are accepted. After that Kazimirov was to visit 
Yerevan and hold talks there. We are still waiting for the 
result of these talks. 
  Despite all this, Armenia's armed forces have resumed 
attacks 
on our positions and on Azerbaijani territory in recent days. A 
large Armenian force heavily attacked Geranboyskiy 
[Shaumyanovskiy] Rayon early on the morning of 10 April, and 
attempted to take Gulistan and Talish. Bloody battles took 
place. Azerbaijani Army units gave them a deserving reply. In 
this clash both the Armenian side and our armed forces suffered 
casualties. Though the Armenian Armed Forces managed to occupy 
a few heights there, they failed to achieve their objective. 
Battles have been continuing in that sector since yesterday. 
  Armenia's armed forces launched powerful attacks in two 
directions early yesterday morning -- one in Agdere 
[Mardakertskiy] Rayon and the other in Agdamskiy Rayon. They 
tried to occupy Matagis and Hakobgamari in Agdere. They also 
launched three powerful successive attacks in Agdamskiy Rayon 
yesterday. As is known, the city of Agdam is under Armenian 
occupation, but our armed forces control a part of the rayon, 
and our citizens are living in the towns there. These cities 
were also subjected to shelling and the military headquarters 
there came under fire. Despite all this, our armed forces gave 
a deserving reply to the Armenian Armed Forces on this front 
too. The fighting is continuing, and will probably continue all 
day. In fact, having reinforced its forces, the Armenians 
resumed their attacks in these directions and in Geranboyskiy 
Rayon. 
  This marks a new stage in Armenia's aggression. It appears 
that having taken advantage of the recent cease-fire, the 
Armenian Armed Forces have regrouped and have brought in forces 
from every corner of Armenia -- and I can state this with utmost 
certainty -- to this region and are launching attacks. This 
shows they have not ceased their aggressive actions, but 
continue striving to seize additional Azerbaijani territory in 
pursuit of their occupationist aims. 
  I am pleased to inform the Azerbaijani citizens that 
Azerbaijani Army units are waging bloody battles on all these 
fronts, strongly resisting the enemy, dealing powerful blows to 
the Armenian Armed Forces, and reliably defending their own 
positions. For example, the powerful three-pronged attacks in 
Agdamskiy Rayon yesterday were checked. Our fighters were 
martyred there; 21 were martyred, and 46 were wounded. Twelve 
of the martyrs were from the battalion formed in Sumgait. The 
battalion commander Elmar Edilov, a resident of Agdam who has 
been fighting there for the last two years, died heroically, and 
the deputy commander was gravely wounded. Undaunted by this our 
Army units, were continuing to counter the Armenian attacks, and 
defend their positions. 
  About 23 or 24 were killed or wounded in Agdere region, and 
there are also casualties in Geranboyskiy Rayon. 
  As I address all Azerbaijani citizens today, I bow my head 
to 
honor the heroism of our sons and fellow citizens who heroically 
died in recent days while defending their homeland, and giving a 
deserving reply to the enemy. I express my condolences to the 
families of all the Azerbaijani sons martyred for the homeland. 
The martyrs' heroism will forever live in our hearts. May God 
bless their souls. 
  During the bloody battles over the past three days, 
Azerbaijan's heroic fighters and armed groups have inflicted 
major blows to the Armenian armed formations that have launched 
a new offensive against the Azerbaijani territory. Now, I do 
not want to cite detailed figures, and there is no need to do 
so. However, the Azerbaijani citizens should know that in those 
regions -- and I already gave our side's losses -- the Armenian 
Armed Forces' losses are much greater than ours, both in terms 
of men and material. For example, during the fighting in 
Agdamskiy Rayon yesterday, four Armenian tanks and a number of 
infantry fighting vehicles were destroyed, and they lost many 
military vehicles in other regions as well. Their casualties 
were particularly high, including officers. We know this for a 
fact. 
  I want to emphasize that while dying for the homeland, our 
soldiers, officers, and fighters are also inflicting powerful 
blows to the enemy. Before I came to the television studio 
today, I contacted the fronts, and our soldiers and commanders 
informed me that they are firmly defending our positions, and 
are repulsing the enemy, and assured me that they will not 
surrender any territory to them. However, the fighting 
continues, and I expect the Armenian Armed Forces to make a 
major redeployment of forces from all over Armenia to our 
fronts, after which they will resume their attacks. 
  We are experiencing a serious situation. However, these 
grave days have become normal under the present conditions. 
Azerbaijani territory has been the victim of Armenian 
aggression for the last six years, and we have no other 
alternative. As I said at the beginning of my statement, our 
real aim is to put an end to the war through peaceful means. 
Regrettably the Armenian Armed Forces, the Armenian aggressors, 
and the aggressive circles in Armenia are not willing to follow 
this path. When they are participating in peace talks they 
ostensibly claim to favor peace; but, when it comes to action, 
they again reveal their true faces, as in these past three days. 
  By television and radio, I now convey my sincere greetings 
to our fighters, soldiers, officers, and the all citizens at the 
front who are defending our lands. I congratulate them for 
standing firm in the defense of our land and express my 
gratitude to them. I want to say that I am sure that they will 
continue to reliably defend our lands and will give the Armenian 
Armed Forces the response they deserve, hit them hard, and 
prevent them from (?regrouping). 
  At the same time, an analysis of the present developments 
once again shows that we must further strengthen our defense 
against Armenian aggression. More attention must be paid to 
forming Army units. 
  As you know, during 9 to 11 April I visited all along the 
front, saw various units, and met with our soldiers, officers, 
and commanders. All of them are defending our territory with 
high morale. However, I also feel that there are shortcomings 
in our Army, which must be further strengthened and even better 
organized. Therefore, the entire population, all the citizens of 
Azerbaijan, and each person should work to further strengthen 
the Army. The events of the last three days once again show 
that we have no other alternative. 
  Therefore, today I am calling on all the Azerbaijani people: 
I want you all realize that our republic is in danger. Each 
person should do his part in strengthening the Army and of our 
defenses. From this point of view, the recent slackened Army 
call up seriously disturbs me, and I believe it will disturb 
every patriotic Azerbaijani. Of late there has been an increase 
in desertions. Desertion is treason against the people and 
homeland. Evading the mobilization is treason against the 
people and homeland. Therefore, I once again call on the 
deserters and draft dodgers to return to the true path. I want 
to tell them what they are doing will not benefit them. I want 
to tell the families and friends of the young deserters and 
draft dodgers: You too bear responsibility for the desertion of 
your sons and relatives. Azerbaijan is the homeland of all of 
us. Everybody, each citizen, must guard the homeland. When the 
soldiers and officers are standing guard at the fronts, bleeding 
and dying, those citizens who cannot go to the fronts must 
contribute at their own work places and should send their 
eligible sons, grandsons, and brothers to the fronts. They must 
send them to serve in the Army; there is no other alternative, 
there can be no other way. 
  Therefore, I once again call on the Azerbaijani citizens and 
people: Come, let us all join forces and rise in defense of the 
motherland. Let no one think that if the Armenian Armed Forces 
again achieve victory and advance in some region it will benefit 
anyone. It will bring no benefits to anyone. It will only be a 
new blow to the Azerbaijani people; it will be another blow to 
the Azerbaijan Republic and its independence. Let no one think 
that he is absolved of this responsibility, or that he will 
attain his personal goals with such a defeat. No. God will 
(?punish) them. I trust in our people's common sense and I 
appeal to them in the hope that each Azerbaijani, each citizen, 
will arise and follow our just path and refrain from taking the 
path of treason against the people, the path of worsening 
Azerbaijan's present grave situation. 
  I hope that the majority of our citizens, the Azerbaijani 
people, stand and will continue to stand fast in defense of the 
homeland. I want to assure our people that our army, our 
soldiers, officers, and fighters at the front are reliably 
defending our lands and that the current Armenian attacks will 
be repulsed. 
  In this regard I want to address recent rumors. As you 
know, rumors as such are not worthy of my attention. However, 
sometimes a rumor spread by one person creates confusion in 
society and harms our work. In connection with recent 
developments, there are rumors that the Armenian Armed Forces 
are going to capture this or that place and that people should 
flee from such places, from Terter, for instance; or that 
incidents will take place in Ganja. These rumors only serve the 
enemy, and those responsible for them are the enemies of the 
Azerbaijani people and traitors. 
  Let them know that their efforts are in vain. Our people are 
now aware. Regrettably, there are even some officials 
circulating such rumors. They disgust me, and I hope that our 
people feel the same. I want to assure the people that no one 
should worry, for our land is being reliably defended, and the 
Armenian attacks are being repulsed. Let no one worry, let no 
one leave his post. 
  In connection with recent developments, I also call on the 
Azerbaijani citizens of Armenian origin living in Daghlyk 
[Nagorno]-Karabakh. They are citizens of the Azerbaijani 
Republic; they cannot be citizens of another republic or state, 
because they are living on Azerbaijani territory. I believe 
that most of them are now experiencing great hardships. 
  The Armenian soldiers taken prisoner during recent fighting, 
and even during their previous blitz, have revealed during 
interrogation that they are being brought to the front by force 
-- they push them under duress, they force them to fight. We 
even found out that when they try to retreat, they are punished 
and shot in the back; they are forced to fight at gun point. 
What these prisoners say shows that the soldiers from 
Daghlyk-Karabakh, and most of the Armenian ones too, are brought 
here by force. For example, an Armenian soldier taken prisoner 
in Geranboyskiy Rayon yesterday said that most of their troops 
had been released from prison. These convicts were released and 
told if they obeyed orders they would be pardoned. Even the 
people coming from Yerevan, Leninakan [Gyumri], and Edzhmiatsin, 
and other regions of Armenia indicate that they were forced to 
come here. This is learned from POW statements. 
  However, I am specifically addressing the Armenians living 
in Daghlyk-Karabakh who are citizens of Azerbaijan. You should 
realize that you too have been in a bad situation for the last 
six years. You too are tormented, and have suffered many 
losses. Your houses and cities have been destroyed and your 
living conditions have deteriorated beyond belief. What is it 
that you want? You too are being killed in this fighting and 
are sustaining losses. Yet, what have you achieved by this? 
For the last six years, the aggressive and nationalist circles 
have dragged you, Azerbaijani citizens, you residents of 
Daghlyk-Karabakh, into a futureless war. You and the 
Azerbaijanis who used to live in Daghlyk-Karabakh, as well as 
the Azerbaijanis who are still living around you in Azerbaijan, 
lived in friendship and happiness for scores of years. You 
Armenians who have settled in Daghlyk-Karabakh have been there 
for the past 150 years. Leaving aside a few conflicts during 
that period, you have always lived with the Azerbaijanis under 
friendly and happy conditions. Why was such an existence not 
good enough for you? Why this? Why this bloodshed? Why do you 
prefer these losses and destruction? Why? Wake up. Realize 
that there is no end to this war. The aggressive circles will 
not be able to achieve their objectives, or attain their goals. 
The Azerbaijani Republic will never give up its own territory. 
It is not yet too late to cut the losses in half. There is 
still a chance. It is not too late; renounce this path; pull 
out of this fight; pull out of this war; and I assure you we 
will continue to protect you as Azerbaijani citizens, as our own 
citizens. Your rights will be protected. We will create all 
the necessary conditions for you to live in safety. 
  I also call on the citizens of the Armenian Republic, the 
Armenian people, their leaders, on Armenian President Levon Ter- 
Petrosyan, the Armenian political parties and their leaders. I 
want to inform them that this aggressive policy can lead to no 
end. You should renounce it. There is no need for us to prove 
that this war was started by Armenia's aggressive and 
nationalistic circles and will bring no benefits to the people 
of Armenia. The Armenian people have also been suffering for 
the last six years. What do we need this for? 
  I tried to telephone Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan 
yesterday and today, but it was not possible; therefore, I am 
addressing him on television: I call on him to act responsibly, 
I am calling on all the Armenian leaders to act responsibly for 
the sake of their own people. In recent fighting, several 
hundred Armenian troops died or were wounded. Armenia's 
aggressive circles, the circles continuing this war, are 
responsible for the deaths of their own citizens. They are 
shedding this blood, and there is no end to it. I want to state 
sincerely that we want to put an end to this war. We want to 
make use of all the opportunities to conduct talks. However, on 
one condition: The Armenian aggressors, the Armed Forces must 
leave the Azerbaijani lands, the Azerbaijan Republic's 
territorial integrity must be guaranteed, and the inviolability 
of the Azerbaijan Republic must be ensured. 
  Therefore, having analyzed the results of the past three 
days, I reiterate that we are for peace, not because such 
aggression and attacks frighten us, but because we do not want 
bloodshed. 
  It is known to the world that the Azerbaijani Republic is 
suffering from Armenian aggression, that more than 20 percent of 
our territory is occupied by Armenian Armed Forces. Therefore, 
we are not the occupiers, we are merely waging a just war and 
are defending our own territory, citizens and homeland. 
  In calling upon the world community, international 
organizations, the UN, its Security Council and the leaders of 
the United States, England, France, Russia, China -- who are 
permanent members of the Security Council -- I call on them to 
take effective measures to stop the Armenian aggression. 
  We have accepted the Russian mediation initiative and tried 
to benefit from this initiative, but regrettably, despite months 
of talks, no results have been achieved. I hope that a great 
country like Russia -- which has close friendly relations with 
both Azerbaijan and Armenia, a state with great worldwide 
influence, a member of the UN Security Council -- will play its 
role in this region. 
  I also call on the CSCE and members of the Minsk Group to 
be more active. I call upon Azerbaijan's neighboring states, 
namely Turkey, Iran, and Georgia: I believe that being 
neighbors with both Azerbaijan and Armenia, they should not 
remain on the sidelines of this conflict and should make more 
effective use of their own possibilities to put an end to this 
war. 
  I also want to point out that the timing of the Armenian 
Armed Forces' attacks against Azerbaijani territory and our 
military positions for the past three days is not a mere 
coincidence. Some time ago--perhaps a month ago--the CSCE Minsk 
Group's new chairman, Ian Eliason, came to Azerbaijan and 
Armenia with a large delegation and held talks on the need to 
further strengthen the Minsk Group. 
  Minsk Group's debates on Daghlyk-Karabakh resumed in Prague 
on 11 April--that is, yesterday. And at this very time, when 
the representatives of Azerbaijan and Armenia are taking part in 
that session, the Armenian Armed Forces have launched this 
strong attack. As you know, the press reported that the CIS 
leaders will meet in Moscow from 14 to 15 April. Important 
issues will be discussed there. The Armenian attacks on 
Azerbaijan on the eve of this meeting have certain aims. It 
may be that with these attacks they want to pressure the 
Azerbaijani Republic and its leadership. This in vain; no one 
can pressure us. We have defended and will continue to defend 
Azerbaijan's independence. We have fought for our independence 
at all costs. We have also become a member of the CIS. We were 
greatly saddened when the Armenian attack began, even though we 
are a member of the CIS and were getting ready to go to Moscow. 
  Taking all these things into consideration, I also appeal to 
the CIS and its leaders, declaring once again that there should 
be no more war between CIS member countries, for such a thing is 
abnormal and it must cease. I particularly address Russia, 
which has a special and influential place in the CIS, and 
Russia's leaders: An end must be put these events. Russia has 
the means to peacefully resolve these problems. I hope that they 
will make use of these means, as they should. 
  I hope that my calls will not go unnoticed, and will be duly 
received by the international community. With trust and 
confidence in the international community, international 
organizations and international norms, I am conveying my views 
to them through television and radio. 
  To once again refer to the domestic life of our own republic 
I once again call on all Azerbaijani citizens, political groups 
and forces: I want to state that everyone should serve one 
objective during these grave days for our republic: to ensure 
the security of the Azerbaijani Republic, help it to survive the 
present grave war situation, and guarantee its territorial 
integrity. We must all unite on this path, and walk together 
along this path. If anyone tries to take advantage of this 
grave situation for their own loathsome purposes they should 
realize that they are bound to fail. There are such forces in 
Azerbaijan; and such intentions are also fostered by forces 
outside Azerbaijan, which are now active. They all should 
realize that they will not be able to attain their loathsome 
objectives. 
  I trust in the Azerbaijani people's (?maturity), 
(?alertness), and bravery; and I am sure that we will 
successfully overcome these trials and will defend our land and 
give a fitting response to all the aggressive forces. 
  I again call on our soldiers, officers, and fighters at the 
front: You are defending your homeland and native soil. You 
are serving sacred goals. Your service will always be 
appreciated by the people, society, and state. 
  Because a part of my statement was addressed to neighboring 
countries, I will now repeat the gist of my statement in 
Russian. This is because I want the leaders of these states to 
hear this from me in person today.

  [Text] Meeting (?Umberto Pestalozzi), Italian ambassador to 
Latvia, Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs today said that on 12 
April Latvia asked the Vienna Forum of the CSCE in Europe to 
consider the new situation in Latvian-Russian relations, which 
has come about in connection with Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's order of 5 April. Birkavs stressed that the Latvian 
side will be prepared to resume further talks on the signing of 
the treaty on the Russian Army withdrawal and agreements related 
to it only when an official confirmation of the cancellation of 
the order is received from the Russian president. 
  Latvia will also insist for the agreement on social 
guarantees for discharged Russian military personnel to be 
supplemented with a (?clause) on the conditions for a voluntary 
repatriation of such people. It is planned to set up a special 
fund to finance the repatriation. Latvia, Russia, and third 
countries will be able to participate in this fund. Latvia will 
control the fund's money. 
  Birkavs has called on (?Pestalozzi), as a representative of 
a 
country which is holding the CSCE Presidency, with an appeal to 
support the repatriation of discharged military personnel, help 
rehabilitate the Skrunda area, and to send CSCE representatives 
to observe the work of the Skrunda facility.

  [Text] A briefing in the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry told 
journalists Kiev's official position regarding the events in 
Odessa. The press were informed that yesterday consultations 
were held behind closed doors between Admiral Feliks Gromov and 
Russian Special Envoy Yuriy Dubinin on the one hand and 
Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk on the other. 
Judging from the fact that those involved in the consultations 
did not wish to see the press any nearer than a bullet shot 
away, no particular progress was achieved. In an exclusive 
interview for the Today program, the Ukrainian foreign minister, 
Anatoliy Zlenko, added that: 
  [Begin Zlenko recording] Everything that is going on around 
the Black Sea Fleet is not controlled -- we have just been 
convinced of this on the basis of the event that took place in 
Odessa. I think that if we are able to find a solution to the 
Black Sea Fleet problem in the near future, we need to find a 
solution for the Black Sea Fleet on the basis of mutual 
interests and not approach a solution in a unilateral manner.

  [Text] President of the Crimean Autonomous Republic Yuriy 
Meshkov subjected the decision by the Ukrainian president to 
create the institution of Ukrainian presidential representative 
in the Crimea to sharp criticism. In his televised speech, 
Meshkov called the Ukrainian Government "the most dangerous in 
Europe." He pointed out that the appointment of such a 
representative is a political provocation, which may do harm to 
the development of the democratic process on the peninsula. 
This was reported by the BBC.

Anatoliy Krasnov] 
  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- "We are getting the 
impression that our partners in the West, especially in NATO, 
have not found the correct solutions yet", announced Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in response to journalists' 
questions about NATO's decision to bomb Serbian positions. 
  Kozyrev announced that Russia intends to sign the 
Partnership 
for Peace initiative, but has not yet determined the appropriate 
date. "We are interested in a much more serious approach, not in 
just discussing some framework document. We also have proposals 
worked out by the Russian Foreign and Defence Ministries, but we 
are interested in much more serious relations, which would rule 
out surprises and unilateral measures, especially military ones, 
in those areas where we should be cooperating most closely", the 
foreign minister said. 
  "It seems that my last conversations with the American 
secretary of state and the British foreign secretary, and 
especially today's talk with French Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Alain Juppe, allow us to hope that both sides will learn their 
lessons from the recent events", Kozyrev said. "And we really 
are thinking over a more serious and substantial format for 
relations with NATO". 
  The Russian foreign minister was speaking on Thursday at a 
briefing for foreign and Russian journalists on the results of 
talks with Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who is now in 
Moscow on an official visit.

<F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report under the "Lessons" rubric: </F>
"Officials and Directors in the Lead in Local Elections. 
`Independent Candidates' Would be Obliged To Disclose Party 
Affiliation"] 
  [Text] It was announced at yesterday's sitting of the 
Central Electoral Commission that the elections for local organs 
of representative power had taken place in 69 regions of Russia. 
In 61 regions, they are recognized as having taken place, and 
in 19 regions local parliaments have already been fully formed. 
Elections in another 11 regions and "by-elections" for 50 
organs of power in the regions are to take place before the year 
is out. 
  According to Central Electoral Commission information, 31.7 
percent of the seats won belong to representatives of the 
executive power, 21 percent to directors of industrial 
enterprises, and more than 10 percent to "people prominent in 
agriculture." Nearly 10 percent of the seats have been won by 
white collar workers, journalists, etc. Lawyers have won as 
little as 2.5 percent of all seats. 
  According to Nikolay Ryabov, the "Russia's Choice" bloc is 
in 
the lead for those elected from party lists (22 percent), 
trailed by the Communist Party (14 percent of the votes) and the 
Agrarian Party (7 percent). In the overwhelming majority of 
Federation components, however, deputies were elected in 
accordance with the majority system. According to officials of 
the Central Electoral Commission, "as little as 14 percent of 
candidates were nominated by electoral blocs, even fewer were 
registered, and still fewer were elected." Nikolay Ryabov did 
not deny media information that Communists posing as 
"independent candidates" were in the lead among the remaining 80 
to 85 percent of the candidates. "In fact, when they describe 
themselves as independent, it is often hard for the voters to 
see who they really are," the Electoral Commission chairman 
complained in an interview for your SEGODNYA correspondent. He 
advised that the draft law "On the Fundamental Guarantees of 
Voting Rights of Russian Federation Citizens" contains a 
provision making it mandatory for all candidates to indicate 
their party affiliation "so as the voters will have no doubt." 
  The draft law, constituting "framework" norms for regional 
election statutes, will soon be submitted to Boris Yeltsin and 
forwarded to the Public Chamber under the president. Next, Mr. 
Ryabov hopes, the president will introduce a corresponding 
"legislative initiative" to the State Duma, and the lower 
chamber would look at it before its summer recess.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ilya Grinchenko, chairman of the kray </F>
organizational committee of the Russia's Choice Movement, by 
Vitaliy Mogil; place and date not given: "Orientation Points of 
the New Party: Maritime Kray Gaydar Supporters Plan To Defend 
Civic Peace and the Interests of the Residents of the Kray"] 
  [Text] A long time ago journalists used to "pester" the 
leader of Russia's Choice, Ye. Gaydar, with the question: Are 
you not planning to transform this bloc of yours into a party? 
Yegor Timurovich never ruled out such a possibility. And so, 
it has happened--Russia's Choice will create a party. Supporters 
were found for it here in Maritime Kray. Our KRASNOYE ZNAMYA 
correspondent met with Ilya Grinchenko, chairman of the kray 
organizational committee of the Russia's Choice Movement. 
  [Mogil] Ilya Konstantinovich, the political announcement on 
the creation of a party, which was published in ARGUMENTY I 
FAKTY and signed by its leaders, states that the party is being 
created as a counterweight to the threat of a nomenklatura 
revanche and the accession to power of national-extremists. 
Does such a threat also exist in Maritime Kray? 
  [Grinchenko] Maritime Kray is still not a separate republic. 
But in Russia such a danger is viewed as obvious, and this means 
that our kray is also not secure from it. But even this is not 
the main reason for the creation of a party. Russia's Choice 
will fight not against, but for. For a free society where human 
rights are the highest priority, for stability, for an effective 
state, and for civic peace. 
  [Mogil] The establishment of civic peace and the creation of 
a free society, it must be assumed, are a program maximum. But 
the minimum? 
  [Grinchenko] For Maritime Kray supporters of People's 
Choice, this is a struggle for authority in all representative 
organs in order to defend the interests of the residents of our 
kray. 
  [Mogil] Can we also expect your candidates in the 
forthcoming elections to the kray Duma? 
  [Grinchenko] We have supporters among already nominated 
candidates for deputy. But if the Statute on Elections is 
revised and the opportunity appears to nominate new candidates, 
then we will do this. 
  [Mogil] Who was the initiator for the creation of the party 
in Maritime Kray? 
  [Grinchenko] The slogans under which the new party is being 
created found support among members of the Democrat Club--people 
of a different political orientation. Among them are 
social-democrats, supporters of the Russia's Choice Movement, 
and people with no party affiliation. 
  [Mogil] Will they all now become Gaydarites? 
  [Grinchenko] The party has not yet been formed structurally. 
Its constituent assembly is planned for the end of May. Until 
that time it will be necessary to consider the draft charter and 
a political statement. After the congress, party supporters 
will be able to formulate their attitude toward the documents 
developed by it at constituent meetings in the localities. 
Moreover, participation in the activity of the Russia's Choice 
Movement is not limited to party membership. 
  [Mogil] The party has just been formed, but it has already 
actively joined the political life of the kray... 
  [Grinchenko] Yes. On behalf of the kray organizational 
conference of the Russia's Choice Movement, an appeal has been 
sent to the governor of Maritime Kray with a proposal to form a 
kray public chamber (as a consultative representational organ 
under the kray administration) consisting of registered 
candidates for deputy for the period before the election of the 
kray Duma. We think that this could become the first step in 
the establishment of civic peace and accord in Maritime Kray, 
and we declare our readiness to render support in the 
implementation of our proposal.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The press service of 
the Russian State Duma has released the full text of a statement 
by the Russian Federation State Duma in connection with events 
in Bosnia- Herzegovina. Below is the full text of the statement: 
<H5>  Statement by the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the </H5>
Russian Federation 
  Deputies of the State Duma express deep alarm in connection 
with the news of the air strikes in the area of Gorazde in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. In spite of the position of Russian members 
of parliament, which has been expressed more than once in 
official documents and deputies' speeches on the danger of using 
military force in solving the conflict, a decision was adopted 
to utilize military aviation, and furthermore without 
preliminary consultations with Russia and other members of the 
UN Security Council. 
  The use of NATO aviation has led to fresh casualties among 
the Bosnian civilian population and has dealt a significant blow 
to efforts aimed at solving the conflict by peaceful means. 
  The worsening of the situation in the area of Gorazde 
testifies to serious inadequacies in the mechanism for adopting 
and implementing decisions during the implementation of UN 
peacekeeping operations. Peacekeeping operations should not be 
used for the implementation of military actions on a bloc basis. 
  We are extremely concerned by NATO's continuing policy of 
using force as a means for solving the conflict in the former 
Yugoslavia. In light of what has happened the State Duma: 
  1. Condemns unilateral NATO acts of force in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  2. Demands the immediate convening of the UN Security 
Council to discuss the situation that has arisen as a result of 
NATO's military interference in the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and to take measures to avert an escalation 
of this explosive situation. 
  3. Calls on all the warring sides to end immediately the 
bloodshed and to open negotiations on a total cease-fire. 
  4. Deems it essential that UN forces be urgently deployed 
in the vicinity of Gorazde and that every measure be undertaken 
to prevent provocations by any of the sides. 
  5. Demands that the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry 
elaborates an active position on the creation of effective 
machinery for the implementation of UN Security Council 
resolutions so as to prevent in future the adoption of forcible 
measures without the opinion of Russia being taken into account. 
  6. Recommends that the State Duma Committee on 
International Affairs, the State Duma Committee on Defense, the 
State Duma Committee on Geopolitical Issues and the State Duma 
Committee on Security submit proposals that take Russia's 
interests fully into account in the elaboration of the position 
of the State Duma on the concept for Russia's interaction with 
NATO.

  [Text] Chairman of the State Duma's Committee on CIS 
Affairs and Relations with Russians outside Russia, Konstantin 
Zatulin, believes that the State Duma must adopt a federal law 
stating that the agreement on Russia's joining NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program must be subject to ratification by 
the State Duma. Adoption of such a law was initiated on 
Wednesday by Chairman of the State Duma's Committee on 
Legislation and Judicial Reform, Vladimir Isakov. 
  Zatulin said the majority of State Duma deputies supported 
the idea. He announced that all participants in the hearings 
agreed that given the present situation of "civil discord" the 
NATO program should not be joined in a hurry. "Deputies were 
dissatisfied with the fact that the program did not provide for 
a special status for Russia and that the NATO members had taken 
a tough stand saying that Russia did not differ from any other 
participant in the program," Zatulin stressed. 
  Zatulin was certain that the CIS states must work out a 
single position on joining to the NATO program. He expected 
that the CIS summit planned for April 15 would discuss the 
issue. Zatulin said the CIS states must work out a new defense 
doctrine taking into consideration that all the relics of the 
Cold War must disappear, referring not only to the Warsaw Pact 
but also NATO.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS Observer Tatyana Zamyatina "especially </F>
for IZVESTIYA": "Ivan Rybkin: Magnanimity Discourages 
Opponents"] 
  [Text] Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma, considers 
the latter's inclination to seek accord among all the branches 
of power to be the main result of the first 100 days of the 
lower chamber of the Russian parliament's activity. At a 
meeting with chief editors of the Russian mass media at the 
ITAR-TASS news agency on 12 April he came across as a person who 
is open for discussion, independent, but complex. 
  Ivan Rybkin acknowledged that he still has differences of 
opinion with Sergey Filatov, leader of the President's 
Aministration, on the question of social guarantees for former 
Russian Federation people's deputies. "Filatov and I spent four 
hours discussing this problem until midnight last night," Ivan 
Rybkin said. 
  As is well known, in accordance with the president's edict 
of 
6 October 1993, Sergey Filatov and the commission headed by 
former Russian Federation deputy Aleksey Surkov drew up a list 
of 151 people's elected representatives of the previous 
parliament who have been denied the one-off monetary grant 
equivalent to a year's salary based on their monthly salary at 
the time their deputies' powers ceased. This is equivalent to 
approximately 3-4 million rubles per person, to be allocated, of 
course, from the state budget. The question of transferring to 
the ownership of those deputies Moscow apartments previously 
allocated to them for the duration of their term in the former 
Supreme Soviet remains in dispute. In an interview with your 
ITAR-TASS observer, Sergey Filatov noted that the housing 
question will be resolved on an individual basis. Meanwhile, as 
Filatov said, "Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov is not the kind of man 
who would give municipal apartments away to anyone free of 
charge," apartments worth $60,000-$70,000 each at market rates. 
"Otherwise it will be hard to explain to Muscovites why we are 
retaining housing in the capital for people who instigated civil 
war," Sergey Filatov believes. 
  Unlike Filatov, Ivan Rybkin believes that "magnanimity 
discourages one's opponents." In his opinion, the transfer of 
Moscow apartments to the former Russian Federation deputies 
"will not result in great losses, and if we are concerned about 
civil peace this measure must be taken." 
  Moving on to an assessment of the past three months of the 
Duma's activity, Ivan Rybkin noted that "the chamber has not 
accepted the implementation of the principle of a formal 
majority in decisionmaking," and added that in Russian history 
it was often the minority which was in the right. In 
establishing the structure of the chamber the deputies have 
managed to give the Duma the status of a mini-parliament in 
which every draft law is "tested out first," which significantly 
eases the voting procedure, the speaker noted. 
  As an illustration he cited the voting on the set of amnesty 
decisions and put forward the paradoxical thought with regard to 
the events of August 1991 and 3-4 October 1993 that "the idea of 
consigning things to oblivion is very important because without 
it there can be no progress toward the conclusion of the 
Agreement on Civil Peace."

<F P=106> [Olga Garbuzova report: "State Duma Plenary Meeting. </F>
Deputies Lacked a Mere Trifle To Conduct Effective Work"] 
  [Text] It turned out that only the absence of Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy can affect the course of law-making in Russia: 
Yesterday the State Duma's work was unprecedentedly effective. 
First of all, the deputies succeeded in their third attempt to 
pass the law on the status of deputies, in which the Liberal 
Democratic leader was particularly interested. In addition, the 
law "On the Procedure for Covering the Activity of Government 
Authorities in the State Mass Media" was adopted in the first 
reading. 
  The absence of the Liberal Democratic leader allowed the 
Duma 
to adopt a law regarding the status of a deputy without the 
imperative mandate, that is, one that would not give faction 
leaders the right to deprive a subordinate of a deputy's 
mandate, something Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had been persistently 
seeking. After a long break the State Duma approved a draft law 
on ways of dealing with the activity of state power authorities 
and state means of mass information. Under the draft, the press 
must publish materials by Russian Government authorities and 
Federation components under contracts to be financed by money 
from the budget. The money is considerable: If the law were 
already in force, newspapers and magazines would have been paid 
around 35 billion rubles for what they published in March. 
Radio and television will be less costly for the budget because 
semi-official reports will not be given that much air time. In a 
three-minute information program no more than 30 seconds can be 
devoted to the parliament. A program of more than 30 minutes is 
instructed to spend at least four minutes on Federal Assembly 
coverage. Information on the activity of government authorities 
should be reported as a separate block at the beginning of news 
programs without any comments. It was proposed that a deputy 
elected in a territorial district be given a chance to speak on 
regional radio and television once every two months for at least 
seven minutes. 
  When presenting the draft, Mikhail Poltoranin said that he 
would guarantee the equality of rights of all branches of power 
to distribute information on their activity. At the same time, 
there will no longer be any need in the "Parliamentary 
Hour"-style programs, he said. Although the deputies passed the 
law in the first reading, they did not appear to be entirely 
certain of "information equality." Literally several minutes 
later they passed a decree on setting up the State Duma's 
television service, which will prepare daily programs "on the 
activity of Russia's representative branch."

<F P=106> [Leonid Nikitinskiy report: "Constitutional Court's Stock </F>
Falls As Result of Political Trading"] 
  [Text] The uproar and dogfighting in the State Duma which 
marked the close of the past political week obscured an event 
which was actually of far greater significance: Parliament was 
unable to muster a qualified majority for the adoption of the 
Law on the Constitutional Court at its first reading. The 
dogfighting both in individual branches of power and between 
neighboring branches will continue without any rules and in the 
absence of an arbiter. 
  The Duma was making effectively its first attempt at 
legislative activity, its first encounter with the 
weightlifters' barbell which it has promised to lift, without 
which there is no sense in deputies even mounting the stage. 
And the fact that the first attempt was a total flop, or 
rather, did not get off the ground at all, unfortunately arouses 
serious apprehension regarding the legislative possibilities of 
the first post-Soviet parliament as a whole. 
  The draft law was prepared mainly by the judges of the 
Constitutional Court themselves, and since the judges have had 
not only positive experiences, but also negative ones (if not 
more of the latter), they endeavored to safeguard themselves 
against future political interference in the legal process. The 
corresponding provisions of the draft law were aimed not at 
depriving the Constitutional Court of all political competence, 
but at curbing the political games and intrigues around it. 
Alas, these games and intrigues have already resumed around the 
draft law itself, even at a distant remove from parliament 
itself. 
  The President's State-Legal Administration attempted to 
contest the Constitutional Court's right to initiate legislation 
on its own account. The president himself, according to Acting 
Constitutional Court Chairman Nikolay Vitruk, was extremely 
surprised at this, and instructed Aleksandr Yakovlev, his 
representative in parliament, to support the draft law. As a 
result some presidential structures officially defended the 
draft, but others scuppered it in the lobbies. It is hard to 
explain this by anything other than the battle for power and 
influence inside presidential structures. 
  Following the Duma Council's session on Thursday it became 
clear that it was highly unlikely that the hurdle of two-thirds 
of the votes necessary for the adoption of federal 
constitutional laws -- quantifiable as 300 votes -- would be 
cleared. Finally the display board flashed up the figures: 247 
votes for, 51 against, 87 abstentions. Those who voted against 
were mainly members of the communist faction, and the backbone 
of abstainers is formed by the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia. 
  The day before at the Duma Council Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
who 
despises all diplomatic contortions, stated perfectly frankly 
that he was ready to exchange the votes of his faction for an 
agreement on an imperative mandate. The imperative mandate was 
also in its own way one of last week's issues in the State Duma 
-- and, perhaps, will also be an issue this week too. According 
to the laws of the "standard [operativnyy] mandate," a deputy 
elected to parliament on a party roll cannot vote contrary to 
the opinion of the majority of his faction, on pain of being 
expelled not only from his faction, but also from deputies' 
ranks altogether. Obviously, for Vladimir Zhirinovskiy the 
desire to bind the breakaway members of his faction by 
imperative mandate (which does not meet with the support of the 
majority in parliament) is so overriding that it is impossible 
to understand in what relation he stands to the draft law on the 
Constitutional Court. 
  Overt political horse-trading is being conducted around this 
draft law. The communist faction and Zhirinovskiy's supporters 
are demanding some kind of State Duma quota in the appointment 
of judges, and also their own quota within this "Duma" quota. 
The Communists are also demanding that the Constitutional Court 
be restored its right to accept cases for examination on its own 
initiative, which was withdrawn from the draft, and without 
which it is not so effective in the capacity of a weapon in 
political brawling and blackmail. 
  Of course, it was easy to object from the Duma rostrum 
during 
the discussion of the draft law that all these amendments are 
anticonstitutional and require at the very least amendments to 
the Constitution that was approved in the referendum. On the 
other hand the Constititution does not forbid any deputy to push 
the voting button as he sees fit. As long as strictly legal 
questions are the issue, however complicated they may be, it is 
always possible to reach compromise -- this, in point of fact, 
is the task of the law. It is far more difficult to reach real 
accord in politics. 
  From the point of view of understanding of political 
factors, 
the draft law on the Constitutional Court was prepared and 
road-tested especially thoroughly. All factions pay at least 
lip service to the need for the Constitutional Court to resume 
its activity as soon as possibile. Questions are accumulating 
which no one has a right to answer except a Constitutional 
Court. Nevertheless, the draft law was defeated. Just as it 
will be in the event of its radical revision as demanded by 
"leftists," only this time by the factions of the opposite wing. 
  The inability to muster two-thirds of the votes on the most 
fundamental questions threatens the familiar paralysis in 
legislative development in the foreseeable future. Russia 
remains without a Constitutional Court, without a general 
prosecutor, without a "qualified majority" in its legislative 
organs, and, as a consequence, without Law. And once again it 
is political ambitions that are thwarting the normal legislative 
process.

  [Text] The Partnership for Peace program is an alternative 
to NATO's mechanical expansion. Participation in this program 
will strengthen the CIS position in NATO, Director of the 
All-European cooperation Department of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry Yuriy Ushakov declared on Thursday addressing the 
parliamentary hearings entitled The Partnership for Peace 
Program and the future of the CIS, held in the State Duma. 
  Ushakov pointed out that Russia "should actively break 
NATO's 
claims to having a monopoly on the solution to issues related to 
collective security" and it would be more efficient to do this 
"from inside, by joining NATO's program." He reminded that as 
many as 14 states had already signed the basic agreement on 
joining NATO's program, including Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia; 
Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are on the point of signing this 
document. 
  A spokesman of Russian Defense Ministry Major General Pavel 
Zolotarev, who also addressed the hearings, also spoke in favor 
of Russia joining NATO's program. He stressed that the Defense 
Ministry "views it as an interim stage on the way to the 
creation of collective security in Europe." 
  Zolotarev indicated that joining the program "does not mean 
any financial obligations on the part of Russia which will 
itself determine the dimensions of its participation." 
Zolotarev said that opponents of Russia's joining the 
Partnership for Peace program fear that NATO may render active 
pressure on Russia. Zolotarev believes that "mutual detente is 
always more efficient via cooperation than via confrontation." 
  "If Russia does not join NATO's program it will appear in 
self- isolation and NATO will actually receive access to Russian 
borders," emphasized Zolotarev. 
  Four committees of the State Duma which initiated the 
parliamentary hearings - the CIS affairs committee (chairman 
Konstantin Zatulin, Party of Russian Unity and Concord faction), 
security committee (chairman Viktor Ilyukhin, Communist Party 
faction), committee on geopolitics (chairman Viktor Ustinov, 
Liberal Democratic Party faction), and industry and transport 
committee (chairman Vladimir Gusev, the LDPR faction) adhere to 
the adverse point of view. 
  The working documents coordinated by these committees and 
distributed at the hearings point out that Partnership for Peace 
program has been practically announced as a "real alternative to 
the military-strategic partnership between the former USSR 
republics within the CIS, and this is a direct loss to Russia's 
national security."

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- As a result of consultations 
among delegation members and experts, the joint meeting of the 
Council of CIS Foreign Ministers managed to agree upon a draft 
declaration on sovereignty, territorial integrity and 
inviolability of borders of CIS member-countries. Insignificant 
differences were settled in the course of discussion. 
  The Armenian delegation is most likely to refrain from 
signing the declaration. 
  A draft convention for ensuring the rights of national 
minorities was subjected to more substantial criticism. 
Participants in the meeting decided to send the document for 
reconsideration by experts.

  [Text] The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) foreign 
ministers have once again failed to reach agreement on a draft 
convention on the rights of national minorities, Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev said. 
  "Unfortunately, the convention caused debates again. I hope 
they were motivated by the desire to improve the document. We 
are getting closer to the approval of the convention, although 
it is a painful and difficult process," he said after a meeting 
of CIS foreign ministers held in Moscow on Thursday. 
  Kozyrev said the convention was a "difficult political 
matter 
for some states." "It deals with the lives of millions of 
people, and therefore it's important here to evade mistakes, so 
we should feel relaxed about the postponement of the approval of 
the convention," he added. 
  But the meeting did approve a declaration of sovereignty, 
territorial integrity and inviolability of the borders of CIS 
countries, the Russian minister said. "It is a useful document 
giving the lie to the speculations that the CIS is some kind of 
neo-imperialist club," he said. 
  Meanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told 
Interfax the declaration had been opposed only by Armenia, 
which, he thought, might not sign it. "It proposed its own 
declaration, which it had the right to do," he said. 
  Kozyrev said positive decisions had been taken on all other 
matters, including collective security. 
  The ministers also approved a flag for the CIS, proposed by 
the Commonwealth's Interparliamentary Assembly, and recommended 
that Friday's CIS summit approve it too. 
  "That is not a national symbol. It doesn't have the same 
meaning as national flags do. It's something like the United 
Nations flag. It symbolizes humanitarian ideals, unity and 
common goals," Kozyrev said.

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- Azerbaijan is ready for 
reasonable compromises in settling the Armenian-Azeri conflict, 
but it will never put up with the occupation of its territories, 
Azeri President Geydar Aliyev said in an exclusive interview 
with TASS upon arriving in Moscow on Thursday to attend a CIS 
summit. 
  According to Aliyev, the republic's leadership is now 
thoroughly considering a new draft agreement set forth by Russia 
and designed to put an end to the conflict over the 
Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. Azerbaijan agrees in principle to this 
document but deems it necessary to amend it with due regard for 
the republic's remarks and proposals, the president said. "If 
the Armenian side agrees to them, the document will be signed", 
Aliyev announced. He expects to meet in Moscow with his 
Armenian counterpart Levon Ter-Petrosyan. 
  Speaking to newsmen at the Vnukovo airport, the Azeri leader 
expressed hope that "the present summit will help consolidate 
the CIS". Azerbaijan attaches great importance to mutual 
relations between CIS countries, which Aliyev believes should be 
discussed during the Moscow high-level meeting. We would like 
our Commonwealth to become more viable in all respects, the 
Azeri president stressed. 
  He is convinced that the CIS can also have its say in 
settling the Armenian-Azeri conflict, "it should not just look 
from aside at the continued bloodshed on Azeri land". 
  Aliyev described the current situation in the conflict zone 
as extremely grave. It became exacerbated following the fresh 
offensive launched by Armenian troops on four front segments a 
few days ago. The fighting resulted in huge casualties on both 
sides. The Azeri president believes it is high time the warring 
sides came to see reason. In this connection, he especially 
counts on assistance from the Commonwealth of Independent States.

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- On the eve of the CIS summit 
due to open on Friday, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord Sergey Shakhray called upon its participants to set up an 
international working group to draw up a draft agreement to 
create a confederation of Eurasian states. 
  Speaking in a radio programme of the international 
broadcasting company "Mir", Shakhray said, in particular, that 
it would be expedient to first build within the CIS a 
confederation of two or three states prepared for closer 
relations, according to a spokesman for the Russian Party of 
Unity and Accord. All countries entering the confederation will 
certainly preserve their political sovereignty, the party leader 
stressed. Among the the main spheres for integration he listed 
be economics, defence and foreign policy. [sentence as received] 
  Shakhray pointed to a substantial difference in legislations 
of former Soviet republics and suggested an effective mechanism 
to bring in line economic and other laws in the common interests 
of all states uniting into a confederation. Thus, he proposed 
drawing up detailed agreements in various spheres of economic 
activities, which, after being signed and ratified, be granted 
the status of international treaties superior to national 
legislation. This mechanism is much more effective that the 
usual parliamentary procedure, Shakhray believes. Furthermore, 
the legislative basis thus built would make it possible to 
surmount the difficulties caused by upset economic ties and to 
facilitate contacts among millions of people adding their voices 
to the call for political, economic and spiritual re-integration.

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- Despite current 
difficulties, all CIS states are moving ahead to establish their 
national armies, Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said. 
  Grachev believes there is a good chance of establishing 
united armed forces in the Commonwealth of Independent States by 
the end of the year. He admitted, however, that the pace of the 
process will largely depend on the economic situation in these 
states. 
  Speaking to journalists after a meeting of the CIS defence 
ministers in Moscow on Thursday, Grachev stressed that the 
establishment of united armed forces will enable CIS 
member-states to begin thinking about an Eurasian defence union, 
which, according to the minister, will be "much bigger than the 
Treaty of Collective Security." "Together we will hold 
defenses, arm ourselves and make military equipment," he said. 
  The meeting which was attended by 11 CIS defence leaders 
with 
the exception of Moldavian [Moldovan] minister focused on 
documents regulating the work of the secretariat of the 
collective Security Council and a declaration of states parties 
to the Treaty of Collective Security which outlines the basic 
principles of cooperation on security issues. The declaration 
will be submitted to the CIS leaders for signing on Friday. 
  Grachev who chaired the meeting said that the CIS presidents 
will discuss, among other matters, issues connected with 
additional measures to protect the Tajik-Afghan border and the 
status of collective peace-keeping forces in Tajikistan.

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- Turkmen President Saparmurad 
Niyazov has severely criticised the idea of establishing a 
Eurasian union, saying it is "doomed to failure." 
  Niyazov said the history which has repeatedly made the 
concept of such a union the subject of many discussions proves 
this point of view. "This idea has been repeatedly considered 
and rejected by the Russians as fatal for the nation since 
1861," Niyazov added. 
  It is not hard to predict the fate of another such idea, not 
a new one, which runs counter to the current processes of 
national revival in independent states, he said. 
  At the same time, he warned against dashing from one idea or 
proposal to another, because each may have a grain of common 
sense. 
  Haste and extremes are most dangerous for the Commonwealth 
of 
Independent States now, he said. 
  The Turkmen leader praised Russian-Turkmen relations, saying 
he consideres them as a priority in his policy.

  [Text] Moldovan President Mircea Snegur who has arrived in 
Moscow to participate in the CIS summit, hoped that the 
documents which were to be signed would give a new impulse to 
the development of economic relations between the CIS states. 
  Snegur spoke in favor of an agreement on mutual settlement 
in 
an interview with Interfax. "It is not normal when a country 
cannot settle its accounts with another country," Snegur 
stressed. 
  He also pointed out that Moldova was interested in signing 
another document concerning the human rights of ethnic 
minorities within the CIS. Snegur considered it a mutual 
commitment towards ethnic minorities in the CIS republics. 
Snegur said he had no worry about this issue in Moldova. He 
stated that all linguistic problems had been resolved and that 
Moldova had the most democratic law on citizenship (which 
automatically grants Moldovan citizenship to everyone living on 
its territory). 
  Commenting on Kazakhstan's initiative on the establishment 
of 
a Eurasian union, Snegur said he had not had enough time to 
examine it in detail. "If this means the establishment of a new 
structure similar to the CIS, it will be better to make the CIS 
work. The idea of the CIS itself is good, at least we need a 
single economic space. If Nazarbayev's proposal is a hidden 
attempt to reestablish the former Soviet Union, Moldova would 
not be in favor," Snegur stressed.

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- The working out of the 
common customs legislation for the CIS member states is one of 
the indispensable factors in the creation of common economic 
space within the CIS framework, the restoration of the disrupted 
economic ties, the improvement of the effectiveness of foreign 
economic activities and the consolidation of the new 
commonwealth, said Anatoliy Kruglov, chairman of the Russian 
State Customs Committee, at a session of the CIS Council of 
Heads of Customs Services which was held here today. 
  The adoption of the fundamentals of the CIS customs 
legislation is one of the main items on the agenda. They will 
become the basis for further activities of CIS customs services. 
  Kruglov pointed to the topicality of the meeting, which is 
being held on the eve of the CIS summit in Moscow, and stressed 
that multilateral agreements on cooperation and mutual 
assistance in the tackling of customs problems, as well as an 
agreement of customs services on the struggle against the 
smuggling of cultural values would be among documents, prepared 
for signing at tomorrow's summit. 
  The meeting discussed measures, stemming from the resolution 
of the Council of Heads of the CIS Member States, adopted at the 
September conference in Moscow, about the temporary application 
of the treaty on the creation of an economic alliance, which 
would form the basis of customs relations between CIS member 
states. Participants in the meeting discussed possibilities of 
harmonizing the customs legislation of the CIS countries, 
simplifying the customs clearance at the borders and introducing 
a single form of customs documents for foreign trade customs 
statistics. 
  They adopted the conceptual basis for the work of the 
communication centre of law-enforcement agencies of the CIS 
customs services and approved regulations on the national 
communication centre.

  [Text] Moscow, 15 Apr -- The meeting of the Council of 
Heads of Government of the CIS member states has ended at the 
President Hotel in Moscow. The prime ministers and authorized 
representatives of the 12 countries of the Commonwealth signed 
17 documents proposing a deepening of economic integration on 
the territory of the CIS and solutions to a number of social and 
military-political problems. All 20 items on the agenda were 
examined at the session. An ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned 
from informed sources that no fundamental differences arose on 
any of the items on the agenda. 
  Of the agreements which were signed, five will be sent for 
endorsement by the Commonwealth heads of state who, at 1400, 
will sit down at the conference table, together with the prime 
ministers, in the President Hotel. Among these documents are, 
in particular, agreements on Ukraine's joining the economic 
union with the rights of an associate member and on the 
establishment of a permanent body -- a Commission of the 
Economic Union -- under the CIS Coordination and Consultative 
Committee.

  [Text] Moscow April 15 TASS -- Moldova has joined the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and became its full 
member, the ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned at the close of 
a session of the CIS Council of the Heads of State in the 
Kremlin today. On the strength of the session results, the 
leaders of CIS countries are to sign about 12 documents and 
other accords. 
  According to President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, "the CIS 
countries found common points of view on the matters discussed". 
  "The most important thing at today's meeting is that good 
mutual understanding has been reached on all problems 
discussed," Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze told ITAR-TASS. 
  Shevardnadze said CIS countries' leaders discussed mainly 
economic problems, free trade principles, economic cooperation 
committees, and some other issues connected with conflict-ridden 
areas. 
  The Georgian leader told journalists that participants in 
the 
meeting "did not discuss the question of accession of a number 
of CIS countries to NATO's partnership-for-peace programme."

  [Text] The Belarussian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich has 
pessimistically assessed the outcome of the CIS Premiers session 
in Moscow on Friday. 
  One of the things he did not like was that instead of the 
planned signing of papers on the creation of an inter-state 
economics committee to coordinate economic development in the 
CIS states, an "amorphous" body was set up at the 
Coordinative-Consultative Committee -- an economic integration 
commission with purely consultative functions. 
  Kebich argues that without an inter-state economic committee 
the CIS Economic Union will never work. 
  He told Interfax that a number of Commonwealth states had 
wished to follow the example of Russia and Belarus and join the 
ruble zone. According to him, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and 
possibly Armenia are virtually ready for that. 
  In his opinion, other Commonwealth countries would like to 
join but are put off by the need to follow the Belarus example 
of "harmonizing their legislations with Russian laws." Belarus 
has taken two years for that, he added.

<F P=106> [Video report on meeting of CIS heads of state and </F>
government in Moscow on 15 April, including recorded remarks by 
Georgian Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze and Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk; from the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] A routine meeting of CIS heads of state and 
government is taking place in Moscow today. While a number of 
political leaders are again casting doubts on the effectiveness 
of the CIS, the specific questions of political and economic 
cooperation which have been put on the agenda of this meeting 
give grounds for hope that a new step may be taken today toward 
strengthening the Commonwealth. 
  [Correspondent Vladimir Perfilyev] The session of the 
council 
of Commonwealth heads lasted for two hours today in St. 
Catherine's Hall in the Great Kremlin Palace. The meeting was 
chaired by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  Opening the meeting he expressed the hope that this meeting 
would be a new step toward strengthening the Commonwealth. Of 
course, journalists knew the preliminary agenda, but the meeting 
took place behind closed doors and it is better to receive 
information at first hand. The head of the Republic of Georgia 
was laconic. 
  [Shevardnadze] The main thing is that there is good mutual 
understanding on the problems which are being discussed. 
  [Perfilyev] But Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk today 
talked freely with journalists. 
  [Kravchuk] The main issue for us is to resolve the problem 
of 
the Black Sea Fleet. 
  [Perfilyev] In your view is the CIS working or not? 
  [Kravchuk] It is working, but there are difficulties in its 
work. Today Boris Nikolayevich put forward a very good idea 
which was then further developed: to instruct foreign ministers 
and others to draw up a concept for integration within the 
borders, within the framework of the CIS, a concept for further 
integration. You see that voices are being heard calling for a 
Eurasian union, but there are not just voices, they have good 
grounds -- good grounds because the CIS is not yet working well.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 15 TASS -- ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on a CIS 
summit opening in Moscow on Friday: 
  "Main attention at the summit will be devoted to the 
implementation of the treaty on an economic union. The 
discussion will begin with the consideration of a draft 
agreement on Ukraine's accession to the CIS economic union as an 
associated member". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) believes that the efficiency of 
the regular CIS summit will be "quite modest" because up to now 
the CIS has not been able to turn either into a confederation 
or, still less, into a federation. The CIS has failed to form 
even a sensible economic or defence union". 
  At the same time the newspaper admits that if there were no 
CIS at all, the gap between the ex-Soviet republics and their 
peoples "would have been immeasurably wider". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER) maintains that 
the CIS summit is unlikely to become "the embodiment of a 
re-integration success". It is not clear so far how serious is 
the refusal of Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev to 
attend the summit. The refusal can hardly be accounted for by 
the "non-diplomatic cold" alone. 
  The newspaper's opinion is that President Boris Yeltsin of 
the Russian Federation "in Nazarbayev's absence and with a 
comlex relationship with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is 
unlikely to feel confident presiding over the summit: The lack 
of support from strong partners will not be made up for by the 
loyalty of the other summiteers". 
  PRAVDA briefly reports a CIS summit agenda, pointing out the 
possiblity that the summit will decide to create a permanently 
functioning body of the economic union -- an inter-state 
economic committee. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA singles out a report that a plane owned by 
one of U.S. private air companies crossed the Russian border in 
the area of Kamchatka on April 13. Anti-aircraft systems 
spotted the plane when it was only approaching the border. The 
plane was forced to land at one of Russian airports. 
  After the circumstances of the incident were cleared up, the 
plane was allowed to refuel and leave Russian territory. 
Referring to U.S. news media, the newspaper points out that 
this is illustrative of a "radical change in relations between 
the two countries". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with merited test pilot 
Mark Gallai, Dr. of science (technology), who is chagrined by 
how the property of the former Soviet Union is being divided. 
He says this does not look like a "civilised divorce". 
  "Soviet long-range aviation was deployed all over the 
country 
as was prompted by military considerations. If a large number 
of our strategic bombers turned out to be in Ukraine, this, to 
my mind, does not at all mean that citizens of Ukraine had a 
larger input of energies and resources in the developemnt of the 
aircraft than residents in the other ex-Soviet republics". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the recent bombing of Serbian 
positions in the area of Gorazde by NATO aircraft: 
  The West apparently "is not afraid of waking the Russian 
bear". Otherwise, "NATO would have been careful not to bomb the 
hope for peace in Yugoslavia". 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIA asserts that no "breaktrhough to peace", 
as 
was widely publicised by pro-Yeltsin media, was observed: As a 
matter of fact arms-twisting tactics were being applied to the 
Serbs with the mediation of Russian diplomacy..." 
  PRAVDA runs an interwview with Yuriy Vlasov, a member of the 
State Duma, who comments on the forthcoming signing, scheduled 
for this month, of a deed of Russia's accession to the 
Partnership-for- Peace system. 
  "Such partnership is not for Russia," Vlasov maintains. 
"NATO 
does not reduce its armaments but thoroughly modernises them, 
qualitatively increasing its combat might with our simultaneous 
weakening devoid of any logic. It is the weakening of Russia, 
an ultiimate weakening, that the United States presses for, not 
an equal disarmament."

<F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM-TASS correspondent Larisa Lazar] </F>
  [Text] Minsk 15 April, TASS -- Byelorussia [Belarus] is 
deeply concerned about the new aggravation of the situation in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, caused by the NATO air raids on Bosnian 
Serb positions near Gorazde. 
  The republican government stresses in a statement, released 
on Thursday, that the "Belarus Republic again declares its 
consistent adherence to peaceful methods for settling the 
conflict. In light of the recent positive tendencies towards 
the solution of outstanding problems through negotiations, any 
escalation of armed interference will by no means contribute to 
the stabilisation of the situation on the Balkans and may entail 
unpredictable consequences. 
  "Belarus holds that it is the prerogative of the U.N. 
Security Council to make decisions on the use of armed force to 
settle differences among the conflicting sides in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. 
  "Taking into account the dangerous consequences of the armed 
confrontation," the statement says, "Belarus urges all the sides 
involved in the conflict to stop hostilities and to continue 
negotiation in order to achieve peace on the territory of former 
Yugoslavia," according to the document.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Starikevich: "Belarus Could Be Left </F>
Without Military Counterintelligence"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- The Belarusian military 
counterintelligence could become the latest victim of the 
collapse of the country's law enforcement system. 
  The Belarusian Ministry of Defense is eager to take military 
counterintelligence under its wing and turning it into a puppet 
special service. It cannot be ruled out that the republican 
KGB's military counterintelligence directorate will also be 
dissolved. 
  A development of events whereby the matter will be 
restricted 
to internal reform of the directorate is also possible. The 
question of replacing the leadership of military 
counterintelligence is also on the agenda. Its present head 
Valeriy Kez, deputy chairman of the Belarusian KGB and a 
professional counterintelligence worker with experience of work 
in combat situations behind him, is no longer to the liking of 
influential persons in the government. 
  What factors brought about this situation? Matters are in a 
better shape in military counterintelligence than in many other 
law enforcement structures. Here are just two examples. In May 
last year, on the basis of material prepared by 
counterintelligence workers, criminal procedures were instituted 
against 10 border guards who had been systematically stealing 
video equipment and other valuables from trains. It is quite 
interesting that a further 68 guardians of the Motherland's 
borders are being brought as witnesses in these cases. 
  A little more than one year ago, thanks to military 
counterintelligence work, a trade transaction involving the 
sale, with the agreement of the Ministry of Defense, of the 
"Igla" portable antiaircraft missile complex by the state-owned 
foreign trading firm "Belarusintorg" was thwarted. This weapon, 
incidentally, has no counterpart in the world in its combat 
qualities and, according to international classification, can 
also be a terrorist weapon ("Igla" is highly compact, and 
capable of destroying more than just aerial targets). 
  Military counterintelligence is a structure having 
everything 
necessary for autonomous existence: intelligence, 
counterintelligence, analysis, and investigations subdivisions. 
It is quite capable of becoming an autonomous federal organ 
under the control of the Supreme Soviet or the government. The 
experience of Ukraine, where military counterintelligence was 
merged with territorial subdivisions of the security service, 
followed by the reverse process, is sufficiently indicative. 
Nor did Russia take the risk of handing over military 
counterintelligence to the Ministry of Defense. 
  Belarusian reformers are driven by other motives. Their 
complaints against military counterintelligence are political 
rather than professional. It is perfectly obvious that 
publicizing the negative aspects of the activity of the Ministry 
of Defense and the Border Guard Troops is not to the liking of 
their leaders, Pavel Kozlovskiy and Yevgeniy Bocharov. The 
latter has found an original way out of the situation by 
creating, with the tacit consent of the Council of Ministers, 
his own special service -- the Special Active Measures Service 
[otdelnaya sluzhba aktivnykh mer]. 
  Today high-ranking functionaries are seeking to make the law 
enforcement organs not simply an instrument in the struggle for 
power, but actually an instrument protecting the interests of 
one political grouping or another. The first blow to the MVD 
[Ministry of Internal Affairs] and the KGB was dealt in January 
this year. Using the arrest and extradition to Vilnius of two 
leaders of the Lithuanian Communist Party, who had been hiding 
for a long time on the republic's territory, as a pretext for 
creating a scandal, the government lobby settled its accounts 
with power ministers Vladimir Yegorov and Eduard Shirkovskiy. 
  They were too autonomous for the Council of Ministers and 
permitted themselves unheard-of audacities, such as appealing to 
the leaders of the republic in connection with interference in 
their activity by Gennadiy Danilov, "[Prime Minister] Kebich's 
right-hand man." At that time Danilov occupied the post of 
state secretary for combatting crime and for national security. 
  Following publication of the letter from Shirkovskiy and 
Yegorov by the mass media the prime minister promised to abolish 
the State Secretariat. But matters went no further than a 
change of names: The former State Secretariat is now called 
Administration for Coordinating the Activity of Administrative 
Organs. Danilov himself took up the post of government 
secretary, with undefined duties and unlimited powers. Yegorov 
was replaced by Vladimir Danko, who made himself famous by 
declaring in one of his first press conferences his membership 
of the Communist Party. 
  At the moment it is hard to say anything definite about 
Gennadiy Lavitskiy, the new KGB chairman. But he and Danko are 
far more loyal to the Council of Ministers than their 
predecessors. 
  It would appear that military counterintelligence is again 
in 
hot water. The scandal over the theft of documents from a car 
belonging to Iosif Seredich, chief editor of the parliamentary 
newspaper, is being used as a pretext for firing Valeriy Kez. 
This scandal may not have provoked widespread reaction. But 
these documents contained not only information on crimes 
committed by the border guards, but also on certain unofficial 
links between Border Guard Troops Commander Yevgeniy Bocharov 
and Hryb, Danilov, and Lavitskiy. 
  The evidence was passed to a journalist by a military 
counterintelligence officer fired from the State Security organs 
on the instruction of the KGB leadership. These documents were 
deemed unclassified on the basis of the results of an official 
investigation in December. But one month ago the Council of 
Ministers instigated a new investigation, whose conclusions 
turned out to be diametrically opposite. 
  The Belarusian KGB Collegium, at its session in the second 
half of March, refused to adopt a decree on Kez' resignation. 
Now the solution of this question has been left to the 
discretion of the relevant parliamentary commission. 
  According to available information, this commission is 
already preparing to replace Kez. It is expected that Colonel 
Valentin Simirskiy will become head of military 
counterintelligence. For the past five years he has led the 
Russian 1st Tank Army military counterintelligence department. 
It is interesting to note that, at the time when Simirskiy was 
serving in a formation of the Russian group of forces in 
Germany, Danilov's daughter was also posted there. A strange 
situation, is it not: The daughter of a high-ranking government 
functionary serving in the army of another state? 
  In this case military counterintelligence will evidently 
cease to ask unnecessary questions. 
  Many military counterintelligence officers, tired of the 
intrigues developing around their department, have submitted 
separation requests. Work in the security services of 
commercial structures awaits them. Certain counterintelligence 
workers are still hoping for a dignified solution to the 
question, but they too will leave if the Ministry of Defense or 
anyone else make a "puppet" of the special service. 
  The collapse of the military counterintelligence service 
will 
hardly be to the benefit of sovereign Belarus. But when state 
functionaries allow considerations of personal benefit to get 
the better of state interests, it is hard to expect a different 
development of events.

  [Text] The agreement signed by Belarus and Russia on 12 
April to unify the two states' monetary systems immediately 
attracted great attention in the media. What is perhaps most 
interesting, is the difference in interpretations of these 
developments by various journalists. For example, Belarusian 
mass media reported that the document was signed by all members 
of the Belarusian delegation. According to Moscow reports, the 
document was not signed by Belarusian National Bank Chairman 
Stanislaw Bahdankevich. To clarify the situation and the stand 
of the Belarusian National Bank, a BELINFORM reporter tried to 
urgently contact Stanislaw Bahdankevich. This was not easy due 
to the schedule of the chief Belarusian banker, and the 
BELINFORM reporter failed to reach him. However, BELINFORM has 
learned that Stanislaw Bahdankevich held an urgent meeting of 
the Belarusian Bank Board during which members of the board 
declared their support for the agreement, though the decision 
came with difficulty. The situation of the phantom signature 
was also clarified. Stanislaw Bahdankevich signed the agreement 
on the unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary 
systems, but with reservations. The point is that clause No. 5 
of the agreement, saying that all assets and liabilities of the 
Belarusian National Bank should be transferred to the Russian 
Central Bank, contradicts the Belarusian Constitution. 
  At 1330 today at the Belarusian National Press Center, Prime 
Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich will hold a news conference on the 
results of the visit by the Belarusian delegation to Moscow and 
the signing of the monetary unification agreement.

  [Text] A group of Supreme Soviet deputies (Viktar 
Alampiyew, Aleh Trusaw, Lyavon Dzeyka, and three more deputies) 
has submitted to the Supreme Soviet Presidium an appeal with 
three demands: To entrust Prosecutor General Vasil Shaladonaw 
with the task of immediately investigating and, if necessary, of 
initiating criminal action against the participants in the 
preparation and signing of the monetary merger agreement between 
Belarus and Russia; to put the issue of the dismissal of the 
prime minister, other government members and officials for their 
anticonstitutional activities on the agenda of an extraordinary 
Supreme Soviet session; and to conduct a political assessment of 
these events. The authors of the appeal maintain that the Moscow 
agreement violates Articles 8, 145, and others of the Belarusian 
Constitution.

  [Text] According to People's Deputy Uladzimir Zablotskiy, 
deputy chairman of the Belarusian Popular Front [BNF], BNF 
leadership is considering the option of creating the Front of 
National Salvation [FNV]. "The state is being surrendered, 
therefore all must be abandoned in order to deal with this 
issue," Zablotskiy said, having in mind the signing of the 
Belarusian-Russian documents on the monetary merger of both 
states. It is planned that the creation of the FNV will be 
discussed with other democratic organizations. 
  Zablotskiy also stated that the BNF parliamentary opposition 
will demand that the 14th Supreme Soviet extraordinary session 
put on its agenda the issue of responsibility of the Belarusian 
Government leadership for the violation of the Constitution by 
signing the agreement on a monetary merger between Belarus and 
Russia. In particular, according to Zablotski, part 2 of 
Article 8 forbids signing international agreements that 
contradict the Constitution. Moreover, the Russian-Belarusian 
agreements of 12 April, while providing for the location of the 
money issuing center in the Central Bank of Russia, violate 
Article 1 of the Constitution, which stipulates that the 
Republic of Belarus will conduct its domestic and foreign policy 
on an independent basis, as well as Articles 141 and 145, which 
entrust the Bank of Belarus with the sole right to implement 
money and credit policy. All these violations threaten the very 
fundamentals of Belarusian statehood, said Zablotskiy.

  [Text] 0n 14 April 1994, Prime Minister Vyacheslaw Kebich 
held a news conference concerning the results of his visit to 
Moscow, where the signing of the pact on the unification of the 
monetary systems of Russia and Belarus took place. According to 
the Belarusian prime minister, the pact consists of two parts; 
only seven articles were put in force at the time of the 
signing. They relate, in particular, to the lifting of customs 
duties on Belarusian goods exported to Russia. Russia's losses 
in this case will not exceed its expenditures for maintaining 
Russian troops on Belarusian territory as well as for 
transporting industrial cargo, oil, gas, etc. The strongest 
difference of opinion in the process of signing arose during the 
discussion of the second part of the agreement, which is related 
directly to the creation of the monetary union and comes into 
conflict with Article 145 of the Belarusian Constitution. 
Kebich told journalists that Belarusian people's deputies will 
have to consider introducing amendments to the Constitution in 
force, which will deprive the Belarusian Central Bank of being 
first to determine money issuing policy on the territory of 
Belarus, and will transfer this function, as well as some 
others, to the Russian Central Bank. In the event of Supreme 
Soviet's refusal to carry out such manipulations [as received] 
with the Constitution, Kebich intends to launch a national 
referendum on this issue. The Belarusian prime minister also 
informed of the free-of-interest credit in the amount of 200 
million rubles, which will be granted to Belarus in the first 
half of 1994 for balancing the monetary systems of both 
countries. In the event of the cancellation of the agreement, 
this sum must be returned to Russia. "This is a choice of my 
life. I have made it and I do not feel sorry about it," Kebich 
stated. By now, the final word rests with the Belarusian 
parliament, because a real rapprochement of the two Slav states 
can be achieved only after the ratification of the agreement and 
the introduction of amendments to the Constitution.

which provides for solving of certain military problems as well, 
is above all "to the advantage of the Russian servicemen

  After the meeting of the Council of CIS Defence Ministers, 
Kazlowski noted in an interview with TASS that all nuclear 
weapons stationed on Byelorussian soil belong to Russia, which 
is withdrawing them strictly according to the schedule. The 
minister believes the entire nuclear arsenal will be removed to 
Russia by 1999, as scheduled, or even earlier.

<F P=106> [Report by Ihar Sinyakevich: "Election Campaign Will Begin </F>
on 15 April"] 
  [Text] "The election of the first Belarusian president 
will be held on the summary basis," said Central Electoral 
Commission Chairman Alyaksandr Abramovich at a press conference 
on 6 April. In his words, the Law on Presidential Elections 
provides for accelerated procedures when the presidential seat 
becomes vacant before the scheduled time. It says nothing about 
electing the first president. This is why the commission 
adopted a resolution setting specific dates for the beginning 
and end of the various stages of the election campaign. 
  The campaign will begin on 15 April, with the registration 
stage for initiating groups -- which will end on 24 April -- to 
put forward their presidential candidates. Within this period 
of time, the commission has to complete registration of those 
groups, distribute lists of the established form for collecting 
signatures of citizens or parliamentary deputies, and provide 
identification cards to members of initiating groups. A. 
Abramovich emphasized that only initiating group members can 
collect signatures, which should be done exclusively with lists 
of the established form. "This is necessary to prevent certain 
people from beginning to collect signatures ahead of time," the 
commission chairman said. "We have unconfirmed evidence that 
some of the candidates have already gathered the required number 
of signatures, which will not count. This is nothing more than 
practice." 
  Citizens' signatures will be collected between 25 April and 
14 May. According to the law, every citizen has the right to 
support several candidates, but can only sign once for each of 
them. As the commission members noted, in addition to personal 
signatures, the lists must include the following information: 
full name, home address, number of passport or other 
identification document. The lists should then be passed on to 
polling electoral commissions no later than 15 May. "The 
experience we acquired during the referendum shows that 
signatures should be verified at the polling station level," A. 
Abramovich said. 
  Presidential candidates will be registered from 27 May to 2 
June. In the words of A. Abramovich, the collection of 
signatures from parliamentary deputies may drag on until the 
beginning of the registration drive. 
  After the registration, all candidates will receive 20 
million rubles [R] for campaigning and an additional R10 million 
for aides' salaries. The commission representatives stressed 
that according to the Electoral Law, the state is responsible 
for financing the election; the use of any additional funds is 
prohibited. 
  In the words of A. Abramovich, the registered parties and 
movements can propose their candidates for electoral 
commissions. However, those commissions will be set up by the 
executive committees at their discretion. 
  The presidential elections will be held on 23 June.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>
  [Text] According to estimates of politologists and 
economists, Uzbekistan possesses such natural and people's 
recourses which can transform this country into the an advanced 
one over a short period of time. Uzbek President Islam Karimov 
speaks about the prospects of the Republic's development and on 
its ties with Russia with Interfax special correspondent 
Vyacheslav Terekhov. 
  IF: It seems that Uzbekistan is one of the former USSR 
republics which has not experienced a substantial industrial 
recession over the last period of time and witnessed even a kind 
of raising in several fields of industry. Does it mean that you 
have found a recipe to fight with economic misfortunes? 
  I. KARIMOV: As a matter of fact, a 4.5 percent growth of 
industry was fixed in 1993 in Uzbekistan. By the way, according 
to Arkadiy Volskiy (President of the Russian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs - INTERFAX), if we take 1989, 
when economic crisis started in the Soviet Union, as the basic 
point the recession in the sphere of GNP and industrial 
production was 2.5-times lower than in the former USSR in 
general and in several fields it was even three-four times less. 
  I can tell those who want to understand the reasons of this 
phenomenon that this mechanism is rather simple -- it is the way 
which Uzbekistan has chosen to transfer to the market. Many 
people try to explain this by upward distortion of the results 
achieved. This is incorrect. By the way, the army of officials 
was reduced two times in our Republic, at the same time the 
former Union apparatus servicing the former USSR was preserved 
and even is being increased in Russia. 
  Some time ago the Republic abolished the department guarding 
"the socialist property" (OBKhSS) and reduced the People's 
Control. There is no more apparatus of the state committee on 
prices which was controlling prices. It has been united with 
the Finance Ministry, a total of 20 people work there. There is 
no more Gosplan (state planning committee) and Gossnab (state 
supply committee) in Uzbekistan. We have practically abolished 
all organizations controlling economy. 
  We act given the people's wisdom "Having not built a new 
house, do not destroy the old one." Nobody intended to 
immediately destroy the previous system towards which the new 
radical democrats feel hatred, the question concerns its gradual 
re-structuring because it is impossible to force this process. 
There is no other secret. I am convinced that all reforms 
should be implemented gradually and one should not blame the old 
system for all mortal sins. We went along a creative road but 
not along the way of destruction of everything what was created 
before. 
  I believe that the decision of the Russian authorities to 
widely celebrate the 50th anniversary of the victory of the 
Soviet people over fascism is absolutely just. Now Russia 
cannot live without the Army, without the mighty 
military-industrial potential which gave the possibility to 
support the balance in this two-polar world. 
  Those Republics, which primarily shipped raw materials in 
the 
former USSR, have suffered less after the destruction of 
economic ties within the collapsed Union than those which 
produced manufactured goods. For example, Belarus, which has no 
natural resources, entirely depended upon other Union Republics. 
Such a dependence is extremely dangerous. 
  Over the last few years by means of barter, in exchange for 
cotton and other products, Tashkent managed to receive those 
industrial goods which help to maintain rather a high level of 
production. But the main thing is that nobody in Uzbekistan 
intends "to break the old world to the basis and then to build a 
new one." 
  IF: What is the reason of these, say, relative success of 
Uzbekistan? 
  I.KARIMOV: I believe that everything depends upon those who 
stand at the helm of this state. For example, "chiefs of 
laboratories and chief research employees who pretended to be 
leaders of this nation were illiterately fulfilling their 
duties. For example, what could understand a historian, 
Azerbaijan's former president Abulfaz Elchibey, in economy and 
policy? This man has worked all his life among dusty book 
shelves. 
  An analogical situation was in Georgia as well; in this 
Republic a philologist Zviad Gamsakhurdia was heading the state. 
For example, I am not going to write poems and to play piano 
as, say, the former head of the Lithuanian parliament 
V.Landsbergis. When a professional politician Algirdas 
Brazauskas came to power the life in the Republic began to 
return to normal. 
  There existed a threat that incompetent people would come to 
power in Uzbekistan in 1989-90 as it happened in the Caucasus. 
  I must say with a great regret that such negative process 
is going on in Russia now; unwillingness of the people to 
participate in the elections testifies to this fact. And if the 
people do not trust the ideals then any reforms cannot be 
implemented. This is a sad fact because there cannot be 
Uzbekistan's flourishing without Russia's flourishing. I have 
said about this may times. 
  IF: According to available information, about 40 percent of 
Uzbekistan's citizens do not know the Uzbek language which is 
the state one in this nation... 
  I.KARIMOV: As many as 22 Mn people live in Uzbekistan, 77 
percent being Uzbeks, Tatars, Kazakhs, Tajiks, Kyrgyzs, 
Turkmenians, and the so called Russia-speaking people 
representing about 10 percent of the total population represent 
other nationalities living in the Republic. The overwhelming 
majority know the Uzbek language, some of them do not speak 
fluently but there are such people who do not accept it at all. 
On the other hand, there are Russians in the Republic who 
brilliantly speak the Uzbek language, for example, Vitaliy 
Segedin, director of the Akmalyk mining-metallurgical plant. 
  The Uzbek decree on the language is a liberal one -- the 
authorities do not demand that all people should freely possess 
the language but I believe that they should demonstrate respect 
to our language because this is a sign of respect towards the 
people. I think that the Republic's citizens should possess the 
language at least on the level of everyday association. 
  By the way, almost 99 percent of Uzbeks know the Russian 
language whereas this percent is much lower in the 
Transcaucasian and Baltic states. Uzbekistan is an example of 
the respect towards the great Russian language. 
  IF: Several sources in mass media assert that there are 
people in Uzbekistan's distant regions who hunger... 
  I.KARIMOV: Several years ago I worked in the most distant 
mountainous kishlaks (villages) going on foot and mounted. I 
can say that I know how people live in "out-of-the-way places." 
There are regions where there are droughts and the lands are 
infertile but hunger is impossible in our Republic. I assert 
that "there are neither poor nor hungry people in Uzbekistan." 
The community style of Uzbeks' life does not allow this. If at 
least one hungry man appears in makhalla (a traditional 
community of Uzbeks) it would be shameful and disgraceful for 
everybody. I am proud of these people. 
  IF: The previous party apparatus has preserved in 
Uzbekistan's leadership. Do you think that it will be difficult 
to implement reforms with these people or it is easier to rule 
the country? 
  I.KARIMOV: The Uzbeks are very law-obedient people, this 
feature of the people was brought up in the course of centuries. 
In addition, we pursue our own way of democratic construction 
of the state and of market relations -- we do not divide people 
into communists, anti-communists, radicals and democrats in our 
country, we have only refused from Bolsheviks' slogans. One 
should not think that only former communists work in 
Uzbekistan's leadership. By the way, I myself did not study in 
a party school. 
  Many of the Uzbek ministers and their deputies have nothing 
in common with the party apparatus -- these are people younger 
than 40 years old. One can say the same about the majority of 
the governors in the regions. There are no more ardent 
Bolsheviks in the Republic's leadership and many former 
secretaries of the regional party committees correctly 
understand today's demands. Changing in people's thinking in 
Uzbekistan is going on dynamically and I am proud of this. 
  IF: What is the situation in the field of the Republic's 
foreign economic relations? 
  I.KARIMOV: The interest of the foreign capital in Uzbekistan 
is great and it seems to me that Russian leadership perceives 
this with some jealousy. More than 1200 joint ventures function 
in the Republic now, largest international corporations 
participate in their work. There are branches of six 
prestigious foreign banks in the Republic, several reputable 
firms have opened their missions in the Republic. 
  I believe that Uzbekistan could teach Russia in some 
spheres, 
for example, in the field of infrastructure creation, in the 
sphere of foreign economic policy and transfer to market 
relations. By the way, I have written a book devoted to this 
problem. At present Tashkent has currency deposits in the best 
world banks totalling more than $700 Mn. What CIS state can 
boast with such a reserve in hard currency created within 
one-two years? It's my secret how Uzbekistan has managed to 
achieve this. 
  Achievement of a trade parity with Russia is on today's 
agenda. Unfortunately, Tashkent buys practically everything in 
Russia without selling anything to it. At the same time one 
should not perceive Russia as "a milking cow" -- it is the 
richest power and Russians can be proud of its potential. 
  IF: What is your assessment of the case on corruption in 
Uzbekistan's supreme echelons of power investigated by the USSR 
General prosecutor's office and Sh.Rashidov's role (the late 
first secretary of Uzbekistan's communist party -- INTERFAX)? 
According to the investigation, the greatest number of 
millionaires lived in the Republic. Where is their money? 
  I.KARIMOV: You are right, there was corruption in the 
Republic. Upward distortion of the results achieved in the 
production of cotton which were later on transferred into money 
by Uzbekistan's leaders who were gaining great profits is the 
main reason of corruption. However, I believe that the Union 
authorities were fighting with these illegal actions by vicious 
methods, they did not observe laws themselves. 
  Nobody took into account that the Republic had its own 
Constitution, its own Supreme Soviet, its own legislature. They 
arrested deputies of the Union parliament violating their 
status. The suspected ones were hunted by dogs, they were 
handcuffed without any sanctions of the attorney general. 
  I believe that the methods used by the investigators of the 
General prosecutor's office Mr Telman Gdlyan and Mr Nikolay 
Ivanov personified complete lawlessness. Such ignorance of the 
national dignity of the Republic's citizens led to the bloodshed 
in the course of inter-ethnic clashes in the Fergana valley. In 
my opinion, the whole Uzbekistan and, probably, the whole Middle 
Asia could have exploded as a result of this. The Republic 
could not control Gdlyan and Ivanov. They were acting on the 
order of the CPSU Central Committee. 
  I believe that an additional investigation of this case 
should be instituted in the near future. The thing is that 
funds earned honestly were confiscated from the people accused 
of corruption at that time. Women were deprived of 
wedding-rings and jewelry received from their ancestors. This 
was a pure humiliation. Where have all confiscated jewelry's 
disappeared? How much has remained in Mr Gdlyan's pockets and 
in the pockets of other investigators? They have not handed over 
anything into Uzbekistan's treasury. I think that Tashkent can 
raise this issue today. Though we do not want to trouble people 
in this difficult time... 
  IF: Are there opposition parties in Uzbekistan and will they 
participate in the elections? 
  I.KARIMOV: We should start with the clarification of an 
issue what a political party is. This is a movement having its 
own program and its own perception of the state's development. 
After the collapse of the USSR several tens of parties 
immediately appeared in the Republic which announced themselves 
"parties." This testifies to the fact that these are not parties 
but just groupings with definite political ambitions pursuing 
their own goals. 
  As far as the opposition is concerned, it must be 
constructive and act within the Constitution. When a party 
proclaims itself an opposition one but it has the aim to destroy 
public system then, I believe, it cannot be called an opposition. 
  IF: Have you ever thought that you would become leader of a 
state? 
  I.KARIMOV: Never in my life I thought that I would be a 
leader of such a scale and carry a colossal responsibility for 
the fate of the whole country. For a long time I worked in 
planning and financial organizations, I was deputy chairman of 
the government and headed the Republic's State Planning 
Committee. After the discussion of my candidacy in the 
Political Bureau of the CPSU Central Committee and at the plenum 
of the Central Committee I was confirmed on the post of the 
first secretary of Uzbekistan's communist party. It happened 
just after the tragic events in Fergana. At the same time I 
believe that I am an accidental man in the party. 
  I am convinced that any society, even the most democratic 
one, is not barred from sins. Now, Uzbekistan is accumulating 
experience while building its statehood. I think that elements 
of authoritarian system are needed during the transition period. 
If the people elected me to the post of the president, it means 
that they are confident in my program and see that it will bring 
stability and peace to this nation. I believe that I must 
fulfill my duty in the face of the people, that is, I must 
fulfill my program. I must admit that I have never resorted to 
volitional methods. However, I think that sometimes they are 
necessary. 
  IF: The thing is that you yourself create an economic system 
in this country which cannot be subordinated to strong-willed 
decisions... 
  I.KARIMOV: We are forced to resort to volitional methods at 
a definite state in order the objective economic laws could 
triumph. Somebody must take the responsibility and prepare the 
ground in order these laws could work tomorrow. 
  IF: Over the last period of time mass media often reports 
about the growth of anti-Russian moods in Uzbekistan... 
  I.KARIMOV: I do not want to use passionate words but I'd 
like to underline that Uzbekistan always treated Russia with 
great respect and gratitude. This is a sincere feeling. 
  A word expression "near abroad countries" is widely used 
now. 
Frankly speaking, I do not understand what it means. I think 
that such terms artificially separate us with the Russian 
Federation. As for me, authors of this term do not understand 
themselves what is hidden under this word combination. 
  Russia has a great future. After the collapse of the USSR, 
independent young states experienced a kind of euphoria. In 
some of the republics this independence turned into a fetish. 
But the life has proved that sovereignty is not just loud 
statements and declarations. Now many people understand that 
Russia should be the guarantor of peace and stability in the 
Middle Asia. 
  Not long ago in Davos, Pakistani Prime Minister Mrs Bhutto 
declared that today when there is no more iron curtain and the 
republics of the Central Asia are open for the outside world, 
it's high time to start integration process in this region by 
creating an association in which Pakistan will be the leader. I 
categorically oppose this point of view. I believe that the 
Commonwealth of Independent States is a serious organization and 
one cannot but take it into consideration.

  [Text] President Saparmurad Niyazov of Turkmenistan told 
INTERFAX Thursday that Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] was against tough 
structures within the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  "We (CIS countries -- IF) have efficient bilateral 
structures, but the strengthening of independence should not be 
interfered with by new tough structures. The CIS role should be 
enhanced, but without those structures, he said. We need to 
integrate but in a civilized way, he said. Asked about his 
attitude towards Nazarbayev's proposals on the creation of a 
Euro-Asian union, he said that the idea was not new. We should 
understand the very essence of the idea. One center should not 
be replaced by another one. If it is a matter of the creation 
of a new coordinating center, Turkmenistan is against. If a new 
structure will help strengthen independence and our relations, 
the idea should be analyzed, said Niyazov. 
  He believes that it is premature to consider the idea of a 
Euro-Asian union. 
  Niyazov said that partners should not be sought overseas. 
CIS partners and Russia are top priority partners for 
Turkmenistan. We are grateful to the Russian people that they 
helped our republic to achieve a cultural and other progress, he 
said.

  [Text] The situation in the north of Kazakhstan, at 
Semirechye, remains extremely tense. This was reported to an 
RIA correspondent by Vladimir Naumov, first deputy ataman of the 
cossacks' union. According to the information from him, mass 
arrests are being made among Cossacks in the Cossack villages of 
northern Kazakhstan. Even now the Cossack stanitsas [large 
Cossack villages] of Topolovka and Pokatilovo are completely 
blockaded by the local OMON [special purpose militia 
detachment]. The local authorities are also subjecting 
activists of the congress of Russian communities to arrest. In 
particular, Boris Soprunyuk, one of the heads of that 
organization in Kazakhstan, has been arrested. Standard 
accusations are made during the arrest -- either of attempts to 
disrupt the unity of the Republic or of a striving to whip up 
interethnic strife. 
  The atamans of a number of the Cossack troops have sent a 
message to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. They request him to 
use all of his influence to put an end to the lawlessness.

<F P=106> [Dialogue between Sergey Volkov, editor of the analysis </F>
section of the newspaper ABV, and Mikhail Ustyugov, editor of 
the economics section of the newspaper EKSPRESS K: "It Seems the 
Asphalt Is Melting With the Last Snow. Whatever the Demand for 
Democracy-- Such Will Be the Supply"] 
  [Text] [Volkov] Regardless of how much the subject of 
elections may have recently set our teeth on edge, we will have 
to say something about them, summing up the March results. As 
predicted, voter activity turned out to be the lowest in recent 
decades. Although in terms of this indicator we are still 
probably "ahead of the rest of the planet," social apathy is 
clearly on the rise in Kazakhstan. But if in developed 
countries slow activity in the electoral precincts is explained 
by the lack of confidence in politicians as a class (they say 
that without them they could figure out their problems), in our 
country, this phenomenon has a different subtext. Here the 
people are tired of political games and, the main thing, they do 
not believe in the possibility of stabilizing the situation with 
the help of new deputies. 
  The passivity of a certain part of the population has 
indirectly "supported" the executive power, which from the very 
beginning without beating around the bush has taken to slipping 
in (there is no other word for it) people it wants or finds 
helpful. Of course, such a policy could not fail to evoke 
hostility from certain voters who were already weary of 
mindlessly obeying the powers that be. 
  [Ustyugov] Here are some characteristic figures obtained as 
a 
result of a sociological poll conducted by workers of the 
Republic Center for Study of Public Opinion. People of 
Kazakhstan were asked which problems bother them most today. 
Two-thirds answered: the decline of the standard of living, and 
only one out of 20 mentioned the lack of democratic freedoms. 
Whatever the demand for freedom-- such is the supply. As a 
result, we have been given elections that are conducted, as the 
president put it, according to Kazakhstan's standards of 
democracy. Who is to blame for the fact that they turned out to 
be quite unlike the Western ones? There is American democracy, 
there is the general European standard, there is the Chinese, 
the Chilean, and there is Kazakhstan's. And ours is probably 
far from the worst, even if it did baffle CSCE experts. In any 
case a good half of the deputies (not counting those elected 
through the state list) were elected, in my view, without any 
violations or juggling of figures. 
  As for the activity of the electorate, the answer is 
provided 
again by the figures from the poll of the Republic Center for 
Study of Public Opinion. Only 7.5 percent of those questioned 
are counting on effective activity from the new legislative 
organ, and the rest think that the members of parliament engage 
partially in talkathons and partially in lofty abstractions that 
have nothing directly to do with real life, which is ruled not 
by laws but by local bureaucrats. 
  I do not know whether the sociologists were interested in 
the 
reaction of Kazakhstan residents to a possible turn toward 
authoritarian power, with complete elimination of the 
legislative branch, but I do not think they would respond with 
any special disturbance or misgivings here either: The past four 
months, during which the president has had additional authority 
and published edicts instead of signing laws, have shown the 
"elasticity" of Kazakhstan's democratic standards and the fact 
that they are not ingrained in the very essence of the political 
system, social life, and mentality of the citizens. 
<H5>  The Fortress of Power and the "Degree" of Loyalty </H5>
  [Volkov] And still, in spite of the back-room games that 
have 
weeded out many politicians who were really needed in the 
Supreme Council, the new parliament will certainly not be in the 
government's pocket. 
  In the first place, certain deputies have remained from the 
preceding Supreme Council to join the current one, and the 
majority of them are extremely opposed to the policy being 
conducted today by the higher and middle echelons of power. 
  In the second place, no fewer if not more of the new members 
of parliament also share the aforementioned dislike for the 
actions of the government. 
  True, a part of the St. Petersburg corps is elected from the 
state or, more precisely, the president's list. Their position 
is unenviable. On the one hand, they were elected by the people 
and, quite naturally, must defend their interests. On the 
other, the fact that they were nominated by the head of state 
places on them certain moral (not to mention other) obligations 
to the president. This kind of duality (one might call it a 
"split personality") of a considerable number of the people's 
elect could undoubtedly play a self-destructive role in the new 
parliament. Add to this the division of the Supreme Council 
into two chambers (and many observers consider this all but a 
fait accompli) and it becomes clear that for the first time our 
deputies will be engaged in "mud slinging" at one another and 
the government at the same time. I think the former will still 
win out and the rest of the problems will be classified as 
internal parliamentary ones. 
  A distinguishing feature of March was the active preparation 
of certain people for posts in the Supreme Council. Today, 
nobody any longer conceals the fact that Kuanysh Suyltanov 
should become the leader of one of the chambers of parliament. 
His conspicuous dismissal from the position of deputy prime 
minister because of "election to people's deputy" long before 
the beginning of the work of the first session was to have shown 
to the least quick-witted that this statesmen had now seriously 
taken up the cause of building 
a new parliament. 
  [Ustyugov] The main task of the "script writers" who today 
are preparing the basis for the first session is to provide for 
a structure of the legislative organ and a mechanism for its 
activity that will enable the executive power to function 
freely. Parliament is to play a constructive-decorative role 
and nothing more. Above all it will be necessary to undertake a 
number of organizational measures aimed at holding back, 
dragging out, and "self-entanglement" of decisions that run 
counter to government policy. The complicated bicameral 
structure, the system of relations between the two chambers, and 
the regulations work to this end. Many a week will probably be 
devoted to these questions. 
  Otherwise, the standoff between the powers would begin 
almost 
on the first day of the session. And what good does it do that 
the amount of the minimum wage and pension in the Republic is 
approaching the value of one U.S. dollar? They will call the 
prime minister to the podium and vote, say, for increasing the 
"minimum" to the value of the minimum consumer basket -- 400 
tenge. The citizens will rejoice. Tomorrow they will all be 
given 10 times more money. The day after tomorrow all the 
prices will rise 10-fold. Will they summon the prime minister 
to the podium again? 
  I am not speaking about the Republic budget, from which all 
benefits for war veterans, misplaced residents of the Aral Sea 
area, Semipalatinsk victims, Chernobyl victims, and those who 
suffered from the repressions have been eliminated. What kind 
of parliament would approve such a decision? 
  There is only one way out: Raise the "degree" of 
parliamentary loyalty, which will make it possible to assign to 
the president additional authority (in any case in the economic 
sphere) throughout the entire period of the "transition." Then 
the government will have its hands tied and the people's 
deputies will have it easier: There will be no need to waver 
between the Scylla and Charybdis of schism and disbandment. 
<H5>  There Is More Room on Olympus </H5>
  [Volkov] The personnel changes that occurred in March again 
evoked more questions than answers. The "reassignment" of 
Tulegen Zhukeyev from the position of state adviser to the 
vacant post of deputy prime minister with the present 
leapfrogging in functional duties of members of the government 
make it impossible to understand whether this was a 
reinforcement of a "weak section" in the administration of the 
state or a demotion of some ill-favored person (recall how some 
of the functions were "taken away" from the former state 
adviser), or simply a change of the official title of the 
position held by Mr. Zhukeyev, leaving him in charge of all the 
sections he had before. The customary curtain of complete 
secrecy over transfers like this leaves no chance of figuring 
out the real reasons for the aforementioned actions. 
  Nor does the discharge of Marat Ospanov from the position of 
the republic's chief tax collector because of his election as a 
deputy a month before the beginning of the work of the 
parliament provide an answer to the question of whether this is 
related to his forthcoming active work in the new Supreme 
Council or if there are some other factors at work here. It is 
no accident, probably, that President Sergey Tereshchenko 
recently said reproachfully that last year the tax services of 
Kazakhstan collected only 42 percent of the taxes that were due. 
Such "kindness" to the taxpayers at a time that is so difficult 
for the state budget cannot but make one wonder. With respect 
for Mr. Ospanov as a politician, I still cannot help but ask 
what actually were the reasons for his desire to be among the 
people's deputies again and why the Republic leaders supported 
him in this? This question could be asked of several of those 
who were elected in March. 
  [Ustyugov] I can add only that Zhukeyev's appointment as 
deputy prime minister, from the standpoint of the Basic Law, 
reinforces his positions since nothing is said about state 
advisers in the Constitution. I would not be surprised if the 
president eliminated the institution of state advisers 
altogether this year. 
<H5>  We Have Too Few Fedorovs But Too Many Zaveryukhas </H5>
  [Volkov] March was also very instructive in the area of our 
leaders' outside contacts. The tendencies here are such that 
the Almaty leaders have already come up with a universal 
"lamentation." Bouncing along the pothole-filled highways of the 
capital (the impression was that the asphalt would melt along 
with the last snow), they say: If the president had not 
travelled abroad so frequently and had traveled on our roads, 
things would be easier for us. Let us overlook the concreteness 
of this complaint-request and discuss the principle of its 
origin. It is very good that both Nursultan Nazarbayev and the 
country he heads have a positive image abroad. It is even 
better that considerable amounts of funds in dollars are 
allotted to this country. But beyond that, as in the Soviet 
Union in Gorbachev's times, everything practically comes to a 
standstill. How, why, and where this money is spent--we do not 
know. A fresh example. Having concluded an agreement with the 
IMF and having received a guarantee that Kazakhstan would 
receive a large foreign currency loan, our government stated 
repeatedly that the money would be spent, among other things, 
for stabilizing exchange rate of the tenge and curbing 
inflation. In March, we could see quite well how these 
intentions are being realized when on the eve of the elections 
the dollar was surging upward and by April Fool's Day it had 
doubled its tenge value -- and that was in one 
month! 
  If things continue like this it will not be long before it 
will be possible to have another financial reform in order to 
reduce the scale of the Republic's monetary unit. Such 
fantasies are nourished by the appearance in circulation of 
bills worth 200 tenge and the word from the president about his 
intention to buy from Great Britain special equipment on which 
our monetary bills are printed. If the former information evokes 
regret about such a rapid devaluation of the national currency 
(it is no joke that within four months after the monetary reform 
they will issue a denomination worth twice as much as the 
nominal value of the largest monetary bill!), the latter causes 
misgivings that soon the printing of tenge will turn into an 
uncontrolled process of issuing money that rapidly loses its 
value. 
  [Ustyugov] We do not have the appropriate political support 
for a stricter financial exchange rate in Kazakhstan. The 
Cabinet of Ministers is a monotonous, uniform monolith, and the 
struggle of approaches and concepts (if it exists at all) is 
left to the cadres. It is necessary to reveal (or create?) a 
multipolarity of government similar to the Russian: We must have 
our own Fedorovs who are ready to fall in battle against 
preferential credit and our own Zaveryukhas and Skokovs, who 
express the interests of the agro-industrial generals. But now 
one gets the impression that the government expresses only its 
own interests, which only it can understand, and therefore, 
today it is capable of canceling out what it categorically 
declared yesterday, and tomorrow it will no less resolutely 
return to the other side. And all this without conflicts, 
polemics, or resignations, with concerted, inspired enthusiasm. 
The result is that the general deterioration of the situation 
(and it is inevitable this year) is linked by the citizens not 
to concrete officials representing various ideas and interests, 
but the government and president as a whole. Today, the head of 
state must distance himself from the Cabinet of 
Ministers--beginning with separation of the staffs and ending 
with the appointment to the position of prime minister of a 
really respected strategist. Instead of this, Nazarbayev takes 
the "fire" himself, signing first populist and economically 
ideologized and then monetaristic-draconian decisions. There is 
an ancient truth that the more you take on, the more they ask of 
you. Appeals to create global conferences and alliances with 
supernational kopeks sound good on world-scale spaces, but they 
do not solve our internal problems. 
<H5>  Do Not Grieve Over the Exchanges, Lads </H5>
  [Volkov] Kazakhstan is sometimes discussed in terms of a sad 
principle: Either something good or nothing at all. The decline 
of the production rates, the shutting down of hundreds of 
enterprises, and the nonpayments crisis have become typical 
phenomena. It would not be so bad if behind all this one could 
see positive tendencies in economic processes. Alas, even the 
documents the president and prime minister have signed, taking 
advantage of parliament's absence, give one no confidence that 
with their implementation our economy will reach any significant 
heights. Two recent edicts will serve as an example: "On 
Commodity Exchanges" and "On Measures for Forming Securities." 
Their adoption clearly shows that the country's leaders today 
are more interested in the problem of "staking out" as quickly 
as possible (before the beginning of the work of the Supreme 
Council) the basic points of their own economic policy than in 
actually implementing it. There has already been too much 
discussion of the sad fate of the Kazakhstan stock exchanges, 
which vanished not only because they were excessively numerous, 
but also because of the fact that they were not included in the 
government schemes. So many lances, arrows, and other piercing 
writing implements have been broken over the creation of normal 
conditions for the formation of the securities market. Since it 
still does not exist, two legislative acts prepared by the 
executive power (another paradox of our legal thinking) will 
come out, and everyone is supposed to think that tomorrow 
everything will be okay in the corresponding areas of the 
economy. But in reality, little will change as a result of the 
creation of state organs for questions of markets and securities 
(and these are the provisions that are the linchpins of these 
edicts), the more so taking into account the current degree of 
state influence over the economy. Why do these issues have to 
be raised again today? Is it really just in order to show that 
the executive power has its finger on the pulse of the reforms? 
  [Ustyugov] Incidentally, the government commission for 
developing the concept of the functioning of the securities 
market in Kazakhstan was created about two years ago and it 
seems that it has not convened once since then. Russia has 
adopted hundreds of normative acts aimed at the formation and 
civilized regulation of this extremely important variable in a 
market economy. We are just beginning. Well, we can still 
console ourselves: Better late than never.

  [Text] The GOLOS ARMENII newspaper publishes a message the 
group of Armenian and Karabakh parliamentaries sent to the 
Serbian President Mr. Sl. Milosevic. The letter says that just 
at the beginning of the military actions in Yugoslavia Armenians 
became indignant following the tragedy Serbians and 
Chernogorians [as received] were and are being involved. 
Armenians as all the people of Yugoslavia have been fighting 
for independence for years. 
  It's very difficult to fight for independence while Russia 
is 
under the influence of "Atlantism" and practically takes the 
position of an observer with respect to the fate of her 
traditional aliens. Just this fact let the Anglo-Saxons and 
their Western and Eastern aliens using the slogan of 
peace-keeping dictate their "world order" to those nations who 
are in an artificial borders' deadlock. 
  Armenian and Karabakh parliamentaries express their 
confidence in the fact that the creation of new political 
realities let the orthodoxy and the Islamic fundamentalism 
prevent wars and death in the region.

  [Text] The press service of the Defense Ministry has 
stated: The Black Sea Fleet command has ordered the dispatch 
today of an amphibious warfare ship to Odessa, thus ignoring 
emphatic objections by Ukraine's Ministry of Defense. The press 
service reports that the fleet headquarters previously informed 
our Ministry of Defense of the move, arguing that it was caused 
by the necessity of bringing a group of officers from the 
disbanded 318th division from Odessa to Sevastopol. The request 
was denied, since Ukraine's Ministry of Defense is perfectly 
capable of transporting the officers itself, either by sea or by 
air. Official assurances to this effect have been given to the 
Black Sea Fleet command. 
  The press service stresses that Admiral Baltin and his aides 
have now resorted to a step that could aggravate the already 
complex situation concerning the Black Sea Fleet. At the same 
time, the press service notes, there is concern at the fact that 
the fleet command allocated a specialized mobile ship for the 
action, which is normally used for amphibious assault landing. 
Besides, an escort ship and two fully armed antisubmarine ships 
have cast off in Sevastopol today. The Admiral Golovko rocket 
cruiser and other combat vessels of the Black Sea Fleet are also 
being put on alert.

  [Text] Odessa, 14 Apr -- A detachment of Black Sea Fleet 
ships, led by the large amphibious warfare ship Tsezar Kunikov, 
which was heading for Odessa today from Sevastopol, has turned 
back. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told this by telephone by 
Aleksandr Kluban, head of the press service of the Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry. 
  According to him, the change of course occurred thanks to 
agreement between the leadership of the Ukrainian military 
department and the Black Sea Fleet command.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent A. Vozhhov from Sevastopol; </F>
from the "Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] The Officers' Assembly was held at the Black Sea 
Fleet military base in Sevastopol. The officers have condemned 
the actions curried out by the Ukraine Navy against the 
personnel of the 318th Division of the reserve ships in Odessa. 
The assembly called on the Ukrainian Government and Defense 
Ministry to stop the arbitrary actions against the Black Sea 
Fleet, and said that the Black Sea Fleet is not to be 
intimidated and will remain, as before, faithful to the peoples 
of Russia and Ukraine, its military duty, and their oath of 
allegiance that is given only once. The incident in Odessa 
could be forgotten for the sake of accord between the two Slav 
states -- but only after an investigation and punishment of 
those responsible for it has been carried out. However, the 
Ukrainian side resists this. 
  [Begin Admiral Feliks Gromov recording, Black Sea Fleet 
commander] The Black Sea Fleet has requested permission from the 
Foreign and Defense Ministries of Ukraine to allow a medium 
assault landing force vessel carrying representatives of the 
Black Sea Fleet to arrive in Odessa and take onboard seamen who 
swore allegiance to Russia. So far, the Ukrainian Defense 
Ministry has not given its agreement to it. [end recording] 
  [Vozhzhov] Families of servicemen of the 318th Division in 
Odessa who refused to swear an oath of allegiance to Ukraine are 
now being evicted from their apartments. Besides, sources close 
to the Ukraine Navy General Staff report that an action similar 
to that in Odessa is being planned in Ismail, this time against 
a brigade of river vessels. 
  [Begin Gromov recording] The Black Sea Fleet problem should 
be solved once and for all in accordance with the Massandra 
Protocol. [end recording]

  [Text] Commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Admiral Eduard 
Baltin in an interview with INTERFAX denied reports that the 
Fleet's ships left for sea on Thursday to block the Slavutich 
ship of the Ukrainian Naval Board. 
  Slavutich was in Odessa where it took part in the 
celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the city's liberation 
from the Nazis, and is currently moving toward Sevastopol. 
  According to Baltin, a marine ship of the Black Sea Fleet 
left for Odessa on 14 April to take on board military servicemen 
of a Black Sea Fleet division and their families. However, 
since the Ukrainian defense minister ordered the ports of 
Odessa, Nikolayev, Ochakov, Ismail and Kherson not to let Black 
Sea Fleet ships in, the ship had to return to Sevastopol. 
  In the meantime, Head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's 
press service Aleksandr Kluban told INTERFAX-Ukraine, the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry granted all of its resources -- ships 
and air transport -- to take out those military servicemen. In 
particular, there was a proposal to transport people on board 
the Slavutich.

  [Text] Kiev, 14 Apr -- The press center of the Foreign 
Affairs Ministry of Ukraine has disproved today's report by the 
information program of the Ostankino First Channel to the effect 
that Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko laid the 
responsibility for the Odessa incident at the door of the local 
power bodies. "The words ascribed to the minister were never 
pronounced. The interview itself, mentioned in the news by the 
Russian mass media, was nonexistent," emphasizes the statement 
by the press center of Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry. 
"Such distortions and the campaign of falsehoods, launched in 
the Russian mass media around the Odessa incident, have quite an 
obvious objective: To aggravate the situation around the entire 
package of the Black Sea Fleet problems, shifting the 
responsibility onto the Ukrainian side," indicates the statement 
by the press center of Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry.

  [Text] Odessa [no dateline as received] -- Today, Vice 
Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovynyy, commander of the Ukrainian Naval 
Forces, who arrived from Nikolayev, met Captain 1st Rank Dmytro 
Ukrayinets, Odessa senior naval chief, appointed by Ukraine's 
Defense Ministry on 13 April, and the command of Ukraine's 
Defense Ministry First Brigade protecting the Odessa water 
basin. During a break in the conference, Volodymyr Bezkorovynyy 
granted a brief interview to a UNIAN correspondent. 
  "The 12 April meeting in Kiev between the unofficial 
delegations of Ukraine and Russia in connection with the Odessa 
incident does not evoke my optimism," said the Ukrainian Naval 
Forces commander. "We supplied the Russian side with all the 
documents that confirm the illegitimate and criminal nature of 
the actions by the Russian officers who were on board the survey 
vessel, the Cheleken, and also on the part of the command of the 
former 318th Division of the Black Sea Fleet conservation ships. 
We submitted explanatory notes, eyewitnesses' evidence that the 
cargo on board the Cheleken was loaded in secret, and the order 
to use arms against Ukrainian sailors was immediately passed to 
Captain 2d Rank Oleksandr Zelenko from Sevastopol by the Black 
Sea Fleet command. 
  ``We also provided proof of the legitimacy of the actions by 
Captain 1st Rank Volodymyr Orlov, the senior naval chief of 
Odessa. All the documents are irrefutable, from the legal 
viewpoint. One can only refuse to acknowledge them -- to be 
more precise -- to refuse to be aware of them, what, correctly 
speaking, the Russian side, headed by Admiral Feliks Gromov, 
demonstrated at the meeting. There can be no other explanation 
of the fact that Admiral Gromov did everything possible so that 
we, like him, would fail to meet the participants in the Odessa 
incident in Sevastopol. The meeting with the crew of the 
Cheleken was obviously not to his advantage. When he arrived in 
Sevastopol, the Russian military sailors would not allow the 
procurator, a customs official, and border guards to go onboard 
the Cheleken. This gives grounds to assume that not only the 
hydrographic unit RLS-5 `Mars' was taken away from Odessa in a 
criminal manner, but, probably, other valuable equipment from 
Ukraine's untouchable mobilization resources, as well. We 
insist and we will continue to insist that the stolen military 
cargo be returned to Odessa.'' 
  Replying to the question as to what his answer to President 
Leonid Kravchuk was concerning the proposal made by the U.S. top 
leadership on 13 April to mediate in solving the Black Sea Fleet 
issues, Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy said: "Of course, it is time 
that the leaders of the two states and peoples -- the Ukrainian 
and Russian -- should themselves sort out every aspect of the 
matter. Where there is a will, there is a way. I would speak 
out in favor of adopting the proposal of the U.S. top leadership 
to be a third arbitration party during the Black Sea Fleet 
division." 
  Also today, Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy had a 
businesslike meeting with Lieutenant General Volodymyr 
Shkidchenko, the Odessa Military District commander.

  [Text] Sevastopol, 14 April -- According to the press 
service of the Naval Forces of Ukraine, power supply to the 
ships of Ukraine's Naval Forces moored in Sevastopol has been 
cut off since 11 April, although the Ukrainian side was not 
indebted to the financial department of the Black Sea Fleet. 
The supply of electricity to the Hetman Sahaydachnyy and the 
SKR-112 patrol-launch ships, as well as the Lutsk small 
antisubmarine ship has been cut off for unknown reasons. The 
Black Sea Fleet press center representative, Serhiy Dolzhykov, 
could not explain anything in this connection.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 15 April, TASS -- Twelve ships of the Black 
Sea Navy have put to sea for combat training. These are planned 
exercises and they are in no way linked with the latest events 
in odessa, ITAR-TASS was told by telephone by officials of the 
Navy's press centre on Friday. 
  According to the same source, three other ships of the Black 
Sea Navy had put out for planned exercises on Thursday. 
Therefore, taking part in the planned training mission in the 
open sea are fifteen ships of the Black Sea Navy. 
  According to information received from the press centre, a 
large landing ship left the Sevastopol base on Thursday to 
evacuate Black Sea Navy personnel, their families and property 
from Odessa. However, on the same day Ukrainian Defence Minister 
Vitaly Radetsky addressed a telegram to the commander of the 
Black Sea Navy, informing him that calls of Russian warships to 
Nikolayev, Ochakov, Ismail and Odessa were undesirable. The 
large landing craft was ordered to return to the base. 
  Reports from Sevastopol indicate that three ships of the 
Ukrainian Navy, anchored in the Navy's chief base, have been cut 
off from their shore power sources for the fourth day running. 
Now they have to consume their own fuel resources to remain 
operational. According to the official version of Black Sea Navy 
officials, who had cut off the power supply, this was done 
because the Ukrainian side had not paid its debts for the 
already consumed electricity. 
  However, chief of the Ukrainian Navy's financial service 
Colonel Viktor Kobernik claims that the debt for the electricity 
was settled.

interaction for their protection in 1994 has been worked out. 
  The sides stated that the number of illegal border crossing 
attempts has increased of late. Criminal groupings remain to be 
active, there are instances of drug-trafficking and smuggling of 
fire arms and other kinds of weapons. 
  Valeriy Hubenko and his foreign counterpart also discussed 
the state of affairs at the border checkpoints as well as 
measures for the successful fulfillment of the agreements on the 
state border between Ukraine and the Slovak Republic.

  [Text] Fierce fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani 
troops continue in Karabakh's eastern and north-eastern areas. 
As a Karabakh Defence Ministry officer has reported to 
Interfax, the battle front now stretches for up to 100 
kilometers. Azerbaijani forces still try to gain more ground. 
However, as a result of an Armenian counter-attack east of 
Mardakert on Wednesday, Azerbaijanis retreated with heavy losses 
to their former positions. 
  According to reports from Stepanakert, after a brief respite 
throughout last night, bitter fighting resumed Thursday morning. 
Azerbaijani planes again bombed Karabakh on Thursday. However, 
there have been no report of casualties or damage. 
  Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's Defence Ministry reports about 
unceasing Armenian attempts over four successive days to mount 
attacks in the north, north-east, and south-east of Karabakh. 
According to figures from Baku, Armenia lost in two days of 
fighting about a hundred men, three tanks, and two armored 
vehicles. Azerbaijani casualties have not been reported. 
(Stepanakert denies reports of heavy Armenian losses - IF).

  [Text] Baku is unhappy with mediators' aspiration to reach 
a ceasefire in the Karabakh conflict zone. Baku "openly spoke 
against bringing separating forces into the region, which is the 
backbone of Russia's peace plan," Acting Chairman of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Supreme Soviet Karen Baburyan told Interfax on 
April 14. 
  Therefore, he considers that it was not by chance that the 
start of a new offensive by the Azeri army in northern 
Nagorno-Karabakh and activation of peacekeeping efforts of the 
international community, and in the first place of Russia, 
"seeking the soonest end of bloodshed as the first step toward 
the beginning of talks" coincided. 
  In Baburyan's opinion, the prospect of Russia's military 
presence in the conflict zone alarmed the Azeri side which is 
aiming to disrupt a meeting between the warring sides at the 
highest level prepared with Russia's mediation.

  [Text] Ethnic Russians in Estonia have appealed to Russia's 
President Yeltsin, parliament, and government to head off a 
serious ethnic conflict in that Baltic republic. The document, 
a copy of which has been made available to Interfax by the 
Congress of Russian Communities, points out that "the Estonian 
side by its actions is provoking mass acts of civil disobedience 
and in the background of a continuously worsening economic 
situation are preparing to introduce police rule." 
  The community charges the Estonian nationalist government 
with the intent to start ethnic cleansing in the republic by 
various means, direct deportation included, for which a 
concentration camp has been set at Rummu near Tallinn, and a 
special police service is being formed. 
  The community regards as humiliating for Russia the Estonian 
government's demands that the Russians permanently residing in 
the republic and persons without Estonian citizenship be 
required to formally apply for residence and employment, and 
that retired army officers are additionally forced to present 
their army service records and results of medical checks on 
AIDS, tuberculosis, and other diseases. 
  Those without residence permits are declared illegal foreign 
migrants and are expelled from Estonia immediately. But even 
with residence permits, the Russians and other nationals who 
have permanently lived in Estonia are only entitled to temporary 
residence (5 years) with all the ensuing consequences (the loss 
of the right to privatize housing, buy property, etc.), the 
appeal says.

  [Text] TALLINN, Apr 14, BNS -- An unofficial meeting of 
border officials from Estonia and Russia today failed to settle 
the issue of possible deportation of illegal refugees back to 
Russia. The head of Estonia's northeastern border section, Riho 
Breivel, who represented Estonia at the meeting, said he had 
handed over to his Russian counterpart, Col. Viktor Kolotukhin, 
a formal application to send back to Russia the citizens of 
third countries, including the Kurds, who arrive in Estonia 
illegally. 
  "The representative of Russia was yet unable to announce to 
us any formal position on the issue, since they have an 
investigation still under way," Breivel said, adding that a 
solution to the issue was expected at an official meeting of 
border representatives. He expressed hope that Russia would 
propose a date for the official meeting "quite soon." 
  "We have achieved rather good cooperation with the Russian 
side and also the Russian border guards understand the problems 
that have emerged," he said. 
  Another meeting, in the village of Kruppa on the borderline 
between Estonia and Russia in Estonia's southeast on Wednesday 
[13 April], beside the illegal immigrants issue discussed 
introducing tighter controls on the borderline, which Estonia 
regards only as a temporary control line between the countries. 
The meeting was attended by the head of command of the Estonian 
Border Guard Department, Aare Evisalu, head of the service 
department Edgar Aaro, and the head of Russia's regional group 
of border forces at Pskov, Ltn. Gen. Viktor Kostenko.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 14, BNS -- Leaders of the parties in 
Estonia's ruling coalition signed a document Tuesday [12 April] 
that establishes the principles for working closely between the 
five parties in the future. The Liberal Democrats, the Rural 
Centrists, the Estonian National Independence Party, the Social 
Democratic Party, and the National Assembly Party "Pro Patria" 
in the document take the obligation to abstain from making any 
statements which could be interpreted as breaking up the 
coalition link. 
  The document stipulates that dissenting opinions by the 
parties' factions in the parliament, by the government or the 
parties are binding to the coalition, whereas dissenting 
opinions by members of the factions and Cabinet members are only 
advisory. The same document says that the body presenting a 
dissenting opinion of binding character has the right for a veto 
of deferment, applicable to one and the same bill only once. 
  The paper signed on Tuesday is a working document that 
concerns above all the parties of the ruling coalition, Prime 
Minister Mart Laar said in his comments at today's press 
conference. The coalition parties felt that rules for their 
relations had to be established in a document, he added.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 14, BNS -- Russia will not start 
pulling out nuclear rods from its reactors at the naval base of 
Paldiski in the second decade of March, as was established 
earlier, said Juri Tikk, the Estonian Government's special 
representative in Paldiski. The date for starting the work will 
be most likely set on Apr. 22 or 23, when the Russian group to 
carry out the dismantling is scheduled to arrive at the 
facility, located some 35 kilometers to the west of Tallinn. 
But Tikk expressed hope that the work will still start this 
month. The two countries have already agreed upon the technical 
issues pertaining to the dismantling of the reactors in the 
Russian submarine crew training center. 
  Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation for talks 
with Russia and head of the group for military issues of the 
delegation, said Estonia had proposed what he called a totally 
new plan for the dismantling. "This idea is different from the 
earlier ones. Our position is that the rods must be out from 
Estonia by June 30, 1994. But the rest of the work -- 
dismantling of the reactor corpus and taking out the solid and 
liquid nuclear waste -- must take place as quickly as possible," 
Tiiman said in a press conference of the Estonian delegation. 
He said the idea reminded of an earlier suggestion, according 
to which the reactors would be mounted on special trailers and 
taken away by ship or train. He refused to specify. 
  Tiiman characterized his country's new proposal as optimal. 
He said work according to this scheme would cost Estonia less 
than 10 million U.S. dollars. 
  The Estonian Cabinet at its meeting on Apr. 12 ruled to 
introduce emergency regulations on the Pakri peninsula, where 
Paldiski is situated, during the period of work on the reactors. 
The regulations, to become effective after a decree by the 
minister of the interior, will make the region again off-limits 
area for outsiders. Estonian officials say that if Russia 
agrees to the scheme proposed by the country, the whole process 
of dismantling the reactors will take about three years.

<F P=106> [Irina Litvinova report: "`Technical Error' Costs Russians </F>
in Latvia Dear"] 
  [Text] Riga -- President Guntis Ulmanis considers a 
meeting with Boris Yeltsin impossible in the near future. 
Russia has not rescinded in the form demanded by Latvia the 
presidential directive on the creation of a military base on 
Latvian territory. 
  The two presidents were to have met 20 April. The meeting 
could have brought Latvia and Russia closer together and 
smoothed over some political problems. In mid-March agreements 
on the troop withdrawal from Latvia, social guarantees for 
military pensioners, and the status of the radar station at 
Skrunda were initialed. 
  The ruling coalition has had difficulty in getting the 
documents ratified in the Saeima, fending off virulent 
opposition from the national radical opposition, which considers 
the agreements a "betrayal" and a "threat to our independence." 
Now even the agreements' supporters are claiming that there can 
be no question of ratifying them in their previous form. The 
agreement on Russian military pensioners is under threat. An 
accord had previously been reached to the effect that Russian 
military pensioners transferred to the reserve before 1992 could 
stay in Latvia. There are currently around 21,000 of them in 
the republic, and more than one-half are over 60. 
  Patriots are calling for changes to the composition of the 
delegation to the talks with Russia and for those talks to be 
conducted in a tougher and more demanding way. Radicals are 
calling in several publications for violent action against the 
"occupiers" and "colonialists" and for the overthrow of the 
current authorities.

  [Text] RIGA, Apr 14, BNS -- Deputies in the Latvian Saeima 
(parliament) oppositionary National Bloc said Wednesday [13 
April] they wanted a new delegation for talks with Russia. The 
bloc also urges the parliament not to ratify the March 15 
initialed agreements with Russia because they contain several 
norms that can be interpreted as legalization of consequences of 
the Soviet occupation in Latvia. These issues should be 
considered in an extraordinary session of the Saeima, the group 
said. The majority of the Latvian people dislikes the agreement 
on social guarantees for Russia's war pensioners in Latvia, the 
National Bloc said. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin's directive on the setup of 
a 
military base in Latvia signals that Russia has aggressive plans 
in the Baltic country. In addition, none of the foreign 
countries, which pressed Latvia into compromise with Russia on 
the Skrunda radar's operation, has extended real security 
guarantees against possible conflicts, disputes or provocations, 
according to the bloc's statement. 
  Yeltsin's decision presented the Latvian government a way 
out 
of situation because it would have had to resign if these floppy 
agreements were signed, said Aristids Lambergs, of the National 
Independence Movement faction. 
  Lambergs claims that the country's delegation for talks with 
Russia should include representatives of all Saeima factions. 
  The National Bloc proposes to convene an extraordinary 
plenary session to discuss the setup of the new delegation on 
April 20, Lambergs told BNS. The bloc's statement was signed by 
16 deputies. To propose an extraordinary session, signatures of 
33 deputies, or one-third of the 100-member Saeima, are needed. 
The National Bloc, which includes 35 MPs, hopes to get the 
lacking signatures until Monday. 
  The National Bloc includes National Independence Movement, 
Homeland and Freedom and Christian Democrats factions.

  [Excerpts] RIGA, Apr 14, BNS -- The European countries 
endorse the present Latvian stance in relations with Russia, the 
Baltic nation's President Guntis Ulmanis told reporters Thursday 
[14 April] on return from his European trip. During his 
three-day journey, Ulmanis met with 16 top level leaders of 
Denmark, France and Great Britain and learned that the issue of 
relations between Latvia and Russia would be considered in the 
European Union's [EU] Political Committee. [passage omitted] 
  Ulmanis and European politicians discussed a possibility to 
create a special foundation to help Russia's military retirees 
return to their historic homeland. The foundation could be 
sponsored by European countries, the Latvian president said. 
Consequently, the return of war pensioners to Russia could be 
settled "in a civilized manner," Ulmanis said. The foundation's 
resources could also be used to clean the environmental damage 
from the Russian-operated radar facility at Skrunda. 
  The Latvian Cabinet has already set up a working party to 
draft the foundation's statutes. 
  Ulmanis reiterated that the package of withdrawal agreements 
would not be signed unless Yeltsin revoked the April 5 
directive. In addition, Ulmanis claims that the initialed 
agreements should be amended before signature in view of the 
setup of the mentioned foundation. 
  Latvia's people staunchly reject several terms in the 
agreements judging by "thousands of letters with many 
signatures," Ulmanis noted. The very idea to create the military 
personnel repatriation foundation belongs to one of their 
authors. Taking into account the interior situation in Latvia 
and Russia, Latvia cannot try to begin talks on entirely new 
agreements on troop withdrawal, Ulmanis said. 
  Ulmanis quoted European politicians as praising the 
agreement 
on Russian troop withdrawal by Aug. 31 as a considerable 
achievement of the Latvian diplomacy. The signature of the troop 
withdrawal treaty is considered a basic prerequisite for 
Latvia's acceptance to the European Union, Ulmanis said. 
  Foreign Ministry's Parliamentary Secretary Martins Virsis, 
who accompanied Ulmanis to Europe, said that EU is unlikely to 
enroll countries that are unable to settle their relations with 
neighbors. Consequently, Latvia has to tackle the key problems 
in relations with Russia independently. Ulmanis prognosticated 
that Latvia could become EU associated member in 18 months. 
  During the trip, Ulmanis and European leaders also touched 
on 
the problems of citizenship in Latvia. EU member states should 
not prioritize the applicants' ethnic belonging in 
naturalization. The other criteria, like language skills and 
residence qualifications, are interior issues of each separate 
country.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 14, BNS -- Latvian Saeima [parliament] 
delegation handed Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs's 
letter to the European Council's Parliamentarian Assembly 
Tuesday [12 April] in Strasbourg. The letter is addressed to the 
Assembly's Secretary-General Catherine Lalumiere. The letter 
tells about events in Latvia, connected with Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin's April 5 order to set up military bases in CIS 
states and Latvia. The letter says that Latvian people consider 
the order to contradict the Latvian-Russian initialed agreements 
on Russian army withdrawal and the Skrunda radar station's 
status. 
  Latvian people think that Yeltsin's order jeopardizes 
Latvia's independence, says the letter. Though Russian 
Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh apologized for the incident and 
said that Latvia was mentioned in the list by mistake, Latvia 
still expects Russia to make an official retraction of the order. 
  While Latvia has not received the official retraction of 
Yeltsin's order, the planned April 20 talks between Latvian and 
Russian presidents and the signing of the initialed agreements 
are postponed.

  [Text] STRASBOURG, 14 Apr, BNS -- Abolition of the death 
penalty and relations with Russia dominated the questions that 
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas was asked after his 
speech in the CE [Council of Europe] Parliamentary Assembly 
Thursday [14 April]. There were also questions about the status 
of Poles and sexual minorities in Lithuania, as well as about 
the private TELE-3 TV station. 
  Answering a question on Russian transit to the Kaliningrad 
region through Lithuania, Brazauskas said he and Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin agreed that the problem would be 
discussed after a package of bilateral agreements between their 
countries is signed. The Lithuanian president claimed Russia's 
demand "to open an unrestricted corridor" through Lithuania is 
hardly understandable. 
  Commenting on Russia's statements about the "near abroad," 
Brazauskas said it would be best if Russia would explain itself 
the meaning of the concepts "near abroad" and "zone of 
influence." If a zone of influence means cultural and economic 
cooperation, Lithuania has interests in Russia, where some 
100,000 Lithuanians live since the times of Stalinism, he said. 
  Discussing the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic 
states, Brazauskas said the problem and Russia's admission to 
the CE are interrelated. In his view, the problem will be 
resolved this year. 
  Discussing the irreversibility of independence processes, 
the 
Lithuanian leader said he is an optimist and thinks that times 
of interfering with the internal affairs of a another country 
have passed. 
  Brazauskas confirmed that capital punishment still exists in 
Lithuania. The Lithuanian leader said three persons have been 
executed during his term of office, and two more convicts are on 
death row. The president noted that a virtually Soviet-type 
criminal code is still effective in Lithuania, but a new one is 
ready, according to which the death penalty would be applied 
only in special cases, such as cruel murder of several persons. 
Brazauskas expressed hope that the Lithuanian parliament will 
adopt the new criminal code this year. 
  Answering Polish representative Janusz Szymanski's question 
about the status of the Polish minority in Lithuania, Brazauskas 
said the rights of ethnic minorities in Lithuania are protected 
by the Constitution and other laws. The president also noted 
that the number of Poles in Lithuania is 270,000, but not 
400,000 as was indicated by the Polish lawmaker. 
  There is no international aspect in the status of the Polish 
minority in Lithuania, and all minor problems that do occur are 
successfully resolved by the governments, Brazauskas said. In 
his words, such problems, if they will occur, can be discussed 
during his upcoming meeting with Polish President Lech Walesa in 
Vilnius 26 April. 
  Estonia's representative asked about Lithuania's 
contribution 
to the creation of a Baltic peacekeeping battalion and its 
functions. Brazauskas said the battalion is primarily meant for 
maintaining peace in other "or maybe our regions." The president 
said a Baltic peacekeeping battalion should be ready for action 
after about a year. 
  Brazauskas said sexual minorities is not a problem requiring 
special attention in Lithuania. The president said he never 
dealt with any such problems, except knowing that punishment for 
homosexuality has been abolished in Lithuania. 
  A representative of Iceland asked whether it is true that 
the 
private TELE-3 TV is being closed down in Lithuania. Brazauskas 
answered that two out of three TV channels in Lithuania are 
commercial and nobody intends to close them down. "But 
transmitter rent has to be paid." 
  Brazauskas denied allegations that government positions are 
too widely represented in the Lithuanian press. "We have so 
much freedom that we don't even know how to make use of it," the 
president said. He noted, however, that the press "works hard, 
reveals much evil and helps the government."

Lithuanian Government is to be changed in the immediate future. 
All decisions will be made at closed meetings, and then the

  Such practice exists in many countries. This does not mean 
that government work will be secret. We free journalists from 
taking part in weary meetings, said the prime minister.

  [Text] VILNIUS, 14 Apr, BNS -- The latest round of 
Lithuanian-Russian talks on border delimitation was "extremely 
unproductive," said Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vladislovas Domarkas. Lithuanian and Russian negotiators met in 
Kaliningrad Wednesday [13 April]. 
  Domarkas, who headed the Lithuanian delegation, said the 
meeting was devoted to boundaries of territorial waters, land 
border and several versions of a draft agreement on 
Lithuanian-Russian state border. 
  Domarkas said completely no progress was made in any of the 
issues because "the demands were too high." 
  Zenonas Kumetaitis, head of the Lithuanian Geodesy Service, 
told Lithuanian TV that Russia unexpectedly decided to review 
border on the Kursiu peninsula. But in his words, sea border 
remains the main stumbling block in bilateral talks. 
  Lithuanian and Russian negotiators are scheduled to hold 
their next meeting after a month. 
  Domarkas said Lithuanian and Latvian delegations intend to 
discuss sea border problems at a round of talks 18 April.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "On Behalf of LDPR" rubric: </F>
"This Is What Zhirinovskiy Thinks..."] 
  [Text] The editorial board has received a letter from the 
Russian Liberal Democratic Party [LDPR] signed by its chairman 
V. Zhirinovskiy and A. Moiseyev, deputy of the State Duma of the 
Russian Federation, concerning the active debate on the future 
development of Kaliningrad Oblast among Russian and foreign 
circles. The letter states that no Russian can remain 
indifferent toward the oblast's future, because the latter is 
responsible for Russia's geopolitical situation, the reliability 
of its borders, and the stability of economic relations. The 
LDPR proceeds from the fact that the fate of Kaliningrad is a 
historical reality that emerged after World War II. Kaliningrad 
is part of Russia and it will remain so forever. 
  However, some people are currently trying to distort the 
official party stand by speaking about LDPR's alleged readiness 
to make concessions to other states in the Kaliningrad issue. 
This is an open fraud. Its aim is obvious -- to force the 
constituents to turn away from the party and degrade the 
importance of its victory in the 1993 parliamentary elections. 
Residents of Kaliningrad and its oblast must know that the LDPR 
speaks out for the immediate resolution of the regional economic 
problems, the buildup of the military and trade ports, the 
development of relations with foreign partners, and the 
surmounting of transit difficulties through the adjacent 
territory. 
  At the same time, the party notes that any economic reforms 
and experiments are senseless if they infringe upon the 
Russians' rights, who are turned into second-rate people 
attending to rich foreigners. Such reforms are doomed, and the 
LDPR will offer a tough resistance to them. 
  Enjoying support from millions of its constituents, the LDPR 
is ready to work in the interests of the residents of 
Kaliningrad and its oblast.

  [Text] Leader of the Liberal-Democratic Union of December 
12 (LDU) in parliament and former finance minister Boris Fedorov 
speaking in Moscow has outlined LDU's priorities. He said LDU 
must set sensible tasks, avoid giving hollow promises, wage a 
resolute campaign for national interests and move to prosperity 
by transforming the country's political and economic systems. 
He said LDU was a group of 26 independent deputies representing 
different parts of the country rather than being "an elitist 
Moscow club". 
  One other LDU leader Irina Khakamada said the faction's name 
was intended to help form its political image and reflect its 
determination to merge social and market reforms with a thrust 
towards the individual rather than talking about the abstract 
models of a so-called market economy. 
  On the political front, LDU is opposed to the hardliners' 
call for an early presidential election and prepared instead to 
back up the idea of a coalition government provided it is 
committed to further market reforms, democracy and a socially 
oriented state. LDU will not oppose the government while there 
is a chance for further constructive reforms, but any government 
without a social basis and majority in parliament is doomed, its 
platform says. 
  Among its potential allies, the group has named the 
Gaydar-led Russia's Choice Party and the Yavlinskiy-led faction 
though it is ready to cooperate with Women of Russia group and 
to hold an open dialogue with all pro-democracy movements. 
  At the same time, it says the name of the Zhirinovskiy-led 
Liberal Democratic Party does not reflect the substance and 
activity of the LDP leadership which brings nothing but disgrace 
to Russia. LDU says some support that LDP enjoys on the ground 
is evidence of a power crisis and lack of coherent political 
priorities in the country. 
  On the economic front, LDU's priorities include financial 
stabilization, a 1-3 percent inflation rate in 1994, a sensible 
budget, a one-off 15-25 percent tax cut to spur up business 
activity, reduction of the amount and types of taxation and 
government support for state companies yielding to modernization 
and work efficiency. 
  In foreign policy, LDU calls for a G-8 with Russian 
participation and Russia's reunification with Belarus and 
Ukraine following referendums there. However, LDU is opposed to 
what it calls "an absurd unification of monetary systems". 
Fedorov attacked the recent monetary merger between Moscow and 
Minsk calling the decision incompetent. He said economic 
integration must follow trade and customs unions as it was done 
in Western Europe but not start with a monetary union. In his 
view, unification must take place on all fronts with clear 
understanding of the purpose and price to be paid for it.

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- The Party of the Majority 
set up two months ago will not sign the draft memorandum on 
civic peace and accord, party leader Vyacheslav Grechaninov told 
a news conference in Moscow on Thursday. Grechaninov said that 
the authors of the document place it even "higher than the 
constitution." Additionally, it restricts the rights of 
parties, public associations and subjects of the federation. He 
strongly opposed the provisions rejecting political campaigning 
for elections to federal bodies of power and banning trade 
unions from organising strikes. The draft agreement also 
obliges the subjects of the federation to pledge not to change 
their status for two years. 
  Anatoliy Panfilov, leader of the Constructive Ecological 
Movement of Russia (KEDR), who also attended the news 
conference, said that his movement supports the position of the 
Party of the Majority and has no intention of signing the 
agreement. The Party of the Majority is currently negotiating 
with Panfilov's movement the possibility of joining forces to 
set up a united bloc for the next elections. At the same time, 
Grechaninov said that his party is ready to take part in the 
preparation of a "more serious" memorandum of accord.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Apr -- Sergey Glazyev, Andrey Golovin, 
Oleg Rumyantsev, Aleksandr Tsipko, Veniamin Sokolov and other 
politicians have announced the formation of a Russian movement, 
the People's Alliance [Narodnyy Alyans]. Members of the 
founding council have called upon their supporters in the 
provinces of the Russian Federation to start forming local 
structures of the movement. 
  Sergey Glazyev, one of the leaders of the People's Alliance 
and the chairman of the State Duma committee for economic 
policy, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent: "We are calling for a 
union, so that we may avert the final collapse of the Russian 
state, avert sedition, disintegration of the economy, moral and 
spiritual degradation." 
  He also said that the founders of the movement proceeded 
from 
the fact that "historically Russia developed as a multinational 
society within a single state which belongs equally to all 
peoples of our country, and the peoples of the former USSR 
retain their right to uniting in different ways on a voluntary 
basis, including political unification." 
  The statement of the People's Alliance says that a union of 
this kind can "prevent a relapse into authoritarianism." 
"Forming the policy and strategy of national reconciliation" 
was named as the main aim of the movement. It was stressed that 
the new sociopolitical movement "supports solely those reforms 
which stimulate the growth of production and strengthen the 
positions of Russian producers both in their own country and on 
the world market." 
  According to Sergey Glazyev, the People's Alliance regards 
establishing a true democracy in Russia as its aim. "At the same 
time, we are convinced that democracy must grow on a national 
soil, help strengthen people's dignity and teach them a 
conscious attitude to politics," he said. 
  The founders of the movement insist that traditions of 
parliamentarism should be carried further and reinforced, which, 
in their opinion, is in agreement with "Russia's traditions of 
popular assemblies [veche] and contributes to respect for the 
constitutional system, law and legislative activity."

<F P=106> [Leonid Nikitinskiy report: "Gorbachev Satisfied With His </F>
Position"] 
  [Text] Mikhail Gorbachev assembled a small group of 
journalists at his foundation to mark the 100th birthday of 
Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev. Khrushchev, in the estimation of 
Gorbachev, who began his party career under him, was an 
inconsistent and limited reformer, but nonetheless sincerely 
attempted to liberalize the totalitarian Stalinist system. From 
a subjective angle, it is possible to discern power struggle 
motives in his actions, but his speech against Stalin soon after 
the latter's death while his henchmen were still alive demanded 
great courage on Khrushchev's part, in its consequences "exposed 
the personality cult," and proved to be far more significant 
than simply intrigue. 
  This conversation was interesting to journalists in the 
light 
of the biography of Gorbachev himself, since he quickly passed 
from the "palace coup" of 1964 to 1991, when via similar 
apparatus means Gorbachev himself was twice removed from power: 
the first time in August -- unsuccessfully, the second, in 
December -- successfully. The ex-USSR president, who is now 
unlikely to be brought as a witnesses in the "SCSE [State 
Committee for the State of Emergency] case," imparted many 
details of the events, emphasizing the role of Boris Yeltsin in 
their development. It will soon be possible to read about this 
in Gorbachev's memoirs, which he has recently sent to his 
publishers. 
  In their questions the journalists tried to prompt their 
interlocutor further to project the recurring model of the 
"palace coup" onto the present day, onto the potential threat of 
the removal of President Yeltsin from real power. However, 
Mikhail Gorbachev did not wish to delve into even a theoretical 
analysis of this possibility. For all his undisguised negative 
attitude toward Yeltsin, Gorbachev does not allow himself to 
entertain the idea of his removal from power by other than legal 
means, through elections, which, however, in his opinion, could 
take place before 1996.

<F P=106> [Editorial announcement: "We Must Survive Along With You!"] </F>
  [Text] So, today's issue of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA is being 
produced with the funds collected by readers. But debts remain 
-- 250 million rubles [R] to the "Pressa" Publishing House and 
many millions to paper combines, printing centers, and partners 
in the newspaper's delivery. How did these debts arise? 
  It is known that production of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA was halted 
for two and one-half months during October-December 1993 because 
of the actions of the former Ministry of the Press and 
Information, which were subsequently deemed illegal in court. 
The editorial office incurred tremendous losses as a result of 
the abortive subscription campaign for the first half of 1994 
and was deprived of the revenue from advertising and retail 
sales -- in all, by the end of 1993 the loss exceeded R1.3 
billion. In addition, the editorial office's current account 
was frozen for a long time by a Central Bank directive, which 
the Superior Court of Arbitration deemed invalid -- this was how 
the chain of debts and unjustified sanctions in the form of 
fines arose. 
  At the same time we know that our readers have a very great 
need for the newspaper -- it has largely restored its readership 
in a short time: The number of subscribers has topped 270,000, 
and the total circulation is approaching half a million. A 
further 18,000 subscribers have joined us in April. But it is 
becoming increasingly costly to produce the newspaper. It now 
costs R25-30 million to produce a single issue. This is only at 
present! What is to be done?! Let us consult one another.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Pozdnyakov, deputy minister for </F>
nationalities affairs and regional policy, by Oleg Bondarenko; 
place and date not given: "How to Warm Up the Permafrost 
Region?"] 
  [Text] Having been until recently deputy chairman of the 
State Committee for the Socioeconomic Development of the North 
[Goskomsever], Aleksandr Pozdnyakov was directly responsible for 
the normal functioning of the most remote and inaccessible parts 
of our country. There had always been plenty of problems there 
even in quiet times, but now there are all the more. During the 
recent government reorganization the problems for which the 
Goskomsever had been responsible were transferred to the new 
Russian Federation Ministry for Nationalities Affairs and 
Regional Policy, where Pozdnyakov is deputy minister. 
  "Does this mean that concern for northerners is taking more 
and more of a back seat?" I asked Aleksandr Mikhaylovich. 
  [Pozdnyakov] Our former state committee was tasked above all 
with making maximum use of the brief summer shipping season to 
provide timely shipments of prime necessities to remote areas 
and to ensure that people could work uninterrupted during the 
long winter period. If there is any disorganization in this 
area, it will not be possible to avoid a major disaster -- after 
all, for most of the year these areas are cut off from the rest 
of Russia. 
  The Goskomsever also considered it its duty to protect 
before 
the federal authorities the interests of all those who find 
themselves remote from the "mainland." But it protected them on 
the basis of its actual abilities and in its own way -- most 
often it asked for additional funds to be allocated for certain 
measures. Problems were driven underground and covered up by 
additional spending, instead of eradicating the root cause that 
had given rise to them in the first place. 
  With our broad powers within the ministry today we are 
entirely capable of investigating all problems of territorial 
development and of resolving them by combining both local and 
federal interests. The first major discussion on our problems 
was conducted at a recent conference in Tambov. 
  Taking part in it were representatives of major 
interregional 
associations covering the historically established economic 
areas of the country. These include the center of Russia, the 
Northwest, the Volga, the North Caucasus, the Urals, Siberia, 
and the Far East. Within the framework of the associations they 
set up several years ago, republics, krays, oblasts, and 
autonomous okrugs have already amassed experience of 
cooperation, but the associations' relationships among 
themselves and with the federal authorities have still not been 
properly organized. The conference distributed the spheres of 
powers for each structure. 
  The government has not imposed its will on Federation 
components, but has consulted with them about how to be more 
successful in resolving the tasks of the country's further 
economic development. As a result, all the conference 
participants signed a document designed to avoid in the future 
the disappointing confrontation that has sometimes occurred 
between Moscow and a territory. 
  [Bondarenko] Some time ago the major Siberian Accord 
association was accused of having certain separatist tendencies. 
To what extent was this true? 
  [Pozdnyakov] I am well acquainted with the Siberians and I 
can assure you that they had no intention to engage in any kind 
of isolationism. The fact that statements by some of their 
representatives have voiced alarm and resentment about the lack 
of attention paid to their vital needs by the center is merely a 
reflection of reality. The unduly temperamental tone of the 
statements is also entirely explicable, and, indeed, it did have 
an effect. One way or another, both sides' positions have 
converged to a considerable extent. 
  [Bondarenko] How do you view the attempt by the leaders of 
the Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenetsk Okrugs to secede 
[obosobitsya] from Tyumen Oblast, of which they were part? 
  [Pozdnyakov] They can, of course, be understood. After all, 
the [oblast] center is in the south of the oblast, and the 
okrugs are in the permafrost region. Even though working and 
living conditions in the North are immeasurably more difficult, 
the lion's share of the okrugs' revenue from oil and gas 
previously went, apart from the capital, to Tyumen. But we are 
talking about natural resources -- a national asset rather than 
just the property of the extraction workers. It would hardly be 
right to close our eyes and pretend that there is no problem. A 
well-judged balance of interests should be maintained everywhere.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 14 April 
1994 carries on page 2 under the headline "Russia Has a Neutron 
Bomb the Size of a Small Ball, British TV Reporters Claim" a 
250-word REUTER report, which begins as follows: "Journalists 
from Britain's Channel 4 Television have carried out an 
investigation and concluded that Russian scientists have 
invented a miniature neutron bomb the size of a baseball. The 
device was developed using so-called `red mercury.'" The report 
goes on to give further details and concludes with the following 
note "from the Editorial Office": 
  "IZVESTIYA's correspondent Nikolay Burbyga turned for an 
explanation to ministries and departments involved with 
armaments. "`Needless to say, we have some secret developments 
[razrabotki],' the Russian Defense Ministry reported, `but what 
the British TV reporters are claiming is completely absurd -- it 
is shameful to even comment on it.' 
  "Equally categorical answers were obtained at the Kurchatov 
Institute. Specialists connected with future scientific arms 
developments claimed: `People have been talking about "red 
mercury" for a long time. But nobody has even seen it or 
"touched" it, because substances with these characteristics 
simply do not exist in nature....'" 
  Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 0956 GMT on 15 April, in a 
Mirniy (Arkhangelsk region)-datelined report by ITAR-TASS 
correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin, adds: "Reports about a `new 
Russian miniature bomb', allegedly developed with the use of 
`red mercury', are absolutely groundless," ITAR-TASS was told 
today by Lieutenant-General Yuriy Zhuravlev, chief of the state 
testing ground of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces. "Russia 
is not making or testing new types of nuclear weapons," he 
stressed.

  [Text] Grigoriy Karasin, an official representative of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry, dismissed on Thursday allegations by 
foreign media that Russia continues to work on the creation of 
biological weapons. Such publications "are clearly aimed at 
destroying mutual trust, and at aggravating relations between 
the signatories of the Convention banning biological weapons," 
he said at a briefing in Moscow. 
  Karasin noted that Russia as legal successor of the USSR 
took 
all responsibility for the implementation of the 1972 
Convention, including the functions of a guarantor of this 
document. Under the trilateral agreements between Russia, USA 
and Great Britain, mutual visits to biological facilities and 
exchange of information continue between the sides. 
  Karasin also said that Russia is in favor of the creation of 
a control mechanism for the implementation of the Convention. A 
special conference on this issue will be convened in Geneva in 
September.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast: Video report by Boris </F>
Kostenko; footage attributed to "Tonis" TV Company and captioned 
"Ukraine"] 
  [Text] [Kostenko] The problem of dismantling nuclear 
submarines which have come to the end of their service life is 
much more complex and dangerous than might appear at first 
sight. Despite a government decision dated 31 August 1992, 
funding of the construction in Nikolayev of a technical floating 
dock for dismantling submarines has been suspended. And that 
despite the fact that the facility is more than 60 percent 
finished. Construction of two specialized docks for overhauling 
nuclear reactors at Kherson shipyards has also been put on ice. 
  At present Russia has no docks where nuclear submarines can 
be dismantled and nuclear reactors removed. More than 200 
submarines are waiting in the North and the Far East. The spent 
nuclear fuel has not even been removed yet from more than 
one-third of them. Despite the fact that the reactors have been 
shut down, they must be constantly cooled. An accident at a 
submarine graveyard could produce another Chernobyl. 
  Some time ago construction of two of the urgently needed 
docks was started at Ukrainian shipyards. One is 30 percent 
ready, the other is already 65 percent ready. Contractors are 
owed 12 billion rubles. And yet, up to 80 percent of the 
appropriations set aside by the government is due to return to 
Russia, to the self-same contractors. 
  Perhaps the necessary resources should now be made available 
not from funds for disarmament purposes, but from funds set 
aside for environmental protection. Otherwise expenditure may 
have to be incurred to deal with an emergency situation, or even 
a catastrophe.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 15 TASS -- During the drafting of the 
1994 budget the Russian Government chose an intermediate way 
between a tough fiscal policy, which could help bring inflation 
down to 5 per cent a month, but would be too painful, and the 
policy of pumping money into the national economy, which could 
lead to a 50 per cent inflation, Acting Minister of Finance 
Sergey Dubinin said at the State Duma today, presenting the 
draft law "On the Federal Budget for 1994". He said that budget 
revenues were planned to reach 120.7 trillion roubles. The 
deficit will be 62.4 trillion roubles and the spendings will 
amount to 183.1 trillion. 
  Inflation continues to be "enemy No. 1", he continued. Now 
it is planned to remain on the level of 10 per cent a month and 
will be brought down to 7 per cent by the end of the year. 
Budget deficit for 1994 is planned to be 8 to 9 per cent of the 
gross domestic product. Part of the deficit -- about 6 per cent 
of the gross domestic product -- will be covered with the help 
of credits of the Central Bank. 
  Speaking about budget revenues, Dubinin pointed out that a 
dramatic increase in tax collecting can hardly be expected. 
Last year taxes accounted to 10 per cent of the gross domestic 
product for the federal budget and 14 per cent for regional 
budgets, while this year tax collecting is going to amount to 12 
per cent of gross domestic product. The speaker stressed that 
tough measures against tax evaders are expected to be taken. 
  There is one more complicated problem: In what way should 
the 
money, that came from privatization, be spent? The government 
is facing a difficult choice: Should it channel the 
privatization money to the federal budget, or should it leave it 
with the enterprises, so that they will be able to invest it? A 
final decision on that problem has not yet been taken. 
  According to Dubinin, discussion is going on over the 
problem 
of what part of the federal budget should be channelled to 
subjects of the Federation. Now 22 per cent of the value added 
tax will be spent for that purpose. 
  Speaking about the distribution of budget spendings, Dubinin 
said that 48.5 trillion roubles would be spent on defence and 
law-enforcement agencies, 48.1 trillion -- on state support for 
individual branches of the national economy, 24.5 trillion -- on 
assistance to the regions, 16.8 trillion -- on the federal debt 
servicing and 12.2 trillion -- on social programmes.

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- "The government has not 
considered the issue of imposing a tax upon foreign 
investments", Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets 
told TASS on Thursday. Soskovets dismissed reports by some mass 
media that the government was drafting a document to raise 
import duties. He noted, however, that following the recent 
rise in import tariffs, "a commission will be set up to specify 
these issues". 
  The first deputy prime minister believes the draft federal 
budget for 1994, which was submitted by the government to the 
State Duma, should be taken as a basis. He is confident that 
this document provides a most thorough analysis of all items of 
revenues and expenditures. The draft budget "is to be finalized 
and approved within the next few weeks", Soskovets reported. 
"For the time being, the government has to manage with the 
quarter budget", he said. The first vice-premier declined to 
give any comments as concerns wage indexation for 
state-subsidized industries in the second quarter of 1994. He 
admitted, however, that the government did not have the 
necessary resources.

<F P=106> [Undated statement by the Russian Social Protection Ministry </F>
under the "Officially" rubric: "On Pension Indexation and 
Compensation"] 
  [Text] In connection with the appearance in certain mass 
media of a report about the Russian Federation Pension Fund's 
so-called "denial" regarding the question of pension indexation 
from 1 May this year, the Russian Social Protection Ministry 
considers it necessary to state the following. 
  The Russian Federation Pension Fund is a financial and 
credit 
institution, therefore the explanation and interpretation of 
pension legislation does not come within this organ's terms of 
reference. All necessary information on questions of applying 
existing pension legislation, as well as on normative acts being 
drafted in this sphere, is given by the Russian Federation 
Ministry for the Social Protection of the Population. 
  The Russian Social Protection Ministry confirms the 
information given at a press conference 9 April 1994 that from 1 
May this year the implementation of the Russian Federation 
president's edict No. 2121 of 10 December 1993 "On Increasing 
Previously Fixed Labor Pensions," begun 1 April this year, will 
be continued. 
  Under this edict earnings before 1 January 1993 on which 
pensions are calculated are subject to an 80-percent indexation 
(increase). This measure is intended to rectify the 
miscalculations made when determining the size of the 
coefficients used to "index-link" past earnings. 
  This provision is being brought into effect in three stages 
from April through June 1994: from 1 April in relation to 
pensions fixed up to and including 1981; from 1 May in relation 
to pensions fixed in 1982-1987; and from 1 June in relation to 
pensions fixed in 1988-1992. 
  From 1 May this year there will be another indexation 
because 
of the increase in prices for consumer goods and services. The 
actual level of indexation is being determined at the moment. 
In addition it is intended to retain the existing compensation 
of 19,700 rubles payable in addition to a pension. 
  Indexation and retained compensation because of price 
increases will be payable over and above the level of a pension 
increased under the Russian Federation president's edict of 10 
December 1993. 
  [Signed] Russian Social Protection Ministry Press Service 
  In addition, the ministry clarified that the maximum pension 
is three times the minimum pension, not counting compensation.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- An extraordinary situation 
has formed with power supply in Russia. Strategic reserves of 
masout and coal dwindle. Anatoliy Dyakov, president of the 
Russian joint-stock company "The Russian Power Grid", 
corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told 
ITAR-TASS. The overspending of these kinds of fuel at power 
stations made up over 300 thousand tonnes in March and over 116 
thousand tonnes in April. 
  The emergency situation is largely caused by huge 
non-payments the power-generating industry, running into 3,600 
billion roubles. Being short of funds, the branch ran up a debt 
to fuel suppliers, owing about one thousand billion roubles for 
gas. Because of this, gas suppliers broke the agreement to 
deliver gas to power stations even if there is non-payment. Gas 
supplies dropped by over 600 million cubic metres in March. 
This resulted in the stoppage of a number of large power plants 
at thermal power stations. Half their number use gas for fuel. 
The situation has aggravated further because of the drop by 
1,250 million kilowatt-hours of electricity at nuclear power 
plants, the drop that has not been sanctioned by "The Russian 
Power Grid" joint-stock company. Managers of nuclear power 
plants explain this by the lack of fuel. 
  Dyakov said these factors explain the rapid dwindling of 
stocks of fuel at power stations. Not even the use of strategic 
reserves can fully compensate for gas shortages, he said. Due 
to this it is necessary to cut fuel supply to industrial 
enterprises in the Transbaikalia, Siberia and Transcaucasia.

<F P=106> ["Express Analysis" report by A. Yevgenyev: "Inflation </F>
Curbed. But..."] 
  [Text] The State Committee for Statistics has prepared 
some useful data illustrative of the socioeconomic situation in 
Russia in January-March. Compared with the corresponding period 
last year the gross domestic product is 17 percent down. The 
decline in industry is worsening, with production volume in 
physical terms standing at 75.1 percent of last year's level, 
the figures for the specific months being 76.9 percent in 
January, 75.9 in February, and 72.6 in March. 
  According to State Committee for Statistics experts, the 
structural nature of the production decline became evident in 
the first quarter. This was manifested by the fact that the 
scale of it is increasingly determined by effective demand, not 
by resource potential. As a result, sectors reacted differently 
to the developing market situation. Whereas gas extraction 
virtually remained at last year's level, 9-15 percent less oil 
and coal was extracted. At the same time, production of many of 
the basic types of machine-building products and a number of 
light industry goods almost halved, chemical production fell by 
25-30 percent, and ferrous metallurgy production fell by 20-35 
percent. Food production fell by 10-20 percent. 
  Of the 406 most important types of products included in the 
special report, 26 saw an increase in production volume and 373 
items saw a decrease. Individual production processes were 
halted at 5,000 enterprises. But whereas at the beginning of 
the last year this was mainly due to lack of raw materials, 
supplies, and fuel, the main reason now is different -- problems 
marketing products (more than 60 percent of all losses). 
  Unfortunately, there is a mounting crisis in the sectors 
producing consumer goods. Garment production has been 
particularly badly hit: Production of overcoats, short coats, 
and skirts fell by 61-68 percent; production of raincoats and 
jackets fell by 53-58 percent, and production of pants and suits 
fell by 41-42 percent. Fewer goods were produced for private 
farms, subsidiary plots, and horticultural enterprises: 
Production of front-wheel-drive tractors and rotovators fell by 
10 percent, and of compact tractors by more than 25 percent. 
  Livestock raising output is falling. According to the data, 
the volume of sales of livestock and poultry by all categories 
of farms fell by 13 percent, milk production fell by nine 
percent, and egg production by six percent. 
  Russia's favorable balance in trade with far-off foreign 
parts is increasing. Although not so much through increased 
exports (they rose by 2.9 percent, reaching $8.9 billion), as 
through a reduction in imports (27 percent down on the first 
quarter of last year, the total volume being $3.8 billion). 
  As for prices of goods and services, they rose by 44 percent 
in the third [as published] quarter. This is one of the 
smallest increases since the beginning of the economic reform. 
Average pay in March was 160,000 rubles [R]. The disposable 
income of the population (income excluding obligatory payments), 
taking into account the consumer prices index, rose by 
approximately 10 percent over the year. But the incomes of 17 
percent of the population (that is, 25.2 million people) were 
below the poverty line in the first quarter of 1994, while in 
six percent of cases incomes did not even meet the cost of the 
basic essential foods, which is set at R37,000.

of trancport, has told RIA that the government of the Russian 
Federation has signed a decision on the flotation of the 
Aeroflot Russian International Airlines air company. He said 
that the decision was signed two days ago and noted that, under 
the document, each of Aeroflot's four subsidiary companies can 
now regard itself as independent. However, Vladimir Potapov, 
president of Aeroflot's international division, told RIA that he 
had not seen the document relating to the airline's flotation 
and, therefore, could not comment on it.

<F P=106> [A. Yevgenyev "Commentary": "Fighting Monopolies: Act Two"] </F>
  [Text] Someone has already made the following somewhat 
sarcastic comment about the "State Program for the 
Demonopolization of the Economy and the Development of 
Competition on the Russian Federation Markets": It will outlive 
the people who produced it. I must admit that the cavalry 
charge on Russian monopolies came to nothing. Attempts to put 
the 2,000 enterprises which dominate the national market on a 
separate register and change their economic behavior by means of 
state regulation have not worked as expected. No one was 
particularly frightened by the barrier in the form of 
profitability threshold. Enterprises learned easily to bypass 
it, generally by artificially inflating costs. It is time to 
adjust tactics. 
  The main purpose of the program that has been formulated is 
to change the actual monopolized structure of our market which 
developed during the reign of the administrative edict system. 
The Antimonopoly Committee alone is not up to the job. The 
territories and sectors need to take part, and the legislative 
base must be broadened. The new program makes provision for all 
that. It does not duplicate but supplements the well-known Law 
"On Competition and on Restricting Monopolist Activity on 
Commodity Markets." The plan is to draft a whole package of 
legislative acts that will promote the development of 
competition in various spheres of economic life. And it is 
proposed to start with the Law "On Monopolies." 
  As for so-called temporary monopolies, the intention is to 
bring pressure to bear upon them -- not by restrictions or fines 
(the well-known register ceased to exist 1 January) but by 
creating a competitive environment, taking each individual case 
on its merits. Sectors and territories formulating and 
coordinating their demonopolization programs are to decide how 
specifically this is to be done. If there is a metalworking 
plant in an oblast, for instance, which meets the oblast's 
needs, this does not mean that another one should immediately be 
built in the neighborhood. It may be more advisable to convert 
a former "secret institution" and create sound competition. But 
representatives of sectors and regions must decide what is 
better and more effective by coming face to face at a 
"roundtable." An Interdepartmental Commission for Competition 
Policy led by First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets has been set up 
to coordinate their interests. 
  There is another reason for such extensive representation, 
Izabella Fomina, head of the State Committee for Anti-Monopoly 
Policy and Support of the New Economic Structures Scientific and 
Technical Administration, thinks. Imagine the Ministry of 
Communications and the Ministry of Fuel and Energy examining a 
plan for the demonopolization of their sectors, while their 
customers sit alongside and are able to evaluate all this 
because they deal with these highly monopolized departments' 
prices every day. 
  Of course, you cannot tackle everything. That is why, along 
with general targets and recommendations, the program highlights 
the priorities -- transport (apart from railroad transport), 
communications, machine building, and construction.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pozdnyakov report in the "Special Case" column: </F>
"A Criminal Case Has Been Opened Against the Russian State TV 
and Radio Company Petersburg-Channel 5. Mr. Pravdyuk Blames 
Everything on 'National-Patriots, Communists, and Above All 
Zionists'"] 
  [Text] The St. Petersburg Main Internal Affairs 
Directorate's economic crimes department has presented to the 
city Prosecutor's Office the results of an examination into a 
statement by a group of State Duma deputies about illegal 
activity by Bella Kurkova, chairperson of the Russian State TV 
and Radio Company [RSTVRC] Petersburg-Channel 5; and her 
husband, Vadim Tareyev, with an inscription, "For initiating 
criminal prosecution." 
  This action is based on testimony by Valeriy Mikhaylov, 
director of the joint stock company Commercial TV and Radio 
Center of St. Petersburg, who alleged that Mrs. Kurkova extorted 
sponsorship from him for Mr. Tareyev's private enterprise. 
According to Mikhaylov, "the Russian General Prosecutor's 
Office, which demanded part of the materials to be sent to 
Moscow for study," has also shown interest in the investigation 
results. 
  The leadership of the RSTVRC Petersburg-Channel 5 has 
reacted 
in a peculiar manner. In an interview with the city daily 
VECHERNIY PETERBURG, RSTVRC First Deputy Chairman Viktor 
Pravdyuk put forward several mutually exclusive ideas as to who 
is to blame for the trouble that has occurred with the RSTVRC 
Petersburg-Channel 5 executives. Mr. Pravdyuk stated that "the 
provocation against St. Petersburg TV" was organized by former 
TV and Radio Company employees led by Mikhail Syroyezhin, 
Kurkova's former deputy for advertising. Viktor Pravdyuk said 
that the "provocateurs are national patriots and communists 
seeking to place TV broadcasting under their control at any 
price, and, most important, Zionists and the NTV company, which 
articulates their interests." 
  The paradoxical thinking of Kurkova's first deputy, who has 
constructed an elaborate legend about Russian nationalists 
trying, with the help of Jewish money, to remove democrats from 
top executive positions at RSTVRC Petersburg-Channel 5, has 
surprised many observers. Even so, a measure of ambiguity in 
Mr. Pravdyuk's perception of reality may be due to the anxious 
anticipation of the results of an investigation into a criminal 
case which the St. Petersburg Prosecutor's Office is most likely 
to open against Mrs. Kurkova. Within the next few days 
documents will be presented to the Prosecutor's Office about 
foreign bank accounts held by some modest civil servants closely 
linked with the leadership of the State TV and Radio Company 
Petersburg-Channel 5.

<F P=106> [Statement by S. Ginzburg, chief of the Information Studies </F>
Department at the Oblast Administration, under the "Apropos One 
Appeal" rubric: "There Is No Need To Spread Panic"] 
  [Text] Recently, certain political forces have made 
attempts to discredit the idea of the imperative adoption of the 
law "On the Status of Kaliningrad Oblast." At the same time, it 
turns out that this move will be responsible for our political 
distancing from Russia, will promote Germanization of the 
oblast, and so on. The emergence of such statements on the eve 
of debates on this draft law in the Federal Assembly is 
worrisome. Therefore, I consider it necessary to focus on the 
following: 
  1. The draft law "On the Status of Kaliningrad Oblast" was 
prepared by the Oblast Administration in cooperation with the 
Oblast Soviet of People's Deputies and promulgated for public 
consideration in the 6 August 1993 issue of KALININGRADSKAYA 
PRAVDA. Later, the draft law was brought in line with the 
Constitution of the Russian Federation adopted on 12 December 
1993, the current law of the Russian Federation, No. 2117 decree 
of the Russian president of 7 December 1993 "On Kaliningrad 
Oblast," and proposals of ministries and departments concerning 
its first reading. 
  2. If it is adopted, the law will establish the status of 
our oblast as a territory of the Russian Federation separated by 
other territories from its proper area. The term status in this 
case implies the legal situation of Kaliningrad Oblast within 
Russia, defined by specific conditions for economic activities. 
Moreover, the status will conform with the oblast's 
geopolitical, social, and economic position, and will provide 
for additional guarantees in protecting the rights of Russian 
citizens on its territory. 
  3. All talk about the oblast's distancing from Russia are 
unfounded. Those who claim this, have either not read the draft 
law or are deliberately misleading Kaliningrad inhabitants. For 
example, the first article entitled "Kaliningrad Oblast Within 
the Russian Federation" clearly states that our oblast is an 
inseparable part of Russia, that its frontiers coincide with the 
state border of the Russian Federation, and that its territory 
has a particular place in ensuring Russia's security system. 
  Furthermore, the last version of the draft law notes that it 
bans the activities of any political parties, organizations, and 
individuals in Kaliningrad Oblast, which run counter to 
international legal norms that establish Russia's authority over 
this territory as final. 
  4. Speculation about the law facilitating the purchase of 
land by foreigners, which would allegedly promote Germanization 
of the oblast, are groundless. In fact, Article 36 of the 
Constitution of the Russian Federation reads that land in Russia 
(that is, also in Kaliningrad Oblast) can be owned only by 
citizens of the Russian Federation and not by any foreign 
residents. In other words, this is a citizen's rather than a 
human right. 
  The draft law on the status of Kaliningrad Oblast reflects 
all the key peculiarities of our unique region. The sooner this 
law is adopted, the sooner the oblast will gain political and 
economic guarantees. I think that in such a situation some 
esteemed deputies should direct their efforts to the consistent 
protection of the interests of our oblast rather than to 
spreading panic.

<F P=106> [Statement by the press center of the Kaliningrad Oblast </F>
Administration under the "Official" rubric] 
  [Text] The 31 March 1994 issue of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA 
published an article entitled "Matochkin's Den." The article 
was written by the same authors who prepared the publication 
"The Amber Chamber for General Dunayev" in September 1993. The 
press center of the Kaliningrad Oblast Administration is 
authorized to make the following statement: 
  1. An inquiry into the facts contained in the aforementioned 
article was conducted by procuracy. The inquiry did not confirm 
that these facts were linked with the head of the Kaliningrad 
Oblast Administration [Yuriy Matochkin]. 
  Y. S. Matochkin has brought an action against the newspaper 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. Currently, the case is being investigated 
by the Krasnopresnenskiy people's court in Moscow. The 
respondent (KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA) has not appeared before the 
court for a single meeting. 
  2. After the head of the Oblast Administration had sued the 
newspaper, he received proposals through different channels to 
withdraw his action. Otherwise, they promised to launch a 
series of publications "unmasking" him. It is common knowledge 
that the authors of the given article were in Kaliningrad 
between February and March 1994, when they engaged in collecting 
"discrediting" information. The fact that the authors did not 
try to meet with either law enforcement officials or the head of 
the administration demonstrates their specific orientation. 
  3. Regarding the contents of the article, it does not 
contain a single new fact unknown to the public. The authors 
again return to the story about the funds and the establishment 
of the RIFK "Alliance." There are the decisions of the 
prosecutor, law enforcement institutions, and the Oblast Soviet 
of People's Deputies concerning these issues. 
  4. In our opinion, the emergence of this publication is a 
continuation of the planned campaign by a group of defeated 
local politicians and representatives of semi-Mafia and Mafia 
structures, seeking to seize power in the region. They must be 
eager to have a submissive person as oblast leader, so as to be 
able to engage in illegal operations unpunished. It is no 
accident that attacks on the head of the administration 
intensified after his attempts to impose order in the sale of 
amber, toughen controls on customs, and vitalize the tax policy. 
  Given the fact that any calls for honesty and decency are 
meaningless with regard to the authors and those who ordered 
this publication, the head of the administration reserves the 
right to defend his honor and dignity through legal channels.

  [Text] The North Ossetian and Ingush teams negotiating in 
the Kabardino-Balkarian capital Nalchik agreed on April 14 on 
the preamble of a final document, a treaty on helping the 
refugees in their republics return to their homes, as envisaged 
by the Russian president's decree. 
  Vladimir Lozovoy, head of the interim administration in the 
emergency-rule zone, said at a news conference in Nalchik 
Thursday night that adoption of the preamble was the main 
achievement of the day. He said that the two sides had, at 
last, developed the guidelines for further talks. In 
particular, the preamble condemns all kinds of extremism and 
activities of those who triggered the violence in North Ossetia 
in the fall of 1992. The preamble also says that the two sides 
will abide by the Russian Federation's Constitution and 
ordinances of the Russian government in resolving their problems. 
  Lozovoy also said that the North Ossetian and Ingush 
negotiating teams headed by Presidents Akhsarbek Galazov and 
Ruslan Aushev would continue discussion of the draft accord 
article by article. The talks were expected to resume in the 
Kabardino-Balkarian president's country residence at 11:00 
Friday. 
  Lozovoy said that even though the issues under discussion 
were not easy, the atmosphere of the talks was polite and 
benevolent. Speaking on the April 12 capture of Ingush hostages 
in North Ossetia, Lozovoy said that North Ossetian law 
enforcement agencies had been keeping three Ingushis suspected 
of crimes committed in the republic. They are in the custody of 
the North Ossetian Prosecutor's Office.

  [Dudayev] We have never refused to do this, never. We were 
never against interaction, meetings, political decisions, 
cooperation. But the situation in Russia is very complicated at 
the moment. And it is getting even more difficult. President 
Yeltsin is being deprived from working on his own. In fact, 
Russia has no firm foreign or domestic policy. One does not 
know with whom one should negotiate. There are dozens of 
delegations, representations from all sorts of parties and 
factions, and everyone tries to grab a piece of the action. And 
this presents the main difficulty. [end recording]

  [Text] Russian Deputy Economics Minister, Valeriy Fateyev, 
called for urgent renewal of talks between Russia and Chechnya. 
He suggested in an interview with Interfax today that the 
Federation Council must recognize the legitimate character of 
the presidency of Johar Dudayev and send a delegation for talks 
on all issues concerning Russian-Chechen relations. 
  As the Head of the Russian parliamentary delegation Fateyev 
visited the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict, the Chechen 
Republic and met Chechen President Johar Dudayev on his own 
initiative. Fateyev examined the present situation in Chechnya. 
  "What doubts could there be about the legitimacy of 
Dudayev's 
presidency after the three years of his being in power?" Fateyev 
wondered. He believes that recognition of Chechen President 
Johar Dudayev by Moscow would be a move towards normalization of 
the situation which will bring significant positive results. 
"The attempts by the Russian leadership to negotiate with the 
Chechen opposition and to make signing of the bilateral treaty 
conditional on early parliamentary and presidential elections 
will be of no use to Russia," Fateyev emphasized. He considered 
this to be a syndrome of imperial policy. 
  Fateyev suggested that for the time-being the Russian 
leadership had no definite position on the Chechen issue but 
certain politicians were trying to use it in their own political 
interests. "This is manifested in the fact that very few people 
are concerned over diametrically opposite statements which a 
politician may make on this issue," Fateyev remarked. He said 
these people were mostly concerned over their image. 
  Speaking on his impressions from the meetings with President 
Dudayev, Fateyev defined him as a complex and strong person with 
a strong will. "It is important for Russia that this will be 
used in its interests," Fateyev stressed. 
  "The economic situation is the main factor of the state 
leadership's capacities. The economic situation in Chechnya is 
manageable and under control. Certainly, it goes through a 
crisis. Certainly, there is a decline but not a catastrophic 
one, Fateyev concluded.

<F P=106> [Natalya Gorodetskaya report in the "Restoration" column: </F>
"Mordovia's Supreme Soviet Has Restored District and City 
Soviets. The Government Is Against but It Is Ignored"] 
  [Text] Mordovia's Supreme Soviet, periodically stirring the 
public with loud scandals -- now setting up the republic's 
Constitutional Court to help remove the president from his post, 
now abolishing it quickly ostensibly as "useless" -- has decided 
again to make itself known. Relying on the Russian Federation 
State Duma's and president's permission, a Supreme Soviet 
session moved elections to the Legislative Assembly from 5 June 
to 27 November although the election campaign has been in full 
swing, with more than 350 candidates nominated to 75 seats. The 
Supreme Soviet motivated its decision by suggesting that 
simultaneous elections to the Legislative Assembly and local 
power bodies will be less expensive for the taxpayers. 
Generally, the wish to save public funds is quite laudable 
except that no one has consulted the people about the fourth 
shift in the election date. 
  On 11 April Mordovia's Supreme Soviet Presidium met to 
discuss its further actions. Quite naturally the subject of 
discussion was that the executive branch in general and 
administration chiefs in particular have gotten completely out 
of hand, and after the "illegal dissolution of the soviets" 
there is no one to oversee them. The Supreme Soviet Presidium 
then found an easy and foolproof method to control 
administration heads. It was decided to elect district and city 
presidiums from among former deputies of district and cities 
soviets, up to 25 people, vesting them with oversight functions. 
Under the interim regulations On Chairmen and Presidiums of 
District and City Deputies Assemblies, they are to approve the 
local budget and report on its execution; impose local taxes and 
charges; approve programs for the development of corresponding 
territories; amend the local self-government charter; oversee 
the activity of the administration head; sanction the 
appointment of administration head and other officials, and so 
forth. 
  Republic Prosecutor Pavel Senkin, who was present at the 
Supreme Soviet Presidium session, warned the house against 
voting to restore soviet power because this contradicts the 
Russian Federation Constitution and Boris Yeltsin's edict on 
reforming the soviets. Supreme Soviet Chairman Nikolay Biryukov, 
however, feeling his colleagues' support, stated that "no matter 
whether our decision is legal or not, as we shall vote, so it 
will be." The "yes" vote was practically unanimous. 
  The scandal in Mordovia is growing and has already reached 
Moscow. The republic's prosecutor, upholding legality, has 
appealed against the Presidium's actions to the Russian General 
Prosecutor's Office. Valentin Konakov, the president's 
representative in Mordovia, in a telephone conversation with 
SEGODNYA's correspondent, assessed the decision by the Supreme 
Soviet Presidium as "restoration of soviet power in full volume 
on a communist basis," stemming from the "desire to preserve 
their powers to the utmost," moreover, by "exceeding these 
powers." According to him, the decision is "an unconstitutional 
act and it does not agree with Boris Yeltsin's edict on local 
self-government," a fact he noted in his memorandum yesterday to 
the presidential administration. 
  A similar reaction to the emerging setup has come from 
administration chiefs who refuse to take their orders from the 
soviets. The republican government appraised the Supreme Soviet 
Presidium's decision as interference in its affairs. Yesterday 
in Saransk a joint session of the government and administration 
chiefs was held, ruling, in view of the fact that there is no 
constitutional court in the republic, to request the Russian 
Federation president to look into the "legality and 
constitutionality" of the Mordovia Supreme Soviet Presidium's 
resolution. Mordovia's government decided "not to implement the 
Supreme Soviet Presidium resolution pending the president's 
decision." The administration heads were told to be guided in 
their activity by the latest resolution of the Council of 
Ministers, not the Supreme Soviet Presidium. In addition, an 
enlarged session of administration chiefs and the government 
decided to ask Mordovia's Supreme Soviet, the Russian Federation 
president, and the Russian Federal Assembly to move elections to 
the republican Legislative Assembly back to 5 June.

  [Text] As always, the subject of the Kurils remains 
topical. On this occasion, the SOVETSKIY SAKHALIN newspaper 
reports that apparently not only Japan, but also the Maritime 
Kray is laying claim to the southern Kurils. At a March press 
conference in Vladivostok, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, governor of the 
Maritime Kray, said the Kurils should be economically 
subordinated to the Maritime Kray. He added that the Maritime 
Kray economy would gladly accept the Kurils. 
  SOVETSKIY SAKHALIN says this interest is understandable 
since 
a significant amount of foreign-currency-earning raw material 
resources from the far east are obtained in this region. As far 
as the Kurils' own economy is concerned, its neighbors are 
hardly prepared, or able, to take upon themselves the problems 
of the Kuril residents. It is not easy being the inhabitants of 
the disputed islands, writes SOVETSKIY SAKHALIN.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tuva [Tyva] Republic President Sherig-ool </F>
Oorzhak by Viktor Serov; date, place not given: "Accountable to 
the People. Tuva Republic President Sherig-ool Oorzhak Answers 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA Correspondent's Questions"] 
  [Text] [Oorzhak] The political situation in our republic 
is stable. Needless to say there are plenty of problems, but 
there are no strikes or interethnic friction. We have adopted 
our own Constitution -- 54 percent of the registered voters 
voted for it. Typically, "Russian" rayons voted in the same way 
as "Tuvan" rayons. 
  [Serov] Does the Tuva Constitution coincide with Russia's 
Constitution on the fundamental points? 
  [Oorzhak] There are three differences -- and fundamental 
ones at that. First, we have enshrined the republic's 
self-determination -- up to and including secession. But that 
does not mean of course that anyone intends to leave Russia 
today. 
  Second, according to last April's referendum, land is not 
for 
sale in our republic. You can understand why: The republic has 
1.5 million livestock that graze throughout its territory and so 
it cannot be divided up into squares. Although a decision on 
buying and selling land within cities and villages may quite 
possibly be adopted in order for people to build homes and for 
dacha plots and garages. 
  Third, we have our own system that determines the conditions 
for the existence of all branches of power. The main 
requirement here being periodic accountability and 
replaceability. Unlike Russian regulations, for instance, a 
judge can be elected for a maximum of two five-year terms. But 
he can receive a vote of no-confidence prior to that. Any other 
approach is impossible in a republic with strong kinship and 
clan customs and traditions which may give rise to corruption. 
And as president and head of the executive I am 
constitutionally strictly accountable. 
  After the long CPSU monopoly we must particularly defend 
democracy in order to ensure that the new generation can grow up 
in different -- democratic -- conditions. 
  [Serov] Is there a guarantee that there will not be forces 
wanting to take advantage of the relevant paragraph of Tuva's 
Constitution and proclaim the slogan "Let Us Secede!"? 
  [Oorzhak] There is a guarantee. Our Constitution enshrines 
the idea that, on the basis of the Federation Treaty, Tuva is 
part of Russia, which acknowledges our republic's sovereignty. 
  [Serov] What is your attitude toward political and economic 
autonomy for parts of Siberia? What are the possible parameters 
of this autonomy? 
  [Oorzhak] Republics, krays, and oblasts must undoubtedly 
have equal political and economic rights. As for relations with 
the center, the regions must voluntarily delegate to it the 
resolution of those problems which they themselves cannot handle 
(the army, communications, transportation, power engineering, 
higher education, etc). 
  A law is needed on the mechanism for the implementation of 
the Federation Treaty. It is necessary to clearly determine 
what is delegated to whom, who tackles what, to whom the land 
and mineral deposits belong, and the center's role. The 
adoption of this law can be organized by the upper chamber of 
parliament and the Committee for Federation Affairs, the 
Federation Treaty, and Regional Policy.

<F P=106> [Press release of the Press Center of the Maritime Kray </F>
Administration: "Meeting in Seoul--Specific Results. The Far 
East, Siberia, and Korea: Paths of Regional Cooperation"] 
  [Text] The third joint conference of the Association for 
Cooperation Between the Republic of Korea and Russia's Far East 
and Siberia (AKRS) and the Committee for Cooperation Between the 
Far East, Siberia, and the Republic of Korea (KRKS) has been 
held in Seoul. Head of the Kray Administration Yevgeniy 
Nazdratenko, his deputy for foreign economic activities, 
Vladimir Stegniy, and Chairman of the Committee for Foreign 
Economic and Regional Relations Andrey Zagumennov took part in 
the proceedings of the conference representing the Maritime area. 
  The Joint Statement, the draft of a technology park in the 
Nakhodka Free Economic Zone which is ready for the stage of 
technical and economic feasibility study, and the organization 
of the Korean College at the facilities of the Far Eastern State 
University were the results of the Korean-Russian conference. 
  As Vladimir Stegniy stated, the conference in Seoul 
proceeded 
under the leadership of KRKS Chairman Yevgeniy Nazdratenko and 
AKRS Chairman Chang Yi-haek. Some 300 prominent representatives 
of the statesman and business communities of the two states took 
part in the conference. The parties found it feasible to form a 
specific economic zone in Northeastern Asia and in the basin of 
the Sea of Japan with the participation of countries such as 
Russia, China, and Japan. In the process, the need to use the 
significant geopolitical situation of the Far East in an optimal 
way was stressed. 
  The parties agreed to approach their governments with a 
proposal to establish a private-governmental Joint Committee for 
the Far East and Siberia under the Russian Intergovernmental 
Commission for Economic Cooperation. The committee in question 
could engage in resolving differences and overcoming 
difficulties that develop in the course of effecting 
commercial-economic, investment, scientific- technical, and 
cultural cooperation between the Republic of Korea and Russia's 
Far East and Siberia. 
  It was resolved to seek that the relevant authorities of the 
two states begin regular flights between Vladivostok and Seoul 
in 1994, as well as regular flights between Korea and Sakhalin, 
Irkutsk, Novosibirsk, and Kamchatka Oblasts in the future. The 
parties agreed to facilitate the creation of customs warehouses 
in the principal seaports and air terminals of the Far East and 
to make efforts to improve the operation of the Transsiberian 
Railroad. 
  It is planned to hold the Fourth Joint Conference in Irkutsk 
in 1995.

  [Text] Simferopol, 14 Apr -- Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov has issued a number of decrees appointing Anatoliy 
Franchuk, former first deputy chairman of the Crimean Cabinet of 
Ministers, as acting minister for the management of state 
enterprises in Crimea, and Lyudmila Zaytseva, as acting minister 
of finance. Andriy Chernyavskiy is appointed Crimea's acting 
minister of economy. Decrees have been issued on the dismissal 
of Militia Major General Oleksandr Plyuta, Crimea's internal 
affairs minister, and his replacement with Army Major General 
Valeriy Kuznetsov known for his dismissal from the post of 
Crimean Army Corps Commander in 1994 for his failure to obey a 
decree by the Ukrainian defense minister. Another President 
Meshkov decree dismisses General Ivan Kolomyytsev, head of 
Crimea's security service, and replaces him with Retired Major 
General Volodymyr Lepikhov from the Crimean presidential staff. 
  Personnel of Crimea's Internal Affairs Ministry and Security 
Service have refused to comply with Meshkov's decrees. The 
premises of these departments are surrounded by unidentified 
armed individuals (according to some observers, the Crimean 
president's so-called personal bodyguards). The dismissed 
generals, Plyuta and Kolomyytsev, are guarded by their 
supporters. 
  The Crimean president's decrees are subject to the Crimean 
Supreme Council's approval at its next session on 10 May. 
According to the law, the issued decrees contradict the 
Constitutions of both Ukraine and Crimea, as well as the law of 
Ukraine on the division of powers between state power bodies of 
Ukraine and Crimea, said Crimea's Supreme Council Chairman 
Mykola Bahrov.

  [Text] Newly appointed Crimean Interior Minister, 
Major-General Valeriy Kuznetsov said at a press conference in 
Simferopol today that his department would be working "outside 
politics." He stated he did not intend to swear an oath of 
loyalty to the Ukrainian people since he had already sworn the 
oath committing himself to serve not only to the Crimean and to 
the Ukrainian peoples but to all the peoples of the former USSR. 
  Kuznetsov recognized that Crimea was an integral part of 
Ukraine. However, he pointed out that he was not going to 
coordinate his activities with the Ukrainian president's 
representatives in Crimea. "There is the Crimean president for 
this purpose," he added emphasizing that he had not as yet met 
the Ukrainian president's representative and that he had no 
intention to do this. Kuznetsov suggested that the police must 
learn to live with the authorities. "Everyone who perpetrates a 
crime must be punished, whoever they may be," he said. 
  Kuznetsov refuted allegations that two planes with Ukrainian 
special military units were heading to Crimea. He said he had 
no information on corruption in Crimean law enforcement bodies, 
regardless of the fact that this issue had led to the 
resignation of former Crimean interior minister, Major-General 
Aleksandr Plyuta. Kuznetsov also stated that there were no 
Cossack military formations on Crimean territory. He did not 
take seriously people in a Cossack uniform. 
  Kuznetsov estimated the situation in Crimea as calm and he 
saw no reasons for declaring a state of emergency in the 
republic. He said his appointment, although provoking 
contradictory response among the Ukrainian leaders, was in 
strict conformity with the law. 
  Major-General Kuznetsov had been the commander of the 
Crimean 
army corps. He had also been the Crimean president's advisor on 
military issues.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol April 14 TASS -- The appointment of a 
Ukrainian presidential representative to the Crimea and the 
recent seizure of a Black Sea unit by Ukrainian paratroopers in 
Odessa are "links in one and the same chain. They are designed 
to destabilize the situation and could be used as a 
justification for introducing Ukrainian presidential rule into 
the Crimea", according to Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov. 
Meshkov complained to ITAR-TASS that the Kiev administration's 
actions are preventing Crimea's new leadership from getting down 
to work. "We have not been given even the least bit of 
breathing space so that we could start working on economic 
decisions under normal conditions", he said. 
  Commenting on the recent elections to the new Crimean 
parliament, where the electoral bloc "Russia" holds a majority 
of the seats, Meshkov noted that the administration and 
parliament had the same goals, which "gives us the possibility 
of working constructively". In reply to a question about the 
relations between the Crimean and Russian leadership, Meshkov 
said, "let me put it this way: The Crimean president does not 
feel isolated, and the "climate" of Russia's Crimean policy has 
become significantly warmer".

  [Text] Crimea's President Yuriy Meshkov has signed an edict 
on currency regulation and currency control. According to this, 
the only legitimate means of payment in Crimea is the national 
currency -- the karbovanets. The currency of other states, 
including the Russian ruble, is treated as foreign currency on 
Crimean territory. Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Saburov had 
previously reported that the law on currency regulation 
envisaged setting up a currency exchange in Crimea.

independent candidate, defeated the chairman of the rayon trade 
union council; in Slovyansk e.d. No. 153, A. Petrenko (SelPU) 
defeated a Socialist. 
  In Kalininskyy e.d. No. 109, where V. Vecherko, the 
son-in-law of Yu. Zvyahilskyy, and S. Ilyin, a Communist, ran 
for office, neither candidate obtained the qualifying number of 
votes. The elections in Makiyivka-Tsentralnyy e.d. No. 133, 
Selydove e.d. No. 139, and Novoazovsk e.d. No. 152 were not 
valid, because voter turnout was lower than required by law.

  [Text] Kiev, 13 Apr -- Ivan Yemets, chairman of the Central 
Electoral Commission, held a news conference on the preliminary 
official results of the parliamentary election in Ukraine. 
According to Ivan Yemets, 338 people's deputies have been 
elected to date, including 129 nominated by labor collectives, 
120 by groups of electors, and 89 by parties. The following 
parties won the following number of seats: 
  The Communist Party of Ukraine -- 86 
  Rukh -- 20 
  Peasant Party of Ukraine -- 18 
  Socialist Party of Ukraine -- 14 
  Ukrainian Republican Party - 8 
  Other parties won between one and five seats; 169 deputies 
have no party affiliation. The newly elected deputies include 
12 women and 56 deputies of the former parliament. 
  Asked about the course of the election campaign in 
Artemovskiy constituency No 1 in Kiev, Ivan Yemets said there 
had been no official complaints either from Rukh or official 
observers. There had been mutual claims from the teams of both 
candidates. He said that 19,126, or 45.04 percent, voted for 
Kostyantyn Morozov and 19,532, or 45.99 percent, voted for 
Viktor Medvedchuk. 
  Ivan Yemets gave explanations on certain points of the law 
on 
elections. He emphasized, in particular, that candidates who 
lost the election could not be nominated in repeat elections. 
Yemets believes Ukraine should introduce "positive voting" in 
the future; that is, marking the chosen candidate on the ballot 
paper rather than crossing out all those the elector is voting 
against. He said: "Ukraine's election law needs the hand of a 
lawyer. Unfortunately, the law was drafted by Anatoliy Tkachuk, 
not a lawyer but an engineer."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Gordeyev] </F>
  [Text] Donetsk April 15 TASS -- Contrary to all pessimistic 
forecasts, Ukraine has elected a new Supreme Soviet 
(parliament). A total of 337 deputies were elected as a result 
of the voting, extended for two weeks. This is quite enough for 
the parliament to start working. Elections were recognised as 
invalid in 113 constituencies, and run-off elections will be 
held there. 
  It is clear already that the hegemony of the nationalistic 
ideology of the Rukh party in Ukraine was dealt a crushing blow. 
The fact that more than one third of deputies belong to the bloc 
of the left-wing forces (86 communists, 14 socialists and 18 
members of the Peasants' Party) is not the most important of 
all. There is another thing which is even more important: The 
elections showed vividly that the left-bank and right-bank parts 
of Ukraine have different concepts of the country's future. 
  The industrially developed eastern regions of Ukraine 
demonstrated most convincingly what they want: The overwhelming 
majority of their residents voted for representatives of 
left-wing parties and movements and for industrial managers. No 
one could forecast the tremendous defeat suffered by 
national-radicals in the biggest regions of Ukraine. The 
Donetsk and Lugansk regions sent left-wing deputies to 
parliament and strengthened their anti- nationalistic stand by 
the results of local referendums. The Donets coal basin 
(Donbass) voted unambiguously for the equality of the Russian 
and Ukrainian languages, for Ukraine's joining of the CIS and 
its interparliamentary assembly, as well as for the federal 
setup of Ukraine. It remains to be seen whether or not deputies 
from the eastern regions of Ukraine will manage to prove in 
parliament the expediency of their attitude to those problems. 
  This is not going to be easy, however. Vyacheslav Chornovil, 
leader of the people's Rukh party, stated point-blank on the 
second day after the elections that his party, which got 38 
seats in parliament, intended to further oppose both Ukraine's 
joining of the CIS and the equality of the two languages in the 
independent Ukraine. Observers do not rule out a possibility of 
a split in the new parliament according to the territorial 
principle. Many people believe that the first session, 
scheduled for mid-May, will be held in an atmosphere of 
anti-Russian and anti-communist hysteria, because the western 
regions of Ukraine again sent to parliament, together with 
popular fighters for the independent Ukraine, several members of 
UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian National 
Self-Defense], which is an openly fascist organisation. 
National- radicals do not conceal their intention to give a 
"farewell performance" on April 22 and to use the last session 
of the current Supreme Soviet for setting the tone for the 
speeches of their successors. However, a political debate will 
hardly be long in the new parliament, because this will be 
mortally dangerous for the Ukrainian economy, nearly brought to 
a standstill, and for the destitute Ukrainian population.

<F P=106> ["Will 10 April Deepen the Zbruch River?"] </F>
  [Text] So far, the elections to the new Supreme Council of 
Ukraine have gone through three stages: a first round on 27 
March, a second ound of voting in a portion of electoral 
districts on 3 April, and a second round of voting in the 
majority of electoral districts on 9-10 April. 
  The first round did not produce a large number of new 
parliamentarians (only 49), and it would have been risky to 
predict the composition of the new Supreme Council on the basis 
of these results. However, it is worthwhile to recall who the 
first winners were. 
  Two well-known democrats were elected in Kiev in the first 
round --Volodymyr Lanovyy and Serhiy Holovatyy. To everyone's 
surprise, the only outright winner in Crimea, Valentyn Horbatov, 
the chairman of an agrofirm (i.e., collective farm), was 
appointed the presidential representative to the restive 
peninsula, provoking a stormy reaction from the Republican 
Movement of Crimea [RDK]. The winners in the first round in 
Luhansk Oblast were six Communists and one private businessman, 
and in Donetsk Oblast, five Socialists/Communists (including 
Petro Symonenko, first secretary of the Central Committee of the 
CPU), a representative of the Liberal Party [LPU], and the 
well-known independent incumbent deputy to the Supreme Council 
of Ukraine, Oleksandr Shekhovtsov. The Communists won one seat 
each in Odessa and Zaporizhzhya oblasts, and Volodymyr 
Marchenko, a leader of the Socialist Party of Ukraine [SPU], won 
a seat in Sumy Oblast. A candidate from yet another "leftist" 
party, the so-called Peasants' Party of Ukraine [SelPU], won a 
seat in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. In Chernihiv Oblast, the first 
round brought victories to the well-known Leonid Kuchma and Ivan 
Plyushch, in Zhytomyr Oblast, to Health Minister Yuriy 
Spizhenko, and in Zakarpattya Oblast, to Transport Minister 
Orest Klimpush. In Kiev Oblast, fate smiled on two collective 
farm chairmen. 
  Voters in the western part of the country painted an 
entirely 
different picture. In Lviv Oblast, seats were won in the first 
round by four representatives of the New Wave alliance 
(including Ihor Yukhnovskyy and Viktor Pynzenyk), two Rukh 
members (one of them, Les Tanyuk), one representative of the 
Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN], one independent 
candidate, and Stepan Khmara, the leader of the Ukrainian 
Conservative Republican Party [UKRP]. In Ternopil Oblast, seats 
were won by Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil and by one 
representative each from the Ukrainian Republican Party [URP], 
KUN, and the Ukrainian National Assembly [UNA] (a few days 
before the election in Ternopil Oblast, a candidate who was a 
sympathizer of the Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian 
National Self-Defense Force [UNA-UNSO] was seriously injured by 
a shot to the head). The winners in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast 
included the leader of the local KUN, as well as a whole group 
of prominent political figures, headed by People's Deputy of 
Ukraine Stepan Volkovetskyy, the chairman of the oblast council 
(it was he who invited Volodymyr Pylypchuk, the distinguished 
economist, Pavlo Movchan, chairman of the All-Ukrainian Prosvita 
[Enlightenment] Society, Volodymyr Mulyava, hetman of the 
Ukrainian Cossacks, and Yevhen Pronyuk, chairman of the Union of 
Former Victims of Repression in kraine, to run for office in 
this oblast to spite Vyacheslav Chornovil). These newly elected 
people's deputies were supported by the Ukraine Bloc, headed by 
Levko Lukyanenko. In Bukovyna [i.e. Chernivtsi Oblast], Heorhiy 
Filipchuk, a democrat who heads the oblast administration of 
education, won a seat in the first round, while Oleksandr 
Skipalsky, chief of the Main Directorate of Military 
Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense, who had the support of 
KUN and URP, won in Volyn Oblast. 
  The clearly defined division between west and east was 
disturbed by another democrat -- Hryhoriy Omelchenko, the chief 
of the Ukrainian Security Service's Directorate for Combatting 
Corruption and Organized Crime, who was elected in industrial 
Kremenchuk (Poltava Oblast). 
  Nor was there a shortage of distinguished losers in the 
first 
round. Those who will not sit in the new parliament include the 
well-known Socialists/Communists Oleksandr Kotsyuba (defeated in 
Vinnytsya) and Serhiy Dorohuntsov (defeated in Kiev), as well as 
the equally well-known Ukrainophobe, Oleksandr Charodyeyev 
(Donetsk). Another Ukrainophobe, Valeriy Meshcheryakov, the 
leader of the chauvinistic Civic Congress of Ukraine (GKU) (he 
conducted his campaign in Kharkiv under the slogan: "Valera 
[Valeriy] -- yes! Bandera -- no!), advanced to the second round 
together with Volodymyr Hrynyov, the well-known cochairman of 
the Interregional Reform Bloc [MBR], but then took fright and 
quit the race. 
  Also among the losers in Kharkiv were the once popular 
Henrikh Altunyan and Andriy Sukhorukov, as well as Yuriy 
Haysynskyy, the former deputy procurator general, notorious for 
his shady deals. 
  Valeriy Ivasyuk, the well-known Rukh activist, was defeated 
in Poltava Oblast, and Dmytro Pavlychko was eliminated in 
Cherkasy Oblast (incidentally, he was but one of eight chairmen 
of the old Supreme Council's standing commissions who failed to 
advance past the first round of voting). 
  In Zakarpattya, both the leader of the post-Communists, 
Mykhaylo Voloshchuk (former first secretary of the oblast 
committee of the CPU and former chairman of the oblast council), 
and the leader of the democrats, Viktor Bed, were defeated. In 
Lviv, Mykhaylo Horyn, the leader of the URP, lost to Stepan 
Khmara. Other deputies to the old Supreme Council who failed to 
advance past the first round of voting in Lviv Oblast were Ihor 
Derkach, Ihor Hryniv, Ivan Makar, Mykhaylo Shvayka, Lyubomyra 
Boychyshyn, the wife of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn and the hope of 
Rukh, Yuriy Shukhevych, the leader of the UNA, Academician 
Volodymyr Chernyak, the well-known Rukh economist, and the 
equally well-known former political prisoner and champion of the 
rights of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Ivan Hel. 
  Four deputies to the old parliament were defeated in 
Ternopil 
Oblast, and the same number lost in Ivano-Frankivsk. Five former 
deputies lost their seats in Volyn Oblast, where the leaders of 
the local Rukh and URP battled each other furiously in one 
district and were both defeated (the seat was won by Deputy 
Prime Minister Mykola Zhulynskyy). Among those failing to 
advance to the second round in Western Ukraine were the minister 
of forestry, the deputy minister of energy, the former deputy 
minister of finance, and the distinguished economist, Mykola 
Syvulskyy. In Rivne, the much anticipated victory did not 
materialize for Valeriy Korotkov, the very rich but not very 
well-disposed to Ukraine Russian businessman with a criminal 
past (as was later revealed, the money that he spent so lavishly 
on his campaign came from the $300,000 that he had 
misappropriated from funds received for a different purpose from 
the American company, Communications and Computer Services of 
Nevada). 
  With respect to the contingent that advanced to the second 
round, both P. Symonenko, the leader of the CPU, and V. 
Chornovil, leader of Rukh, could be happy about the results. Of 
the more than 200 candidates that the Central Leaderhip of Rukh 
supported, 91 made it through the first round (this number does 
not include the democratic candidates that were not on this 
list). The picture in Kiev was particularly heartening (despite 
the overall apathy of the capital's electorate). Here, the 
candidates from the list described above advanced past the first 
obstacle in 20 of 23 districts. Four candidates from the URP and 
the Congress of National Democratic Forces [KNDS] also advanced 
to the second round in the capital, and the same number from the 
UNA. The Communists stood a chance to win in only four districts. 
  In Donetsk Oblast, however, there were only four electoral 
districts in which candidates from the openly "leftist" parties 
(CPU, SPU, SelPU) failed to advance to the second round. In four 
districts, both the candidates who advanced to the second round 
were "leftists." In the rest of the districts, they were opposed 
either by candidates from the "Party of Power," or the "Red" 
directors' Party of Labor, or the Movement for the Restoration 
of the USSR, and only here and there, by individual businessmen. 
In Luhansk Oblast, true "Reds" failed to advance in only one 
district. In four districts, both candidates were "Reds," and in 
the rest, their opponents were for the most part people from the 
"Party of Power," the chauvinistic GKU, or the Russian "Don 
Cossacks." The Communists advanced to the second round in 13 of 
Crimea's 23 districts (in two districts, their victory s 
guaranteed), and candidates from Meshkov's Republican Movement 
of Crimea advanced in three other districts. There were, to be 
sure, also three candidates from Ukrainian organizations and two 
from the Crimean-Tatar Mejiles. 
  Competing in the second round of voting in Kharkiv's 14 
electoral district, were 12 candidates from Hrynyov-Kuchma's MBR 
and their allies, nine Socialists/Communists, two chauvinists 
from the GKU, and two national-democrats (interestingly, on 27 
March, immediately following the election, Kharkiv's "Reds" held 
a press conference, at which they promised that as soon as they 
came to power they would "put up against the wall [i.e., 
execute] first Khmara and Chornovil, followed by Kravchuk and 
Plyushch and all speculators, businessmen, and journalists"). In 
Odessa, in addition to three Communists, one member of the GKU, 
and numerous "independents," the candidates included Viktor 
Shyshkin, the former procurator general, Valentyn Symonenko, 
counsellor to the president (leader of one of the local clans), 
Pavlo Kudyukin, the notorious president of the Blasko Shipping 
Company (which swallowed up the Black Sea Shipping Company), two 
local political and commercial authorities who are fierce rivals 
-- Eduard Hurvits, a Jew, and Oleksiy Kostusyev, a Russian -- 
and Anatoliy Vasserman, an aggressive supporter of an 
independent "Novorosiya." 
  The picture in the west was quite different. The first round 
of voting in Galicia showed clearly that the Communists had 
lost. Although their andidate received 20 percent of the vote in 
one electoral district of Ivano-Frankivsk, and another in Lviv 
got close to 15 percent, they were opposed by such "big guns" as 
V. Pylypchuk and V. Pynzenyk, who deprived them of any chance of 
victory. The candidates of the newly created party of 
Social-Nationalists also lost in all 21 districts of Lviv 
Oblast. Clad in their black shirts bearing an emblem resembling 
a swastika, they also failed to win the voters' confidence. 
  In Lviv Oblast, six candidates from Rukh, six from KUN, four 
from URP, two from UNA, one New Wave candidate, and several 
representatives of smaller parties advanced to the second round. 
The situation in Ternopil Oblast was as follows: Rukh -- four 
candidates, URP -- four, UKRP -- one, and three "independents." 
In Forecarpathia [i.e., Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast], where parties 
do not wield much influence for some reason, there were seven 
"independent" candidates, one from KUN, two supported by Rukh, 
one member of the Democratic Party of Ukraine [DemPU], and one 
from the so-called Nationalistic Rukh. 
  In Zakarpattya Oblast, not a single openly "Red" candidate 
made it through the first round, and only three democrats 
advanced to the second round. Instead, there were five 
representatives of the "Party of Power," five businessmen, and 
three representatives of the Hungarian community. In Bukovyna 
[i.e. Chernivtsi Oblast], one Communist was offset by five 
national-democrats, six members of the "Party of Power," one 
member of New Ukraine, and one representative of the Rumanians. 
In Volyn and Rivne oblasts, of the candidates who advanced to 
the second round, nine were from leftist parties (or supported 
by them), 11 were representatives of the "Party of Power," six 
were Rukh members, five were Republicans, and one was a member 
of KUN. 
  In the rest of of Ukraine, the picture (not counting 
individual businessmen and the "independent" candidates of small 
liberal and left-centrist parties) that emerged was: for one 
representative of the MBR, there were approximately eight 
national-democrats, 10 "Reds," and 15 candidates from the "Party 
of Power" (the latter included Deputy Chairman of the Supreme 
Council Vasyl Durdynets, Deputy Prime Minister Vasyl Yevtukhov, 
Industry Minister Oleksandr Holubchenko, Labor Minister Mykhaylo 
Kaskevych, the former and current ministers of agriculture, 
Oleksandr Tkachenko and Yuriy Karasyk, Deputy Agriculture 
Minister Mykhaylo Parasunko, Mykola Kovalko, chairman of the 
State Oil and Gas Committee, Oleksandr Stoyan, leader of the 
state trade unions, and former prime ministers, Vitold Fokin and 
Vitaliy Masol). A unique situation emerged in Kirovohrad Oblast, 
where 14 Communists, six democrats (including Volodymyr 
Yavorivskyy), and only two unaffiliated representatives of 
governing structures advanced to the second round. 
  And so, the second round of voting would decide everything. 
Even Vyacheslav Chornovil waited for the results of this round 
to make his decision regarding whether to aim for the presidency 
or for the parliamentary speaker's job. 
  The voting that was held in some districts on 3 April 
produced alarming results for the democrats. Although two more 
of their candidates won in two districts in Galicia (who else 
could have won?), in Kiev Oblast, Oles Shevchenko, a leading 
member of the URP, was defeated by Oleksandr Moroz, the leader 
of the SPU. In Cherkasy Oblast, a Communist and a minister 
defeated two Rukh members, and in Khmelnytskyy Oblast, the head 
of Ukrahrotekhservis [Ukrainian State Concern for Providing 
Material and Technical Supplies and Services to the 
Agroindustrial Complex] routed yet another URP member. The seats 
in the rural districts of Kharkiv Oblast were won by six "Reds," 
seven people from the "Party of Power," and one independent 
lawyer. The national-democrats had to be satisfied with the 
victory of three collective farm chairmen whom they had 
supported (lacking any other choice) against openly Communist 
candidates. In Zhytomyr Oblast, all the national-democratic 
candidates lost (including Vitaliy Zhuravskyy, the leader of the 
Christian-Democrats), while the winners were two Communists, an 
independent businessman, a deputy minister, a general, a 
director of a production association, and two members of the 
"Party of Power." 
  In Bershad (Vinnytsya Oblast) both candidates lost (a Rukh 
member and Anatoliy Matviyenko, the chairman of the Workers' 
Congress who had formerly headed the Ukrainian Komsomol) -- 
neither obtaining the qualifying 50 percent of the vote. The 
same happened in four other districts in the voting held on 3 
April. 
  The days between 3 and 9 April passed in fierce battles. The 
State Television Company and the yellow rag Kiyevskiye 
vedomosti launched a campaign against Kostyantyn Morozov 
(who ran in Kiev) --there were many who wanted to eliminate a 
powerful rival from the upcoming presidential election. In 
Kharkiv, MBR members claimed that the Communists had used up 
their reserves of votes and would not win any more seats. In 
Odessa, two journalists from opposing camps were beaten up at 
the same time. In Cherkasy, the Socialist/Communists stuffed 
mail boxes with proclamations urging voters in the 
Prydniprovskyy electoral district to vote against both 
candidates, because, allegedly, one was a "democrat-Rukh member" 
and the other, a "liberal-nationalist." In neighboring Shpola, 
Chornovil himself campaigned on behalf of Yuriy Boyko, a priest 
of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. 
  In Lviv Oblast, Mykola Horyn, the chairman of the oblast 
council, with the help of people's deputies M. Kosiv and Ya. 
Kendzyor, launched a campaign to discredit his rivals from the 
UNA-UNSO (this was the first time they were openly called 
"fascists") and their patron Stepan Khmara. Meanwhile, inspired 
by its victory on 27 March, the New Wave announced its intention 
to transform itself from a preelection alliance into a public 
organization and to create a powerful centrist bloc with Rukh, 
the Ukrainian Republican Party, and possibly the Congress of 
Ukrainian Nationalists as a counterbalance to the 
ultra-rightists. 
  Finally, the decisive weekend of 9-10 April arrived. Voting 
was held on Saturday in Kharkiv and in two electoral districts 
in Luhansk. In Luhansk Oblast, a Communist defeated a Socialist, 
and the pro-Communist chief of the local Security Service of 
Ukraine defeated a Communist. 
  In Kharkiv, seats were won by two Communists (one defeated 
Volodymyr Filenko, the leader of the Party of Democratic Rebirth 
of Ukraine [PDVU], who finally got his deserts after switching 
back and forth between the "nationalists" and the 
"Hrynyovites"), I. Mukhin, the leader of the local SPU, V. 
Aleksyeyev, member of the chauvinistic GKU, as well as Volodymyr 
Hrynyov and five of his supporters. The elections in three 
districts were invalid because voter turnout was lower than 
required by law, and in one district, no candidate received the 
qualifying percentage of votes. 
  Results from Sunday's vote began coming in on the morning of 
11 April. Kiev presented the saddest picture -- it was 
officially announced that elections in 13 of the city's 21 
electoral districts (including the district in which K. Morozov 
had run) were invalid owing to voter turnout that fell below the 
legally required percentage. And in those districts, in which 
the election was valid, preliminary results showed that deputies 
had been elected in only three districts. In view of the high 
voter turnout throughout most of Ukraine and the government's 
great unwillingness to see Kiev's democrats in parliament, the 
results in Kiev appear quite suspicious. 
  In Donetsk, seats were won on 10 April by Acting Prime 
Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn 
Landyk, Derzhvuhleprom [State Coal Industry Committee] Chairman 
Mykola Surhay and two other representatives of the "Party of 
Power," 22 Socialists/Communists, two members of the directors' 
Party of Labor, Yuriy Boldyrev, a vehement supporter of the GKU, 
and five independent candidates (unfortunately, Petro 
Tsekhmister, the director of the first private mine in the 
Donbas and a sincere Ukrainian patriot, was defeated). Thirteen 
deputies were not elected in Crimea because they failed to 
receive the qualifying number of votes, and of the ten who were 
elected, half were Communists. 
  The preliminary results of the election on 10 April on the 
territories of some oblasts in Central and Southern Ukraine 
(Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, 
Zaporizhzhya, Mykolayiv, and Khmelnytskyy) present the following 
picture: seats were won by 37 "Reds," two members of the Party 
of Labor, six members of the MBR, three dozen representatives of 
the "Party of Power," four members of the URP, three Rukh 
members, four PDVU members, one member of DemPU (Volodymyr 
Yavorivskyy), two members of the Union of Officers of Ukraine, 
and 12 "independents" (who might also turn out to be 
Communists). Poltava Oblast proved to be the most 
"anti-Communist" --not a single true "Red" won here. 
  In each of these oblasts, there were two or three districts 
in which the elections were invalid because of insufficient 
voter turnout or no deputy was elected owing to a failure of 
both candidates in a district to receive the qualifying number 
of votes. The exception was Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, where a total 
of ten districts suffered from "abstinence." Vitold Fokin and 
Deputy Prime Minister Vasyl Yevtukhov failed to win 
parliamentary seats in these districts. However, the winners 
included Valeriy Babych, the president of the powerful Ukrainian 
Financial Group Joint-Stock Company, Industry Minister Oleksandr 
Holubchenko, the Communist poet Borys Oliynyk (who was 
reelected), and democrats Viktor Nosov and Yuriy Sobolyev. 
  In Western Ukraine (except for Zakarpattya Oblast), not a 
single Communist won a parliamentary seat on 10 April. In 
contrast, another 11 people on the Rukh list were elected here 
(including Borys Kozhyn and Vasyl Chervoniy). Seats were also 
won by five URP members, four KUN members, two UNA members (in 
Lviv Oblast), and one candidate each from the DemPU and New 
Ukraine. Taras Stetskiv, a member of the New Wave, defeated 
Iryna Kalynets, who ran from KUN (both had been deputies to the 
old Supreme Council). Five members of the "Party of Power" were 
elected (including Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Zhulynskyy, 
Economy Minister Roman Shpek, and Anton Buteyko, head of the 
president's foreign affairs service). Mykola Horyn, chairman of 
the Lviv Oblast Council, was defeated, however. 
  No deputies were elected in 14 districts of Western Ukraine 
due to the failure of either candidate in the district to obtain 
the qualifying number of votes (the only exception was 
Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast). 
  Zakarpattya stands somewhat apart. Here seats were won by 
two 
representatives of the local "Party of Power," one 
Christian-Democrat, and one independent democrat -- docent of 
Uzhhorod University and father of the well-known popular singer, 
Anzhelika Korshynska. 
  Will the prevalence of "leftists" in the east and the 
complete rejection of them in the west split Ukraine along the 
Zbruch River? Only time will tell...

<F P=106> [Volodymyr Skachko report: "Everything Will Have To Be </F>
Proved"] 
  [Text] In accordance with the data of the sociological 
opinion poll involving 1,200 persons that was conducted on 29 
March-7 April by the "Democratic Initiative" Center in various 
regions of Ukraine, just 10 percent of the respondents stated 
that they would not vote at the repeat elections, 8 percent did 
not make a final decision, 33 percent did not know for sure for 
whom they would vote, and 42 percent knew precisely for whom 
they would vote. 
  Just 28 percent of respondents were pleased with the 
candidates' speeches prior to the elections, 24 percent were 
disappointed, 22 percent remained indifferent to the calls of 
the candidates, and 26 percent did not have an idea about the 
candidates' speeches. 
  Of all the respondents, 63 percent were convinced that their 
participation in the elections would somehow influence Ukraine's 
future and 37 percent were convinced that the elections would 
not change anything. 
  Only 35 percent of the respondents believed that those 
candidates, who passed the first round, are worthy of being 
Supreme Council deputies, and therefore, in the opinion of the 
respondents, those who have been elected will have to prove that 
they are not accidental people in politics.

  [Text] Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk held 
a news conference in Kiev dedicated to issues of gas supply to 
our state. According to Valentyn Landyk, the general situation 
with gas does not evoke concern at present. The problem mainly 
lies in the fact that payments for the gas supplied are not made 
in time. For example, today our debt to Russia in this sphere 
reaches 600 million dollars. 
  It was reported that a mechanism of settling accounts with 
Russia's Gazprom had been worked out during the negotiations 
held by our governmental delegation in Moscow on 12 April. It 
is envisaged that half of our debt will be paid off at the 
expense of the deliveries of Ukrainian-made pipes, pumps, and 
electrical equipment. Also, an agreement was reached on storing 
10 billion cubic meters of Russian gas in our gas-holders and on 
paying relevant compensation to Ukraine for this. 
  Valentyn Landyk also reported that national joint-stock 
company UkrHazProm would be set up in the near future. He 
expressed certainty that the problem of energy sources in our 
state would be solved by the end of the next year. It is 
envisaged that 37 billion cubic meters of gas and seven million 
tons of oil will be extracted in Ukraine itself.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and his 
Ukrainian counterpart, Vitaliy Radetskyy, failed to reach 
agreement on the Black Sea Fleet issue at their meeting in 
Moscow Thursday which followed a session of the CIS Defense 
Ministers' Council. 
  Commenting on the reasons for the aggravation of the 
situation, Grachev pointed out that Ukrainian customs officers 
and border guards had no right to search the hydrographic vessel 
Cheleken belonging to the Black Sea Fleet. He said that 
Cheleken's transfer from Odessa to Sevastopol had been 
necessitated by the fleet's hydrographic needs. Ukrainian 
marines attempted to prevent the vessel with hydrographic and 
navigation equipment on board from leaving on April 9. 
  On the next day, the vessel conservation group stationed in 
Odessa was made subordinate to Ukraine by an order of the 
Ukrainian defense minister. 
  Grachev said he had drawn the attention of his Ukrainian 
counterpart to the fact that the actions by Ukrainian special 
purpose units in Odessa were of "unilateral character," laying 
outside the scope of the two countries' agreements on the Black 
Sea Fleet. 
  For his part, Radetskyy laid down his point of view of the 
incidents in Odessa. "In the first place, the indignation of 
citizens of Odessa and Ukraine was caused by the order to use 
weapons without warning which had been given on board Cheleken," 
he told Interfax. The Ukrainian minister pointed out that the 
fact that the order was given by navy servicemen who were 
citizens of Ukraine triggered off an outbreak of indignation. 
  Radetskyy said that "as the 318th group (for vessel 
conservation stationed in Odessa -- IF) gave the order to use 
weapons, I, for my part, made a decision which was adequate to 
these actions -- to dissolve the unit." He said he considered 
Cheleken's leaving Odessa as "pure piracy." 
  Radetskyy supposed that if he had got in touch with Grachev 
at that moment, the incident could have been prevented. 
"However, I could not make contact a whole day," he said. 
  Commenting on the actions by Black Sea Fleet Commander 
Eduard 
Baltin during Cheleken's departure from Odessa, Radetskyy said 
he was amazed at his behavior. 
  What happened in Odessa is a thing of the past. Other issues 
have to be resolved such as that of the Black Sea Fleet. So 
said Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko in an Interfax 
interview. He arrived in Moscow to attend the CIS summit. 
  In response to an Interfax question whether the Massandra 
accord of September 3, 1993 under which the Ukrainian part of 
the fleet would be handed over to Russia as payment for Russian 
fuel, Zlenko said that the accord had not been canceled or 
denounced but that these problems had to be discussed together. 
  Speaking of the recent visit to Ukraine by a Russian team 
headed by special envoy Yuriy Dubinin and Russian Navy 
Commander-in-Chief Feliks Gromov, Zlenko said as the talks 
started it became obvious that the team wanted to make the Black 
Sea Fleet a still bigger headache.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Burbyga report: "Two States' Military Ministers </F>
Fail To Reach Agreement in Wake of `Odessa' Incident"] 
  [Text] IZVESTIYA has already reported on the incident 
which involved the hydrographic vessel Cheleken in the Odessa 
Port's Prakticheskaya Harbor, almost leading to an armed 
conflict between Ukraine and Russia. 
  How do the two states' military ministers, who met "one on 
one" in Moscow, assess the action taken by the military? 
  Here is the view of Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, 
Ukrainian 
defense minister: 
  "The Odessa Port incident can be called an act of piracy -- 
when people arrive, load up, and then give the order for weapons 
to be used. Of course, this has angered the citizens of Odessa. 
It has angered the Ukrainian people, because the Ukrainian 
people have their own Armed Forces. Just what is going on when 
there is this kind of disorganization? What is typical is that 
the soldiers who were ordered to shoot were Ukrainian 
citizens.... If a division is ordered to use its weapons, then 
that division is not needed and there is no place for it on 
Ukrainian territory. That is why I have ordered it to be 
disbanded." 
  [Burbyga] What is your relationship with the Russian defense 
minister, is there any mutual understanding? 
  [Radetskyy] There are issues which, clearly, do not depend 
on Pavel Sergeyevich. I understand that. This incident would 
not have happened if we had contacted Grachev and settled the 
matter over the phone. But I was unable to contact him and 
resolve the problem for 24 hours. An underling would reply that 
the minister was out, or was busy, and so forth..... I can get 
through to the U.S. defense secretary in five minutes. 
[Radetskyy ends] 
  Here is the view of Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian 
defense minister: 
  "The Cheleken hydrographic vessel is part of the Black Sea 
Fleet, and no customs officers or border guards have the right 
to inspect what the Black Sea Fleet command is carrying. These 
actions were provoked by the Ukrainian authorities." 
  [Burbyga] Why, when the Black Sea Fleet situation was 
discussed during the "one on one" meeting, were you unable to 
reach mutual agreement with your colleague Vitaliy Radetskyy? 
  [Grachev] He defended himself during the discussion of the 
situation involving the hydrographic vessel, claiming that we 
had wanted to use weapons. But nobody used them. That is why 
there was no mutual agreement. I pointed out to him that their 
actions were one-sided and fell outside the framework of the 
Yalta agreement on the Black Sea Fleet which was signed by the 
two heads of state.

  [Excerpts] Admiral Kasatonov, who is in St. Petersburg, 
spoke today at a news conference during which he gave a fairly 
frank appraisal of the events in Odessa as a state, anti-Russian 
action. 
  [Begin Kasatonov recording] What happened is the result of 
political games, first and foremost. [end recording] [passage 
omitted] 
  What happened in Odessa between 8 and 11 April on the 
territory of the 318th Division can be viewed as a state, 
anti-Russian action by Ukrainian armed forces. That is how the 
former commander of the Black Sea Fleet, and now first deputy 
commander in chief of the Russian Navy, Igor Kasatonov, 
appraised the Odessa incident today. 
  [Begin Kasatonov recording] Women and children were taken 
outside in the middle of the night. They were lined up like in 
the worst times, 50-odd years ago, when Odessa was occupied. 
Some were taken away, a child was injured. [end recording] 
  As Admiral Kasatonov reported at the news conference, the 
Russian side is now trying to the best of its ability to resolve 
the conflict. But the Ukraine Fleet command has already issued 
an ultimatum saying that all sailors and officers who have not 
taken an oath of allegiance to Ukraine have to leave the 
territory of Black Sea Fleet units immediately. New commanders 
from the Ukrainian armed forces have already been appointed to 
the garrisons in Ochakov, Nikolayev and Izmail. 
  But nevertheless a solution must be found. Otherwise, as one 
of the major western politicians said, the military conflict in 
Bosnia will seem to the world community to be an innocent row 
between two adoloscents who have fallen out in comparison with 
the possible consequences of the Odessa incident, if two great 
powers -- Russia and Ukraine -- do not find mutual 
understanding.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yelena Yugina] </F>
  [Text] St. Petersburg April 14 TASS -- The only way of 
easing tension over the Black Sea Fleet is through patient 
negotiations and sensible compromise solutions, Admiral Igor 
Kasatonov, deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy said at 
a press conference in St. Petersburg today. 
  The admiral noted that "the incident in Odessa can be 
regarded as an anti-Russian action". One has to recognise that 
Ukrainian commandos forcibly took over Division 318 of the Black 
Sea Fleet, disbanded it and are now forcing Russian sailors at 
gunpoint to take an oath of allegiance to Ukraine. 
  The general noted that a similar scenario can be used again. 
Ukraine has already appointed its own commanders for the fleet 
units stationed in Ismail, Nikolayev and Ochakov. 
  But the situation in the Crimea as a whole is not in favour 
of Ukraine's nationalist forces, Kasatonov said. The 
inhabitants have already made their choice by voting for dual 
citizenship. The Black Sea Fleet remains Russia's and it is 
extremely illogical to try and divide it. The command of the 
Russian Navy cannot agree to such division, Admiral Kasatonov 
declared.

<F P=106> [Sergey Turchenko report: "Disgraced Division"] </F>
  [Text] The provocative incident connected with the seizure 
of the 318th Division of Black Sea Fleet ships by Ukrainian 
special-purpose troops elicited a harsh reaction both in Russia 
and in Ukraine. We asked Captain First Rank Valeriy Volodin, 
chairman of the Black Sea Fleet Officers' Assembly, to comment 
on what happened. 
  "Servicemen of the Bolgrad Airborne Brigade of the Ukrainian 
Armed Forces participated in the seizure of the division of 
mothballed Black Sea Fleet ships in Odessa during the night of 
9-10 April. The Ukrainian servicemen were put on alert status 
and delivered in seven Ural trucks to the Potemkin Steps in 
Odessa. They infiltrated the unit's territory through the 
windows of the checkpoint. The attackers arrested 31 people. 
The commander of Odessa Military District came to the division, 
read out to the personnel the Ukrainian defense minister's 
directive disbanding the unit, and put an ultimatum to the 
servicemen: take an oath of loyalty to Ukraine. Those who 
refused, so it followed from the directive, would be instructed 
to leave for military units on the territory of CIS states. 
Only four officers and 12 warrant officers among the personnel 
of the 318th Division agreed to this. In all, approximately 200 
servicemen in the unit must come to a decision on service." 
  Right after the incident a Russian delegation headed by 
Yuriy 
Dubinin, ambassador for special assignments, flew to Kiev. It 
held talks with Borys Tarasyuk, Ukrainian deputy minister of 
foreign affairs. It also met with Leonid Kravchuk. The results 
of the talks were not made public. 
  A meeting of officers of the fleet's chief base and of the 
garrison's military units was held in Sevastopol yesterday. It 
adopted a resolution in which the Black Sea Fleet sailors demand 
an end to provocations by nationalist Ukrainian forces. 
Bewilderment was expressed at the lack of a reaction to what 
happened from the presidents of Russia and Ukraine. The 
officers voiced a total lack of trust in the Ukrainian Ministry 
of Defense and demanded that tough measures be taken, even 
including criminal proceedings against the officials who 
organized the provocation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under general headline "Step Toward </F>
Strengthening Commonwealth. Session of CIS Leaders' Council"] 
  [Text] Describing the session's work, Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk noted that the Commonwealth countries had found 
common views on the matters under discussion. 
  "The main thing in today's talks between Ukraine and 
Russia," 
he continued, "is to make progress on resolving the Black Sea 
Fleet issue." Kravchuk announced that "agreement was reached 
today between the two countries' presidents for a meeting of 
delegations comprising the presidents, prime ministers, foreign 
ministers, and defense ministers." 
  In Kravchuk's opinion, "it is necessary to solve the Black 
Sea Fleet problem stage by stage." He proposes for the first 
stage to "separate the Russian and Ukrainian naval forces." 
"The two countries' naval forces should not have the same base 
-- this will always give rise to conflicts," the Ukrainian 
president said. He believes that the settlement of 
Russo-Ukrainian problems should begin with the resolution of 
this issue. 
  As the second stage Kravchuk proposed setting up in Black 
Sea 
waters a naval base which would belong to Ukraine. "The two 
states would later hold talks on leasing part of the territory 
of the naval base to Russia." Kravchuk stressed that there is 
as yet no document which would define such a relationship 
between the two countries. This is why such a document should 
be elaborated. 
  The Ukrainian president is convinced that Russia has the 
right merely to lease a naval base from Ukraine. As he put it, 
the two states must work out the international principles for 
the existence of such naval bases.

  [Text] Moscow, 15 Apr -- A group of eight Ukrainian naval 
personnel, having enlisted the support of the Ukrainian 
president's representative in Izmail, today arrived at the Black 
Sea Fleet's brigade of river cutters. The group was headed by 
Captain, First Rank, Dmitriy Ukrainets, head of the western area 
of the Ukrainian Navy's Water Protection Force, the report from 
the Black Sea Fleet's press center says. 
  Those who arrived there met with the unit's command and 
handed over a directive from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, 
dated 10 April 1994, stating that the Black Sea Fleet unit is 
disbanded and on its basis is created the Third Brigade for the 
Ukrainian Navy's Water Protection Force. 
  The Ukrainian Navy representatives called on the brigade's 
command not to use weapons. The Ukrainian side said that those 
servicemen who wish to serve in the Navy of the Russian 
Federation will be allowed to leave for Russia. 
  Thus, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry is not giving up its 
attempts to use force to resubordinate units of the Black Sea 
Fleet, crudely violating all the Russian-Ukrainian accords which 
have been reached concerning the Fleet, the Black Sea Fleet 
press center's report says.

  [Text] Boris Yeltsin had a meeting with Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk in Moscow today within the framework 
of the CIS summit, in order to remove the tensions that have 
developed around the Black Sea Fleet. The two presidents 
discussed the possibility of resolving the issue in stages. The 
first stage could be to relocate the fleets to different bases, 
while the second stage could include setting up a base for 
Ukrainian naval forces on the Black Sea coast. In Kravchuk's 
opinion, the main problem is that there are no documents 
regulating the stationing of foreign naval bases on the 
territory of Ukraine.

Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, 14 Apr -- "The mechanism for putting into 
effect the measures stipulated in the trilateral declaration of 
the presidents of Ukraine, Russia and the United States on 14 
January has begun working." This was how Grigoriy Karasin, the 
director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Press and Information 
Department, commented at a briefing today on reports of the 
arrival at the Zaporozhye AES [nuclear electric power station], 
the largest in Europe, of the first batch of fuel installations 
[toplivye sborki] from Russia as part of compensation for 
dismantled nuclear warheads. 
  As the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said, all nuclear 
munitions had, in accordance with the statement by the 
presidents of the three countries, to be brought from Ukraine to 
Russia in order for them to be dismantled as rapidly as 
possible, while Russia for its part had to provide compensation 
in the form of nuclear fuel installation deliveries to Ukraine 
to meet the needs of Ukraine's nuclear power sector during the 
same period of time. 
  In order to begin the process of compensating Ukraine, 
Russia 
had undertaken to supply it over 10 months with fuel 
installations containing 100 tonnes of low-level enriched 
[nizkoobogashchennyy] uranium for nuclear power stations. A 
minimum of 200 nuclear warheads off RC-18 and RS-22 missiles 
will be taken from Ukraine to Russia in the same period to be 
dismantled. 
  In the opinion of Russian experts, the first consignment of 
fuel received by the Zaporozhye AES is enough to power one of 
the power units for a year, providing Ukraine with 5.5-5.6 
billion kilowatt hours of electricity.

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- "The mechanism for 
implementing measures stipulated by the tri-partite statement 
made by the Presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. on 
January 14 of this year has started to work", said a spokesman 
for the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  Grigoriy Karasin was referring to the arrival of the first 
shipment of nuclear fuel assemblies from Russia to the Ukrainian 
Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, the largest of its kind in 
Europe. The shipment was sent as compensation for Ukraine's 
dismantled nuclear warheads. 
  As the spokesman, in accordance with the three presidents' 
statement, all nuclear warheads should be transferred from 
Ukrainian to Russian territory, where they should be dismantled 
as soon as possible. Russia is then required to compensate 
Ukraine in the form of fuel assemblies for the latter's nuclear 
energy programme, also as soon as possible. 
  In order to begin the process of compensating Ukraine, 
Russia 
agreed to provide the fuel assemblies, containing 100 tonnes of 
lowly-enriched Uranium, within ten months. In the same time 
period, at least 200 nuclear warheads from RS-18 and RS-22 
rockets will be transported from Ukraine to Russia for 
dismantling. 
  According to Russian specialists, the first shipment of fuel

the plant's five reactors to work for an entire year, which will 
give Ukraine 5.5 to 6 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.

<F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report in the "Parliament" column: "The </F>
Russian Federation Foreign Affairs Ministry: The NATO Program 
Is `An Instrument To Consolidate the CIS.' Apparently the 
Deputies Will Not Be Allowed To Ratify Partnership for Peace"] 
  [Text] The Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry is going to 
propose to today's session of the CIS heads of state council to 
include in the final document a description of the NATO 
Partnership for Peace program as "a mechanism to create a 
collective security system in Europe." This was announced by 
Yuriy Ushakov, director of the Foreign Ministry's Department for 
European Cooperation, at yesterday's hearings in the State Duma 
on "The NATO Program and the Future of the CIS." He recalled 
that "whether Russia wants it or not," Ukraine, Moldova, and 
Georgia have already signed the Partnership documents and their 
example is soon to be followed by Kazakhstan and Turkmenia 
[Turkmenistan]. According to the diplomat, "even if this is not 
quite the `partnership' Moscow would like to have, the Foreign 
Affairs Ministry sees only two ways out of this situation for 
Russia: Take offense, shut itself up, and thus find itself in 
isolation; or join the program and use its elbows vigorously to 
uphold Russia's interests" and so prevent NATO's expansion. 
  Major General Pavel Zolotarev, who spoke at yesterday's 
hearings on behalf of the Russian Defense Ministry, fully 
supported such a position by the Foreign Affairs Ministry. "We 
will never be able to force NATO to dissolve itself anyway," he 
complained, calling on the house to work to achieve a status 
desirable for Russia "from within." 
  CIS Council of Ministers Secretary Leonid Levashov expressed 
active disagreement with Russia's and the East European 
countries' signing the Partnership, stating that in that event 
"NATO allies will appear in Russia's rear." 
  This opinion is also shared by a considerable part of State 
Duma deputies. The Party of Russian Unity and Accord has 
circulated demands on obligatory ratification by parliament of 
the deed of accession to the Partnership (with an obvious hint 
for a subsequent refusal by the lower chamber to do so), while 
the Agrarian Party faction even prepared a corresponding Draft 
Federal Law. Foreign Affairs Ministry department chief Yuriy 
Ushakov explained, however, that the signing of the Partnership 
is "not an agreement or a treaty but a declaration of intent," 
and therefore it does not call for special parliamentary 
approval.

  [Text] Russia's peacekeeping forces in the hotspots of the 
CIS could not be replaced by UN subunits. This opinion was 
expressed in a RIA interview by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. 
The reason he gave for this is that the international community 
does not have the funds to deploy a new peacekeeping operation. 
Moreover, there will hardly be many wishing to leave for the 
conflict zones on the territory of the former USSR, the minister 
said. He believes that only UN observers could be present in 
the hotspots of the CIS, the more so as, he believes, it is the 
Russian Army that the majority of CIS members would like to see 
as peacekeeper on their territories. 
  Touching on the presence of Russian subunits within the UN 
peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia, Pavel Grachev said 
the United Nations has requested Russia to increase its 
contingent. However, in view of the latest events in Bosnia, the 
Defense Ministry will have to discuss this matter in detail, the 
head of the Russian military said.

  [Text] Russia's Defence Minister Pavel Grachev has declared 
that although the UN Secretary General has requested the 
deployment of yet another 300 Russian peacekeepers in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Moscow, in light of the recent developments 
in former Yugoslavia, should think twice before taking a 
decision on this issue. However, he admitted in a conversation 
with journalists on Friday that 200 Russian servicemen are ready 
to be dispatched to former Yugoslavia. 
  Grachev is convinced that currently there can be no talk 
about replacing Russian peacekeepers in "hot spots" across CIS 
with UN "blue helmets". Firstly, he explained, the UN has no 
money to send peacekeepers to the CIS. Secondly, one is not 
likely to find troops willing to be in volatile CIS areas. 
Thirdly, CIS heads of state want to see only Russian troops and 
UN observers in Commonwealth trouble spots.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, 14 Apr -- The Russian side is particularly 
concerned by reports that in authorizing the "first use of 
direct air support in response to the Bosnian Serbs' attack on 
Gorazde," the UN secretary general's special representative said 
that this authorization "is valid for two weeks from being 
given." This was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy 
Karasin, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's press and 
information department. 
  "The special representative does not, in our view, have such 
powers. The Security Council has not empowered him to do this," 
the Russian diplomat said. 
  Russia does not support any proposal to simplify the 
procedure whereby the United Nations requests "air support" from 
NATO, Grigoriy Karasin said. According to him, the Russian 
Foreign Ministry could not fail to notice an article published 
in THE NEW YORK TIMES on Wednesday which maintains that, by 
bypassing the Security Council, the United Nations has allegedly 
taken a decision, in essence, "to water down this procedure." 
"Judging by this report, an obvious attempt is in evidence to 
downgrade the adoption of such an important decision to the 
level of not simply Akashi, the UN secretary general's envoy, 
but even to refer it to the military - to General Bertrand de 
Lapresle, commander of the UN forces in former Yugoslavia," he 
remarked. 
  If the NEW YORK TIMES's allegation is based on reality, then 
a situation is emerging as a result of which the UN secretary 
general's control over key decisions concerning the UN forces' 
activities in former Yugoslavia can be lost and the prestige of 
the Security Council and of the United Nations in general can be 
damaged, Grigoriy Karasin stressed. 
  The NEW YORK TIMES report is causing serious worry in Russia 
and requires urgent clarifications by the UN Secretariat, the 
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said.

  [Text] Belgrade April 14 TASS -- Russian envoy Vitaliy 
Churkin met with Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic on Thursday to 
discuss the situation in Bosnia and new Russian initiatives on 
resolving the crisis, following NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb 
positions near Gorazde. 
  In a brief statement for the press, Churkin refrained from 
commenting on the substance of the proposals. He said though 
that they aim at putting an end to hostilities in Bosnia and 
restoring normal life in the republic, which is a prerequisite 
for a political settlement of the conflict. 
  ITAR-TASS learnt from informed sources that the Serb leader 
and Bosnian Serb officials may meet with Churkin shortly to 
discuss Russia's initiatives and work out their position.

  [Excerpt] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said 
NATO's recent air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces made him 
cancel his April 21 trip to Brussels to seal Russia's membership 
in the North Atlantic alliance's Partnership for Peace program. 
  Kozyrev told Interfax on Thursday that he had repeatedly 
said 
April 21 was only a tentative date for the start of his visit to 
the Belgian capital. "I'm getting the impression that Russia's 
partners in the West, especially in NATO, have not yet found 
correct solutions" concerning Russia's participation in the 
Partnership for Peace, he said. "We are interested in a much 
more serious approach and not merely in the discussion of some 
kind of framework document. The Foreign and Defense Ministries 
of the Russian Federation have formulated proposals to that 
effect, and now they are thinking about a more serious format 
for a relationship with NATO," Kozyrev said. [passage omitted]

Democrats, cut short his visit to the French city of Strasbourg 
today. Four days ago he arrived there as a member of a Russian 
parliamentary delegation for a Council of Europe session. His 
statement that Russia should retaliate for NATO air strikes on 
Serb positions in Bosnia by attacking NATO bases in Italy 
provoked a negative reaction from the French Foreign Ministry. 
Apart from that, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy caused outrage by 
getting involved in an incident with demonstrators protesting 
against his visit to France. 
  As a result, the furious leader of Russia's Liberal 
Democrats 
vowed never to set foot on French soil again.

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- A Russian air defence 
official denied on Thursday an ABC report revealing the details 
of a plane incident in the Russian Far East which, according to 
the company, has caused a row in Washington. 
  "The American light plane Cessna-550 was flying along the 
MK-56- H3 route from Dutch Harbour (Aleutian Islands) to 
Petropavlovsk Kamchatka on April 13," said Leonid Shirobokov, 
spokesman for the Russian air defence troops. 
  "The flight had been officially announced and we were aware 
of it. Before crossing the Russian state border at 3:58 a.m. 
Moscow time [2358 GMT] the pilot failed to report. In order to 
find out the identity of the plane an air defence fighter was 
ordered to take off and approach the Cessna. After that the 
American plane reported," he said. 
  Asked to comment on the ABC report that the Cessna was 
forced 
to land, but after refueling was allowed to continue the flight, 
Shirobokov replied that "no one landed anyone. After having 
established the identity of the plane our fighter returned to 
the base, while the Cessna which had communicated with Russian 
air controllers was allowed to continue the flight and made a 
safe landing in Petropavlovsk Kamchatka."

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by diplomatic </F>
correspondents Igro Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] Tajikistan's leadership "greatly hopes" that in the 
course of the negotiations with the representatives of the Tajik 
opposition in Moscow "an additional impetus" will be given to 
the return of refugees to the republic. "It is impossible to 
stop this process and its politicizing is inadmissible," 
Tajikistan's Foreign Minister Rashid Alimov, on a visit in 
Moscow, declared in his interview with Interfax. 
  He pointed out that "in general, refugees return to their 
homeland irrespective of the course of the negotiations." "We 
have been solving this problem for a year already, the 
department of the UN High Commissioner on Refugees, Russia and 
Uzbekistan render their backing to us. More than 60 percent of 
refugees, primarily from Afghanistan have already returned to 
their homeland, said Alimov. 
  Lavrov [as received] believes that the delegations must 
negotiate so that all refugees willing to return to Tajikistan 
could do this. The Tajik leadership should undertake additional 
measures in order to ensure security for returning refugees and 
their reintegration into the political, economic and cultural 
life of the republic. It is necessary to realize that the 
process of return of refugees is irreversible. There might be 
attempts to hinder it but only on the part of the opposition, 
Alimov stressed. 
  In his words, some time ago as may as 700 refugees were 
already prepared to return to Tajikistan from the neighboring 
Afghanistan but this process was suspended due to a rocket 
shelling of the border. "Unfortunately, last year we also 
experienced great difficulties with the repatriation of refugees 
due to an outbreak of Cholera in the boarder area," Alimov 
stated. 
  "If the parties started to exploit the plight of refugees to 
solve their immediate problems it would be a serious mistake," 
said Alimov.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Tajikistan will evidently become the first partner 
of Russia and Belarus in the ruble zone and economic union. The 
announcement was made on Wednesday by Prime-Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin after talks with his Tajik counterpart Abdujalil 
Samadov. 
  According to Samadov, Tajikistan's intentions are confirmed 
by a preliminary understanding with Russia on the unification of 
monetary systems as well as the agreement he signed in Moscow 
after the talks on an 80 Bn ruble Russian loan to his country. 
  However, Chernomyrdin said that one should not simplify the 
complex and lengthy process of forming an economic union on 
which CIS members have agreed, as it is only a framework 
agreement which provides for the signing of bilateral treaties. 
The agreement with Belarus, for example, was under work for 
eight months and required the drafting of over 30 legal 
documents. This together with the difficulties accompanying the 
growth of the CIS only go to prove that generally the economic 
union belongs to the future. 
  The prime-minister said that Kazakhstan intended to be the 
first one to sign such an agreement. But now that President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev has suggested forming a Eurasian union the 
contents and possibilities of which are so far vague, it is 
difficult to say anything about his plans concerning the 
economic union. 
  The formation of an economic union does not have the purpose 
of trampling on the sovereignty of any third party, Chernomyrdin 
declared. He strongly opposed attempts to accuse Russia of 
having imperial ambitions and trying to subjugate former Soviet 
republics. 
  Chernomyrdin stressed that economic integration with 
Tajikistan will largely depend on the settlement of the 
political situation in that Central Asian country. IF Note: 
Talks are currently under way in Moscow between the Tajik 
government and opposition. According to sources in the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, the two sides have made considerable progress. 
They agreed to sign a joint statement expressing readiness to 
work for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. Russian 
diplomats think that even though the document is of general 
nature it can be viewed as an impressive step to normalize the 
situation in and around Tajikistan.

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- Two years of military talks 
between Russia and Moldavia [Moldova] have resulted in the 
signing and implementation of seven bilateral agreements and the 
withdrawal of three Russian units from Moldavia and disbandment 
of 18 more located in the republic, Colonel-General Eduard 
Vorobyov, first deputy commander of the Russian land forces, 
said. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday, 
Vorobyov 
said that currently six new agreements are being prepared for 
signing, including on the legal status and terms of and 
procedure for the withdrawal of Russian troops temporarily 
stationed in Moldavia. 
  These issues were in the centre of attention at the seven 
round of talks between the governmental delegations of Russia 
and Moldavia held in Kishinev [Chisinau] on April 5-6, Vorobyov 
said. 
  It is hard to set the time of the withdrawal of the 14th 
Russian Army from Moldavia because of the absence of progress in 
resolving the Dniester conflict. The self-proclaimed Dniester 
Republic has been insisting on special political status for 
itself. 
  Another reason for disagreements at the talks is the 
legislation of the Dniester Republic which contradicts Moldavian 
laws. "We are criticised that the talks are moving slowly, and 
this is fair enough," Vorobyov said. 
  Asked about the disagreements between the commanders of the 
14th Army and the Dniester leaders, Vorobyov stressed that they 
are not crucial and cannot affect the course of talks. 
  Both the leaders and the population of the Dniester Republic 
are interested in Russian military presence in the region, 
Vorobyov continued. "But we are interested in bringing the 
armed forces within Russia's borders, so that the troops were 
gathered together and sorted out," he said.

completion of the Uruguay round of the multilateral trade talks, 
which went on for over seven years, is a major step towards a 
greater openness of world markets and services, a reduction in 
tariff and non-tariff trade restrictions and the establishment

committee on trade negotiations. He expressed the hope that the 
principles of free trade and fair competition, which were 
endorsed by the results of the Uruguay round, will produce 
increased mutual trade between countries and on this basis a 
growth of national economies and the world economy as a whole. 
  Russia, the minister went on to say, is interested in 
strengthening the multilateral trade system and also assumes 
that it will be able in the shortest possible time to become an 
integral part of the system. In striving to join GATT and the 
World Trade Organization (WTO), whose creation will be announced 
in Marrakech, Russia is pursuing absolutely specific practical 
goals and the realistic creation of more favorable conditions 
for its exports. Full membership of GATT is an essential 
condition for Russia's integration into the world economy, which 
is of particular importance for the country. The Russian 
minister noted that this process will seriously facilitate the 
speeding and deepening of market reforms in Russia on the basis 
of the experience amassed in GATT over the decades. In this 
connection the speaker on behalf of the Russian Government 
confirmed its firm intention to complete creating a 
market-oriented open economy at minimum social cost. 
  Speaking about the Russian economic situation, Oleg Davydov 
said that in the space of just over two years fundamental 
changes have taken place in Russia. The state monopoly in 
foreign trade, which existed for over 70 years, has been 
dismantled in the process of economic liberalization. 
Administrative barriers with respect to imports have been 
lifted, and restrictions on export operations have been 
significantly decreased. The customs tariff is now being used 
as a basic instrument of Russian trade policy. The price 
mechanism and currency regulation have been liberalized to a 
considerable extent, and large-scale privatization is being 
implemented. 
  Russia's aim is to enter the World Trade Organization. A 
flexible mechanism needs to be worked out to enable the process 
for its accession into GATT to be transformed into entry into 
the WTO. Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization will 
be an important event for others besides Russia. On the basis 
of a reasonable balance of rights and obligations, the sides 
reaching agreement will gain in the shape of Russia a capacious 
market of goods, services and capital. Even now, in the 
conditions of economic instability caused by the transition from 
a strict planned system to a liberal market system, we are 
seeing a great interest in cooperation with Russia, the minister 
noted. He stressed that the obligations which Russia will 
assume as a member of the WTO will be an additional guarantee of 
the stability and predictability of the conditions for doing 
business with it and for the access of foreign goods to its 
market. We hope that the Uruguay round was the last which our 
country observed from the sidelines, the Russian minister of 
foreign economic relations said.

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- Talks between Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his South Korean counterpart 
Han Sung-chu began in Moscow today. 
  The first item of the agenda is the preparation of a visit 
of 
President of the Republic of Korea Kim Yong-sam to Russia, which 
is scheduled for early June, Kozyrev said before the beginning 
of the talks. Speaking about the nuclear problem at the Korean 
Peninsula, Kozyrev pointed out that "unfortunately, bilateral 
efforts did not bring the desired results, and, I think, we 
should expand the range of consultations and consider some other 
approaches in order to get the problem out of a deadlock by 
joint efforts." 
  Han Sung-chu said in his turn that it was the fifth meeting 
of the Russian and South Korean foreign ministers, which is an 
indication of good relations between the two countries. 
  Han Sung-chu will tell Kozyrev about Kim Yong-sam's meetings 
with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and China's 
leader Jiang Zemin during his recent visits to those countries, 
Kim Sok-kyu, South Korea's ambassador to Russia, told ITAR-TASS. 
The Republic of Korea would like to establish close contacts 
with Russia on the nuclear problem of North Korea, the South 
Korean ambassador said. 
  According to Kim Sok-kyu, the ministers will discuss 
Moscow's 
proposals on holding an international conference on ensuring the 
security and the nuclear-free status of the Korean Peninsula. 
The South Korean Government is highly appreciating the proposal 
and regarding it as a friendly step of Russia, aimed at settling 
problems of the Korean Peninsula. How, he continued, the issue 
is being examined by the U.N. Security Council, and it is 
worthwhile to wait and see how those problems will be settled 
within the U.N. framework.

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- "We cannot allow any state 
to violate the nuclear non-proliferation regime," Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said on Thursday. 
  Speaking about the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsular at 
a press briefing after his talks with his visiting South Korean 
counterpart Han Sung-chu, Kozyrev said that the demilitarisation 
of the peninsular is an uncompromising question for Russia. 
  He said Russia is seeking to normalise the situation, 
promote 
security and ensure trust in the region located in proximity to 
the Russian borders. 
  "We have agreed with the foreign minister of South Korea to 
maintain contacts on the entire spectrum of problems. No one 
rejects Russia's proposal to hold an international conference on 
security and nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsular," he 
said. 
  Kozyrev noted that, like in case with NATO air strikes in 
Bosnia, the Russian side is not pleased when it is asked to save 
the situation or vote for some sanctions or decisions adopted at 
some talks without its participation. 
  Asked about prospects for imposing sanctions on North Korea 
over the nuclear problem, the Russian minister stressed "We will 
not consider measures which do not follow from our direct and 
substantial participation in all stages of the discussion of 
respective problems."

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Apr -- South Korea views as 
"constructive" Russia's proposal to convene a multipartite 
conference on questions of the security and nuclear-free status 
of the Korean peninsula. This was stated today by Han Sung-chu, 
the foreign minister of the Republic of Korea at a meeting with 
Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma of the Russian 
Federation Federal Assembly. The South Korean minister is in 
Moscow on an official visit. 
  The Russian initiative provides for the participation in 
such 
a conference by both Korean states, Russia, the United States, 
China, Japan and also the United Nations and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Together with all the interested parties, the minister said, 
we will continue to analyze and study this proposal in an active 
way. 
  Relations with the Republic of Korea, I. Rybkin noted, are a 
priority in Russian foreign policy. There is no doubt 
whatsoever that we are worried by the situation which has 
developed on the Korean peninsula. 
  The chairman of the State Duma told the South Korean 
minister 
about the work of the Russian Parliament, stressing the 
importance of interparliamentary ties. 
  Han Sung-chu conveyed the wish of the Republic of Korea 
President Kim Yong-sam to address the Russian parliamentarians 
during the course of his coming visit to Moscow. He invited 
Ivan Rybkin to pay a visit to South Korea.

  [Excerpts] Moscow, 14 Apr -- Han Sung-chu, foreign minister 
of the Republic of Korea, today ended the official part of his 
visit to the Russian capital. He described as "constructive" 
the Russian proposal to convene a multilateral conference on 
security problems in the Korean Peninsula, and agreed in general 
the program for the upcoming visit to Moscow on 1-4 June by 
President Kim Yong-sam. 
  Today he held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and met the chairmen of both chambers of the Federal 
Assembly. 
  According to Han Sung-chu, South Korea, together with all 
involved parties, will continue to actively analyze and study 
the Russian initiative that intends to gather at one table 
representatives of both Korean states, Russia, the United 
States, China, Japan, and also the United Nations and the IAEA. 
[passage omitted] 
  The head of the Russian foreign relations department said, 
on 
the whole, relations between Russia and the Republic of Korea 
were on a rising trend, as it had been envisaged during 
President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Seoul, and the upcoming visit 
by President Kim Yong-sam to Moscow demonstrated this. A solid 
package of agreements will be prepared for it, inter alia a 
political document. 
  Han Sung-chu told journalists it was expected that during 
the 
upcoming Russian-South Korean summit issues of bilateral 
cooperation and international problems, including the situation 
in northeast Asia and in the Korean Peninsula, would be 
discussed. The heads of state, he said, will exchange opinions 
regarding cooperation not only on the bilateral basis, but on 
the multilateral basis within the framework of international 
organizations. 
  Han Sung-chu arrived in Moscow on Wednesday from where he 
will leave for London on Friday.

  [Text] Moscow April 15 TASS -- Russia is completely 
satisfied with its talks with South Korea's Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu, whose official visit to Moscow was concluded on 
Friday. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov told 
ITAR-TASS that the talks had proved very productive. 
  First of all, Panov said, the two countries have begun 
laying 
the groundwork for South Korean President Kim Yong-sam's visit 
to the Russian capital in June. A package of bilateral 
documents will be prepared for the Russian-Korean summit 
meeting, and will include a political document. Moscow and 
Seoul have also begun preparing a series of bilateral 
agreements, some of them economic. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's negotiations with 
Han Sung-chu contained a substantive exchange of opinions 
concerning the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula. The two 
sides agreed to maintain close cooperation in that question. 
  The South Korean delegation positively responded to Russia's 
proposal to call an international conference on the security and 
nuclear status of the Korean peninsula. Seoul considers it 
possible to widen the proposed conference's possible agenda. 
Another possible topic of discussion for the conference is 
cooperation in various fields with the sub-region, Aleksandr 
Panov said.

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- Russia is now working out an 
agreement which would allow North Korea to lumber woods in its 
eastern regions, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said. 
  Speaking to journalists after his talks with visiting South 
Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu in Moscow on Thursday, 
Kozyrev said that the agreement will reflect two aspects -- 
Russia's interest in cooperation with North Korea in lumbering 
and guarantees of personal safety and human rights for any 
person staying in the Russian Federation by the highest 
international standards. 
  "At the same time we understand the interest and concern of 
the Republic of Korea because this involves its compatriots," he 
continued. 
  "In this connection we discussed the Russian approach 
towards 
the enforcement of the rights of our compatriots, including in 
the countries that have emerged on the territory of the former 
Soviet Union," he said. 
  "We speak not about interference in anyone's internal 
affairs 
or manifestations of an imperial approach. We speak about our 
natural interest in enforcing human rights," Kozyrev said.

  [Text] Moscow, April 14 (YONHAP) -- Russia is willing to 
help South Korea resettle North Korean loggers in Siberia 
seeking refuge and the governments of the two countries will 
soon hold working-level discussions on the matter, Korean 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Thursday. 
  Han, who arrived in Russia Wednesday for a three-day visit, 
told Korean reporters that Moscow had expressed its willingness 
to cooperate with Seoul in helping North Korean escapees from 
Siberian logging camps wishing to resettle in South Korea after 
a meeting with his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev. Some 170 
escapees, out of an estimated 25,000 loggers at Pyongyang-run 
camps in Siberia whose human rights are allegedly violated, are 
said to be seeking asylum in the South. 
  Seoul pledged on Wednesday to help them resettle either in 
the South or in a third country in accordance with international 
law. The two foreign ministers are reportedly near agreement on 
the issue. 
  Han urged Moscow not to repatriate the loggers to North 
Korea 
and instead offer them residential rights, and Kozyrev gave his 
word that no forcible repatriation would occur. Han told 
reporters he had the impression that Moscow would back Seoul in 
future action on the matter. 
  Expressing sympathy for Seoul's interest in the North Korean 
escapees, Kozyrev said their future lies in their desire to seek 
freedom, adding that they can live where they like. 
  Han said he understood Kozyrev's remarks as reflecting a 
willingness to give the loggers residential rights: Once they 
had the legal right to stay in Russia, they could make their way 
to South Korea because foreigners with such rights can travel 
freely abroad. Han asked that the North Korean loggers be given 
the status of international refugees by involving the U.N. High 
Commissioner [UNHC] on refugees while Moscow proposed bilateral 
discussions to settle the problem, offering to cooperate "If 
they want to go to South Korea and if the South will accept 
them". Han said he explained that in order to confirm the wishes 
of the escapees and refute North Korea's claims of "kidnapping," 
UNHCR involvement was necessary. 
  Kozyrev said consideration could be given to regarding the 
loggers as refugees, but it was not needed. The Russian minister 
said that no heed should be paid to Pyongyang's threats and that 
Seoul-Moscow cooperation was sufficient to solve the problem. 
  Han said that since Moscow was being very cooperative, the 
U.N. body's involvement may be unnecessary and that the loggers' 
fate should soon be addressed at the working level. 
  Russian Foreign Ministry officials said Pyongyang had 
strongly protested to Moscow for not repatriating the loggers 
until recently, but nowadays makes no complaints. 
  Kozyrev said Moscow will continue its logging cooperation 
with Pyongyang, but promised to include human rights provisions 
in the renewed contract. North Korea and Russia are currently 
negotiating renewal of their logging contract that expired at 
the end of last year, but are making little progress due to 
Pyongyang's opposition to human rights provisions. 
  Han and Kozyrev also discussed the North Korean nuclear 
issue, the Korean seeking Moscow's continued support and the 
Russian reiterating his country's preference for a nuclear-free 
Korean peninsula. 
  Kozyrev, at a joint press conference after the talks, said 
it 
was too early to talk about economic sanctions against North 
Korea and that Russia's involvement was vital. 
  The two ministers also discussed President Kim Yong-sam's 
official visit to Russia in early June and agreed to sign 
various agreements to improve bilateral relations during his 
stay.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Skosyrev report: "Chief of General Staff Pays </F>
Secret Visit to Beijing"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- Journalists' attempts to discover the 
substance of the talks between Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the 
Russian Army General Staff, and his Chinese colleagues have been 
unsuccessful. 
  Following General Pavel Grachev's trip to Beijing ties 
between the two neighboring powers' armies have been 
strengthening. Contacts are developing between neighboring 
military districts and there has been an exchange of visits by 
naval vessels. All these are a natural consequence of the 
normalization of relations between Moscow and Beijing. 
  But observers in Asian states bordering China and in the 
West 
are asking whether the sale of Russian arms to China will pose a 
threat to the states of South and Southeast Asia. After all, 
China has some outstanding territorial problems with some of 
them. 
  Doubts have arisen above all because many aspects of the 
military-technical ties between China and Russia have been 
cloaked in secrecy. For instance, a Western colleague showed me 
the text of the agreement on cooperation between the two defense 
ministers. One article in it envisages that Russia will send its 
specialists to China to overhaul arms and to train Chinese 
personnel. Is this article present in the agreement? 
  By avoiding the press General Kolesnikov has essentially 
turned his official visit into a semisecret meeting, providing 
grounds for new suspicions in Asian capitals.

  From now on economic, and other activities in the border 
zone

  [Text] Hanoi April 15 TASS -- The third session of the 
Russo-Vietnamese intergovernmental commission for commercial, 
economic, scientific and technological cooperation was rounded 
off here today by the signing of an agreement on cooperation in 
the sphere of communications and of a bilateral protocol. 
  Taking part in the work of the session was a Russian 
delegation led by Vice-Premier Yuriy Yarov. The sides noted 
during the final plenary meeting that it was necessary to 
promote bilateral economic relations on the basis of a new 
mechanism. They agreed to hold the fourth session of the 
intergovernmental commission in Moscow in the first quarter of 
1995. 
  Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, Yarov highly assessed the Hanoi 
negotiations which focused particularly on problems linked with 
the forthcoming visit of Vietnamese Premier Vo Van Kiet to 
Russia. "We hope," the Russian vice-premier noted, "that the 
visit of the head of the Vietnamese Government to Moscow, 
scheduled for June, will be fruitful and will contribute to the 
development of mutually advantageous economic cooperation. We 
do not intend to give up our positions on the Vietnamese market, 
particularly as regards the supply of machinery and equipment," 
Yarov said. 
  Commenting on the results of the talks, the head of the 
Russian delegation told a press conference here today that 
Russia and Vietnam were now exerting joint efforts to do away 
with the pause that had appeared in their bilateral relations. 
"We have devoted special attention to concrete areas of 
cooperation, for instance, in the sphere of energetics, oil 
extraction and agriculture," he stressed. 
  The Russian side attaches great importance to the 
establishment of direct contacts between the regions of Russia 
and the Vietnamese partners. This is why the Russian delegation 
included Bashkortostan President Rakhimov and head of the 
Krasnoyarsk territorial administration Zubov. 
  The Russian Government delegation today flew to the city of 
Da Nang in central Vietnam.

  [Text] Dushanbe 14 April, TASS -- Russian border guards 
detained two Tajik opposition militants who tried to cross into 
Tajikistan from neighbouring Afghanistan on Wednesday, military 
sources in Dushanbe said today. 
  Two days earlier Afghanistan-based militants opened gunfire 
on one of the border villages. No casualties among villagers or 
border guards were reported. 
  On 11 April opposition fighters attacked an ambulance 
belonging to the local hospital. A doctor who was travelling in 
it was wounded. 
  The Tajik Government is preparing a note of protest to 
Afghan 
authorities over these incidents. 
  At the same time, independent observers report that over the 
last six months three such notes were sent to the Afghan 
Government, but none of them has been answered yet.

  [Text] Vice-President of Kazakhstan Erik Asanbayev said 
that President Nursultan Nazarbayev will not attend the CIS 
summit not because of "a diplomatic disease," but due to an 
acute bout of Radiculitis. He said that the illness struck 
during Nazarbayev's visit to Japan. "The president was 
struggling, but the aggravation did not pass, therefore he is 
staying in bed," Asanbayev told INTERFAX upon arrival in Moscow 
on Thursday. 
  Asanbayev noted that he supports all economic documents 
prepared for the summit, but he has some remarks concerning 
drafts on the rights of ethnic minorities. 
  Asked an INTERFAX correspondent whether Alma-Ata [Almaty] is 
embarrassed that Nazarbayev's idea of a Eurasian Union caused a 
mixed reaction, Asanbayev pointed out that "in general, there 
are no simple answers in the world, everybody has his own point 
of view on the same phenomenon." 
  "We are following closely the reaction to this proposal and 
at the same time trying to work on it in detail," the 
vice-president said.

  [Text] The situation is exceedingly tense in the Karabakh 
conflict zone where intensive military operations are continuing 
on the north and northeastern sectors of the front. The 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army headquarters press 
service reported that the Azerbaijani troops are not refraining 
from attempts to advance in certain sectors. Military 
operations have resumed in these sectors as of this morning. 
The Azerbaijani air force is also not slackening its activity. 
Having sustained strong a counteroffensive on the southern 
regions of Mardakert on 13 April, the enemy suffered substantial 
losses and was forced to retreat to its initial positions. In 
general, the Karabakh forces are reliably controlling the 
situation all along the front. 
  Armenian Defense Ministry press service reported that new 
tension arose on the northeastern border of Armenia during the 
daytime on 13 April. Using various types of weapons, the 
Azerbaijani Army opened fired on Voskepar in Noyemberyanskiy 
Rayon, and on Aygepar, Nerkin-Karmiragpyur, and Movses and 
defensive positions around these villages in Tavushskiy Rayon. 
The artillery shelling in Noyemberyanskiy Rayon continued for 
five hours. The Armenian border guards were forced to retaliate 
and suppress the enemy fire. There were no casualties on our 
side. 
  The press service also reported that another cease-fire 
violation took place yesterday on the southwestern border of 
Armenia. The Nakhichevani military units fired for an hour on 
Shagat, and on Arevis in Sisianskiy Rayon. There are no 
casualties. Our troops did not retaliate. 
  Relative calm prevailed on Armenia's borders last night and 
early this morning. However, the enemy opened machine-gun and 
howitzer fire on border positions in Idzhevanskiy Rayon 
(?today). There are injured. The Armenian Army fighters took 
countermeasures.

  [Text] Moscow 14 April, TASS -- Ukrainian authorities have 
kicked eighteen naval officers of the Black Sea Fleet out of 
their flats. They were evicted with their families and all 
their belongings after they refused to swear allegiance to 
Ukraine, a source in the naval press centre told ITAR-TASS. 
  Ukrainian troops have already seized the unit's ships and 
hoisted the yellow-blue Ukrainian flags on their masts. 
  The Black Sea Fleet command is now taking measures to 
evacuate its officers and their families from Odessa. 
  [At 1700 GMT on 14 April Kiev Ukrainian Radio First Program 
Network in Ukrainian reports: "The head of the Ukrainian Navy 
press-center, captain third rank Mykola Savchenko has described 
as misinformation the ITAR-TASS report alleging that 18 officers 
and warrant officers in Odessa who had not sworn an oath of 
allegiance to Ukraine were evicted. (?Ordinary) servicemen are 
being misrepresented as (?sufferers) for the cause, stressed the 
head of the Ukrainian Navy press center."]

  [Text] The Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev left for the 
Russian capital today to attend the meeting of the CIS heads of 
state in Moscow. The Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev and 
those accompanying him on the trip were seen off at Baku's Bina 
Airport by Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Republic's Supreme 
Soviet; Afiaddin Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of the Republic's 
Supreme Soviet; deputy prime ministers, ministers, and other 
officials. The Azerbaijani leader granted an interview to our 
correspondent Beshir Sherifov at the airport. 
  [Begin recording] [Sherifov] Mr. President, you are leaving 
for an official visit to Moscow and will hold talks with the 
heads of state of CIS countries. What will the benefit of these 
talks be for Azerbaijan? 
  [Aliyev] As you know, we are going to attend the regular 
meeting of the CIS. The CIS heads of state will discuss matters 
on the agenda of the meeting. We will take part in these 
discussions. A number of important problems will be discussed 
there. We have our own views on these issues. However, during 
this meeting I mainly intend to raise once again the need to 
prevent Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan. This is 
because, as I said, a war between CIS members is abnormal, it is 
an abnormal situation. Therefore, this issue is my main 
concern. I consider it more important than other issues, 
because Armenia's Armed Forces offensive against Azerbaijan is 
continuing. Intensive attacks were also launched yesterday. 
Before arriving here at the airport in the morning, I contacted 
the commanders at the front. The Armenian Armed Forces are 
continuing their attacks today. They are not stopping their 
aggressive actions and intentions. I intend to raise these 
issues in strong terms. I also want to state that our military 
units and fighters are able to resist the attacks of the 
Armenian Armed Forces and are dealing them deserved replies and 
blows. However, sadly enough, the Armenian side still fails to 
draw the necessary conclusion from this. 
  I addressed the nation and the entire world on 12 April on 
Armenia's aggression. Reports coming in yesterday showed that 
my appeal to the world has been positively received. We have 
already received reaction from various countries. However, what 
pleases me most is that our people, the Azerbaijani citizens, 
have highly appraised this address. The commander of the troops 
headquarters at the front, deputy defense minister, commander of 
the troops in Agdere [Mardakertskiy] and Geranboy 
[Shaumyanovskiy], and other commanders informed me last night 
that after my address many of the deserters returned to the Army 
yesterday and are taking part in the fighting. A certain sector 
informed me yesterday that more than 100 deserters have 
returned. I highly appreciate such a thing. And therefore, I 
gave orders yesterday that they be pardoned for the crime they 
committed by deserting. And, now through the television I am 
addressing our young people who have deserted or evaded the 
mobilization: Let them come to their senses and follow the path 
of those young people who have taken the correct path. I was 
very pleased when informed at night that the deserters are now 
returning to their units. This means that our people and youth 
are acting with reason and conscience. I believe that some of 
them might have fallen onto the wrong path out of objective 
reasons, inexperience, or youthfulness. However, what is 
satisfying is that they are now becoming aware of their 
responsibilities. 
  In one word, our army units are standing firm on the fronts. 
The attacks resumed early this morning. However, these attacks 
are being checked and repulsed, and I am sure that it will 
continue to be thus and our homeland will be defended. However, 
as I said on 12 April and I am saying now, we want to put an end 
to the war. I have invited the Armenian side to peace talks. 
After an hour I will be in Moscow and there I will make the 
same call to the leadership of both Armenia and Russia, and 
other CIS leaders. Let us see. I have not lost hope, and I 
expect that our views would produce some positive results. 
  [Sherifov] Cables arriving at Azerbaijan television prove 
that your address to the nation was well received and the people 
are expecting much from your meeting in Moscow. 
  [Aliyev] I also have such an expectation. We will see. [end 
recording]

  [Text] A special session of Saeima (Latvia's parliament) on 
terms for the withdrawal of Russian troops, scheduled for April 
15, will not take place. A decision to this effect was adopted 
by the Saeima's presidium at a request from President Guntis 
Ulmanis and Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs. 
  The decision notes that "there is no legal ground" for such 
debate since a meeting between the presidents of the two 
countries slated for April 20 has been put off indefinitely 
after an incident with Yeltsin's ruling on a military base in 
Latvia. The Latvian leadership insists that Yeltsin officially 
revoke the document, which has been repudiated by Russian 
foreign and defence ministry officials already.

  [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas delivered a 
speech at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in 
Strasbourg today. 
  In his speech, as expected, the Lithuanian president devoted 
a great deal of attention to problems concerning 
Lithuanian-Russian relations, Baltic News Service reports. At 
the same time, Brazauskas urged the West to give stronger 
support to Central and Eastern European states in their 
aspirations to become members of the European Union. According 
to the president, the maintaining of good relations with the 
neighboring countries is a priority task for Lithuania, and so 
far there are no serious obstacles for Lithuania to have 
relations of good-neighborliness and cooperation with Russia, 
Poland, and Belarus. 
  But the Lithuanian president drew attention to, according to 
him, a feature that has emerged lately in Russia's relations 
with its neighbors. Further events bear witness to the fact 
that it is not easy to change the established stereotypes in 
relations with smaller neighbors, stressed Algirdas Brazauskas. 
In his opinion, Russia's relations with the neighboring 
countries should correspond with universally recognized 
principles of international law. Russia's respect for the 
sovereignty of the Baltic states, the repudiation of the concept 
of Near Abroad, and the implementation of international 
agreements will accelerate a positive decision by the Council of 
Europe on the membership of that country. 
  He said that it is especially important to Lithuania whether 
the Kaliningrad region, the former military advanced post of the 
Soviet Union, is gradually demilitarized and becomes an active 
business zone. We feel positive efforts by Moscow and 
Kaliningrad in this direction, but sometimes contrary tendencies 
can be noticed, too. 
  Speaking of the expansion of the European Union, Algirdas 
Brazauskas noted that the success of the integration by the 
Baltic states is very dependent on Latvia's membership in the 
Council of Europe. A unique ethnic composition of the 
population created during the Soviet occupation has emerged in 
Latvia, but problems connected with this should not be cause the 
postponement of its full membership. 
  Brazauskas said that, in his view, Russia was able to 
implement democracy and avoid the breakthrough of menacing 
military forces. Therefore, the procedure for Russia's 
membership started in the Parliamentary Assembly is a political 
and moral support for the democratic forces in that country. 
The withdrawal of the Russian Army from the territories of 
Latvia and Estonia by 31 August will very favorably reflect 
Russia's intention to peacefully regulate its relations with its 
neighbors. 
  In his speech, the Lithuanian president assessed as a great 
political success the initialled Lithuanian-Polish treaty, which 
bears witness to the increasing mutual understanding of both 
nations and puts a juridical full stop to the historical 
disputes of both countries. 
  He explained Lithuania's stance on the Jewish genocide 
during 
the Second World War. I grieve because of the large number of 
victims and regret that some Lithuanians took part in the 
punitive actions. Therefore, I firmly state that all criminals 
whom justice has not reached yet should be exposed and punished. 
We are doing this consistently and invite all the interested 
organizations and persons to cooperate. Maybe, not everything 
has been said about those tragic events, but we are not afraid 
to talk about this and with open hearts seek mutual 
understanding both with Israel and with Jewish communities in 
our and in other states. 
  Speaking at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of 
Europe, Brazauskas said that so far, only the irrevocability of 
the process of reforms has been assured in the country. But it 
has not yet been achieved that the reforms become a source of 
well-being and progress of all the citizens, Baltic News Service 
reports.

  [Text] Vilnius, 14 Apr, BNS -- Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas on 8 April named Lieutenant Colonel 
Audronius Beisys, Army vehicles engineer, to be aide-de-camp to 
the president. 
  A President's Office official said Brazauskas had no 
aide-de-camp until now because "we could not afford one." 
  The principal function of an aide-de-camp is to assist the 
president in fulfilling his duties as the supreme commander in 
chief of the Armed Forces. 
  Until his present appointment, Beisys, 41, served as acting 
commander of the Gelezinis Vilkas (Iron Wolf) infantry brigade. 
He is a graduate of a Soviet military academy in Leningrad and

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 15 Apr -- Russia must not join the Council 
of Europe, and it has no need to cooperate with NATO. This was 
the theme of a news conference given today by Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
[LDPR], in the State Duma. In a 40-minute address, he summed up 
his impressions of his trip to Strasbourg as a member of a 
Russian parliamentary delegation. 
  In the presence of a host of media representatives, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy lashed out at the West without being too fussy over 
his language. If Russia joined the Council of Europe, "a 
struggle will be waged against us for our money," the LDPR 
leader claimed. Nor should Russia, in his view, cooperate with 
NATO. "We are glad that the country's political leadership has 
taken a correct step in that direction. We support the 
president's decision not to sign the `Partnership for Peace' 
program," he declared. 
  Speaking in his usual manner, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy vented 
his wrath on "the Zionists and Americans." The French came in 
for some of his anger too for not having allowed him to travel 
outside Strasbourg. So did the Turks, "who hate all Slavs," and 
also the British, who "plundered the world first of all, yet 
have now become conservative, protecting their plunder, and have 
foisted their language on the whole world." 
  Apart from the Third World War, which has, he claimed, 
already begun in Yugoslavia, the LDPR leader also predicted an 
imminent civil war in Russia, of which "those who are running 
the country today will be guilty."

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report under the "Experiments" rubric: </F>
"Investments Are Easier To Get With Gaydar's Approval. 
Yaroslavl Oblast Conducts Examination of Investment Projects"] 
  [Text] The Institute for a Transitional Period Economy 
[ITPE], headed by Yegor Gaydar, and the Yaroslavl Oblast 
administration have extended their cooperation in 1994 whose 
result is a program of selective policy [selektivnaya politika] 
for the oblast's enterprises. The Yaroslavl authorities have 
decided to support the initiative of their Nizhniy Novgorod 
neighbors and to invite the prominent economist from Moscow to 
carry out a local reform. 
  The absence of a broad-based promotion for the project in 
Russia is explained by the fact that it is almost completely 
geared to Western investors. Thus, unlike Nizhniy Novgorod, 
Yaroslavl is only interested in money rather than in an image of 
economic well-being: Yegor Gaydar is not going to "build 
capitalism in a separate oblast." The Gaydar institute has 
examined all investment applications and turned down some of 
them, in particular an international airport project. 
  Generally, the "selective policy" a la Gaydar in Yaroslavl 
Oblast is fully free of territorial and sectoral constraints. 
The ITPE has elaborated criteria for the projects of 
enterprises that are in need of investments. The main criterion 
should naturally be returns on investments. This applies not 
only to projects in the social sphere. The oblast's budget, 
too, has undergone ITPE examination and, in Mr. Gaydar's words, 
has been considerable altered. One result of these alterations, 
the project's authors think, is a "relative socioeconomic 
stability" in the region. The only serious problem the oblast 
faces is the "inordinately high unemployment level" attributed 
to the fact that concentrated in the region is a labor-intensive 
light industry that is going through a crisis in the absence of 
consumer demand. That sharply reduces the number of jobs. 
  Yegor Gaydar has named among the most promising projects the 
development of the tourism and services spheres. He has not 
shared the governor's enthusiasm for the production of 
agricultural equipment, however, because he thinks it is not 
going to find consumer demand. 
  The administration is most unlikely to receive money from 
Western partners without Gaydar's positive findings. This is 
perhaps why his cooperation has been sought -- the trust in 
Gaydar's name in the West will make it possible for Yaroslavl 
resident to attract the necessary investments.

  [Text] This evening, Radio Liberty informed about a news 
conference by Igor Kasatonov, deputy commander of the Russian 
Navy, which was held in St. Petersburg. [Word indistinct] 
according to Igor Kasatonov, Russian units located in the Crimea 
were ordered to stand on alert. The admiral's reason for this 
was Ukraine's alleged intent to capture naval bases in [name 
indistinct], Mykolayev, and Ochakov. 
  The Defense Ministry press service commented on this 
statement by the Russian military leader calling it 
disinformation intended to create hysteria around the Black Sea 
Fleet. The press service considers Kasatonov's statement about 
Ukraine's plans to capture the mentioned bases as absolutely 
unfounded. At the same time, the press service stresses that 
there are no Russian military units on Ukrainian territory; the 
only units there are those subordinated to the presidents of 
Russia and Ukraine.

arrival in Moscow that the incident involving the Black Sea 
vessel and seamen in Odessa is over and done with. Kravchuk 
noted: As far as politicians are concerned, the main thing was 
to regard it precisely in this light. Moreover, the incident is 
not as big as it was made out to be. The Ukrainian president's 
view is that it is a signal to begin solving the Black Sea 
fleet's problems without delay.

  [Text] On the eve of the last session of the Crimean 
Supreme Council of old convocation that was held on 12 April 
under N. Bagrov's chairmanship, Ukrainian Radio programs were 
interrupted and the speech by Vyacheslav Lebedev, press 
secretary of the Crimean president, was broadcast live. He said 
that, by edict of [Crimean president] Yu. Meshkov, Minister of 
Internal Affairs of the Crimean Republic Oleksandr Plyuta had 
been dismissed from his post and replaced by Major General 
Valeriy Kuznetsov. Chairman of Ukraine's Security Service for 
the Crimean Republic Ivan Kolomytsev was also dismissed and 
replaced by Vladimir Lepikhov. Ministerial appointments were 
also made: Lyudmila Zaytseva became minister of finance and 
Andrey Chernyavskiy of economy. 
  The Presidium of the Crimean Supreme Council adopted a 
decision to hold a session of the newly elected parliament on 10 
May 1994. The commission for the election of the Crimean 
people's deputies was authorized to take upon itself the duties 
of the district electoral commission for Ukrainian presidential 
elections. N. Bagrov pointed out that the appointment of 
Crimean power ministers, without a coordination with 
corresponding Ukrainian departments, was illegal.

  [Text] Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has stated 
that Moscow and Kiev have no mutual understanding over the 
recent incidents in Odessa. Russia will take measures of its 
own in response to Kiev's actions, Pavel Grachev asserted. 
  The Russian defense minister also voiced his opinion about 
replacing Russia's peacekeeping forces with UN units in CIS 
hotspots. He considers that this cannot be done since the UN 
does not have the money for this, they are unlikely to find 
anyone willing to go these hotspots and, furthermore, the CIS 
heads want to see on their territories only units of the Russian 
Armed Forces.

  [Text] Moscow, 15 Apr -- Since September 1993 Russia has 
been totally financing the Black Sea Fleet. Thus, the fleet is 
Russian even with regard to its means of existence, Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told journalists after a news 
conference given by the CIS leaders. There can be no question 
of paying rent in this case, the army general stressed. 
Moreover, in these conditions Ukraine's security in the Black 
Sea is being provided at Russia's expense. 
  Asked by journalists whether there has been any change in 
the 
top military circles' attitude to President Bill Clinton's 
"Partnership for Peace" initiative, Grachev said: "Until very 
recently I was an active supporter of signing the proposed U.S. 
concept very quickly. The recent development of the situation 
in Bosnia and Herzegovina, however, has shown that that the 
concept proposed by the U.S. President is good only in words. 
We have gained the impression that our 'partners' are acting 
behind our backs. I am not afraid to change my opinion if I 
have been mistaken," the Russian defense minister said in 
conclusion, "and I have now changed it."

  [Text] We have received a report from the press center of 
Russia's Navy which says in part: The Ukrainian mass media have 
carried a statement from the republic's Foreign Ministry 
alleging that Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander in chief of the 
Russian Navy, called off a meeting which the Ukrainian and 
Russian sides were to hold jointly with the command and 
officers' corps of the Black Sea Fleet. The press center 
describes as not in accord with reality the report that 
representatives of the Russian Government had visited Odessa. 
In connection with this, the press center of the Russian Navy 
states authoritatively that the Russian delegation received a 
refusal from all levels of the Foreign Ministry and the Defence 
Ministry of Ukraine. 
  Meanwhile, an extraordinary meeting of the CIS defense 
ministers has taken place in Moscow. Taking part were the 
military ministers of the states which signed the treaty on 
collective security. Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy 
Radetskyy was present as an observer. Quite naturally, 
journalists asked Radetskyy about the rumors that an act of 
force is being prepared against the brigade of Russian river 
vessels stationed in Izmail. Here is what he replied: 
  [Radetskyy] "No such action is being prepared. This report 
is not objective. An end should be put to all of this. We are 
only giving grounds for the extremists and nationalists to 
enflame these passions and this does nothing to improve mutual 
relations between the two neighbors." 
  The Ukrainian defense minister also commented on his own 
decree on the resubordination of Division 318. 
  [Radetskyy] "No such division should exist on the territory 
of Ukraine, particularly in Odessa, if the leaders of this 
division give the command to use weapons without warning." 
  After this extraordinary meeting an unofficial meeting took 
place between Vitaliy Radetskyy and Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev which, alas, did not produce any particular 
results. Here is what Pavel Grachev said: 
  [Grachev] "It was precisely the Ukrainian authorities which 
provoked this action. Its opinion is rather different. It says 
in its defense that the decision was made to use weapons. But 
no one used any. Therefore, of course, we did not reach mutual 
agreement. I pointed out to them that their action was 
unilateral and was thus outside the framework of the Yalta 
Agreement."

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 15, BNS -- Accusations of human rights 
abuses and of plans of massive deportations brought against 
Estonia at a meeting of the Congress of Russian Communities in 
Moscow on Apr. 12 are political fiction, Estonian Population 
Affairs Minister Peeter Olesk said. 
  Olesk in an interview with BNS reminded that the accusers 
themselves are having much to be ashamed of in their own actions 
in the past, referring to Russia's centuries-old practice of 
deportation of people from occupied territories. 
  "They are now turning their own fears and sins against the 
country whose territory they are still partly keeping under 
control, by keeping their army here," the Estonian minister said. 
  The Congress of Russian Communities at the Moscow meeting 
addressed to the Russian president and the government an appeal 
from Estonia's Russian community, criticizing the policies of 
the Estonian authorities and calling for Moscow's help. 
  The document accuses Estonia of plans to start a massive 
deportation of its Russian-speakers, for which, it claims, 
concentration camps are being set up and a police special force 
created in the country. 
  "The Estonian people have repeatedly suffered massive 
deportations at least from the time of the Livonian war 
(1558-83) up until this century. This is a background that the 
West doesn't know or doesn't attach proper significance to, and 
it is our task to always remind of it," Olesk said. 
  The minister also underscored that emissaries from Estonia's 
regions of major Russian settlement who now frequent in Moscow 
to blame Estonia have no proper mandate, since they do not 
represent all Russians living in Estonia. 
  "On several occasions, Estonia's legitimate ethnically 
Russian citizens have asked me what kind of right does some of 
such emissaries have to speak in the name of all Russians living 
here," Olesk added.

  [Text] TALLINN, Apr 15, BNS -- A new draft legislation 
that was under its second reading in the Estonian parliament 
Thursday [14 April] is expected to ensure more state-backed 
crediting for medium-size and small companies, opposition 
Centrist MP Kalev Kukk said in a press conference. 
  The general framework of the bill comes from Germany's 
experience in supporting its smaller industries, but nothing of 
this bill has been copied or simply taken over, Kukk explained. 
  The bill's main aim is to ensure that small and medium-size 
companies get access to the capital market. Although such 
companies are doing much to vitalize the country's economy, 
hardly anybody is eager to invest money in them. It is hard for 
such companies to get loans from banks and nobody is willing to 
stand as guarantor for their loans, Kukk said. 
  The bill foresees state support for the companies under two 
different schemes: government loans, or the government acting as 
guarantor for the companies' loans. Money for the loans would 
come from the state budget or from the foreign loans provided to 
the country. 
  The parliament today voted down a proposal to allocate 2.5 
percent of the state budget for supporting smaller businesses. 
  Small and medium-size businesses under the draft legislation 
are defined as companies employing no more than 80 and with an 
annual turnover smaller than 15 million kroons (USD about 1.1 
million). 
  The interest rate on loans to be provided to such companies 
should not exceed 7-9 percent, Kukk said, adding that this would 
be possible if the money be taken from non-profit funds.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 15, BNS -- The Estonian Government at 
its meeting on Thursday [14 April] approved a bill on the 
introduction of temporary travel documents for non-citizens. 
  The documents are to be issued to Estonia's permanent 
non-citizen residents who can no more travel with their Soviet 
passports. The document will be valid only for once leaving 
Estonia and one entry into the country. A new document has to 
be applied for if the holder wants to cross the border again, 
the draft stipulates. 
  The document will be valid for six months from issue and can 
be used only when travelling to countries which accept it as a 
travel document and put their visas in it. 
  The temporary travel document is a document for the 
transition period until Estonia introduces its aliens' 
passports, said Aino Leppik, adviser to the government. 
  Aliens' passports are currently in print and the country 
expects to start their issue in summer, she added.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 15, BNS -- There is nothing to protect 
with measures for domestic market protection, since the level of 
development of Estonia's industrial sector is still too low, 
said Peeter Tohver, deputy chancellor for industry at the 
Ministry of Economics. 
  An open, painful economic policy helps to make clear with 
the 
help of competition, which companies are able to survive, but it 
naturally has a negative effect on the farm industry, he said. 
  Tohver, speaking at a meeting of the Estonian Union of 
Scientists Thursday [14 April], drew parallels with the 
situation of the first years of the 1918-40 Republic of Estonia, 
when a similar lack of capital and structural crisis hindered 
economic development. 
  Industrial sector accounted for 33 percent of Estonia's GDP 
in 1993, and no major changes are likely to happen this year, he 
said. He added that the share of industry in the GDP of Finland 
and Sweden, for example, was about one-fourth. 
  Industrial output in the country dropped 27 percent in 
comparable prices last year when compared with the year before. 
The decline was as big as 30 percent in state and 
municipally-owned businesses. 
  Also the uptrend in industrial output recorded at the end of 
last year again turned to a modest decline in the first months 
of 1994. The output level at the end of March equalled that of 
last year's late summer. 
  A big decline -- from 250,000 in 1985 to 175,000 in 1993 -- 
has taken place in the number of people occupied in the 
industrial sector. About 10,000, or 6 percent of the total 
work force in industry, were employed by private companies in 
the sector last year. But they gave 26.5 percent of the total 
output. 
  Only the farm industry increased its share in the country's 
total industrial output. Energy sector kept its positions, 
whereas all others showed decline.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Jaba Ioseliani, head of the </F>
Georgian delegation at the Georgian-Abkhazian talks in Geneva, 
by an unidentified correspondent; date not given -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Ioseliani] There are no results. There is a lot of 
argument. The formula for the deployment of UN troops in 
Abkhazia changed four times. In effect, the Abkhazians do not 
want troops to be deployed to allow the refugees and displaced 
people to return home. They are playing a cat-and-mouse game 
with us. They want to accept a minimum number of people, very 
few people. 
  The talks were about military aspects. They should have 
discussed how and where UN troops were to be deployed. However, 
the Abkhazians had devised their plans with the knowledge that 
unless troops are deployed, the refugees will not return. So, 
when we agree to something they want, they come up with new 
demands. In a word, they do not want it to go ahead. 
  Pressure on them can only be applied by the Russians. There 
can be no pressure from the United Nations. The rule is that 
everybody should sign the agreement. Troops cannot be deployed 
unless there is mutual consent. What can we do when they do not 
agree? We cannot impose it upon them by force, can we? The 
Russian delegation seems to have taken some steps, however, 
there is no final result yet. 
  There is a fourth formula. Our representative, General 
Vladimir Chikovani, is taking this formula to Tbilisi today. 
Let us see what happens. Batoni [Georgian polite form of 
address] Eduard Shevardnadze will see it. Perhaps consultations 
will be held about it. We will act in accordance with what they 
decide in Tbilisi. But it is a rather complicated formula. 
  At the same time, there is a formula envisaging CIS 
involvement. We were told by the Russians, by General Georgiy 
Kondratyev: Forget them. You see, nothing works out with them, 
the Americans. We will establish order in Abkhazia in three 
days. I do not know, but this is what they are saying. 
  The United Nations is really a bureaucratic and retrograde 
organization. The United Nations say: We have no right to do 
this and that, we have no rights at all. I told them: If you 
have no rights, we do not need your ornamental presence there. 
  They want to do the job wearing white gloves, but nothing 
can 
be done wearing white gloves. 
  [Correspondent] Batoni Jaba, what about Abkhazia's status? 
  [Ioseliani] This will be discussed on 19 April. But if we 
fail to solve this problem here, how can there be any talk about 
the status of Abkhazia. What is the need for a status when the 
issue of the refugees and the deployment of troops has not been 
solved? 
  So, we will act according to the will of the authorities, 
the 
people and Supreme Council. 
  [Correspondent] Batoni Jaba, does Russia have a concrete 
plan? 
  [Ioseliani] Russia agreed to our plan. When we produced it 
on the first day of talks, both the United Nations and Russia 
welcomed it, saying it was a businesslike and good plan. 
However, on the second day they said that the Abkhazians 
disagreed. What could we do if they disagreed? All right, we 
made concessions. They did not agree to the third formula 
either, and we are now discussing a fourth formula today. 
  There will be no end to new formulas because, in effect, 
they 
are against the deployment. They want just a minimum number, 
about 5,000 [as received] troops to be deployed at this stage. 
It will not work that way. 
  [Correspondent] Batoni Jaba, when the Russians ask us to let 
them in and promise to establish order in three days, what do 
they mean and what is their plan? 
  [Ioseliani] They are saying two parties should be involved. 
They or the CIS should be involved. 
  They asked me if we wanted the Ukrainians, on behalf of the 
CIS, and the Turks to be deployed there together. I told them 
that we did not want the Turks, but if it is the Ukrainians, 
then all right. 
  They do not want to act alone and be blamed for anything. 
They want to be peacemakers in the eyes of the world. [passage 
indistinct] They want either the CIS to be involved, or the 
United Nations. Then there will be UN observers. If this does 
not work, let it be a two-party thing, they say. 
  They say: It is not a problem at all to make two airborne 
landings and finish it off. We will establish order in three 
days. 
  [Correspondent] Batoni Jaba, when will this round of talks 
finish? And also, did we achieve any goals or not? 
  [Ioseliani] [Words indistinct] I personally think that the 
Abkhazians will not agree to anything. They will only 
agree...[pauses] They are now having their heads turned by 
victory, so they will not agree to anything. Until you hit them 
in the head and do something to them...[pauses] People are like 
that -- if everything goes unpunished, they carry on doing it. 
  Nevertheless, we won and they lost the information war. All 
countries support us, the United Nations supports us, the 
Russians, in fact, also support us. However, this is only 
verbal support. When it comes to the crunch...[pauses] All 
right, it is a matter of money. 
  The United States promised money but it has not been 
allocated so far. Then, countries will have to gain the 
agreement of their parliaments to send troops. Then, a force 
has to be set up. Then, their rights have to be determined. 
Unless they are attacked, peacekeepers have little freedom of 
action. They just carry out a policing function. [passage 
indistinct] 
  We have influenced world public opinion to believe that we 
are right and that our territorial integrity is necessary. And 
now, if we can do it, even if we burn and scorch everything 
there [words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] Are you in favor of a peaceful or military 
solution? 
  [Ioseliani] Of course, I am in favor of a peaceful solution. 
But I doubt that it is possible because unless they feel some 
pressure, the Abkhazians will not budge. If the Russians allow 
us to do it, if the Russians do not resist us, then my 
Mkhedrioni [special militia] will be enough to deal with them. 
  I told the Russians: Leave us alone, do not interfere, and I 
will show you what kind of people the Abkhazians are. If the 
Russians cannot allow this to happen, then they should deal with 
the problem themselves. 
  Let the United Nations do its business gradually. After it 
solves organizational issues in three or four months, then it 
will send troops and do whatever it likes. But before the 
United Nations does it...[pauses] I do not think we should say 
no to the United Nations. Let the United Nations do its 
business. Meanwhile, we will turn to Russia and the CIS. But 
this should happen under UN auspices. When UN troops are ready, 
they can be deployed. 
  If not, may the Russians leave us alone and we will deal 
with 
the Abkhazians. This is my answer. 
  [Correspondent] If the peace talks are not successful, do 
you 
think that there is a chance for us to win in the war? 
  [Ioseliani] If the Russians do not interfere, of course, 
there is. The Mkhedrioni alone is enough to deal with them, 
provided the Russians do not interfere.

<F P=106> [Georgian-Abkhazian "Statement on Measures for a Political </F>
Settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian Conflict" signed in Moscow 
on 4 April in the presence on representatives from the UN, 
Russian Federation, and CSCE] 
  [Text] 1. The third round of negotiations on a full-scale 
settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict were held in 
Geneva on 22-25 February 1994, in New York on 7-9 March 1994, 
and in Moscow on 29-31 March under the aegis of the UN and with 
the support of the Russian Federation and the participation of 
representatives of the CSCE and the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees. 
  2. The negotiations were conducted in accordance with 
Security Council resolutions 849 (1993) of 9 July 1993, 854 
(1993) of 6 August 1993, 858 (1993) of 24 August 1993, 876 
(1993) of 19 October 1993, 881 (1993) of 4 November 1993, 892 
(1993) of 22 December 1993, 896 (1994) of 31 January 1994, 901 
(1994) of 4 March 1994, and 906 (1994) of 25 March 1994. 
  3. From the date on which this statement has been signed, 
the sides undertake to observe strictly the official cease-fire 
and again reaffirm their obligations not to use force and the 
threat of the use of force against one another in accordance 
with the communique of 13 January 1993. 
  4. The sides have reached an accord and signed a 
quadrilateral agreement on the voluntary return of refugees and 
displaced persons that is appended to this statement. The 
agreement guarantees the return of refugees and displaced 
persons in accordance with current international practice, in 
particular, that of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. 
  A special commission for refugees and displaced persons 
composed of representatives of the sides, the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees, the Russian Federation, and the CSCE 
in its capacity as an observer, will begin work in Sochi in the 
middle of April 1994. Implementation of the agreement will begin 
after the deployment of peacekeeping forces. 
  5. The sides reaffirm their request that the peacekeeping 
operation begin as soon as possible and a Russian military 
contingent form part of the UN peacekeeping troops, as stated in 
the Memorandum on Understanding of 1 December 1993 and the 
Communique of 13 January. The plan for implementing the 
operation to safeguard peace will be coordinated with the sides 
participating in the conflict. 
  The implementation of the operation to safeguard peace 
should 
also facilitate the safe return of refugees and displaced 
persons. 
  The sides again call upon the UN Security Council to extend 
the mandate of the UN Monitoring Mission in Georgia. 
  6. Abkhazia has its own constitution and legislation and its 
corresponding state attributes: hymn, coat of arms, and flag. 
  7. The sides have held consultations on the division of 
powers on the understanding that any agreement on this question 
forms part of the general settlement and will be reached only 
when a final resolution to the conflict has been found. 
  At this stage, the sides have reached a general 
understanding 
on powers relating to joint action in the following spheres: 
  a) foreign policy and foreign economic relations; 
  b) border service; 
  c) customs service; 
  d) power engineering, transport, and communications; 
  e) ecology and the elimination of the consequences of 
natural disasters; 
  f) protection of human and civil rights and freedoms and 
the rights of national minorities. 
  8. The sides have agreed to continue energetic efforts in 
order to achieve a full-scale settlement. 
  The sides will form a corresponding commission that will 
work 
on a permanent basis, taking into account the decisions of the 
UN Security Council and under the chairmanship of the United 
Nations, with the participation of representatives of the CSCE 
and Russian Federation and also international experts. The 
committee will hold regular meetings in Moscow and Geneva. The 
first meeting will take place in Geneva on 19 April 1994. A 
stage-by-stage action program will be elaborated along with 
proposals for the restoration of state-legal relations. 
  9. The sides have adopted a decision to implement additional 
measures on the search for persons missing without trace and 
reburial of the dead. 
  10. The sides, proceeding from the principle of the 
inevitability of punishment for persons who have committed war 
crimes and crimes against humanity, and also serious criminal 
offenses, as determined according to international and national 
law, have agreed to intensify their work concerning the 
investigation of such crimes with the aim of bringing those 
guilty to justice. 
  Persons who, with weapons in hand, are trying or will try to 
wreck the peace process in Abkhazia will also not escape 
punishment. 
  [Signed] On behalf of the Georgian side -- A. Kavsadze, 
  On behalf of the Abkhazian side -- S. Jinjolia. 
  In the presence of: 
  E. Brunner -- on behalf of the United Nations, 
  B. Pastukhov -- on behalf of the Russian Federation, 
  V. Manno -- on behalf of the CSCE. 
  [Dated]Moscow, 4 April 1994.

  [Text] The signatories to the treaty on CIS common security 
called on the UN Security Council to adopt an urgent decision on 
a peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia where the 
Georgian-Abkhazian military conflict has been going on for a 
year and a half already. 
  The statement by the Council of CIS Common Security 
circulated in Moscow today says the participants in the treaty 
on CIS common security could bring their military contingencies 
to the conflict zone as peacekeeping forces with the consent of 
the conflicting parties. This could be done in accordance with 
the treaty on CIS common defense if no decision on the issue was 
made in the future for whatever reasons. 
  The Council of CIS Common Security adopted a statement on 
implementation of a peacekeeping operation in the zone of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict signed by Azerbaijan, Armenia, 
Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, 
and Uzbekistan.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by diplomatic </F>
correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] Georgia's Foreign Minister Aleksandre Chikvaidze 
told Interfax there was hope for certain progress in the moves 
to settle the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict now that agreement had 
been reached on the repatriation of refugees. 
  Chikvaidze said it was slow progress even though nothing had 
been lost and hope remained for breaking the logjam in 
Georgian-Abkhazian relations. 
  Chikvaidze said Georgia and other countries could share many 
thoughts on the draft convention on the rights of ethnic 
minorities. Expert teams would have to work much before the 
convention could be signed, he said. On Thursday the 
Commonwealth's Council of Foreign Ministers decided the document 
was not yet ready for signing. 
  Chikvaidze stressed that Georgia wanted more integration 
with 
the Commonwealth of Independent States and would be working to 
achieve this. Integration was essential primarily from the 
point of view of economics. Georgia would try to keep its 
policies for Russia and other Commonwealth republics balanced 
with a view to promote good relations between the Georgians and 
Russians and other peoples. 
  Chikvaidze felt economic cooperation between Georgia and 
Russia would expand. Expanded cooperation and subsequent 
economic growth could well lead to the exchange of Georgian 
coupons for Russian rubles, said Chikvaidze and cited the 
example of Belarus.

  [Text] The news service of the Union of Georgia's Citizens 
reports that a meeting of the board of the Union of Georgia's 
Citizens has been held in the large hall of the Cinema House. 
  The first issue on the agenda was a speech by Giorgiy 
Zhorzholiani, deputy chairman of the Union, who presented a 
brief outline of major trends and forms of the board's activity 
during the period following the congress [held in March 1994]. 
  The board confirmed the commission chairmen. It was pointed 
out that the Union of Citizens is already beginning to put its 
practical measures into effect. 
  Speaking during debates on determining the political course 
of the Union, which was the final issue on the agenda, the 
chairman of the Union of Young Citizens has said that there 
would be a danger of having an amorphous and unmanageable 
organization unless the Union were experienced emotionally as an 
incorporated organism. In addition, it is essential that 
mistakes should be avoided like those made during the 
confirmation of members of the government. 
  The state treasury was said to be allocated to people who 
have not yet passed either a patriotism test or an honesty test. 
It was also noted that the Union's approval rating would 
decrease sharply unless a serious program was drafted to be 
presented to the electorate. 
  According to Zurab Zhvania, general secretary of the Union, 
there are many serious problems in the Union, but talks about 
the danger of disorganization are rather exaggerated. 
  Union Chairman Eduard Shevardnadze made a closing speech, 
and 
the board passed a resolution.

  [Text] Disagreements on ways of settling the Karabakh 
conflict foiled talks between the Armenian and Azerbaijani 
presidents last week, within the framework of the CIS summit, 
Armenian Foreign Minister Vagan Papazyan told journalists on 
Saturday. 
  He said the two presidents were not planning to hold talks 
in 
the near future. He also announced that initially there had 
been plans to hold a quadripartite meeting on Russia's 
initiative, involving the Russian, Armenian and Azerbaijani 
presidents, and Chairman of Karabakh's State Committee for 
Defense Robert Kocharyan, who was also in Moscow during the 
summit. 
  "If Azerbaijan had given its general agreement to the 
Russian 
peace plan, which envisaged the use of peacekeeping forces and 
was supported by Yerevan and Stepanakert, the talks would have 
been held by all means," stated Papazyan. 
  "Only Russia is ready to send its troops to the conflict 
zone. The UN cannot do so at the moment," he said. He noted, 
however, that the participation of other CIS countries or 
Eastern European states, would be desirable for Russia. 
  "I'm sure this would be desirable for Azerbaijan, as well," 
he said. 
  Commenting on Aliyev's statement that Armenia was carrying 
out aggression against Azerbaijan, Papazyan said that "Armenian 
has been entangled into the conflict, but it is not a warring 
side." He pointed out, at the same time, that if the population 
of Karabakh came under the threat of deportation or genocide, 
Armenia would get involved in fighting "in earnest." Now 
Yerevan is trying to abstain from active participation in the 
conflict to avoid its escalation.

  [Text] Yerevan April 17 TASS--Representatives of the 
Russian- speaking population in Armenia met on Saturday with the 
chairman of the Duma committee for affairs of the CIS, 
Konstantin Zatulin, and chief consultant of this committee and 
member of the Russian Presidential Council, Andrannik Migranyan, 
who arrived in Yerevan. 
  "Around 15,000 Russians are currently residing in Armenia 
and 
they have no complaints about any infringement on their rights 
or ethnic discrimination," said representatives of the Russian 
speaking population during the meeting. 
  Chairman of the "Rossiya" society, Galina Chernousova, told 
Russian lawmakers that this organisation unites ethnic Russians 
in Armenia, protects their interests and rights and renders them 
all possible assistance. The society has branch offices in all 
areas if Armenia, including in places predominantly populated by 
Russians. 
  Chernousova pointed out that the main problem faced by the 
Russian-speaking population in Armenia is the problem of 
education. After Armenia proclaimed independence, all Russian 
schools and faculties teaching in Russian were closed here. 
Armenians who were educated in Russian face the same problems 
as well. The Armenian law on the language demands that 
graduates of higher educational establishments, especially in 
engineering specialities, have a good command of the Armenian 
language. The same applies to those looking for jobs at 
state-run enterprises. Facing difficulties in education, the 
young generation sees no prospects in Armenia and have to leave 
Armenia and live elsewhere, Chernousova said.

  [Text] Men aged from 25 to 45 have been obliged not to 
leave the republic and to undergo a three-month course of 
military training. They can travel to places outside Armenia 
only by special permit. 
  Military training is considered to be a forced measure, 
caused by the complicated situation on the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
border.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Shulman] </F>
  [Text] Baku April 15 TASS -- The Russian plan to settle the 
Karabakh armed conflict and eliminate the conflict aftermath 
that has been passed over to the Armenian and Azeri leadership 
includes many settlement variants. Their implementation may 
result in peace in case of the sides' agreement, Russian 
ambassador at large and head of the Russian mediating mission 
Vladimir Kazimirov told ITAR-TASS here today. 
  In his words, the Russian initiatives aim to terminate 
combat 
operations in the Armenian-Azeri conflict zone, liberate the 
occupied lands and return refugees to places of their permanent 
residence. 
  As for the plan details, Russia offers to separate the 
warring sides within three days after cease-fire. In the 
opinion of Kazimirov, it will take another three days to create 
a buffer or control zone to house international observers. He 
is sure these conditions will enable the liberation of occupied 
Azeri territories and solution of other problems related to the 
conflict. 
  A wise decision must be taken in order to save human lives, 
stop the bloodshed and war in the region, said the ambassador. 
Today's statement on settlement of the Karabakh conflict 
adopted at the Commonwealth summit has the same aims, said the 
diplomat. 
  He stressed the statement is a reaction of the Commonwealth 
state heads to the repeated appeals of Azeri President Geydar 
Aliyev, who thinks it is unnatural that "two Commonwealth states 
are at war". 
  Kazimirov said further war in the region is unpromising, it 
may aggravate the tragedy of the Armenian and Azeri peoples.
